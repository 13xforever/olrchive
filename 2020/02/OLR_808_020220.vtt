00:00.000 --> 00:18.120
This week the director of the first Silent Hill movie reveals a new sequel for it in

00:18.120 --> 00:22.240
the works as well as a Fatal Frame movie which both entices me and scares me to my core.

00:22.240 --> 00:25.200
This is just a piece of enticing news, stay tuned for the rest starting right now on the

00:25.200 --> 00:28.520
show where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.520 --> 00:34.160

come up.

01:16.160 --> 01:20.760
And then in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network Tigerclaw is pointing out

01:20.760 --> 01:23.680
it's also National Hedgehog Day.

01:23.680 --> 01:28.120
Why am I not surprised to hear that from the Sonic the Hedgehog movie's biggest fan?

01:28.120 --> 01:29.480
Techmaster Loki has some input.

01:29.480 --> 01:30.480
Hi, Loki.

01:30.480 --> 01:31.480
I don't have any input.

01:31.480 --> 01:32.480
Oh.

01:32.480 --> 01:33.480
You stopped making up all these holidays.

01:33.480 --> 01:35.480
It's not Hedgehog Day, it's Groundhog Day.

01:35.480 --> 01:41.600
Yeah, I know it's, it's, it's, hi Dark Soccer, Jamie Summers, but I guess is it because hedgehogs

01:41.600 --> 01:45.000
are adjacent to groundhogs?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
I don't know.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.280
No, they're kind of not even the same genus, I think.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.360
I don't know if that's going to pick you up unless you hold that news.

01:52.360 --> 01:54.880
We're trying out a new mic stand approach thing today.

01:54.880 --> 01:55.880
But I think how's that?

01:55.880 --> 01:56.880
Yeah, it's good.

01:56.880 --> 01:58.760
It puts my head on cam.

01:58.760 --> 02:01.320
You might have to just kind of pick it up and hold it that way.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.320
So all right.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.320
Yeah.

02:03.320 --> 02:04.320
Anyhow.

02:04.320 --> 02:08.280
Um, so I don't even know what to ask at the top of the show because we have a we kind

02:08.280 --> 02:10.280
of like a lighter turnout than usual.

02:10.280 --> 02:14.640
There's no Bobby to kind of start the viewing bandwagon here at VOG Network tonight.

02:14.640 --> 02:18.640
There's that football game on television, which I I don't even know who's playing.

02:18.640 --> 02:21.480
I want No, I do one of them San Francisco.

02:21.480 --> 02:25.440
Because everybody here is losing their shit.

02:25.440 --> 02:26.440
Exactly.

02:26.440 --> 02:30.280
Because the local team Well, I hope I hope they're sporting well and made the best sports

02:30.280 --> 02:31.280
or win.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.360
Um, anyhow, we're gonna get into video games, though.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.080
Let's just jump right into it.

02:36.080 --> 02:40.200
Let's talk about what's going on here at the top of the show with some of the news about

02:40.200 --> 02:46.200
Warcraft three reforged Have you guys heard about Yeah, you're forged.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.960
It's not a game I'm really interested in.

02:47.960 --> 02:53.160
I didn't play a whole lot of the Warcraft RTS games aside from like maybe demos that

02:53.160 --> 02:56.640
came with PC gamer.

02:56.640 --> 03:01.320
But I hear that a lot of the stuff that they promised to fix and update and change on this

03:01.320 --> 03:02.320
never happened.

03:02.320 --> 03:06.940
Like, for example, they promised, you know, completely redone cutscenes and everything

03:06.940 --> 03:07.940
in the game.

03:07.940 --> 03:10.040
And apparently, they're exactly the same as they used to be.

03:10.040 --> 03:14.380
Well, I thought some of that was intentional because when they originally revealed this

03:14.380 --> 03:18.900
at BlizzCon, they said that Christy golden, who did a lot of the books was going to be

03:18.900 --> 03:22.500
writing like kind of rewriting some of the dialogue to kind of match.

03:22.500 --> 03:27.060
Well, they actually showed like the you cut some of the cutscenes like one of the cutscenes

03:27.060 --> 03:28.900
in the game was actually in the trailer.

03:28.900 --> 03:32.620
And it was like a very cinematic cutscene like they were going to be completely redoing

03:32.620 --> 03:33.980
the way the cutscenes were.

03:33.980 --> 03:39.580
And that's not what it looks like in the game interest or like redoing the the UI.

03:39.580 --> 03:42.220
And that's not really a thing either.

03:42.220 --> 03:47.820
And it seems like the only like some of the stuff in the game, like I'm trying to think

03:47.820 --> 03:52.780
of all the like bullet points other people have said, like, I think the movement in the

03:52.780 --> 03:59.660
game is like it it's locked down to 20 FPS or whatever, like the actual like unit movement

03:59.660 --> 04:00.660
or whatever.

04:00.660 --> 04:01.660
Yeah.

04:01.660 --> 04:02.660
Which is kind of weird.

04:02.660 --> 04:06.060
And then what was the other thing?

04:06.060 --> 04:10.420
So the really the main thing that's been kind of like redone or whatever is like the graphics

04:10.420 --> 04:13.060
which were outsourced to another company.

04:13.060 --> 04:17.340
And then, of course, the wonderful brand new terms of service that can't miss out any of

04:17.340 --> 04:23.260
that dota money clause, basically saying that, hey, anything they make for Warcraft three,

04:23.260 --> 04:24.580
it's ours.

04:24.580 --> 04:28.380
The thing that really and I just want to give full disclosure, OK, because I don't necessarily

04:28.380 --> 04:32.180
want to totally dunk on this game because the reality is I have not played Warcraft

04:32.180 --> 04:33.360
three reforge.

04:33.360 --> 04:38.100
So I more just want to discuss some of like what I'm hearing about it online, because

04:38.100 --> 04:41.820
it's somewhat making me apprehensive to want to, you know, I've had the Blizzard launcher

04:41.820 --> 04:45.020
not on my computer for a little bit ever since some of the stuff that went on last year.

04:45.020 --> 04:46.820
You know, we kind of talked about that.

04:46.820 --> 04:51.220
I have still not really played Blizzard stuff, so they're refusing refunds to.

04:51.220 --> 04:55.540
But I was thinking about getting into Warcraft three reforge because I remember I liked Warcraft

04:55.540 --> 04:56.540
one.

04:56.540 --> 04:57.540
I like Warcraft two.

04:57.540 --> 05:00.180
Warcraft three came out at a time in my life when I wasn't really gaming.

05:00.180 --> 05:02.460
So I was thinking maybe reforge would be a good time to pick it up.

05:02.460 --> 05:07.460
But all this reaction I'm hearing is making me very apprehensive to pick it up.

05:07.460 --> 05:10.700
And I'm kind of very curious about your guys's thoughts in our chat over at Twitch TV slash

05:10.700 --> 05:14.140
VOG Network for those that are here tonight, especially if you have played Warcraft three

05:14.140 --> 05:15.140
reforge.

05:15.140 --> 05:16.580
I'm kind of curious about your reaction.

05:16.580 --> 05:20.000
Is the Internet tending to overblow this out of proportion?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.700
Because let's be real, that sometimes happens.

05:22.700 --> 05:26.340
You know, for example, I would say a lot of the hysteria that went with Pokemon Sword

05:26.340 --> 05:31.040
and Shield at the end of the day, it's the best fucking Pokemon generation I've played.

05:31.040 --> 05:35.660
So I you know, you can't always trust the Internet polls.

05:35.660 --> 05:38.140
But the reality is there's a lot of talk about this.

05:38.140 --> 05:42.460
And what does take me by surprise, and I'll say this, what kind of takes me by surprise

05:42.460 --> 05:46.460
with all this Warcraft three news is what they did to the old client.

05:46.460 --> 05:49.260
I had no idea that this was happening.

05:49.260 --> 05:54.980
So they've essentially, I guess, disabled the old client when it comes to online play.

05:54.980 --> 05:58.480
You can still play offline Warcraft in the old client.

05:58.480 --> 06:02.980
But if you want to play online, you have to get reforged.

06:02.980 --> 06:07.580
But I think, like, I don't want to misstate it, because I believe you don't have to necessarily

06:07.580 --> 06:12.940
spend the $30 because you own the old one, you just have to buy or you have to download

06:12.940 --> 06:17.380
the problem people are having is that the old Warcraft three was like one gig, the new

06:17.380 --> 06:18.740
one is like 28 gigs.

06:18.740 --> 06:22.800
So you're having to download this new one so you can play online, which you can do without

06:22.800 --> 06:23.800
having to buy it.

06:23.800 --> 06:28.100
So it's not like they held everybody's old copy of Warcraft ransom.

06:28.100 --> 06:32.980
But if you want to play the story mode in Warcraft three reforged and all that, then

06:32.980 --> 06:38.680
you do have to pay the money to the 30 bucks or whatever in order to be able to do that.

06:38.680 --> 06:44.660
And it's I'm kind of surprised that they just really kicked the old client in the shin like

06:44.660 --> 06:49.560
that, because I always kind of got the impression that, you know, the people that were still

06:49.560 --> 06:55.560
playing Warcraft three here in the year 2020, before reforged was out, probably weren't

06:55.560 --> 06:58.240
interested in what reforged had to bring to the table.

06:58.240 --> 07:03.620
So the fact that they disabled the old client, and now you have these terms of service about

07:03.620 --> 07:08.680
you don't own your mod, that part is the part that I think is a little bit like even more

07:08.680 --> 07:12.840
yikes, because now it's Oh, not only do you have to get on a new client, but now you have

07:12.840 --> 07:19.240
to accept the terms of service that are going to say that we have a, I don't want to misappropriate,

07:19.240 --> 07:23.700
but I believe it's that they have a stake in and you not even a sick, they fully own

07:23.700 --> 07:28.100
anything that you create with it, including the fact that they can demand that you make

07:28.100 --> 07:34.900
more like documents available for something and that like, continued work has to be done

07:34.900 --> 07:35.900
on these things.

07:35.900 --> 07:36.900
I don't know.

07:36.900 --> 07:42.860
But it's very like aggressive the terms of service, which to me, if I was a modder, I

07:42.860 --> 07:45.700
wouldn't be even interested in touching that stuff.

07:45.700 --> 07:50.220
I've already decided that I'm not going back to anything Blizzard or Activision has their

07:50.220 --> 07:52.000
fingers in.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.280
I'm sticking to those guns and I have zero interest in this.

07:55.280 --> 08:01.740
If I'm going to play Warcraft, I have a CD or DVD in my house that I could play.

08:01.740 --> 08:06.500
And if I need to emulate something to make it work, I can, I can watch the stuff online,

08:06.500 --> 08:09.680
but they are not getting my money, especially now.

08:09.680 --> 08:13.520
Well, what's shocking about this in some ways is that for the most part, dark soccer, what

08:13.520 --> 08:16.600
you're saying, yes, you could play Warcraft one, you could play Warcraft two, you could

08:16.600 --> 08:19.000
play Warcraft three story mode on your DVD.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.160
But the minute you tried to play Warcraft three online, which is probably, I know you

08:22.160 --> 08:25.240
don't play a lot of games online, probably not something you would do anyway, but the

08:25.240 --> 08:29.000
minute you tried to do that, you can't do that now without this new reforge client.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.500
Well be doing it, don't care.

08:30.500 --> 08:35.940
But that's, but, but I mean, for the fact, I mean, what's, how do I, how do I eloquently

08:35.940 --> 08:36.940
put this?

08:36.940 --> 08:40.320
The fact that you're saying for the most part, I could go back to my old games and I can

08:40.320 --> 08:41.960
go enjoy my old games.

08:41.960 --> 08:47.520
You kind of can't, if you are an online gamer, let's say we have an alternate universe where

08:47.520 --> 08:54.640
dark Sakura is a Warcraft three online troll, and she loves to play online and put man babies

08:54.640 --> 08:55.640
in their place.

08:55.640 --> 09:03.520
Well, I do that anyway, but the reality is for my situation, I don't give a fuck.

09:03.520 --> 09:07.560
I know, but isn't that, isn't it kind of screwed up that maybe the alternate soft or alternate

09:07.560 --> 09:11.800
universe dark Sakura who does enjoy multiplayer gaming can't do it for Warcraft three without

09:11.800 --> 09:15.040
this new client, then there's better games.

09:15.040 --> 09:16.600
There are other games that will do this.

09:16.600 --> 09:22.520
If you want the lore, read the fucking books, maybe, but in the end, sometimes you've got

09:22.520 --> 09:24.800
to put your stuff, your foot down.

09:24.800 --> 09:25.800
Yeah.

09:25.800 --> 09:31.080
Sometimes you have to just say, you know, I am done like me and Facebook.

09:31.080 --> 09:34.980
Interesting that you talk about the alternate, the, the, what you just said about go find

09:34.980 --> 09:38.120
something else to play, because I don't think it made our show roll this week because I

09:38.120 --> 09:42.320
can't remember if it happened in this last week or the week before, but we just had news

09:42.320 --> 09:47.480
about torchlight and torchlight came out with some really big news that there, I forget

09:47.480 --> 09:51.120
the original name of it now, but essentially their expansion, distant worlds or whatever

09:51.120 --> 09:52.120
it was called.

09:52.120 --> 09:56.520
So I know that wasn't the name, sorry, but they rebranded it as torchlight three and

09:56.520 --> 10:01.240
it's going to be a traditional buy it once you get everything like it's the type of game

10:01.240 --> 10:06.160
that, you know, because originally the original model was like a free to play microtransactions

10:06.160 --> 10:07.160
driven thing.

10:07.160 --> 10:11.320
Essentially the audience said, we'd rather not, thanks.

10:11.320 --> 10:16.640
And they listened to their fan base and have reverted now to, okay, it's just torchlight

10:16.640 --> 10:21.560
three and it's just like torchlight one and two, but with all the things you would expect

10:21.560 --> 10:24.520
if we put the number three in front of it, new classes, new maps, blah, blah, blah,

10:24.520 --> 10:25.520
blah, blah.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.400
Now, if this was an Activision product, they would still charge you for the game and then

10:28.400 --> 10:34.220
still, you know, why should we pick one model to business model to go with?

10:34.220 --> 10:38.300
We can just charge you the $60 and charge you all the microtransactions like it was

10:38.300 --> 10:41.460
a free to play game because we're Activision and fuck you.

10:41.460 --> 10:45.420
Okay, so I'm going to turn to the chat room now because again, admittedly it's, it's a

10:45.420 --> 10:50.260
little unfair of me to sit here and dunk on Warcraft three when I haven't played it myself.

10:50.260 --> 10:53.680
I want to see what you guys in our chat over at twitch TV slash fog network have to say

10:53.680 --> 10:58.580
and quest Buster shedding a little light on some things saying, clan support is gone.

10:58.580 --> 11:01.140
Competitive ranked match mating ladders are gone.

11:01.140 --> 11:02.660
Native land support is gone.

11:02.660 --> 11:04.380
Oh, that's huge too.

11:04.380 --> 11:05.380
The land thing.

11:05.380 --> 11:08.140
And I bet, uh, this was the thing that happened with Diablo as well.

11:08.140 --> 11:10.140
I remember that you couldn't do land anymore.

11:10.140 --> 11:15.860
You know, the only way you can play Diablo three on land unmodded on the Nintendo switch.

11:15.860 --> 11:16.860
Think about it.

11:16.860 --> 11:17.860
What is the Nintendo switch now?

11:17.860 --> 11:18.860
It's Nintendo.

11:18.860 --> 11:19.860
Yeah.

11:19.860 --> 11:25.820
Anyway, sometimes being 10 years behind the curve on online helps Nintendo.

11:25.820 --> 11:31.700
This is one of those times anyway, uh, where was I on quest posters, comments here, uh,

11:31.700 --> 11:33.660
custom campaigns cannot be loaded.

11:33.660 --> 11:37.500
So say goodbye to the last 17 years of player made content.

11:37.500 --> 11:42.020
If the game fails to connect to blizzard servers for any reason, you can still boot into single

11:42.020 --> 11:45.660
player, but you can't save your progress for some reason.

11:45.660 --> 11:47.520
Oh my gosh.

11:47.520 --> 11:48.720
Blizzard missed the dota boat.

11:48.720 --> 11:52.100
So now they're like, we need to be more aggressive now.

11:52.100 --> 12:00.020
So interesting point from quest buster and let's humor blizzard here for a minute.

12:00.020 --> 12:05.420
Maybe part of the reason they want more ownership is because they didn't really get anything

12:05.420 --> 12:09.240
out of defense of the ancients being a Warcraft three mod at the end of the day, because those

12:09.240 --> 12:13.060
guys ended up going to valve and making dota two there.

12:13.060 --> 12:15.440
I mean, yes, blizzard made their own.

12:15.440 --> 12:20.700
There was originally blizzard dota, which then they got in that whole argument about

12:20.700 --> 12:22.820
who owns the name dota, right?

12:22.820 --> 12:28.300
And so blizzard made heroes of the storm, which was called blizzard dota at one point.

12:28.300 --> 12:33.280
So this kind of begs the question, like blizzard being irritated that they couldn't have anything

12:33.280 --> 12:34.280
behind.

12:34.280 --> 12:38.220
Oh, they can't have all of the money where poor babies.

12:38.220 --> 12:44.240
Oh, if only they had large franchises under their belt, I, I will humor that angle to

12:44.240 --> 12:47.760
some extent on the basis that they're heroes of the storm.

12:47.760 --> 12:51.180
So well, there would be, yeah, that's another issue.

12:51.180 --> 12:55.620
There would be no dota without Warcraft three period, right?

12:55.620 --> 12:56.960
You can't argue that.

12:56.960 --> 13:04.560
So I can see it to that element, but to assert ownership over everything does feel a little

13:04.560 --> 13:06.240
bit aggressive to me.

13:06.240 --> 13:07.480
Like it just doesn't feel right.

13:07.480 --> 13:08.480
It's a new game though.

13:08.480 --> 13:12.600
They didn't like just repurpose Warcraft three for dota two.

13:12.600 --> 13:16.560
They just built on, they rebuilt it from scratch.

13:16.560 --> 13:21.440
So I'm sorry, you can't take ownership of a mod.

13:21.440 --> 13:22.440
Yeah.

13:22.440 --> 13:23.440
Yeah, I get it.

13:23.440 --> 13:26.720
The original one was running in your engine or whatever, but now it's not.

13:26.720 --> 13:29.600
So tough shit.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.600
So I don't know.

13:30.600 --> 13:33.560
This leaves me, this leaves me just feeling, I don't, I don't know.

13:33.560 --> 13:37.920
Like I, isn't it, isn't, it's really like something to think that they should have ownership

13:37.920 --> 13:40.800
of someone's own work, their mods.

13:40.800 --> 13:45.480
Like I get it that it was a mod for a game or something, but that's not your work.

13:45.480 --> 13:48.320
You may have built the tools for if you didn't want people making stuff with it, then don't

13:48.320 --> 13:53.480
build the tools, but they, there would be no way there would be no shell for the tools

13:53.480 --> 13:56.200
without their game, but I get it.

13:56.680 --> 14:04.400
I understand, but you, in the end of the day, it comes down to that they're angry at themselves

14:04.400 --> 14:10.880
for not putting more aggressive terms of use so that they could own other people's content.

14:10.880 --> 14:11.880
I will agree with that.

14:11.880 --> 14:16.800
Bethesda's doing now like, well, like Activision Blizzard's doing now.

14:16.800 --> 14:17.800
That's pathetic.

14:17.800 --> 14:24.760
I would say what this forcing the old Warcraft players to accept a new terms of service to

14:24.800 --> 14:32.640
back park the car into ownership of mods that is way over the, that is not, that's overcompensating

14:32.640 --> 14:33.640
what would have been.

14:33.640 --> 14:34.640
And you know what?

14:34.640 --> 14:40.120
It's great that we live in a time now where, you know, the easiest to make games as much

14:40.120 --> 14:41.640
easier than it used to be.

14:41.640 --> 14:45.600
And maybe some of these folks that are thinking about modding games like Warcraft three or

14:45.600 --> 14:48.440
mastered whatever can decide, Hey, you know what?

14:48.440 --> 14:53.240
Maybe instead I'll just go ahead and try something from scratch in like a unity or unreal engine

14:53.240 --> 14:56.920
or something like that where I actually own the shit I'm putting together, which is what

14:56.920 --> 14:57.920
Dota two is.

14:57.920 --> 14:58.920
Exactly.

14:58.920 --> 15:04.360
Uh, is that in our chat at Twitch TV slash vog network says derivative works, not copyright.

15:04.360 --> 15:09.680
So when you get into something where you've modded the game extensively, uh, is it a derivative

15:09.680 --> 15:10.680
work?

15:10.680 --> 15:14.200
Now I'm not a legal expert, so I don't know to what extent a mod could claim, but I would

15:14.200 --> 15:23.000
imagine if ultimately the name Dota ended up with valve with the original mod creators,

15:23.000 --> 15:26.800
then the courts must have, or I don't know, I think it was a settlement, so there really

15:26.800 --> 15:32.600
was no court ruling, but I was going to say things did air on the side of the mod owners

15:32.600 --> 15:35.680
got to keep the name blizzard and keep that name.

15:35.680 --> 15:36.680
They had to change it to here.

15:36.680 --> 15:40.880
Well, I could especially like, like say, okay, yeah, you, you have ownership of this mod

15:40.880 --> 15:41.880
now.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.400
However, I'm making my own thing.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.600
Dota two, you have no ownership of that.

15:46.600 --> 15:52.880
And they're mad that they didn't get in on that train when they could too bad.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.400
You had an opportunity to compete in that space.

15:55.400 --> 15:56.800
You did it poorly.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.240
What do you want?

15:58.240 --> 16:02.760
And now they're practically guaranteeing that they're not going to have any major fan made

16:02.760 --> 16:08.880
content apart from maybe just like something like deadly boss mods, the equivalent of something

16:08.880 --> 16:13.080
like that helper tools, but no like actual full mods.

16:13.080 --> 16:20.640
And in my opinion, uh, blizzard, I keep wanting to say blizzard Dota now heroes of the storm

16:20.640 --> 16:23.680
for me was the strongest of all those Dota games.

16:23.680 --> 16:27.920
I prefer it to Dota two and league of legends be quite simply on the basis.

16:27.920 --> 16:31.340
I think it's the easiest one to grab with the least amount of micromanagement going

16:31.340 --> 16:38.240
on in the game and the least toxic fans, um, which isn't saying much, but it is at least

16:38.240 --> 16:40.480
from my experience underlined bolded.

16:40.480 --> 16:45.480
Uh, that is what I felt when I played heroes of the storm and it really wasn't until blizzard

16:45.480 --> 16:52.280
themselves pretty much pulled it from a trajectory where it was going by saying, Oh, here's the

16:52.280 --> 16:53.720
dorm is done up.

16:53.720 --> 16:54.720
Here's the dorm.

16:54.720 --> 16:56.320
That was the e-sports thing.

16:56.320 --> 16:57.320
Yeah.

16:57.320 --> 17:00.520
So they, they pulled that and they, they scaled way back on heroes of the storm, essentially

17:00.520 --> 17:04.000
saying we're not going to support this on the level that we have been because at the

17:04.000 --> 17:06.480
end of the day, it's not because the game was bad or anything.

17:06.480 --> 17:10.800
It's because I can't make enough money off of the game because I'm a greedy fucking company

17:10.800 --> 17:12.840
and corporation.

17:12.840 --> 17:20.080
And that's what it is, is they wanted more money and sorry, sorry, you didn't make more

17:20.080 --> 17:21.380
money.

17:21.380 --> 17:22.380
You know what?

17:22.380 --> 17:23.380
Too fucking bad.

17:23.380 --> 17:27.180
It just, it just brings me to this kind of like closing thought on this topic, which

17:27.180 --> 17:30.240
is like, what's, what's wrong blizzard?

17:30.240 --> 17:31.240
What's what's wrong.

17:31.240 --> 17:32.240
Do you guys need to talk?

17:32.240 --> 17:33.240
Do you need a hug?

17:33.240 --> 17:38.880
Like I, I feel like ever since Mike Morhaime left, it's just been, are you okay?

17:38.880 --> 17:40.160
Are you okay?

17:40.160 --> 17:41.160
Like honest.

17:41.160 --> 17:44.080
Is this their call for, is it the employee's call for help?

17:44.080 --> 17:46.160
Like the lawyers are like begging for help.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.160
I don't know.

17:47.160 --> 17:48.360
Like what's going on Bliss?

17:48.360 --> 17:53.200
Like I, I'm at a loss.

17:53.200 --> 17:59.720
I'm legit concerned for things like Diablo four and Overwatch two, which I mean, Overwatch

17:59.720 --> 18:04.160
two has a whole nother controversy going on with that.

18:04.160 --> 18:07.240
And you know, the whole expansion versus new game and all that.

18:07.240 --> 18:08.760
I ain't here to touch that tonight.

18:08.760 --> 18:09.760
That's a whole nother Oprah.

18:09.760 --> 18:12.000
We can wait until the game is out to discuss that.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
You know what it is?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.400
If this was Oprah, we'd have free shit.

18:14.400 --> 18:19.080
You're lucky that they're only charging $60 for an expansion or whatever it is.

18:19.080 --> 18:25.260
But the reality is like, I'm losing more and more confidence in blizzard with every time

18:25.260 --> 18:28.480
their name has come up on this program in the last year and a half.

18:28.480 --> 18:29.480
And I've lost it.

18:29.480 --> 18:30.480
I know.

18:30.480 --> 18:31.480
I know.

18:31.480 --> 18:32.480
I hear you.

18:32.480 --> 18:33.480
I hear you.

18:33.480 --> 18:37.560
And you know, you're somebody who spent a lot of time and money on world of Warcraft.

18:37.560 --> 18:41.120
I'm somebody who spent a lot of time money on world of Warcraft used to have a blizzard

18:41.120 --> 18:42.720
focused podcast.

18:42.720 --> 18:46.300
I donated all of my paperbacks that I had spent money on.

18:46.300 --> 18:48.040
The only ones I have are my hardcovers.

18:48.040 --> 18:52.400
I only, I think still have my thrall book and like one other, and that's it.

18:52.400 --> 18:53.400
Yeah.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.640
Anyway, looking at some other comments from chat here, and then we'll move on to the next

18:56.640 --> 18:57.640
topic.

18:57.640 --> 19:01.220
Questbuster in chat says in a weird roundabout way, blizzard didn't have to change their

19:01.220 --> 19:02.980
end user license agreement.

19:02.980 --> 19:06.240
Any ideas that could have been mined from Warcraft three have been mined with Dota

19:06.240 --> 19:10.960
and League of Legends, and any new games might instead take inspiration from those

19:10.960 --> 19:16.620
as opposed to something 17 plus years old, but I guess they need everything.

19:16.620 --> 19:22.680
And as that says, Activision wants that dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar.

19:22.680 --> 19:24.760
Anyway, I don't know.

19:24.760 --> 19:31.640
Like I just, I hope blizzard can figure out what they're doing wrong and how that's happening

19:31.640 --> 19:32.640
on a management level.

19:32.640 --> 19:37.320
Cause I know it ain't the frontline employees who work very hard on these visions, it ain't

19:37.320 --> 19:38.320
them.

19:38.320 --> 19:39.320
It's coming up.

19:39.320 --> 19:44.800
The call is coming from inside the house and it's probably the biggest boardroom on the

19:44.800 --> 19:45.800
campus.

19:45.800 --> 19:48.480
It's management decisions that are screwing things up.

19:48.480 --> 19:56.100
So I hope to hell blizzard can figure this out or it's going to just be sad trombone

19:56.100 --> 19:57.680
every time their name comes up.

19:57.680 --> 20:03.120
I firmly believe that when people get to the upper management level, they lose touch with

20:03.120 --> 20:08.220
the common sense part of running a company and only look at things like market research

20:08.220 --> 20:11.880
and don't think about how things are actually going to affect players unless you were dealing

20:11.880 --> 20:16.920
only with brand recognition and using the Warcraft name as money.

20:16.920 --> 20:20.480
Other than that, they're out of touch.

20:20.480 --> 20:25.140
How many, how many hours a week do you think executives at video game companies spend playing

20:25.140 --> 20:26.140
the games?

20:26.620 --> 20:29.820
Not at all.

20:29.820 --> 20:30.820
Some of them.

20:30.820 --> 20:32.740
Some of them I would say do.

20:32.740 --> 20:36.500
I would say Phil Spencer, head of X-Box plays a shit ton of X-Box.

20:36.500 --> 20:37.500
I would say that.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.700
But you, you get that from that guy.

20:39.700 --> 20:43.780
He like how much has X-Box turned around since he took over?

20:43.780 --> 20:45.460
You can tell who has the love.

20:45.460 --> 20:46.460
Yes.

20:46.460 --> 20:49.580
And then you can tell who has the love of money.

20:49.580 --> 20:51.420
Like Don Mattrick who preceded him.

20:51.420 --> 20:52.420
Yeah.

20:52.420 --> 20:53.420
Anyway.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.420
All right.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.420
Well, let's move on.

20:55.700 --> 20:58.580
What are some of the decisions that came out of Sega toward the end of their console days?

20:58.580 --> 20:59.580
Yeah.

20:59.580 --> 21:00.580
All right.

21:00.580 --> 21:01.580
Let's move on.

21:01.580 --> 21:06.260
Just I, all I can do, Blizzard and executives, I'm just going to send my thoughts and prayers

21:06.260 --> 21:08.300
that you all figure it out.

21:08.300 --> 21:10.180
Which we know just does jack shit.

21:10.180 --> 21:11.180
So.

21:11.180 --> 21:13.100
So this is on you guys to figure out.

21:13.100 --> 21:14.100
All right.

21:14.100 --> 21:17.700
Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have

21:17.700 --> 21:19.220
been playing this week.

21:19.220 --> 21:22.700
And while dark soccer starts her gaming week, I'm going to enjoy one of these cookies.

21:22.700 --> 21:24.700
Is it a biscuit or is it a cookie?

21:24.980 --> 21:27.380
So I'll hold it up in front of the camera real quick.

21:27.380 --> 21:28.380
I already ate one.

21:28.380 --> 21:29.380
So shut up.

21:29.380 --> 21:30.380
Okay.

21:30.380 --> 21:31.380
So what are they?

21:31.380 --> 21:32.780
So she's holding up Viennese Whirls.

21:32.780 --> 21:33.780
Ooh, vanilla.

21:33.780 --> 21:34.780
Oh, they're actually.

21:34.780 --> 21:35.780
They're actually.

21:35.780 --> 21:36.780
Downton Abbey branded.

21:36.780 --> 21:39.540
They're Downton Abbey branded cookies.

21:39.540 --> 21:41.860
And yes, it says $4.99 on the package.

21:41.860 --> 21:44.500
They were 30% off and I bought the fuck out of them.

21:44.500 --> 21:47.260
I hope Judi Dench judges me as I eat one.

21:47.260 --> 21:48.260
Okay.

21:48.260 --> 21:49.260
Dame Judi Dench.

21:49.260 --> 21:53.540
So I went to the whole reason I went to the world market was because they closed down

21:53.580 --> 21:55.500
the one in Elk Grove.

21:55.500 --> 22:00.340
And that's the only place I can find my Twinning's Lady Grey Tea, which I absolutely love and

22:00.340 --> 22:01.980
I blame Tiara for.

22:01.980 --> 22:04.260
So anyway.

22:04.260 --> 22:11.900
I have been playing Animal Crossing in Pokemon Go, really.

22:11.900 --> 22:15.100
I had a smattering of pinball.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.620
You okay there, Rob?

22:17.620 --> 22:20.420
So I had a smattering of pinball going on with this.

22:20.900 --> 22:26.380
I've also been back to playing a lot of Patterned, just because I relaunched the game to play

22:26.380 --> 22:32.060
it on my Mac and wanted to redo the puzzles and I'm doing all the new puzzles on my phone

22:32.060 --> 22:35.020
as well and when I'm done with that, then I'll cry because I fucking love that game

22:35.020 --> 22:36.500
and they need more puzzles.

22:39.340 --> 22:43.420
I haven't, well, you know, I had that sinus infection and I was still pretty sick this

22:43.420 --> 22:47.980
last week, so every time I was gonna sit down to play something in front of me, I was like,

22:48.020 --> 22:52.300
ah, I'll play this, no I won't, I'll play, no I won't.

22:52.300 --> 22:58.540
So it was just a bunch of that and just staring at my phone and playing the shit on there.

22:58.540 --> 23:01.900
And then of course, the stuff that I wanted to play at home today, I could not.

23:01.900 --> 23:06.780
I decided to not be at my house because of the superb owl.

23:06.780 --> 23:12.540
So I am avoiding sports ball like it's a plague because it is.

23:12.540 --> 23:13.540
Right now.

23:13.540 --> 23:14.540
Mogi.

23:14.540 --> 23:17.300
I actually played a few things this week.

23:17.300 --> 23:24.860
I played Orna some more, so I'm level 122 and I did make it a point to actually play

23:24.860 --> 23:31.740
a few other things, so I went back and booted up Minecraft, the Bedrock Edition, because

23:31.740 --> 23:36.380
I was looking at, I'm still looking at doing a Bedrock server, but I wanted to research

23:36.380 --> 23:43.420
more on how servers work on the Bedrock Edition, I haven't really done anything like that.

23:43.420 --> 23:44.420
So I have to look and see.

23:44.420 --> 23:48.900
I still have to figure out if the PlayStation 4 support servers currently, they just got

23:48.900 --> 23:54.940
the Bedrock Edition in December, and I don't know if that was part of it, the server part.

23:54.940 --> 23:55.940
So I'll have to see.

23:55.940 --> 24:01.780
And then the other game, I picked up Deer Simulator, which I haven't played yet, but

24:01.780 --> 24:02.780
that's, it's a really weird.

24:02.780 --> 24:04.940
Is that the game they have at every Walmart?

24:04.940 --> 24:09.540
No, this is more like Goat Simulator, just ridiculous, stupid.

24:09.540 --> 24:13.780
I'm thinking of Big Game Hunter, that's Deer Hunter Simulator.

24:14.140 --> 24:15.140
Oops, big difference.

24:15.140 --> 24:17.020
Yes, big difference.

24:17.020 --> 24:21.140
The other game I played, which is also kind of a simulator game, is called the Coin Game,

24:21.140 --> 24:30.680
and the Coin Game is basically a first-person arcade patron simulator game.

24:30.680 --> 24:37.580
So you go and you play all of the ticket spitter games that you possibly could want to play.

24:37.580 --> 24:39.980
They have all of your favorites there, and then...

24:39.980 --> 24:41.680
Wait, this is Ticket Spitter Simulator.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.420
It's a Ticket Spitter Simulator.

24:43.420 --> 24:49.300
So you actually, so what they have right now is basically, it's just, they call it

24:49.300 --> 24:50.660
Birthday Mode.

24:50.660 --> 24:52.140
You start off with $50.

24:52.140 --> 24:57.260
It's really unlimited money, and then you earn money, or tickets, and you get prizes

24:57.260 --> 24:58.260
and stuff like that.

24:58.260 --> 25:01.140
But they're going to have a survival mode that they're building in right now that basically

25:01.140 --> 25:05.580
the way that works is you go, you're your kid, so you have certain hours that you can

25:05.580 --> 25:09.140
be in the arcade and stuff, because you have your curfew and stuff.

25:09.140 --> 25:15.820
So you go, you make, you win stuff with these tickets, you get prizes, you take them to

25:15.820 --> 25:22.600
a pawn shop, and you pawn them off, and you get money, and it just, it's like, yeah.

25:22.600 --> 25:26.060
And then you have your own house and everything, so you can actually get the prize.

25:26.060 --> 25:30.220
This is kind of part of the game too, right now, is you can actually, any prizes you can

25:30.220 --> 25:34.020
go to your house, you can go put them on your walls and stuff like that, and it's just,

25:34.020 --> 25:35.620
it's ridiculous.

25:35.620 --> 25:39.940
I feel like I want to play a ticket spitter simulator game that's mixed with Five Nights

25:39.940 --> 25:45.420
at Freddy's, and so the premise is tickets or death.

25:45.420 --> 25:47.420
Tickets or death?

25:47.420 --> 25:48.780
Yes.

25:48.780 --> 25:52.460
Would you play, Dark Sakura, would you play tickets or death?

25:52.460 --> 25:55.620
I'll have the chicken.

25:55.620 --> 26:01.940
Well it is, it is a game that they made in Unity, so I guess you could, you know, potentially

26:01.940 --> 26:05.980
there, but like, I have to say, like, the physics of the games are pretty spot on, if

26:05.980 --> 26:10.620
not a little bit more forgiving, like, I know the claw games, definitely more forgiving,

26:10.620 --> 26:15.460
but it still has that limp claw physics and everything, and they've got, you know, just

26:15.460 --> 26:18.740
like all the, but on top of that though, like, and I haven't really gotten to play through

26:18.740 --> 26:23.820
much of it, but they have multiple arcades you can go to, including the Midway, and not

26:23.820 --> 26:30.460
only do they have ticket games there, but they have go-karts, they have laser tag, and

26:30.460 --> 26:34.580
they've got, like, other, like, Oh, this is why you downloaded it.

26:34.580 --> 26:37.020
It's the virtual laser tag part of ticket or die.

26:37.020 --> 26:42.980
It just, it looks, it looked really fun, just to mess around with, so yeah, the coin game

26:42.980 --> 26:50.340
is fun messing around with that, but, yeah, so that's what I played this week.

26:50.340 --> 26:53.860
For my gaming week, I was traveling out of town a few days for work this week, so that

26:53.860 --> 26:57.980
kind of cut into my gaming time, although I did bring my Switch, so at the hotel I was

26:57.980 --> 27:01.660
able to play a little bit of Pokémon Shield and work on my Pokédex a little bit, and

27:01.660 --> 27:06.060
I was playing some of the classic Super Nintendo archive stuff, so playing some Super Metroid

27:06.060 --> 27:10.820
and some A Link to the Past, just a little bit, and a little more Sayonara Wild Hearts

27:10.820 --> 27:15.060
too, just because I was randomly thinking about that game, and I was like, I shall play

27:15.060 --> 27:17.180
this game.

27:17.180 --> 27:22.500
When I was at home, still continuing on Final Fantasy XIV, my friends made me, because I

27:22.500 --> 27:27.420
was really resistant for a long time to do the new 24-man raid, the copied factory, which

27:27.420 --> 27:33.180
is the one that's inspired by Nier, so I really kind of just didn't want to do it,

27:33.180 --> 27:39.540
because sometimes those new raids, they're just a mess, and you wipe a bunch, and it's

27:39.540 --> 27:44.180
like, so much time to get through, but it didn't end up being that bad, I guess.

27:44.180 --> 27:48.660
It was fine, but I was also kind of like, okay, we got through it.

27:48.660 --> 27:53.420
The music was really good, and it was a really pretty kind of raid, but then I was also kind

27:53.420 --> 28:00.300
of like, okay, you guys were hyping that up a lot, and the music was really good, though,

28:00.300 --> 28:01.300
I will say that.

28:01.300 --> 28:04.620
The music was really great, especially in that last fight that you do in the copied

28:04.620 --> 28:09.060
factory, so I did finally go through that, and I've just been working on random stuff

28:09.060 --> 28:14.940
in Final Fantasy XIV, so yay for MMOs, and yay for continued adventures in No Man's Sky.

28:14.940 --> 28:17.420
I've still been playing that.

28:17.420 --> 28:22.340
I've probably played more No Man's Sky this time around than any other time I've revisited

28:22.340 --> 28:26.060
the game, because you know every nine months or so I end up, ooh, what's new in No Man's

28:26.060 --> 28:27.060
Sky?

28:27.060 --> 28:28.060
Let's go visit it.

28:28.060 --> 28:32.220
I was visiting my Steam library, and I noticed I did not have No Man's Sky installed on my

28:32.220 --> 28:37.220
computer, so I did that, but I've yet to go back and actually play it.

28:37.220 --> 28:38.220
All right.

28:38.220 --> 28:44.300
Okay, well, if that's it for our gaming weeks, then we will move on and get into some more

28:44.300 --> 28:46.220
stories for tonight.

28:46.220 --> 28:49.000
Just housekeeping, we're in February now, right?

28:49.000 --> 28:54.760
So there's not going to be a live show, actually it would be March 1st, but I'm hoping we can

28:54.760 --> 28:58.080
tape something in a bit, because I'm going to be gone March 1st and March 8th.

28:58.080 --> 29:02.200
I've mentioned this on the show before, but I'm going off with the Starboard Power Coupling

29:02.200 --> 29:04.280
Kids onto the Star Trek Cruise.

29:04.280 --> 29:05.400
I'm very excited about it.

29:05.400 --> 29:09.600
I actually think one of those days I had a sistery thing to do anyway, so.

29:09.600 --> 29:12.040
Okay, well, then I guess that works out, so yeah.

29:12.040 --> 29:16.800
So March 1st and March 8th, no live shows, although Bobby Black Wolf will be here, and

29:16.800 --> 29:22.040
I'm hoping we will have at least for one of those weeks something ready to go, because

29:22.040 --> 29:25.280
you know I hate going two weeks, I hate going one week missing a show, but I really hate

29:25.280 --> 29:26.280
going two weeks, so.

29:26.280 --> 29:30.200
Well, I'm also going to say that I'm going to be doing a gaming-related thing in April.

29:30.200 --> 29:34.240
I mean, it's not going to affect the show, but I'd like, I will be talking about it,

29:34.240 --> 29:40.480
is that our local leather bar, The Bolt, has gamer night every third Friday.

29:40.480 --> 29:44.000
I've been, I went to one of the first ones, and I got to be on it.

29:44.040 --> 29:48.400
I hope maybe they've learned, because when I went, all it was was that on the TVs they

29:48.400 --> 29:53.560
were playing Smash Brothers, and I was kind of like, this is, hopefully they've added

29:53.560 --> 29:54.560
on it.

29:54.560 --> 29:55.560
April's is going to be classic games.

29:55.560 --> 29:56.560
Oh, fun.

29:56.560 --> 30:01.560
So I will be there in face as a sister, but I will gladly also report on it for the show.

30:01.560 --> 30:02.560
I want to go!

30:02.560 --> 30:04.720
Yeah, go, well, it's also my friend's birthday.

30:04.720 --> 30:05.720
I have to mention-

30:05.720 --> 30:07.720
You want to go to the leather daddy bar with us?

30:07.720 --> 30:08.720
Not really.

30:08.720 --> 30:12.680
Well, not that I could, hey, I'm sure that'd be fun, but I just, I don't think I get the

30:12.680 --> 30:13.680
time.

30:13.680 --> 30:14.680
I get it.

30:14.680 --> 30:15.680
Yeah.

30:15.680 --> 30:19.320
Um, so I wanted to mention, and I don't remember if I mentioned this last week or before, but

30:19.320 --> 30:22.720
like there's this 80s cafe that's over-

30:22.720 --> 30:23.720
Oh, the one in Rancho.

30:23.720 --> 30:24.720
Yeah.

30:24.720 --> 30:25.720
Yeah, yeah, I know that place.

30:25.720 --> 30:29.240
So they've got like, um, arcade games in there as well, and plus you can pay like a buck

30:29.240 --> 30:31.440
and they have like console games set up and everything.

30:31.440 --> 30:32.440
Oh, I did not.

30:32.440 --> 30:36.840
And they have, uh, the servers are dressed up as well in costume, so they have one guy

30:36.840 --> 30:41.260
that's dressed up like Ernest P. Worrell, and, uh, who's the other guy?

30:41.260 --> 30:42.760
Is that the guy from the Ernst films?

30:42.760 --> 30:43.760
Yes.

30:43.760 --> 30:44.760
Oh my God.

30:44.760 --> 30:45.760
Hey, Vern.

30:45.760 --> 30:46.760
Yeah, exactly.

30:46.760 --> 30:47.760
So-

30:47.760 --> 30:48.760
Yeah, he died.

30:48.760 --> 30:49.760
I-

30:49.760 --> 30:50.760
That's great.

30:50.760 --> 30:51.760
Yeah.

30:51.760 --> 30:59.800
Um, Azette is saying that I got a Pokestop added there.

30:59.800 --> 31:04.080
So if you, if you have spun the Pokestop at the 80s cafe, thank Azette.

31:04.080 --> 31:09.200
But yeah, it's definitely worth checking out because the, their food looks pretty good

31:09.200 --> 31:10.200
too.

31:10.200 --> 31:11.200
They have a Cap'n Crunch milkshake.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.200
I should have.

31:12.200 --> 31:13.200
Damn it.

31:13.200 --> 31:15.040
That's where I was going to go for Sunday for dinner.

31:15.040 --> 31:18.680
I was like thinking, I'm like, there's a place I was going to go to stop.

31:18.680 --> 31:19.680
I'm like, where was it?

31:19.680 --> 31:20.680
I can't think of it.

31:20.680 --> 31:22.600
So I ended up getting a sandwich thing.

31:22.600 --> 31:23.600
Damn it.

31:23.600 --> 31:24.600
Damn it.

31:24.600 --> 31:25.600
Damn it.

31:25.600 --> 31:26.600
Damn it.

31:26.600 --> 31:27.600
All right.

31:27.600 --> 31:28.600
As it says Tetris Tots.

31:28.600 --> 31:29.600
Right.

31:29.600 --> 31:30.600
Well, okay.

31:30.600 --> 31:31.600
Oh, it's Tetris Tots.

31:31.600 --> 31:32.600
All right.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.700
I will, we will, uh, go, go forth into the community, uh, while we have a couple of weeks

31:34.700 --> 31:37.080
of no live show and bring back some reports.

31:37.080 --> 31:41.160
But I know I actually don't own anything leather except for a belt and some shoes.

31:41.160 --> 31:46.600
I need, I, I, I don't either, but Alan does, and we're not going to talk about that on

31:46.600 --> 31:48.040
my live internet podcast.

31:48.040 --> 31:54.480
Well, I'm, I'm just saying that I would feel that maybe I'll have to like do like at least

31:54.480 --> 31:59.640
like my wimple or something, you know, but at any rate, um, you know, it's also though

31:59.640 --> 32:01.880
my friend's birthday and two days before my birthday.

32:01.880 --> 32:02.880
So, okay.

32:02.880 --> 32:03.880
That'd be fun.

32:03.880 --> 32:04.880
Yeah.

32:04.880 --> 32:05.880
All right.

32:05.880 --> 32:06.880
Sounds good.

32:06.880 --> 32:07.880
All right.

32:07.880 --> 32:10.560
Um, I guess we can move on then.

32:10.560 --> 32:13.920
Let's talk about, let's get into some gaming news and, uh, some of the stories from the

32:13.920 --> 32:14.920
week.

32:14.920 --> 32:15.920
So, uh, Loki, I think we'll start with you.

32:15.920 --> 32:16.920
Yes.

32:16.920 --> 32:23.400
But speaking of pokey stops, sort of speaking of leather daddies, um, uh, Pokemon home is

32:23.400 --> 32:29.000
a brand new service that they're going to try to, um, milk some more money out of you.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.800
Uh, because Hey, you know how you're paying for Nintendo online.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.960
That's not online enough for Pokemon.

32:34.960 --> 32:40.040
We need some more money because storing those Pokemon is hard.

32:40.040 --> 32:46.880
And so, um, they have, they will have a basic service, which is free, or you can get the

32:46.880 --> 32:53.480
premium service, which is $3 a month or $16 a year.

32:53.480 --> 32:59.120
And uh, so basically the way it goes, um, this is going to be kind of replacing the

32:59.120 --> 33:01.400
old Pokemon bank.

33:01.400 --> 33:06.720
If you get the basic service, um, you can, I guess deposit three 30 Pokemon.

33:07.080 --> 33:14.280
Uh, you can place three of them in the wonder box at one time, which I don't know how that

33:14.280 --> 33:15.280
works.

33:15.280 --> 33:17.520
I don't know if that's like you put something in and hope you get something good out of

33:17.520 --> 33:18.520
that.

33:18.520 --> 33:26.440
Um, and then of course they have, um, one Pokemon that you could put in the GTS at once.

33:26.440 --> 33:32.880
They in order to trade, um, you can participate in room trades and then they have the judge

33:32.880 --> 33:36.040
functions unavailable platinum.

33:36.040 --> 33:41.200
It jumps up quite a bit so you can move Pokemon from the Pokemon bank.

33:41.200 --> 33:50.240
Um, with that you can get up store up to 6,000 Pokemon, 30 and 6,000 seems quite the jump.

33:50.240 --> 33:54.800
Um, you can put 10 Pokemon in the wonder box at once.

33:54.800 --> 33:57.480
Three Pokemon can place in GTS.

33:57.480 --> 34:00.000
Um, you can participate and host room trades.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.360
You want to go to the wonder box, little Pikachu?

34:02.360 --> 34:04.400
You want to go to the wonder box?

34:04.400 --> 34:05.400
What's the wonder box?

34:05.760 --> 34:06.760
I don't know.

34:06.760 --> 34:10.640
The wonder box sounds like you get to drink from the fire hose.

34:10.640 --> 34:11.640
Yes.

34:11.640 --> 34:14.640
That's what it sounds like.

34:14.640 --> 34:16.640
Uh, yes.

34:16.640 --> 34:23.400
Um, I don't know, but I do know like there were, they had a, and it's not in this article,

34:23.400 --> 34:25.760
but they have like a diagram talking about how.

34:25.760 --> 34:26.760
Thank you.

34:26.760 --> 34:27.760
Fifth dream.

34:27.760 --> 34:28.760
Wonder box equals trading.

34:28.760 --> 34:31.760
They, I knew some, if is Shane not here tonight, he must actually be watching the super bowl

34:31.760 --> 34:32.760
or something.

34:32.760 --> 34:33.760
Fifth dream's helping us out.

34:33.760 --> 34:34.760
Wonder box equals trading.

34:35.120 --> 34:41.320
Um, so they have like a diagram because apparently the way you can move Pokemon through this,

34:41.320 --> 34:44.480
and I think this works with Pokemon go as well, is they can only go in certain directions.

34:44.480 --> 34:50.320
So like for example, with, there's a fucking diagram about like how this, the, the square

34:50.320 --> 34:53.760
peg can go in this square hole, but not this round hole.

34:53.760 --> 34:57.760
And Pikachu from here can go there, but Pikachu, once he's there, can't go back.

34:57.760 --> 35:00.560
So you better make sure like it's, it's fucking complicated.

35:00.560 --> 35:01.560
Yes.

35:01.560 --> 35:02.560
Yeah.

35:02.560 --> 35:07.880
On one hand, I kind of get it and I give him a pass because you know, we're talking about

35:07.880 --> 35:13.120
Pokemon the day, all the way back to the game boy from 1990 and technologies have changed

35:13.120 --> 35:14.120
quite a bit.

35:14.120 --> 35:17.560
And then you have the complication of you have that old, old game, but then we had the

35:17.560 --> 35:22.360
virtual console versions of those games that would allow you to put things into the Pokemon

35:22.360 --> 35:23.360
bank.

35:23.360 --> 35:29.360
But now I don't know how home changes that is Pokemon home going to be on three D S because

35:29.840 --> 35:34.640
home is probably not going to be a three D S and Pokemon home is replacing Pokemon bank.

35:34.640 --> 35:39.120
And only if you get premium, can you move this Pokemon from Pokemon bank to Pokemon

35:39.120 --> 35:40.120
home?

35:40.120 --> 35:45.800
Well, all right then I can tell you that that sounds like a whole bunch of bullshit that

35:45.800 --> 35:47.160
I don't want to mess with.

35:47.160 --> 35:52.120
Well, I mean they were, I mean it's cloud storage or whatever, but it's not a lot like

35:52.120 --> 35:57.640
it. I'm not how much storage really is it's going to cost. I'm not going to defend the

35:57.640 --> 36:02.880
high price tag, but I'm going to be like, if they want to charge a couple bucks, then

36:02.880 --> 36:09.200
fine. You know, it is an ongoing service and servers aren't free, but it's a little high

36:09.200 --> 36:10.780
for what you're really getting.

36:10.780 --> 36:16.680
I want to say that like, this is about three times as expensive as Pokemon bank was. I

36:16.680 --> 36:23.560
don't remember, but I know this is several times more expensive than it was before with

36:23.560 --> 36:25.920
not as many features I would imagine.

36:25.920 --> 36:30.920
All right. Well, I don't know. I'll probably still check it out. Oh, sorry. Yes. I'm being

36:30.920 --> 36:31.920
corrected by chat.

36:31.920 --> 36:32.920
1996, not 1998.

36:32.920 --> 36:39.320
Yeah, but I had said the Game Boy dates back to 1990, which it does, but you guys are right.

36:39.320 --> 36:45.160
Pokemon was like, Pokemon was a very late Game Boy game. It was right on the cusp of

36:45.160 --> 36:50.560
the Game Boy color because I remember Pokemon yellow was like a Game Boy color game basically.

36:50.560 --> 36:54.000
Cause I had a Game Boy color that was a little Pikachu. And when you turned it on, you remember

36:54.000 --> 36:58.180
how the power light was red? It was one of Pikachu's cheeks. It was really cute. Anyway,

36:58.180 --> 37:02.760
that's how, that's how Pokemon gets away with it low key. Cause it's cute because you all

37:02.760 --> 37:03.760
suckers.

37:03.760 --> 37:10.040
All right. Uh, speaking of being suckers, uh, I'm a sucker for Pokemon go. I know that

37:10.040 --> 37:14.800
game is a whole lot of fun and Pokemon go road rolled out some big new features this

37:14.800 --> 37:20.380
week, including the go battle league, which means you can, uh, actually start to fight

37:20.380 --> 37:24.360
other trainers and not just like three star friends or more on your list. You can actually

37:24.360 --> 37:30.460
fight randos, uh, and you get some rewards for, uh, winning certain battles and you have

37:30.460 --> 37:35.560
a rank that you can slowly increase and so forth. So, uh, we're in preseason leagues

37:35.560 --> 37:39.040
right now and the great league battles are going on right now. I've been playing it a

37:39.040 --> 37:46.120
little bit. Have you? Um, I did too. I must confess, I hate this feature. I, I hate it.

37:46.120 --> 37:51.440
I don't, but I'm not a big fan of PVP in the Pokemon games. That's never really been it

37:51.440 --> 37:56.920
for me. Uh, and let's be real. The battle in Pokemon go is not what it is in the mainline

37:56.920 --> 38:03.280
Pokemon games. It's very different. Um, and I like it. I'm just from, from that, I like

38:03.280 --> 38:09.480
the raids. I like the PVE. This is another case of I'm totally fine with PVE, but I'm

38:09.480 --> 38:14.700
feeling forced into PVP that I don't want to do. Why am I feeling forced? Because there's

38:14.700 --> 38:21.680
rewards and they're gated behind wins. And some of those rewards happen to be other Pokemon

38:21.680 --> 38:27.020
that are new into the game. So you can only get them right now anyway, through winning

38:27.020 --> 38:32.580
battles in this league. And I hate it to be honest. It's just, they're not that fun

38:32.580 --> 38:37.660
to me. Um, the raids are completely different because you can turn that into a social thing.

38:37.660 --> 38:42.180
I like meeting my ingress friends at the park and taking on a three or four star raid, whatever's

38:42.180 --> 38:47.020
there, maybe a five star, depending on what it is, that is fine. Uh, being forced or feeling

38:47.020 --> 38:52.060
like I'm forced to do PVP to unlock certain Pokemon is not fine. And son of a bitch, I'm

38:52.060 --> 38:57.140
just realizing I never did spin a stop for that fucking quest day that was today. So

38:57.140 --> 39:01.940
I was busy doing other stuff this afternoon. It's another new Pokemon that was only out

39:01.940 --> 39:06.300
between like two and five o'clock today, the day of the super bowl, they decided to do,

39:06.300 --> 39:12.300
um, this brilliant. Yeah, I know. Right. I'm hearing that that Pokemon will be an eggs.

39:12.300 --> 39:16.300
So it's not that it's gone forever, but it's just one of those. Let me just irritating.

39:16.300 --> 39:21.020
But, um, well, at the very least I got my shiny Magikarp today so I can finally have

39:21.020 --> 39:27.240
a red Gyarados. Hmm. Uh, I'm curious too about the, uh, Pokemon community day vote. Cause

39:27.240 --> 39:30.540
that was something that was going on yesterday. There's so much shit that goes on in Pokemon

39:30.540 --> 39:35.820
go now, which is fine. I mean, I do applaud. And even though I hate this battle system,

39:35.820 --> 39:40.260
um, I do applaud that at least it's a pretty major thing that they've added to the game.

39:40.260 --> 39:43.820
So at least Niantic and the developers are continuing to enhance the game and that part's

39:43.820 --> 39:48.220
kind of cool, but, uh, I just like it cause I've steamrolled over everybody. I guess I

39:48.220 --> 39:54.780
did, I won a battle and then I lost too. So I was like, whatever. Uh, SG100 Matt says,

39:54.780 --> 39:58.640
I'm doing the battling for the rewards. I'm kind of with Rob on this. The PVP doesn't

39:58.640 --> 40:03.580
enhance the game for me, especially in its current battle form. And as that says what

40:03.580 --> 40:08.820
I did it and Rob didn't delete the quest. Uh, if you got an extra one of those things,

40:08.820 --> 40:14.660
trade me please. Cause I didn't get one. I'm sure. I'm sure other people I know went and

40:14.660 --> 40:21.380
got like 18 shinies of whatever it was. What was the Pokemon they gave out today? I don't

40:21.380 --> 40:25.380
remember some mousy Pokemon that I didn't end up getting. I was trying to show my 37

40:25.380 --> 40:30.540
Magikarp. Are you near a nest or something? Or did you just unlock so many of them out

40:30.540 --> 40:36.180
here? Like everywhere I go, Magikarp. It's um, because it ties into the Valentine's event,

40:36.180 --> 40:40.900
which is almost over. I think I finally got my shiny, so I'm happy, but whatever. I'm

40:40.900 --> 40:45.260
sorry. I take that back. It's not the Valentine's event. It's the year of the re it's the lunar

40:45.260 --> 40:50.940
new year event. So is it also then the year of the unnecessary stupid fish? Well, you

40:50.940 --> 40:56.700
know how like red is good luck. So what they're doing is they up the spawns of red or red

40:56.700 --> 41:03.060
adjacent Pokemon. Now, even though Magikarp is orange, shiny Magikarp turns into red Gyarados.

41:03.060 --> 41:08.180
So that's why you're seeing more Magikarp is because of the red Gyarados stretch, but

41:08.180 --> 41:11.980
okay, it's a little bit of a stretch, but whatever. I mean, it's better than a ton of

41:11.980 --> 41:15.700
those love discs because what the hell am I going to do with those? I like the events

41:15.700 --> 41:20.980
that shake up the meta of the usual spawns, so I'm not going to complain about all the

41:20.980 --> 41:26.180
Magikarp. The other one I'm seeing a ton of, um, the new, the crab things, the crab, the

41:26.180 --> 41:31.580
core fish, uh, the food Gus, one of the new ones. Yeah. Which I like that fungus turns

41:31.580 --> 41:36.180
into among us. Yeah. Cause there's a fungus among us. Thank you. SSU and Hunter Matt mini

41:36.180 --> 41:41.380
Shino was the special Pokemon today. Thank you. So that's, that's the one that I didn't

41:41.380 --> 41:46.900
bother to get, but just at some point I'll go visit Shane and I know he has like 20 shinies

41:46.900 --> 41:51.380
already. I'm sure. And I would think if they were going to do pretty stuff, I would have

41:51.380 --> 41:57.180
like your special quest one to be a melodic or something. Cause they're so pretty. Oh,

41:57.180 --> 42:02.280
well, uh, there's going to be plenty more, uh, plenty more events coming to Pokemon go

42:02.280 --> 42:06.160
in the future as well. I know they're setting up a legendary pretty soon. What's also interesting

42:06.160 --> 42:11.240
about the battle thing is that you can either just pay coins to unlock more battles, right?

42:11.240 --> 42:17.040
Money, money, money. But the other interesting way to unlock is walking five kilometers.

42:17.040 --> 42:22.400
So if you walk five kilometers, you can also, which isn't that hard to do, especially if

42:22.400 --> 42:25.960
you know, you're following the good guidelines of getting out, walking every day. Uh, and

42:25.960 --> 42:31.340
you have an adventure sync enabled device, which pretty much any Apple phone at this

42:31.340 --> 42:35.760
point has that it's now in Harry Potter and even, yeah. And now Harry Potter woo has it

42:35.760 --> 42:41.040
too. And I've been making use out of that in that game for sure as well. So, um, yeah,

42:41.040 --> 42:45.800
that's great. So anyhow, uh, at least, you know, even if this feature is not my cup of

42:45.800 --> 42:52.000
tea, I am also very happy to hear that they're still developing a lot of shit for Pokemon

42:52.000 --> 42:56.680
go. So that's pretty cool. Uh, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, I also didn't do the event.

42:56.680 --> 43:00.160
My girlfriend traded me a bunch of hers. Well, that was, that was very nice of your girlfriend

43:00.160 --> 43:06.240
to do. All right, well, let's move on. Dark Sakura, less Pokemon, more, uh, horror movies.

43:06.240 --> 43:12.720
I also just realized I had like 18 ratatas. Time to send them to the blender. Uh, the

43:12.720 --> 43:18.280
professor can deal with all this vermin. Anyway. Um, okay. So I have made no secret that I

43:18.280 --> 43:23.600
love the silent Hill movie. I love Christoph Ganz for doing it. I even liked the crappy

43:23.600 --> 43:29.120
sequel. It wasn't great, but it was silent Hill three. And that made me happy at any

43:29.120 --> 43:35.120
rate. Um, there is a quote now from Christoph Ganz, um, where he was talking about his current

43:35.120 --> 43:41.520
projects, um, during a, uh, interview with a French film site called Allocin. And I'm

43:41.520 --> 43:47.360
just going to read the, um, the quote because it brings up more than one thing. I have two

43:47.360 --> 43:53.000
horror film projects with Victor Hadida. I'm working on the adaptation of video game project

43:53.000 --> 43:58.200
zero and which was fatal frame over here. Uh, the film will take place in Japan. I especially

43:58.200 --> 44:02.080
don't want to uproot the game from its Japanese haunted house setting. And we're also working

44:02.080 --> 44:07.400
on a new silent Hill. The project will always be anchored in this atmosphere of a small

44:07.400 --> 44:12.760
American town ravaged by Puritanism. I think it's time to make a new one. One of the other

44:12.760 --> 44:17.680
things that goes on to say is that his favorite silent Hill character though was James Sunderland,

44:17.680 --> 44:23.780
who was the, uh, protagonist of silent Hill two. So maybe we'll get something actually

44:23.780 --> 44:27.960
related to him. That would be kind of cool. Although I really did like the vibe of the

44:27.960 --> 44:32.680
first one with following, um, you know, the themes of motherhood going on through it.

44:32.680 --> 44:39.080
Um, I never noticed too in the first movie that all of the characters were women except

44:39.080 --> 44:44.440
for Sean Bean in the, but he was like, he never went to silent Hill in the first move

44:44.440 --> 44:49.020
in the male characters did. Yeah, exactly. So all of the characters that were in silent

44:49.020 --> 44:54.240
Hill were women. I never noticed that until it was pointed out. I think that some of the

44:54.240 --> 44:58.620
church people might've been, but all of the main characters, I'll have to double check

44:58.620 --> 45:07.200
it. But, um, and the only other male characters that were within silent Hill were, uh, portrayed

45:07.200 --> 45:13.560
as male, like the red pyramid and the janitor. I kind of red pyramid kind of struck me as

45:13.560 --> 45:18.160
a genderless kind of thing though. I mean, maybe I'm just, I don't know. Well, not in

45:18.160 --> 45:23.840
the games. Yeah, I guess that's true. But, but the, the fact that even those two were

45:23.840 --> 45:30.200
played by, by men in that universe, and one of them was supposed to have been the janitor

45:30.200 --> 45:35.380
that affected Alyssa or assaulted, I should've said. And then the other one was of course

45:35.380 --> 45:41.680
the red pyramid. So another thing to throw in there. Uh, as that points out, the little

45:41.680 --> 45:47.760
girl is in dark matter, which rocks. Oh, cool. So, yeah. So, uh, that's cool that we get

45:47.760 --> 45:51.600
the, uh, silent Hill movie that that's going to continue on. And, uh, Chris, Chris off

45:51.600 --> 45:56.140
guns doing that as good because you can do fatal frame weld as well. Yeah. I'd be curious

45:56.140 --> 45:59.300
about a fatal frame. You know, the other thing that kind of strikes me as funky though about

45:59.300 --> 46:02.560
this news. Um, you know, I mean, it's cool that we're getting, you know, more video game

46:02.560 --> 46:07.960
movies of things we're into, but I'm really surprised with how freaking well the Witcher

46:07.960 --> 46:14.200
did on Netflix. Now I know the Witcher was books, but let's be real game. The games help

46:14.200 --> 46:19.000
there are three games. Yeah. So I'm kind of surprised we're not talking TV shows at

46:19.000 --> 46:23.720
this point. Like I'm surprised we're not talking about what video games are Hulu looking at

46:23.720 --> 46:29.640
and Amazon prime and the other, cause we also know that I'm the same company optioned final

46:29.640 --> 46:36.680
fantasy 14 that made the Witcher. So we don't know what they're doing with it yet, but obviously

46:36.680 --> 46:41.520
as a fan of 14, I'm really intrigued. Um, but I'm just surprised in general, we're not

46:41.520 --> 46:47.280
talking about more video games becoming television series. Um, like there's fan wake every other

46:47.280 --> 46:52.240
month about the legend is Zelda becoming a Netflix series of some sort. And I'm kind

46:52.240 --> 46:55.800
of surprised we're not like, you know, with how well again, the Witcher is done. We're

46:55.800 --> 46:59.440
not kind of talking about that or something like, can you imagine if the elder scrolls

46:59.440 --> 47:03.120
became a TV series? I mean, the elder scrolls seems like something that's perfect for that

47:03.120 --> 47:09.360
sort of thing, but maybe it's too much high fantasy. Maybe that would be too much. Like

47:09.440 --> 47:13.520
if, uh, you could just cause the Witcher, it seems like the Witcher is doing very well.

47:13.520 --> 47:18.320
Well, for two reasons, the Witcher is doing very well because number one, Henry Cavill

47:18.320 --> 47:25.360
is nice to look at attractive in that show. Uh, and then number two, uh, the Witcher is

47:25.360 --> 47:30.320
doing well because it's filling a void for many people left by game of Thrones, especially

47:30.320 --> 47:34.880
the subpar last season of game of Thrones. I'm hearing that people are checking out the

47:34.880 --> 47:38.480
Witcher because it's a lot of the same type of like high fantasy that, you know, the game

47:38.480 --> 47:42.480
of Thrones delivered. So yeah, kind of interesting. There's another quote in here that I really

47:42.480 --> 47:46.880
like, cause it's how I feel about the first movie, um, about back to silent Hill that

47:46.880 --> 47:51.920
guns considers it to be a viewed, a beautiful memory. And he had a great sense of satisfaction

47:51.920 --> 47:58.160
when it was released. Fifth dream today says Mandalorian mean means a mass effect show.

47:58.880 --> 48:03.440
Can you imagine a mass effect TV show? I just, I don't want them to do it cause they wouldn't

48:03.440 --> 48:09.040
get it right. I did. I did just finish the Mandalorian. That was a great TV show. That

48:09.040 --> 48:15.600
was like a very well done step aside for just a second about the Mandalorian. I had a lot of

48:15.600 --> 48:20.480
Firefly vibes for it, for it being the space Western and having some of that same little

48:20.480 --> 48:25.200
quirkiness thrown in amongst the seriousness. I really had such a good feeling from that show.

48:25.200 --> 48:29.040
I still haven't watched Mandalorian. I'm like, I'm so uncool girl. Wow. You know,

48:29.040 --> 48:32.880
did you finish the good place? No, I sure haven't. I'm more like halfway through season three. No,

48:32.880 --> 48:37.680
everybody is talking about how, like I w you know, most TV finales, people are like,

48:37.680 --> 48:42.400
Meh, but I have not heard a single bad thing about the good place finale. No spoilers,

48:42.400 --> 48:48.480
no spoilers, but everybody is saying it's perfect that it ended very well. And that there will like

48:48.480 --> 48:53.920
never be another show like it pretty much, pretty much. Yeah. I'm so curious. So, all right.

48:53.920 --> 48:59.360
Anyhow. All right. Well, until then let's move on. So one thing, uh, I know I will not be,

48:59.600 --> 49:02.800
playing or watching the good place on is a brand new switch, right?

49:03.520 --> 49:05.920
Well, you're probably not gonna be watching on the switch anyway. So I don't think they

49:05.920 --> 49:10.560
really have a lot of Hulu. Oh yeah. And I guess Netflix a little bit, but, uh,

49:10.560 --> 49:16.000
Netflix, uh, YouTube and Hulu, they do not have Netflix on the switch. No, that's a,

49:16.000 --> 49:21.120
that's a sore spot right now. Yeah. Really? Yeah. I swear it. Maybe I'm thinking of the Wii U.

49:21.920 --> 49:25.360
You know what? Random, but you know, it was really cool. And I got to give props to this,

49:25.600 --> 49:30.720
cause I was at a hotel, I was at a Hyatt hotel, uh, for work this week. And, um, I brought my

49:30.720 --> 49:35.840
switch dock and my switch to plug into the TV, which was really easy to do because they put

49:35.840 --> 49:39.600
HDMI ports on the side of the TV. Now they realize that people want to plug in their own shits. They

49:39.600 --> 49:45.200
do, but all these TVs they have in the hotel now have Chromecast built in. So I wanted to watch

49:45.200 --> 49:49.680
Star Trek Picard because I hadn't seen that yet. Right? Well, all I had to do, I just went onto

49:49.680 --> 49:54.080
the phone and paired it and then that, uh, my CBS all access, just cause there's, you know,

49:54.080 --> 49:58.000
there's no app on the TV for CBS all access, but there isn't a phone. I was able to just play Star

49:58.000 --> 50:02.880
Trek card on the TV and catch up on what I'd missed, which was awesome. Cool. Yeah. Anyway,

50:02.880 --> 50:07.280
sorry for the random tangent, but I just, it was one of those, I love technology and I love when

50:07.280 --> 50:13.600
the hotels like are actually current on technology. That was a really good feeling. So anyways, um,

50:13.600 --> 50:20.400
apparently they said despite the rumors that there was going to be some sort of fancier pro version

50:20.400 --> 50:28.320
of the switch coming out. Um, they have their latest financial report from Nintendo basically

50:28.320 --> 50:33.760
said, please note, we have no plans to launch a new Nintendo switch model during 2020.

50:35.440 --> 50:40.880
I'm really glad they gave this heads up. Honestly. I just think it's not coming in 2020,

50:40.880 --> 50:46.240
but it'll be 2021. Oh no. Sure. Of course. Of course, Loki. But I'm glad that they kind of

50:46.240 --> 50:51.760
put to bed the talks of, oh boy, now I'm going to have to buy a PlayStation five and a switch pro

50:51.760 --> 50:59.280
this year. I think Nintendo was smart to maybe back off a little bit and instead do the, um,

50:59.280 --> 51:03.680
you know, the, the, the switch in a year where they're not launching new consoles from, from

51:03.680 --> 51:09.920
PlayStation and X-Box. So, um, good. Yeah. And it's, it's not like the current switch is bad

51:09.920 --> 51:14.800
by any means. And some people really love that switch light. So they've got plenty right now.

51:14.880 --> 51:18.320
So they're going to wait a little longer on the switch pro, and I think that's fine.

51:18.320 --> 51:21.840
So, and now I don't have to worry about buying three new consoles this year.

51:21.840 --> 51:24.720
And I wasn't really worried about it anyways, but like, I don't know,

51:25.280 --> 51:31.520
can we fix the analog six on the controllers, please? Uh, fifth dream today says what? No

51:31.520 --> 51:36.480
two screen switch. Damn. I don't, I don't know if the switch is going to go to screen. I just

51:36.480 --> 51:41.200
don't really see that happening. I would, if they wanted to emulate DS or 3DS games,

51:41.200 --> 51:45.600
all you would have to do is tilt the existing switch on its side and have a black line in the

51:45.600 --> 51:51.920
middle. Like if they wanted to do 3DS or regular DS games, they could, uh, hello clubhouse games

51:51.920 --> 51:58.320
returning on switch. Wouldn't that be nice? Um, pod culture believes the switch light is awesomer

51:58.320 --> 52:02.400
and it just, it just depends on your preference. Like if you pretty much only play the switch in

52:02.400 --> 52:06.000
undocked mode, then yeah, the switch light's probably going to be better for you. I prefer

52:06.000 --> 52:11.360
to play in docked mode, but I also realize I'm, there's more people in the other camp than me.

52:11.360 --> 52:14.880
That's how I play. Yeah, I know. I know. It's how a lot of people tell me they play,

52:14.880 --> 52:19.360
but I prefer the dock mode. So, all right, well, let's move on. I was just talking about hotels

52:19.360 --> 52:24.480
a minute ago. Funny enough. Uh, we have a story about, and I'm kind of, this is just not the

52:24.480 --> 52:29.520
business I expected this company to get into, but I guess, um, wherever they can actually make a

52:29.520 --> 52:37.360
dime, they'll do it. It's Atari. Atari is investing in the hotel business. And as much as I would want

52:37.360 --> 52:41.200
to point and laugh, because ha ha Atari has not made a lot of great decisions in the last few

52:41.200 --> 52:47.600
years. And let's be real that VCS is going to be a gigantic flop. Like, sorry, I'm sorry to sound so

52:47.600 --> 52:54.240
rude. Uh, and like, I'm not even giving the thing a chance, but, um, why should I like, there's no

52:54.240 --> 52:58.800
reason to give the Atari VCS a chance. It's, it's likely going to fly. Is anybody buying an Atari

52:58.800 --> 53:04.960
VCS in chat? Anybody? So it's interesting to hear about Atari getting into other industries

53:05.600 --> 53:10.240
based on their nostalgia. I was just talking to friends about this recently and the kind of the

53:10.240 --> 53:15.840
question came up that was like, how is Atari even still around? Like, what has Atari really done?

53:15.840 --> 53:23.200
And I'm like, Atari is still around on the strength of their catalog. It's like that one

53:23.200 --> 53:29.920
hit wonder that wrote a song like 30 years ago that they still play on the radio. Like quick,

53:29.920 --> 53:37.200
can you name the last Simple Minds album? Don't you forget about it. Exactly. You know what?

53:38.400 --> 53:43.440
Simple Minds never has to write another hit because Don't You Forget About Me,

53:43.440 --> 53:47.120
which actually was written for Billy Idol. I don't even think they wrote it. Um,

53:48.080 --> 53:53.200
it, the money they make off that song, you probably retire off it. You know,

53:53.200 --> 53:57.120
when you got a song that big, I'm trying to think of other like gigantic one hit wonders

53:57.120 --> 54:01.040
that still get played on the radio to this day. Well, I mean, there's always take on me,

54:01.040 --> 54:08.080
but Wham was really huge in Europe. You mean, you mean aha. Uh huh. It made it funnier. Don't worry.

54:08.640 --> 54:16.800
Well, I mean, Wham did, did better things when it split up. Yeah, for sure. So anyway,

54:17.120 --> 54:24.960
um, excuse me, uh, Pixel Pacas says, I don't want the VCS. I do want the Intellivision Amico though.

54:24.960 --> 54:29.040
Well, but Intellivision, we all know is doing their own completely different thing. And,

54:29.040 --> 54:32.560
and this ain't about that, but I do agree with you to that extent, Pixel Pacas.

54:34.800 --> 54:42.080
That actually reminded me of one little thing. I did get a new Atari 7800 game. Oh, what's that?

54:42.080 --> 54:47.520
I got a baby Pac-Man. I didn't even know they made that on the 7800. They didn't.

54:48.160 --> 54:53.840
It's a, I think it was either a prototype that someone finished. Gotcha. But I'm just saying,

54:53.840 --> 54:59.520
I have Atari stuff and I have a baby Pac-Man in my house that is not as good as the real thing,

54:59.520 --> 55:04.320
but pretty good. Okay. Sorry. I got in a coughing fit there and Jamie brought that up to help me

55:04.320 --> 55:10.000
out here. So let's go back to talking about Atari. So Atari is getting into the hotel industry since

55:10.000 --> 55:14.080
Atari's strength and the point I was trying to make is that a lot of the money they are

55:14.080 --> 55:19.360
still making is off their back catalog and the strength of, you know, Atari retro. And I love

55:19.360 --> 55:23.280
Atari retro. I have that fricking Atari hoodie that I love so much that actually looks like the

55:23.280 --> 55:27.120
wood paneling. Pretty much it's in every other selfie I've ever taken to myself because I love

55:27.120 --> 55:33.200
that fucking hoodie. Anyhow, Atari is going to try to mix this nostalgia people love about them

55:33.200 --> 55:39.600
and mix it with the hospitality entry industry. So the company has signed a contract that will

55:39.600 --> 55:46.320
have the Atari licensed name and branding in line with a real estate developer who is building

55:46.320 --> 55:52.560
eight hotels in the US. Phoenix will be the home of the first Atari hotel, but there will also be

55:52.560 --> 56:00.560
hotels in Austin, Chicago, Denver, Las Vegas. Does that mean an Atari casino too? Interesting.

56:00.560 --> 56:06.800
That would be rad. That would be rad actually. San Francisco, San Jose and Seattle. So there'll

56:06.800 --> 56:12.160
be some not far from here because San Francisco and San Jose aren't far. Nifty 805 though is like

56:12.160 --> 56:17.120
how I feel about it. I don't want an Atari themed hotel. I need a gamer X. How about a gamer X at

56:17.120 --> 56:23.840
the Atari hotel? Okay, I can deal with that. Okay. See, porque no los dos. Anyway, um, now we should

56:23.840 --> 56:29.440
have a uh, a Chuck E Cheese hotel since, you know, we're throwing nostalgia stuff. Everyone can have

56:29.440 --> 56:36.400
a hotel now. Now what's the Coleco doing nowadays? You get a hotel and you get a hotel. Here's what

56:36.400 --> 56:42.080
might surprise you about. So it's not just a hotel with the Atari logo on it. They are trying

56:42.080 --> 56:47.440
to theme these a little bit. So what are they going to do with the Atari hotels? Esports studios.

56:47.440 --> 56:53.280
We don't know any more than just that, that there will be Esports studios, but I mean, okay, you go

56:53.280 --> 57:00.000
to any hotel. They have ballrooms, meeting room, conference rooms. So branding one of these rooms

57:00.000 --> 57:06.320
as an Esports studio. Okay. It makes sense, right? I'm kind of into it. I'm very curious.

57:07.360 --> 57:13.600
There will also be an Atari gaming playground at every Atari hotel. The playgrounds, we don't know

57:13.600 --> 57:17.520
again what that is besides the name, but speculation is that it could be like lounges for

57:17.520 --> 57:23.360
guests. Maybe it'll have some gaming PCs in there. And then of course, pool, gym, restaurants, bars,

57:23.360 --> 57:30.000
bakeries, movie theaters in every building as well. So kind of interesting. Atari is simply

57:30.000 --> 57:34.960
licensed. They will not have any direct hand in the design of the hotels or what the hotels will

57:34.960 --> 57:44.560
feature. Probably a good thing considering the VCS. Atari will receive 5% of the hotel revenues.

57:44.560 --> 57:51.520
They got an advance of $600,000 for licensing the brand to the developer. That is pretty rad.

57:51.520 --> 57:57.600
So I have to admit, I'm intrigued because it doesn't just sound like a different direction

57:57.600 --> 58:05.600
for Atari. It sounds like a hotel that's being built with a very specific generation in mind,

58:05.600 --> 58:11.840
namely the generation we're pretty much all in. That kind of the blurred line of Gen X and

58:11.840 --> 58:17.600
millennials, right? I've heard it called Zillennials, right? That blended term? Zennials.

58:17.600 --> 58:20.720
Zennials. Thank you. I've heard it called, and I love this name. Have you ever heard it called

58:20.720 --> 58:24.960
the Oregon Trail Generation? Because I've heard it called that, and I think that's perfect.

58:24.960 --> 58:31.680
So the gap between Gen X and millennials is the Oregon Trail Generation. Perfect. So it sounds

58:31.680 --> 58:37.520
like these hotels are kind of like a new thought of how to make a hotel appealing to a different

58:37.520 --> 58:43.680
crowd. And honestly, with the minute you guys said an Atari themed casino, potentially, assuming

58:43.680 --> 58:48.480
they're building one in Vegas, that sounds kind of awesome. I'd visit, wouldn't you guys?

58:49.360 --> 58:54.960
Yeah. Especially, well, especially if they do have, don't sound too excited, especially if they

58:54.960 --> 59:01.520
have the classic gaming stuff. When I go up to Reno, I like to go to Pepper Mill because they

59:01.520 --> 59:04.640
have the- That's always where Dan stays when work takes him to Reno.

59:04.640 --> 59:07.120
Right? Because they have the classic games in the arcade.

59:07.120 --> 59:10.800
And all that pinball. Yeah. It's gotten a little weaker over the years,

59:10.800 --> 59:14.880
but it's still the strongest thing they have in Reno as far as classics go. So imagine if

59:14.880 --> 59:18.800
Atari were to milk that with these classic game spaces, like classic game arcades,

59:18.800 --> 59:22.960
fuck yeah. I'd totally be into that. And that's something that all ages can really enjoy.

59:22.960 --> 59:27.760
So, oh, I think it's cool. Arcade games in all the rooms.

59:27.760 --> 59:32.320
Yeah. Well, maybe. An Atari VCS in every room. Yay.

59:35.280 --> 59:42.640
Okay. Let's see. Sia Tabiri says, my new term learned this week. We are boomers.

59:45.360 --> 59:51.760
People who insist anime was best before 2000. That doesn't necessarily make sense.

59:52.960 --> 59:55.040
Are you a weaboomer, Dark Sakura?

59:57.760 --> 01:00:02.000
Personally, my favorite anime came out before I was born. So I mean,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.080
I'm not the right one to talk about that. I mean, keep in mind, my favorite-

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:09.840
Okay, weaboomer. My favorite anime is Science Ninja

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.800
Team Gatchaman. And you want to know who's responsible for that, right?

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:14.800
Yoshitaka Amano.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:20.000
All right. Well, at least I think you're not alone in loving your Gatchaman.

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:28.640
And DJ Rama S in chat says 1996 to 2010, when anime was the best. Okay, weaboomer. All right.

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:32.640
Come on, though. That was when we had, well, actually a little bit earlier than that,

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:39.040
we had Samurai Troopers, which was Ronin Warriors over here. We had Dragon Ball Z,

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:43.360
if you want to talk about the good stuff, that everyone got into. Ranma we had.

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:50.400
What else? There was also Cowboy Bebop. There was Evangelion. That was really kind of like

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:53.040
the golden age of modern anime. So I'm going to say-

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:59.440
Okay, estrogen100Matt about the Atari Hotel says, I'd check it out, but I would like to see it

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:04.560
built. Projects like this tend to fall apart before a shovel has hit the ground. Disney tried

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:09.920
this similar thing years ago, not a hotel, but game centers. Very, very good point. Let's not

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:13.760
get too ahead of ourselves until they actually put one up. Fall apart before it's even built.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:18.160
That sounds just like the VCS. That sounds just like an Atari thing to happen. But remember,

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:24.320
Atari just licensed out their name, so we'll see what happens. All right. Anyhow, let's move on.

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:27.520
We're going to take a trip down memory lane. I know it's a little earlier in the show than

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:30.400
we usually do it, but Dark Sakura is going to have to leave a little early tonight.

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:33.760
Because my work schedule's garbage. So we're going to get to the classic

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:38.640
game of the week. And we're going to take a trip down memory lane and visit a simpler time

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:43.840
when there were not Atari themed hotels. In fact, you couldn't even bring your Atari to a hotel.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:47.040
It was too complicated to hook up. But if you did bring it to a hotel and get it working,

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:50.720
I mean, props for you. I mean, I did used to sneak my nest to a hotel.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:56.160
I brought a Super Nintendo, I think, once to a convention. But anyway,

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:59.360
it's the classic game of the week. And actually, I think what you picked is a little newer than

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:03.360
that stuff. Because again, you only have to be 10 years old to be a classic game of the week.

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:06.400
Tonight's pick is probably somewhere around, I guess, maybe 15?

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.400
2001.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.480
Okay. Oh, okay. Wow. Almost 20?

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:12.000
Almost 20.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.200
All right. Well, here it is. The classic-

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.480
It's still a surprising one.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:17.120
Yeah. Dark Sakura, what did you pick for the classic game of the week?

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:23.760
I picked Zone of the Enders, which I was trying to think of, like, what was some of the last

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:28.480
good stuff that Konami did, right? And Zone of the Enders was pretty fucking amazing,

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:32.960
I think. It was a really good game. I wasn't any good at it, but hey.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.840
And the thing that I liked about it is I really did sort of like this mecha combat

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:42.480
style that was going on. I mean, I love- What was the game? Cyber Sled? I love Virtual On.

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:46.880
And this is right up there with it, but just a little bit newer of a vibe.

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:57.680
So anyway, it is set in space around Jupiter. And you play as a columnist named Leo Stenbuck.

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:04.720
Who is a survivor of a colony after it was attacked. And you control his mecha,

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.760
which is called an orbital frame called Jehudi. I always mispronounce it because, like I said,

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:16.720
I hardly played the game because I wasn't great at it. But it was supposed to be a more realistic

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:23.840
take on the mecha genre. The mecha was designed by Shinkawa Youji, who did the mecha design for

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:27.920
Metal Gear. So another reason I'm reading this up, it has a lot of ties with the Metal Gear series.

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:37.200
And it was, however, criticized for being a short game with poor localization. But the game in

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:43.760
general was still overly well received. It did come out on March 21st, 2001 in Japan.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:49.760
And then in April in North America and Europe, and it came out on the PlayStation 2.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:56.400
There also was quite another bit that was tied into it. We had a spin-off for Game Boy Advance

01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:03.040
called The Fist of Mars. And then, that's right, that was Game Boy Advance. And the second runner,

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:08.480
which was a sequel for the PlayStation 2. There was, speaking of anime from before, Sunrise,

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:17.440
one of the, I'd say one of the greater animation studios, did two anime that were related to Zone

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:22.640
of the Enders. And then the game was re-released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 along with Zone of

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:29.280
the Enders, the second runner, in October 2018 as a Zone of the Enders HD collection.

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:34.240
Which, by the way, for those watching on Twitch right now, you're seeing footage from the HD

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:39.440
collection. The original did not look this good. Yeah, but it's the same game.

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:47.600
It's the same game. Yeah. So anyway, it is a third person hack and slash game where you are a child

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:54.720
that pilots a mecha and you basically go around to different parts of the space colony that orbits

01:04:54.720 --> 01:05:03.040
Jupiter and attack these rogue mecha, other orbital frames. And you have to minimize damage

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:09.200
around you, use strategic combat. You have ranked, your battles are ranked to see based on how well

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:18.000
you do within your parameters. And then you can go different ways. It's a non-linear path that you

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:27.680
can take. And you also have to find this aura called Metatron Ore to repair your mecha. You've

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:34.400
got your usual type of mecha combat. You have lock-on targeting for things at a distance. You

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:39.520
have an energy sword and a projectile and other sub weapons. And your arsenal will grow the

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:43.760
further you want to make it through the game. And after you beat the game, you get a versus mode

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:51.040
where you can compete against an AI or another character. So frame versus frame.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:58.640
The game was originally under development for the original PlayStation and the PC, but Konami

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:03.360
didn't really want to actually release them on that. They also had prototypes built for

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:08.080
the Dreamcast. They were really focusing on the anime style for the robots,

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:15.520
but adding more realism to it to compare with other sci-fi at the time. And then

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:25.200
they wanted to write it. Actually, the scenario writer, Okamura Noriyaki, wanted to do a serious

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:30.320
story that had complicated lives and it was supposed to examine the purpose and nature of

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:38.560
life. And so they wanted to avoid having multiple endings, although there were different side quests

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:43.200
that could have different endings. And so they also wanted to tell the story through gameplay

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:49.600
instead of cut scenes. So, I mean, the game really, I think, it delivered in the style.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:55.040
It delivered in story. I mean, the localization, again, left some to be desired, but the action

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:59.200
was really good on it. And yeah, I'd be great with a complaint that it probably could have been

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:04.400
a longer game. But, I mean, just look how pretty it is. I mean, this is the HD one again, but even

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:10.560
when the original came out, it was pretty, pretty. Some comments from chat. SDG100Matt says,

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:14.720
I bought this to get the Metal Gear Solid 2 demo and being totally surprised about how awesome

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:20.480
Zone of the Enders was. And Hype Mayhem saying, I remember that a lot of folks bought Zoe,

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:24.240
if only because of the included Metal Gear Solid 2 demo. Well, I hadn't gotten to that yet. Thank

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:30.000
you, chat room. Sorry. So, okay. So yeah, it came with a demo. So there, that part's talked about.

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:38.720
But at any rate, it may, for Metacritic, it had an average score of 78 out of 100.

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:45.200
And they thought the biggest praise it got was because of the use of the cinematography in the

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:55.680
game with camera following the mecha. And GamePro actually preferred it to Armored Core 2 because

01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:01.520
it was responsive and quick and that the design was highly detailed. But yeah, most of the people

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:07.440
were just like, it was too short. And they thought that the voice acting was emotionless.

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:12.960
And being really, some people reported just being really annoyed by the voice acting in it,

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:21.360
that there were people from whiny to dead. Which I mean, voice, early video game voice acting,

01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:25.040
I think was a little bit hit or miss. But then again, we also had just gotten off of

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:30.560
having really amazing voice acting. Like, you know, again, we came out of Metal Gear,

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:38.400
for example, another, you know, relating back to that. But yes, it did have the Metal Gear Solid 2

01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:49.760
Sons of Liberty demo, which probably drove most of the sales of this game. But it was, you know,

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:56.960
really, really just a fun little game. And like I said, we had sequels, we had other related series

01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:03.120
and a full animation series that went right along with it. So there you go. Zone of the Enders is

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:08.160
our game. Not bad for a game most people bought just to check out the demo for another game. But

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:13.360
that happens sometimes. I seem to remember, what was it? The Final Fantasy 7 demo was with?

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:23.120
Oh, it was that fighting game. No, it was done by, no, that was the final, was it Final Fantasy?

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:25.840
Maybe I'm thinking Final Fantasy 8 was with Brave Fencer Musashi.

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:28.080
I remember getting Brave Fencer Musashi.

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:31.120
And, but there was another demo that came out.

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.960
Toeball number one. Thank you.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:33.360
Yeah.

01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:36.320
Okay. That's a series that should continue on.

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:40.400
Toeball number two was pretty fun too, but it only came out in Japan.

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:45.200
All right. Well, there it is. Zone of the Enders, the classic game of the week. And I think

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:47.040
Dara Sakura might be having a go. I don't know.

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.480
I could do my last story.

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:49.360
You want to do your last story?

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:49.920
No, why not?

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.440
Do you want to do it now?

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:52.400
Yeah, I'll do it now.

01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.800
Okay. So let me skip ahead here. So go ahead and do your last story.

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:59.920
Sorry about that. Well, it's a really quick thing anyway. You know how in the other Animal

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:05.280
Crossings we could cheat with different memory cards and other systems and whatnot. You can

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:14.800
have one island per switch. Even if you have other game cartridges, save files, you have

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:16.400
one island per switch.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:20.880
Oh, so if multiple people play on that switch, it'll be kind of like the GameCube one where

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:24.240
you could have like four people on your memory card type of thing.

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:25.520
Exactly. And that's it.

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:28.240
All right. I'm still looking forward to the game.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:32.320
Oh, totally. Well, honestly, I'm kind of pleased for that because I'm tired of people,

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:36.720
you know, cheating and getting something in one place versus the other. So whatever.

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:41.440
It's okay. Nintendo's just saying, oh, you want some more islands? Well,

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:44.400
we've got some brand new things we'd like to show you.

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:47.280
Check it out in our new Tom Nook DLC corner.

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:52.400
Hey, we've got so many different switches. Did you try the switch light? It's pretty nice.

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:57.200
I want them to do an Animal Crossing switch light. I'm not going to spoil on other things

01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:01.600
that might be talked about later on, but I really want a switch light so that I can have

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:04.640
something that doesn't have detachable parts to take in my bag.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:08.480
Fair enough. All right. All right. Well, thank you, Dark Sakura. Have a great night.

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:11.600
Sorry about the work schedule and we'll see you next week.

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.120
You didn't give me the crap schedule.

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:16.240
I didn't do it. All right. We'll see you next week.

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:19.360
Meanwhile, let's move on over to Loki. What do you have for us?

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:23.600
This is pretty incredible. So you may know that flash is

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:28.480
there basically any support for flash December 31st of this year?

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:30.880
Yes. My Google Chrome browser tells me that.

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:35.520
I know all the time. I was like, dude, fuck off. When I check my calendar,

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:38.160
it's not December 31st. So you can fuck right off, you know.

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:45.520
So in the meantime, though, to prepare us for the world without flash

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:54.400
comes Flashpoint is basically archiving thousands of old classic flash games

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:59.920
that you may have enjoyed. And you can check this all out for free.

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:04.000
And the these are all downloadable and playable on your computer.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.760
So includes, you know, stuff from, you know, many sites like Miniclip.

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:15.200
It is a very large. What the hell?

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:20.400
It's a very large car horn is not. It's not coming from your computer.

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:24.800
No, it's not my computer. It's a very large. Did the diners fucking win?

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.040
Because if they won, that's all we're going to hear all night horns.

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:34.000
Yeah. Riots and shit. Anyways, very large archive.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.320
Oh, no. Tiger class says the Chiefs won. Thank God.

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:46.160
Sorry. Not sorry. Like if y'all could behave when your team wins a game, then I wouldn't care.

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:49.840
But people don't know how to fucking behave. So apparently we have a Chiefs fan across the street.

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:55.600
Wonderful. Anyways, so you can download the archive. They have several different

01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:59.520
things like different sets of games that are in here.

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:03.520
The whole archive itself is like two hundred ninety gigabytes, which is quite large.

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:08.160
But you don't have to download everything. You can actually still because you could

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.880
most hard drives they sell now are like three terabytes.

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:14.960
All right, right, right. You could fit decades. I'm not I'm not saying that it's impossible to

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:19.360
store that much data on your system. I mean, it's very possible. I'm just thinking that's

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:22.720
a good third of your bandwidth cap right there. You know, if you think about it.

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:31.840
Um, so, yes, if if for whatever reason, you know, of these 36000 games that are included in here,

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:36.000
your favorite game is not among them. You can actually suggest that they archive

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:42.480
other games as well and they will go ahead and do that. But yeah, it is very large.

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:45.920
They have a master game list that's in here and everything.

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:55.360
Popcap. Yeah, it's just I don't even know what half of these what is half of this of like

01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:00.800
pencil kids dot com. It's it's very clearly a bunch of sites you probably never checked out ever.

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:07.840
Do they have a wasn't a don't shit your pants a flash game? I don't know. It may have been.

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:12.960
I know that one of my they had they had a trailer, though, that was like showing off some of the

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:16.560
games that were in there, like some of the stick fight games they had. I think

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:25.520
one of the original versions of Superhot was a flash game. But yeah, lots of really classic

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:31.200
stuff. I knew I knew someone would ask. So I have to answer this. Pod culture and chat says

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:39.120
flappy vog flappy vog, you know, is available at vog network dot com. Mr. Black Wolf built that in

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:44.160
unity. So I do not believe it uses flash. I don't know. No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't. It's like

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:48.720
oh, yeah, it's HTML five. So you'll be happy to be part of the arc. You'll be happy to know that

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:56.480
don't shit your pants is part of the archive. One of my all time favorite flash games. Yes.

01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:02.880
It's the reason why I love that game so much is this it's the sound it makes when you

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:10.320
are just just the whole ending sequence of the game when you do, in fact,

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:14.640
shit your pants. It's that little like instead of a sad trombone, it makes us a little like

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:25.200
but yes, there's too many games for me to even go into, but definitely go check it out. We're

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:33.680
going to read the name of all 30 games right now. Starting with it's going to be a whole lot of

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.840
monkey go happy games because they have a ton of them. Fifth dream today and chat says they're

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:49.200
also archiving flash animations. So oh my God, we forever. Oh, good. Does that weren't strong,

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:54.160
bad emails and flash? Yes. Then I hope to God somebody is preserving those.

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:57.920
I would think that. Hey, you're back. A lot of people have been going back and redoing

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:05.120
things in HTML 5. Oh, good. Important update. Thank you. All right. Let's see. Other comments

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:11.120
in chat. Let's see. There are unique in the games, though. They're part of this.

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:19.200
So maybe some of the older Unity games. They have like some Terry Cavanaugh games.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:26.960
I don't know. Oh, yeah. Would the original suit like hexagon super hexagon be a flash game?

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:32.240
I don't know. This seems to be organized in a sort of manner. So they've got like it's snow

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:38.320
drift, red sky radio silence are the three games in this list for Terry Cavanaugh, CB2. I guess

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:44.320
he's a lot of this old stuff. Well, and let's be real. Probably the flash game you are most

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:49.680
concerned about is Frog Fractions. Like, I mean, as much as I hype up other flash games,

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:55.200
Frog Fractions really probably is the all time greatest flash game. So you might wonder like

01:16:55.200 --> 01:17:01.440
what what happens to Frog Fractions when Google Chrome and the other browsers no longer run flash?

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:08.240
Well, the good news is Frog Fractions, the game of the decade edition will has appeared on steam.

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:15.920
It will have a mid to late 2020 release. So no idea when that will actually happen. And

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:22.800
maybe you forgot what Frog Fractions is. Great. Even better. Even better. Just just play. Go in

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:27.680
blind. I saw him play the second one yet. Yeah. Apparently the second one is like one of those.

01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:32.800
The sequel never as funny as the original. But I'm here like people are like, it was OK,

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:40.400
but it just like it in the second one, you kind of you know, to expect the randomness

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:45.520
of what Frog Fractions is in the first game, you weren't expecting you were expecting just

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:49.680
to do fractions. Well, I mean, you kind of think, OK, this is going to take a disturbing turn.

01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:54.240
And then like, what the fuck? Like, you know, the first game has a lot of those moments

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:58.480
where it's like, what the fuck? And like, you know, it's kind of like, oh, you expect those

01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:04.080
in the second game. So I should make my kids play that game. You should be. That would be funny.

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:09.920
The film anyway. So that's very good to hear that Frog Fractions will be making a return on steam.

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:14.720
And honestly, I'll probably buy it because I'm a consumer whore. I am a whore for Frog Fractions.

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:19.040
Ain't that the truth? Hell, yes. The Flash game for Fast Five is part of this as well.

01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:22.960
Is it really in The Simpsons? All those terrible movie tie in games

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:29.280
are probably part of it. Drunken wrestlers. This is this is a Twitch stream in the making,

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:32.880
going through and playing some of the old Flash games. Candy Mountain Massacre Revenge.

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:38.320
Wait, is that based on the YouTube Candy Mountain? Charlie, you gotta go to Candy Mountain. No,

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:42.000
they have the finale, though. They're starting to put the finale out. Have you watched any of that

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.040
yet? I, I did not even know in the year of Our Lord 2020 that Candy Mountain was still a fucking

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:53.120
thing. Yes, it is. They had a Kickstarter a long time ago and they finally just started

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:58.080
to put out the finale and the first episode was super long. It had nothing. It has anyone

01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:03.840
out there watched beyond the first one that, you know, I've watched all of them and I've watched

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:13.200
Charlie Tech Unicron, which is hilarious. OK, I am a big fan. Do you make the kids watch it?

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:18.240
I did make the kids watch it. Did they like it? I did not make them watch all of the llamas

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:23.520
with hats. Some of it because it started to get a little violent, but they thought it was funny.

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:29.440
Right. Let's move on. We're going to travel around and check out some quick news from around the

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:36.560
globe. All right. So let's talk a little bit about what we're going to be getting for. Well,

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:43.120
not exactly free, free, free and free with our mandatory subscriptions. Subscriptions are

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:49.280
mandatory. Please enjoy this free game. So for games with gold, uh, we get, uh,

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:58.160
let's see, it looks like TT Isle of Man. And if he's, if you get to see some TTs in the island,

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:08.320
it is a motorcycle racing game. Oh, joy. And Call of Cthulhu on Xbox 360 compatible games,

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:13.840
Fable Heroes. Oh, cool. Um, I don't know if that's cool because it looks terrible.

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:19.840
A Fable Heroes in Star Wars Battlefront, the old one. Oh, um, so those are going to be coming

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:25.760
in February. OK. In the PlayStation side of things, we are going to be getting, um,

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:30.800
Bioshock the collection. Okay. That's really rad. Pretty awesome. Uh, you know, just, you know,

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:38.800
a lot of people, a lot of speculation that this is coming out as a free in quotes game. Um, because

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:44.160
there's a, the new Bioshock will be one of the big reveals at PlayStation fives reveal.

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:49.680
I hope so. The infinite was great. I mean, all of them have been pretty, I think the only one

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:55.040
I haven't played through is two. I played through one infinite. Two was different because Ken Levine

01:20:55.040 --> 01:21:01.600
wasn't directly involved with two, but like I played and I didn't do the DLC on all that stuff

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:06.000
as well. But, um, I don't know. I don't think you need to, it's not really the full, you know,

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.760
the full game. I hope the news about Bioshock making a return on the next generation is true

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:14.320
though, which by the way, real quickly, just aside with PlayStation five and reveals and all that,

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:18.960
there was a fake tweet going around this last week from an account that looked like it was

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:22.640
the official PlayStation account, but it wasn't. If you check the spelling it's wrong and there's

01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:27.840
no check Mark on the account. And it was trying to say, uh, PlayStation five unveiled February

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:34.000
15th at the theater and knew the PlayStation theater knew that was a false tweet. So if you

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:39.760
retweeted that going OMG or whatever, congrats, you fell for a misinformation campaign. Uh, granted,

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:44.160
it was probably somebody in their basement just acting like a fool or somebody trying to impress

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:49.440
their friends by going viral with a lie. Um, but unfortunately there's a lot of that type of

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:54.400
bullshit on Twitter. So please, please, please be careful. Uh, when you retweet things, if

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:59.040
something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. If you're only reading about it on Twitter

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:03.360
and nowhere else. I mean, it depends, it depends what we're talking about. If we're talking about

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:08.960
people on the ground at a scene somewhere where something is unfolding, then maybe, but even in

01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:12.560
those cases, you always have some jackass that isn't really there. That's trying to put their

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:18.400
own thing into it. So just, you know, be careful and, uh, don't be the one that spreads around

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:23.600
misinformation. Anyway, I said, cause I saw a lot of that retweeted with OMG and I'm like,

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:31.040
y'all Twitter security one Oh one, come on. All right. Um, the Sims four is the other game that

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:38.960
would be getting in a PlayStation VR firewall, um, zero hour. So check those out. I don't think I

01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:43.440
have the collection. I have the collection on PC. So I'll be, I, yeah, I definitely don't have it

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:48.240
on PS four. I have both those games. I think at one point they gave out Bioshock and Bioshock

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:53.280
infinite on PS three, but you can go way back to PlayStation plus back then. I think they gave

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:57.920
those games away before, but we haven't seen the, uh, you know, uh, remaster good. It's worth

01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:02.800
going through. I haven't, you know, I haven't played those in a while. Infinite was super great.

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:10.400
Yeah. Um, and then also we have a speaking of nostalgic and flash, um, the behemoth, uh, they

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:15.920
talked about what their next project is going to be, which is alien hominid invasion. So it's going

01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:21.680
to be an all new re-imagining of the, the first game that the studio put out. And of course you

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:27.840
may remember them not only from alien hominid, but of course castle crashers. So we'll have to

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:33.520
see what this is going to be. It says it's going to be a co-op arcade shooter, similar to metal

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:39.120
slug, but I mean, hominid was pretty fun and castle crashers is fun. So this is probably

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:44.160
going to be fun. Can't wait. Yeah. Looking forward to it. Um, mentioned earlier in the show by dark

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:48.800
Sakura, uh, kind of referenced here, there is a new animal crossing switch coming out. She's just

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:54.240
a little irritated. It's not a switch light. It is a regular switch with the dock, but, uh, if that's

01:23:54.240 --> 01:24:00.560
what you're looking for, it's fucking cute. Uh, like I, I'm, I cannot justify spending $300 cause

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:04.000
something's fucking cute, but if I didn't have a switch yet, this would probably be the one I'm

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.160
getting. Uh, it's coming out on March 13th and it's going to have very cute green and blue.

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:12.480
They're kind of like the, the colors of the ocean a little bit. So that kind of like softer green

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:18.160
and blue. Uh, those are the colors. It's, it's not an ingress switch, uh, is that different,

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:21.920
different types of green and blues, uh, that are showing up. But I think it's really cute.

01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:27.120
Uh, and there'll be actually be a dock that actually has, um, uh, little, uh, Tom Nook and,

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:32.160
and his, uh, kids on it. And then like the switch itself on the back is really adorable.

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:36.480
And yeah, honestly, if I didn't have a switch yet, or like I'm finally breaking down and getting a

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:42.480
switch because of Animal Crossing, like this would be the way to go unless you really want

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:47.680
a light for your situation. Then unfortunately nothing has been announced for you yet. And I kind

01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:52.880
of feel like with this news, they're not going to announce a light. Um, anything's possible,

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:59.920
I suppose, but doesn't look bloody likely. So anyhow, also in other news, uh, we, we have a

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:06.320
story about, uh, Ninja's management firm, um, which, uh, is, um, trying to figure out what

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:17.840
the name of it is here. Um, anyway, the firm that he is with is trying to reach out more into

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:22.720
diversity. Um, which I think is, is a good thing to talk about. You know, we've talked a lot about

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:30.400
these streamers that have moved from Twitch to YouTube or Twitch to Mixer. And, you know,

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:35.440
we got a lot of white dudes in there, which, you know, there's a lot of cool white. I'd like to

01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:40.720
think Loki and I are pretty cool white dudes, but you know what? I know some pretty cool women. I

01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:45.600
know some pretty cool people of color and all these people do streaming as well. And it would

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:51.520
just be nice to maybe see, you know, some folks in the big leagues that are a little bit more

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:57.040
reflective of what the population of the entire world looks like and not just one part of it.

01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:02.240
Um, one very small part of it. So, um, yeah, I think this is very good that, you know,

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:07.840
they're trying to push to get more, uh, folks, you know, signed with this and pushing forward

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:13.200
with trying to bring a little more diversity, uh, into the streaming world, which is, uh, great.

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:19.760
Um, so, uh, let's see, I'm trying to see where the action is here. Uh, Loaded is the name of

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:25.200
the company. Thank you. Um, and, uh, they represent 36 gaming content creators.

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:29.920
Five of them are women. Uh, and they're saying we're actively seeking to diversify our portfolio

01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:33.520
of talent, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it's also what's best for the

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:38.000
business and industry. Those who are in a position to, to should be thinking about this and doing

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.080
what they can to more accurately represent diversity within their ranks and content

01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:45.680
in order to accelerate this leaders in our industry need to support women and other minority

01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:49.360
groups to create a more inviting and supportive landscape for everyone. It's something Loaded

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:53.760
will be intentional about. And I look forward to playing a big role in our strategy there.

01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:59.760
So, um, best of luck. And I, I hope we hear about some more names, uh, from all types of

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:04.720
individuals. So let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. Let's start in the

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:10.480
U S Loki. All right. We've got, I mean, I guess this is tying in with the, the new show, but the

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:16.480
dark crystal age of resistance tactics. So, you know, they just screen that while I was out of

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:21.920
town for work, uh, Alan went to the crest and saw like a screening, I guess there it's in movie

01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:26.720
theaters for a hot minute too. So yeah, I thought it was pretty cool. Uh, that's coming out on PC,

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:32.640
Mac, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one. We have zombie army for dead war. That's on

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:41.520
PC PlayStation four and Xbox one and a grand blue fantasy versus on PlayStation four marooners on

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:48.000
Nintendo switch and crash drive two on Nintendo switch. That is it. All right.

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:52.400
Let's go to Japan and check out some of the releases coming out there. And now that we're

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:57.120
getting into February, if you can believe it, uh, getting into February's releases in Japan,

01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:03.200
uh, I don't think there's a ton of stuff. Uh, in fact, this week, I think we just have

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:07.600
some peripherals coming out, some stickers and things. I don't see any games, at least on the

01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:11.920
switch. I know there's a new Hatsune Miku game coming out, um, next week, but we'll talk about

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:16.320
that next week. Uh, in the meantime, let me see if there's anything on PlayStation four

01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:21.280
that is on its way. Oh yes. We have a little bit more on the PlayStation four grand blue

01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:27.920
fantasy versus is out this week. A game called, is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon

01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:32.640
infinite combat? I feel like we had a similarly named game before and it was an anime based thing.

01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:38.320
Well, yeah, I mean, I can tell you right. That's that question shall be answered this

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:42.720
week in Japanese releases. Is it wrong to try to pick up girls into dungeon? Uh, grand blue

01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:49.280
fantasy versus also out on the PlayStation four this week and ease nine, apparently a new pressing

01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:52.960
of that. Cause I think that game has been out, but I guess a new version of it and also a rugby game,

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:59.280
rugby 20, uh, meaning for 2020, I'm sure also out in Japan this week. Um, how about the UK?

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:06.480
All right. UK don't have a whole lot coming out. Uh, mainly just, uh, monster energy supercross

01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:15.200
three on PlayStation. We have a X-Box switch and PC, uh, zombie army for dead war on X-Box

01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:27.040
one and PlayStation four and that's it. All right. Um, let's move on to the email bag.

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:32.160
Every week you guys send us emails, participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send

01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:36.480
those emails and we read some of our favorites here on air. So you should send us an email for

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:41.600
a future week. Participate at orange lounge radio.com and we're going to get to our,

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:46.720
I think this is the one and only email we have this week. Yeah. So our email tonight is from Rob.

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:50.480
I like your name. Uh, I don't recognize the email, so I don't think this is the Rob,

01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:56.080
but, but, uh, and this is only Rob with one B like me. So I don't think it's just, it's just,

01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:01.200
it's just plain Rob like me, one B. Uh, so I believe this is a new emailer, although I could

01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:05.920
be wrong. So I apologize if you've emailed before. Um, but usually dark soccer does this. So I will

01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:11.120
just say I'm new here. Anyway, we have a pretty lengthy email, so let's get to it. Dear OLR.

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:16.800
I recently re-watched the legendary documentary King of Kong and it really made an impact on me.

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:20.720
For those who have not seen it, King of Kong is the story of an underdog, Steve Weeby,

01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:25.280
trying to beat the donkey Kong arcade world record of Billy Mitchell. Uh, I know I've seen it and

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:29.760
I assume you've seen it as well. I have not. Oh, you haven't. Okay. Well, I I've seen, I don't

01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:34.320
need to watch it. I, I understand. Uh, moving on. The interesting thing about watching this

01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:39.440
documentary again was that since I had first watched it in 2007, video analysis has proved

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:43.760
that Billy Mitchell had actually illegally submitted his score using an emulator play

01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:48.160
through, which prompted twin galaxies to remove all of his records from their database.

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:52.560
His good friend, Todd Rogers held hundreds of records and also had his records removed after

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:57.440
analysis proved that his scores were not even possible. Billy's other friends, Steve Sanders,

01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:03.040
openly admitted to cheating in donkey Kong in the eighties. Were they friends? I don't know.

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:09.120
I mean, I guess they would all be part of this interesting fraternity of like dudes who scored

01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:17.120
high in video games, but like, did they send each other Christmas cards? Like how I feel like friends

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:22.000
can be a very bad though. Like who lies about video game achievements? I mean, I kind of think

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.760
that's where the rest of this email is going. Let me finish it up. After processing all of this,

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:29.360
it started to paint a picture in my head of what actually happened in the eighties when video

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:34.480
arcade records were starting to be recorded. To me, it seems like it was a tight knit group of

01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:39.840
record holders and Walter Day who protected each other, probably knowing full well that the scores

01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:44.720
were not legit. They knew that by exposing the false high scores would, excuse me, they knew

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:48.800
that exposing the false high scores would compromise the integrity of twin galaxies

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:53.760
and their tight knit community. Hell, it even questioned if their small town of Otumwa was

01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:57.840
actually the video game capital of the world, whatever that means. Makes you wonder how many

01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:02.800
people were cheated out of the glory of a high score back in the day. Just curious if you thought

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:08.240
this was a widespread issue within twin galaxies or just a few bad apples. Were you disappointed

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:12.960
knowing one of the greatest video game legends turned out to be a shame? Would love to hear your

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:21.120
thoughts. And that is from Rob. So, is Fifth Dream today suggesting this is Mr. Awesome?

01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:28.000
Is this Mr. Awesome secretly sending this email? This really does sound like a Mr. Awesome, right?

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.480
This goes, okay, the reason why they keep bringing back up Mr. Awesome is that goes back to when this

01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:37.600
program was on All Games Radio and the kind of flagship show over there, All Games Interact,

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:42.000
because I remember I drove down to the studio. I was in LA once when they were doing All Games

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.680
Interactive and Scott Rubin. And it was one of those Mr. Awesome episodes because he was showing

01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:49.840
up all the time. And I was like, Oh my God, what the fuck have I walked in? Like, it's like, it was

01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:54.000
like, it was like a fucking soap opera, all this twin galaxy stuff. I don't even remember the

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:59.760
details. I just remember the catch phrases, like, you know, let me finish because I let you finish

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:04.800
all that stuff. And just, it was crazy. Anyway, what do you think about this whole issues and

01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:09.520
twin galaxies and so forth? I'm over it already. In fact, I wouldn't even say I'm over it because

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:20.000
I never was even interested in it. So I'm very still an interested in it. It's just drama in

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:25.120
like shit I don't even care about. Like the only time I ever cared about like world records was

01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:29.760
when I did that stupid, um, ready player one competition, which that was a whole bunch of

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:34.960
bullshit anyways. It was like simple, simple shit. Oh, Hey, by the way, break a world record now.

01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:40.400
Okay. Fuck you. How about that? Um, I don't know. I just, I don't care.

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:47.360
My answer to this is kind of complicated. I just think twin galaxies is a relic of a different

01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:53.520
time is what it really is. Like twin galaxies is what existed in the eighties. Cause one thing,

01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:58.080
okay. There's cause one little thing that like with your email where I'm kind of like,

01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:02.560
eh, I think there's kind of like a jump that's happening here is the part that talks about,

01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:06.560
uh, Billy Mitchell illegally submitted his score using an emulator playthrough,

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:09.920
which prompted twin galaxies to remove all of his records from their database.

01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:13.200
They didn't have emulators in the eighties. I don't think you could emulate donkey Kong

01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:20.720
accurately on a PC until the late nineties. When did maim start late nineties? My point is,

01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:24.960
and I'm not like, I'm not discounting your points and some of this other crap that came out and I'm

01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:30.000
well aware of the many conspiracy theories and all this stuff and the videos and all this stuff.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:37.040
Here's what it is. Do I think these guys are very good at video games from the 1980s? I do.

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:40.880
Are they better than me? Yes, they are. Are they the best in the world?

01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:49.600
They're the best that this person, Walter Day, who put together this organization that nobody

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:55.680
else was willing to do in the 1980s and run things his way, just whether you liked it or

01:34:55.680 --> 01:35:00.640
not in this whole thing, you know, the videotapes and all that stuff, this was what he was able to

01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:07.120
collaborate. And to his credit for better or for worse, they were the first to try to make video

01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:13.680
games a bit video gamers, shall we say a bit of a celebrity. It's because of things like

01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:22.160
twin galaxies that we, um, later on ended up, um, uh, you know, getting the, the magazine spreads

01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:27.040
and things like this of these guys who were very good at video games. Were they the best in the

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:32.480
world? Hard to say. They're the best that were able to be found through this process. They probably

01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:36.960
weren't the best in the world. They were, cause you know, there's always somebody better, right?

01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:40.560
But they were the best that was able to be found through this process. My point is,

01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:46.720
look at where we're at now in the year 2020. Lots of people can become video game celebrities

01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:52.880
because it's so easy to just start your own channel on Twitch or make a YouTube thing or,

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:57.840
uh, do something else. Right. And so now it's like more people were finding these

01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:02.960
awesome gamers all over because it's so much easier to kind of start your own thing.

01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:07.360
And of course with the technology and everything, now we get more exposed to things like emulators

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:13.600
and some of these other things where people cheat. So are maybe some of these people cheating because

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:18.880
they want to hold on to some sense of relevancy. It's almost like a midlife crisis.

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:25.280
Like these guys were what, 18, 20 years old in the eighties. So how old are they now?

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:29.760
They're at like fifties and something like that. And maybe are there some that are willing to go

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:37.040
to a length that is somewhat questionable to maintain some sense of relevancy in an era

01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:42.640
that is making the video game celebrity culture of the 1980s and maybe early nineties irrelevant

01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:50.160
today, perhaps. But are they all cheating on purpose? I don't know. Hard to say. I haven't,

01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:57.760
I'm not gonna, and respectfully, I'm not going to waste my time on five hour YouTubes that dissect

01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:02.800
these, you know, did Billy Mitchell play on a rogue machine and submit a score that way?

01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:07.200
I don't fucking know, to be honest. Um, the reality is we know there's a better Donkey Kong

01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:11.120
player. Right. And it was, and it wasn't either of these guys. It was that dentist or no guy.

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:14.560
It's even gone fucking back and forth, right? There was the dentist. I don't know. And I don't

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:19.600
care. I've already like so lost interest in it, but now that we're in the year 2020 or even the

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:25.760
late 2010s, if we're talking about just the recent past couple of years, the, the easeability of,

01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:30.080
of filming your own thing and putting it out there, you don't necessarily need something

01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:35.440
like twin galaxies to be a warehouse of all these records that go through a strategic screening.

01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:38.800
Cause you can just make your own, put it on YouTube and say, here's my score. Here's my

01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:44.160
receipts. Bam. I don't need Walter blessings or Walter Day's blessing in order to claim that as

01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:50.400
my score where in the 1980s you did. So I just, my long winded answer here is to kind of say,

01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:56.240
like, I just think the culture has changed so much that we don't need a Pope to bless

01:37:56.240 --> 01:38:02.320
these high scores anymore. That twin galaxies in that form is not really relevant anymore.

01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:06.320
And that's why we talk about these Oh two more jokes and things where it's like,

01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:13.280
they're trying to hold onto that relevancy, but it's, it's unfortunately technology and where

01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:18.400
we've gone. It's just not the same. Now I'm not going to talk about twin galaxies as an

01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:22.640
organization because a, I don't really know what they're doing these days, but I would hope they've

01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:26.320
kind of maybe transformed. I think they were running like a media network, a channel at some

01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:31.760
point, maybe celebrating classic gaming and cool. That's what it should be at this point is, you

01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:35.360
know what, we're going to celebrate classic gaming. We're going to still party like it's

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:39.840
1985 and that these are, you know, the big games, the moment and so forth. But the reality is the

01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:44.240
culture and the celebrity and all that shit has changed as far as Billy Mitchell cheating and all

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:51.280
that. My only counter question, because this is the thought that comes to mind. Does, does he know

01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:57.040
maybe he's cheating in every circuit? Like here's the thing I've played a lot of Pac-Man machines

01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:01.440
over time. I couldn't tell you which ones were running on an emulator potentially,

01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:05.920
or which ones were tweaked behind the scenes to possibly produce a different score.

01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:11.440
If he was playing machine at a different place, is it possible that he just didn't know the machine?

01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:14.480
I don't know. And I know there's a lot of Billy Mitchell haters out there that would say, yes,

01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:19.200
he knew it was all a scam and all this stuff. Maybe, I don't know, but I just also kind of

01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:25.760
think maybe he wasn't in on it. I mean, he was good at Donkey Kong. He's played the game live

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:30.480
for people before and so forth. Is he the best in the world? I guess that's debatable at this

01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:36.080
point. Is he better than me and most people? Probably. Definitely. So here's another thing

01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:41.200
about Billy Mitchell you may not be aware of. I met the guy. I met the guy a couple of times.

01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:45.120
I don't expect that he knows me or recognizes me by name or anything, but it's not about that. I'm

01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:49.040
not big on celebrity culture anyway, but I've met the guy a couple of times and I'm going to tell

01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:55.600
you something. He's a pretty nice guy and nothing like what you see in the YouTubes and the movies

01:39:55.600 --> 01:40:01.040
and all this stuff. Billy Mitchell that you guys all see is playing a character. He's playing a

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:07.120
part. Just recently Paris Hilton came out and said, yes, I was playing a part that whole time

01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:10.160
during A Simple Life. I knew exactly what was going on and where I stood. And there's some

01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:13.600
people that say, yeah, right. And there's other people that say, I knew it the whole fucking time

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:18.160
and I'm one of those people. I knew it. Paris Hilton's fucking smart. I know. I said it,

01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:21.280
quote it, put it on the back of the box. Paris Hilton's fucking smart. She knew what she was

01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:25.200
doing to that whole time making money and so forth. Sometimes you're playing a character

01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:28.720
and it's one of those things where like, you know what? Even the negative coverage,

01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:32.320
it's still coverage. It's getting you talked about. It's selling hot sauce,

01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:39.520
you know, or whatever it is, right? So, but like I've been around when Billy's having one-on-one

01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:44.400
conversations. He's had one-on-one conversations with me and this might shock you. He's just a

01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:50.800
normal fucking person. He's just a normal person like you, like me. I'm a normal fucking person too,

01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:57.760
really. I am. So, people only put these guys up on pedestals because I don't know. So,

01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:01.920
and I'm not, I'm not talking bad about Billy Mitchell. I'm actually not. I'm actually telling

01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:10.320
you guys, he's a nice guy, but I also don't get into all these weeds and all this stuff about,

01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:15.600
you know, all this, all this. So, I don't know. Those are my long thoughts. I'll check chat.

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:19.520
Loki, you have any thoughts on this? No, still not interested in what, you know,

01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:26.960
I get it. You're good at playing the game. Good for you. Yeah, that's it. I mean,

01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:31.920
at some point you're not going to be the best and then you just have to get used to it.

01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:36.000
Let's see some comments in chat. Fifth dream today says, I'm friends with people who have

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:42.240
been in movies and in bands. Everyone is just people. That's very true. Retro DeLorean in

01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:46.800
chat says, is there an equivalent of Billy Mitchell for pinball machines? I don't know

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:50.400
if you're the person who sent these emails, but we actually did get a follow-up and I just fucking

01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:53.840
closed it because I'm a genius, but essentially that was the question. The follow-up was for Dark

01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:57.280
Sakura, who I'm sorry, she's left the building. So, I can't ask her directly. I'll have to ask

01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:01.360
her for next week, but is there an equivalent of that in the pinball world? And my answer is,

01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:07.120
I don't think so. I don't know anyone with that kind of personality, but they haven't really done

01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:13.600
movies of pinball besides like Tommy, but that's very different. So, I don't think that exists,

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:17.120
but there are certainly are world record holders, I'm sure in pinball as well.

01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:24.640
And I would say a lot of, just after OLR last week, we hosted some people playing a theater

01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:30.880
or magic machine out in the pinball world. So, everything I said about the culture has changed

01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:35.120
and you can broadcast your own high scores. You don't need to go through a central hub or

01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:40.000
anything to do that anymore, would be true about pinball as well. So, if there is a celebrity,

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.240
I would say just hearing Dark Sakura, when she talks about like the pinballs in classic games,

01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:48.080
I would say the pinball makers are the more celebrities in that world because she talks

01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:52.720
about certain machines by certain people and that's what she plays. So, I think the celebrity

01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:58.080
has probably went to them. Tiger Claw on chat says, how do you make movies about pinball

01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:03.200
interesting? Dude, the same way somebody made King of Kong, is Donkey Kong that interesting

01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:13.120
for two hours? No, but it was the drama, the good guy versus the bad guy. It was all that shit that

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:17.360
made people get into that movie at the level they did. It was a very well done documentary.

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:23.600
There's another one and god damn it, I can't remember the name. I don't think it was Chasing

01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:29.680
Ghosts, maybe it was, but there was another one, god damn it. It was a very obscure arcade game,

01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:34.560
the two were playing and the guy was supposed to like mimic the performer. They were always going

01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:39.520
against each other at like magfest. I remember like one of the early magfests was the climax of

01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:44.320
the film. It was like an early magfest towards the, it was a snake game that they were playing

01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:49.920
and I think the name of the movie had something to do with snakes. Anyway, that was another one

01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:54.880
that I'd watched. That was it, yes, Dark Tetsuya, that's right, Man vs Snake, that was the name of it,

01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:59.280
which I know it doesn't sound like a video game movie. It sounds like something a little

01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:03.360
perverted, but it was, it was very much, yes, Nibbler, that was it. Thank you, Dark Tetsuya,

01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:06.720
that was the documentary I'm thinking of. That was an interesting one as well.

01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:14.240
Other comments in chat, let's see, SG100Matt says, the documentary was good, it did take some

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:19.760
liberties with the drama. It made it seem like Billy dodged Weebie when he really didn't.

01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:23.280
Fifth Dream Today says, I've heard Billy intentionally acts like a jerk whenever

01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:27.280
a camera's on him but is otherwise an okay guy. True.

01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:35.200
Questbuster says, back then you had to have some, you had to have a trusted someone as a witness,

01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:41.280
VHS tapes, photographers, and then check a monthly magazine for local scores, if even that, lots of

01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:45.600
holes for anything to happen back in those days. Oh, and Retro DeLorean does say in chat, I submitted

01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:51.920
this question and I can assure you I am not Mr. Awesome. All right, all right, well, you better

01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:56.800
not be. All right, no, I'm just kidding. So, but thank you for the email. I mean, it is, it's an

01:44:56.800 --> 01:45:01.600
interesting topic and I see why people get into it. And I think the documentary has really like

01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:06.160
perpetuated that a lot, but I think the reality is it's like, you know, the standards of tracking

01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:11.280
video game scores and video game accomplishments in the 1980s was just different than it is today.

01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:16.480
And look at the celebrity culture around gaming today. It's not necessarily about high scores.

01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:20.480
Is Ninja good at Fortnite? Well, he is kind of good at Fortnite actually, from what I understand,

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:25.440
he plays a lot of it, right? But is he the best in the world at Fortnite? I don't think he is.

01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:29.840
Some of the best streamers out there and, you know, the people that are the celebrities now

01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:37.360
aren't necessarily the people that are great at video games. So, you know, anyway. All right,

01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:40.720
great question though. Thank you very much for that. And that was our only email this week.

01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:46.000
If you would like to send us an email for a future week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:49.680
We do have some more stories for you guys before we get to opening up Discord to see if there's

01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:54.560
any calls tonight, even though I know tonight is a little weird with all that's going on on

01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:59.920
the television and so forth. Although I guess that did wrap up. But I think more and more people

01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:04.160
are tuning in now that that's over. But, you know, I understand some people are like Bobby

01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:07.920
Blackwolf didn't do a show tonight because he went to a party and it's the one time a year he

01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:13.120
gets to see certain people. I get it. So, yes, I may not be into the Super Bowl, but I understand

01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:17.120
it's a cultural thing for some people. All right. But we have some stories. Let's get into it.

01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:21.440
Yes. So we talked this has been a while since we talked about this, but you may remember there was

01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:29.680
a company in Japan that was operating a Mario Kart type go kart experience. We were dressed

01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:36.640
up in costume and drive go karts around Japan. Oh, yeah, I do remember that. Well, is formerly

01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:43.920
known as Mar Marikar. They got in trouble with Nintendo before Nintendo said, stop doing that.

01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:50.240
And then they basically say, hey, we're unrelated to Nintendo. But then they went ahead and did it

01:46:50.240 --> 01:47:02.240
again as now Mario Mobile Mobility is the company mobility. And cleverly now they have Nintendo has

01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:10.720
been awarded a total of four or 50 million yen in response to this, basically saying that Nintendo

01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:15.920
said it would continue to take steps against violations of intellectual property and brands

01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:22.320
and has worked hard to establish over many years. I mean, kind of had to come in. They already got

01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:28.080
warning saying, hey, you can't do this. Stop it. You cease this. And they're like, we're going to

01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:33.120
do it anyways. And they're like, OK, well, you're just going to get sued then. So, well, you know

01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:39.920
why now, especially to. Where are you going to where do you get to play official Mario Kart

01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:47.120
simulations in the very new future starting? Yes. And in Japan at Universal theme parks. Yeah. So

01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:51.680
it's the Universal theme park expansion, I'm sure is it. This is probably one of those things where

01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:57.280
Universal's tapping Nintendo on the shoulder saying, hey, yeah, I doubt I doubt I had anything

01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:04.000
to do with universal. It's more of just like, hey, you know, you guys are you're kind of borrowing

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:09.200
our former property, you know, and we've already asked you this stuff. In fact, they said that they

01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:18.080
were originally awarded 10 million yen, but they apparently they tried to appeal it. So as part of

01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:27.040
that appeal, they increased the damages to 50 million. So that's hilarious. Well, so if Nintendo

01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:31.680
says to stop, you probably should stop. Yeah, because here's here's what the site said. So

01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:39.360
mobility, they said we have street carts and this is horribly broken English. We had street carts

01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:46.800
is providing our service as usual. Street carts is fully comply, as I see through local governing

01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:51.120
laws in Japan. Street carts is in no way a reflection of Nintendo, the game Mario Kart.

01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:57.360
We do not provide rental of Mario costumes. Oh, people are showing up in Mario costumes,

01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:00.080
probably taking pictures and stuff. I don't know about that, but probably,

01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:08.720
I mean, just for the pictures before, you know. Yeah, I don't know. I thought they had a thing

01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:12.480
like this in the States, too, like there was something in L.A. or something that was kind of

01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:18.240
like this. Well, and then, you know what? So we we we are not far because by your laser tag place,

01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:23.440
there is a go kart place. Yes. And I've only done that one time ever. But the one time I did it,

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:28.960
I was like, this is like Mario Kart in real life. But without the show, I haven't been there since

01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:34.480
the because the original place that was there, what they were gas powered go karts when I

01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:38.240
originally went there. So you had to like when you were racing them, you had to put on the full

01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:43.520
helmet. You had to put on a jumpsuit. Was it not like that? They're electric now. Oh, and so

01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:48.240
they're they're quieter. They don't smell like fuel. Oh, yeah. That whole place smelled like

01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:54.320
gasoline. Yeah. No, not anymore. It's all electric. So and they before it used to be

01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:58.560
split up in the two different tracks, they like a really short track and a longer track. Now it's

01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:03.840
all one huge track. Oh, and so it's way different now. But I just haven't gotten to do it because

01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:08.000
it's expensive. I think we need to do something for our we need it. Oh, our team building night.

01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:12.720
We should totally do that. You know, I've been doing lately, though. I've been going

01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:18.480
rollerblading. Oh, really? We went to the rink twice. Is the rink that's in between all this?

01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:23.600
No, no, no, not that Rika. Sunrise Rollerland. But OK, you know, because my kids got skates now

01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:28.800
and they have this new thing where which is kind of cool. So you can sign them up for like it's

01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:33.920
like four dollars a kid and then they'll send you coupons each week for two free skiing sessions

01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:41.440
every week forever. So it's like it pays for itself already. Interesting. But yeah, I enjoy

01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:47.200
it now that I've got my nice skates. All right. Well, moving on to another story about when

01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:51.440
Nintendo tells you to stop, you should probably stop. We have other news this week that a

01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:55.920
California man is getting in a lot of trouble with Nintendo and for some other pretty big

01:50:55.920 --> 01:51:02.160
reasons as well. This guy's resident of Palmdale's name is Ryan Hernandez. He pleaded guilty to

01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:07.680
federal charges of hacking Nintendo systems, which is computer fraud and abuse and possessing child

01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:14.000
pornography, which is definitely the worst thing that he did. But being that we're reading stories

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:19.920
from game blogs, these game blogs tend to focus on the video game part of the story. But you but

01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:25.680
anyway, the video game part of the story is that he phished Nintendo employees to get credentials

01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:30.400
in 2016 and used that to get confidential information, which was then leaked to the public.

01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:35.760
Details about the Nintendo switch even leaked before March 2017 when it was actually debuted.

01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:42.400
This all according to court records. Now, the FBI caught him and he said he would stop. But what

01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:51.280
happened? He pulled the Mari car. Oops. I did it again. He got in and the FBI seized the devices in

01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:57.840
June 2019. He broke into multiple servers, got information, bragged about it on his Discord and

01:51:57.840 --> 01:52:03.200
Twitter while leaking other data elsewhere. He also shared vulnerabilities in Nintendo's network

01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:08.160
with the community. Big yikes to all that. But if you ever wondered where some of these leaks come

01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:14.560
from, realize that not all of it is my uncle works for such and such place. The phishing and all this

01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:22.320
shit, that stuff's very real. That's phishing. You know how like in the news, they always talk about

01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:29.200
Hillary's emails, butter emails. Well, the hacking of the DNC, which to be fair was a little bit

01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:32.800
different than the Hillary emails issue, but this all kind of got looped in together about email

01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:38.800
issues, right? So the hacking of the DNC, that was phishing. That was phishing. How did Russia

01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:42.560
get in and get those emails? And I'm not trying to like get into politics or pick a side. I'm just

01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:47.840
stating this is what happened. So Russia sent a phishing email to somebody that worked at the DNC

01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:50.800
who clicked on it, fell for it, gave the credentials, and that's how they got in and got

01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:55.920
the emails. Okay. Nonpolitical Sony pictures. When all that information got hacked. Remember

01:52:55.920 --> 01:53:00.960
all those emails from Sony pictures? When Carrillo was pissed off about that movie that portrayed

01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:04.960
Ken John Moon in a negative light, and then they hacked Sony pictures and got all that shit on the

01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:10.640
internet. Yeah. Yeah. That was a phishing email as well. So like a lot of places of business in

01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:16.560
this day and age really train their employees. Yeah. They keep sending us fake phishing emails

01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:20.720
all the time. And if you accidentally click on it, then they're like, you got to watch another

01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:25.200
training video. It's like, ah, yep. So just something to think about when you looked at

01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:29.760
leaked information, it may not have always come from the cleanest of sources. So just,

01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:34.560
just saying is what it is. Anyhow. So this plea bargain, he will be sentenced to three

01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:40.320
years in prison, $259,000 in restitution to Nintendo, and will be registered as a sex

01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:49.040
offender. He will be sentenced on April 21st. But the, it would be, I guess even I don't,

01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:53.520
so he took a plea bargain of three years, even though the child pornography can carry up to 20

01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:58.640
years for that whole thing. So I don't know the ins and outs of all that. I'm going to admit,

01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:04.080
but he is going to prison because he said he would stop doing it and he kept doing it anyway.

01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:08.640
And then, you know, you also have this whole hideous issue of the child pornography as well,

01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:14.800
which I don't want to, you know, overlook that as why this individual went to prison. So anyway,

01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:20.480
so anyway, gross, ugly. I want to move on from that, but I did kind of want to make the point,

01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:24.320
you know, what's, and, you know, we talk about leaks and stuff here too. Granted,

01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:27.760
we talk about it when it's already on Twitter and all those other places. I mean,

01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:32.480
we're not going to be idiots and pretend, oh, this doesn't exist. But sometimes we have to

01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:39.360
remember these leaks and things, they don't always come from a squeaky clean source. So anyway,

01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:42.800
something to think about. Meanwhile, let's move on. We have a couple more stories for you guys.

01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:48.720
Loki. All right. I don't know why you would want to do this to yourself, but you can.

01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:56.160
So apparently someone made a fan, untitled Goose desktop app that basically is called

01:54:56.160 --> 01:55:03.280
Goose desktop. And it's kind of a play on entitled Goose game, obviously. So what it does

01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:10.160
is it will actually unleash a goose onto your desktop, which will then do all sorts of things,

01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:20.560
including, you know, steal your mouse cursor. It will even like pop windows open. I don't know why

01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:27.600
you would want to do this to yourself, but. But yeah, you can have like, it'll try to steal your

01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:33.920
screens. That seems the type of thing you prank your coworker with on their computer, honk.

01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:40.560
It is, yes. So yes, if you're interested in checking it out, though, it is on itch.io. And

01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:48.720
yeah, I don't know if I would want to do this to myself. I just think. I think I would just

01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:52.400
drive myself nuts. It would drive me a little nuts, too. It's one of those things. It's kind

01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:57.200
of funny, though. Yeah, it's funny. Fifth dream today in chat says, I miss Windows 95 desktop

01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:01.840
buddies. Quest Buster says, this reminds me, we need Indiana Jones desktop adventures back.

01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:07.280
You know, would y'all be mad if we made After Dark, the classic game of the week, some week?

01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:11.600
It's not really a game, but After Dark is kind of iconic. Y'all know what After Dark is? Do you

01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:16.800
know what you know? After dark screensavers, screensavers, iconic flying toasters. Yes,

01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:22.080
that was a screensaver. That was After Dark. So, and sometimes the screensavers were things that

01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:26.320
were like fucking with your desktop. Like there was like desktop shuffle that would just shuffle

01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:35.120
the pieces of your desktop in a like slide puzzle type of fashion. So yeah, I'm looking at the

01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:42.400
little video, whatever. So it just, it drags stuff onto your screen and tracks mud all over the place

01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:48.640
and all of your stuff. It causes like weird key presses and stuff to happen. I should put that on

01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:53.680
Alan's computer when he's not here, Teehee. That would be funny. Yeah, for a minute and then I'd

01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:59.360
get in a lot of trouble. Yes. Goose desktop, though. You can check that out. Samperson.itch.io

01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:03.760
slash desktop dash goose. Install it on your grandparents' computer for a good time.

01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:11.280
All right. I did not tell you to do that. All right. It's free. Free. Love that price.

01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:16.320
All right. Moving on. A few more stories for you guys before we open up Discord calls.

01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:20.640
And this one kind of ending on a sad note with this story. Well, I don't know if it's sad,

01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:26.640
it's just a sign of the times. Nintendo of Japan is soon going to stop repairing the Wii. So the

01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:33.040
Wii will no longer officially be supported. The Wii, of course, was released towards the end of 2006

01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:38.960
and the Wii still was kind of going for a little bit. Just Dance 2020 came out on the Wii after

01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:44.720
the Wii U and all that. Yes, yes. But all good things must come to an end. On their official

01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:49.520
website, Nintendo of Japan said they plan to terminate all the opportunities to officially

01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:54.000
repair the Wii. This means that Nintendo of America, Nintendo of Europe, and everybody else

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:58.880
is going to follow suit very soon. Why are they doing this? Due to the, quote, difficulty of

01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:04.800
securing the parts necessary for repair. So the last date to get your Wii to Nintendo of Japan,

01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:12.640
if you need a repair on it, is March 31st, 2020. And that's it. So the end of an era. So the Wii

01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:17.200
will no longer be fixed and if yours breaks, then it is just a broken piece of garbage.

01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:25.680
Plastic waste. Are you sad to see the Wii get retired? You know, I had my Wii in the garage

01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:31.760
and then when my sister had watched our cat while we were in Disneyland, she took it.

01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:38.320
The only thing that kind of makes me sad about this is that, you know, there's so much on the

01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:42.880
Nintendo eShop that was on the Wii and then therefore the Wii U, because the Wii U was fully

01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:47.440
backwards compatible with the Wii, we know that. And I guess you could still, they haven't

01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:52.640
terminated support for the Wii U yet, but we kind of know that's coming, right? But my point is that

01:58:52.640 --> 01:58:57.520
there were a lot of cute games on the Wii Shop, like let's say the Castlevania Adventure Rebirth,

01:58:57.520 --> 01:59:04.400
right? That didn't come out anywhere else but the Wii Shop. Final Fantasy IV, the After Years.

01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:09.600
I do believe that came out in its 3D form in other places, but I think the only place to play that in

01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:16.320
2D is on the WiiWare. And PC or PSP, I think, also had a... Oh, you're right. You're right. But it

01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:22.800
was also different. It was the upgraded textures, not the original sprites that the Wii version

01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:26.960
used, like the original Final Fantasy IV sprites and everything. Yeah. So good point though,

01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:31.440
that the PSP had it. But my point is, it's just a matter of time before these cute little things

01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:34.080
that were on the WiiWare service, you're not really going to be able to play them anymore

01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:38.080
because the systems can't handle them. And it's not like you can download these on the Switch or

01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:42.160
anything like that. Alan, if you want to give me candy, just come over and hand it to me.

01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:44.240
I want to see gold things fly across the screen.

01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:48.400
I'm not going to catch it. If you throw that... What is that little piece of candy

01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:52.640
that you're offering me? What is it? Offer me candy. Oh, this looks... Is this a peanut

01:59:52.640 --> 01:59:57.440
butter cup? Fuck yeah. Do you want one, Loki? No. Oh, they're good. Dark Sakura brought... Ooh,

01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:00.800
three peanut butters. Dark Sakura brought cookies, if you want one of those cookies.

02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:04.080
Alan, do you want to say... I mean, we're ending a little early here. Do you want to say anything

02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:10.720
about your gaming or the things that you've been playing lately? I updated Overwatch.

02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:19.040
I updated Overwatch. It's on season 20. I know... I just... This isn't my first time on camera.

02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:25.360
I updated Overwatch. They're on season 20 now. I think the last time I played was season eight

02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:29.520
or nine. So it's been quite a while. There's only one new character that's been introduced,

02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:38.960
Sigma, since I played. As far as what competitive mode is like, the players, the attitudes, the

02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:46.240
slurs in chat, it's still bad. It's terrible. So this may be a shortly lived revisit.

02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:48.240
How do you feel about Overwatch 2?

02:00:55.360 --> 02:01:03.120
It exists. It will exist. It's a thing that Blizzard announced. I feel similar to... There's,

02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:07.120
I guess, a big football game that happened. I know that's a thing. A lot of people are

02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:12.160
invested in it. I'm happy for them. Or sad, depending on who they rooted for.

02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:17.920
I feel similar about Overwatch 2. It is... It's a property. Blizzard's...

02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:21.520
What about Warcraft 3 reforged?

02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:28.400
Yeah. Well, I did not have any... I had no idea of all the stuff that went on with Warcraft 3

02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:32.880
reforged. All that news went right over my head. So when you told me that they turned off Battle

02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:41.120
Net for the original OG Warcraft 3, Blizzard, they don't know what they're doing. Or they do,

02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:48.240
and they're terrible. Toons is the driving cat is apparently running things over there right now.

02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:51.840
By the way, Alan, just because you are on camera, how much weight have you lost?

02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:58.720
You've lost a lot of weight. In the last 12 months, I've lost about 30 pounds.

02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:04.800
Congratulations. I'm not jealous or anything. So no, Alan's been doing the CrossFit thing and the

02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:10.880
meal prep. I got him an Instapot for Christmas and he uses it for meal prep. And you would

02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:15.040
think I would benefit from some of that weight loss stuff, but no, because I can't stop snacking.

02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:19.920
So there you go. You get some congratulations from our chat, by the way. So there you go.

02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:23.920
All right. Enjoy those peanut butter cups. You earned it. All right. Anything else we

02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:27.360
want to say about the Wii or any of that stuff? Let me see. I'm going to go see.

02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:28.800
It was a great system.

02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:30.880
It was. And it said...

02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:36.160
Where's my freaking Excite Truck sequel? Aside from Excite Bots, we don't count that.

02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:41.360
vognetwork.com slash discord. If you want to get in our discord and give us a call,

02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:44.240
or if you have a quick question, you can always post something in chat as well.

02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:47.520
If you are like, I don't feel like calling, you can always pose a question here in chat.

02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:51.360
If you'd like to talk about something else. I don't know if we have any last minute stories.

02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:54.880
There was just something I saw on my Twitter feed. I was trying to look up is basically

02:02:54.880 --> 02:03:00.080
something from Google saying that Stadia, they're complaining. People are complaining.

02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:05.280
There's not enough games on Stadia. And they're like, it's not our fault that we're not announcing

02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:08.800
games. If you want game announcements, you're going to talk to publishers to

02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:15.280
announce games that are coming to Stadia. Um, Google, I would encourage you to look at

02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:20.880
a product called the Wii U and why it flopped. And, uh, you might want to come up with a better

02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:25.440
answer. Yeah. Cause they said we understand the desire to hear more specifics on games.

02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:31.920
After all, that is what it is about games. Of course, not all 120 titles will be announced

02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:37.600
by the Stadia team as we leave it up to publishers to make announcements about their IP slash games

02:03:37.600 --> 02:03:42.880
and which platforms they'll appear on just as we do with our exclusive content coming to Stadia.

02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:47.600
There are lots of reasons for time of those gaming or timing of those game announcements.

02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:52.480
Anything from plan, promotions, events, title readiness, proximity to the first playable demo,

02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:54.720
shareholder requirements, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:03:56.080 --> 02:03:59.840
By the way, I'm glad you brought this up because you reminded me, Oh, it's February. Now I need

02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:04.960
to go, go grab the newest Stadia games. Cause again, I didn't buy Stadia, but, um, my pal

02:04:04.960 --> 02:04:08.960
Bobby Black Wolf did, and he got a little friend pass thing and he was kind enough to give that

02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:12.720
to me, which I think works for like three months. Um, so I think this is the month where it will

02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:19.760
run out. Uh, but I was able to claim February's free games. I forgot that it's a new, so I got,

02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:24.320
and I, I didn't even know what games there were. So the games I got were Metro Exodus.

02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:30.640
That's cool. And, uh, guilt G Y L T, which I think that was their exclusive they had at launch.

02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:35.520
Right. I think it was. Yeah. I'm pretty sure that was there. Yeah. Cause it didn't launch until

02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:41.680
November 19th, 2019 and it's by tequila works, which I think was one of Google's, uh, in-house

02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:46.240
things. So yeah. Thank you. Pixel pockets. Yes. That was the exclusive game. I thought so.

02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:49.760
So I'll have to check that out at some point. All right. We do have a call waiting in the green

02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:54.320
room. So why not? Uh, let's get to it and, uh, see what our listeners want to talk about. So

02:04:54.320 --> 02:05:00.160
hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hi. Can you hear me? Hi. Yep. We can hear you.

02:05:00.160 --> 02:05:06.640
What's your name? Oh, cool. This is retro. Hi there. Uh, what's on your mind tonight?

02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:11.600
Hey, uh, yeah. So I was the one that asked the question about, uh,

02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:15.680
the Billy Mitchell. That's why I just wanted to assure people that I am not Mr. Awesome.

02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:20.720
Yeah. Am I crazy or did I pick up a, am I crazy or did I pick up a Canadian accent there?

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:26.240
Uh, yes, I am from Canada actually. So you're definitely not Mr. Awesome.

02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:32.400
No, I am not Mr. Awesome. Um, but yeah, I wanted to just set the record straight about,

02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:37.280
um, the reason I was kind of interested with that was, um, it was not so much even the drama. I just

02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:42.880
thought, uh, I thought that that kind of whole segment of the internet that was talking about

02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:48.480
all that was really centered around all of this kind of culture that seems to be kind of coming

02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:53.760
forward. Like more recently, it seems like with the, all these one-up cabinets and all the retro

02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:59.680
gaming aspects of it, I just thought it was kind of a neat topic that's coming forward now about

02:05:59.680 --> 02:06:05.600
like the legacy of all these players. And, um, so I, yeah, I just want to, I was wanted to kind of

02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:10.080
hear your thoughts about that just cause I thought since you were, you've talked a lot about retro

02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:15.120
gaming and, and Jamie talks about the pinball and all that, that, uh, just that you might kind of,

02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:21.840
you know, have an interesting perspective on that. Um, well, I hope, I hope you were good with the

02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:26.000
perspective that I gave. Um, I think, I think, you know, but at the end of the day, it really is kind

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:31.760
of about celebrity culture has really shifted. And I do think some of the good old boys from

02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:37.120
back in the day have probably really fought to remain relevant and they may or may not,

02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:41.200
I don't know, cause I don't live in their houses and inspect their machines. They may or may not

02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:45.360
have done some shady things to try to stay relevant. But the reality is, and I think,

02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:50.160
I think the best point that I made was probably towards the end there. When you look at the cult

02:06:50.160 --> 02:06:55.200
of video game celebrity today is that it's not necessarily the people who are the best

02:06:55.200 --> 02:07:00.560
at video games that are the most famous because of it. Not to say that good gamers don't necessarily

02:07:00.560 --> 02:07:04.800
get. So, I mean, when you think about like awesome games done quick and an event like that, like,

02:07:04.800 --> 02:07:09.200
you know, those guys are in the spotlight now, granted I couldn't, can you name some speed

02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:15.280
streamers that were with awesome games done quick recently? Yeah, it's, I don't know. I don't recall

02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:20.240
their names as fast as you do Billy Mitchell. I do recognize there's talent. I only know like some

02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:26.000
of the, um, Mario maker streamers because I watched a lot more of those like Carl Sagan,

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:32.480
um, Poop Grand Pooh Bear. Um, I remember the rest of them, but like, I know some of them by name

02:07:32.480 --> 02:07:40.880
just because I've seen a lot of their videos outside of GDQ, but, um, yeah, I don't remember

02:07:40.880 --> 02:07:47.520
a lot of them, but if I followed it more, which I'm bad about doing, um, then yes, it might be

02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:52.640
something I would. Yeah. But the point is, is that, you know, you have a lot of really,

02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:56.400
really great game players that participate in those types of charity events and so forth. And

02:07:56.400 --> 02:08:01.040
it's just, it's just different now because you know, in the, in back in the day, we didn't get

02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:06.000
our news instantly from Twitch and the internet and so forth. You had your gaming magazine. So

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:10.960
a part of the gaming magazine was trying to build up this cult of gaming celebrities and the

02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:15.680
squeakiest wheel who is doing it the most efficiently was Walter Day and the organization

02:08:15.680 --> 02:08:20.800
behind Twin Galaxies. And, you know, I don't think that should necessarily be discounted, but, um,

02:08:20.800 --> 02:08:25.520
you know, was it really accurately measuring who really was the best in the whole world?

02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:29.680
Probably not as well as we can look at that sort of things today, because it's much easier for

02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:35.120
anybody to be able to broadcast, but you know, it existed. It was a thing. Maybe gaming wouldn't be

02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:41.280
in the same place it was today without it. But the reality is if you don't evolve, you will fade

02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:46.000
away. And so if Twin Galaxies hasn't really evolved and honestly, I haven't really kept up

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:51.760
with them, but I think, I think they are more like a celebration of, of classic games and kind of

02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:55.920
like a classic gaming corner. I think last I checked in on them, it was that type of thing.

02:08:55.920 --> 02:09:00.320
Um, you know, or even take us here at Orange Launch Radio, we've been doing this show

02:09:00.320 --> 02:09:05.760
way too fucking long. Like we're coming up on 18 years of this program and we've only been on

02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:11.840
Twitch for maybe the past year. And in retrospect, we should have done it way fucking sooner.

02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:18.800
Well, we did though. And this, this is the other problem. Sometimes you evolve too soon and you

02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:24.000
don't really see the benefits of it because, uh, we were on Justin TV for a short time, but then

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:27.600
it was like, this doesn't seem to be at, nobody's really into this. What are we doing? Whatever.

02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:32.320
We're going to get rid of it. And so we went back to the Google stadia. Yeah, we did. We did. And

02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:36.080
we were, you know, on shout cast for many years and, you know, it's continued to do the podcast

02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:40.720
and all that, but now that we're on Twitch and so forth, I think we've been able to expand our

02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:44.400
audience a little bit within the last year. And now I'm kind of kicking myself going, we should

02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:50.560
have fucking done this three years ago, you know, but it, it didn't work out, but you know, we

02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:54.720
evolved too. I'm not trying to compare ourselves to twin galaxies, but I guess I just did.

02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:03.920
Anyway. So I've been talking an awful lot. Um, so what, let me ask, let me ask about your thoughts

02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:10.080
on this whole thing. So you recently saw the documentary. What's your take on this culture?

02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:15.600
Do you think that these guys have been lying to try to stay relevant or what's your take on all

02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:22.560
this? Well, I think, yeah, one really important part is that, you know, Billy Mitchell, his brand

02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:26.320
is, you know, part of his brand was, you know, that he was the record holder and, you know,

02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:32.800
he sells hot sauce, uh, for a living. So I think a big part of that, you know, part of his livelihood,

02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:38.720
I think was centered around that. And, and, uh, there was, I had also mentioned in the chat,

02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:44.480
there was that also kind of the other side, uh, um, it came, I think it also came out in 2007 was

02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:49.360
chasing ghosts. So I thought it was a really interesting juxtaposition of the two kind of

02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:53.760
positions of one guy trying to like break into that and all the stuff he ran into. And then

02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:58.880
the other one seemed to be just more of a documentary on their lives. And, you know,

02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:04.720
a lot of what came out of it was for me, at least was that you had all this urban legend growing up,

02:11:04.720 --> 02:11:09.280
like you heard about Billy Mitchell because the internet never really, really knew what that

02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:15.440
meant. And, you know, so to hear the whole story now, um, I don't know, I just, I think it just

02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:21.280
kind of made him seem more human and just like all of us. And that's why it kind of, that kind

02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:26.000
of dawned on me that all these guys were just, you know, they had their egos that, you know,

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:30.880
cause they were amazing back then, a lot of them, and then just the, you know, the thought that you

02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:36.720
could hold onto that record forever. I think it was, it's interesting. Cause I think back then

02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:40.560
you could, you know, or you could, at least it'd be really hard, but with the internet,

02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:46.560
you're always competing against someone. Um, like for instance, I was looking at the super Mario,

02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:51.920
uh, like the original Mario, uh, speed record and every, it seems like every week or every

02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:58.640
day they shave off point of a second or whatever that is. And it's just unachievable. So I just

02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:04.640
think it's a crazy cross section of culture of this idea of trying to be the best. And maybe

02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:10.480
it's just not, you know, maybe it's not as glorious as it once was in the eighties because

02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:15.280
now you're literally talking about people that are going to be taking six months of their lives

02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:19.120
to just try to shave off these few millisecond to be at a world record.

02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:24.320
No, very good point. Um, you know, and I'm, I'm kind of also thinking about, you know,

02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:27.840
somewhat of the culture of the eighties and sometimes, sometimes kind of like,

02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:32.560
it takes a little bit of luck as well to sometimes be the one that's picked to be famous. And what I

02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:36.560
mean by that is like, if I were to use like an equivalent from the eighties, since we're talking

02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:40.000
about, you know, the twin galaxies and, you know, when all these records were going on,

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:44.160
let's talk about like when MTV kind of first came out and started making all these musicians famous,

02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:49.360
let's take somebody like Madonna. Madonna was like the queen of MTV for a long time and some

02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:55.040
would argue still is, but Madonna, let's be real. Madonna is not the best singer, right?

02:12:55.040 --> 02:13:00.000
But Madonna kind of knows how to play up the cameras and Madonna is kind of a great performer

02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:04.400
and Madonna knew how to play that role, especially in the eighties. I'm not really commenting on her

02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:09.600
now. You know, she'd been around forever, but Madonna in the eighties was great at being a

02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:14.640
celebrity. So in some ways, Billy Mitchell in a way embodies a lot of that as well.

02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:18.960
Billy Mitchell may not be the best, but Billy Mitchell embodied being a celebrity and kind of

02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:24.960
continues to do that in a way very well. Although as many people would say, Madonna kind of peaked

02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:29.040
a few years ago and it's been an interesting declines. I think a lot of folks would probably

02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:33.360
say the same thing about Billy Mitchell and so forth, but it's, it is very interesting.

02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:38.880
And even with music, you know, now a lot of people get music, they find people on YouTube.

02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:42.880
You know, it's like, that's how Justin Bieber got found, right? You know, and I realize a lot of

02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:47.040
people make fun of him and so forth, but the reality is he has a record contract and you don't.

02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:50.800
How did they find him? They found him through things like YouTube. And now it's all these

02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:55.120
reality shows, finding fucking people online and putting them front and center and so forth. So

02:13:55.120 --> 02:14:01.840
it's just very interesting how, you know, a lot of that has just evolved and what makes a celebrity

02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:08.000
is very much changed. I want to read a comment here from Questbuster in our chat at twitch.tv

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:12.560
slash vlog network, who says it's crazy how Mitchell and the retro scene blew up in the last

02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:17.440
few years. And so quickly, partially because of how accessible social media has made everything

02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:24.400
a 24 seven news cycle with a faster news cycle to stars can rise and fall almost as fast back in the

02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:29.680
80s and 90s. We just had magazines to tell us who the stars were, and they had 30 day reprieves

02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:34.400
until the next issue to see if they still retain their thrones. That's an excellent point. I think

02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:38.560
that's a good one to probably wrap up on. Any other thoughts, Rob, before we let you go?

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:45.520
And actually the last thing, just you just reminded me of something. Is it even possible

02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:49.600
that he is great, you know, benefiting from all this attention now? Because he has a, I think

02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:55.200
someone was mentioning, he's got a Twitch channel now. And so could this all be like, isn't that

02:14:55.200 --> 02:15:00.080
what they say? Like any controversy is good when you're at that level almost because now people

02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:03.360
are talking about even the fact that we're talking maybe is a good thing. I don't know.

02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:08.240
Absolutely. And I would bet you this, like, I'm not going to claim that this show has some gigantic

02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:12.880
viewership or listenership, but I'll bet you there'll be one person who listened to this,

02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:16.960
who go, Oh yeah, Billy Mitchell had a Twitch. I wonder what he's doing over there right now.

02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:21.920
And he'll go visit it. And I think it just goes to show, even if they're talking bad about you,

02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:25.440
they're talking about you and it's going to cause that curiosity. Or somebody is going to go look up

02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:30.000
the article on Wikipedia or somebody is going to see if he has a Twitter or something like that,

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:34.240
because you're kind of bringing his name out there and people are going to be curious a little bit

02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:38.480
about, you know, what's he up to now? And that's just, that's just the interesting part about how

02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:43.520
this all works. So absolutely. Why do you think he has kind of an on-off switch in his brain a

02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:47.840
little bit where, you know, again, and as I mentioned, I'm telling you, he's a pretty nice guy

02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:52.880
off camera. But the minute the camera goes on, he's in, he's in camera mode and he knows the

02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:58.800
part he has to play to get you to keep being curious about him. Yep. That makes sense. Yeah.

02:15:58.800 --> 02:16:03.040
Well, thank you very much for answering all my questions and yeah, it's been great talking to

02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:07.520
you. I've been a listener for about 15 years in the background since my iPod mini, I think,

02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:12.480
is when I first downloaded it. So it's, yeah, it's nice to finally call in and yeah, talk to

02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:16.800
you for once. Well, wonderful to have you here. Thank you so much for your loyalty over the years

02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:22.320
and I wish you well. Have a wonderful night. Okay. Okay. Thank you very much. Yep. Take care. Bye-bye.

02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:26.880
All right. Great phone call. Wow. That was a long time phone call in the making too. Yeah. And see,

02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:32.480
that's, that's where we're succeeding tonight is places like Canada where the, they don't have

02:16:32.480 --> 02:16:35.920
teams in the Super Bowl or there's no Canadian football. Well, I mean, I know there's Canadian

02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:40.080
football league, but there's no Canadian football teams in the NFL, right? You're asking the wrong

02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:44.960
person, right? I don't think there are. I think I would know if there was like a Vancouver team or

02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:51.200
a Toronto team and I don't think there are. So, all right. Anyway, cool. You know, I thought he

02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:54.960
was going to say when I've been listening for 15 years, I started on my PSP. You know how many of

02:16:54.960 --> 02:17:00.160
that I get that OLR PSP thing probably brought more. I always thought it was iTunes that brought

02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:04.080
the eyes to the show. And that one life, I think all our PSP probably brought more people to show

02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:09.360
than anybody else. That's crazy. So, well, it's too late now. Yeah. I'll never update it. All right.

02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:13.760
Well, that's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio. Cause I don't think you

02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:20.080
didn't have any other last minute stories, right? No, not really. Then we'll go on to wrap things

02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:24.400
up. We're going to wrap things up here at orange launch radio. Thank you guys so much for listening

02:17:24.400 --> 02:17:28.160
in tonight, whether it was your first episode or you've been listening for 15 years, appreciate

02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:32.240
you being here either live or in the podcast form. If you enjoyed what you heard here at orange

02:17:32.240 --> 02:17:35.680
launch radio, tell a friend, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer

02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:40.560
has a voice. But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, then we can't have them. And we love

02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:45.360
to hear the interesting and diverse perspectives. So yeah, help us spread the word. A nice five star

02:17:45.360 --> 02:17:49.200
review goes a long way as well. iTunes, or I guess you can't really review things on Spotify,

02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:54.400
but you can share. So there is that. So I really appreciate that and all that support. We'll be

02:17:54.400 --> 02:18:00.320
back in seven days to do it all over again. I keep thinking next weekend is Valentine's weekend,

02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:04.480
but it's not. We still have one more weekend in between. So, but for now we're going to wrap

02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:08.240
up for the night and go around and give everybody's final thoughts. So, Loki, your final

02:18:08.240 --> 02:18:15.920
thought. My final thought is I can't wait to be over this cold. Oh, yikes. Feel better. I hope

02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:21.280
you didn't give it to me. No, I got it from my wife. It was, it was like almost like a flu thing,

02:18:21.280 --> 02:18:26.640
but I'm going through it a lot faster than she is. You sound fine too. I'm just congested. Like,

02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:34.240
I mean, I was fine today. And my final thought is I did my tax return last night and I'm getting way

02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:39.360
less money back than I have in previous years, which makes me a little bit sad, but oh well.

02:18:40.400 --> 02:18:44.480
That is what it is. So I hope I will cross my fingers and my toes that you all get,

02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:47.760
at least those of you in America that have to do your taxes this time of year. I will cross

02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:52.080
my fingers and my toes that you all get some good news as well. Anyway, or at least better

02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:57.520
news than I did. That's it. We're done. Enjoy gaming everybody. We'll see you in seven days.

02:18:57.520 --> 02:19:01.760
Have fun playing games and all that good stuff. Be nice to each other and support independent

02:19:01.760 --> 02:19:07.760
broadcasting. We will see you in seven days. Good night everybody. You've been listening to
