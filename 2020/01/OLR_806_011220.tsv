0	27000	This week all I want to say is that D.L. Athera did an incredible thing, likely saving Aiden Jackson's life, especially with I presume an incomplete amount of detail about his personal life. This is the best headline in tonight's news, stay tuned for plenty more, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	50000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 806 for this January the 12th of 2020. My name is Rob Roberts and welcome back this week DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.
50000	51000	Hi.
51000	52000	It's great to have you back with us.
52000	53000	Thank you.
53000	54000	Are you enjoying your coffee?
54000	55000	I am.
55000	56000	Thank you.
56000	62000	And I always appreciate that you will restock any coffee that you take with more coffee.
62000	63000	Well, I just remember-
63000	64000	Let the coffee flow.
64000	71000	Well, I came by last weekend to bring Alan some books which I still have them have some more in my car.
71000	72000	Oh really? Okay.
72000	79000	And the, and y'all were gracious enough to give me some coffee and we got into the discussion about-
79000	80000	It's just coffee.
80000	84000	Coffee flavored coffee. And that Alan wanted coffee flavored coffee.
84000	90000	Okay, here's the thing. This is why we talk about coffee flavored coffee because I am a big fan of, you know, we use the little-
90000	91000	You like the froufrou.
91000	99000	We use the little pre-made pre-packaged cup things that a lot of people use, right? So I like the, like we have cinnamon roll right now. Love that.
99000	101000	I'm liking the gingerbread with Snickers in it.
101000	108000	There's gingerbread we got on discount because Christmas is over. We got, you know, I like to get the hazelnut and the vanilla and I have coconut mocha at work.
108000	114000	But Alan is like, I just want coffee flavored coffee. He doesn't like all that stuff.
114000	120000	It's like Dennis Leary. I don't want your maple nut crunch. I want coffee flavored coffee.
120000	130000	But yeah, so when I, because I mean, I go to home goods a lot and I go to Ross and you can get K cups at both places relatively inexpensive.
130000	133000	Yeah, I always forget. We always, you know, Target.
133000	137000	Or the grocery outlet. I figure if I'm going to name two places, I'll name three to be fair.
137000	138000	Fair.
138000	147000	But, um, but I happen to be at Ross looking for some organizational stuff and found just like legit medium roast coffee.
147000	155000	And I was like, if I'm going to drink the coffee at Robin Allen's place, I'm going to get coffee that I will drink and that they will like.
155000	157000	So I got the medium roast.
157000	158000	Well, we appreciate it.
158000	160000	You're welcome. So do I.
160000	164000	For what it's worth, the decaf I usually drink is coffee flavored.
164000	165000	Yeah.
165000	166000	Even though it's decaf.
166000	167000	It's hard to find flavored decafs.
167000	172000	It is. It is. I know a lot of you would say, what's the point? But it's just, it's like the dessert coffee. I like that.
172000	173000	You know, coffee is dessert.
173000	177000	Well, I found though this gingerbread is really good with that Snickers creamer in it.
177000	178000	Just saying it's really good.
178000	183000	But if you're at my house, so all the coffee at my house is typically coffee flavored coffee.
183000	185000	I get my beans from Phil's.
185000	189000	I will preach the gospel of Phil's coffee until I die.
189000	191000	Or sometimes I'll do temple.
191000	193000	And that's mostly I don't think Phil's really exists.
194000	197000	No, I first went I went to my first Phil's in L.A.
197000	198000	Oh, OK.
198000	202000	So but it's mostly California West Coast stuff.
202000	203000	Maybe like one in Arizona.
203000	204000	But they ship.
204000	205000	OK. Oh, OK.
205000	209000	And I will tell I'll do this. I'll do this.
209000	212000	One person.
212000	216000	One person out there. And I will just do this because I'm a nice person.
216000	222000	If you can pick my.
222000	226000	Favorite kind of chocolate.
226000	229000	OK, my absolute favorite brand of chocolate.
229000	234000	OK, I will send you a bag of Phil's filtered soul.
234000	240000	Do they have to send you the chocolate or did you just yell it out in chat?
240000	245000	How does this work? They have to they have to email participate.
245000	247000	Oh, OK.
247000	251000	And the first one that guesses my favorite brand of chocolate.
251000	257000	OK, we'll get a like a half pound or I have to see what I can get,
257000	260000	but either half pound or whole pound bag of Phil's filtered soul.
260000	261000	OK, look at Dark Soccer.
261000	263000	Get in that mail. You can't be in California.
263000	268000	All right. Participate at Orange Lounge radio dot com.
268000	271000	Why are you excluding California because they can just get it here.
271000	272000	OK. OK.
272000	276000	Unless you're like in the remote boonies in California, which they exist.
276000	277000	Just say of course.
277000	281000	But, you know, actually, you know, I don't care if you're in California.
281000	283000	I'll just do it.
283000	285000	Clearly, these rules were not thought out beforehand.
285000	286000	OK. No, I just made it up.
286000	290000	So but you have to guess what my favorite brand of chocolate is.
290000	292000	And I will give everyone one hint.
292000	295000	Rob always brings me some back from Chicago.
295000	298000	OK. OK. I know what it is. All right.
298000	299000	You can just come to my house.
299000	302000	You got to email participate at Orange Lounge radio dot com.
302000	305000	That that mailbag is going to blow up later in the show.
305000	307000	Hello as well, of course, to Tech Master Loki.
307000	309000	Hey, what's up every week? Hi. Good.
309000	311000	I see you're over there playing Orna.
311000	314000	I have to get the best or the most out of the double experience thing.
314000	319000	The latest OLR obsession amongst listeners and hosts alike.
319000	321000	What's up with that, though? You left the party.
321000	325000	Now you can't see you can't see the blacksmith I built right here.
325000	327000	I got one of them in my house. OK, fine.
327000	330000	Fine. I believe the party because I was just carrying you guys.
330000	334000	And, you know, I, I needed to like get level up.
334000	337000	And I was like, it's just taking so long and I'm getting so much experience.
337000	340000	Like, oh, all of them are getting some experience.
340000	342000	So I had the bail. Oh, I thought.
342000	344000	But we weren't giving it back to you.
344000	346000	It didn't seem like it was going up.
346000	350000	I heard in the last patch they did something with the balancing
350000	356000	where like you don't benefit from power leveling like it used to be.
356000	358000	Like you got in the game like right.
358000	359000	Unfortunately, at the wrong time for that.
359000	362000	Yeah. So I just because once I left the party,
362000	364000	like I've been I've gone up like 10 levels.
364000	368000	So it's it's much faster by myself for now.
368000	372000	But, you know, if I build anything near your house,
372000	377000	or what I've been doing is if I build anything, I may just make it public.
377000	379000	And so that everybody can benefit from it.
379000	381000	I just don't touch my territories that I control.
381000	383000	I saw that earlier.
383000	385000	Should I challenge his territory?
385000	389000	I'm like, nah.
389000	392000	I've been I've been captured really like too much.
392000	395000	I've been capturing territory in a bunch of strange places.
395000	399000	Like I'll just be like I was out like walking along the river the other day,
399000	401000	just half fitness, half.
401000	403000	There's an Ingress portal out there I was trying to get.
403000	404000	And I was like, let me bring up Orna.
404000	407000	And I was like, wow, there's like a completely unclaimed region out here,
407000	409000	because who the fuck ever comes out here?
409000	411000	Like way in the back booty.
411000	413000	You know, only a crazy ass Ingress player,
413000	415000	which why I'm surprised is that didn't have it.
415000	418000	But I guess she didn't think to bring up Orna back there.
418000	419000	So I grabbed it.
419000	423000	And yeah, I I've been finding it in all sorts of like weird places,
423000	425000	just like regions to control and things like that.
425000	429000	But there's no like there's no like map you can bring up to see where these places are.
429000	430000	You won't get a list.
430000	431000	Right. They do.
431000	434000	And they're supposed to have like I haven't seen it yet,
434000	436000	but at least it hasn't been pushed to my device.
436000	440000	But they have a beta map that's coming where you can actually zoom out a little bit
440000	442000	and kind of rotate it and all that stuff.
442000	447000	But oh, I haven't been able to to see that.
447000	450000	Interesting. I must. Yeah, I must have completely missed that.
450000	452000	So. All right.
452000	454000	Well, anyway, let's get into tonight's show.
454000	456000	It is a podcast about video games.
456000	460000	I mean, sometimes sometimes, you know, we just were talking about video games,
460000	463000	location, cell phone, gaming's is a big part of that.
463000	465000	So we'll talk a little bit about Pokemon Go later.
465000	466000	I know that's in the news.
466000	468000	There's been a lot of Pokemon news this week.
468000	471000	But first, we want to take a step back and take a look at last year,
471000	476000	because we have yet to really talk about our top video games of twenty nineteen.
476000	480000	We have put it off a little bit because we wanted time to play more games.
480000	484000	And then we weren't able to do it last week because Dark Sakura was unexpectedly gone.
484000	485000	But she's back tonight.
485000	488000	And so we can talk about our top games of twenty nineteen.
488000	492000	So and I gave full disclosure on saying what happened.
492000	494000	Oh, yeah. We talked about it, you know.
494000	498000	So but I wanted just to take a moment and thank everyone who did reach out.
498000	501000	So Dan and I appreciate it.
501000	503000	We've been going through.
503000	508000	We found some very interesting things like turtles, the genitalia,
508000	510000	like ceramic turtles, not like ceramic turtles.
510000	518000	Yes, but but we've also found like just like little things that Dan had done when he was a kid,
518000	521000	like like those art plates. Oh, yeah, sure.
521000	524000	And some of his like a little bit of video game stuff around.
524000	530000	We reclaimed our laser desks. OK, so but just very interesting things.
530000	535000	All right. Well, you know, that's the nice thing about having done the show for so long and doing it live is that,
535000	538000	you know, people around here gender genuinely care about each other.
538000	543000	So including the listeners care about us and and I care about most of you.
543000	545000	No, I don't want to I don't want to cheapen the moment with a joke.
545000	549000	I do I do care as well. So definitely we all look out for each other.
549000	553000	So I know a lot of people looking out for you guys last week, so it's great to have you back.
553000	556000	Thank you. But tonight we're going to move into our top games of twenty nineteen.
556000	561000	So I know it's a little bit delayed, but we're not quite to January 15th yet.
561000	565000	I think for some people, the holidays don't end until tomorrow. So we'll get into that now.
565000	571000	Let's talk about our top games of the year. So each of us has picked three games using any criteria we want.
571000	575000	OK, this is not it's not your games. It's our games.
575000	577000	So these lists are not wrong.
577000	586000	They're not rigged because we used whatever criteria we damn well play pleased in order to come up with our top three games of the year.
586000	590000	So here they are. I'll pick on Loki. Why not? Why don't you go first?
590000	595000	We number your number three pick your number three game of the twenty nineteen.
595000	600000	Let's see. So my number three game is going to be Minecraft Earth, I guess.
600000	604000	OK. Oh, interesting. A game that's still kind of not done.
604000	607000	Well, neither is the official Minecraft. True.
607000	615000	Although I noticed I actually brought up Minecraft Earth this week and they've there's already more like tutorial stuff there that wasn't there before.
615000	620000	Yeah, there's not much tutorial you really need for that game. I mean, I don't know.
620000	629000	Yeah, it's been kind of fun. I play it every now and then. I don't play it a ton because there's not a whole lot of reason to go and collect things aside from getting experience.
629000	634000	But even the experience is just kind of like it unlocks some more places he can build stuff.
634000	641000	But any of the stuff that I build, I end up just, you know, basically bulldozing the whole thing and just starting from scratch.
641000	644000	But you can get different biomes and stuff and whatnot.
644000	652000	But you never really run out of like blocks to build with because you collect so many in the course of playing the game.
652000	662000	So, I know if it wasn't such a battery sink, I'd probably play it a whole ton more. But yeah, it really just drains that battery.
662000	668000	Well, and from a technological perspective, it is accomplishing like something kind of new, something really neat, you know?
668000	671000	Yeah, the AR stuff is pretty fun. It's actually really cool.
671000	676000	Yeah, like, you know, Pokemon Go just got the whole AR buddies take pictures of your Pokemon buddies.
676000	678000	Yeah, this is way more elaborate.
678000	681000	This Minecraft Earth thing is already like steps and steps beyond that.
681000	686000	Like the AR stuff, and it works pretty good too, actually. So the AR stuff, they have the little adventures.
686000	693000	It's basically just playing Minecraft with like a small square block, like 16 by 16 or whatever.
693000	696000	And a lot of it you're just kind of walking over, you're kind of hovering over it.
696000	699000	And you're just kind of digging stuff out.
699000	705000	And a lot of times it could be just killing some enemies and then there may be some golden diamond down there.
705000	711000	Or it could be you're solving a puzzle and then you get more like, you know, resources that way.
711000	719000	But it's pretty interesting and they have a ton of them at parks and they pop in and out like every few minutes.
719000	723000	And I mean, so you can keep doing that over and over and get a lot of resources that way.
723000	730000	But then there's also the fact if you die, you lose everything that you have in your inventory, like Minecraft.
731000	734000	So you have to be careful what you, well, not your full inventory.
734000	740000	You basically have, you know, like in regular Minecraft where you have a bar full of stuff in it.
740000	747000	So you can take into those adventures one row of things and then you just have to be careful.
747000	751000	Like if you start to die, then you exit out.
751000	755000	But you just have to be careful.
755000	759000	The only time that the game's been kind of cheap on me is like I'll be like mining stuff.
759000	762000	I've already killed all the enemies and all of a sudden there's a skeleton that comes from behind.
762000	766000	I'm like, what the fuck? You know, why is there a skeleton here all of a sudden?
766000	773000	But usually a lot of that, like if I'm getting bum rushed by a few things, I can just like exit, close it, and you're fine.
773000	779000	All right. Minecraft Earth. Good pick. Something I think we'll see more of probably as we move into 2020.
779000	782000	Dark Sakura, we'll go to you. What's your number three game of 2019?
782000	785000	Death Stranding. Because...
785000	787000	I kind of figured that would show up on your list somewhere.
787000	791000	I didn't play it, but I enjoyed watching the fuck out of it.
791000	794000	And for me, that's all I really wanted out of it was just the story.
794000	799000	I thought the story was really interesting and kind of a mind fuck and that's kind of up my alley.
799000	804000	So, I mean, it was the closest I could get to having that weird brain fuck of Silent Hill.
804000	808000	So I was cool with it. And Bridge Baby is adorable.
808000	809000	And Lindsay Wagner.
809000	811000	Bridge Baby.
811000	817000	And people apparently really enjoy urinating in front of Conan O'Brien's little area.
817000	819000	Bridge Baby.
819000	823000	I think Dark Sakura would be one of them if she was playing it regularly, but...
823000	825000	Well, I'd have to have a Go-Girling game.
825000	826000	What do you think about...
826000	829000	Because that's the only way I could whip out a dick and pee.
829000	834000	Well, that's OK. You're taking on the role of Norman Reedus, so you're whipping out his dick to...
834000	838000	Well then, some people would really be into that.
838000	842000	Dear Mr. Reedus, are you aware that people are whipping out your dick?
842000	843000	There was...
843000	845000	I didn't consent to this.
845000	851000	I posted something on Twitter where it's like, is it weird that we force him to go to the bathroom and poop and then we get served an ad for...
851000	854000	Well, you know, with the amount of rock, or was it...
854000	862000	Monster energy drinks he's drinking in the game, then it's no wonder he has to use the bathroom all the time because Jesus Christ.
862000	867000	What's that doing to your insides as I sip my 12-ounce Red Bull?
867000	872000	I know you haven't really sat down and played the game and you're more into it for the story,
872000	877000	but I know for the longest time here on OLR, the what the fuck is Death Stranding was kind of like...
877000	879000	I still don't know.
879000	887000	It was kind of like the running gag on the show, but now that we understand this is the game, this is the point, this is what you're playing,
887000	889000	what do you think about how that all turned out?
889000	896000	Because for me, I was always expecting it to be something a little more action-y or something, and it's very much not that, but I'm OK with that.
896000	898000	I'm totally OK with what it is.
898000	906000	Hmm. Well, in the end, it's I think about the connections that we have with each other,
906000	912000	and also about the dangers inherent to having connections with others.
912000	919000	You know, it's definitely that sort of isolationist versus expansionist point of view.
919000	925000	You know, if you even think about it on a global scale, it can really be applied almost in a political spectrum.
925000	932000	It's very allegorical to things that we see going on around us today.
932000	941000	For me, I just like the fact that it lets you know that there is really no one right way versus a wrong way.
941000	945000	But sometimes if you...
945000	947000	It's really kind of hard to describe, you know.
947000	959000	And then also the thing that I like, too, is that it went through sort of the discussion of duty versus individual desire,
959000	967000	and what some people will do for, like, Die Hard Man and his duty, and what he did in the name of his duty,
967000	971000	and then how it affected him the rest of his life.
971000	976000	Sort of like it's the I was just following orders thing versus making your own moral decision for yourself.
977000	983000	The individual characters just were really... Dead Man was another interesting one.
983000	991000	Just kind of a moral thing. Is this a person? Does it have a soul?
991000	995000	I'm not trying to go too much in because people are still playing it, you know.
995000	1000000	But there was so much depth and thought that went into everything in it.
1001000	1008000	And people are just like... People are uncomfortable with, I think, doing the deep dive in the story elements with it.
1008000	1013000	And so for them, it's easier just to make fun of it. Or say, oh, it was weird, blah, blah, blah.
1013000	1019000	People are like that. People don't want to take a deep dive into disturbing topics.
1019000	1026000	But the moment that you do, you find part of your view of life is a little bit expanded.
1026000	1033000	And I honestly think that the game did ask some of those more ambiguous moral questions of the player.
1033000	1040000	What do you think of this? Forcing them to look at these things, life and death, and moral decisions,
1040000	1046000	and the communication and connections of other people, and kind of evaluate that in themselves.
1046000	1051000	Deep. I need to spend more time with it. Honestly, I got sidetracked by other games.
1051000	1054000	But I enjoyed what I played of it, for sure.
1054000	1058000	That's the way I like games like that. I like Detroit for some of the same things.
1058000	1064000	It's just... I like a question that a game asks.
1064000	1072000	When it asks a question that's going to have a deep impact philosophically on your worldview. Just saying.
1072000	1075000	The other thing I want to mention about that game is the soundtrack.
1075000	1079000	Love the church's song. A lot of hipster music, I suppose. But it's all really good.
1079000	1083000	There's some really good stuff in there. So, all right. Death Stranding it is.
1083000	1089000	My number three pick is going to be kind of an obvious, like, oh, of course he's going to say something like that.
1089000	1092000	But I think this really deserves it in many ways.
1092000	1097000	And I'm going to say the Final Fantasy XIV Shadowbringers expansion will be my number three game of the year.
1097000	1103000	Just because I think the expansion was very strong with what it brought to the game.
1103000	1108000	You know, just kind of upping the formula that they started with Realm Reborn.
1108000	1115000	But really, you know, perfecting it, making a lot of job classes a little more tighter and a little more fun.
1115000	1123000	Like, for example, you know, they took the job Machinist and it was a little bit clunky, relied a little bit on luck.
1123000	1127000	They injected a little bit of Edgar from Final Fantasy VI into it.
1127000	1130000	So, like, now you have a Bioblaster and an autocrossbow and stuff.
1130000	1132000	And let me tell you, it is really fucking fun.
1132000	1134000	Oh, and drill. Drill is important, too.
1134000	1137000	Like, it's like they take a lot of this fantasy stuff.
1137000	1141000	You're like, I don't know how this would ever work in an MMO, but they do it and it's great.
1141000	1145000	And never mind the story, which, you know, was really good.
1145000	1152000	You know, not to get too spoilery, but the kind of the trick about it is that it doesn't really take place in the same world that the rest of the game does.
1152000	1154000	I'll sort of kind of keep it vague.
1154000	1159000	But I think that actually really helps for an expansion kind of story.
1159000	1167000	That it's a little bit more like, oh, now our adventurers are over here doing this thing, but there's all these complicated problems that go with that.
1167000	1172000	And I think it allowed the story to play out very, very well.
1172000	1179000	I didn't love the ending compared to some of the other expansions, but I have enjoyed the patch content this week.
1179000	1182000	I finally finished up the most recent patch, the 5.1 patch.
1182000	1187000	And I did like how that kind of wrapped up and where that went in that story.
1187000	1196000	And of course, the developers continue to do an amazing job supporting the game post launch with regular patches, which not every MMO is doing that well anymore.
1196000	1204000	So I think they really get kudos for running just a really strong premier MMO right now.
1204000	1210000	And what might be the strongest expansion they'll ever do, which they just put out.
1210000	1214000	I mean, I hope, of course, whatever they do next might even go a step beyond that.
1214000	1220000	But if this is as good as it gets, it's been pretty damn good. So I will take it.
1220000	1225000	So there you go. I pick Final Fantasy XIV Shadowbringers. It's my number three game of the year.
1225000	1228000	So let's get to the second choices on the list.
1228000	1232000	So far, everybody's got different games. I was thinking there'd be more overlap. I think there will be later, but we'll see.
1232000	1234000	Here we go. Loki, your number two game.
1234000	1238000	My number two game is going to be What the Golf.
1238000	1242000	That is pretty fun. I've been enjoying it.
1242000	1249000	My one of my favorite indie games of the year. So, yeah, I've enjoyed playing it quite a bit.
1249000	1252000	So I haven't finished it yet. So I'll have to go back to it at some point.
1252000	1258000	But definitely worth checking out, especially if you have Apple Arcade or something like that, because it's part of that.
1258000	1260000	What is it about this game that you love so dang much?
1260000	1266000	It's just because it's like it's got this street, a strange like kind of Katamari feel to it, just like with the music and everything.
1266000	1274000	And it's just a strange like it's not even really about golf. It's just kind of a strange like puzzle game.
1274000	1278000	And I don't know, it just it's got a weird aesthetic to it. That's charming.
1278000	1282000	OK. Yeah. All right. What the golf? Number two.
1282000	1285000	Dark Sakura, how about you? Your number two pick.
1285000	1290000	I'm going to pick Resident Evil 2 because I fucking enjoy the shit out of it.
1290000	1292000	A lot of people did. You're not alone.
1292000	1297000	Resident Evil 2, honestly, I liked better than the first one, and I really loved the first one.
1297000	1303000	But Resident Evil 2 was the one that cemented my love for the series and the voice acting was top notch.
1303000	1311000	I kind of liked where they had some variations from the original version.
1311000	1314000	And I'm also glad this is going to lead to a Resident Evil 3.
1314000	1319000	So I also love watching people break that game. It's just fucking hilarious.
1319000	1322000	But I really, I really enjoyed it. There's a lot to look at.
1322000	1328000	Little Easter eggs, lots of things that, you know, if you can get the game where you can look around the scenery,
1328000	1333000	it's just absolutely in-depth and beautiful. And I really enjoyed it.
1333000	1338000	Although it makes me think, why the hell do people build these weird ass puzzles in a police station?
1338000	1341000	Like, really, people? What the fuck were you thinking? Were you a cult?
1341000	1344000	So anyway, that's it. No, Silent Hill was about the cult.
1344000	1350000	Anyway, you're not alone in our chat. ActDeft in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network,
1350000	1352000	because we do, I don't think I've said this line yet tonight,
1352000	1356000	but we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,
1356000	1361000	right after the Bobby Blackwell show at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network.
1361000	1363000	And if you're here live, you can chat along with our show.
1363000	1367000	And we read some of the comments here, including folks agreeing with Dark Soccer,
1367000	1372000	including ActDeft, who says Resident Evil 2 deserves the praise. It was a really well done remake.
1372000	1376000	And Quest Buster says, I enjoyed the shit out of the Resident Evil 2 remake also.
1376000	1380000	The speedruns for Resident Evil 2 are really fun to watch.
1380000	1381000	Okay.
1381000	1386000	Alright, so a lot of love for Resident Evil 2. I guess at some point I'll have to get around to playing the remake.
1386000	1390000	You know, you all know how I am with the gory games, but I remember playing the original on PlayStation.
1390000	1391000	It's not that gross.
1391000	1394000	Yeah, it's not that gross. So I'll deal with it.
1394000	1399000	Alright, my number two pick in the meantime, though, I'm going to go with an indie pick as well.
1399000	1406000	And this is just one of those games that is just style, style, style, and the music was stellar, stellar, stellar.
1406000	1410000	And I love the presentation. It was kind of a short, simple game.
1410000	1416000	But y'all know I love the games that are just art and simple and a hell of a lot of fun.
1416000	1420000	And that's why I would say Sayonara Wild Hearts is my number two game of the year.
1420000	1421000	That's a good one.
1421000	1422000	Yeah.
1422000	1423000	I really enjoyed it.
1423000	1426000	I loved it. And the soundtrack is great. I can listen along to it in the car.
1426000	1432000	The gameplay is simple, yet there is so much to pursue in the name of perfection.
1432000	1440000	Certainly my music gaming roots have a lot to do with that, even though I wouldn't necessarily call Sayonara Wild Hearts a music game.
1440000	1442000	It feels a little more like elements as elements.
1442000	1443000	Exactly.
1443000	1445000	I say it's more like I think I've always called it.
1445000	1447000	It's the Sonic two bonus level as a game.
1447000	1449000	It's like kind of racing, kind of not.
1449000	1452000	So but that's I've really been enjoying it on Apple Arcade.
1452000	1455000	Yeah, I've done most of my play on the switch.
1455000	1460000	But I can totally see how this game would work easy on phones because it is basically just motion.
1460000	1464000	I'm sure you can just drag and then tap or something because it's just motion and a button.
1464000	1465000	That's pretty much how it is.
1465000	1466000	Yeah, exactly.
1466000	1468000	Act F in chat says I need to pick up Sayonara Wild Hearts.
1468000	1470000	It's on sale this week on the switch.
1470000	1474000	So, yeah, I think the sale's a good time to pick up the game.
1474000	1475000	So there you go.
1475000	1476000	All right.
1476000	1481000	That leaves us with the best around number one game of the year.
1481000	1483000	Loki, your game of the year.
1483000	1486000	My number one pick of the year, I guess, is going to be Borderlands three.
1486000	1487000	Are we on number one already?
1487000	1488000	Yeah.
1488000	1489000	I thought we were on number two.
1489000	1491000	No, you just did Resident Evil 2.
1491000	1492000	No, you did Resident Evil 2.
1492000	1493000	That was my number two.
1493000	1494000	OK.
1494000	1495000	No, that's all right.
1495000	1496000	All right.
1496000	1498000	Number one is Borderlands 3.
1498000	1499000	Oh, OK.
1499000	1501000	Because it's more Borderlands.
1501000	1507000	You don't think now I've heard some people got a little tired of the formula this time around, but not for you.
1507000	1509000	No, it's still fine.
1509000	1513000	I haven't played through the DLC stuff yet, but it's all right.
1513000	1514000	Yeah, it's it.
1514000	1521000	You know, it's not as exciting as the first game when you first get into it, because we've done this a few times now.
1521000	1522000	But it's still all right.
1522000	1524000	It's still enjoyable.
1524000	1525000	Yeah.
1525000	1526000	All right.
1526000	1530000	So there's going to they're going to still continue to support that with more DLC expansions.
1530000	1531000	Yeah.
1531000	1535000	Like three more pieces of DLC outer two or three.
1535000	1536000	Not even close to the end.
1536000	1538000	Some at some point I'll have to jump into it.
1538000	1540000	But I never finished Borderlands one.
1540000	1543000	But I did kind of like get more into Borderlands one.
1543000	1545000	And, you know, I played I put.
1545000	1548000	Yeah, I probably dropped like at least 15 hours in that game, if not more.
1548000	1550000	So, yeah, I have a lot of fun with that series.
1550000	1551000	So.
1551000	1552000	All right. Cool.
1552000	1553000	Borderlands three.
1553000	1557000	I guess I I don't know why I didn't even think of that for you, but makes sense.
1557000	1558000	You're number one pick game of the year.
1558000	1559000	Cool.
1559000	1560000	All right.
1560000	1561000	Dark soccer.
1561000	1562000	It's all about you.
1562000	1563000	Number one.
1563000	1564000	First blood stained.
1564000	1565000	Whoo.
1565000	1566000	OK.
1566000	1568000	Bloodstained was beautiful.
1568000	1572000	It was my my Symphony of the Night wet dream.
1572000	1574000	It was challenging.
1574000	1577000	It was in depth.
1577000	1580000	I had so many things in it now with the new game.
1580000	1587000	Plus is pretty fun to go back and grab things that we didn't have and start off the game ridiculously overpowered.
1587000	1588000	Absolutely beautiful.
1588000	1591000	The voice acting was great.
1591000	1593000	I really can't stand up good about it.
1593000	1599000	The PS4 to me, after having seen the other ones in motion, is the definitive one to play.
1599000	1601000	I think is the most balanced.
1601000	1605000	And definitely it was well worth the wait.
1605000	1612000	Although I will say, if you have an Xbox Game Pass PC or I think Xbox one, you can grab it.
1612000	1617000	So like, you know, there's not a lot stopping you and jumping in and enjoying the game as well.
1617000	1622000	And I know you're not alone in that because, well, for one, our chat rooms lighten up quite a bit.
1622000	1627000	But also I've met other people that think Bloodstained is just like the best thing they've absolutely played all year.
1627000	1629000	And yeah, I enjoyed it.
1629000	1631000	I really had a great time with it.
1631000	1642000	And the thing for me is that it really did just hit that thing I was missing in some of those other Castlevania games that followed the formula.
1642000	1644000	This really had the touch back to it.
1644000	1652000	And of course, you know, some of the character nods back to the I love the portraits of the developers in the background that will just attack you.
1652000	1653000	I love that.
1653000	1656000	And I love the one where because I figured those were Kickstarter rewards.
1656000	1658000	So most of those are like actual people.
1658000	1660000	But one of them is a cat.
1660000	1662000	And I love that.
1662000	1663000	I love the giant cats.
1663000	1665000	I wish I'd paid for Mr.
1665000	1671000	Smoosh to be one of the paintings in that maybe if they do a Bloodstained 2 and they offer portrait awards.
1671000	1674000	I'll try to I'll try to get some money together and get a portrait of Mr.
1674000	1675000	Smoosh.
1675000	1677000	I want them to bring back my guy, though.
1677000	1679000	Zungotsu.
1679000	1680000	Because he was my guy.
1680000	1681000	Did you get that far?
1681000	1682000	No, I didn't get that far.
1682000	1683000	OK.
1683000	1684000	Yeah.
1684000	1685000	So.
1685000	1686000	Spoilers.
1686000	1687000	All right.
1687000	1688000	That's all right.
1688000	1689000	That's right.
1689000	1690000	All right.
1690000	1691000	So Bloodstained game of the year.
1691000	1693000	It's from a girl that probably enjoyed Castlevania Symphony the night.
1693000	1696000	Even Rondo of blood than most people.
1696000	1697000	Which is a lot.
1697000	1702000	Did I tell you that that was that Dan sat me down when I first moved out here.
1702000	1704000	Put the game in front of me.
1704000	1706000	I said, you're fucking playing this.
1706000	1709000	And this is like the determining factor of our relationship.
1709000	1713000	Wasn't it something like I'm not going to date anyone who can't beat this game or something like that.
1713000	1714000	Something like that.
1714000	1715000	Yeah.
1715000	1717000	And I beat it several times over.
1717000	1718000	I loved it.
1718000	1720000	I found like boundary breaks for it.
1720000	1721000	It was fun.
1721000	1725000	And then then just to prove my love to him.
1725000	1730000	I beat Strider on Genesis.
1730000	1731000	Love it.
1731000	1732000	Yeah.
1732000	1734000	Better relationships through video games.
1734000	1735000	All right.
1735000	1740000	This is going to be interesting because this is the first year where we're going to have zero overlap on any of our list.
1740000	1743000	Because my number one is not from your list and it's not from your list.
1743000	1744000	It's different.
1744000	1746000	I thought you would pick this dark soccer.
1746000	1748000	I'm kind of surprised.
1748000	1749000	Honk.
1749000	1750000	But that's no it's actually not.
1750000	1752000	It's not honk.
1752000	1754000	I I'll talk about honk.
1754000	1756000	I finally played that game in this last week too.
1756000	1758000	I'll talk about that later.
1758000	1759000	No.
1759000	1764000	My number one pick is a game that I don't think everybody would put as their number one pick.
1764000	1769000	Especially if you read a lot of social media because some people really weren't fans of this game.
1769000	1772000	But I think they're hating on it for the wrong reasons.
1772000	1779000	And if you actually sit down and you play this game and you see some of the improvements that they've made with this really long running franchise.
1779000	1789000	You're going to see that they've really put a full tank of gas into something that was you know kind of for me anyway running on low fumes with some of the most recent releases.
1789000	1795000	Obviously I'm talking about Pokemon Sword and Shield and that is my absolute top game of the year.
1795000	1798000	I think I think what they've done with the series is amazing.
1798000	1804000	I think the raids have been transformative for how you can get through the game and it doesn't like feel like grinding so much.
1804000	1807000	And yes we'll talk about the Pokemon Direct later in the show.
1807000	1815000	And yes I think it's really exciting news for the series and I'm just I'm just a fan.
1815000	1822000	And the fact that I've probably bought almost every Pokemon generation at least one game at some point.
1822000	1824000	Maybe not in like gens 2 and 3.
1824000	1826000	I might skip some of the early gens.
1826000	1831000	But like the fact that I've probably bought a Pokemon game but never been motivated to really play it through to completion.
1831000	1836000	But this time I did and I did relatively quickly.
1836000	1846000	Not not not saying like it didn't take me long to beat but just saying like I sat down and I focused and I was like I will beat this game because I am having a good time playing it.
1846000	1855000	I think speaks volumes and I think is why it's my game of the year and it's it's I think going to continue to carry legs long in the next year as well.
1855000	1857000	So I'm really excited about that.
1857000	1858000	That is for sure.
1858000	1861000	So act deft in chat saying Rob I love you.
1861000	1862000	Thank you.
1862000	1864000	Sword and Shield did a lot of things right.
1864000	1868000	That the bad gets like really overshadowed sword and shield are so enjoyable.
1868000	1873000	Well you know what for all the national Dexter's where you want to call it on Twitter.
1873000	1882000	Like if they can just get past that little bit of salt that they have and actually sit down and spend some time with the game like actually play it.
1882000	1885000	I think the proof is right there.
1885000	1891000	I think some of the changes they've made go a long way in what they're trying to do.
1891000	1896000	I'll say this is the first Pokemon game I really enjoyed playing on a console.
1896000	1899000	At the same time it wasn't enough to make it my number one.
1899000	1900000	It's fun.
1900000	1901000	It's enjoyable.
1901000	1902000	It's great.
1902000	1904000	The play is solid.
1904000	1906000	It really has improved.
1906000	1913000	It just isn't compelling enough story wise to put it over the top for me because I am about the story.
1913000	1914000	I understand.
1914000	1917000	And like 80 percent of those things you just said would be me with Bloodstained.
1917000	1918000	Like I liked it.
1918000	1919000	I don't know if it's my top three but I liked it.
1919000	1920000	Yeah.
1920000	1921000	So I get it.
1921000	1922000	I get it.
1922000	1923000	So yeah.
1923000	1924000	And it's not it's not perfect.
1924000	1929000	Like it does have some technical issues especially when you're connected online which have to do with lol Nintendo online.
1929000	1932000	But dammit I think this is the best Pokemon has ever been.
1932000	1942000	And yeah in part I'm putting it number one on my list to kind of make a point that like I think a lot of people on social media are getting it very very well.
1942000	1951000	But the good news is it doesn't matter the loud stuff on social media for people who probably haven't bothered to play it because the game is selling cuckoo bananas very well.
1951000	1956000	So I hope that's the type of thing that the Game Freak team and the folks behind are looking at.
1956000	1960000	And sometimes you just have to kind of just not check your mentions on Twitter.
1960000	1962000	And I think that's probably best for those guys.
1962000	1965000	So anyway there it is.
1965000	1966000	So our top games of the year.
1966000	1967000	There they are.
1967000	1968000	So what do we have.
1968000	1969000	What do we have.
1969000	1970000	We had Minecraft Earth.
1970000	1971000	What the golf.
1971000	1972000	Borderlands 3.
1972000	1973000	Right.
1973000	1975000	Then we had Death Stranding.
1975000	1976000	Resident Evil 2.
1976000	1977000	Resident Evil 2.
1977000	1978000	Bloodstained.
1978000	1979000	Bloodstained.
1979000	1982000	And then I think my list has been more conventional.
1982000	1983000	Yeah.
1983000	1984000	Which is odd but whatever.
1984000	1988000	Final Fantasy 14 Shadowbringers expansion.
1988000	1992000	Sayonara Wild Hearts and Pokemon Shield I guess if you have to pick one.
1992000	1993000	But you know what I mean.
1993000	1995000	I would like to offer some honorable mentions.
1995000	1997000	I think the Untitled Goose Game was great.
1997000	2002000	I also liked Patterned on Apple Arcade and Tint.
2002000	2005000	I loved what the golf.
2005000	2009000	Sayonara Wild Hearts is definitely a fun one for me.
2009000	2011000	I just.
2011000	2021000	I didn't bring up any of the iOS stuff just because I would be here all day naming things on Apple Arcade that I have intensely enjoyed playing.
2022000	2028000	And they released more stuff for Patterned so that's kind of like my solitaire I guess because I love puzzles.
2028000	2034000	And I like artwork and I like being able to see how the art fits together so those are some honorable mentions for me.
2034000	2039000	Biggest honorable mention for me that wasn't named anywhere else was Zelda Link's Awakening.
2039000	2041000	I thought the you know the redo version.
2041000	2042000	Oh yeah it was really good too.
2042000	2043000	I don't know why I didn't think about it.
2043000	2044000	I know I know right.
2044000	2046000	So it was just it was it was great though.
2046000	2047000	It was a very solid game.
2047000	2053000	I guess I'd mention even though I don't really get to play much of it other than see what my children put together but Mario maker too.
2053000	2056000	And absolutely something that's worthy of the list as well.
2056000	2060000	So especially I just don't get to play my Switch anymore unfortunately.
2060000	2067000	So that's why I don't have any of those games like Zelda which I do own but haven't been able to play.
2067000	2072000	And and even like this was a Breath of the Wild.
2072000	2074000	I bought that this year too.
2074000	2080000	Can't play it though because my kids take the thing and then my wife wants me to watch TV at night.
2080000	2083000	So you know that's OK.
2083000	2089000	You can always get the Switch Pro and then give the old Switch to your kids even though no because it's all digital.
2089000	2093000	And it tells I don't know how to make accounts work with other switches.
2093000	2095000	I love it.
2095000	2096000	All right.
2096000	2097000	Cool our top games of the year.
2097000	2098000	There they are.
2098000	2099000	So guess what.
2099000	2100000	Now is the point.
2100000	2106000	Now this is it like a new OLR tradition is that we talk about a lot of stuff on this show.
2106000	2111000	In fact sometimes it's hard to remember the things that we even discuss from week to week here on this very program.
2111000	2114000	Let alone the crazy people again.
2114000	2115000	What's up.
2115000	2116000	Who are you people again.
2116000	2117000	I don't know.
2117000	2118000	I don't know how to get this house.
2118000	2119000	I'm kidnapping me.
2119000	2124000	So what we did starting a couple years ago we started putting together a time capsule.
2124000	2127000	And you know gaming changes a lot in a year.
2127000	2129000	Like look at this year.
2129000	2135000	We're going to have at least three four four new consoles coming out in the next year.
2135000	2138000	I'm counting the Atari VCS which maybe I shouldn't be.
2138000	2139000	No.
2139000	2141000	And also the Intellivision Amico.
2141000	2142000	I can.
2142000	2143000	I can.
2143000	2152000	But then of course the PlayStation 5 the Xbox Series X grab a hell and maybe something from Nintendo all that that would still be still be you know theory theorizing at this point.
2152000	2158000	So you know not only we have new consoles but the point is the way things look like in a year not going to be the way they look like today.
2158000	2160000	And that is like always true in gaming.
2160000	2166000	So it's it's going to be really fun to look back and see what crazy shit did we think.
2166000	2173000	What do we think we're going to find in here because I think this is probably loaded with shit that says like how did Animal Crossing turn out.
2173000	2176000	Did Jamie quit the show because she's playing Animal Crossing full time.
2176000	2179000	That's which the gag is of course.
2180000	2185000	But I can't remember if I did this last year the year before last if we did that.
2185000	2191000	But I believe that the year prior stuff is also in there because they had shoved those also.
2191000	2194000	Why did we put two years with this because it's not going to.
2194000	2195000	Nothing changes.
2195000	2196000	That's why God.
2196000	2197000	All right.
2197000	2201000	Dark soccer anything you want to say before I open this and run through it because apparently there's a ton of stuff in here.
2201000	2202000	OK.
2202000	2204000	We're going to make a little.
2204000	2206000	Which was appropriate is the Darth Vader cup.
2206000	2209000	I don't also put candy in there to be like oh candy.
2209000	2210000	Is there candy in here.
2210000	2213000	No but that'd be cool though like because we'll forget it next year.
2213000	2214000	Oh candy.
2214000	2218000	First piece of paper says anticipated games.
2218000	2220000	Number one Animal Crossing.
2220000	2221000	This is my handwriting.
2221000	2224000	Number two Metroid Prime 4.
2224000	2225000	That didn't happen either.
2225000	2228000	Well you were anticipating it was anticipating it.
2228000	2231000	Number three Harry Potter wizards unite.
2231000	2233000	I forgot all about that.
2233000	2234000	That's not all right.
2234000	2238000	I mean it just kind of got lost in the GPS game shuffle but it was all right.
2238000	2240000	And then number four Pokemon Gen 8.
2240000	2242000	Hey I got that one.
2242000	2243000	I got that one.
2243000	2244000	All right.
2244000	2248000	Next up.
2248000	2252000	O.L.R. may earn enough money for bus tickets to PAX.
2252000	2254000	I will say this.
2254000	2261000	Thanks to you guys being very generous with the biddies and the subs and our move to Twitch and all that good stuff.
2261000	2262000	We probably.
2262000	2263000	Bus tickets.
2263000	2267000	Yeah we probably made enough to buy bus tickets to PAX.
2267000	2269000	We'll come back from PAX though.
2269000	2274000	Well when I say we I'm also counting Bobby Black Wolf and everything else at VoG.
2274000	2275000	But I.
2275000	2279000	Yeah I mean just a big thank you to everybody that does that stuff because it does count.
2279000	2286000	Most of that money has really gone into paying for the cost of running a legitimate business because believe it or not that stuff is expensive.
2286000	2290000	And you know we have like you know legal things and document filing and all that stuff.
2290000	2294000	But I mean the fact is that doesn't come out of our pockets anymore.
2294000	2299000	Which is a great feeling because you know I was paying for that old radio feed and now we don't have to anymore.
2299000	2300000	So that's really cool.
2300000	2302000	So anyway.
2302000	2305000	Next up.
2305000	2307000	God I wrote a lot.
2307000	2308000	What the fuck.
2308000	2309000	I just.
2309000	2310000	Oh chat predictions.
2310000	2311000	Oh God.
2311000	2313000	A whole thing about chat predictions.
2313000	2314000	Oh.
2314000	2317000	Oh y'all ready to turn the tables because I see some of your names on this.
2317000	2318000	OK.
2318000	2319000	Here we go.
2319000	2324000	This is She-Hulk projected a portable Xbox.
2324000	2326000	But the cloud.
2326000	2331000	So like it's easy to say oh you got that one wrong She-Hulk but maybe I would say only half.
2331000	2332000	Yeah there's X cloud.
2332000	2336000	There's X cloud and that is going to make Xbox portable.
2336000	2338000	So I'm going to give She-Hulk partial credit.
2338000	2341000	So you get half of Miss Cleo award for that.
2341000	2342000	All right.
2342000	2347000	ActDeft put Pokemon 8th gen delay.
2347000	2348000	No cookie for you.
2348000	2349000	It didn't get delayed.
2349000	2354000	Bobby put Microsoft stops at most audio.
2354000	2356000	I don't even know if that was a thing that happened.
2356000	2357000	Did they.
2357000	2358000	I don't even know.
2358000	2364000	I know he was having problems with his home theater and that's probably where this comment came from.
2364000	2366000	But that's what he had said.
2366000	2370000	Sia Tabiri said new Mario spin off.
2370000	2372000	I don't think we got one of those either.
2372000	2373000	It didn't happen really.
2373000	2375000	You'd have to really dig.
2375000	2376000	I don't know.
2376000	2377000	I don't think that happened.
2377000	2384000	VidPower said established game battle royale spin off.
2384000	2386000	Well they've had several of those.
2386000	2391000	They were really spin offs but like you could say Forza Horizon has battle royale mode.
2391000	2392000	Tetris 99.
2392000	2393000	Tetris 99.
2393000	2395000	That was last year though.
2395000	2396000	No it wasn't in 2019.
2396000	2397000	That was 2019.
2397000	2398000	That was 2019.
2398000	2399000	Was it?
2399000	2400000	2019 releases.
2400000	2407000	So yeah actually I'm going to give that to VidPower because Tetris having a battle royale spin off.
2407000	2408000	Ding ding ding.
2408000	2410000	Fallout 76 did it.
2410000	2412000	Call of Duty did it.
2412000	2413000	Yeah.
2413000	2414000	Oh everybody did it.
2414000	2415000	All right.
2415000	2417000	Pop Culture said Dreamcast classic.
2417000	2420000	Oh how I would love for you to be right but you're wrong.
2420000	2421000	We just have to wait longer for that.
2421000	2426000	And Fifth Dream said Final Fantasy 7 remake cancelled.
2426000	2428000	Whoops at you.
2428000	2429000	Okay.
2429000	2430000	All right.
2430000	2431000	Moving on.
2431000	2432000	Moving on.
2432000	2433000	Oh this is a big one.
2433000	2435000	Here it is.
2435000	2438000	N64 classic released holiday 2019.
2438000	2439000	Nope.
2439000	2440000	Nope.
2440000	2441000	That didn't happen.
2441000	2443000	That didn't happen.
2443000	2444000	Let's see.
2444000	2447000	Next one.
2447000	2449000	Detective Pikachu movie didn't suck.
2449000	2450000	Ding ding ding.
2450000	2451000	That is true.
2451000	2452000	That is true.
2452000	2453000	Absolutely didn't suck.
2453000	2454000	That's your handwriting right?
2454000	2455000	That is probably my handwriting yes.
2455000	2456000	Loki's handwriting.
2456000	2457000	Detective Pikachu didn't suck.
2457000	2458000	It was.
2458000	2459000	It was great.
2459000	2462500	It was pretty damn good actually as far as video game movies go and gonna get a sequel
2462500	2464000	and I don't think we hate it.
2464000	2466000	So cool.
2466000	2468000	All right.
2468000	2469000	My handwriting.
2469000	2474760	Did they finally get online right with Animal Crossing since they plan to charge for it.
2474760	2475760	Don't know yet.
2475760	2476760	Ask in three months Rob.
2476760	2477760	All right.
2477760	2483000	I told you it was gonna be nothing but Animal Crossing shit in here.
2483000	2484000	Loki's handwriting.
2484000	2486000	New AR gaming console.
2486000	2487000	No.
2487000	2488000	No.
2488000	2489000	No.
2489000	2490000	No.
2490000	2491000	You should have went with cloud.
2491000	2492000	Would have got that.
2492000	2493000	But yeah.
2493000	2494000	Cloud sucks.
2494000	2495000	All right.
2495000	2498000	Next up.
2498000	2499000	My handwriting.
2499000	2500000	Next.
2500000	2503000	Next Xbox announced but no PS5.
2503000	2506000	What was I thinking.
2506000	2510000	Game pass console to hold us over.
2510000	2511000	Nah.
2511000	2512000	Oh.
2512000	2516000	I was thinking there was gonna be a console like dedicated to like digital.
2516000	2523000	I think I was thinking something even smaller than that Xbox One X or whatever.
2523000	2525000	What the hell was on the digital.
2525000	2526000	The digital only.
2526000	2527000	The digital only one.
2527000	2530000	I was thinking a smaller more bare bones version of that.
2530000	2531000	Yeah.
2531000	2532000	Yes.
2532000	2533000	The Xbox sad.
2533000	2534000	Thank you.
2534000	2535000	Oh.
2535000	2536000	Right.
2536000	2539000	As far as I'm like where the hell's dark soccer's handwriting.
2539000	2541000	I think this is it.
2541000	2547000	Amazon's new streaming game service will not overcome steam or the console market.
2547000	2548000	Well.
2548000	2550000	Amazon has a streaming game service.
2550000	2552000	That is true.
2552000	2553000	All right.
2553000	2554000	Next up.
2554000	2556000	I know I remember something about that being in the news.
2556000	2559000	Well I think that this just hasn't happened yet.
2559000	2561000	Replace it with stadium.
2561000	2563000	It's still true.
2563000	2565000	This is my handwriting.
2565000	2566000	Tiger claw.
2566000	2568000	Let's you guys are going to scream.
2568000	2569000	You ready.
2569000	2570000	Tiger call is not.
2570000	2587000	The sonic movie was a bad idea right.
2587000	2589000	Yes as it turns out.
2589000	2592000	But yes it's not as bad of an idea as well.
2592000	2594000	So far it's.
2594000	2595000	It's weird.
2595000	2598000	It's we're not quite sure yet how bad it is.
2598000	2600000	This is why we do the time capsule.
2600000	2602000	That was fucking great.
2602000	2604000	All right.
2604000	2605000	Now what.
2605000	2610000	But but what really comes to that remains to be seen because.
2610000	2613000	Theoretic I think we knew the release date was going to be this year.
2613000	2616000	It was last year but now it's in 2020.
2616000	2618000	So that's really funny.
2618000	2619000	All right.
2619000	2622000	Moving on.
2622000	2623000	I don't know who wrote this.
2623000	2627000	I think this is dark soccer's handwriting with her safest prediction ever.
2627000	2629000	Still no Half-Life 3.
2629000	2632000	Well sort of.
2632000	2636000	Well there's a new Half-Life game.
2636000	2638000	You thought it would be an easy prediction.
2638000	2641000	Turns out it's a little complicated.
2641000	2643000	Loki's handwriting.
2643000	2649000	EA will close BioWare after Anthem underperforms due to EA shittiness.
2649000	2651000	IE loot boxes.
2651000	2653000	I would say you're like three fourths right.
2653000	2656000	There's just one component of this prediction missing.
2656000	2660000	So it should be in the capsule for next year.
2660000	2662000	We're going to put this back in.
2662000	2663000	Yes there's things I'm going to put.
2663000	2666000	Let's keep like a pile of things to put back in the capsule.
2666000	2667000	Still no Half-Life 3.
2667000	2672000	Where was the one about Animal Crossing.
2672000	2675000	Because the one about Animal Crossing needs to go back in as well.
2675000	2676000	Where is it.
2676000	2678000	Online with Animal Crossing.
2678000	2680000	Yeah something about online with Animal Crossing.
2680000	2681000	I can't find it.
2681000	2682000	Gosh darn it.
2682000	2683000	Eh who cares.
2683000	2685000	Wait wait wait wait wait.
2685000	2686000	No.
2686000	2687000	Alright.
2687000	2688000	Never mind.
2688000	2689000	I'll worry about it later.
2689000	2690000	Maybe it fell on the floor when I got up earlier.
2690000	2694000	Okay.
2694000	2695000	Next up.
2695000	2698000	I don't think the year before are in here because we're almost out.
2698000	2700000	Maybe that was the year before last.
2700000	2703000	Loki wrote anticipated games.
2703000	2704000	Crackdown 3.
2704000	2708000	Yeah I anticipated it then I played it and then.
2708000	2710000	That was too bad.
2710000	2711000	Animal Crossing Switch.
2711000	2714000	I told you that's going to be everywhere.
2714000	2715000	Borderlands 3.
2715000	2716000	Yeah that was good.
2716000	2720000	It's like everybody's like last thing they wrote down was the accurate one.
2720000	2721000	So.
2721000	2722000	Alright.
2722000	2723000	Let's see.
2723000	2731000	I think this is Jamie's writing.
2731000	2736000	Nintendo freaks out and goes back to friend codes for all the things.
2736000	2738000	I don't think they did.
2738000	2741000	I'm trying to think if something's close.
2741000	2742000	I don't know.
2742000	2745000	I don't think so because they've actually kind of integrated Facebook and Twitter if
2745000	2747000	you pay for the online thing.
2747000	2749000	So don't think that one panned out.
2749000	2751000	There's only one more in here.
2751000	2753000	It must have been last year that I did that.
2753000	2754000	Alright here it is.
2754000	2757000	The last one.
2757000	2758000	Ooh.
2758000	2763000	Did Sony do a PlayStation event in the fall because of no E3?
2763000	2764000	They did not.
2764000	2765000	No they didn't.
2765000	2766000	But that actually.
2766000	2771000	Let's take that and lead this into a side topic because I don't think it comes up in
2771000	2772000	our news anywhere else.
2772000	2773000	But there's.
2773000	2775000	It's probably because it's the giant rumor category.
2775000	2779000	But this is one of those rumors that Michael Patcher has chimed in on.
2779000	2783000	And the rumor is that Sony plans to skip this year's E3 as well.
2783000	2787000	Meaning that they would not be showing PlayStation 5 at E3 this year.
2787000	2791000	How do you guys feel about that if Sony were to skip E3 this year as well?
2791000	2794000	They'll do their own event.
2794000	2796000	I mean that sucks for E3.
2796000	2798000	But you know they would do their own event.
2798000	2800000	And I don't know if that's a good.
2800000	2803000	You know as much as like they may not have stuff to.
2803000	2808000	I would hope that they'd have something to show because it's just going to be the Microsoft
2808000	2812000	show then if you know they decide that they're not going to go to E3.
2812000	2814000	It'll just be like.
2814000	2815000	Well Nintendo could.
2815000	2816000	Well right.
2816000	2818000	But like I mean that's.
2818000	2819000	I don't know.
2819000	2822000	I don't know what benefit they would have for skipping.
2822000	2825000	Unless they really don't have stuff to show.
2825000	2828000	Which is not good I guess.
2828000	2830000	Especially considering that we're going to be.
2830000	2834000	You know expecting a new console at the end of this year and that's going to get delayed.
2834000	2835000	Who knows.
2835000	2839000	Boy that's a real kick in the pants to E3 and the ESA though.
2839000	2843000	But you know throughout the discussion on Twitter about the topic.
2843000	2847000	One thing that somebody I follow said that I remembered oh this is very true.
2847000	2852000	Do you guys remember that the ESA had all those leaks of people's personal information
2852000	2853000	when it came to the media.
2853000	2854000	Yeah.
2854000	2855000	Do you remember that.
2855000	2858000	What did the ESA say they were going to do about that.
2858000	2863000	I don't remember them saying anything that would be correct.
2863000	2868000	So there's still that whole thing is that this is still an issue that's gone unaddressed
2868000	2870000	and that's not good.
2870000	2875000	And maybe maybe this could sound really harsh and I don't mean to sound like one of those
2875000	2876000	like shitlords on Twitter.
2876000	2882000	But maybe the ESA deserves to fail.
2882000	2883000	I put it out there.
2883000	2884000	Can't take it back.
2884000	2886000	Like maybe that they're just a lobbying group.
2886000	2888000	What are they really doing.
2888000	2893000	Aside from they have the they're they're looking out for the publishers like the big triple
2893000	2894000	A publishers.
2894000	2896000	They're not looking out for the consumers at all.
2896000	2899000	They're just like protecting the people that are paying.
2899000	2900000	They're keeping them afloat.
2900000	2903000	Is the publishers so.
2903000	2904000	Yeah.
2904000	2905000	I don't know.
2905000	2909000	In the past you know we may have seen them as like oh hey you know they're combat.
2909000	2914000	They're going against you know the laws that you're trying to ban violent video games and
2914000	2915000	stuff like that.
2915000	2916000	So that's kind of good.
2916000	2919000	But at the same time they were still just protecting the publishers.
2919000	2920000	They're not.
2920000	2926000	There's you know we need kind of a consumer advocate group that's kind of in the gaming
2926000	2927000	space I think.
2927000	2930000	And I don't think that's the ESA.
2930000	2935000	One of the other rumors out there is that they're trying to bring in Jeff Kealy to basically
2935000	2936000	save E3.
2936000	2938000	But I mean he's already kind of involved.
2938000	2942000	So that isn't necessarily like how is he going to save E3.
2942000	2946000	They are looking to him to basically design a show kind of like he does his award show
2946000	2950000	basically not saying that E3 is going to suddenly become an award show but basically give him
2950000	2953000	a lot more creative control him and his team I guess because you know only one man can
2953000	2954000	only do so much.
2954000	2959000	But you know get put more creative input from him basically.
2959000	2960000	I don't know.
2960000	2961000	I'm just not sure.
2961000	2966000	I mean hey that's not the show that I mean that's not what that show is supposed to be
2966000	2967000	about.
2967000	2968000	Yeah I know.
2968000	2969000	I know.
2969000	2970000	But my how times have changed.
2970000	2974000	But you know the fact that the issues from last year still are going unaddressed and
2974000	2975000	so forth.
2975000	2980000	I think E3 is if it does come out that Sony is not going to bother to go to the show and
2980000	2981000	they're doing their own thing.
2981000	2982000	I mean sure.
2983000	2988000	There still will be an E3 2020 and Microsoft it's going to be free.
2988000	2991000	Well it's not really going to be free but it's going to be you know Microsoft's you
2991000	2993000	know free realm to do things.
2993000	2998000	But if Sony does their own show if they do a PlayStation event they're going to get tons
2998000	2999000	of media coverage.
2999000	3003000	They can invite all the people they need to invite to their own show.
3003000	3010000	I don't know it's going to be some colossal ego energy in a way but I kind of think it
3010000	3011000	would pay off for them.
3011000	3012000	So we'll see.
3012000	3013000	I don't know.
3013000	3018000	That's what a lot of companies do in the tech space nowadays anyway so I wouldn't be surprised
3018000	3022000	if all of this E3 stuff goes away at some point.
3022000	3025000	Bobby Black Wolf does want to point out kind of like a little difference here.
3025000	3030000	Loki and what you were saying a minute ago is that the ESA they're a lobbying group for
3030000	3033000	the AAA publishers and put on a trade show.
3033000	3034000	That's all they do.
3035000	3041000	We have the ECA Entertainment Consumer Association which is the lobbying group for our behalf.
3041000	3043000	They owned game politics dot com.
3043000	3046000	So a little difference between the two side of things.
3046000	3047000	Game politics?
3047000	3049000	Didn't that go away?
3049000	3050000	No.
3050000	3052000	Well he says owned in past tense.
3052000	3053000	Oh yeah.
3053000	3054000	So I missed that site.
3054000	3056000	I freaking loved game politics.
3056000	3059000	We need something like that back.
3059000	3060000	Yeah.
3060000	3061000	So.
3061000	3062000	All right.
3062000	3063000	Well let's move on.
3063000	3065000	We have a trip down memory lane in our time capsule.
3065000	3067000	Let's talk a little bit about our gaming.
3067000	3069000	Now I'm throwing the rest of these in the trash.
3069000	3071000	Are we going to do a new one of these?
3071000	3073000	Yes we will do a new one of these.
3073000	3076000	We're running a little long tonight and I already kind of warned everybody before the
3076000	3077000	show.
3077000	3078000	So we'll probably fill this up.
3078000	3081000	So what we'll do we're going to just come to the show next week with things already
3081000	3082000	written out.
3082000	3083000	Week after next?
3083000	3084000	Or yes.
3084000	3085000	Oh yeah.
3085000	3086000	So housekeeping note.
3086000	3087000	Hello.
3087000	3088000	There is no show next week.
3088000	3089000	No live show.
3089000	3090000	Well there's not going to be any show actually.
3090000	3091000	He's not going to tape anything either.
3091000	3092000	You will be out.
3092000	3093000	He will be out.
3093000	3095000	Literally nobody will be here in Sacramento.
3095000	3098000	Well I'll be in Sacramento but nowhere near the studio.
3098000	3102000	Well and I will be at the women's march in San Francisco.
3102000	3103000	I will be in face.
3103000	3107000	So if you want to look for Sister Hava which is me.
3107000	3109000	I will be out there with the San Francisco sisters.
3109000	3111000	Come say hi and march with us.
3111000	3113000	I'll be driving to Disneyland.
3113000	3115000	Broccoli farm.
3115000	3118000	I wanted to make those t-shirts.
3118000	3119000	Someday.
3119000	3125000	Next Sunday is Alan and I's third wedding anniversary on the 19th but we're actually
3125000	3127000	also celebrating 10 years together.
3127000	3132000	So we just passed 10 years as boyfriends or whatever you want to call it was January
3132000	3133000	4th.
3133000	3134000	Dan and I do that.
3134000	3136000	Do you know that mine and Dan's 21st.
3136000	3137000	Wow.
3137000	3138000	Will be.
3138000	3140000	Is it 21st or 22nd?
3140000	3144000	I really can't brain but it will be the 23rd of this month.
3144000	3145000	Yeah.
3145000	3149000	Which means roughly half of my life has been lived in California.
3149000	3152000	Well we're very lucky to have you.
3152000	3153000	So yeah.
3153000	3155000	Alan and I are going to see a play.
3155000	3156000	So we're going to get our musical.
3156000	3158000	We're going to see Dear Evan Hansen because it's touring.
3158000	3159000	It's going to be here.
3159000	3160000	So we're doing that that night.
3160000	3162000	Maybe a nice dinner or something.
3162000	3163000	So yeah.
3163000	3164000	Just everybody's going to be gone.
3164000	3166000	Bobby Black Wolf will be holding down the fort here at Twitch.
3166000	3168000	So for those of you I mean you guys can still tune in.
3168000	3171000	Bobby will probably maybe run a little longer than usual.
3171000	3173000	Maybe that'll be the week you can finally get Tommy on his show.
3173000	3174000	And you can run really long.
3174000	3175000	We'll see.
3175000	3176000	But yeah.
3176000	3180000	So VOG will still be on next week just we will not be here next week.
3180000	3181000	So we'll be back in two weeks.
3181000	3185000	And at that time we will fill the time capsule with new predictions.
3185000	3189000	We can have it all written out already so we're not spending time writing.
3189000	3191000	Because that took forever the last time we did this.
3191000	3192000	I remember that.
3192000	3193000	So.
3193000	3194000	All right.
3194000	3195000	So there you go.
3195000	3196000	There's the time capsule.
3196000	3198000	Now it's time to throw these in the garbage.
3198000	3199000	All right.
3199000	3203000	Let's move on to our gaming weeks and talk about the types of games that we have been
3203000	3204000	playing this week.
3204000	3205000	Dark Soccer.
3205000	3207000	How was your gaming week?
3207000	3210000	Well minimal given everything else we've been going through.
3210000	3214000	But Dan and I did watch as much of AGDQ as we could.
3214000	3218000	I was a little sad they didn't make Pi Million.
3218000	3220000	Which was the last goal.
3220000	3224000	But still it was great seeing everything that all of those amazing runners did.
3224000	3227000	I loved the Impossible Super Metroid run.
3227000	3228000	That was amazing.
3228000	3230000	What's the Impossible Super Metroid run?
3230000	3234000	It's a mod of Super Metroid that's even harder with some of the things moved around.
3234000	3238000	You don't get the Varia suit until after you beat Ridley.
3238000	3239000	For example.
3239000	3245000	Mother Brain in each aspect of each of the different segments takes anywhere between
3245000	3248000	100 to 150 shots.
3248000	3250000	So it's pretty crazy.
3250000	3256000	It was a really difficult run to watch but really amazing how tight this guy was in playing.
3256000	3259000	Oats and Goats was the runner.
3259000	3260000	Really amazing.
3260000	3263000	Do they have a Kaizo Super Metroid?
3263000	3264000	Because that would be hilarious.
3264000	3267000	This is kind of I think Kaizo Super Metroid.
3267000	3269000	It's really freaking hard.
3269000	3274000	But as far as what I played I did a little bit more of What the Golf.
3274000	3276000	I freaking love it on iOS.
3276000	3277000	It's so easy to play.
3277000	3278000	I mean and frustrating.
3278000	3279000	Because the cars.
3279000	3282000	The cars pissed me off so much.
3282000	3283000	Yeah.
3284000	3286000	And I have been playing Pokemon Go.
3286000	3288000	I've been playing Harry Potter.
3288000	3294000	I've also started playing the Rilakkuma farming game thanks to my friend Mari.
3294000	3300000	It's basically just one of those stupid little farm sim games but with Rilakkuma instead.
3300000	3302000	What else was I playing?
3302000	3305000	I'm also still playing Patterned.
3305000	3307000	It's just so relaxing to me.
3307000	3312000	It's one of the games that I'll have the music on when I'm playing it at home.
3312000	3317000	And I've got the Mac version and iOS version because I'm doing it through Apple Arcade.
3317000	3320000	But thankfully my levels don't cross over for that game.
3320000	3322000	So I can keep doing.
3322000	3327000	And the levels play a little bit differently on a computer versus how they play on iPhone.
3327000	3329000	I've been vastly enjoying Patterned.
3329000	3337000	It's been my little moment of zen while I've been so overwhelmed with all the crazytude in the house.
3338000	3344000	And I've also been playing a lot of Animal Crossing Pocket Camp just because
3344000	3346000	Oh my god I want my Animal Crossing!
3346000	3352000	Dan and I talked about getting a Switch Lite for me so we don't have to take my Switch out of the house.
3352000	3358000	So I can play and he's like, well I'm sure there's going to be an Animal Crossing edition of the Switch Lite and blah blah blah.
3358000	3362000	I'm like, you realize that this is the month.
3362000	3364000	It's had me out the month before my birthday.
3364000	3367000	And this is going to probably be my birthday present.
3367000	3369000	So yes, all the things yes.
3374000	3376000	Other than that though, it's just really my usual.
3376000	3379000	I haven't had a thought to play anything else.
3379000	3384000	Because instead of playing our systems at home, we were watching AGDQ.
3387000	3389000	The Super Metroid front was freaking amazing though.
3389000	3391000	Yeah, I saw a little bit of that. Just a little bit though.
3391000	3392000	By the way.
3392000	3393000	Honk!
3394000	3396000	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
3396000	3398000	It was all Orna.
3398000	3400000	That's basically it. I played Orna.
3400000	3401000	What level are you now?
3401000	3402000	I'm 100.
3402000	3403000	Oh wow, look at you.
3403000	3405000	Yeah, so two weeks.
3405000	3407000	Took two while I get there.
3407000	3411000	And now I have to figure out what specialization I'm going to pick now.
3411000	3413000	Because I have that option.
3413000	3415000	But it costs too much.
3416000	3420000	So yeah, now I assume it's going to be much slower.
3420000	3423000	Because now they've unlocked a whole new set of enemies I have to fight.
3423000	3425000	That are way more powerful than I am now.
3425000	3430000	Whereas everything I was just trashing everything in my path up until 100.
3430000	3435000	And you have to really walk to find stuff too.
3435000	3437000	Like that's what happens as you kill things.
3437000	3439000	Then they respawn with other mobs.
3439000	3441000	They're usually more powerful than you.
3441000	3443000	And so you really have to walk to get new stuff to spawn.
3444000	3447000	I've been kind of doing that stuff as well.
3447000	3450000	I've been trying to do the daily quest things that they have.
3450000	3452000	But it can be hard sometimes.
3452000	3457000	Especially when it seems like the mobs that they want you to kill don't spawn as often on those days.
3457000	3459000	So I've been trying to do that.
3459000	3461000	And even just the basic stuff.
3461000	3464000	Like the main storyline quests that they have that you do.
3464000	3469000	Because it's like, okay, you need to kill hobgoblins.
3469000	3471000	Well cool, I've killed millions of hobgoblins.
3471000	3476000	Except they're hobgoblin mages, hobgoblin knights, hobgoblin this.
3476000	3479000	And it's not just plain old hobgoblins.
3479000	3482000	You have to specifically kill that.
3482000	3490000	And so I'm level 100 and I'm still not even done with these tutorial missions or whatever.
3492000	3494000	I don't know, I've been doing a lot of the arena stuff.
3494000	3499000	Because arenas you get about 45,000 experience each thing you fight.
3499000	3501000	And they're pretty easy.
3501000	3505000	So I've been just doing those and burning through those as quickly as I can.
3507000	3509000	Yeah, so that's been my week basically.
3509000	3512000	I get murdered in those, my gear's not good enough or something.
3512000	3515000	And I've been trying to use, that's why I finally built a blacksmith here.
3515000	3517000	So I can just deposit.
3517000	3520000	In fact I put stuff in before the show started tonight that'll be done by the time the show's over.
3520000	3523000	Yeah, I do that each night when I go to bed.
3523000	3526000	Drop stuff off and then pick up my dry cleaning in the morning.
3526000	3528000	Yeah, exactly.
3528000	3530000	Alright, lots of orna.
3530000	3531000	Let's see, my gaming week.
3531000	3535000	I've been playing a little bit of Pokemon Sword and Shield because of some of the news that came out this week.
3535000	3540000	For the first time I finally, finally, finally got around to playing Untitled Goose Game.
3540000	3544000	I'm going to admit I didn't get into it as much as the rest of you have.
3544000	3547000	And sorry if I come off like sounding like a hater, but I don't know.
3547000	3550000	Well I want to put something into context too because this is very important.
3550000	3553000	It would help you understand maybe why I'm just like, I was very like kind of,
3553000	3556000	I don't get it as much as like everybody else.
3556000	3564000	Alan and I, after the show last week, we ate something that gave us the most horrific food poisoning
3564000	3569000	I have ever had in my entire life in the middle of the day on Monday.
3569000	3574000	So we were sick Monday night, Tuesday, like it was so bad.
3574000	3580000	I actually called my health provider to be like, do I need to come to the hospital because,
3580000	3583000	or actually Alan had to call them because I couldn't form coherent sentences.
3583000	3585000	It was that bad and he's sick.
3585000	3587000	So it's, it was bad.
3587000	3588000	I'm fine now.
3588000	3591000	Obviously I'm sitting here doing the show and snacking away on pretzels here.
3591000	3592000	So everything's fine.
3592000	3595000	But that was the worst I have ever had it.
3595000	3597000	That was so, so horrible.
3597000	3603000	So I think I finally played Untitled Goose Game about Wednesday when my body is finally like starting to like,
3603000	3608000	like stop being horrific and start to get some sense of normalcy again.
3608000	3610000	But I just feel so like exhausted.
3610000	3611000	But I was so bored.
3611000	3613000	I was like, I need something to do.
3613000	3619000	So, uh, yeah, so I, that is the context in which I finally got around to playing Untitled Goose Game.
3619000	3622000	So to be fair, I wasn't in the best of moods.
3622000	3627000	So this is probably why the game didn't land super well with me, but I was just kind of like annoyed.
3627000	3632000	I was having such a hard time figuring out how to solve some of the very first puzzles,
3632000	3634000	which I would assume are supposed to be some of the easiest stuff.
3634000	3638000	So I was just, you know, getting annoyed with it really easy.
3638000	3640000	So that was it.
3640000	3645000	I mean, I get, I get why though it is, it's a very different type of game.
3645000	3647000	You know, you don't see that type of thing a lot.
3647000	3648000	Yeah, exactly.
3648000	3650000	The goose does make a really funny mascot.
3650000	3651000	I just like playing an asshole.
3651000	3652000	Yeah, no, I get it. I get it.
3652000	3655000	So there is a good boundary break on that one, by the way.
3655000	3656000	Oh, is there?
3656000	3657000	Yeah.
3657000	3662000	I'm just showing that like some of the scenes where you don't see the goose, it's still doing stuff.
3662000	3668000	There's actually things going on in the houses and everything that, you know, it's not just effect happening.
3668000	3670000	It's legit going on in the game.
3670000	3678000	I tried to, so when I was trying to figure out like what, where is this particular item that I need?
3678000	3685000	I found a river and I swam all the way down the river and I could see all these different areas that must be like coming up in the future.
3685000	3689000	And finally it ended and I was able to go up onto something and that was like it,
3689000	3692000	but it was weird that I could even get that far down the river.
3692000	3694000	It was so strange.
3694000	3697000	So, but yeah, that was, that was what it was.
3697000	3701000	As far as like, oh, so the chat is wondering, Swanton wants to know what did I eat?
3701000	3702000	Here's the weird thing.
3702000	3703000	Food.
3703000	3710000	We still kind of can't put together because Alan made spaghetti and meatballs here at home, which so obviously you blame the meatballs, right?
3710000	3715000	But they were those type of like prepackaged frozen ones that are pre-cooked and then he cooked them again.
3715000	3718000	So I know it doesn't, it doesn't make a lot of sense.
3718000	3725000	And the doctor, so I finally did talk to a doctor in urgent care because the way you and I have the same health care providers.
3725000	3727000	So the way they work, cause I was like, can I come into urgent care?
3727000	3728000	Can I come into urgent care?
3728000	3730000	And I'm like, we need to call you.
3730000	3735000	I usually go to, they don't, they do not advertise very well where the urgent care is.
3735000	3736000	I know right where mine is.
3736000	3737000	Okay.
3737000	3738000	I'm going to get the details of that.
3738000	3740000	Haven't forbid that ever happens to me again.
3740000	3744000	Well, just FYI South SAC urgent care opens at three o'clock.
3744000	3745000	That's good.
3745000	3746000	And it's open every day.
3746000	3747000	Okay.
3747000	3748000	That's good to know.
3748000	3751000	But anyway, um, so I, uh, where was I?
3751000	3753000	Oh, I talked to the doctor and the doctor was like, you know,
3753000	3761000	it sounds like it might actually be viral because I don't think what you guys ate sounds like it's something that could have been capable of giving you such, you know, horrible food poisoning.
3761000	3765000	Um, so it's still, it's kind of a mystery in some ways.
3765000	3774000	Um, now we had gone to a nice brunch at a nice country club place earlier in the day with some mutual friends.
3774000	3780000	And so we were kind of quick to think, Oh, those types of things, buffets are usually like prime.
3780000	3781000	That's where it came from.
3781000	3786000	But this was a really nice place and not the type of thing that's going to have code violations.
3786000	3789000	I mean, everybody makes mistakes, but none of our friends got sick.
3789000	3804000	Your reaction though, and I was thinking this earlier, just, you know, I was too kind of in stuff is definitely though, makes me think more of gastroenteritis than, um, than food poisoning because of how dehydrated you got.
3804000	3805000	Oh my gosh.
3805000	3806000	I got so dehydrated.
3806000	3808000	That's why my fever was so high.
3808000	3813000	And what I had it really bad and I had, this was when I was a kid, but I had it for about two weeks.
3813000	3821000	I lost 20 pounds as a teenager, which is a lot when you're a teenager and was roughly in the same state that you described yourself.
3821000	3826000	So I'm glad you're over it by now, but it does sound like you had maybe a 48 hour bug.
3826000	3827000	So weird.
3827000	3828000	So weird.
3828000	3836000	But anyway, one thing I will say, I'm going to say this, and I know this isn't directly about games, but this is just a good life tip because this is something I learned throughout the whole ordeal.
3836000	3839000	Cause the problem was Alan and I were sick at the same time.
3839000	3842000	So we couldn't really like help each other out a lot.
3842000	3845000	Now he, he didn't get it as bad as I did.
3845000	3849000	Um, I also eight seconds on Sunday, so I kind of blame that on everything.
3849000	3857000	But anyway, my point is, you know, when you're super dehydrated, the best thing to do is to drink something like Gatorade, something with electrolytes, right?
3857000	3860000	Something to kind of get all that back in your system.
3860000	3862000	Well, we don't just keep Gatorade around the house.
3862000	3865000	So I would really advise people to do one of two things.
3865000	3872000	Have Gatorade available, put it in your pantry, like just have it in a place that that's, that shit never goes bad.
3872000	3874000	Mio, keep the squirty stuff.
3874000	3877000	Or that, or this is what I was gonna say, cause this really did the trick.
3877000	3882000	They sell a, you know how like, um, not crystal light, but crystal light comes in those powder things.
3882000	3885000	They sell Propel in little powdered packets.
3885000	3887000	Pedial light also.
3887000	3888000	Oh, does Pedial light come in packets?
3888000	3896000	They have Pedial, not the powder one. It's kind of a gross like liquid thing, but it does, it's a great rehydrator.
3896000	3897000	Trust me.
3897000	3898000	Pedial light is the bomb.
3898000	3900000	It can't be as gross as being sick.
3900000	3904000	So my advice to everybody, have an emergency supply of something.
3904000	3907000	Pick the brand of your choice with electrolytes.
3907000	3910000	Have an emergency supply of it on hand, just in case.
3910000	3916000	That's especially if you live alone, especially, you know, even if you do live with a partner or something.
3916000	3919000	There's no telling if both of you are gonna get sick at the same time.
3919000	3920000	So anyway.
3920000	3924000	Wow, I totally got on a tangent with that.
3924000	3929000	Oh, DJ Rama S in chat says Pedial light, a must have when you're out con drinking.
3929000	3933000	I'm pretty sure Dragon Con, most people I've seen have a stock of it on hand as well.
3933000	3935000	So it's smart to have.
3935000	3938000	But I think even the powdered stuff, cause that's so much, you know, water's heavy.
3938000	3941000	You can't always carry that around, but like, I'm gonna do that now.
3941000	3945000	When I go to Dragon Con, I'm gonna take that tiny little box of powder Propel and just keep it with me.
3945000	3948000	Like how it's, it's super easy and convenient.
3948000	3951000	So anyway, I keep a little bottle of meal when I travel.
3951000	3954000	Yeah, I guess I didn't even think of meal, but I guess that would work too for sure.
3954000	3956000	So perfect.
3956000	3957000	Anyway.
3957000	3958000	So where were we?
3958000	3959000	Yes.
3959000	3961000	Not just cause I need a sassy gay friend.
3961000	3962000	Gaming weeks.
3962000	3963000	Hello.
3963000	3968000	So don't play a fun game like untitled goose game when you don't feel fun because it'll affect your opinions on it.
3968000	3971000	But otherwise I played it way too much Final Fantasy 14.
3971000	3973000	What else is new?
3973000	3974000	So let's move on.
3974000	3976000	Let's get into some gaming news finally.
3976000	3978000	Let's talk about what's been going on in the headlines.
3978000	3982000	And, uh, yeah, it's nice to, it's nice to be back to normal in the news cycle.
3982000	3986000	Cause the past couple of weeks have been all holidays, holidays, but here we are 2020.
3986000	3987000	Here we go.
3987000	3991000	Looking at the new consoles and what they're going to bring and all that good stuff, right Loki?
3991000	3999000	2020 party in like it's 2006 though, with Microsoft, a rumor at least about Microsoft's new console, the Xbox Series X.
3999000	4009000	Stating that there may be a windows mode in the console where you can actually run it like a PC, which allow you to access the steam and Epic game store platforms.
4009000	4025000	So you could essentially use this like a PC in the sense that you could use the PlayStation three as a Linux machine for a brief moment in time until they decided that was an avenue for people to hack the system.
4025000	4027000	And then, you know, we know how that went.
4027000	4033000	Um, interesting to see if this ends up being a thing, but who knows?
4033000	4037000	I mean, it sounds plausible, I guess.
4037000	4047000	I would be surprised though, like if that is actually a thing, because I think that one of the things they were trying to do with like, especially the windows store is have a lot of these universal apps.
4047000	4050000	So you'd be able to do some productivity stuff on there.
4050000	4056000	And I would be willing to bet that like, if it's a windows mode, like, I don't know.
4056000	4059000	I just can't imagine Microsoft outlook on my Xbox.
4059000	4065000	I just can't imagine like someone buying an Xbox Series X to do like Excel on that.
4065000	4071000	This just who would have thought the military would have bought PlayStation threes to do some of their most intentional.
4071000	4073000	Right. But that's because of the processor that's inside of it.
4073000	4077000	I mean, I true it's like, God, I need a strong processor for that Excel spreadsheet.
4077000	4081000	You know, um, I mean, I guess I could see something like that.
4081000	4083000	Maybe they could do that.
4083000	4089000	I just don't know. I'd be a little skeptical to see if it can run the epic game store and that kind of stuff.
4089000	4092000	But who knows? Maybe someone will hack it to do that.
4092000	4095000	But I guess we'll have to wait and see.
4095000	4109000	It would be very perceptive of Phil Spencer and the rest of the Xbox team if they've kind of noticed that, you know, when PlayStation three got rid of the other OS thing, it was not super well received by a lot of people.
4109000	4116000	And, you know, maybe when you hear that, oh, the military was buying these machines to use and so forth for their, you know, specific needs.
4116000	4121000	It would be very interesting if they've put a Windows mode into this.
4121000	4124000	And obviously I don't see them doing any OS like Unix or whatever.
4124000	4126000	I mean, I guess anything's possible, but I just don't see it.
4126000	4134000	But it'd be very interesting if there is a Windows boot mode for these things that you could run, you know, whether it's limited to universal Windows apps or things like that.
4134000	4138000	It would be very interesting if if that was something that these boxes offered.
4138000	4153000	But I could I could see that be a more interesting prospect for things you can do with your Xbox other than the Xbox one's message of TV, TV sport or like to the sense that this Windows mode in there.
4153000	4161000	Like I know that, you know, the Xbox is now looking at this whole Xbox cloud platform and streaming.
4161000	4168000	I know with the Xbox one X, I think a lot of that streaming, you're actually streaming games from your console to your phone.
4168000	4171000	So what if they see that as, hey, you know what?
4171000	4175000	Productivity wise, we could have you stream your console to your phone.
4175000	4179000	But instead of playing games on there, you could be answering emails.
4179000	4185000	You could be putting together a spreadsheet, typing up a word document or something like that.
4185000	4189000	So you could do some of that as well and then go to gaming.
4189000	4201000	Maybe that's something that they're thinking about doing to kind of help boost that platform, because I think maybe making some money from these live was at the.
4201000	4206000	The Office 365 subscriptions or something like that might be something that they're interested in as well.
4206000	4208000	We'll see in chat.
4208000	4216000	Bobby Black Wolf says, to be fair, the Xbox one can use just about any UWP app, which I think is universal Windows platform, right?
4216000	4217000	Yeah.
4217000	4219000	There are Reddit apps on the Xbox one.
4219000	4220000	I don't even think of that.
4220000	4224000	I mean, technically you can run Microsoft Edge on your Xbox one.
4224000	4229000	I don't know why you would, because none of the websites look like anyone would use edge for any reason.
4229000	4231000	But it's there.
4232000	4237000	Bobby also points out, I could release a VOG app for Xbox one if I really wanted to.
4237000	4240000	Well, now you've nominated yourself.
4240000	4242000	Well, I mean, but you have to.
4242000	4244000	This stream runs through Twitch.
4244000	4249000	I mean, it would have been different if this was still a shout cast thing and shout cast being a more open platform.
4249000	4251000	You know, it would have been a lot different.
4251000	4253000	Basically, he would be writing a very specific version of TuneIn.
4253000	4254000	Right.
4254000	4258000	But now that we're not there or on Twitch, I don't really know if that same logic would apply.
4258000	4262000	It's just kind of like we just tell people, well, just make sure you follow us and use the Twitch app, you know?
4262000	4263000	Yeah.
4263000	4265000	So I think there's that.
4265000	4273000	But but, you know, but I mean, to be fair, a dedicated app could still be used for podcasts, catching up on back episodes and things like that.
4273000	4276000	We could feed it exclusive content.
4276000	4279000	I don't know what the fuck we'd put on it that we're not doing already on these shows.
4279000	4285000	But, you know, I guess we could do what all the other podcasters do and do special mini episodes that are just.
4285000	4290000	But I'm like, dudes, we do a three and I use that as a universal term.
4290000	4299000	Dudes, we do a three hour podcast every week, like all the random shit we would do in a sideshow is already in this show.
4299000	4301000	This show is bloated as fuck.
4301000	4303000	What else do you want?
4303000	4305000	You can't do more random stuff.
4305000	4307000	This show is already random.
4307000	4308000	The special show.
4308000	4309000	Oh my God, that's going to be my new line.
4309000	4311000	We're like the Keith Richards of topics.
4311000	4312000	Next time.
4312000	4313000	Next time.
4313000	4314000	He's done all the drugs.
4314000	4315000	All the topics.
4315000	4320000	Next time I'm on a fucking podcast panel and they're like, or they say like, your show should be an hour.
4320000	4322000	You should be an hour and 20 minutes.
4322000	4324000	And they're like, why is your show three hours long?
4324000	4331000	I'm going to be like, because all that shit y'all put on Patreon and charge people for, we just put it on our main show.
4331000	4332000	Now what?
4332000	4333000	Now what?
4336000	4339000	And then I'll get escorted off the stage, but I'll have made my point.
4340000	4345000	Hey, we've done three hour shows for ages and guess what?
4345000	4346000	Bitches, we're still here.
4346000	4347000	That's true.
4347000	4348000	We are.
4348000	4349000	Who's got the longevity?
4349000	4350000	That would be us.
4350000	4351000	Yeah.
4351000	4354000	The thing is the rest of you care about ratings.
4354000	4360000	We were doing this show and no one was listening and we're still doing this show and no one's listening.
4360000	4361000	We have a few people.
4361000	4362000	We have a few people.
4362000	4363000	We sure do.
4363000	4364000	All right.
4364000	4365000	All right.
4365000	4369000	Anyway, Bobby Black, Wolf and Chat says, I will give you a standing ovation.
4369000	4370000	Thank you, Bobby.
4370000	4371000	This is why we were-
4371000	4372000	I remember someone legit gave me a dollar.
4372000	4373000	This is why we worked together so well.
4373000	4375000	I do remember someone gave you a dollar.
4375000	4376000	I know who it is too.
4377000	4378000	All right.
4378000	4380000	Anyway, where were we?
4380000	4382000	Oh yes, the Xbox Series X.
4382000	4383000	Yes.
4384000	4393000	How about, okay, so we actually, funny enough, we tangented into other OS and all this stuff, but let's go back to the point of the Steam store and the Epic store.
4393000	4403000	Now, see, I could also see this as Microsoft trying to play off any concerns of a monopoly because there might be concerns of anti-competitiveness.
4403000	4406000	So if there was a way that you could access these stores-
4406000	4419000	But I wouldn't see that this would be a problem though, because I mean, we exist in a world that Apple has one platform for selling products within their device, their devices that they have.
4419000	4421000	So I don't know.
4421000	4424000	I don't think that would be necessarily a problem on a console.
4424000	4427000	It's not like a PC where we're locking you down.
4427000	4429000	You can only buy stuff from this.
4429000	4433000	Well, what's interesting, Apple's kind of been called out on that in the past.
4433000	4441000	And I have a feeling, I don't know any of this, but I have a feeling this could be why they went back and they split up iTunes the way they did.
4441000	4450000	Now they have the music app and the podcast app because technically, yes, you can use Apple podcast app to listen to this, but you can use Spotify.
4450000	4453000	You can use iHeartRadio.
4453000	4455000	You can use other podcast apps.
4455000	4460000	Yes, you can use the music app to pay for and get music, but you can use Pandora.
4461000	4475000	So I have a feeling exactly what you're talking about right there might be why Apple had split some of that up previously so that that chatter would hopefully dissipate a little bit because they can say there is competition in these other places.
4475000	4480000	We do have other places you could buy TV shows and Amazon and stuff on our platform in addition to our own.
4480000	4485000	It'll be interesting to see what they do with it, if it even exists.
4485000	4491000	I'm, you know, I'm not knocking any more functionality for a device, so why not?
4491000	4493000	Fair enough.
4493000	4498000	All right, well, let's move on and talk about the Consumer Electronics Show, which happened this past weekend.
4498000	4501000	Not usually a gigantic gaming event.
4501000	4504000	We got little bits of well, there's still exciting stuff.
4504000	4513000	Yeah, there is. And especially if you're a collector, I think all the big news that I saw was really about we have some other little headlines later, but I think a lot of the big headlines I saw was about collectibles.
4513000	4518000	So including one of the biggest collectible makers right now is Arcade One Up, who makes those.
4518000	4519000	They're just on a roll, man.
4519000	4524000	They are on a roll. They are. Yeah, they are Ashley O on a roll, that's for sure.
4524000	4528000	Arcade One Up is doing an online enabled NBA Jam cabinet.
4528000	4535000	So this is going to be their first one that actually you can play against your friend's NBA Jam cabinet in another state thanks to the magical Wi-Fi.
4535000	4538000	That's pretty cool.
4538000	4545000	Even when you think like this is like really basic, like low level Xbox Live type of implementation.
4545000	4550000	But it's still kind of neat to see that in an authentic cabinet, authentic collector thing.
4550000	4554000	I think that's a really exciting type of thing, actually. That's cool.
4554000	4557000	There's also yes, I am well aware and this is near and dear to my heart.
4557000	4563000	And you can actually see this is it's probably hard to make out on the Twitch feed for those that are watching the video.
4563000	4567000	But I actually have my little this is a Burger Time arcade machine.
4567000	4572000	This is in the My Arcade series, which we'll talk about them as well, because they have news as well coming out.
4572000	4574000	But there's that little machine.
4574000	4579000	We see we can actually kind of hit the start so you can actually run through the game, although that is not going to come through.
4579000	4582000	You can hear it, though, a little bit.
4582000	4585000	But yeah, so it actually you play a game.
4585000	4588000	So they're actually putting out a full size Burger Time cabinet.
4588000	4591000	Arcade one up is. So I think that's kind of cool for sure.
4591000	4595000	Can you imagine like telling someone the 80s? Hey, yeah, you know what?
4595000	4601000	Remember, remember how they had those Coleco arcade little things that you could buy that were kind of like cheap, cheap.
4601000	4606000	I mean, at the time it was the best they could do, but it was like cheap, like the LED bird.
4606000	4612000	Yeah, cheap, cheap interpretations of the games like, no, you're actually going to get the full arcade hardware running on one of these.
4612000	4617000	I mean, someone just blow their goddamn minds. Yeah, I think it's one of the people have emulated those now.
4617000	4624000	I really want the Burger Time cab, but I just the the cost is a little bit up there and I just I can't justify the cost right now.
4624000	4631000	They charge it for it. Three ninety nine, three ninety nine. But then you have to consider there's tax and you have to consider their shipping, which they can bring to stores.
4631000	4636000	No, they're only it's limited edition. They're only doing three thousand prints and it's only through their stores.
4636000	4640000	You can't even do it through Amazon to get like price or something. Yeah, I know it stinks.
4640000	4644000	So so it's really more like five hundred dollars if you want to buy this cabinet. So I don't know.
4644000	4648000	I'm still kind of on the fence, but I'm worried it'll be sold out by the time I'm finally ready to commit.
4648000	4653000	So we'll see. I'll probably decide in the next few days. Of course, all this news came out again while I was heeled over.
4653000	4664000	In pain. Other things that arcade went up announced a pinball partnership with Zen Studios to include titles from Bali Williams and other big, big names in the pinball space.
4664000	4670000	That's pretty exciting. So now we're going to have arcade one up pinball tables. So I'm assuming those will be kind of miniature sized as well.
4670000	4676000	It's a three quarter scale. Yeah. And I'm just going to use it probably just be the screen tilted a little bit.
4676000	4680000	So probably be kind of like the cabinets are today, but with the screen tilted. That's my guess. I don't know.
4680000	4687000	I haven't I haven't seen these machines myself yet, so be interesting. They're also talking about a sit down style Star Wars cabinet.
4687000	4693000	So that's kind of cool, except don't I'm hearing Bobby talked about this a little bit on his show.
4693000	4699000	I guess he saw some videos and stuff. It's kind of like it's like a bench with the screen there. It's not like the full enclosed casing.
4699000	4707000	Oh, man. We can build that yourself if you really want. But you know, I want since we're talking about like, you know, dream stuff.
4707000	4718000	Sure. I want arcade one up to start doing like the racing games, like Rush, like California Speed. Anything's possible.
4718000	4726000	I want a driving cabinet. Can I get an arcade one up driving cabinet, please? I guess sit down driving cabinet. Not necessarily full size.
4726000	4733000	I'll take a three quarter scale or whatever. They're also doing a new Frogger cabinet, which will have time. No one wants that.
4734000	4740000	I love time pilot, though. I would only want Frogger if I can play the roller skates.
4740000	4751000	I'm trying to make Frogger happen, Konami. And then there's going to be a Sega Golden Axe cabinet with Golden Axe, Shinobi, Altered Beast, Wrestle Wars.
4751000	4758000	But for the first time, Golden Axe, the Revenge of Death Adder. I guess it's not been released like this before. So that's pretty darn cool.
4759000	4765000	So, yeah, they unveiled all sorts of stuff. That's all from arcade one up. Now, there's other companies getting in this business, too.
4765000	4777000	There's one called II Arcade with two small eyes and arcade. This is a cabinet that you can put in the little reduced size like the arcade one ups a little bit.
4777000	4785000	And apparently what this is, is that you hook this up and then you download whatever games you want legally.
4785000	4794000	So this is basically trying to bring a purchase model smart into it. Yeah, it is a little like it's like, do I really want to pay one hundred fifty dollars?
4794000	4801000	I mean, if you want to have like that collection, like an arcade collection, I get it. Yeah. I mean, I have the room and the money.
4801000	4809000	Sure. Why not? I'll fill my house with that stuff. But like, if you don't have the room or the money, this I think is a pretty decent option.
4809000	4820000	Yeah. So it's going to run on a special arcade OS, a customized operating system. And you'll be able to basically buy games that they are working with to be able to install on this as well.
4820000	4829000	And I think they're talking about making different types, different shapes. So maybe like a cocktail cabinet and stuff like that. Cool. Who knows? I think that'd be very cool.
4829000	4843000	And then I had one more bit about these actual little my arcade cabinets, the small ones that I've got here. They are going to be doing a Street Fighter two championship edition player as well.
4843000	4850000	I think that's pretty cool. That's going to be hard to play. Well, apparently it's something that is actually going to be multiplayer as well.
4850000	4854000	I thought I heard that was the thing so that you could actually. Yeah, you can connect it.
4854000	4860000	So these things actually have little hookups in the back and you can connect two machines together and play against each other. Yeah, that's cool.
4860000	4870000	That's pretty cool, huh? So, yeah, that's that's one thing that will be available. And then there is a super retro champ console, which is, I guess, I saw that.
4870000	4884000	So that's kind of cool looking. Yeah. So that's basically it's this new like portable retro system that can use either SNES or Genesis cartridges or Mega Drive cartridges.
4884000	4892000	So they have like a cartridge slot in the top and a cartridge slot in the bottom. And then there's a screen and it kind of has your usual like, you know, four button setup or whatever.
4893000	4899000	That looked pretty cool. And I guess other things they had recently announced, I didn't even know were out there. There's a Space Invaders player. There's a Contra player as well.
4899000	4908000	I didn't even know there was a Contra Contra. Yeah, I'd be down for Contra. And I believe this is the company that has the Bubble Bobble ones right now, too.
4908000	4916000	I'm trying to actually look at their catalog to see what they have. Contra out because I need to get the Contra cabinet.
4916000	4923000	I'm looking on their website right now so you can actually look at my arcade gaming dot com. Yeah, there's Bubble Bobble and there's Rolling Thunder, too, which I thought was pretty cool.
4923000	4930000	And Elevator Actions. There's like all these games. They have a Mappy one. When did that come? Oh, wait. No. Hello. I have the Mappy one.
4930000	4934000	Shows you how much my brain. Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I think I have that one.
4934000	4940000	I was going to say there's Heavy Barrel, Caveman Ninja, Bad Dudes. Yes, there's just there's so many of them.
4940000	4946000	The other set that's out, apparently there's a Spy Hunter that Dan wants me to go hunting down. Geez.
4946000	4956000	So these things are just blowing up. These little mini retro, you know, whether it be teeny tiny $30 or $40 ones or these, you know, larger $400 ones.
4956000	4966000	Like, you know, collecting these is really big right now. And this trend is going to be continuing if this year's CES is any indication. So stay tuned.
4966000	4970000	All right. Meanwhile, moving on to another story, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
4970000	4980000	Well, I'm sorry, I was actually looking at the game now. So Microsoft has implemented something called Project Artemis.
4980000	4993000	What it is, it's a tool for their chat that scans all of the text conversations and rates them on the probability that a user might be trying to sexually exploit children.
4993000	5003000	It is also then reviewed by human moderators to review the flight conversations and see if they are something that needs to be reported to law enforcement.
5003000	5020000	So they are apparently to be implementing this on Xbox. And it looks like they're also going to be offering it up to nonprofits and other gaming and messaging service developers to help prevent the exploitation of children.
5020000	5030000	And this is, of course, coming right on the heels of COPPA, which that in itself is problematic. But we'll see what becomes of it.
5030000	5044000	If only they had something so good for people who harass women on the Internet, wickedly glaring at every video game chat that exists in the universe.
5044000	5054000	You know, or all these little toxic small penis males out there who want women to not have a voice.
5054000	5060000	So do you think we're going to maybe in 2020 see our first arrest from use of this technology?
5060000	5064000	I hope so. Yeah, I'd love to see it. I'd love to see all these predators.
5064000	5068000	I wouldn't love to see this action ever happen, but I understand it's out there.
5068000	5073000	You know what I mean? I'd like to see the predators caught and dealt with.
5073000	5079000	I would love to see the predators caught and dealt with. Could this technology capture on swatters?
5079000	5085000	I guess maybe not, maybe, but it's maybe something police can install or so. I don't know. They'd be nice, though, if they could do that, too.
5085000	5091000	Yeah. You know, just like even if people joke about it, they need to be flagged because it's not funny.
5091000	5098000	It's not funny at all. Do you think people are going to have a problem, though? I mean, it's more and more we start to get more and more aware of like all these devices that listen in on us, right?
5098000	5104000	Like there's all this talk. Privacy isn't a thing anymore. There's no privacy? No, there's really no privacy anymore.
5104000	5112000	Not if you don't want something of yours that has been in or on the Internet to be public.
5112000	5116000	You do not put it on the Internet at all. You write it down.
5116000	5125000	That's why I keep a journal, a physical written damn journal now so that I don't have to worry about my dirty laundry being aired.
5125000	5131000	You know, I don't put anything unless I break in your home and steal your journal. But she says that's at my house.
5131000	5139000	Fair enough. I keep the thing with me. So but at any rate and, you know, I'm just being teasing anyway.
5139000	5151000	That's fine. But but at any rate, you know, I think if this is a this is a suitable reaction to a problem that's happening.
5151000	5165000	It's it's it was predictable that something like this would happen. And so, again, I think that if you're that kind of filthy creature that wants to prey on children for whatever.
5165000	5175000	Pleasure you want to get from exploited children, then you best be considering, number one, your life choices.
5175000	5182000	Number two, getting psychological help. And number three, keeping that garbage off of the Internet.
5182000	5187000	You know, it's Dan and I were just talking about this the other day, too.
5187000	5190000	We're talking about the subway guy and how garbage he was.
5190000	5196000	And just talking about how these people and we're learning about them now because nothing is private on the Internet.
5196000	5204000	But when you go to play a game on Xbox Live, essentially you're saying you're going on the Internet and the things that you're saying, the things that you're doing, their public record.
5204000	5211000	Yeah. You're doing them on the Internet and you're doing them online by participating in this chat. You have consented to be scrutinized.
5211000	5217000	End of story. Yeah. And honestly, I want these predators to be they're out there.
5217000	5225000	We know they are. I want them caught and removed. I want these people who are out there harassing other people to be caught and removed.
5225000	5233000	I want them to see that their behavior is unacceptable. And yes, you will be held accountable for it. End of story.
5233000	5239000	So interesting that technology is taking us steps closer to that. So I'm glad for it.
5239000	5244000	I mean, nothing is private anymore. Just remember, everybody, nothing is private.
5244000	5252000	If you don't want some if you are going to put something out there that you feel might remotely be regrettable, don't fucking do it.
5252000	5257000	End of story. Better delete my Twitter account. All right.
5257000	5263000	Moving on. Loki, what do we have next? So more updates to Pokemon Go.
5263000	5268000	So Gen five, they're going to be having some more Pokemon added to the roster for Pokemon Go.
5268000	5274000	And what's going to be a little bit unique about this is that some of these you'll be able to get by evolving.
5274000	5281000	Well, your Pokemon will evolve when you do trades, because I think they're trying to really get people to use the trade function on there.
5281000	5296000	So right now they have certain Pokemon like Kadabra, Machoke, Graveler and Haunter that you need to.
5296000	5302000	They're going to have no candy evolutions. I guess that will be something that's going to be available now.
5302000	5305000	Along with that, they're going to be adding some more Pokemon.
5305000	5316000	So Bulldor, Girder, Garblast and Shelmet are going to be added as well to this trade evolution.
5316000	5322000	Then they're going to be adding some more Pokemon that are going to be for the fifth generation that you build a hatch from eggs.
5322000	5334000	So that includes Roggenrola, Tympole, Dwebler, Trubbish, Karablast, Joltik, Shelmet and then some additional ones.
5334000	5341000	And then they talk about some of the more region exclusive stuff as well.
5341000	5346000	So North America, South America and Africa are going to be getting Thoreau.
5346000	5348000	And those are going to be from 10 kilometer eggs.
5349000	5355000	I'm so bored of regional exclusives though. It sucks so much for people that aren't able to like just easily travel and all that.
5355000	5360000	You know, it's just, I don't know. I wish there was, I mean, I guess alternative ways come out eventually.
5360000	5366000	Some of these regions don't make any sense either. So like, okay, so like I said, North America, South America and Africa.
5366000	5377000	Okay, those are continents. Then we have Southern United States, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and South America get Maractus.
5378000	5383000	I mean, that's kind of weird that there's that overlap there.
5383000	5387000	Europe, Asia and Australia are getting Sauk.
5387000	5392000	Egypt and Greece are getting Sigilyph.
5392000	5401000	Eastern Hemisphere red striped form Basculin and Western Hemisphere blue striped form Basculin.
5401000	5404000	Hmm. That's hard to keep track of.
5404000	5411000	Yeah, you're going to need one of those guides that shows you all the different regionals and what's in, what's in each region and all that.
5411000	5414000	I'll catch what I catch and I'll be happy with that. That's fine.
5414000	5421000	That's right. That's right. Let's see. I'm actually kind of looking through my own collection because I find that these new ones they released, they're out there, but they're all kind of harder to find.
5421000	5429000	I have three Roggenrolas. So I guess that's the easiest one. I play a lot with my Bluetooth too. So I don't always see what I'm catching.
5429000	5436000	I know I raided this timber. I saw that timber and I raided that. I have a Venipede and a Basculin.
5436000	5437000	I have a few Venipedes.
5437000	5443000	Yeah. So, so you're getting, you're seeing those Venipedes. Yeah. But I don't, I mean, that's all of the like new stuff I've caught. So I need to
5443000	5445000	I also got a shiny Seviper.
5445000	5447000	I need to hatch more stuff. So.
5449000	5455000	All right. All right. So there's what's going on in Pokemon Go. Let's talk about what's going on in mainline Pokemon Go.
5455000	5458000	Or excuse me, mainline Pokemon Go. Mainline Pokemon.
5458000	5461000	All the Pokemanses. Pokemon Go play it on the Switch.
5461000	5467000	Yeah. Pokemon Go and play it on the Switch because there was a big Pokemon Direct that happened this week.
5467000	5472000	And they did, they did a little bit of like, yes, home still coming. And you know, little bits of that.
5472000	5479000	They also talked about a Pokemon mystery dungeon game that had a demo that came out. I did play that a little bit actually.
5479000	5480000	That was cute.
5480000	5482000	Is that a new game or is it just a remake?
5482000	5488000	It's a remaster or redo or whatever of like, I think it was on Game Boy Advance because it was around the time of gen.
5488000	5492000	I think the first three gens are in it. So it's.
5492000	5496000	They had a few mystery dungeons that were on DS as well.
5496000	5501000	They did. They did. I think that represent later generations. But what I played was cute. So, yeah.
5501000	5506000	And then they announced some this and this is a surprise. Nobody was expecting this.
5506000	5514000	But Pokemon Sword and Shield will be getting expansions that will be adding 200 more Pokemon to the games.
5514000	5518000	And these are Pokemon from the past. So these are Pokemon.
5518000	5520000	I kind of figured that they would be doing this.
5520000	5524000	And some folks kind of thought, oh, that's what they're doing for DLC.
5524000	5532000	And, you know, some folks are accusing Pokemon Company and Nintendo of being, you know, greedy by doing it this way and, you know, so forth.
5533000	5542000	I kind of prefer it to what's been historically there, because if you think about it and they they said in very plain terms, this is taking the place of a third game.
5542000	5546000	So there's not going to be a Pokemon gun or a Pokemon armor.
5546000	5553000	Instead, there's going to be the Isle of Armor, but then DLC with one of the Pokemon getting a gun.
5553000	5557000	And that's yeah, I was gonna say that's too bad because there is a Pokemon with a gun now.
5557000	5561000	And that is we're referring to a new GMax form for Inteleon.
5561000	5565000	So, yeah, but but anyway, I'm sure you guys have seen all the memes at this point.
5565000	5584000	They're doing the DLC. But but my point with this is, is that, you know, if you really sit down and think about it, you know, and what blows me away how people are still complaining about this is that this is what folks were saying they wanted was like, oh, well, just do a Pokemon gun that has all of the old Pokemon in it.
5584000	5587000	Well, guess what? You would be paying $60 for that.
5587000	5590000	And usually when they do something like that, they cut Pokemon.
5590000	5596000	It's not all just all new. It's not a best of the first. It doesn't eliminate the first two games.
5596000	5600000	It has some from column A, some from column B and not everything.
5600000	5608000	This way, you're not having to buy a whole new game and play what is essentially the same plot over again, right?
5608000	5614000	Because Pokemon yellow was just fucking Pokemon red. But with Pikachu following you, that's all it was.
5614000	5620000	It wasn't that different. Like maybe minor differences. You want to get a piggy with me, but otherwise not that different.
5620000	5628000	But this method, it's going to be cheaper overall. Yes, $30 is expensive for DLC, but that's $30 for both parts.
5628000	5633000	So a new if they had done a Pokemon gun or whatever, it would've been a $60 game.
5633000	5635000	So this is actually going to be cheaper than that.
5635000	5637000	You have to buy it twice if you have two different games.
5637000	5641000	You do have to buy it twice if you have two different games. Oh, I don't know about that.
5641000	5649000	Pokemon experts, do I have to buy it twice if I own both sword and shield? The answer is you might. For that.
5649000	5655000	That's lame. But see, just fucking trade for the missing ones.
5655000	5662000	I understand Pokemon completionists are going to need to buy it twice for that, but they also chose to be Pokemon completionists.
5663000	5667000	I know Shane does. Shane does not give a fuck about this whole, or like, like in a good way.
5667000	5672000	He's like, I'm all about this DLC. This is the way to do it. I'm pumped and all that.
5672000	5676000	He will, he will not give a fuck about paying twice if he has to. I know that already.
5676000	5689000	So, um, uh, yeah, I, I don't think people that already invested in buying the same game twice are going to worry about buying the same DLC twice because you already bought the same game twice.
5689000	5694000	I guess. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, let me see. I'm actually trying to look at chat here. Okay.
5694000	5699000	Uh, Shane says, um, yes, you have to buy a shield one and a sword one.
5699000	5706000	Um, Shane is also saying, how is it greedy when you don't need to buy the expansion to trade or transfer in the returning Pokemon?
5706000	5716000	People just want to complain. Sometimes I feel like, um, and act def follows that up with people are still so goddamn salty about national decks, but I just rather not pay attention to the haters anymore.
5716000	5724000	And you're right. It's not that some, somebody chose to just gloss over that part of the direct where they explicitly showed.
5724000	5729000	If you don't want to buy the DLC, you can still trade for the Pokemon that are in the DLC.
5729000	5737000	They're not going to show up in your old game in the wild area or anything like that. I don't want they might, I don't know, maybe one or two, but that's not in the plan, but you could trade for him.
5737000	5744000	So if you really want a fucking Bulbasaur or whatever, I don't, and I don't know if Bulbasaur is in the expansion. I'm just assuming trade for it.
5744000	5754000	Just like, and that's that my friends is how it used to be done anyway, because then people are salty about, oh, I got to trade or know these people do that stuff.
5754000	5759000	What the fuck do you think it was on the Game Boy Advance with that fucking cable?
5762000	5770000	Because the people complaining about it aren't old and salty like me. They don't remember those days. That's how you used to have to do it.
5772000	5775000	So there is seriously no satisfying some people.
5775000	5782000	It wasn't this trading over the internet bullshit. It was, you had to be in the same room and tethered to each other.
5782000	5789000	Yeah. Anyway, uh, Shane also points out in our chat, uh, Bulbasaur is the expansion in one way or another since as a GMax form now.
5789000	5795000	Oh, I didn't even, I actually didn't watch the direct. I just read all the new, cause you know, once you, once you kind of read everything, you're like, all right.
5795000	5798000	And I've kind of seen it, but I guess I should go back and watch it at some point.
5798000	5803000	So, uh, SGO and Hunter Matt in chat says, uh, folks who are losing their minds over this need to go outside.
5803000	5812000	Um, Akdeft in chat says, I only have shield, so it's only once. And yeah, I only have shield too. I only plan to buy it once.
5812000	5825000	If there's something I really need, I know I have a Pokemon affectionate auto number one fan for a friend where if I'm like, will you please get me an egg for such and such Pokemon?
5825000	5829000	He'll get me an egg for such and such Pokemon. It's not that hard. You know what I mean?
5829000	5841000	So, you know, just, and you know what, even if you're sitting there going, I don't have any friends, um, go to VOG network and talk to people because I'm sure there are tons of you raise your hand in chat.
5841000	5849000	If you're willing to make eggs for people that really, really want to Pokemon, but can't afford the DLC, I'll fucking do it. Like I will.
5849000	5852000	So I'm sure there are plenty of people that are willing to help get you.
5852000	5855000	I realize y'all are going to be my egg donors. Okay.
5855000	5864000	That's, that's how the world works in 2020. I, that is fine. I will be your egg donor. So I will be a surrogate for those eggs on my Pokemans.
5864000	5872000	Um, Shane also points out in gen five, if you wanted pre gen five Pokemon, you needed a second DS. So yeah, this doesn't seem bad at all.
5872000	5879000	And Shane is saying, I'll always help in Pokemon. Uh, and active says Galarian slowpoke is the best. I got the shiny the same day.
5879000	5891000	Oh yeah, that was the thing they did too. So even, uh, just load up your sword and shield game and you go to the train station in the first town whose name is escaping me right now.
5891000	5900000	But the very first town you're in, there's a train station and you will see one of the new characters and the character you see depends on, so I have shield.
5900000	5909000	So I got the psychic lady with the Pokeballs spinning around her head. So, um, and, uh, there was a Galarian slowpoke there that I had to catch.
5909000	5917000	So it was that muppet looking Galarian meowth. It's cute. That's just, they like to do the different stuff. It looks like a freaking muppet.
5917000	5932000	He looks like animal and Dr. Teeth. Oh, wet mud wrestling. Oh, Shane and chat says that Avery is actually a guy, Rob. Well, it's, you know what? It's 2020 and gender is just a suggestion. So who cares? So that's that.
5932000	5948000	All right. Anyhow. Uh, so yeah, uh, the aisle armor is in June, 2020 crown tundra is in fall 2020. And, uh, yeah, your starter will be able to gigantamax, which will be fun, uh, and all that good stuff.
5948000	5954000	So you can pre-order both now if you want. Um, I don't like to give my money away until it's ready.
5954000	5959000	Who pre-orders DLC? Especially if it's digital. I mean, come on.
5959000	5973000	Why? So Shane, when did you pre-order yours already? That I, I'm going to tell you why I probably wouldn't do it today, but I'll do it the week before because then I get that game if you pre-order.
5973000	5985000	So that's what you get close. You get close in game. If you pre-order, I'm glad that. Hey, some of us are fashionistas. Okay. All right. So we like to be pretty.
5985000	5998000	All right. Anyhow. Um, there you go. I'm excited. I think this is the way to do it. I'm happy. I'm happy. It's this and not sword to shield to or gun or armor like this is great.
5998000	6008000	I think I just didn't expect this from Pokemon. So now that it's here, I'm like, cool. And they're addressing and they're addressing the Nash decks thing as a part of it.
6008000	6022000	Like I kind of didn't even think they really, I mean, we all kind of knew they'd do something, but I mean, especially when they found the files for, um, one of those, remember we had that story on an older episode that the files were in the game for one of the older ones.
6022000	6037000	They had like, so I would bet that's a DLC Pokemon. So there's something going on there. But anyway, all right, let's move on. Uh, dark Sakura, a completely different story, but, um, here, here we go again with things we're going to change in 2020. Right?
6037000	6057000	Well, and you know how I feel about labor and unionizing, I'm a big, uh, big fan of, uh, unions. And of course we've had it recently in the news where, you know, by recently, I mean, in the last few months where a Kickstarter got in trouble for firing members who wanted to unionize.
6057000	6075000	Google was in trouble for firing members that were trying to unionize and using their work intranet to share labor laws with other people, which is by the way, if they're right to do so, um, the, the employee's right to share that information because it really should be posted in public areas.
6075000	6099000	But now, um, there is a, uh, a group, uh, the CWA, um, and that's working with Game Workers Unite, which is a grassroots organization, um, to work on unionizing the, um, the tech world and video game development world, um, into a big labor union.
6099000	6114000	Um, right now the project is called the campaign to organize digital employees or code for short, how freaking clever, um, to see about getting that union going on to protect, uh, people who work in, um, those fields.
6114000	6126000	For example, um, uh, there was another, uh, a, uh, the Pittsburgh Association of Tech Professionals unionized Google, Google Subtractors, um, successfully.
6126000	6141000	Um, you know, there is, uh, even talk at the 2019 Video Game Developers Conference about the industry's practice of making employees work over 100 hours in a week to finish a game without extra pay.
6141000	6148000	Basically, we've talked about the crunch time thing before and how this abuses their employee, employees and puts out a substandard product.
6148000	6169000	So, really, you know, with the, the walkouts at Google, the walkout at Riot Games, um, the claims of sexual harassment and just in general, uh, uh, what's the word I'm thinking, of discrimination at some, some video game companies, I think it's high time we had unions to protect the, the workers.
6169000	6180000	You know, and I'm going to tell people this, for anyone who's anti-union, you know what you have to thank a union for? How about your 40 hour work week? How about such concepts as overtime? How about eliminating child labor?
6180000	6191000	Uh, you want examples of what happens when, uh, workers are not protected by a union. Look at the, uh, Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, uh, fire in, uh, the early, early 19th century.
6191000	6208000	Uh, sorry, early, uh, uh, 20th century, 1900s. Look at, um, I mean, just, uh, construction standards. All of these come because of unions. OSHA we have to protect you at work because of fucking unions.
6208000	6219000	So don't talk to me about being anti-union when you take everything that a union has given you for fucking granted. It's time that the tech field had the same thing.
6219000	6230000	Yeah, I'm, uh, I, I think it's one of those things where a lot of us have sort of seen this shoes been ready to drop for some time. It's just a matter of kind of like when, so I'm very curious to see how this proceeds.
6230000	6246000	What else I'm also kind of curious to hear about is the impact of AB5 in the game industry because we haven't heard a lot about that, but we do have some very big game makers here in California, which if you guys aren't aware, AB5 was the law here in California that talked about what is and what isn't an employee.
6246000	6259000	And the targets of the law really felt like it was supposed to be Uber and Lyft basically is that, you know, if you, if you work so many, you know, it's contracts or whatever that basically this, this company should be treating you like an employee and you should have those types of employee benefits.
6259000	6267000	I personally, I think the law, the, the law is good intention and I get what they're trying to do. I think there's some huge flaws.
6267000	6280000	I have some artists friends that are really struggling with this and some journalists friends that are now getting turned away for work because the company realized it's not a national lots, California.
6280000	6288000	So they just want to go hire people in Nevada and Arizona and all this stuff. So I think the law needs a lot of work still, but it is law.
6288000	6302000	And so I'm curious to see how it impacts kind of the gaming industry and some of those more established things. So, but going back into that though is that I think that if we do have the genes enabled here in state.
6302000	6320000	Then that also does give it gives a lot more power to be able to bargain with government agencies to have laws revised to have that the backing of the union behind those legislative actions to protect the workers who are affected negatively by these laws.
6320000	6329000	So, I mean, and if you want to look at another recent example I mean SAG-AFTA when they had or after when they had their big thing for voice actors.
6329000	6342000	You know, I think in the long run that unionizing will work out for the best will help with those laws in the books that may be abused right now like this new one.
6342000	6358000	And also just, you know, let companies know that you can't keep taking your employees for granted, you cannot take advantage of them anymore. We are people, we have lives we need to have those lives protected, including our rights to work in a safe environment.
6358000	6367000	So we'll be very curious to see what develops of this I have a feeling it's gonna be one of those 2020 stories we're going to look back on in December and see how far did this really come along throughout the year.
6367000	6380000	So, in the meantime, we're going to move on to one comment by she hooked in please go ahead, 99% of companies are now not employee friendly we're becoming a slave labor country over the next 20 years.
6380000	6396000	And I mean, but that's also going back into again where we're seeing certain government people really putting the money on the capitalist front instead of on the workers, so hopefully that will change.
6396000	6408000	We'll see. All right, moving on to our next story Loki, so there was something that kind of caught the eyes of a lot of people covering CS and that was alien whereas concept UFO.
6408000	6418000	It is a portable PC gaming system that has detachable controllers, where have I heard that before. Sounds kind of like the Nintendo Switch and that's kind of what it is.
6418000	6424000	It's basically like a PC version of the Nintendo Switch it's got a 10 inch screen.
6424000	6439000	So it's a little bit bigger than the switches six in 6.2 inch screen, and the joy six on the side or the this basically the controllers can actually detach from the system as well.
6439000	6448000	It has a little kickstand in the back, and then you can kind of combine them together, much like you can with the joy cons, and their little attachment as well.
6448000	6460000	Right now it is just the concept so no word on what hardware is driving your what costs or when it's going to be out or anything like that, but it is neat to see like some sort of portable gaming type of thing.
6460000	6470000	I'd be down for this. At one point I was trying to build something like this so why not, you know, of course it's Alienware so it's probably gonna be $1,000 so.
6470000	6487000	How fast would Nintendo try to shut this down though. I don't think they can it's not necessarily exactly it's not, it's not like the switch in the sense that you can use each individual controller as its own controller because it's not symmetrical in that way.
6487000	6496000	It would just, they would come off and basically allow you to almost like plug this into your TV or something like that to play on your TV.
6496000	6505000	I don't think that they can really sue them or anything for saying that they stole the idea but yeah it's definitely heavily inspired by it.
6505000	6510000	You know kind of like the PlayStation Move and the Kinect and the Switch motion controls.
6510000	6521000	I think we all have also known it's really just a matter of time before you know this the Switch idea gets borrowed by other people so I think in some ways this news isn't that surprising.
6521000	6526000	It'll just be you know is it gonna look like a cheap knockoff like the the V?
6526000	6544000	No it doesn't it doesn't look like a cheap knockoff of the V they were showing some games running on it it was running pretty smooth so I don't know if it's necessarily something that's gonna take off but I mean we'll have to see what it ends up looking like if it ever actually comes out.
6544000	6553000	Yeah for sure. All right well moving on I'm gonna make this real quick because one of the other things that we saw at this Consumer Electronics Show this week was the new PlayStation 5 logo.
6553000	6557000	That is not even something that needed like an announcement at all it's just stupid.
6557000	6568000	It was the one piece of video game news that came out well here's the thing it and maybe this is the internet making a bigger deal out of it than it really is because Sony just kind of like talked about you know their their path trajectory and where PlayStation has been.
6568000	6574000	They did not divulge anything about the new console that's going to come later. They just showed the new logo.
6574000	6583000	Now you might think this is a missed opportunity for me to show the logo here on Twitch but don't forget we're recording the audio for a podcast as well so you'll have to come with me to imagination land.
6583000	6589000	OK. So here we go. Ready. Ready everybody. I want you to imagine the PlayStation 4 logo.
6589000	6604000	OK. So now you see in the cloud you see a PlayStation 4 logo. OK. Now I want you to take that 4. OK. And I want you to make it a 5. Oh my God. There it is. PlayStation 5 logo. That is as logo for the PlayStation 5.
6604000	6616000	Honestly enough though I think that it's smart for them to not change it because it still fits their branding. I mean because really they've kept that particular branding since the PS2.
6617000	6631000	And all I get it like you know some you know and I'm sure dark soccer you could nerd about this because I know you're into typography and all this other stuff too is that you could nerd out about like how a font is representative to a brand and things like this and you do see it in other places.
6631000	6642000	So as much as we might be giving this announcement a little bit of shit. It is kind of one of those things where it's like look it ain't broke. Don't fix it. This is PlayStation brand. This is what it looks like. Why would they change it now.
6642000	6671000	Exactly. But I'm bummed. That's it. They've essentially had the same damn thing since PlayStation 2. Really. The only thing with is it instead of they've done this thing that a lot of companies have done where they've really tried to simplify things because you know for PS2 for example it was that sort of gradiated blue purple color because you know the the PS2 also had that strip around it that had the same color and they've done white on black which it's just.
6672000	6684000	Very simple. It's simplified the branding as much as they can while still keeping that font that it's been known for. I'll be honest I still prefer the branding from the first PlayStation.
6684000	6698000	I liked the text. It was very clean. I wish that they had stuck with that for a while and sort of got it because honestly the current PlayStation font went spelled out and said just P.S. It's kind of hard to read you know because it's more uniform in size.
6698000	6712000	The thing is is that people recognize words by their shape which is why people have trouble reading things if they're all in caps. Just showing that out there. I think though that at least for sake of consistency it's a smart move.
6712000	6721000	They're like yeah we're still here. We don't need to do anything fancy. We don't need to change it up every time because our product is fucking solid.
6721000	6734000	I'm going to put you on the spot a little bit so I apologize in advance because you may not have an easy answer to this question. But what would be for comparison sake what do you think would be another brand that's really defined by its font.
6734000	6736000	Google.
6737000	6750000	Back in the day. Remember people had a big shit over them moving from a serif font to a sans serif. Another one was another one that changed their font.
6750000	6761000	Gap did it for a little bit and then people were like super nuts about it and switch back to to Gap. In the 80s Apple's use of Adobe Garamond Pro in their ads.
6761000	6772000	I remember that Gap controversy. Yeah. OK. Now the chat is chiming in. You ready. I think this is a great answer from SJ 100 Matt Disney Disney. Oh absolutely. That's a great answer.
6772000	6787000	Bobby with a tongue in cheek answer that's actually kind of legit vogue. Oh yeah. I mean we use I don't think it's easy. We use you can say it right. We use your style. Yeah you use your style as the font and that is the font that you see over in the sidebar and the low bar.
6787000	6799000	And it's the same font that's in the logo. It's on our business card. Yeah it's everywhere. I I the only I custom did the O as you know the power symbol but even that was the G.
6799000	6815000	But even that was built off of your style. Yeah. But I mean but going back into you know old era versus new you can look at an Apple ad from the 80s and just even without the picture there.
6815000	6831000	You can look at the font on it and know that it's an 80s Apple ad because everything was set in Adobe Garamond Pro. You can look at New York Times their their headline logo not their headline but their logo is never changed.
6831000	6844000	You can just all they do is the N.Y.T. and you can look at those letters and know that they go to New York Times. In fact Times New Roman that font came because of the New York Times.
6844000	6857000	You know you can look at. Gosh what else I'm thinking of that's had a consistent font. There's all those companies that use Helvetica but that's not really the same thing you just know.
6857000	6865000	Oh they're using fucking Helvetica. A couple of their answers here and then we'll probably move on for time. Did your mess says Microsoft which they changed theirs though didn't they.
6865000	6875000	Well actually the Xbox Series X Xbox one and Xbox 360 all use the same font. I remember what the original Xbox didn't. So they've kind of kept a consistent look since then.
6875000	6883000	Apple switched the SF font but it really has just been a variation of the last two iterations of fonts that were being used.
6883000	6897000	And now though you can or even this you can look at like I'd say from the OS 10.9 earlier and how they all had that same font you could look at that and say oh that's that's from a Mac screen.
6897000	6908000	You know and lastly she hope says Mercedes Mercedes is defined by their font. Very good one. Yeah absolutely. Great answers all around from chat and our soccer thing.
6908000	6917000	Yes. And pie culture's saying time and she thought this would be a quick topic didn't you. Well we ended up turning it into font nerd. So you know what worked.
6917000	6932000	But I think that's something that people don't really think about with games or with anything is branding. Sure. You know think about something when you see a logo in the future. Ask yourself why is that sticking out in my head.
6932000	6942000	Why is it something that I'm always going to remember. And if you want to look up one of my personal heroes look at the logos that Saul Bass has designed for the record.
6942000	6951000	He also directed the shower scene in Psycho. Just saying he was big friends with Hitchcock. He did a lot of the movie titles for Hitchcock movies.
6951000	6963000	But just look at his logo designs. He did Continental. He did Girl Scouts. He did Delta. I think airlines for a little while he did the United Way.
6963000	6972000	Look at his designs and look at the font choices with those and tell me why they have lasting memory. You know what else always looks fucking consistent with branding and font and everything.
6972000	6984000	A Star Wars movie. Oh hell yeah. It's always that same font in the scroll in the beginning. It's always the credits cinema. The credits always look the same is branding too. Yeah. Like did you like you saw Mandalorian right. No I didn't.
6984000	6995000	Well the transitions. They use the wipes I bet right. He's a lot of the wipes. He's a lot of the same transitions they do in the movies. All right. Anyway we got to move on. We get to a whole other three hour podcast about brand nerds.
6995000	7010000	I'm sure that podcast actually exists. It's got to somewhere I'm sure. All right. Anyway let's move on. So in the sidebar it says classic game of the week with a question mark because every week Dark Soccer likes to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks hey you guys should be enjoying this game this week.
7010000	7023000	I hope you approve of my pick last week by the way on if you saw what I picked Crystal Castles. Oh yeah. Yeah that's good. That's good. But we did do a game last week but you know it's a new year new twist and we've been promising this twist for some time.
7023000	7041000	So Dark Soccer what is the 2020 twist. First off on this segment once a month we are doing a pinball game every month and it has to be that 90s era of pinball pre pinball 2000 but post when they started using the digital displays.
7041000	7049000	Well that's a restriction you're putting on yourself. I think the rest of us are just all pinball pinball. OK. Well I'm thinking about doing other more classic.
7050000	7062000	You know this also means I can't do my beloved Black Knight 2000 for example. So but also still holding it to the same rules. I can do like my 2000 but you are going to still be holding it to the same rules of 10 years old at least.
7062000	7073000	Yeah. So we're we're basically I can just tell you this right now. Everything's going to be from the 90s. All right. Fair enough. All right. So tonight's is the first of twelve. So January's pick for the classic pinball table of the month.
7073000	7082000	Duh. World Cup soccer pinball. I knew it was going to be this. So. So and I tried to get something that would show the gameplay but the music on here is my favorite music in the damn game.
7082000	7093000	Would you hear for like all of a hot minute. It comes in just that it has like a weird drum loop in the game. Then your music comes in right after it. So yeah. But yeah I like the music. It's like right when the ball has been activated.
7093000	7103000	Yeah. And it only plays at this one point in the game. Right when it transitions to gameplay you start to hear it.
7103000	7117000	I just think it's cool. Yeah. And by the way this is not footage from Dark Soccer's house. This is a YouTuber I forgot to credit my bad because I don't own sort of Fury and fuck if I did I would be in.
7117000	7137000	But you see what's next to it is a regular Black Knight. Yeah. So that's cool. Anyway. Anyway. So and I will go into some video game stuff on this too. So basically World Cup soccer. It came out in 1994 February 1984 and my personal love of this game is that we had one at the arcade that I worked at.
7137000	7152000	And I played the fuck out of this game. It is to this day my favorite pinball table. It was designed by John Papa Duke and Larry Demar Papa Duke in and of himself.
7152000	7166000	He's also responsible for theater of magic. So another big one. You've definitely seen Papa Duke stuff. It does have some special toys as were a little bit marked for that era of pinball.
7166000	7174000	It has a spinning soccer ball that when you've lit up all these items which makes the goal light up makes the goalie move the ball will start spinning.
7174000	7183000	True story. Dan had my ball spinning backwards when we first got the table so you can imagine how freaking hard it was because you can bounce off the ball to knock it into the goal.
7184000	7199000	But but that's the big thing is that it has a you know the soccer or football theme to it. There were eight thousand seven hundred forty three units confirmed produced.
7199000	7211000	It has two flippers three pop bumpers two ramps roll under spinner kickback Magnus save located on the play field above the left flipper that is activated by an extra button on the left side the cabinet.
7211000	7226000	There is a magna lock located on the middle left play field that holds the balls from multi multi ball play a goalie target move side to side at the top left play field and a maximum of three by in balls per player under the operator option.
7226000	7237000	The the art was done by Kevin O'Connor. So you know it's just really one of the one of the great ones on there.
7237000	7250000	This particular one people kind of overlook it a little bit just because oh soccer theme whatever but they don't realize that the game has actually had some pretty significant design to it.
7250000	7257000	Even my husband funny enough he was like I didn't you know really appreciate this one until you know you were all hyper about getting one.
7257000	7270000	And then when we got one he's like oh yeah I really like it. So you can of course if you go to the Internet pinball database you can get the rule sets for this table if you want to know the ins and outs of it.
7270000	7292000	I would say for anyone who wants to go play pinball and get good at playing pinball even if you're just going to your arcade to play it go to the Internet pinball database and look up the rules and see you know what tricks you can do how to get like your your jackpots how to get your different modes lined up in the game.
7292000	7308000	So going with this one is that for I have a hole in my socks that makes me sad. Anyway I just noticed my favorite socks too. But anyway for the pinball arcade it was available as DLC and it was removed on June 30th 2018.
7308000	7319000	And it was published as world champion soccer because Farsight Studios were unable to secure the World Cup soccer license from FIFA.
7319000	7328000	And it had like all kinds of different things to it. But they also changed like the back glass and everything but it was roughly the same table.
7329000	7346000	So some trivia about this one is that for the it looks like for the bonus round. I don't know if this is just for the digital versions or the arcade because I haven't really looked.
7346000	7360000	Is it riding for Mortal Kombat as a cameo in the bonus round. And then the flyer for the machine shows an American football field as in you know like American football instead of a soccer field in the background.
7360000	7371000	But the stadium shown is Soldier Field in Chicago that had many of the 1994 World Cup matches there including the opening match for 1994 World Cup.
7371000	7385000	So that is your game. It is World Cup soccer and I will also for the sake of chat provide a link from pinside dot com which is another great resource for pinball information.
7385000	7394000	It's just really you know don't you know don't poopoo on it because it's soccer. It really is a solid game.
7394000	7402000	Again Papa Duke other things that he designed like I said theater magic is is really the big one.
7402000	7409000	I'm trying to get it to load the list of it's got to make so much sense because theater magic also has another one of those like gigantic things in the middle of the table.
7409000	7413000	So I guess a lot of people have that but theater magic is fucking amazing.
7413000	7423000	I love magic. Well you know I have that too. Yeah. But yeah Papa Duke did a circus Voltaire.
7423000	7429000	He did Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest.
7429000	7432000	Star Wars Episode One.
7432000	7441000	Tornado Tales of the Arabian Nights. OK. So funny thing about this one at Moby Dick in San Francisco in the Castro.
7441000	7451000	They have World Cup soccer theater magic and Tales of the Arabian Nights all next to each other in the back three of the greatest tables.
7451000	7459000	And they're all John Papa. I don't know if they still do. They do. Oh do they. Wow. Yeah. One of my buddies who works at Cliffs.
7459000	7466000	The fabric side of Cliffs was actually the one who told me that they were still there.
7466000	7474000	But yeah. If you're in San Francisco go to Castro. If you want to try these three amazing Papa Duke tables all three of them are at Moby Dick.
7474000	7481000	All right. And then you get your drink. All right. There it is your classic pinball table of the month World Cup soccer.
7481000	7487000	Ninety four. All right. Very cool. Y'all just can't come to my house. The first you bring me measure me chocolate.
7487000	7493000	I'm sure Rob the first to that should be a contest in the future when a trip to our soccer house.
7493000	7502000	OK. I can sleep on my air mattress on the floor kind of like the old like win a trip to Nickelodeon Studios and tour the studios and get slimed on the city.
7502000	7508000	You get that on television. Things like that. Like they should we should do a win a trip to Dark Soccer's house.
7508000	7512000	Yeah. Anyway. All right. Let's move on. We got more topics to get into here.
7512000	7519000	Plenty of show left and about a 20. So really sad about my song now because I can't replace these.
7519000	7526000	They don't sell them anymore. I'm sorry. Look at my socks everybody. They have cats. All right.
7526000	7534000	Let's talk to Loki and get some rapid fire news. So you know who says old games can't be updated to offer new things.
7534000	7543000	So apparently some of the console ports of Doom and Doom 2 have received some new updates to add a lot of new support.
7543000	7554000	So, for example, 60 FPS support. So now Doom runs actually at 60 FPS instead of 35 FPS add on support.
7554000	7568000	So add ons can be downloaded and played from the main menu so that they can do a mixture of Doom and Doom 2 add ons as well as community episodes and megawatts.
7568000	7575000	Added aspect ratio options to the original four three. Added quick save and quick load.
7575000	7587000	Level select, weapon carousel, quick weapon select, brightness and level brightness, random sound effects, pitch toggle, new.
7587000	7598000	They have a new HUD for the split screen. It's a minimal HUD to give you some more space to see in there and change the health graphics and change Wolfenstein secret level.
7599000	7608000	Did you know this is available on PC as well? Yeah. If you bought the game on the Bethesda store, if you bought it on steam, fuck you.
7608000	7615000	That's yeah. I was. What about, what about dog? Uh, Nope. But that's the store. That's it.
7615000	7625000	Cause it has to be this particular 2019 or 18 rerelease. So they do remember when the big meme going around, you have to have a Bethesda net account to continue.
7625000	7634000	Oh yeah. I remember that. Okay. That was from when they rereleased doom everywhere. So your version of doom has to be one of those that was part of that meme joke.
7634000	7641000	So if you don't have a version of doom that had that, then it doesn't qualify. Oh well. Yeah, I guess I miss out. Who cares?
7642000	7659000	Um, and then this is kind of cool, but, uh, apparently there's a brand new mod, uh, grand theft auto vice city remastered that they have basically dumped the map of grand theft auto vice city into grand theft auto five on PC.
7659000	7669000	So I guess you can go ahead and check it out now before it gets a cease and desist, but at least it's available right now in five mods.
7669000	7680000	Get it now before it's gone. All right. Um, moving on, uh, Nintendo apparently filed a new trademark for a Mario and Luigi game, but wait a minute.
7680000	7693000	Didn't they close the studio behind that? Well, something may be going on here. Uh, so Nintendo of America filed a new trademark in South America, uh, and, uh, says the trademark will be for computer game cartridges, game memory cards, and so on and so on.
7693000	7703000	This could just be them making sure their intellectual property doesn't go away or anything like that, but it should, you know, just caught people's eyes. Like why now? Why this? So put it in out there.
7703000	7711000	Uh, also from consumer electronics show the retron junior, uh, it plays game boy, game boy color and game boy advanced games all on your TV.
7711000	7717000	It's this teeny tiny little box, uh, that connects to the TV via an HDMI, and then it will output the games in seven 20 P.
7717000	7726000	Uh, it has a super Nintendo style scout controller, uh, that connects to the console. And so you can actually, uh, yeah, play all your portable games on your TV.
7726000	7736000	But that's, uh, for those of you that want to go back and play your old Pokemon games, there's how you can do it. Can I get a link cable to, uh, connected to another retron mini that I can then put transfer my Pokemon across?
7736000	7748000	There is a 3.5 millimeter headphone socket and link port, which allows two retron junior systems to be connected together for games, which support multiple players. Awesome. How about that? Hell yes. They thought of everything.
7748000	7752000	They thought of everything and the kitchen sink. All right. Dark Sakura.
7752000	7768000	Well, um, the, uh, game artist for the silent hill, uh, series, the early silent hill series, um, Ito Masahiro, um, has teased on Twitter that he is working on a title as a core member and they hope it won't be canceled.
7769000	7787000	He was one of the members of team silent. Um, and just his art was, was absolutely haunting. Um, one of really the things that made silent hill. Um, I, I have one of the lithographs thanks to Shane for silent hill too. It's one of my favorite things. I think he signed it too.
7787000	7802000	Um, but just one of my favorite artists and I'm super, super happy. And I hope it is something very silent hill-ish and that maybe he might, I'm, I've got this dream in my head that he's working on something with Kojima.
7802000	7816000	Anything's possible. In my head, in my heart. And then also AGDQ 2020, which I brought this up earlier. They broke 3 million. They were so close to pie million Rob.
7816000	7827000	They made it to 3.13 million for prevent cancer foundation. And it is the second GDQ that has raised more than $3 million in the marathon.
7827000	7845000	Um, it had 54,134 donors as of 11 AM Eastern time yesterday, I believe, no this morning, I think. Um, and it raised more than 700,000 above what AGDQ, uh, raised last year, which is a 30% increase.
7846000	7859000	Um, and it's absolutely amazing to, to see what happens when people put together for good, when they do so much fun. I watched the Animorphs run. It was fucking hilarious.
7859000	7866000	Um, just the guy they had doing Animorphs. And then he, he hung around, um, jawing with some other people. He's absolutely hilarious.
7866000	7877000	Um, I had a really good time watching this. I'm glad I got to contribute. And, um, the, uh, Summer Games Done Quick, which is our next one, is happening June 21st through 28th in Bloomington, Minnesota.
7877000	7896000	Um, uh, for this particular one though, there were 134 games that were run over the event, um, including the, um, uh, incentive and, uh, honk. Honk. That's it.
7896000	7904000	All right. Congrats to the folks at Awesome Games Done Quick for another very successful year. So breaking 3 million is no, I remember when breaking 2 million was the big deal.
7904000	7916000	So the first one was like a few hundred thousand. Yeah. So they've come a long, long way. And that's, I mean, that's, then it's great for great charity. So always love to report on the, the good news, uh, in the gaming world.
7916000	7924000	So let's travel around and check out some world release dates. I don't know if it's a busy week this week, but, uh, it should be starting to pick up again.
7924000	7939000	It's not busy, but it's, it's decent for, uh, January. I mean, so we've got a few things starting off with, uh, Outlier Dust Trilogy, the deluxe pack coming on PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4.
7939000	7951000	We have, uh, Puzzle and Dragon Gold on Nintendo Switch. Uh, we've got Dragon Ball Z, uh, Kakarot on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
7951000	7961000	Uh, Tokyo Mirage, uh, looks like, uh, Sessions Fe Encore. And that's coming out on Nintendo Switch.
7962000	7970000	And then finally, uh, we've got Yakuza Like a Dragon on PlayStation 4. That's it.
7970000	7978000	All right. Going to Japan. It's a little bit of a slower week in Japan as well. Um, on the Nintendo Switch, we have Mysetsu Pure Station comes out this week.
7978000	7984000	Uh, and then the big release is probably the Tokyo Mirage Sessions, uh, appears to be a world release, uh, this week.
7984000	7988000	So it's also coming out in Japan the exact same day. And that's, that's probably going to be a pretty big deal over there.
7988000	7992000	Um, but the PlayStation 4, not to be left out, uh, is getting some releases still.
7992000	8003000	Sangokushi 14 in a regular and treasure box. Uh, a game called the Kandakawa Jet Girls DX Jet Pack is in a regular and limited edition.
8003000	8011000	Uh, and then Yakuza Like a Dragon is also out there. And Dragon Ball Z Kakarot is out on PlayStation 4 as well.
8011000	8015000	So that's what you have to look forward to in Japan. How about the UK, Dark Sakura?
8015000	8024000	Some stuff. So we have, um, Neverwinter Nights Enhanced Edition Collector's Pack.
8024000	8032000	Um, that is on the 16th. We also have Planescape Torment Icewind Dale, same on the 16th, and Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition.
8032000	8042000	We also have Creed Rise to Glory on January 16th. For PlayStation, we have Beamdog Ultimate Collector's Pack, which is the first three games I mentioned.
8043000	8048000	Tokyo Mirage Sessions FE Encore, um, also on the 16th.
8048000	8053000	Just real quick, the chatters are saying that that hashtag is supposed to be the sharp sign in music, so it's Sharp FE.
8053000	8057000	Sharp? Yeah. Okay. You wouldn't know by looking.
8057000	8062000	Sessions. So, um, and also, uh, I was reading what was on the description.
8062000	8067000	I know. And Dragon Ball Z Kakarot also on the 16th.
8068000	8074000	Okay. There's your release dates. So let's go to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails.
8074000	8080000	Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com, and we read our favorite emails and our least favorite emails here on the program.
8080000	8082000	Do we have any emails tonight? We do. Okay.
8082000	8087000	So, of course, no one has guessed my, um, favorite brand of chocolate.
8087000	8093000	Well, then you can, you can bring the Philz coffee here. I will. Although they don't make it in K-Cups.
8094000	8099000	Philz is all pour over. Um, dear Tangerine Cafe Station.
8099000	8108000	What? I just want to chime in my thoughts regarding the discussion you had about the Nintendo Switch's lackluster interface.
8108000	8113000	There's something I loved about the 3DS, and that was the fact I could open it up to hear Amy Rose's theme,
8113000	8117000	My Sweet Passion, playing from the speakers with that bubbly pink background.
8117000	8121000	Themes. I was super bummed that these didn't get carried over to the Switch,
8121000	8125000	and it definitely lets us freshen up the menu to match our own unique tastes.
8125000	8130000	Just look at the PS4 and its wide selection available in the store. It's great.
8130000	8136000	Currently, I can power on my PS4 to the cool slow jam of Beneath the Mask from Persona 5,
8136000	8142000	while Makoto looks at me with a judging look like I'm about to be booted off Love Island.
8142000	8147000	I want this same experience on the Switch, and I hope dearest daddy Doug Bowser can make my dreams come true.
8147000	8150000	Thanks for reading, Garth Wolf.
8151000	8155000	Okay. Your dear daddy, huh?
8155000	8162000	Anyway, um, next email is taking a while to load. There we go.
8162000	8166000	Um, actually, yeah, this is, okay, it's the same thing that I was talking about.
8166000	8171000	We just got a release, um, about the Communication Workers of America.
8171000	8179000	So I thought this was, like, a legit email, but this is a marketing email outlining the story that I said earlier.
8179000	8183000	But there are some quotes on here that I would like to read.
8183000	8189000	Companies in the technology and game industries have gotten away with avoiding accountability for far too long.
8189000	8193000	That's according to President Chris Shilton of CWA.
8193000	8198000	Workers in these industries are exposing the reality behind the rhetoric.
8198000	8206000	This initiative will help tech and game companies reach the next level in their efforts to exercise their right to join together and demand change.
8206000	8208000	Um, so, yeah.
8208000	8212000	But, hey, we got on an official press release. That's pretty impressive.
8212000	8215000	I mean, yeah.
8215000	8223000	Now, if you want to hire me to be your speaker and do podcasts for you, I'll fucking do it.
8224000	8229000	I do like money, though. So, I mean, I won't do it for free. Just saying.
8229000	8233000	But, yeah, um, that seems to be it for the mailbag.
8233000	8241000	I am really irritated, chatters, that I haven't gotten any more email from you guys because today I was actually excited about reading email.
8241000	8244000	And, yeah.
8244000	8247000	So, where's the rest of my emails?
8247000	8253000	You haven't guessed? Okay. I need to give y'all another idea of what chocolate I like.
8253000	8257000	I also like your shirt that says that's too much bacon, so no one ever.
8257000	8258000	Loki.
8258000	8259000	Yes.
8259000	8261000	Okay.
8261000	8266000	So, my favorite brand of chocolate is an American company.
8266000	8268000	I believe they're American.
8269000	8277000	They are fair trade and do not engage in companies that use slavery for their chocolate sourcing.
8277000	8281000	And they are not giardelli.
8283000	8287000	And Rob is a quality human who brought me popcorn.
8287000	8291000	I know. She made me get in the kitchen and cook for her while she was doing the mailbags.
8291000	8292000	Right.
8292000	8293000	All right.
8293000	8296000	But it's for everybody popcorn.
8296000	8297000	All right.
8297000	8299000	This kettle corn, too, is delicious. Sorry, not sorry.
8299000	8302000	Let's move on, Loki. We got some more news still to get to, right?
8302000	8305000	So, yeah. This is kind of interesting.
8305000	8321000	So, basically, according to Xbox's Matt Booty, he confirmed that for the first party Xbox Series X games, they're not going to be exclusive for at least the first year or two.
8321000	8331000	So, apparently, they said, as our content comes out over the next year or two years, all of the games, sort of like PC, will play up and down the family of devices.
8331000	8338000	We want to make sure that someone invests in Xbox between now and the Series X that they feel that they've made a good investment.
8338000	8358000	Meaning that they're kind of treating this console like a cell phone or a tablet or something like that to where, yeah, it'll play on the Xbox One or Xbox One X, but the fidelity of the graphics and the features may not be as great as, say, the Series X.
8358000	8359000	Here's the thing.
8359000	8364000	I thought that was supposed to be. I thought we already knew that. I thought they had said that some time ago.
8364000	8366000	But it's, I think, more of a confirmation.
8366000	8373000	Yeah, it is a bit of a confirmation, but also, I thought this was going to be the case forever. I didn't think it was just going to be the case for the first year or two.
8373000	8377000	That's what's striking me odd about this news. I just not understand that correctly.
8377000	8386000	I don't know if it's forever because, like with modern devices now, they only support, you know, so far back.
8386000	8392000	Like, there's certain games that are going to get to a technical point where you can't do that on those systems.
8392000	8403000	Maybe necessarily natively, but maybe they'll say, yeah, you can't play this natively on the platform, but we have xCloud that you can stream it, you know, that way.
8403000	8405000	Yeah, I kind of thought that was going to be it.
8405000	8415000	So it's like, okay, yeah, you might not be able to purchase, say, you know, Halo Infinite 5 or whatever, you know, down the road, but you'll be able to stream it.
8415000	8419000	With xCloud or, you know, who knows, it may be part of Games Pass.
8419000	8423000	Swongtong in chat says, sheesh, with all these studios MS Bot and nothing.
8423000	8426000	I don't think that's quite what we mean when we say exclusives.
8426000	8430000	We're talking about things that will only play on Xbox Series X and not the prior Xbox console.
8430000	8433000	Right, so they'll be exclusive to Microsoft consoles, but they're...
8433000	8440000	But we already know about Hellblade 2. That is a game that will be exclusive to the Microsoft, you know, and that comes from a studio that Microsoft bought.
8440000	8444000	Right, so they'll have that, but you'll also be able to play it on Xbox One X.
8444000	8455000	So basically what they're telling you now is like, hey, if you're in the market to get an Xbox One and you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I don't want to buy an Xbox One and then have to turn around and buy an Xbox Series X.
8455000	8463000	You're like, well, you know what, don't worry about it because you'll be at least able to play these brand new games for the next few years.
8463000	8466000	You don't have to worry about being kind of shut out of those.
8466000	8472000	Yeah, I just sort of figured out the... or figured the cloud support would help that go on a much longer forever type of deal.
8472000	8488000	And it might, but like, you know, at some point though, much like the Xbox 360 and stuff, they have to kind of cut out those old systems because they want to do more advanced technical stuff with it and it's just not going to be possible on that kind of hardware.
8488000	8490000	It's going to be too old.
8490000	8495000	Shehulk10 says, will not run at max settings on old consoles, 4K HDR.
8495000	8500000	Yeah, but not everybody is necessarily going to have a 4K TV anyway. I still don't have a 4K TV.
8500000	8505000	So, because I bought a fucking TV right before 4K became really cheap.
8505000	8509000	And so I'm like, God damn it, I'm going to drive that one into the ground.
8509000	8517000	My wife and our father-in-law also just purchased a TV for her mom.
8517000	8521000	So like a 65 inch 4K TV is like 500 bucks.
8522000	8525000	They're like such... they've come down in price.
8525000	8530000	So that thing, they went from a 40 inch to a 65 inch. So it's just like, boom!
8530000	8533000	It's like, it's huge now.
8533000	8538000	Alright, so yeah, I gotta work on upgrading the TV at some point, we'll see.
8538000	8543000	Anyway, an interesting report has come out about streaming in the year 2019.
8543000	8548000	So, and I mean like video game streaming, meaning sites like the one you're on right now, Twitch, watching this show.
8548000	8553000	I guess not necessarily because you'd be on the podcast, but for those that are live on Sunday, you're on Twitch, of course.
8553000	8556000	Which is one of the larger players in the game.
8556000	8563000	Or it could be the rebroadcast, or not rebroadcast, but like, you know, they could be watching the wonderful archives that you...
8563000	8564000	Of course.
8564000	8565000	And if you subscribe.
8565000	8568000	Thank you for the cheap plug. Yes, please subscribe, then you can watch all the archives.
8568000	8570000	But that is also on Twitch.
8571000	8579000	But an interesting kind of study, talking about data from stream elements and a site called arsenal.gg.
8579000	8582000	Talking a little bit about some of the game streaming statistics.
8582000	8586000	Apparently Facebook gaming has been on the rise.
8586000	8591000	December 2019 brought in an 8.5% market share.
8591000	8599000	So that is, yeah, quite a jump in the market share there, compared with 3.1% from the year before.
8599000	8608000	So that's quite the increase, which I got to be honest, I've never watched a Facebook game thing ever.
8608000	8612000	But I've seen it in my feed because Facebook has tried to shove it down my throats.
8612000	8613000	Yes.
8613000	8615000	But do you know how I fixed that problem?
8615000	8619000	I uninstalled the Facebook app from my phone and that was my New Year's thing.
8619000	8623000	And I got to say, I'm only about 11 days in, but it feels fucking great.
8623000	8631000	I'm checking Instagram a lot more, which is funny because that's a Facebook company.
8631000	8633000	I darn well know that.
8633000	8640000	But as far as the Facebook updates and all that toxic shit that's out there on Facebook, I don't see it as much.
8640000	8647000	I mean, I say as much because I still check on the desktop on the weekends and sometimes at night and stuff.
8647000	8652000	But I'm not continuously hitting the fucking IV for more content.
8652000	8653000	Yeah.
8653000	8654000	And it's cool.
8654000	8656000	I fixed Twitter a little bit by blocking any.
8656000	8663000	And so because any of the advertisements that you see, there are sponsored tweets or whatever, it's always an account.
8663000	8665000	So I block every single one of those accounts I see.
8665000	8667000	And I hardly get advertisements.
8667000	8669000	You know, Fog has used that in the past, just so you know.
8669000	8672000	Well, no, but I understand that.
8672000	8675000	But I block all those.
8675000	8677000	So I hardly see advertisements anymore.
8677000	8679000	Well, we haven't done it since, for what it's worth.
8679000	8689000	But that's a personal choice just because also I'm not thrilled with where Facebook is going and how they're trying to get their hands in every pot.
8689000	8691000	And game live streaming is...
8691000	8695000	I got some email that was like, come stream on Facebook gaming.
8695000	8697000	And I was just like, I think the fuck not.
8697000	8699000	So that was that.
8699000	8702000	So cut back on Facebook, you guys.
8702000	8703000	You'll feel so much better.
8703000	8706000	I'm not saying you have to delete it or get rid of it, but just, you know.
8707000	8709000	I can't find anything of importance on there anyways.
8709000	8712000	It's usually just advertisements for stuff.
8712000	8717000	That's the thing about how they're supposed to track your activity so that they can advertise to you.
8717000	8719000	It's like you're just advertising for things I've already bought.
8719000	8726000	I don't need a computer desk because I already bought a computer desk for my son.
8726000	8727000	That's already done.
8727000	8732000	I don't need this stuff. Rollerblades.
8732000	8733000	Anyway, do you know what I did?
8733000	8738000	I put the icon in its place where Facebook used to be.
8738000	8741000	I put LiveJournal where Facebook used to be.
8741000	8742000	No, seriously.
8742000	8750000	The first two days, I couldn't tell you how many times just out of habit I tapped that icon and just brought up the LiveJournal login page.
8750000	8751000	And I was like, God damn it.
8751000	8753000	I played myself again.
8753000	8757000	But that's all part of taking the Band-Aid off.
8757000	8759000	I'm going back to Tumblr.
8759000	8761000	Tumblr? What's on Tumblr these days?
8762000	8764000	Fandom and bunnies and pure things.
8764000	8765000	I like bunnies.
8765000	8769000	Anyway, back to the story which talks about game streaming data.
8769000	8773000	Twitch still has the most hours.
8773000	8781000	They're up to 728 million hours, but their share dropped from 67.1% to 61%.
8781000	8791000	That's still over half, but probably because Twitch is starting to get challenged a little more from companies like Facebook and other companies like YouTube,
8791000	8798000	which YouTube Gaming, specifically YouTube Gaming, because I think if you were to weigh in all of YouTube, you'd have a lot more,
8798000	8803000	but they are at 27.9% of the share.
8803000	8807000	And then Mixer has 2.6% of the share.
8807000	8810000	That's up from 2% despite some of the big names.
8810000	8818000	Oh, I wholly intend to believe that Facebook will get overtaken by Mixer this year.
8818000	8819000	Easy.
8819000	8820000	Let's hope.
8820000	8824000	I would watch 50 Mixer streams before I ever watch a Facebook stream.
8824000	8826000	I can't imagine.
8826000	8829000	I just use the Facebook streaming for watching Drag Queen's paint.
8829000	8833000	That's different. That's not gaming streaming anyway.
8833000	8838000	Honestly, I'll watch Drag Queen's painting on YouTube. You can get a lot of that there.
8838000	8841000	I cannot believe I'm eating this whole bowl of popcorn. Thank you.
8841000	8842000	You're welcome.
8843000	8851000	All I ever get is Drag Queen videos in my recommends, because one time I watched a Jake Yonce video,
8851000	8855000	and now it's, who is going to be exposed tonight?
8855000	8858000	That is all that comes up on my YouTube recommends.
8858000	8860000	I'm about to delete that site too.
8860000	8866000	You don't have to delete it. You can just take those videos and then say, I don't like this, and then it will ask you.
8866000	8870000	But stop letting you do that on YouTube. You can't do that anymore.
8870000	8880000	No, I didn't. I did today, because I was, once again, I did research to try to find the perfect TV for my mother-in-law.
8880000	8886000	And we got to the store, and I was giving them my recommendations about the specs, because I did this the whole week and stressed myself out.
8886000	8888000	And all they did was like, I like that one!
8888000	8891000	It's like, fucking hell.
8891000	8894000	But that one, the picture is not as great as that one.
8894000	8897000	I like that one! That one's nice. The picture is nice.
8897000	8900000	The picture is nice. I'm like, fine! I don't care anymore.
8900000	8903000	It's like, okay, whatever.
8903000	8910000	So, I have a bunch of TV review things in my feed, so I clicked on those and I'm like, I don't want to watch this.
8910000	8915000	And then they're like, well, why? And I'm like, I don't want recommendations based on this one video that I watched.
8915000	8919000	And so, it will stop sending that stuff through.
8919000	8925000	And not necessarily get rid of everything, but at least cut down on if you're getting certain types of things.
8925000	8927000	Okay, well, it's good to know. I'll have to remember that for the future.
8927000	8929000	So, all right.
8929000	8936000	All right, let's move on and talk about, I guess, kind of one of those gaming does a good thing type of stories.
8936000	8940000	Which I think Jason hinted at in the beginning, actually.
8940000	8943000	Yes, and I was super proud to read this.
8943000	8947000	So, there was a gamer.
8947000	8949000	The gamer, that's all we talked about.
8949000	8954000	His name was Aidan Jackson, a 17-year-old gamer in the UK.
8954000	8958000	And he was talking with an American friend.
8958000	8965000	And apparently his friend heard him go silent on the line.
8965000	8971000	And the person's name was Dia, by the way.
8971000	8980000	She, I think it was a she, yeah, said that there wasn't any response on the line.
8980000	8983000	That it sounded really sudden and really terrible.
8983000	8994000	And so, she called emergency, well, she tried to get through to emergency services for his area in the UK.
8994000	8999000	And when she couldn't, she got to non-emergency services and said that she was talking to her friend online.
8999000	9004000	He was unresponsive, but she had the address and was able to direct them.
9004000	9008000	And his parents didn't even know.
9008000	9013000	And so, they didn't know anything about it until the emergency services arrived at the door.
9013000	9017000	And then they found him unresponsive on the floor, or barely responsive on the floor.
9017000	9019000	He had had a seizure.
9019000	9030000	So, because of an online gamer across the world, they were able to save him from a potentially life-threatening situation.
9030000	9032000	Yeah, thank you, Internet.
9032000	9035000	Certainly a frightening situation.
9035000	9040000	And so, her thing says, I'll just read you what she said.
9040000	9045000	I just put my headset back on and I heard what could only be described as a seizure.
9045000	9050000	So, obviously, I started to get worried and immediately started asking what was going on and if he was okay.
9050000	9054000	When he didn't respond, I instantly started to look up the emergency number in the EU.
9054000	9057000	When that didn't work, I had to hope non-emergency would work.
9057000	9059000	It had the option for talking to a real person.
9059000	9062000	And I can't tell you how quickly I clicked that button.
9062000	9065000	So, there you go.
9065000	9069000	I actually do keep a list of emergency services for my international friends.
9069000	9074000	Just because. Just because.
9074000	9076000	Since Pod Culture brought it up in chat, I will read it.
9076000	9079000	Pod Culture said, here's one thing Facebook was good for.
9079000	9083000	You calling the police for me a couple years ago, this story reminded me of that.
9083000	9084000	I did.
9084000	9089000	There was a status update that I found very concerning and that is the thing that happened.
9089000	9090000	So, you're right.
9090000	9093000	Sometimes internet friends can help each other out in those types of ways.
9093000	9097000	So, very important and good to know.
9097000	9098000	All right.
9098000	9099000	Let's move on.
9099000	9100000	Let's talk about.
9100000	9104000	I like this too as far as like classic gaming kind of goes.
9104000	9106000	Because this is a game inspired by classic game.
9106000	9107000	Exactly.
9107000	9110000	So, VVV.
9110000	9114000	They released the source code for the game.
9114000	9119000	So, apparently, I believe it was right after the run on AGDQ.
9120000	9123000	Basically saying, hey, guess what?
9123000	9124000	Surprise.
9124000	9126000	It's open source now.
9126000	9132000	So, now you can actually download the code for the game on GitHub and take a look at it.
9132000	9139000	And then there's even some other stuff you can look at in there.
9139000	9144000	Not necessarily something you want to use if you're trying to make your own custom levels.
9144000	9147000	They have the make and play version of the game, I guess, if you want to do that.
9147000	9149000	That might be a little bit easier.
9149000	9152000	But at least you can kind of tinker around and see how the game was made.
9152000	9154000	So, pretty cool.
9154000	9158000	And if you never played VVVV, it's great.
9158000	9159000	Yeah, you should really do it.
9159000	9160000	It's been given away free.
9160000	9161000	I don't know how many times.
9161000	9163000	You probably have it in some collection or another.
9163000	9166000	But even if you have to pay a couple bucks for it, it's really reasonable.
9166000	9168000	So, it's a great game.
9168000	9169000	Really hard.
9169000	9171000	Bobby, I guess, took a look at the source code.
9171000	9173000	He's in our chat room saying the game was so terribly written.
9173000	9175000	The source code is amazing.
9175000	9178000	Just shows that games are a patchwork of crappy code.
9178000	9180000	And that means your code doesn't have to be perfect.
9180000	9181000	It just has to work.
9181000	9182000	Ain't that the truth?
9182000	9183000	Ain't that the truth?
9183000	9184000	All right.
9184000	9188000	And lastly tonight, before we start to look at our Discord to see if we have any calls,
9188000	9191000	over at vognetwork.com slash Discord,
9191000	9195000	has to do with Steam kind of revamping the way that they work soundtracks.
9195000	9199000	So, now you don't have to actually own a video game in order to have the soundtrack
9199000	9205000	because previously soundtracks were quantified or categorized, I suppose, as DLC.
9205000	9206000	They're taking that away.
9206000	9209000	So, now it is a soundtrack app type.
9209000	9215000	So, it will let you use a soundtrack and then you can manage that within the Steam library.
9215000	9220000	And apparently a developer can convert their DLC to soundtrack stuff today.
9220000	9222000	And that will work.
9222000	9228000	And then some folks are saying this could mean that technically you could have a game that was exclusive to Epic Store,
9228000	9230000	but they could still sell the soundtrack on Steam.
9230000	9233000	I don't know whether Steam would want to list that or not, but who knows?
9233000	9239000	I guess it depends on the agreement between all those folks and the publisher.
9239000	9243000	I went into my Steam library today to see if I had anything that was like soundtracks,
9243000	9244000	but I didn't see anything yet.
9244000	9247000	But I'm thinking maybe things just haven't been converted.
9247000	9249000	I don't usually buy a lot of standalone soundtracks either,
9249000	9255000	but I figured I bought enough combo stuff on Steam that probably got, you know what I mean?
9255000	9257000	I had stuff included.
9257000	9262000	Like, you bought the exclusive Year of the Whatever edition that comes with the soundtrack, you know what I mean?
9262000	9264000	But I hadn't seen any of that when I went into my Steam library.
9264000	9268000	Well, a lot of that stuff that I have with soundtracks tends to be in Humble Store,
9268000	9270000	so I have a ton of soundtracks sitting in there.
9270000	9272000	That's very true.
9272000	9277000	Anyway, the soundtrack feature should debut on January 20th.
9277000	9279000	Oh, I see. It's still behind the scenes right now.
9279000	9281000	Maybe that's why I'm not really seeing everything there.
9281000	9284000	So, right now is the conversions kind of going on behind the scenes.
9284000	9287000	So, maybe you'll see more when that officially launches.
9287000	9290000	Valve is not turning into a music store or anything like this.
9290000	9295000	This is just a way for them to kind of put soundtracks in their own category
9295000	9297000	and let them stand on their own,
9297000	9300000	as opposed to being a footnote to something that comes with the game.
9300000	9304000	So, I think that's kind of a nice little change if nothing else.
9306000	9307000	Excuse me.
9307000	9308000	All right.
9308000	9312000	So, I'm going to check our green room over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
9312000	9316000	While I take a peek there, do we want to get into any last-minute stories?
9316000	9317000	Yes.
9317000	9322000	Let's talk about Minecraft, School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
9322000	9330000	It's a four-year project that brings a Harry Potter-themed RPG to vanilla Minecraft.
9330000	9333000	And it's a project right now that's being supported by Patreon.
9333000	9338000	They're hoping to release it later this month for free.
9338000	9346000	And it's, I guess, from the Floo Networks, which is a YouTube group.
9346000	9347000	So, interesting.
9347000	9349000	They have different stuff you can do in there.
9349000	9353000	They have different classes, summoning Patronuses.
9353000	9356000	You can do Quidditch.
9356000	9357000	Looks pretty amazing, actually.
9357000	9361000	I'm all for people seizing Harry Potter and making it their own right now.
9361000	9362000	That's pretty cool.
9362000	9364000	With everything that's going out in the world.
9364000	9365000	Right, Dark Sakura?
9365000	9367000	It now belongs to the fans, right?
9367000	9368000	It belongs to the fans.
9368000	9369000	Just don't give it any money.
9369000	9371000	Harry Potter belongs to the fans now.
9371000	9372000	It looks pretty amazing.
9372000	9373000	It's a great way to do it.
9373000	9376000	Like, it's seriously pretty awesome looking.
9376000	9379000	So, check that out hopefully later this month.
9379000	9380000	I may have to check that out later this month.
9380000	9382000	It looks pretty cool.
9382000	9384000	All right, anything else?
9384000	9386000	Ah, that's it.
9386000	9389000	At least that's all I found.
9389000	9392000	They have stuff on the postage stamps and stuff that didn't make the show roll.
9392000	9393000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
9393000	9396000	They're going to have some classic game postage stamps for Royal Mail.
9396000	9397000	I'm eating popcorn.
9397000	9398000	It's really good.
9398000	9399000	So, that was kind of...
9399000	9401000	Is it the best?
9401000	9402000	That was kind of neat.
9402000	9407000	I thought it was funny, though, because, well, it's, you know, because it's, you know, the
9407000	9410000	Royal Mail, so it's obviously, you know, European games.
9410000	9413000	So, they have like Worms, Dizzy was one of the ones in there.
9413000	9418000	Like, some of these games that you may not think, well, Dizzy, I know that's not really
9418000	9419000	popular over here.
9419000	9423000	No, but it was a huge, it was either, was it a Commodore game or is that X Spectrum
9423000	9424000	game?
9424000	9425000	I don't remember.
9425000	9428000	But it was, I do know, I know Dizzy.
9428000	9429000	Dizzy was released here.
9429000	9430000	We have a version of it.
9430000	9434000	It just wasn't as big of a title here as it was in the UK.
9434000	9435000	Right.
9435000	9438000	And then I'm trying to remember the other ones real quick.
9438000	9441000	I'm trying to pull it up.
9441000	9442000	Let's see.
9442000	9444000	I don't know.
9444000	9448000	It was just a few games, but I'm surprised they haven't done anything like that over
9448000	9449000	here yet.
9449000	9454000	Like, any sort of, like, have they done any classic gaming stamps over here?
9454000	9457000	No, ours really tend to be people.
9457000	9459000	Aren't there like Pac-Man ones?
9459000	9460000	There might have been.
9460000	9463000	I feel like there might have been, like, some 80s ones, but, um, well, you can make your
9463000	9466000	own damn stamp in this day and age, you know?
9466000	9467000	Yeah, right.
9467000	9468000	Okay.
9468000	9469000	Well, okay.
9469000	9470000	So they have, let's see here.
9470000	9471000	So it looks like it is...
9471000	9473000	Tomb Raider, Worms, and other...
9473000	9474000	Elite.
9474000	9483000	They've got Sensible Soccer, Wipeout, Dizzy, Worms, Lemmings, Micro Machines, and Populous.
9483000	9485000	Those are all very, like, UK-developed games.
9485000	9488000	So it's a pretty good list to use there.
9488000	9489000	I like that.
9489000	9490000	So.
9490000	9491000	And apparently, they were...
9491000	9498000	It says the chosen franchises were nominated by the British gaming body, Yuki, and they
9498000	9499000	were...
9499000	9501000	Let's see.
9501000	9509000	As well as, apparently, they had the Mean Machines editor-journalist Julian Jazz Ragnell,
9509000	9517000	and author Sam Dyer, who put together some gaming compendiums like Commodore 64, a visual
9517000	9521000	compendium, and the Metal Slug, The Ultimate History.
9521000	9525000	Now, my next question is, when was the last time any of you sent a piece of mail?
9525000	9529000	I actually send cards regularly to my mother.
9529000	9530000	Oh, that's...
9530000	9531000	Okay.
9531000	9532000	I get that.
9532000	9533000	And to other people.
9533000	9546000	So it looks like there were some stamps for the US that were designed and approved, but
9546000	9547000	not set up.
9547000	9550000	Here's another thing I was going to talk about.
9550000	9551000	Wait, I have something.
9551000	9552000	Can I have...
9552000	9553000	I want to hear a story.
9553000	9555000	No, I think this one's important, actually.
9555000	9561000	Because Infinity Ward announced this week that they will be donating the proceeds of,
9561000	9565000	for Call of Duty Modern Warfare, there is an Outback pack that is coming out.
9565000	9566000	Well, what do we need to be thinking about?
9566000	9570000	We're thinking about the Outback right now, those horrific wildfires that are going on
9570000	9571000	all over Australia.
9571000	9573000	Like, it is bad, you guys.
9573000	9578000	So 100% of the net proceeds from Activision's Outback pack.
9578000	9580000	So that's kind of neat.
9580000	9581000	Yeah, that's neat.
9581000	9583000	Yeah, especially for such a cause that's so...
9583000	9584000	Ugh.
9584000	9586000	Hoping all my friends down there are safe.
9586000	9590000	Another thing that was shown off at CES this year was some new PCs by Origin.
9590000	9597000	And so what makes these kind of unique is they, this is kind of a following up their
9597000	9599000	PC called the Big O.
9599000	9605000	So it's basically a computer and console built into one tower.
9605000	9612000	So you have the PlayStation 4 Pro and then the Xbox One's sad.
9612000	9615000	Is it guaranteed to give you a Big O?
9615000	9616000	Maybe.
9616000	9618000	No, but it's actually got some pretty cool stuff.
9618000	9622000	So they have, not only on the PC side do they have an actual PC and everything, but they
9622000	9624000	also have a capture card.
9624000	9631000	So you can stream your console games and capture with one box, which is kind of cool.
9631000	9633000	The problem is, though, is the price is pretty expensive.
9633000	9639000	So you've got, it's $2,500 is what it starts at.
9639000	9640000	Alright.
9640000	9641000	That's neat, I guess.
9641000	9642000	Alright.
9642000	9645000	Well, no calls are waiting to come in and that's okay because we've run a little long
9645000	9646000	tonight.
9646000	9647000	What a shock.
9647000	9650000	So I think we're getting ready to wrap up shop here tonight.
9650000	9654000	Thank you guys, of course, for tuning in tonight, staying up late with us.
9654000	9657000	And if you're listening on the podcast feed, hey, you are wonderful too.
9657000	9660000	I do want to remind everybody, no show next week.
9660000	9661000	We're not even going to tape something in advance.
9661000	9663000	We're giving ourselves a week off.
9663000	9669000	And I think, I don't want to sound cocky or egotistical, but I think we deserve it.
9669000	9671000	We worked through the holidays.
9671000	9672000	We had a show every week during the holidays.
9672000	9676000	So we're going to take our holiday a little late this year.
9676000	9679000	But excuse me, sorry, popcorn kernel.
9679000	9683000	But speaking of holiday, let's not forget Martin Luther King Jr.
9683000	9686000	because we're getting a long weekend because of that.
9686000	9690000	So just, you know, you might want to take a minute to just kind of reflect on what the
9690000	9695000	things he had to say might mean for you and what you can do to help live out that dream.
9695000	9700000	But we'll be back to do that again in two weeks or to do our show again in two weeks.
9700000	9705000	And I'm hoping, I don't want to over promise and deliver, but I'm hoping we're going to
9705000	9712000	have some fun little changes in the next couple of weeks and really bring OLR into 2020.
9712000	9715000	So Orange Laundry, Orange Laundry for a new decade.
9715000	9719000	Well, it took us how long to get out of 1995?
9719000	9720000	What year is it?
9720000	9723000	It's not 1995 still.
9723000	9726000	Of course, everyone knows I'm talking about the computer.
9726000	9727000	All right.
9727000	9729000	Yeah, well, oh, this computer?
9729000	9730000	The last one.
9730000	9731000	It's on XP.
9731000	9732000	Oh, XP.
9732000	9733000	Yeah.
9733000	9735000	So out of 2002.
9735000	9736000	Yeah.
9736000	9737000	Yeah.
9737000	9738000	All right.
9738000	9741000	So we will not be back next week, but we will be back in two weeks.
9741000	9743000	And we look forward to seeing you all then.
9743000	9744000	So you know what that means?
9744000	9747000	This week, gaming news is going to blow the fuck up.
9747000	9749000	So hold on and look out, everybody.
9749000	9751000	Hold on to your pants.
9751000	9755000	But we hope everybody has a good week and happy gaming and all that good stuff.
9755000	9757000	If you liked what you heard here at Orange Laundry Radio, tell a friend about the show
9757000	9759000	because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
9759000	9763000	But if the voices aren't here to put on air, then we're stuck.
9763000	9768000	So get more people and a nice five star review on a site like iTunes goes an awful long way.
9768000	9770000	And we really appreciate it.
9770000	9774000	So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts and check on out of here.
9774000	9776000	So Dark Soccer, I know you're ready for a nap.
9776000	9778000	So I am super freaking tired.
9778000	9781000	Like it's just with everything going on.
9781000	9783000	I have to go back to work tomorrow.
9783000	9785000	Real life is happening again.
9785000	9787000	Just oh, my God, I'm tired.
9787000	9788000	Fair enough.
9788000	9790000	Do you have an official final thought or?
9790000	9791000	Oh, my God, I'm tired.
9791000	9792000	OK.
9792000	9795000	My final thought tonight is kettle corn.
9795000	9797000	Yum. Thanks, Dark Soccer.
9797000	9799000	I'm glad I didn't get all stuck in my teeth.
9799000	9800000	That's why I always don't like eating.
9800000	9802000	I had to pick a half a kernel out of my gums, though.
9802000	9804000	That was freaking weird.
9804000	9806000	It's like the tooth armor no one wants.
9806000	9809000	I almost always, always have to like after eating popcorn,
9809000	9814000	like go get my vibrating toothbrush and get everything out of there or actually pleasure your mouth.
9814000	9815000	The vibe.
9815000	9820000	I will tell you what has changed my life in that regard is, though, the water pick that shoots the water.
9820000	9822000	But nothing gets stuck.
9822000	9824000	So I just use those little flossers.
9824000	9826000	You know, a lot of people do that, too.
9826000	9828000	Last but not least, Loki, your final thought.
9828000	9831000	I can't wait to get my rollerblades this week.
9831000	9836000	I ordered. OK, so like I ordered about nineteen ninety five.
9836000	9843000	Well, I wanted my kids got skates, so I wanted to get new new blades in because I used to.
9843000	9847000	Technically, it's in landscape, so whatever.
9847000	9852000	So I used to rollerblade a ton when I was, you know, in high school and all that.
9852000	9854000	And I still do pretty well with it.
9854000	9859000	So I decided to get a fancy pair of skates from France.
9859000	9869000	And they're only sold they don't sell them here because like people that take rollerblading seriously.
9869000	9871000	Not in this country.
9871000	9876000	So I had to import it from Canada and they only come in European sizes.
9876000	9882000	So my dumb ass decided to try to measure my foot correctly and ordered them.
9882000	9884000	And I did.
9884000	9887000	And I even increased the size and they were too small.
9887000	9890000	And then I looked at my shoe and I'm like, son of a bitch.
9890000	9892000	There's European sizes in my shoe.
9892000	9896000	I could have ordered the fucking correct size in the first place.
9896000	9897000	So I had to do all that crap.
9897000	9898000	At least they were pretty good.
9898000	9901000	They shipped it back for free.
9901000	9903000	They cross shipped the other one.
9903000	9904000	So I'll get them this week.
9904000	9905000	But I was so disappointed.
9905000	9907000	I want to go bleeding this weekend.
9907000	9910000	Be curious to get my Vibrams.
9910000	9913000	Have a good time at the broccoli farm.
9913000	9915000	Have a good time in San Francisco.
9915000	9917000	And I will have a good time at the musical.
9917000	9918000	So everybody have a good time.
9918000	9920000	You have a good time out there.
9920000	9923000	No matter what it is you're doing this week, even if you're just sitting on your butt playing games all week.
9923000	9925000	I hope those games are awesome.
9925000	9928000	We will see you in 14 days to do this all over again.
9928000	9930000	Until then, have a great week everybody.
9930000	9931000	Good night.
9956000	9959000	But you know they were all still true.
9961000	9963000	See you next week.
9985000	9988000	Thank you.
