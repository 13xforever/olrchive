Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
This week it's the year of Super Baseball 2020 and in the timeline of reality we're still trying to get automated calls of balls and strikes into the MLB.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Never forget about the veracity of those resistance change.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
It's been a quiet week but we'll share what we can starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with the first show of the year, January the 5th, 2020, episode number 805.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me, as you can see on Twitch TV, is Loki.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Yes, they can't really see you really well. I have a Double Dare shirt on.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Oh, you have to stand up and model it at some point. When you're done eating your salad I see you're-

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
It's fine.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Very healthy choices in 2020.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Not really, it's a Caesar salad so it's not that-

01:02.000 --> 01:10.000
It is healthier, it is- I could have gotten pizza but the salad- they have this promotion going on at Mod Pizza where-

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Hold up, don't name them if they ain't paying us.

01:13.000 --> 01:22.000
At a pizza place that has an app that if you buy up to four salads in the month of January you get four salads free in February.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
So I was like, okay, sure, their salad was alright the first time I had so I've been- actually I've had like four of these already this week so-

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
I mean, it's good, they're a little on the pricey side but it's hard to get a good salad because-

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
And I will name them because their salads suck. Subway? Not-

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
No, not-

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
I'm with you, there's some places that very clearly just put like the stale lettuce in a bowl and like throw it with other stuff.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
It is not-

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
You gotta have the right mix, you do.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Not good.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
On a more serious note, not joining us tonight is Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
Unfortunately, and some of you that follow her on social media may have heard, her mother-in-law passed away.

01:58.000 --> 02:05.000
So for those of you that know Dan, because he's been on the show, those of you who've been listening a long time, that would be Dan's mom passed away this past week.

02:05.000 --> 02:13.000
So as you can imagine, just there's a lot going on and Dark Sakura kind of needs to be there for Dan and the whole family right now.

02:13.000 --> 02:20.000
So definitely our thoughts are with her and sending Dan, of course, and sending that whole family some warmth and vibes.

02:20.000 --> 02:27.000
And we're expecting that she'll be back next week but certainly they can take all the time that they're gonna need for that situation.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
So again, our thoughts go out to them.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
Because of that, we had teased a few things on last week's show.

02:33.000 --> 02:41.000
We talked about doing the time capsule tonight and doing the games of the year tonight because this week was expected to be another slow news week.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
But I think you'll all understand that I want to put that off another week so that Dark Sakura can be here to participate in that segment.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
So we're gonna make do tonight with what little news there is.

02:49.000 --> 02:56.000
There isn't a lot, I almost feel like in some ways the news this week is almost lighter than it was last week.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Well, how was your New Year's? Let me ask that.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
It was alright. We kept the kids up until nine so they could watch the ball drop thing.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
And the only nine o'clock feed of the ball drop that we had was CNN.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
And they're terrible. Anderson Cooper is just not...

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
It's not the same without category.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
It's not good at all.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
Their bits that they were doing were just like, it was really cringey.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
And I was like, okay, no, we're not watching this.

03:25.000 --> 03:33.000
Because we'd flipped it to them, they were reading Goodnight 2019 and thinking that Goodnight Moon in the book and stuff.

03:33.000 --> 03:40.000
And it was awful. So we just kept flipping between that and the Food Network until it finally did the countdown and then that was it.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
I fell asleep at 1130. I was feeling some sort of way because I'm like, nobody's having a party this year.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
But then you have to remember, well, I could have had a party, but I don't want to clean.

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
And then it's like, it's a Tuesday night. It's one of the worst nights to have a big celebration.

03:54.000 --> 04:01.000
Next year will be better because I think next year Christmas and New Year's fall on a Friday. So that'll be fine.

04:01.000 --> 04:10.000
Yeah. Anyway, we're going to get into what news there is this week. I do want to mention, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at The Voice of Geeks Network.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
vog.network.com. That's vognetwork.com. Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
We started about six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern. Right after, of course, our friend Bobby.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
I know there's a lot going on tonight, too. Tonight just feels awesome.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Golden Globes.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
I know the Golden Globes are going on tonight, which I don't really care about award shows anymore.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
Like I used to be that guy that, you know, got all excited about the Oscars.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
Then I started doing this show and it's like it was my Sunday nights and then I don't go to the movies as much.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
So it's like, oh, these movies got nominated. I didn't see any of them, you know.

04:43.000 --> 04:50.000
And the Globes especially are just weird because it's only what the group is like, not even 90 people that vote on those things.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
There was that great email. I think it was from Flocko. I hope I'm not misattributing that.

04:54.000 --> 05:01.000
But there was a great email that was comparing the video game awards to the Golden Globes because it's a very small committee that actually votes on them.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
So it's kind of kind of interesting comparison there. Those are on the night, of course.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
Awesome Games Done Quick is right now.

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
And I can completely understand if you're you're watching that instead of this tonight, because it's a great charity event.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
You know, it happens a couple of times a year. People are really excited about that.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
I know some people have told me I have O.L.R. in one window and Awesome Games in the other muted.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
And it's like, whatever. And then many people, of course, are listening on the podcast feed because they were doing something else live on Sunday.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
Yeah, if it's if for me, like Awesome Games Done Quick is great to watch when you can live.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
But I just mostly catch up on that stuff when it hits YouTube.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Yeah. When they when they segment. That's true. They archive everything as well.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
So, yeah, because that is for me, like sometimes like I can see them till three in the morning to watch like a Taskbot slot or something like that,

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
even though that would be pretty awesome. I can't do that.

05:49.000 --> 05:56.000
So I'm looking at some of the comments in chat because, again, we take a big thank you to despite everything else going on live tonight.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
And I know it's like the last day of holiday break for like students and, you know, many.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
So is this a lot going on tonight? But a big shout out to those of you that are joining us in chat.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
Let's see. Misty O.L.R. says, I deliberately went to bed before midnight, even though I didn't really have to get up until about 8 a.m.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
Yeah, I was I just at some point I was like, what's the point in staying up?

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
I'll just say Happy New Year, Alan, and then go to bed. And I love the way Alan put it.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
Alan wrote an Instagram story later that night that put 2020 can wait for me.

06:25.000 --> 06:31.000
Good night. And I'm like, I like that. I'm going to use that one and explaining it to people.

06:31.000 --> 06:37.000
And then Tiger saying, sadly, I have to go back to work tomorrow. So I'll miss most of the day coverage of awesome games done quick.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
But we'll watch the rest of the live streaming after work. Yeah. So I'm sure there's a lot of people going back to work and all that good stuff tomorrow.

06:43.000 --> 06:50.000
As that says, because the show is shorter tonight, we should do a half hour of O.P.R. live on stream or Niantic Wayfarer.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
Is that I'm trying to you and I got to do a YouTube on that stuff. We should I be down for that.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
I don't I don't have it all set up to stream like the window and all that stuff.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
So I need prep. I need prep time and make something that you just bring up a Web page in there.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
It's not that it's take take me too long to futz around there live. So it's fine.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
Oh, yeah. We'll do it. I want to do the YouTube thing. You can watch that on demand whenever you want.

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
So. All right. We'll get into our gaming weeks in a little bit so we can talk about what video games we've been playing throughout the new year.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
But first, we're going to talk about one of the big news stories to kind of hit in the past few days.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
And that is a leak of sorts of the Final Fantasy 7 demo.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
So it seems like it is confirmed that there will be a Final Fantasy 7.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
We all know I'm talking about the remake. I'm not talking about a game from the 90s.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
The Final Fantasy 7 remake demo. There was rumors that one existed.

07:40.000 --> 07:47.000
And now there very clearly is one because there is video evidence of one being played in multiple places.

07:47.000 --> 07:53.000
Loki, how are they getting this demo? Because you can't you can't go on to the PlayStation Store, at least not tonight, and get that demo.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Maybe by the time some of you hear they have.

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
But there's now there's different things for like modded systems or whatever to download updates and patches and whatnot.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
So they have a certain file structure to how they store everything on the storefront.

08:05.000 --> 08:13.000
A lot of it has that PlayStation ID with the system and then the catalog ID for the actual piece of software.

08:13.000 --> 08:21.000
So they could find out what the idea is for the demo and basically find the page for it, even though it's not listed on the storefront.

08:21.000 --> 08:27.000
And so using a third party tool that they design could download the demo to their system and play it.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
All right. So did you know you didn't you didn't watch any of the demo? I haven't watched any of it.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Well, how convenient, because I've got all right here.

08:36.000 --> 08:42.000
But before I click the button to start it, because I know some people are very hypersensitive to spoilers, especially when it comes to the Final Fantasy universe.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I am going to warn you, I'm going to play some of the leaked footage.

08:44.000 --> 08:51.000
I'm only going to play the very beginning of it, the actual what it would be akin to the opening movie.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
This cuts off when the player takes over as cloud. And that's about as much as I allowed myself.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
So this is literally the first two minutes after pressing start.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
If that is still a problem for you, you may want to avert your eyes and ears for about two minutes while I bring this up.

09:05.000 --> 09:11.000
So here is, if you haven't already seen it for yourself, some of the leaked footage from the Final Fantasy 7 remake demo.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
And you can see...

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
I'm pretty sure some of this has been in trailers, too.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Yeah. Oh, I'm sure many people have seen this in trailers.

09:16.000 --> 09:25.000
But now you actually kind of get to see it in motion, which I think is very interesting, because then I start comparing what I'm looking at here and like the opening shot of Aerith's eyes.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
You know, and kind of the the life, you know, stream kind of pouring out here.

09:29.000 --> 09:35.000
I kind of start to compare this to, oh, what I remember in Final Fantasy 7 when I first played it.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
That's how I remembered it.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Yeah.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
It wasn't like that, though.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
What's interesting. Yeah, it definitely did not look this good.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
In my mind, it did.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
What's interesting about the leaked footage is that, OK, it mixes with some of those memories in the original.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
You remember that she walked out onto the street and all that.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
But then it gets into a sequence. This wasn't in the...

09:52.000 --> 09:59.000
Because how did they render people bumping into her and like actually stepping on a flower and all this stuff?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
That was a cut scene. It was...

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Was it? I don't remember it. I don't remember.

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
But then I definitely don't remember that it very faintly plays One-Wing Angel in the back.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
That I don't remember.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
Yeah, you hear that. If you listen very, very carefully, you can actually hear some of the chorus from that.

10:14.000 --> 10:22.000
And then, you know, you see a lot of the familiar stuff where it's zooming out into the world and the music sounds phenomenal.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
I know it's very hard to hear in the studio and it's down way low so you guys can hear us.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
But the music in this sounds really phenomenal.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
It looks great.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Yeah, it really does.

10:31.000 --> 10:38.000
I mean, it looks like... You remember when they had like a PlayStation 3 concept thing that did this very similar type of opening?

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
It's like even better than that, obviously, because now we're looking at a PlayStation 4.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Someday PlayStation 5 game, yeah.

10:44.000 --> 10:51.000
And then I think what's also interesting is that when the logo comes up on the screen, it actually does call it Final Fantasy VII Remake.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
It doesn't call it Final Fantasy VII, it calls itself the Final Fantasy VII Remake.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
So, which, I mean, I know that's what the game is called, but I was just surprised it didn't stick with...

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
It's just Final Fantasy VII, it's still that story.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
And then the big zoom in with the train cut-ins, like it's just...

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
It almost gives me goosebumps to see like the exact same type of like cuts here.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
So, anyway, that's about, yeah, that's about as far as I went with it there.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
So, the rest, you'll have to wait until that demo is officially released.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Probably soon.

11:18.000 --> 11:25.000
Yeah, I'm assuming if people are already kind of backdooring into the store to get it, they might have set it up before the holidays.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
So that way when, you know, everybody's back in the office next week, come Thursday or so, or whenever this holiday...

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
When's the holiday sale over?

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Well, they tend to...

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Probably when it's going up.

11:34.000 --> 11:40.000
I believe that they're updating everything on Thursday, because Thursday is usually when they do the updates for like PlayStation Plus and all that stuff.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
So, maybe that'll be like, throw it up there for everybody at the same time.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Yeah. So, how did you feel about seeing that?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
It looks good.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Doesn't it?

11:49.000 --> 11:55.000
Like, and it's interesting because for all the, why are they remaking VII out of all the games they could have remade?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Why are they doing VII?

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
And, you know, all that stuff, I'm like, dang, the more...

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
I can't wait for VI to be remade that way.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
I wish, I wish.

12:02.000 --> 12:08.000
The more and more I see the footage from Final Fantasy VII and I see the game, I'm like, dang, this looks like it's gonna be better.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Like, it really is.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
It does. It's like pretty awesome.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
I'm just, I'm like, the battle system, even though they completely changed it, it looks like 15 but fun.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Don't they still have the old battle system in there?

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Don't they have like a turn-based battle system in there as well?

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
Yeah, I think it was like 15 where you can kind of flip it either way.

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
You can do a live one or you can do an active time type of thing.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Yeah.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Yeah. Gonna be very interesting.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Ezet in chat says, please tell me we can skip summon cutscenes.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Knights of the Round, OMG.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Probably.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
I can't see how that isn't a thing but summons are also gonna be different because aren't you summoning them onto the battlefield?

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
Like, it wasn't like it was in VII where they just did one attack and that was it.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
Like, didn't they show some stuff from E3?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
I don't remember.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
I want to say they showed a bit with Efreet and he actually kind of like takes over the battle.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
It's similar to XII.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
I don't remember.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Kind of what that looked like anyway.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
So.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
But I imagine they've learned their lesson.

13:02.000 --> 13:07.000
They did add a skip summon thing to the Final Fantasy X remaster.

13:07.000 --> 13:14.000
So I can't imagine they didn't learn that lesson for Final Fantasy VII when they redo that.

13:14.000 --> 13:21.000
One other thing we should talk about when it comes to Final Fantasy VII isn't quite related to the same demo leak.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Well, no, I guess it is.

13:22.000 --> 13:28.000
Because some folks, now that the demo's leaked, they're going in and they are tearing apart the files.

13:28.000 --> 13:36.000
In fact, apparently a rough version of what does cross-dressing cloud in that one sequence in the game, that is out there now.

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
So if you're trying to keep that a secret, you might want to, you know, just be careful what you look up in the next couple months.

13:41.000 --> 13:49.000
But also, they've been tearing through those files and they found that the Final Fantasy VII remake apparently is going to be coming to PC.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
There are many signs in the demo that a PC port is coming.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
There is PC code still left inside and it mentions higher resolutions with Nvidia and AMD stuff.

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
Well, I bet those higher resolutions are going to be a PlayStation 5 thing as well.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
Wait for it. Wait for it. I bet that's what happens.

14:04.000 --> 14:10.000
This comes out on PlayStation 4 in March and then at some point, probably before the next, you know, chapter of the remake,

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
we're going to see a PlayStation 5 and then that's also going to be like when it comes out on PC and all that stuff.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
I think that almost seems like a given at that point.

14:17.000 --> 14:24.000
So would you be more interested in playing this? Are you going to, knowing that that is a factor,

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
I'm kind of curious with this in chat as well.

14:26.000 --> 14:33.000
Are you going to wait for Final Fantasy VII on a PC environment or nah, I'm going to jump in on PS4.

14:33.000 --> 14:39.000
No, PS4 because my PC is not going to be able to push. I don't have a monitor that's 4K.

14:39.000 --> 14:47.000
I don't have, you know, the hardware that can push something that nice looking.

14:47.000 --> 14:54.000
So I would think picking it up on PlayStation 4 because most likely when it does come out on PlayStation 5,

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
I'm sure there'll be something, hey, you own the PlayStation 4 version. It's a free upgrade because it's digital or whatever.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
And so I'll just do that.

15:01.000 --> 15:07.000
Cool. Sounds good. I am, yeah, I'm just going to buy it on PlayStation 4 because I can't wait.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
I can't, I, you know, I have no problem buying games multiple times.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Oh no, I can only buy it once.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
Yeah, no, I'll buy it on PlayStation 4 and then I won't get the PC one right away.

15:18.000 --> 15:23.000
I'll wait till it like goes on sale, but we're talking a couple of years out of the year, many years out at this point.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
It's going to be just think in the scope of this year, but by the end of the year,

15:27.000 --> 15:35.000
we're going to be talking in terms of PlayStation 5, X, XX and like all this different stuff is going to be just in the scope of a year.

15:35.000 --> 15:41.000
So, all right. Well, anyway, I hope you guys are as excited from S7 Remake as I am.

15:41.000 --> 15:46.000
So let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing this week.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
So, Loki, we'll start with you, even though we were talking a little bit about this before the show.

15:49.000 --> 15:55.000
Well, I haven't been playing much of Pokemon Go and Minecraft Earth,

15:55.000 --> 16:02.000
although I did play a little bit Minecraft Earth the other day because I want to just do more of the adventure stuff.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
I don't play it too much because it drains my phone battery like a ton.

16:06.000 --> 16:13.000
And especially if like I'm out, usually we'll have like a dead period of time between when my son does his coding class,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
we go to lunch to when he has his piano class.

16:15.000 --> 16:23.000
And so some of that time may be going to a park and then usually I'll do the, you know, AR stuff there for Minecraft.

16:23.000 --> 16:31.000
And so I didn't want to use it too much because I still want to have battery power left so I can play other games while he's doing his piano lessons.

16:32.000 --> 16:44.000
But I've been playing Orna all week and so I'm up to level 80 now and I'm playing as a rogue right now.

16:44.000 --> 16:50.000
And yeah, so that's pretty much been my week is just Orna.

16:50.000 --> 16:56.000
Why are so many OLR people, and for those watching on Twitch, yes, that is Mr. Smoosh towards the bottom of your screen.

16:56.000 --> 17:07.000
And he keeps, he's looking at the TV. He's looking at us on the TV because we have a, we have a television that's over here where you can actually see everything so we can see the output, what's going up to the stream.

17:07.000 --> 17:14.000
And Mr. Smoosh is enthralled with watching us on the TV, even though we're right here in front of him.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
It's just really funny. I don't understand. Anyway.

17:17.000 --> 17:24.000
He's like, wait a second. Wait, you're right here. But you're up there too. What is going on? I don't understand.

17:25.000 --> 17:32.000
Why do you think so many people that are listening to OLR when I bring up this Orna game are like getting into it and getting obsessed?

17:32.000 --> 17:43.000
Because it's a game unlike Pokemon Go and like Pokemon Go and Minecraft Earth or Ingress and stuff like that.

17:43.000 --> 17:51.000
When you're playing those AR games, it is focused a lot on being able to go out and go to different places like you're really limited interest.

17:51.000 --> 17:57.000
You're really limited to what you can do in the game just sitting at your house.

17:57.000 --> 18:08.000
Whereas Orna, you could sit there and play as long as you can on there and you can level up like I have to level 80 or whatever just by playing the game constantly.

18:09.000 --> 18:20.000
So it's kind of cool also because like, say, there are like a lot of locations that are around my neighborhood that I assume people have put down, but I don't know.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Some of that may be generated by the game as well.

18:22.000 --> 18:28.000
You can, if you tap on something, look in the corner because it'll say who did it.

18:28.000 --> 18:36.000
But I don't know if it's like somebody actually did it or if it's like a randomly generated NPC character that owner of the shop or whatever.

18:36.000 --> 18:47.000
Well, OK, so not to get too far into my gaming week, but I was playing a little bit of Ingress this week and we were doing what we call an op, which means we were throwing a very big field, which took a lot of people.

18:47.000 --> 18:53.000
And for me, I had to go out to the middle of nowhere to do my part about 30 minutes outside of town.

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
So I was sitting in pitch black and, you know, I can't sit there and play Ingress or anything.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
I have to kind of wait for, you know, things to happen.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
I want to say too much about how that works, but I wanted to do something.

19:05.000 --> 19:12.000
So I brought up Orna and I'm literally in the middle of nowhere and there were still things to kill and a blacksmith right on top of where I was at.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
So I was like, well, this is kind of funny.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
So I can't imagine anyone willingly built a blacksmith out there.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
So there definitely is.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Yeah, I'm sure there's some of that.

19:20.000 --> 19:33.000
But so that's that's what's kind of nice is like, say, for example, like when I first started off, I could see an item shop on my screen, but it was a lot of times it was out of range or the way where it is,

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
is like right below my player icon at the bottom of the screen.

19:36.000 --> 19:42.000
So I can't tap around it because the hitbox for that is overlapping where the item shop is.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
So I'm like, this is annoying, but like I could walk out, you know, in front of my house and hit it from there.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
But so I say, OK, whatever, I'm just going to build one in which you can do that.

19:51.000 --> 19:56.000
You can build your own like points of interest, I guess, on the map by your house.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
And then there's other things around, too.

19:59.000 --> 20:05.000
So like, you know, whereas I wanted to get, you know, upgrade my weapons, you have to do that blacksmith shop.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
So there's one down the street for me I can go to.

20:07.000 --> 20:13.000
But it's not always convenient if I want to play at home to do that or like, oh, crap, I didn't drive by it to pick up my equipment.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Now I have to use some other equipment instead.

20:16.000 --> 20:21.000
So you can, you know, focus yourself on the game and you can actually spend.

20:21.000 --> 20:28.000
You know, resources to build one of those places nearby and you can share with everybody or you can just keep it to yourself.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
Yeah. And as that in chat says, tell them about my house. Nine shops.

20:32.000 --> 20:43.000
Yes. No, he but she's pointing a neon light on where she lives, because if you go I don't want to say if you go to the neighborhood that direction across and you drive around, you're going to look for a big cluster.

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
And I'll be like, oh, is that lives here? But she doesn't technically have to make those all public.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
Oh, only party members can see. Yeah, there's you'll see it.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
So, yeah, you can you can know that. Yeah, you can create that.

20:55.000 --> 21:01.000
You can create your your shop so that they're only you can see it or only your party members can see it.

21:01.000 --> 21:07.000
So you don't have to. That actually makes me feel a lot better because I don't want certain people knowing where I live.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
So I don't want to build a bunch of that stuff. But if you can hide it. Yeah, you can hide it.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
It's really easy. Yeah. The friends I'm in a party with, they all know where I live. So that's fine.

21:14.000 --> 21:21.000
OK. Yeah. So, yeah, it's pretty cool. So that's what I like about it is like that you can play it constantly and do stuff in there.

21:21.000 --> 21:30.000
The only time that you might want to drive around a lot is if you're really trying to hit like those daily quests where you have to kill certain types of creatures, because a lot of times they may not spawn by your house.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
That's what Bobby's complaining about is so far I haven't been able to complete the boss quest yet.

21:34.000 --> 21:39.000
I don't know if this will help, but if you tap on the name of the city in the upper right, is that where it is?

21:39.000 --> 21:46.000
It actually shows you nearby bosses that you can kill to take over territory. And so you might find what you're looking for in there.

21:46.000 --> 21:52.000
But I usually just I actually the nice thing about the game for me, I take a walk around the neighborhood and I don't have to go by the pokey stops.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
I can have Orna up and I still have something to do. So I don't know.

21:56.000 --> 22:02.000
Yeah. And what else? Doing the arenas for me is a lot of experience as well.

22:02.000 --> 22:07.000
And sometimes it's pretty easy because the people that they pair you with can't do damage to you.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
But then again, the reverse is possible as well.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
And somebody was asking, PixelPaka says, does health regen over time? Yes.

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
And if you're a mage, you get a thing that lets you regen mana as you walk.

22:19.000 --> 22:28.000
And that's also nice. That's part of why I like it is because even if an NPC kills you, you're just a ghost at zero health, but you'll regen health over time.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
It's not a big deal. You're not like you don't lose XP. You're not like run back to your grave.

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
You earn so much money doing different things. Like I don't end up spending a lot of stuff in the item shops.

22:37.000 --> 22:45.000
So I I'll sell back some things to the item shops that I can't.

22:45.000 --> 22:51.000
That the materials that I would, you know, transform them into aren't really useful to me.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
So I'll sell back a lot of stuff to the item shop and then I can buy health potions.

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
So I have like a stack of one hundred and forty five health potions right now that I just keep using over and over.

22:59.000 --> 23:05.000
Plus I'm, you know, buying an item shop, you know, at my house so I can just keep buying this up if I need it.

23:05.000 --> 23:12.000
Or an inn or whatever. So really, you know, there's not a whole lot.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
Or the other thing too, familiars. So like you can get a pet.

23:16.000 --> 23:24.000
Like I have a fairy that will occasionally cast a heal spell on me that raises, gives me a hundred hit points.

23:25.000 --> 23:31.000
Although I noticed in the arena somebody had a fairy to where it's only supposed to be twenty five percent of the time that does it.

23:31.000 --> 23:36.000
But it's like I just noticed it like for like a good 10 turns in a row. That fairy has healed you.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
That's a little super fairy, a little B.S. right there. But wow.

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
Well, anyway, these boy, we've been given quite the plug to this game.

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
So, yeah, but it seems like a lot of people that have been listening to show been downloading it and kind of into it.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
It kind of, you know, kind of fills the GPS niche if you're a little burned out.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
It's good for like when you're in between like stops or whatever.

23:57.000 --> 24:04.000
And it's great because like if you are like in a place that's remote, that doesn't have a lot of things nearby.

24:04.000 --> 24:09.000
I mean, you can still have a lot of fun with it without because it's not generate.

24:09.000 --> 24:14.000
They don't generate stuff at points of interest like Pokemon Go where it's a specific locations.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
It's just kind of randomly everywhere. So, yeah.

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
All right. There you go. Orna been taking over a lot of time. Anything else you're giving me?

24:22.000 --> 24:30.000
That's pretty much it. Well, actually, no, there was a game I played called Wrecked that I got for technically free on the e-shop.

24:30.000 --> 24:37.000
So my kids want it. I just thought I'd get it for my kids. It's a you remember it's time the car.

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
I know you remember that. So I don't know. It never came out. Yeah.

24:41.000 --> 24:50.000
Well, the the driving portion of that, the engine that's kind of middleware, I guess I was using for that.

24:50.000 --> 25:00.000
I recognize a lot in these different games that they put out because the people are very lazy and they don't replace the turbo and the the brake sounds that are in the game.

25:00.000 --> 25:10.000
And so, for example, this one, it's basically a game where you drive cars and you do stunts and tricks and you earn points and then the points unlock more cars.

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
And that's it. That's basically the game. It was a buck ninety nine.

25:14.000 --> 25:20.000
So I had like 200 gold coins or whatever in the game. So it's like, oh, free. Cool. And my kids are loving it.

25:20.000 --> 25:25.000
And I did get to play a little bit. It's kind of fun. But I was like, I know what that is. I know how you made that.

25:25.000 --> 25:35.000
I'm like, damn, it's one level and it's just driving around some ramps just in one level and you're selling it for six dollars on the e-shop.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Why didn't I think of that?

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Yeah, why not?

25:39.000 --> 25:45.000
So, but it's fun and they're having a lot of fun with it. And it's all right. I played it a little bit. That's it.

25:45.000 --> 25:51.000
That's it. Let's see. My gaming week. So I know. So Act Up and Chad is saying I'm going to stick with Pokemon Go.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
I have still been playing Pokemon Go just amongst all these other games as well.

25:55.000 --> 26:01.000
I would say Wizards Unite is kind of suffering on the back burner right now because there's no I'm only interested in that game when there's an event going on, when there's not an event going on.

26:01.000 --> 26:06.000
I don't care about Wizards. So it's on the back burner and I'm playing Pokemon Go.

26:06.000 --> 26:14.000
I did a raid for a Regigigas on New Year's Day and it was over 3000 CP because it was weather boosted.

26:14.000 --> 26:21.000
So that was exciting. And then I caught a shiny Pikachu with a hat as I was walking around the other day.

26:21.000 --> 26:26.000
I actually I did a ton of walking yesterday because, you know, New Year, new me.

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
But I'm trying to close my Apple Watch stuff every day, which means 30 minutes of walking.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
And I had a big chunk of time yesterday where I didn't really have anything going on.

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
So I'm like, you know what? I've been wanting to do these Ingress missions downtown.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
So I did 48 missions downtown in Ingress yesterday. That's cool.

26:40.000 --> 26:45.000
That's three banners. And I was playing I was using Bluetooth on Pokemon Go the entire time.

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
So amongst those adventures, I finally caught a shiny Pikachu and a hat.

26:49.000 --> 26:54.000
So that was like my big prize from there. And I did raids. I was raiding with a friend the other day.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
And we got Wobuffet with a hat. We got Raticate with a hat, but no shinies.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
I did hatch the Wurmple though, but no, not shiny, just the Wurmple and a hat.

27:01.000 --> 27:06.000
So I had my party hat collection complete. But yeah, I just don't have the shinies yet.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
So. All right. Other games I've been playing this week.

27:10.000 --> 27:15.000
Continue to play Final Fantasy 14. Shane had a wedding in game today. That was fun.

27:15.000 --> 27:20.000
Him and his in real life husband did like decided to get married in the game as well.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
So it was a cute little thing to go to and check out. Yeah, it's cute, right?

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
So I love that that's like a feature in the game. So I took some pictures and yeah, did all that.

27:27.000 --> 27:33.000
So it was fun and been playing a little bit of Pokemon Shield because I wanted that Magikarp

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
because they had that event where it was really easy to get a shiny Magikarp.

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
And Shane and I were trying to find raids all night one night, didn't get any.

27:41.000 --> 27:47.000
And then the next night he wasn't on and I was just doing random raids and I got one in a random raid.

27:47.000 --> 27:52.000
So I was happy. And I also got my Snorlax, the special Gigantamax one that like his belly

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
looks like the entire world or like a snow globe or something.

27:55.000 --> 28:00.000
So I'm like, OK, done with those events. So played a little Pokemon Shield and very random.

28:00.000 --> 28:05.000
But I was playing Pac-Man Championship Edition two again because I was trying to unlock some more.

28:05.000 --> 28:11.000
I think I last week mentioned I bested my score and then I went back to unlock some trophies this week.

28:11.000 --> 28:16.000
So just a very random PlayStation thing that I was doing. So, yeah, a little bit of this,

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
a little bit of that in the gaming world. Nothing new as of this week.

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
But I'm sure I'll be catching up on things over the next couple of weeks. So that's for sure.

28:24.000 --> 28:29.000
So. All right. Let's get into some gaming news. First, I want to do a few shout outs.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
A little bit of housekeeping here. Speaking of Pokemon Go, which I mentioned a bit ago,

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
I want to give a shout out to the Pokemon Go podcast because they had me back as a special guest this week.

28:38.000 --> 28:43.000
So I was fortunate enough to just be on. I was just on there maybe five weeks ago, six weeks ago,

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
when Pokestop submissions became new. But one of their hosts was out again.

28:47.000 --> 28:54.000
So it was Charles McFall, who's a big personality at Dragon Con. So, you know, him and I go way back.

28:54.000 --> 28:59.000
So he invited me back and we talked about Pokemon Go for a couple hours to check that out.

28:59.000 --> 29:04.000
The most recent episode of the Pokemon Go podcast. If you're into that game, we had a lot of fun on there this week.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Do you remember the other announcement I have?

29:06.000 --> 29:12.000
Do you remember last summer when I was spending all my time playing that survivor?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Survivor LARP, I was calling it.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Yes.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Yes. And I won the Survivor LARP, right?

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Right.

29:18.000 --> 29:24.000
So I have agreed to do some behind the scenes work with the next season that's coming up.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
That's going to start, I think, early next month. Don't quote me on that.

29:27.000 --> 29:33.000
But it's going to be, you know, kind of a winner going into spring game. It is currently casting.

29:33.000 --> 29:39.000
So if you heard me talking about all that and doing like the challenges that are survival style in my house

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
and the people that I had to lie to their faces and screw over, it was a lot of fun.

29:43.000 --> 29:48.000
But, you know, it was all a game. And actually I legit met some amazing people through that whole experience.

29:48.000 --> 29:54.000
So and like people I am really looking forward to meeting in real life and stuff and just, yeah, some great people.

29:54.000 --> 30:00.000
So if you are if that sounds like your thing, I should note that applications are open for that.

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
And that whole community loves to see like new faces and new people get into it.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
So I figure this is a platform to maybe entice some new people into that.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
It is a bit of a time commitment. You have to be willing to do video chats with people

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
or you're going to get voted out first because you're not participating.

30:15.000 --> 30:20.000
But if, you know, that sounds like up your alley, I would say it's a time commitment similar to like

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
you're going to hardcore raid in an MMO for three weeks, maybe four weeks.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
You're going to hardcore raid in an MMO for a little bit.

30:27.000 --> 30:32.000
So if that sounds like something that's up your alley, check my Twitter feed at Mr Rob Roberts.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
Or you can find the Facebook group. It's called Power Org.

30:35.000 --> 30:40.000
That's O-R-G, Online Reality Games. So Power Org is the Facebook group.

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
And you're going to be looking for Power Season 10. That's the one that's coming up because I won nine.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
So, yeah, cool. Those are my announcements.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Cool.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
So let's get into some news. Kind of a shorter news week this week.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
So it may end up being a shorter show, but we've got a few things to talk about.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
So let's get into it. Loki.

30:57.000 --> 31:03.000
So this was an unfortunate turn of events for folks that have WWE 2K20.

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
So apparently playing the game shortly after the new year.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
Well, I should say attempting to play the game shortly after the new year.

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
Folks found that, well, we can't because it doesn't work.

31:16.000 --> 31:26.000
Because apparently there was some issue with some sort of timer in the game that the system date being 2020

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
fucked the game over and you couldn't play it at all. It just was broken.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
Thankfully, though, they did fix that rather quickly.

31:34.000 --> 31:39.000
It was corrected within the day, but still kind of an embarrassing thing,

31:39.000 --> 31:48.000
especially considering that WWE 2K20 has been kind of fucking terrible this last few months.

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
It's been out and buggy and glitchy and just all sorts of bad.

31:52.000 --> 31:58.000
So it just doesn't really add to the already shit pile that is that game.

31:58.000 --> 32:03.000
I've seen some interesting commentary on this because some people on social media are like,

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
LOL, the Y2K bug finally got something and it was this crappy game.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
And then there's been other people that are like,

32:09.000 --> 32:14.000
the reason why Y2K ended up not being a big deal is because everybody did,

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
like it would have been a serious deal, but everybody did a lot of prep and work

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
and made sure that it wasn't going to be a big deal.

32:21.000 --> 32:27.000
So it's interesting that this 2K20 bug, I guess, I don't know what else to call it,

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
ended up getting this game. It's just really interesting.

32:30.000 --> 32:36.000
But you've got to wonder what other old games may break at a certain point because of the clock.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
You know what I mean?

32:37.000 --> 32:42.000
And I'm talking about this from a retro preservation standpoint.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
I don't know.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Yeah, I don't either.

32:45.000 --> 32:49.000
Do you think people will be playing like 100 years from now and will come back and play some of the old games?

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
Oh yeah.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
Some of the old day games?

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Yes.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
You think so?

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
I guess people still read literature and some people will watch the old movies from that day.

32:56.000 --> 33:01.000
People still speed run games from these 8-bit and 16-bit systems.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
True.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
So I wouldn't see how that would be any different.

33:05.000 --> 33:11.000
Azet and Chat says Office Space was the premise of Y2K. It was serious business.

33:11.000 --> 33:17.000
Bobby Blackwell says 2038 will be a real bad year for old computer systems.

33:17.000 --> 33:24.000
I've heard that before, that it's 2038 and it's something to do with, I don't know if it's like the powers of two or something.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
Like that's how many bits were going in the year.

33:27.000 --> 33:33.000
I don't remember the exact thing, but that's something about that particular year is like when the clock runs out for some old systems.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
So that's, yeah.

33:35.000 --> 33:41.000
And then some folks are talking about some of the really, you know, I don't want to get too much into what's going on in the real world because I think video games escape from that.

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
Obviously a lot of people on social media are like making World War III jokes.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
I don't think it's particularly funny.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
I don't want to joke about that.

33:49.000 --> 34:05.000
But yeah, let's just hope some of that crazy stuff in the real world really settles down before, you know, so we don't have to talk about that that stuff isn't here for future generations because we, you know, blew it all sky high.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
So hopefully, hopefully somewhere, somewhere.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
And not like the song either.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Yeah, right. So thank you.

34:12.000 --> 34:18.000
Thank you. Bobby Buckle says in Unix, time is represented by a 32 bit integer start.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
OK, that's what it's like. The number of bits.

34:20.000 --> 34:31.000
And it's because the clock. OK, so from January 1st, 1970, the 32 bit integer hits its limit at 2038 because 32 bits would be like 64, something like that, 64 years.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
And that's that's when it runs out, basically.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
So, yeah, interesting.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
We'll see what happens.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
All right.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
So we got time. We got 18 years.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
That's true. We got time.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
Well, we have time to fix it. Get those old computers off that system.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
But yeah, as far as like preservation goes, I mean, you can't play games on an old system.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
The old system no longer works because the sure you can.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Because you know what?

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
We run the clock backwards.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Turn the clock back.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Can spin around the planet backwards.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
But that's what they were doing, though.

35:01.000 --> 35:06.000
The fix the 2K thing is like the temporary workaround was set your clock back.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
Oh, wow.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
And it works.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
You know, it's like you're connected online.

35:10.000 --> 35:17.000
I do remember that something about like change your internal clock on your computer to like nineteen hundred and it'll be fine.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
So weird. Anyway.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
All right.

35:20.000 --> 35:24.000
Metroid Prime 4. Who knows if that's a game we're going to see in 2020?

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
Hopefully.

35:25.000 --> 35:29.000
I'm not banking on it, but maybe it could be a holiday game.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
But there's some rumors going around and it's this lower news week.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
So I'll give the rumors a little air time.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
Why not?

35:36.000 --> 35:40.000
So Bandai Namco was working on some ideas and that got all scrapped.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
And this project started again.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Retro Studios is taking care of it.

35:45.000 --> 35:57.000
But word on the street is that Nintendo is speeding up the development or helping to speed up the development maybe to make this year happen by outsourcing environment work to another developer.

35:57.000 --> 36:03.000
And that was discovered by a job posting apparently that was out there for said developer.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
So interesting.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
Do you think that this could be detrimental to the game?

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
Because sometimes outsourcing doesn't work out so well.

36:12.000 --> 36:19.000
Like the original Final Fantasy 14 clearly had a lot of its environment outsourced.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
And you literally saw copy paste terrain.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
It was bad.

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
I think in a way you get what you pay for sort of thing.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
But it might also be a time.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
If they have the time to get it right, it might be fine.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
I think there's also that comment that this is very common in the gaming industry.

36:34.000 --> 36:40.000
So even though I'm pointing out a worst case scenario, there's a lot of scenarios you don't even know about that were outsourced with the environment.

36:40.000 --> 36:45.000
So do you think Nintendo is trying to push this game for this year?

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
Maybe cutting corners for lack of a better term.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
I hope not.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
Where they can.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
Because at least Nintendo has a certain stamp of quality at least with their games.

36:54.000 --> 37:00.000
I would hope that if they are trying to get the game out this year, just put more resources on it.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Not necessarily cut corners.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
I don't know.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
We'll have to see what the final product is.

37:06.000 --> 37:10.000
I also would hope that maybe for the holidays Splatoon 3 is going to be a thing.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
I could see that coming back.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
Do you think we're going to get a new Switch this year as well?

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
That Switch Pro that's always rumored?

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
I really don't care.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
The Switch Lite didn't seem to matter at all.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Some people love it.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
I know, my kids are stupid and they're like, you know.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Don't call your kids stupid.

37:26.000 --> 37:36.000
Okay, I'm sorry. One of my kids is stupid and they, not stupid, but like my one son, he's stupid in the sense that he gets swept up.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Consumerism.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
He gets swept up in the consumer hype.

37:39.000 --> 37:45.000
Like he is just full on, you know, just whatever you tell me to buy, I'm going to buy it.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
You know, this like type of thing, even though you have no money.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
It's like, he's like, I need a Switch Lite.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
I'm like, we have a Switch at home. What do you need a Switch Lite for?

37:53.000 --> 38:00.000
Because it's new? I'm like, no. Like you just, you have a Switch.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
That sounds like a financial responsible child in the making.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
That's going to be, that kid's going to end up in government.

38:06.000 --> 38:17.000
Well, it's just because like, I mean, I could see, I could see where like the advantage of having another Switch would be because they fight over that thing so much.

38:17.000 --> 38:25.000
The problem is though, is because my library is, most of it's digital and it's on the one Switch, I ain't buying that shit all over again.

38:25.000 --> 38:32.000
You know, like that's, that's going to be the problem right there is like, I can't, I don't want to purchase all of that stuff twice.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
So that doesn't work for me.

38:35.000 --> 38:43.000
All right. I think they might do like a little incremental upgrade, which is interesting because that's kind of what the new Xbox is supposed to be in a way.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
It's just not really incremental. It's like a big upgrade.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Yeah.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
To the Xbox system, but you know, we'll see.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
All right. As that says, tell him to get a job.

38:52.000 --> 38:58.000
Trying to get him just to pick up his toys and put his socks away and put, put socks on.

38:58.000 --> 39:03.000
I'm like, you're sick. You're almost six years old and you don't put your own socks on.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
I'm like, put your damn socks on.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
All right.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Let's put yourself to bed. You're almost 10.

39:09.000 --> 39:14.000
Let's move, let's move on to some more negative commentary, Loki.

39:15.000 --> 39:26.000
So apparently the director of Bayonetta is saying that, hey, you know, the switch menu could use some freshening up.

39:26.000 --> 39:36.000
Basically saying that there's, they don't like, one of the things that I guess is kind of annoying is that you can't see all of your games unless you go to all games.

39:37.000 --> 39:43.000
I mean, which it makes sense. It shows you like the most recently played games that you have on your system, which I'm kind of okay with,

39:43.000 --> 39:52.000
but like they feel, you know, Hideki Kayama, he basically wants folders on there.

39:52.000 --> 39:57.000
Kind of like how he had with like the 3DS and stuff where you can put some stuff in folders and like sort it that way.

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
I would agree that it would be much better if you could customize this a little more to your own liking.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
It would be all right.

40:02.000 --> 40:06.000
I mean, I still think it's not a huge deal because I would, you know what?

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
This is the one time I'm going to be a little more negative on Nintendo than you.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
This is new year, new year, new opinions.

40:11.000 --> 40:19.000
I kind of agree that the interface on the switch is a little crap and maybe it's because I play more on a TV.

40:19.000 --> 40:24.000
And I think the interface that it has lends itself a little better to handheld.

40:24.000 --> 40:28.000
Maybe because those icons when you're in handheld may get a little too small.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
If you try doing too much on that screen, I will.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
I feel like there's just not enough going.

40:32.000 --> 40:40.000
I will contend that I don't think that they should have icons dedicated to disk or cartridge based games

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
because they do have that like on like the PlayStation stuff.

40:43.000 --> 40:50.000
They'll have like an icon there for because it's similar to the PlayStation kind of set of how you have, you know, your icons.

40:50.000 --> 40:56.000
But that icon changes the first one for whatever disk you have in the system or in this case, a cartridge you have in the system.

40:56.000 --> 41:04.000
But with the switch, if I keep switching cartridges, I'm going to have icons for each one of those as it puts a little bit of insulation data in there.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
And it keeps listing all of that there.

41:07.000 --> 41:12.000
It really should just be whatever you played last in there and leave all your digital titles behind it.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
And that would show a little bit more on the screen.

41:14.000 --> 41:18.000
But I mean, it's just it's minimal viable.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
I mean, really, that's kind of what it is.

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
And to be fair, there's a lot of similarities between the switch and the PlayStation four.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
So it might be a little unfair that I'm not criticizing the PlayStation four.

41:27.000 --> 41:34.000
But I feel like the PlayStation four does a little more would like the crossbar functionality where it's like when you're in a game, you can go up, you can go down.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
And there's like there's more things to look at in there.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
And you have the customizability of folders.

41:39.000 --> 41:43.000
For example, on my PlayStation four, I have a Jackbox Party Pack folder.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
And that's where I play. I forgot you do folders.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
That's where I put all of my Jackbox games are in there.

41:48.000 --> 41:57.000
So but even the PlayStation, I really wouldn't mind if they would allow you to maybe like go down into multiple bars or something like I wish you kind of fit a little more.

41:57.000 --> 42:01.000
But I guess sometimes the minimalism thing, I guess, is a design choice. I don't know.

42:01.000 --> 42:05.000
But even on PlayStation, again, like on Switch, you can see what maybe four games at a time on the main screen.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
No, it's like it's like it like eight or if you scroll.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
I mean, like on the screen, on the screen.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Well, here, here's a screenshot.

42:13.000 --> 42:20.000
So like four. Yeah, you see a few more on on PlayStation.

42:20.000 --> 42:25.000
So, well, on PlayStation, yeah, I don't remember what it is, but it is more like seven or eight.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Yeah. Yeah. So anyway.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
So I don't know. I kind of think you might have a point.

42:29.000 --> 42:34.000
Like, I think Nintendo should maybe take a look at redoing that UI a little bit or, you know, just enhancing it a little bit.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.000
Just a little a few enhancements. I think you go a long way with that thing.

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
Some of this customizability. Yeah. Let us default to all games mode.

42:42.000 --> 42:47.000
Let us, you know, have the idea of cartridges on this line. Digitals on this line.

42:47.000 --> 42:52.000
I love that. Or smaller game icons. You have it where you can do like the 3DS was where.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Yeah, the 3DS was great, honestly.

42:54.000 --> 43:00.000
Have large icons and then like I want smaller icons, but I'll have twice as many on there and there'll be two rows or something like that.

43:00.000 --> 43:04.000
Tiger Claw and Chat is a new Switch owner and says, on my Switch, I have two games that I bought.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
One was digitally and the other is a physical copy.

43:07.000 --> 43:11.000
Wait until you have like 40 games and 15 of them are, you know, digital or maybe even more.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
25 of them are digital. Yeah.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Then again, that's when that's when the management gets a little crazy.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
It's fine when you only have so many games.

43:17.000 --> 43:22.000
But wait, I mean, because then you go into the all game and you're like, oh, I forgot I had these games.

43:22.000 --> 43:28.000
Well, then you get like the Nintendo, the NES channel, then you get the Super NES one channel.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
We get all that stuff.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
I like the channels thing.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Yeah, exactly. Now, the thing is, like, wait a second.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
They had a better air face than it was.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
The problem with the Wii interface is it was fucking clunky.

43:41.000 --> 43:46.000
That was it was very clunky and especially the Wii U was really clunky.

43:46.000 --> 43:53.000
But like the fact that it had like the forecast channel, it would actually show on the little screen the current temperature in your area and so forth.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Like it showed you the little micro data right there.

43:55.000 --> 44:00.000
That was very, in a way, almost ahead of its time to like where smartphones kind of ended up.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Or even smart TVs now.

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
Like TVs are doing that now where they're showing like here's what the weather is right now.

44:06.000 --> 44:13.000
So I kind of I kind of wish Nintendo would take some cues from that Wii design if they could just kind of make that but maybe snappier.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
I think that might be pretty cool.

44:14.000 --> 44:22.000
And you could have folders on the Wii thing, too, because I used to have all my virtual console things were in a folder that you could open it.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Or was it the maybe I'm mistaken.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
Maybe it was a memory card.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
You'd click the memory card and then that would show you another page of things.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
So, no, you can do pages.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
It's been a while. The Wii was out.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
You can scroll to the right or left or whatever and go pages.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
And you can do like quite a few.

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
As Joe under Matt in chat says, yeah, it really feels like it's been devolving since the Wii interface.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
So I think it's just time to revisit some of that stuff.

44:44.000 --> 44:51.000
I think the Wii had some good ideas, like the whole sending notes to other people's consoles that it would light up blue.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Like, in theory, that was a great idea.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
It just was horrifically.

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
Because because back then it was like, you know, hey, you can send e-mails to people.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
Isn't that cool? But remember, it's like smartphones now.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Now we have smartphones and we don't need.

45:04.000 --> 45:09.000
I know. But remember when it would be like you you walk in your living room one day and you're like, wait, the Wii's glowing blue.

45:09.000 --> 45:15.000
What's going on? You go, oh, somebody sent me a message or or oh, it's an ad or whatever it is that's popping up.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
So I think that would be kind of neat. It's a new channel.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
Yeah. It's time to go back into everybody votes.

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
What were the other big dumb channels they put out on there for free?

45:25.000 --> 45:29.000
There's everybody votes. And then there was there was others.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
There's a news channel.

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
Do they still have Miis and stuff in the Switch? I can't remember if they have the Miis creation stuff.

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
Yeah, they do, because you create it for your little player icon.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
Yeah, that's right.

45:39.000 --> 45:43.000
Or you choose one of the stock pictures.

45:43.000 --> 45:47.000
Let's see. Fifth Dream Today says, I miss lights on Nintendo handhelds.

45:47.000 --> 45:51.000
Act F says, I like the Switch's UI simplicity, but it could use some reworking and reorganizing.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
So there you go. All right.

45:53.000 --> 46:00.000
Well, moving on, let's talk a little more about Nintendo and apparently on some comments from global president Shuntaro Furukawa,

46:00.000 --> 46:04.000
who says cloud gaming might not be a thing as soon.

46:04.000 --> 46:08.000
But I mean, is this any shock to hear that Nintendo might be behind the curve a little bit on this stuff?

46:08.000 --> 46:16.000
I don't know. You be the judge, because Reggie Fils-May, even before when he was involved with Nintendo and he was the North American president,

46:16.000 --> 46:20.000
he said cloud gaming could be a thing that it dominates later on.

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
But apparently Shuntaro Furukawa sees differently.

46:24.000 --> 46:33.000
He did an interview with the Japanese publication Nikkei and said it's possible that cloud gaming could capture the public's interest in 10 years from now.

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
However, at this point in time, I do not think the dedicated hardware will go away.

46:37.000 --> 46:40.000
It's a long way off before we'll really know the outcome.

46:40.000 --> 46:46.000
With that said, it would be pointless to solely focus on methods of play that can only be had on dedicated hardware.

46:46.000 --> 46:51.000
Once your audience starts saying they can play on other consoles or smartphones instead, you're finished.

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
But, you know, that doesn't mean they're shutting out other concepts completely.

46:55.000 --> 47:00.000
Something I do not want the public to misunderstand is that we are not turning our backs on new technologies.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
We are constantly researching and developing.

47:02.000 --> 47:09.000
Our hardware development teams evaluate all kinds of new technologies available thus far and consult with our software developers.

47:09.000 --> 47:13.000
If they determine the technology can be used with the game, then they will utilize it.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
We will not be changing this fundamental approach moving forward.

47:16.000 --> 47:22.000
As for AR, augmented reality, it is definitely one of the many aspects we are interested in.

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
We are currently researching what interesting ways we can utilize it.

47:26.000 --> 47:37.000
Not terribly surprising that Nintendo has a particular interest in AR when you consider how hard Niantic's gone on that with Pokemon Go, which of course is a Nintendo property.

47:37.000 --> 47:45.000
I would be interested to see what Nintendo does with AR because they've kind of dabbled before with even like way back to the DS.

47:45.000 --> 47:52.000
No, not the DS. It was the 3DS. They dabbled with it with the 3DS.

47:52.000 --> 47:58.000
Yeah, I remember that. Like the little AR Rangers and the cards that you had and you could take the camera with a picture of yourself.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
Yeah, I remember that.

47:59.000 --> 48:06.000
So they've dabbled with it. I mean, they're kind of always ahead of the curve, but at the same time it's almost too early to do what they want to do.

48:06.000 --> 48:11.000
And they're just kind of like, well, we can't go back to that. So we're just going to forget about it.

48:11.000 --> 48:15.000
And then later on they'll attempt something that's also kind of too ahead of its time.

48:15.000 --> 48:21.000
And ironically, I don't know about you, but I don't necessarily disagree with what he's saying about cloud gaming.

48:21.000 --> 48:27.000
Because what he's saying is what kind of a lot of us are saying about Stadia right now is that it's too early for something like this.

48:27.000 --> 48:33.000
And, you know, he might not be talking about bandwidth caps and some things we're talking about, but he's kind of reading the tea leaves the same way a lot of us are.

48:33.000 --> 48:41.000
And kind of he's also referring to some of the stuff that they've had for cloud gaming on their console already with, you know, the Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

48:41.000 --> 48:48.000
And was it Resident Evil, one of those games that they had on there as well, that was kind of a cloud based game.

48:48.000 --> 48:55.000
And one of those, the sales on the Switch haven't been as great as they'd hoped, although it's really a third party game.

48:55.000 --> 49:01.000
That's a very good point about those kind of cloud carts, which do we have any of them here? Weren't they only in Japan?

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
They're only in Japan.

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
So, and then again, we talk about infrastructure, perhaps it's a little better over there.

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
Maybe Google Stadia stands to do very well in Japan.

49:09.000 --> 49:14.000
By the way, if you are a Stadia person, don't forget there's new games in the store now for pro people.

49:14.000 --> 49:19.000
Because you can grab Rise of the Tomb Raider is one and the other one, Thumper is the other.

49:19.000 --> 49:25.000
Which I'm curious, I got to play that on Stadia because I'm, I mean, putting out a music based game.

49:25.000 --> 49:30.000
I will say, even though Thumper might be a cheaper title in some regards, I think it's still a good game.

49:30.000 --> 49:36.000
And I think it's pretty gutsy to put out a music based game on your cloud gaming.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
Well, hopefully it works well.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
That's what I'm curious about.

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
So, so I'll be curious to see what goes on with that.

49:42.000 --> 49:46.000
But back to Nintendo.

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
Yeah, I don't know.

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
Like, I think that it makes sense.

49:51.000 --> 49:55.000
You know, we always rag on them for like kind of being behind the curve when it comes to network stuff.

49:55.000 --> 50:00.000
So like, I could see them not wanting to jump into, you know, streaming.

50:00.000 --> 50:03.000
Though, to be honest, so they could do that.

50:03.000 --> 50:08.000
Well, they kind of already do that with the Nintendo games that they have on there.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
Although I'm not really sure if that's streaming or if you're just downloading everything.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
I mean, how would you know?

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Because it's such a small file size.

50:15.000 --> 50:23.000
But like, they could stream, easily stream like a whole NES game to your console.

50:23.000 --> 50:28.000
I mean, hell, they were doing that with the Game Boy Advance and linking that with the GameCube and stuff.

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
You could stream the whole thing to a Game Boy Advance and store it in memory.

50:32.000 --> 50:39.000
So I think there's some serious missed opportunities with the amount of library that they have with all the NES games.

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
Especially like what was on the Wii and stuff.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Like, all those games you could buy.

50:44.000 --> 50:50.000
Like, nowadays, just put that full library out there and just put rotating discounts on different things.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
And like, you just sell so much.

50:52.000 --> 50:59.000
Because people right now, especially like me, have a tendency to like, hoard games.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
It's like, oh, that's a great deal.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
I'm gonna pick that up and then you just never play it.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
And it just sits in your backlog.

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
But it's cool because you have all these games and you're like, oh yeah, I'll go back to that someday.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
But I think they could make some serious money doing that.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
Even like with third parties.

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
I understand a lot of these companies are putting out these collections and stuff with their older games.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Because that's kind of how they're getting around this.

51:18.000 --> 51:26.000
But I really think Nintendo should kind of regroup and say, hey, you know, let's do what we did before.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Because I think that would be a really good thing.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
Because I don't know.

51:29.000 --> 51:37.000
Have with this new version of the emulators that they have where it supports two player multiplayer.

51:37.000 --> 51:42.000
Have you played with anybody multiplayer in any of these NES or Super NES games?

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
Nope.

51:43.000 --> 51:47.000
So I think that's a feature that everyone's like, oh yeah, I'm looking for that.

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
To be fair, it was something we were begging for with the Wii.

51:51.000 --> 51:57.000
But I think it's also one of those things where the games, I feel like there's still stuff missing that I would want to play.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
But I don't know.

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
Yeah, I just...

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Maybe we're just past that point. I don't know.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
I just think it's a real missed opportunity.

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
Especially with those mini consoles, man.

52:06.000 --> 52:11.000
If you had a storefront built into those where you can keep downloading more titles and keep adding to it.

52:11.000 --> 52:15.000
I'm telling you, they would have had some serious money on their hands.

52:15.000 --> 52:20.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I still remember how everyone bitched about virtual console because you had to buy each game individually.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Why don't they just make it a subscription service instead?

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
I think overall I do like the subscription.

52:24.000 --> 52:28.000
But then we saw what the subscription service was and how few games there were.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
And it's like, okay, I'll take the old one.

52:29.000 --> 52:37.000
It feels like, you know, it's not quite as robust as the former service with all the games that were available there.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
But I guess they have to test them all.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
There should be a happy medium.

52:40.000 --> 52:46.000
There should be a happy medium. I think the problem we had with the virtual consoles, I felt that they were charging too much for those games.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
And I get it, like some of those games.

52:48.000 --> 52:55.000
Like $8 a game for a Super Nintendo title. No matter what it was.

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
Maybe you can get away with charging that for Zelda and Mario and the must haves.

52:58.000 --> 53:04.000
But charging $8 for a third party title that wasn't a big deal.

53:04.000 --> 53:10.000
Nowadays you have stuff on the Switch like indie games and stuff that are $9.99 that are a nice full fledged game or whatever.

53:10.000 --> 53:16.000
Or like say I'm paying $20 for a really solid indie, like, Untitled Goose game.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
You know, a really solid game.

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
I just feel that it's not the same value.

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
I get it that Nintendo games are pretty good and stuff.

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
But at the same time those games are really old.

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
And it should mark them down a bit.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
But you can still sell a ton of it.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
And you're still making pure profit on that stuff.

53:35.000 --> 53:41.000
Because honestly it's the same ROM files that have existed for decades now.

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
And that you're just running through some emulator software that you created.

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
Yes, I understand that there's development time for those emulators.

53:47.000 --> 53:54.000
But let's be honest, I'm sure a lot of that stuff is probably also borrowed from other emulators that are out there already.

53:55.000 --> 54:01.000
So, I mean, I can't imagine that the development time in there wouldn't be immediately recouped by the sales of these games.

54:01.000 --> 54:07.000
I think it's probably already paid for itself dozens of times over already.

54:07.000 --> 54:10.000
Let me go back to the cloud gaming thing for one other thing I wanted to bring up.

54:10.000 --> 54:15.000
And that was that Nintendo tends to be very dominant in the handheld space.

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
You know, maybe not necessarily compared to smartphones.

54:18.000 --> 54:22.000
But when it comes to dedicated gaming devices, they have outlived the N-Gage.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
If you want to... I mean, that was kind of...

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
Okay, but certainly Sony's foray into that is what I'm really getting at.

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
With the PSP and the Vita, Nintendo's kind of outlived that.

54:30.000 --> 54:35.000
Could it be that even if Nintendo were to miss the boat on cloud gaming right away,

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
they would still have the lockdown on handheld gaming?

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000
Because the reality is, as much as we talk about 5G and all this stuff,

54:41.000 --> 54:46.000
the portability will not be there before the living room, right?

54:46.000 --> 54:50.000
Cloud in your living room is going to happen before cloud on portability.

54:50.000 --> 54:54.000
And so, maybe it makes sense that Nintendo holds out a little longer

54:54.000 --> 54:57.000
because the handheld thing is so important to them.

54:57.000 --> 55:00.000
And you got to wonder if every system they do from now on

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
is just going to be some version of the Switch.

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
I kind of feel like that's where Nintendo's at now.

55:05.000 --> 55:09.000
Like, every Nintendo device from now on is going to be some sort of TV here,

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
pick it up on the go there, is my thought.

55:11.000 --> 55:15.000
I think we're done with one or the other dedicated Nintendo device

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
because Nintendo still wants to run with the handheld stuff.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
I think they'll go wherever the industry goes, honestly.

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
If they can get away with doing small devices that are powerful,

55:23.000 --> 55:28.000
which I could see them doing because hardware's just getting better

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
and eventually it'll shrink down in size.

55:30.000 --> 55:36.000
And it just eventually gets small enough to where you can put it in a handheld form factor.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
But it depends on where they want to go.

55:38.000 --> 55:43.000
And it seems like this is where they want to go is the smaller portable devices

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
because that's what's popular now.

55:44.000 --> 55:48.000
But if something else becomes more popular like AR or something like that,

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
I mean, that's still going to be probably portable, but we'll see.

55:51.000 --> 55:56.000
I'm sure they'll adapt with whatever the industry's trending towards.

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
I just want to point out an observation here before we go to our next story,

55:59.000 --> 56:03.000
and that is that you guys know that Mr. Smoosh is usually very loud during the show

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
and he's screaming and all this stuff, and he was doing that a little bit ago.

56:06.000 --> 56:10.000
He has parked himself on top of Jamie's chair.

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
So the recliner that Jamie usually sits on,

56:13.000 --> 56:18.000
he climbed to the top, he's parked up there, and he's staring at the – we have a studio light.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
It's like one of those lights that's on an umbrella type of thing.

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
And he's just staring at it and just very peaceful.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
That's where he's sitting.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
And he's – notice how he has shut the hell up tonight.

56:27.000 --> 56:33.000
It kind of makes you wonder if is that all he just wants every night is just to be up on top of Jamie's chair?

56:33.000 --> 56:37.000
I'm going to tell her next time she's here.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Ping him up and let him get on the back of the chair, see if he'll shut up,

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
but it probably would rock too much.

56:41.000 --> 56:44.000
When Jamie's in it, she's going to lean forward and take a sip of water or something.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
It's going to rocket too much for her.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
I don't know. It's just funny.

56:47.000 --> 56:50.000
He knows she's gone. He misses her.

56:50.000 --> 56:53.000
Possibly. I don't know.

56:53.000 --> 56:58.000
Jamie was actually here in the studio last night for unrelated to OLR reasons,

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
and so Smoosh did get to see her.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
It was actually funny.

57:02.000 --> 57:07.000
So yesterday – going off topic for a bit, but our news is light this week so we can do that.

57:08.000 --> 57:13.000
Yesterday was Alan and I's 10-year anniversary of dating, right?

57:13.000 --> 57:16.000
So even though our wedding anniversary is in a couple weeks,

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
which is why we have no show, by the way, on January 19th,

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
literally nobody's here on January 19th.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
Yeah, I'll be.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
He just told me today, I won't be here January 19th.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
I'm like, neither will anyone else.

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
So Dark Soccer has got a thing with the sisters in San Francisco.

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
Alan and I are going for our wedding anniversary to see –

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
We're going to the broccoli farm.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
You guys are going to the broccoli farm?

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
Yeah, we're going to the broccoli farm again.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
I thought – that's what I asked.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
I saw you guys going to the broccoli farm again.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.000
Yeah.

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
Oh, that's good.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
Well, that'll be fun.

57:41.000 --> 57:45.000
Which, if you're new to OLR, the broccoli farm is what Loki told the kids.

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
It was this great meme for a while on the show.

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
He told the kids they were going to the broccoli farm.

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
It was really Disneyland, so they went down to LA.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
And they figured it out before you got there, right?

57:56.000 --> 58:00.000
No, they did not figure it out, which they should have

58:00.000 --> 58:04.000
because they were literally signs that said Disneyland and stuff like that.

58:04.000 --> 58:09.000
But we finally told them after a while where we were going.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
But they kind of thought they were going somewhere else.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
I think they thought Legoland or something like that.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
No.

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
Okay.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
No, I was like, no.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Or Universal Studios.

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
So anyway, the point of my story.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
So we all have different things going on in the 19th.

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
It's just a busy weekend.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
I think that's also Martin Luther King Jr. Day, if I remember right.

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
Is that coming Monday?

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
Yes.

58:27.000 --> 58:30.000
So I think it's just, you know, with the longer weekend,

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
it's going to be a little crazy for a lot of people.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
So we won't be here.

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
We won't be here that night.

58:34.000 --> 58:35.000
We won't.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
But that is our anniversary.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
So yesterday was our dating anniversary.

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
So we went out.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
We decided to go to Benihana last night.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
Oh, awesome.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Because, you know, there's only one thing I love more than Alan,

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
and that's that fried rice.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.000
Yep.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
Extra butter.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
You got to give it the extra garlic butter.

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
The other folks at our table were like, can you do extra butter?

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
And he was like, are you guys okay with that?

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
You guys were like, hell yeah, we are.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Yeah.

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
So, yeah.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.000
So we did that.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
And but the reason why I bring that up.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
This comes back to Mr. Smoosh seeing Jamie.

59:04.000 --> 59:08.000
Apparently Jamie was in the neighborhood yesterday and she dropped by because she wanted to drop

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
some stuff out by the house.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.000
And she texted me.

59:10.000 --> 59:11.000
She's like, hey, are you at home?

59:11.000 --> 59:14.000
I was in the neighborhood and I'm looking at Smoosh through the window.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
And he can see me.

59:16.000 --> 59:19.000
And I was like, no, hon, we went out for our.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
But she came by later after we were home from dinner.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
She has another friend that lives in the neighborhood.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
So she was here seeing that person.

59:24.000 --> 59:27.000
So it's not like she made a trip out here for nothing.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
But yes, so she got to see Mr. Smoosh yesterday.

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
So I don't think Mr. Smoosh misses her too much.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.000
So anyway.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
All right.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Pixel pockets is happy anniversary to you, too.

59:37.000 --> 59:38.000
Thank you.

59:38.000 --> 59:43.000
I think our real celebration is going to be the cruise that we're going on in March, because

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
remember, we're going on that Star Trek cruise.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
Oh, yeah.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
Crap.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
I have to figure out what we're doing with the show because I'm going to be gone for

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
two weeks.

59:50.000 --> 59:54.000
So to be determined, I don't know what's happening with our yet.

59:54.000 --> 59:57.000
We haven't figured that out.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
I think we'll probably record in advance the first week and then just not have a show the

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
second week.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I think it's the only way we can really get around that.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
So very excited about that.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
All right.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Anyway, back into some more news.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Speaking of obsessive fan creations, Loki, you have something for us, right?

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Yes.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:20.000
So there was a fan made Mother Four game that they had started working on.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
I guess it stopped.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000
They started it, I guess, winter of 2014.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000
It was going to be like an if not an official, but like a fan mother for.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
But then, of course, you know, with the whole season, this is type things.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000
It stopped being a fan mother for game in twenty seventeen.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000
And they finally announced their new title for the game called Oddity.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
And definitely look, we've got some video.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Yes.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
And it definitely has.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
It looks a lot like mother and it looks awesome.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.000
The earthbound inspiration is very clear, but it's different.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
And especially just that that art style with the.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
I love it.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
I think I don't like I'm not a huge fan of like Earthbound.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000
I could be honest, I've never played any Earthbound games.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
You really should.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
But it looks absolutely awesome.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Like I really would be looking forward to checking this game out.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.000
But so, yeah, it's spun off into its own thing, which I am all for.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
You know, yeah.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
And it kind of looks like they've added more like cut scenes in that style.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
But, you know, Nintendo has really been kind of sleeping on this franchise for whatever reason.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
I guess maybe it just didn't sell their expectations or whatever.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:39.000
So I love that somebody else is coming in and making a game, but it's going to be different enough where now this game could be sold on Steam.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
It can be sold on the e-shop.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Nintendo e-shop maybe if Nintendo will take it.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
I don't know.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000
I think they would.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
That little police thing was part of the trailer, by the way.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
That's not something weird.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000
I think that might be a tongue-in-cheek joke about Nintendo shutting them down.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I'm not sure.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
But, yeah, the way they're like walking around the world and stuff, it looks like a frickin' motherfucker.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
It really does.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
It does.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Yeah, so I think it looks really awesome.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000
So, of course, it's still being developed.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:11.000
They haven't released a, well, in the trailer they actually say it'll be done when it's done.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
When it's ready.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Which is completely fair.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Completely fair.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Maybe.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Maybe we'll see it this year.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Maybe next year.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000
But, I mean, definitely a game that's on my radar now and looks pretty awesome.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
So, pretty cool.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:33.000
And, honestly, like I think, like I know it's fun to make a fan game, you know, sequel to like a Nintendo franchise or anybody's franchise like that.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:41.000
But, like, sometimes maybe just a spiritual successor or something like that that's not, you know, called Earthbound or something like that.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Or you're not called Mario or whatever.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Might be good enough.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Bobby Blackwolf points out, to be fair, Undertale was an Earthbound fan game too.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Look where that ended up.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
True.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
That's pretty amazing.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
That game ended up being very different from Earthbound though.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Like, I wouldn't play a game like that and think, oh, this is very Earthbound inspired.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Maybe a little bit I might go, oh, I see Earthbound and I see, you know, other classic 80s, you know, RPGs in here.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:12.000
But with that one, the oddity, I'm like, oh, that's very clearly Earthbound inspired but different enough to not be a ripoff.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Yeah. But, you know, maybe if something like that does really well, you know, like Undertale well, maybe that'll give Nintendo the kick in the pants.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Like, hey, maybe you should, maybe you should listen to all the people screaming at you for Mother 3.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.000
I love the idea of oddity coming out on the Nintendo eShop. Why the fuck not? It's different enough, right?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Don't we have games that look like, I'm trying to think of games that look like something else on the Nintendo eShop now.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Like those retro games that kind of look like old, like Zelda, Zelda, right?

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Don't we have like old retro games that look like Zelda like on the eShop?

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000
I'm pretty sure there's something. There's a lot of like, there's a lot of shovelware on eShop.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Bobby Blackwell says Binding of Isaac looks like old Zelda. Thank you. I knew there was like something.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Yeah. So, you know, but there's more than just that too.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
So, yeah, there's lots of games that are inspired by other things.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
And I mean, that's kind of a trend nowadays is a lot of these retro inspired games.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000
But as long as the Giana Sisters reboot was on Wii U, great one.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Because that was, for those that know their gaming history, Giana Sisters and it was on the Commodore 64 was too much like Mario and got sued.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:23.000
And it was a really, and if you go look at old footage of Giana Sisters, you kind of go, oh yeah, it does, it does look a lot like Mario.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:30.000
So, I mean, yeah, I'm all for them releasing that. At least this way they won't get cease and desist.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:36.000
All right. Well, moving on to talk about The Witcher. So, this show is doing very well. Have you watched The Witcher show yet?

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Have not.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I watched the first 15 minutes before I got a text message that said, hey, come play Final Fantasy 14, we need somebody to do a dungeon.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
And so I ended up turning it off. I didn't get very far, but I need to sit down and watch it again.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:54.000
But yeah, apparently a lot of people are getting into the Netflix series, even though the critics tore it apart.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Apparently it's doing very well with ratings because Netflix never really talks about ratings,

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
but they did talk about like their most streamed shows of the year.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.000
And like The Witcher was, now they factored in projected data.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:12.000
So, like it wasn't like in a month The Witcher topped Stranger or topped everything else besides like Stranger Things.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000
But The Witcher is like one of the top streamed things on Netflix. So, it's doing very well.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
And because of that, we're seeing this very interesting effect.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
I don't think we usually see when video game properties become movies, right?

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
It's because usually the game is really popular.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Now we're seeing people that are, you know, tossing their coin to Witcher 3 on the Steam library, O'Valley of Plenty Games.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000
O'Valley of Plenty Games. So, apparently that's what's happening on Steam right now,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000
is that The Witcher 3 is more popular than it's ever been, ever, even since the original release.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:51.000
This has revealed that the studio community lead actually mentioned this on Twitter.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.000
The PC version of The Witcher 3 broke its record for the most number of concurrent players.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
94,000 people playing on December 29th.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000
The game was 8th in Steam's top 10 games by player count.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:10.000
So, it's like all these people are seeing the show and now they want to go check out the game as a result of the show.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Even though the show is based on the books, but the games are also based on the books.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
So, there's some crossover there.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Like, you know, the bard that is a meme right now was in the games.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Maybe it might make the games easier to understand.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Like, I could tell you if there was maybe a Kingdom Hearts TV show that I could understand the story of Kingdom Hearts.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
I might be more inclined to play Kingdom Hearts.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Even though I should.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Well, what should really excite you, in my opinion.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000
You know, even though some critics toured The Witcher apart, and I hear other people that are like,

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:51.000
I think it's great. I have co-workers that are like, yeah, it's filling a void that Games of Thrones left.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.000
And I feel like that's part of the reason why the show is doing so popular because there's no Game of Thrones anymore.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000
And even though HBO is supposedly working on other stuff, there's like nothing to fill that void.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.000
And I think The Witcher is filling that for a lot of people.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Even if some people don't think it's, you know, the critics don't clearly think it's as good, but it doesn't matter what they think.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000
If the fans are there to support it, you know, they're going to.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:20.000
In a way that critics don't always praise every superhero movie that comes out, but audiences typically do.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Depends, of course, what movie we're talking about here.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000
But in Marvel's case, you know, Marvel always does very well at the box office.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Well, I've got good news for Bobby Blackwell.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Okay.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Is that, you know, if you are a fan of TV shows and then going and playing the games based on those TV shows as well,

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:41.000
you'll be happy to know that Ni No Kuni, the movie, comes out on January 16th on Netflix.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Very good. Very good, yes.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
And that's a demo you can pass.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:52.000
And Dragon Quest has something coming too, like a movie or something that's coming to Netflix.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000
But what should be very exciting, and this is the point I was trying to make a minute ago, with The Witcher.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:02.000
So the studio that did The Witcher also did The Expanse, which has done very well.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:07.000
And they had announced, and we talked about this on the show, but at the time we were kind of like,

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Oh, this Witcher show's probably not going to be a big deal. Oops.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
I remember seeing that.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
But, well, I think at the time we kind of lost over.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:21.000
But the other project they're working on, folks, is the adaptation of Final Fantasy XIV.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Now, we don't know if that's for Netflix.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I don't know how that's going to work.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I'm fucking jazzed about it. Are you kidding?

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Now that I've, you know, even with what little bit I've seen of The Witcher and how well it's been received

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.000
and knowing that The Expanse is pretty well received too, I am psyched that they're doing Final Fantasy XIV.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:42.000
And I don't know what part, I don't know if they're going to do a story that is separate from what's happening in the games,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
because I could definitely see that.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:50.000
And for those that are about to talk about Dad of Light on Netflix, that is a completely different thing

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
where Final Fantasy XIV was a plot device.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
That is not, like, we're talking about something set in that world.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000
So I don't know if this is going to be a separate thing that's going on concurrently with the game,

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
or if it's going to try to cover the story of the games.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I don't know, but it could be very, very interesting.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
So, yeah.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Bobby Blackwell says, The Witcher, Expanse crossover confirmed.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Witcher in space, Geralt in space.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Toss a coin to your Witcher, oh asteroid of plenty.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Wasn't, I do believe, and I want to say, like, I saw something about Cyberpunk.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000
I believe that there is some Witcher Cyberpunk crossover stuff that happened.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Really?

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Like, I want to say, like, they had, like, a character from The Witcher in Cyberpunk or something like that.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
The female characters, I don't remember, I remember seeing our work.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000
I don't know if it's, like, it's probably, it's obviously not the same character,

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:44.000
because completely different timelines and universes, but, I don't know, maybe.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000
All right, a few more news stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week,

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
and then we're going to go right from there into our listener roundtable,

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
and also tackle some of the emails we've got this week.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000
So, yeah, it's, we only have half the size show roll we usually do,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
just because of the holiday week still being here.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
But, for now, we have a couple more stories. Loki?

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000
So, Game Pass, of course, getting lots of new games all the time,

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:13.000
and one of my favorite games, Grand Theft Auto V, is now part of that wonderful package.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:20.000
So, it's, I believe, I'm not sure if it's playable on console, if you have,

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:25.000
I don't believe they have the PC version playable as part of Game Pass,

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
but I know it is on the console version, so,

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000
worth checking out if you haven't checked it out yet, because,

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
why wouldn't you have checked it out yet? It's Grand Theft Auto V, it's awesome.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I'm looking right at you.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Well, it's now on Game Pass, so it's going to be very hard to ignore it,

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000
but do you think they're putting it out just so they can make money on the online component?

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Oh, God, yes.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Yeah, I'm sure that's what it is.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Of course, yeah, the price of the game has been, like, really low for a long time.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Bobby does want to remind us it's console only.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
That's what I said, it's console only.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Yeah, so not the PC version, at least not yet.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Yeah, I don't think that they're doing the PC part of that, but it's been so cheap.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
I mean, honestly, if you're going to get it on PC, you could.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
PC version's good because of all the mods you can do to it,

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000
but yeah, I mean, console version's pretty awesome.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
It's worth checking out, Grand Theft Auto Online.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:20.000
I found it to be a little heavy-handed with the monetization, but it was all right.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
All right.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Well, moving on to some more news this week,

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:31.000
and this is sad news, but Sid Mead has passed away this week at the age of 86.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
What did Sid Mead have to do with video games?

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Not a lot directly.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000
There were some games, he was kind of like the Cyber Race games,

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
but not a lot of games you've probably heard of,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:47.000
but when it came to movies, he was somebody that worked on movies like Blade Runner and Tron.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
He was a concept artist.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000
So, like, the world of Tron and what that looked like,

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
a lot of that was from the mind of Sid Mead.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
And so, if you look at Blade Runner was another big one.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000
He also did When Star Trek came to the movies, did that, Alien.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000
So, like, a lot of these movies that really shaped sci-fi,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000
a lot of that was Sid Mead's vision.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000
And that did come into play with video games later on

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
because, seriously, take a look at his concept art

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000
and put it side by side with what a game like Mass Effect looks like,

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
and you're going to see the similarities there.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000
So, even if Sid Mead maybe didn't have a huge impact on video games directly,

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000
he still had a huge impact on video games conceptually and artistically.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
So, we take a moment to recognize his contributions

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:37.000
and, unfortunately, talk about that he has passed away this week at the age of 86.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
But that's a pretty good age.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
So, rest in peace.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Anyhow, let's move on.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Some folks in chat, Questbuster says Sid Mead designed the aliens in Wing Commander 5.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.000
He also consulted on the Blade Runner point-and-click game from Westwood Studios.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
He had some games of his own, but those didn't do too well.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Loved his imagination.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.000
He did have some gaming contributions, but I think his movie contributions

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000
and then how that influenced what happens with games was probably a lot bigger.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
So, probably what a lot more people are going to know him for.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
All right. Well, let's talk about some classic games.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
We're going to take a trip down memory lane and jump into the gaming vault

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
and find a classic game of the week.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Usually Dark Sakura would step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000
hey, you guys should be checking this game out this week,

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
but I'm going to fill in this week just because I didn't have a lot of notice,

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
so I just was like, I didn't have time to interview anybody.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
So, I was like, all right, I'll jump in and pick a game.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
And it's kind of hard to find a game.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
We've been doing this segment a long time.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000
This is episode 805.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
We've been doing this segment since episode 250.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.000
That's nearly 600 classic games.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
I think we've only accidentally repeated like two or three times,

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
and they were accidents all those times.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000
So, or maybe like a soundtrack for you.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000
But, you know, you guys know what I mean.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000
We've done very, but somehow we did not do this game.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
So, this is a game that I'm going to pick for this week,

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:04.000
and the game I'm going to talk about is Crystal Castles.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Not to be confused with the band.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.000
I'm pretty sure the band got their name from this video game,

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
but I want to talk about the video game because,

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000
and the reason why I picked this is that this is one of the first video games

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000
I actually have a memory of playing this game.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I remember playing this at Chuck E. Cheese Pizza

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000
when I had to step on a box to be able to reach.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Do you remember that as a kid?

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000
You had to step on the booster box so you could actually reach the controller,

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
which was a spinny ball.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000
You used a track ball to be able to control this game,

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000
which was not really something that was heard of for a lot of games back in the day.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
I mean, there were others like Missile Commander and stuff,

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
but Crystal Castles is definitely one of my favorites.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000
So Crystal Castles was released in the arcades by Atari in 1983.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
You play as a character named Bentley Bear,

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.000
and the object is to collect gems on these 3D kind of maps.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Part of the game's art style was very unique.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
You didn't see a lot of games like it at the time.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
It is an action game.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000
You've got to get through there quickly.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
If you're too slow, the bees are going to come out.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
And not the bees, not the bees,

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
and the bees will sting you if you get too close to them.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Crystal Castles has nine levels, and there's four castles each.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.000
There is a bonus tenth level if you get past everything.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
There's a map called The End.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
It's the tenth level with just one.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000
There's the bees!

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
There's the bees, not the bees!

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
You clear the entire game if you're able to beat that tenth board.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.000
So there is an ending, which at the time in 1983,

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
there wasn't a lot of video games that had an ending either.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000
So it was a little bit new.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000
It wasn't the first, but there wasn't a lot of games with this.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Also, you'll notice that the little song that plays in the background,

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000
it's The Nutcracker Suite.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
That's The Nutcracker.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
So that's the song that plays when it...

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
I should have picked this as a Christmas game.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Oh well, a late Christmas title.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
So anyway, Bentley Baron can jump,

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
and of course you use the trackball to get the different gems.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
That's what you have, a trackball and a jump button.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
You pick up gems by walking over them,

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
and once you get the last gem, you get a bonus.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
But there are enemies that are also trying to get the gems,

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
and you get a lower bonus if they get the last gem.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
And you get a weird version of the theme that goes,

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
It's a really sad version of the theme.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Enemies, you can try and avoid them.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000
You can also run over some of them, like the little gem eaters.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
If you run over them when they're eating a gem,

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
you can actually destroy them, which is kind of neat.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
So at the beginning of a maze, you get one point for each gem,

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
and that value keeps going up to a maximum of 99.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
There are hats and honeypots,

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000
and that gives you the ability to be able to actually defeat

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
certain enemies in the game.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
There's trees and all this other stuff, too.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
So I think I've described the game well enough.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Let's talk about some Easter eggs.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000
If you jump 100 times in the southeast corner of level 1

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
and then you clear the maze of gems,

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Atari will appear on level 2.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
That's it.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.000
On level 5-4, if you kill the witch, Brithilda,

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000
and you get to the corner of the area where she was and you jump,

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000
you will see the initials FXL.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:16.000
That is a designer of Crystal Castles, Franz X. Lanzinger,

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
because remember, this was back in the age when developers

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000
would sneak themselves into games.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Crystal Castles used a chip called the Lita chip

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000
and a custom trackball controller.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
The original name of Bentley Bear was Braveheart Bear,

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000
but apparently some advocates for Native Americans

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
complained about this name, so they changed the name of that,

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
which is an interesting fact I never realized before.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Crystal Castles was ported to all sorts of systems.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
The Apple II, Atari 2600, Atari 8-bit...

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
I was going to say, the Apple II is what I played this on.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000
The Electron, the ZX Spectrum, the Amstrad CPC.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
I mean, you name it in the 80s,

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
you think we have a lot of consoles now,

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
but there was a ton of them in the 80s,

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
and Crystal Castles was on just about all of them.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
There's actually two versions on the Commodore 64.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000
There was a prototype by Atarisoft that wasn't released,

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000
and then it was purchased by U.S. Gold and released,

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
and then there was a ThunderVision version.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000
It's kind of interesting there's like two...

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
I'm surprised we haven't seen Atari try to bring this back.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Well, since you bring that up,

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000
you can pick it up in some different anthologies.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Crystal Castles exists in Atari Anniversary Edition,

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
as well as the Atari Vault, which is on Steam,

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000
and you play it with a mouse, which isn't the same as a trackball,

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
but it's about the closest you're going to be able to get.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Also, did you ever play Atari Karts on the Atari Jaguar?

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Probably not, but Bentley Bear is one of the characters in that game,

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000
and Bentley Bear made a cameo in Wreck-It Ralph.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.000
So, there it is, your classic game of the week, Crystal Castles,

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
one of my earliest gaming memories,

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000
and just a game I think is really cool.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
For its age, remember, 1983,

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
there really weren't a lot of games like it.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000
It was a very unique sort of thing in the arcade.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
You know when I've recently played this?

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
On the arcade 1UP Centipede cabinet,

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
because they have Crystal Castles in there.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Oh, yeah.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Hey, speaking of those arcade 1UP cabinets,

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
and actually I should go ahead and point out,

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
we're going to open up Discord here shortly,

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.000
so if you want to join us, you can via the listener roundtable in Discord.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
You just go to vognetwork.com slash Discord,

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
and you can join the green room,

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
and we'll be getting to some of those calls shortly.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
I would love to hear from some of you that went to MAGFest,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
because I couldn't go this year.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Not that I'm saying you have to, but I would love to hear from some of you.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000
But anyway, so you were talking about the 1UP cabinets.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
So did you know? I didn't even know this was a thing now.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000
So we were at Target, because sometimes when you're bored, you go shopping at Target,

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000
and we saw now not only do they have the...

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Well, Target didn't have the arcade ones.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
They have bar top machines now,

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
and they're only $199.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
They're a little cheaper, and they're already pre-made.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Well, the full-sized ones are $199, too.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Oh, do those drop in price?

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000
A lot of those did.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Oh, I thought they were still $300.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Yeah, that's why I've looked at the bar tops.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
For $200, I might be tempted to finally...

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Well, we'll see. We'll see.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.000
But anyway, the bar top I was looking at was only...

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.000
They had two.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000
They had a Pac-Man, and I was like, oh, and a Ms. Pac...

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000
No, Pac and Pal.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
So it was Pac-Man and Pac and Pal.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:15.000
And then the other one was Galaxian and Galaga.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Yeah.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
And I was like, I'm not really that...

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
And then you can see on the back there are others.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000
They just weren't at that Target.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000
There's like a Dig Dug and a Dig Dug 2.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
I thought that one was probably the most interesting for me.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.000
But none of the collections really excited me.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.000
They didn't seem to have as many games as the stand-up ones do.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Yeah, and especially nowadays, you can even find some stores closing out the Ninja Turtles cabinet.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
The four-player one for $199 as well.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000
So you have to get lucky.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, apparently at Consumer Electronics Show,

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000
we're going to see Pinball FX arcade one-up cabinets.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Three fourth-size digital pinball tables.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Well, those arcade one-up machines must be doing very well

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
because it seems like they're cranking them out now.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
So that's cool.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Yeah, pinball will be cool.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Yeah, it really will be.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:06.000
So let me check in on Discord and see if anybody is waiting to come on the show

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.000
because I was bad and I didn't set that up.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Yes, we do have one caller waiting.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000
So let's get to it.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Let's get to it.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Who's this?

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Hey, what's going on, everyone?

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000
It is Ranma.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Hey, not much.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Sorry if there's a little echo back for those listening.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000
I'm trying to fix that in studio.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000
What's up, buddy?

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Not too much.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
First of all, let me start with Happy New Year.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Thank you very much.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
You're the first caller of the decade, Ranma.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Woohoo!

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000
How was your holiday?

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Did you have a good one?

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000
It was good.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
We had a 1960s-style New Year's Eve party, so that was kind of fun.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Oh, that does sound kind of fun.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:40.000
I saw a lot of people did, like, Roaring Twenties kind of parties for, you know,

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000
like Flapper Girls and that whole sort of thing.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Their theme was a couple of cosplayers.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000
I know they did, like, a whole Sailor Moon Princesses Roaring Twenties theme.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
I'm just like, that's really cool.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.000
And my friend who was running the party, I was like, well, why didn't we do this?

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000
And she said, well, we did a Roaring Twenties party a few years ago.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.000
And I'm like, so we do a 2.0, you know?

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Yeah, you can recycle themes.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000
There's nothing wrong with that.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Well, what was on your mind tonight that you wanted to call in about?

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Well, I will say that there was a Roaring Twenties themed party at MAGFest this year.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.000
But I will also say that, believe it or not, I'm actually enjoying my Switch a lot more

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
than I thought I would.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Wait, did you go to MAG this year?

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
No, I couldn't do it.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:31.000
But if VOG is going next year, Anime Jam Session will follow right behind.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:38.000
It's upgraded from not going to happen to I'm trying to make it happen.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:43.000
The only kind of sticking point is something that actually Bobby brought up on his show

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000
as a sticking point for me, too.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Because I'm new at my job, I have the lowest amount of seniority on the team.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.000
So the weekend that they're doing MAGFest continues to be a challenge because that's

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000
still during the holiday period, which a lot of people have off.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000
But most people take the time between Christmas and New Year's Day off.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000
There's not a lot to take right after New Year's Day.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
So if the timing works out and I'm able to get the time off for it, but I have the least

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
seniority on the team, so I get like last pick.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Things like Labor Day, like for Dragon Con, that's easy peasy because most people on the

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
team have kids that are going back to school.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
They're not going on vacation that week.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
So I get that.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.000
And other stuff is really easy for me.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:29.000
The holidays can be a little harder, but it's on the gonna try list for next year.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:35.000
I definitely hear that because of Leap Year, most likely MAGFest will be the same as New

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Year's Eve weekend.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000
So you know they're going to party like it's no other tomorrow, you know?

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
I'm really not a fan.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:48.000
That may actually, I can say this definitively.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
I already have a show commitment.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I'm hosting a show on New Year's Eve.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
I can already say that for this coming year.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000
So if MAGFest is New Year's Eve, I can't do it.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Yeah, because one year MAGFest was the same weekend as New Year's Eve and they just went

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
all out for it.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Oh gosh, I really hope not.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Anyway, so I'm sorry.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
What were we trying to get you to talk about?

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
What did you want to talk about besides MAGFest?

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:20.000
I was going to say I'm really enjoying my Switch a lot more than I thought I would.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000
And why is that?

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000
I don't know.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000
I just kept saying that my Switch will be a stay-at-home console.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I will play it sparingly.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
It's just another system to me.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000
And then what I said on Facebook, I got a Switch.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Here's my code.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:42.000
I've come to the realization that I have more friends with Switches than PlayStation 4s

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.000
and Xbox Ones.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:49.000
And I'm just sitting here going, remember when everybody had the Wii and it was either

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
a Wii 60 or a PS Wii household?

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000
I remember you mentioned that once.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:02.000
And I'm realizing that now it's becoming people either have the Xbox Switch household or PlayStation

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Switch household or both.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000
So the Switch has become like the console that basically almost everybody has now.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:14.000
I would say there's still, I mean, I guess maybe I'm just crazy because I have all those

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000
consoles, but I think there is definitely some truth to what you're saying.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000
I think, you know, some folks have one of the big consoles and then they also have the

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Nintendo Switch.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:27.000
You know, it's kind of like a secondary console, but for more and more people, especially in

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000
this quiet year where not a lot is happening with PlayStation.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Yes, I realize we have Last of Us 2 and Final Fantasy 7 Remake.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000
It's not exactly a totally quiet year, but you guys know what I mean.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000
We're in that kind of lull before the PlayStation 5.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000
So I think more and more people are like actively using their Switch.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Yeah.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000
And during the holidays at work, it's been like a lull.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
So there's not many support tickets coming in.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Next thing you know, we actually now have a Switch Fight Club on Fridays.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
And also one person brings in their console.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000
We're all playing Smash Brothers, either hooked up to the big screen TV or to somebody's

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000
work monitor.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
And we're just, hey, it's 12 o'clock at lunchtime.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Grab your controllers, you know?

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Yeah.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000
So that's cool.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
I like that you can kind of do that at work.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:20.000
So my industry and my coworkers, I'm lucky now that I have Pokemon Go raids because my

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
building is right in front of a gym.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:27.000
So sometimes if I look in the Citi Discord, I'll see that there's a thing there and there's

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:32.000
actually coworkers that all raid that gym with something good pops.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
So that's about as good as I can get.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.000
I mean, I ain't gonna lie.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.000
I think it was like Wednesday before New Year's.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:45.000
The supervisors and the managers left and we're all just sitting here.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000
I just pulled up my Switch, sat on my desk, pushed my chair all the way down,

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.000
reclined all the way back and just started playing some Mario Kart.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I wish I could, but my role involves working on projects.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.000
So I always kind of have something to do and I'm not customer driven in that regard.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000
So I can't really do that, but that's cool.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:09.000
I mean, hey, maybe I should be doing that type of thing on lunch, but I don't know.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
We get out walk on lunches.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
That's the thing to do.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
I mean, why not both?

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
I mean, you got lunch, breakout, ring fit adventure.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Get the whole office into it.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
I do the GPS gaming while we walk.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
That's when I play my Pokemon or something.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.000
So there is that.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Which reminds me because of Loki talking about it.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
I downloaded that Orna game.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000
So I'm going to try it out tomorrow and see how much I like it.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
All right. Good luck to you.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
All I can say is that is in chat right now.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.000
And I'll say, look at what you've done.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Like the Orna creators owe you a lot of money.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000
So.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000
All right.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Well, anything else on your mind, my friend?

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000
No, that's it.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000
All right.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Well, take care.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Have a great 2020.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Looking forward to anime jam session being back.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
And yeah, have a great one.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000
We'll be back next week.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:00.000
And we got a lot of stuff to cover and enjoy the new decade and make it so.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Sounds good.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Will do.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000
I'll be making it.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000
So March 1st.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Take care, buddy.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000
All right.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Bye.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000
All right.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000
All right.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000
If you want to call in, head over to our green room over at vog network dot com slash discord.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.000
I actually have some emails to read.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.000
So every week you guys can email us at participate at orange lounge radio dot com.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.000
And we jump into the mailbag and read our favorite emails, which we only have one this week.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000
I will point out we did get a spam email and this is what cracked me up.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
So we got to I'm not going to say what it's.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Well, it's a it's a podcast related service, but I can tell you who it is or what services.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000
But we got spam email.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
But this cracked me up.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000
You ready?

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Ready for the opening line?

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Yes.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Now.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Hi.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.000
I've noticed that your podcast is really starting to gain traction.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.000
I mean, that is it is accurate.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.840
Doing it for a long time, but it's 17 years.

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:57.000
We're just we're just finally starting to get notice.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Hey, we got noticed by the spammer guy.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
I'm so excited.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Anyway.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Oh, Bobby says, I got the same email.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Oh, I'm glad they they must have visited our Web site.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Start hitting us all up.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
I don't know.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Anyway.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000
All right.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Moving on.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000
We have a much better non spam email from or is it a spam email?

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000
I don't know.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
From Redertainment who emailed us this week.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Hello, peoples.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Recently, I've made the decision to switch to using Spotify for listening to the podcast.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Previously, I was using the iOS podcast app and have now joined the growing horde of people

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.000
who see that app as a goddamn motherfucking piece of goddamn shit.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
That is what it says.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000
All apps all run together.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Exclamation points.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Cool.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Most of the podcasts that I was previously listening to are available on Spotify with

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
one notable exception.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Is there a reason for this?

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Stay care.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Redertainment.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:52.000
I'm sort of I was holding off for reasons that have nothing to do with Spotify.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000
I like Spotify.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000
I use it myself.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.000
There's other reasons.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.000
I'm hoping that some of those things will get kind of moving.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Basically, long story short, we're going to be moving where the podcast is.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000
This is something I've been talking about for like a year, and it's one of those things

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
where I like we just really need to like get up and do it.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.000
It's kind of one of those I want to use like some of the creative things you're talking

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.000
about behind the scene and kind of like just all do it at once like a big Band-Aid ripoff

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.000
OLR 2020 type of thing.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:22.000
I'm hoping that is something that's going to happen in a matter of weeks, not months.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:27.000
So that's all because I don't want Spotify to point to an old feed and the old feeds

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:32.000
not there anymore because I'm already like deathly worried that we're going to lose the

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Apple side of things.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000
But I'm just yeah.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Anyway, I'm talking a little bit in the weeds.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.000
I think we have some mechanisms in place that that doesn't happen.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Yeah, that's why we're not on Spotify yet.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:47.000
I've really been adding us to any podcast directories.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000
I'm trying to decide if maybe when we change, I might be willing to forgive Stitcher.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:56.000
If you think if you want OLR back on Stitcher, send me a tweet or something

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.000
that lets me know that because if I don't hear anything, I'm not going to bother.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.000
But if there's really enough of you out there that are listening on that and you really want OLR in there,

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.000
I'll think about it.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:13.000
My problem with them, if you forgot, is that for the longest time they stopped updating their feed

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:17.000
with our episodes and people were emailing us going, did you guys quit OLR?

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
And it's like, oh, my God, no.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
And you can't like stop.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Like I was really this is why we're just now gaining traction.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000
That's why we're just now gaining traction.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Exactly.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.000
That's why I got very irritated with Stitcher for those reasons and others.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
There's terrible support behind the scenes.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.000
But I understand they've switched owners probably three times since then.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
So I don't know. We'll see. We'll see.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.000
So.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, my favorite part of that spam email was he asked me to reply with my RSS feed.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:52.000
He sent it to my email address that is only available on my RSS feed.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Funny.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000
All right.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:59.000
She Hulk says, put it up on Mixer and YouTube.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Jury's out on that one, because keep in mind that subscribing to our VoG network channel here on Twitch is how you get access to the video feed.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:15.000
So we want there to be some car is how you get excuse me, the video on demand so you can watch it when you're not live.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:22.000
I'd be open to maybe a delay or maybe like because part of the Twitch contractor would have to be a delay anyway.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
And this is not a secret. Everybody knows this.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:31.000
In the affiliate agreement, I might be open to like a six week or a month delay to YouTube.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:38.000
But that is something I'll have to talk over with Bobby and the other creative minds at VoG and figure out if there's a consensus on that.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
So hope that's fair. So.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
All right.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Swang Tong says, well, they finally took you off on Stitcher.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
I stopped listening because I thought you quit.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Yeah, I kind of had to email him and demand it.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Like I hated to be like one of those, like, can I speak to the manager?

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000
But I thought it was kind of messed up. It was really messed up.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000
So anyway, that was it from entertainment.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.000
This message brought to you by me totally understanding of dark soccer.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Didn't want to yell out the long string of expletives I used earlier.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Well, lucky you that I read the email tonight, isn't it?

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:11.000
So anyway, if you guys have emails for a future week, participate at orange lounge.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Trader dot com is the place to do so.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Do we have any last minute stories?

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Yes, you had a couple of things we didn't squeeze.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Yes, I did have one thing that I just noticed.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:23.000
So remember why? Well, not a while back, but like within the last week or so,

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:30.000
we talked about the brand new PlayStation four dual shock back button attachment

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:36.000
that they had where you can do you can attach those programmable back buttons to it.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Well, as our initial thought might be, hey, this might be something tied to the PlayStation five.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Well, sure enough, come out brand new patent for the dual shock five and it's got back buttons.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Did that just come out this evening? That came out this week.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
I forgot about it. I was like, I don't remember reading about that.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:58.000
OK. Yeah. So they've got. Yeah, it's going to be some back buttons.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:03.000
And I don't know if they're also programmable, but that's why at least.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:08.000
So, you know, you now know that those back buttons were there for a reason.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Makes sense. So I saw that coming. That's it.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000
All right. Well, I think with that, we're going to go ahead and close up shop.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.000
So I'm sorry to those that didn't get through tonight, but please email us.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Participate at Orange Laundry dot com is the place to send an email if you want to get through in a future week.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:30.000
But I think just with it being a holiday week and I keep saying it's going to be a shorter show.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.000
I think this one is going to be a shorter show tonight. So that's it.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:41.000
And that's it. Thank you again for being here, despite everything else going on out there tonight with the awesome games and the Globes.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:45.000
And many of you are coming back from MagFest and you're just like, I'm going to bed.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000
I completely understand. So thanks for being here.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:52.000
But many of you I know are listening on the podcast feed throughout the week as an as a result.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:58.000
So thank you to all of you as well. Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the show tonight.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Thank you guys for listening. If you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend about the show.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:09.000
But if the voices aren't here, we can't hear them. A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever you found this podcast.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:15.000
That all goes an awful long way. That being said, Loki, your final thoughts tonight.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Still working on my game. It's kind of hard, though, with all the kids demanding.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Like I tried to work on it yesterday and today and just every two minutes.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:30.000
It's just I need this. I need something. I need something. I need something. I need something. And that's just the whole family.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:35.000
It's like I can't focus long enough to actually work on something.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:41.000
It's annoying. So I get like two hours a week. I help someone else debug their game, you know,

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000
because I got irritated that they were talking about how they run into this.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.000
I'm like, just let me look at it. I can fix it, I bet. And then sure enough, I did.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:55.000
All right. Well, that's that's it. We're done. We're wrapped up for tonight.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:00.000
My final thought would be, you know, we're sitting on a January, the first show of the year.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.000
It's going to be a very exciting year for games. There's a lot of good stuff coming out.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:10.000
I think I would just say, have fun with it. Video games are fun, people. Keep it fun. Have fun.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Gaming is for everyone. That's my final thought. I think we'll leave it on that note.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.000
We'll be back in seven days to do it all over again. Have a great gaming week.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:21.000
We're excited for everybody to be back at work and gaming news to come out again this next week.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:26.000
So we'll talk about, there's probably gonna be a lot of it, too, because it'll be built up over the holiday weeks.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Hopefully. We'll see. We'll be back to talk about whatever it is in seven days.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Until then, have a great week. Happy gaming. Good night.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.000
