This week all I want to say is that D.L. Athera did an incredible thing, likely saving Aiden Jackson's life, especially with I presume an incomplete amount of detail about his personal life. This is the best headline in tonight's news, stay tuned for plenty more, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:50.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 806 for this January the 12th of 2020. My name is Rob Roberts and welcome back this week DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Hi.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
It's great to have you back with us.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Thank you.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Are you enjoying your coffee?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
I am.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Thank you.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
And I always appreciate that you will restock any coffee that you take with more coffee.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Well, I just remember-

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Let the coffee flow.

01:04.000 --> 01:11.000
Well, I came by last weekend to bring Alan some books which I still have them have some more in my car.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Oh really? Okay.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
And the, and y'all were gracious enough to give me some coffee and we got into the discussion about-

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
It's just coffee.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
Coffee flavored coffee. And that Alan wanted coffee flavored coffee.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
Okay, here's the thing. This is why we talk about coffee flavored coffee because I am a big fan of, you know, we use the little-

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
You like the froufrou.

01:31.000 --> 01:39.000
We use the little pre-made pre-packaged cup things that a lot of people use, right? So I like the, like we have cinnamon roll right now. Love that.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
I'm liking the gingerbread with Snickers in it.

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
There's gingerbread we got on discount because Christmas is over. We got, you know, I like to get the hazelnut and the vanilla and I have coconut mocha at work.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
But Alan is like, I just want coffee flavored coffee. He doesn't like all that stuff.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
It's like Dennis Leary. I don't want your maple nut crunch. I want coffee flavored coffee.

02:00.000 --> 02:10.000
But yeah, so when I, because I mean, I go to home goods a lot and I go to Ross and you can get K cups at both places relatively inexpensive.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
Yeah, I always forget. We always, you know, Target.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
Or the grocery outlet. I figure if I'm going to name two places, I'll name three to be fair.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Fair.

02:18.000 --> 02:27.000
But, um, but I happen to be at Ross looking for some organizational stuff and found just like legit medium roast coffee.

02:27.000 --> 02:35.000
And I was like, if I'm going to drink the coffee at Robin Allen's place, I'm going to get coffee that I will drink and that they will like.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
So I got the medium roast.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Well, we appreciate it.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
You're welcome. So do I.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
For what it's worth, the decaf I usually drink is coffee flavored.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Yeah.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Even though it's decaf.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
It's hard to find flavored decafs.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
It is. It is. I know a lot of you would say, what's the point? But it's just, it's like the dessert coffee. I like that.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
You know, coffee is dessert.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
Well, I found though this gingerbread is really good with that Snickers creamer in it.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Just saying it's really good.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
But if you're at my house, so all the coffee at my house is typically coffee flavored coffee.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
I get my beans from Phil's.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
I will preach the gospel of Phil's coffee until I die.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Or sometimes I'll do temple.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
And that's mostly I don't think Phil's really exists.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
No, I first went I went to my first Phil's in L.A.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Oh, OK.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
So but it's mostly California West Coast stuff.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Maybe like one in Arizona.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
But they ship.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
OK. Oh, OK.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
And I will tell I'll do this. I'll do this.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
One person.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
One person out there. And I will just do this because I'm a nice person.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
If you can pick my.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
Favorite kind of chocolate.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
OK, my absolute favorite brand of chocolate.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
OK, I will send you a bag of Phil's filtered soul.

03:54.000 --> 04:00.000
Do they have to send you the chocolate or did you just yell it out in chat?

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
How does this work? They have to they have to email participate.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Oh, OK.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
And the first one that guesses my favorite brand of chocolate.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
OK, we'll get a like a half pound or I have to see what I can get,

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
but either half pound or whole pound bag of Phil's filtered soul.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
OK, look at Dark Soccer.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Get in that mail. You can't be in California.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
All right. Participate at Orange Lounge radio dot com.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Why are you excluding California because they can just get it here.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
OK. OK.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
Unless you're like in the remote boonies in California, which they exist.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Just say of course.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
But, you know, actually, you know, I don't care if you're in California.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
I'll just do it.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Clearly, these rules were not thought out beforehand.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
OK. No, I just made it up.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
So but you have to guess what my favorite brand of chocolate is.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
And I will give everyone one hint.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
Rob always brings me some back from Chicago.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
OK. OK. I know what it is. All right.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
You can just come to my house.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
You got to email participate at Orange Lounge radio dot com.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
That that mailbag is going to blow up later in the show.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Hello as well, of course, to Tech Master Loki.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Hey, what's up every week? Hi. Good.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I see you're over there playing Orna.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
I have to get the best or the most out of the double experience thing.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
The latest OLR obsession amongst listeners and hosts alike.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
What's up with that, though? You left the party.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
Now you can't see you can't see the blacksmith I built right here.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
I got one of them in my house. OK, fine.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Fine. I believe the party because I was just carrying you guys.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
And, you know, I, I needed to like get level up.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
And I was like, it's just taking so long and I'm getting so much experience.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Like, oh, all of them are getting some experience.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
So I had the bail. Oh, I thought.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
But we weren't giving it back to you.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
It didn't seem like it was going up.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
I heard in the last patch they did something with the balancing

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
where like you don't benefit from power leveling like it used to be.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Like you got in the game like right.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Unfortunately, at the wrong time for that.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
Yeah. So I just because once I left the party,

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
like I've been I've gone up like 10 levels.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
So it's it's much faster by myself for now.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
But, you know, if I build anything near your house,

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
or what I've been doing is if I build anything, I may just make it public.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
And so that everybody can benefit from it.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I just don't touch my territories that I control.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
I saw that earlier.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Should I challenge his territory?

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
I'm like, nah.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
I've been I've been captured really like too much.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
I've been capturing territory in a bunch of strange places.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
Like I'll just be like I was out like walking along the river the other day,

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
just half fitness, half.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
There's an Ingress portal out there I was trying to get.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
And I was like, let me bring up Orna.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
And I was like, wow, there's like a completely unclaimed region out here,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
because who the fuck ever comes out here?

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Like way in the back booty.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
You know, only a crazy ass Ingress player,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
which why I'm surprised is that didn't have it.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
But I guess she didn't think to bring up Orna back there.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
So I grabbed it.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
And yeah, I I've been finding it in all sorts of like weird places,

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
just like regions to control and things like that.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
But there's no like there's no like map you can bring up to see where these places are.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
You won't get a list.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Right. They do.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
And they're supposed to have like I haven't seen it yet,

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
but at least it hasn't been pushed to my device.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
But they have a beta map that's coming where you can actually zoom out a little bit

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
and kind of rotate it and all that stuff.

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
But oh, I haven't been able to to see that.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
Interesting. I must. Yeah, I must have completely missed that.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
So. All right.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Well, anyway, let's get into tonight's show.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
It is a podcast about video games.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
I mean, sometimes sometimes, you know, we just were talking about video games,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
location, cell phone, gaming's is a big part of that.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
So we'll talk a little bit about Pokemon Go later.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
I know that's in the news.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
There's been a lot of Pokemon news this week.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
But first, we want to take a step back and take a look at last year,

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
because we have yet to really talk about our top video games of twenty nineteen.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
We have put it off a little bit because we wanted time to play more games.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
And then we weren't able to do it last week because Dark Sakura was unexpectedly gone.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
But she's back tonight.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
And so we can talk about our top games of twenty nineteen.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
So and I gave full disclosure on saying what happened.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Oh, yeah. We talked about it, you know.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
So but I wanted just to take a moment and thank everyone who did reach out.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
So Dan and I appreciate it.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
We've been going through.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
We found some very interesting things like turtles, the genitalia,

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
like ceramic turtles, not like ceramic turtles.

08:30.000 --> 08:38.000
Yes, but but we've also found like just like little things that Dan had done when he was a kid,

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
like like those art plates. Oh, yeah, sure.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
And some of his like a little bit of video game stuff around.

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
We reclaimed our laser desks. OK, so but just very interesting things.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
All right. Well, you know, that's the nice thing about having done the show for so long and doing it live is that,

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
you know, people around here gender genuinely care about each other.

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
So including the listeners care about us and and I care about most of you.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
No, I don't want to I don't want to cheapen the moment with a joke.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
I do I do care as well. So definitely we all look out for each other.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
So I know a lot of people looking out for you guys last week, so it's great to have you back.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Thank you. But tonight we're going to move into our top games of twenty nineteen.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
So I know it's a little bit delayed, but we're not quite to January 15th yet.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
I think for some people, the holidays don't end until tomorrow. So we'll get into that now.

09:25.000 --> 09:31.000
Let's talk about our top games of the year. So each of us has picked three games using any criteria we want.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
OK, this is not it's not your games. It's our games.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
So these lists are not wrong.

09:37.000 --> 09:46.000
They're not rigged because we used whatever criteria we damn well play pleased in order to come up with our top three games of the year.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
So here they are. I'll pick on Loki. Why not? Why don't you go first?

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
We number your number three pick your number three game of the twenty nineteen.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
Let's see. So my number three game is going to be Minecraft Earth, I guess.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
OK. Oh, interesting. A game that's still kind of not done.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
Well, neither is the official Minecraft. True.

10:07.000 --> 10:15.000
Although I noticed I actually brought up Minecraft Earth this week and they've there's already more like tutorial stuff there that wasn't there before.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
Yeah, there's not much tutorial you really need for that game. I mean, I don't know.

10:20.000 --> 10:29.000
Yeah, it's been kind of fun. I play it every now and then. I don't play it a ton because there's not a whole lot of reason to go and collect things aside from getting experience.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
But even the experience is just kind of like it unlocks some more places he can build stuff.

10:34.000 --> 10:41.000
But any of the stuff that I build, I end up just, you know, basically bulldozing the whole thing and just starting from scratch.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
But you can get different biomes and stuff and whatnot.

10:44.000 --> 10:52.000
But you never really run out of like blocks to build with because you collect so many in the course of playing the game.

10:52.000 --> 11:02.000
So, I know if it wasn't such a battery sink, I'd probably play it a whole ton more. But yeah, it really just drains that battery.

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
Well, and from a technological perspective, it is accomplishing like something kind of new, something really neat, you know?

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
Yeah, the AR stuff is pretty fun. It's actually really cool.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
Yeah, like, you know, Pokemon Go just got the whole AR buddies take pictures of your Pokemon buddies.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Yeah, this is way more elaborate.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
This Minecraft Earth thing is already like steps and steps beyond that.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
Like the AR stuff, and it works pretty good too, actually. So the AR stuff, they have the little adventures.

11:26.000 --> 11:33.000
It's basically just playing Minecraft with like a small square block, like 16 by 16 or whatever.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
And a lot of it you're just kind of walking over, you're kind of hovering over it.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
And you're just kind of digging stuff out.

11:39.000 --> 11:45.000
And a lot of times it could be just killing some enemies and then there may be some golden diamond down there.

11:45.000 --> 11:51.000
Or it could be you're solving a puzzle and then you get more like, you know, resources that way.

11:51.000 --> 11:59.000
But it's pretty interesting and they have a ton of them at parks and they pop in and out like every few minutes.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
And I mean, so you can keep doing that over and over and get a lot of resources that way.

12:03.000 --> 12:10.000
But then there's also the fact if you die, you lose everything that you have in your inventory, like Minecraft.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
So you have to be careful what you, well, not your full inventory.

12:14.000 --> 12:20.000
You basically have, you know, like in regular Minecraft where you have a bar full of stuff in it.

12:20.000 --> 12:27.000
So you can take into those adventures one row of things and then you just have to be careful.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
Like if you start to die, then you exit out.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
But you just have to be careful.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
The only time that the game's been kind of cheap on me is like I'll be like mining stuff.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
I've already killed all the enemies and all of a sudden there's a skeleton that comes from behind.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
I'm like, what the fuck? You know, why is there a skeleton here all of a sudden?

12:46.000 --> 12:53.000
But usually a lot of that, like if I'm getting bum rushed by a few things, I can just like exit, close it, and you're fine.

12:53.000 --> 12:59.000
All right. Minecraft Earth. Good pick. Something I think we'll see more of probably as we move into 2020.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
Dark Sakura, we'll go to you. What's your number three game of 2019?

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Death Stranding. Because...

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
I kind of figured that would show up on your list somewhere.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
I didn't play it, but I enjoyed watching the fuck out of it.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
And for me, that's all I really wanted out of it was just the story.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
I thought the story was really interesting and kind of a mind fuck and that's kind of up my alley.

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
So, I mean, it was the closest I could get to having that weird brain fuck of Silent Hill.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
So I was cool with it. And Bridge Baby is adorable.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
And Lindsay Wagner.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Bridge Baby.

13:31.000 --> 13:37.000
And people apparently really enjoy urinating in front of Conan O'Brien's little area.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Bridge Baby.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
I think Dark Sakura would be one of them if she was playing it regularly, but...

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Well, I'd have to have a Go-Girling game.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
What do you think about...

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
Because that's the only way I could whip out a dick and pee.

13:49.000 --> 13:54.000
Well, that's OK. You're taking on the role of Norman Reedus, so you're whipping out his dick to...

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
Well then, some people would really be into that.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
Dear Mr. Reedus, are you aware that people are whipping out your dick?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
There was...

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
I didn't consent to this.

14:05.000 --> 14:11.000
I posted something on Twitter where it's like, is it weird that we force him to go to the bathroom and poop and then we get served an ad for...

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
Well, you know, with the amount of rock, or was it...

14:14.000 --> 14:22.000
Monster energy drinks he's drinking in the game, then it's no wonder he has to use the bathroom all the time because Jesus Christ.

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
What's that doing to your insides as I sip my 12-ounce Red Bull?

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
I know you haven't really sat down and played the game and you're more into it for the story,

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
but I know for the longest time here on OLR, the what the fuck is Death Stranding was kind of like...

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
I still don't know.

14:39.000 --> 14:47.000
It was kind of like the running gag on the show, but now that we understand this is the game, this is the point, this is what you're playing,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
what do you think about how that all turned out?

14:49.000 --> 14:56.000
Because for me, I was always expecting it to be something a little more action-y or something, and it's very much not that, but I'm OK with that.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
I'm totally OK with what it is.

14:58.000 --> 15:06.000
Hmm. Well, in the end, it's I think about the connections that we have with each other,

15:06.000 --> 15:12.000
and also about the dangers inherent to having connections with others.

15:12.000 --> 15:19.000
You know, it's definitely that sort of isolationist versus expansionist point of view.

15:19.000 --> 15:25.000
You know, if you even think about it on a global scale, it can really be applied almost in a political spectrum.

15:25.000 --> 15:32.000
It's very allegorical to things that we see going on around us today.

15:32.000 --> 15:41.000
For me, I just like the fact that it lets you know that there is really no one right way versus a wrong way.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
But sometimes if you...

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
It's really kind of hard to describe, you know.

15:47.000 --> 15:59.000
And then also the thing that I like, too, is that it went through sort of the discussion of duty versus individual desire,

15:59.000 --> 16:07.000
and what some people will do for, like, Die Hard Man and his duty, and what he did in the name of his duty,

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
and then how it affected him the rest of his life.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
Sort of like it's the I was just following orders thing versus making your own moral decision for yourself.

16:17.000 --> 16:23.000
The individual characters just were really... Dead Man was another interesting one.

16:23.000 --> 16:31.000
Just kind of a moral thing. Is this a person? Does it have a soul?

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
I'm not trying to go too much in because people are still playing it, you know.

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
But there was so much depth and thought that went into everything in it.

16:41.000 --> 16:48.000
And people are just like... People are uncomfortable with, I think, doing the deep dive in the story elements with it.

16:48.000 --> 16:53.000
And so for them, it's easier just to make fun of it. Or say, oh, it was weird, blah, blah, blah.

16:53.000 --> 16:59.000
People are like that. People don't want to take a deep dive into disturbing topics.

16:59.000 --> 17:06.000
But the moment that you do, you find part of your view of life is a little bit expanded.

17:06.000 --> 17:13.000
And I honestly think that the game did ask some of those more ambiguous moral questions of the player.

17:13.000 --> 17:20.000
What do you think of this? Forcing them to look at these things, life and death, and moral decisions,

17:20.000 --> 17:26.000
and the communication and connections of other people, and kind of evaluate that in themselves.

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
Deep. I need to spend more time with it. Honestly, I got sidetracked by other games.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
But I enjoyed what I played of it, for sure.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
That's the way I like games like that. I like Detroit for some of the same things.

17:38.000 --> 17:44.000
It's just... I like a question that a game asks.

17:44.000 --> 17:52.000
When it asks a question that's going to have a deep impact philosophically on your worldview. Just saying.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
The other thing I want to mention about that game is the soundtrack.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
Love the church's song. A lot of hipster music, I suppose. But it's all really good.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
There's some really good stuff in there. So, all right. Death Stranding it is.

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
My number three pick is going to be kind of an obvious, like, oh, of course he's going to say something like that.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
But I think this really deserves it in many ways.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
And I'm going to say the Final Fantasy XIV Shadowbringers expansion will be my number three game of the year.

18:17.000 --> 18:23.000
Just because I think the expansion was very strong with what it brought to the game.

18:23.000 --> 18:28.000
You know, just kind of upping the formula that they started with Realm Reborn.

18:28.000 --> 18:35.000
But really, you know, perfecting it, making a lot of job classes a little more tighter and a little more fun.

18:35.000 --> 18:43.000
Like, for example, you know, they took the job Machinist and it was a little bit clunky, relied a little bit on luck.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
They injected a little bit of Edgar from Final Fantasy VI into it.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
So, like, now you have a Bioblaster and an autocrossbow and stuff.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
And let me tell you, it is really fucking fun.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Oh, and drill. Drill is important, too.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
Like, it's like they take a lot of this fantasy stuff.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
You're like, I don't know how this would ever work in an MMO, but they do it and it's great.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
And never mind the story, which, you know, was really good.

19:05.000 --> 19:12.000
You know, not to get too spoilery, but the kind of the trick about it is that it doesn't really take place in the same world that the rest of the game does.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I'll sort of kind of keep it vague.

19:14.000 --> 19:19.000
But I think that actually really helps for an expansion kind of story.

19:19.000 --> 19:27.000
That it's a little bit more like, oh, now our adventurers are over here doing this thing, but there's all these complicated problems that go with that.

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
And I think it allowed the story to play out very, very well.

19:32.000 --> 19:39.000
I didn't love the ending compared to some of the other expansions, but I have enjoyed the patch content this week.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
I finally finished up the most recent patch, the 5.1 patch.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
And I did like how that kind of wrapped up and where that went in that story.

19:47.000 --> 19:56.000
And of course, the developers continue to do an amazing job supporting the game post launch with regular patches, which not every MMO is doing that well anymore.

19:56.000 --> 20:04.000
So I think they really get kudos for running just a really strong premier MMO right now.

20:04.000 --> 20:10.000
And what might be the strongest expansion they'll ever do, which they just put out.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
I mean, I hope, of course, whatever they do next might even go a step beyond that.

20:14.000 --> 20:20.000
But if this is as good as it gets, it's been pretty damn good. So I will take it.

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
So there you go. I pick Final Fantasy XIV Shadowbringers. It's my number three game of the year.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
So let's get to the second choices on the list.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
So far, everybody's got different games. I was thinking there'd be more overlap. I think there will be later, but we'll see.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Here we go. Loki, your number two game.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
My number two game is going to be What the Golf.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
That is pretty fun. I've been enjoying it.

20:42.000 --> 20:49.000
My one of my favorite indie games of the year. So, yeah, I've enjoyed playing it quite a bit.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
So I haven't finished it yet. So I'll have to go back to it at some point.

20:52.000 --> 20:58.000
But definitely worth checking out, especially if you have Apple Arcade or something like that, because it's part of that.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
What is it about this game that you love so dang much?

21:00.000 --> 21:06.000
It's just because it's like it's got this street, a strange like kind of Katamari feel to it, just like with the music and everything.

21:06.000 --> 21:14.000
And it's just a strange like it's not even really about golf. It's just kind of a strange like puzzle game.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
And I don't know, it just it's got a weird aesthetic to it. That's charming.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
OK. Yeah. All right. What the golf? Number two.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
Dark Sakura, how about you? Your number two pick.

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
I'm going to pick Resident Evil 2 because I fucking enjoy the shit out of it.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
A lot of people did. You're not alone.

21:32.000 --> 21:37.000
Resident Evil 2, honestly, I liked better than the first one, and I really loved the first one.

21:37.000 --> 21:43.000
But Resident Evil 2 was the one that cemented my love for the series and the voice acting was top notch.

21:43.000 --> 21:51.000
I kind of liked where they had some variations from the original version.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
And I'm also glad this is going to lead to a Resident Evil 3.

21:54.000 --> 21:59.000
So I also love watching people break that game. It's just fucking hilarious.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
But I really, I really enjoyed it. There's a lot to look at.

22:02.000 --> 22:08.000
Little Easter eggs, lots of things that, you know, if you can get the game where you can look around the scenery,

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
it's just absolutely in-depth and beautiful. And I really enjoyed it.

22:13.000 --> 22:18.000
Although it makes me think, why the hell do people build these weird ass puzzles in a police station?

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
Like, really, people? What the fuck were you thinking? Were you a cult?

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
So anyway, that's it. No, Silent Hill was about the cult.

22:24.000 --> 22:30.000
Anyway, you're not alone in our chat. ActDeft in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network,

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
because we do, I don't think I've said this line yet tonight,

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
but we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,

22:36.000 --> 22:41.000
right after the Bobby Blackwell show at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
And if you're here live, you can chat along with our show.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
And we read some of the comments here, including folks agreeing with Dark Soccer,

22:47.000 --> 22:52.000
including ActDeft, who says Resident Evil 2 deserves the praise. It was a really well done remake.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
And Quest Buster says, I enjoyed the shit out of the Resident Evil 2 remake also.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
The speedruns for Resident Evil 2 are really fun to watch.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Okay.

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
Alright, so a lot of love for Resident Evil 2. I guess at some point I'll have to get around to playing the remake.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
You know, you all know how I am with the gory games, but I remember playing the original on PlayStation.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
It's not that gross.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
Yeah, it's not that gross. So I'll deal with it.

23:14.000 --> 23:19.000
Alright, my number two pick in the meantime, though, I'm going to go with an indie pick as well.

23:19.000 --> 23:26.000
And this is just one of those games that is just style, style, style, and the music was stellar, stellar, stellar.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
And I love the presentation. It was kind of a short, simple game.

23:30.000 --> 23:36.000
But y'all know I love the games that are just art and simple and a hell of a lot of fun.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
And that's why I would say Sayonara Wild Hearts is my number two game of the year.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
That's a good one.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Yeah.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
I really enjoyed it.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
I loved it. And the soundtrack is great. I can listen along to it in the car.

23:46.000 --> 23:52.000
The gameplay is simple, yet there is so much to pursue in the name of perfection.

23:52.000 --> 24:00.000
Certainly my music gaming roots have a lot to do with that, even though I wouldn't necessarily call Sayonara Wild Hearts a music game.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
It feels a little more like elements as elements.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Exactly.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
I say it's more like I think I've always called it.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
It's the Sonic two bonus level as a game.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
It's like kind of racing, kind of not.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
So but that's I've really been enjoying it on Apple Arcade.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
Yeah, I've done most of my play on the switch.

24:15.000 --> 24:20.000
But I can totally see how this game would work easy on phones because it is basically just motion.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
I'm sure you can just drag and then tap or something because it's just motion and a button.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
That's pretty much how it is.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Yeah, exactly.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Act F in chat says I need to pick up Sayonara Wild Hearts.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
It's on sale this week on the switch.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
So, yeah, I think the sale's a good time to pick up the game.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
So there you go.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
All right.

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
That leaves us with the best around number one game of the year.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Loki, your game of the year.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
My number one pick of the year, I guess, is going to be Borderlands three.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Are we on number one already?

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Yeah.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
I thought we were on number two.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
No, you just did Resident Evil 2.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
No, you did Resident Evil 2.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
That was my number two.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
OK.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
No, that's all right.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
All right.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Number one is Borderlands 3.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Oh, OK.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Because it's more Borderlands.

25:01.000 --> 25:07.000
You don't think now I've heard some people got a little tired of the formula this time around, but not for you.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
No, it's still fine.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
I haven't played through the DLC stuff yet, but it's all right.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Yeah, it's it.

25:14.000 --> 25:21.000
You know, it's not as exciting as the first game when you first get into it, because we've done this a few times now.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
But it's still all right.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
It's still enjoyable.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Yeah.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
All right.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
So there's going to they're going to still continue to support that with more DLC expansions.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Yeah.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
Like three more pieces of DLC outer two or three.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Not even close to the end.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Some at some point I'll have to jump into it.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
But I never finished Borderlands one.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
But I did kind of like get more into Borderlands one.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
And, you know, I played I put.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
Yeah, I probably dropped like at least 15 hours in that game, if not more.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
So, yeah, I have a lot of fun with that series.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
So.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
All right. Cool.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Borderlands three.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
I guess I I don't know why I didn't even think of that for you, but makes sense.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
You're number one pick game of the year.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Cool.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
All right.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Dark soccer.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
It's all about you.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Number one.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
First blood stained.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Whoo.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
OK.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Bloodstained was beautiful.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
It was my my Symphony of the Night wet dream.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
It was challenging.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
It was in depth.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
I had so many things in it now with the new game.

26:20.000 --> 26:27.000
Plus is pretty fun to go back and grab things that we didn't have and start off the game ridiculously overpowered.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Absolutely beautiful.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
The voice acting was great.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
I really can't stand up good about it.

26:33.000 --> 26:39.000
The PS4 to me, after having seen the other ones in motion, is the definitive one to play.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
I think is the most balanced.

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
And definitely it was well worth the wait.

26:45.000 --> 26:52.000
Although I will say, if you have an Xbox Game Pass PC or I think Xbox one, you can grab it.

26:52.000 --> 26:57.000
So like, you know, there's not a lot stopping you and jumping in and enjoying the game as well.

26:57.000 --> 27:02.000
And I know you're not alone in that because, well, for one, our chat rooms lighten up quite a bit.

27:02.000 --> 27:07.000
But also I've met other people that think Bloodstained is just like the best thing they've absolutely played all year.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
And yeah, I enjoyed it.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
I really had a great time with it.

27:11.000 --> 27:22.000
And the thing for me is that it really did just hit that thing I was missing in some of those other Castlevania games that followed the formula.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
This really had the touch back to it.

27:24.000 --> 27:32.000
And of course, you know, some of the character nods back to the I love the portraits of the developers in the background that will just attack you.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
I love that.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
And I love the one where because I figured those were Kickstarter rewards.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
So most of those are like actual people.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
But one of them is a cat.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
And I love that.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
I love the giant cats.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
I wish I'd paid for Mr.

27:45.000 --> 27:51.000
Smoosh to be one of the paintings in that maybe if they do a Bloodstained 2 and they offer portrait awards.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
I'll try to I'll try to get some money together and get a portrait of Mr.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
Smoosh.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
I want them to bring back my guy, though.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Zungotsu.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Because he was my guy.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Did you get that far?

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
No, I didn't get that far.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
OK.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Yeah.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
So.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Spoilers.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
All right.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
That's all right.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
That's right.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
All right.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
So Bloodstained game of the year.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
It's from a girl that probably enjoyed Castlevania Symphony the night.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
Even Rondo of blood than most people.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Which is a lot.

28:17.000 --> 28:22.000
Did I tell you that that was that Dan sat me down when I first moved out here.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Put the game in front of me.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
I said, you're fucking playing this.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
And this is like the determining factor of our relationship.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
Wasn't it something like I'm not going to date anyone who can't beat this game or something like that.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
Something like that.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
Yeah.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
And I beat it several times over.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
I loved it.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
I found like boundary breaks for it.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
It was fun.

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
And then then just to prove my love to him.

28:45.000 --> 28:50.000
I beat Strider on Genesis.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
Love it.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
Yeah.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Better relationships through video games.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
All right.

28:55.000 --> 29:00.000
This is going to be interesting because this is the first year where we're going to have zero overlap on any of our list.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
Because my number one is not from your list and it's not from your list.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
It's different.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
I thought you would pick this dark soccer.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
I'm kind of surprised.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
Honk.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
But that's no it's actually not.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
It's not honk.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
I I'll talk about honk.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
I finally played that game in this last week too.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
I'll talk about that later.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
No.

29:19.000 --> 29:24.000
My number one pick is a game that I don't think everybody would put as their number one pick.

29:24.000 --> 29:29.000
Especially if you read a lot of social media because some people really weren't fans of this game.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
But I think they're hating on it for the wrong reasons.

29:32.000 --> 29:39.000
And if you actually sit down and you play this game and you see some of the improvements that they've made with this really long running franchise.

29:39.000 --> 29:49.000
You're going to see that they've really put a full tank of gas into something that was you know kind of for me anyway running on low fumes with some of the most recent releases.

29:49.000 --> 29:55.000
Obviously I'm talking about Pokemon Sword and Shield and that is my absolute top game of the year.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
I think I think what they've done with the series is amazing.

29:58.000 --> 30:04.000
I think the raids have been transformative for how you can get through the game and it doesn't like feel like grinding so much.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
And yes we'll talk about the Pokemon Direct later in the show.

30:07.000 --> 30:15.000
And yes I think it's really exciting news for the series and I'm just I'm just a fan.

30:15.000 --> 30:22.000
And the fact that I've probably bought almost every Pokemon generation at least one game at some point.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Maybe not in like gens 2 and 3.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
I might skip some of the early gens.

30:26.000 --> 30:31.000
But like the fact that I've probably bought a Pokemon game but never been motivated to really play it through to completion.

30:31.000 --> 30:36.000
But this time I did and I did relatively quickly.

30:36.000 --> 30:46.000
Not not not saying like it didn't take me long to beat but just saying like I sat down and I focused and I was like I will beat this game because I am having a good time playing it.

30:46.000 --> 30:55.000
I think speaks volumes and I think is why it's my game of the year and it's it's I think going to continue to carry legs long in the next year as well.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
So I'm really excited about that.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
That is for sure.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
So act deft in chat saying Rob I love you.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
Thank you.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Sword and Shield did a lot of things right.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
That the bad gets like really overshadowed sword and shield are so enjoyable.

31:08.000 --> 31:13.000
Well you know what for all the national Dexter's where you want to call it on Twitter.

31:13.000 --> 31:22.000
Like if they can just get past that little bit of salt that they have and actually sit down and spend some time with the game like actually play it.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
I think the proof is right there.

31:25.000 --> 31:31.000
I think some of the changes they've made go a long way in what they're trying to do.

31:31.000 --> 31:36.000
I'll say this is the first Pokemon game I really enjoyed playing on a console.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
At the same time it wasn't enough to make it my number one.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
It's fun.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
It's enjoyable.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
It's great.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
The play is solid.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
It really has improved.

31:46.000 --> 31:53.000
It just isn't compelling enough story wise to put it over the top for me because I am about the story.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
I understand.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
And like 80 percent of those things you just said would be me with Bloodstained.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
Like I liked it.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
I don't know if it's my top three but I liked it.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
Yeah.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
So I get it.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
I get it.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
So yeah.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
And it's not it's not perfect.

32:04.000 --> 32:09.000
Like it does have some technical issues especially when you're connected online which have to do with lol Nintendo online.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
But dammit I think this is the best Pokemon has ever been.

32:12.000 --> 32:22.000
And yeah in part I'm putting it number one on my list to kind of make a point that like I think a lot of people on social media are getting it very very well.

32:22.000 --> 32:31.000
But the good news is it doesn't matter the loud stuff on social media for people who probably haven't bothered to play it because the game is selling cuckoo bananas very well.

32:31.000 --> 32:36.000
So I hope that's the type of thing that the Game Freak team and the folks behind are looking at.

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
And sometimes you just have to kind of just not check your mentions on Twitter.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
And I think that's probably best for those guys.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
So anyway there it is.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
So our top games of the year.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
There they are.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
So what do we have.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
What do we have.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
We had Minecraft Earth.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
What the golf.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Borderlands 3.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
Right.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Then we had Death Stranding.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Resident Evil 2.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Resident Evil 2.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
Bloodstained.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Bloodstained.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
And then I think my list has been more conventional.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Yeah.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
Which is odd but whatever.

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
Final Fantasy 14 Shadowbringers expansion.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
Sayonara Wild Hearts and Pokemon Shield I guess if you have to pick one.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
But you know what I mean.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
I would like to offer some honorable mentions.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
I think the Untitled Goose Game was great.

33:17.000 --> 33:22.000
I also liked Patterned on Apple Arcade and Tint.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
I loved what the golf.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.000
Sayonara Wild Hearts is definitely a fun one for me.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
I just.

33:31.000 --> 33:41.000
I didn't bring up any of the iOS stuff just because I would be here all day naming things on Apple Arcade that I have intensely enjoyed playing.

33:42.000 --> 33:48.000
And they released more stuff for Patterned so that's kind of like my solitaire I guess because I love puzzles.

33:48.000 --> 33:54.000
And I like artwork and I like being able to see how the art fits together so those are some honorable mentions for me.

33:54.000 --> 33:59.000
Biggest honorable mention for me that wasn't named anywhere else was Zelda Link's Awakening.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
I thought the you know the redo version.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Oh yeah it was really good too.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
I don't know why I didn't think about it.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
I know I know right.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
So it was just it was it was great though.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
It was a very solid game.

34:07.000 --> 34:13.000
I guess I'd mention even though I don't really get to play much of it other than see what my children put together but Mario maker too.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
And absolutely something that's worthy of the list as well.

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
So especially I just don't get to play my Switch anymore unfortunately.

34:20.000 --> 34:27.000
So that's why I don't have any of those games like Zelda which I do own but haven't been able to play.

34:27.000 --> 34:32.000
And and even like this was a Breath of the Wild.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
I bought that this year too.

34:34.000 --> 34:40.000
Can't play it though because my kids take the thing and then my wife wants me to watch TV at night.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
So you know that's OK.

34:43.000 --> 34:49.000
You can always get the Switch Pro and then give the old Switch to your kids even though no because it's all digital.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
And it tells I don't know how to make accounts work with other switches.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
I love it.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
All right.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
Cool our top games of the year.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
There they are.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
So guess what.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
Now is the point.

35:00.000 --> 35:06.000
Now this is it like a new OLR tradition is that we talk about a lot of stuff on this show.

35:06.000 --> 35:11.000
In fact sometimes it's hard to remember the things that we even discuss from week to week here on this very program.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
Let alone the crazy people again.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
What's up.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
Who are you people again.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
I don't know.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
I don't know how to get this house.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
I'm kidnapping me.

35:19.000 --> 35:24.000
So what we did starting a couple years ago we started putting together a time capsule.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
And you know gaming changes a lot in a year.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Like look at this year.

35:29.000 --> 35:35.000
We're going to have at least three four four new consoles coming out in the next year.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
I'm counting the Atari VCS which maybe I shouldn't be.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
No.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
And also the Intellivision Amico.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
I can.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
I can.

35:43.000 --> 35:52.000
But then of course the PlayStation 5 the Xbox Series X grab a hell and maybe something from Nintendo all that that would still be still be you know theory theorizing at this point.

35:52.000 --> 35:58.000
So you know not only we have new consoles but the point is the way things look like in a year not going to be the way they look like today.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
And that is like always true in gaming.

36:00.000 --> 36:06.000
So it's it's going to be really fun to look back and see what crazy shit did we think.

36:06.000 --> 36:13.000
What do we think we're going to find in here because I think this is probably loaded with shit that says like how did Animal Crossing turn out.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
Did Jamie quit the show because she's playing Animal Crossing full time.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
That's which the gag is of course.

36:20.000 --> 36:25.000
But I can't remember if I did this last year the year before last if we did that.

36:25.000 --> 36:31.000
But I believe that the year prior stuff is also in there because they had shoved those also.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
Why did we put two years with this because it's not going to.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
Nothing changes.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
That's why God.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
All right.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
Dark soccer anything you want to say before I open this and run through it because apparently there's a ton of stuff in here.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
OK.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
We're going to make a little.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Which was appropriate is the Darth Vader cup.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
I don't also put candy in there to be like oh candy.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
Is there candy in here.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
No but that'd be cool though like because we'll forget it next year.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Oh candy.

36:54.000 --> 36:58.000
First piece of paper says anticipated games.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Number one Animal Crossing.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
This is my handwriting.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
Number two Metroid Prime 4.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
That didn't happen either.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
Well you were anticipating it was anticipating it.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
Number three Harry Potter wizards unite.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
I forgot all about that.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
That's not all right.

37:14.000 --> 37:18.000
I mean it just kind of got lost in the GPS game shuffle but it was all right.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
And then number four Pokemon Gen 8.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Hey I got that one.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
I got that one.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
All right.

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
Next up.

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
O.L.R. may earn enough money for bus tickets to PAX.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
I will say this.

37:34.000 --> 37:41.000
Thanks to you guys being very generous with the biddies and the subs and our move to Twitch and all that good stuff.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
We probably.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
Bus tickets.

37:43.000 --> 37:47.000
Yeah we probably made enough to buy bus tickets to PAX.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
We'll come back from PAX though.

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
Well when I say we I'm also counting Bobby Black Wolf and everything else at VoG.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
But I.

37:55.000 --> 37:59.000
Yeah I mean just a big thank you to everybody that does that stuff because it does count.

37:59.000 --> 38:06.000
Most of that money has really gone into paying for the cost of running a legitimate business because believe it or not that stuff is expensive.

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
And you know we have like you know legal things and document filing and all that stuff.

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
But I mean the fact is that doesn't come out of our pockets anymore.

38:14.000 --> 38:19.000
Which is a great feeling because you know I was paying for that old radio feed and now we don't have to anymore.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
So that's really cool.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
So anyway.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
Next up.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
God I wrote a lot.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
What the fuck.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
I just.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
Oh chat predictions.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
Oh God.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
A whole thing about chat predictions.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
Oh.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
Oh y'all ready to turn the tables because I see some of your names on this.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
OK.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
Here we go.

38:39.000 --> 38:44.000
This is She-Hulk projected a portable Xbox.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
But the cloud.

38:46.000 --> 38:51.000
So like it's easy to say oh you got that one wrong She-Hulk but maybe I would say only half.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Yeah there's X cloud.

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
There's X cloud and that is going to make Xbox portable.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
So I'm going to give She-Hulk partial credit.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
So you get half of Miss Cleo award for that.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
All right.

39:02.000 --> 39:07.000
ActDeft put Pokemon 8th gen delay.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
No cookie for you.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
It didn't get delayed.

39:09.000 --> 39:14.000
Bobby put Microsoft stops at most audio.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
I don't even know if that was a thing that happened.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Did they.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
I don't even know.

39:18.000 --> 39:24.000
I know he was having problems with his home theater and that's probably where this comment came from.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
But that's what he had said.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
Sia Tabiri said new Mario spin off.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
I don't think we got one of those either.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
It didn't happen really.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
You'd have to really dig.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
I don't know.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
I don't think that happened.

39:37.000 --> 39:44.000
VidPower said established game battle royale spin off.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Well they've had several of those.

39:46.000 --> 39:51.000
They were really spin offs but like you could say Forza Horizon has battle royale mode.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
Tetris 99.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
Tetris 99.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
That was last year though.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
No it wasn't in 2019.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
That was 2019.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
That was 2019.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Was it?

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
2019 releases.

40:00.000 --> 40:07.000
So yeah actually I'm going to give that to VidPower because Tetris having a battle royale spin off.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
Ding ding ding.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Fallout 76 did it.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Call of Duty did it.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
Yeah.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Oh everybody did it.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
All right.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Pop Culture said Dreamcast classic.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
Oh how I would love for you to be right but you're wrong.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
We just have to wait longer for that.

40:21.000 --> 40:26.000
And Fifth Dream said Final Fantasy 7 remake cancelled.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Whoops at you.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
Okay.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
All right.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
Moving on.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
Moving on.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Oh this is a big one.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Here it is.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
N64 classic released holiday 2019.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
Nope.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
Nope.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
That didn't happen.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
That didn't happen.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
Let's see.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
Next one.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Detective Pikachu movie didn't suck.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
Ding ding ding.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
That is true.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
That is true.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
Absolutely didn't suck.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
That's your handwriting right?

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
That is probably my handwriting yes.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
Loki's handwriting.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Detective Pikachu didn't suck.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
It was.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
It was great.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.500
It was pretty damn good actually as far as video game movies go and gonna get a sequel

41:02.500 --> 41:04.000
and I don't think we hate it.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
So cool.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
All right.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
My handwriting.

41:09.000 --> 41:14.760
Did they finally get online right with Animal Crossing since they plan to charge for it.

41:14.760 --> 41:15.760
Don't know yet.

41:15.760 --> 41:16.760
Ask in three months Rob.

41:16.760 --> 41:17.760
All right.

41:17.760 --> 41:23.000
I told you it was gonna be nothing but Animal Crossing shit in here.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Loki's handwriting.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
New AR gaming console.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
No.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
No.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
No.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
No.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
You should have went with cloud.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
Would have got that.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
But yeah.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Cloud sucks.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
All right.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
Next up.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
My handwriting.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
Next.

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
Next Xbox announced but no PS5.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
What was I thinking.

41:46.000 --> 41:50.000
Game pass console to hold us over.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
Nah.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
Oh.

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
I was thinking there was gonna be a console like dedicated to like digital.

41:56.000 --> 42:03.000
I think I was thinking something even smaller than that Xbox One X or whatever.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
What the hell was on the digital.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
The digital only.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
The digital only one.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
I was thinking a smaller more bare bones version of that.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
Yeah.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
Yes.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
The Xbox sad.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
Thank you.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
Oh.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
Right.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
As far as I'm like where the hell's dark soccer's handwriting.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
I think this is it.

42:21.000 --> 42:27.000
Amazon's new streaming game service will not overcome steam or the console market.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
Well.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Amazon has a streaming game service.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
That is true.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
All right.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
Next up.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
I know I remember something about that being in the news.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
Well I think that this just hasn't happened yet.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Replace it with stadium.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
It's still true.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
This is my handwriting.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
Tiger claw.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Let's you guys are going to scream.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
You ready.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
Tiger call is not.

42:50.000 --> 43:07.000
The sonic movie was a bad idea right.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Yes as it turns out.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
But yes it's not as bad of an idea as well.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
So far it's.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
It's weird.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
It's we're not quite sure yet how bad it is.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
This is why we do the time capsule.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
That was fucking great.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
All right.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
Now what.

43:25.000 --> 43:30.000
But but what really comes to that remains to be seen because.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
Theoretic I think we knew the release date was going to be this year.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
It was last year but now it's in 2020.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
So that's really funny.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
All right.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
Moving on.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
I don't know who wrote this.

43:43.000 --> 43:47.000
I think this is dark soccer's handwriting with her safest prediction ever.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Still no Half-Life 3.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
Well sort of.

43:52.000 --> 43:56.000
Well there's a new Half-Life game.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
You thought it would be an easy prediction.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
Turns out it's a little complicated.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Loki's handwriting.

44:03.000 --> 44:09.000
EA will close BioWare after Anthem underperforms due to EA shittiness.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
IE loot boxes.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
I would say you're like three fourths right.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
There's just one component of this prediction missing.

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
So it should be in the capsule for next year.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
We're going to put this back in.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
Yes there's things I'm going to put.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
Let's keep like a pile of things to put back in the capsule.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
Still no Half-Life 3.

44:27.000 --> 44:32.000
Where was the one about Animal Crossing.

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
Because the one about Animal Crossing needs to go back in as well.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
Where is it.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Online with Animal Crossing.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Yeah something about online with Animal Crossing.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
I can't find it.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
Gosh darn it.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
Eh who cares.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Wait wait wait wait wait.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
No.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
Alright.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
Never mind.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
I'll worry about it later.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
Maybe it fell on the floor when I got up earlier.

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
Okay.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
Next up.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
I don't think the year before are in here because we're almost out.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Maybe that was the year before last.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
Loki wrote anticipated games.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
Crackdown 3.

45:04.000 --> 45:08.000
Yeah I anticipated it then I played it and then.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
That was too bad.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
Animal Crossing Switch.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
I told you that's going to be everywhere.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
Borderlands 3.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
Yeah that was good.

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
It's like everybody's like last thing they wrote down was the accurate one.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
So.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
Alright.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
Let's see.

45:23.000 --> 45:31.000
I think this is Jamie's writing.

45:31.000 --> 45:36.000
Nintendo freaks out and goes back to friend codes for all the things.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
I don't think they did.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
I'm trying to think if something's close.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
I don't know.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
I don't think so because they've actually kind of integrated Facebook and Twitter if

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
you pay for the online thing.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
So don't think that one panned out.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
There's only one more in here.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
It must have been last year that I did that.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
Alright here it is.

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
The last one.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
Ooh.

45:58.000 --> 46:03.000
Did Sony do a PlayStation event in the fall because of no E3?

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
They did not.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
No they didn't.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
But that actually.

46:06.000 --> 46:11.000
Let's take that and lead this into a side topic because I don't think it comes up in

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
our news anywhere else.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
But there's.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
It's probably because it's the giant rumor category.

46:15.000 --> 46:19.000
But this is one of those rumors that Michael Patcher has chimed in on.

46:19.000 --> 46:23.000
And the rumor is that Sony plans to skip this year's E3 as well.

46:23.000 --> 46:27.000
Meaning that they would not be showing PlayStation 5 at E3 this year.

46:27.000 --> 46:31.000
How do you guys feel about that if Sony were to skip E3 this year as well?

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
They'll do their own event.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
I mean that sucks for E3.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
But you know they would do their own event.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
And I don't know if that's a good.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
You know as much as like they may not have stuff to.

46:43.000 --> 46:48.000
I would hope that they'd have something to show because it's just going to be the Microsoft

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
show then if you know they decide that they're not going to go to E3.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
It'll just be like.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
Well Nintendo could.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
Well right.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
But like I mean that's.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
I don't know.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
I don't know what benefit they would have for skipping.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
Unless they really don't have stuff to show.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
Which is not good I guess.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Especially considering that we're going to be.

47:10.000 --> 47:14.000
You know expecting a new console at the end of this year and that's going to get delayed.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
Who knows.

47:15.000 --> 47:19.000
Boy that's a real kick in the pants to E3 and the ESA though.

47:19.000 --> 47:23.000
But you know throughout the discussion on Twitter about the topic.

47:23.000 --> 47:27.000
One thing that somebody I follow said that I remembered oh this is very true.

47:27.000 --> 47:32.000
Do you guys remember that the ESA had all those leaks of people's personal information

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
when it came to the media.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
Yeah.

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
Do you remember that.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
What did the ESA say they were going to do about that.

47:38.000 --> 47:43.000
I don't remember them saying anything that would be correct.

47:43.000 --> 47:48.000
So there's still that whole thing is that this is still an issue that's gone unaddressed

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
and that's not good.

47:50.000 --> 47:55.000
And maybe maybe this could sound really harsh and I don't mean to sound like one of those

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
like shitlords on Twitter.

47:56.000 --> 48:02.000
But maybe the ESA deserves to fail.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
I put it out there.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
Can't take it back.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Like maybe that they're just a lobbying group.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
What are they really doing.

48:08.000 --> 48:13.000
Aside from they have the they're they're looking out for the publishers like the big triple

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
A publishers.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
They're not looking out for the consumers at all.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
They're just like protecting the people that are paying.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
They're keeping them afloat.

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
Is the publishers so.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
Yeah.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
I don't know.

48:25.000 --> 48:29.000
In the past you know we may have seen them as like oh hey you know they're combat.

48:29.000 --> 48:34.000
They're going against you know the laws that you're trying to ban violent video games and

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
stuff like that.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
So that's kind of good.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
But at the same time they were still just protecting the publishers.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
They're not.

48:40.000 --> 48:46.000
There's you know we need kind of a consumer advocate group that's kind of in the gaming

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
space I think.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
And I don't think that's the ESA.

48:50.000 --> 48:55.000
One of the other rumors out there is that they're trying to bring in Jeff Kealy to basically

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
save E3.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
But I mean he's already kind of involved.

48:58.000 --> 49:02.000
So that isn't necessarily like how is he going to save E3.

49:02.000 --> 49:06.000
They are looking to him to basically design a show kind of like he does his award show

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
basically not saying that E3 is going to suddenly become an award show but basically give him

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
a lot more creative control him and his team I guess because you know only one man can

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
only do so much.

49:14.000 --> 49:19.000
But you know get put more creative input from him basically.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
I don't know.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
I'm just not sure.

49:21.000 --> 49:26.000
I mean hey that's not the show that I mean that's not what that show is supposed to be

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
about.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
Yeah I know.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
I know.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
But my how times have changed.

49:30.000 --> 49:34.000
But you know the fact that the issues from last year still are going unaddressed and

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
so forth.

49:35.000 --> 49:40.000
I think E3 is if it does come out that Sony is not going to bother to go to the show and

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
they're doing their own thing.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
I mean sure.

49:43.000 --> 49:48.000
There still will be an E3 2020 and Microsoft it's going to be free.

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
Well it's not really going to be free but it's going to be you know Microsoft's you

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
know free realm to do things.

49:53.000 --> 49:58.000
But if Sony does their own show if they do a PlayStation event they're going to get tons

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
of media coverage.

49:59.000 --> 50:03.000
They can invite all the people they need to invite to their own show.

50:03.000 --> 50:10.000
I don't know it's going to be some colossal ego energy in a way but I kind of think it

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
would pay off for them.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
So we'll see.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
I don't know.

50:13.000 --> 50:18.000
That's what a lot of companies do in the tech space nowadays anyway so I wouldn't be surprised

50:18.000 --> 50:22.000
if all of this E3 stuff goes away at some point.

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
Bobby Black Wolf does want to point out kind of like a little difference here.

50:25.000 --> 50:30.000
Loki and what you were saying a minute ago is that the ESA they're a lobbying group for

50:30.000 --> 50:33.000
the AAA publishers and put on a trade show.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
That's all they do.

50:35.000 --> 50:41.000
We have the ECA Entertainment Consumer Association which is the lobbying group for our behalf.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
They owned game politics dot com.

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
So a little difference between the two side of things.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
Game politics?

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Didn't that go away?

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
No.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Well he says owned in past tense.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
Oh yeah.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
So I missed that site.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
I freaking loved game politics.

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
We need something like that back.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
Yeah.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
So.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
All right.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
Well let's move on.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
We have a trip down memory lane in our time capsule.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Let's talk a little bit about our gaming.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Now I'm throwing the rest of these in the trash.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Are we going to do a new one of these?

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Yes we will do a new one of these.

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
We're running a little long tonight and I already kind of warned everybody before the

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
show.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
So we'll probably fill this up.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.000
So what we'll do we're going to just come to the show next week with things already

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
written out.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
Week after next?

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
Or yes.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
Oh yeah.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
So housekeeping note.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
Hello.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
There is no show next week.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
No live show.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
Well there's not going to be any show actually.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
He's not going to tape anything either.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
You will be out.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
He will be out.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Literally nobody will be here in Sacramento.

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
Well I'll be in Sacramento but nowhere near the studio.

51:38.000 --> 51:42.000
Well and I will be at the women's march in San Francisco.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
I will be in face.

51:43.000 --> 51:47.000
So if you want to look for Sister Hava which is me.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
I will be out there with the San Francisco sisters.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Come say hi and march with us.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
I'll be driving to Disneyland.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Broccoli farm.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
I wanted to make those t-shirts.

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
Someday.

51:59.000 --> 52:05.000
Next Sunday is Alan and I's third wedding anniversary on the 19th but we're actually

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
also celebrating 10 years together.

52:07.000 --> 52:12.000
So we just passed 10 years as boyfriends or whatever you want to call it was January

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
4th.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
Dan and I do that.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Do you know that mine and Dan's 21st.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
Wow.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
Will be.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Is it 21st or 22nd?

52:20.000 --> 52:24.000
I really can't brain but it will be the 23rd of this month.

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
Yeah.

52:25.000 --> 52:29.000
Which means roughly half of my life has been lived in California.

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
Well we're very lucky to have you.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
So yeah.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Alan and I are going to see a play.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
So we're going to get our musical.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
We're going to see Dear Evan Hansen because it's touring.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
It's going to be here.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
So we're doing that that night.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
Maybe a nice dinner or something.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
So yeah.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
Just everybody's going to be gone.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Bobby Black Wolf will be holding down the fort here at Twitch.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
So for those of you I mean you guys can still tune in.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
Bobby will probably maybe run a little longer than usual.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Maybe that'll be the week you can finally get Tommy on his show.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
And you can run really long.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
We'll see.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
But yeah.

52:56.000 --> 53:00.000
So VOG will still be on next week just we will not be here next week.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
So we'll be back in two weeks.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
And at that time we will fill the time capsule with new predictions.

53:05.000 --> 53:09.000
We can have it all written out already so we're not spending time writing.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Because that took forever the last time we did this.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
I remember that.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
So.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
All right.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
So there you go.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
There's the time capsule.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Now it's time to throw these in the garbage.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
All right.

53:19.000 --> 53:23.000
Let's move on to our gaming weeks and talk about the types of games that we have been

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
playing this week.

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
Dark Soccer.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
How was your gaming week?

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
Well minimal given everything else we've been going through.

53:30.000 --> 53:34.000
But Dan and I did watch as much of AGDQ as we could.

53:34.000 --> 53:38.000
I was a little sad they didn't make Pi Million.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Which was the last goal.

53:40.000 --> 53:44.000
But still it was great seeing everything that all of those amazing runners did.

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
I loved the Impossible Super Metroid run.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
That was amazing.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
What's the Impossible Super Metroid run?

53:50.000 --> 53:54.000
It's a mod of Super Metroid that's even harder with some of the things moved around.

53:54.000 --> 53:58.000
You don't get the Varia suit until after you beat Ridley.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
For example.

53:59.000 --> 54:05.000
Mother Brain in each aspect of each of the different segments takes anywhere between

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
100 to 150 shots.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
So it's pretty crazy.

54:10.000 --> 54:16.000
It was a really difficult run to watch but really amazing how tight this guy was in playing.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
Oats and Goats was the runner.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
Really amazing.

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
Do they have a Kaizo Super Metroid?

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
Because that would be hilarious.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
This is kind of I think Kaizo Super Metroid.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
It's really freaking hard.

54:29.000 --> 54:34.000
But as far as what I played I did a little bit more of What the Golf.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
I freaking love it on iOS.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
It's so easy to play.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
I mean and frustrating.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
Because the cars.

54:39.000 --> 54:42.000
The cars pissed me off so much.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
Yeah.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
And I have been playing Pokemon Go.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
I've been playing Harry Potter.

54:48.000 --> 54:54.000
I've also started playing the Rilakkuma farming game thanks to my friend Mari.

54:54.000 --> 55:00.000
It's basically just one of those stupid little farm sim games but with Rilakkuma instead.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
What else was I playing?

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
I'm also still playing Patterned.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
It's just so relaxing to me.

55:07.000 --> 55:12.000
It's one of the games that I'll have the music on when I'm playing it at home.

55:12.000 --> 55:17.000
And I've got the Mac version and iOS version because I'm doing it through Apple Arcade.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
But thankfully my levels don't cross over for that game.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
So I can keep doing.

55:22.000 --> 55:27.000
And the levels play a little bit differently on a computer versus how they play on iPhone.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
I've been vastly enjoying Patterned.

55:29.000 --> 55:37.000
It's been my little moment of zen while I've been so overwhelmed with all the crazytude in the house.

55:38.000 --> 55:44.000
And I've also been playing a lot of Animal Crossing Pocket Camp just because

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Oh my god I want my Animal Crossing!

55:46.000 --> 55:52.000
Dan and I talked about getting a Switch Lite for me so we don't have to take my Switch out of the house.

55:52.000 --> 55:58.000
So I can play and he's like, well I'm sure there's going to be an Animal Crossing edition of the Switch Lite and blah blah blah.

55:58.000 --> 56:02.000
I'm like, you realize that this is the month.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
It's had me out the month before my birthday.

56:04.000 --> 56:07.000
And this is going to probably be my birthday present.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
So yes, all the things yes.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Other than that though, it's just really my usual.

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
I haven't had a thought to play anything else.

56:19.000 --> 56:24.000
Because instead of playing our systems at home, we were watching AGDQ.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
The Super Metroid front was freaking amazing though.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Yeah, I saw a little bit of that. Just a little bit though.

56:31.000 --> 56:32.000
By the way.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
Honk!

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
It was all Orna.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
That's basically it. I played Orna.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
What level are you now?

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
I'm 100.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
Oh wow, look at you.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Yeah, so two weeks.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Took two while I get there.

56:47.000 --> 56:51.000
And now I have to figure out what specialization I'm going to pick now.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Because I have that option.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
But it costs too much.

56:56.000 --> 57:00.000
So yeah, now I assume it's going to be much slower.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
Because now they've unlocked a whole new set of enemies I have to fight.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
That are way more powerful than I am now.

57:05.000 --> 57:10.000
Whereas everything I was just trashing everything in my path up until 100.

57:10.000 --> 57:15.000
And you have to really walk to find stuff too.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Like that's what happens as you kill things.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Then they respawn with other mobs.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
They're usually more powerful than you.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
And so you really have to walk to get new stuff to spawn.

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
I've been kind of doing that stuff as well.

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
I've been trying to do the daily quest things that they have.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
But it can be hard sometimes.

57:32.000 --> 57:37.000
Especially when it seems like the mobs that they want you to kill don't spawn as often on those days.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
So I've been trying to do that.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
And even just the basic stuff.

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
Like the main storyline quests that they have that you do.

57:44.000 --> 57:49.000
Because it's like, okay, you need to kill hobgoblins.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Well cool, I've killed millions of hobgoblins.

57:51.000 --> 57:56.000
Except they're hobgoblin mages, hobgoblin knights, hobgoblin this.

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
And it's not just plain old hobgoblins.

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
You have to specifically kill that.

58:02.000 --> 58:10.000
And so I'm level 100 and I'm still not even done with these tutorial missions or whatever.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
I don't know, I've been doing a lot of the arena stuff.

58:14.000 --> 58:19.000
Because arenas you get about 45,000 experience each thing you fight.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
And they're pretty easy.

58:21.000 --> 58:25.000
So I've been just doing those and burning through those as quickly as I can.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Yeah, so that's been my week basically.

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
I get murdered in those, my gear's not good enough or something.

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
And I've been trying to use, that's why I finally built a blacksmith here.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
So I can just deposit.

58:37.000 --> 58:40.000
In fact I put stuff in before the show started tonight that'll be done by the time the show's over.

58:40.000 --> 58:43.000
Yeah, I do that each night when I go to bed.

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
Drop stuff off and then pick up my dry cleaning in the morning.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Yeah, exactly.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Alright, lots of orna.

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
Let's see, my gaming week.

58:51.000 --> 58:55.000
I've been playing a little bit of Pokemon Sword and Shield because of some of the news that came out this week.

58:55.000 --> 59:00.000
For the first time I finally, finally, finally got around to playing Untitled Goose Game.

59:00.000 --> 59:04.000
I'm going to admit I didn't get into it as much as the rest of you have.

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
And sorry if I come off like sounding like a hater, but I don't know.

59:07.000 --> 59:10.000
Well I want to put something into context too because this is very important.

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
It would help you understand maybe why I'm just like, I was very like kind of,

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
I don't get it as much as like everybody else.

59:16.000 --> 59:24.000
Alan and I, after the show last week, we ate something that gave us the most horrific food poisoning

59:24.000 --> 59:29.000
I have ever had in my entire life in the middle of the day on Monday.

59:29.000 --> 59:34.000
So we were sick Monday night, Tuesday, like it was so bad.

59:34.000 --> 59:40.000
I actually called my health provider to be like, do I need to come to the hospital because,

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
or actually Alan had to call them because I couldn't form coherent sentences.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
It was that bad and he's sick.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
So it's, it was bad.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
I'm fine now.

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
Obviously I'm sitting here doing the show and snacking away on pretzels here.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
So everything's fine.

59:52.000 --> 59:55.000
But that was the worst I have ever had it.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
That was so, so horrible.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:03.000
So I think I finally played Untitled Goose Game about Wednesday when my body is finally like starting to like,

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:08.000
like stop being horrific and start to get some sense of normalcy again.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
But I just feel so like exhausted.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
But I was so bored.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
I was like, I need something to do.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:19.000
So, uh, yeah, so I, that is the context in which I finally got around to playing Untitled Goose Game.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
So to be fair, I wasn't in the best of moods.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000
So this is probably why the game didn't land super well with me, but I was just kind of like annoyed.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000
I was having such a hard time figuring out how to solve some of the very first puzzles,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
which I would assume are supposed to be some of the easiest stuff.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000
So I was just, you know, getting annoyed with it really easy.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
So that was it.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000
I mean, I get, I get why though it is, it's a very different type of game.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
You know, you don't see that type of thing a lot.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
The goose does make a really funny mascot.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
I just like playing an asshole.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Yeah, no, I get it. I get it.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
So there is a good boundary break on that one, by the way.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Oh, is there?

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Yeah.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I'm just showing that like some of the scenes where you don't see the goose, it's still doing stuff.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:08.000
There's actually things going on in the houses and everything that, you know, it's not just effect happening.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
It's legit going on in the game.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:18.000
I tried to, so when I was trying to figure out like what, where is this particular item that I need?

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:25.000
I found a river and I swam all the way down the river and I could see all these different areas that must be like coming up in the future.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000
And finally it ended and I was able to go up onto something and that was like it,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
but it was weird that I could even get that far down the river.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
It was so strange.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000
So, but yeah, that was, that was what it was.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.000
As far as like, oh, so the chat is wondering, Swanton wants to know what did I eat?

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Here's the weird thing.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Food.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:50.000
We still kind of can't put together because Alan made spaghetti and meatballs here at home, which so obviously you blame the meatballs, right?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000
But they were those type of like prepackaged frozen ones that are pre-cooked and then he cooked them again.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
So I know it doesn't, it doesn't make a lot of sense.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:05.000
And the doctor, so I finally did talk to a doctor in urgent care because the way you and I have the same health care providers.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
So the way they work, cause I was like, can I come into urgent care?

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Can I come into urgent care?

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
And I'm like, we need to call you.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.000
I usually go to, they don't, they do not advertise very well where the urgent care is.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
I know right where mine is.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Okay.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I'm going to get the details of that.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Haven't forbid that ever happens to me again.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Well, just FYI South SAC urgent care opens at three o'clock.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
That's good.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000
And it's open every day.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Okay.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
That's good to know.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
But anyway, um, so I, uh, where was I?

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Oh, I talked to the doctor and the doctor was like, you know,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:41.000
it sounds like it might actually be viral because I don't think what you guys ate sounds like it's something that could have been capable of giving you such, you know, horrible food poisoning.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Um, so it's still, it's kind of a mystery in some ways.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Um, now we had gone to a nice brunch at a nice country club place earlier in the day with some mutual friends.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.000
And so we were kind of quick to think, Oh, those types of things, buffets are usually like prime.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
That's where it came from.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.000
But this was a really nice place and not the type of thing that's going to have code violations.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I mean, everybody makes mistakes, but none of our friends got sick.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Your reaction though, and I was thinking this earlier, just, you know, I was too kind of in stuff is definitely though, makes me think more of gastroenteritis than, um, than food poisoning because of how dehydrated you got.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Oh my gosh.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
I got so dehydrated.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
That's why my fever was so high.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000
And what I had it really bad and I had, this was when I was a kid, but I had it for about two weeks.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:41.000
I lost 20 pounds as a teenager, which is a lot when you're a teenager and was roughly in the same state that you described yourself.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.000
So I'm glad you're over it by now, but it does sound like you had maybe a 48 hour bug.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
So weird.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
So weird.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:56.000
But anyway, one thing I will say, I'm going to say this, and I know this isn't directly about games, but this is just a good life tip because this is something I learned throughout the whole ordeal.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Cause the problem was Alan and I were sick at the same time.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
So we couldn't really like help each other out a lot.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Now he, he didn't get it as bad as I did.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Um, I also eight seconds on Sunday, so I kind of blame that on everything.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:17.000
But anyway, my point is, you know, when you're super dehydrated, the best thing to do is to drink something like Gatorade, something with electrolytes, right?

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Something to kind of get all that back in your system.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Well, we don't just keep Gatorade around the house.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
So I would really advise people to do one of two things.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Have Gatorade available, put it in your pantry, like just have it in a place that that's, that shit never goes bad.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Mio, keep the squirty stuff.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Or that, or this is what I was gonna say, cause this really did the trick.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.000
They sell a, you know how like, um, not crystal light, but crystal light comes in those powder things.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000
They sell Propel in little powdered packets.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Pedial light also.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Oh, does Pedial light come in packets?

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:56.000
They have Pedial, not the powder one. It's kind of a gross like liquid thing, but it does, it's a great rehydrator.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Trust me.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Pedial light is the bomb.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
It can't be as gross as being sick.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000
So my advice to everybody, have an emergency supply of something.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Pick the brand of your choice with electrolytes.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Have an emergency supply of it on hand, just in case.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:16.000
That's especially if you live alone, especially, you know, even if you do live with a partner or something.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
There's no telling if both of you are gonna get sick at the same time.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
So anyway.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Wow, I totally got on a tangent with that.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Oh, DJ Rama S in chat says Pedial light, a must have when you're out con drinking.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I'm pretty sure Dragon Con, most people I've seen have a stock of it on hand as well.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
So it's smart to have.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
But I think even the powdered stuff, cause that's so much, you know, water's heavy.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
You can't always carry that around, but like, I'm gonna do that now.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000
When I go to Dragon Con, I'm gonna take that tiny little box of powder Propel and just keep it with me.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Like how it's, it's super easy and convenient.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
So anyway, I keep a little bottle of meal when I travel.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Yeah, I guess I didn't even think of meal, but I guess that would work too for sure.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
So perfect.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Anyway.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000
So where were we?

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Yes.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Not just cause I need a sassy gay friend.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Gaming weeks.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Hello.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000
So don't play a fun game like untitled goose game when you don't feel fun because it'll affect your opinions on it.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
But otherwise I played it way too much Final Fantasy 14.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
What else is new?

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
So let's move on.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Let's get into some gaming news finally.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Let's talk about what's been going on in the headlines.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000
And, uh, yeah, it's nice to, it's nice to be back to normal in the news cycle.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Cause the past couple of weeks have been all holidays, holidays, but here we are 2020.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Here we go.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Looking at the new consoles and what they're going to bring and all that good stuff, right Loki?

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:39.000
2020 party in like it's 2006 though, with Microsoft, a rumor at least about Microsoft's new console, the Xbox Series X.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Stating that there may be a windows mode in the console where you can actually run it like a PC, which allow you to access the steam and Epic game store platforms.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:07:05.000
So you could essentially use this like a PC in the sense that you could use the PlayStation three as a Linux machine for a brief moment in time until they decided that was an avenue for people to hack the system.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
And then, you know, we know how that went.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Um, interesting to see if this ends up being a thing, but who knows?

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
I mean, it sounds plausible, I guess.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:27.000
I would be surprised though, like if that is actually a thing, because I think that one of the things they were trying to do with like, especially the windows store is have a lot of these universal apps.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
So you'd be able to do some productivity stuff on there.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:36.000
And I would be willing to bet that like, if it's a windows mode, like, I don't know.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I just can't imagine Microsoft outlook on my Xbox.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:45.000
I just can't imagine like someone buying an Xbox Series X to do like Excel on that.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:51.000
This just who would have thought the military would have bought PlayStation threes to do some of their most intentional.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Right. But that's because of the processor that's inside of it.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000
I mean, I true it's like, God, I need a strong processor for that Excel spreadsheet.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000
You know, um, I mean, I guess I could see something like that.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Maybe they could do that.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:09.000
I just don't know. I'd be a little skeptical to see if it can run the epic game store and that kind of stuff.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000
But who knows? Maybe someone will hack it to do that.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
But I guess we'll have to wait and see.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:29.000
It would be very perceptive of Phil Spencer and the rest of the Xbox team if they've kind of noticed that, you know, when PlayStation three got rid of the other OS thing, it was not super well received by a lot of people.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:36.000
And, you know, maybe when you hear that, oh, the military was buying these machines to use and so forth for their, you know, specific needs.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.000
It would be very interesting if they've put a Windows mode into this.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
And obviously I don't see them doing any OS like Unix or whatever.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I mean, I guess anything's possible, but I just don't see it.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:54.000
But it'd be very interesting if there is a Windows boot mode for these things that you could run, you know, whether it's limited to universal Windows apps or things like that.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000
It would be very interesting if if that was something that these boxes offered.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:13.000
But I could I could see that be a more interesting prospect for things you can do with your Xbox other than the Xbox one's message of TV, TV sport or like to the sense that this Windows mode in there.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Like I know that, you know, the Xbox is now looking at this whole Xbox cloud platform and streaming.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:28.000
I know with the Xbox one X, I think a lot of that streaming, you're actually streaming games from your console to your phone.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000
So what if they see that as, hey, you know what?

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Productivity wise, we could have you stream your console to your phone.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000
But instead of playing games on there, you could be answering emails.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:45.000
You could be putting together a spreadsheet, typing up a word document or something like that.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000
So you could do some of that as well and then go to gaming.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Maybe that's something that they're thinking about doing to kind of help boost that platform, because I think maybe making some money from these live was at the.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.000
The Office 365 subscriptions or something like that might be something that they're interested in as well.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
We'll see in chat.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Bobby Black Wolf says, to be fair, the Xbox one can use just about any UWP app, which I think is universal Windows platform, right?

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Yeah.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
There are Reddit apps on the Xbox one.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
I don't even think of that.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000
I mean, technically you can run Microsoft Edge on your Xbox one.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:29.000
I don't know why you would, because none of the websites look like anyone would use edge for any reason.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
But it's there.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Bobby also points out, I could release a VOG app for Xbox one if I really wanted to.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Well, now you've nominated yourself.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Well, I mean, but you have to.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
This stream runs through Twitch.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:49.000
I mean, it would have been different if this was still a shout cast thing and shout cast being a more open platform.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
You know, it would have been a lot different.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Basically, he would be writing a very specific version of TuneIn.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Right.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000
But now that we're not there or on Twitch, I don't really know if that same logic would apply.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000
It's just kind of like we just tell people, well, just make sure you follow us and use the Twitch app, you know?

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Yeah.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
So I think there's that.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:13.000
But but, you know, but I mean, to be fair, a dedicated app could still be used for podcasts, catching up on back episodes and things like that.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
We could feed it exclusive content.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000
I don't know what the fuck we'd put on it that we're not doing already on these shows.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:25.000
But, you know, I guess we could do what all the other podcasters do and do special mini episodes that are just.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.000
But I'm like, dudes, we do a three and I use that as a universal term.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Dudes, we do a three hour podcast every week, like all the random shit we would do in a sideshow is already in this show.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
This show is bloated as fuck.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
What else do you want?

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
You can't do more random stuff.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
This show is already random.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000
The special show.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Oh my God, that's going to be my new line.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
We're like the Keith Richards of topics.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Next time.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Next time.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000
He's done all the drugs.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
All the topics.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Next time I'm on a fucking podcast panel and they're like, or they say like, your show should be an hour.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
You should be an hour and 20 minutes.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
And they're like, why is your show three hours long?

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:11.000
I'm going to be like, because all that shit y'all put on Patreon and charge people for, we just put it on our main show.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Now what?

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Now what?

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
And then I'll get escorted off the stage, but I'll have made my point.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Hey, we've done three hour shows for ages and guess what?

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Bitches, we're still here.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000
That's true.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
We are.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Who's got the longevity?

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000
That would be us.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Yeah.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000
The thing is the rest of you care about ratings.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:40.000
We were doing this show and no one was listening and we're still doing this show and no one's listening.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000
We have a few people.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000
We have a few people.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
We sure do.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000
All right.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
All right.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Anyway, Bobby Black, Wolf and Chat says, I will give you a standing ovation.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Thank you, Bobby.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
This is why we were-

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I remember someone legit gave me a dollar.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
This is why we worked together so well.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
I do remember someone gave you a dollar.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
I know who it is too.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
All right.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Anyway, where were we?

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Oh yes, the Xbox Series X.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Yes.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:13.000
How about, okay, so we actually, funny enough, we tangented into other OS and all this stuff, but let's go back to the point of the Steam store and the Epic store.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Now, see, I could also see this as Microsoft trying to play off any concerns of a monopoly because there might be concerns of anti-competitiveness.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
So if there was a way that you could access these stores-

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:39.000
But I wouldn't see that this would be a problem though, because I mean, we exist in a world that Apple has one platform for selling products within their device, their devices that they have.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
So I don't know.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
I don't think that would be necessarily a problem on a console.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
It's not like a PC where we're locking you down.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
You can only buy stuff from this.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Well, what's interesting, Apple's kind of been called out on that in the past.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:01.000
And I have a feeling, I don't know any of this, but I have a feeling this could be why they went back and they split up iTunes the way they did.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Now they have the music app and the podcast app because technically, yes, you can use Apple podcast app to listen to this, but you can use Spotify.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
You can use iHeartRadio.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
You can use other podcast apps.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Yes, you can use the music app to pay for and get music, but you can use Pandora.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:35.000
So I have a feeling exactly what you're talking about right there might be why Apple had split some of that up previously so that that chatter would hopefully dissipate a little bit because they can say there is competition in these other places.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:40.000
We do have other places you could buy TV shows and Amazon and stuff on our platform in addition to our own.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:45.000
It'll be interesting to see what they do with it, if it even exists.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:51.000
I'm, you know, I'm not knocking any more functionality for a device, so why not?

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Fair enough.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:58.000
All right, well, let's move on and talk about the Consumer Electronics Show, which happened this past weekend.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Not usually a gigantic gaming event.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000
We got little bits of well, there's still exciting stuff.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Yeah, there is. And especially if you're a collector, I think all the big news that I saw was really about we have some other little headlines later, but I think a lot of the big headlines I saw was about collectibles.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:18.000
So including one of the biggest collectible makers right now is Arcade One Up, who makes those.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000
They're just on a roll, man.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:24.000
They are on a roll. They are. Yeah, they are Ashley O on a roll, that's for sure.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Arcade One Up is doing an online enabled NBA Jam cabinet.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:35.000
So this is going to be their first one that actually you can play against your friend's NBA Jam cabinet in another state thanks to the magical Wi-Fi.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
That's pretty cool.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Even when you think like this is like really basic, like low level Xbox Live type of implementation.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.000
But it's still kind of neat to see that in an authentic cabinet, authentic collector thing.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.000
I think that's a really exciting type of thing, actually. That's cool.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
There's also yes, I am well aware and this is near and dear to my heart.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:03.000
And you can actually see this is it's probably hard to make out on the Twitch feed for those that are watching the video.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.000
But I actually have my little this is a Burger Time arcade machine.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:12.000
This is in the My Arcade series, which we'll talk about them as well, because they have news as well coming out.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
But there's that little machine.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:19.000
We see we can actually kind of hit the start so you can actually run through the game, although that is not going to come through.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000
You can hear it, though, a little bit.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000
But yeah, so it actually you play a game.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000
So they're actually putting out a full size Burger Time cabinet.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Arcade one up is. So I think that's kind of cool for sure.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Can you imagine like telling someone the 80s? Hey, yeah, you know what?

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Remember, remember how they had those Coleco arcade little things that you could buy that were kind of like cheap, cheap.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:46.000
I mean, at the time it was the best they could do, but it was like cheap, like the LED bird.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Yeah, cheap, cheap interpretations of the games like, no, you're actually going to get the full arcade hardware running on one of these.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:57.000
I mean, someone just blow their goddamn minds. Yeah, I think it's one of the people have emulated those now.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:04.000
I really want the Burger Time cab, but I just the the cost is a little bit up there and I just I can't justify the cost right now.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:11.000
They charge it for it. Three ninety nine, three ninety nine. But then you have to consider there's tax and you have to consider their shipping, which they can bring to stores.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:16.000
No, they're only it's limited edition. They're only doing three thousand prints and it's only through their stores.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
You can't even do it through Amazon to get like price or something. Yeah, I know it stinks.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
So so it's really more like five hundred dollars if you want to buy this cabinet. So I don't know.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000
I'm still kind of on the fence, but I'm worried it'll be sold out by the time I'm finally ready to commit.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:33.000
So we'll see. I'll probably decide in the next few days. Of course, all this news came out again while I was heeled over.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:44.000
In pain. Other things that arcade went up announced a pinball partnership with Zen Studios to include titles from Bali Williams and other big, big names in the pinball space.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:50.000
That's pretty exciting. So now we're going to have arcade one up pinball tables. So I'm assuming those will be kind of miniature sized as well.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:56.000
It's a three quarter scale. Yeah. And I'm just going to use it probably just be the screen tilted a little bit.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000
So probably be kind of like the cabinets are today, but with the screen tilted. That's my guess. I don't know.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:07.000
I haven't I haven't seen these machines myself yet, so be interesting. They're also talking about a sit down style Star Wars cabinet.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:13.000
So that's kind of cool, except don't I'm hearing Bobby talked about this a little bit on his show.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:19.000
I guess he saw some videos and stuff. It's kind of like it's like a bench with the screen there. It's not like the full enclosed casing.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Oh, man. We can build that yourself if you really want. But you know, I want since we're talking about like, you know, dream stuff.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Sure. I want arcade one up to start doing like the racing games, like Rush, like California Speed. Anything's possible.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:46.000
I want a driving cabinet. Can I get an arcade one up driving cabinet, please? I guess sit down driving cabinet. Not necessarily full size.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:53.000
I'll take a three quarter scale or whatever. They're also doing a new Frogger cabinet, which will have time. No one wants that.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:00.000
I love time pilot, though. I would only want Frogger if I can play the roller skates.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I'm trying to make Frogger happen, Konami. And then there's going to be a Sega Golden Axe cabinet with Golden Axe, Shinobi, Altered Beast, Wrestle Wars.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:18.000
But for the first time, Golden Axe, the Revenge of Death Adder. I guess it's not been released like this before. So that's pretty darn cool.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:25.000
So, yeah, they unveiled all sorts of stuff. That's all from arcade one up. Now, there's other companies getting in this business, too.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:37.000
There's one called II Arcade with two small eyes and arcade. This is a cabinet that you can put in the little reduced size like the arcade one ups a little bit.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:45.000
And apparently what this is, is that you hook this up and then you download whatever games you want legally.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:54.000
So this is basically trying to bring a purchase model smart into it. Yeah, it is a little like it's like, do I really want to pay one hundred fifty dollars?

01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:01.000
I mean, if you want to have like that collection, like an arcade collection, I get it. Yeah. I mean, I have the room and the money.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Sure. Why not? I'll fill my house with that stuff. But like, if you don't have the room or the money, this I think is a pretty decent option.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Yeah. So it's going to run on a special arcade OS, a customized operating system. And you'll be able to basically buy games that they are working with to be able to install on this as well.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:29.000
And I think they're talking about making different types, different shapes. So maybe like a cocktail cabinet and stuff like that. Cool. Who knows? I think that'd be very cool.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:43.000
And then I had one more bit about these actual little my arcade cabinets, the small ones that I've got here. They are going to be doing a Street Fighter two championship edition player as well.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:50.000
I think that's pretty cool. That's going to be hard to play. Well, apparently it's something that is actually going to be multiplayer as well.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:54.000
I thought I heard that was the thing so that you could actually. Yeah, you can connect it.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:00.000
So these things actually have little hookups in the back and you can connect two machines together and play against each other. Yeah, that's cool.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:10.000
That's pretty cool, huh? So, yeah, that's that's one thing that will be available. And then there is a super retro champ console, which is, I guess, I saw that.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:24.000
So that's kind of cool looking. Yeah. So that's basically it's this new like portable retro system that can use either SNES or Genesis cartridges or Mega Drive cartridges.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:32.000
So they have like a cartridge slot in the top and a cartridge slot in the bottom. And then there's a screen and it kind of has your usual like, you know, four button setup or whatever.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:39.000
That looked pretty cool. And I guess other things they had recently announced, I didn't even know were out there. There's a Space Invaders player. There's a Contra player as well.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:48.000
I didn't even know there was a Contra Contra. Yeah, I'd be down for Contra. And I believe this is the company that has the Bubble Bobble ones right now, too.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:56.000
I'm trying to actually look at their catalog to see what they have. Contra out because I need to get the Contra cabinet.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:03.000
I'm looking on their website right now so you can actually look at my arcade gaming dot com. Yeah, there's Bubble Bobble and there's Rolling Thunder, too, which I thought was pretty cool.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:10.000
And Elevator Actions. There's like all these games. They have a Mappy one. When did that come? Oh, wait. No. Hello. I have the Mappy one.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Shows you how much my brain. Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I think I have that one.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.000
I was going to say there's Heavy Barrel, Caveman Ninja, Bad Dudes. Yes, there's just there's so many of them.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:26.000
The other set that's out, apparently there's a Spy Hunter that Dan wants me to go hunting down. Geez.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:36.000
So these things are just blowing up. These little mini retro, you know, whether it be teeny tiny $30 or $40 ones or these, you know, larger $400 ones.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Like, you know, collecting these is really big right now. And this trend is going to be continuing if this year's CES is any indication. So stay tuned.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.000
All right. Meanwhile, moving on to another story, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

01:22:50.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Well, I'm sorry, I was actually looking at the game now. So Microsoft has implemented something called Project Artemis.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:13.000
What it is, it's a tool for their chat that scans all of the text conversations and rates them on the probability that a user might be trying to sexually exploit children.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:23.000
It is also then reviewed by human moderators to review the flight conversations and see if they are something that needs to be reported to law enforcement.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:40.000
So they are apparently to be implementing this on Xbox. And it looks like they're also going to be offering it up to nonprofits and other gaming and messaging service developers to help prevent the exploitation of children.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:50.000
And this is, of course, coming right on the heels of COPPA, which that in itself is problematic. But we'll see what becomes of it.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:24:04.000
If only they had something so good for people who harass women on the Internet, wickedly glaring at every video game chat that exists in the universe.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:14.000
You know, or all these little toxic small penis males out there who want women to not have a voice.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:20.000
So do you think we're going to maybe in 2020 see our first arrest from use of this technology?

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.000
I hope so. Yeah, I'd love to see it. I'd love to see all these predators.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I wouldn't love to see this action ever happen, but I understand it's out there.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:33.000
You know what I mean? I'd like to see the predators caught and dealt with.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:39.000
I would love to see the predators caught and dealt with. Could this technology capture on swatters?

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:45.000
I guess maybe not, maybe, but it's maybe something police can install or so. I don't know. They'd be nice, though, if they could do that, too.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Yeah. You know, just like even if people joke about it, they need to be flagged because it's not funny.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:58.000
It's not funny at all. Do you think people are going to have a problem, though? I mean, it's more and more we start to get more and more aware of like all these devices that listen in on us, right?

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Like there's all this talk. Privacy isn't a thing anymore. There's no privacy? No, there's really no privacy anymore.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Not if you don't want something of yours that has been in or on the Internet to be public.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000
You do not put it on the Internet at all. You write it down.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:25.000
That's why I keep a journal, a physical written damn journal now so that I don't have to worry about my dirty laundry being aired.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:31.000
You know, I don't put anything unless I break in your home and steal your journal. But she says that's at my house.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Fair enough. I keep the thing with me. So but at any rate and, you know, I'm just being teasing anyway.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:51.000
That's fine. But but at any rate, you know, I think if this is a this is a suitable reaction to a problem that's happening.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:26:05.000
It's it's it was predictable that something like this would happen. And so, again, I think that if you're that kind of filthy creature that wants to prey on children for whatever.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Pleasure you want to get from exploited children, then you best be considering, number one, your life choices.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Number two, getting psychological help. And number three, keeping that garbage off of the Internet.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:27.000
You know, it's Dan and I were just talking about this the other day, too.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000
We're talking about the subway guy and how garbage he was.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:36.000
And just talking about how these people and we're learning about them now because nothing is private on the Internet.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:44.000
But when you go to play a game on Xbox Live, essentially you're saying you're going on the Internet and the things that you're saying, the things that you're doing, their public record.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Yeah. You're doing them on the Internet and you're doing them online by participating in this chat. You have consented to be scrutinized.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:57.000
End of story. Yeah. And honestly, I want these predators to be they're out there.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:05.000
We know they are. I want them caught and removed. I want these people who are out there harassing other people to be caught and removed.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:13.000
I want them to see that their behavior is unacceptable. And yes, you will be held accountable for it. End of story.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:19.000
So interesting that technology is taking us steps closer to that. So I'm glad for it.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:24.000
I mean, nothing is private anymore. Just remember, everybody, nothing is private.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:32.000
If you don't want some if you are going to put something out there that you feel might remotely be regrettable, don't fucking do it.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.000
End of story. Better delete my Twitter account. All right.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Moving on. Loki, what do we have next? So more updates to Pokemon Go.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:48.000
So Gen five, they're going to be having some more Pokemon added to the roster for Pokemon Go.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:54.000
And what's going to be a little bit unique about this is that some of these you'll be able to get by evolving.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Well, your Pokemon will evolve when you do trades, because I think they're trying to really get people to use the trade function on there.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:16.000
So right now they have certain Pokemon like Kadabra, Machoke, Graveler and Haunter that you need to.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:22.000
They're going to have no candy evolutions. I guess that will be something that's going to be available now.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Along with that, they're going to be adding some more Pokemon.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:36.000
So Bulldor, Girder, Garblast and Shelmet are going to be added as well to this trade evolution.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Then they're going to be adding some more Pokemon that are going to be for the fifth generation that you build a hatch from eggs.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:54.000
So that includes Roggenrola, Tympole, Dwebler, Trubbish, Karablast, Joltik, Shelmet and then some additional ones.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:01.000
And then they talk about some of the more region exclusive stuff as well.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:06.000
So North America, South America and Africa are going to be getting Thoreau.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
And those are going to be from 10 kilometer eggs.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:15.000
I'm so bored of regional exclusives though. It sucks so much for people that aren't able to like just easily travel and all that.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000
You know, it's just, I don't know. I wish there was, I mean, I guess alternative ways come out eventually.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Some of these regions don't make any sense either. So like, okay, so like I said, North America, South America and Africa.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Okay, those are continents. Then we have Southern United States, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and South America get Maractus.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:43.000
I mean, that's kind of weird that there's that overlap there.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Europe, Asia and Australia are getting Sauk.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Egypt and Greece are getting Sigilyph.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Eastern Hemisphere red striped form Basculin and Western Hemisphere blue striped form Basculin.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Hmm. That's hard to keep track of.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Yeah, you're going to need one of those guides that shows you all the different regionals and what's in, what's in each region and all that.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
I'll catch what I catch and I'll be happy with that. That's fine.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:21.000
That's right. That's right. Let's see. I'm actually kind of looking through my own collection because I find that these new ones they released, they're out there, but they're all kind of harder to find.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:29.000
I have three Roggenrolas. So I guess that's the easiest one. I play a lot with my Bluetooth too. So I don't always see what I'm catching.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:36.000
I know I raided this timber. I saw that timber and I raided that. I have a Venipede and a Basculin.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.000
I have a few Venipedes.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Yeah. So, so you're getting, you're seeing those Venipedes. Yeah. But I don't, I mean, that's all of the like new stuff I've caught. So I need to

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
I also got a shiny Seviper.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
I need to hatch more stuff. So.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:55.000
All right. All right. So there's what's going on in Pokemon Go. Let's talk about what's going on in mainline Pokemon Go.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Or excuse me, mainline Pokemon Go. Mainline Pokemon.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000
All the Pokemanses. Pokemon Go play it on the Switch.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Yeah. Pokemon Go and play it on the Switch because there was a big Pokemon Direct that happened this week.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:12.000
And they did, they did a little bit of like, yes, home still coming. And you know, little bits of that.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:19.000
They also talked about a Pokemon mystery dungeon game that had a demo that came out. I did play that a little bit actually.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000
That was cute.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Is that a new game or is it just a remake?

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:28.000
It's a remaster or redo or whatever of like, I think it was on Game Boy Advance because it was around the time of gen.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000
I think the first three gens are in it. So it's.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.000
They had a few mystery dungeons that were on DS as well.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:41.000
They did. They did. I think that represent later generations. But what I played was cute. So, yeah.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:46.000
And then they announced some this and this is a surprise. Nobody was expecting this.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:54.000
But Pokemon Sword and Shield will be getting expansions that will be adding 200 more Pokemon to the games.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:58.000
And these are Pokemon from the past. So these are Pokemon.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
I kind of figured that they would be doing this.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000
And some folks kind of thought, oh, that's what they're doing for DLC.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:12.000
And, you know, some folks are accusing Pokemon Company and Nintendo of being, you know, greedy by doing it this way and, you know, so forth.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:22.000
I kind of prefer it to what's been historically there, because if you think about it and they they said in very plain terms, this is taking the place of a third game.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:26.000
So there's not going to be a Pokemon gun or a Pokemon armor.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Instead, there's going to be the Isle of Armor, but then DLC with one of the Pokemon getting a gun.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.000
And that's yeah, I was gonna say that's too bad because there is a Pokemon with a gun now.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000
And that is we're referring to a new GMax form for Inteleon.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:45.000
So, yeah, but but anyway, I'm sure you guys have seen all the memes at this point.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:33:04.000
They're doing the DLC. But but my point with this is, is that, you know, if you really sit down and think about it, you know, and what blows me away how people are still complaining about this is that this is what folks were saying they wanted was like, oh, well, just do a Pokemon gun that has all of the old Pokemon in it.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Well, guess what? You would be paying $60 for that.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.000
And usually when they do something like that, they cut Pokemon.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:16.000
It's not all just all new. It's not a best of the first. It doesn't eliminate the first two games.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.000
It has some from column A, some from column B and not everything.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:28.000
This way, you're not having to buy a whole new game and play what is essentially the same plot over again, right?

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Because Pokemon yellow was just fucking Pokemon red. But with Pikachu following you, that's all it was.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:40.000
It wasn't that different. Like maybe minor differences. You want to get a piggy with me, but otherwise not that different.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:48.000
But this method, it's going to be cheaper overall. Yes, $30 is expensive for DLC, but that's $30 for both parts.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:53.000
So a new if they had done a Pokemon gun or whatever, it would've been a $60 game.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
So this is actually going to be cheaper than that.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
You have to buy it twice if you have two different games.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000
You do have to buy it twice if you have two different games. Oh, I don't know about that.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Pokemon experts, do I have to buy it twice if I own both sword and shield? The answer is you might. For that.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:15.000
That's lame. But see, just fucking trade for the missing ones.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:22.000
I understand Pokemon completionists are going to need to buy it twice for that, but they also chose to be Pokemon completionists.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.000
I know Shane does. Shane does not give a fuck about this whole, or like, like in a good way.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:32.000
He's like, I'm all about this DLC. This is the way to do it. I'm pumped and all that.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.000
He will, he will not give a fuck about paying twice if he has to. I know that already.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:49.000
So, um, uh, yeah, I, I don't think people that already invested in buying the same game twice are going to worry about buying the same DLC twice because you already bought the same game twice.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:54.000
I guess. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, let me see. I'm actually trying to look at chat here. Okay.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Uh, Shane says, um, yes, you have to buy a shield one and a sword one.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Um, Shane is also saying, how is it greedy when you don't need to buy the expansion to trade or transfer in the returning Pokemon?

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:16.000
People just want to complain. Sometimes I feel like, um, and act def follows that up with people are still so goddamn salty about national decks, but I just rather not pay attention to the haters anymore.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:24.000
And you're right. It's not that some, somebody chose to just gloss over that part of the direct where they explicitly showed.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:29.000
If you don't want to buy the DLC, you can still trade for the Pokemon that are in the DLC.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:37.000
They're not going to show up in your old game in the wild area or anything like that. I don't want they might, I don't know, maybe one or two, but that's not in the plan, but you could trade for him.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:44.000
So if you really want a fucking Bulbasaur or whatever, I don't, and I don't know if Bulbasaur is in the expansion. I'm just assuming trade for it.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Just like, and that's that my friends is how it used to be done anyway, because then people are salty about, oh, I got to trade or know these people do that stuff.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:59.000
What the fuck do you think it was on the Game Boy Advance with that fucking cable?

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Because the people complaining about it aren't old and salty like me. They don't remember those days. That's how you used to have to do it.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.000
So there is seriously no satisfying some people.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:22.000
It wasn't this trading over the internet bullshit. It was, you had to be in the same room and tethered to each other.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Yeah. Anyway, uh, Shane also points out in our chat, uh, Bulbasaur is the expansion in one way or another since as a GMax form now.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Oh, I didn't even, I actually didn't watch the direct. I just read all the new, cause you know, once you, once you kind of read everything, you're like, all right.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.000
And I've kind of seen it, but I guess I should go back and watch it at some point.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:43.000
So, uh, SGO and Hunter Matt in chat says, uh, folks who are losing their minds over this need to go outside.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Um, Akdeft in chat says, I only have shield, so it's only once. And yeah, I only have shield too. I only plan to buy it once.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:37:05.000
If there's something I really need, I know I have a Pokemon affectionate auto number one fan for a friend where if I'm like, will you please get me an egg for such and such Pokemon?

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.000
He'll get me an egg for such and such Pokemon. It's not that hard. You know what I mean?

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:21.000
So, you know, just, and you know what, even if you're sitting there going, I don't have any friends, um, go to VOG network and talk to people because I'm sure there are tons of you raise your hand in chat.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:29.000
If you're willing to make eggs for people that really, really want to Pokemon, but can't afford the DLC, I'll fucking do it. Like I will.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:32.000
So I'm sure there are plenty of people that are willing to help get you.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.000
I realize y'all are going to be my egg donors. Okay.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:44.000
That's, that's how the world works in 2020. I, that is fine. I will be your egg donor. So I will be a surrogate for those eggs on my Pokemans.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Um, Shane also points out in gen five, if you wanted pre gen five Pokemon, you needed a second DS. So yeah, this doesn't seem bad at all.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:59.000
And Shane is saying, I'll always help in Pokemon. Uh, and active says Galarian slowpoke is the best. I got the shiny the same day.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Oh yeah, that was the thing they did too. So even, uh, just load up your sword and shield game and you go to the train station in the first town whose name is escaping me right now.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:20.000
But the very first town you're in, there's a train station and you will see one of the new characters and the character you see depends on, so I have shield.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:29.000
So I got the psychic lady with the Pokeballs spinning around her head. So, um, and, uh, there was a Galarian slowpoke there that I had to catch.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:37.000
So it was that muppet looking Galarian meowth. It's cute. That's just, they like to do the different stuff. It looks like a freaking muppet.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:52.000
He looks like animal and Dr. Teeth. Oh, wet mud wrestling. Oh, Shane and chat says that Avery is actually a guy, Rob. Well, it's, you know what? It's 2020 and gender is just a suggestion. So who cares? So that's that.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:39:08.000
All right. Anyhow. Uh, so yeah, uh, the aisle armor is in June, 2020 crown tundra is in fall 2020. And, uh, yeah, your starter will be able to gigantamax, which will be fun, uh, and all that good stuff.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:14.000
So you can pre-order both now if you want. Um, I don't like to give my money away until it's ready.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Who pre-orders DLC? Especially if it's digital. I mean, come on.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Why? So Shane, when did you pre-order yours already? That I, I'm going to tell you why I probably wouldn't do it today, but I'll do it the week before because then I get that game if you pre-order.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:45.000
So that's what you get close. You get close in game. If you pre-order, I'm glad that. Hey, some of us are fashionistas. Okay. All right. So we like to be pretty.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:58.000
All right. Anyhow. Um, there you go. I'm excited. I think this is the way to do it. I'm happy. I'm happy. It's this and not sword to shield to or gun or armor like this is great.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:08.000
I think I just didn't expect this from Pokemon. So now that it's here, I'm like, cool. And they're addressing and they're addressing the Nash decks thing as a part of it.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Like I kind of didn't even think they really, I mean, we all kind of knew they'd do something, but I mean, especially when they found the files for, um, one of those, remember we had that story on an older episode that the files were in the game for one of the older ones.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:37.000
They had like, so I would bet that's a DLC Pokemon. So there's something going on there. But anyway, all right, let's move on. Uh, dark Sakura, a completely different story, but, um, here, here we go again with things we're going to change in 2020. Right?

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Well, and you know how I feel about labor and unionizing, I'm a big, uh, big fan of, uh, unions. And of course we've had it recently in the news where, you know, by recently, I mean, in the last few months where a Kickstarter got in trouble for firing members who wanted to unionize.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Google was in trouble for firing members that were trying to unionize and using their work intranet to share labor laws with other people, which is by the way, if they're right to do so, um, the, the employee's right to share that information because it really should be posted in public areas.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:39.000
But now, um, there is a, uh, a group, uh, the CWA, um, and that's working with Game Workers Unite, which is a grassroots organization, um, to work on unionizing the, um, the tech world and video game development world, um, into a big labor union.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Um, right now the project is called the campaign to organize digital employees or code for short, how freaking clever, um, to see about getting that union going on to protect, uh, people who work in, um, those fields.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:06.000
For example, um, uh, there was another, uh, a, uh, the Pittsburgh Association of Tech Professionals unionized Google, Google Subtractors, um, successfully.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Um, you know, there is, uh, even talk at the 2019 Video Game Developers Conference about the industry's practice of making employees work over 100 hours in a week to finish a game without extra pay.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Basically, we've talked about the crunch time thing before and how this abuses their employee, employees and puts out a substandard product.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:49.000
So, really, you know, with the, the walkouts at Google, the walkout at Riot Games, um, the claims of sexual harassment and just in general, uh, uh, what's the word I'm thinking, of discrimination at some, some video game companies, I think it's high time we had unions to protect the, the workers.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:43:00.000
You know, and I'm going to tell people this, for anyone who's anti-union, you know what you have to thank a union for? How about your 40 hour work week? How about such concepts as overtime? How about eliminating child labor?

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Uh, you want examples of what happens when, uh, workers are not protected by a union. Look at the, uh, Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, uh, fire in, uh, the early, early 19th century.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Uh, sorry, early, uh, uh, 20th century, 1900s. Look at, um, I mean, just, uh, construction standards. All of these come because of unions. OSHA we have to protect you at work because of fucking unions.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:39.000
So don't talk to me about being anti-union when you take everything that a union has given you for fucking granted. It's time that the tech field had the same thing.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Yeah, I'm, uh, I, I think it's one of those things where a lot of us have sort of seen this shoes been ready to drop for some time. It's just a matter of kind of like when, so I'm very curious to see how this proceeds.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:44:06.000
What else I'm also kind of curious to hear about is the impact of AB5 in the game industry because we haven't heard a lot about that, but we do have some very big game makers here in California, which if you guys aren't aware, AB5 was the law here in California that talked about what is and what isn't an employee.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:19.000
And the targets of the law really felt like it was supposed to be Uber and Lyft basically is that, you know, if you, if you work so many, you know, it's contracts or whatever that basically this, this company should be treating you like an employee and you should have those types of employee benefits.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:27.000
I personally, I think the law, the, the law is good intention and I get what they're trying to do. I think there's some huge flaws.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:40.000
I have some artists friends that are really struggling with this and some journalists friends that are now getting turned away for work because the company realized it's not a national lots, California.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:48.000
So they just want to go hire people in Nevada and Arizona and all this stuff. So I think the law needs a lot of work still, but it is law.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:45:02.000
And so I'm curious to see how it impacts kind of the gaming industry and some of those more established things. So, but going back into that though is that I think that if we do have the genes enabled here in state.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Then that also does give it gives a lot more power to be able to bargain with government agencies to have laws revised to have that the backing of the union behind those legislative actions to protect the workers who are affected negatively by these laws.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:29.000
So, I mean, and if you want to look at another recent example I mean SAG-AFTA when they had or after when they had their big thing for voice actors.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:42.000
You know, I think in the long run that unionizing will work out for the best will help with those laws in the books that may be abused right now like this new one.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:58.000
And also just, you know, let companies know that you can't keep taking your employees for granted, you cannot take advantage of them anymore. We are people, we have lives we need to have those lives protected, including our rights to work in a safe environment.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:07.000
So we'll be very curious to see what develops of this I have a feeling it's gonna be one of those 2020 stories we're going to look back on in December and see how far did this really come along throughout the year.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:20.000
So, in the meantime, we're going to move on to one comment by she hooked in please go ahead, 99% of companies are now not employee friendly we're becoming a slave labor country over the next 20 years.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:36.000
And I mean, but that's also going back into again where we're seeing certain government people really putting the money on the capitalist front instead of on the workers, so hopefully that will change.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:48.000
We'll see. All right, moving on to our next story Loki, so there was something that kind of caught the eyes of a lot of people covering CS and that was alien whereas concept UFO.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:58.000
It is a portable PC gaming system that has detachable controllers, where have I heard that before. Sounds kind of like the Nintendo Switch and that's kind of what it is.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:04.000
It's basically like a PC version of the Nintendo Switch it's got a 10 inch screen.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:19.000
So it's a little bit bigger than the switches six in 6.2 inch screen, and the joy six on the side or the this basically the controllers can actually detach from the system as well.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:28.000
It has a little kickstand in the back, and then you can kind of combine them together, much like you can with the joy cons, and their little attachment as well.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Right now it is just the concept so no word on what hardware is driving your what costs or when it's going to be out or anything like that, but it is neat to see like some sort of portable gaming type of thing.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:50.000
I'd be down for this. At one point I was trying to build something like this so why not, you know, of course it's Alienware so it's probably gonna be $1,000 so.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:48:07.000
How fast would Nintendo try to shut this down though. I don't think they can it's not necessarily exactly it's not, it's not like the switch in the sense that you can use each individual controller as its own controller because it's not symmetrical in that way.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:16.000
It would just, they would come off and basically allow you to almost like plug this into your TV or something like that to play on your TV.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:25.000
I don't think that they can really sue them or anything for saying that they stole the idea but yeah it's definitely heavily inspired by it.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:30.000
You know kind of like the PlayStation Move and the Kinect and the Switch motion controls.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:41.000
I think we all have also known it's really just a matter of time before you know this the Switch idea gets borrowed by other people so I think in some ways this news isn't that surprising.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:46.000
It'll just be you know is it gonna look like a cheap knockoff like the the V?

01:48:46.000 --> 01:49:04.000
No it doesn't it doesn't look like a cheap knockoff of the V they were showing some games running on it it was running pretty smooth so I don't know if it's necessarily something that's gonna take off but I mean we'll have to see what it ends up looking like if it ever actually comes out.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Yeah for sure. All right well moving on I'm gonna make this real quick because one of the other things that we saw at this Consumer Electronics Show this week was the new PlayStation 5 logo.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.000
That is not even something that needed like an announcement at all it's just stupid.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:28.000
It was the one piece of video game news that came out well here's the thing it and maybe this is the internet making a bigger deal out of it than it really is because Sony just kind of like talked about you know their their path trajectory and where PlayStation has been.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:34.000
They did not divulge anything about the new console that's going to come later. They just showed the new logo.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Now you might think this is a missed opportunity for me to show the logo here on Twitch but don't forget we're recording the audio for a podcast as well so you'll have to come with me to imagination land.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:49.000
OK. So here we go. Ready. Ready everybody. I want you to imagine the PlayStation 4 logo.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:50:04.000
OK. So now you see in the cloud you see a PlayStation 4 logo. OK. Now I want you to take that 4. OK. And I want you to make it a 5. Oh my God. There it is. PlayStation 5 logo. That is as logo for the PlayStation 5.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Honestly enough though I think that it's smart for them to not change it because it still fits their branding. I mean because really they've kept that particular branding since the PS2.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:31.000
And all I get it like you know some you know and I'm sure dark soccer you could nerd about this because I know you're into typography and all this other stuff too is that you could nerd out about like how a font is representative to a brand and things like this and you do see it in other places.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:42.000
So as much as we might be giving this announcement a little bit of shit. It is kind of one of those things where it's like look it ain't broke. Don't fix it. This is PlayStation brand. This is what it looks like. Why would they change it now.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Exactly. But I'm bummed. That's it. They've essentially had the same damn thing since PlayStation 2. Really. The only thing with is it instead of they've done this thing that a lot of companies have done where they've really tried to simplify things because you know for PS2 for example it was that sort of gradiated blue purple color because you know the the PS2 also had that strip around it that had the same color and they've done white on black which it's just.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Very simple. It's simplified the branding as much as they can while still keeping that font that it's been known for. I'll be honest I still prefer the branding from the first PlayStation.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:38.000
I liked the text. It was very clean. I wish that they had stuck with that for a while and sort of got it because honestly the current PlayStation font went spelled out and said just P.S. It's kind of hard to read you know because it's more uniform in size.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:52.000
The thing is is that people recognize words by their shape which is why people have trouble reading things if they're all in caps. Just showing that out there. I think though that at least for sake of consistency it's a smart move.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:52:01.000
They're like yeah we're still here. We don't need to do anything fancy. We don't need to change it up every time because our product is fucking solid.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:14.000
I'm going to put you on the spot a little bit so I apologize in advance because you may not have an easy answer to this question. But what would be for comparison sake what do you think would be another brand that's really defined by its font.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Google.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Back in the day. Remember people had a big shit over them moving from a serif font to a sans serif. Another one was another one that changed their font.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Gap did it for a little bit and then people were like super nuts about it and switch back to to Gap. In the 80s Apple's use of Adobe Garamond Pro in their ads.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:52.000
I remember that Gap controversy. Yeah. OK. Now the chat is chiming in. You ready. I think this is a great answer from SJ 100 Matt Disney Disney. Oh absolutely. That's a great answer.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Bobby with a tongue in cheek answer that's actually kind of legit vogue. Oh yeah. I mean we use I don't think it's easy. We use you can say it right. We use your style. Yeah you use your style as the font and that is the font that you see over in the sidebar and the low bar.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:19.000
And it's the same font that's in the logo. It's on our business card. Yeah it's everywhere. I I the only I custom did the O as you know the power symbol but even that was the G.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:35.000
But even that was built off of your style. Yeah. But I mean but going back into you know old era versus new you can look at an Apple ad from the 80s and just even without the picture there.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:51.000
You can look at the font on it and know that it's an 80s Apple ad because everything was set in Adobe Garamond Pro. You can look at New York Times their their headline logo not their headline but their logo is never changed.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:54:04.000
You can just all they do is the N.Y.T. and you can look at those letters and know that they go to New York Times. In fact Times New Roman that font came because of the New York Times.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:17.000
You know you can look at. Gosh what else I'm thinking of that's had a consistent font. There's all those companies that use Helvetica but that's not really the same thing you just know.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Oh they're using fucking Helvetica. A couple of their answers here and then we'll probably move on for time. Did your mess says Microsoft which they changed theirs though didn't they.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Well actually the Xbox Series X Xbox one and Xbox 360 all use the same font. I remember what the original Xbox didn't. So they've kind of kept a consistent look since then.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Apple switched the SF font but it really has just been a variation of the last two iterations of fonts that were being used.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:57.000
And now though you can or even this you can look at like I'd say from the OS 10.9 earlier and how they all had that same font you could look at that and say oh that's that's from a Mac screen.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:08.000
You know and lastly she hope says Mercedes Mercedes is defined by their font. Very good one. Yeah absolutely. Great answers all around from chat and our soccer thing.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Yes. And pie culture's saying time and she thought this would be a quick topic didn't you. Well we ended up turning it into font nerd. So you know what worked.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:32.000
But I think that's something that people don't really think about with games or with anything is branding. Sure. You know think about something when you see a logo in the future. Ask yourself why is that sticking out in my head.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Why is it something that I'm always going to remember. And if you want to look up one of my personal heroes look at the logos that Saul Bass has designed for the record.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:51.000
He also directed the shower scene in Psycho. Just saying he was big friends with Hitchcock. He did a lot of the movie titles for Hitchcock movies.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:56:03.000
But just look at his logo designs. He did Continental. He did Girl Scouts. He did Delta. I think airlines for a little while he did the United Way.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Look at his designs and look at the font choices with those and tell me why they have lasting memory. You know what else always looks fucking consistent with branding and font and everything.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:24.000
A Star Wars movie. Oh hell yeah. It's always that same font in the scroll in the beginning. It's always the credits cinema. The credits always look the same is branding too. Yeah. Like did you like you saw Mandalorian right. No I didn't.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Well the transitions. They use the wipes I bet right. He's a lot of the wipes. He's a lot of the same transitions they do in the movies. All right. Anyway we got to move on. We get to a whole other three hour podcast about brand nerds.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:50.000
I'm sure that podcast actually exists. It's got to somewhere I'm sure. All right. Anyway let's move on. So in the sidebar it says classic game of the week with a question mark because every week Dark Soccer likes to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks hey you guys should be enjoying this game this week.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:57:03.000
I hope you approve of my pick last week by the way on if you saw what I picked Crystal Castles. Oh yeah. Yeah that's good. That's good. But we did do a game last week but you know it's a new year new twist and we've been promising this twist for some time.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:21.000
So Dark Soccer what is the 2020 twist. First off on this segment once a month we are doing a pinball game every month and it has to be that 90s era of pinball pre pinball 2000 but post when they started using the digital displays.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Well that's a restriction you're putting on yourself. I think the rest of us are just all pinball pinball. OK. Well I'm thinking about doing other more classic.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:42.000
You know this also means I can't do my beloved Black Knight 2000 for example. So but also still holding it to the same rules. I can do like my 2000 but you are going to still be holding it to the same rules of 10 years old at least.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Yeah. So we're we're basically I can just tell you this right now. Everything's going to be from the 90s. All right. Fair enough. All right. So tonight's is the first of twelve. So January's pick for the classic pinball table of the month.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Duh. World Cup soccer pinball. I knew it was going to be this. So. So and I tried to get something that would show the gameplay but the music on here is my favorite music in the damn game.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Would you hear for like all of a hot minute. It comes in just that it has like a weird drum loop in the game. Then your music comes in right after it. So yeah. But yeah I like the music. It's like right when the ball has been activated.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Yeah. And it only plays at this one point in the game. Right when it transitions to gameplay you start to hear it.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:37.000
I just think it's cool. Yeah. And by the way this is not footage from Dark Soccer's house. This is a YouTuber I forgot to credit my bad because I don't own sort of Fury and fuck if I did I would be in.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:57.000
But you see what's next to it is a regular Black Knight. Yeah. So that's cool. Anyway. Anyway. So and I will go into some video game stuff on this too. So basically World Cup soccer. It came out in 1994 February 1984 and my personal love of this game is that we had one at the arcade that I worked at.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:12.000
And I played the fuck out of this game. It is to this day my favorite pinball table. It was designed by John Papa Duke and Larry Demar Papa Duke in and of himself.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:26.000
He's also responsible for theater of magic. So another big one. You've definitely seen Papa Duke stuff. It does have some special toys as were a little bit marked for that era of pinball.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:34.000
It has a spinning soccer ball that when you've lit up all these items which makes the goal light up makes the goalie move the ball will start spinning.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:43.000
True story. Dan had my ball spinning backwards when we first got the table so you can imagine how freaking hard it was because you can bounce off the ball to knock it into the goal.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:59.000
But but that's the big thing is that it has a you know the soccer or football theme to it. There were eight thousand seven hundred forty three units confirmed produced.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:11.000
It has two flippers three pop bumpers two ramps roll under spinner kickback Magnus save located on the play field above the left flipper that is activated by an extra button on the left side the cabinet.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:26.000
There is a magna lock located on the middle left play field that holds the balls from multi multi ball play a goalie target move side to side at the top left play field and a maximum of three by in balls per player under the operator option.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:37.000
The the art was done by Kevin O'Connor. So you know it's just really one of the one of the great ones on there.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:50.000
This particular one people kind of overlook it a little bit just because oh soccer theme whatever but they don't realize that the game has actually had some pretty significant design to it.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Even my husband funny enough he was like I didn't you know really appreciate this one until you know you were all hyper about getting one.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:10.000
And then when we got one he's like oh yeah I really like it. So you can of course if you go to the Internet pinball database you can get the rule sets for this table if you want to know the ins and outs of it.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:32.000
I would say for anyone who wants to go play pinball and get good at playing pinball even if you're just going to your arcade to play it go to the Internet pinball database and look up the rules and see you know what tricks you can do how to get like your your jackpots how to get your different modes lined up in the game.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:48.000
So going with this one is that for I have a hole in my socks that makes me sad. Anyway I just noticed my favorite socks too. But anyway for the pinball arcade it was available as DLC and it was removed on June 30th 2018.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:59.000
And it was published as world champion soccer because Farsight Studios were unable to secure the World Cup soccer license from FIFA.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:08.000
And it had like all kinds of different things to it. But they also changed like the back glass and everything but it was roughly the same table.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:26.000
So some trivia about this one is that for the it looks like for the bonus round. I don't know if this is just for the digital versions or the arcade because I haven't really looked.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:40.000
Is it riding for Mortal Kombat as a cameo in the bonus round. And then the flyer for the machine shows an American football field as in you know like American football instead of a soccer field in the background.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:51.000
But the stadium shown is Soldier Field in Chicago that had many of the 1994 World Cup matches there including the opening match for 1994 World Cup.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:03:05.000
So that is your game. It is World Cup soccer and I will also for the sake of chat provide a link from pinside dot com which is another great resource for pinball information.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:14.000
It's just really you know don't you know don't poopoo on it because it's soccer. It really is a solid game.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Again Papa Duke other things that he designed like I said theater magic is is really the big one.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:29.000
I'm trying to get it to load the list of it's got to make so much sense because theater magic also has another one of those like gigantic things in the middle of the table.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:33.000
So I guess a lot of people have that but theater magic is fucking amazing.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:43.000
I love magic. Well you know I have that too. Yeah. But yeah Papa Duke did a circus Voltaire.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:49.000
He did Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:52.000
Star Wars Episode One.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:04:01.000
Tornado Tales of the Arabian Nights. OK. So funny thing about this one at Moby Dick in San Francisco in the Castro.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:11.000
They have World Cup soccer theater magic and Tales of the Arabian Nights all next to each other in the back three of the greatest tables.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:19.000
And they're all John Papa. I don't know if they still do. They do. Oh do they. Wow. Yeah. One of my buddies who works at Cliffs.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:26.000
The fabric side of Cliffs was actually the one who told me that they were still there.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:34.000
But yeah. If you're in San Francisco go to Castro. If you want to try these three amazing Papa Duke tables all three of them are at Moby Dick.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:41.000
All right. And then you get your drink. All right. There it is your classic pinball table of the month World Cup soccer.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Ninety four. All right. Very cool. Y'all just can't come to my house. The first you bring me measure me chocolate.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:53.000
I'm sure Rob the first to that should be a contest in the future when a trip to our soccer house.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:05:02.000
OK. I can sleep on my air mattress on the floor kind of like the old like win a trip to Nickelodeon Studios and tour the studios and get slimed on the city.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:08.000
You get that on television. Things like that. Like they should we should do a win a trip to Dark Soccer's house.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:12.000
Yeah. Anyway. All right. Let's move on. We got more topics to get into here.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Plenty of show left and about a 20. So really sad about my song now because I can't replace these.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:26.000
They don't sell them anymore. I'm sorry. Look at my socks everybody. They have cats. All right.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Let's talk to Loki and get some rapid fire news. So you know who says old games can't be updated to offer new things.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:43.000
So apparently some of the console ports of Doom and Doom 2 have received some new updates to add a lot of new support.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:54.000
So, for example, 60 FPS support. So now Doom runs actually at 60 FPS instead of 35 FPS add on support.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:06:08.000
So add ons can be downloaded and played from the main menu so that they can do a mixture of Doom and Doom 2 add ons as well as community episodes and megawatts.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Added aspect ratio options to the original four three. Added quick save and quick load.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Level select, weapon carousel, quick weapon select, brightness and level brightness, random sound effects, pitch toggle, new.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:38.000
They have a new HUD for the split screen. It's a minimal HUD to give you some more space to see in there and change the health graphics and change Wolfenstein secret level.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:48.000
Did you know this is available on PC as well? Yeah. If you bought the game on the Bethesda store, if you bought it on steam, fuck you.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:55.000
That's yeah. I was. What about, what about dog? Uh, Nope. But that's the store. That's it.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Cause it has to be this particular 2019 or 18 rerelease. So they do remember when the big meme going around, you have to have a Bethesda net account to continue.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:14.000
Oh yeah. I remember that. Okay. That was from when they rereleased doom everywhere. So your version of doom has to be one of those that was part of that meme joke.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:21.000
So if you don't have a version of doom that had that, then it doesn't qualify. Oh well. Yeah, I guess I miss out. Who cares?

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Um, and then this is kind of cool, but, uh, apparently there's a brand new mod, uh, grand theft auto vice city remastered that they have basically dumped the map of grand theft auto vice city into grand theft auto five on PC.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:49.000
So I guess you can go ahead and check it out now before it gets a cease and desist, but at least it's available right now in five mods.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:08:00.000
Get it now before it's gone. All right. Um, moving on, uh, Nintendo apparently filed a new trademark for a Mario and Luigi game, but wait a minute.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:13.000
Didn't they close the studio behind that? Well, something may be going on here. Uh, so Nintendo of America filed a new trademark in South America, uh, and, uh, says the trademark will be for computer game cartridges, game memory cards, and so on and so on.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:23.000
This could just be them making sure their intellectual property doesn't go away or anything like that, but it should, you know, just caught people's eyes. Like why now? Why this? So put it in out there.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Uh, also from consumer electronics show the retron junior, uh, it plays game boy, game boy color and game boy advanced games all on your TV.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:37.000
It's this teeny tiny little box, uh, that connects to the TV via an HDMI, and then it will output the games in seven 20 P.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:46.000
Uh, it has a super Nintendo style scout controller, uh, that connects to the console. And so you can actually, uh, yeah, play all your portable games on your TV.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:56.000
But that's, uh, for those of you that want to go back and play your old Pokemon games, there's how you can do it. Can I get a link cable to, uh, connected to another retron mini that I can then put transfer my Pokemon across?

02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:08.000
There is a 3.5 millimeter headphone socket and link port, which allows two retron junior systems to be connected together for games, which support multiple players. Awesome. How about that? Hell yes. They thought of everything.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:12.000
They thought of everything and the kitchen sink. All right. Dark Sakura.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:28.000
Well, um, the, uh, game artist for the silent hill, uh, series, the early silent hill series, um, Ito Masahiro, um, has teased on Twitter that he is working on a title as a core member and they hope it won't be canceled.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:47.000
He was one of the members of team silent. Um, and just his art was, was absolutely haunting. Um, one of really the things that made silent hill. Um, I, I have one of the lithographs thanks to Shane for silent hill too. It's one of my favorite things. I think he signed it too.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Um, but just one of my favorite artists and I'm super, super happy. And I hope it is something very silent hill-ish and that maybe he might, I'm, I've got this dream in my head that he's working on something with Kojima.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:16.000
Anything's possible. In my head, in my heart. And then also AGDQ 2020, which I brought this up earlier. They broke 3 million. They were so close to pie million Rob.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:27.000
They made it to 3.13 million for prevent cancer foundation. And it is the second GDQ that has raised more than $3 million in the marathon.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:45.000
Um, it had 54,134 donors as of 11 AM Eastern time yesterday, I believe, no this morning, I think. Um, and it raised more than 700,000 above what AGDQ, uh, raised last year, which is a 30% increase.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Um, and it's absolutely amazing to, to see what happens when people put together for good, when they do so much fun. I watched the Animorphs run. It was fucking hilarious.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Um, just the guy they had doing Animorphs. And then he, he hung around, um, jawing with some other people. He's absolutely hilarious.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:17.000
Um, I had a really good time watching this. I'm glad I got to contribute. And, um, the, uh, Summer Games Done Quick, which is our next one, is happening June 21st through 28th in Bloomington, Minnesota.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:36.000
Um, uh, for this particular one though, there were 134 games that were run over the event, um, including the, um, uh, incentive and, uh, honk. Honk. That's it.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:44.000
All right. Congrats to the folks at Awesome Games Done Quick for another very successful year. So breaking 3 million is no, I remember when breaking 2 million was the big deal.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:56.000
So the first one was like a few hundred thousand. Yeah. So they've come a long, long way. And that's, I mean, that's, then it's great for great charity. So always love to report on the, the good news, uh, in the gaming world.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:04.000
So let's travel around and check out some world release dates. I don't know if it's a busy week this week, but, uh, it should be starting to pick up again.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:19.000
It's not busy, but it's, it's decent for, uh, January. I mean, so we've got a few things starting off with, uh, Outlier Dust Trilogy, the deluxe pack coming on PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:31.000
We have, uh, Puzzle and Dragon Gold on Nintendo Switch. Uh, we've got Dragon Ball Z, uh, Kakarot on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Uh, Tokyo Mirage, uh, looks like, uh, Sessions Fe Encore. And that's coming out on Nintendo Switch.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:50.000
And then finally, uh, we've got Yakuza Like a Dragon on PlayStation 4. That's it.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:58.000
All right. Going to Japan. It's a little bit of a slower week in Japan as well. Um, on the Nintendo Switch, we have Mysetsu Pure Station comes out this week.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Uh, and then the big release is probably the Tokyo Mirage Sessions, uh, appears to be a world release, uh, this week.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:08.000
So it's also coming out in Japan the exact same day. And that's, that's probably going to be a pretty big deal over there.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Um, but the PlayStation 4, not to be left out, uh, is getting some releases still.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Sangokushi 14 in a regular and treasure box. Uh, a game called the Kandakawa Jet Girls DX Jet Pack is in a regular and limited edition.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Uh, and then Yakuza Like a Dragon is also out there. And Dragon Ball Z Kakarot is out on PlayStation 4 as well.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:35.000
So that's what you have to look forward to in Japan. How about the UK, Dark Sakura?

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Some stuff. So we have, um, Neverwinter Nights Enhanced Edition Collector's Pack.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:52.000
Um, that is on the 16th. We also have Planescape Torment Icewind Dale, same on the 16th, and Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:14:02.000
We also have Creed Rise to Glory on January 16th. For PlayStation, we have Beamdog Ultimate Collector's Pack, which is the first three games I mentioned.

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Tokyo Mirage Sessions FE Encore, um, also on the 16th.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:13.000
Just real quick, the chatters are saying that that hashtag is supposed to be the sharp sign in music, so it's Sharp FE.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:17.000
Sharp? Yeah. Okay. You wouldn't know by looking.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Sessions. So, um, and also, uh, I was reading what was on the description.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:27.000
I know. And Dragon Ball Z Kakarot also on the 16th.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Okay. There's your release dates. So let's go to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com, and we read our favorite emails and our least favorite emails here on the program.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
Do we have any emails tonight? We do. Okay.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:47.000
So, of course, no one has guessed my, um, favorite brand of chocolate.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:53.000
Well, then you can, you can bring the Philz coffee here. I will. Although they don't make it in K-Cups.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:59.000
Philz is all pour over. Um, dear Tangerine Cafe Station.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:08.000
What? I just want to chime in my thoughts regarding the discussion you had about the Nintendo Switch's lackluster interface.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:13.000
There's something I loved about the 3DS, and that was the fact I could open it up to hear Amy Rose's theme,

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:17.000
My Sweet Passion, playing from the speakers with that bubbly pink background.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:21.000
Themes. I was super bummed that these didn't get carried over to the Switch,

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:25.000
and it definitely lets us freshen up the menu to match our own unique tastes.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:30.000
Just look at the PS4 and its wide selection available in the store. It's great.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Currently, I can power on my PS4 to the cool slow jam of Beneath the Mask from Persona 5,

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:42.000
while Makoto looks at me with a judging look like I'm about to be booted off Love Island.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:47.000
I want this same experience on the Switch, and I hope dearest daddy Doug Bowser can make my dreams come true.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Thanks for reading, Garth Wolf.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:55.000
Okay. Your dear daddy, huh?

02:15:55.000 --> 02:16:02.000
Anyway, um, next email is taking a while to load. There we go.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:06.000
Um, actually, yeah, this is, okay, it's the same thing that I was talking about.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:11.000
We just got a release, um, about the Communication Workers of America.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:19.000
So I thought this was, like, a legit email, but this is a marketing email outlining the story that I said earlier.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:23.000
But there are some quotes on here that I would like to read.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:29.000
Companies in the technology and game industries have gotten away with avoiding accountability for far too long.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:33.000
That's according to President Chris Shilton of CWA.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:38.000
Workers in these industries are exposing the reality behind the rhetoric.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:46.000
This initiative will help tech and game companies reach the next level in their efforts to exercise their right to join together and demand change.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Um, so, yeah.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:52.000
But, hey, we got on an official press release. That's pretty impressive.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:55.000
I mean, yeah.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Now, if you want to hire me to be your speaker and do podcasts for you, I'll fucking do it.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:09.000
I do like money, though. So, I mean, I won't do it for free. Just saying.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:13.000
But, yeah, um, that seems to be it for the mailbag.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:21.000
I am really irritated, chatters, that I haven't gotten any more email from you guys because today I was actually excited about reading email.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:24.000
And, yeah.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:27.000
So, where's the rest of my emails?

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:33.000
You haven't guessed? Okay. I need to give y'all another idea of what chocolate I like.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:37.000
I also like your shirt that says that's too much bacon, so no one ever.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:38.000
Loki.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:39.000
Yes.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
Okay.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:46.000
So, my favorite brand of chocolate is an American company.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
I believe they're American.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:57.000
They are fair trade and do not engage in companies that use slavery for their chocolate sourcing.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:01.000
And they are not giardelli.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:07.000
And Rob is a quality human who brought me popcorn.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:11.000
I know. She made me get in the kitchen and cook for her while she was doing the mailbags.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Right.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:13.000
All right.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:16.000
But it's for everybody popcorn.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:17.000
All right.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
This kettle corn, too, is delicious. Sorry, not sorry.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:22.000
Let's move on, Loki. We got some more news still to get to, right?

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:25.000
So, yeah. This is kind of interesting.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:41.000
So, basically, according to Xbox's Matt Booty, he confirmed that for the first party Xbox Series X games, they're not going to be exclusive for at least the first year or two.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:51.000
So, apparently, they said, as our content comes out over the next year or two years, all of the games, sort of like PC, will play up and down the family of devices.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:58.000
We want to make sure that someone invests in Xbox between now and the Series X that they feel that they've made a good investment.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:18.000
Meaning that they're kind of treating this console like a cell phone or a tablet or something like that to where, yeah, it'll play on the Xbox One or Xbox One X, but the fidelity of the graphics and the features may not be as great as, say, the Series X.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:19.000
Here's the thing.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:24.000
I thought that was supposed to be. I thought we already knew that. I thought they had said that some time ago.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
But it's, I think, more of a confirmation.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Yeah, it is a bit of a confirmation, but also, I thought this was going to be the case forever. I didn't think it was just going to be the case for the first year or two.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:37.000
That's what's striking me odd about this news. I just not understand that correctly.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:46.000
I don't know if it's forever because, like with modern devices now, they only support, you know, so far back.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Like, there's certain games that are going to get to a technical point where you can't do that on those systems.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:20:03.000
Maybe necessarily natively, but maybe they'll say, yeah, you can't play this natively on the platform, but we have xCloud that you can stream it, you know, that way.

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
Yeah, I kind of thought that was going to be it.

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:15.000
So it's like, okay, yeah, you might not be able to purchase, say, you know, Halo Infinite 5 or whatever, you know, down the road, but you'll be able to stream it.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:19.000
With xCloud or, you know, who knows, it may be part of Games Pass.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:23.000
Swongtong in chat says, sheesh, with all these studios MS Bot and nothing.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:26.000
I don't think that's quite what we mean when we say exclusives.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:30.000
We're talking about things that will only play on Xbox Series X and not the prior Xbox console.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:33.000
Right, so they'll be exclusive to Microsoft consoles, but they're...

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:40.000
But we already know about Hellblade 2. That is a game that will be exclusive to the Microsoft, you know, and that comes from a studio that Microsoft bought.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Right, so they'll have that, but you'll also be able to play it on Xbox One X.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:55.000
So basically what they're telling you now is like, hey, if you're in the market to get an Xbox One and you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I don't want to buy an Xbox One and then have to turn around and buy an Xbox Series X.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:21:03.000
You're like, well, you know what, don't worry about it because you'll be at least able to play these brand new games for the next few years.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:06.000
You don't have to worry about being kind of shut out of those.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Yeah, I just sort of figured out the... or figured the cloud support would help that go on a much longer forever type of deal.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:28.000
And it might, but like, you know, at some point though, much like the Xbox 360 and stuff, they have to kind of cut out those old systems because they want to do more advanced technical stuff with it and it's just not going to be possible on that kind of hardware.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
It's going to be too old.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:35.000
Shehulk10 says, will not run at max settings on old consoles, 4K HDR.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Yeah, but not everybody is necessarily going to have a 4K TV anyway. I still don't have a 4K TV.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:45.000
So, because I bought a fucking TV right before 4K became really cheap.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:49.000
And so I'm like, God damn it, I'm going to drive that one into the ground.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:57.000
My wife and our father-in-law also just purchased a TV for her mom.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:01.000
So like a 65 inch 4K TV is like 500 bucks.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:05.000
They're like such... they've come down in price.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:10.000
So that thing, they went from a 40 inch to a 65 inch. So it's just like, boom!

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:13.000
It's like, it's huge now.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:18.000
Alright, so yeah, I gotta work on upgrading the TV at some point, we'll see.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Anyway, an interesting report has come out about streaming in the year 2019.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:28.000
So, and I mean like video game streaming, meaning sites like the one you're on right now, Twitch, watching this show.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:33.000
I guess not necessarily because you'd be on the podcast, but for those that are live on Sunday, you're on Twitch, of course.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Which is one of the larger players in the game.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:43.000
Or it could be the rebroadcast, or not rebroadcast, but like, you know, they could be watching the wonderful archives that you...

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Of course.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:45.000
And if you subscribe.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:48.000
Thank you for the cheap plug. Yes, please subscribe, then you can watch all the archives.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
But that is also on Twitch.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:59.000
But an interesting kind of study, talking about data from stream elements and a site called arsenal.gg.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Talking a little bit about some of the game streaming statistics.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Apparently Facebook gaming has been on the rise.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:11.000
December 2019 brought in an 8.5% market share.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:19.000
So that is, yeah, quite a jump in the market share there, compared with 3.1% from the year before.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:28.000
So that's quite the increase, which I got to be honest, I've never watched a Facebook game thing ever.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:32.000
But I've seen it in my feed because Facebook has tried to shove it down my throats.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:33.000
Yes.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
But do you know how I fixed that problem?

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:39.000
I uninstalled the Facebook app from my phone and that was my New Year's thing.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:43.000
And I got to say, I'm only about 11 days in, but it feels fucking great.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:51.000
I'm checking Instagram a lot more, which is funny because that's a Facebook company.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
I darn well know that.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:24:00.000
But as far as the Facebook updates and all that toxic shit that's out there on Facebook, I don't see it as much.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:07.000
I mean, I say as much because I still check on the desktop on the weekends and sometimes at night and stuff.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:12.000
But I'm not continuously hitting the fucking IV for more content.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:13.000
Yeah.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:14.000
And it's cool.

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
I fixed Twitter a little bit by blocking any.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:23.000
And so because any of the advertisements that you see, there are sponsored tweets or whatever, it's always an account.

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
So I block every single one of those accounts I see.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
And I hardly get advertisements.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
You know, Fog has used that in the past, just so you know.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Well, no, but I understand that.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:35.000
But I block all those.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
So I hardly see advertisements anymore.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
Well, we haven't done it since, for what it's worth.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:49.000
But that's a personal choice just because also I'm not thrilled with where Facebook is going and how they're trying to get their hands in every pot.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
And game live streaming is...

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:55.000
I got some email that was like, come stream on Facebook gaming.

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
And I was just like, I think the fuck not.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
So that was that.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:02.000
So cut back on Facebook, you guys.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:03.000
You'll feel so much better.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:06.000
I'm not saying you have to delete it or get rid of it, but just, you know.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
I can't find anything of importance on there anyways.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:12.000
It's usually just advertisements for stuff.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:17.000
That's the thing about how they're supposed to track your activity so that they can advertise to you.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
It's like you're just advertising for things I've already bought.

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:26.000
I don't need a computer desk because I already bought a computer desk for my son.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:27.000
That's already done.

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:32.000
I don't need this stuff. Rollerblades.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:33.000
Anyway, do you know what I did?

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:38.000
I put the icon in its place where Facebook used to be.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:41.000
I put LiveJournal where Facebook used to be.

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:42.000
No, seriously.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:50.000
The first two days, I couldn't tell you how many times just out of habit I tapped that icon and just brought up the LiveJournal login page.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:51.000
And I was like, God damn it.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
I played myself again.

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:57.000
But that's all part of taking the Band-Aid off.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
I'm going back to Tumblr.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
Tumblr? What's on Tumblr these days?

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
Fandom and bunnies and pure things.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:05.000
I like bunnies.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:09.000
Anyway, back to the story which talks about game streaming data.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:13.000
Twitch still has the most hours.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:21.000
They're up to 728 million hours, but their share dropped from 67.1% to 61%.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:31.000
That's still over half, but probably because Twitch is starting to get challenged a little more from companies like Facebook and other companies like YouTube,

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:38.000
which YouTube Gaming, specifically YouTube Gaming, because I think if you were to weigh in all of YouTube, you'd have a lot more,

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:43.000
but they are at 27.9% of the share.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:47.000
And then Mixer has 2.6% of the share.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:50.000
That's up from 2% despite some of the big names.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Oh, I wholly intend to believe that Facebook will get overtaken by Mixer this year.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:26:59.000
Easy.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:00.000
Let's hope.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:04.000
I would watch 50 Mixer streams before I ever watch a Facebook stream.

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
I can't imagine.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:09.000
I just use the Facebook streaming for watching Drag Queen's paint.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:13.000
That's different. That's not gaming streaming anyway.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:18.000
Honestly, I'll watch Drag Queen's painting on YouTube. You can get a lot of that there.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:21.000
I cannot believe I'm eating this whole bowl of popcorn. Thank you.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:22.000
You're welcome.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:31.000
All I ever get is Drag Queen videos in my recommends, because one time I watched a Jake Yonce video,

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:35.000
and now it's, who is going to be exposed tonight?

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:38.000
That is all that comes up on my YouTube recommends.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
I'm about to delete that site too.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:46.000
You don't have to delete it. You can just take those videos and then say, I don't like this, and then it will ask you.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:50.000
But stop letting you do that on YouTube. You can't do that anymore.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:28:00.000
No, I didn't. I did today, because I was, once again, I did research to try to find the perfect TV for my mother-in-law.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:06.000
And we got to the store, and I was giving them my recommendations about the specs, because I did this the whole week and stressed myself out.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
And all they did was like, I like that one!

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:11.000
It's like, fucking hell.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:14.000
But that one, the picture is not as great as that one.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:17.000
I like that one! That one's nice. The picture is nice.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:20.000
The picture is nice. I'm like, fine! I don't care anymore.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:23.000
It's like, okay, whatever.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:30.000
So, I have a bunch of TV review things in my feed, so I clicked on those and I'm like, I don't want to watch this.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:35.000
And then they're like, well, why? And I'm like, I don't want recommendations based on this one video that I watched.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:39.000
And so, it will stop sending that stuff through.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:45.000
And not necessarily get rid of everything, but at least cut down on if you're getting certain types of things.

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
Okay, well, it's good to know. I'll have to remember that for the future.

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
So, all right.

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:56.000
All right, let's move on and talk about, I guess, kind of one of those gaming does a good thing type of stories.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Which I think Jason hinted at in the beginning, actually.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:03.000
Yes, and I was super proud to read this.

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:07.000
So, there was a gamer.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
The gamer, that's all we talked about.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:14.000
His name was Aidan Jackson, a 17-year-old gamer in the UK.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:18.000
And he was talking with an American friend.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:25.000
And apparently his friend heard him go silent on the line.

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:31.000
And the person's name was Dia, by the way.

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:40.000
She, I think it was a she, yeah, said that there wasn't any response on the line.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:43.000
That it sounded really sudden and really terrible.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:54.000
And so, she called emergency, well, she tried to get through to emergency services for his area in the UK.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:59.000
And when she couldn't, she got to non-emergency services and said that she was talking to her friend online.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:04.000
He was unresponsive, but she had the address and was able to direct them.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:08.000
And his parents didn't even know.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:13.000
And so, they didn't know anything about it until the emergency services arrived at the door.

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:17.000
And then they found him unresponsive on the floor, or barely responsive on the floor.

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
He had had a seizure.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:30.000
So, because of an online gamer across the world, they were able to save him from a potentially life-threatening situation.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Yeah, thank you, Internet.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:35.000
Certainly a frightening situation.

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:40.000
And so, her thing says, I'll just read you what she said.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:45.000
I just put my headset back on and I heard what could only be described as a seizure.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:50.000
So, obviously, I started to get worried and immediately started asking what was going on and if he was okay.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:54.000
When he didn't respond, I instantly started to look up the emergency number in the EU.

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:57.000
When that didn't work, I had to hope non-emergency would work.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
It had the option for talking to a real person.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:02.000
And I can't tell you how quickly I clicked that button.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:05.000
So, there you go.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:09.000
I actually do keep a list of emergency services for my international friends.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:14.000
Just because. Just because.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Since Pod Culture brought it up in chat, I will read it.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:19.000
Pod Culture said, here's one thing Facebook was good for.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:23.000
You calling the police for me a couple years ago, this story reminded me of that.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:24.000
I did.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:29.000
There was a status update that I found very concerning and that is the thing that happened.

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:30.000
So, you're right.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:33.000
Sometimes internet friends can help each other out in those types of ways.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:37.000
So, very important and good to know.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:38.000
All right.

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:39.000
Let's move on.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:40.000
Let's talk about.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:44.000
I like this too as far as like classic gaming kind of goes.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Because this is a game inspired by classic game.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:47.000
Exactly.

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:50.000
So, VVV.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:54.000
They released the source code for the game.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:59.000
So, apparently, I believe it was right after the run on AGDQ.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:03.000
Basically saying, hey, guess what?

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:04.000
Surprise.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
It's open source now.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:12.000
So, now you can actually download the code for the game on GitHub and take a look at it.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:19.000
And then there's even some other stuff you can look at in there.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Not necessarily something you want to use if you're trying to make your own custom levels.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:27.000
They have the make and play version of the game, I guess, if you want to do that.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
That might be a little bit easier.

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:32.000
But at least you can kind of tinker around and see how the game was made.

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
So, pretty cool.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:38.000
And if you never played VVVV, it's great.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:39.000
Yeah, you should really do it.

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:40.000
It's been given away free.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:41.000
I don't know how many times.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
You probably have it in some collection or another.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:46.000
But even if you have to pay a couple bucks for it, it's really reasonable.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
So, it's a great game.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:49.000
Really hard.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
Bobby, I guess, took a look at the source code.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
He's in our chat room saying the game was so terribly written.

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
The source code is amazing.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:58.000
Just shows that games are a patchwork of crappy code.

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
And that means your code doesn't have to be perfect.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:01.000
It just has to work.

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:02.000
Ain't that the truth?

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:03.000
Ain't that the truth?

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:04.000
All right.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:08.000
And lastly tonight, before we start to look at our Discord to see if we have any calls,

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:11.000
over at vognetwork.com slash Discord,

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:15.000
has to do with Steam kind of revamping the way that they work soundtracks.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:19.000
So, now you don't have to actually own a video game in order to have the soundtrack

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:25.000
because previously soundtracks were quantified or categorized, I suppose, as DLC.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:26.000
They're taking that away.

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:29.000
So, now it is a soundtrack app type.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:35.000
So, it will let you use a soundtrack and then you can manage that within the Steam library.

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:40.000
And apparently a developer can convert their DLC to soundtrack stuff today.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
And that will work.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:48.000
And then some folks are saying this could mean that technically you could have a game that was exclusive to Epic Store,

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
but they could still sell the soundtrack on Steam.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:53.000
I don't know whether Steam would want to list that or not, but who knows?

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:59.000
I guess it depends on the agreement between all those folks and the publisher.

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:03.000
I went into my Steam library today to see if I had anything that was like soundtracks,

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:04.000
but I didn't see anything yet.

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:07.000
But I'm thinking maybe things just haven't been converted.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
I don't usually buy a lot of standalone soundtracks either,

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:15.000
but I figured I bought enough combo stuff on Steam that probably got, you know what I mean?

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
I had stuff included.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:22.000
Like, you bought the exclusive Year of the Whatever edition that comes with the soundtrack, you know what I mean?

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
But I hadn't seen any of that when I went into my Steam library.

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:28.000
Well, a lot of that stuff that I have with soundtracks tends to be in Humble Store,

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
so I have a ton of soundtracks sitting in there.

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
That's very true.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:37.000
Anyway, the soundtrack feature should debut on January 20th.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
Oh, I see. It's still behind the scenes right now.

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
Maybe that's why I'm not really seeing everything there.

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:44.000
So, right now is the conversions kind of going on behind the scenes.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:47.000
So, maybe you'll see more when that officially launches.

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:50.000
Valve is not turning into a music store or anything like this.

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:55.000
This is just a way for them to kind of put soundtracks in their own category

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
and let them stand on their own,

02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:00.000
as opposed to being a footnote to something that comes with the game.

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:04.000
So, I think that's kind of a nice little change if nothing else.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:07.000
Excuse me.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:08.000
All right.

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:12.000
So, I'm going to check our green room over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:16.000
While I take a peek there, do we want to get into any last-minute stories?

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:17.000
Yes.

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:22.000
Let's talk about Minecraft, School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:30.000
It's a four-year project that brings a Harry Potter-themed RPG to vanilla Minecraft.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:33.000
And it's a project right now that's being supported by Patreon.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:38.000
They're hoping to release it later this month for free.

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:46.000
And it's, I guess, from the Floo Networks, which is a YouTube group.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:47.000
So, interesting.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
They have different stuff you can do in there.

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:53.000
They have different classes, summoning Patronuses.

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:56.000
You can do Quidditch.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:57.000
Looks pretty amazing, actually.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:01.000
I'm all for people seizing Harry Potter and making it their own right now.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:02.000
That's pretty cool.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
With everything that's going out in the world.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:05.000
Right, Dark Sakura?

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
It now belongs to the fans, right?

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:08.000
It belongs to the fans.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:09.000
Just don't give it any money.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
Harry Potter belongs to the fans now.

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:12.000
It looks pretty amazing.

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:13.000
It's a great way to do it.

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Like, it's seriously pretty awesome looking.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:19.000
So, check that out hopefully later this month.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:20.000
I may have to check that out later this month.

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
It looks pretty cool.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
All right, anything else?

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
Ah, that's it.

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:29.000
At least that's all I found.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:32.000
They have stuff on the postage stamps and stuff that didn't make the show roll.

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:33.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:36.000
They're going to have some classic game postage stamps for Royal Mail.

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:37.000
I'm eating popcorn.

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:38.000
It's really good.

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:39.000
So, that was kind of...

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
Is it the best?

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:42.000
That was kind of neat.

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:47.000
I thought it was funny, though, because, well, it's, you know, because it's, you know, the

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Royal Mail, so it's obviously, you know, European games.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:53.000
So, they have like Worms, Dizzy was one of the ones in there.

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:58.000
Like, some of these games that you may not think, well, Dizzy, I know that's not really

02:36:58.000 --> 02:36:59.000
popular over here.

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:03.000
No, but it was a huge, it was either, was it a Commodore game or is that X Spectrum

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:04.000
game?

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:05.000
I don't remember.

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:08.000
But it was, I do know, I know Dizzy.

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:09.000
Dizzy was released here.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:10.000
We have a version of it.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:14.000
It just wasn't as big of a title here as it was in the UK.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:15.000
Right.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:18.000
And then I'm trying to remember the other ones real quick.

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:21.000
I'm trying to pull it up.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:22.000
Let's see.

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
I don't know.

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:28.000
It was just a few games, but I'm surprised they haven't done anything like that over

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:29.000
here yet.

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:34.000
Like, any sort of, like, have they done any classic gaming stamps over here?

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:37.000
No, ours really tend to be people.

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
Aren't there like Pac-Man ones?

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:40.000
There might have been.

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:43.000
I feel like there might have been, like, some 80s ones, but, um, well, you can make your

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:46.000
own damn stamp in this day and age, you know?

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:47.000
Yeah, right.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:48.000
Okay.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:49.000
Well, okay.

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:50.000
So they have, let's see here.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:51.000
So it looks like it is...

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
Tomb Raider, Worms, and other...

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:54.000
Elite.

02:37:54.000 --> 02:38:03.000
They've got Sensible Soccer, Wipeout, Dizzy, Worms, Lemmings, Micro Machines, and Populous.

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
Those are all very, like, UK-developed games.

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:08.000
So it's a pretty good list to use there.

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:09.000
I like that.

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:10.000
So.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:11.000
And apparently, they were...

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:18.000
It says the chosen franchises were nominated by the British gaming body, Yuki, and they

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:19.000
were...

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
Let's see.

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:29.000
As well as, apparently, they had the Mean Machines editor-journalist Julian Jazz Ragnell,

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:37.000
and author Sam Dyer, who put together some gaming compendiums like Commodore 64, a visual

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:41.000
compendium, and the Metal Slug, The Ultimate History.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:45.000
Now, my next question is, when was the last time any of you sent a piece of mail?

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:49.000
I actually send cards regularly to my mother.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:50.000
Oh, that's...

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:51.000
Okay.

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:52.000
I get that.

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:53.000
And to other people.

02:38:53.000 --> 02:39:06.000
So it looks like there were some stamps for the US that were designed and approved, but

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:07.000
not set up.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:10.000
Here's another thing I was going to talk about.

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:11.000
Wait, I have something.

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Can I have...

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:13.000
I want to hear a story.

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
No, I think this one's important, actually.

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:21.000
Because Infinity Ward announced this week that they will be donating the proceeds of,

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:25.000
for Call of Duty Modern Warfare, there is an Outback pack that is coming out.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Well, what do we need to be thinking about?

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:30.000
We're thinking about the Outback right now, those horrific wildfires that are going on

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:31.000
all over Australia.

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
Like, it is bad, you guys.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:38.000
So 100% of the net proceeds from Activision's Outback pack.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
So that's kind of neat.

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:41.000
Yeah, that's neat.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
Yeah, especially for such a cause that's so...

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:44.000
Ugh.

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
Hoping all my friends down there are safe.

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:50.000
Another thing that was shown off at CES this year was some new PCs by Origin.

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:57.000
And so what makes these kind of unique is they, this is kind of a following up their

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
PC called the Big O.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:05.000
So it's basically a computer and console built into one tower.

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:12.000
So you have the PlayStation 4 Pro and then the Xbox One's sad.

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:15.000
Is it guaranteed to give you a Big O?

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:16.000
Maybe.

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
No, but it's actually got some pretty cool stuff.

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:22.000
So they have, not only on the PC side do they have an actual PC and everything, but they

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
also have a capture card.

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:31.000
So you can stream your console games and capture with one box, which is kind of cool.

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
The problem is, though, is the price is pretty expensive.

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:39.000
So you've got, it's $2,500 is what it starts at.

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:40.000
Alright.

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:41.000
That's neat, I guess.

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:42.000
Alright.

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:45.000
Well, no calls are waiting to come in and that's okay because we've run a little long

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:46.000
tonight.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:47.000
What a shock.

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:50.000
So I think we're getting ready to wrap up shop here tonight.

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:54.000
Thank you guys, of course, for tuning in tonight, staying up late with us.

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:57.000
And if you're listening on the podcast feed, hey, you are wonderful too.

02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:00.000
I do want to remind everybody, no show next week.

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:01.000
We're not even going to tape something in advance.

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
We're giving ourselves a week off.

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:09.000
And I think, I don't want to sound cocky or egotistical, but I think we deserve it.

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
We worked through the holidays.

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:12.000
We had a show every week during the holidays.

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:16.000
So we're going to take our holiday a little late this year.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:19.000
But excuse me, sorry, popcorn kernel.

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:23.000
But speaking of holiday, let's not forget Martin Luther King Jr.

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:26.000
because we're getting a long weekend because of that.

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:30.000
So just, you know, you might want to take a minute to just kind of reflect on what the

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:35.000
things he had to say might mean for you and what you can do to help live out that dream.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:40.000
But we'll be back to do that again in two weeks or to do our show again in two weeks.

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:45.000
And I'm hoping, I don't want to over promise and deliver, but I'm hoping we're going to

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:52.000
have some fun little changes in the next couple of weeks and really bring OLR into 2020.

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:55.000
So Orange Laundry, Orange Laundry for a new decade.

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:59.000
Well, it took us how long to get out of 1995?

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:00.000
What year is it?

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:03.000
It's not 1995 still.

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:06.000
Of course, everyone knows I'm talking about the computer.

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:07.000
All right.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
Yeah, well, oh, this computer?

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:10.000
The last one.

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:11.000
It's on XP.

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:12.000
Oh, XP.

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:13.000
Yeah.

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
So out of 2002.

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:16.000
Yeah.

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:17.000
Yeah.

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:18.000
All right.

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:21.000
So we will not be back next week, but we will be back in two weeks.

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
And we look forward to seeing you all then.

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:24.000
So you know what that means?

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:27.000
This week, gaming news is going to blow the fuck up.

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
So hold on and look out, everybody.

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
Hold on to your pants.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:35.000
But we hope everybody has a good week and happy gaming and all that good stuff.

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
If you liked what you heard here at Orange Laundry Radio, tell a friend about the show

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:43.000
But if the voices aren't here to put on air, then we're stuck.

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:48.000
So get more people and a nice five star review on a site like iTunes goes an awful long way.

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
And we really appreciate it.

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:54.000
So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts and check on out of here.

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
So Dark Soccer, I know you're ready for a nap.

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
So I am super freaking tired.

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:01.000
Like it's just with everything going on.

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
I have to go back to work tomorrow.

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
Real life is happening again.

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
Just oh, my God, I'm tired.

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:08.000
Fair enough.

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
Do you have an official final thought or?

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:11.000
Oh, my God, I'm tired.

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:12.000
OK.

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:15.000
My final thought tonight is kettle corn.

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
Yum. Thanks, Dark Soccer.

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
I'm glad I didn't get all stuck in my teeth.

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:20.000
That's why I always don't like eating.

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
I had to pick a half a kernel out of my gums, though.

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
That was freaking weird.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
It's like the tooth armor no one wants.

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:29.000
I almost always, always have to like after eating popcorn,

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:34.000
like go get my vibrating toothbrush and get everything out of there or actually pleasure your mouth.

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:35.000
The vibe.

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:40.000
I will tell you what has changed my life in that regard is, though, the water pick that shoots the water.

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
But nothing gets stuck.

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
So I just use those little flossers.

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
You know, a lot of people do that, too.

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
Last but not least, Loki, your final thought.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:51.000
I can't wait to get my rollerblades this week.

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:56.000
I ordered. OK, so like I ordered about nineteen ninety five.

02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:03.000
Well, I wanted my kids got skates, so I wanted to get new new blades in because I used to.

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:07.000
Technically, it's in landscape, so whatever.

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:12.000
So I used to rollerblade a ton when I was, you know, in high school and all that.

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
And I still do pretty well with it.

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:19.000
So I decided to get a fancy pair of skates from France.

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:29.000
And they're only sold they don't sell them here because like people that take rollerblading seriously.

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
Not in this country.

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:36.000
So I had to import it from Canada and they only come in European sizes.

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:42.000
So my dumb ass decided to try to measure my foot correctly and ordered them.

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
And I did.

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:47.000
And I even increased the size and they were too small.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:50.000
And then I looked at my shoe and I'm like, son of a bitch.

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
There's European sizes in my shoe.

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:56.000
I could have ordered the fucking correct size in the first place.

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:57.000
So I had to do all that crap.

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:58.000
At least they were pretty good.

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:01.000
They shipped it back for free.

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
They cross shipped the other one.

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:04.000
So I'll get them this week.

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:05.000
But I was so disappointed.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
I want to go bleeding this weekend.

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:10.000
Be curious to get my Vibrams.

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:13.000
Have a good time at the broccoli farm.

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
Have a good time in San Francisco.

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
And I will have a good time at the musical.

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:18.000
So everybody have a good time.

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
You have a good time out there.

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:23.000
No matter what it is you're doing this week, even if you're just sitting on your butt playing games all week.

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
I hope those games are awesome.

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:28.000
We will see you in 14 days to do this all over again.

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
Until then, have a great week everybody.

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:31.000
Good night.

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:59.000
But you know they were all still true.

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
See you next week.

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:28.000
Thank you.
