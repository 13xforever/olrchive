7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	20000	This week it's the year of Super Baseball 2020 and in the timeline of reality we're still trying to get automated calls of balls and strikes into the MLB.
20000	23000	Never forget about the veracity of those resistance change.
23000	28000	It's been a quiet week but we'll share what we can starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	38000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
38000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with the first show of the year, January the 5th, 2020, episode number 805.
45000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me, as you can see on Twitch TV, is Loki.
50000	54000	Yes, they can't really see you really well. I have a Double Dare shirt on.
54000	57000	Oh, you have to stand up and model it at some point. When you're done eating your salad I see you're-
57000	58000	It's fine.
58000	59000	Very healthy choices in 2020.
59000	62000	Not really, it's a Caesar salad so it's not that-
62000	70000	It is healthier, it is- I could have gotten pizza but the salad- they have this promotion going on at Mod Pizza where-
70000	73000	Hold up, don't name them if they ain't paying us.
73000	82000	At a pizza place that has an app that if you buy up to four salads in the month of January you get four salads free in February.
82000	88000	So I was like, okay, sure, their salad was alright the first time I had so I've been- actually I've had like four of these already this week so-
88000	93000	I mean, it's good, they're a little on the pricey side but it's hard to get a good salad because-
93000	98000	And I will name them because their salads suck. Subway? Not-
98000	100000	No, not-
100000	106000	I'm with you, there's some places that very clearly just put like the stale lettuce in a bowl and like throw it with other stuff.
106000	107000	It is not-
107000	108000	You gotta have the right mix, you do.
108000	109000	Not good.
109000	113000	On a more serious note, not joining us tonight is Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
113000	118000	Unfortunately, and some of you that follow her on social media may have heard, her mother-in-law passed away.
118000	125000	So for those of you that know Dan, because he's been on the show, those of you who've been listening a long time, that would be Dan's mom passed away this past week.
125000	133000	So as you can imagine, just there's a lot going on and Dark Sakura kind of needs to be there for Dan and the whole family right now.
133000	140000	So definitely our thoughts are with her and sending Dan, of course, and sending that whole family some warmth and vibes.
140000	147000	And we're expecting that she'll be back next week but certainly they can take all the time that they're gonna need for that situation.
147000	149000	So again, our thoughts go out to them.
149000	153000	Because of that, we had teased a few things on last week's show.
153000	161000	We talked about doing the time capsule tonight and doing the games of the year tonight because this week was expected to be another slow news week.
161000	166000	But I think you'll all understand that I want to put that off another week so that Dark Sakura can be here to participate in that segment.
166000	169000	So we're gonna make do tonight with what little news there is.
169000	176000	There isn't a lot, I almost feel like in some ways the news this week is almost lighter than it was last week.
176000	178000	Well, how was your New Year's? Let me ask that.
178000	184000	It was alright. We kept the kids up until nine so they could watch the ball drop thing.
185000	189000	And the only nine o'clock feed of the ball drop that we had was CNN.
189000	192000	And they're terrible. Anderson Cooper is just not...
192000	194000	It's not the same without category.
194000	196000	It's not good at all.
196000	201000	Their bits that they were doing were just like, it was really cringey.
201000	205000	And I was like, okay, no, we're not watching this.
205000	213000	Because we'd flipped it to them, they were reading Goodnight 2019 and thinking that Goodnight Moon in the book and stuff.
213000	220000	And it was awful. So we just kept flipping between that and the Food Network until it finally did the countdown and then that was it.
220000	225000	I fell asleep at 1130. I was feeling some sort of way because I'm like, nobody's having a party this year.
225000	228000	But then you have to remember, well, I could have had a party, but I don't want to clean.
228000	234000	And then it's like, it's a Tuesday night. It's one of the worst nights to have a big celebration.
234000	241000	Next year will be better because I think next year Christmas and New Year's fall on a Friday. So that'll be fine.
241000	250000	Yeah. Anyway, we're going to get into what news there is this week. I do want to mention, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at The Voice of Geeks Network.
250000	255000	vog.network.com. That's vognetwork.com. Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
255000	261000	We started about six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern. Right after, of course, our friend Bobby.
261000	264000	I know there's a lot going on tonight, too. Tonight just feels awesome.
264000	265000	Golden Globes.
265000	269000	I know the Golden Globes are going on tonight, which I don't really care about award shows anymore.
269000	274000	Like I used to be that guy that, you know, got all excited about the Oscars.
274000	278000	Then I started doing this show and it's like it was my Sunday nights and then I don't go to the movies as much.
278000	283000	So it's like, oh, these movies got nominated. I didn't see any of them, you know.
283000	290000	And the Globes especially are just weird because it's only what the group is like, not even 90 people that vote on those things.
290000	294000	There was that great email. I think it was from Flocko. I hope I'm not misattributing that.
294000	301000	But there was a great email that was comparing the video game awards to the Golden Globes because it's a very small committee that actually votes on them.
301000	305000	So it's kind of kind of interesting comparison there. Those are on the night, of course.
305000	308000	Awesome Games Done Quick is right now.
308000	314000	And I can completely understand if you're you're watching that instead of this tonight, because it's a great charity event.
314000	317000	You know, it happens a couple of times a year. People are really excited about that.
317000	321000	I know some people have told me I have O.L.R. in one window and Awesome Games in the other muted.
321000	326000	And it's like, whatever. And then many people, of course, are listening on the podcast feed because they were doing something else live on Sunday.
326000	332000	Yeah, if it's if for me, like Awesome Games Done Quick is great to watch when you can live.
332000	336000	But I just mostly catch up on that stuff when it hits YouTube.
336000	339000	Yeah. When they when they segment. That's true. They archive everything as well.
339000	345000	So, yeah, because that is for me, like sometimes like I can see them till three in the morning to watch like a Taskbot slot or something like that,
345000	349000	even though that would be pretty awesome. I can't do that.
349000	356000	So I'm looking at some of the comments in chat because, again, we take a big thank you to despite everything else going on live tonight.
356000	360000	And I know it's like the last day of holiday break for like students and, you know, many.
360000	365000	So is this a lot going on tonight? But a big shout out to those of you that are joining us in chat.
365000	371000	Let's see. Misty O.L.R. says, I deliberately went to bed before midnight, even though I didn't really have to get up until about 8 a.m.
371000	375000	Yeah, I was I just at some point I was like, what's the point in staying up?
375000	380000	I'll just say Happy New Year, Alan, and then go to bed. And I love the way Alan put it.
380000	385000	Alan wrote an Instagram story later that night that put 2020 can wait for me.
385000	391000	Good night. And I'm like, I like that. I'm going to use that one and explaining it to people.
391000	397000	And then Tiger saying, sadly, I have to go back to work tomorrow. So I'll miss most of the day coverage of awesome games done quick.
397000	403000	But we'll watch the rest of the live streaming after work. Yeah. So I'm sure there's a lot of people going back to work and all that good stuff tomorrow.
403000	410000	As that says, because the show is shorter tonight, we should do a half hour of O.P.R. live on stream or Niantic Wayfarer.
410000	415000	Is that I'm trying to you and I got to do a YouTube on that stuff. We should I be down for that.
415000	419000	I don't I don't have it all set up to stream like the window and all that stuff.
419000	424000	So I need prep. I need prep time and make something that you just bring up a Web page in there.
424000	428000	It's not that it's take take me too long to futz around there live. So it's fine.
428000	433000	Oh, yeah. We'll do it. I want to do the YouTube thing. You can watch that on demand whenever you want.
433000	438000	So. All right. We'll get into our gaming weeks in a little bit so we can talk about what video games we've been playing throughout the new year.
438000	443000	But first, we're going to talk about one of the big news stories to kind of hit in the past few days.
443000	448000	And that is a leak of sorts of the Final Fantasy 7 demo.
448000	452000	So it seems like it is confirmed that there will be a Final Fantasy 7.
452000	455000	We all know I'm talking about the remake. I'm not talking about a game from the 90s.
455000	460000	The Final Fantasy 7 remake demo. There was rumors that one existed.
460000	467000	And now there very clearly is one because there is video evidence of one being played in multiple places.
467000	473000	Loki, how are they getting this demo? Because you can't you can't go on to the PlayStation Store, at least not tonight, and get that demo.
473000	475000	Maybe by the time some of you hear they have.
475000	481000	But there's now there's different things for like modded systems or whatever to download updates and patches and whatnot.
481000	485000	So they have a certain file structure to how they store everything on the storefront.
485000	493000	A lot of it has that PlayStation ID with the system and then the catalog ID for the actual piece of software.
493000	501000	So they could find out what the idea is for the demo and basically find the page for it, even though it's not listed on the storefront.
501000	507000	And so using a third party tool that they design could download the demo to their system and play it.
508000	513000	All right. So did you know you didn't you didn't watch any of the demo? I haven't watched any of it.
513000	516000	Well, how convenient, because I've got all right here.
516000	522000	But before I click the button to start it, because I know some people are very hypersensitive to spoilers, especially when it comes to the Final Fantasy universe.
522000	524000	I am going to warn you, I'm going to play some of the leaked footage.
524000	531000	I'm only going to play the very beginning of it, the actual what it would be akin to the opening movie.
531000	536000	This cuts off when the player takes over as cloud. And that's about as much as I allowed myself.
536000	540000	So this is literally the first two minutes after pressing start.
540000	545000	If that is still a problem for you, you may want to avert your eyes and ears for about two minutes while I bring this up.
545000	551000	So here is, if you haven't already seen it for yourself, some of the leaked footage from the Final Fantasy 7 remake demo.
551000	552000	And you can see...
552000	554000	I'm pretty sure some of this has been in trailers, too.
554000	556000	Yeah. Oh, I'm sure many people have seen this in trailers.
556000	565000	But now you actually kind of get to see it in motion, which I think is very interesting, because then I start comparing what I'm looking at here and like the opening shot of Aerith's eyes.
565000	569000	You know, and kind of the the life, you know, stream kind of pouring out here.
569000	575000	I kind of start to compare this to, oh, what I remember in Final Fantasy 7 when I first played it.
575000	576000	That's how I remembered it.
576000	577000	Yeah.
577000	579000	It wasn't like that, though.
579000	581000	What's interesting. Yeah, it definitely did not look this good.
581000	583000	In my mind, it did.
583000	587000	What's interesting about the leaked footage is that, OK, it mixes with some of those memories in the original.
587000	589000	You remember that she walked out onto the street and all that.
590000	592000	But then it gets into a sequence. This wasn't in the...
592000	599000	Because how did they render people bumping into her and like actually stepping on a flower and all this stuff?
599000	600000	That was a cut scene. It was...
600000	602000	Was it? I don't remember it. I don't remember.
602000	608000	But then I definitely don't remember that it very faintly plays One-Wing Angel in the back.
608000	609000	That I don't remember.
609000	613000	Yeah, you hear that. If you listen very, very carefully, you can actually hear some of the chorus from that.
614000	622000	And then, you know, you see a lot of the familiar stuff where it's zooming out into the world and the music sounds phenomenal.
622000	626000	I know it's very hard to hear in the studio and it's down way low so you guys can hear us.
626000	629000	But the music in this sounds really phenomenal.
629000	630000	It looks great.
630000	631000	Yeah, it really does.
631000	638000	I mean, it looks like... You remember when they had like a PlayStation 3 concept thing that did this very similar type of opening?
638000	642000	It's like even better than that, obviously, because now we're looking at a PlayStation 4.
642000	644000	Someday PlayStation 5 game, yeah.
644000	651000	And then I think what's also interesting is that when the logo comes up on the screen, it actually does call it Final Fantasy VII Remake.
651000	655000	It doesn't call it Final Fantasy VII, it calls itself the Final Fantasy VII Remake.
655000	659000	So, which, I mean, I know that's what the game is called, but I was just surprised it didn't stick with...
659000	661000	It's just Final Fantasy VII, it's still that story.
661000	664000	And then the big zoom in with the train cut-ins, like it's just...
664000	669000	It almost gives me goosebumps to see like the exact same type of like cuts here.
669000	673000	So, anyway, that's about, yeah, that's about as far as I went with it there.
673000	677000	So, the rest, you'll have to wait until that demo is officially released.
677000	678000	Probably soon.
678000	685000	Yeah, I'm assuming if people are already kind of backdooring into the store to get it, they might have set it up before the holidays.
685000	689000	So that way when, you know, everybody's back in the office next week, come Thursday or so, or whenever this holiday...
689000	691000	When's the holiday sale over?
691000	692000	Well, they tend to...
692000	693000	Probably when it's going up.
694000	700000	I believe that they're updating everything on Thursday, because Thursday is usually when they do the updates for like PlayStation Plus and all that stuff.
700000	704000	So, maybe that'll be like, throw it up there for everybody at the same time.
705000	707000	Yeah. So, how did you feel about seeing that?
707000	708000	It looks good.
708000	709000	Doesn't it?
709000	715000	Like, and it's interesting because for all the, why are they remaking VII out of all the games they could have remade?
715000	716000	Why are they doing VII?
716000	719000	And, you know, all that stuff, I'm like, dang, the more...
719000	721000	I can't wait for VI to be remade that way.
721000	722000	I wish, I wish.
722000	728000	The more and more I see the footage from Final Fantasy VII and I see the game, I'm like, dang, this looks like it's gonna be better.
728000	729000	Like, it really is.
729000	730000	It does. It's like pretty awesome.
730000	735000	I'm just, I'm like, the battle system, even though they completely changed it, it looks like 15 but fun.
735000	737000	Don't they still have the old battle system in there?
737000	739000	Don't they have like a turn-based battle system in there as well?
739000	742000	Yeah, I think it was like 15 where you can kind of flip it either way.
742000	747000	You can do a live one or you can do an active time type of thing.
747000	748000	Yeah.
748000	749000	Yeah. Gonna be very interesting.
750000	753000	Ezet in chat says, please tell me we can skip summon cutscenes.
753000	755000	Knights of the Round, OMG.
755000	756000	Probably.
756000	760000	I can't see how that isn't a thing but summons are also gonna be different because aren't you summoning them onto the battlefield?
760000	765000	Like, it wasn't like it was in VII where they just did one attack and that was it.
765000	768000	Like, didn't they show some stuff from E3?
768000	769000	I don't remember.
769000	773000	I want to say they showed a bit with Efreet and he actually kind of like takes over the battle.
773000	775000	It's similar to XII.
775000	777000	I don't remember.
777000	779000	Kind of what that looked like anyway.
779000	780000	So.
780000	782000	But I imagine they've learned their lesson.
782000	787000	They did add a skip summon thing to the Final Fantasy X remaster.
787000	794000	So I can't imagine they didn't learn that lesson for Final Fantasy VII when they redo that.
794000	801000	One other thing we should talk about when it comes to Final Fantasy VII isn't quite related to the same demo leak.
801000	802000	Well, no, I guess it is.
802000	808000	Because some folks, now that the demo's leaked, they're going in and they are tearing apart the files.
808000	816000	In fact, apparently a rough version of what does cross-dressing cloud in that one sequence in the game, that is out there now.
816000	821000	So if you're trying to keep that a secret, you might want to, you know, just be careful what you look up in the next couple months.
821000	829000	But also, they've been tearing through those files and they found that the Final Fantasy VII remake apparently is going to be coming to PC.
829000	832000	There are many signs in the demo that a PC port is coming.
832000	837000	There is PC code still left inside and it mentions higher resolutions with Nvidia and AMD stuff.
837000	841000	Well, I bet those higher resolutions are going to be a PlayStation 5 thing as well.
841000	844000	Wait for it. Wait for it. I bet that's what happens.
844000	850000	This comes out on PlayStation 4 in March and then at some point, probably before the next, you know, chapter of the remake,
850000	855000	we're going to see a PlayStation 5 and then that's also going to be like when it comes out on PC and all that stuff.
855000	857000	I think that almost seems like a given at that point.
857000	864000	So would you be more interested in playing this? Are you going to, knowing that that is a factor,
864000	866000	I'm kind of curious with this in chat as well.
866000	873000	Are you going to wait for Final Fantasy VII on a PC environment or nah, I'm going to jump in on PS4.
873000	879000	No, PS4 because my PC is not going to be able to push. I don't have a monitor that's 4K.
879000	887000	I don't have, you know, the hardware that can push something that nice looking.
887000	894000	So I would think picking it up on PlayStation 4 because most likely when it does come out on PlayStation 5,
894000	899000	I'm sure there'll be something, hey, you own the PlayStation 4 version. It's a free upgrade because it's digital or whatever.
899000	901000	And so I'll just do that.
901000	907000	Cool. Sounds good. I am, yeah, I'm just going to buy it on PlayStation 4 because I can't wait.
908000	912000	I can't, I, you know, I have no problem buying games multiple times.
912000	914000	Oh no, I can only buy it once.
914000	918000	Yeah, no, I'll buy it on PlayStation 4 and then I won't get the PC one right away.
918000	923000	I'll wait till it like goes on sale, but we're talking a couple of years out of the year, many years out at this point.
923000	927000	It's going to be just think in the scope of this year, but by the end of the year,
927000	935000	we're going to be talking in terms of PlayStation 5, X, XX and like all this different stuff is going to be just in the scope of a year.
935000	941000	So, all right. Well, anyway, I hope you guys are as excited from S7 Remake as I am.
941000	946000	So let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing this week.
946000	949000	So, Loki, we'll start with you, even though we were talking a little bit about this before the show.
949000	955000	Well, I haven't been playing much of Pokemon Go and Minecraft Earth,
955000	962000	although I did play a little bit Minecraft Earth the other day because I want to just do more of the adventure stuff.
962000	966000	I don't play it too much because it drains my phone battery like a ton.
966000	973000	And especially if like I'm out, usually we'll have like a dead period of time between when my son does his coding class,
973000	975000	we go to lunch to when he has his piano class.
975000	983000	And so some of that time may be going to a park and then usually I'll do the, you know, AR stuff there for Minecraft.
983000	991000	And so I didn't want to use it too much because I still want to have battery power left so I can play other games while he's doing his piano lessons.
992000	1004000	But I've been playing Orna all week and so I'm up to level 80 now and I'm playing as a rogue right now.
1004000	1010000	And yeah, so that's pretty much been my week is just Orna.
1010000	1016000	Why are so many OLR people, and for those watching on Twitch, yes, that is Mr. Smoosh towards the bottom of your screen.
1016000	1027000	And he keeps, he's looking at the TV. He's looking at us on the TV because we have a, we have a television that's over here where you can actually see everything so we can see the output, what's going up to the stream.
1027000	1034000	And Mr. Smoosh is enthralled with watching us on the TV, even though we're right here in front of him.
1034000	1037000	It's just really funny. I don't understand. Anyway.
1037000	1044000	He's like, wait a second. Wait, you're right here. But you're up there too. What is going on? I don't understand.
1045000	1052000	Why do you think so many people that are listening to OLR when I bring up this Orna game are like getting into it and getting obsessed?
1052000	1063000	Because it's a game unlike Pokemon Go and like Pokemon Go and Minecraft Earth or Ingress and stuff like that.
1063000	1071000	When you're playing those AR games, it is focused a lot on being able to go out and go to different places like you're really limited interest.
1071000	1077000	You're really limited to what you can do in the game just sitting at your house.
1077000	1088000	Whereas Orna, you could sit there and play as long as you can on there and you can level up like I have to level 80 or whatever just by playing the game constantly.
1089000	1100000	So it's kind of cool also because like, say, there are like a lot of locations that are around my neighborhood that I assume people have put down, but I don't know.
1100000	1102000	Some of that may be generated by the game as well.
1102000	1108000	You can, if you tap on something, look in the corner because it'll say who did it.
1108000	1116000	But I don't know if it's like somebody actually did it or if it's like a randomly generated NPC character that owner of the shop or whatever.
1116000	1127000	Well, OK, so not to get too far into my gaming week, but I was playing a little bit of Ingress this week and we were doing what we call an op, which means we were throwing a very big field, which took a lot of people.
1127000	1133000	And for me, I had to go out to the middle of nowhere to do my part about 30 minutes outside of town.
1133000	1138000	So I was sitting in pitch black and, you know, I can't sit there and play Ingress or anything.
1138000	1140000	I have to kind of wait for, you know, things to happen.
1140000	1145000	I want to say too much about how that works, but I wanted to do something.
1145000	1152000	So I brought up Orna and I'm literally in the middle of nowhere and there were still things to kill and a blacksmith right on top of where I was at.
1152000	1154000	So I was like, well, this is kind of funny.
1154000	1158000	So I can't imagine anyone willingly built a blacksmith out there.
1158000	1159000	So there definitely is.
1159000	1160000	Yeah, I'm sure there's some of that.
1160000	1173000	But so that's that's what's kind of nice is like, say, for example, like when I first started off, I could see an item shop on my screen, but it was a lot of times it was out of range or the way where it is,
1173000	1176000	is like right below my player icon at the bottom of the screen.
1176000	1182000	So I can't tap around it because the hitbox for that is overlapping where the item shop is.
1182000	1187000	So I'm like, this is annoying, but like I could walk out, you know, in front of my house and hit it from there.
1187000	1191000	But so I say, OK, whatever, I'm just going to build one in which you can do that.
1191000	1196000	You can build your own like points of interest, I guess, on the map by your house.
1196000	1199000	And then there's other things around, too.
1199000	1205000	So like, you know, whereas I wanted to get, you know, upgrade my weapons, you have to do that blacksmith shop.
1205000	1207000	So there's one down the street for me I can go to.
1207000	1213000	But it's not always convenient if I want to play at home to do that or like, oh, crap, I didn't drive by it to pick up my equipment.
1213000	1216000	Now I have to use some other equipment instead.
1216000	1221000	So you can, you know, focus yourself on the game and you can actually spend.
1221000	1228000	You know, resources to build one of those places nearby and you can share with everybody or you can just keep it to yourself.
1228000	1232000	Yeah. And as that in chat says, tell them about my house. Nine shops.
1232000	1243000	Yes. No, he but she's pointing a neon light on where she lives, because if you go I don't want to say if you go to the neighborhood that direction across and you drive around, you're going to look for a big cluster.
1243000	1248000	And I'll be like, oh, is that lives here? But she doesn't technically have to make those all public.
1248000	1251000	Oh, only party members can see. Yeah, there's you'll see it.
1251000	1255000	So, yeah, you can you can know that. Yeah, you can create that.
1255000	1261000	You can create your your shop so that they're only you can see it or only your party members can see it.
1261000	1267000	So you don't have to. That actually makes me feel a lot better because I don't want certain people knowing where I live.
1267000	1270000	So I don't want to build a bunch of that stuff. But if you can hide it. Yeah, you can hide it.
1270000	1274000	It's really easy. Yeah. The friends I'm in a party with, they all know where I live. So that's fine.
1274000	1281000	OK. Yeah. So, yeah, it's pretty cool. So that's what I like about it is like that you can play it constantly and do stuff in there.
1281000	1290000	The only time that you might want to drive around a lot is if you're really trying to hit like those daily quests where you have to kill certain types of creatures, because a lot of times they may not spawn by your house.
1290000	1294000	That's what Bobby's complaining about is so far I haven't been able to complete the boss quest yet.
1294000	1299000	I don't know if this will help, but if you tap on the name of the city in the upper right, is that where it is?
1299000	1306000	It actually shows you nearby bosses that you can kill to take over territory. And so you might find what you're looking for in there.
1306000	1312000	But I usually just I actually the nice thing about the game for me, I take a walk around the neighborhood and I don't have to go by the pokey stops.
1312000	1316000	I can have Orna up and I still have something to do. So I don't know.
1316000	1322000	Yeah. And what else? Doing the arenas for me is a lot of experience as well.
1322000	1327000	And sometimes it's pretty easy because the people that they pair you with can't do damage to you.
1327000	1330000	But then again, the reverse is possible as well.
1330000	1334000	And somebody was asking, PixelPaka says, does health regen over time? Yes.
1334000	1339000	And if you're a mage, you get a thing that lets you regen mana as you walk.
1339000	1348000	And that's also nice. That's part of why I like it is because even if an NPC kills you, you're just a ghost at zero health, but you'll regen health over time.
1348000	1352000	It's not a big deal. You're not like you don't lose XP. You're not like run back to your grave.
1352000	1357000	You earn so much money doing different things. Like I don't end up spending a lot of stuff in the item shops.
1357000	1365000	So I I'll sell back some things to the item shops that I can't.
1365000	1371000	That the materials that I would, you know, transform them into aren't really useful to me.
1371000	1374000	So I'll sell back a lot of stuff to the item shop and then I can buy health potions.
1374000	1379000	So I have like a stack of one hundred and forty five health potions right now that I just keep using over and over.
1379000	1385000	Plus I'm, you know, buying an item shop, you know, at my house so I can just keep buying this up if I need it.
1385000	1392000	Or an inn or whatever. So really, you know, there's not a whole lot.
1392000	1396000	Or the other thing too, familiars. So like you can get a pet.
1396000	1404000	Like I have a fairy that will occasionally cast a heal spell on me that raises, gives me a hundred hit points.
1405000	1411000	Although I noticed in the arena somebody had a fairy to where it's only supposed to be twenty five percent of the time that does it.
1411000	1416000	But it's like I just noticed it like for like a good 10 turns in a row. That fairy has healed you.
1416000	1420000	That's a little super fairy, a little B.S. right there. But wow.
1420000	1424000	Well, anyway, these boy, we've been given quite the plug to this game.
1424000	1429000	So, yeah, but it seems like a lot of people that have been listening to show been downloading it and kind of into it.
1429000	1433000	It kind of, you know, kind of fills the GPS niche if you're a little burned out.
1433000	1437000	It's good for like when you're in between like stops or whatever.
1437000	1444000	And it's great because like if you are like in a place that's remote, that doesn't have a lot of things nearby.
1444000	1449000	I mean, you can still have a lot of fun with it without because it's not generate.
1449000	1454000	They don't generate stuff at points of interest like Pokemon Go where it's a specific locations.
1454000	1458000	It's just kind of randomly everywhere. So, yeah.
1458000	1462000	All right. There you go. Orna been taking over a lot of time. Anything else you're giving me?
1462000	1470000	That's pretty much it. Well, actually, no, there was a game I played called Wrecked that I got for technically free on the e-shop.
1470000	1477000	So my kids want it. I just thought I'd get it for my kids. It's a you remember it's time the car.
1477000	1481000	I know you remember that. So I don't know. It never came out. Yeah.
1481000	1490000	Well, the the driving portion of that, the engine that's kind of middleware, I guess I was using for that.
1490000	1500000	I recognize a lot in these different games that they put out because the people are very lazy and they don't replace the turbo and the the brake sounds that are in the game.
1500000	1510000	And so, for example, this one, it's basically a game where you drive cars and you do stunts and tricks and you earn points and then the points unlock more cars.
1510000	1514000	And that's it. That's basically the game. It was a buck ninety nine.
1514000	1520000	So I had like 200 gold coins or whatever in the game. So it's like, oh, free. Cool. And my kids are loving it.
1520000	1525000	And I did get to play a little bit. It's kind of fun. But I was like, I know what that is. I know how you made that.
1525000	1535000	I'm like, damn, it's one level and it's just driving around some ramps just in one level and you're selling it for six dollars on the e-shop.
1535000	1537000	Why didn't I think of that?
1537000	1539000	Yeah, why not?
1539000	1545000	So, but it's fun and they're having a lot of fun with it. And it's all right. I played it a little bit. That's it.
1545000	1551000	That's it. Let's see. My gaming week. So I know. So Act Up and Chad is saying I'm going to stick with Pokemon Go.
1551000	1555000	I have still been playing Pokemon Go just amongst all these other games as well.
1555000	1561000	I would say Wizards Unite is kind of suffering on the back burner right now because there's no I'm only interested in that game when there's an event going on, when there's not an event going on.
1561000	1566000	I don't care about Wizards. So it's on the back burner and I'm playing Pokemon Go.
1566000	1574000	I did a raid for a Regigigas on New Year's Day and it was over 3000 CP because it was weather boosted.
1574000	1581000	So that was exciting. And then I caught a shiny Pikachu with a hat as I was walking around the other day.
1581000	1586000	I actually I did a ton of walking yesterday because, you know, New Year, new me.
1586000	1590000	But I'm trying to close my Apple Watch stuff every day, which means 30 minutes of walking.
1590000	1593000	And I had a big chunk of time yesterday where I didn't really have anything going on.
1593000	1597000	So I'm like, you know what? I've been wanting to do these Ingress missions downtown.
1597000	1600000	So I did 48 missions downtown in Ingress yesterday. That's cool.
1600000	1605000	That's three banners. And I was playing I was using Bluetooth on Pokemon Go the entire time.
1605000	1609000	So amongst those adventures, I finally caught a shiny Pikachu and a hat.
1609000	1614000	So that was like my big prize from there. And I did raids. I was raiding with a friend the other day.
1614000	1618000	And we got Wobuffet with a hat. We got Raticate with a hat, but no shinies.
1618000	1621000	I did hatch the Wurmple though, but no, not shiny, just the Wurmple and a hat.
1621000	1626000	So I had my party hat collection complete. But yeah, I just don't have the shinies yet.
1626000	1630000	So. All right. Other games I've been playing this week.
1630000	1635000	Continue to play Final Fantasy 14. Shane had a wedding in game today. That was fun.
1635000	1640000	Him and his in real life husband did like decided to get married in the game as well.
1640000	1643000	So it was a cute little thing to go to and check out. Yeah, it's cute, right?
1643000	1647000	So I love that that's like a feature in the game. So I took some pictures and yeah, did all that.
1647000	1653000	So it was fun and been playing a little bit of Pokemon Shield because I wanted that Magikarp
1653000	1657000	because they had that event where it was really easy to get a shiny Magikarp.
1657000	1661000	And Shane and I were trying to find raids all night one night, didn't get any.
1661000	1667000	And then the next night he wasn't on and I was just doing random raids and I got one in a random raid.
1667000	1672000	So I was happy. And I also got my Snorlax, the special Gigantamax one that like his belly
1672000	1675000	looks like the entire world or like a snow globe or something.
1675000	1680000	So I'm like, OK, done with those events. So played a little Pokemon Shield and very random.
1680000	1685000	But I was playing Pac-Man Championship Edition two again because I was trying to unlock some more.
1685000	1691000	I think I last week mentioned I bested my score and then I went back to unlock some trophies this week.
1691000	1696000	So just a very random PlayStation thing that I was doing. So, yeah, a little bit of this,
1696000	1700000	a little bit of that in the gaming world. Nothing new as of this week.
1700000	1704000	But I'm sure I'll be catching up on things over the next couple of weeks. So that's for sure.
1704000	1709000	So. All right. Let's get into some gaming news. First, I want to do a few shout outs.
1709000	1713000	A little bit of housekeeping here. Speaking of Pokemon Go, which I mentioned a bit ago,
1713000	1718000	I want to give a shout out to the Pokemon Go podcast because they had me back as a special guest this week.
1718000	1723000	So I was fortunate enough to just be on. I was just on there maybe five weeks ago, six weeks ago,
1723000	1727000	when Pokestop submissions became new. But one of their hosts was out again.
1727000	1734000	So it was Charles McFall, who's a big personality at Dragon Con. So, you know, him and I go way back.
1734000	1739000	So he invited me back and we talked about Pokemon Go for a couple hours to check that out.
1739000	1744000	The most recent episode of the Pokemon Go podcast. If you're into that game, we had a lot of fun on there this week.
1744000	1746000	Do you remember the other announcement I have?
1746000	1752000	Do you remember last summer when I was spending all my time playing that survivor?
1752000	1754000	Survivor LARP, I was calling it.
1754000	1755000	Yes.
1755000	1757000	Yes. And I won the Survivor LARP, right?
1757000	1758000	Right.
1758000	1764000	So I have agreed to do some behind the scenes work with the next season that's coming up.
1764000	1767000	That's going to start, I think, early next month. Don't quote me on that.
1767000	1773000	But it's going to be, you know, kind of a winner going into spring game. It is currently casting.
1773000	1779000	So if you heard me talking about all that and doing like the challenges that are survival style in my house
1779000	1783000	and the people that I had to lie to their faces and screw over, it was a lot of fun.
1783000	1788000	But, you know, it was all a game. And actually I legit met some amazing people through that whole experience.
1788000	1794000	So and like people I am really looking forward to meeting in real life and stuff and just, yeah, some great people.
1794000	1800000	So if you are if that sounds like your thing, I should note that applications are open for that.
1800000	1804000	And that whole community loves to see like new faces and new people get into it.
1804000	1808000	So I figure this is a platform to maybe entice some new people into that.
1808000	1812000	It is a bit of a time commitment. You have to be willing to do video chats with people
1812000	1815000	or you're going to get voted out first because you're not participating.
1815000	1820000	But if, you know, that sounds like up your alley, I would say it's a time commitment similar to like
1820000	1824000	you're going to hardcore raid in an MMO for three weeks, maybe four weeks.
1824000	1827000	You're going to hardcore raid in an MMO for a little bit.
1827000	1832000	So if that sounds like something that's up your alley, check my Twitter feed at Mr Rob Roberts.
1832000	1835000	Or you can find the Facebook group. It's called Power Org.
1835000	1840000	That's O-R-G, Online Reality Games. So Power Org is the Facebook group.
1840000	1845000	And you're going to be looking for Power Season 10. That's the one that's coming up because I won nine.
1845000	1848000	So, yeah, cool. Those are my announcements.
1848000	1849000	Cool.
1849000	1852000	So let's get into some news. Kind of a shorter news week this week.
1852000	1856000	So it may end up being a shorter show, but we've got a few things to talk about.
1856000	1857000	So let's get into it. Loki.
1857000	1863000	So this was an unfortunate turn of events for folks that have WWE 2K20.
1863000	1867000	So apparently playing the game shortly after the new year.
1867000	1871000	Well, I should say attempting to play the game shortly after the new year.
1871000	1876000	Folks found that, well, we can't because it doesn't work.
1876000	1886000	Because apparently there was some issue with some sort of timer in the game that the system date being 2020
1886000	1890000	fucked the game over and you couldn't play it at all. It just was broken.
1891000	1894000	Thankfully, though, they did fix that rather quickly.
1894000	1899000	It was corrected within the day, but still kind of an embarrassing thing,
1899000	1908000	especially considering that WWE 2K20 has been kind of fucking terrible this last few months.
1908000	1912000	It's been out and buggy and glitchy and just all sorts of bad.
1912000	1918000	So it just doesn't really add to the already shit pile that is that game.
1918000	1923000	I've seen some interesting commentary on this because some people on social media are like,
1923000	1927000	LOL, the Y2K bug finally got something and it was this crappy game.
1927000	1929000	And then there's been other people that are like,
1929000	1934000	the reason why Y2K ended up not being a big deal is because everybody did,
1934000	1938000	like it would have been a serious deal, but everybody did a lot of prep and work
1938000	1941000	and made sure that it wasn't going to be a big deal.
1941000	1947000	So it's interesting that this 2K20 bug, I guess, I don't know what else to call it,
1947000	1950000	ended up getting this game. It's just really interesting.
1950000	1956000	But you've got to wonder what other old games may break at a certain point because of the clock.
1956000	1957000	You know what I mean?
1957000	1962000	And I'm talking about this from a retro preservation standpoint.
1962000	1964000	I don't know.
1964000	1965000	Yeah, I don't either.
1965000	1969000	Do you think people will be playing like 100 years from now and will come back and play some of the old games?
1969000	1970000	Oh yeah.
1970000	1971000	Some of the old day games?
1971000	1972000	Yes.
1972000	1973000	You think so?
1973000	1976000	I guess people still read literature and some people will watch the old movies from that day.
1976000	1981000	People still speed run games from these 8-bit and 16-bit systems.
1981000	1982000	True.
1982000	1985000	So I wouldn't see how that would be any different.
1985000	1991000	Azet and Chat says Office Space was the premise of Y2K. It was serious business.
1991000	1997000	Bobby Blackwell says 2038 will be a real bad year for old computer systems.
1997000	2004000	I've heard that before, that it's 2038 and it's something to do with, I don't know if it's like the powers of two or something.
2004000	2007000	Like that's how many bits were going in the year.
2007000	2013000	I don't remember the exact thing, but that's something about that particular year is like when the clock runs out for some old systems.
2013000	2015000	So that's, yeah.
2015000	2021000	And then some folks are talking about some of the really, you know, I don't want to get too much into what's going on in the real world because I think video games escape from that.
2021000	2025000	Obviously a lot of people on social media are like making World War III jokes.
2025000	2027000	I don't think it's particularly funny.
2027000	2029000	I don't want to joke about that.
2029000	2045000	But yeah, let's just hope some of that crazy stuff in the real world really settles down before, you know, so we don't have to talk about that that stuff isn't here for future generations because we, you know, blew it all sky high.
2045000	2048000	So hopefully, hopefully somewhere, somewhere.
2048000	2050000	And not like the song either.
2050000	2052000	Yeah, right. So thank you.
2052000	2058000	Thank you. Bobby Buckle says in Unix, time is represented by a 32 bit integer start.
2058000	2060000	OK, that's what it's like. The number of bits.
2060000	2071000	And it's because the clock. OK, so from January 1st, 1970, the 32 bit integer hits its limit at 2038 because 32 bits would be like 64, something like that, 64 years.
2071000	2073000	And that's that's when it runs out, basically.
2073000	2076000	So, yeah, interesting.
2076000	2078000	We'll see what happens.
2078000	2079000	All right.
2079000	2081000	So we got time. We got 18 years.
2081000	2082000	That's true. We got time.
2082000	2085000	Well, we have time to fix it. Get those old computers off that system.
2085000	2089000	But yeah, as far as like preservation goes, I mean, you can't play games on an old system.
2089000	2091000	The old system no longer works because the sure you can.
2091000	2093000	Because you know what?
2093000	2095000	We run the clock backwards.
2095000	2097000	Turn the clock back.
2097000	2099000	Can spin around the planet backwards.
2099000	2100000	But that's what they were doing, though.
2101000	2106000	The fix the 2K thing is like the temporary workaround was set your clock back.
2106000	2107000	Oh, wow.
2107000	2108000	And it works.
2108000	2110000	You know, it's like you're connected online.
2110000	2117000	I do remember that something about like change your internal clock on your computer to like nineteen hundred and it'll be fine.
2117000	2119000	So weird. Anyway.
2119000	2120000	All right.
2120000	2124000	Metroid Prime 4. Who knows if that's a game we're going to see in 2020?
2124000	2125000	Hopefully.
2125000	2129000	I'm not banking on it, but maybe it could be a holiday game.
2129000	2133000	But there's some rumors going around and it's this lower news week.
2133000	2135000	So I'll give the rumors a little air time.
2135000	2136000	Why not?
2136000	2140000	So Bandai Namco was working on some ideas and that got all scrapped.
2140000	2143000	And this project started again.
2143000	2145000	Retro Studios is taking care of it.
2145000	2157000	But word on the street is that Nintendo is speeding up the development or helping to speed up the development maybe to make this year happen by outsourcing environment work to another developer.
2157000	2163000	And that was discovered by a job posting apparently that was out there for said developer.
2163000	2166000	So interesting.
2166000	2169000	Do you think that this could be detrimental to the game?
2169000	2172000	Because sometimes outsourcing doesn't work out so well.
2172000	2179000	Like the original Final Fantasy 14 clearly had a lot of its environment outsourced.
2179000	2181000	And you literally saw copy paste terrain.
2181000	2183000	It was bad.
2183000	2186000	I think in a way you get what you pay for sort of thing.
2186000	2187000	But it might also be a time.
2187000	2190000	If they have the time to get it right, it might be fine.
2190000	2194000	I think there's also that comment that this is very common in the gaming industry.
2194000	2200000	So even though I'm pointing out a worst case scenario, there's a lot of scenarios you don't even know about that were outsourced with the environment.
2200000	2205000	So do you think Nintendo is trying to push this game for this year?
2205000	2208000	Maybe cutting corners for lack of a better term.
2208000	2209000	I hope not.
2209000	2210000	Where they can.
2210000	2214000	Because at least Nintendo has a certain stamp of quality at least with their games.
2214000	2220000	I would hope that if they are trying to get the game out this year, just put more resources on it.
2220000	2222000	Not necessarily cut corners.
2222000	2224000	I don't know.
2224000	2226000	We'll have to see what the final product is.
2226000	2230000	I also would hope that maybe for the holidays Splatoon 3 is going to be a thing.
2230000	2232000	I could see that coming back.
2232000	2235000	Do you think we're going to get a new Switch this year as well?
2235000	2237000	That Switch Pro that's always rumored?
2237000	2238000	I really don't care.
2238000	2240000	The Switch Lite didn't seem to matter at all.
2240000	2241000	Some people love it.
2242000	2244000	I know, my kids are stupid and they're like, you know.
2244000	2246000	Don't call your kids stupid.
2246000	2256000	Okay, I'm sorry. One of my kids is stupid and they, not stupid, but like my one son, he's stupid in the sense that he gets swept up.
2256000	2257000	Consumerism.
2257000	2259000	He gets swept up in the consumer hype.
2259000	2265000	Like he is just full on, you know, just whatever you tell me to buy, I'm going to buy it.
2265000	2267000	You know, this like type of thing, even though you have no money.
2267000	2270000	It's like, he's like, I need a Switch Lite.
2270000	2273000	I'm like, we have a Switch at home. What do you need a Switch Lite for?
2273000	2280000	Because it's new? I'm like, no. Like you just, you have a Switch.
2280000	2283000	That sounds like a financial responsible child in the making.
2283000	2286000	That's going to be, that kid's going to end up in government.
2286000	2297000	Well, it's just because like, I mean, I could see, I could see where like the advantage of having another Switch would be because they fight over that thing so much.
2297000	2305000	The problem is though, is because my library is, most of it's digital and it's on the one Switch, I ain't buying that shit all over again.
2305000	2312000	You know, like that's, that's going to be the problem right there is like, I can't, I don't want to purchase all of that stuff twice.
2312000	2315000	So that doesn't work for me.
2315000	2323000	All right. I think they might do like a little incremental upgrade, which is interesting because that's kind of what the new Xbox is supposed to be in a way.
2323000	2325000	It's just not really incremental. It's like a big upgrade.
2325000	2326000	Yeah.
2326000	2329000	To the Xbox system, but you know, we'll see.
2329000	2332000	All right. As that says, tell him to get a job.
2332000	2338000	Trying to get him just to pick up his toys and put his socks away and put, put socks on.
2338000	2343000	I'm like, you're sick. You're almost six years old and you don't put your own socks on.
2343000	2346000	I'm like, put your damn socks on.
2346000	2347000	All right.
2347000	2349000	Let's put yourself to bed. You're almost 10.
2349000	2354000	Let's move, let's move on to some more negative commentary, Loki.
2355000	2366000	So apparently the director of Bayonetta is saying that, hey, you know, the switch menu could use some freshening up.
2366000	2376000	Basically saying that there's, they don't like, one of the things that I guess is kind of annoying is that you can't see all of your games unless you go to all games.
2377000	2383000	I mean, which it makes sense. It shows you like the most recently played games that you have on your system, which I'm kind of okay with,
2383000	2392000	but like they feel, you know, Hideki Kayama, he basically wants folders on there.
2392000	2397000	Kind of like how he had with like the 3DS and stuff where you can put some stuff in folders and like sort it that way.
2397000	2401000	I would agree that it would be much better if you could customize this a little more to your own liking.
2401000	2402000	It would be all right.
2402000	2406000	I mean, I still think it's not a huge deal because I would, you know what?
2406000	2409000	This is the one time I'm going to be a little more negative on Nintendo than you.
2409000	2411000	This is new year, new year, new opinions.
2411000	2419000	I kind of agree that the interface on the switch is a little crap and maybe it's because I play more on a TV.
2419000	2424000	And I think the interface that it has lends itself a little better to handheld.
2424000	2428000	Maybe because those icons when you're in handheld may get a little too small.
2428000	2430000	If you try doing too much on that screen, I will.
2430000	2432000	I feel like there's just not enough going.
2432000	2440000	I will contend that I don't think that they should have icons dedicated to disk or cartridge based games
2440000	2443000	because they do have that like on like the PlayStation stuff.
2443000	2450000	They'll have like an icon there for because it's similar to the PlayStation kind of set of how you have, you know, your icons.
2450000	2456000	But that icon changes the first one for whatever disk you have in the system or in this case, a cartridge you have in the system.
2456000	2464000	But with the switch, if I keep switching cartridges, I'm going to have icons for each one of those as it puts a little bit of insulation data in there.
2464000	2467000	And it keeps listing all of that there.
2467000	2472000	It really should just be whatever you played last in there and leave all your digital titles behind it.
2472000	2474000	And that would show a little bit more on the screen.
2474000	2478000	But I mean, it's just it's minimal viable.
2478000	2480000	I mean, really, that's kind of what it is.
2480000	2484000	And to be fair, there's a lot of similarities between the switch and the PlayStation four.
2484000	2487000	So it might be a little unfair that I'm not criticizing the PlayStation four.
2487000	2494000	But I feel like the PlayStation four does a little more would like the crossbar functionality where it's like when you're in a game, you can go up, you can go down.
2494000	2496000	And there's like there's more things to look at in there.
2496000	2499000	And you have the customizability of folders.
2499000	2503000	For example, on my PlayStation four, I have a Jackbox Party Pack folder.
2503000	2506000	And that's where I play. I forgot you do folders.
2506000	2508000	That's where I put all of my Jackbox games are in there.
2508000	2517000	So but even the PlayStation, I really wouldn't mind if they would allow you to maybe like go down into multiple bars or something like I wish you kind of fit a little more.
2517000	2521000	But I guess sometimes the minimalism thing, I guess, is a design choice. I don't know.
2521000	2525000	But even on PlayStation, again, like on Switch, you can see what maybe four games at a time on the main screen.
2525000	2528000	No, it's like it's like it like eight or if you scroll.
2528000	2530000	I mean, like on the screen, on the screen.
2531000	2533000	Well, here, here's a screenshot.
2533000	2540000	So like four. Yeah, you see a few more on on PlayStation.
2540000	2545000	So, well, on PlayStation, yeah, I don't remember what it is, but it is more like seven or eight.
2545000	2547000	Yeah. Yeah. So anyway.
2547000	2549000	So I don't know. I kind of think you might have a point.
2549000	2554000	Like, I think Nintendo should maybe take a look at redoing that UI a little bit or, you know, just enhancing it a little bit.
2554000	2558000	Just a little a few enhancements. I think you go a long way with that thing.
2558000	2562000	Some of this customizability. Yeah. Let us default to all games mode.
2562000	2567000	Let us, you know, have the idea of cartridges on this line. Digitals on this line.
2567000	2572000	I love that. Or smaller game icons. You have it where you can do like the 3DS was where.
2572000	2574000	Yeah, the 3DS was great, honestly.
2574000	2580000	Have large icons and then like I want smaller icons, but I'll have twice as many on there and there'll be two rows or something like that.
2580000	2584000	Tiger Claw and Chat is a new Switch owner and says, on my Switch, I have two games that I bought.
2584000	2587000	One was digitally and the other is a physical copy.
2587000	2591000	Wait until you have like 40 games and 15 of them are, you know, digital or maybe even more.
2591000	2593000	25 of them are digital. Yeah.
2593000	2595000	Then again, that's when that's when the management gets a little crazy.
2595000	2597000	It's fine when you only have so many games.
2597000	2602000	But wait, I mean, because then you go into the all game and you're like, oh, I forgot I had these games.
2602000	2608000	Well, then you get like the Nintendo, the NES channel, then you get the Super NES one channel.
2608000	2611000	We get all that stuff.
2611000	2613000	I like the channels thing.
2613000	2615000	Yeah, exactly. Now, the thing is, like, wait a second.
2616000	2618000	They had a better air face than it was.
2618000	2621000	The problem with the Wii interface is it was fucking clunky.
2621000	2626000	That was it was very clunky and especially the Wii U was really clunky.
2626000	2633000	But like the fact that it had like the forecast channel, it would actually show on the little screen the current temperature in your area and so forth.
2633000	2635000	Like it showed you the little micro data right there.
2635000	2640000	That was very, in a way, almost ahead of its time to like where smartphones kind of ended up.
2640000	2642000	Or even smart TVs now.
2642000	2646000	Like TVs are doing that now where they're showing like here's what the weather is right now.
2646000	2653000	So I kind of I kind of wish Nintendo would take some cues from that Wii design if they could just kind of make that but maybe snappier.
2653000	2654000	I think that might be pretty cool.
2654000	2662000	And you could have folders on the Wii thing, too, because I used to have all my virtual console things were in a folder that you could open it.
2662000	2664000	Or was it the maybe I'm mistaken.
2664000	2665000	Maybe it was a memory card.
2665000	2668000	You'd click the memory card and then that would show you another page of things.
2668000	2670000	So, no, you can do pages.
2671000	2673000	It's been a while. The Wii was out.
2673000	2676000	You can scroll to the right or left or whatever and go pages.
2676000	2678000	And you can do like quite a few.
2678000	2682000	As Joe under Matt in chat says, yeah, it really feels like it's been devolving since the Wii interface.
2682000	2684000	So I think it's just time to revisit some of that stuff.
2684000	2691000	I think the Wii had some good ideas, like the whole sending notes to other people's consoles that it would light up blue.
2691000	2693000	Like, in theory, that was a great idea.
2693000	2695000	It just was horrifically.
2695000	2699000	Because because back then it was like, you know, hey, you can send e-mails to people.
2699000	2702000	Isn't that cool? But remember, it's like smartphones now.
2702000	2704000	Now we have smartphones and we don't need.
2704000	2709000	I know. But remember when it would be like you you walk in your living room one day and you're like, wait, the Wii's glowing blue.
2709000	2715000	What's going on? You go, oh, somebody sent me a message or or oh, it's an ad or whatever it is that's popping up.
2715000	2718000	So I think that would be kind of neat. It's a new channel.
2718000	2722000	Yeah. It's time to go back into everybody votes.
2722000	2725000	What were the other big dumb channels they put out on there for free?
2725000	2729000	There's everybody votes. And then there was there was others.
2729000	2731000	There's a news channel.
2731000	2735000	Do they still have Miis and stuff in the Switch? I can't remember if they have the Miis creation stuff.
2735000	2738000	Yeah, they do, because you create it for your little player icon.
2738000	2739000	Yeah, that's right.
2739000	2743000	Or you choose one of the stock pictures.
2743000	2747000	Let's see. Fifth Dream Today says, I miss lights on Nintendo handhelds.
2747000	2751000	Act F says, I like the Switch's UI simplicity, but it could use some reworking and reorganizing.
2751000	2753000	So there you go. All right.
2753000	2760000	Well, moving on, let's talk a little more about Nintendo and apparently on some comments from global president Shuntaro Furukawa,
2760000	2764000	who says cloud gaming might not be a thing as soon.
2764000	2768000	But I mean, is this any shock to hear that Nintendo might be behind the curve a little bit on this stuff?
2768000	2776000	I don't know. You be the judge, because Reggie Fils-May, even before when he was involved with Nintendo and he was the North American president,
2776000	2780000	he said cloud gaming could be a thing that it dominates later on.
2780000	2784000	But apparently Shuntaro Furukawa sees differently.
2784000	2793000	He did an interview with the Japanese publication Nikkei and said it's possible that cloud gaming could capture the public's interest in 10 years from now.
2793000	2797000	However, at this point in time, I do not think the dedicated hardware will go away.
2797000	2800000	It's a long way off before we'll really know the outcome.
2800000	2806000	With that said, it would be pointless to solely focus on methods of play that can only be had on dedicated hardware.
2806000	2811000	Once your audience starts saying they can play on other consoles or smartphones instead, you're finished.
2811000	2815000	But, you know, that doesn't mean they're shutting out other concepts completely.
2815000	2820000	Something I do not want the public to misunderstand is that we are not turning our backs on new technologies.
2820000	2822000	We are constantly researching and developing.
2822000	2829000	Our hardware development teams evaluate all kinds of new technologies available thus far and consult with our software developers.
2829000	2833000	If they determine the technology can be used with the game, then they will utilize it.
2833000	2836000	We will not be changing this fundamental approach moving forward.
2836000	2842000	As for AR, augmented reality, it is definitely one of the many aspects we are interested in.
2842000	2846000	We are currently researching what interesting ways we can utilize it.
2846000	2857000	Not terribly surprising that Nintendo has a particular interest in AR when you consider how hard Niantic's gone on that with Pokemon Go, which of course is a Nintendo property.
2857000	2865000	I would be interested to see what Nintendo does with AR because they've kind of dabbled before with even like way back to the DS.
2865000	2872000	No, not the DS. It was the 3DS. They dabbled with it with the 3DS.
2872000	2878000	Yeah, I remember that. Like the little AR Rangers and the cards that you had and you could take the camera with a picture of yourself.
2878000	2879000	Yeah, I remember that.
2879000	2886000	So they've dabbled with it. I mean, they're kind of always ahead of the curve, but at the same time it's almost too early to do what they want to do.
2886000	2891000	And they're just kind of like, well, we can't go back to that. So we're just going to forget about it.
2891000	2895000	And then later on they'll attempt something that's also kind of too ahead of its time.
2895000	2901000	And ironically, I don't know about you, but I don't necessarily disagree with what he's saying about cloud gaming.
2901000	2907000	Because what he's saying is what kind of a lot of us are saying about Stadia right now is that it's too early for something like this.
2907000	2913000	And, you know, he might not be talking about bandwidth caps and some things we're talking about, but he's kind of reading the tea leaves the same way a lot of us are.
2913000	2921000	And kind of he's also referring to some of the stuff that they've had for cloud gaming on their console already with, you know, the Assassin's Creed Odyssey.
2921000	2928000	And was it Resident Evil, one of those games that they had on there as well, that was kind of a cloud based game.
2928000	2935000	And one of those, the sales on the Switch haven't been as great as they'd hoped, although it's really a third party game.
2935000	2941000	That's a very good point about those kind of cloud carts, which do we have any of them here? Weren't they only in Japan?
2941000	2942000	They're only in Japan.
2943000	2946000	So, and then again, we talk about infrastructure, perhaps it's a little better over there.
2946000	2949000	Maybe Google Stadia stands to do very well in Japan.
2949000	2954000	By the way, if you are a Stadia person, don't forget there's new games in the store now for pro people.
2954000	2959000	Because you can grab Rise of the Tomb Raider is one and the other one, Thumper is the other.
2959000	2965000	Which I'm curious, I got to play that on Stadia because I'm, I mean, putting out a music based game.
2965000	2970000	I will say, even though Thumper might be a cheaper title in some regards, I think it's still a good game.
2970000	2976000	And I think it's pretty gutsy to put out a music based game on your cloud gaming.
2976000	2977000	Well, hopefully it works well.
2977000	2979000	That's what I'm curious about.
2979000	2982000	So, so I'll be curious to see what goes on with that.
2982000	2986000	But back to Nintendo.
2986000	2987000	Yeah, I don't know.
2987000	2991000	Like, I think that it makes sense.
2991000	2995000	You know, we always rag on them for like kind of being behind the curve when it comes to network stuff.
2995000	3000000	So like, I could see them not wanting to jump into, you know, streaming.
3000000	3003000	Though, to be honest, so they could do that.
3003000	3008000	Well, they kind of already do that with the Nintendo games that they have on there.
3008000	3011000	Although I'm not really sure if that's streaming or if you're just downloading everything.
3011000	3013000	I mean, how would you know?
3013000	3015000	Because it's such a small file size.
3015000	3023000	But like, they could stream, easily stream like a whole NES game to your console.
3023000	3028000	I mean, hell, they were doing that with the Game Boy Advance and linking that with the GameCube and stuff.
3028000	3032000	You could stream the whole thing to a Game Boy Advance and store it in memory.
3032000	3039000	So I think there's some serious missed opportunities with the amount of library that they have with all the NES games.
3039000	3042000	Especially like what was on the Wii and stuff.
3042000	3044000	Like, all those games you could buy.
3044000	3050000	Like, nowadays, just put that full library out there and just put rotating discounts on different things.
3050000	3052000	And like, you just sell so much.
3052000	3059000	Because people right now, especially like me, have a tendency to like, hoard games.
3059000	3061000	It's like, oh, that's a great deal.
3061000	3063000	I'm gonna pick that up and then you just never play it.
3063000	3065000	And it just sits in your backlog.
3065000	3068000	But it's cool because you have all these games and you're like, oh yeah, I'll go back to that someday.
3068000	3071000	But I think they could make some serious money doing that.
3071000	3072000	Even like with third parties.
3072000	3076000	I understand a lot of these companies are putting out these collections and stuff with their older games.
3076000	3078000	Because that's kind of how they're getting around this.
3078000	3086000	But I really think Nintendo should kind of regroup and say, hey, you know, let's do what we did before.
3086000	3088000	Because I think that would be a really good thing.
3088000	3089000	Because I don't know.
3089000	3097000	Have with this new version of the emulators that they have where it supports two player multiplayer.
3097000	3102000	Have you played with anybody multiplayer in any of these NES or Super NES games?
3102000	3103000	Nope.
3103000	3107000	So I think that's a feature that everyone's like, oh yeah, I'm looking for that.
3108000	3111000	To be fair, it was something we were begging for with the Wii.
3111000	3117000	But I think it's also one of those things where the games, I feel like there's still stuff missing that I would want to play.
3117000	3118000	But I don't know.
3118000	3119000	Yeah, I just...
3119000	3121000	Maybe we're just past that point. I don't know.
3121000	3123000	I just think it's a real missed opportunity.
3123000	3126000	Especially with those mini consoles, man.
3126000	3131000	If you had a storefront built into those where you can keep downloading more titles and keep adding to it.
3131000	3135000	I'm telling you, they would have had some serious money on their hands.
3135000	3140000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I still remember how everyone bitched about virtual console because you had to buy each game individually.
3140000	3142000	Why don't they just make it a subscription service instead?
3142000	3144000	I think overall I do like the subscription.
3144000	3148000	But then we saw what the subscription service was and how few games there were.
3148000	3149000	And it's like, okay, I'll take the old one.
3149000	3157000	It feels like, you know, it's not quite as robust as the former service with all the games that were available there.
3157000	3159000	But I guess they have to test them all.
3159000	3160000	There should be a happy medium.
3160000	3166000	There should be a happy medium. I think the problem we had with the virtual consoles, I felt that they were charging too much for those games.
3166000	3168000	And I get it, like some of those games.
3168000	3175000	Like $8 a game for a Super Nintendo title. No matter what it was.
3175000	3178000	Maybe you can get away with charging that for Zelda and Mario and the must haves.
3178000	3184000	But charging $8 for a third party title that wasn't a big deal.
3184000	3190000	Nowadays you have stuff on the Switch like indie games and stuff that are $9.99 that are a nice full fledged game or whatever.
3190000	3196000	Or like say I'm paying $20 for a really solid indie, like, Untitled Goose game.
3196000	3198000	You know, a really solid game.
3198000	3201000	I just feel that it's not the same value.
3201000	3204000	I get it that Nintendo games are pretty good and stuff.
3204000	3207000	But at the same time those games are really old.
3207000	3210000	And it should mark them down a bit.
3211000	3213000	But you can still sell a ton of it.
3213000	3215000	And you're still making pure profit on that stuff.
3215000	3221000	Because honestly it's the same ROM files that have existed for decades now.
3221000	3224000	And that you're just running through some emulator software that you created.
3224000	3227000	Yes, I understand that there's development time for those emulators.
3227000	3234000	But let's be honest, I'm sure a lot of that stuff is probably also borrowed from other emulators that are out there already.
3235000	3241000	So, I mean, I can't imagine that the development time in there wouldn't be immediately recouped by the sales of these games.
3241000	3247000	I think it's probably already paid for itself dozens of times over already.
3247000	3250000	Let me go back to the cloud gaming thing for one other thing I wanted to bring up.
3250000	3255000	And that was that Nintendo tends to be very dominant in the handheld space.
3255000	3258000	You know, maybe not necessarily compared to smartphones.
3258000	3262000	But when it comes to dedicated gaming devices, they have outlived the N-Gage.
3262000	3264000	If you want to... I mean, that was kind of...
3264000	3267000	Okay, but certainly Sony's foray into that is what I'm really getting at.
3267000	3270000	With the PSP and the Vita, Nintendo's kind of outlived that.
3270000	3275000	Could it be that even if Nintendo were to miss the boat on cloud gaming right away,
3275000	3277000	they would still have the lockdown on handheld gaming?
3277000	3281000	Because the reality is, as much as we talk about 5G and all this stuff,
3281000	3286000	the portability will not be there before the living room, right?
3286000	3290000	Cloud in your living room is going to happen before cloud on portability.
3290000	3294000	And so, maybe it makes sense that Nintendo holds out a little longer
3294000	3297000	because the handheld thing is so important to them.
3297000	3300000	And you got to wonder if every system they do from now on
3300000	3302000	is just going to be some version of the Switch.
3302000	3305000	I kind of feel like that's where Nintendo's at now.
3305000	3309000	Like, every Nintendo device from now on is going to be some sort of TV here,
3309000	3311000	pick it up on the go there, is my thought.
3311000	3315000	I think we're done with one or the other dedicated Nintendo device
3315000	3317000	because Nintendo still wants to run with the handheld stuff.
3317000	3320000	I think they'll go wherever the industry goes, honestly.
3320000	3323000	If they can get away with doing small devices that are powerful,
3323000	3328000	which I could see them doing because hardware's just getting better
3328000	3330000	and eventually it'll shrink down in size.
3330000	3336000	And it just eventually gets small enough to where you can put it in a handheld form factor.
3336000	3338000	But it depends on where they want to go.
3338000	3343000	And it seems like this is where they want to go is the smaller portable devices
3343000	3344000	because that's what's popular now.
3344000	3348000	But if something else becomes more popular like AR or something like that,
3348000	3351000	I mean, that's still going to be probably portable, but we'll see.
3351000	3356000	I'm sure they'll adapt with whatever the industry's trending towards.
3356000	3359000	I just want to point out an observation here before we go to our next story,
3359000	3363000	and that is that you guys know that Mr. Smoosh is usually very loud during the show
3363000	3366000	and he's screaming and all this stuff, and he was doing that a little bit ago.
3366000	3370000	He has parked himself on top of Jamie's chair.
3370000	3373000	So the recliner that Jamie usually sits on,
3373000	3378000	he climbed to the top, he's parked up there, and he's staring at the – we have a studio light.
3378000	3380000	It's like one of those lights that's on an umbrella type of thing.
3380000	3383000	And he's just staring at it and just very peaceful.
3383000	3384000	That's where he's sitting.
3384000	3387000	And he's – notice how he has shut the hell up tonight.
3387000	3393000	It kind of makes you wonder if is that all he just wants every night is just to be up on top of Jamie's chair?
3393000	3397000	I'm going to tell her next time she's here.
3397000	3399000	Ping him up and let him get on the back of the chair, see if he'll shut up,
3399000	3401000	but it probably would rock too much.
3401000	3404000	When Jamie's in it, she's going to lean forward and take a sip of water or something.
3404000	3405000	It's going to rocket too much for her.
3405000	3407000	I don't know. It's just funny.
3407000	3410000	He knows she's gone. He misses her.
3410000	3413000	Possibly. I don't know.
3413000	3418000	Jamie was actually here in the studio last night for unrelated to OLR reasons,
3418000	3421000	and so Smoosh did get to see her.
3421000	3422000	It was actually funny.
3422000	3427000	So yesterday – going off topic for a bit, but our news is light this week so we can do that.
3428000	3433000	Yesterday was Alan and I's 10-year anniversary of dating, right?
3433000	3436000	So even though our wedding anniversary is in a couple weeks,
3436000	3439000	which is why we have no show, by the way, on January 19th,
3439000	3441000	literally nobody's here on January 19th.
3441000	3442000	Yeah, I'll be.
3442000	3444000	He just told me today, I won't be here January 19th.
3444000	3446000	I'm like, neither will anyone else.
3446000	3449000	So Dark Soccer has got a thing with the sisters in San Francisco.
3449000	3452000	Alan and I are going for our wedding anniversary to see –
3452000	3454000	We're going to the broccoli farm.
3454000	3455000	You guys are going to the broccoli farm?
3455000	3456000	Yeah, we're going to the broccoli farm again.
3456000	3457000	I thought – that's what I asked.
3457000	3458000	I saw you guys going to the broccoli farm again.
3458000	3459000	Yeah.
3459000	3460000	Oh, that's good.
3460000	3461000	Well, that'll be fun.
3461000	3465000	Which, if you're new to OLR, the broccoli farm is what Loki told the kids.
3465000	3468000	It was this great meme for a while on the show.
3468000	3471000	He told the kids they were going to the broccoli farm.
3471000	3474000	It was really Disneyland, so they went down to LA.
3474000	3476000	And they figured it out before you got there, right?
3476000	3480000	No, they did not figure it out, which they should have
3480000	3484000	because they were literally signs that said Disneyland and stuff like that.
3484000	3489000	But we finally told them after a while where we were going.
3489000	3491000	But they kind of thought they were going somewhere else.
3491000	3493000	I think they thought Legoland or something like that.
3493000	3494000	No.
3494000	3495000	Okay.
3495000	3496000	No, I was like, no.
3496000	3498000	Or Universal Studios.
3498000	3499000	So anyway, the point of my story.
3499000	3501000	So we all have different things going on in the 19th.
3501000	3502000	It's just a busy weekend.
3502000	3505000	I think that's also Martin Luther King Jr. Day, if I remember right.
3505000	3506000	Is that coming Monday?
3506000	3507000	Yes.
3507000	3510000	So I think it's just, you know, with the longer weekend,
3510000	3512000	it's going to be a little crazy for a lot of people.
3512000	3513000	So we won't be here.
3513000	3514000	We won't be here that night.
3514000	3515000	We won't.
3515000	3516000	But that is our anniversary.
3516000	3518000	So yesterday was our dating anniversary.
3518000	3519000	So we went out.
3519000	3521000	We decided to go to Benihana last night.
3521000	3522000	Oh, awesome.
3522000	3524000	Because, you know, there's only one thing I love more than Alan,
3524000	3526000	and that's that fried rice.
3526000	3527000	Yep.
3527000	3528000	Extra butter.
3528000	3530000	You got to give it the extra garlic butter.
3530000	3533000	The other folks at our table were like, can you do extra butter?
3533000	3535000	And he was like, are you guys okay with that?
3535000	3536000	You guys were like, hell yeah, we are.
3536000	3538000	Yeah.
3538000	3539000	So, yeah.
3539000	3540000	So we did that.
3540000	3542000	And but the reason why I bring that up.
3542000	3544000	This comes back to Mr. Smoosh seeing Jamie.
3544000	3548000	Apparently Jamie was in the neighborhood yesterday and she dropped by because she wanted to drop
3548000	3549000	some stuff out by the house.
3549000	3550000	And she texted me.
3550000	3551000	She's like, hey, are you at home?
3551000	3554000	I was in the neighborhood and I'm looking at Smoosh through the window.
3554000	3556000	And he can see me.
3556000	3559000	And I was like, no, hon, we went out for our.
3559000	3561000	But she came by later after we were home from dinner.
3561000	3563000	She has another friend that lives in the neighborhood.
3563000	3564000	So she was here seeing that person.
3564000	3567000	So it's not like she made a trip out here for nothing.
3567000	3569000	But yes, so she got to see Mr. Smoosh yesterday.
3569000	3572000	So I don't think Mr. Smoosh misses her too much.
3572000	3573000	So anyway.
3573000	3575000	All right.
3575000	3577000	Pixel pockets is happy anniversary to you, too.
3577000	3578000	Thank you.
3578000	3583000	I think our real celebration is going to be the cruise that we're going on in March, because
3583000	3585000	remember, we're going on that Star Trek cruise.
3585000	3586000	Oh, yeah.
3586000	3587000	Crap.
3587000	3589000	I have to figure out what we're doing with the show because I'm going to be gone for
3589000	3590000	two weeks.
3590000	3594000	So to be determined, I don't know what's happening with our yet.
3594000	3597000	We haven't figured that out.
3597000	3601000	I think we'll probably record in advance the first week and then just not have a show the
3601000	3602000	second week.
3602000	3604000	I think it's the only way we can really get around that.
3604000	3606000	So very excited about that.
3606000	3607000	All right.
3607000	3608000	Anyway, back into some more news.
3608000	3613000	Speaking of obsessive fan creations, Loki, you have something for us, right?
3613000	3614000	Yes.
3614000	3620000	So there was a fan made Mother Four game that they had started working on.
3620000	3622000	I guess it stopped.
3622000	3626000	They started it, I guess, winter of 2014.
3626000	3630000	It was going to be like an if not an official, but like a fan mother for.
3630000	3633000	But then, of course, you know, with the whole season, this is type things.
3633000	3638000	It stopped being a fan mother for game in twenty seventeen.
3638000	3643000	And they finally announced their new title for the game called Oddity.
3643000	3645000	And definitely look, we've got some video.
3645000	3646000	Yes.
3646000	3648000	And it definitely has.
3648000	3651000	It looks a lot like mother and it looks awesome.
3652000	3657000	The earthbound inspiration is very clear, but it's different.
3657000	3659000	And especially just that that art style with the.
3659000	3660000	I love it.
3660000	3663000	I think I don't like I'm not a huge fan of like Earthbound.
3663000	3667000	I could be honest, I've never played any Earthbound games.
3667000	3668000	You really should.
3668000	3670000	But it looks absolutely awesome.
3670000	3674000	Like I really would be looking forward to checking this game out.
3674000	3679000	But so, yeah, it's spun off into its own thing, which I am all for.
3679000	3680000	You know, yeah.
3680000	3684000	And it kind of looks like they've added more like cut scenes in that style.
3684000	3688000	But, you know, Nintendo has really been kind of sleeping on this franchise for whatever reason.
3688000	3691000	I guess maybe it just didn't sell their expectations or whatever.
3691000	3699000	So I love that somebody else is coming in and making a game, but it's going to be different enough where now this game could be sold on Steam.
3699000	3701000	It can be sold on the e-shop.
3701000	3703000	Nintendo e-shop maybe if Nintendo will take it.
3703000	3704000	I don't know.
3704000	3705000	I think they would.
3705000	3707000	That little police thing was part of the trailer, by the way.
3707000	3709000	That's not something weird.
3709000	3713000	I think that might be a tongue-in-cheek joke about Nintendo shutting them down.
3713000	3714000	I'm not sure.
3714000	3718000	But, yeah, the way they're like walking around the world and stuff, it looks like a frickin' motherfucker.
3718000	3719000	It really does.
3719000	3720000	It does.
3720000	3722000	Yeah, so I think it looks really awesome.
3722000	3725000	So, of course, it's still being developed.
3725000	3731000	They haven't released a, well, in the trailer they actually say it'll be done when it's done.
3731000	3732000	When it's ready.
3732000	3734000	Which is completely fair.
3734000	3735000	Completely fair.
3735000	3736000	Maybe.
3736000	3737000	Maybe we'll see it this year.
3737000	3738000	Maybe next year.
3738000	3742000	But, I mean, definitely a game that's on my radar now and looks pretty awesome.
3742000	3744000	So, pretty cool.
3744000	3753000	And, honestly, like I think, like I know it's fun to make a fan game, you know, sequel to like a Nintendo franchise or anybody's franchise like that.
3753000	3761000	But, like, sometimes maybe just a spiritual successor or something like that that's not, you know, called Earthbound or something like that.
3761000	3763000	Or you're not called Mario or whatever.
3764000	3765000	Might be good enough.
3765000	3769000	Bobby Blackwolf points out, to be fair, Undertale was an Earthbound fan game too.
3769000	3770000	Look where that ended up.
3770000	3771000	True.
3771000	3773000	That's pretty amazing.
3773000	3776000	That game ended up being very different from Earthbound though.
3776000	3779000	Like, I wouldn't play a game like that and think, oh, this is very Earthbound inspired.
3779000	3786000	Maybe a little bit I might go, oh, I see Earthbound and I see, you know, other classic 80s, you know, RPGs in here.
3786000	3792000	But with that one, the oddity, I'm like, oh, that's very clearly Earthbound inspired but different enough to not be a ripoff.
3793000	3804000	Yeah. But, you know, maybe if something like that does really well, you know, like Undertale well, maybe that'll give Nintendo the kick in the pants.
3804000	3809000	Like, hey, maybe you should, maybe you should listen to all the people screaming at you for Mother 3.
3809000	3814000	I love the idea of oddity coming out on the Nintendo eShop. Why the fuck not? It's different enough, right?
3814000	3821000	Don't we have games that look like, I'm trying to think of games that look like something else on the Nintendo eShop now.
3821000	3826000	Like those retro games that kind of look like old, like Zelda, Zelda, right?
3826000	3829000	Don't we have like old retro games that look like Zelda like on the eShop?
3829000	3833000	I'm pretty sure there's something. There's a lot of like, there's a lot of shovelware on eShop.
3833000	3837000	Bobby Blackwell says Binding of Isaac looks like old Zelda. Thank you. I knew there was like something.
3837000	3839000	Yeah. So, you know, but there's more than just that too.
3839000	3842000	So, yeah, there's lots of games that are inspired by other things.
3842000	3845000	And I mean, that's kind of a trend nowadays is a lot of these retro inspired games.
3845000	3850000	But as long as the Giana Sisters reboot was on Wii U, great one.
3850000	3857000	Because that was, for those that know their gaming history, Giana Sisters and it was on the Commodore 64 was too much like Mario and got sued.
3857000	3863000	And it was a really, and if you go look at old footage of Giana Sisters, you kind of go, oh yeah, it does, it does look a lot like Mario.
3863000	3870000	So, I mean, yeah, I'm all for them releasing that. At least this way they won't get cease and desist.
3870000	3876000	All right. Well, moving on to talk about The Witcher. So, this show is doing very well. Have you watched The Witcher show yet?
3876000	3877000	Have not.
3877000	3885000	I watched the first 15 minutes before I got a text message that said, hey, come play Final Fantasy 14, we need somebody to do a dungeon.
3885000	3888000	And so I ended up turning it off. I didn't get very far, but I need to sit down and watch it again.
3888000	3894000	But yeah, apparently a lot of people are getting into the Netflix series, even though the critics tore it apart.
3894000	3898000	Apparently it's doing very well with ratings because Netflix never really talks about ratings,
3898000	3901000	but they did talk about like their most streamed shows of the year.
3901000	3906000	And like The Witcher was, now they factored in projected data.
3906000	3912000	So, like it wasn't like in a month The Witcher topped Stranger or topped everything else besides like Stranger Things.
3912000	3916000	But The Witcher is like one of the top streamed things on Netflix. So, it's doing very well.
3916000	3919000	And because of that, we're seeing this very interesting effect.
3919000	3922000	I don't think we usually see when video game properties become movies, right?
3922000	3925000	It's because usually the game is really popular.
3925000	3935000	Now we're seeing people that are, you know, tossing their coin to Witcher 3 on the Steam library, O'Valley of Plenty Games.
3935000	3940000	O'Valley of Plenty Games. So, apparently that's what's happening on Steam right now,
3940000	3945000	is that The Witcher 3 is more popular than it's ever been, ever, even since the original release.
3945000	3951000	This has revealed that the studio community lead actually mentioned this on Twitter.
3951000	3955000	The PC version of The Witcher 3 broke its record for the most number of concurrent players.
3955000	3959000	94,000 people playing on December 29th.
3959000	3964000	The game was 8th in Steam's top 10 games by player count.
3964000	3970000	So, it's like all these people are seeing the show and now they want to go check out the game as a result of the show.
3970000	3974000	Even though the show is based on the books, but the games are also based on the books.
3974000	3976000	So, there's some crossover there.
3976000	3981000	Like, you know, the bard that is a meme right now was in the games.
3981000	3984000	Maybe it might make the games easier to understand.
3984000	3990000	Like, I could tell you if there was maybe a Kingdom Hearts TV show that I could understand the story of Kingdom Hearts.
3990000	3992000	I might be more inclined to play Kingdom Hearts.
3992000	3995000	Even though I should.
3995000	3998000	Well, what should really excite you, in my opinion.
3998000	4003000	You know, even though some critics toured The Witcher apart, and I hear other people that are like,
4003000	4011000	I think it's great. I have co-workers that are like, yeah, it's filling a void that Games of Thrones left.
4011000	4016000	And I feel like that's part of the reason why the show is doing so popular because there's no Game of Thrones anymore.
4016000	4020000	And even though HBO is supposedly working on other stuff, there's like nothing to fill that void.
4020000	4023000	And I think The Witcher is filling that for a lot of people.
4023000	4029000	Even if some people don't think it's, you know, the critics don't clearly think it's as good, but it doesn't matter what they think.
4029000	4032000	If the fans are there to support it, you know, they're going to.
4032000	4040000	In a way that critics don't always praise every superhero movie that comes out, but audiences typically do.
4040000	4042000	Depends, of course, what movie we're talking about here.
4042000	4046000	But in Marvel's case, you know, Marvel always does very well at the box office.
4046000	4048000	Well, I've got good news for Bobby Blackwell.
4048000	4049000	Okay.
4049000	4055000	Is that, you know, if you are a fan of TV shows and then going and playing the games based on those TV shows as well,
4055000	4061000	you'll be happy to know that Ni No Kuni, the movie, comes out on January 16th on Netflix.
4061000	4063000	Very good. Very good, yes.
4063000	4065000	And that's a demo you can pass.
4065000	4072000	And Dragon Quest has something coming too, like a movie or something that's coming to Netflix.
4072000	4077000	But what should be very exciting, and this is the point I was trying to make a minute ago, with The Witcher.
4077000	4082000	So the studio that did The Witcher also did The Expanse, which has done very well.
4082000	4087000	And they had announced, and we talked about this on the show, but at the time we were kind of like,
4087000	4091000	Oh, this Witcher show's probably not going to be a big deal. Oops.
4091000	4093000	I remember seeing that.
4093000	4095000	But, well, I think at the time we kind of lost over.
4095000	4101000	But the other project they're working on, folks, is the adaptation of Final Fantasy XIV.
4101000	4103000	Now, we don't know if that's for Netflix.
4103000	4104000	I don't know how that's going to work.
4104000	4107000	I'm fucking jazzed about it. Are you kidding?
4107000	4111000	Now that I've, you know, even with what little bit I've seen of The Witcher and how well it's been received
4111000	4116000	and knowing that The Expanse is pretty well received too, I am psyched that they're doing Final Fantasy XIV.
4116000	4122000	And I don't know what part, I don't know if they're going to do a story that is separate from what's happening in the games,
4122000	4123000	because I could definitely see that.
4123000	4130000	And for those that are about to talk about Dad of Light on Netflix, that is a completely different thing
4130000	4132000	where Final Fantasy XIV was a plot device.
4132000	4134000	That is not, like, we're talking about something set in that world.
4134000	4138000	So I don't know if this is going to be a separate thing that's going on concurrently with the game,
4138000	4140000	or if it's going to try to cover the story of the games.
4140000	4143000	I don't know, but it could be very, very interesting.
4143000	4145000	So, yeah.
4145000	4150000	Bobby Blackwell says, The Witcher, Expanse crossover confirmed.
4150000	4153000	Witcher in space, Geralt in space.
4153000	4158000	Toss a coin to your Witcher, oh asteroid of plenty.
4158000	4163000	Wasn't, I do believe, and I want to say, like, I saw something about Cyberpunk.
4163000	4166000	I believe that there is some Witcher Cyberpunk crossover stuff that happened.
4166000	4167000	Really?
4167000	4171000	Like, I want to say, like, they had, like, a character from The Witcher in Cyberpunk or something like that.
4171000	4175000	The female characters, I don't remember, I remember seeing our work.
4175000	4178000	I don't know if it's, like, it's probably, it's obviously not the same character,
4178000	4184000	because completely different timelines and universes, but, I don't know, maybe.
4184000	4188000	All right, a few more news stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week,
4188000	4191000	and then we're going to go right from there into our listener roundtable,
4191000	4193000	and also tackle some of the emails we've got this week.
4193000	4197000	So, yeah, it's, we only have half the size show roll we usually do,
4197000	4200000	just because of the holiday week still being here.
4200000	4202000	But, for now, we have a couple more stories. Loki?
4202000	4206000	So, Game Pass, of course, getting lots of new games all the time,
4206000	4213000	and one of my favorite games, Grand Theft Auto V, is now part of that wonderful package.
4213000	4220000	So, it's, I believe, I'm not sure if it's playable on console, if you have,
4220000	4225000	I don't believe they have the PC version playable as part of Game Pass,
4225000	4228000	but I know it is on the console version, so,
4228000	4231000	worth checking out if you haven't checked it out yet, because,
4231000	4234000	why wouldn't you have checked it out yet? It's Grand Theft Auto V, it's awesome.
4237000	4238000	I'm looking right at you.
4238000	4241000	Well, it's now on Game Pass, so it's going to be very hard to ignore it,
4241000	4244000	but do you think they're putting it out just so they can make money on the online component?
4244000	4245000	Oh, God, yes.
4245000	4246000	Yeah, I'm sure that's what it is.
4246000	4249000	Of course, yeah, the price of the game has been, like, really low for a long time.
4249000	4252000	Bobby does want to remind us it's console only.
4252000	4254000	That's what I said, it's console only.
4254000	4256000	Yeah, so not the PC version, at least not yet.
4257000	4261000	Yeah, I don't think that they're doing the PC part of that, but it's been so cheap.
4261000	4264000	I mean, honestly, if you're going to get it on PC, you could.
4264000	4267000	PC version's good because of all the mods you can do to it,
4267000	4271000	but yeah, I mean, console version's pretty awesome.
4271000	4273000	It's worth checking out, Grand Theft Auto Online.
4273000	4280000	I found it to be a little heavy-handed with the monetization, but it was all right.
4281000	4282000	All right.
4282000	4285000	Well, moving on to some more news this week,
4285000	4291000	and this is sad news, but Sid Mead has passed away this week at the age of 86.
4291000	4294000	What did Sid Mead have to do with video games?
4294000	4295000	Not a lot directly.
4295000	4298000	There were some games, he was kind of like the Cyber Race games,
4298000	4300000	but not a lot of games you've probably heard of,
4300000	4307000	but when it came to movies, he was somebody that worked on movies like Blade Runner and Tron.
4307000	4309000	He was a concept artist.
4309000	4312000	So, like, the world of Tron and what that looked like,
4312000	4314000	a lot of that was from the mind of Sid Mead.
4314000	4317000	And so, if you look at Blade Runner was another big one.
4317000	4320000	He also did When Star Trek came to the movies, did that, Alien.
4320000	4324000	So, like, a lot of these movies that really shaped sci-fi,
4324000	4327000	a lot of that was Sid Mead's vision.
4327000	4331000	And that did come into play with video games later on
4331000	4334000	because, seriously, take a look at his concept art
4334000	4338000	and put it side by side with what a game like Mass Effect looks like,
4338000	4341000	and you're going to see the similarities there.
4341000	4345000	So, even if Sid Mead maybe didn't have a huge impact on video games directly,
4345000	4349000	he still had a huge impact on video games conceptually and artistically.
4349000	4352000	So, we take a moment to recognize his contributions
4352000	4357000	and, unfortunately, talk about that he has passed away this week at the age of 86.
4357000	4359000	But that's a pretty good age.
4359000	4362000	So, rest in peace.
4362000	4366000	Anyhow, let's move on.
4366000	4370000	Some folks in chat, Questbuster says Sid Mead designed the aliens in Wing Commander 5.
4370000	4374000	He also consulted on the Blade Runner point-and-click game from Westwood Studios.
4374000	4377000	He had some games of his own, but those didn't do too well.
4377000	4380000	Loved his imagination.
4380000	4384000	He did have some gaming contributions, but I think his movie contributions
4384000	4388000	and then how that influenced what happens with games was probably a lot bigger.
4388000	4391000	So, probably what a lot more people are going to know him for.
4391000	4394000	All right. Well, let's talk about some classic games.
4394000	4397000	We're going to take a trip down memory lane and jump into the gaming vault
4397000	4399000	and find a classic game of the week.
4399000	4402000	Usually Dark Sakura would step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,
4402000	4405000	hey, you guys should be checking this game out this week,
4405000	4408000	but I'm going to fill in this week just because I didn't have a lot of notice,
4408000	4410000	so I just was like, I didn't have time to interview anybody.
4410000	4412000	So, I was like, all right, I'll jump in and pick a game.
4412000	4414000	And it's kind of hard to find a game.
4414000	4416000	We've been doing this segment a long time.
4416000	4417000	This is episode 805.
4417000	4419000	We've been doing this segment since episode 250.
4419000	4423000	That's nearly 600 classic games.
4423000	4426000	I think we've only accidentally repeated like two or three times,
4426000	4428000	and they were accidents all those times.
4428000	4431000	So, or maybe like a soundtrack for you.
4431000	4432000	But, you know, you guys know what I mean.
4432000	4436000	We've done very, but somehow we did not do this game.
4436000	4439000	So, this is a game that I'm going to pick for this week,
4439000	4444000	and the game I'm going to talk about is Crystal Castles.
4444000	4446000	Not to be confused with the band.
4446000	4451000	I'm pretty sure the band got their name from this video game,
4451000	4453000	but I want to talk about the video game because,
4453000	4457000	and the reason why I picked this is that this is one of the first video games
4457000	4461000	I actually have a memory of playing this game.
4461000	4463000	I remember playing this at Chuck E. Cheese Pizza
4463000	4467000	when I had to step on a box to be able to reach.
4467000	4469000	Do you remember that as a kid?
4469000	4473000	You had to step on the booster box so you could actually reach the controller,
4473000	4474000	which was a spinny ball.
4474000	4478000	You used a track ball to be able to control this game,
4478000	4482000	which was not really something that was heard of for a lot of games back in the day.
4482000	4484000	I mean, there were others like Missile Commander and stuff,
4484000	4486000	but Crystal Castles is definitely one of my favorites.
4486000	4490000	So Crystal Castles was released in the arcades by Atari in 1983.
4490000	4492000	You play as a character named Bentley Bear,
4492000	4497000	and the object is to collect gems on these 3D kind of maps.
4497000	4500000	Part of the game's art style was very unique.
4500000	4503000	You didn't see a lot of games like it at the time.
4503000	4505000	It is an action game.
4505000	4506000	You've got to get through there quickly.
4506000	4508000	If you're too slow, the bees are going to come out.
4508000	4510000	And not the bees, not the bees,
4510000	4512000	and the bees will sting you if you get too close to them.
4512000	4515000	Crystal Castles has nine levels, and there's four castles each.
4515000	4519000	There is a bonus tenth level if you get past everything.
4519000	4521000	There's a map called The End.
4521000	4523000	It's the tenth level with just one.
4523000	4524000	There's the bees!
4524000	4526000	There's the bees, not the bees!
4526000	4530000	You clear the entire game if you're able to beat that tenth board.
4530000	4534000	So there is an ending, which at the time in 1983,
4534000	4536000	there wasn't a lot of video games that had an ending either.
4536000	4537000	So it was a little bit new.
4537000	4541000	It wasn't the first, but there wasn't a lot of games with this.
4541000	4545000	Also, you'll notice that the little song that plays in the background,
4545000	4546000	it's The Nutcracker Suite.
4546000	4549000	Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
4549000	4550000	That's The Nutcracker.
4550000	4552000	So that's the song that plays when it...
4552000	4554000	I should have picked this as a Christmas game.
4554000	4556000	Oh well, a late Christmas title.
4556000	4558000	So anyway, Bentley Baron can jump,
4558000	4560000	and of course you use the trackball to get the different gems.
4560000	4562000	That's what you have, a trackball and a jump button.
4562000	4564000	You pick up gems by walking over them,
4564000	4566000	and once you get the last gem, you get a bonus.
4566000	4569000	But there are enemies that are also trying to get the gems,
4569000	4572000	and you get a lower bonus if they get the last gem.
4572000	4574000	And you get a weird version of the theme that goes,
4574000	4576000	doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
4576000	4579000	It's a really sad version of the theme.
4579000	4581000	Enemies, you can try and avoid them.
4581000	4584000	You can also run over some of them, like the little gem eaters.
4584000	4586000	If you run over them when they're eating a gem,
4586000	4589000	you can actually destroy them, which is kind of neat.
4589000	4592000	So at the beginning of a maze, you get one point for each gem,
4592000	4595000	and that value keeps going up to a maximum of 99.
4595000	4597000	There are hats and honeypots,
4597000	4600000	and that gives you the ability to be able to actually defeat
4600000	4602000	certain enemies in the game.
4602000	4605000	There's trees and all this other stuff, too.
4605000	4608000	So I think I've described the game well enough.
4608000	4610000	Let's talk about some Easter eggs.
4610000	4614000	If you jump 100 times in the southeast corner of level 1
4614000	4616000	and then you clear the maze of gems,
4616000	4619000	Atari will appear on level 2.
4619000	4621000	That's it.
4621000	4625000	On level 5-4, if you kill the witch, Brithilda,
4625000	4628000	and you get to the corner of the area where she was and you jump,
4628000	4631000	you will see the initials FXL.
4631000	4636000	That is a designer of Crystal Castles, Franz X. Lanzinger,
4636000	4638000	because remember, this was back in the age when developers
4638000	4641000	would sneak themselves into games.
4641000	4644000	Crystal Castles used a chip called the Lita chip
4644000	4647000	and a custom trackball controller.
4647000	4650000	The original name of Bentley Bear was Braveheart Bear,
4650000	4653000	but apparently some advocates for Native Americans
4653000	4656000	complained about this name, so they changed the name of that,
4656000	4658000	which is an interesting fact I never realized before.
4658000	4661000	Crystal Castles was ported to all sorts of systems.
4661000	4664000	The Apple II, Atari 2600, Atari 8-bit...
4664000	4666000	I was going to say, the Apple II is what I played this on.
4666000	4669000	The Electron, the ZX Spectrum, the Amstrad CPC.
4669000	4671000	I mean, you name it in the 80s,
4671000	4673000	you think we have a lot of consoles now,
4673000	4675000	but there was a ton of them in the 80s,
4675000	4677000	and Crystal Castles was on just about all of them.
4677000	4679000	There's actually two versions on the Commodore 64.
4679000	4682000	There was a prototype by Atarisoft that wasn't released,
4682000	4685000	and then it was purchased by U.S. Gold and released,
4685000	4687000	and then there was a ThunderVision version.
4687000	4688000	It's kind of interesting there's like two...
4688000	4691000	I'm surprised we haven't seen Atari try to bring this back.
4691000	4693000	Well, since you bring that up,
4693000	4696000	you can pick it up in some different anthologies.
4696000	4699000	Crystal Castles exists in Atari Anniversary Edition,
4699000	4701000	as well as the Atari Vault, which is on Steam,
4701000	4704000	and you play it with a mouse, which isn't the same as a trackball,
4704000	4707000	but it's about the closest you're going to be able to get.
4707000	4711000	Also, did you ever play Atari Karts on the Atari Jaguar?
4711000	4714000	Probably not, but Bentley Bear is one of the characters in that game,
4714000	4717000	and Bentley Bear made a cameo in Wreck-It Ralph.
4717000	4721000	So, there it is, your classic game of the week, Crystal Castles,
4721000	4723000	one of my earliest gaming memories,
4723000	4726000	and just a game I think is really cool.
4726000	4728000	For its age, remember, 1983,
4728000	4730000	there really weren't a lot of games like it.
4730000	4733000	It was a very unique sort of thing in the arcade.
4733000	4735000	You know when I've recently played this?
4735000	4737000	On the arcade 1UP Centipede cabinet,
4737000	4739000	because they have Crystal Castles in there.
4739000	4741000	Oh, yeah.
4741000	4743000	Hey, speaking of those arcade 1UP cabinets,
4743000	4745000	and actually I should go ahead and point out,
4745000	4747000	we're going to open up Discord here shortly,
4747000	4751000	so if you want to join us, you can via the listener roundtable in Discord.
4751000	4754000	You just go to vognetwork.com slash Discord,
4754000	4756000	and you can join the green room,
4756000	4758000	and we'll be getting to some of those calls shortly.
4758000	4760000	I would love to hear from some of you that went to MAGFest,
4760000	4761000	because I couldn't go this year.
4761000	4764000	Not that I'm saying you have to, but I would love to hear from some of you.
4764000	4768000	But anyway, so you were talking about the 1UP cabinets.
4768000	4770000	So did you know? I didn't even know this was a thing now.
4770000	4774000	So we were at Target, because sometimes when you're bored, you go shopping at Target,
4774000	4778000	and we saw now not only do they have the...
4778000	4780000	Well, Target didn't have the arcade ones.
4780000	4782000	They have bar top machines now,
4782000	4784000	and they're only $199.
4784000	4786000	They're a little cheaper, and they're already pre-made.
4786000	4788000	Well, the full-sized ones are $199, too.
4788000	4789000	Oh, do those drop in price?
4789000	4790000	A lot of those did.
4790000	4792000	Oh, I thought they were still $300.
4792000	4795000	Yeah, that's why I've looked at the bar tops.
4796000	4798000	For $200, I might be tempted to finally...
4798000	4800000	Well, we'll see. We'll see.
4800000	4803000	But anyway, the bar top I was looking at was only...
4803000	4804000	They had two.
4804000	4807000	They had a Pac-Man, and I was like, oh, and a Ms. Pac...
4807000	4808000	No, Pac and Pal.
4808000	4809000	So it was Pac-Man and Pac and Pal.
4809000	4815000	And then the other one was Galaxian and Galaga.
4815000	4816000	Yeah.
4816000	4818000	And I was like, I'm not really that...
4818000	4820000	And then you can see on the back there are others.
4820000	4821000	They just weren't at that Target.
4821000	4822000	There's like a Dig Dug and a Dig Dug 2.
4822000	4824000	I thought that one was probably the most interesting for me.
4824000	4827000	But none of the collections really excited me.
4827000	4831000	They didn't seem to have as many games as the stand-up ones do.
4831000	4840000	Yeah, and especially nowadays, you can even find some stores closing out the Ninja Turtles cabinet.
4840000	4842000	The four-player one for $199 as well.
4842000	4845000	So you have to get lucky.
4845000	4848000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, apparently at Consumer Electronics Show,
4848000	4851000	we're going to see Pinball FX arcade one-up cabinets.
4851000	4853000	Three fourth-size digital pinball tables.
4853000	4855000	Well, those arcade one-up machines must be doing very well
4855000	4857000	because it seems like they're cranking them out now.
4857000	4858000	So that's cool.
4858000	4859000	Yeah, pinball will be cool.
4859000	4861000	Yeah, it really will be.
4861000	4866000	So let me check in on Discord and see if anybody is waiting to come on the show
4866000	4867000	because I was bad and I didn't set that up.
4867000	4868000	Yes, we do have one caller waiting.
4868000	4869000	So let's get to it.
4869000	4870000	Let's get to it.
4870000	4871000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4871000	4872000	Who's this?
4872000	4873000	Hey, what's going on, everyone?
4873000	4874000	It is Ranma.
4874000	4875000	Hey, not much.
4875000	4877000	Sorry if there's a little echo back for those listening.
4877000	4878000	I'm trying to fix that in studio.
4878000	4879000	What's up, buddy?
4879000	4880000	Not too much.
4880000	4882000	First of all, let me start with Happy New Year.
4882000	4883000	Thank you very much.
4883000	4885000	You're the first caller of the decade, Ranma.
4885000	4888000	Woohoo!
4888000	4889000	How was your holiday?
4889000	4890000	Did you have a good one?
4890000	4891000	It was good.
4891000	4894000	We had a 1960s-style New Year's Eve party, so that was kind of fun.
4894000	4895000	Oh, that does sound kind of fun.
4895000	4900000	I saw a lot of people did, like, Roaring Twenties kind of parties for, you know,
4900000	4903000	like Flapper Girls and that whole sort of thing.
4903000	4905000	Their theme was a couple of cosplayers.
4905000	4909000	I know they did, like, a whole Sailor Moon Princesses Roaring Twenties theme.
4909000	4911000	I'm just like, that's really cool.
4911000	4915000	And my friend who was running the party, I was like, well, why didn't we do this?
4915000	4918000	And she said, well, we did a Roaring Twenties party a few years ago.
4918000	4922000	And I'm like, so we do a 2.0, you know?
4922000	4924000	Yeah, you can recycle themes.
4924000	4925000	There's nothing wrong with that.
4925000	4928000	Well, what was on your mind tonight that you wanted to call in about?
4928000	4934000	Well, I will say that there was a Roaring Twenties themed party at MAGFest this year.
4934000	4940000	But I will also say that, believe it or not, I'm actually enjoying my Switch a lot more
4940000	4941000	than I thought I would.
4941000	4944000	Wait, did you go to MAG this year?
4944000	4946000	No, I couldn't do it.
4946000	4951000	But if VOG is going next year, Anime Jam Session will follow right behind.
4951000	4958000	It's upgraded from not going to happen to I'm trying to make it happen.
4958000	4963000	The only kind of sticking point is something that actually Bobby brought up on his show
4963000	4964000	as a sticking point for me, too.
4964000	4968000	Because I'm new at my job, I have the lowest amount of seniority on the team.
4968000	4972000	So the weekend that they're doing MAGFest continues to be a challenge because that's
4972000	4975000	still during the holiday period, which a lot of people have off.
4975000	4979000	But most people take the time between Christmas and New Year's Day off.
4979000	4983000	There's not a lot to take right after New Year's Day.
4983000	4986000	So if the timing works out and I'm able to get the time off for it, but I have the least
4986000	4988000	seniority on the team, so I get like last pick.
4988000	4993000	Things like Labor Day, like for Dragon Con, that's easy peasy because most people on the
4993000	4995000	team have kids that are going back to school.
4995000	4997000	They're not going on vacation that week.
4997000	4999000	So I get that.
4999000	5003000	And other stuff is really easy for me.
5003000	5009000	The holidays can be a little harder, but it's on the gonna try list for next year.
5009000	5015000	I definitely hear that because of Leap Year, most likely MAGFest will be the same as New
5015000	5017000	Year's Eve weekend.
5017000	5021000	So you know they're going to party like it's no other tomorrow, you know?
5021000	5023000	I'm really not a fan.
5023000	5028000	That may actually, I can say this definitively.
5028000	5030000	I already have a show commitment.
5030000	5032000	I'm hosting a show on New Year's Eve.
5032000	5034000	I can already say that for this coming year.
5034000	5037000	So if MAGFest is New Year's Eve, I can't do it.
5037000	5043000	Yeah, because one year MAGFest was the same weekend as New Year's Eve and they just went
5043000	5045000	all out for it.
5045000	5048000	Oh gosh, I really hope not.
5048000	5051000	Anyway, so I'm sorry.
5051000	5053000	What were we trying to get you to talk about?
5053000	5055000	What did you want to talk about besides MAGFest?
5055000	5060000	I was going to say I'm really enjoying my Switch a lot more than I thought I would.
5060000	5061000	And why is that?
5061000	5062000	I don't know.
5062000	5066000	I just kept saying that my Switch will be a stay-at-home console.
5066000	5068000	I will play it sparingly.
5068000	5070000	It's just another system to me.
5070000	5074000	And then what I said on Facebook, I got a Switch.
5074000	5075000	Here's my code.
5075000	5082000	I've come to the realization that I have more friends with Switches than PlayStation 4s
5082000	5083000	and Xbox Ones.
5083000	5089000	And I'm just sitting here going, remember when everybody had the Wii and it was either
5089000	5091000	a Wii 60 or a PS Wii household?
5091000	5094000	I remember you mentioned that once.
5094000	5102000	And I'm realizing that now it's becoming people either have the Xbox Switch household or PlayStation
5102000	5104000	Switch household or both.
5104000	5108000	So the Switch has become like the console that basically almost everybody has now.
5108000	5114000	I would say there's still, I mean, I guess maybe I'm just crazy because I have all those
5114000	5117000	consoles, but I think there is definitely some truth to what you're saying.
5117000	5121000	I think, you know, some folks have one of the big consoles and then they also have the
5121000	5122000	Nintendo Switch.
5122000	5127000	You know, it's kind of like a secondary console, but for more and more people, especially in
5127000	5131000	this quiet year where not a lot is happening with PlayStation.
5131000	5134000	Yes, I realize we have Last of Us 2 and Final Fantasy 7 Remake.
5134000	5137000	It's not exactly a totally quiet year, but you guys know what I mean.
5137000	5140000	We're in that kind of lull before the PlayStation 5.
5140000	5143000	So I think more and more people are like actively using their Switch.
5143000	5144000	Yeah.
5144000	5148000	And during the holidays at work, it's been like a lull.
5148000	5150000	So there's not many support tickets coming in.
5150000	5156000	Next thing you know, we actually now have a Switch Fight Club on Fridays.
5157000	5159000	And also one person brings in their console.
5159000	5163000	We're all playing Smash Brothers, either hooked up to the big screen TV or to somebody's
5163000	5164000	work monitor.
5164000	5166000	And we're just, hey, it's 12 o'clock at lunchtime.
5166000	5168000	Grab your controllers, you know?
5168000	5169000	Yeah.
5169000	5170000	So that's cool.
5170000	5172000	I like that you can kind of do that at work.
5172000	5180000	So my industry and my coworkers, I'm lucky now that I have Pokemon Go raids because my
5180000	5182000	building is right in front of a gym.
5182000	5187000	So sometimes if I look in the Citi Discord, I'll see that there's a thing there and there's
5187000	5192000	actually coworkers that all raid that gym with something good pops.
5192000	5194000	So that's about as good as I can get.
5194000	5197000	I mean, I ain't gonna lie.
5197000	5200000	I think it was like Wednesday before New Year's.
5200000	5205000	The supervisors and the managers left and we're all just sitting here.
5205000	5209000	I just pulled up my Switch, sat on my desk, pushed my chair all the way down,
5210000	5214000	reclined all the way back and just started playing some Mario Kart.
5214000	5217000	I wish I could, but my role involves working on projects.
5217000	5221000	So I always kind of have something to do and I'm not customer driven in that regard.
5221000	5225000	So I can't really do that, but that's cool.
5225000	5229000	I mean, hey, maybe I should be doing that type of thing on lunch, but I don't know.
5229000	5231000	We get out walk on lunches.
5231000	5233000	That's the thing to do.
5233000	5235000	I mean, why not both?
5235000	5237000	I mean, you got lunch, breakout, ring fit adventure.
5237000	5240000	Get the whole office into it.
5240000	5242000	I do the GPS gaming while we walk.
5242000	5244000	That's when I play my Pokemon or something.
5244000	5245000	So there is that.
5245000	5248000	Which reminds me because of Loki talking about it.
5248000	5250000	I downloaded that Orna game.
5250000	5253000	So I'm going to try it out tomorrow and see how much I like it.
5253000	5255000	All right. Good luck to you.
5255000	5257000	All I can say is that is in chat right now.
5257000	5258000	And I'll say, look at what you've done.
5258000	5261000	Like the Orna creators owe you a lot of money.
5262000	5263000	So.
5263000	5264000	All right.
5264000	5266000	Well, anything else on your mind, my friend?
5266000	5267000	No, that's it.
5267000	5268000	All right.
5268000	5269000	Well, take care.
5269000	5270000	Have a great 2020.
5270000	5272000	Looking forward to anime jam session being back.
5272000	5274000	And yeah, have a great one.
5274000	5275000	We'll be back next week.
5275000	5280000	And we got a lot of stuff to cover and enjoy the new decade and make it so.
5280000	5281000	Sounds good.
5281000	5282000	Will do.
5282000	5283000	I'll be making it.
5283000	5284000	So March 1st.
5284000	5285000	Take care, buddy.
5285000	5286000	All right.
5286000	5287000	Bye.
5287000	5288000	All right.
5288000	5289000	All right.
5289000	5293000	If you want to call in, head over to our green room over at vog network dot com slash discord.
5293000	5296000	I actually have some emails to read.
5296000	5301000	So every week you guys can email us at participate at orange lounge radio dot com.
5301000	5305000	And we jump into the mailbag and read our favorite emails, which we only have one this week.
5305000	5308000	I will point out we did get a spam email and this is what cracked me up.
5308000	5310000	So we got to I'm not going to say what it's.
5310000	5314000	Well, it's a it's a podcast related service, but I can tell you who it is or what services.
5314000	5315000	But we got spam email.
5315000	5317000	But this cracked me up.
5317000	5318000	You ready?
5318000	5319000	Ready for the opening line?
5319000	5320000	Yes.
5320000	5321000	Now.
5321000	5322000	Hi.
5322000	5325000	I've noticed that your podcast is really starting to gain traction.
5325000	5330000	I mean, that is it is accurate.
5330000	5333840	Doing it for a long time, but it's 17 years.
5333840	5337000	We're just we're just finally starting to get notice.
5337000	5339000	Hey, we got noticed by the spammer guy.
5339000	5341000	I'm so excited.
5341000	5342000	Anyway.
5342000	5345000	Oh, Bobby says, I got the same email.
5345000	5348000	Oh, I'm glad they they must have visited our Web site.
5348000	5349000	Start hitting us all up.
5349000	5350000	I don't know.
5350000	5351000	Anyway.
5351000	5352000	All right.
5352000	5353000	Moving on.
5353000	5356000	We have a much better non spam email from or is it a spam email?
5356000	5357000	I don't know.
5357000	5359000	From Redertainment who emailed us this week.
5359000	5360000	Hello, peoples.
5360000	5365000	Recently, I've made the decision to switch to using Spotify for listening to the podcast.
5365000	5369000	Previously, I was using the iOS podcast app and have now joined the growing horde of people
5369000	5373000	who see that app as a goddamn motherfucking piece of goddamn shit.
5373000	5374000	That is what it says.
5374000	5375000	All apps all run together.
5375000	5376000	Exclamation points.
5376000	5377000	Cool.
5377000	5380000	Most of the podcasts that I was previously listening to are available on Spotify with
5380000	5382000	one notable exception.
5382000	5383000	Orange Lounge Radio.
5383000	5385000	Is there a reason for this?
5385000	5386000	Stay care.
5386000	5387000	Redertainment.
5387000	5392000	I'm sort of I was holding off for reasons that have nothing to do with Spotify.
5392000	5393000	I like Spotify.
5393000	5394000	I use it myself.
5394000	5395000	There's other reasons.
5395000	5398000	I'm hoping that some of those things will get kind of moving.
5398000	5402000	Basically, long story short, we're going to be moving where the podcast is.
5402000	5405000	This is something I've been talking about for like a year, and it's one of those things
5405000	5407000	where I like we just really need to like get up and do it.
5407000	5410000	It's kind of one of those I want to use like some of the creative things you're talking
5410000	5414000	about behind the scene and kind of like just all do it at once like a big Band-Aid ripoff
5414000	5417000	OLR 2020 type of thing.
5417000	5422000	I'm hoping that is something that's going to happen in a matter of weeks, not months.
5422000	5427000	So that's all because I don't want Spotify to point to an old feed and the old feeds
5427000	5432000	not there anymore because I'm already like deathly worried that we're going to lose the
5432000	5434000	Apple side of things.
5434000	5435000	But I'm just yeah.
5435000	5437000	Anyway, I'm talking a little bit in the weeds.
5437000	5442000	I think we have some mechanisms in place that that doesn't happen.
5442000	5444000	Yeah, that's why we're not on Spotify yet.
5444000	5447000	I've really been adding us to any podcast directories.
5447000	5451000	I'm trying to decide if maybe when we change, I might be willing to forgive Stitcher.
5451000	5456000	If you think if you want OLR back on Stitcher, send me a tweet or something
5456000	5460000	that lets me know that because if I don't hear anything, I'm not going to bother.
5460000	5464000	But if there's really enough of you out there that are listening on that and you really want OLR in there,
5464000	5467000	I'll think about it.
5467000	5473000	My problem with them, if you forgot, is that for the longest time they stopped updating their feed
5473000	5477000	with our episodes and people were emailing us going, did you guys quit OLR?
5477000	5478000	And it's like, oh, my God, no.
5478000	5480000	And you can't like stop.
5480000	5483000	Like I was really this is why we're just now gaining traction.
5483000	5484000	That's why we're just now gaining traction.
5484000	5485000	Exactly.
5485000	5489000	That's why I got very irritated with Stitcher for those reasons and others.
5489000	5491000	There's terrible support behind the scenes.
5491000	5495000	But I understand they've switched owners probably three times since then.
5495000	5497000	So I don't know. We'll see. We'll see.
5497000	5500000	So.
5500000	5506000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, my favorite part of that spam email was he asked me to reply with my RSS feed.
5506000	5512000	He sent it to my email address that is only available on my RSS feed.
5512000	5513000	Funny.
5513000	5514000	All right.
5514000	5519000	She Hulk says, put it up on Mixer and YouTube.
5519000	5529000	Jury's out on that one, because keep in mind that subscribing to our VoG network channel here on Twitch is how you get access to the video feed.
5529000	5535000	So we want there to be some car is how you get excuse me, the video on demand so you can watch it when you're not live.
5535000	5542000	I'd be open to maybe a delay or maybe like because part of the Twitch contractor would have to be a delay anyway.
5542000	5544000	And this is not a secret. Everybody knows this.
5544000	5551000	In the affiliate agreement, I might be open to like a six week or a month delay to YouTube.
5551000	5558000	But that is something I'll have to talk over with Bobby and the other creative minds at VoG and figure out if there's a consensus on that.
5558000	5560000	So hope that's fair. So.
5560000	5562000	All right.
5562000	5564000	Swang Tong says, well, they finally took you off on Stitcher.
5564000	5566000	I stopped listening because I thought you quit.
5566000	5569000	Yeah, I kind of had to email him and demand it.
5569000	5572000	Like I hated to be like one of those, like, can I speak to the manager?
5572000	5575000	But I thought it was kind of messed up. It was really messed up.
5575000	5578000	So anyway, that was it from entertainment.
5578000	5581000	This message brought to you by me totally understanding of dark soccer.
5581000	5584000	Didn't want to yell out the long string of expletives I used earlier.
5584000	5586000	Well, lucky you that I read the email tonight, isn't it?
5586000	5591000	So anyway, if you guys have emails for a future week, participate at orange lounge.
5591000	5593000	Trader dot com is the place to do so.
5593000	5595000	Do we have any last minute stories?
5595000	5597000	Yes, you had a couple of things we didn't squeeze.
5597000	5599000	Yes, I did have one thing that I just noticed.
5599000	5603000	So remember why? Well, not a while back, but like within the last week or so,
5603000	5610000	we talked about the brand new PlayStation four dual shock back button attachment
5610000	5616000	that they had where you can do you can attach those programmable back buttons to it.
5616000	5621000	Well, as our initial thought might be, hey, this might be something tied to the PlayStation five.
5621000	5628000	Well, sure enough, come out brand new patent for the dual shock five and it's got back buttons.
5628000	5631000	Did that just come out this evening? That came out this week.
5631000	5633000	I forgot about it. I was like, I don't remember reading about that.
5633000	5638000	OK. Yeah. So they've got. Yeah, it's going to be some back buttons.
5638000	5643000	And I don't know if they're also programmable, but that's why at least.
5643000	5648000	So, you know, you now know that those back buttons were there for a reason.
5648000	5652000	Makes sense. So I saw that coming. That's it.
5652000	5656000	All right. Well, I think with that, we're going to go ahead and close up shop.
5656000	5660000	So I'm sorry to those that didn't get through tonight, but please email us.
5660000	5665000	Participate at Orange Laundry dot com is the place to send an email if you want to get through in a future week.
5665000	5670000	But I think just with it being a holiday week and I keep saying it's going to be a shorter show.
5670000	5674000	I think this one is going to be a shorter show tonight. So that's it.
5674000	5681000	And that's it. Thank you again for being here, despite everything else going on out there tonight with the awesome games and the Globes.
5681000	5685000	And many of you are coming back from MagFest and you're just like, I'm going to bed.
5685000	5688000	I completely understand. So thanks for being here.
5688000	5692000	But many of you I know are listening on the podcast feed throughout the week as an as a result.
5692000	5698000	So thank you to all of you as well. Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the show tonight.
5698000	5701000	Thank you guys for listening. If you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend about the show.
5701000	5704000	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
5704000	5709000	But if the voices aren't here, we can't hear them. A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever you found this podcast.
5709000	5715000	That all goes an awful long way. That being said, Loki, your final thoughts tonight.
5715000	5719000	Still working on my game. It's kind of hard, though, with all the kids demanding.
5719000	5725000	Like I tried to work on it yesterday and today and just every two minutes.
5725000	5730000	It's just I need this. I need something. I need something. I need something. I need something. And that's just the whole family.
5730000	5735000	It's like I can't focus long enough to actually work on something.
5735000	5741000	It's annoying. So I get like two hours a week. I help someone else debug their game, you know,
5741000	5745000	because I got irritated that they were talking about how they run into this.
5745000	5749000	I'm like, just let me look at it. I can fix it, I bet. And then sure enough, I did.
5749000	5755000	All right. Well, that's that's it. We're done. We're wrapped up for tonight.
5755000	5760000	My final thought would be, you know, we're sitting on a January, the first show of the year.
5760000	5764000	It's going to be a very exciting year for games. There's a lot of good stuff coming out.
5764000	5770000	I think I would just say, have fun with it. Video games are fun, people. Keep it fun. Have fun.
5770000	5774000	Gaming is for everyone. That's my final thought. I think we'll leave it on that note.
5774000	5777000	We'll be back in seven days to do it all over again. Have a great gaming week.
5777000	5781000	We're excited for everybody to be back at work and gaming news to come out again this next week.
5781000	5786000	So we'll talk about, there's probably gonna be a lot of it, too, because it'll be built up over the holiday weeks.
5786000	5790000	Hopefully. We'll see. We'll be back to talk about whatever it is in seven days.
5790000	5792000	Until then, have a great week. Happy gaming. Good night.
