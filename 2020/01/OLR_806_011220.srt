This week all I want to say is that D.L. Athera did an incredible thing, likely saving Aiden Jackson's life, especially with I presume an incomplete amount of detail about his personal life. This is the best headline in tonight's news, stay tuned for plenty more, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 806 for this January the 12th of 2020. My name is Rob Roberts and welcome back this week DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hi.

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's great to have you back with us.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Thank you.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Are you enjoying your coffee?

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I am.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Thank you.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And I always appreciate that you will restock any coffee that you take with more coffee.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Well, I just remember-

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Let the coffee flow.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Well, I came by last weekend to bring Alan some books which I still have them have some more in my car.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh really? Okay.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And the, and y'all were gracious enough to give me some coffee and we got into the discussion about-

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's just coffee.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Coffee flavored coffee. And that Alan wanted coffee flavored coffee.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Okay, here's the thing. This is why we talk about coffee flavored coffee because I am a big fan of, you know, we use the little-

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You like the froufrou.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We use the little pre-made pre-packaged cup things that a lot of people use, right? So I like the, like we have cinnamon roll right now. Love that.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm liking the gingerbread with Snickers in it.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
There's gingerbread we got on discount because Christmas is over. We got, you know, I like to get the hazelnut and the vanilla and I have coconut mocha at work.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But Alan is like, I just want coffee flavored coffee. He doesn't like all that stuff.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's like Dennis Leary. I don't want your maple nut crunch. I want coffee flavored coffee.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But yeah, so when I, because I mean, I go to home goods a lot and I go to Ross and you can get K cups at both places relatively inexpensive.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah, I always forget. We always, you know, Target.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Or the grocery outlet. I figure if I'm going to name two places, I'll name three to be fair.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Fair.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But, um, but I happen to be at Ross looking for some organizational stuff and found just like legit medium roast coffee.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And I was like, if I'm going to drink the coffee at Robin Allen's place, I'm going to get coffee that I will drink and that they will like.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So I got the medium roast.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Well, we appreciate it.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You're welcome. So do I.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
For what it's worth, the decaf I usually drink is coffee flavored.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yeah.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Even though it's decaf.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's hard to find flavored decafs.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It is. It is. I know a lot of you would say, what's the point? But it's just, it's like the dessert coffee. I like that.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You know, coffee is dessert.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Well, I found though this gingerbread is really good with that Snickers creamer in it.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Just saying it's really good.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But if you're at my house, so all the coffee at my house is typically coffee flavored coffee.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I get my beans from Phil's.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I will preach the gospel of Phil's coffee until I die.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Or sometimes I'll do temple.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And that's mostly I don't think Phil's really exists.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
No, I first went I went to my first Phil's in L.A.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Oh, OK.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So but it's mostly California West Coast stuff.

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Maybe like one in Arizona.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But they ship.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
OK. Oh, OK.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And I will tell I'll do this. I'll do this.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
One person.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
One person out there. And I will just do this because I'm a nice person.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
If you can pick my.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Favorite kind of chocolate.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
OK, my absolute favorite brand of chocolate.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
OK, I will send you a bag of Phil's filtered soul.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Do they have to send you the chocolate or did you just yell it out in chat?

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
How does this work? They have to they have to email participate.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Oh, OK.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And the first one that guesses my favorite brand of chocolate.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
OK, we'll get a like a half pound or I have to see what I can get,

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
but either half pound or whole pound bag of Phil's filtered soul.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
OK, look at Dark Soccer.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Get in that mail. You can't be in California.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
All right. Participate at Orange Lounge radio dot com.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Why are you excluding California because they can just get it here.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
OK. OK.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Unless you're like in the remote boonies in California, which they exist.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Just say of course.

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But, you know, actually, you know, I don't care if you're in California.

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'll just do it.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Clearly, these rules were not thought out beforehand.

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
OK. No, I just made it up.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So but you have to guess what my favorite brand of chocolate is.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And I will give everyone one hint.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Rob always brings me some back from Chicago.

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
OK. OK. I know what it is. All right.

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You can just come to my house.

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You got to email participate at Orange Lounge radio dot com.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That that mailbag is going to blow up later in the show.

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Hello as well, of course, to Tech Master Loki.

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Hey, what's up every week? Hi. Good.

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I see you're over there playing Orna.

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I have to get the best or the most out of the double experience thing.

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The latest OLR obsession amongst listeners and hosts alike.

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What's up with that, though? You left the party.

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Now you can't see you can't see the blacksmith I built right here.

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I got one of them in my house. OK, fine.

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Fine. I believe the party because I was just carrying you guys.

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And, you know, I, I needed to like get level up.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And I was like, it's just taking so long and I'm getting so much experience.

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Like, oh, all of them are getting some experience.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So I had the bail. Oh, I thought.

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But we weren't giving it back to you.

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It didn't seem like it was going up.

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I heard in the last patch they did something with the balancing

100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
where like you don't benefit from power leveling like it used to be.

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Like you got in the game like right.

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Unfortunately, at the wrong time for that.

103
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah. So I just because once I left the party,

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
like I've been I've gone up like 10 levels.

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So it's it's much faster by myself for now.

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But, you know, if I build anything near your house,

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
or what I've been doing is if I build anything, I may just make it public.

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And so that everybody can benefit from it.

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I just don't touch my territories that I control.

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I saw that earlier.

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Should I challenge his territory?

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm like, nah.

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I've been I've been captured really like too much.

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I've been capturing territory in a bunch of strange places.

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Like I'll just be like I was out like walking along the river the other day,

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
just half fitness, half.

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
There's an Ingress portal out there I was trying to get.

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And I was like, let me bring up Orna.

119
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And I was like, wow, there's like a completely unclaimed region out here,

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
because who the fuck ever comes out here?

121
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Like way in the back booty.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You know, only a crazy ass Ingress player,

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
which why I'm surprised is that didn't have it.

124
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But I guess she didn't think to bring up Orna back there.

125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So I grabbed it.

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And yeah, I I've been finding it in all sorts of like weird places,

127
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
just like regions to control and things like that.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But there's no like there's no like map you can bring up to see where these places are.

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You won't get a list.

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Right. They do.

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And they're supposed to have like I haven't seen it yet,

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
but at least it hasn't been pushed to my device.

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But they have a beta map that's coming where you can actually zoom out a little bit

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
and kind of rotate it and all that stuff.

135
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But oh, I haven't been able to to see that.

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Interesting. I must. Yeah, I must have completely missed that.

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So. All right.

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Well, anyway, let's get into tonight's show.

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It is a podcast about video games.

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I mean, sometimes sometimes, you know, we just were talking about video games,

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
location, cell phone, gaming's is a big part of that.

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So we'll talk a little bit about Pokemon Go later.

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I know that's in the news.

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
There's been a lot of Pokemon news this week.

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But first, we want to take a step back and take a look at last year,

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
because we have yet to really talk about our top video games of twenty nineteen.

147
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We have put it off a little bit because we wanted time to play more games.

148
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And then we weren't able to do it last week because Dark Sakura was unexpectedly gone.

149
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But she's back tonight.

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And so we can talk about our top games of twenty nineteen.

151
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So and I gave full disclosure on saying what happened.

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Oh, yeah. We talked about it, you know.

153
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So but I wanted just to take a moment and thank everyone who did reach out.

154
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So Dan and I appreciate it.

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
We've been going through.

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We found some very interesting things like turtles, the genitalia,

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
like ceramic turtles, not like ceramic turtles.

158
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes, but but we've also found like just like little things that Dan had done when he was a kid,

159
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
like like those art plates. Oh, yeah, sure.

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And some of his like a little bit of video game stuff around.

161
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We reclaimed our laser desks. OK, so but just very interesting things.

162
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
All right. Well, you know, that's the nice thing about having done the show for so long and doing it live is that,

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
you know, people around here gender genuinely care about each other.

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So including the listeners care about us and and I care about most of you.

165
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
No, I don't want to I don't want to cheapen the moment with a joke.

166
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I do I do care as well. So definitely we all look out for each other.

167
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So I know a lot of people looking out for you guys last week, so it's great to have you back.

168
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Thank you. But tonight we're going to move into our top games of twenty nineteen.

169
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So I know it's a little bit delayed, but we're not quite to January 15th yet.

170
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I think for some people, the holidays don't end until tomorrow. So we'll get into that now.

171
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Let's talk about our top games of the year. So each of us has picked three games using any criteria we want.

172
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
OK, this is not it's not your games. It's our games.

173
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So these lists are not wrong.

174
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:46,000
They're not rigged because we used whatever criteria we damn well play pleased in order to come up with our top three games of the year.

175
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So here they are. I'll pick on Loki. Why not? Why don't you go first?

176
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We number your number three pick your number three game of the twenty nineteen.

177
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Let's see. So my number three game is going to be Minecraft Earth, I guess.

178
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
OK. Oh, interesting. A game that's still kind of not done.

179
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Well, neither is the official Minecraft. True.

180
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Although I noticed I actually brought up Minecraft Earth this week and they've there's already more like tutorial stuff there that wasn't there before.

181
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah, there's not much tutorial you really need for that game. I mean, I don't know.

182
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah, it's been kind of fun. I play it every now and then. I don't play it a ton because there's not a whole lot of reason to go and collect things aside from getting experience.

183
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But even the experience is just kind of like it unlocks some more places he can build stuff.

184
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But any of the stuff that I build, I end up just, you know, basically bulldozing the whole thing and just starting from scratch.

185
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But you can get different biomes and stuff and whatnot.

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But you never really run out of like blocks to build with because you collect so many in the course of playing the game.

187
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So, I know if it wasn't such a battery sink, I'd probably play it a whole ton more. But yeah, it really just drains that battery.

188
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Well, and from a technological perspective, it is accomplishing like something kind of new, something really neat, you know?

189
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah, the AR stuff is pretty fun. It's actually really cool.

190
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yeah, like, you know, Pokemon Go just got the whole AR buddies take pictures of your Pokemon buddies.

191
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah, this is way more elaborate.

192
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
This Minecraft Earth thing is already like steps and steps beyond that.

193
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Like the AR stuff, and it works pretty good too, actually. So the AR stuff, they have the little adventures.

194
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's basically just playing Minecraft with like a small square block, like 16 by 16 or whatever.

195
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And a lot of it you're just kind of walking over, you're kind of hovering over it.

196
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And you're just kind of digging stuff out.

197
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And a lot of times it could be just killing some enemies and then there may be some golden diamond down there.

198
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Or it could be you're solving a puzzle and then you get more like, you know, resources that way.

199
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But it's pretty interesting and they have a ton of them at parks and they pop in and out like every few minutes.

200
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And I mean, so you can keep doing that over and over and get a lot of resources that way.

201
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But then there's also the fact if you die, you lose everything that you have in your inventory, like Minecraft.

202
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So you have to be careful what you, well, not your full inventory.

203
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You basically have, you know, like in regular Minecraft where you have a bar full of stuff in it.

204
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So you can take into those adventures one row of things and then you just have to be careful.

205
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Like if you start to die, then you exit out.

206
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But you just have to be careful.

207
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The only time that the game's been kind of cheap on me is like I'll be like mining stuff.

208
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I've already killed all the enemies and all of a sudden there's a skeleton that comes from behind.

209
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm like, what the fuck? You know, why is there a skeleton here all of a sudden?

210
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
But usually a lot of that, like if I'm getting bum rushed by a few things, I can just like exit, close it, and you're fine.

211
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
All right. Minecraft Earth. Good pick. Something I think we'll see more of probably as we move into 2020.

212
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Dark Sakura, we'll go to you. What's your number three game of 2019?

213
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Death Stranding. Because...

214
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I kind of figured that would show up on your list somewhere.

215
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I didn't play it, but I enjoyed watching the fuck out of it.

216
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And for me, that's all I really wanted out of it was just the story.

217
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I thought the story was really interesting and kind of a mind fuck and that's kind of up my alley.

218
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So, I mean, it was the closest I could get to having that weird brain fuck of Silent Hill.

219
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So I was cool with it. And Bridge Baby is adorable.

220
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And Lindsay Wagner.

221
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Bridge Baby.

222
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And people apparently really enjoy urinating in front of Conan O'Brien's little area.

223
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Bridge Baby.

224
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I think Dark Sakura would be one of them if she was playing it regularly, but...

225
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Well, I'd have to have a Go-Girling game.

226
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
What do you think about...

227
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Because that's the only way I could whip out a dick and pee.

228
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Well, that's OK. You're taking on the role of Norman Reedus, so you're whipping out his dick to...

229
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Well then, some people would really be into that.

230
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Dear Mr. Reedus, are you aware that people are whipping out your dick?

231
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
There was...

232
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I didn't consent to this.

233
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I posted something on Twitter where it's like, is it weird that we force him to go to the bathroom and poop and then we get served an ad for...

234
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Well, you know, with the amount of rock, or was it...

235
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Monster energy drinks he's drinking in the game, then it's no wonder he has to use the bathroom all the time because Jesus Christ.

236
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
What's that doing to your insides as I sip my 12-ounce Red Bull?

237
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I know you haven't really sat down and played the game and you're more into it for the story,

238
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
but I know for the longest time here on OLR, the what the fuck is Death Stranding was kind of like...

239
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I still don't know.

240
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It was kind of like the running gag on the show, but now that we understand this is the game, this is the point, this is what you're playing,

241
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
what do you think about how that all turned out?

242
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Because for me, I was always expecting it to be something a little more action-y or something, and it's very much not that, but I'm OK with that.

243
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm totally OK with what it is.

244
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Hmm. Well, in the end, it's I think about the connections that we have with each other,

245
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and also about the dangers inherent to having connections with others.

246
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You know, it's definitely that sort of isolationist versus expansionist point of view.

247
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You know, if you even think about it on a global scale, it can really be applied almost in a political spectrum.

248
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's very allegorical to things that we see going on around us today.

249
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:41,000
For me, I just like the fact that it lets you know that there is really no one right way versus a wrong way.

250
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But sometimes if you...

251
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's really kind of hard to describe, you know.

252
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And then also the thing that I like, too, is that it went through sort of the discussion of duty versus individual desire,

253
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:07,000
and what some people will do for, like, Die Hard Man and his duty, and what he did in the name of his duty,

254
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and then how it affected him the rest of his life.

255
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Sort of like it's the I was just following orders thing versus making your own moral decision for yourself.

256
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
The individual characters just were really... Dead Man was another interesting one.

257
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Just kind of a moral thing. Is this a person? Does it have a soul?

258
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm not trying to go too much in because people are still playing it, you know.

259
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But there was so much depth and thought that went into everything in it.

260
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And people are just like... People are uncomfortable with, I think, doing the deep dive in the story elements with it.

261
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And so for them, it's easier just to make fun of it. Or say, oh, it was weird, blah, blah, blah.

262
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
People are like that. People don't want to take a deep dive into disturbing topics.

263
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But the moment that you do, you find part of your view of life is a little bit expanded.

264
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And I honestly think that the game did ask some of those more ambiguous moral questions of the player.

265
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,000
What do you think of this? Forcing them to look at these things, life and death, and moral decisions,

266
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
and the communication and connections of other people, and kind of evaluate that in themselves.

267
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Deep. I need to spend more time with it. Honestly, I got sidetracked by other games.

268
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But I enjoyed what I played of it, for sure.

269
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That's the way I like games like that. I like Detroit for some of the same things.

270
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's just... I like a question that a game asks.

271
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:52,000
When it asks a question that's going to have a deep impact philosophically on your worldview. Just saying.

272
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
The other thing I want to mention about that game is the soundtrack.

273
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Love the church's song. A lot of hipster music, I suppose. But it's all really good.

274
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
There's some really good stuff in there. So, all right. Death Stranding it is.

275
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
My number three pick is going to be kind of an obvious, like, oh, of course he's going to say something like that.

276
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
But I think this really deserves it in many ways.

277
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And I'm going to say the Final Fantasy XIV Shadowbringers expansion will be my number three game of the year.

278
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Just because I think the expansion was very strong with what it brought to the game.

279
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You know, just kind of upping the formula that they started with Realm Reborn.

280
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
But really, you know, perfecting it, making a lot of job classes a little more tighter and a little more fun.

281
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Like, for example, you know, they took the job Machinist and it was a little bit clunky, relied a little bit on luck.

282
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
They injected a little bit of Edgar from Final Fantasy VI into it.

283
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So, like, now you have a Bioblaster and an autocrossbow and stuff.

284
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And let me tell you, it is really fucking fun.

285
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Oh, and drill. Drill is important, too.

286
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Like, it's like they take a lot of this fantasy stuff.

287
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You're like, I don't know how this would ever work in an MMO, but they do it and it's great.

288
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And never mind the story, which, you know, was really good.

289
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You know, not to get too spoilery, but the kind of the trick about it is that it doesn't really take place in the same world that the rest of the game does.

290
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'll sort of kind of keep it vague.

291
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
But I think that actually really helps for an expansion kind of story.

292
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:27,000
That it's a little bit more like, oh, now our adventurers are over here doing this thing, but there's all these complicated problems that go with that.

293
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And I think it allowed the story to play out very, very well.

294
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I didn't love the ending compared to some of the other expansions, but I have enjoyed the patch content this week.

295
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I finally finished up the most recent patch, the 5.1 patch.

296
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And I did like how that kind of wrapped up and where that went in that story.

297
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And of course, the developers continue to do an amazing job supporting the game post launch with regular patches, which not every MMO is doing that well anymore.

298
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So I think they really get kudos for running just a really strong premier MMO right now.

299
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And what might be the strongest expansion they'll ever do, which they just put out.

300
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I mean, I hope, of course, whatever they do next might even go a step beyond that.

301
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But if this is as good as it gets, it's been pretty damn good. So I will take it.

302
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So there you go. I pick Final Fantasy XIV Shadowbringers. It's my number three game of the year.

303
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So let's get to the second choices on the list.

304
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So far, everybody's got different games. I was thinking there'd be more overlap. I think there will be later, but we'll see.

305
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Here we go. Loki, your number two game.

306
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
My number two game is going to be What the Golf.

307
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That is pretty fun. I've been enjoying it.

308
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,000
My one of my favorite indie games of the year. So, yeah, I've enjoyed playing it quite a bit.

309
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So I haven't finished it yet. So I'll have to go back to it at some point.

310
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
But definitely worth checking out, especially if you have Apple Arcade or something like that, because it's part of that.

311
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What is it about this game that you love so dang much?

312
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's just because it's like it's got this street, a strange like kind of Katamari feel to it, just like with the music and everything.

313
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And it's just a strange like it's not even really about golf. It's just kind of a strange like puzzle game.

314
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And I don't know, it just it's got a weird aesthetic to it. That's charming.

315
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
OK. Yeah. All right. What the golf? Number two.

316
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Dark Sakura, how about you? Your number two pick.

317
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm going to pick Resident Evil 2 because I fucking enjoy the shit out of it.

318
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
A lot of people did. You're not alone.

319
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Resident Evil 2, honestly, I liked better than the first one, and I really loved the first one.

320
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
But Resident Evil 2 was the one that cemented my love for the series and the voice acting was top notch.

321
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I kind of liked where they had some variations from the original version.

322
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And I'm also glad this is going to lead to a Resident Evil 3.

323
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So I also love watching people break that game. It's just fucking hilarious.

324
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
But I really, I really enjoyed it. There's a lot to look at.

325
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Little Easter eggs, lots of things that, you know, if you can get the game where you can look around the scenery,

326
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
it's just absolutely in-depth and beautiful. And I really enjoyed it.

327
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Although it makes me think, why the hell do people build these weird ass puzzles in a police station?

328
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Like, really, people? What the fuck were you thinking? Were you a cult?

329
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So anyway, that's it. No, Silent Hill was about the cult.

330
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Anyway, you're not alone in our chat. ActDeft in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network,

331
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
because we do, I don't think I've said this line yet tonight,

332
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
but we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,

333
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
right after the Bobby Blackwell show at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network.

334
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And if you're here live, you can chat along with our show.

335
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And we read some of the comments here, including folks agreeing with Dark Soccer,

336
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
including ActDeft, who says Resident Evil 2 deserves the praise. It was a really well done remake.

337
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
And Quest Buster says, I enjoyed the shit out of the Resident Evil 2 remake also.

338
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
The speedruns for Resident Evil 2 are really fun to watch.

339
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Okay.

340
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Alright, so a lot of love for Resident Evil 2. I guess at some point I'll have to get around to playing the remake.

341
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
You know, you all know how I am with the gory games, but I remember playing the original on PlayStation.

342
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's not that gross.

343
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Yeah, it's not that gross. So I'll deal with it.

344
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Alright, my number two pick in the meantime, though, I'm going to go with an indie pick as well.

345
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And this is just one of those games that is just style, style, style, and the music was stellar, stellar, stellar.

346
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And I love the presentation. It was kind of a short, simple game.

347
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
But y'all know I love the games that are just art and simple and a hell of a lot of fun.

348
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And that's why I would say Sayonara Wild Hearts is my number two game of the year.

349
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
That's a good one.

350
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Yeah.

351
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I really enjoyed it.

352
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I loved it. And the soundtrack is great. I can listen along to it in the car.

353
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
The gameplay is simple, yet there is so much to pursue in the name of perfection.

354
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Certainly my music gaming roots have a lot to do with that, even though I wouldn't necessarily call Sayonara Wild Hearts a music game.

355
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It feels a little more like elements as elements.

356
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Exactly.

357
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I say it's more like I think I've always called it.

358
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It's the Sonic two bonus level as a game.

359
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's like kind of racing, kind of not.

360
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So but that's I've really been enjoying it on Apple Arcade.

361
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Yeah, I've done most of my play on the switch.

362
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
But I can totally see how this game would work easy on phones because it is basically just motion.

363
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm sure you can just drag and then tap or something because it's just motion and a button.

364
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
That's pretty much how it is.

365
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Yeah, exactly.

366
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Act F in chat says I need to pick up Sayonara Wild Hearts.

367
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It's on sale this week on the switch.

368
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So, yeah, I think the sale's a good time to pick up the game.

369
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So there you go.

370
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
All right.

371
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
That leaves us with the best around number one game of the year.

372
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Loki, your game of the year.

373
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
My number one pick of the year, I guess, is going to be Borderlands three.

374
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Are we on number one already?

375
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Yeah.

376
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I thought we were on number two.

377
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
No, you just did Resident Evil 2.

378
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
No, you did Resident Evil 2.

379
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
That was my number two.

380
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
OK.

381
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
No, that's all right.

382
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
All right.

383
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Number one is Borderlands 3.

384
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Oh, OK.

385
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Because it's more Borderlands.

386
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
You don't think now I've heard some people got a little tired of the formula this time around, but not for you.

387
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
No, it's still fine.

388
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I haven't played through the DLC stuff yet, but it's all right.

389
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah, it's it.

390
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,000
You know, it's not as exciting as the first game when you first get into it, because we've done this a few times now.

391
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
But it's still all right.

392
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It's still enjoyable.

393
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah.

394
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
All right.

395
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So there's going to they're going to still continue to support that with more DLC expansions.

396
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Yeah.

397
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Like three more pieces of DLC outer two or three.

398
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Not even close to the end.

399
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Some at some point I'll have to jump into it.

400
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
But I never finished Borderlands one.

401
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
But I did kind of like get more into Borderlands one.

402
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And, you know, I played I put.

403
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Yeah, I probably dropped like at least 15 hours in that game, if not more.

404
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
So, yeah, I have a lot of fun with that series.

405
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
So.

406
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
All right. Cool.

407
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Borderlands three.

408
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I guess I I don't know why I didn't even think of that for you, but makes sense.

409
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You're number one pick game of the year.

410
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Cool.

411
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
All right.

412
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Dark soccer.

413
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It's all about you.

414
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Number one.

415
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
First blood stained.

416
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Whoo.

417
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
OK.

418
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Bloodstained was beautiful.

419
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
It was my my Symphony of the Night wet dream.

420
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
It was challenging.

421
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It was in depth.

422
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I had so many things in it now with the new game.

423
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Plus is pretty fun to go back and grab things that we didn't have and start off the game ridiculously overpowered.

424
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Absolutely beautiful.

425
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
The voice acting was great.

426
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I really can't stand up good about it.

427
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
The PS4 to me, after having seen the other ones in motion, is the definitive one to play.

428
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I think is the most balanced.

429
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And definitely it was well worth the wait.

430
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Although I will say, if you have an Xbox Game Pass PC or I think Xbox one, you can grab it.

431
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
So like, you know, there's not a lot stopping you and jumping in and enjoying the game as well.

432
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And I know you're not alone in that because, well, for one, our chat rooms lighten up quite a bit.

433
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
But also I've met other people that think Bloodstained is just like the best thing they've absolutely played all year.

434
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And yeah, I enjoyed it.

435
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I really had a great time with it.

436
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And the thing for me is that it really did just hit that thing I was missing in some of those other Castlevania games that followed the formula.

437
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
This really had the touch back to it.

438
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And of course, you know, some of the character nods back to the I love the portraits of the developers in the background that will just attack you.

439
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I love that.

440
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And I love the one where because I figured those were Kickstarter rewards.

441
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So most of those are like actual people.

442
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
But one of them is a cat.

443
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And I love that.

444
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I love the giant cats.

445
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I wish I'd paid for Mr.

446
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Smoosh to be one of the paintings in that maybe if they do a Bloodstained 2 and they offer portrait awards.

447
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I'll try to I'll try to get some money together and get a portrait of Mr.

448
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Smoosh.

449
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I want them to bring back my guy, though.

450
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Zungotsu.

451
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Because he was my guy.

452
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Did you get that far?

453
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
No, I didn't get that far.

454
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
OK.

455
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Yeah.

456
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
So.

457
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Spoilers.

458
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
All right.

459
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
That's all right.

460
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
That's right.

461
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
All right.

462
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So Bloodstained game of the year.

463
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It's from a girl that probably enjoyed Castlevania Symphony the night.

464
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Even Rondo of blood than most people.

465
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Which is a lot.

466
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Did I tell you that that was that Dan sat me down when I first moved out here.

467
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Put the game in front of me.

468
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I said, you're fucking playing this.

469
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And this is like the determining factor of our relationship.

470
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Wasn't it something like I'm not going to date anyone who can't beat this game or something like that.

471
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Something like that.

472
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Yeah.

473
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And I beat it several times over.

474
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I loved it.

475
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I found like boundary breaks for it.

476
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It was fun.

477
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And then then just to prove my love to him.

478
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I beat Strider on Genesis.

479
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Love it.

480
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Yeah.

481
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Better relationships through video games.

482
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
All right.

483
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
This is going to be interesting because this is the first year where we're going to have zero overlap on any of our list.

484
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Because my number one is not from your list and it's not from your list.

485
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
It's different.

486
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I thought you would pick this dark soccer.

487
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I'm kind of surprised.

488
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Honk.

489
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
But that's no it's actually not.

490
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
It's not honk.

491
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I I'll talk about honk.

492
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I finally played that game in this last week too.

493
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I'll talk about that later.

494
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
No.

495
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
My number one pick is a game that I don't think everybody would put as their number one pick.

496
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Especially if you read a lot of social media because some people really weren't fans of this game.

497
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
But I think they're hating on it for the wrong reasons.

498
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And if you actually sit down and you play this game and you see some of the improvements that they've made with this really long running franchise.

499
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You're going to see that they've really put a full tank of gas into something that was you know kind of for me anyway running on low fumes with some of the most recent releases.

500
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Obviously I'm talking about Pokemon Sword and Shield and that is my absolute top game of the year.

501
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I think I think what they've done with the series is amazing.

502
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I think the raids have been transformative for how you can get through the game and it doesn't like feel like grinding so much.

503
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And yes we'll talk about the Pokemon Direct later in the show.

504
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And yes I think it's really exciting news for the series and I'm just I'm just a fan.

505
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And the fact that I've probably bought almost every Pokemon generation at least one game at some point.

506
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Maybe not in like gens 2 and 3.

507
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I might skip some of the early gens.

508
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
But like the fact that I've probably bought a Pokemon game but never been motivated to really play it through to completion.

509
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
But this time I did and I did relatively quickly.

510
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Not not not saying like it didn't take me long to beat but just saying like I sat down and I focused and I was like I will beat this game because I am having a good time playing it.

511
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I think speaks volumes and I think is why it's my game of the year and it's it's I think going to continue to carry legs long in the next year as well.

512
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So I'm really excited about that.

513
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
That is for sure.

514
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
So act deft in chat saying Rob I love you.

515
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Thank you.

516
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Sword and Shield did a lot of things right.

517
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
That the bad gets like really overshadowed sword and shield are so enjoyable.

518
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Well you know what for all the national Dexter's where you want to call it on Twitter.

519
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Like if they can just get past that little bit of salt that they have and actually sit down and spend some time with the game like actually play it.

520
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I think the proof is right there.

521
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I think some of the changes they've made go a long way in what they're trying to do.

522
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'll say this is the first Pokemon game I really enjoyed playing on a console.

523
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
At the same time it wasn't enough to make it my number one.

524
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It's fun.

525
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
It's enjoyable.

526
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
It's great.

527
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
The play is solid.

528
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It really has improved.

529
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,000
It just isn't compelling enough story wise to put it over the top for me because I am about the story.

530
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I understand.

531
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
And like 80 percent of those things you just said would be me with Bloodstained.

532
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Like I liked it.

533
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I don't know if it's my top three but I liked it.

534
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Yeah.

535
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
So I get it.

536
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I get it.

537
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
So yeah.

538
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And it's not it's not perfect.

539
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Like it does have some technical issues especially when you're connected online which have to do with lol Nintendo online.

540
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
But dammit I think this is the best Pokemon has ever been.

541
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And yeah in part I'm putting it number one on my list to kind of make a point that like I think a lot of people on social media are getting it very very well.

542
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:31,000
But the good news is it doesn't matter the loud stuff on social media for people who probably haven't bothered to play it because the game is selling cuckoo bananas very well.

543
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
So I hope that's the type of thing that the Game Freak team and the folks behind are looking at.

544
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And sometimes you just have to kind of just not check your mentions on Twitter.

545
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And I think that's probably best for those guys.

546
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So anyway there it is.

547
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So our top games of the year.

548
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
There they are.

549
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
So what do we have.

550
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
What do we have.

551
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
We had Minecraft Earth.

552
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
What the golf.

553
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Borderlands 3.

554
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Right.

555
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Then we had Death Stranding.

556
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Resident Evil 2.

557
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Resident Evil 2.

558
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Bloodstained.

559
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Bloodstained.

560
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And then I think my list has been more conventional.

561
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Yeah.

562
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Which is odd but whatever.

563
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Final Fantasy 14 Shadowbringers expansion.

564
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Sayonara Wild Hearts and Pokemon Shield I guess if you have to pick one.

565
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
But you know what I mean.

566
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I would like to offer some honorable mentions.

567
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I think the Untitled Goose Game was great.

568
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I also liked Patterned on Apple Arcade and Tint.

569
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I loved what the golf.

570
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Sayonara Wild Hearts is definitely a fun one for me.

571
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I just.

572
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I didn't bring up any of the iOS stuff just because I would be here all day naming things on Apple Arcade that I have intensely enjoyed playing.

573
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And they released more stuff for Patterned so that's kind of like my solitaire I guess because I love puzzles.

574
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,000
And I like artwork and I like being able to see how the art fits together so those are some honorable mentions for me.

575
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Biggest honorable mention for me that wasn't named anywhere else was Zelda Link's Awakening.

576
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I thought the you know the redo version.

577
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Oh yeah it was really good too.

578
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I don't know why I didn't think about it.

579
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I know I know right.

580
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So it was just it was it was great though.

581
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
It was a very solid game.

582
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I guess I'd mention even though I don't really get to play much of it other than see what my children put together but Mario maker too.

583
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And absolutely something that's worthy of the list as well.

584
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
So especially I just don't get to play my Switch anymore unfortunately.

585
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,000
So that's why I don't have any of those games like Zelda which I do own but haven't been able to play.

586
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And and even like this was a Breath of the Wild.

587
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I bought that this year too.

588
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Can't play it though because my kids take the thing and then my wife wants me to watch TV at night.

589
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
So you know that's OK.

590
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,000
You can always get the Switch Pro and then give the old Switch to your kids even though no because it's all digital.

591
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And it tells I don't know how to make accounts work with other switches.

592
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I love it.

593
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
All right.

594
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Cool our top games of the year.

595
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
There they are.

596
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So guess what.

597
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Now is the point.

598
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Now this is it like a new OLR tradition is that we talk about a lot of stuff on this show.

599
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
In fact sometimes it's hard to remember the things that we even discuss from week to week here on this very program.

600
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Let alone the crazy people again.

601
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
What's up.

602
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Who are you people again.

603
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I don't know.

604
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I don't know how to get this house.

605
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm kidnapping me.

606
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
So what we did starting a couple years ago we started putting together a time capsule.

607
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And you know gaming changes a lot in a year.

608
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Like look at this year.

609
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,000
We're going to have at least three four four new consoles coming out in the next year.

610
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I'm counting the Atari VCS which maybe I shouldn't be.

611
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
No.

612
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And also the Intellivision Amico.

613
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I can.

614
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I can.

615
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:52,000
But then of course the PlayStation 5 the Xbox Series X grab a hell and maybe something from Nintendo all that that would still be still be you know theory theorizing at this point.

616
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
So you know not only we have new consoles but the point is the way things look like in a year not going to be the way they look like today.

617
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And that is like always true in gaming.

618
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So it's it's going to be really fun to look back and see what crazy shit did we think.

619
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:13,000
What do we think we're going to find in here because I think this is probably loaded with shit that says like how did Animal Crossing turn out.

620
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Did Jamie quit the show because she's playing Animal Crossing full time.

621
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
That's which the gag is of course.

622
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
But I can't remember if I did this last year the year before last if we did that.

623
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,000
But I believe that the year prior stuff is also in there because they had shoved those also.

624
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Why did we put two years with this because it's not going to.

625
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Nothing changes.

626
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
That's why God.

627
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
All right.

628
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Dark soccer anything you want to say before I open this and run through it because apparently there's a ton of stuff in here.

629
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
OK.

630
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
We're going to make a little.

631
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Which was appropriate is the Darth Vader cup.

632
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I don't also put candy in there to be like oh candy.

633
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Is there candy in here.

634
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
No but that'd be cool though like because we'll forget it next year.

635
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Oh candy.

636
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
First piece of paper says anticipated games.

637
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Number one Animal Crossing.

638
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
This is my handwriting.

639
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Number two Metroid Prime 4.

640
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
That didn't happen either.

641
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Well you were anticipating it was anticipating it.

642
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Number three Harry Potter wizards unite.

643
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I forgot all about that.

644
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
That's not all right.

645
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I mean it just kind of got lost in the GPS game shuffle but it was all right.

646
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And then number four Pokemon Gen 8.

647
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Hey I got that one.

648
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I got that one.

649
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
All right.

650
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Next up.

651
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
O.L.R. may earn enough money for bus tickets to PAX.

652
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I will say this.

653
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Thanks to you guys being very generous with the biddies and the subs and our move to Twitch and all that good stuff.

654
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
We probably.

655
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Bus tickets.

656
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Yeah we probably made enough to buy bus tickets to PAX.

657
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
We'll come back from PAX though.

658
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Well when I say we I'm also counting Bobby Black Wolf and everything else at VoG.

659
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
But I.

660
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Yeah I mean just a big thank you to everybody that does that stuff because it does count.

661
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Most of that money has really gone into paying for the cost of running a legitimate business because believe it or not that stuff is expensive.

662
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And you know we have like you know legal things and document filing and all that stuff.

663
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
But I mean the fact is that doesn't come out of our pockets anymore.

664
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Which is a great feeling because you know I was paying for that old radio feed and now we don't have to anymore.

665
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
So that's really cool.

666
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
So anyway.

667
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Next up.

668
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
God I wrote a lot.

669
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
What the fuck.

670
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I just.

671
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Oh chat predictions.

672
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Oh God.

673
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
A whole thing about chat predictions.

674
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Oh.

675
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Oh y'all ready to turn the tables because I see some of your names on this.

676
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
OK.

677
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Here we go.

678
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
This is She-Hulk projected a portable Xbox.

679
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
But the cloud.

680
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
So like it's easy to say oh you got that one wrong She-Hulk but maybe I would say only half.

681
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Yeah there's X cloud.

682
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
There's X cloud and that is going to make Xbox portable.

683
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So I'm going to give She-Hulk partial credit.

684
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
So you get half of Miss Cleo award for that.

685
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
All right.

686
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
ActDeft put Pokemon 8th gen delay.

687
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
No cookie for you.

688
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
It didn't get delayed.

689
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Bobby put Microsoft stops at most audio.

690
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I don't even know if that was a thing that happened.

691
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Did they.

692
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I don't even know.

693
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I know he was having problems with his home theater and that's probably where this comment came from.

694
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
But that's what he had said.

695
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Sia Tabiri said new Mario spin off.

696
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I don't think we got one of those either.

697
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
It didn't happen really.

698
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
You'd have to really dig.

699
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I don't know.

700
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I don't think that happened.

701
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:44,000
VidPower said established game battle royale spin off.

702
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Well they've had several of those.

703
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
They were really spin offs but like you could say Forza Horizon has battle royale mode.

704
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Tetris 99.

705
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Tetris 99.

706
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
That was last year though.

707
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
No it wasn't in 2019.

708
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
That was 2019.

709
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
That was 2019.

710
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Was it?

711
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
2019 releases.

712
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:07,000
So yeah actually I'm going to give that to VidPower because Tetris having a battle royale spin off.

713
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Ding ding ding.

714
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Fallout 76 did it.

715
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Call of Duty did it.

716
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Yeah.

717
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Oh everybody did it.

718
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
All right.

719
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Pop Culture said Dreamcast classic.

720
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Oh how I would love for you to be right but you're wrong.

721
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
We just have to wait longer for that.

722
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And Fifth Dream said Final Fantasy 7 remake cancelled.

723
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Whoops at you.

724
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Okay.

725
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
All right.

726
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Moving on.

727
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Moving on.

728
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Oh this is a big one.

729
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Here it is.

730
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
N64 classic released holiday 2019.

731
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Nope.

732
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Nope.

733
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
That didn't happen.

734
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
That didn't happen.

735
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Let's see.

736
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Next one.

737
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Detective Pikachu movie didn't suck.

738
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Ding ding ding.

739
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
That is true.

740
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
That is true.

741
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Absolutely didn't suck.

742
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
That's your handwriting right?

743
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
That is probably my handwriting yes.

744
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Loki's handwriting.

745
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Detective Pikachu didn't suck.

746
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
It was.

747
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
It was great.

748
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,500
It was pretty damn good actually as far as video game movies go and gonna get a sequel

749
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,000
and I don't think we hate it.

750
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
So cool.

751
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
All right.

752
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
My handwriting.

753
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,760
Did they finally get online right with Animal Crossing since they plan to charge for it.

754
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,760
Don't know yet.

755
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,760
Ask in three months Rob.

756
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,760
All right.

757
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,000
I told you it was gonna be nothing but Animal Crossing shit in here.

758
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Loki's handwriting.

759
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
New AR gaming console.

760
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
No.

761
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
No.

762
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
No.

763
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
No.

764
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
You should have went with cloud.

765
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Would have got that.

766
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
But yeah.

767
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Cloud sucks.

768
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
All right.

769
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Next up.

770
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
My handwriting.

771
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Next.

772
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Next Xbox announced but no PS5.

773
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
What was I thinking.

774
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Game pass console to hold us over.

775
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Nah.

776
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Oh.

777
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I was thinking there was gonna be a console like dedicated to like digital.

778
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I think I was thinking something even smaller than that Xbox One X or whatever.

779
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
What the hell was on the digital.

780
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
The digital only.

781
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
The digital only one.

782
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I was thinking a smaller more bare bones version of that.

783
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Yeah.

784
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Yes.

785
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
The Xbox sad.

786
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Thank you.

787
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Oh.

788
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Right.

789
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
As far as I'm like where the hell's dark soccer's handwriting.

790
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I think this is it.

791
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Amazon's new streaming game service will not overcome steam or the console market.

792
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Well.

793
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Amazon has a streaming game service.

794
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
That is true.

795
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
All right.

796
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Next up.

797
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I know I remember something about that being in the news.

798
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Well I think that this just hasn't happened yet.

799
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Replace it with stadium.

800
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
It's still true.

801
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
This is my handwriting.

802
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Tiger claw.

803
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Let's you guys are going to scream.

804
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
You ready.

805
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Tiger call is not.

806
00:42:50,000 --> 00:43:07,000
The sonic movie was a bad idea right.

807
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Yes as it turns out.

808
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
But yes it's not as bad of an idea as well.

809
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So far it's.

810
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
It's weird.

811
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
It's we're not quite sure yet how bad it is.

812
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
This is why we do the time capsule.

813
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
That was fucking great.

814
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
All right.

815
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Now what.

816
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
But but what really comes to that remains to be seen because.

817
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Theoretic I think we knew the release date was going to be this year.

818
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
It was last year but now it's in 2020.

819
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So that's really funny.

820
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
All right.

821
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Moving on.

822
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I don't know who wrote this.

823
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I think this is dark soccer's handwriting with her safest prediction ever.

824
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Still no Half-Life 3.

825
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Well sort of.

826
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Well there's a new Half-Life game.

827
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
You thought it would be an easy prediction.

828
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Turns out it's a little complicated.

829
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Loki's handwriting.

830
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,000
EA will close BioWare after Anthem underperforms due to EA shittiness.

831
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
IE loot boxes.

832
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I would say you're like three fourths right.

833
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
There's just one component of this prediction missing.

834
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
So it should be in the capsule for next year.

835
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
We're going to put this back in.

836
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Yes there's things I'm going to put.

837
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Let's keep like a pile of things to put back in the capsule.

838
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Still no Half-Life 3.

839
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Where was the one about Animal Crossing.

840
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Because the one about Animal Crossing needs to go back in as well.

841
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Where is it.

842
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Online with Animal Crossing.

843
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Yeah something about online with Animal Crossing.

844
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I can't find it.

845
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Gosh darn it.

846
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Eh who cares.

847
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Wait wait wait wait wait.

848
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
No.

849
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Alright.

850
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Never mind.

851
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I'll worry about it later.

852
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Maybe it fell on the floor when I got up earlier.

853
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Okay.

854
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Next up.

855
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I don't think the year before are in here because we're almost out.

856
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Maybe that was the year before last.

857
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Loki wrote anticipated games.

858
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Crackdown 3.

859
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Yeah I anticipated it then I played it and then.

860
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
That was too bad.

861
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Animal Crossing Switch.

862
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I told you that's going to be everywhere.

863
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Borderlands 3.

864
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Yeah that was good.

865
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
It's like everybody's like last thing they wrote down was the accurate one.

866
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
So.

867
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Alright.

868
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Let's see.

869
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I think this is Jamie's writing.

870
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Nintendo freaks out and goes back to friend codes for all the things.

871
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I don't think they did.

872
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I'm trying to think if something's close.

873
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I don't know.

874
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I don't think so because they've actually kind of integrated Facebook and Twitter if

875
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
you pay for the online thing.

876
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
So don't think that one panned out.

877
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
There's only one more in here.

878
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
It must have been last year that I did that.

879
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Alright here it is.

880
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
The last one.

881
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Ooh.

882
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Did Sony do a PlayStation event in the fall because of no E3?

883
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
They did not.

884
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
No they didn't.

885
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
But that actually.

886
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Let's take that and lead this into a side topic because I don't think it comes up in

887
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
our news anywhere else.

888
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
But there's.

889
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
It's probably because it's the giant rumor category.

890
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
But this is one of those rumors that Michael Patcher has chimed in on.

891
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
And the rumor is that Sony plans to skip this year's E3 as well.

892
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Meaning that they would not be showing PlayStation 5 at E3 this year.

893
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
How do you guys feel about that if Sony were to skip E3 this year as well?

894
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
They'll do their own event.

895
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I mean that sucks for E3.

896
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
But you know they would do their own event.

897
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And I don't know if that's a good.

898
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
You know as much as like they may not have stuff to.

899
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I would hope that they'd have something to show because it's just going to be the Microsoft

900
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
show then if you know they decide that they're not going to go to E3.

901
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
It'll just be like.

902
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Well Nintendo could.

903
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Well right.

904
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
But like I mean that's.

905
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I don't know.

906
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I don't know what benefit they would have for skipping.

907
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Unless they really don't have stuff to show.

908
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Which is not good I guess.

909
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Especially considering that we're going to be.

910
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
You know expecting a new console at the end of this year and that's going to get delayed.

911
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Who knows.

912
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Boy that's a real kick in the pants to E3 and the ESA though.

913
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
But you know throughout the discussion on Twitter about the topic.

914
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
One thing that somebody I follow said that I remembered oh this is very true.

915
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Do you guys remember that the ESA had all those leaks of people's personal information

916
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
when it came to the media.

917
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Yeah.

918
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Do you remember that.

919
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
What did the ESA say they were going to do about that.

920
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I don't remember them saying anything that would be correct.

921
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
So there's still that whole thing is that this is still an issue that's gone unaddressed

922
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
and that's not good.

923
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
And maybe maybe this could sound really harsh and I don't mean to sound like one of those

924
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
like shitlords on Twitter.

925
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,000
But maybe the ESA deserves to fail.

926
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I put it out there.

927
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Can't take it back.

928
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Like maybe that they're just a lobbying group.

929
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
What are they really doing.

930
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Aside from they have the they're they're looking out for the publishers like the big triple

931
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
A publishers.

932
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
They're not looking out for the consumers at all.

933
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
They're just like protecting the people that are paying.

934
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
They're keeping them afloat.

935
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Is the publishers so.

936
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Yeah.

937
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I don't know.

938
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
In the past you know we may have seen them as like oh hey you know they're combat.

939
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
They're going against you know the laws that you're trying to ban violent video games and

940
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
stuff like that.

941
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
So that's kind of good.

942
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
But at the same time they were still just protecting the publishers.

943
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
They're not.

944
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:46,000
There's you know we need kind of a consumer advocate group that's kind of in the gaming

945
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
space I think.

946
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
And I don't think that's the ESA.

947
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
One of the other rumors out there is that they're trying to bring in Jeff Kealy to basically

948
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
save E3.

949
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
But I mean he's already kind of involved.

950
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
So that isn't necessarily like how is he going to save E3.

951
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
They are looking to him to basically design a show kind of like he does his award show

952
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
basically not saying that E3 is going to suddenly become an award show but basically give him

953
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
a lot more creative control him and his team I guess because you know only one man can

954
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
only do so much.

955
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
But you know get put more creative input from him basically.

956
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I don't know.

957
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I'm just not sure.

958
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I mean hey that's not the show that I mean that's not what that show is supposed to be

959
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
about.

960
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Yeah I know.

961
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I know.

962
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
But my how times have changed.

963
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
But you know the fact that the issues from last year still are going unaddressed and

964
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
so forth.

965
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I think E3 is if it does come out that Sony is not going to bother to go to the show and

966
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
they're doing their own thing.

967
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I mean sure.

968
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
There still will be an E3 2020 and Microsoft it's going to be free.

969
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Well it's not really going to be free but it's going to be you know Microsoft's you

970
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
know free realm to do things.

971
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,000
But if Sony does their own show if they do a PlayStation event they're going to get tons

972
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
of media coverage.

973
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
They can invite all the people they need to invite to their own show.

974
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I don't know it's going to be some colossal ego energy in a way but I kind of think it

975
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
would pay off for them.

976
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
So we'll see.

977
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I don't know.

978
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
That's what a lot of companies do in the tech space nowadays anyway so I wouldn't be surprised

979
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
if all of this E3 stuff goes away at some point.

980
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Bobby Black Wolf does want to point out kind of like a little difference here.

981
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Loki and what you were saying a minute ago is that the ESA they're a lobbying group for

982
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
the AAA publishers and put on a trade show.

983
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
That's all they do.

984
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,000
We have the ECA Entertainment Consumer Association which is the lobbying group for our behalf.

985
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
They owned game politics dot com.

986
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
So a little difference between the two side of things.

987
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Game politics?

988
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Didn't that go away?

989
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
No.

990
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Well he says owned in past tense.

991
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Oh yeah.

992
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
So I missed that site.

993
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I freaking loved game politics.

994
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
We need something like that back.

995
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Yeah.

996
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
So.

997
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
All right.

998
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Well let's move on.

999
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
We have a trip down memory lane in our time capsule.

1000
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Let's talk a little bit about our gaming.

1001
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Now I'm throwing the rest of these in the trash.

1002
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Are we going to do a new one of these?

1003
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Yes we will do a new one of these.

1004
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
We're running a little long tonight and I already kind of warned everybody before the

1005
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
show.

1006
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
So we'll probably fill this up.

1007
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
So what we'll do we're going to just come to the show next week with things already

1008
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
written out.

1009
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Week after next?

1010
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Or yes.

1011
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Oh yeah.

1012
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
So housekeeping note.

1013
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Hello.

1014
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
There is no show next week.

1015
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
No live show.

1016
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Well there's not going to be any show actually.

1017
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
He's not going to tape anything either.

1018
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
You will be out.

1019
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
He will be out.

1020
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Literally nobody will be here in Sacramento.

1021
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Well I'll be in Sacramento but nowhere near the studio.

1022
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Well and I will be at the women's march in San Francisco.

1023
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I will be in face.

1024
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
So if you want to look for Sister Hava which is me.

1025
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I will be out there with the San Francisco sisters.

1026
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Come say hi and march with us.

1027
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I'll be driving to Disneyland.

1028
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Broccoli farm.

1029
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I wanted to make those t-shirts.

1030
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Someday.

1031
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Next Sunday is Alan and I's third wedding anniversary on the 19th but we're actually

1032
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
also celebrating 10 years together.

1033
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
So we just passed 10 years as boyfriends or whatever you want to call it was January

1034
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
4th.

1035
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Dan and I do that.

1036
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Do you know that mine and Dan's 21st.

1037
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Wow.

1038
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Will be.

1039
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Is it 21st or 22nd?

1040
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I really can't brain but it will be the 23rd of this month.

1041
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Yeah.

1042
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Which means roughly half of my life has been lived in California.

1043
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Well we're very lucky to have you.

1044
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
So yeah.

1045
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Alan and I are going to see a play.

1046
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
So we're going to get our musical.

1047
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
We're going to see Dear Evan Hansen because it's touring.

1048
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
It's going to be here.

1049
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
So we're doing that that night.

1050
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Maybe a nice dinner or something.

1051
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
So yeah.

1052
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Just everybody's going to be gone.

1053
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Bobby Black Wolf will be holding down the fort here at Twitch.

1054
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
So for those of you I mean you guys can still tune in.

1055
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Bobby will probably maybe run a little longer than usual.

1056
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Maybe that'll be the week you can finally get Tommy on his show.

1057
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
And you can run really long.

1058
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
We'll see.

1059
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
But yeah.

1060
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
So VOG will still be on next week just we will not be here next week.

1061
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
So we'll be back in two weeks.

1062
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
And at that time we will fill the time capsule with new predictions.

1063
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
We can have it all written out already so we're not spending time writing.

1064
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Because that took forever the last time we did this.

1065
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I remember that.

1066
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
So.

1067
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
All right.

1068
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
So there you go.

1069
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
There's the time capsule.

1070
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Now it's time to throw these in the garbage.

1071
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
All right.

1072
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Let's move on to our gaming weeks and talk about the types of games that we have been

1073
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
playing this week.

1074
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Dark Soccer.

1075
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
How was your gaming week?

1076
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Well minimal given everything else we've been going through.

1077
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
But Dan and I did watch as much of AGDQ as we could.

1078
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I was a little sad they didn't make Pi Million.

1079
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Which was the last goal.

1080
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
But still it was great seeing everything that all of those amazing runners did.

1081
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I loved the Impossible Super Metroid run.

1082
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
That was amazing.

1083
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
What's the Impossible Super Metroid run?

1084
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
It's a mod of Super Metroid that's even harder with some of the things moved around.

1085
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
You don't get the Varia suit until after you beat Ridley.

1086
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
For example.

1087
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Mother Brain in each aspect of each of the different segments takes anywhere between

1088
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
100 to 150 shots.

1089
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
So it's pretty crazy.

1090
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:16,000
It was a really difficult run to watch but really amazing how tight this guy was in playing.

1091
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Oats and Goats was the runner.

1092
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Really amazing.

1093
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Do they have a Kaizo Super Metroid?

1094
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Because that would be hilarious.

1095
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
This is kind of I think Kaizo Super Metroid.

1096
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
It's really freaking hard.

1097
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:34,000
But as far as what I played I did a little bit more of What the Golf.

1098
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I freaking love it on iOS.

1099
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
It's so easy to play.

1100
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I mean and frustrating.

1101
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Because the cars.

1102
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
The cars pissed me off so much.

1103
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Yeah.

1104
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
And I have been playing Pokemon Go.

1105
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I've been playing Harry Potter.

1106
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I've also started playing the Rilakkuma farming game thanks to my friend Mari.

1107
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:00,000
It's basically just one of those stupid little farm sim games but with Rilakkuma instead.

1108
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
What else was I playing?

1109
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I'm also still playing Patterned.

1110
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
It's just so relaxing to me.

1111
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
It's one of the games that I'll have the music on when I'm playing it at home.

1112
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And I've got the Mac version and iOS version because I'm doing it through Apple Arcade.

1113
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
But thankfully my levels don't cross over for that game.

1114
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
So I can keep doing.

1115
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,000
And the levels play a little bit differently on a computer versus how they play on iPhone.

1116
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I've been vastly enjoying Patterned.

1117
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:37,000
It's been my little moment of zen while I've been so overwhelmed with all the crazytude in the house.

1118
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:44,000
And I've also been playing a lot of Animal Crossing Pocket Camp just because

1119
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Oh my god I want my Animal Crossing!

1120
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Dan and I talked about getting a Switch Lite for me so we don't have to take my Switch out of the house.

1121
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:58,000
So I can play and he's like, well I'm sure there's going to be an Animal Crossing edition of the Switch Lite and blah blah blah.

1122
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I'm like, you realize that this is the month.

1123
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
It's had me out the month before my birthday.

1124
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
And this is going to probably be my birthday present.

1125
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
So yes, all the things yes.

1126
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Other than that though, it's just really my usual.

1127
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I haven't had a thought to play anything else.

1128
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Because instead of playing our systems at home, we were watching AGDQ.

1129
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
The Super Metroid front was freaking amazing though.

1130
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Yeah, I saw a little bit of that. Just a little bit though.

1131
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
By the way.

1132
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Honk!

1133
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

1134
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
It was all Orna.

1135
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
That's basically it. I played Orna.

1136
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
What level are you now?

1137
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I'm 100.

1138
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Oh wow, look at you.

1139
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Yeah, so two weeks.

1140
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Took two while I get there.

1141
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
And now I have to figure out what specialization I'm going to pick now.

1142
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Because I have that option.

1143
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
But it costs too much.

1144
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
So yeah, now I assume it's going to be much slower.

1145
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Because now they've unlocked a whole new set of enemies I have to fight.

1146
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
That are way more powerful than I am now.

1147
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Whereas everything I was just trashing everything in my path up until 100.

1148
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
And you have to really walk to find stuff too.

1149
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Like that's what happens as you kill things.

1150
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Then they respawn with other mobs.

1151
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
They're usually more powerful than you.

1152
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
And so you really have to walk to get new stuff to spawn.

1153
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I've been kind of doing that stuff as well.

1154
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I've been trying to do the daily quest things that they have.

1155
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
But it can be hard sometimes.

1156
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Especially when it seems like the mobs that they want you to kill don't spawn as often on those days.

1157
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
So I've been trying to do that.

1158
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
And even just the basic stuff.

1159
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Like the main storyline quests that they have that you do.

1160
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Because it's like, okay, you need to kill hobgoblins.

1161
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Well cool, I've killed millions of hobgoblins.

1162
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Except they're hobgoblin mages, hobgoblin knights, hobgoblin this.

1163
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
And it's not just plain old hobgoblins.

1164
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
You have to specifically kill that.

1165
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:10,000
And so I'm level 100 and I'm still not even done with these tutorial missions or whatever.

1166
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I don't know, I've been doing a lot of the arena stuff.

1167
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Because arenas you get about 45,000 experience each thing you fight.

1168
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
And they're pretty easy.

1169
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
So I've been just doing those and burning through those as quickly as I can.

1170
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Yeah, so that's been my week basically.

1171
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I get murdered in those, my gear's not good enough or something.

1172
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
And I've been trying to use, that's why I finally built a blacksmith here.

1173
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
So I can just deposit.

1174
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
In fact I put stuff in before the show started tonight that'll be done by the time the show's over.

1175
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Yeah, I do that each night when I go to bed.

1176
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Drop stuff off and then pick up my dry cleaning in the morning.

1177
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Yeah, exactly.

1178
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Alright, lots of orna.

1179
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Let's see, my gaming week.

1180
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I've been playing a little bit of Pokemon Sword and Shield because of some of the news that came out this week.

1181
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
For the first time I finally, finally, finally got around to playing Untitled Goose Game.

1182
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I'm going to admit I didn't get into it as much as the rest of you have.

1183
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
And sorry if I come off like sounding like a hater, but I don't know.

1184
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Well I want to put something into context too because this is very important.

1185
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
It would help you understand maybe why I'm just like, I was very like kind of,

1186
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I don't get it as much as like everybody else.

1187
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Alan and I, after the show last week, we ate something that gave us the most horrific food poisoning

1188
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I have ever had in my entire life in the middle of the day on Monday.

1189
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:34,000
So we were sick Monday night, Tuesday, like it was so bad.

1190
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:40,000
I actually called my health provider to be like, do I need to come to the hospital because,

1191
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
or actually Alan had to call them because I couldn't form coherent sentences.

1192
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
It was that bad and he's sick.

1193
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
So it's, it was bad.

1194
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I'm fine now.

1195
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Obviously I'm sitting here doing the show and snacking away on pretzels here.

1196
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
So everything's fine.

1197
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
But that was the worst I have ever had it.

1198
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
That was so, so horrible.

1199
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:03,000
So I think I finally played Untitled Goose Game about Wednesday when my body is finally like starting to like,

1200
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,000
like stop being horrific and start to get some sense of normalcy again.

1201
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
But I just feel so like exhausted.

1202
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
But I was so bored.

1203
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I was like, I need something to do.

1204
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:19,000
So, uh, yeah, so I, that is the context in which I finally got around to playing Untitled Goose Game.

1205
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
So to be fair, I wasn't in the best of moods.

1206
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,000
So this is probably why the game didn't land super well with me, but I was just kind of like annoyed.

1207
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I was having such a hard time figuring out how to solve some of the very first puzzles,

1208
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
which I would assume are supposed to be some of the easiest stuff.

1209
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
So I was just, you know, getting annoyed with it really easy.

1210
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
So that was it.

1211
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I mean, I get, I get why though it is, it's a very different type of game.

1212
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
You know, you don't see that type of thing a lot.

1213
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Yeah, exactly.

1214
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
The goose does make a really funny mascot.

1215
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I just like playing an asshole.

1216
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Yeah, no, I get it. I get it.

1217
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
So there is a good boundary break on that one, by the way.

1218
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Oh, is there?

1219
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Yeah.

1220
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I'm just showing that like some of the scenes where you don't see the goose, it's still doing stuff.

1221
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:08,000
There's actually things going on in the houses and everything that, you know, it's not just effect happening.

1222
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
It's legit going on in the game.

1223
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I tried to, so when I was trying to figure out like what, where is this particular item that I need?

1224
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I found a river and I swam all the way down the river and I could see all these different areas that must be like coming up in the future.

1225
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,000
And finally it ended and I was able to go up onto something and that was like it,

1226
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
but it was weird that I could even get that far down the river.

1227
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
It was so strange.

1228
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
So, but yeah, that was, that was what it was.

1229
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
As far as like, oh, so the chat is wondering, Swanton wants to know what did I eat?

1230
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Here's the weird thing.

1231
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Food.

1232
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:50,000
We still kind of can't put together because Alan made spaghetti and meatballs here at home, which so obviously you blame the meatballs, right?

1233
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,000
But they were those type of like prepackaged frozen ones that are pre-cooked and then he cooked them again.

1234
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
So I know it doesn't, it doesn't make a lot of sense.

1235
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:05,000
And the doctor, so I finally did talk to a doctor in urgent care because the way you and I have the same health care providers.

1236
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
So the way they work, cause I was like, can I come into urgent care?

1237
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Can I come into urgent care?

1238
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
And I'm like, we need to call you.

1239
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I usually go to, they don't, they do not advertise very well where the urgent care is.

1240
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I know right where mine is.

1241
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Okay.

1242
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I'm going to get the details of that.

1243
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Haven't forbid that ever happens to me again.

1244
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Well, just FYI South SAC urgent care opens at three o'clock.

1245
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
That's good.

1246
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
And it's open every day.

1247
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Okay.

1248
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
That's good to know.

1249
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
But anyway, um, so I, uh, where was I?

1250
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Oh, I talked to the doctor and the doctor was like, you know,

1251
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:41,000
it sounds like it might actually be viral because I don't think what you guys ate sounds like it's something that could have been capable of giving you such, you know, horrible food poisoning.

1252
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Um, so it's still, it's kind of a mystery in some ways.

1253
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Um, now we had gone to a nice brunch at a nice country club place earlier in the day with some mutual friends.

1254
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:00,000
And so we were kind of quick to think, Oh, those types of things, buffets are usually like prime.

1255
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
That's where it came from.

1256
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,000
But this was a really nice place and not the type of thing that's going to have code violations.

1257
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I mean, everybody makes mistakes, but none of our friends got sick.

1258
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Your reaction though, and I was thinking this earlier, just, you know, I was too kind of in stuff is definitely though, makes me think more of gastroenteritis than, um, than food poisoning because of how dehydrated you got.

1259
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Oh my gosh.

1260
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I got so dehydrated.

1261
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
That's why my fever was so high.

1262
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,000
And what I had it really bad and I had, this was when I was a kid, but I had it for about two weeks.

1263
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I lost 20 pounds as a teenager, which is a lot when you're a teenager and was roughly in the same state that you described yourself.

1264
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,000
So I'm glad you're over it by now, but it does sound like you had maybe a 48 hour bug.

1265
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
So weird.

1266
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
So weird.

1267
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:56,000
But anyway, one thing I will say, I'm going to say this, and I know this isn't directly about games, but this is just a good life tip because this is something I learned throughout the whole ordeal.

1268
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Cause the problem was Alan and I were sick at the same time.

1269
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
So we couldn't really like help each other out a lot.

1270
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Now he, he didn't get it as bad as I did.

1271
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Um, I also eight seconds on Sunday, so I kind of blame that on everything.

1272
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:17,000
But anyway, my point is, you know, when you're super dehydrated, the best thing to do is to drink something like Gatorade, something with electrolytes, right?

1273
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Something to kind of get all that back in your system.

1274
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Well, we don't just keep Gatorade around the house.

1275
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
So I would really advise people to do one of two things.

1276
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Have Gatorade available, put it in your pantry, like just have it in a place that that's, that shit never goes bad.

1277
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Mio, keep the squirty stuff.

1278
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Or that, or this is what I was gonna say, cause this really did the trick.

1279
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:42,000
They sell a, you know how like, um, not crystal light, but crystal light comes in those powder things.

1280
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
They sell Propel in little powdered packets.

1281
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Pedial light also.

1282
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Oh, does Pedial light come in packets?

1283
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:56,000
They have Pedial, not the powder one. It's kind of a gross like liquid thing, but it does, it's a great rehydrator.

1284
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Trust me.

1285
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Pedial light is the bomb.

1286
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
It can't be as gross as being sick.

1287
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
So my advice to everybody, have an emergency supply of something.

1288
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Pick the brand of your choice with electrolytes.

1289
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Have an emergency supply of it on hand, just in case.

1290
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:16,000
That's especially if you live alone, especially, you know, even if you do live with a partner or something.

1291
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
There's no telling if both of you are gonna get sick at the same time.

1292
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
So anyway.

1293
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Wow, I totally got on a tangent with that.

1294
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Oh, DJ Rama S in chat says Pedial light, a must have when you're out con drinking.

1295
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I'm pretty sure Dragon Con, most people I've seen have a stock of it on hand as well.

1296
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
So it's smart to have.

1297
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
But I think even the powdered stuff, cause that's so much, you know, water's heavy.

1298
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
You can't always carry that around, but like, I'm gonna do that now.

1299
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,000
When I go to Dragon Con, I'm gonna take that tiny little box of powder Propel and just keep it with me.

1300
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Like how it's, it's super easy and convenient.

1301
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
So anyway, I keep a little bottle of meal when I travel.

1302
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Yeah, I guess I didn't even think of meal, but I guess that would work too for sure.

1303
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
So perfect.

1304
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Anyway.

1305
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
So where were we?

1306
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Yes.

1307
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Not just cause I need a sassy gay friend.

1308
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Gaming weeks.

1309
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Hello.

1310
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:08,000
So don't play a fun game like untitled goose game when you don't feel fun because it'll affect your opinions on it.

1311
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
But otherwise I played it way too much Final Fantasy 14.

1312
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
What else is new?

1313
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
So let's move on.

1314
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Let's get into some gaming news finally.

1315
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Let's talk about what's been going on in the headlines.

1316
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
And, uh, yeah, it's nice to, it's nice to be back to normal in the news cycle.

1317
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Cause the past couple of weeks have been all holidays, holidays, but here we are 2020.

1318
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Here we go.

1319
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Looking at the new consoles and what they're going to bring and all that good stuff, right Loki?

1320
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:39,000
2020 party in like it's 2006 though, with Microsoft, a rumor at least about Microsoft's new console, the Xbox Series X.

1321
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Stating that there may be a windows mode in the console where you can actually run it like a PC, which allow you to access the steam and Epic game store platforms.

1322
01:06:49,000 --> 01:07:05,000
So you could essentially use this like a PC in the sense that you could use the PlayStation three as a Linux machine for a brief moment in time until they decided that was an avenue for people to hack the system.

1323
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
And then, you know, we know how that went.

1324
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Um, interesting to see if this ends up being a thing, but who knows?

1325
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,000
I mean, it sounds plausible, I guess.

1326
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:27,000
I would be surprised though, like if that is actually a thing, because I think that one of the things they were trying to do with like, especially the windows store is have a lot of these universal apps.

1327
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
So you'd be able to do some productivity stuff on there.

1328
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:36,000
And I would be willing to bet that like, if it's a windows mode, like, I don't know.

1329
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
I just can't imagine Microsoft outlook on my Xbox.

1330
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:45,000
I just can't imagine like someone buying an Xbox Series X to do like Excel on that.

1331
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:51,000
This just who would have thought the military would have bought PlayStation threes to do some of their most intentional.

1332
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Right. But that's because of the processor that's inside of it.

1333
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,000
I mean, I true it's like, God, I need a strong processor for that Excel spreadsheet.

1334
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,000
You know, um, I mean, I guess I could see something like that.

1335
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Maybe they could do that.

1336
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I just don't know. I'd be a little skeptical to see if it can run the epic game store and that kind of stuff.

1337
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
But who knows? Maybe someone will hack it to do that.

1338
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
But I guess we'll have to wait and see.

1339
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:29,000
It would be very perceptive of Phil Spencer and the rest of the Xbox team if they've kind of noticed that, you know, when PlayStation three got rid of the other OS thing, it was not super well received by a lot of people.

1340
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:36,000
And, you know, maybe when you hear that, oh, the military was buying these machines to use and so forth for their, you know, specific needs.

1341
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,000
It would be very interesting if they've put a Windows mode into this.

1342
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
And obviously I don't see them doing any OS like Unix or whatever.

1343
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I mean, I guess anything's possible, but I just don't see it.

1344
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:54,000
But it'd be very interesting if there is a Windows boot mode for these things that you could run, you know, whether it's limited to universal Windows apps or things like that.

1345
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
It would be very interesting if if that was something that these boxes offered.

1346
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:13,000
But I could I could see that be a more interesting prospect for things you can do with your Xbox other than the Xbox one's message of TV, TV sport or like to the sense that this Windows mode in there.

1347
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Like I know that, you know, the Xbox is now looking at this whole Xbox cloud platform and streaming.

1348
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I know with the Xbox one X, I think a lot of that streaming, you're actually streaming games from your console to your phone.

1349
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
So what if they see that as, hey, you know what?

1350
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Productivity wise, we could have you stream your console to your phone.

1351
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:39,000
But instead of playing games on there, you could be answering emails.

1352
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:45,000
You could be putting together a spreadsheet, typing up a word document or something like that.

1353
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,000
So you could do some of that as well and then go to gaming.

1354
01:09:49,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Maybe that's something that they're thinking about doing to kind of help boost that platform, because I think maybe making some money from these live was at the.

1355
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:06,000
The Office 365 subscriptions or something like that might be something that they're interested in as well.

1356
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
We'll see in chat.

1357
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Bobby Black Wolf says, to be fair, the Xbox one can use just about any UWP app, which I think is universal Windows platform, right?

1358
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Yeah.

1359
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
There are Reddit apps on the Xbox one.

1360
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
I don't even think of that.

1361
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,000
I mean, technically you can run Microsoft Edge on your Xbox one.

1362
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I don't know why you would, because none of the websites look like anyone would use edge for any reason.

1363
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
But it's there.

1364
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Bobby also points out, I could release a VOG app for Xbox one if I really wanted to.

1365
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Well, now you've nominated yourself.

1366
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Well, I mean, but you have to.

1367
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
This stream runs through Twitch.

1368
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I mean, it would have been different if this was still a shout cast thing and shout cast being a more open platform.

1369
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
You know, it would have been a lot different.

1370
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Basically, he would be writing a very specific version of TuneIn.

1371
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Right.

1372
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,000
But now that we're not there or on Twitch, I don't really know if that same logic would apply.

1373
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,000
It's just kind of like we just tell people, well, just make sure you follow us and use the Twitch app, you know?

1374
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Yeah.

1375
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
So I think there's that.

1376
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:13,000
But but, you know, but I mean, to be fair, a dedicated app could still be used for podcasts, catching up on back episodes and things like that.

1377
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
We could feed it exclusive content.

1378
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I don't know what the fuck we'd put on it that we're not doing already on these shows.

1379
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:25,000
But, you know, I guess we could do what all the other podcasters do and do special mini episodes that are just.

1380
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:30,000
But I'm like, dudes, we do a three and I use that as a universal term.

1381
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Dudes, we do a three hour podcast every week, like all the random shit we would do in a sideshow is already in this show.

1382
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
This show is bloated as fuck.

1383
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
What else do you want?

1384
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
You can't do more random stuff.

1385
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
This show is already random.

1386
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
The special show.

1387
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Oh my God, that's going to be my new line.

1388
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
We're like the Keith Richards of topics.

1389
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Next time.

1390
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Next time.

1391
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
He's done all the drugs.

1392
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
All the topics.

1393
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Next time I'm on a fucking podcast panel and they're like, or they say like, your show should be an hour.

1394
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
You should be an hour and 20 minutes.

1395
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
And they're like, why is your show three hours long?

1396
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I'm going to be like, because all that shit y'all put on Patreon and charge people for, we just put it on our main show.

1397
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Now what?

1398
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Now what?

1399
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
And then I'll get escorted off the stage, but I'll have made my point.

1400
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Hey, we've done three hour shows for ages and guess what?

1401
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Bitches, we're still here.

1402
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
That's true.

1403
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
We are.

1404
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Who's got the longevity?

1405
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
That would be us.

1406
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Yeah.

1407
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,000
The thing is the rest of you care about ratings.

1408
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:40,000
We were doing this show and no one was listening and we're still doing this show and no one's listening.

1409
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
We have a few people.

1410
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
We have a few people.

1411
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
We sure do.

1412
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
All right.

1413
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
All right.

1414
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Anyway, Bobby Black, Wolf and Chat says, I will give you a standing ovation.

1415
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Thank you, Bobby.

1416
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
This is why we were-

1417
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I remember someone legit gave me a dollar.

1418
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
This is why we worked together so well.

1419
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I do remember someone gave you a dollar.

1420
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I know who it is too.

1421
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
All right.

1422
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Anyway, where were we?

1423
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Oh yes, the Xbox Series X.

1424
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Yes.

1425
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:13,000
How about, okay, so we actually, funny enough, we tangented into other OS and all this stuff, but let's go back to the point of the Steam store and the Epic store.

1426
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Now, see, I could also see this as Microsoft trying to play off any concerns of a monopoly because there might be concerns of anti-competitiveness.

1427
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,000
So if there was a way that you could access these stores-

1428
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:39,000
But I wouldn't see that this would be a problem though, because I mean, we exist in a world that Apple has one platform for selling products within their device, their devices that they have.

1429
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
So I don't know.

1430
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I don't think that would be necessarily a problem on a console.

1431
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
It's not like a PC where we're locking you down.

1432
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
You can only buy stuff from this.

1433
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Well, what's interesting, Apple's kind of been called out on that in the past.

1434
01:13:53,000 --> 01:14:01,000
And I have a feeling, I don't know any of this, but I have a feeling this could be why they went back and they split up iTunes the way they did.

1435
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Now they have the music app and the podcast app because technically, yes, you can use Apple podcast app to listen to this, but you can use Spotify.

1436
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
You can use iHeartRadio.

1437
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
You can use other podcast apps.

1438
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Yes, you can use the music app to pay for and get music, but you can use Pandora.

1439
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:35,000
So I have a feeling exactly what you're talking about right there might be why Apple had split some of that up previously so that that chatter would hopefully dissipate a little bit because they can say there is competition in these other places.

1440
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:40,000
We do have other places you could buy TV shows and Amazon and stuff on our platform in addition to our own.

1441
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:45,000
It'll be interesting to see what they do with it, if it even exists.

1442
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:51,000
I'm, you know, I'm not knocking any more functionality for a device, so why not?

1443
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Fair enough.

1444
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:58,000
All right, well, let's move on and talk about the Consumer Electronics Show, which happened this past weekend.

1445
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Not usually a gigantic gaming event.

1446
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,000
We got little bits of well, there's still exciting stuff.

1447
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Yeah, there is. And especially if you're a collector, I think all the big news that I saw was really about we have some other little headlines later, but I think a lot of the big headlines I saw was about collectibles.

1448
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:18,000
So including one of the biggest collectible makers right now is Arcade One Up, who makes those.

1449
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
They're just on a roll, man.

1450
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:24,000
They are on a roll. They are. Yeah, they are Ashley O on a roll, that's for sure.

1451
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Arcade One Up is doing an online enabled NBA Jam cabinet.

1452
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:35,000
So this is going to be their first one that actually you can play against your friend's NBA Jam cabinet in another state thanks to the magical Wi-Fi.

1453
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
That's pretty cool.

1454
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Even when you think like this is like really basic, like low level Xbox Live type of implementation.

1455
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:50,000
But it's still kind of neat to see that in an authentic cabinet, authentic collector thing.

1456
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,000
I think that's a really exciting type of thing, actually. That's cool.

1457
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
There's also yes, I am well aware and this is near and dear to my heart.

1458
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:03,000
And you can actually see this is it's probably hard to make out on the Twitch feed for those that are watching the video.

1459
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,000
But I actually have my little this is a Burger Time arcade machine.

1460
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:12,000
This is in the My Arcade series, which we'll talk about them as well, because they have news as well coming out.

1461
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
But there's that little machine.

1462
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:19,000
We see we can actually kind of hit the start so you can actually run through the game, although that is not going to come through.

1463
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
You can hear it, though, a little bit.

1464
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
But yeah, so it actually you play a game.

1465
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
So they're actually putting out a full size Burger Time cabinet.

1466
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Arcade one up is. So I think that's kind of cool for sure.

1467
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Can you imagine like telling someone the 80s? Hey, yeah, you know what?

1468
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Remember, remember how they had those Coleco arcade little things that you could buy that were kind of like cheap, cheap.

1469
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I mean, at the time it was the best they could do, but it was like cheap, like the LED bird.

1470
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Yeah, cheap, cheap interpretations of the games like, no, you're actually going to get the full arcade hardware running on one of these.

1471
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I mean, someone just blow their goddamn minds. Yeah, I think it's one of the people have emulated those now.

1472
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I really want the Burger Time cab, but I just the the cost is a little bit up there and I just I can't justify the cost right now.

1473
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:11,000
They charge it for it. Three ninety nine, three ninety nine. But then you have to consider there's tax and you have to consider their shipping, which they can bring to stores.

1474
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:16,000
No, they're only it's limited edition. They're only doing three thousand prints and it's only through their stores.

1475
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,000
You can't even do it through Amazon to get like price or something. Yeah, I know it stinks.

1476
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
So so it's really more like five hundred dollars if you want to buy this cabinet. So I don't know.

1477
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
I'm still kind of on the fence, but I'm worried it'll be sold out by the time I'm finally ready to commit.

1478
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:33,000
So we'll see. I'll probably decide in the next few days. Of course, all this news came out again while I was heeled over.

1479
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:44,000
In pain. Other things that arcade went up announced a pinball partnership with Zen Studios to include titles from Bali Williams and other big, big names in the pinball space.

1480
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:50,000
That's pretty exciting. So now we're going to have arcade one up pinball tables. So I'm assuming those will be kind of miniature sized as well.

1481
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:56,000
It's a three quarter scale. Yeah. And I'm just going to use it probably just be the screen tilted a little bit.

1482
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,000
So probably be kind of like the cabinets are today, but with the screen tilted. That's my guess. I don't know.

1483
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:07,000
I haven't I haven't seen these machines myself yet, so be interesting. They're also talking about a sit down style Star Wars cabinet.

1484
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:13,000
So that's kind of cool, except don't I'm hearing Bobby talked about this a little bit on his show.

1485
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:19,000
I guess he saw some videos and stuff. It's kind of like it's like a bench with the screen there. It's not like the full enclosed casing.

1486
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Oh, man. We can build that yourself if you really want. But you know, I want since we're talking about like, you know, dream stuff.

1487
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Sure. I want arcade one up to start doing like the racing games, like Rush, like California Speed. Anything's possible.

1488
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:46,000
I want a driving cabinet. Can I get an arcade one up driving cabinet, please? I guess sit down driving cabinet. Not necessarily full size.

1489
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I'll take a three quarter scale or whatever. They're also doing a new Frogger cabinet, which will have time. No one wants that.

1490
01:18:54,000 --> 01:19:00,000
I love time pilot, though. I would only want Frogger if I can play the roller skates.

1491
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:11,000
I'm trying to make Frogger happen, Konami. And then there's going to be a Sega Golden Axe cabinet with Golden Axe, Shinobi, Altered Beast, Wrestle Wars.

1492
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:18,000
But for the first time, Golden Axe, the Revenge of Death Adder. I guess it's not been released like this before. So that's pretty darn cool.

1493
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:25,000
So, yeah, they unveiled all sorts of stuff. That's all from arcade one up. Now, there's other companies getting in this business, too.

1494
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:37,000
There's one called II Arcade with two small eyes and arcade. This is a cabinet that you can put in the little reduced size like the arcade one ups a little bit.

1495
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:45,000
And apparently what this is, is that you hook this up and then you download whatever games you want legally.

1496
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:54,000
So this is basically trying to bring a purchase model smart into it. Yeah, it is a little like it's like, do I really want to pay one hundred fifty dollars?

1497
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:01,000
I mean, if you want to have like that collection, like an arcade collection, I get it. Yeah. I mean, I have the room and the money.

1498
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Sure. Why not? I'll fill my house with that stuff. But like, if you don't have the room or the money, this I think is a pretty decent option.

1499
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Yeah. So it's going to run on a special arcade OS, a customized operating system. And you'll be able to basically buy games that they are working with to be able to install on this as well.

1500
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:29,000
And I think they're talking about making different types, different shapes. So maybe like a cocktail cabinet and stuff like that. Cool. Who knows? I think that'd be very cool.

1501
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:43,000
And then I had one more bit about these actual little my arcade cabinets, the small ones that I've got here. They are going to be doing a Street Fighter two championship edition player as well.

1502
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I think that's pretty cool. That's going to be hard to play. Well, apparently it's something that is actually going to be multiplayer as well.

1503
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,000
I thought I heard that was the thing so that you could actually. Yeah, you can connect it.

1504
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:00,000
So these things actually have little hookups in the back and you can connect two machines together and play against each other. Yeah, that's cool.

1505
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:10,000
That's pretty cool, huh? So, yeah, that's that's one thing that will be available. And then there is a super retro champ console, which is, I guess, I saw that.

1506
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:24,000
So that's kind of cool looking. Yeah. So that's basically it's this new like portable retro system that can use either SNES or Genesis cartridges or Mega Drive cartridges.

1507
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:32,000
So they have like a cartridge slot in the top and a cartridge slot in the bottom. And then there's a screen and it kind of has your usual like, you know, four button setup or whatever.

1508
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:39,000
That looked pretty cool. And I guess other things they had recently announced, I didn't even know were out there. There's a Space Invaders player. There's a Contra player as well.

1509
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:48,000
I didn't even know there was a Contra Contra. Yeah, I'd be down for Contra. And I believe this is the company that has the Bubble Bobble ones right now, too.

1510
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:56,000
I'm trying to actually look at their catalog to see what they have. Contra out because I need to get the Contra cabinet.

1511
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:03,000
I'm looking on their website right now so you can actually look at my arcade gaming dot com. Yeah, there's Bubble Bobble and there's Rolling Thunder, too, which I thought was pretty cool.

1512
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:10,000
And Elevator Actions. There's like all these games. They have a Mappy one. When did that come? Oh, wait. No. Hello. I have the Mappy one.

1513
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Shows you how much my brain. Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I think I have that one.

1514
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:20,000
I was going to say there's Heavy Barrel, Caveman Ninja, Bad Dudes. Yes, there's just there's so many of them.

1515
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:26,000
The other set that's out, apparently there's a Spy Hunter that Dan wants me to go hunting down. Geez.

1516
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:36,000
So these things are just blowing up. These little mini retro, you know, whether it be teeny tiny $30 or $40 ones or these, you know, larger $400 ones.

1517
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Like, you know, collecting these is really big right now. And this trend is going to be continuing if this year's CES is any indication. So stay tuned.

1518
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,000
All right. Meanwhile, moving on to another story, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

1519
01:22:50,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Well, I'm sorry, I was actually looking at the game now. So Microsoft has implemented something called Project Artemis.

1520
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:13,000
What it is, it's a tool for their chat that scans all of the text conversations and rates them on the probability that a user might be trying to sexually exploit children.

1521
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:23,000
It is also then reviewed by human moderators to review the flight conversations and see if they are something that needs to be reported to law enforcement.

1522
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:40,000
So they are apparently to be implementing this on Xbox. And it looks like they're also going to be offering it up to nonprofits and other gaming and messaging service developers to help prevent the exploitation of children.

1523
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:50,000
And this is, of course, coming right on the heels of COPPA, which that in itself is problematic. But we'll see what becomes of it.

1524
01:23:50,000 --> 01:24:04,000
If only they had something so good for people who harass women on the Internet, wickedly glaring at every video game chat that exists in the universe.

1525
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:14,000
You know, or all these little toxic small penis males out there who want women to not have a voice.

1526
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:20,000
So do you think we're going to maybe in 2020 see our first arrest from use of this technology?

1527
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
I hope so. Yeah, I'd love to see it. I'd love to see all these predators.

1528
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I wouldn't love to see this action ever happen, but I understand it's out there.

1529
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:33,000
You know what I mean? I'd like to see the predators caught and dealt with.

1530
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:39,000
I would love to see the predators caught and dealt with. Could this technology capture on swatters?

1531
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:45,000
I guess maybe not, maybe, but it's maybe something police can install or so. I don't know. They'd be nice, though, if they could do that, too.

1532
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Yeah. You know, just like even if people joke about it, they need to be flagged because it's not funny.

1533
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:58,000
It's not funny at all. Do you think people are going to have a problem, though? I mean, it's more and more we start to get more and more aware of like all these devices that listen in on us, right?

1534
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Like there's all this talk. Privacy isn't a thing anymore. There's no privacy? No, there's really no privacy anymore.

1535
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Not if you don't want something of yours that has been in or on the Internet to be public.

1536
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,000
You do not put it on the Internet at all. You write it down.

1537
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:25,000
That's why I keep a journal, a physical written damn journal now so that I don't have to worry about my dirty laundry being aired.

1538
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:31,000
You know, I don't put anything unless I break in your home and steal your journal. But she says that's at my house.

1539
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Fair enough. I keep the thing with me. So but at any rate and, you know, I'm just being teasing anyway.

1540
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:51,000
That's fine. But but at any rate, you know, I think if this is a this is a suitable reaction to a problem that's happening.

1541
01:25:51,000 --> 01:26:05,000
It's it's it was predictable that something like this would happen. And so, again, I think that if you're that kind of filthy creature that wants to prey on children for whatever.

1542
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Pleasure you want to get from exploited children, then you best be considering, number one, your life choices.

1543
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Number two, getting psychological help. And number three, keeping that garbage off of the Internet.

1544
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:27,000
You know, it's Dan and I were just talking about this the other day, too.

1545
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,000
We're talking about the subway guy and how garbage he was.

1546
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:36,000
And just talking about how these people and we're learning about them now because nothing is private on the Internet.

1547
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:44,000
But when you go to play a game on Xbox Live, essentially you're saying you're going on the Internet and the things that you're saying, the things that you're doing, their public record.

1548
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Yeah. You're doing them on the Internet and you're doing them online by participating in this chat. You have consented to be scrutinized.

1549
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:57,000
End of story. Yeah. And honestly, I want these predators to be they're out there.

1550
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:05,000
We know they are. I want them caught and removed. I want these people who are out there harassing other people to be caught and removed.

1551
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:13,000
I want them to see that their behavior is unacceptable. And yes, you will be held accountable for it. End of story.

1552
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:19,000
So interesting that technology is taking us steps closer to that. So I'm glad for it.

1553
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I mean, nothing is private anymore. Just remember, everybody, nothing is private.

1554
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:32,000
If you don't want some if you are going to put something out there that you feel might remotely be regrettable, don't fucking do it.

1555
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:37,000
End of story. Better delete my Twitter account. All right.

1556
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Moving on. Loki, what do we have next? So more updates to Pokemon Go.

1557
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:48,000
So Gen five, they're going to be having some more Pokemon added to the roster for Pokemon Go.

1558
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:54,000
And what's going to be a little bit unique about this is that some of these you'll be able to get by evolving.

1559
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Well, your Pokemon will evolve when you do trades, because I think they're trying to really get people to use the trade function on there.

1560
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:16,000
So right now they have certain Pokemon like Kadabra, Machoke, Graveler and Haunter that you need to.

1561
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:22,000
They're going to have no candy evolutions. I guess that will be something that's going to be available now.

1562
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Along with that, they're going to be adding some more Pokemon.

1563
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:36,000
So Bulldor, Girder, Garblast and Shelmet are going to be added as well to this trade evolution.

1564
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Then they're going to be adding some more Pokemon that are going to be for the fifth generation that you build a hatch from eggs.

1565
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:54,000
So that includes Roggenrola, Tympole, Dwebler, Trubbish, Karablast, Joltik, Shelmet and then some additional ones.

1566
01:28:54,000 --> 01:29:01,000
And then they talk about some of the more region exclusive stuff as well.

1567
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:06,000
So North America, South America and Africa are going to be getting Thoreau.

1568
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
And those are going to be from 10 kilometer eggs.

1569
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:15,000
I'm so bored of regional exclusives though. It sucks so much for people that aren't able to like just easily travel and all that.

1570
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:20,000
You know, it's just, I don't know. I wish there was, I mean, I guess alternative ways come out eventually.

1571
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Some of these regions don't make any sense either. So like, okay, so like I said, North America, South America and Africa.

1572
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Okay, those are continents. Then we have Southern United States, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and South America get Maractus.

1573
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:43,000
I mean, that's kind of weird that there's that overlap there.

1574
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Europe, Asia and Australia are getting Sauk.

1575
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Egypt and Greece are getting Sigilyph.

1576
01:29:52,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Eastern Hemisphere red striped form Basculin and Western Hemisphere blue striped form Basculin.

1577
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Hmm. That's hard to keep track of.

1578
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Yeah, you're going to need one of those guides that shows you all the different regionals and what's in, what's in each region and all that.

1579
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I'll catch what I catch and I'll be happy with that. That's fine.

1580
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:21,000
That's right. That's right. Let's see. I'm actually kind of looking through my own collection because I find that these new ones they released, they're out there, but they're all kind of harder to find.

1581
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:29,000
I have three Roggenrolas. So I guess that's the easiest one. I play a lot with my Bluetooth too. So I don't always see what I'm catching.

1582
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:36,000
I know I raided this timber. I saw that timber and I raided that. I have a Venipede and a Basculin.

1583
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
I have a few Venipedes.

1584
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Yeah. So, so you're getting, you're seeing those Venipedes. Yeah. But I don't, I mean, that's all of the like new stuff I've caught. So I need to

1585
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
I also got a shiny Seviper.

1586
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
I need to hatch more stuff. So.

1587
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:55,000
All right. All right. So there's what's going on in Pokemon Go. Let's talk about what's going on in mainline Pokemon Go.

1588
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Or excuse me, mainline Pokemon Go. Mainline Pokemon.

1589
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,000
All the Pokemanses. Pokemon Go play it on the Switch.

1590
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Yeah. Pokemon Go and play it on the Switch because there was a big Pokemon Direct that happened this week.

1591
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:12,000
And they did, they did a little bit of like, yes, home still coming. And you know, little bits of that.

1592
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:19,000
They also talked about a Pokemon mystery dungeon game that had a demo that came out. I did play that a little bit actually.

1593
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
That was cute.

1594
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Is that a new game or is it just a remake?

1595
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:28,000
It's a remaster or redo or whatever of like, I think it was on Game Boy Advance because it was around the time of gen.

1596
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
I think the first three gens are in it. So it's.

1597
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,000
They had a few mystery dungeons that were on DS as well.

1598
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,000
They did. They did. I think that represent later generations. But what I played was cute. So, yeah.

1599
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:46,000
And then they announced some this and this is a surprise. Nobody was expecting this.

1600
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:54,000
But Pokemon Sword and Shield will be getting expansions that will be adding 200 more Pokemon to the games.

1601
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,000
And these are Pokemon from the past. So these are Pokemon.

1602
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
I kind of figured that they would be doing this.

1603
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
And some folks kind of thought, oh, that's what they're doing for DLC.

1604
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:12,000
And, you know, some folks are accusing Pokemon Company and Nintendo of being, you know, greedy by doing it this way and, you know, so forth.

1605
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:22,000
I kind of prefer it to what's been historically there, because if you think about it and they they said in very plain terms, this is taking the place of a third game.

1606
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:26,000
So there's not going to be a Pokemon gun or a Pokemon armor.

1607
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Instead, there's going to be the Isle of Armor, but then DLC with one of the Pokemon getting a gun.

1608
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,000
And that's yeah, I was gonna say that's too bad because there is a Pokemon with a gun now.

1609
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:41,000
And that is we're referring to a new GMax form for Inteleon.

1610
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:45,000
So, yeah, but but anyway, I'm sure you guys have seen all the memes at this point.

1611
01:32:45,000 --> 01:33:04,000
They're doing the DLC. But but my point with this is, is that, you know, if you really sit down and think about it, you know, and what blows me away how people are still complaining about this is that this is what folks were saying they wanted was like, oh, well, just do a Pokemon gun that has all of the old Pokemon in it.

1612
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Well, guess what? You would be paying $60 for that.

1613
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,000
And usually when they do something like that, they cut Pokemon.

1614
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:16,000
It's not all just all new. It's not a best of the first. It doesn't eliminate the first two games.

1615
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,000
It has some from column A, some from column B and not everything.

1616
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:28,000
This way, you're not having to buy a whole new game and play what is essentially the same plot over again, right?

1617
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Because Pokemon yellow was just fucking Pokemon red. But with Pikachu following you, that's all it was.

1618
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:40,000
It wasn't that different. Like maybe minor differences. You want to get a piggy with me, but otherwise not that different.

1619
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:48,000
But this method, it's going to be cheaper overall. Yes, $30 is expensive for DLC, but that's $30 for both parts.

1620
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,000
So a new if they had done a Pokemon gun or whatever, it would've been a $60 game.

1621
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
So this is actually going to be cheaper than that.

1622
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
You have to buy it twice if you have two different games.

1623
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:01,000
You do have to buy it twice if you have two different games. Oh, I don't know about that.

1624
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Pokemon experts, do I have to buy it twice if I own both sword and shield? The answer is you might. For that.

1625
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:15,000
That's lame. But see, just fucking trade for the missing ones.

1626
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:22,000
I understand Pokemon completionists are going to need to buy it twice for that, but they also chose to be Pokemon completionists.

1627
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,000
I know Shane does. Shane does not give a fuck about this whole, or like, like in a good way.

1628
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:32,000
He's like, I'm all about this DLC. This is the way to do it. I'm pumped and all that.

1629
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,000
He will, he will not give a fuck about paying twice if he has to. I know that already.

1630
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:49,000
So, um, uh, yeah, I, I don't think people that already invested in buying the same game twice are going to worry about buying the same DLC twice because you already bought the same game twice.

1631
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:54,000
I guess. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, let me see. I'm actually trying to look at chat here. Okay.

1632
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Uh, Shane says, um, yes, you have to buy a shield one and a sword one.

1633
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Um, Shane is also saying, how is it greedy when you don't need to buy the expansion to trade or transfer in the returning Pokemon?

1634
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:16,000
People just want to complain. Sometimes I feel like, um, and act def follows that up with people are still so goddamn salty about national decks, but I just rather not pay attention to the haters anymore.

1635
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:24,000
And you're right. It's not that some, somebody chose to just gloss over that part of the direct where they explicitly showed.

1636
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:29,000
If you don't want to buy the DLC, you can still trade for the Pokemon that are in the DLC.

1637
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:37,000
They're not going to show up in your old game in the wild area or anything like that. I don't want they might, I don't know, maybe one or two, but that's not in the plan, but you could trade for him.

1638
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:44,000
So if you really want a fucking Bulbasaur or whatever, I don't, and I don't know if Bulbasaur is in the expansion. I'm just assuming trade for it.

1639
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Just like, and that's that my friends is how it used to be done anyway, because then people are salty about, oh, I got to trade or know these people do that stuff.

1640
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:59,000
What the fuck do you think it was on the Game Boy Advance with that fucking cable?

1641
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Because the people complaining about it aren't old and salty like me. They don't remember those days. That's how you used to have to do it.

1642
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,000
So there is seriously no satisfying some people.

1643
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:22,000
It wasn't this trading over the internet bullshit. It was, you had to be in the same room and tethered to each other.

1644
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Yeah. Anyway, uh, Shane also points out in our chat, uh, Bulbasaur is the expansion in one way or another since as a GMax form now.

1645
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Oh, I didn't even, I actually didn't watch the direct. I just read all the new, cause you know, once you, once you kind of read everything, you're like, all right.

1646
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,000
And I've kind of seen it, but I guess I should go back and watch it at some point.

1647
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:43,000
So, uh, SGO and Hunter Matt in chat says, uh, folks who are losing their minds over this need to go outside.

1648
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Um, Akdeft in chat says, I only have shield, so it's only once. And yeah, I only have shield too. I only plan to buy it once.

1649
01:36:52,000 --> 01:37:05,000
If there's something I really need, I know I have a Pokemon affectionate auto number one fan for a friend where if I'm like, will you please get me an egg for such and such Pokemon?

1650
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:09,000
He'll get me an egg for such and such Pokemon. It's not that hard. You know what I mean?

1651
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:21,000
So, you know, just, and you know what, even if you're sitting there going, I don't have any friends, um, go to VOG network and talk to people because I'm sure there are tons of you raise your hand in chat.

1652
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:29,000
If you're willing to make eggs for people that really, really want to Pokemon, but can't afford the DLC, I'll fucking do it. Like I will.

1653
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,000
So I'm sure there are plenty of people that are willing to help get you.

1654
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,000
I realize y'all are going to be my egg donors. Okay.

1655
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:44,000
That's, that's how the world works in 2020. I, that is fine. I will be your egg donor. So I will be a surrogate for those eggs on my Pokemans.

1656
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Um, Shane also points out in gen five, if you wanted pre gen five Pokemon, you needed a second DS. So yeah, this doesn't seem bad at all.

1657
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:59,000
And Shane is saying, I'll always help in Pokemon. Uh, and active says Galarian slowpoke is the best. I got the shiny the same day.

1658
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Oh yeah, that was the thing they did too. So even, uh, just load up your sword and shield game and you go to the train station in the first town whose name is escaping me right now.

1659
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:20,000
But the very first town you're in, there's a train station and you will see one of the new characters and the character you see depends on, so I have shield.

1660
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:29,000
So I got the psychic lady with the Pokeballs spinning around her head. So, um, and, uh, there was a Galarian slowpoke there that I had to catch.

1661
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:37,000
So it was that muppet looking Galarian meowth. It's cute. That's just, they like to do the different stuff. It looks like a freaking muppet.

1662
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:52,000
He looks like animal and Dr. Teeth. Oh, wet mud wrestling. Oh, Shane and chat says that Avery is actually a guy, Rob. Well, it's, you know what? It's 2020 and gender is just a suggestion. So who cares? So that's that.

1663
01:38:52,000 --> 01:39:08,000
All right. Anyhow. Uh, so yeah, uh, the aisle armor is in June, 2020 crown tundra is in fall 2020. And, uh, yeah, your starter will be able to gigantamax, which will be fun, uh, and all that good stuff.

1664
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:14,000
So you can pre-order both now if you want. Um, I don't like to give my money away until it's ready.

1665
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Who pre-orders DLC? Especially if it's digital. I mean, come on.

1666
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Why? So Shane, when did you pre-order yours already? That I, I'm going to tell you why I probably wouldn't do it today, but I'll do it the week before because then I get that game if you pre-order.

1667
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:45,000
So that's what you get close. You get close in game. If you pre-order, I'm glad that. Hey, some of us are fashionistas. Okay. All right. So we like to be pretty.

1668
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:58,000
All right. Anyhow. Um, there you go. I'm excited. I think this is the way to do it. I'm happy. I'm happy. It's this and not sword to shield to or gun or armor like this is great.

1669
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:08,000
I think I just didn't expect this from Pokemon. So now that it's here, I'm like, cool. And they're addressing and they're addressing the Nash decks thing as a part of it.

1670
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Like I kind of didn't even think they really, I mean, we all kind of knew they'd do something, but I mean, especially when they found the files for, um, one of those, remember we had that story on an older episode that the files were in the game for one of the older ones.

1671
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:37,000
They had like, so I would bet that's a DLC Pokemon. So there's something going on there. But anyway, all right, let's move on. Uh, dark Sakura, a completely different story, but, um, here, here we go again with things we're going to change in 2020. Right?

1672
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Well, and you know how I feel about labor and unionizing, I'm a big, uh, big fan of, uh, unions. And of course we've had it recently in the news where, you know, by recently, I mean, in the last few months where a Kickstarter got in trouble for firing members who wanted to unionize.

1673
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Google was in trouble for firing members that were trying to unionize and using their work intranet to share labor laws with other people, which is by the way, if they're right to do so, um, the, the employee's right to share that information because it really should be posted in public areas.

1674
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:39,000
But now, um, there is a, uh, a group, uh, the CWA, um, and that's working with Game Workers Unite, which is a grassroots organization, um, to work on unionizing the, um, the tech world and video game development world, um, into a big labor union.

1675
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Um, right now the project is called the campaign to organize digital employees or code for short, how freaking clever, um, to see about getting that union going on to protect, uh, people who work in, um, those fields.

1676
01:41:54,000 --> 01:42:06,000
For example, um, uh, there was another, uh, a, uh, the Pittsburgh Association of Tech Professionals unionized Google, Google Subtractors, um, successfully.

1677
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Um, you know, there is, uh, even talk at the 2019 Video Game Developers Conference about the industry's practice of making employees work over 100 hours in a week to finish a game without extra pay.

1678
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Basically, we've talked about the crunch time thing before and how this abuses their employee, employees and puts out a substandard product.

1679
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:49,000
So, really, you know, with the, the walkouts at Google, the walkout at Riot Games, um, the claims of sexual harassment and just in general, uh, uh, what's the word I'm thinking, of discrimination at some, some video game companies, I think it's high time we had unions to protect the, the workers.

1680
01:42:49,000 --> 01:43:00,000
You know, and I'm going to tell people this, for anyone who's anti-union, you know what you have to thank a union for? How about your 40 hour work week? How about such concepts as overtime? How about eliminating child labor?

1681
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Uh, you want examples of what happens when, uh, workers are not protected by a union. Look at the, uh, Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, uh, fire in, uh, the early, early 19th century.

1682
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Uh, sorry, early, uh, uh, 20th century, 1900s. Look at, um, I mean, just, uh, construction standards. All of these come because of unions. OSHA we have to protect you at work because of fucking unions.

1683
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:39,000
So don't talk to me about being anti-union when you take everything that a union has given you for fucking granted. It's time that the tech field had the same thing.

1684
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Yeah, I'm, uh, I, I think it's one of those things where a lot of us have sort of seen this shoes been ready to drop for some time. It's just a matter of kind of like when, so I'm very curious to see how this proceeds.

1685
01:43:50,000 --> 01:44:06,000
What else I'm also kind of curious to hear about is the impact of AB5 in the game industry because we haven't heard a lot about that, but we do have some very big game makers here in California, which if you guys aren't aware, AB5 was the law here in California that talked about what is and what isn't an employee.

1686
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:19,000
And the targets of the law really felt like it was supposed to be Uber and Lyft basically is that, you know, if you, if you work so many, you know, it's contracts or whatever that basically this, this company should be treating you like an employee and you should have those types of employee benefits.

1687
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:27,000
I personally, I think the law, the, the law is good intention and I get what they're trying to do. I think there's some huge flaws.

1688
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:40,000
I have some artists friends that are really struggling with this and some journalists friends that are now getting turned away for work because the company realized it's not a national lots, California.

1689
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:48,000
So they just want to go hire people in Nevada and Arizona and all this stuff. So I think the law needs a lot of work still, but it is law.

1690
01:44:48,000 --> 01:45:02,000
And so I'm curious to see how it impacts kind of the gaming industry and some of those more established things. So, but going back into that though is that I think that if we do have the genes enabled here in state.

1691
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Then that also does give it gives a lot more power to be able to bargain with government agencies to have laws revised to have that the backing of the union behind those legislative actions to protect the workers who are affected negatively by these laws.

1692
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:29,000
So, I mean, and if you want to look at another recent example I mean SAG-AFTA when they had or after when they had their big thing for voice actors.

1693
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:42,000
You know, I think in the long run that unionizing will work out for the best will help with those laws in the books that may be abused right now like this new one.

1694
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:58,000
And also just, you know, let companies know that you can't keep taking your employees for granted, you cannot take advantage of them anymore. We are people, we have lives we need to have those lives protected, including our rights to work in a safe environment.

1695
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:07,000
So we'll be very curious to see what develops of this I have a feeling it's gonna be one of those 2020 stories we're going to look back on in December and see how far did this really come along throughout the year.

1696
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:20,000
So, in the meantime, we're going to move on to one comment by she hooked in please go ahead, 99% of companies are now not employee friendly we're becoming a slave labor country over the next 20 years.

1697
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:36,000
And I mean, but that's also going back into again where we're seeing certain government people really putting the money on the capitalist front instead of on the workers, so hopefully that will change.

1698
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:48,000
We'll see. All right, moving on to our next story Loki, so there was something that kind of caught the eyes of a lot of people covering CS and that was alien whereas concept UFO.

1699
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:58,000
It is a portable PC gaming system that has detachable controllers, where have I heard that before. Sounds kind of like the Nintendo Switch and that's kind of what it is.

1700
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:04,000
It's basically like a PC version of the Nintendo Switch it's got a 10 inch screen.

1701
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:19,000
So it's a little bit bigger than the switches six in 6.2 inch screen, and the joy six on the side or the this basically the controllers can actually detach from the system as well.

1702
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:28,000
It has a little kickstand in the back, and then you can kind of combine them together, much like you can with the joy cons, and their little attachment as well.

1703
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Right now it is just the concept so no word on what hardware is driving your what costs or when it's going to be out or anything like that, but it is neat to see like some sort of portable gaming type of thing.

1704
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:50,000
I'd be down for this. At one point I was trying to build something like this so why not, you know, of course it's Alienware so it's probably gonna be $1,000 so.

1705
01:47:50,000 --> 01:48:07,000
How fast would Nintendo try to shut this down though. I don't think they can it's not necessarily exactly it's not, it's not like the switch in the sense that you can use each individual controller as its own controller because it's not symmetrical in that way.

1706
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:16,000
It would just, they would come off and basically allow you to almost like plug this into your TV or something like that to play on your TV.

1707
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:25,000
I don't think that they can really sue them or anything for saying that they stole the idea but yeah it's definitely heavily inspired by it.

1708
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:30,000
You know kind of like the PlayStation Move and the Kinect and the Switch motion controls.

1709
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:41,000
I think we all have also known it's really just a matter of time before you know this the Switch idea gets borrowed by other people so I think in some ways this news isn't that surprising.

1710
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:46,000
It'll just be you know is it gonna look like a cheap knockoff like the the V?

1711
01:48:46,000 --> 01:49:04,000
No it doesn't it doesn't look like a cheap knockoff of the V they were showing some games running on it it was running pretty smooth so I don't know if it's necessarily something that's gonna take off but I mean we'll have to see what it ends up looking like if it ever actually comes out.

1712
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Yeah for sure. All right well moving on I'm gonna make this real quick because one of the other things that we saw at this Consumer Electronics Show this week was the new PlayStation 5 logo.

1713
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:17,000
That is not even something that needed like an announcement at all it's just stupid.

1714
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:28,000
It was the one piece of video game news that came out well here's the thing it and maybe this is the internet making a bigger deal out of it than it really is because Sony just kind of like talked about you know their their path trajectory and where PlayStation has been.

1715
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:34,000
They did not divulge anything about the new console that's going to come later. They just showed the new logo.

1716
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Now you might think this is a missed opportunity for me to show the logo here on Twitch but don't forget we're recording the audio for a podcast as well so you'll have to come with me to imagination land.

1717
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:49,000
OK. So here we go. Ready. Ready everybody. I want you to imagine the PlayStation 4 logo.

1718
01:49:49,000 --> 01:50:04,000
OK. So now you see in the cloud you see a PlayStation 4 logo. OK. Now I want you to take that 4. OK. And I want you to make it a 5. Oh my God. There it is. PlayStation 5 logo. That is as logo for the PlayStation 5.

1719
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Honestly enough though I think that it's smart for them to not change it because it still fits their branding. I mean because really they've kept that particular branding since the PS2.

1720
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:31,000
And all I get it like you know some you know and I'm sure dark soccer you could nerd about this because I know you're into typography and all this other stuff too is that you could nerd out about like how a font is representative to a brand and things like this and you do see it in other places.

1721
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:42,000
So as much as we might be giving this announcement a little bit of shit. It is kind of one of those things where it's like look it ain't broke. Don't fix it. This is PlayStation brand. This is what it looks like. Why would they change it now.

1722
01:50:42,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Exactly. But I'm bummed. That's it. They've essentially had the same damn thing since PlayStation 2. Really. The only thing with is it instead of they've done this thing that a lot of companies have done where they've really tried to simplify things because you know for PS2 for example it was that sort of gradiated blue purple color because you know the the PS2 also had that strip around it that had the same color and they've done white on black which it's just.

1723
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Very simple. It's simplified the branding as much as they can while still keeping that font that it's been known for. I'll be honest I still prefer the branding from the first PlayStation.

1724
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:38,000
I liked the text. It was very clean. I wish that they had stuck with that for a while and sort of got it because honestly the current PlayStation font went spelled out and said just P.S. It's kind of hard to read you know because it's more uniform in size.

1725
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:52,000
The thing is is that people recognize words by their shape which is why people have trouble reading things if they're all in caps. Just showing that out there. I think though that at least for sake of consistency it's a smart move.

1726
01:51:52,000 --> 01:52:01,000
They're like yeah we're still here. We don't need to do anything fancy. We don't need to change it up every time because our product is fucking solid.

1727
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:14,000
I'm going to put you on the spot a little bit so I apologize in advance because you may not have an easy answer to this question. But what would be for comparison sake what do you think would be another brand that's really defined by its font.

1728
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Google.

1729
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Back in the day. Remember people had a big shit over them moving from a serif font to a sans serif. Another one was another one that changed their font.

1730
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Gap did it for a little bit and then people were like super nuts about it and switch back to to Gap. In the 80s Apple's use of Adobe Garamond Pro in their ads.

1731
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:52,000
I remember that Gap controversy. Yeah. OK. Now the chat is chiming in. You ready. I think this is a great answer from SJ 100 Matt Disney Disney. Oh absolutely. That's a great answer.

1732
01:52:52,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Bobby with a tongue in cheek answer that's actually kind of legit vogue. Oh yeah. I mean we use I don't think it's easy. We use you can say it right. We use your style. Yeah you use your style as the font and that is the font that you see over in the sidebar and the low bar.

1733
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:19,000
And it's the same font that's in the logo. It's on our business card. Yeah it's everywhere. I I the only I custom did the O as you know the power symbol but even that was the G.

1734
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:35,000
But even that was built off of your style. Yeah. But I mean but going back into you know old era versus new you can look at an Apple ad from the 80s and just even without the picture there.

1735
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:51,000
You can look at the font on it and know that it's an 80s Apple ad because everything was set in Adobe Garamond Pro. You can look at New York Times their their headline logo not their headline but their logo is never changed.

1736
01:53:51,000 --> 01:54:04,000
You can just all they do is the N.Y.T. and you can look at those letters and know that they go to New York Times. In fact Times New Roman that font came because of the New York Times.

1737
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:17,000
You know you can look at. Gosh what else I'm thinking of that's had a consistent font. There's all those companies that use Helvetica but that's not really the same thing you just know.

1738
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Oh they're using fucking Helvetica. A couple of their answers here and then we'll probably move on for time. Did your mess says Microsoft which they changed theirs though didn't they.

1739
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Well actually the Xbox Series X Xbox one and Xbox 360 all use the same font. I remember what the original Xbox didn't. So they've kind of kept a consistent look since then.

1740
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Apple switched the SF font but it really has just been a variation of the last two iterations of fonts that were being used.

1741
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:57,000
And now though you can or even this you can look at like I'd say from the OS 10.9 earlier and how they all had that same font you could look at that and say oh that's that's from a Mac screen.

1742
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:08,000
You know and lastly she hope says Mercedes Mercedes is defined by their font. Very good one. Yeah absolutely. Great answers all around from chat and our soccer thing.

1743
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Yes. And pie culture's saying time and she thought this would be a quick topic didn't you. Well we ended up turning it into font nerd. So you know what worked.

1744
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:32,000
But I think that's something that people don't really think about with games or with anything is branding. Sure. You know think about something when you see a logo in the future. Ask yourself why is that sticking out in my head.

1745
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Why is it something that I'm always going to remember. And if you want to look up one of my personal heroes look at the logos that Saul Bass has designed for the record.

1746
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:51,000
He also directed the shower scene in Psycho. Just saying he was big friends with Hitchcock. He did a lot of the movie titles for Hitchcock movies.

1747
01:55:51,000 --> 01:56:03,000
But just look at his logo designs. He did Continental. He did Girl Scouts. He did Delta. I think airlines for a little while he did the United Way.

1748
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Look at his designs and look at the font choices with those and tell me why they have lasting memory. You know what else always looks fucking consistent with branding and font and everything.

1749
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:24,000
A Star Wars movie. Oh hell yeah. It's always that same font in the scroll in the beginning. It's always the credits cinema. The credits always look the same is branding too. Yeah. Like did you like you saw Mandalorian right. No I didn't.

1750
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Well the transitions. They use the wipes I bet right. He's a lot of the wipes. He's a lot of the same transitions they do in the movies. All right. Anyway we got to move on. We get to a whole other three hour podcast about brand nerds.

1751
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:50,000
I'm sure that podcast actually exists. It's got to somewhere I'm sure. All right. Anyway let's move on. So in the sidebar it says classic game of the week with a question mark because every week Dark Soccer likes to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks hey you guys should be enjoying this game this week.

1752
01:56:50,000 --> 01:57:03,000
I hope you approve of my pick last week by the way on if you saw what I picked Crystal Castles. Oh yeah. Yeah that's good. That's good. But we did do a game last week but you know it's a new year new twist and we've been promising this twist for some time.

1753
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:21,000
So Dark Soccer what is the 2020 twist. First off on this segment once a month we are doing a pinball game every month and it has to be that 90s era of pinball pre pinball 2000 but post when they started using the digital displays.

1754
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Well that's a restriction you're putting on yourself. I think the rest of us are just all pinball pinball. OK. Well I'm thinking about doing other more classic.

1755
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:42,000
You know this also means I can't do my beloved Black Knight 2000 for example. So but also still holding it to the same rules. I can do like my 2000 but you are going to still be holding it to the same rules of 10 years old at least.

1756
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Yeah. So we're we're basically I can just tell you this right now. Everything's going to be from the 90s. All right. Fair enough. All right. So tonight's is the first of twelve. So January's pick for the classic pinball table of the month.

1757
01:57:53,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Duh. World Cup soccer pinball. I knew it was going to be this. So. So and I tried to get something that would show the gameplay but the music on here is my favorite music in the damn game.

1758
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Would you hear for like all of a hot minute. It comes in just that it has like a weird drum loop in the game. Then your music comes in right after it. So yeah. But yeah I like the music. It's like right when the ball has been activated.

1759
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Yeah. And it only plays at this one point in the game. Right when it transitions to gameplay you start to hear it.

1760
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:37,000
I just think it's cool. Yeah. And by the way this is not footage from Dark Soccer's house. This is a YouTuber I forgot to credit my bad because I don't own sort of Fury and fuck if I did I would be in.

1761
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:57,000
But you see what's next to it is a regular Black Knight. Yeah. So that's cool. Anyway. Anyway. So and I will go into some video game stuff on this too. So basically World Cup soccer. It came out in 1994 February 1984 and my personal love of this game is that we had one at the arcade that I worked at.

1762
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:12,000
And I played the fuck out of this game. It is to this day my favorite pinball table. It was designed by John Papa Duke and Larry Demar Papa Duke in and of himself.

1763
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:26,000
He's also responsible for theater of magic. So another big one. You've definitely seen Papa Duke stuff. It does have some special toys as were a little bit marked for that era of pinball.

1764
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:34,000
It has a spinning soccer ball that when you've lit up all these items which makes the goal light up makes the goalie move the ball will start spinning.

1765
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:43,000
True story. Dan had my ball spinning backwards when we first got the table so you can imagine how freaking hard it was because you can bounce off the ball to knock it into the goal.

1766
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:59,000
But but that's the big thing is that it has a you know the soccer or football theme to it. There were eight thousand seven hundred forty three units confirmed produced.

1767
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:11,000
It has two flippers three pop bumpers two ramps roll under spinner kickback Magnus save located on the play field above the left flipper that is activated by an extra button on the left side the cabinet.

1768
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:26,000
There is a magna lock located on the middle left play field that holds the balls from multi multi ball play a goalie target move side to side at the top left play field and a maximum of three by in balls per player under the operator option.

1769
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:37,000
The the art was done by Kevin O'Connor. So you know it's just really one of the one of the great ones on there.

1770
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:50,000
This particular one people kind of overlook it a little bit just because oh soccer theme whatever but they don't realize that the game has actually had some pretty significant design to it.

1771
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Even my husband funny enough he was like I didn't you know really appreciate this one until you know you were all hyper about getting one.

1772
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:10,000
And then when we got one he's like oh yeah I really like it. So you can of course if you go to the Internet pinball database you can get the rule sets for this table if you want to know the ins and outs of it.

1773
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:32,000
I would say for anyone who wants to go play pinball and get good at playing pinball even if you're just going to your arcade to play it go to the Internet pinball database and look up the rules and see you know what tricks you can do how to get like your your jackpots how to get your different modes lined up in the game.

1774
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:48,000
So going with this one is that for I have a hole in my socks that makes me sad. Anyway I just noticed my favorite socks too. But anyway for the pinball arcade it was available as DLC and it was removed on June 30th 2018.

1775
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:59,000
And it was published as world champion soccer because Farsight Studios were unable to secure the World Cup soccer license from FIFA.

1776
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:08,000
And it had like all kinds of different things to it. But they also changed like the back glass and everything but it was roughly the same table.

1777
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:26,000
So some trivia about this one is that for the it looks like for the bonus round. I don't know if this is just for the digital versions or the arcade because I haven't really looked.

1778
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:40,000
Is it riding for Mortal Kombat as a cameo in the bonus round. And then the flyer for the machine shows an American football field as in you know like American football instead of a soccer field in the background.

1779
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:51,000
But the stadium shown is Soldier Field in Chicago that had many of the 1994 World Cup matches there including the opening match for 1994 World Cup.

1780
02:02:51,000 --> 02:03:05,000
So that is your game. It is World Cup soccer and I will also for the sake of chat provide a link from pinside dot com which is another great resource for pinball information.

1781
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:14,000
It's just really you know don't you know don't poopoo on it because it's soccer. It really is a solid game.

1782
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Again Papa Duke other things that he designed like I said theater magic is is really the big one.

1783
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:29,000
I'm trying to get it to load the list of it's got to make so much sense because theater magic also has another one of those like gigantic things in the middle of the table.

1784
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:33,000
So I guess a lot of people have that but theater magic is fucking amazing.

1785
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:43,000
I love magic. Well you know I have that too. Yeah. But yeah Papa Duke did a circus Voltaire.

1786
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:49,000
He did Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest.

1787
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:52,000
Star Wars Episode One.

1788
02:03:52,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Tornado Tales of the Arabian Nights. OK. So funny thing about this one at Moby Dick in San Francisco in the Castro.

1789
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:11,000
They have World Cup soccer theater magic and Tales of the Arabian Nights all next to each other in the back three of the greatest tables.

1790
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:19,000
And they're all John Papa. I don't know if they still do. They do. Oh do they. Wow. Yeah. One of my buddies who works at Cliffs.

1791
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:26,000
The fabric side of Cliffs was actually the one who told me that they were still there.

1792
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:34,000
But yeah. If you're in San Francisco go to Castro. If you want to try these three amazing Papa Duke tables all three of them are at Moby Dick.

1793
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:41,000
All right. And then you get your drink. All right. There it is your classic pinball table of the month World Cup soccer.

1794
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Ninety four. All right. Very cool. Y'all just can't come to my house. The first you bring me measure me chocolate.

1795
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:53,000
I'm sure Rob the first to that should be a contest in the future when a trip to our soccer house.

1796
02:04:53,000 --> 02:05:02,000
OK. I can sleep on my air mattress on the floor kind of like the old like win a trip to Nickelodeon Studios and tour the studios and get slimed on the city.

1797
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:08,000
You get that on television. Things like that. Like they should we should do a win a trip to Dark Soccer's house.

1798
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Yeah. Anyway. All right. Let's move on. We got more topics to get into here.

1799
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Plenty of show left and about a 20. So really sad about my song now because I can't replace these.

1800
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:26,000
They don't sell them anymore. I'm sorry. Look at my socks everybody. They have cats. All right.

1801
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Let's talk to Loki and get some rapid fire news. So you know who says old games can't be updated to offer new things.

1802
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:43,000
So apparently some of the console ports of Doom and Doom 2 have received some new updates to add a lot of new support.

1803
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:54,000
So, for example, 60 FPS support. So now Doom runs actually at 60 FPS instead of 35 FPS add on support.

1804
02:05:54,000 --> 02:06:08,000
So add ons can be downloaded and played from the main menu so that they can do a mixture of Doom and Doom 2 add ons as well as community episodes and megawatts.

1805
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Added aspect ratio options to the original four three. Added quick save and quick load.

1806
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Level select, weapon carousel, quick weapon select, brightness and level brightness, random sound effects, pitch toggle, new.

1807
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:38,000
They have a new HUD for the split screen. It's a minimal HUD to give you some more space to see in there and change the health graphics and change Wolfenstein secret level.

1808
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Did you know this is available on PC as well? Yeah. If you bought the game on the Bethesda store, if you bought it on steam, fuck you.

1809
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:55,000
That's yeah. I was. What about, what about dog? Uh, Nope. But that's the store. That's it.

1810
02:06:55,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Cause it has to be this particular 2019 or 18 rerelease. So they do remember when the big meme going around, you have to have a Bethesda net account to continue.

1811
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:14,000
Oh yeah. I remember that. Okay. That was from when they rereleased doom everywhere. So your version of doom has to be one of those that was part of that meme joke.

1812
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:21,000
So if you don't have a version of doom that had that, then it doesn't qualify. Oh well. Yeah, I guess I miss out. Who cares?

1813
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Um, and then this is kind of cool, but, uh, apparently there's a brand new mod, uh, grand theft auto vice city remastered that they have basically dumped the map of grand theft auto vice city into grand theft auto five on PC.

1814
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:49,000
So I guess you can go ahead and check it out now before it gets a cease and desist, but at least it's available right now in five mods.

1815
02:07:49,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Get it now before it's gone. All right. Um, moving on, uh, Nintendo apparently filed a new trademark for a Mario and Luigi game, but wait a minute.

1816
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Didn't they close the studio behind that? Well, something may be going on here. Uh, so Nintendo of America filed a new trademark in South America, uh, and, uh, says the trademark will be for computer game cartridges, game memory cards, and so on and so on.

1817
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:23,000
This could just be them making sure their intellectual property doesn't go away or anything like that, but it should, you know, just caught people's eyes. Like why now? Why this? So put it in out there.

1818
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Uh, also from consumer electronics show the retron junior, uh, it plays game boy, game boy color and game boy advanced games all on your TV.

1819
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:37,000
It's this teeny tiny little box, uh, that connects to the TV via an HDMI, and then it will output the games in seven 20 P.

1820
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Uh, it has a super Nintendo style scout controller, uh, that connects to the console. And so you can actually, uh, yeah, play all your portable games on your TV.

1821
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:56,000
But that's, uh, for those of you that want to go back and play your old Pokemon games, there's how you can do it. Can I get a link cable to, uh, connected to another retron mini that I can then put transfer my Pokemon across?

1822
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:08,000
There is a 3.5 millimeter headphone socket and link port, which allows two retron junior systems to be connected together for games, which support multiple players. Awesome. How about that? Hell yes. They thought of everything.

1823
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:12,000
They thought of everything and the kitchen sink. All right. Dark Sakura.

1824
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Well, um, the, uh, game artist for the silent hill, uh, series, the early silent hill series, um, Ito Masahiro, um, has teased on Twitter that he is working on a title as a core member and they hope it won't be canceled.

1825
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:47,000
He was one of the members of team silent. Um, and just his art was, was absolutely haunting. Um, one of really the things that made silent hill. Um, I, I have one of the lithographs thanks to Shane for silent hill too. It's one of my favorite things. I think he signed it too.

1826
02:09:47,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Um, but just one of my favorite artists and I'm super, super happy. And I hope it is something very silent hill-ish and that maybe he might, I'm, I've got this dream in my head that he's working on something with Kojima.

1827
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Anything's possible. In my head, in my heart. And then also AGDQ 2020, which I brought this up earlier. They broke 3 million. They were so close to pie million Rob.

1828
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:27,000
They made it to 3.13 million for prevent cancer foundation. And it is the second GDQ that has raised more than $3 million in the marathon.

1829
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:45,000
Um, it had 54,134 donors as of 11 AM Eastern time yesterday, I believe, no this morning, I think. Um, and it raised more than 700,000 above what AGDQ, uh, raised last year, which is a 30% increase.

1830
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Um, and it's absolutely amazing to, to see what happens when people put together for good, when they do so much fun. I watched the Animorphs run. It was fucking hilarious.

1831
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Um, just the guy they had doing Animorphs. And then he, he hung around, um, jawing with some other people. He's absolutely hilarious.

1832
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Um, I had a really good time watching this. I'm glad I got to contribute. And, um, the, uh, Summer Games Done Quick, which is our next one, is happening June 21st through 28th in Bloomington, Minnesota.

1833
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:36,000
Um, uh, for this particular one though, there were 134 games that were run over the event, um, including the, um, uh, incentive and, uh, honk. Honk. That's it.

1834
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:44,000
All right. Congrats to the folks at Awesome Games Done Quick for another very successful year. So breaking 3 million is no, I remember when breaking 2 million was the big deal.

1835
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:56,000
So the first one was like a few hundred thousand. Yeah. So they've come a long, long way. And that's, I mean, that's, then it's great for great charity. So always love to report on the, the good news, uh, in the gaming world.

1836
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:04,000
So let's travel around and check out some world release dates. I don't know if it's a busy week this week, but, uh, it should be starting to pick up again.

1837
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:19,000
It's not busy, but it's, it's decent for, uh, January. I mean, so we've got a few things starting off with, uh, Outlier Dust Trilogy, the deluxe pack coming on PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4.

1838
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:31,000
We have, uh, Puzzle and Dragon Gold on Nintendo Switch. Uh, we've got Dragon Ball Z, uh, Kakarot on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1839
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Uh, Tokyo Mirage, uh, looks like, uh, Sessions Fe Encore. And that's coming out on Nintendo Switch.

1840
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:50,000
And then finally, uh, we've got Yakuza Like a Dragon on PlayStation 4. That's it.

1841
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:58,000
All right. Going to Japan. It's a little bit of a slower week in Japan as well. Um, on the Nintendo Switch, we have Mysetsu Pure Station comes out this week.

1842
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Uh, and then the big release is probably the Tokyo Mirage Sessions, uh, appears to be a world release, uh, this week.

1843
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:08,000
So it's also coming out in Japan the exact same day. And that's, that's probably going to be a pretty big deal over there.

1844
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Um, but the PlayStation 4, not to be left out, uh, is getting some releases still.

1845
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Sangokushi 14 in a regular and treasure box. Uh, a game called the Kandakawa Jet Girls DX Jet Pack is in a regular and limited edition.

1846
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Uh, and then Yakuza Like a Dragon is also out there. And Dragon Ball Z Kakarot is out on PlayStation 4 as well.

1847
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:35,000
So that's what you have to look forward to in Japan. How about the UK, Dark Sakura?

1848
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Some stuff. So we have, um, Neverwinter Nights Enhanced Edition Collector's Pack.

1849
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Um, that is on the 16th. We also have Planescape Torment Icewind Dale, same on the 16th, and Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition.

1850
02:13:52,000 --> 02:14:02,000
We also have Creed Rise to Glory on January 16th. For PlayStation, we have Beamdog Ultimate Collector's Pack, which is the first three games I mentioned.

1851
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Tokyo Mirage Sessions FE Encore, um, also on the 16th.

1852
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Just real quick, the chatters are saying that that hashtag is supposed to be the sharp sign in music, so it's Sharp FE.

1853
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Sharp? Yeah. Okay. You wouldn't know by looking.

1854
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Sessions. So, um, and also, uh, I was reading what was on the description.

1855
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:27,000
I know. And Dragon Ball Z Kakarot also on the 16th.

1856
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:34,000
Okay. There's your release dates. So let's go to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails.

1857
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:40,000
Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com, and we read our favorite emails and our least favorite emails here on the program.

1858
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
Do we have any emails tonight? We do. Okay.

1859
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:47,000
So, of course, no one has guessed my, um, favorite brand of chocolate.

1860
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Well, then you can, you can bring the Philz coffee here. I will. Although they don't make it in K-Cups.

1861
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Philz is all pour over. Um, dear Tangerine Cafe Station.

1862
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:08,000
What? I just want to chime in my thoughts regarding the discussion you had about the Nintendo Switch's lackluster interface.

1863
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:13,000
There's something I loved about the 3DS, and that was the fact I could open it up to hear Amy Rose's theme,

1864
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:17,000
My Sweet Passion, playing from the speakers with that bubbly pink background.

1865
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Themes. I was super bummed that these didn't get carried over to the Switch,

1866
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:25,000
and it definitely lets us freshen up the menu to match our own unique tastes.

1867
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Just look at the PS4 and its wide selection available in the store. It's great.

1868
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Currently, I can power on my PS4 to the cool slow jam of Beneath the Mask from Persona 5,

1869
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:42,000
while Makoto looks at me with a judging look like I'm about to be booted off Love Island.

1870
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:47,000
I want this same experience on the Switch, and I hope dearest daddy Doug Bowser can make my dreams come true.

1871
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Thanks for reading, Garth Wolf.

1872
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Okay. Your dear daddy, huh?

1873
02:15:55,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Anyway, um, next email is taking a while to load. There we go.

1874
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Um, actually, yeah, this is, okay, it's the same thing that I was talking about.

1875
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:11,000
We just got a release, um, about the Communication Workers of America.

1876
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:19,000
So I thought this was, like, a legit email, but this is a marketing email outlining the story that I said earlier.

1877
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:23,000
But there are some quotes on here that I would like to read.

1878
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:29,000
Companies in the technology and game industries have gotten away with avoiding accountability for far too long.

1879
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:33,000
That's according to President Chris Shilton of CWA.

1880
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Workers in these industries are exposing the reality behind the rhetoric.

1881
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:46,000
This initiative will help tech and game companies reach the next level in their efforts to exercise their right to join together and demand change.

1882
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Um, so, yeah.

1883
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:52,000
But, hey, we got on an official press release. That's pretty impressive.

1884
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:55,000
I mean, yeah.

1885
02:16:55,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Now, if you want to hire me to be your speaker and do podcasts for you, I'll fucking do it.

1886
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:09,000
I do like money, though. So, I mean, I won't do it for free. Just saying.

1887
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:13,000
But, yeah, um, that seems to be it for the mailbag.

1888
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:21,000
I am really irritated, chatters, that I haven't gotten any more email from you guys because today I was actually excited about reading email.

1889
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:24,000
And, yeah.

1890
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:27,000
So, where's the rest of my emails?

1891
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:33,000
You haven't guessed? Okay. I need to give y'all another idea of what chocolate I like.

1892
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:37,000
I also like your shirt that says that's too much bacon, so no one ever.

1893
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Loki.

1894
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Yes.

1895
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
Okay.

1896
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:46,000
So, my favorite brand of chocolate is an American company.

1897
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
I believe they're American.

1898
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:57,000
They are fair trade and do not engage in companies that use slavery for their chocolate sourcing.

1899
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:01,000
And they are not giardelli.

1900
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:07,000
And Rob is a quality human who brought me popcorn.

1901
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:11,000
I know. She made me get in the kitchen and cook for her while she was doing the mailbags.

1902
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Right.

1903
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:13,000
All right.

1904
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:16,000
But it's for everybody popcorn.

1905
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:17,000
All right.

1906
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
This kettle corn, too, is delicious. Sorry, not sorry.

1907
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Let's move on, Loki. We got some more news still to get to, right?

1908
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:25,000
So, yeah. This is kind of interesting.

1909
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:41,000
So, basically, according to Xbox's Matt Booty, he confirmed that for the first party Xbox Series X games, they're not going to be exclusive for at least the first year or two.

1910
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:51,000
So, apparently, they said, as our content comes out over the next year or two years, all of the games, sort of like PC, will play up and down the family of devices.

1911
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:58,000
We want to make sure that someone invests in Xbox between now and the Series X that they feel that they've made a good investment.

1912
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Meaning that they're kind of treating this console like a cell phone or a tablet or something like that to where, yeah, it'll play on the Xbox One or Xbox One X, but the fidelity of the graphics and the features may not be as great as, say, the Series X.

1913
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:19,000
Here's the thing.

1914
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:24,000
I thought that was supposed to be. I thought we already knew that. I thought they had said that some time ago.

1915
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
But it's, I think, more of a confirmation.

1916
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Yeah, it is a bit of a confirmation, but also, I thought this was going to be the case forever. I didn't think it was just going to be the case for the first year or two.

1917
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:37,000
That's what's striking me odd about this news. I just not understand that correctly.

1918
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:46,000
I don't know if it's forever because, like with modern devices now, they only support, you know, so far back.

1919
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Like, there's certain games that are going to get to a technical point where you can't do that on those systems.

1920
02:19:52,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Maybe necessarily natively, but maybe they'll say, yeah, you can't play this natively on the platform, but we have xCloud that you can stream it, you know, that way.

1921
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
Yeah, I kind of thought that was going to be it.

1922
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:15,000
So it's like, okay, yeah, you might not be able to purchase, say, you know, Halo Infinite 5 or whatever, you know, down the road, but you'll be able to stream it.

1923
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:19,000
With xCloud or, you know, who knows, it may be part of Games Pass.

1924
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Swongtong in chat says, sheesh, with all these studios MS Bot and nothing.

1925
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:26,000
I don't think that's quite what we mean when we say exclusives.

1926
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:30,000
We're talking about things that will only play on Xbox Series X and not the prior Xbox console.

1927
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:33,000
Right, so they'll be exclusive to Microsoft consoles, but they're...

1928
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:40,000
But we already know about Hellblade 2. That is a game that will be exclusive to the Microsoft, you know, and that comes from a studio that Microsoft bought.

1929
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Right, so they'll have that, but you'll also be able to play it on Xbox One X.

1930
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:55,000
So basically what they're telling you now is like, hey, if you're in the market to get an Xbox One and you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I don't want to buy an Xbox One and then have to turn around and buy an Xbox Series X.

1931
02:20:55,000 --> 02:21:03,000
You're like, well, you know what, don't worry about it because you'll be at least able to play these brand new games for the next few years.

1932
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:06,000
You don't have to worry about being kind of shut out of those.

1933
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Yeah, I just sort of figured out the... or figured the cloud support would help that go on a much longer forever type of deal.

1934
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:28,000
And it might, but like, you know, at some point though, much like the Xbox 360 and stuff, they have to kind of cut out those old systems because they want to do more advanced technical stuff with it and it's just not going to be possible on that kind of hardware.

1935
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
It's going to be too old.

1936
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:35,000
Shehulk10 says, will not run at max settings on old consoles, 4K HDR.

1937
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:40,000
Yeah, but not everybody is necessarily going to have a 4K TV anyway. I still don't have a 4K TV.

1938
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:45,000
So, because I bought a fucking TV right before 4K became really cheap.

1939
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:49,000
And so I'm like, God damn it, I'm going to drive that one into the ground.

1940
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:57,000
My wife and our father-in-law also just purchased a TV for her mom.

1941
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:01,000
So like a 65 inch 4K TV is like 500 bucks.

1942
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:05,000
They're like such... they've come down in price.

1943
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:10,000
So that thing, they went from a 40 inch to a 65 inch. So it's just like, boom!

1944
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:13,000
It's like, it's huge now.

1945
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:18,000
Alright, so yeah, I gotta work on upgrading the TV at some point, we'll see.

1946
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:23,000
Anyway, an interesting report has come out about streaming in the year 2019.

1947
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:28,000
So, and I mean like video game streaming, meaning sites like the one you're on right now, Twitch, watching this show.

1948
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:33,000
I guess not necessarily because you'd be on the podcast, but for those that are live on Sunday, you're on Twitch, of course.

1949
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Which is one of the larger players in the game.

1950
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:43,000
Or it could be the rebroadcast, or not rebroadcast, but like, you know, they could be watching the wonderful archives that you...

1951
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Of course.

1952
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:45,000
And if you subscribe.

1953
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:48,000
Thank you for the cheap plug. Yes, please subscribe, then you can watch all the archives.

1954
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
But that is also on Twitch.

1955
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:59,000
But an interesting kind of study, talking about data from stream elements and a site called arsenal.gg.

1956
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Talking a little bit about some of the game streaming statistics.

1957
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Apparently Facebook gaming has been on the rise.

1958
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:11,000
December 2019 brought in an 8.5% market share.

1959
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:19,000
So that is, yeah, quite a jump in the market share there, compared with 3.1% from the year before.

1960
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:28,000
So that's quite the increase, which I got to be honest, I've never watched a Facebook game thing ever.

1961
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:32,000
But I've seen it in my feed because Facebook has tried to shove it down my throats.

1962
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Yes.

1963
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
But do you know how I fixed that problem?

1964
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:39,000
I uninstalled the Facebook app from my phone and that was my New Year's thing.

1965
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:43,000
And I got to say, I'm only about 11 days in, but it feels fucking great.

1966
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:51,000
I'm checking Instagram a lot more, which is funny because that's a Facebook company.

1967
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
I darn well know that.

1968
02:23:53,000 --> 02:24:00,000
But as far as the Facebook updates and all that toxic shit that's out there on Facebook, I don't see it as much.

1969
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:07,000
I mean, I say as much because I still check on the desktop on the weekends and sometimes at night and stuff.

1970
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:12,000
But I'm not continuously hitting the fucking IV for more content.

1971
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:13,000
Yeah.

1972
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:14,000
And it's cool.

1973
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
I fixed Twitter a little bit by blocking any.

1974
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:23,000
And so because any of the advertisements that you see, there are sponsored tweets or whatever, it's always an account.

1975
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
So I block every single one of those accounts I see.

1976
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
And I hardly get advertisements.

1977
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
You know, Fog has used that in the past, just so you know.

1978
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Well, no, but I understand that.

1979
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:35,000
But I block all those.

1980
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
So I hardly see advertisements anymore.

1981
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
Well, we haven't done it since, for what it's worth.

1982
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:49,000
But that's a personal choice just because also I'm not thrilled with where Facebook is going and how they're trying to get their hands in every pot.

1983
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
And game live streaming is...

1984
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:55,000
I got some email that was like, come stream on Facebook gaming.

1985
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
And I was just like, I think the fuck not.

1986
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
So that was that.

1987
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:02,000
So cut back on Facebook, you guys.

1988
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:03,000
You'll feel so much better.

1989
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:06,000
I'm not saying you have to delete it or get rid of it, but just, you know.

1990
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
I can't find anything of importance on there anyways.

1991
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:12,000
It's usually just advertisements for stuff.

1992
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:17,000
That's the thing about how they're supposed to track your activity so that they can advertise to you.

1993
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
It's like you're just advertising for things I've already bought.

1994
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:26,000
I don't need a computer desk because I already bought a computer desk for my son.

1995
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:27,000
That's already done.

1996
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:32,000
I don't need this stuff. Rollerblades.

1997
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:33,000
Anyway, do you know what I did?

1998
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:38,000
I put the icon in its place where Facebook used to be.

1999
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:41,000
I put LiveJournal where Facebook used to be.

2000
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:42,000
No, seriously.

2001
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:50,000
The first two days, I couldn't tell you how many times just out of habit I tapped that icon and just brought up the LiveJournal login page.

2002
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:51,000
And I was like, God damn it.

2003
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
I played myself again.

2004
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:57,000
But that's all part of taking the Band-Aid off.

2005
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
I'm going back to Tumblr.

2006
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Tumblr? What's on Tumblr these days?

2007
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
Fandom and bunnies and pure things.

2008
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:05,000
I like bunnies.

2009
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:09,000
Anyway, back to the story which talks about game streaming data.

2010
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:13,000
Twitch still has the most hours.

2011
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:21,000
They're up to 728 million hours, but their share dropped from 67.1% to 61%.

2012
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:31,000
That's still over half, but probably because Twitch is starting to get challenged a little more from companies like Facebook and other companies like YouTube,

2013
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:38,000
which YouTube Gaming, specifically YouTube Gaming, because I think if you were to weigh in all of YouTube, you'd have a lot more,

2014
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:43,000
but they are at 27.9% of the share.

2015
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:47,000
And then Mixer has 2.6% of the share.

2016
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:50,000
That's up from 2% despite some of the big names.

2017
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Oh, I wholly intend to believe that Facebook will get overtaken by Mixer this year.

2018
02:26:58,000 --> 02:26:59,000
Easy.

2019
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Let's hope.

2020
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:04,000
I would watch 50 Mixer streams before I ever watch a Facebook stream.

2021
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
I can't imagine.

2022
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:09,000
I just use the Facebook streaming for watching Drag Queen's paint.

2023
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:13,000
That's different. That's not gaming streaming anyway.

2024
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Honestly, I'll watch Drag Queen's painting on YouTube. You can get a lot of that there.

2025
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:21,000
I cannot believe I'm eating this whole bowl of popcorn. Thank you.

2026
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:22,000
You're welcome.

2027
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:31,000
All I ever get is Drag Queen videos in my recommends, because one time I watched a Jake Yonce video,

2028
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:35,000
and now it's, who is going to be exposed tonight?

2029
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:38,000
That is all that comes up on my YouTube recommends.

2030
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
I'm about to delete that site too.

2031
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:46,000
You don't have to delete it. You can just take those videos and then say, I don't like this, and then it will ask you.

2032
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:50,000
But stop letting you do that on YouTube. You can't do that anymore.

2033
02:27:50,000 --> 02:28:00,000
No, I didn't. I did today, because I was, once again, I did research to try to find the perfect TV for my mother-in-law.

2034
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:06,000
And we got to the store, and I was giving them my recommendations about the specs, because I did this the whole week and stressed myself out.

2035
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
And all they did was like, I like that one!

2036
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:11,000
It's like, fucking hell.

2037
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:14,000
But that one, the picture is not as great as that one.

2038
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:17,000
I like that one! That one's nice. The picture is nice.

2039
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:20,000
The picture is nice. I'm like, fine! I don't care anymore.

2040
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:23,000
It's like, okay, whatever.

2041
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:30,000
So, I have a bunch of TV review things in my feed, so I clicked on those and I'm like, I don't want to watch this.

2042
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:35,000
And then they're like, well, why? And I'm like, I don't want recommendations based on this one video that I watched.

2043
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:39,000
And so, it will stop sending that stuff through.

2044
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:45,000
And not necessarily get rid of everything, but at least cut down on if you're getting certain types of things.

2045
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
Okay, well, it's good to know. I'll have to remember that for the future.

2046
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
So, all right.

2047
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:56,000
All right, let's move on and talk about, I guess, kind of one of those gaming does a good thing type of stories.

2048
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Which I think Jason hinted at in the beginning, actually.

2049
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:03,000
Yes, and I was super proud to read this.

2050
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:07,000
So, there was a gamer.

2051
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
The gamer, that's all we talked about.

2052
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:14,000
His name was Aidan Jackson, a 17-year-old gamer in the UK.

2053
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:18,000
And he was talking with an American friend.

2054
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:25,000
And apparently his friend heard him go silent on the line.

2055
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:31,000
And the person's name was Dia, by the way.

2056
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:40,000
She, I think it was a she, yeah, said that there wasn't any response on the line.

2057
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:43,000
That it sounded really sudden and really terrible.

2058
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:54,000
And so, she called emergency, well, she tried to get through to emergency services for his area in the UK.

2059
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:59,000
And when she couldn't, she got to non-emergency services and said that she was talking to her friend online.

2060
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:04,000
He was unresponsive, but she had the address and was able to direct them.

2061
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:08,000
And his parents didn't even know.

2062
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:13,000
And so, they didn't know anything about it until the emergency services arrived at the door.

2063
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:17,000
And then they found him unresponsive on the floor, or barely responsive on the floor.

2064
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
He had had a seizure.

2065
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:30,000
So, because of an online gamer across the world, they were able to save him from a potentially life-threatening situation.

2066
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
Yeah, thank you, Internet.

2067
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:35,000
Certainly a frightening situation.

2068
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:40,000
And so, her thing says, I'll just read you what she said.

2069
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:45,000
I just put my headset back on and I heard what could only be described as a seizure.

2070
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:50,000
So, obviously, I started to get worried and immediately started asking what was going on and if he was okay.

2071
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:54,000
When he didn't respond, I instantly started to look up the emergency number in the EU.

2072
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:57,000
When that didn't work, I had to hope non-emergency would work.

2073
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
It had the option for talking to a real person.

2074
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:02,000
And I can't tell you how quickly I clicked that button.

2075
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:05,000
So, there you go.

2076
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:09,000
I actually do keep a list of emergency services for my international friends.

2077
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:14,000
Just because. Just because.

2078
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
Since Pod Culture brought it up in chat, I will read it.

2079
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:19,000
Pod Culture said, here's one thing Facebook was good for.

2080
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:23,000
You calling the police for me a couple years ago, this story reminded me of that.

2081
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:24,000
I did.

2082
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:29,000
There was a status update that I found very concerning and that is the thing that happened.

2083
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:30,000
So, you're right.

2084
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:33,000
Sometimes internet friends can help each other out in those types of ways.

2085
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:37,000
So, very important and good to know.

2086
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:38,000
All right.

2087
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:39,000
Let's move on.

2088
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:40,000
Let's talk about.

2089
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:44,000
I like this too as far as like classic gaming kind of goes.

2090
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Because this is a game inspired by classic game.

2091
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:47,000
Exactly.

2092
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:50,000
So, VVV.

2093
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:54,000
They released the source code for the game.

2094
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:59,000
So, apparently, I believe it was right after the run on AGDQ.

2095
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:03,000
Basically saying, hey, guess what?

2096
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:04,000
Surprise.

2097
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
It's open source now.

2098
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:12,000
So, now you can actually download the code for the game on GitHub and take a look at it.

2099
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:19,000
And then there's even some other stuff you can look at in there.

2100
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Not necessarily something you want to use if you're trying to make your own custom levels.

2101
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:27,000
They have the make and play version of the game, I guess, if you want to do that.

2102
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
That might be a little bit easier.

2103
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:32,000
But at least you can kind of tinker around and see how the game was made.

2104
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
So, pretty cool.

2105
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:38,000
And if you never played VVVV, it's great.

2106
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Yeah, you should really do it.

2107
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:40,000
It's been given away free.

2108
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:41,000
I don't know how many times.

2109
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
You probably have it in some collection or another.

2110
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:46,000
But even if you have to pay a couple bucks for it, it's really reasonable.

2111
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
So, it's a great game.

2112
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:49,000
Really hard.

2113
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
Bobby, I guess, took a look at the source code.

2114
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
He's in our chat room saying the game was so terribly written.

2115
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
The source code is amazing.

2116
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:58,000
Just shows that games are a patchwork of crappy code.

2117
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
And that means your code doesn't have to be perfect.

2118
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:01,000
It just has to work.

2119
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Ain't that the truth?

2120
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:03,000
Ain't that the truth?

2121
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:04,000
All right.

2122
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:08,000
And lastly tonight, before we start to look at our Discord to see if we have any calls,

2123
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:11,000
over at vognetwork.com slash Discord,

2124
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:15,000
has to do with Steam kind of revamping the way that they work soundtracks.

2125
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:19,000
So, now you don't have to actually own a video game in order to have the soundtrack

2126
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:25,000
because previously soundtracks were quantified or categorized, I suppose, as DLC.

2127
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:26,000
They're taking that away.

2128
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:29,000
So, now it is a soundtrack app type.

2129
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:35,000
So, it will let you use a soundtrack and then you can manage that within the Steam library.

2130
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:40,000
And apparently a developer can convert their DLC to soundtrack stuff today.

2131
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
And that will work.

2132
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:48,000
And then some folks are saying this could mean that technically you could have a game that was exclusive to Epic Store,

2133
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
but they could still sell the soundtrack on Steam.

2134
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:53,000
I don't know whether Steam would want to list that or not, but who knows?

2135
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:59,000
I guess it depends on the agreement between all those folks and the publisher.

2136
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:03,000
I went into my Steam library today to see if I had anything that was like soundtracks,

2137
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:04,000
but I didn't see anything yet.

2138
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:07,000
But I'm thinking maybe things just haven't been converted.

2139
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
I don't usually buy a lot of standalone soundtracks either,

2140
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:15,000
but I figured I bought enough combo stuff on Steam that probably got, you know what I mean?

2141
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
I had stuff included.

2142
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:22,000
Like, you bought the exclusive Year of the Whatever edition that comes with the soundtrack, you know what I mean?

2143
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
But I hadn't seen any of that when I went into my Steam library.

2144
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:28,000
Well, a lot of that stuff that I have with soundtracks tends to be in Humble Store,

2145
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
so I have a ton of soundtracks sitting in there.

2146
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
That's very true.

2147
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:37,000
Anyway, the soundtrack feature should debut on January 20th.

2148
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
Oh, I see. It's still behind the scenes right now.

2149
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
Maybe that's why I'm not really seeing everything there.

2150
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:44,000
So, right now is the conversions kind of going on behind the scenes.

2151
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:47,000
So, maybe you'll see more when that officially launches.

2152
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:50,000
Valve is not turning into a music store or anything like this.

2153
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:55,000
This is just a way for them to kind of put soundtracks in their own category

2154
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
and let them stand on their own,

2155
02:34:57,000 --> 02:35:00,000
as opposed to being a footnote to something that comes with the game.

2156
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:04,000
So, I think that's kind of a nice little change if nothing else.

2157
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:07,000
Excuse me.

2158
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:08,000
All right.

2159
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:12,000
So, I'm going to check our green room over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

2160
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:16,000
While I take a peek there, do we want to get into any last-minute stories?

2161
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:17,000
Yes.

2162
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Let's talk about Minecraft, School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

2163
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:30,000
It's a four-year project that brings a Harry Potter-themed RPG to vanilla Minecraft.

2164
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:33,000
And it's a project right now that's being supported by Patreon.

2165
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:38,000
They're hoping to release it later this month for free.

2166
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:46,000
And it's, I guess, from the Floo Networks, which is a YouTube group.

2167
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:47,000
So, interesting.

2168
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
They have different stuff you can do in there.

2169
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:53,000
They have different classes, summoning Patronuses.

2170
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:56,000
You can do Quidditch.

2171
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:57,000
Looks pretty amazing, actually.

2172
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:01,000
I'm all for people seizing Harry Potter and making it their own right now.

2173
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:02,000
That's pretty cool.

2174
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
With everything that's going out in the world.

2175
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Right, Dark Sakura?

2176
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
It now belongs to the fans, right?

2177
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:08,000
It belongs to the fans.

2178
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:09,000
Just don't give it any money.

2179
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
Harry Potter belongs to the fans now.

2180
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:12,000
It looks pretty amazing.

2181
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:13,000
It's a great way to do it.

2182
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Like, it's seriously pretty awesome looking.

2183
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:19,000
So, check that out hopefully later this month.

2184
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:20,000
I may have to check that out later this month.

2185
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
It looks pretty cool.

2186
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
All right, anything else?

2187
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Ah, that's it.

2188
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:29,000
At least that's all I found.

2189
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:32,000
They have stuff on the postage stamps and stuff that didn't make the show roll.

2190
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:33,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2191
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:36,000
They're going to have some classic game postage stamps for Royal Mail.

2192
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:37,000
I'm eating popcorn.

2193
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:38,000
It's really good.

2194
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:39,000
So, that was kind of...

2195
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
Is it the best?

2196
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:42,000
That was kind of neat.

2197
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:47,000
I thought it was funny, though, because, well, it's, you know, because it's, you know, the

2198
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:50,000
Royal Mail, so it's obviously, you know, European games.

2199
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:53,000
So, they have like Worms, Dizzy was one of the ones in there.

2200
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:58,000
Like, some of these games that you may not think, well, Dizzy, I know that's not really

2201
02:36:58,000 --> 02:36:59,000
popular over here.

2202
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:03,000
No, but it was a huge, it was either, was it a Commodore game or is that X Spectrum

2203
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:04,000
game?

2204
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:05,000
I don't remember.

2205
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:08,000
But it was, I do know, I know Dizzy.

2206
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:09,000
Dizzy was released here.

2207
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:10,000
We have a version of it.

2208
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:14,000
It just wasn't as big of a title here as it was in the UK.

2209
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:15,000
Right.

2210
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:18,000
And then I'm trying to remember the other ones real quick.

2211
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:21,000
I'm trying to pull it up.

2212
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:22,000
Let's see.

2213
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
I don't know.

2214
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:28,000
It was just a few games, but I'm surprised they haven't done anything like that over

2215
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:29,000
here yet.

2216
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:34,000
Like, any sort of, like, have they done any classic gaming stamps over here?

2217
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:37,000
No, ours really tend to be people.

2218
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
Aren't there like Pac-Man ones?

2219
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:40,000
There might have been.

2220
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:43,000
I feel like there might have been, like, some 80s ones, but, um, well, you can make your

2221
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:46,000
own damn stamp in this day and age, you know?

2222
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:47,000
Yeah, right.

2223
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:48,000
Okay.

2224
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:49,000
Well, okay.

2225
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:50,000
So they have, let's see here.

2226
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:51,000
So it looks like it is...

2227
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
Tomb Raider, Worms, and other...

2228
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:54,000
Elite.

2229
02:37:54,000 --> 02:38:03,000
They've got Sensible Soccer, Wipeout, Dizzy, Worms, Lemmings, Micro Machines, and Populous.

2230
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
Those are all very, like, UK-developed games.

2231
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:08,000
So it's a pretty good list to use there.

2232
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:09,000
I like that.

2233
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:10,000
So.

2234
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:11,000
And apparently, they were...

2235
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:18,000
It says the chosen franchises were nominated by the British gaming body, Yuki, and they

2236
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:19,000
were...

2237
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
Let's see.

2238
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:29,000
As well as, apparently, they had the Mean Machines editor-journalist Julian Jazz Ragnell,

2239
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:37,000
and author Sam Dyer, who put together some gaming compendiums like Commodore 64, a visual

2240
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:41,000
compendium, and the Metal Slug, The Ultimate History.

2241
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:45,000
Now, my next question is, when was the last time any of you sent a piece of mail?

2242
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:49,000
I actually send cards regularly to my mother.

2243
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:50,000
Oh, that's...

2244
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Okay.

2245
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:52,000
I get that.

2246
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:53,000
And to other people.

2247
02:38:53,000 --> 02:39:06,000
So it looks like there were some stamps for the US that were designed and approved, but

2248
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:07,000
not set up.

2249
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:10,000
Here's another thing I was going to talk about.

2250
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Wait, I have something.

2251
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Can I have...

2252
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:13,000
I want to hear a story.

2253
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
No, I think this one's important, actually.

2254
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:21,000
Because Infinity Ward announced this week that they will be donating the proceeds of,

2255
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:25,000
for Call of Duty Modern Warfare, there is an Outback pack that is coming out.

2256
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Well, what do we need to be thinking about?

2257
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:30,000
We're thinking about the Outback right now, those horrific wildfires that are going on

2258
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:31,000
all over Australia.

2259
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Like, it is bad, you guys.

2260
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:38,000
So 100% of the net proceeds from Activision's Outback pack.

2261
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
So that's kind of neat.

2262
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:41,000
Yeah, that's neat.

2263
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
Yeah, especially for such a cause that's so...

2264
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:44,000
Ugh.

2265
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
Hoping all my friends down there are safe.

2266
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:50,000
Another thing that was shown off at CES this year was some new PCs by Origin.

2267
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:57,000
And so what makes these kind of unique is they, this is kind of a following up their

2268
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
PC called the Big O.

2269
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:05,000
So it's basically a computer and console built into one tower.

2270
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:12,000
So you have the PlayStation 4 Pro and then the Xbox One's sad.

2271
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:15,000
Is it guaranteed to give you a Big O?

2272
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:16,000
Maybe.

2273
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
No, but it's actually got some pretty cool stuff.

2274
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:22,000
So they have, not only on the PC side do they have an actual PC and everything, but they

2275
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
also have a capture card.

2276
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:31,000
So you can stream your console games and capture with one box, which is kind of cool.

2277
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
The problem is, though, is the price is pretty expensive.

2278
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:39,000
So you've got, it's $2,500 is what it starts at.

2279
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Alright.

2280
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:41,000
That's neat, I guess.

2281
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:42,000
Alright.

2282
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:45,000
Well, no calls are waiting to come in and that's okay because we've run a little long

2283
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:46,000
tonight.

2284
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:47,000
What a shock.

2285
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:50,000
So I think we're getting ready to wrap up shop here tonight.

2286
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:54,000
Thank you guys, of course, for tuning in tonight, staying up late with us.

2287
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:57,000
And if you're listening on the podcast feed, hey, you are wonderful too.

2288
02:40:57,000 --> 02:41:00,000
I do want to remind everybody, no show next week.

2289
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:01,000
We're not even going to tape something in advance.

2290
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
We're giving ourselves a week off.

2291
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:09,000
And I think, I don't want to sound cocky or egotistical, but I think we deserve it.

2292
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
We worked through the holidays.

2293
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:12,000
We had a show every week during the holidays.

2294
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:16,000
So we're going to take our holiday a little late this year.

2295
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:19,000
But excuse me, sorry, popcorn kernel.

2296
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:23,000
But speaking of holiday, let's not forget Martin Luther King Jr.

2297
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:26,000
because we're getting a long weekend because of that.

2298
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:30,000
So just, you know, you might want to take a minute to just kind of reflect on what the

2299
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:35,000
things he had to say might mean for you and what you can do to help live out that dream.

2300
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:40,000
But we'll be back to do that again in two weeks or to do our show again in two weeks.

2301
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:45,000
And I'm hoping, I don't want to over promise and deliver, but I'm hoping we're going to

2302
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:52,000
have some fun little changes in the next couple of weeks and really bring OLR into 2020.

2303
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:55,000
So Orange Laundry, Orange Laundry for a new decade.

2304
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:59,000
Well, it took us how long to get out of 1995?

2305
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:00,000
What year is it?

2306
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:03,000
It's not 1995 still.

2307
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:06,000
Of course, everyone knows I'm talking about the computer.

2308
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:07,000
All right.

2309
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
Yeah, well, oh, this computer?

2310
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:10,000
The last one.

2311
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:11,000
It's on XP.

2312
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:12,000
Oh, XP.

2313
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:13,000
Yeah.

2314
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
So out of 2002.

2315
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Yeah.

2316
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:17,000
Yeah.

2317
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:18,000
All right.

2318
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:21,000
So we will not be back next week, but we will be back in two weeks.

2319
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
And we look forward to seeing you all then.

2320
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:24,000
So you know what that means?

2321
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:27,000
This week, gaming news is going to blow the fuck up.

2322
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
So hold on and look out, everybody.

2323
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
Hold on to your pants.

2324
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:35,000
But we hope everybody has a good week and happy gaming and all that good stuff.

2325
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
If you liked what you heard here at Orange Laundry Radio, tell a friend about the show

2326
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2327
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:43,000
But if the voices aren't here to put on air, then we're stuck.

2328
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:48,000
So get more people and a nice five star review on a site like iTunes goes an awful long way.

2329
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
And we really appreciate it.

2330
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:54,000
So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts and check on out of here.

2331
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
So Dark Soccer, I know you're ready for a nap.

2332
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
So I am super freaking tired.

2333
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:01,000
Like it's just with everything going on.

2334
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
I have to go back to work tomorrow.

2335
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
Real life is happening again.

2336
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
Just oh, my God, I'm tired.

2337
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:08,000
Fair enough.

2338
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
Do you have an official final thought or?

2339
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:11,000
Oh, my God, I'm tired.

2340
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:12,000
OK.

2341
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:15,000
My final thought tonight is kettle corn.

2342
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
Yum. Thanks, Dark Soccer.

2343
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
I'm glad I didn't get all stuck in my teeth.

2344
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:20,000
That's why I always don't like eating.

2345
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
I had to pick a half a kernel out of my gums, though.

2346
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
That was freaking weird.

2347
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
It's like the tooth armor no one wants.

2348
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:29,000
I almost always, always have to like after eating popcorn,

2349
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:34,000
like go get my vibrating toothbrush and get everything out of there or actually pleasure your mouth.

2350
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:35,000
The vibe.

2351
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:40,000
I will tell you what has changed my life in that regard is, though, the water pick that shoots the water.

2352
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
But nothing gets stuck.

2353
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
So I just use those little flossers.

2354
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
You know, a lot of people do that, too.

2355
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Last but not least, Loki, your final thought.

2356
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:51,000
I can't wait to get my rollerblades this week.

2357
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:56,000
I ordered. OK, so like I ordered about nineteen ninety five.

2358
02:43:56,000 --> 02:44:03,000
Well, I wanted my kids got skates, so I wanted to get new new blades in because I used to.

2359
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:07,000
Technically, it's in landscape, so whatever.

2360
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:12,000
So I used to rollerblade a ton when I was, you know, in high school and all that.

2361
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
And I still do pretty well with it.

2362
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:19,000
So I decided to get a fancy pair of skates from France.

2363
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:29,000
And they're only sold they don't sell them here because like people that take rollerblading seriously.

2364
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
Not in this country.

2365
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:36,000
So I had to import it from Canada and they only come in European sizes.

2366
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:42,000
So my dumb ass decided to try to measure my foot correctly and ordered them.

2367
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
And I did.

2368
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:47,000
And I even increased the size and they were too small.

2369
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:50,000
And then I looked at my shoe and I'm like, son of a bitch.

2370
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
There's European sizes in my shoe.

2371
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:56,000
I could have ordered the fucking correct size in the first place.

2372
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:57,000
So I had to do all that crap.

2373
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:58,000
At least they were pretty good.

2374
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:01,000
They shipped it back for free.

2375
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
They cross shipped the other one.

2376
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:04,000
So I'll get them this week.

2377
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:05,000
But I was so disappointed.

2378
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
I want to go bleeding this weekend.

2379
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:10,000
Be curious to get my Vibrams.

2380
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:13,000
Have a good time at the broccoli farm.

2381
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
Have a good time in San Francisco.

2382
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
And I will have a good time at the musical.

2383
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:18,000
So everybody have a good time.

2384
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
You have a good time out there.

2385
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:23,000
No matter what it is you're doing this week, even if you're just sitting on your butt playing games all week.

2386
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
I hope those games are awesome.

2387
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:28,000
We will see you in 14 days to do this all over again.

2388
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
Until then, have a great week everybody.

2389
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:31,000
Good night.

2390
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:59,000
But you know they were all still true.

2391
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
See you next week.

2392
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:28,000
Thank you.
