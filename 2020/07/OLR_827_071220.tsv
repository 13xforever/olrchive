0	13720	This week, we're reminded that the larger sums of money don't prevent problems from
13720	14720	happening.
14720	18440	The MMO New Earth has been delayed from this autumn until next spring, at least.
18440	22640	Amazon Gaming has now encountered at least two setbacks for New Earth, one for unforeseeable
22640	27520	reasons, along with the critically muted reaction to its hero arena shooter, Crucible.
27520	31440	No success is guaranteed, but that shouldn't stop you from trying, much like our hosts
31440	35920	Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki, who continue to press on with the show where every
35920	37920	gamer has a voice.
37920	47440	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
47440	49480	where every gamer has a voice.
49480	55880	It is Orange Lounge Radio Live yet again tonight with another week of our show.
55880	61480	It is episode number 827 for this July 12th of 2020.
61480	67000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you live here from our recording studio that we used to
67000	68160	do for many years.
68160	71760	We would meet live in person here in this studio, but due to the current state of the
71760	76680	world, we're separated a little bit and saying hello through the magic of Discord.
76680	81800	Joining me, Rob, here in studio is DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
81800	84080	Greetings and salivations.
84080	85080	Welcome back.
85080	86080	Thank you so much for joining us this week.
86080	87080	What did you throw?
87080	89320	Yeah, I was going to say my aim is steadily improving.
89320	91080	I'm trying, but yeah.
91080	93800	So hopefully, I hope you're doing well.
93800	94800	Hanging in there?
94800	95800	I'm doing alright.
95800	98800	I'm definitely better than last week.
98800	99800	Good.
99800	102480	There's just some stuff going on.
102480	104200	We've all got stuff.
104200	105920	I understand.
105920	109920	As I was saying to somebody the other day, it's been a hell of a year today.
109920	113680	I'll go ahead and be honest with it.
113680	118880	My mom is sick with COVID symptoms, and she got tested on Thursday last week, and we don't
118880	120880	find out for a few more days.
120880	128260	So yeah, so kind of fun coming two months after my dad dies.
128260	134680	Of course, I've been worried and stressed out, but mom is full of spite as ever.
134680	137520	It's where you get it.
137520	138520	In all seriousness.
138520	140700	I expanded on that.
140700	145580	In all seriousness, obviously, fingers and toes crossed, and just hoping for all the
145580	147820	best with your mom.
147820	152200	If it is that, then hopefully the symptoms don't get any worse.
152200	155540	I can cross all that, but if I cross my eyes, they'll get stuck that way.
155540	156980	Mama said so.
156980	161580	Alright, well, we can actually see, thanks to the magic of Discord, if his eyes are stuck,
161580	162580	say hello to Tech...
162580	164460	I wore makeup.
164460	166580	Your face is beat very well tonight, Darzakra.
166580	167580	Too bad the...
167580	169700	Yeah, doing that daytime drag.
169700	170700	Your eyes look great.
170700	174060	Too bad the podcasties can't appreciate it, but that's alright.
174060	181180	More incentive to tune in live every Sunday night at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, where we tape
181180	185500	right after the Bobby Blackwell show, twitch.tv slash vog network, and of course you can join
185500	189160	us in our chat room at twitch.tv slash vog network if you want to chat along with the
189160	190160	show.
190160	194020	I'll say hello to you guys in a minute, but I have to say hello to Techmaster Loki, also
194020	195020	on Discord.
195020	196020	Hello.
196020	197020	Hi, Loki.
197020	198140	How are you?
198140	199140	I'm pretty good.
199580	200580	Awesome.
200580	203140	I'm excited to talk about your background video, but obviously we have a little ways
203140	207100	in the show to get to before we can, but yeah.
207100	209220	I'm sure some folks recognize what it is.
209220	211380	I always pick something that's appropriate for...
211380	215020	Well, unless I can't think of anything appropriate to what we're talking about.
215020	216020	Fair enough.
216020	219740	I have to decide, because I've mentioned this on the show before, it's inevitable that the
219740	225300	studio is going to change again at some point, and obviously someday, fingers and toes crossed,
225300	227580	I'd love for us all to be back in person.
227580	231340	But I'm kind of wondering if maybe in the new studio, I won't just have a giant green
231340	237620	screen in the background so we can just, you know, put in whatever we want, which I think
237620	238620	would be fun.
238620	239620	Yeah.
239620	244700	It would be like those old clips from the 90s of Conan O'Brien taking the desk out for
244700	245700	a drive.
245700	247260	I don't know if you remember those segments from the...
247260	248260	Yes, I remember that.
248260	249500	It might be dating a little bit.
249500	250500	I don't know.
250500	251500	All right.
251500	254820	Let's get into some of the news, gaming news.
254860	258460	For our kickoff topic tonight, we've had some very big press conferences.
258460	261300	Well, I don't know if you'd call them press conferences.
261300	262300	They were more like...
262300	263300	Directs, I guess.
263300	264300	Yeah.
264300	266860	Direct updates to the peoples from two companies this week.
266860	270740	We had Ubisoft, Devolver Digital, and Loki.
270740	274100	Tell us a little bit about what we learned about.
274100	281580	So if you haven't watched the Devolver Digital Direct or show or presentation in the last
281580	284220	few years, you're really missing out.
284220	290100	They are unique, to say the least, and there's this ongoing storyline that goes from each
290100	293100	one.
293100	294140	It's just bonkers.
294140	300740	But they did show a few different games that are going to be coming out pretty soon.
300740	304140	So Shadow Warrior 3 was one that looked pretty awesome.
304140	310140	Kind of resembling more like the new Doom Eternal games versus the old Shadow Warrior
310140	311140	stuff.
311140	314140	A game called Fall Guys looks pretty fun.
314140	318140	Carry On, which I swear was already out, but I think that now maybe it's coming out the
318140	321140	consoles.
321140	325140	And this one game, I guess, is called Alesia.
325140	326140	Alesia.
326140	327140	And that looked pretty cool.
327140	332140	And of course, more footage of Serious Sam 4, which had been talked about before.
332140	338140	But the thing that's in my background and another thing that they announced as well
338580	341420	was this Devolverland Expo.
341420	344540	And what it is, it's a free game you can get on Steam.
344540	349940	And it's a game, and it's also a bunch of their trailers and stuff like that.
349940	356260	And so it's a perfect Devolver Digital thing that you really should go check out.
356260	357340	It's a pretty decent game.
357340	359100	So go check it out.
359100	363460	It's like breaking into the E3 Expo.
363460	367460	I mean, they've modeled it after the Los Angeles Expo Center there.
368460	371460	So it's fun, and it's free.
371460	377460	Interestingly enough, Loki, I don't always get the hype around the Devolver stuff.
377460	380460	I get that it's cute and it's funny and so forth.
380460	385460	But I thought that this Expo thing that they put out, the Devolverland Expo, is that the
385460	386460	official name of it?
386460	387460	Devolverland Expo?
387460	388460	I don't know.
388460	389460	That's the name of the game.
389460	396460	I thought, I feel like it's really clever and very unexpected.
396460	400460	And I downloaded it, and I've actually played a little bit of it.
400460	407460	And I was really kind of blown away uncannily how it is the Los Angeles Convention Center,
407460	408460	no doubt.
408460	411460	Like, when you start, you're walking right into it.
411460	415460	And I remember, it's been a few years now, but I remember going through those doors.
415460	420460	Now, obviously, things didn't look so dreary and bio-shocky like they do in that particular demo.
420460	424460	But you go through the doors, and it's like, oh, I remember this lobby.
424460	428460	And I just instinctively was like, well, registration was over here.
428460	433460	And you go around to the left, and there's a place where you get like a t-shirt gun.
433460	438460	And that's what, spoiler alert, that's what you can use against some of the sentries that are in there and so forth.
438460	444460	So it's an interesting little like, but once you finally get into the South Hall, then it's like, okay,
444460	446460	this is a little different.
446460	449460	Like, it would never have been this crazy in here.
449460	453460	But yeah, it was neat.
453460	456460	I think that is a very clever little thing.
456460	459460	And it actually had me doing some exploring.
459460	464460	I watched one of the trailers for that Carrion, was that the name?
464460	465460	Yeah, Carrion.
465460	470460	Okay, so I was watching that, and you collect these little pieces,
470460	474460	and I guess you can get unannounced game trailers, too.
474460	476460	So you can actually get like bonus stuff.
476460	482460	Although, I was told if you just go into your Steam library and actually go to where the application is,
482460	483460	all the videos are right there.
483460	485460	So you can just spoiler alert yourself if you want.
485460	486460	It's fun.
486460	490460	Well, the other thing, too, which folks didn't notice right away,
490460	495460	but the trailer for the actual game, Devolverland Expo, had Steam keys hidden in it
495460	497460	for some of the games that were in there.
497460	499460	So it was kind of neat.
499460	507460	I was going to say, though, one of the other things about that,
508460	510460	yeah, it's just bonkers.
510460	514460	You really need to check out the whole direct, if you will.
514460	517460	I mean, it's poking fun, obviously, that all the directs,
517460	524460	and they tout the game as it's a first-person marketing simulator, which is kind of silly.
524460	528460	But yeah, it's pretty cool.
528460	535460	So aside from Devolver Digital, the other thing that happened earlier today was Ubisoft.
535460	541460	So Ubisoft had their kind of Ubisoft Forward event
541460	545460	that showed some more footage of some of these games that had already been announced.
545460	551460	So we had more footage for the Assassin's Creed Valhalla.
551460	559460	We had a pretty lengthy thing for Watchdog Legends, which looks interesting.
559460	567460	There was more stuff for, I think they were talking a little bit about Ghost Recon and Breakpoint.
567460	578460	I'm surprised we still haven't seen anything for the, oh god, I don't remember the series now.
578460	581460	Anyways, there was Elite Squad that they were showing off,
581460	585460	which is kind of a weird stylized version of, I guess, the Tom Clancy universe,
585460	592460	which, I gotta be honest, looks a whole hell of a lot like Agents of Mayhem, and not in a good way.
592460	598460	There's Hyperscape, which is their battle royale game, which I think is already out now.
598460	602460	They showed a little bit of Brawlhalla getting cross-play and stuff.
602460	607460	I think Hyperscape is in an open beta now, because it was already in a
607460	611460	get an invite on Twitch by watching streams sort of thing.
611460	615460	I don't usually super get into a lot of the battle royale games,
615460	618460	just because there's a lot of toxic communities out there with battle royale games.
618460	622460	But I'm curious a little bit about Hyperscape,
622460	626460	because it's got a little bit of that crazy crackdown bit to it,
626460	630460	because there's anti-gravity and you can jump super high and silly things.
630460	632460	Yeah, it looks interesting.
632460	635460	And then they finished off with a trailer for Far Cry 6,
635460	641460	which that announcement was leaked earlier when it showed up on some of the online storefronts.
641460	649460	And then, of course, there's speculation that the kid in this game
649460	655460	is a child version of Vos, who was in Far Cry 3.
655460	661460	His name's Diego in this game, but, I mean, maybe he changes his name. Who knows?
661460	666460	But it looks interesting. It's supposed to take place in Cuba or something like that.
666460	668460	So, pretty cool.
668460	672460	So not really a lot of big surprises, though, if I'm not mistaken, though, right?
672460	676460	Like, we knew about Assassin's Creed. We knew, I mean, Far Cry 6, I guess, is a surprise.
676460	678460	But is it?
678460	682460	No, I guess not. But it looks interesting.
682460	686460	I was going to say that we didn't see any Beyond Good and Evil 2,
686460	690460	but they did promise, much like Microsoft did, I'm not sure about EA,
690460	694460	that there's going to be yet another Ubisoft 4 later on in the summer,
694460	697460	and they're going to show off more of that stuff around then,
697460	700460	so we may see some more of that stuff poke up there.
700460	703460	But, I mean, it's neat.
703460	708460	Like, Watch Dogs Legion, it's a game that I'm interested in,
708460	710460	but at the same time, I know how I am with games,
710460	713460	and Watch Dogs 2 I was pretty excited for,
713460	717460	and I played it for a few hours and then went on to something else,
717460	720460	and I'm worried that that's going to be the same thing happening here,
720460	723460	but it looks cool. I mean, so I'll give them that.
723460	727460	Let's get some comments from our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
727460	730460	QuestBuster says, Far Cry 6 is going to be interesting.
730460	734460	Another open world sandbox. Yay. I love my open world sandbox games.
734460	739460	There's a lot of people that do, and there's some people that you kind of get annoyed with it,
739460	744460	but that's okay. Different games, I mean, there's literally, like, a million games to play online,
744460	746460	so pick what works for you.
746460	750460	Dark Dead Studio says, Far Cry 6 leaked on PSN, I heard.
750460	753460	I believe, yes, I heard that same rumor, what have you,
753460	758460	that one of the overseas stores put the artwork up early.
758460	763460	Probably one of those things where it was probably dated for tomorrow,
763460	768460	but because tomorrow in Asia is today, if that makes an international dateline play there,
768460	771460	it may have triggered early or something like that. I don't know, I'm just theorizing.
771460	775460	I don't know if they really explained why it happened, but that's just a theory.
775460	782460	And let's see, Phoenix7726 says, I keep wondering when we're going to get a modern Assassin's Creed,
782460	784460	and the answer is likely never.
784460	788460	Well, I mean, on one hand it seems a little bit out of character for Assassin's Creed,
788460	795460	but on the other, I mean, would like an Assassin's Creed in the future be something like,
795460	799460	I don't know, I think like a Matrix-y style thing, is that something that could ever happen?
799460	801460	Or is that just Watch Dogs?
801460	804460	Well, the whole Assassin's Creed thing I think is supposed to have some,
804460	807460	I don't know the entire storyline for Assassin's Creed,
807460	813460	but I know that there is a future element to it because you're exploring memories
813460	817460	of like one of the descendants of all these assassins,
817460	819460	and that's how you're kind of replaying all this stuff.
819460	824460	And there is like a modern day story part to it that's going from game to game,
824460	829460	but like I said, I never really got past Assassin's Creed 1 as far as holding my attention.
829460	832460	So I don't know what the storyline is,
832460	836460	and I know they made a really terrible movie that's based on Assassin's Creed
836460	839460	that we all like to forget about, but it's out there.
839460	843460	So I don't know. I don't know what exactly the storyline is,
843460	848460	but I do know that there is something that does take place like in the future.
848460	850460	I don't know what it's building up to,
850460	854460	but right now it's just an excuse to be able to go to the different timelines and do all this stuff.
854460	858460	Yeah, and Quest Buster is kind of filling in on that too.
858460	863460	Ass Creed has a modern component that briefly explores that side of the narrative,
863460	865460	but it feels mostly like an appendage at this point.
865460	867460	And that's kind of what I like because I remember playing,
867460	871460	I've played the games a little bit, and I remember it like especially in the first, the early games,
871460	874460	they like remastered the early games, and I think that's the one I played.
874460	877460	And I remember it kind of like explains it a little bit,
877460	881460	but it's very much like this is not the point of the game.
882460	884460	Maybe it's like, you know what I mean.
884460	886460	It's kind of one of those things, you're in it for like 30 seconds,
886460	889460	then you're not really thinking about that part anymore, if that makes sense.
889460	890460	Yeah.
892460	895460	Let's see. And then also, VGRealness in chat says,
895460	898460	Watch Dogs fills the void of future Assassin's Creed.
898460	900460	Yeah, I suppose.
900460	903460	And I guess maybe like your modern Assassin's Creed as well.
903460	908460	Assassin's Creed is one of those things I think is always going to be a little bit historical,
908460	913460	especially when we've seen these modes like in the recent one,
913460	917460	was Odyssey had that whole little like history adventure mode, right?
917460	919460	And there was the one before it had it too, right?
919460	921460	Where it's like, this isn't really the game,
921460	923460	but you can explore and actually learn about history
923460	927460	because we went so far as to render all these historical things.
927460	929460	Why not put this in here as like a learning thing too?
929460	933460	And I imagine this new one's going to have something like that too, just because.
933460	940460	I guess. I mean, I want to say, though, like, I don't remember which game it was,
940460	945460	but I thought that there was one of the games that they had that you were,
945460	949460	they wanted like, they were touting its historic accuracy,
949460	954460	and then they had you fighting like Greek gods or something like that.
954460	956460	I don't want to say it's like something ridiculous like that,
956460	961460	but I think that, I don't remember which Assassin's Creed that was,
961460	964460	but like I said, not a franchise I'm into, but it looks cool.
964460	970460	And I don't know, Watch Dogs, more my cup of tea, and Far Cry.
970460	976460	Although once again, Far Cry, I played a little bit of Five and never finished it.
976460	980460	But most importantly, and I'll admit I missed the thing
980460	982460	because I've been dealing with some other personal stuff this weekend,
982460	986460	but was there a new trailer for a new Just Dance?
986460	990460	Not that I saw. I missed about a minute of it.
990460	994460	And so they did not have Just Dance.
994460	995460	Well, that's upsetting.
995460	1000460	We don't have enough time for all of the nonsense that they would pull off for that.
1000460	1004460	So no Just Dance this time. Maybe they'll kick off the next one.
1004460	1007460	But yeah, I mean, I'm all right.
1007460	1011460	I think there's a random aside, but I think there's a huge sale on PlayStation.
1011460	1013460	It seems like they always have some type of sale going on,
1013460	1015460	like they're just rotating them in week after week right now.
1015460	1019460	Well, they were giving away Watch Dogs 2 on PC for free.
1019460	1022460	I couldn't log into my Ubisoft account. Surprise.
1022460	1023460	Oh, no.
1023460	1027460	So they are like I remember my password and everything,
1027460	1032460	but I tried resetting it because for whatever reason it wasn't working
1032460	1036460	and I never got an email to reset it. So I was locked out.
1036460	1040460	I was going to say with the PlayStation sale, the latest Just Dance, like 2020,
1040460	1043460	is down to like 15 bucks or something like that.
1043460	1046460	And I was tempted. I'll tell you, I was tempted to pick it up.
1046460	1048460	I have no idea how those games control anymore.
1048460	1051460	Like, do they use the camera? Do they use the controller?
1051460	1053460	I heard there's I think maybe an iPhone app.
1053460	1054460	I think it's the phone.
1054460	1055460	Yeah, I think that makes sense.
1055460	1059460	I think it's your phone now.
1059460	1062460	I don't think that they use the camera anymore.
1062460	1065460	Oh, Bobby Blackwolf confirms they use your mobile phone,
1065460	1069460	which makes sense because mobile phones are like the universal controller these days.
1069460	1072460	You know, don't you guys have phones?
1072460	1075460	I just want to bust out DDR.
1075460	1076460	It works for Jackbox.
1076460	1080460	I wish I would love a modern like DDR game,
1080460	1083460	like DDR Ace or something on PlayStation four or five.
1083460	1086460	I'd live for that. I would be so happy.
1086460	1088460	I don't know why they won't do it.
1088460	1091460	Like Konami just doesn't see the money in it or something like I,
1091460	1095460	I would be so thrilled when make money off of it.
1095460	1097460	It's very niche for them.
1097460	1100460	They're going to make Apache slot.
1100460	1103460	I wish they would just release the PC versions as the software runs on PC.
1103460	1105460	Anyways, it wouldn't be that difficult.
1105460	1109460	I mean, I know it's not difficult to port it because if you know where the look,
1109460	1111460	you can get it to run on your PC.
1111460	1119460	So I don't understand why they don't do something like that and have songs available or I don't know.
1119460	1121460	I mean, I guess they're trying to do that with that.
1121460	1129460	What was the one S or I don't remember the one that they had online recently that was running in unity that we tried it.
1129460	1130460	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1130460	1131460	It was real quick.
1131460	1134460	That just means they need to bust out the Dreamcast.
1135460	1137460	Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
1137460	1139460	You have to stick to the oldies.
1139460	1140460	I guess this is what it is.
1140460	1147460	I guess maybe they feel dance games have to have these camera and full body motion things
1147460	1152460	because we've kind of lived through the era of Kinect and things like Dance Central
1152460	1156460	and that now that like maybe a dance pad alone isn't good enough.
1156460	1158460	I'm using my quoting fingers, good enough.
1158460	1165460	When I I don't know, like I feel like DDR, there's still there are all these new kids playing DDR at the arcade now.
1165460	1166460	And I don't I don't recognize them.
1166460	1170460	There's a whole new DDR community, even though like DDR freak isn't really around anymore.
1170460	1174460	But they're they're forming around things like Facebook and Twitter and so forth.
1174460	1182460	I believe there are music game podcasts that which is really ironic because that's where we started.
1182460	1183460	But there's a whole new class.
1183460	1186460	There's like a new class of like music gaming podcast.
1186460	1190460	And we don't you know, we don't follow that stuff as closely anymore.
1190460	1198460	But the reason why I bring all that up is that I feel like there is a whole new fandom for those types of games.
1198460	1203460	And I think, you know, if they were to just try to do a DDR on PlayStation four or five,
1203460	1208460	it would be not just something for the old fans like us, but the new fans as well.
1208460	1209460	I really wish they'd give it a shot.
1209460	1214460	But I can understand that there's a risk when it comes with like the peripherals.
1214460	1218460	So maybe they need to focus on something that's a little more like a button music game.
1218460	1221460	And then it's like, oh, but you can use the peripheral as well.
1221460	1227460	I don't have all those peripherals that they'd made for the I mean, let's just here's how silly like their priorities are.
1227460	1231460	So like I understand that peripherals aren't necessarily high on their radar,
1231460	1235460	but at the same time, didn't they just have a whole bunch of peripherals for their mobile games?
1235460	1240460	I mean, like I can we repurpose some of that stuff?
1240460	1242460	Yeah, I don't know.
1242460	1248460	Anyway, I didn't mean to go on a dance game tangent by talking about just dance, but maybe I did a little bit.
1248460	1252460	I don't know. So well, there's going to be a lot of people who are happy about just dance stuff,
1252460	1258460	because I mean, especially with this going on with the pandemic, it's a good way to get some exercise.
1258460	1262460	I mean, honestly, an announcement about just dance is timely.
1262460	1266460	Yeah, actually, that's part of the reason when I saw the sale, I honestly considered getting it.
1266460	1269460	And I still might because I think the sale is on through Thursday or what have you.
1269460	1272460	And it's considering it. It's exactly for that.
1272460	1276460	I've been trying very hard to go outside and get exercise and go walking.
1276460	1279460	But the reality is, it was one hundred and five today here in SAC.
1279460	1283460	And so I'm like, yeah, I went out in it for 10 minutes.
1283460	1288460	Yikes. I don't know how hot it is in my garage in order to play DDR.
1288460	1291460	So like it's like one hundred and twenty degrees in there.
1291460	1297460	In the words in the words of the great Jasmine Masters. No, ma'am.
1297460	1306460	No. Oh, ma'am. Although I hurt my hip a few weeks ago and re sprained it tripping over the cat.
1306460	1315460	Going outside in the weather for just a little bit makes me understand why old people move to Arizona.
1315460	1322460	I was like, oh, it doesn't hurt for five seconds. Oh, it's hot.
1322460	1328460	Pele Hanumea in chat brings up Beat Saber and says Beat Saber type games are replacing them.
1328460	1333460	I mean, I think there's always going to be like that fresh new thing in any type of genre.
1333460	1340460	And music games are not immune to that either, because like there was DDR and then there was Guitar Hero.
1340460	1344460	Right. And Rock Band, the plastic instruments really dominated that conversation for a long time.
1344460	1350460	And you're right. You're right. A lot of the VR and music is Beat Saber is very strong in that department, too.
1350460	1352460	And I think because of Beat Saber's success,
1352460	1358460	you're even seeing non VR things that are trying to do the Beat Saber thing, even though Beat Saber is.
1358460	1364460	And that's another discussion. But I can kind of see that that every genre kind of has its you know,
1364460	1368460	this is the hot new thing in the genre right now. So.
1368460	1373460	Even when we were you know, we even when we were young kids right around the time this show started,
1373460	1379460	I feel like, you know, we were all playing DDR and then and then one day dark soccer,
1379460	1385460	because this was the day that you and I met one day Milpitas Golf Land got a paraparaparadise.
1385460	1388460	Yes. And we finally knew half the routine.
1388460	1393460	We had to go see it because it was like, but it's DDR, but it's like you're using your hands.
1393460	1398460	It's a new thing. It's crazy. Yeah, it's new. Exactly. It's new.
1398460	1406460	Anyway. All right. Well, we have the pink biscuits of doom collecting dust somewhere.
1406460	1411460	Oh, and not the knockoff green biscuits of doom that I think was the other game they put it on Dreamcast.
1411460	1416460	Some other company gets, I believe. Yeah. Anyway. All right.
1416460	1420460	I don't remember you having a bunch of weird stuff on Dreamcast, so. Yeah.
1420460	1427460	Anyway. OK, so that's that's that for Ubisoft to devolve for, even though it devolved into conversation on old school music games.
1427460	1432460	But hey, that's our audience. Right. And by the way, dark soccer, since I have to say it at some point,
1432460	1436460	while while Loki was trying to be serious and read the news there.
1436460	1443460	Thank you, Loki. You're in the background changing wigs and playing with our chat room and making all these faces.
1443460	1447460	You keep you keep doing like these all the like. Mm hmm.
1447460	1457460	I'm moving on to three because this one is my wigs have been disused because I'm not doing any cons or anything.
1457460	1463460	So and, you know, I'm not like going all out and wearing a wig cap and doing it right now that I'm not pinning it or anything.
1463460	1472460	I'm just going on the wig like this one. I still have yet to trim the lace on it just because this was going to be some work.
1473460	1478460	I don't have wigs. I just have hats. All right.
1478460	1483460	Anyway, also some stuff in chat talking about drop mix a little bit.
1483460	1488460	Bobby saying I enjoy drop mix and fuser is basically a digital version of drop mix.
1488460	1491460	Yeah. Yeah. Their other game that they have coming out. Yeah.
1491460	1495460	Miltonious Games in chat says, yeah, I like the music mixing of drop mix.
1495460	1498460	So just being able to do that without physical cards sounds good.
1498460	1503460	Yeah. I think there was fun just in like mixing stuff on that game.
1503460	1507460	So I'm excited. Is fuser out? I didn't think it was out yet. Right.
1507460	1510460	I think it's out yet. Yeah. Out soonish in the next couple of months.
1510460	1515460	So I'll check that out, though, because I do have a drop mix thing, but I've played it like twice.
1515460	1519460	I think it'll be fun to try the digital one, I think. All right.
1519460	1525460	Anyhow, let's move on and talk about the types of games that we have been playing this week in a segment called How Is Your Gaming Week?
1525460	1531460	Dark Sakura, how is your gaming week? I played something that was an animal crossing.
1531460	1535460	What? I didn't play a lot of Animal Crossing. OK.
1535460	1540460	But I want to start off with my little rant about Animal Crossing. OK. OK.
1540460	1545460	So we get to go swimming in the ocean. We can dive.
1545460	1551460	We can get pearls, you know, or can we because I haven't got one yet.
1551460	1557460	I have I have three. Wow. And one of them I got on my alt and you get Pascal.
1557460	1562460	And that was fun. I found out that if you talk to him like at the top of above your island,
1562460	1568460	you can actually watch him swim off into the distance and watch him eat the the scallop that he begged you for.
1568460	1573460	Oh, I've seen him. I've seen him like go off, but I've never seen him actually eat the scallop.
1573460	1578460	That's cute. I had to. I tried to get some shots of it earlier, but it didn't quite work out.
1578460	1584460	So. But and this is a big mix a lot size sitting on a butt.
1584460	1592460	But OK. You can dive off the pier and people like, OK, that's pretty cool.
1592460	1605460	But not people who do lots and lots of trading where you have strangers come into your town who think they can run over your flowers and cut all your fruit and dig up your plant.
1605460	1613460	Well, I mean, I guess I can't really dig up your plants if they're not besties, but it's like a lot of people take a lot of pride in their little towns.
1613460	1618460	I take pride in my little town and my town is fucking adorable. Deal with it.
1618460	1629460	But like. You jump off and you can't block people out of running amok all over your town, you know, like it's just it's just not good.
1629460	1636460	And I found a place to leave feedback for Nintendo, so I'm going to do it. But like this shit don't fly.
1636460	1649460	I've heard this complaint on Twitter and social media. Some people are not happy about how the diving off the pier kind of leads to that sort of exploit, which I think Nintendo probably didn't think of because I don't know.
1649460	1656460	They did it on purpose. Maybe. Well, it's getting in the way of our intended vision for how you play the game.
1656460	1669460	Well, and that was a point that came up when I was talking about it with my friends is that is this Nintendo trying to take a little jab at some of the like the fact that, you know, we're inviting so many people online, especially with the turnip game.
1669460	1679460	Right. Like we've all any of us that have had spiked turnips probably had strangers on our island to help sell the turnips, whether it was like friend of a friend or, you know, through a community or something.
1679460	1687460	And maybe Nintendo's kind of trying to jab at that a little bit where it's like, you know, we really just want you to have people that like you actually know on your island.
1687460	1696460	But I at the same time, like I'm kind of like maybe that's Nintendo's perspective, but at the same time, I'm kind of like I think that's the fun of it is meeting people through this.
1696460	1707460	I think I don't think they just I don't think they anticipated that it would be used in that manner, to be honest, because there's a lot of design decisions that they made in there that doesn't seem to make any sense.
1707460	1715460	Like, for example, whoever whoever plays the game first is the mayor of the town, basically, and gets to make all the decisions where everybody else doesn't really get to do that.
1715460	1720460	And what with that? Well, I understand that. And that's what they probably thought.
1720460	1726460	Well, when most people are just complaining by themselves, it's fine. But I have a family and we all play on the switch.
1726460	1731460	And unfortunately, my youngest son is the one that played it first just by happenstance.
1731460	1737460	And so now he has to make all the decisions and it's really annoying.
1737460	1745460	Yeah. And so, like, you know, we can't progress or progress in the game because, like, he's got all of the decisions that need to be made.
1745460	1752460	And he doesn't like our current administration here in America.
1753460	1755460	You have a small child in charge.
1755460	1759460	Well, it's it's it's not as bad as that.
1759460	1765460	You know, the worst the worst thing we have going on is there's like waterfalls in some weird places now.
1765460	1769460	But, you know, other than that, it's it's been all right. Well, you can terraform to you.
1769460	1774460	You've got that power. So I'm not laughing because it's funny. I'm laughing because it's true.
1774460	1779460	I'm crying inside. But but at any rate, I wanted to address that.
1779460	1789460	And I mean, I also wonder if this might be Nintendo's way to sort of get past the people who are selling things for money, you know, like selling like charging.
1789460	1794460	And then you pay like certain miles tickets or something. And it's ridiculous.
1794460	1798460	And I whatever you know what I.
1798460	1809460	But there are people who are using it just to enhance their, you know, play their enjoyment of the game, who want to sell their turnips and want to trade items and catalog.
1809460	1813460	And I mean, but now, like I was I was veering out a little bit.
1813460	1818460	I was venturing. I was I was letting new people into town. And now I'm back on lockdown.
1818460	1826460	Now, people who come visit me are my friends. Fort Sakura is closed.
1826460	1830460	Well, and the other will call it's gone back to being a dream.
1830460	1841460	Spoilers, but you know, and there's a few people in in my Facebook group that I would let in just because I've seen them be good players.
1841460	1855460	I've gotten positive feedback on them. I've had them in the town before. I, I think they would be trustworthy, but I don't really go outside of that group anymore, except for maybe a few co workers because we have an Animal Crossing group at my work.
1855460	1864460	You know, though, he and you know the star sucker I kind of closed Facebook a couple weeks ago just because for my own reasons I'm just over Facebook.
1864460	1879460	But one thing I do kind of miss are those groups because I just had a villager move out two days ago Gigi left, and I was okay with her going because she was a duplicate type she already had a snooty type, but you know I have like maybe like one messenger group
1879460	1893460	that I can kind of send does anybody want Gigi and like literally nobody had an empty plot that day anyway. So it was kind of pointless I was like, well, I guess to the abyss she goes because I don't like it on a normal day I would have posted a group.
1893460	1897460	She'll go into a pool I think of your for your last 10 visitors.
1897460	1906460	Oh, interesting. Okay, so if someone gets an opening there's a chance that she might show up at the campsite or on another island. Hmm. Okay.
1906460	1920460	I believe that's how it works. I have heard that villagers will move and say they're from another place. If you don't recruit somebody I recruited a normal type to replace her because that's the one thing I needed.
1920460	1933460	Yeah, I'm going to be since I've got, I think, all of the DIY is from the villagers that I'm going to, I don't have to have the different types now in my town so I'm going to be.
1933460	1941460	I already promised him to Gwen, but when it's going to get my Octavian when I bring in either Bruce or Marshall, I haven't decided.
1941460	1953460	Do you know who Alan let go this week and I couldn't believe it. Marina, Marina, I can't believe Oh yeah that's right. He, he still has, he still has Facebook so he probably Oh yeah I think he gave, I think he did give her away.
1953460	1955460	I think so I think somebody got her.
1955460	1967460	So she didn't go I was, I was so close to trying, I didn't have an opening but I would have loved to have claimed Marina, because I have the other two octopus octopi.
1967460	1976460	Because I have sucker and Octavian and we're never getting rid of sucker, because he's my special child. Yeah, I will I will never let catch up leave on my own.
1976460	1979460	Julian go because I have his card.
1979460	1994460	And, you know, sometimes the queen needs to move and Julian being my unicorn drag queen. Sometimes she needs to just feel her oats, how, how do you get okay so like I know if you work on your friendship and you give a lot of random gifts.
1994460	2007460	You are actually like I use the app to show like what gifts somebody really prefers. So I tried to do that and and eventually catch up gave me a photo of herself and I love that and from what I understand, that's like the ultimate prize from a villager
2007460	2011460	right like if they, if they give you a photo, that's it, you've done it you've maxed everything out.
2011460	2020460	So now I'm trying to okay so I'm trying to get others so I'm trying to get one from poncho, who's my little jock bear. And I think he's adorable.
2020460	2032460	And so I keep like every day, I give him a wrapped coconut, because I know if nothing else you get a decent amount of points from a wrapped coconut right, you get a decent amount of points from your wrapped native fruit.
2032460	2034460	Oh do you okay.
2034460	2050460	But my thing is that I like giving them close because I like to make them wear ridiculous stuff, I just make sure it's in their favorite color. Hmm. Okay, so for Agnes, she gets black and gray for Dina, she gets to wear a lot of plaid green, you know, I put her in the flannels
2050460	2054460	I put her in sportswear she's my lesbian.
2054460	2058460	I put Rosie and reds and pinks.
2058460	2070460	I put Julian and blues and purples. Right now he's wearing the vampire clothes and he loves the hell out of that. Roscoe gets mostly black and red and it's all like punk kind of you know hardcore stuff.
2070460	2080460	I put kind of how that's how cherry cherry likes to dress that way to cherries like a hot topic worker. I had cherry in New Leaf.
2081460	2093460	I like cherry. Gotcha. But, you know, it's funny though I have a lot of my OG, you know, my original people, cherry would wear that wig you're wearing.
2093460	2102460	Well, it's gonna get changed after this segment but you know, I have actually a lot of my original characters except I have Dom and Dom is great.
2103460	2105460	He's my little wannabe fluffball buff guy.
2105460	2113460	I will tell you my newest villager so you know I went searching for a normal type and I just took the first one I found. Are you ready for the name of the villager I got?
2113460	2124460	I got Norma. Norma the normal. Norma the normal. She's a cow. She's cute. So, anyway.
2125460	2138460	Okay, and I think the internet just froze because I've completely lost the video connection and I'm really worried that it's going to drop completely here in a moment because, yeah, this is really not good.
2138460	2145460	So, I think what I'm going to do is, oh, I'm still on Twitch. It's just Discord that slowed down.
2145460	2154460	Okay, so apparently I've completely lost connection on Discord with my co-host. So, we're gonna just see what happens here.
2154460	2166460	Discord may have had a hiccup or something like that. Not sure. So, I would, yeah, Jamie's in a very stunning pose where she's frozen, isn't it?
2166460	2178460	Anyway, okay. So, I guess I don't have a choice for the moment. What should I do? I'm going to turn it off and turn it on and off again. Off and on again.
2178460	2186460	And see if that helps. So, let's see what happens if I'm going to disconnect from that. And then I'm going to try to reconnect to that and see if I get my co-host back.
2186460	2194460	And nope, I'm just getting the, oh, nope, nope. Oh, I might have got him back. How about that? Turning it off and on again fixed it. What's that?
2194460	2196460	I didn't have time to change my wig.
2196460	2202460	Oh, that's okay. It was a little unexpected hiccup there, but that's the perils of doing a live show. Okay, sorry.
2202460	2205460	I was saying that you stole Dina the first time at my GameCube village.
2205460	2210460	I did, I did. Sorry, it was a little awkward hiccup and I was talking about Norma the Normal, who's a cow.
2210460	2216460	Yeah. So, I was saying that since you stole Dina last time, you get first dibs on Dina this time.
2216460	2221460	Okay, yay. Now, you mentioned you played other stuff, yeah.
2221460	2227460	Yes, I got The Last of Us. I got the remastered one. I do want to play Last of Us 2.
2227460	2233460	So, I figured I should start at the beginning. That and a friend of mine has talked and talked and talked it up.
2233460	2240460	So, I was like, okay, I'm doing it. And I really enjoyed it. It's kind of, well, you know, I was having these problems with my hands.
2240460	2246460	And I do have a little bit of that problem again with holding a PlayStation controller for too long.
2246460	2251460	And the control scheme is one of those, every button does everything. The menus are weird.
2251460	2257460	So, it's a little bit of getting used to it. But yeah, I cried ugly in the first 10 minutes, you know.
2257460	2265460	So, I had myself a little silence up. And I really like it so far. The remastered one looks really good.
2265460	2270460	The voice acting is, is really good. And you know me, I'm piggy on voice acting.
2270460	2281460	So, I really, I'm really enjoying it so far. And then I'm still playing Words with Friends, because I'm kind of addicted and you know I'm a word nerd.
2281460	2296460	But there's like this mode in Words with Friends that like I really like. I think it's called like word circle, where you get like a set of letters, and you have to make, you know, as many different words out of it and they kind of are crossword style, right.
2296460	2309460	And I like that because I don't know what it is, I guess that Words with Friends thinks that people doing that mode. I have no vocabulary because I'm like, you got a hidden word, you got a hidden word, you got a hidden word.
2309460	2325460	I'm like, but I want the words out of the puzzle. You know, and so I actually found a game that is the same thing and like it's got ads so, but it's not as bad but it must think that that, you know, toddler because it's called Words with Friends.
2325460	2327460	I kind of enjoy it.
2327460	2336460	And I'm waiting to get more, more stuff in pattern, because I love pattern, and I'm very very sad that there are no more puzzles for me to do.
2336460	2343460	I'm back to playing like the mahjong puzzle games too because I can do it mindlessly while I'm doing other things.
2344460	2356460	Oh, oh, oh, and new acquisition of Bloodstained Curse of the Moon 2 which I know we're going to discuss in a bit. Dan is on it. He loves it.
2356460	2358460	I love Zangetsu.
2358460	2372460	I love how completely off like the, the other Bloodstained game that this is like every one of these Curse of the Moon ones both of these are like two different universes almost just with the same characters kind of au shenanigans.
2372460	2375460	But it's really cool the music's great.
2375460	2382460	Dan seems to really enjoy it I have other games to play and Dan is taking taking it over.
2382460	2393460	And sometimes it's really hard to play some games when we also have our more recent acquisition in pinball in the other room which is AC DC one of the limited editions.
2393460	2410460	And we are borrowing Guardians of the Galaxy right now so it's kind of annoying because I catch myself singing along with like the soundtrack as we're going along, and to the point where I've got stuck on a feeling on my head and repeat, and I sing it to the cat.
2410460	2412460	That's my gaming week.
2412460	2425460	Alright, nice. I will be very curious. I almost feel like you're just discovery path with the last of us is, you know, this is the type of thing we've done before like both you and I arrived to the Mass Effect series like we were very late to the party.
2425460	2427460	We were very fast.
2427460	2430460	We looked fierce in those wigs.
2430460	2441460	But we showed up late to the party and played the whole trilogy and it's like now we're in love with that. So I'm very curious, even though I don't see myself taking that same adventure through the last of us because I told you this before.
2441460	2449460	I don't think I'm okay with the level of violence in those games for me personally, you know, and again this is just a personal thing like again, I'm not saying they're bad games.
2449460	2456460	In fact, from everything I've heard about them and I have spoiled myself on the second one I'm not gonna be a jerk and say anything, but I know I'm not going to play us I kind of spoiled myself.
2456460	2473460	And after reading about it I was like, okay, I can see where that is really like that's like definitely thought provoking like it's definitely like a, and that's what really know what you're talking about it's about the don't spoil it for our listeners, but it's
2474460	2486460	the one thing that's got parts of the community up in arms. Yeah, it's an art should make you should be thought provoking so I think in that regard.
2486460	2494460	If, if art makes you go, or, you know, then it's not doing what it's supposed to art is supposed to be provocative. Yeah.
2494460	2497460	So, just like that way of Jamie's wearing.
2497460	2501460	Oh, hey, wait till you see the next one. It sucks.
2501460	2503460	All right, low key.
2503460	2506460	Low key. How was your gaming week.
2506460	2512460	So I did play a few things this week, mainly Minecraft is still.
2512460	2523460	I mean just still building more complex things. I dug out a third basement in the house so it's just massive I really need to do a video for it.
2523460	2535460	And then, aside from that Orna, and then I played a bit of the Devolver land Expo. And also I played a little bit of Animal Crossing.
2535460	2542460	I finally got my tent into a house. And that was about it.
2542460	2544460	That's it.
2544460	2546460	Yeah, that's it. All right.
2546460	2561460	Then let's talk about my gaming week and the types of games I've played this week, I played also Minecraft, that might shock you, but there was a there was a little I actually bought into one of those little ad ad things that was on my Xbox dashboard, because
2561460	2570460	I was in the game pass section and it said there was some new add on that was like a runner type thing and it kind of had like a futuristic look to it I was like oh is this like a chart everything.
2570460	2585460	So there's like a free custom game add on thing that they have. It's like and it's that's what it is an endless runner you're basically jumping over the things and collecting items and so forth, while the background is like slowly trying to catch up to you.
2586460	2600460	It's just really cool like I knew this was happening that people are building meta games in Minecraft, and that Minecraft in a way is almost its own game creation engine at this point too, but it's just it's neat to I admittedly have not played a lot of the products
2600460	2613460	that's come from that. So I like that Microsoft is kind of giving this one, a little boost by making it free obviously to check out, but also just kind of like showing us that hey look at the crazy things people are doing in Minecraft, because I did play it a few
2613460	2621460	months ago. I mean it's, yeah, it's not lots of you've played this game before it's nothing earth shattering but it was just kind of cool that was in Minecraft.
2621460	2635460	There's lots of like different little game modes and stuff that people make that are some of them can be pretty complex like they have sky block is a pretty popular game mode and they have a lot of these like infinite sky blocks and stuff that'll kind of keep the game
2636460	2657460	What I like about those is it kind of gives you more objectives to try to hit. I know in the Java version they've added more of these. It's not achievements, they call them like advancements, I guess, and it's like little mini goals to kind of keep you motivated in the game, even after you beat stuff.
2657460	2671460	And since they don't really have it yet in the pocket edition or bedrock. This is kind of cool. In the meantime, plus there's like lots of like unique game modes that you can play on all these different servers and stuff and that's all free.
2671460	2684460	But yeah, and myself like I've run add ons on my realm, and some I've even created from scratch so it's it's fun to be able to do that kind of stuff and modify the game to however you want.
2684460	2713460	So yeah, I love looking at that type of stuff on Minecraft that's that's been really fun and inventive. So I've been playing other stuff to the same old standbys like Orna, Pokemon Go. I've, I've oddly this week been playing probably more Ingress than I usually do like I've been going pretty hard this week and I'm sure the opposing team is like, what the hell has gotten into him? And the answer is quarantine has been a big part of that, because the nice thing about Ingress is either I'm playing outdoors like I'm walking in a big
2714460	2737460	park or going to take a portal outdoors, or I'm in my car. And both of those places are pretty safe. You know what I mean? So it's like, it's yeah, it's a fun and it's like a good excuse to get out of the house and like do something, you know, because it's like, we can't just, oh, go to the mall and just hang out. Well, I mean, I guess technically you can, but you know, do I want to do that right now? Not really.
2737460	2746460	Well, one of the things you're missing on Facebook is all the events for going to see movies, like drive in movies at the mall is the new thing that malls are doing, it seems like.
2746460	2761460	Well, hey, you know, I understand these are these are crazy ass fucking times and they've got to do what they've got to do to stay in business. And as long as it's being respectful of the things we need to do to stop COVID from spreading, which a drive in event is, then I'm living for it.
2761460	2773460	Honestly, I would give a lot to be able to go to like that drive in drag show. And I know Jamie's got to be thinking this, too. I think it's in Chicago or something. They're taking some drive in movie theater and turning it into a drag show.
2773460	2784460	They're going to have drag queens perform and then like show it on the movie screens as it's happening on this stage, like way down there. And I'm like, it's kind of kind of amazing, actually. So all right.
2784460	2797460	This wig needs some love. I just pulled it right out of the bag. V.G. realness and chat says, I'm loving the show within a show. Yeah, dark soccer's dark soccer's. Meanwhile, she's doing like a monologue called Wigs Upon Wigs over there.
2797460	2811460	Where she's number three. She's OK. No, it's not just that you're putting on wigs. It's that you keep doing these looks to the camera. You're like, I'm a model. Don't tell. I have a secret. I'm on a video game podcast.
2811460	2825460	But don't tell you like doing soccer is secret. And then you're like, I'm going to put this moment on Instagram over here. Yes, I am. Look, see, CJ is my favorite character in Animal Crossing. I wonder why.
2826460	2833460	Like it's not giving me like it's like they're together anyway. All right.
2833460	2838460	Anyway, other games that I've been playing this week besides those other usuals.
2838460	2848460	So Soul Calibur six is on Xbox Game Pass and I played it a little bit on PC, but I was like, I'm going to play it again now that it's on Xbox.
2848460	2854460	And it's really fun to get in there and design your own character. I think they did a good job with the single player campaign, too.
2854460	2861460	It kind of throws back a little bit to part two, honestly, for me, although I know all the Soul Calibur games have had like, you know, kind of like a mission mode.
2861460	2868460	But I'm for some reason reminded of part two. My only complaint about Soul Calibur six on Xbox. Holy shit.
2868460	2873460	The loading times. Holy shit. They're bad.
2873460	2880460	And maybe it's because I'm on an original Xbox, but I can and keep in mind it's on Game Pass, so it's all digital.
2880460	2886460	I can't imagine how bad it would be if I still had the disk. The disk must copy everything to the drive.
2886460	2891460	It's the only way it would work. But the loading times. Wow. They're they're bad. They're very noticeable.
2891460	2898460	Otherwise, it's a fun game. And I like they they do some like the supers from like Super Street Fighter four and stuff.
2898460	2902460	And it is really over the top stuff. So that's yeah, that's kind of fun.
2902460	2907460	Bobby Blackwell says all Xbox one and PS4 games copy the whole disk to the drive.
2907460	2916460	Yeah. I mean, I guess I thought there were some that would still retain like movies, but I guess that's more of a trick back from the PlayStation one and PlayStation two days.
2916460	2922460	So excuse me, but I have heard Blu-ray drives are notoriously slow.
2922460	2928460	That like doesn't totally surprise me. Anyway, other games I played this week.
2928460	2934460	So, OK, this is bad. I can't remember the name of this game, but it's also on Game Pass.
2934460	2937460	I'm hoping Loki or Dark Soccer. One of you guys knows this game.
2937460	2941460	I or or our chat. I think it's called Chrono World or something like that.
2941460	2946460	Maybe cross world. Somebody in channel. No, it's new. They just put it on Game Pass.
2946460	2951460	Is it cross code? Is that it? Cross code. OK.
2951460	2957460	OK. Sorry, it's cross code. OK. That yes, that is it. Maybe I'm thinking of the game within the game.
2957460	2964460	So the whole setup is that like and maybe this is like a spoilery type of thing, but not really, because I'm only like I just beat chapter two.
2964460	2966460	And this is something that comes up in chapter one.
2966460	2973460	But it's like you're a character in an MMO who's been like kicked out of the MMO, basically.
2973460	2981460	And now you exist like in the game master space and they go to put you back in the game.
2981460	2983460	And there's a whole nother plot, I'm sure. And it goes further.
2983460	2987460	But there's a whole game within a game type of element, like a dot hack or something.
2987460	2991460	You and while jail. Not really. Wow. Jail. But it's a ship.
2991460	2995460	You end up on a ship. But anyway, I'm actually really into it.
2995460	3001460	It's funny that I can't remember all these details because I am actually really into it because it really reminds me of like Zelda.
3001460	3010460	I would say like the action of a Zelda game meets the music of a Secret of Mana or Chrono Trigger type of game meets maybe that.
3010460	3018460	It's a really interesting little throwback to like all of those Super Nintendo RPGs, like all at once.
3018460	3022460	And I think it's kind of interesting. It has an interesting story.
3022460	3027460	Like I wasn't expecting some of those like, oh, this is kind of the direction it's going.
3027460	3030460	It's interesting. I like it.
3030460	3037460	Going in chat. As 200 Matt says, so Tron. I don't know. Maybe a little bit. A little bit Tron.
3037460	3041460	Like dot hack meets something else.
3041460	3049460	Yeah. Or that's what Sia Dabiri says. Dot hack meets Wreck-It Ralph. Yeah, there's that, too.
3049460	3057460	So, yeah, I'm into it. Yeah. And if you like those old Super Nintendo type of games, especially if you have Xbox Game Pass,
3057460	3061460	because I see Miltonius Games in chat says, I guess I'm downloading this. Interesting.
3061460	3065460	If you have Xbox Game Pass, by all means, get it, because it's good.
3065460	3069460	But it is also on Switch. And I think it's on all the consoles.
3069460	3077460	I don't see why it wouldn't be on PlayStation. So I would say, you know, I don't think it's probably an expensive game, maybe 15, 20 bucks.
3077460	3081460	And if you enjoy those Super Nintendo types of games, I'm sure this is going to be right up your alley.
3081460	3086460	So I would I would recommend it. So I'm hoping to play more of that. That's for sure.
3086460	3093460	Bobby says it was released on PC in 2019 and it's on PC Game Pass.
3093460	3097460	So somehow I just missed it on the PC version. I've been playing it on Xbox.
3097460	3104460	But whatever that happens sometimes, it's like, oh, I didn't know this game was on PC because I found it on my console first or vice versa.
3104460	3109460	So like that pinball game I played a few weeks ago was on, which is the one I said Dark Soccer should play.
3109460	3113460	It was on Xbox Game Pass that just totally remind me of like Devil's Crush.
3113460	3121460	I played that on PC first. But of course, it's on Xbox as well. So it just depends on, you know, where you like to get stuff.
3122460	3127460	If you're done with your gaming week, there's actually one other thing I forgot about. Yeah, go for it.
3127460	3135460	I'm going to be doing a charity stream in Sisterface because I'm going to be doing it, like I said, for charity through for we haven't decided on which one.
3135460	3142460	But on my Twitter at Dark Sakura, I have a pull up. It's up for the rest of the week.
3142460	3148460	I might extend it, but I want someone to help me pick the first of three games I'm going to start off with.
3148460	3155460	So it's either going to be Dream Daddy or Hot to Full Boyfriend or I Love You, Colonel Sanders.
3157460	3161460	I'm going to. That's a tough decision. Why not all three?
3161460	3165460	Because I can't play all three simultaneously. There's only one me.
3165460	3169460	Have you tried? I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.
3169460	3175460	It'd be like just like different recordings of me in different wigs, you know, all in the same Sisterface.
3175460	3180460	Yeah. But then you'll get to see my real drag. All right. Well, that'll be fun.
3180460	3185460	My real drag. Make sure you send me the details on when I can make sure we're hosting it here at VOG.
3185460	3189460	So I'm still working on on the on the details, but it's coming up.
3189460	3194460	I'm just right now gathering the stuff together. But you will see Dark Sakura.
3194460	3199460	You'll see the Kiki. Good times. All right. All right.
3199460	3203460	Well, that's it for our gaming weeks. We're going to get into some gaming news just real quickly.
3203460	3210460	First, I just want to put like a personal thing out there. And don't worry, this won't be as yelling as last week.
3210460	3221460	Although this says this has been a rough week. Those of you that follow me on Twitter know that my dad had an urgent situation on Friday morning and I had to go over to his house and call 911 on him.
3221460	3230460	And it turns out that he actually had a stroke. So I'm really glad that I did call 911 on him that because I actually I thought he had a concussion.
3230460	3234460	And I was like, well, he needs to be evaluated for this. And I don't I don't want to move him or whatever.
3234460	3240460	So luckily, even though I figured it was the wrong thing, it kind of led to all the right decisions.
3240460	3246460	So I'm thankful I got him in when he did, because it does seem like he will be OK.
3246460	3255460	He's going to need to go through some physical therapy and so forth. This whole thing's been very scary, but it could have been a lot worse if we'd let it go longer or what have you.
3255460	3261460	So anyway, my point is, I don't want to burden you too much with with sad news or what have you.
3261460	3270460	But I did want to just say thank you because I know a lot of you have said some very kind things on Twitter, as well as, you know, the Vogue Network Discord and places like that.
3270460	3277460	So I just want to take a minute to really thank you guys for the support and everything. And yeah, it means a lot.
3277460	3283460	So thank you very much. So. All right. We can go back to video games. Loki.
3283460	3288460	All right. So let's talk a little bit about Epic and Sony.
3288460	3295460	So Epic Games, of course, really big or trying to be big in the PC space.
3295460	3300460	And before you had a lot of money going into them from Tencent and whatnot.
3300460	3314460	But now we have Sony actually purchasing 250 million dollars of stake in the company and they're promising to, I guess, collaborate with them.
3314460	3329460	So throughout our investment, we explore opportunities for further collaboration with Epic to delight and bring value to consumers and the industry at large, not only in games, but also across rapidly evolving digital entertainment landscapes.
3330460	3348460	So I have no idea what that's supposed to mean as far as, you know, maybe exclusives for certain things, maybe with the trend of a lot of their PC titles coming to their PlayStation 4 titles coming to PC, that it'll continue going to epic first.
3348460	3353460	Well, something to think about, too. And Bobby talked a little bit about this on his show.
3353460	3358460	I'm going to get into that in a moment. But I'm certainly Sony is more than just a video game company.
3358460	3365460	Sony also is in the habit of doing, you know, music and movies and they're a multi type of entertainment company.
3365460	3371460	So and Bobby went into this on his show a little bit. So I'll kind of like defer you to check out his show.
3371460	3385460	And I'm not going to try to repeat it too much. But the gist of it is, if you look at the way some TV shows are made right now, it's not or not just TV shows, excuse me, but even some movies is that it's not necessarily just green screen.
3385460	3394460	But you can have the projection of the unreal or excuse me, the unreal. Yeah. Unreal engine only virtual sets. Exactly.
3394460	3402460	With the virtual sets and all of that. So if you think about it from that regard, because a lot of people are kind of joking, like, oh, 250 million.
3402460	3409460	How I mean, it doesn't take fortnight long to make that much money. But maybe I mean, sure. Sure. The game thing might be part of it. Who knows?
3409460	3423460	Maybe Sony's trying to buy some exclusives for fortnight. Who knows? But I think it would make a lot of sense, especially in the current state of the world with COVID and this whole thing being quite the uncertainty.
3423460	3428460	And we don't know how long it's going to be before maybe we can make movies the old fashioned way again.
3429460	3438460	It might make a lot of sense for Sony to be exploring these types of virtual filmmaking type of things to provide these different backgrounds.
3438460	3448460	And so that maybe it would take less people on a set. I mean, obviously, it would still take a lot of people designing it and doing the programming and so forth, but they wouldn't necessarily be on the set.
3448460	3462460	So it's a way to kind of do things a little more distant. So when you kind of pair those things against each other, like in a way to me, like it makes a lot of sense where a relationship like that could be really fruitful, not just necessarily gaming.
3462460	3464460	Yeah, I guess we'll have to see what they do with it.
3464460	3473460	Yeah. Questbuster in chat says, I mentioned this on Bobby's show, but it's interesting seeing how valuable Epic has become over the years.
3473460	3486460	$250 million from Sony bought them 1.4% stake in the company. $330 million back in 2012 from Tencent bought them 40%. Yeah, that's right. The cost has gone way, way up. That's for sure.
3486460	3497460	SG100Matt says, for movies and TV, everyone would just go to ILM for them to do everything that involves special effects, but that's Disney now. So not everyone wants to go Disney every time.
3497460	3512460	Yeah. So I think that could be an element of it is that it's not just necessarily Fortnite as much as it might be Epic's game making abilities and the game maker engine and how that can be utilized in other mediums such as filmmaking,
3512460	3522460	because I've heard of Unreal Engine being used in things like teaching, and there's other industries and other places that that engine can develop things for.
3522460	3535460	I know one of the focuses that they have on the training that's online is with architecture and designing buildings and interiors, decorating that type of stuff.
3535460	3542460	It's used a lot for that as well. So, yeah, be interesting to see what they do with it.
3542460	3547460	Yeah, for sure. All right, well, moving on, let's talk about a new game announcement that happened this week.
3547460	3555460	So Nintendo was hyping a treehouse event where they were going to be showing more footage of the new Paper Mario game, the Origami King that's coming out pretty soon.
3555460	3560460	So they did a treehouse event to show some footage for that, but they also dropped on Twitter.
3560460	3568460	By the way, WayForward is going to be announcing a new game that's new for them, not a new IP or something like that.
3568460	3575460	And this caused social media to go fucking nuts because WayForward has done a lot of really quality retro revivals.
3575460	3580460	I believe they were behind the Blaster Master Zero stuff, if I'm not mistaken, right?
3580460	3585460	Certainly WayForward is synonymous with Shantae and those types of games.
3586460	3589460	Didn't they do the DuckTales remaster as well?
3589460	3602460	Yes, they did. So a lot of people, the first thing was, holy shit, Nintendo has given them Metroid, I don't know, insert fanboy thing here, and WayForward is going to announce this.
3602460	3607460	Well, Nintendo had to go so far as to say it's not a first party title.
3607460	3612460	They actually did that rare follow-up tweet where they were like, calm the fuck down. They didn't say that, but that's what I heard.
3612460	3616460	Calm the fuck down, it's not a first party game, it's a third party game.
3616460	3623460	But then everybody, and myself included, I was like, I would love for it. How about the Guardian Legend? How about a Konami title?
3623460	3631460	You know, but I did put the footnote, I did say, I know I'm just hyping myself up, these things are not going to happen and we'll just be happy with whatever it is.
3631460	3633460	It's time for Elibits to come back.
3633460	3645460	Well, imagine the internet's response. Imagine everybody hypes themselves up and imagine the response when WayForward comes out and announces, Bakugan, champions of Vestroya.
3645460	3654460	And everybody's like, Bakugan? The fuck is that? And that was, it came out on the Wii and if you see the art, you'll be like, oh yeah, I've seen this game before.
3654460	3661460	It was a game that was on the Wii and so forth. So WayForward is bringing it back and it's a game where you can, and it's going to launch on November 3rd.
3661460	3670460	And you can build your own team. It's an action RPG style game. There actually is a TV series that goes with this and it's an original story that will expand on that.
3670460	3676460	There's 100 different quests in the game, over 100 different quests. You collect different Bakugan, it's kind of like Pokemon like that.
3676460	3683460	You collect 80 different ones. There's 200 different ability types and upgrades. There will be online head-to-head multiplayer and so on.
3683460	3691460	And you know, it's funny because there are a lot of people that were like, Bakugan? But there's also some people that were like, fuck yeah, I liked Bakugan. I'm glad this is coming back.
3691460	3699460	So it's a little bit niche and I think, again, people set the bar really high on what they were expecting, but that's what the internet does.
3699460	3704460	And if you are not used to the internet setting themselves up for disappointment, I don't know, you must be new here.
3704460	3714460	But Bakugan, it's an interesting choice. I'll say that. And that's not me being shady. It just is, wow, you know, of all the different games out there, it's interesting they're going back to this one.
3714460	3717460	But they have the TV series and all those tie-ins too.
3720460	3726460	Miltonious Games and Chat says, that announcement made the live chat for that treehouse insufferable.
3726460	3731460	Everyone being rude and impatient during the Paper Mario stuff just to be angry at the announcement.
3732460	3742460	For me personally, when it comes to these big events, this is why I always, always, always turn chat off and just do a full screen theater mode on my PS4.
3742460	3749460	I never read chat during these types of events because the chat is shit. I just, it's horrible.
3749460	3759460	The only time I have ever experienced good chat rooms, I would say for the most part, the awesome games done quick, they usually have pretty good chats.
3759460	3768460	But what really, like, I don't think chat will ever be this good again, was that first Bob Ross marathon they had on Twitch.
3768460	3779460	That was pure and wholesome. And I don't think I'll ever be in a Twitch chat, well, besides you guys, of course, I'll ever be in a Twitch chat room that great again.
3779460	3788460	So, yeah. Anyway, other comments in chat. I want to make sure I got what VG Realness said because it is very true.
3788460	3797460	VG Realness says, always go into any type of Nintendo Direct or event with the utmost minimal expectations and you will always be satisfied.
3797460	3802460	After they showed Yarn Yoshi for like a year on Nintendo Directs, I learned my lesson.
3802460	3806460	That part. That is exactly correct.
3806460	3808460	Alright.
3808460	3812460	Agdefton chat says, never read chat except VOG chat. Fair.
3812460	3816460	Alright, moving on. Let's get into another story.
3816460	3821460	So, I think this one's yours, Dark Sakura. So, you have to take a break from your meta game and your camera up there.
3821460	3824460	I got to do something, right?
3824460	3830460	So, going back to Ubisoft, there's more drama.
3830460	3833460	And they actually...
3833460	3836460	I'm going to step off cam for just a moment, but I'll be listening. Sorry.
3836460	3838460	Wait, I'm stealing my thunder.
3838460	3840460	Okay, I see how it is.
3840460	3845460	Anyway, Ubisoft has released an announcement.
3845460	3849460	Yes, that was a Sailor Venus pinned RG Realness. I have the full set of the original five.
3849460	3857460	But at any rate, Ubisoft has announced that they are having a departure of many of their top officials.
3857460	3863460	Including their human resources director, their second highest official.
3863460	3867460	I'm going to mispronounce Serge Hasouette.
3867460	3873460	Hasouette has quit his post as Chief Creative Officer immediately.
3873460	3878460	And that his role will be taken over by the CEO, Yves Guillemot.
3878460	3889460	And the quote from Guillemot says, Ubisoft has fallen short of its obligation to guarantee a safe and inclusive working environment for its employees.
3890460	3893460	So, do you know what that goes back to?
3893460	3898460	It goes back to quite a bit more harassment and misconduct.
3898460	3901460	It's actually pretty terrible.
3901460	3906460	And I'm really glad that people are speaking up about it.
3906460	3913460	That people are putting their foot down and letting them know that these things won't be tolerated anymore and going very public with it.
3913460	3915460	We need more of this.
3915460	3922460	So, we're definitely seeing the resurgence of Me Too and we are seeing these voices being heard finally.
3922460	3931460	And so, their HR person, Cecile Corneille, has also resigned, like I said earlier.
3931460	3938460	And they are going to be appointing a new global human resources manager.
3938460	3948460	Now, even with all of this, they are not, well, by are not, mean did not address misconduct issues during the digital showcase.
3948460	3951460	And I'm going to read the direct quote from their Twitter.
3951460	3956460	Ubisoft Forward comes during a time of big internal change.
3956460	3964460	Because all the content has been prerecorded, we want to recognize that the issues we're currently dealing with won't be addressed directly in the show.
3964460	3967460	We still have significant work to do and are committed to this process.
3967460	3970460	We will provide more updates soon.
3970460	3988460	So basically, they're not glossing over it, but it, it looks like that they are acknowledging it but I mean if this stuff was recorded then, yeah, there's no way they can time travel and do it with enough time and it's already been done.
3988460	4002460	And then I mean there's also, I mean there's a bunch of other announcements come up for sexual misconduct, like over 50 in the Super Smash Brothers community.
4002460	4013460	There were the ones that I spoke about a few weeks ago, and it's really time that people in, you know, especially I'm just gonna go say it.
4013460	4026460	Don't go, not all men because it is enough cisgender men who are pulling this shit that we have to be wary of all of them, except the people I know.
4026460	4029460	You guys are cool.
4030460	4045460	Trust is something that's earned. Trust is not something that's automatically granted in a position of power and I think we talked about this. I don't know if it was two weeks ago or last week but I remember having a tangent where it was, this is really a call against people in power
4045460	4057460	and do they deserve that power, and if they're going to use that power for bad things that power is going to be taken away and there's going to be that accountability and I think there's a big kind of reckoning with that concept in all sorts of places right now.
4057460	4068460	There's a lot of what you see with the racial injustice and the police and that whole thing is that police are in a position of power. And the reason why they have protections to let them abuse it.
4068460	4082460	And so that's why people are saying they want to defund the police because these this power, if it's not being used for good things should be taken away. So my point is, is that I think that's kind of like the common thread you're seeing in a lot of these
4082460	4096460	social movements that are going on right now is kind of questioning why are these people in power, are they using power for good things. Why should they continue to be in power, you know, that being said, there actually is.
4096460	4102460	Well, I mean it's no secret that probably my favorite other podcast out there is stuff mom never told you.
4102460	4115460	The July 3 episode is a really good one to listen to talking about the state of me to during the pandemic, you know, going on in July, but it brings up a lot of what's going on in the gaming community.
4115460	4128460	Definitely, definitely worth a listen to it's a very good episode, and it goes into a lot of some of the same things that I've said so I think it would definitely be worth a listen to.
4128460	4136460	Let me go ahead and give Matt a chance to jump in with the next story because it just like you actually referenced it a second here.
4136460	4156460	Darcyra just keeps on going so you know you have, you know, allegations in major AAA companies. And of course there's been a countless, not countless but lots of allegations of misconduct in very is in gaming communities and one of those in particular
4156460	4170460	is the Super Smash Brothers community. So, over the last few weeks has been about 50 different allegations made from the community regarding different people in the community.
4170460	4188460	And just, it's been all sorts of things from allegations of rape sexual assault preying on minors grooming underage players I mean it's just, it's, it's ridiculous that this is just everywhere.
4188460	4204460	But yeah, it's a lot of people have kind of dropped out of, you know, competing in the Smash Brothers community because of this. I know that there's been several people that have been taken out of the tournaments.
4204460	4214460	I don't know how people can get their arms around this kind of stuff. It's just, I think it's just everywhere and unfortunately we are only hearing about, you know, a small percentage of them.
4214460	4235460	Yeah, and I mean, and I think the number I heard was that there's 50 allegations of 50 different in the Smash community. I mean, 50, 50, that is all. I mean, one is too many I mean we all know that but I mean that just really like is like holy God, you know, it's, it's, it's a tricky
4235460	4250460	And it's a tricky story because on one hand you're like, I that's horrible that these events ever happened on the same token, it's coming to light and maybe we can do something about it now and clean this up because, you know, we might be you know losing these people
4250460	4267460	from from the the tournament scene or whatever but think about all the people that and again this goes back to being in a position of power and what you do with that power. Think of all the people that think of all the people that other people in power suppressed from wanting to join the community.
4267460	4282460	Like for for everyone who speaks up, there are other people who have not spoken up. You know there's, and, and this is just more of a general thing but at least for for people who are assigned, you know, female at birth.
4282460	4295460	We are raised with this conditioning that we're just supposed to take it that this is the way it is that our voice isn't as important that we're supposed to worry about the needs of others before ourselves and we're all.
4295460	4306460	Yeah, it's bullshit. We have as much right to anger. We have as much right to protect ourselves we have as much right to have power and want things as anybody.
4306460	4317460	And, and I think that the old guard is starting to realize that they're losing their ground, and it's, it's really time to hold those asses to the fire. Yeah.
4317460	4334460	And, you know, there's those types of things those types of traumatic experiences that people go through whether it's you know these very very very serious allegations of sexual assault or so forth or, you know, even, even folks that bully other people and use,
4334460	4354460	you know their positions of power to, you know, bully or traumatize other people can can can hold people back from wanting to join a space like designing video games like entering these types of tournaments and so forth and, or maybe not wanting to be on
4354460	4366460	Twitch, a few years earlier. I don't know. Anyway, well, and by statistics, women do make up half of the gamers. We are, I mean it is split.
4366460	4381460	Yet, you know, it's been such a boys club for so long that, you know, there's this, you know, this myth versus the reality, and it's time. It's time for people to realize that we are half of it.
4381460	4389460	We deserve respect, everyone deserves respect, but it's time to start paying attention to it. It's long last time to start paying attention.
4389460	4393460	I'm sorry Loki I took your story.
4393460	4397460	Oh, that's fine. We bring stories to the table for discussion that's what it is.
4397460	4406460	Tiger con chat says you're in a place of business, and you're supposed to treat it as one. This is not some bar where you can go mingle with others and hoping you'll hook up.
4406460	4409460	That's a really good point.
4409460	4423460	And I know sometimes I give Tiger Claw a lot of shit for some of like the constant updates on the Sonic movie and things like that, but I'm gonna give credit where credit is due, because that is an excellent point I want y'all to think about for a little bit.
4423460	4436460	Especially because we know that Twitch is a place where some people have gone to want to create their certain types of careers, right like I'm going to stream full time and that's going to be my job.
4436460	4453460	Well then, you got to put on your big boy pants and treat it like a job, and exactly that. That means when you go to these mixer parties and so forth that E3 or Twitch con or something like that, you are still representing you and your brand.
4453460	4465460	That is not the time to be a sleaze. Unless your brand is sleaze, I suppose, but I don't think a sleaze brand tends to do very well.
4465460	4479460	So, that's a very excellent point in my opinion. If you want Twitch streaming to be your job, if you want competitive video games to be your job, treat it like it's your fucking job.
4480460	4481460	Because it is.
4481460	4483460	Because it is, and that's what you want it to be.
4485460	4495460	Alright, let's see, I'm looking at other... GGRama S says true, but there is after hours which causes all this.
4495460	4497460	Well, I think...
4497460	4499460	Oh no, this shit happens at work.
4500460	4509460	Of course, of course. But when virtualness is your workplace, right? Then it is something that kind of like always surrounds you.
4509460	4522460	And again, if your workplace, if your job is you and your brand, then you've kind of picked a career where you're always on 24-7. I mean look at actors and actresses, right?
4522460	4532460	Who's that guy? Is it Ezra Miller that got filmed at like a Costco or something? Like some fan goes like, choke me daddy or something.
4532460	4540460	And like Ezra Miller like does it. Like full on like kind of like assault. And I'm sorry because I don't remember if it was provoked or not.
4540460	4547460	And I don't want to make it sound like it was provoked when it wasn't. I saw this thing once like two months ago. Maybe somebody in chat can fill me in.
4547460	4555460	But like literally chokes a fan. And I think I have to say it's allegedly Ezra Miller because I don't know if it was ever proven it really was him.
4555460	4570460	But my point with all that is like because everybody's got you know the smartphones and cameras and so forth. He's a celebrity. You can't just go around choking people when you're off the clock. Does that make sense?
4570460	4572460	You can't just go around choking people anyway.
4573460	4576460	Exactly, exactly. Sorry, I'm on the clock. It's okay now.
4576460	4585460	Sorry, you're right. I worded that horribly. I'm very sorry. No, my job is being Darth Vader. I will force choke you now. No, I shouldn't make light of it. No, don't choke people ever. That's a good thing.
4585460	4598460	But you know the point I'm getting at though, right? Is that, you know, he has to represent his brand because his brand is his job and being able to land movie roles and things like that all of the time, right?
4599460	4604460	Yeah, so don't choke strangers. That's that's the thing. Let's see.
4604460	4606460	Bonds006 says, Darn, can't choke the fan.
4606460	4613460	Oh yeah, SD100Matt says, You're mostly right, Rob. The fan was stalking him in a bar and he snapped and he choked the fan.
4613460	4624460	So there's a little bit of, you know, not that choking is ever appropriate, but this is definitely one of those cases of a wrong led to a bigger wrong and it led to a big whole wrong snowball.
4624460	4632460	So, you know, at the same time, you have to allow actors and actresses, you know, they're fucking people, give them their space, right?
4632460	4639460	That's why I hate doing that stuff. Like I've been told like, oh, look, there's so and so over there. We should go like talk to him.
4639460	4647460	And I'm like, no, let them like have your moment of hey, that's so and so and move on because you like let them live. It's so annoying.
4647460	4656460	Anyway. All right. Anything else you want to say on this important topic? I'm sorry, I might have derailed things a little bit, but I did want to get the chat comments out.
4656460	4665460	Fuck it. Just just be decent. Be nice. Yeah. Stop being an asshole.
4665460	4669460	Gaming is for everyone. Make it a space for everyone.
4669460	4671460	Gaming is for everyone. Exactly.
4671460	4674460	Yeah, Bobby. Teach your kids to be decent.
4674460	4679460	That too. Don't be creepy. All right. Moving on.
4679460	4687460	Let's go to a completely different topic and talk about Nintendo and a lot of a lot of confusion about where the hell Nintendo is at right now,
4687460	4696460	because Nintendo hasn't really done a direct to announce a barrage of new games outside of this random Bakugan announcement, which isn't even really their game anyway.
4697460	4704460	So what's Nintendo doing? What are they up to? Did this COVID situation screw them up? What's happening?
4704460	4712460	So there was a shareholder meeting and in talking to investors, senior managing executive officer at Nintendo,
4712460	4720460	Shinya Takahashi said that although the company as a whole is a little behind schedule due to the pandemic,
4720460	4727460	game releases this fiscal year through March 2021 are currently not affected.
4727460	4732460	So they're saying that games that are scheduled to come out this fiscal year are not affected.
4732460	4741460	Now, here's my thing, though. I think there's a lot of word choice going on there because fiscal year goes through March 2021.
4741460	4748460	So if there was a game that was going to come out in November, that maybe doesn't make it out now until March 2021.
4748460	4752460	Well, they still made their fiscal year now, didn't they?
4752460	4757460	So I don't think this necessarily means that everything is on and they admit to being a little bit behind.
4757460	4760460	So I don't think this is necessarily saying that everything is on schedule.
4760460	4771460	Now, of course, the other thing that Nintendo has kind of taught us is that the holiday season might not be what it once was in this industry.
4771460	4773460	And what I mean by that is let's not forget.
4773460	4780460	Nintendo launched the switch outside of the holiday period within the fiscal year. They launched it in March.
4780460	4788460	So technically, Nintendo is kind of used to this where they can launch big products in January, February, March, and they'll still do very well.
4788460	4794460	If the game is good, it'll sell, right? So I wouldn't worry too much.
4794460	4801460	Well, I think if you are we're expecting a whole bunch of releases in October, November, they may be delayed a few months.
4801460	4806460	But it sounds like we will still have some things coming by March of 2021 for sure.
4806460	4809460	What that is, though, we don't know how they're going to announce those games.
4809460	4812460	We don't know. Nothing has really been said on that front.
4812460	4820460	So Phoenix 7726 says, I can only imagine what Black Friday is going to be like.
4820460	4826460	I think everybody should prepare themselves for the possibility there may not be one like the way you were used to before.
4826460	4834460	I mean, we just we don't know what the virus situation is going to look like, but there's likely not going to be a vaccine by November or treatment.
4834460	4838460	So, I mean, we can cross our fingers and hope for a miracle in the treatment department.
4838460	4844460	But as things, you know, hopefully COVID starts to trail off.
4844460	4848460	You know, maybe by some miracle, we are able to reverse that.
4848460	4853460	We convince people to wear their masks and it's it starts to trail off a little more in this country.
4853460	4862460	But I imagine those huge crowds of people fighting over toasters not going to happen this year because they're just going to limit how many people go in those stores.
4862460	4864460	But it's it is still too early to say.
4864460	4869460	I mean, if you think about it, from March till now has been four months.
4869460	4875460	And how much has changed in that four months? And guess what? From July to November, that's another four months.
4875460	4880460	So a lot can change. We'll see.
4880460	4885460	S2100 Matt says, Prime Day was supposed to be this past week. Amazon delayed it indefinitely.
4885460	4889460	Phoenix 7726 says, at least in the USA. Yeah, it's going to get canceled.
4889460	4892460	I don't trust our leaders enough to knock this down by then.
4892460	4901460	This is probably unfortunately true. However, don't get conceded if you're in another country.
4901460	4905460	There's still going to have to be protections that happen in other countries.
4905460	4912460	Like I know New Zealand's very proud of the fact that they don't really have coronavirus right now, or at least those that they do are like completely isolated.
4912460	4916460	It's a very low number. They haven't had the outbreak in New Zealand nearly in the way that we've had here.
4916460	4921460	Kudos to them. They've had very competent leadership in New Zealand in fighting this virus.
4921460	4928460	But they can't get lazy about it, right? If they suddenly relax a lot of things, what's going to happen?
4928460	4932460	It's going to invite the virus into this place that's been mostly unexposed, right?
4932460	4947460	So my point is, countries are going to have to continue to fight and protect against this until we have a vaccine, effective treatment, herd immunity, which seems, I mean, I know there's a lot of recent studies on that.
4947460	4955460	There's a lot of conflicting stuff right now on that. Let's just say the reports on vaccines seem more promising than the reports on herd immunity. That's all I'll say with that.
4955460	4958460	Well, and Sweden proved that point.
4958460	4960460	Oh yeah, there was that too.
4960460	4966460	And on top of that, the new studies are saying that it's possible to be reinfected and that the virus is airborne.
4966460	4971460	Joy. Yeah. So, anyhow.
4971460	4980460	So anyway, one other thing I want to say about the Nintendo piece though, besides just like, you know, the games possibly being pushed out till March 2021 a little bit.
4980460	4983460	We have to think of the holiday season running through March.
4983460	4993460	They did mention that the working from home benefits have not necessarily been all negative because it was also revealed that recent surprise release of their jump rope challenge.
4993460	5002460	I don't know if you've seen that on the switch, but it was like a little freebie they put out jump rope challenge was like a game jam that Nintendo did in house.
5002460	5009460	Another comment from Takahashi said that the game was built with pandemic centric physical fitness in mind.
5009460	5019460	So they they basically did a game jam, it sounds like about what are some ways that the switch could encourage physical fitness while being at home and jump rope challenge was the result.
5019460	5029460	That's kind of rad actually so and I love this image of big game companies doing internal game jams to find the next little big product.
5029460	5042460	And I'm sure Nintendo is not the only company to do it. And I just I think that's really neat. So I like that I think that's a good thing to come from this whole isolation thing not that there's really anything good about it but you, you look for the diamonds
5042460	5049460	in the rough I suppose. So, all right, well moving on dark soccer What do you have for us next.
5049460	5052460	You're muted dark soccer just you know on your, on your headset.
5052460	5058460	Thank you. You're welcome. Well going back to other Nintendo related news.
5058460	5069460	We have now had another unopened copy of Super Mario Brothers sell, not like a Mario Super Mario Brothers Duck Hunt or any of that it's a Super Mario Brothers.
5069460	5074460	And this one sold for 114,000.
5074460	5083460	It was one of the 1985 releases. It was put up by heritage auctions that based out of Dallas.
5083460	5089460	It is the most money ever paid for a video game according to heritage.
5089460	5106460	It is a particularly rare copy of Super Mario Brothers because the, it means that the box was sealed with a cardboard hanging tab underneath the plastic which is an indicator that this was produced after Nintendo started using shrink shrink wrap to seal their
5106460	5108460	games rather than stickers.
5108460	5118460	And so it's an excellent condition. It's the highest graded copy of the game that heritage is ever sold.
5118460	5136460	The whole auction that they did brought in about 700,000, according to a heritage. They also sold a prototype of a Sega Pluto to console, which sold for 84,000, as far as I know, I think there's only two in existence.
5136460	5151460	So, this particular one, the the Pluto zero to the thing about this one is it was supposed to be a Sega Saturn, that was more of a budget model that had the built in
5151460	5162460	internet connectors on it. And so the thing with that is it had it been released it would have been the first home console that that was internet capable.
5162460	5170460	And then one of their other big sellers was a copy of Mike Tyson's punch out for 50,400, and it was one of the first.
5170460	5179460	And one of the first sealed copies of Super Mario Brothers three that was 38,400. And there are apparently less than 10 copies of that in existence.
5179460	5181460	Wow.
5181460	5193460	There's something if I had, if I had that money, I could I could pay off my house, well there's, there's certain elements of these that are making them collectibles and like you said with the Super Mario.
5193460	5202460	It's the fact that it had the pull tab and it was sealed that way as opposed to shrink wrap, because I think that also indicated I think, and somebody in chat might have to help me fill in the gaps.
5202460	5220460	But I want to say that pull tab was very unique to like the first pressing of the game. And I think some type of arrangement with Sears, that they were sold exclusively in their store like in the first pressing and I think the box itself has like a black bar in a different place or something like that
5220460	5242460	But there's, there were very few of those made because the pull tab was more of a test market thing. Whereas when it went like full, because you might be sitting there at home and you have a copy of just Super Mario Brothers, because I mean, as rare as it is to find a Super Mario Brothers by itself cartridge because most people remember that packed in with Duck Hunt, right, or even the Duck Hunt world class track meet, right.
5242460	5249460	But there were some Mario Brothers by itself because if you, you might recall, there was also a Rob the Robot set.
5249460	5263460	And Mario, Mario Brothers wasn't packed in with that. It was Gyrumite. Once it was Gyrumite, maybe it was Breakthrough. It was one of those Rob the Robot games and I think Duck Hunt.
5263460	5264460	No, Wrecking Crew.
5264460	5265460	Wrecking Crew.
5266460	5278460	Okay, so it was a difference. So you still had to buy Mario Brothers separately. So I mean, that card existed, but I think in the earliest, earliest version, like the test market stuff had the pull tab and that's what makes it so rare.
5278460	5283460	So, and there's got to be things like Mike Tyson's Punch Out. Shit, I had that game.
5283460	5290460	But there's got to be something about like a particular first pressing or a mistake or something. I mean, the fact that still shrink wraps pretty good.
5290460	5297460	But you can, you can go back and re-shrink wrap games. There's got to be something about that packaging that's different.
5299460	5305460	Oh, Hype Mayhem is actually saying, I got the NES that came with Gyrumite and Duck Hunt and we got Super Mario Brothers separately.
5305460	5314460	And Dark Tetsuya says, I have the Super Mario Brothers Duck Hunt track meet three and one. Yeah, a little later on, then the power pad Nintendo.
5314460	5330460	So there was like, there was the NES robot set and the action set and the action set was one with the Zapper and that sold way more than the robot set because the robot set was more expensive and Nintendo never really convinced people why the robot was a thing you needed.
5330460	5331460	It was a gimmick.
5331460	5332460	It was, yeah, it was very gimmicky.
5332460	5338460	So then I have to ask everyone, what color was the gun on your Nintendo?
5338460	5339460	Silver.
5339460	5340460	It was gray.
5340460	5350460	Silver, yeah. So yes, they did. They changed the color of the gun. What, by about 87, they changed the color of the gun to that neon orange because realism.
5350460	5358460	And also, and I was also going to make the joke that the action set with the gun sold better than the robot set because this is America and we love guns.
5358460	5359460	So the action set.
5359460	5361460	But you know what never changed color?
5361460	5362460	Huh?
5362460	5365460	The zillion gun that came with the Sega Master System.
5365460	5366460	Oh yeah.
5366460	5370460	Wasn't the Rob the Robot set way more expensive too?
5370460	5376460	It was. It was way more expensive and they really could, and then people didn't, people didn't want Gyromite and Duck Hunt.
5376460	5379460	People wanted Mario Brothers that are Super Mario Brothers, of course.
5379460	5380460	That was the game.
5380460	5387460	I remember I always, I would always see like it was at our local like video rental store and I think they sold games too because I bought games from them.
5387460	5393460	But they always had like behind the like display case, the Rob the Robot thing. I was like, oh man, I don't want that.
5393460	5397460	But then like, of course, you know, it's like a couple hundred bucks with just that.
5397460	5401460	One of my friends in high school had Rob the Robot because he was a spoiled brat.
5401460	5405460	So he had that and I remember playing it at his house.
5405460	5409460	So there was, you know, I did, I get to get to check that out at one point.
5409460	5411460	So, all right.
5411460	5415460	I just, I'm just telling it like it is, y'all. All right.
5415460	5419460	Anyway, need to know that the old video is, oh, anyway, sorry.
5419460	5425460	I meant to say, so the action set got replaced at some point with the power pad set, right?
5425460	5426460	That was everything.
5426460	5429460	And then I think after the power pad set came that new Nintendo.
5429460	5431460	So they didn't even really sell sets anymore at that point.
5431460	5434460	So a lot of people had that power pad set as well.
5434460	5444460	But ironically, the other super expensive NES game is if you can find that track meet game, world class track meet.
5444460	5448460	I mean, if you can find that when it was called stadium events, because what happened,
5448460	5453460	Nintendo got that power pad by acquiring it from another company and they acquired stadium events
5453460	5455460	and then repackaged it as world class track meet.
5455460	5459460	But if you can find an original stadium events, that shit is very expensive.
5459460	5464460	So it's kind of neat. Interesting.
5464460	5469460	All right. Stadium events. Yeah, that's what I thought there in a chat.
5469460	5475460	Act F says, I still remember that news story about some dudes in Brazil robbing a bank or something with Master System guns.
5475460	5479460	And Bobby Black Wolf does point out with all the counterfeits, it's really hard.
5479460	5490460	That's a good point. It's easy relatively through minorly sophisticated technology to just take an old cart no one wants,
5490460	5498460	like gyro mite, sorry, gyro mite fans, and replace the ROM, flash an image instead of stadium, excuse me,
5498460	5502460	stadium events on the ROM, put a new sticker on it.
5502460	5505460	Tada. You have a counterfeit copy of stadium events.
5505460	5510460	And that's unfortunately something that you can do. So it's tricky, tricky.
5510460	5513460	All right. Anyway, let's move on. We got some more news to get into.
5513460	5517460	We could talk about video game collecting for a long time, but we have news about a video game collectible.
5517460	5526460	Right, Logie? Yes. And so this this really hits home for me because I own a full size cabinet of one of these.
5526460	5536460	It's a Sega Astro City, and it's basically a bunch of it's a mini one of those like mini devices.
5536460	5544460	And I mean, it looks pretty beefy. It's reminds me a lot of like the Neo Geo collectors mini that they did,
5544460	5546460	but about that same size.
5546460	5553460	It's got thirty six games and it's going to retail for about one hundred nineteen dollars or twelve thousand eight hundred yen.
5553460	5558460	And some of the games that they've revealed are at least the first ten.
5558460	5564460	Virtua Fighter, Fantasy Zone, Golden Axe, Golden Axe, The Revenge of Death Adder, Alien Storm,
5564460	5571460	Alien Syndrome, Columns II, Dark Edge, Puzzle in Action, Tant R, and Altered Beasts.
5571460	5575460	You know, I want it. And it's pretty cool.
5575460	5579460	So aside from it having like a screen in there and everything,
5579460	5588460	they also have it looks like a almost like a Genesis controller version that you can get as well.
5588460	5595460	Almost looks like an old Mark three controller, but with the extra buttons.
5595460	5602460	Yeah, I mean, the controller that they have on there, I mean, definitely resembles the Astro City.
5602460	5608460	But the little like controller, I guess, plugs in its USB is only twenty six bucks.
5608460	5616460	Yeah, it's pretty nice. I just wish my screen worked on mine because when I moved it to the garage, it stopped displaying pictures.
5616460	5621460	And actually now I was looking at some parts and stuff. I'm like, I just remembered that.
5621460	5627460	I wonder if I disconnected something on the power supply. So I have I have to go look at that later tonight.
5627460	5633460	But it's not 100 degrees out in the garage. Do you think it's the heat that screwed up that system?
5633460	5637460	No, no, no, no, no. This was in the winter when I moved everything.
5637460	5641460	So I had an issue with I don't know what it is.
5641460	5646460	I think it could have been because like it's a really I mean, it's got a CRT in it.
5646460	5649460	That's like a 29 inch CRT. And I think it's heavy.
5649460	5657460	So I think it's possible that when I moved it in there, maybe the jostling it around could have caused some problems or because it's old.
5657460	5664460	I mean, it's probably a few decades old. So I mean, I don't know.
5664460	5671460	It's stuff like that just eventually dies. And you might feel like, yeah, redo the capacitors on there or I may just need to replace them.
5671460	5675460	I knew that someone take a look at it. But I mean, I had restored everything.
5675460	5683460	I gutted the PC out of it, though, because I had Mame running it. But now I needed it for parts for my DDR machine.
5683460	5686460	So I'll have to rebuild it and it'll be even better.
5686460	5690460	Now, I didn't really talk about it during my gaming week, but I still love my BurgerTime one up cabinet.
5690460	5695460	Although I promised I promised my husband I'm not going to get any more one up cabinets.
5695460	5699460	You sure? Because I saw that. So I was looking online.
5699460	5703460	I noticed that they had marked the bunch down in April to 50 bucks.
5703460	5709460	And apparently there's a few of the Star Wars ones left over in Roseville for 50 bucks.
5709460	5714460	Thank you, Alan. Put a smush cameo on. Sorry. Wow.
5714460	5719460	It's a space thing. We need less. They also had a final fight in West.
5719460	5725460	We need less in this house, not more. Here's 50 bucks, by the way.
5725460	5728460	Wow. You might want to get on that. Where am I going to put that with all the pinball in my house?
5728460	5734460	You'll find a place. You don't need a bed.
5734460	5739460	But I did. I did say, though, like I promised Alan no more one up cabinets.
5739460	5744460	However, if they announce a Tron cabinet.
5744460	5750460	I'll risk divorce. I'm just kidding. That wouldn't happen, but I.
5750460	5757460	Alan would have to understand and give me that one if if if they do a Tron arcade one up cabinet at some point.
5757460	5764460	And now that apparently Tron three like those, I'll believe it when I see a trailer or that they're actually like there's on set photos or something.
5764460	5769460	You know, like I thought it was supposed to be a remake, though, like I don't.
5769460	5777460	I don't know the whole thing with Jared Leto was supposed to be a remake. And I'll be very disappointed if it is because they left it open like it was like it was a really interesting storyline.
5777460	5782460	And I was like, never reboot it. Why? I'll believe it when I see footage.
5782460	5790460	But until then, my hope is if they were to do a new Tron movie, they would want to like maybe release a cabinet to go with that.
5790460	5796460	Although, I don't know, maybe Disney want to do their own thing, but I would love to get electronica back, Rob.
5796460	5805460	I'd be so well, now that I'm going to have all this time off work saved up, that that trip to Disney World is happening when it's safe.
5805460	5815460	I'm not going to be there tomorrow, but when the Tron ride opens and, you know, hopefully our world gets past covid, I will be on that ride.
5815460	5817460	I'm so excited.
5817460	5822460	Pretty sure Bobby Black Wolf has already said he's driving down for that, too, or I just committed him. I don't know.
5822460	5823460	All right.
5823460	5827460	Are they bringing the Tron ride to Disney World?
5827460	5831460	Oh, yeah, the one in Shanghai. They've been building that in Disney World for about a year.
5831460	5836460	It's supposed to open next year, although I don't know how the timetable gets thrown off.
5836460	5838460	So it looks very cool.
5838460	5840460	Yeah, for real.
5840460	5842460	All right. Anyhow, moving on.
5842460	5844460	Let's talk about Microsoft.
5844460	5851460	And we know that Xbox and Xbox Game Studios has been growing and growing thanks to acquisitions.
5851460	5857460	In fact, they were rumored recently as a possible suitor for Warner Interactive, if I'm not mistaken.
5857460	5859460	Right. That was the thing that was going around.
5859460	5863460	So is Microsoft going to stop the acquisition of Game Studios?
5863460	5866460	And the short answer is no.
5866460	5873460	And this is in an interview with GamesIndustry.biz that Phil Spencer, of course, the head of Xbox, did, saying,
5873460	5879460	We acquired quite a few new studios in a short amount of time, and we want to make sure that those studios are onboarded in the right way.
5879460	5888460	As the head, Matt, and I were talking about it, we just want to make sure that we treated the incoming studios as full parts of the organization they felt supported.
5888460	5890460	And so on and so on.
5890460	5898460	Goes on to say that the CEO of Microsoft, who is not Bill Gates, Bill Gates actually is very removed from that company at this point.
5898460	5904460	But Sataya Nadella, and I probably said his name wrong, I'm sorry, but he's the CEO of Microsoft,
5904460	5911460	has not really given the sign that they should slow down acquisitions of studios.
5911460	5914460	So they're just going to continue to onboard studios.
5914460	5920460	And Phil Spencer says that the Game Pass subscriber base portfolio continues to grow.
5920460	5922460	We're launching a new console.
5922460	5926460	It was our biggest year ever on PC in terms of revenue.
5926460	5933460	We have really strong support from the CEO and the chief financial officer, Amy Hood.
5933460	5940460	And there's been no signal at all that we should be slowing down, but just to go at a pace that is maintainable for us as a leadership team.
5940460	5945460	We're always out there talking to people, but it has to be the right opportunity.
5945460	5953460	And this article I'm looking at as well reminds us that they were rumored, as I just mentioned, with the whole Warner Interactive thing going on.
5953460	5956460	So there may be more in the future.
5956460	5957460	So we'll see.
5957460	5964460	And of course, it's really only a couple of weeks now until we really get to see the fruits of what that's going to bring us.
5964460	5969460	Yes, we know a few of the Xbox games from that trailer peak a couple weeks ago.
5969460	5978460	But we know we're going to be getting a real meaty look at what 2020 is going to look like for Microsoft in just a couple weeks on the 23rd, right?
5978460	5981460	Yeah, very shortly.
5981460	5984460	I'm very excited to see what they have for there.
5984460	5992460	Hopefully, the demos that they're going to be bringing are going to have PC versions as well because I don't got no Xbox.
5992460	5995460	And for all we know, they may announce new acquisitions at that time.
5995460	5998460	They don't necessarily have to announce it right when it happens.
5998460	6003460	Look at what happened at that one E3 where they remember they had them all out on the stage.
6003460	6004460	That was a really impressive E3.
6004460	6007460	And they're like, we got this one and this one and this one and this one.
6007460	6008460	It's like, damn.
6008460	6011460	So it could be anyone.
6011460	6017460	And I see in chat, DGRama S says Microsoft needs to acquire a few Japanese studios. Seriously.
6017460	6019460	That would be a gag.
6019460	6023460	If Microsoft acquires a Japanese studio, that is going to be huge.
6023460	6028460	And I know a lot of people have their fan wank as to which studio they want to see acquired.
6028460	6033460	But I think just if they were to get at all a Japanese studio, that would be a pretty big deal.
6033460	6041460	So we'll see. Hype Mayhem in chat says next up, Microsoft buys Sony, Nintendo, Disney, Activision, EA, the White House.
6041460	6043460	I don't really see it going that far.
6043460	6052460	But I think because we have other big gaming companies out there like EA is buying a bunch of little things.
6052460	6055460	Activision Blizzard buys a bunch of little things.
6055460	6062460	I don't think MS is going to get accused of antitrust violations by picking up a couple other studios.
6062460	6065460	It's all about kind of how they handle it, I suppose.
6065460	6074460	But they have, I think, a huge way they've also been kind of avoiding that talk is that they're putting Minecraft out on the Switch and PlayStation.
6074460	6078460	So that is one way I think Microsoft kind of gets around that hole.
6078460	6083460	They're not allowing competition because they're actually putting games on competitors consoles.
6083460	6086460	So true. Yeah.
6086460	6091460	All right. We'll see what develops. It's going to be it's going to be very fascinating when we get to July.
6091460	6095460	Anyway, let's let's go back to a classic time, shall we?
6095460	6100460	We're going to go back, take a step in time to the classic game of the week.
6100460	6107460	Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking this game out.
6107460	6113460	And you should acquire some knowledge about this particular game.
6113460	6117460	Dark Sakura, what have you picked for the folks for the classic game of the week?
6117460	6119460	I'm on week number six, by the way.
6119460	6123460	I know. But now we can't see because I brought the bump back with our makeover.
6123460	6126460	We have the bumper again. All right. I'll leave it on. Yeah.
6126460	6133460	Anyway, the game that I've chosen is Breath of Fire, which is another one I haven't done before.
6133460	6139460	But hey, and just a little hiccup on the stream here because I forgot to load the B roll.
6139460	6143460	Sorry. So it's it's blank on purpose for a reason. But here we go.
6143460	6145460	I got it. I got it. There we go. There's your. All right.
6145460	6154460	So so again, it's Breath of Fire, which is a role playing game developed by Capcom for the Super Famicom or Super Nintendo.
6154460	6158460	And it was released in Japan, April nineteen ninety three.
6158460	6163460	It could have been out for my birthday, but it came out on April 3rd.
6163460	6169460	And then in the US, it was released on August 10th, 1994.
6169460	6177460	So over a year later and there's been other versions of it released, but I'll get into them in a moment.
6177460	6181460	So it is Capcom's first traditional role playing game.
6181460	6187460	And it set the tone for future games because we have quite a few Breath of Fire games now.
6187460	6198460	The character designs were done by Inafune Keiji and music was done by Capcom's in-house sound team, Alf Lila.
6198460	6206460	There was a re-release, like I said, in 2001, it was released for the Game Boy Advanced with new save features and graphical enhancements.
6206460	6210460	And the English version finally being released in Europe for the first time.
6210460	6215460	And then it was released on the Nintendo 3DS virtual console.
6215460	6218460	And now in 2019, we have a Switch version.
6218460	6226460	So it is a fantasy story set in sort of a medieval time with a boy named Ryu.
6226460	6230460	Ryu can transform into a dragon.
6230460	6233460	He's one of the last members of this race that can transform into a dragon.
6233460	6238460	And he's off looking for his sister, I guess, who is the other member of their race that can turn into a dragon.
6238460	6240460	So he's not the only one.
6241460	6246460	So on his quest, he finds other people who will work with him.
6246460	6252460	And then he comes into conflict with the dark dragon clan, oh my god,
6252460	6259460	which is an empire that wants to take over the world by bringing back a crazy goddess.
6259460	6262460	And it was really well received.
6262460	6265460	And of course, it had a sequel, Breath of Fire 2, in 1994.
6266460	6276460	As far as the play of the game, it's basically two-dimensional sprites with a top-down perspective.
6276460	6281460	And you move your character in four directions while navigating through the environments.
6281460	6284460	You go from towns, dungeons, there's traps, there's monsters.
6284460	6291460	And you have to do these story-based scenarios that will have you go into these areas and defeat enemies.
6292460	6296460	And also interact with NPCs who are part of the plot.
6296460	6304460	And so you keep bringing in different characters that have different spells as well as unique actions that they can perform.
6304460	6308460	You can solve puzzles, you navigate some of the environments,
6308460	6315460	but some of these people are going to bring better access to the game.
6315460	6319460	And so you can have up to four members in your party at a time.
6319460	6326460	And then, of course, you have your icon menus that you can let you use your stock and character information
6326460	6332460	and shortcuts that let you assign unused buttons so you can access things.
6332460	6338460	Kind of like when I used to do all my macros on a controller for Final Fantasy XI.
6339460	6345460	And so the random encounters are every few steps.
6345460	6347460	It's a turn-based system in combat.
6347460	6354460	So basically you input the commands for each character and then they are carried out in order of their agility rating.
6354460	6362460	And so basically you just go through the game and beat the bad guy, save the world.
6362460	6366460	And I'm not going to go too much more into the story about it.
6366460	6370460	But it was developed by Capcom for the SNES.
6370460	6373460	The designer was Kawano Yoshinori.
6373460	6381460	And the producer was Fujiwara Tokuro, who had also been the creator of the Ghost and Goblin series.
6381460	6389460	So we, of course, also, like I said, Inahune did the game's characters.
6390460	6397460	And, I mean, it was a pretty nice group of folks that worked on it.
6397460	6400460	And then when it was localized to North America,
6400460	6406460	Capcom USA didn't really have a lot of experience with text-heavy role-play games.
6406460	6416460	And so it was actually Squaresoft, I think, that had gone...
6416460	6420460	Yeah, Squaresoft did the US release on it.
6420460	6426460	And so it was marketed as from the company that brought you Final Fantasy.
6426460	6430460	So not quite great there.
6430460	6434460	But Capcom took the reins back in 2001 for the Game Boy Advance port,
6434460	6439460	and had this intuitive play system and redrawn character portraits,
6439460	6444460	and the menu that works more like Breath of Fire 2, updated cutscene graphics.
6444460	6449460	And then you could do temporary saves with a quick save feature.
6449460	6458460	And Capcom had announced their English version right before E3 2001.
6459460	6462460	So yeah, the game was very well received.
6462460	6468460	You know, on average, it was... I'd probably say in the 80 percentile, you know.
6468460	6473460	It was modestly successful in the US, but very successful in Japan.
6473460	6477460	Of course, the Super Nintendo version suffered from...
6477460	6480460	And this is actually a quote from Play Magazine,
6480460	6482460	Flawed Execution.
6482460	6485460	And so, you know, take it as you will.
6485460	6487460	Take it as you will. A lot of people like Breath of Fire.
6487460	6490460	I hate the US artwork for it, because it's just that general,
6490460	6493460	Let's make them look western. Yeah.
6493460	6497460	So, whatever. Good game.
6497460	6498460	Play it.
6498460	6500460	So, can I confess something?
6500460	6501460	Do it.
6501460	6503460	I've never played it.
6503460	6505460	You want me to confess something else too?
6505460	6506460	What?
6506460	6507460	Neither have I.
6507460	6509460	Really? You picked it as your classic game?
6509460	6512460	I did, because it deserves to be a classic game.
6512460	6514460	I know a lot of people who love it.
6514460	6516460	Dan is a fan of it.
6516460	6519460	Our chat room is really lighting up too.
6519460	6521460	So, they approve. Yeah.
6521460	6526460	And so, you know, for that, just because I haven't personally played something,
6526460	6530460	it doesn't mean that it's not a good game.
6530460	6532460	You know, it's not worthy of being mentioned.
6532460	6536460	You know, some of the games I've done... Halo. Halo.
6536460	6538460	Rob.
6538460	6539460	I had to.
6539460	6541460	You left me no choice.
6541460	6543460	I left myself out for that one.
6543460	6545460	Okay?
6545460	6550460	Thanks to doing Halo, my mother could live in her house for another month.
6550460	6552460	I know. I know. We're very thankful to everybody.
6552460	6553460	Thank you, everybody.
6553460	6557460	I'm going back to the cameras by turning off the gameplay footage.
6557460	6559460	So, this is my DragonCon wig.
6559460	6561460	It needs some love.
6561460	6564460	She hasn't been worn in like a year, because...
6564460	6566460	But I love this wig.
6566460	6568460	It looks like... I think the color looks great on me.
6568460	6571460	And yes, and I am aware, actually, of what Bobby's saying in chat,
6571460	6573460	is that it's on Super Nintendo Online on Switch.
6573460	6575460	Yeah, at least I knew the first one was there.
6575460	6577460	I didn't realize both one and two were there.
6577460	6581460	So, yeah, maybe I will have to do like a playthrough at some point.
6581460	6583460	Maybe, Darsakha, you might have to join me.
6583460	6587460	Maybe we could do a virtual, like, playthrough together.
6587460	6589460	The thing is, is that I think that...
6589460	6592460	I don't remember if the first ones were, but I know later ones are RTS,
6592460	6594460	and I hate RTS games.
6594460	6598460	Oh, no, this one definitely doesn't look like it,
6598460	6601460	just from the gameplay footage that was rolling in the background, so, yeah.
6601460	6606460	But, I mean, maybe, but, I mean, right now, I'm still...
6606460	6609460	Yeah, they're both... Okay, they're turn-based good.
6609460	6613460	It's just the later ones are RTS, and I hate RTS games.
6613460	6616460	I am Dale in chat. I hope I said that name right.
6616460	6619460	I'm sorry, it's in a dark blue that's really hard to read. Sorry.
6619460	6622460	I'm not going to spoil it, but for a classic game, the story was great.
6622460	6624460	Play both games. It's great. Oh, yeah.
6624460	6627460	And, you know, just as DarkSakura said, and I totally agree with,
6627460	6629460	just because we don't get around to playing certain games
6629460	6631460	doesn't mean they're not good.
6631460	6633460	Sports games are a great example.
6633460	6636460	Like, I think between the three of us, including Loki,
6636460	6638460	there's very few sports games that we play.
6638460	6641460	Not to say we don't play any sports games.
6641460	6643460	I fucking love Tecmo Bowl back in the day,
6643460	6645460	and I still like NBA Jam is a lot of fun.
6645460	6647460	You know, I like the arcade...
6647460	6649460	Hey, you know what mine was? Super high impact.
6649460	6651460	Yeah, super high impact, right?
6651460	6656460	But when it comes to Madden 2019, not so much.
6656460	6659460	We don't really play those games. They're not bad games.
6659460	6661460	They're just not the games we play, and that's okay.
6661460	6663460	It's like music, right?
6663460	6666460	I don't know shit about country western music.
6666460	6668460	Well, unless it's Reba McEntire.
6668460	6672460	But, you know, that doesn't mean it's necessarily all bad.
6672460	6677460	Oh, my exes live in Texas.
6677460	6679460	I mean, there is a lot of bad country.
6679460	6681460	You know what? There's a lot of bad pop music, too.
6681460	6685460	And I like pop music, and there's a lot of bad pop music, so it's fine.
6685460	6689460	I grew up spending my summers in Dothan, Alabama.
6689460	6697460	I listen to a lot of country, but it's what introduced me to the original version of Black Velvet,
6697460	6699460	which I love to this day.
6699460	6703460	Nice. Alright. Anyway, your classic game of the week, Breath of Fire.
6703460	6705460	Yay!
6705460	6708460	How we got from Breath of Fire to country music, only OLR knows.
6708460	6711460	Alright, we're going to do some rapid fire news.
6711460	6715460	And nice thing, usually we'd be saying goodbye to Jamie about now,
6715460	6719460	but Jamie's actually going to be with us all night long, changing out weeks.
6719460	6721460	I did a thing. I did a thing.
6721460	6727460	I got tomorrow off because I have a doctor's appointment that actually may have been canceled, so I don't know.
6727460	6729460	So, yeah.
6729460	6733460	And I'm still, I'm going to keep this wig on for a while. I love this one.
6733460	6734460	Yeah, that's a good wig.
6734460	6736460	She's good. She's good.
6736460	6742460	I wish, I wish, I hope somebody's been taking screenshots throughout the show so we can have a Twitter poll later to rate Jamie's wigs.
6742460	6744460	Alright, anyway.
6744460	6746460	Maybe I'll put some selfies up there.
6746460	6748460	That's a good idea. Alright, moving on.
6748460	6753460	We have some rapid fire news, so let's talk about some other news that's happening in the industry.
6753460	6755460	Quickly-ish.
6755460	6761460	I say quickly, but it's OLR. Sometimes the segment goes on longer than the other news stories. It's whatever.
6761460	6763460	Loki, why don't you start us off?
6763460	6768460	Alright, so we've got a few new games coming to the Nintendo Switch Online Collection.
6768460	6775460	So, for Super Nintendo, we're going to be getting Donkey Kong Country and Natsume Championship Wrestling.
6775460	6779460	And then, on the NES, we're getting The Immortal.
6779460	6782460	I have not played The Immortal.
6782460	6783460	The other two I've played, though.
6783460	6787460	Isn't that based on a movie or a comic, The Immortal? I feel like it is.
6787460	6792460	Uh, it looks like it could be.
6792460	6795460	It's Will Harvey Presents The Immortal.
6795460	6797460	I don't know.
6797460	6801460	I've seen a little bit of that game before.
6801460	6806460	I don't think I ever really played a lot of it, but I'll check it out on Switch Online. Of course I will. Why not?
6806460	6808460	Yep.
6808460	6815460	And then, we've got Halo 3 coming to PC on the 14th.
6815460	6820460	So, it's going to be a part of the Master Chief Collection.
6820460	6822460	So, pretty neat.
6822460	6826460	I like how they've been adding to that collection piece by piece on PC.
6826460	6829460	It's been very interesting because I've played it there.
6829460	6831460	So, it's interesting.
6831460	6834460	Yeah. So, pretty cool.
6834460	6842460	Alright. Limited Run Games is going to be doing a physical edition of the Castlevania Anniversary Collection.
6842460	6847460	Now, many of you probably already own this collection because it's been out digitally for a little bit.
6847460	6850460	But, you know, for the collectors, that's what Limited Run Games is for.
6850460	6861460	And they announced on their own little streaming event they did earlier this week is that they are going to be putting out this collection of Konami Castlevania games for the Nintendo Switch and the PlayStation 4.
6861460	6868460	Castlevania Collection was originally released in May 2019, but this is going to be a limited physical edition, which is neat.
6868460	6873460	You know, I mean, probably not for me, but I love that it's a thing that they do.
6873460	6880460	Speaking of Limited Run Games, they announced, what, like 30 different physical editions that they're doing.
6880460	6882460	So, it's not just this.
6882460	6885460	They're going to be doing Samurai Jack from Adult Swim Games.
6885460	6887460	They're going to be doing Towerfall Ascension.
6887460	6889460	To the Moon, that's a big one.
6889460	6894460	Space Channel 5 VR is getting a Limited Run Games edition, the PSVR game.
6894460	6897460	The Grandia HD Collection for Switch.
6897460	6899460	Bloodstained Curse of the Moon 2.
6899460	6905460	So, I mean, I know Dark Sakura, you and Dan are trying to do less stuff, but it's just a video game.
6907460	6909460	Yeah, but we already have the game. We already bought it.
6909460	6910460	True, true.
6910460	6916460	I think the most fascinating one on the entire list, Papers, Please.
6916460	6920460	But the reason why it's fascinating, it's a Vita physical release.
6920460	6922460	Yes, they're putting out Papers, Please.
6922460	6924460	I think that's fucking rad.
6924460	6927460	Garu Mark of the Wolves, the PlayStation 4 ported that.
6927460	6928460	Oh, yeah.
6928460	6929460	Pretty cool, right?
6929460	6931460	Super Meat Boy Forever.
6931460	6934460	A Boy and His Blob, the PlayStation 4 redo.
6934460	6937460	Shantae, Shantae's Risky Revenge, and Extreme Sports.
6937460	6940460	So, there's a lot of stuff that Limited Run Games is doing.
6940460	6943460	That must mean that their physical editions do very well.
6943460	6945460	Well, not necessarily.
6945460	6947460	Very is a relative term, right?
6947460	6950460	Well enough for them to keep going with more.
6950460	6952460	So, neat.
6952460	6953460	All right.
6953460	6954460	Anyhow, moving on.
6954460	6957460	One of the games I mentioned there was Shantae.
6957460	6962460	And yes, the classic Shantae titles are coming to Nintendo Switch in the fall.
6962460	6965460	Some of the earliest Shantae games, actually.
6965460	6969460	The very first game, which I think Dark Soccer did as a game of the week, sometime this year.
6969460	6970460	I don't think it was that long ago.
6970460	6972460	I'm pretty sure that I did.
6972460	6975460	Yeah, it was originally released for the Game Boy Color in 2002.
6975460	6979460	It is going to be released on the eShop at some point this fall.
6979460	6984460	Don't know when, but it does also tie into Limited Run Games is also going to be putting that out.
6984460	6985460	That's really cool.
6985460	6988460	They will also, this is a trip.
6988460	6991460	It's not only are they going to be doing the Switch version of the game.
6991460	6997460	They are going to facilitate a new run of cartridges for the Game Boy Color.
6997460	7000460	So if you want to get a legit, legit Shantae.
7000460	7004460	Well, I mean, it is a repressing, but you know, still, that's pretty cool.
7004460	7010460	And they are saying it's because, you know, Shantae's kind of built up a following that it didn't have when it originally came out.
7011460	7015460	Shantae's Risky Revenge, also coming to Nintendo Switch and Xbox One.
7015460	7018460	That originally was a DSi title, but they will be doing that.
7018460	7020460	And again, Limited Run involved with that.
7020460	7023460	So Shantae fans have a lot to be happy about.
7023460	7026460	Insert the mandatory Shantae, you stay joke.
7026460	7030460	All right, what do we have from Dark Soccer?
7030460	7033460	We have some other stuff.
7033460	7037460	Bloodstained, Cursed of the Moon 2, which is fun.
7037460	7048460	Is getting version 1.2.0 released on the 16th that has, July 16th that is, as boss rush mode and some bug fixes.
7048460	7050460	Just keep your eyes open for it.
7050460	7059460	And then the director and writer for the Ace Attorney series, Yamazaki Takeshi, has left Capcom.
7059460	7064460	He was with the company for 15 years.
7064460	7070460	And he's quoted as saying, although leaving a company is always painful, I like to think of this as graduating.
7070460	7075460	I'm truly glad I was able to make games and meet the Ace Attorney series at Capcom.
7075460	7079460	And he's going to keep working in game development, looking for other challenges.
7079460	7082460	Best of luck to him.
7082460	7087460	Maybe we'll get some type of new series that has similarities to Ace Attorney.
7087460	7088460	Yet different.
7088460	7089460	All right.
7089460	7090460	Yet different.
7090460	7096460	Well, let's travel around the world and check out some games coming out a little sooner than that as we do some world release dates.
7096460	7099460	And why don't we start in the US with Loki?
7099460	7104460	So this week we've got Death Stranding coming out on PC.
7104460	7108460	Rocket Arena on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7108460	7113460	Story of Seasons, Friends of Mineral Town on PC and Nintendo Switch.
7113460	7119460	We've got Dragon Quest Tacked on iOS and Android.
7119460	7125460	Superhot Mind Control Delete on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7125460	7132460	And by the way, if you own a copy of the original Superhot on any of those platforms and not necessarily from, I think, one of the free services.
7132460	7135460	Probably Humble if you did get that.
7135460	7137460	You get this for free.
7137460	7138460	So that's pretty cool.
7138460	7140460	So check your library.
7140460	7143460	Ghosts of Tsushima on PlayStation 4.
7143460	7146460	Death Come True on PC.
7146460	7152460	And last but not least, Paper Mario, the Origami King on Nintendo Switch.
7152460	7155460	I think there's a couple of people looking forward to that. That's for sure.
7155460	7157460	I am looking forward to that.
7157460	7162460	So assuming I can pry that switch away from my kids and my wife.
7162460	7163460	I might check it out.
7163460	7168460	It's hard to tear myself away from Animal Crossing, which I know I didn't talk a lot about my gaming week.
7168460	7172460	But I'm kind of I'm back on Animal Crossing because I actually I kind of enjoy the diving thing.
7172460	7174460	I kind of like breathe a little new life.
7174460	7176460	But I don't have the same concerns Star Soccer had.
7176460	7178460	Like, I don't have enough people.
7178460	7181460	I don't have enough people that want to come visit to worry about my island is kind of a dump anyway.
7181460	7184460	And like, you can't make the dump look worse.
7184460	7186460	So I'm not worried about it.
7186460	7188460	But I think you cover your beach and stingweed.
7188460	7191460	Yeah, I've been enjoying I've been enjoying the diving mechanic.
7191460	7193460	It's fun. I like collecting the wetsuits, too.
7193460	7195460	All right. By the way, Rob.
7195460	7197460	I got I have a Pascal card.
7197460	7199460	And if you want a poster, I'll send you a poster.
7199460	7201460	I think you have sent me one.
7201460	7203460	You've been very good about the Pascal card.
7203460	7205460	Oh, OK.
7205460	7208460	I don't think I got a Katie card to sell some new Katie poster.
7208460	7209460	That's fun. All right.
7209460	7211460	Nice if she comes back in the game anyway.
7211460	7214460	Let's talk about Nintendo Switch releases coming out in Japan.
7214460	7220460	So in Japan, we have together the battle cats comes out in Japan this week.
7220460	7224460	And I'm curious if that means finally we're getting our laser cat stream game.
7224460	7226460	But I don't think this is actually that.
7226460	7230460	But it does say this game features over three hundred and fifty creepy,
7230460	7232460	cute cat characters.
7232460	7236460	You train and strengthen your cats through gacha games,
7236460	7238460	cat coins, tickets.
7238460	7240460	Yeah. All right.
7240460	7245460	Also coming out on the switch, Code Realize Shirogane no Kisuke comes out this week,
7245460	7249460	as well as a game called Indivisible is out this week in Japan.
7249460	7251460	I think that's coming out other places, too.
7251460	7254460	So that's the releases for the Nintendo Switch.
7254460	7260460	Looking at the PlayStation 4, we have Indivisible is also out on PlayStation 4.
7260460	7266460	And then Ghosts of Tsushima is also out this week on the same day as it is in the U.S.
7266460	7267460	The 17th.
7267460	7269460	And those are your big releases in Japan this week.
7269460	7271460	How about Europe, Dark Sakura?
7271460	7273460	There's a few.
7273460	7281460	On July 13th, we have Rocket Arena, also the PC version of Death Stranding.
7281460	7285460	On the 16th, we have Paper Mario, the Origami King,
7285460	7288460	Warhammer 40,000, Mechanicus.
7288460	7295460	And also on the 16th, Ghosts of Tsushima, which I really am interested in.
7295460	7297460	But backlog.
7299460	7301460	The struggle.
7301460	7303460	All right.
7303460	7305460	Every week we read the mail bag.
7305460	7307460	I don't know if Dark Sakura remembers how to do it.
7307460	7309460	It's been so long.
7309460	7312460	I can read and we have one.
7312460	7317460	I know you know how to read, but I'm like, do you remember the password to the mail bag?
7317460	7319460	I don't have to. I have autofill.
7319460	7321460	Oh, OK. All right.
7321460	7328460	Well, if as a reminder, if you need the password to the mail bag, it's Loki is a butt.
7328460	7330460	That's the password. OK. All right.
7330460	7335460	Anyway, participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place where you can send your emails every week.
7335460	7338460	And it sounds like Dark Sakura has one to read for us tonight.
7338460	7340460	I do.
7342460	7345460	And I think you might have hit your button trying to do it.
7345460	7346460	Yeah. Yeah.
7346460	7350460	So I have funny hype mayhem.
7350460	7352460	The password is one, two, three, four, five.
7352460	7353460	The same as my luggage.
7353460	7354460	Yay, Spaceballs.
7354460	7360460	By the way, off topic, I saw Spaceballs, the mask, and I'm probably going to get it.
7360460	7362460	OK. Anyway, that's a good one.
7362460	7364460	I'd get that, too.
7364460	7366460	Hello, LR.
7366460	7368460	OK, I have to find it again.
7368460	7372460	One of the calmer parts of last week's episode was a debate about the price of next gen games
7372460	7378460	and whether AAA games have any right to move up to seventy dollars from their previous MSRP of 60.
7378460	7379460	Hold on. Hold on.
7379460	7383460	Did the emailer say one of the calmer parts of the last episode?
7383460	7385460	Is that what it said?
7385460	7387460	Mm hmm.
7387460	7392460	I think that's a commentary on our last episode, Loki.
7392460	7397460	This is what happens when I'm not here to babysit you.
7397460	7399460	All right. No, I.
7399460	7405460	I don't know if you know about my my friend online that passed away and covid was suspected, but I,
7405460	7411460	I really got angry about all that stuff last week, and I know you're angry, too, because you're dealing with it, too.
7411460	7414460	So anyway. Anyway. Sorry. Go ahead.
7414460	7421460	It's just it's just hard for me to think of my mother there by herself, uninsured because of anyway.
7421460	7424460	Before I make a point, let's get one thing out of the way.
7424460	7429460	Buyable virtual currency loot boxes and gotcha mechanics are in full price.
7429460	7438460	AAA games are absolute and total bullshit. Either get rid of that garbage or make that component of a free of a game free to play.
7438460	7446460	That nonsense aside, full price AAA games went up from fifty dollars to sixty dollars with the launch of the Xbox 360 all the way back in 2005.
7446460	7449460	Well, in 2005, you could still get a candy bar for a dollar.
7449460	7452460	Since then, the cost of everything has gone way up.
7452460	7458460	The impact of inflation has been so significant that in order to match the overall purchasing power of sixty U.S.
7458460	7462460	dollars back in 2005, you would need about 80 U.S. dollars today.
7462460	7469460	So the price of games today is actually decreased significantly since 2005, even more so if you consider the fact that these days,
7469460	7474460	almost every non Nintendo game starts getting discounted mere weeks after its release.
7474460	7477460	Hell, you can get Anthem for five dollars right now.
7477460	7485460	If an increase to seventy dollars means that there's a greater chance we will be able to continue purchasing big budget story driven AAA games,
7485460	7487460	then I am honestly all for it.
7487460	7493460	I'd rather pay a little more to have games on day one than see everything turn into a gotcha loot box game as a service.
7493460	7495460	What do you folks think?
7495460	7498460	And that really that echoes a lot of what I said last week.
7498460	7501460	So, yeah.
7501460	7505460	Well, yeah, I.
7505460	7513460	I don't mind paying for things that are worth it, so they're still going to do it, even if they charge 80 or 90 dollars for the game,
7513460	7516460	they're still going to have all those because they can get money from you both ways.
7516460	7519460	Why not? They're going to do it.
7519460	7527460	See, that's the thing is, like, even though you're saying that games would have been equivalently the same amount or less money now than they were back
7527460	7534460	when the Xbox 360 launch, we didn't have like a ton of DLC coming out for these titles.
7534460	7540460	They weren't pushing that stuff like they were at the beginning of that generation as they are now.
7540460	7545460	Like, I mean, hell, back in that generation, the very beginning, you still had cheat codes in games.
7545460	7549460	Nowadays, you have to buy that as DLC.
7549460	7555460	It's slowly been piecemealing, you know, stuff from the games, adding it to the cost.
7555460	7559460	Yeah, your initial buying costs may be slightly cheaper if you account for inflation,
7559460	7566460	but then you have all the other additional stuff on top of that in order to get the same experience you would have gotten back when that console originally launched.
7566460	7571460	I think, though, and this kind of briefly came up here in the email and so forth,
7571460	7577460	is that the games industry in some ways is almost kind of like policing their own prices.
7577460	7582460	And we talked about that a little bit last week's show is that, you know, video games can be like 10 bucks, you know,
7582460	7588460	or they can be even cheaper than that on places like itch.io and other independent sites online, Steam and so forth, you know.
7588460	7591460	But there's a lot of video games out there that are 10, 20 bucks.
7591460	7595460	Heck, I just recommended a game at the top of the show that I think is more in the $20 price category.
7595460	7598460	So there's all these different games of all these different price ranges.
7598460	7603460	And what I mean by policing itself is, in the email I brought up, you could get Anthem now for five bucks,
7603460	7607460	because pretty quickly word got out that this game ain't worth 60 bucks.
7607460	7613460	And they're having a hard time getting people to pay five bucks for it, which is kind of sad for all those, you know,
7613460	7616460	developers and people to spend a lot of time making the game.
7616460	7623460	But at the same time, they kind of had to come in the high level executive decisions to change some of those things.
7623460	7629460	And, you know, the fact that we all knew Anthem would end up being a games as a service type of thing,
7629460	7632460	and they tried to charge the full price and have all these other things going on.
7632460	7638460	So I kind of feel like when word gets out and it can impact the sales of games.
7638460	7642460	And so the price of the game ends up having to like change itself.
7642460	7649460	Whereas there's other games, a lot of Nintendo titles that still charge full price to this day,
7649460	7651460	and people pay it because they're worth it.
7651460	7655460	Has Zelda Breath of the Wild ever gone on sale?
7655460	7661460	Maybe for like Black Friday or a holiday sale, but outside of that, probably not.
7661460	7667460	It has because I purchased it on sale, so I know it has.
7667460	7670460	But certainly you get the point I'm making, though.
7670460	7673460	Like, it's rare, it's few and far between.
7673460	7678460	They could still charge 60 bucks for that game and probably get it.
7678460	7679460	Yeah.
7679460	7680460	All right.
7680460	7683460	Anyhow, and as Joe 100 Matt says, it's dropped to maybe 40.
7683460	7684460	Yes, you can. Sorry.
7684460	7685460	Okay.
7685460	7689460	Also, I must say, as much as I enjoyed the classic game of the week last episode,
7689460	7690460	I was a bit disappointed.
7690460	7694460	It was included in Namco Museum Archives Volume 2, you said.
7694460	7696460	It was a game not developed by Namco, you said.
7696460	7699460	But sadly, it was not my favorite game from that collection
7699460	7703460	and the reason I thought nothing of dropping $20 on it day one.
7703460	7705460	Game Freak's phenomenal Mendel Palace.
7705460	7710460	Actually, I decided years ago that if for some reason I was ever in studio
7710460	7713460	and asked to pick a classic game of the week, it would be that one.
7713460	7715460	And here we were so close.
7715460	7718460	Rob, if you decide to buy Volume 2 in the future,
7718460	7720460	I highly recommend that you check it out.
7720460	7723460	It's one of my favorite arcade-style games of all time.
7723460	7724460	Have a great week, everybody.
7724460	7725460	Aaron, YYR.
7725460	7730460	So just so you know, Dark Sakura, last week when you weren't going to be here,
7730460	7733460	I switched out the classic game real quick and I did Legacy of the Wizard
7733460	7736460	because it had come up in that Namco collection discussion
7736460	7739460	and I owned that game when I was a kid, so I was talking about that.
7739460	7743460	So I think YYR is a little disappointed because, as he says,
7743460	7747460	also in that collection is Mendel Palace, but I didn't own that game as a kid.
7747460	7749460	I'm not as familiar with that game.
7749460	7753460	I can't talk off the cusp on that game as well, but who knows?
7753460	7755460	You never know what might happen in the future.
7755460	7757460	Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
7757460	7758460	Maybe.
7758460	7759460	All right.
7759460	7760460	Was that it?
7760460	7762460	Now I'm going to do E.T.
7762460	7763460	Yeah, that was it.
7763460	7766460	I thought I saw one come in right at showtime.
7766460	7770460	When I just hit delete on the email, it was empty.
7770460	7772460	That was the one that came in.
7772460	7773460	Okay, that's weird.
7773460	7775460	Because somebody doesn't clean out the email box.
7775460	7776460	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
7776460	7777460	All right.
7777460	7779460	If we did accidentally miss anyone, we'll get to it.
7779460	7782460	Because the thing I saw had an attachment anyway
7782460	7785460	that's going to need to be looked at this week, so we'll come back to it.
7785460	7788460	So not ignoring anyone on purpose, I promise.
7788460	7789460	All right.
7789460	7790460	You'll have to check the trash then.
7790460	7793460	Yeah, I'll check the trash because we might have just accidentally missed it.
7793460	7797460	But I think there is one because I just noticed it right at 6 o'clock.
7797460	7798460	So anyway.
7798460	7799460	We'll take a look.
7799460	7801460	Yeah, it's no biggie.
7801460	7805460	If you read it, you'll be like, oh, there's something in it that Rob needs time to look at.
7805460	7807460	And I didn't have time before the show.
7807460	7808460	All right.
7808460	7810460	So if we kick it to next week, it's not a big deal.
7810460	7811460	All right.
7811460	7812460	Moving on.
7812460	7814460	Let's get to some more gaming news.
7814460	7816460	In the meantime, you can email us.
7816460	7819460	Actually, I found an email that I didn't read, actually.
7819460	7821460	Okay, do you want to read it?
7821460	7822460	I think it's the one I'm thinking of.
7822460	7823460	Yeah, go for it.
7823460	7824460	I don't see any attachments on it.
7824460	7829460	Hey, OLR, not sure if this will be on your showroom this week.
7829460	7832460	But yeah, it does have a link to it.
7832460	7834460	Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
7834460	7835460	That's all right.
7835460	7836460	You read it.
7836460	7837460	It's fine.
7837460	7838460	All right.
7838460	7839460	But this week was the GMTK Game Jam.
7839460	7844460	It was started by the guy behind the Game Makers Toolkit YouTube channel and is now
7844460	7846460	almost as big as Ludlam Dare.
7846460	7851460	This year, 70,000 people registered and over 5,000 games were submitted at the end of the
7851460	7852460	weekend.
7852460	7855460	I joined it almost this close.
7855460	7857460	One of them is mine.
7857460	7858460	It's called Momentum.
7858460	7860460	It's a platform game similar to Celeste.
7860460	7863460	Put out a link, which we'll check it out first.
7863460	7866460	And if you want to share it, then that's fine.
7866460	7868460	Anyone wants to look in.
7868460	7873460	So this is my first proper game jam, and it was a stressful 48 hours, especially when
7873460	7876460	I decided to ditch my first idea halfway through.
7876460	7878460	I'm super proud of the game I built, though.
7878460	7883460	Plus, it was nice to have a lockdown weekend where I didn't lie around doing nothing for
7883460	7884460	once.
7884460	7886460	I hope you're all doing well.
7886460	7890460	OLR continues to be my port in this very stormy year, Elliot B.
7890460	7892460	Well, thank you for that.
7892460	7896460	And congratulations on actually completing a game, unlike someone else on this panel
7896460	7898460	whose shower name is Aimless.
7898460	7900460	Someone missed this opportunity.
7900460	7902460	That's more than what I did.
7902460	7904460	Yeah, I'm sorry.
7904460	7905460	And I'm sorry.
7905460	7908460	I saved all the emails that didn't look like they had been checked.
7908460	7909460	So I apologize.
7909460	7911460	I'm glad I went back and looked for it.
7911460	7915460	Darsakha and I have different ways of managing the email account, as in she manages it and
7916460	7919460	But Bobby Shade Wolf in our chat room says,
7919460	7923460	You do realize that game jams expect you to finish something by the deadline, usually,
7923460	7925460	right, Loki?
7925460	7928460	Hey, Loki could have gotten a pizza.
7928460	7930460	I offered him pizza.
7930460	7931460	That's right.
7931460	7933460	Oh, yeah, the pizza.
7933460	7934460	Oh, my.
7934460	7935460	That was my favorite.
7935460	7938460	That was one of my favorite jokes ever on this show.
7938460	7939460	It's a contest.
7939460	7943460	One person is eligible.
7943460	7949460	I can even extend time to pizza because I can have it delivered to your house.
7949460	7952460	So I will extend time to pizza for this year.
7952460	7953460	Elliot, here's the bummer.
7953460	7957460	Thank you for emailing us and congratulations on your successful game jam.
7957460	7960460	But here's the gag since I didn't see your email till just before we went on air.
7960460	7962460	I haven't been able to play your game.
7962460	7968460	So I'm sure it's great, like, but I can't comment on it further.
7968460	7970460	But congratulations on completing that.
7970460	7973460	And it does sound like there's a lot of people that participate in this game jam.
7973460	7976460	And I'm not surprised, especially in quarantine time,
7976460	7979460	that you have so many people that are participating in game jams.
7979460	7981460	Hell, Loki actually almost did it.
7981460	7984460	And he might have, like, at least put an idea down or something.
7984460	7986460	I did put an idea down.
7986460	7988460	Oh, oh.
7988460	7995460	I didn't make anything, but I put the idea down because it was the idea.
7995460	7997460	Now we want to know.
7998460	8000460	Well, first I have to make it sure it's the same game jam
8000460	8002460	because there's, like, several game jams going on at the same time.
8002460	8008460	So I think it was, if I'm correct, it was the one that was Out of Control, I think was the theme.
8008460	8010460	Yes, OK, so it was.
8010460	8012460	So it was Out of Control was the theme.
8012460	8019460	And I was inspired by this game I played on the Ouya called No Brakes Valet.
8019460	8023460	So the whole premise was going to be a, like, just a racing game.
8023460	8026460	But it's all gas, no brakes.
8026460	8028460	So that was going to be the game.
8028460	8033460	It's a racing game the way I play racing games, which is I don't use the brakes at all.
8033460	8035460	I just smash into the walls and stuff.
8035460	8041460	And so not so much a racing game, but kind of like a puzzle game where you would have to get to your house
8041460	8047460	or something like that without killing yourself, which means colliding with another car.
8047460	8052460	But of course, there'd be collateral damage with, like, pedestrians on the street and stuff like that.
8052460	8055460	Are you sure you aren't describing roundabout?
8055460	8058460	Because I'm kind of, did you ever play roundabout with the limo?
8058460	8061460	No, I did play roundabout. That's a whole, it's a different type of game.
8061460	8063460	I know what you're talking about there.
8063460	8070460	Shane has spent years trying to convince me that game is funny when I'm like, it's more awkward than it is funny.
8070460	8075460	It's OK. It was an OK game. I played it, but like, no.
8075460	8078460	Cue a text message in three, two, one.
8078460	8082460	Yeah. No Brakes Valet was the one I played because that was kind of fun.
8082460	8086460	You had to park a car, but you fit.
8086460	8091460	Well, that one, you could use brakes, although I didn't figure out that there was a brake button for the longest time.
8091460	8098460	But you tried to park your car in specific spaces and then one of them has no brakes.
8098460	8102460	And you and you're just smashing cars in this like this parking lot.
8102460	8104460	It's kind of funny. Yeah. OK. Inspiration.
8105460	8108460	That's going to take too long. Not going to have the time to actually take.
8108460	8114460	I was going to get about like half of the time in the jam anyways to even work on anything and probably less than that.
8114460	8116460	So I just didn't start it.
8116460	8121460	Elliot in chat says, Loki, that would have totally fit the theme of GMTK Jam.
8121460	8124460	That was the name of it this year. The theme was out of control.
8124460	8126460	So this is the same game jam.
8126460	8130460	Yeah, it was. Yeah. I followed their channel. I watched a lot of their videos and stuff.
8130460	8134460	So we'll go play Elliot's game. It's the link is in chat.
8134460	8137460	I'll read it because it's not too hard to remember.
8137460	8142460	Paw prints. So P.A.W.P.R.I.N.T.S. dot itch dot IO.
8142460	8149460	Everybody knows that site, right? Paw prints dot itch IO slash momentum is the place to go to check out Elliot's game,
8149460	8158460	which he said was a little bit kind of kind of inspired by Celeste a little bit or a lot of like I seriously a lot of these game jams are starting to mix together.
8158460	8163460	There's there's another one that's Kenny. They're doing a Kenny land.
8163460	8167460	So Kenny is the guy. He does a lot of like CC zero assets out there.
8167460	8172460	So he's very famous and like the indie community as far as providing free art assets.
8172460	8176460	So he has a gym coming out that's going to be using his art assets.
8176460	8182460	Then there's the code list jam, which is being done by our local.
8182460	8185460	I don't remember the called now, but the SAC Gaming Collective or something like that.
8185460	8188460	So they have their developers collective. Yeah. Yeah.
8188460	8195460	So they're doing one that's it's a game jam that you have to use the visual scripting tools.
8195460	8204460	So like Bolt and I guess I'm trying to think what the UE4 stuff is.
8204460	8211460	Their blueprints and stuff like that. So you have to use that, which that's kind of a learning curve in itself.
8211460	8215460	But that's coming up. I like I seriously like all of these start crisscrossing.
8215460	8222460	Like I thought that the CC that the one game jam was the Kenny jam for like this time around, too.
8222460	8228460	So I don't know. But yeah, it's fun. I just wish I had the time.
8228460	8238460	Don't need to need to be longer. Like, you know, like I wish I could get in on the progressive game jams that the Sacramento group does,
8238460	8244460	because it's basically just getting together with a bunch of people like for five hours every month or week or whatever.
8244460	8253460	I think it's month and just starting to like collaborate that way over a long period of time versus like being able to have to cram in 48 hours.
8253460	8258460	I just I can't. Yeah, that's just like well, that's just like having like a regular DND game, basically.
8258460	8262460	But instead of playing a DND campaign, you're working as a group to create a new game.
8262460	8271460	Yeah, that that fits more like your lifestyle where, you know, you have to worry about raising kids and stuff and you can't exactly pull, you know, 48 hours straight and all that.
8271460	8275460	So I wish I could. I mean, I get it. I get it. That would be great. All right.
8275460	8278460	Well, let's move on with the show. We do have some more news we want to get into here.
8278460	8284460	Thank you so much for the email, Elliot. And I hope a lot of our listeners choose to play your game, which you got in chat there a moment ago.
8284460	8291460	And I will play it later this week. Promise. OK, let's move on and get into some other news.
8291460	8297460	And Loki, I think you're gonna start us off with this story. Yes. So this is interesting.
8297460	8304460	So there's this brand new Tetris mole game, I guess that is.
8304460	8314460	I guess it's a it's a brand new show that they're doing where you compete with other players to earn money by playing Tetris.
8314460	8324460	So every night, I guess at seven thirty, there's a show that's hosted by this actor, Millen Baird in New Zealand.
8324460	8329460	And players will fight each other for five thousand dollar daily prize pool.
8329460	8336460	And you play the current cities that you play in. Auckland, Perth, Moscow, Berlin, London, New York City and Los Angeles.
8336460	8343460	So whatever city you're closest to would be the city that you're competing in. And app is, I guess, free on Android and iOS.
8343460	8351460	And it's called Network Tetris and network with the E is a three.
8351460	8360460	So, yeah, you can try your chance to get money or what's actually probably going to happen is the people that are really good at Tetris are going to beat the crap out of you.
8360460	8367460	Yeah, somebody's going to somebody's going to cheat it or something. I wonder who cheated, but it's just going to be like you're going to have those kids.
8367460	8374460	Does anyone know if Kevin D.R. has found this game yet and attacked it? I'd be so curious.
8374460	8379460	So, yeah, I because I know he's very, very, very good at Tetris and could probably.
8379460	8384460	Yes, a lot of people. It is actually it's just the official Tetris game.
8384460	8390460	The company that makes it, though, is Network Inc, which is, you know, so just look for Tetris.
8391460	8398460	It's HQ trivia meets Tetris 99, basically, I guess. Yeah. Interesting. All right.
8398460	8402460	We'll see. We'll see what happens. All right. Moving on. Let's talk about now.
8402460	8414460	I don't I don't always need to talk about ninjas every step and move as as big news because I personally don't really follow the guy just because I'm not shading him.
8414460	8418460	It's just I follow other people that I just know and, you know, so forth.
8418460	8424460	I kind of keep it around like a similar circle to what I follow on Twitter. But I'm not an idiot.
8424460	8427460	I know that Ninja does have a lot of people that do follow him.
8427460	8433460	And wherever ninjas goes to stream is probably going to lead a big crowd with him.
8433460	8440460	Now, he was on Mixer, as we all know, and Mixer is not going to be any more pretty soon.
8440460	8446460	And Ninja turned down basically the opportunity to go right over to Facebook gaming.
8446460	8451460	And I don't blame him because he wants to probably will a face Facebook gaming sucks, too.
8451460	8456460	He probably wants to see what kind of money they're willing to give him first.
8456460	8465460	So anyway, some reports that are showing up this week is that now this is this is kind of a you know, this is coming from an e-sports consultant's Twitter account.
8465460	8466460	Take it with a grain of salt.
8466460	8472460	But based I mean, it isn't it isn't outside the on the plausibility scale. It ranks high.
8472460	8479460	So Ninja says is in negotiate. They are in negotiations with streaming platforms and no exclusive deal has yet been signed.
8479460	8482460	But I'm like, how many streaming platforms are there that are left?
8482460	8489460	Twitch, which he was with before YouTube and Facebook gaming, unless we don't count that last.
8489460	8494460	And I don't count flop book gaming. I'm sorry. It's that would be a horrible decision.
8494460	8501460	Like, but I could I could go off again, but I'd just be repeating myself from the last several weeks.
8501460	8505460	Friends don't look flat. Friends stream on flop book gaming.
8505460	8512460	So Ninja, but Ninja just you know what, if they want to pay him tons of money, then Ninja is willing to go there.
8512460	8518460	It sounds like it'll just see what happens. In the meantime, Ninja started a YouTube stream.
8518460	8521460	And so it's just kind of like, let's see what kind of numbers I can pull on YouTube.
8521460	8527460	Just, you know, doing a stream. And apparently one hundred and sixty thousand concurrent viewers showed up.
8527460	8530460	Although it did drop down to one hundred and twenty thousand people.
8530460	8535460	But I doubt that many people have ever listened to OLR in the world.
8535460	8541460	So that's still a really big number of people to be pulling in for one of your streams.
8541460	8545460	So that's pretty big. So, yeah, who knows where he'll end up.
8545460	8549460	And then there's always been those rumors about some type of like new streaming platform.
8549460	8556460	But seeing as those rumors also said we'd have an announcement by now, I'm sure those rumors were just full of crap.
8556460	8559460	But we'll we'll see what comes of this, because, you know, again,
8559460	8567460	although I don't think it's necessarily worth reporting on this guy's every move and step, he does carry a big audience.
8567460	8573460	And it is. I mean, if he does sign with flop book, it's going to be a pretty big deal.
8573460	8575460	So, you know, we'll see what happens with that.
8575460	8582460	So, Tiger Claw says there's others, too. There's SmashCast.tv.
8582460	8586460	Now, who knows if these companies could afford Ninja, though?
8586460	8591460	However, then with a with an up and comer like a SmashCast.
8591460	8594460	I don't know this company's financials. They're investors.
8594460	8602460	But let's say you have a startup. Something you can start to negotiate with with Ninja is a percentage of the stake in the company.
8602460	8604460	You know, like an episode of Shark Tank, right?
8604460	8608460	You get Ninja to join your up and coming thing for a 10 percent stake in the company.
8608460	8613460	And as his exposure helps up your total number of viewers, then your total valuation of your company goes up.
8613460	8617460	So it's like that stock he's holding goes up and up and up, basically.
8617460	8622460	So that could be an interesting thing to leverage with a newer company.
8622460	8625460	So we'll see. So. All right.
8625460	8630460	Act F says GFM cast is lucky if we get more than three concurrent viewers.
8630460	8633460	G.G. Ramas says, I feel you. And you know what?
8633460	8640460	And I tell all the podcasters in the world that I know this is that as even if there's just one person there,
8640460	8643460	that's still one person that wants to tune in to hear to what you have to say.
8643460	8649460	And also, sometimes it's about, you know, because we we were in those levels for years and years and years.
8650460	8655460	And sometimes it's about getting the group together to talk about to just hang,
8655460	8659460	to hang as a group and talk about the things that you enjoy and that.
8659460	8661460	I'd like to think we'd still be doing a well,
8661460	8665460	or even if we were only getting seven people here like we used to in the old days.
8665460	8670460	So they're going to miss all this wig action.
8670460	8675460	This is right. Those hundred twenty thousand people show today.
8675460	8680460	Those hundred twenty thousand people, they might be seeing Ninja, but are they seeing wigs?
8680460	8685460	I don't think so. Are they seeing all this?
8691460	8696460	Anyway, D.G. Ramas says, sometimes I do wish we'd get big numbers, but you know what?
8696460	8701460	When me, Mako, Ichigo and Ari do a show, it's just freaking fun and I love it.
8701460	8706460	And you know, I've kind of and I've said this before, like I feel like our moment has probably come and gone
8706460	8710460	where we would have been one of those shows that has hundreds of thousands of people watching.
8710460	8713460	And you know what? I'm at peace with it because when hundreds of people watch you,
8713460	8716460	that's when all of your movements get over analyzed.
8716460	8722460	And that's when, you know, people will dig back in the archives and find some shitty thing from the show
8722460	8725460	15 years ago and try to cancel me over it and all this stuff.
8725460	8730460	And I'm just like, you know, sometimes having a small group, it's not such a bad thing.
8731460	8736460	So. All right. Anyhow, let's move on, shall we?
8736460	8739460	I think where we are now is Dark Soccer. This is yours, right?
8739460	8743460	Oh, my gosh. It's been so long since I've done a show all the way through.
8743460	8748460	Anyway, how about some Amazon stuff?
8748460	8754460	Their MMO title, New Earth, got delayed.
8754460	8763460	Basically, they they had this whole, like, new entire world thing.
8763460	8769460	And it was supposed to set in some time at this point.
8769460	8772460	It was actually supposed to be released, I think, in March.
8772460	8775460	And then it was delayed until August 25th.
8775460	8782460	And now their studio director, Rich Lawrence, is saying they're delaying it until spring 2021.
8782460	8788460	And the reason is from different responses to the game's alpha reviews.
8788460	8795460	And the developers are trying to make sure that the most devoted players have loads of middle and end game experiences.
8795460	8804460	That is a quote. And so as compensation for this, there's going to be a beta for a limited time starting August 25th.
8804460	8812460	There'll be a beta sign up coming later on with those who preordered the game getting first access.
8812460	8816460	And so you can look into that and and order it.
8816460	8824460	If you're you know, I mean, if if you've got the preorder, then then you'll be able to get in on the beta.
8824460	8831460	And honestly, I commend them for listening to the reviews and for taking all of that into account,
8831460	8838460	because I would rather and while I have probably zero interest in playing it,
8838460	8846460	I would rather that they listen to the feedback and put time and effort into a quality release.
8846460	8851460	Well, and as as Quest Buster says in chat, after what happened with Crucible, I don't blame them.
8851460	8856460	That was a train wreck. And yeah, Amazon's track record with gaming for all the hype that, you know,
8856460	8862460	oh, my gosh, Amazon's got a game studio company. This isn't been a great year for them and this type of news.
8862460	8867460	So even though this delay will probably inevitably be a good thing for the lifespan of the game,
8867460	8872460	it isn't a good thing for Amazon Game Studios. Look now, at the same time,
8872460	8878460	you look at Amazon as an entire company and someone like Jeff Bezos has like one of those rooms that Uncle Scrooge has,
8878460	8885460	where you just who where who can dive off of the diving board and just swim in the money pit of money.
8885460	8893460	So I don't I'm not exactly concerned for Amazon's financial stability, but it's still probably not a great look for the company.
8893460	8900460	So anyway, as as we're on our Amazon owned Twitch feed.
8900460	8906460	But I'm looking at you. Yep. All right. Moving on. Loki.
8906460	8912460	All right. So this is kind of odd. So we just got done talking about a game show for Tetris.
8912460	8918460	Now there's a reality show for The Sims. Now, this is not what you might think it might be.
8918460	8922460	Please say they speak Simlish. They do not speak Simlish.
8922460	8932460	So this is a little bit along the lines of like a almost like that that Lego show that they had not too long ago.
8932460	8937460	It's about building stuff with The Sims.
8937460	8942460	So it's called The Sims Sparked and supposed to premiere actually on the 17th.
8942460	8951460	So that's this week. And it's supposed to be with contestants creating characters, worlds and stories in The Sims 4.
8951460	8961460	And with that, I guess there they have like a judges panel which will judge them and everything about the creations that they make and everything.
8961460	8964460	I just I don't know. It's interesting.
8964460	8970460	It also looks a little bit like Project Runway or something like that, you know, where they're just like building different things.
8970460	8975460	In fact, I think they even have parts where they're building clothing for their characters and stuff.
8975460	8985460	So it's different. That's for sure. But if it's anything like Lego Masters or whatever, where they focus on the drama.
8985460	8990460	Like, I hate that. I know maybe reality TV is just not for me because it's always focusing on drama.
8990460	8995460	But like, I love competition shows, but I hate when it's like a reality competition show.
8995460	9000460	I just would like the competition without all of the drama thrown in.
9000460	9008460	Yeah, I don't know. I mean, it's probably going to be a bit of a mess, but I still think Dark Sakura should think about applying because I mean,
9008460	9014460	Dark Sakura is very talented when it comes to The Sims and she has wigs.
9015460	9021460	She stepped away so she can't comment at the moment, but I'm still going to encourage that.
9021460	9028460	So apparently the judges that are on the panel for this first season, they have YouTube creator Kelsey Impechi.
9028460	9033460	I don't know how to pronounce her name. Sims voice actor Tayla Parks.
9033460	9039460	And I guess Dave Sim Guru Ninja Itoki.
9039460	9044460	And I guess they're going to have a producer as well for Maxis.
9046460	9052460	I don't know. It says the contestants are our various online personalities, which I guess have a connection to the series.
9052460	9054460	It's kind of similar to how Lego Masters was.
9054460	9058460	Wait, was that their judging panel you just read off?
9058460	9062460	Is like, wow, that's OK. Interesting.
9062460	9066460	So YouTube YouTube influencers are judging this.
9066460	9070460	Hey, Dark Sakura, we think you should go on The Sims reality show.
9070460	9079460	And there's a Sims reality show where because because you're good at The Sims about making stuff and you could make our show famous.
9079460	9085460	OK, they can pay me. I love how if you win.
9085460	9089460	So like the Lego builders thing. Yes, it is actually.
9089460	9092460	So apparently it's pretty short. They said this is far.
9092460	9096460	It's a joint production between TVS and BuzzFeed multiplayer.
9096460	9103460	And all four episodes are going to be online on Monday after the air or the Monday after they air on television.
9103460	9105460	So.
9105460	9109460	Neat, I guess.
9109460	9115460	I don't know. Not really interested in this is, but I don't know.
9115460	9123460	Some of the people I watch on YouTube, like the guy call me Kevin or whatever, would be more interesting to see on this show than some of these creators.
9123460	9133460	OK, and I'm sorry if I mispronounce your name, but I think I read that as I touch is an art, says the best line for dark soccer competing in this show.
9133460	9137460	Love your hair. Hope you win.
9137460	9139460	Yeah.
9139460	9142460	Which is a drag race, man. Yeah.
9143460	9150460	For the record, the wig that I'm wearing now, as some of you may remember, my hair was actually this color before.
9150460	9154460	I got this wig at DragCon two years ago, actually.
9154460	9160460	My buddy J.J., also known as the queen Miss Patsy declined, got me this wig.
9160460	9165460	It's your lightning wig. You look like lightning. I agree with chat. You look like lightning in that wig.
9165460	9170460	So love it. All right. They have a speed run competition for killing the Sims in this game.
9170460	9173460	I don't see I could see the dark soccer anymore.
9173460	9179460	Dark soccer could design like a murder house. And I think that would be she could be the spooky contestant.
9179460	9183460	Like, well, I was going to say Sharon Needles, but we don't talk about her anymore.
9183460	9186460	So spooky, like I don't know who's spooky in the drag race.
9187460	9189460	Elvira. Oh, perfect.
9189460	9196460	And Elvira is a bio queen. Let's be real.
9196460	9200460	She's like, yeah, everybody, everybody says Drag Race has never had a bio queen on it.
9200460	9203460	They've had one on the judging panel. Not that they shouldn't have contestants on the show, too.
9203460	9206460	But they've had one on the judging panel several times. Elvira.
9206460	9212460	So, yeah, well, and myself, myself, Visage. I mean, yeah, true.
9212460	9219460	All right. Anyway, moving on, let's talk about when you want to make big changes to your character in a game like World of Warcraft.
9219460	9224460	You've had to pay a fee before if you want to make changes like you want to change the race or the gender or what have you.
9224460	9229460	You have to pay a fee to Activision Blizzard in order to do that.
9229460	9233460	However, they just had like a little press.
9233460	9238460	They had like a little hour long kind of livestream about World of Warcraft Shadowlands.
9238460	9247460	And one of the things that they announced is that they are actually going to be removing the 15 dollar fee to change the gender of your character.
9247460	9251460	And they're going to say it's going to be similar basically to like the barbershop.
9251460	9259460	If you go in and get the haircut, you know, you can change your gender easily without that money being spent if you want.
9259460	9265460	And it seems like part of the reason here, there is an interview that happened with Eurogamer and the executive producer behind Shadowlands,
9265460	9272460	John Hight, said that the fee was not sending the right message, but that they also can't fix it through a hot fix.
9272460	9282460	And they're also talking a little bit about this new character that's in Shadowlands called Pelagos that many are interpreting as a transgender character in WoW
9282460	9289460	because they're saying aspirants are able to choose a physical form that represents their true self.
9289460	9295460	Pelagos, who presented as a woman in his mortal life, chose to be a man in the Shadowlands.
9295460	9301460	So there's an interesting kind of like parallel there about becoming like your true self and so forth.
9301460	9306460	And so maybe they felt, I'm assuming, I'm kind of filling the gaps that maybe if there are some players,
9306460	9311460	and let's be real, World of Warcraft has been out for 15 plus years.
9311460	9317460	And maybe there's some people out there that with their characters can maybe relate to a situation like Pelagos.
9317460	9322460	They don't want to put a $15 fee so that you can change the gender of your character.
9322460	9329460	So the rare story about removing a microtransaction. How about that?
9329460	9331460	Now I've seen everything.
9331460	9336460	Especially from a game that already had a monthly fee. So that's pretty cool.
9336460	9338460	I think it's a good step toward being inclusive.
9338460	9343460	It is. And it's neat to hear that they have that storyline in Shadowlands.
9343460	9347460	And I'm only refraining from talking much more about it because I'm going to be honest,
9347460	9350460	I haven't followed World of Warcraft as closely in quite a while.
9350460	9353460	So I don't want to like fuck up or misrepresent something.
9353460	9358460	But you know, kind of what I'm reading about it, it does sound like they're exploring some themes in the game
9358460	9364460	where maybe they've been told they could have explored a long time ago.
9364460	9366460	I'm still not going back to WoW.
9366460	9370460	I don't see myself visiting it anytime soon.
9370460	9374460	But I can still say I'm glad it's happening for the people that are still there.
9374460	9378460	Because I know plenty of people that still love and appreciate World of Warcraft.
9378460	9380460	And will probably be thrilled that this is there.
9380460	9382460	So, yay.
9382460	9384460	Alright.
9384460	9386460	Moving, yeah.
9386460	9389460	Sia Tabiri in chat says $15 is a microtransaction?
9389460	9391460	I need a bigger piggy bank. Good point.
9391460	9393460	Remember, they're all transactions.
9393460	9394460	I know.
9394460	9396460	They're all taking money out of your pocket.
9396460	9399460	You know what they're, you know what they're really calling it, though.
9399460	9401460	Alright, anyhow.
9401460	9404460	Let's get into, that was our last scheduled story.
9404460	9406460	So this is the listener roundtable.
9406460	9410460	If you want to bring up any additional comments or questions that we haven't addressed on the show yet,
9410460	9414460	you can bring that up in our chat room here.
9414460	9417460	Okay, wow. Hype Mayhem was ready to go with a comment there.
9417460	9419460	Let me read through this.
9419460	9421460	Excuse me, let me read through this here.
9421460	9423460	Ask Loki, of course, and Dark StarCraft.
9423460	9425460	They have any last minute stories in a moment.
9425460	9427460	But first, Hype Mayhem says,
9427460	9430460	This primarily applies to PC gaming more than consoles.
9430460	9433460	Since PC gaming is pretty much digital only,
9433460	9435460	physical releases have gone the way of the 8-track,
9435460	9438460	and games can often get delisted for XYZ reasons,
9438460	9440460	I see PC gamers having two options.
9440460	9443460	Either buy up any games that look interesting,
9443460	9446460	and hedge against the possibility of missing out due to delisting.
9446460	9448460	But backlogs get insanely huge.
9448460	9451460	Or keep purchasing and backlog is reasonable,
9451460	9454460	but run the risk of missing out on buying a game.
9454460	9459460	So all that being said, which camp do you folks find yourselves in and why?
9459460	9462460	I'm going to invent a new camp.
9462460	9464460	Because that's what I do.
9464460	9468460	This illustrates, the situation you're describing,
9468460	9472460	illustrates the importance of preserving video game history,
9472460	9476460	and why we need websites like archive.org
9476460	9479460	that are exploring about preserving old video games.
9479460	9482460	Because honestly, if you go into their library,
9482460	9484460	it's kind of the reverse of what you're talking about.
9484460	9487460	It's not necessarily things that were digital and got delisted.
9487460	9491460	It were things that were physical that you can no longer find anymore.
9491460	9493460	Or that don't really run on current computers,
9493460	9495460	because the software has changed.
9495460	9499460	So I think that preservation of games is super important.
9499460	9504460	And I don't necessarily believe in filling up a gigantic backlog
9504460	9506460	that I'll never get through.
9506460	9509460	I just want to see that the old games get protected.
9509460	9512460	So that way, if I do think of a game 20 years from now
9512460	9515460	that I want to show someone else's kid,
9515460	9516460	because I'm not going to have my own.
9516460	9518460	But if I want to show someone else's kid this game that I used to play,
9518460	9521460	I want to know that there will be a place like archive.org
9521460	9524460	or something like that, where I can pull up the game
9524460	9526460	and show it to somebody.
9526460	9527460	You know what I mean?
9527460	9530460	So I love archive for the old game stuff.
9531460	9534460	Able to pull up old Dr. Brain games on there
9534460	9538460	and some of the old edutainment games from the Apple days.
9538460	9540460	And it's not just about like,
9540460	9543460	oh, I want to play all these games for free.
9543460	9545460	It's a nostalgia trip.
9545460	9547460	It's remembering things.
9547460	9551460	It's the equivalent of looking at an old magazine in a library.
9551460	9552460	You know what I mean?
9552460	9554460	Like, is the magazine going to go out of business
9554460	9556460	because I looked at an old copy in the library?
9556460	9558460	I don't know.
9558460	9560460	Anyway, so that's my kind of take on it.
9560460	9562460	I don't know if you guys have anything to add to that.
9564460	9569460	Dark Soccer, you're a big game collector of sorts, I suppose.
9569460	9574460	Like, is the concept of digital collection important to you?
9576460	9580460	Lately, if there's something that I'm really into,
9580460	9581460	I think I would have a physical copy.
9581460	9584460	And I would have done that for Animal Crossing.
9584460	9587460	But I had pneumonia when it came out.
9587460	9589460	I got the digital copy.
9590460	9597460	So I'm not, I guess, as much into it as I used to be, I guess.
9597460	9601460	You know, just it doesn't seem as important,
9601460	9607460	especially now since I'm, I guess, trying to downsize.
9607460	9609460	Yeah, I hear that.
9609460	9610460	I hear that.
9610460	9612460	Well, although, I mean, we're not selling anything.
9612460	9614460	And I might downsize a kitty
9614460	9616460	if he doesn't shut the hell up over there.
9616460	9617460	All right.
9617460	9619460	I cannot hear the smooshy.
9619460	9620460	Oh, really?
9620460	9621460	He's being louder than he usually is.
9621460	9622460	All right.
9622460	9624460	And I miss picking him up against his will.
9624460	9626460	He misses you too, Aunt Jamie.
9626460	9627460	All right.
9627460	9631460	Anyway, let's see if there's any, if there's any, yeah.
9631460	9633460	The chat's like, oh, now I hear smoosh.
9633460	9634460	Because earlier, I don't know if you heard of it,
9634460	9637460	Stella was in the background at Loki's house making some noise.
9637460	9639460	And the chatters could hear that.
9639460	9640460	Yeah.
9640460	9642460	Minda's fucked off somewhere.
9642460	9643460	She's probably sleeping.
9643460	9645460	Minda doesn't usually scream on cam though, right?
9645460	9646460	I don't, at least I don't remember that.
9646460	9650460	No, and she also, she also though has a very melodic meow.
9650460	9653460	I like this comment in chat or question.
9653460	9655460	Miltonius Games in chat says,
9655460	9658460	I've been getting into novels set in video game universes,
9658460	9660460	Warcraft, Halo, so forth.
9660460	9664460	Have any of you ever gotten into any video game content
9664460	9667460	set outside of the video game format,
9667460	9670460	shows, comics, et cetera?
9670460	9672460	I read a lot of those Warcraft books,
9672460	9674460	the World of Warcraft ones that were,
9674460	9677460	like I read Thrall and I read the,
9677460	9682460	the fuck, what was the, the war with the well
9682460	9685460	and fuck, why can't I think of the name?
9685460	9689460	With, God, why can't I think Illidan and,
9689460	9692460	and his brother and Illidan being stupid.
9692460	9693460	I know what you're talking about.
9693460	9695460	Is that the lead into cataclysm, right?
9695460	9699460	No, this was like the lead into like the whole of everything.
9699460	9700460	Oh, okay.
9700460	9703460	When all the demons popped up and were stupid.
9703460	9706460	And then I read the,
9706460	9709460	the book with a holding,
9709460	9710460	what's his face on trial.
9710460	9715460	And I mostly read it because of Sylvanas,
9717460	9719460	you know, meeting back up with her sister
9719460	9722460	and talking about trying to kill what's his face.
9722460	9725460	Oh, I can't remember his name either because I hated him.
9725460	9726460	Everyone hated him during cataclysm.
9726460	9727460	Garrosh?
9727460	9728460	Yeah, Garrosh.
9728460	9729460	Yeah.
9729460	9731460	God, my brain is just not like working for names.
9731460	9732460	That's okay.
9732460	9735460	And I've, I mean, for other things,
9735460	9737460	I've read some of the supernatural books.
9737460	9740460	I've got some old Doctor Who books from the eighties.
9740460	9745460	I've, I mean, gosh, I, I, when I get into a fandom,
9745460	9747460	I get into a fandom.
9747460	9749460	It's just like reading all those Star Wars books.
9749460	9751460	I haven't read any of the older ones,
9751460	9754460	but I've read the, some of the newer ones.
9754460	9758460	I read the Phasma, Phasma book.
9759460	9761460	I've read a few of the others.
9761460	9763460	I want to read the Belea book.
9763460	9765460	It's on, it's on my list.
9765460	9766460	So, yeah.
9766460	9768460	I have a couple of answers for this,
9768460	9770460	as far as like games and other things.
9770460	9774460	When Pokemon first came out, I used to love the anime,
9774460	9776460	the original OG anime.
9776460	9777460	I loved Pokemon.
9777460	9778460	Of course, it was all the dubbed ones
9778460	9781460	that we had here in the US, but still, I love that.
9781460	9783460	What's that?
9783460	9785460	It's a movie in Japanese, remember?
9785460	9787460	Oh yeah, yeah, I remember that.
9787460	9788460	Yeah, yeah.
9788460	9793460	But the other thing was when I was really younger,
9793460	9796460	and I don't know if people will remember these.
9796460	9799460	Some people will, but they had these books that came out,
9799460	9801460	and I could get them at like Walden Books or something,
9801460	9803460	but they were the Worlds of Power books
9803460	9805460	where they took video games, right?
9805460	9809460	FX9, I think was the shadow name.
9809460	9811460	That wasn't really the guy that wrote them
9811460	9812460	because it's on Wikipedia,
9812460	9814460	and it kind of gives the whole story
9814460	9816460	that somebody else really wrote them under that name.
9816460	9819460	But there were games, or excuse me, books
9819460	9822460	based on things like Blaster Master had a book.
9822460	9824460	I remember Simon's Quest had a book, which was weird
9824460	9827460	because it was like you had an adventurer
9827460	9828460	that was with Simon.
9828460	9831460	Metal Gear had a decent book from what I remember too.
9831460	9833460	They weren't giant books.
9833460	9835460	They were young adult books.
9835460	9838460	They were made for 12-year-old gamers,
9838460	9842460	and they were only like yay thick and about 100 pages,
9842460	9844460	so you could get through them pretty quickly.
9844460	9848460	But they were good for somebody who at the time
9848460	9851460	games were a very like nerd thing and very niche thing.
9851460	9853460	It was kind of neat to see them cross over into books
9853460	9855460	because you didn't see that a lot.
9855460	9857460	Ninja Gaiden had one too.
9857460	9858460	I remember that.
9858460	9859460	That had a really good book.
9859460	9861460	Actually, there's another series of books
9861460	9864460	that I actually went out and found translations for.
9864460	9869460	One of them was the Silent Hill 2 novelization.
9869460	9871460	Oh, I didn't know it had one.
9871460	9873460	Which was really freaking good.
9874460	9876460	I have a PDF of it.
9876460	9878460	And the Catherine books.
9881460	9884460	Okay, you guys are lighting up our round table tonight.
9884460	9885460	Hold on, I got to cut up all their comments,
9885460	9886460	then we'll get to the last minute stories.
9886460	9890460	SG100Matt says, dropping this GoFundMe in here
9890460	9893460	for saving the New Jersey Arcade 8 on the break,
9893460	9896460	which I've been to before, Rob Roberts approved,
9896460	9898460	which is having a hard time paying off its taxes
9898460	9899460	due to the pandemic.
9899460	9900460	I think we all know.
9900460	9902460	The break has been around for several decades
9902460	9904460	and has become a staple in the music game community.
9904460	9906460	Thankfully, it hit its initial goal,
9906460	9908460	but the arcade is not reopening anytime soon
9908460	9910460	because of the recent surge in cases.
9910460	9913460	Any links to the GoFundMe, which is in chat
9913460	9915460	for those of you participating live.
9915460	9916460	If you're on the podcast feed,
9916460	9918460	I'm sure if you just search for GoFundMe
9918460	9920460	and on the break, you'll find it.
9920460	9922460	But shout out for that.
9922460	9924460	I'll link it on my Twitter.
9924460	9925460	Thank you.
9925460	9928460	Going to a tweet from Pixel Pacas,
9928460	9931460	who tweets a saying, I'm sorry, not a tweet,
9931460	9934460	a comment in chat, but DarkSakura just mentioned tweeting,
9934460	9935460	so I got confused.
9935460	9937460	Pixel Pacas says,
9937460	9940460	have you folks attended any digital conventions yet?
9940460	9943460	I felt like the concept was a bit silly,
9943460	9945460	but just got out of FUJO CON,
9945460	9947460	which is the YowieCon, basically,
9947460	9948460	and it was so fun.
9948460	9952460	They had academic panels, games on tabletop simulator,
9952460	9955460	and themed fan meetups on Discord.
9955460	9959460	Well, Bobby Blackwolf drops the cheap, obvious plug in there
9959460	9962460	Vogg showed up at a digital convention this weekend,
9962460	9965460	which sadly I mentioned earlier in the show,
9965460	9968460	I've had some personal issues.
9968460	9970460	I was hoping to contribute a video
9970460	9972460	before those personal issues even popped up,
9972460	9975460	but making videos is a lot of work.
9975460	9976460	Bobby did a very good job on that,
9976460	9978460	and I just had some conflicting priorities,
9978460	9981460	especially with a lot going on in my day job leading up to that.
9981460	9983460	But anyway, I had full on planned to,
9983460	9985460	oh, I'm going to be there live when it debuts,
9985460	9986460	and I'll participate as well.
9986460	9988460	I'm sure Bobby and the rest of you understand
9988460	9990460	why I didn't do that,
9990460	9993460	but he did post the video early to our Discord
9993460	9996460	over at voggnetwork.com slash Discord
9996460	10001460	if you're a subscriber here at Vogg Network on Twitch,
10001460	10003460	and you have your Discord link to Twitch.
10003460	10004460	That's very important.
10004460	10006460	If both those things are true,
10006460	10009460	then you get access to a super secret subscriber chat.
10009460	10011460	We don't fill it up a lot,
10011460	10014460	but a couple weeks ago before the new stuff showed up at OLR,
10014460	10017460	I posted some sneak peeks of the new stuff at OLR,
10017460	10020460	and then Bobby posted his panel early for people to see.
10020460	10022460	So technically, Vogg Network was a part of that,
10022460	10025460	but because of my personal situations,
10025460	10027460	I did not participate with that convention.
10027460	10031460	I did a professional convention for work.
10031460	10033460	Work paid for me to go to a virtual convention,
10033460	10038460	which had a lot of on-demand seminars for the field that I'm in,
10038460	10040460	and I thought it was pretty cool.
10040460	10041460	Very informative talks.
10041460	10043460	There were things you could go to live.
10043460	10046460	You could ask questions and interact with the speakers,
10046460	10049460	which for my industry was very good for learning and so forth.
10049460	10051460	What I also thought was really interesting
10051460	10056460	was that they had this section that was like these roundtables,
10056460	10057460	and you could sign up and say,
10057460	10060460	I want to have a roundtable session on this,
10060460	10064460	and then up to five other people could come sit at your table,
10064460	10067460	and then it would be like, go to this Zoom chat,
10067460	10070460	and now you can have a roundtable chat on this particular thing.
10070460	10072460	And I thought that was really cool,
10072460	10074460	because this company that was putting it on,
10074460	10077460	I think has done virtual shows before, and it shows,
10077460	10079460	because they had a lot of interesting ideas like that.
10079460	10081460	So I thought that was pretty cool.
10081460	10084460	I full-on plan on doing DragonCon virtually,
10084460	10086460	because I'm sure as many of you know,
10086460	10089460	DragonCon was officially canceled this week,
10089460	10094460	which is sad, but at the same time is necessary.
10094460	10098460	So I'm sad to see it not happen, but I think it's pretty cool.
10098460	10099460	They're going to be doing a virtual one,
10099460	10101460	and I full-on intend to participate.
10101460	10105460	I hope I'll be asked to participate as a panelist on one of the tracks,
10105460	10108460	but I realize they're going to have a limited amount of space.
10108460	10112460	It's not going to be as flowing as the convention itself is,
10112460	10116460	so I'll be happy just to participate with that whole thing.
10116460	10119460	So, yeah.
10119460	10122460	SheHulk10 is pointing out KaijuCon going on right now,
10122460	10124460	heading there after the show.
10124460	10128460	Bobby linked his panel there.
10128460	10131460	Let's see. Oh, yeah, it's available to all.
10131460	10134460	Bobby says, yeah, I don't like doing pre-recorded material.
10134460	10141460	I have been wanting to for a while get into more video-on-demand type of stuff,
10141460	10144460	but obviously it's kind of getting over the mountain of,
10144460	10146460	I don't have the time.
10146460	10148460	I'm really trying to make time,
10148460	10150460	but obviously some of these scenarios that keep coming up
10150460	10154460	are pushing me back a little bit.
10154460	10157460	But I'm going to try and do a little more of that type of stuff,
10157460	10159460	so we'll see.
10159460	10161460	That video he did was almost an hour.
10161460	10162460	That's a lot of content.
10162460	10164460	That's very, very good.
10164460	10166460	All right.
10166460	10168460	Anyhow, let's get into some last-minute stories.
10168460	10170460	Loki, I don't know if you have anything for us here.
10170460	10171460	I have one.
10171460	10172460	Oh, do you?
10172460	10173460	Then why not Dark Soccer first?
10173460	10174460	Go ahead.
10174460	10175460	Okay.
10175460	10178460	This looks like something that was more recently related.
10178460	10180460	I actually just found the article on this one.
10180460	10185460	Sony has a patent now hinting to cloud-based backwards compatibility.
10185460	10187460	I don't know if that's old news or what,
10187460	10191460	but I'm looking at these patent drawings, and it's pretty interesting.
10191460	10195460	No, but I'd heard this rumor that that's how they were going to do it,
10195460	10199460	so this patent just seems to kind of light up that rumor a little more.
10199460	10205460	Yeah, and the patent appeared on Japan's platform for patent information website.
10205460	10209460	It was filed on July 2nd, and of course it is in Japanese,
10209460	10213460	but there is a comment on it translated.
10213460	10217460	Another trend growing in this industry relates to the development of cloud-based gaming systems.
10217460	10220460	Such a system may include a remote processing server
10220460	10224460	that is configured to execute a game application, receive input from a user,
10224460	10229460	and communicate with a local thin client configured to display an image on a display,
10229460	10236460	meaning that it's got an illustration of a user climbing a step
10236460	10240460	to get to a different type of gaming system.
10240460	10249460	The illustration they have on here shows a PS3, because it looks like a Foreman grill.
10249460	10254460	And so in another image, it's basically showing the various input selects
10254460	10257460	with all the models of PlayStation going back to the first one,
10257460	10262460	and then going on to another readout for the display
10262460	10265460	where you can pick the games pertaining to that particular system.
10266460	10276460	And there's also, of course, a little blank box on there where the PS4 would go.
10276460	10282460	And so it's sort of hinting that this is going to be
10282460	10286460	since the fact that PS5 will support the top 100 PS4 games,
10286460	10291460	and that all of the new PS4 games after July are certified to be PS5 compatible.
10292460	10296460	So that could be a thing.
10296460	10301460	That part, I know, had been discussed before about the whole games after a certain point.
10301460	10308460	That's making me think that that's why there's no icon.
10308460	10313460	I mean, it's literally like a cutout square with little dashes around it
10313460	10316460	that don't show anything for PS4.
10316460	10322460	So I guess that's maybe a placeholder for working on backwards compatibility
10322460	10325460	for some of the earlier PS4 games, who knows?
10325460	10330460	By the way, and I don't know if this is something Loki had planned for Last Minute Stories, sorry,
10330460	10335460	but on a tangent, we didn't talk about it this week,
10335460	10340460	but the PlayStation 5 box art was released, like what the games are going to look like.
10340460	10342460	It looks like a game.
10342460	10347460	It's the PlayStation 4 box in new colors, which, you know,
10347460	10349460	I know there's a lot of negativity on the internet about that,
10349460	10354460	but I'm like, honestly, the PlayStation 4 box was the PlayStation 3 box in different colors.
10354460	10356460	So it's not...
10356460	10360460	If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
10360460	10365460	The PlayStation 3 ones are black, the PlayStation 4 ones are blue,
10365460	10367460	and now the PlayStation 5 ones will be white.
10367460	10370460	And you will be able to see them when they're sitting on the shelf.
10370460	10372460	And fine, great.
10372460	10380460	For those who are in chat, I'm actually linking a picture of that menu translation,
10380460	10384460	so I thought it was really interesting.
10384460	10386460	It's out there.
10386460	10395460	If people want to find the information, you'll just want to go to look up the Japanese patent website,
10395460	10397460	and it'll be on there.
10397460	10398460	All right.
10398460	10400460	Well, if that's it for Dark Sakura...
10400460	10402460	I have another.
10402460	10404460	Oh, wow. Go for it.
10404460	10409460	Sony is delaying the Monster Hunter movie until 2021.
10409460	10411460	Sorry, 2021.
10411460	10413460	I forgot that it's even coming out.
10413460	10417460	Yeah, it's set to release April 23rd, 2021,
10417460	10424460	and it's going to have some Resident Evil people in it, like Mila.
10424460	10426460	Because same director.
10426460	10427460	Yeah.
10427460	10432460	And she's kind of pissed about them trying to reboot Resident Evil, just saying.
10432460	10436460	Probably because she wasn't asked to be in it, and that's always a little bit...
10436460	10437460	Probably.
10437460	10438460	Yeah.
10438460	10443460	It kind of stings when you are not asked to be in the reboot of something, but sometimes...
10443460	10445460	Maybe it'll be more like the games.
10445460	10446460	You know what, though?
10446460	10448460	But you look at the reboot they're doing for Candyman,
10448460	10450460	and obviously all we've seen is that trailer.
10450460	10454460	The movie should have been out by now, and I'm not big on how I feel about horror movies,
10454460	10456460	but Candyman's kind of cool, and I do love the fact...
10456460	10458460	Yeah, that looks so badass.
10458460	10464460	The new one has the guy that used to play Candyman in it, still.
10464460	10466460	I think that Tony Todd, right?
10466460	10467460	Yeah, I think that's awesome.
10467460	10469460	I think that's awesome, too.
10469460	10472460	And isn't it produced by Jordan Peele?
10472460	10475460	I think he's a producer, yeah, but I don't think he wrote it or anything.
10475460	10477460	But yeah, he's a producer.
10477460	10480460	But yeah, if he's going to put his money behind it, it's got to have some quality.
10480460	10483460	True, true. And the trailer was great.
10483460	10486460	Oh, yeah. I will do that.
10486460	10492460	I'm trying to think of other things where the talent was or was not asked to be a part of it.
10492460	10497460	Somebody was just commenting on it recently that they were kind of hurt, that they weren't asked to be in it,
10497460	10499460	but they were glad to see that it was still going.
10499460	10501460	I can't remember what it was.
10501460	10507460	Sorry, I know that makes for a terrible story, but there's things like that that come up once in a while.
10507460	10509460	That's it for me.
10509460	10515460	DJ Rama S talking about the Resident Evil saying the reboot is supposed to be a lot closer to the games.
10515460	10518460	And I think Silent Hill, they were talking about possibly doing that, too,
10518460	10521460	but I think that's really, really rumor, great assault type of thing.
10521460	10525460	All right. Well, I don't think Loki had any last minute stories if I heard them right,
10525460	10529460	so I think we're about the time to wrap up the show.
10529460	10534460	Thank you guys so much for participating with our show tonight and listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10534460	10536460	Whether you were here live or on our podcast feed,
10536460	10540460	we really appreciate you guys sitting down with us every week and spending, you know,
10540460	10544460	if you've gotten this far in the show, that means you've made it close to three hours with us.
10544460	10550460	So I hope we made your day go by a little faster, whether you're working at home or out exercising outdoors
10550460	10555460	or maybe in the workplace taking precautions because I know not everybody can work from home right now.
10555460	10558460	I hope we're making your day go by a little bit quicker.
10558460	10560460	And thank you so much for making us a part of your week.
10560460	10562460	Really, really appreciate it.
10562460	10564460	We'll be back in seven days to do it all again.
10564460	10568460	Obviously, we've been getting kind of the trickle of announcements that would have been at E3.
10568460	10570460	We're kind of getting that trickle through the coming weeks.
10570460	10573460	And in a couple of weeks, we're going to get a lot of news about the Xbox.
10573460	10577460	So that's going to be very, very exciting.
10577460	10580460	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend.
10580460	10583460	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
10583460	10588460	But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, yikes, then we don't have anything.
10588460	10592460	So a nice five-star review wherever you found this show, like iTunes,
10592460	10596460	or just recommending us by sharing a link to our page on Spotify or what have you,
10596460	10598460	that goes an awful long way.
10598460	10601460	So thank you, thank you so much to everybody that helps us spread the word.
10601460	10604460	With that, it's time to get into final thoughts.
10604460	10606460	I'll start tonight.
10606460	10613460	My final thought is I'm going to play more of that cross code or the game whose name I can't remember,
10613460	10617460	but it's a good game and it's a good throwback to Super Nintendo stuff.
10617460	10619460	So I'm going to play some more of that this week.
10619460	10625460	And I'm going to play Elliot's Jam Game and probably lots of other stuff this week too.
10625460	10630460	As much as quarantine sucks and I miss interacting with real people,
10630460	10636460	I miss my weekend trips to San Francisco, I miss my nights out downtown,
10636460	10639460	it's given me a chance to play a lot of video games.
10639460	10641460	So I'll be doing that.
10641460	10643460	Loki, how about you?
10643460	10650460	Well, it's just going to be working this week and maybe I'll get some game dev time in there as well.
10650460	10651460	We'll see.
10651460	10656460	And last but certainly not least, here for the whole show tonight, Dark Soccer, your final thought.
10658460	10660460	Your unmuted final thought, please.
10660460	10661460	Sorry.
10661460	10662460	It's okay.
10662460	10666460	Eight weeks total and I'm not going to be doing this again anytime soon because it's hot.
10667460	10671460	And I have been sitting here smelling the pizza that Dan ordered that arrived
10671460	10674460	right after the start of the show, and I have not eaten any of it.
10674460	10676460	Girl, just turn your cam off and go to town.
10676460	10678460	No, I'm a professional bitch.
10678460	10679460	I appreciate it.
10679460	10680460	We know.
10680460	10681460	Let me mean it.
10681460	10684460	No, I'm going to.
10684460	10685460	Oh, okay.
10685460	10689460	So what is the average airspeed of an unladen swallow?
10689460	10692460	And Brad from Pod Culture beat me to it.
10692460	10695460	African or European.
10695460	10696460	All right.
10696460	10697460	Anything else?
10697460	10700460	All right.
10700460	10702460	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10702460	10703460	Happy gaming this week.
10703460	10706460	We will see you in seven days when we do this all again.
10706460	10709460	Thanks again for being part of the family here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10709460	10710460	We appreciate you guys so much.
10710460	10713460	And all these wigs are just for you.
10713460	10714460	Good night, everybody.
10714460	10718460	And trust me, I got another 20 I hadn't pulled out yet.
10718460	10720460	Something to tune in for next week.
