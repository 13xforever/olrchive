WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.840
Every year has their revivals, revisits, and reflections on the past, but it's always

00:13.840 --> 00:17.760
interesting when over a generation later we see applied knowledge taking over the past.

00:17.760 --> 00:21.960
In the seemingly final state of the PlayStation 2, we now have in our hands a hardware hackless

00:21.960 --> 00:26.080
means for taking over the entire console. Any dubious means aside, this is great for

00:26.080 --> 00:30.320
preservation and flexibility of now sunset consoles. Gaming companies may be changing

00:30.320 --> 00:33.680
up their strategies, but we're still able to bring you your hosts Rob Roberts,

00:33.680 --> 00:37.120
Jamie Summers, and Loki on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:56.080 --> 01:02.880
The 4th of July, making it July 5th, of course. My name Rob Roberts, joining you here in studio.

01:02.880 --> 01:07.600
Not joining us tonight, unfortunately, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. She has the night off to take

01:07.600 --> 01:12.400
care of some personal business, but joining me thanks to the magic of Discord while we continue

01:12.400 --> 01:17.200
to socially distance for over 120 days now. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:18.240 --> 01:19.280
Hey, how's it going?

01:19.280 --> 01:20.800
Hey, I'm doing okay. How are you doing, Loki?

01:21.600 --> 01:22.480
I'm doing pretty good.

01:22.480 --> 01:26.000
It's good to talk to you as always. How was your week personally before we get into games?

01:27.040 --> 01:30.880
Um, it was uneventful, really.

01:30.880 --> 01:31.380
Yeah.

01:31.840 --> 01:33.520
Yeah. Stand inside.

01:33.520 --> 01:37.840
Did you do anything for like the 4th or, I don't know, Canada Day or anything?

01:39.120 --> 01:41.840
We weren't planning on it. And then we ended up doing,

01:42.480 --> 01:48.560
going or trying to go to get some fireworks. And so we managed to hit up one of the booths

01:48.560 --> 01:53.440
that had just like a very few left. I mean, they were sold out in a lot of places because

01:53.440 --> 01:58.080
it's 8 o'clock at night on the 4th of July. So we managed to get some small stuff and then

01:58.080 --> 02:02.640
the neighbors were setting them off. So we just kind of combined ours with theirs and just watched

02:02.640 --> 02:03.920
them set some stuff up.

02:03.920 --> 02:09.600
Gotcha. Now I'm kind of like over the explosions. It was fun when I was a kid, but I'm kind of like,

02:09.600 --> 02:13.520
so I get it when you do it for your kids, but for me, I'm kind of over it at this point.

02:13.520 --> 02:21.200
And I'm just like, I was just hiding in the house and, yeah, trying to keep the cat protected away

02:21.200 --> 02:26.480
from all the noise. And it was, it was, yeah, something. So I'm glad it's over. Let's be real.

02:27.840 --> 02:30.080
Yeah. Go ahead.

02:30.080 --> 02:33.680
Well, assuming it's over, I mean, because, you know, everyone still has stuff left over.

02:33.680 --> 02:39.600
It seems like everybody, since they have it, have to have been social distancing for a while.

02:39.600 --> 02:43.120
And so they haven't been spending the money going out and stuff. So they dropped all that

02:43.120 --> 02:44.640
money into fireworks, it seems like.

02:44.640 --> 02:49.280
Oh yeah. That's actually probably a really good point is that you have a lot of people that are

02:49.280 --> 02:54.480
probably saving money because they're not doing as much as they used to do. And yeah. And now

02:54.480 --> 02:59.280
it's like they spend them on like dumb things like me buying an arcade cabinet this week. But

02:59.280 --> 03:04.880
we'll come back to that later. Some of the chatters, Loki, are noticing your shirt. It's,

03:04.880 --> 03:08.320
and for those on the podcast feed, they can't see the visuals. Although if you want to join us for

03:08.320 --> 03:13.360
the visuals, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash

03:13.360 --> 03:17.440
VOG Network, VOG Network. Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern,

03:17.440 --> 03:22.320
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. Or if you subscribe to our Twitch channel at VOG Network,

03:22.320 --> 03:27.600
you can watch the video on demand at any time. But of course our audio podcast is free as it has been

03:27.600 --> 03:33.520
for years and years and years. But one of our listeners here in chat, Pod Culture, is saying,

03:33.520 --> 03:38.080
I'm sorry, it was Fifth Dream, same chat caller. Fifth Dream says, I spot a prince of all cosmos

03:38.080 --> 03:42.400
on your t-shirt. And it is, you've got like a yellow and black shirt on, which isn't very

03:42.400 --> 03:45.200
Katamari colors. What is, what is this? Just a Katamari shirt?

03:45.200 --> 03:50.800
Yeah, it's actually, it's an official shirt from it. I had a, my, uh, coworker was cleaning out his

03:50.800 --> 03:57.280
closet and he had some shirts that he hadn't worn. Um, and so he's all, he, he recognized that I,

03:57.280 --> 04:02.880
I know what these games are. So I, I have one Katamari shirt and then I've got two Novi Novi

04:02.880 --> 04:08.240
boy shirts. Oh, nice. And I guess they were from the actual developers or something like that. I,

04:08.240 --> 04:12.400
I don't remember where he said he got them, but he says like, I haven't worn them ever. So here

04:12.400 --> 04:18.960
you go. I'm like, cool. Hey, free shirts. Love it. All right. Uh, let's talk a little bit about,

04:18.960 --> 04:22.640
uh, what's going on in the news. We'll get into tonight's kickoff topic. So, uh, why don't you

04:22.640 --> 04:29.440
start us off, Loki? All right. So this is pretty cool. I've been like asking for this for, well,

04:29.440 --> 04:36.480
since 2006. I mean, we've all been asking for it since 2006. Yes. So every year I always ask,

04:36.480 --> 04:40.480
I'm like, when are they going to do something like they did with 2006, where they have,

04:40.480 --> 04:45.920
you know, demos, it's like bringing E3 home. I think we talked about that literally last week

04:45.920 --> 04:51.200
or like two weeks ago. I think that was under discussion with just last week. Yeah. So, so

04:51.200 --> 04:56.240
that's finally going to happen again. So now since E3 isn't really happening and the whole Xbox thing

04:56.240 --> 05:01.280
and everybody's gotta be, you know, distant and doing all the digital stuff, they've announced

05:01.280 --> 05:07.840
that they're going to be doing this, uh, digital, uh, summer games Fest event starting July 21st.

05:07.840 --> 05:14.400
And I think it's going to run for a week or so. So they're going to have it set up to,

05:14.400 --> 05:18.640
they have over 60 demos. You can try a home. Now I'm guessing that a lot of these are probably

05:18.640 --> 05:23.760
going to be indie games, but there's going to be quite a few demos that you can check out on the

05:23.760 --> 05:29.040
Xbox one. If you have one of those, although kind of wish kind of wish I had one, but I don't know,

05:29.920 --> 05:35.280
just to check out demos, maybe not the best idea, but, uh, pretty cool to see that they're doing

05:35.280 --> 05:41.200
something like that. And with such large numbers, um, I'm hoping that some of this spills over onto

05:41.200 --> 05:46.880
PC because I'd love to check out a PC demo of some of those Xbox games or Microsoft games.

05:47.520 --> 05:54.160
Um, but we'll have to see right now. It's just, uh, specifically Xbox, but, um,

05:54.640 --> 06:00.480
yeah, I I'm very excited to see this. They didn't really state which games yet. They did mention

06:00.480 --> 06:07.360
though, um, uh, Chris tales and, uh, they're going to have destroy all humans, which I think is the

06:07.360 --> 06:14.400
remake of that. And skate bird, uh, was another one, which that was just, um, out on the, uh,

06:14.400 --> 06:21.440
steam indie showcase that they did. And then, um, the welcome to elk and hell point. So.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.240
So I, I imagine there's going to be several games that we don't know about yet

06:26.240 --> 06:30.720
that Microsoft plans to unveil at the, um, you know, event that they're going to be doing in

06:30.720 --> 06:35.520
July, which I think we are starting to narrow down the timeframe of when that's going to be happening.

06:35.520 --> 06:40.960
Um, I'm sorry, I might've missed this. Do we know if they're using the cloud gaming to deliver this,

06:40.960 --> 06:44.880
or is this something where you're going to have to download demos of a significant size to be able

06:44.880 --> 06:49.520
to play them or are they doing, are we going to see the cloud stuff get invoked? It does not say

06:49.600 --> 06:55.040
that they're doing the cloud stuff. It just says that it's going to be, um, unlike normal demos

06:55.040 --> 06:59.200
that you would see on there. A lot of these are gonna be very early. Um, so it's basically kind

06:59.200 --> 07:03.200
of like show floor demos that they would have had, uh, which I think is kind of how they did it in

07:03.200 --> 07:09.120
2006. It doesn't really necessarily say that they're going to be using like games pass or

07:09.120 --> 07:13.280
the cloud streaming or anything like that to do this. I guess we'll find out a little bit more

07:13.280 --> 07:19.440
once I think rolls around July 21st. The only thing that's like kind of a bummer with so many

07:20.080 --> 07:25.520
and having to download them all is that of course, this would be the same month that certain large,

07:25.520 --> 07:31.360
uh, internet providers like Comcast, I'm looking at you have decided after they were the good guys

07:31.360 --> 07:38.000
for disabling the bandwidth meters for so long. This is going to, because of COVID that, um,

07:38.000 --> 07:43.600
somehow COVID just went away, even though it's actually worse than it's ever been. Um,

07:43.600 --> 07:49.040
so Comcast has decided to re-enable those bandwidth caps, um, for whatever reason,

07:49.040 --> 07:54.160
even after showing that for several months, uh, that data caps are just there, they're invented,

07:54.160 --> 08:00.240
they're made up. Um, now granted, I noticed that mine came back in July. If you have Comcast, you

08:00.240 --> 08:04.800
have a bandwidth cap again, too. I noticed my bandwidth cap got higher. It went to a weird,

08:04.800 --> 08:12.720
like, instead of like 1024 megabyte or yeah, no 1024 gigabytes or whatever, right. A terabyte.

08:12.960 --> 08:18.640
I noticed that it's like 1226 or something a little, it's kind of like a higher number

08:18.640 --> 08:25.360
for whatever reason, but still, um, 60 demos, that's going to be a lot of traffic. Now on the

08:25.360 --> 08:29.520
flip side, if this are all going to be cloud delivered, then you start to run into some of

08:29.520 --> 08:34.000
the issues that people are having with Stadia, right? Which is how much bandwidth is that going

08:34.000 --> 08:38.640
to eat up if I'm doing, you know, 4k gaming for a significant amount of time, but the bandwidth

08:38.640 --> 08:44.000
isn't too bad for 1080p. I noticed that when I was playing Stadia on my PC a few months ago.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.600
So I would assume that since these are demos, it's going to be the file size is going to be

08:47.600 --> 08:54.240
much smaller. Um, so I would assume that it shouldn't be too bad. And, and probably out

08:54.240 --> 08:58.080
of the 60 plus games that they're going to have, I'm assuming that you're not going to want to play

08:58.080 --> 09:04.080
it necessarily everything. Uh, Questbuster in chat says Comcast COVID has somehow disappeared,

09:04.080 --> 09:09.520
activate data caps, confused worker, but COVID is worse now than Comcast. Your lack of faith

09:09.520 --> 09:13.600
is disturbing. I actually imagine the conversation went just like that. I think you're correct.

09:13.600 --> 09:19.120
Bobby Blackwell says, good news. They up me to 1.2 terabytes. So I, that Bobby is experiencing

09:19.120 --> 09:26.880
the same thing that I, I did. So woo. Now how generous of them. Yeah, I know. Uh, now to be

09:26.880 --> 09:34.560
fair, I looked at how much we use last month and we used maybe 690 gigs last month, which is about

09:34.560 --> 09:41.040
half that. Um, which is interesting though, because that's way higher than we've ever been

09:41.040 --> 09:46.400
before. I mean, we were maybe at like four 50 besides the one month, my Xbox went crazy and

09:46.400 --> 09:50.000
like downloaded the same thing over and over. And I went way over the cap. Usually I've been

09:50.000 --> 09:56.560
around like four 50 maybe, but Alan and I both work from home now and I do a lot of multimedia

09:56.560 --> 10:01.520
work. So I'm oftentimes sending big files back and forth. I have to do that for work.

10:01.520 --> 10:07.200
So I can see why we went up all of a sudden another 200 gigabytes. Um, but I can't exactly

10:07.200 --> 10:12.080
spend, you know, a ton of ton of gigs downloading a bunch of demos. So I'm going to have to like

10:12.080 --> 10:17.440
cherry pick the stuff I want to play. I mean, I guess my, my Xbox only holds a terabyte anyway,

10:17.440 --> 10:21.440
and there's some things I'm not looking to delete anytime soon, but it is, it is kind of an

10:21.440 --> 10:27.040
interesting little downside to, you know, because like in 2006, when we talked about the Xbox,

10:27.040 --> 10:33.840
um, three 60 demos, not only were those smaller for sure, but, uh, also there was only like,

10:33.840 --> 10:41.680
what, like four of them. And there was like a lost planet. It was lost planet, uh, dead rising,

10:41.680 --> 10:50.000
I think. And, um, Moto GP six, it was all Capcom games, which, you know, which, you know, not to,

10:50.080 --> 10:54.720
but the numbers gone way up. So there's going to be way more to pick from. And you know,

10:54.720 --> 10:59.360
there's going to be some people that want to play every single one of them, you know, and, and due

10:59.360 --> 11:04.880
to the world situation have time to do so. Yeah. And I don't know, we'll, we'll have to see how

11:04.880 --> 11:11.680
it is. I wish, I mean, I hope they're not like time exclusive demos. Like, I hope it's like,

11:11.680 --> 11:15.280
you have a certain window to download them, but then you can play them for like a long time.

11:15.280 --> 11:18.800
Cause I remember that's what they did with like the original saints row is they had it, you know,

11:18.800 --> 11:23.520
you can play it for awhile. And like, I played that demo like a bunch of times,

11:23.520 --> 11:29.440
I think until the game came out. Cause it was a 30 minute demo. My still, one of my still favorite

11:29.440 --> 11:34.160
E3 memories to this day was when the Nintendo DS was somewhat new. It was like the first year

11:34.160 --> 11:38.400
everybody had them. And they had those demo stations where you could download a demo to your

11:38.400 --> 11:44.160
DS. And, uh, a friend of mine at the time that went with me and I both downloaded the luminous

11:44.160 --> 11:50.720
demo that was on a 3DS or was it? No, I'm sorry. It was the creators. No, the creators of luminous

11:50.720 --> 11:55.520
did a different game. Um, that was the, Oh my God. Why can't I remember the moment? Meteos

11:56.080 --> 12:00.800
was the name of it. Yeah. Meteos. So Meteos was the demo and I remember we dealt with it

12:00.800 --> 12:06.240
and he played it the entire car ride home. And we, we, we, we brought it home. We didn't like,

12:06.240 --> 12:11.200
we didn't turn off our DSs the entire, like we would charge them, keep them on charger at night.

12:11.200 --> 12:16.000
It made the trip home somehow. Cause we kept the lid closed, charged him again. And we were showing

12:16.000 --> 12:21.120
it to friends back home here. Like, Hey, look, here's the Meteos demo on DS cause we haven't

12:21.120 --> 12:28.720
shut off our 3DS or our DS, excuse me, in like a week. But that was awesome. I loved that. I

12:28.720 --> 12:32.960
missed the, I, that was one of my favorite years. Yeah. I literally brought a piece of E3 home with

12:32.960 --> 12:41.600
me and I have, I pay in the power bill for it. So, um, VidPower 573 says these data caps caused

12:41.600 --> 12:47.600
me to refrain from trying out demos for all these new giant full size or excuse me, giant file size

12:47.600 --> 12:51.600
games. Let me ask this question for those of you that feel the way that VidPower does. Cause I see

12:51.600 --> 12:56.400
some of you guys in chat are like, well, LOL, I don't have bandwidth caps to which I say,

12:56.800 --> 13:03.040
hmm, how nice for you. Hmm. But the rest of us have to deal with bandwidth. No,

13:03.040 --> 13:06.800
let look lucky you, but you know, you're lucky. So the rest of us that are dealing with bandwidth

13:06.800 --> 13:13.440
caps, let me ask this question. Would you rather that they put out the demos where it's a file size

13:13.440 --> 13:18.400
and you download whatever, or would you like a cloud based solution where maybe you have the

13:18.400 --> 13:25.520
power to play a demo in 10 ADP versus 4k, you know, and you have some sort of power over using

13:25.520 --> 13:30.960
cloud gaming solution. So I asked that to VidPower and everybody else in that situation in chat.

13:30.960 --> 13:35.200
What would you, we still don't know how they're going to deliver them. We just assumed that it's

13:35.200 --> 13:42.400
downloadable demos. Um, maybe it would be like, I could see the argument of doing the cloud based

13:42.400 --> 13:48.480
solution because in that way you can't have people data mining your stuff because I could see that

13:48.480 --> 13:55.120
happening quite a bit. Um, I don't know. That's a really good point. That's a really good point

13:55.200 --> 14:00.560
is that they got to be careful what they put in these demos because data miners love to mine. I

14:00.560 --> 14:04.880
mean, look at what happened with the Pokemon DLC, right? Like everybody already knows what's

14:04.880 --> 14:09.920
happening with the next DLC because for whatever reason it was in the data files for this deals.

14:09.920 --> 14:15.120
Well, I shouldn't say that like they did a dumb thing because it probably, they probably have to

14:15.120 --> 14:20.320
do that to set up the infrastructure for both DLC to run. So for whatever the reason, everybody

14:20.320 --> 14:24.320
data or people data mined it. Now everybody knows what Pokemon are going to be in the next

14:24.320 --> 14:29.440
DLC as well. So you're right. Data miners will go crazy if given the opportunity to do so. And

14:29.440 --> 14:36.880
cloud streaming, you will get around that completely. Yeah, it would, or at least I

14:36.880 --> 14:41.760
would think it would be harder to do that if they could. Yeah. Uh, the power of five,

14:41.760 --> 14:46.640
seven, three and chat says I would be in favor of cloud streaming for demos and full downloading

14:46.640 --> 14:53.120
for games that I buy. I love that as an option and I really hope that is a place that Microsoft

14:53.120 --> 14:57.680
is considering going. Like if they're really going to get this thing right, like I would love

14:57.680 --> 15:03.440
the download it and play, or, you know, maybe you're on the go on your phone or just for

15:03.440 --> 15:08.160
whatever reason, for bandwidth reasons, use one stream or a demo or what have you. I would love

15:08.160 --> 15:13.840
options. Do they still have that option with, I know Sony was doing it for a while where they

15:13.840 --> 15:19.280
would have these games that they'd put out as like a, it's not even really a trial. It was a full game

15:19.280 --> 15:25.920
trial where you get an hour or two to play the game and try it out. And if you wanted to play

15:25.920 --> 15:31.200
more, you could just purchase the game and then play from there. Otherwise, you know, you could

15:31.200 --> 15:36.000
just check out like a section of the game. I don't know if Microsoft's done that. Somebody in chat

15:36.000 --> 15:39.920
would have to help me out with that. Um, PlayStation's also unique though, that it has that

15:39.920 --> 15:44.160
whole share play thing. So like, if you just want to try it for, and people kind of forget it's

15:44.160 --> 15:48.160
there, but it's a great feature. If you just want to try a friend's game, that is also a cloud-based

15:48.160 --> 15:53.200
solution, essentially. Uh, it's, it's different, but you're essentially streaming a video game that

15:53.200 --> 15:57.360
you can try yourself. And I think that's how I played Bloodborne for the first time was through

15:57.360 --> 16:04.000
share play. Um, so that's an option. Um, but as far as the time things, I always associate that

16:04.000 --> 16:08.080
with Steam because Steam does those free game weekends all the time. Like they just had DJ Max

16:08.080 --> 16:12.240
not that long ago. It was like a free game weekend and they do that kind of stuff all the time. I

16:12.240 --> 16:17.200
don't know if Microsoft's done it. Somebody in chat would have to help me out. Yeah, it was a little bit different than

16:17.200 --> 16:22.640
those free game weekends. Cause I know they still do those. It was, um, like once a month they would

16:22.640 --> 16:28.880
pick like several games that they would allow you to play one or two hours of for free. And I think

16:28.880 --> 16:32.640
it was even like a perk of PlayStation Plus or something like that, where it's like full game

16:32.640 --> 16:38.240
demos or full game trials. And then, um, once you play those, you could like, if you could beat the

16:38.240 --> 16:43.360
game in like an hour or whatever, then cool, you'd be able to buy it. But, um, I think you could also

16:43.360 --> 16:48.400
purchase those games as well. It was kind of a way to like save from the developers having to

16:48.400 --> 16:54.320
create, you know, unique demos for the games or, or, you know, I also like with the ones that they do

16:54.320 --> 16:59.200
where the demo is completely separate from the actual game. Like they did that, I guess it wasn't

16:59.200 --> 17:06.080
necessarily a demo, but it was, um, like a prologue or something like that. Like Dead Rising 2 did

17:06.080 --> 17:11.360
something like that. They had a prologue. Um, I don't know. I'm just curious. I can't wait to see what they have.

17:11.360 --> 17:16.640
Um, some more comments from chat, and this is a really good one from Hype Mayhem that says for

17:16.640 --> 17:21.920
games, I'm against streaming. If only because if your internet goes out, shit out of luck, which,

17:21.920 --> 17:26.000
you know, for all this stuff that we're sitting here going, data caps, there's, you know, when

17:26.000 --> 17:31.440
we're talking about our fast internet, there's some people out there that live in rural parts

17:31.440 --> 17:37.360
of the country or Alaska or Zach Def pointed out Mexico that are going like, hmm, must be nice to

17:37.360 --> 17:44.000
have fast internet so you can even do cloud gaming in the first place. Hmm. So there's that whole

17:44.000 --> 17:49.040
angle too, is that if cloud streaming were the only way to do it, that's not really going to work for

17:49.040 --> 17:54.960
everybody either. It'll work for a big chunk of the population in the countries that they tend to

17:54.960 --> 18:02.000
focus on first, uh, US, Canada, the, uh, the, the Europe regions that they are in and so forth, but

18:02.000 --> 18:07.680
it may not work for everybody. So that's a very interesting call out too, which is why choice

18:07.680 --> 18:12.720
would be great. Um, but there may be reasons why they don't want you to have choice. I don't know,

18:12.720 --> 18:19.600
but I just, I, the perfect next Xbox, in my opinion, would have cloud streaming or

18:20.640 --> 18:27.760
download and play on your own side at the touch of a button, which one could argue Sony started

18:27.760 --> 18:32.640
to kind of have that in place with PlayStation now, but I don't think it's quite as seamless

18:32.640 --> 18:37.280
as I think we would like. Right. Shouldn't it just be like a little switch before you launch the game

18:37.280 --> 18:43.520
play on the X cloud play local, right? Yeah. And well, PlayStation now, I mean,

18:43.520 --> 18:48.960
it just certainly doesn't have the appeal that, you know, something like game pass has. So

18:48.960 --> 18:55.440
I think they really need to figure out that how Sony has a chance to step it up with PlayStation

18:55.440 --> 19:00.400
five. Like they have every ability to say, okay, so here's the new version of PlayStation now on

19:00.400 --> 19:05.120
the PlayStation five and they can reinvent it any way they want really. So there is that.

19:05.120 --> 19:08.160
But I don't think they're right now in a position where they think that they're

19:08.160 --> 19:13.120
threatened by, I think they're just like, yeah, we're, we're the number one, you know, game in

19:13.120 --> 19:18.080
town right now. And so we're not going to do anything. So I think the ones that have the most

19:18.080 --> 19:23.280
loser are going to be the ones that innovate more. So we'll see, you know, more from the Microsoft

19:23.280 --> 19:27.760
side of things than we would Sony until Sony gets beaten down and then they'll finally get their

19:27.760 --> 19:32.160
act together. Interesting, interesting way to put it. I don't, I don't know if Sony's necessarily,

19:32.160 --> 19:36.800
I mean, it all, for me, like all of this technical stuff, like at the end of the day,

19:36.800 --> 19:41.680
a lot of it doesn't matter. I mean, it does, but it's not going to matter nearly as much as

19:41.680 --> 19:47.040
what do those launch games look like? Like which system has the games that people are going to go

19:47.040 --> 19:51.360
for and, you know, Microsoft's likely going to come out with a new halo right out the gate.

19:51.360 --> 19:57.680
I think we all know that. Um, but Microsoft also has that interesting, you know, complex complexity

19:57.680 --> 20:03.520
where you kind of don't have to buy the new console. The new halo will still work on your

20:03.520 --> 20:11.280
old Xbox, right? So they're not exactly encouraging people to upgrade either, but I can also see if

20:11.280 --> 20:15.760
you're Microsoft and you're trailing in the game a little bit right now, you're just happy to have

20:15.760 --> 20:21.520
people in your ecosystem. Like every Game Pass subscription is a giant fucking victory, right?

20:21.520 --> 20:28.560
And Game Pass, you know, I, I use it. I do think it's great, honestly. Um, so, um, yeah, I just,

20:29.120 --> 20:32.800
it's, it's just going to be very interesting to see what the, uh, console wars look like in just

20:32.800 --> 20:39.600
a few months. And once we really know everything about these new systems, so, um, Pele Hanumeo with

20:39.600 --> 20:45.120
another point in our chat saying internet speed is fine. It's the 4,000 mile round trip to streaming

20:45.120 --> 20:51.520
servers. That's the problem. So you and I are a little spoiled in Northern California, whereas

20:51.520 --> 20:56.000
almost assuredly in Silicon Valley, which is less than a two hour drive from here, there's always

20:56.000 --> 21:00.960
going to be a server of some sort. So we don't have to worry about, uh, when I play Final Fantasy

21:00.960 --> 21:07.120
14 online, those data centers are in a Thomas, they moved him to the Thomas. So I have a great

21:07.120 --> 21:12.880
ping in that game because they're in my fricking backyard practically. So, uh, you're right. The

21:12.880 --> 21:18.720
distance for how far it is to the servers is going to be an issue as well. So yeah. Anyway,

21:19.360 --> 21:23.280
um, anything else we want to say on the demos? It feels like there's not too much else to say

21:23.280 --> 21:27.200
until they're actually out and we know what all to be playing, but it's exciting. It is making a

21:27.200 --> 21:32.480
comeback. Yeah. It's not just, you know, the demos as well. I believe that the actual show that

21:32.480 --> 21:37.760
they're doing, the digital show is on the 21st as well. So that whole week, we're going to get some

21:37.760 --> 21:43.840
more news about the Xbox and what's going on there. So very exciting. Only a few more weeks

21:43.840 --> 21:48.960
away. Yeah. That's only what about, uh, two, two weeks to change away. That's cool. All right.

21:48.960 --> 21:52.880
Awesome. All right. Well, let's get into, um, we haven't been streaming a lot of demos this

21:52.880 --> 21:55.920
weekend. Well, maybe you have, I don't know. Well, let's talk about the types of games that we have

21:55.920 --> 22:00.320
been playing this week and how was your gaming week again, dark soccer has the night off. She's

22:00.320 --> 22:04.720
taking care of some personal issues tonight. She will be back next week with us. So we'll get her

22:04.720 --> 22:13.040
gaming week then for now, uh, Loki. It's been all Minecraft pretty much. So, uh, I've been working

22:13.040 --> 22:18.640
on stuff with the realm and everything, and, uh, I was trying to add more add-ons to the game. So

22:18.640 --> 22:26.880
those are like the mods for, uh, bedrock. And so a lot of it ended up being trying to get the server

22:26.880 --> 22:34.640
to cooperate because I tried to upload everything with it and it won't upload sometimes when they

22:34.640 --> 22:39.680
have some network issues. And then the other times that it does upload because of certain

22:39.680 --> 22:47.200
restrictions that they have on, um, the realms, which is there's parts, I don't know what exactly

22:47.200 --> 22:52.800
is deemed experimental gameplay, but it's one of the options that they have in your actual worlds

22:52.800 --> 22:58.240
that you make is with these add-ons. Some of them require experimental game gameplay in order to run

22:58.240 --> 23:04.800
and realms is supposed to not support that. And so that causes your add-ons to break in very

23:04.800 --> 23:10.560
different ways each time. So I was trying to get some, a few on there just to kind of add some more

23:10.560 --> 23:15.200
difficulty to the game, like add some more mobs and everything. And the problem I was having,

23:15.200 --> 23:20.080
well, I had lots of problems. So the first one I wanted to add was the Minecraft earth, um,

23:20.080 --> 23:24.480
characters or the mobs that are from that game, which it doesn't really change anything. It just

23:24.480 --> 23:29.200
makes things look a little bit different, which is kind of cool. Uh, none of that worked, uh, or

23:29.200 --> 23:34.880
if they were spawning, they're all invisible. And then I had an issue where I tried getting these

23:34.880 --> 23:41.200
mutant creatures to spawn and I had purposefully removed the creeper out of the game because

23:41.920 --> 23:46.720
that thing just explodes like crazy and will tear apart everything that you have.

23:46.720 --> 23:53.440
I'm like, okay, I don't want that near my house, blowing a hole in the house. So I purposefully

23:53.440 --> 23:58.720
took it out of there. Well, when I uploaded it to the realm, somehow it's still there.

23:58.720 --> 24:03.760
Cause I think what happens is it'll actually, they have a key that's associated with each add-on.

24:03.760 --> 24:09.200
And because of that, I think copies that stuff over. So if it's already in their database,

24:09.200 --> 24:13.840
it may just, you know, pull it from there. So the modifications I made didn't seem to go through,

24:13.840 --> 24:19.280
but it was invisible as well. So big hole, thankfully I was smart and backed up my

24:19.280 --> 24:24.960
stuff when I'm doing all that. So I ended up making a few modifications. I did get one to work,

24:24.960 --> 24:33.040
uh, which was they have the brand new mob Strider. It's a, uh, little creature that walks on lava.

24:33.040 --> 24:37.440
So I made one that's in the overworld, like called a depth Strider. And so that's kind of

24:37.440 --> 24:43.280
cool. So I made it for my kids cause they wanted a Strider to walk around with on, um, the overworld,

24:43.280 --> 24:47.760
but they die in water. So, and it rains all the time by our house. So I had to do something

24:47.760 --> 24:52.800
different. So I did all that. And then I've been having issues with, um, mob spawning in my house.

24:52.800 --> 24:58.560
So like right before I logged off today, um, my son doesn't know it yet, but there are skeletons

24:58.560 --> 25:04.160
that spawned up in our main living room and it killed one of his birds. So, uh, we'll have to

25:04.160 --> 25:09.360
respond that one. Um, but yeah, it just running into all sorts of weird stuff, especially with

25:09.360 --> 25:14.000
the new update that came out a couple of weeks ago, it's changed how stuff spawns in the game.

25:14.000 --> 25:19.760
And so even though if you keep, you're supposed to be able to keep the light levels high enough

25:19.760 --> 25:24.640
to where they won't spawn, that's how it knows whether you have a house or not, or like a base

25:24.640 --> 25:30.160
or whatever. If you keep the light levels up, it should, the rules should, uh, cause it not to

25:30.160 --> 25:35.840
spawn in your house. Something is broken right now, which happens with any update and it's not

25:35.840 --> 25:41.040
working correctly. So I'm having stuff, even though I've lit up everything, I'm having mobs

25:41.040 --> 25:46.560
spawn all over the place. Also could be because our base is like five stories tall. Um, so it

25:46.560 --> 25:51.040
might be something that involved with that, but it's, it's causing problems. Meanwhile,

25:51.040 --> 25:54.800
I dig a hole into the side of a cliff and that's where I live in Minecraft.

25:56.640 --> 26:01.600
Like I, I've thought about streaming some of it, but like, we've already gotten so far into it

26:01.600 --> 26:07.280
already. Um, but like, it's just, it's a complete system right now. We've got like automatic sorting

26:07.280 --> 26:13.680
systems and, um, mob farms all over the place. It's just, it's elaborate right now. So maybe

26:13.680 --> 26:18.560
later when we reboot the whole thing again, we, we can, um, people probably wouldn't mind a tour

26:18.560 --> 26:22.560
of the current space. Like I, I would still be willing to stream animal crossing, even though

26:22.560 --> 26:27.040
I haven't gotten it from the very beginning, but I could show everybody how the roses roses have

26:27.040 --> 26:32.880
grown out of control on my Island because it rains all the flipping time. Yeah. So we, we beat the

26:32.880 --> 26:39.360
other dragon today. Uh, I was building, um, cause I have a network of tunnels in the, the end or

26:39.360 --> 26:45.040
not the end of the nether to go to all these different, um, biomes that are not near our house.

26:45.040 --> 26:50.960
So I have all that. And then a new update added this thing called souls. It's like a soul speed

26:50.960 --> 26:54.880
or something like that. And so if you're running on soul sand, which normally slows you down,

26:54.880 --> 26:59.760
it'll actually speed you up. So I just put that on the floor and all my tunnels and you can zip

26:59.760 --> 27:04.080
around like the whole map. So the next thing we're doing is going to the Woodland mansion,

27:04.080 --> 27:08.640
which is another like kind of boss area. And then there's, um, a few other things we have to do when

27:08.640 --> 27:12.800
they were pretty much done. It's just kind of adding on to it. Um, so that's what we've been

27:12.800 --> 27:18.400
doing. And then, um, aside from that, of course, or not, I've been playing that, um, I did download

27:18.400 --> 27:22.720
the Ironman VR game, but I just didn't get a chance to set it up and play it, but I know my kids

27:22.720 --> 27:28.480
want to play that. So. I have been taking areas like crazy in Orna. I'm becoming that person that

27:28.480 --> 27:32.560
we all hated in the beginning. Well, there's people taking stuff back from me, but I've been

27:32.560 --> 27:39.520
like, um, I've been trying to just, you know, you keep, um, spamming it and you eventually take them.

27:39.520 --> 27:45.360
So yeah. Yeah. All right. That's it. Well, then my gaming week, I I've also been playing a bit

27:45.360 --> 27:50.080
of Orna as usual, kind of the good old standby has been playing a little more Pokemon go as well

27:50.080 --> 27:55.200
with the new event that's going on that kind of leads into the Pokemon go, uh, summer faster or

27:55.200 --> 27:59.280
go fest. That's anywhere this year, obviously, because of everything going on in the world.

27:59.280 --> 28:04.000
Um, but they have some events leading into it and, uh, they released a new duck Pokemon whose

28:04.000 --> 28:08.960
name escapes me right now. It's like, it's like duck monitor. So it's very generic name. Somebody

28:08.960 --> 28:12.800
will say it in chat, but they just released that. And then they have all these little quests,

28:12.800 --> 28:17.920
uh, where if you catch so many Pokemon and like throw an excellent and all these things,

28:17.920 --> 28:23.360
uh, it's supposed to, if a lot of trainers do it, unlock new Pokemon that will be available during

28:23.360 --> 28:28.320
go fest, which you know, the trainers are going to complete it. They always do. I've never seen

28:28.320 --> 28:33.520
them actually hold back on anything. So thank you, ducklet. Thank you. Act F say I knew it was a very

28:33.520 --> 28:38.000
generic kind of name, uh, but that's still fun. And, uh, it's nice to have like little new things

28:38.000 --> 28:41.760
here and there and Pokemon go keeps that game motivating, uh, and still playing ingress. Of

28:41.760 --> 28:46.640
course, always, uh, good to see people. There was a ingress, a virtual event that happened yesterday

28:46.640 --> 28:50.640
where it's kind of like, we're going to all play ingress at the same time in our house, but since

28:50.640 --> 28:54.080
we can't do anything but recharge, that's what we're going to do is have a recharge party.

28:54.080 --> 28:58.160
So it's interesting, but I, Hey, that's what they got to do right now. It's the responsible thing

28:58.160 --> 29:03.600
to do. We can all like meet at a restaurant like we used to do. Um, okay. So outside the usuals,

29:03.600 --> 29:09.200
let's talk about some of the new stuff and I bet you guys want to hear about this. All right. So

29:09.200 --> 29:13.280
this week, uh, on Monday, and I've been teasing this for the past couple of weeks is that I

29:13.280 --> 29:17.680
ordered myself a birthday present. So my birthday was at the end of last month. And so I spent a

29:17.680 --> 29:22.400
little bit of money, uh, and bought myself something on arcade one up that I wanted for,

29:22.400 --> 29:26.960
I, I wanted an arcade one up machine. I didn't have one yet. And I was like, I'm going to buy

29:26.960 --> 29:30.560
one when there there's a game that comes out where I'm like, Ooh, I got to have that. I almost bought

29:30.560 --> 29:34.240
the mortal combat one, but I never did. Cause I was like, Oh, we don't have room for it. We don't

29:34.240 --> 29:37.760
have room for it. And then earlier this year, they announced the thing that finally got me

29:38.400 --> 29:42.560
a burger time arcade cabinet burger times. You know, those who've been listening to OLR a long

29:42.560 --> 29:48.640
time burger times, one of my jams from the 1980s. I remember that game as a kid. And not only did

29:48.640 --> 29:53.760
they release a bird time cabinet, they released a limited edition burger time cabinet. So they're

29:53.760 --> 30:00.560
only going to make like, it's something like 3,200, no 3075 of these. And based on my certificate,

30:00.560 --> 30:05.920
I have machine number 2,604. So I think that's right. Or was it 2,406? I forget,

30:05.920 --> 30:11.360
but it's one of those ways. Uh, so I, I did get one of these machines and it's got four games on

30:11.360 --> 30:18.240
it. It's got a burger time, bad dudes, karate champ and caveman ninja. And, uh, the machine

30:18.240 --> 30:22.400
took me about two and a half hours to build. And you probably want to see what the darn thing

30:22.400 --> 30:26.560
looks like. So let me just show some of the footage here on stream, uh, that I shot in the

30:26.560 --> 30:31.520
living room where I put this. And, uh, it probably took me about two and a half hours to build.

30:31.520 --> 30:38.720
And it is, uh, similar to building Ikea furniture, but I actually found it to be a little bit easier

30:38.720 --> 30:43.760
than building Ikea furniture because they actually put all the different parts in little bags.

30:43.760 --> 30:50.240
They're like, use a screw from the A bag, use a wooden thing from the B bag and so forth. Um,

30:50.240 --> 30:55.440
and so, uh, it was actually, it wasn't so bad to put together. I was able to do it mostly myself.

30:56.080 --> 30:59.840
And I'm not saying that in a flex kind of way. I'm saying that in a, this really wasn't that bad

30:59.840 --> 31:03.760
type of way. The hardest part were the hinges, because you can see, if you're looking at the

31:03.760 --> 31:08.160
video, you can see the monitor is slanted. Like you would expect an old, old arcade machine to be.

31:08.160 --> 31:13.440
And so it has to slant just right against the two side panels. So you have to attach these hinge

31:13.440 --> 31:19.760
parts. Uh, and that was the hardest part by far. And, uh, I needed Alan's help on that to shine

31:19.760 --> 31:24.320
a light because I couldn't see everything I was doing. So I was like, come over here and shine

31:24.320 --> 31:31.680
a light, uh, right in this spot so I can see what I'm doing. Um, anyway, so you can see in the video

31:31.680 --> 31:35.040
for those that are watching on Twitch, it just ran through the whole little boot up sequence.

31:35.120 --> 31:39.120
You choose your game, you hit the button to start it. And then there I am playing burger time. Of

31:39.120 --> 31:42.400
course, it's kind of hard to play the game appropriately with one hand while you're

31:42.400 --> 31:46.720
filming with the other. Cause you probably see my fat reflection there in the monitor,

31:46.720 --> 31:49.520
but whatever, but there you go. I am making my way through the game. And I think that's

31:49.520 --> 31:56.320
about where the B roll ends there. So, so who, who, who's asked in there and knows the high score

31:56.320 --> 32:03.040
second place is it might be me. Uh, excuse me, second place and fifth place. Thank you.

32:06.000 --> 32:10.640
Okay. So yeah. Yeah. So I act like I'm 11, whatever. Yes. I put ass as the initials.

32:10.640 --> 32:15.440
I do it every time. Well, not every time I used to put VOG in. Uh, and I still, if I,

32:15.440 --> 32:20.000
if I'm at a professional environment, like when I'm at California extreme,

32:20.000 --> 32:24.560
I will put VOG as the initials as a cheap plug for our little network here.

32:24.560 --> 32:28.560
But when I'm in the privacy of my own home, it's all about ass.

32:28.720 --> 32:35.440
All right. Uh, so, uh, looking in chat, uh, at some of the comments,

32:35.440 --> 32:41.840
Vidpower 573 says, love that classic burger time game music. Yep. Uh, bonds double 06 also spotted

32:41.840 --> 32:47.280
the high scores. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, Questbuster says classic burger time. So good. Yeah, it was,

32:47.280 --> 32:54.160
it was, uh, it was, it was great. Like it was, it was, it, it looks very sharp on that LCD monitor.

32:54.160 --> 32:57.600
You know, it's, it's different cause it's not a CRT monitor like the eighties. So it does look

32:57.600 --> 33:02.320
a little different, but I mean, come on, y'all have played maim. I know you have. So you've

33:02.320 --> 33:06.720
probably played these games on a modern monitor, but there's something about the actual like

33:06.720 --> 33:11.360
correct resolution on that screen. And it's a nice vertical fit. Like it's not like you're trying to

33:11.360 --> 33:14.880
play burger time on your, your wide screen monitor. We have this black space. There's

33:14.880 --> 33:19.200
something about the way it fills out the screen just perfectly. That is, is very refreshing quite

33:19.200 --> 33:22.960
frankly. Um, so I played a little bit of burger time of course, and then I played some of the

33:22.960 --> 33:26.960
other games too. I played karate champ, which is why there's two joysticks for each side on that

33:26.960 --> 33:31.520
thing. I don't know if you saw when I was running the bureau again, but you'll notice the, the

33:31.520 --> 33:36.800
machine actually has four sticks on it. That's because each player needs two sticks in karate

33:36.800 --> 33:40.880
champ. So even though everything is decked out in burger time, it still has everything. You only

33:40.880 --> 33:46.560
need one button for burger time too. You don't need two. Um, so for other games like caveman ninja

33:46.560 --> 33:51.600
and, um, I think bad dudes may have used two buttons as well. That's the one game I haven't

33:51.600 --> 33:57.280
played yet is bad dudes because Alan played bad dudes on the cabinet. And that's when Mr. Smoosh

33:57.280 --> 34:02.560
decided this is my cabinet now. And he decided he found his way out of jump on top of that and

34:02.560 --> 34:06.480
so forth. And you know how that goes. Oops. You know how that goes when you're a cat owner. So

34:07.040 --> 34:12.960
all right. Um, Questbuster says, wow, those cabs look great. They really do. I, I I'm pretty

34:12.960 --> 34:18.640
impressed. Like I'm going to be honest. I want to buy another one. Um, and one of my friends,

34:18.640 --> 34:21.600
one of my friends has really gotten into collecting them and was like,

34:21.600 --> 34:28.480
Hey Rob, Hey, Hey, the Walmart in, uh, Auburn right now has the Pac-Man one for 50 bucks.

34:28.480 --> 34:34.240
And I'm like, number one, fuck you for telling me that. Number two, fuck you again for telling

34:34.240 --> 34:41.440
me that when you know, I want one of these things. Number three, the full size Pac-Man one,

34:41.440 --> 34:44.960
because that's been out for how long now? They're probably unloading it. I don't know if it's still

34:44.960 --> 34:49.760
there. Loki. I see you making a face. I I'd have to ask my friend. That's not a bad, like,

34:49.760 --> 34:54.800
I don't need it, but you kind of want it so you can hack the shit out of it. I know you do.

34:58.160 --> 35:02.160
I know we're watching the gears turn in Loki's. We're watching him plot live on air

35:02.960 --> 35:06.960
as 200 mats. Like the wheels are turning in Loki's mind. Dr. T says,

35:06.960 --> 35:11.760
yeah, that's how it starts handicap in the garage. You can't, I can't, it's just the, um,

35:11.760 --> 35:15.520
any of the monitor replaced or fixed or something because the monitor doesn't turn on,

35:15.520 --> 35:20.800
but it monitors fixed. I mean, I have Mame on had Mame on there. I took the computer apart, but

35:20.800 --> 35:26.960
I never built a new one anyways, but in all ideal situations, I have a dedicated system to do that.

35:26.960 --> 35:30.240
And it's six buttons and everything like that. Yeah. It's the one that used to be here in the

35:30.240 --> 35:37.360
studio. No. Oh no. Different one. No, I have an actual, it's a Sega Astro city. It's a,

35:37.760 --> 35:41.360
like, like the ones you'd see, uh, arcade infinity. They used to play like,

35:42.640 --> 35:49.920
okay. Yeah. So yeah, it's like those, um, it's just the monitors. It's a, you know, a CGA,

35:50.560 --> 35:56.880
a CRT and it's, it doesn't, I don't know what happened when I moved it out of the house into

35:56.880 --> 36:02.560
the garage. Like I tested it before I left, you know, moved it and it was fine. And I moved in

36:02.560 --> 36:07.360
the garage and it sat in there for like a little bit and I tried doing it again and it doesn't

36:07.360 --> 36:12.080
power on anymore. It's old. So I, it seems to be repaired, but who are you going to get to repair

36:12.080 --> 36:17.760
that? And like, I don't want to touch those high, I don't want to touch any of those capacitors to,

36:17.760 --> 36:23.200
you know, ground those out to replace the, whatever. I don't know how to fix any of that

36:23.200 --> 36:29.520
stuff. So I got to find someone to do it. Um, yeah. And, and I, I really do want another

36:29.520 --> 36:33.040
cabinet. Like I already, I kind of want that mortal combat trilogy one, because I know Alan

36:33.040 --> 36:37.360
will be into that one as well. Um, and you know, there's other new ones that are coming out that

36:37.360 --> 36:41.280
I want, but the reality is I, and I promised Alan, I'm putting the brakes on it. I'm not going to

36:41.280 --> 36:45.280
actually buy another one. So hopefully I don't miss out on too many of them or they reprint or

36:45.280 --> 36:52.160
something. Um, until we, and I don't, I don't want to speak too much out of turn, but once this

36:52.160 --> 36:56.160
COVID thing gets a little more under control, cause it's really bad, especially this month

36:56.160 --> 37:00.800
right now, but maybe in a month or two and things hopefully at least start to go down significantly

37:00.800 --> 37:06.960
again. And it's not as crazy as it is right now. Uh, Alan and I are looking into buying our own

37:06.960 --> 37:11.200
home as opposed to renting one finally, uh, finally becoming big boys and getting our own

37:11.200 --> 37:17.520
home. And the nice thing about that is that, um, you know, then we, uh, won't be beholden to

37:17.520 --> 37:23.280
how many pets we can own and things like that. So the deal is when we buy our own home, the reward

37:23.280 --> 37:30.400
is Alan gets to have another cat and I benefit from that too. And then I get to have more arcade

37:30.400 --> 37:34.960
cabinets and Alan benefits a little bit from that too. So, uh, that's, that's the deal. So I'm hoping

37:34.960 --> 37:38.320
fingers and toes crossed, and I hope I'm not talking too much out of turn, but the ironic thing

37:38.320 --> 37:43.040
is by the time we all return to OLR in the same place, we might not actually be in the same place

37:43.040 --> 37:48.880
anymore. It's fine. It'll be, it'll be a nice little reboot whenever that happens. So we'll see.

37:49.680 --> 37:54.080
Yeah. So yeah, I, again, I don't know that that process could take like a year. I don't know how

37:54.080 --> 37:57.360
it's going to take. I don't even know if I, we have the money for it, but we've been saving

37:57.360 --> 38:02.160
for a little bit. So that'll be nice. Anyway, enough personal stuff. Let's get back to, um,

38:02.160 --> 38:06.480
some of the other things that I've been playing this week. So one of the other games I've been

38:06.480 --> 38:10.960
playing this week, animal crossing, of course, um, you might think same old, same old, but I

38:10.960 --> 38:15.440
was reinvigorated a little bit on animal crossing with the whole deep sea diving thing. Uh, that's

38:15.440 --> 38:19.520
kind of cool. And it gives new stuff to collect and it's not like there's only like four things

38:19.520 --> 38:24.800
in the ocean right now. Uh, there's at least like 10 or 12 probably that I've found so far. So

38:24.800 --> 38:28.960
there's a variety of things to find in the ocean right now. And it was, it's a nice little kick in

38:28.960 --> 38:33.360
the butt that that game needed. Uh, because I feel like, Oh, I have a new thing I can do now.

38:33.360 --> 38:37.520
There's something new to collect and, Oh, there's this otter that will show up and give me random

38:37.520 --> 38:41.920
new, uh, furniture patterns and the mermaid set and so forth. And I really hope this is the type

38:41.920 --> 38:46.880
of little kick in the pants, the animal crossing keeps getting every month or every six weeks or

38:46.880 --> 38:50.400
so. Uh, cause I think that's going to keep the game really exciting. I'm, I'm sure it's just

38:50.400 --> 38:55.440
a matter of time before we have some like substantial DLC for this game. Like Nintendo

38:55.440 --> 39:00.000
would be fools not to do that. Um, but the free content updates that we're getting in the meantime,

39:00.000 --> 39:03.600
or I guess if we get a lot of free content updates, they don't actually sell any DLC.

39:03.600 --> 39:08.400
That's cool too. Um, but I would think Nintendo would be morons not to try to sell some DLC at

39:08.400 --> 39:12.960
some point. Um, I don't know what they'll do. We'll see. So anyway,

39:12.960 --> 39:16.320
Yeah, it would be interesting to see what they're going to do to expand on that. I mean,

39:16.320 --> 39:18.320
I'm surprised that they haven't had any DLC yet.

39:20.160 --> 39:25.600
Uh, some folks in chat, I'm just taking a look at a chat as 200. Matt says buying smoosh, a home

39:25.600 --> 39:30.480
y'all are renting from him. Yeah. Uh, Bobby Blackwell says dedicated studio space, studio

39:30.480 --> 39:35.920
smoosh. Well, technically we kind of, I mean like this is the family room in our house that we rent

39:35.920 --> 39:41.200
right now and it's a dedicated studio space. My husband lets me get away with a lot of shit. Um,

39:41.200 --> 39:48.320
but he knew, he knew what he was marrying. So he knew he would be marrying a radio show as well as

39:48.320 --> 39:55.600
me. So, uh, it happened. Um, let's see a Tiberian chat says pocket camp has been getting good with

39:55.600 --> 40:00.320
doing a new event every few weeks. Like every month you get a larger event and three weekly

40:00.320 --> 40:05.440
smaller events. Yeah. So it would be cool if, um, the switch version adopts a similar rhythm and we

40:05.520 --> 40:09.520
see a lot of new things because just the little things like exploring the ocean is a big kick in

40:09.520 --> 40:14.400
the pants. All right. One more game I want to talk about that I played this week. That's new ish. Um,

40:14.400 --> 40:17.680
it actually came out a couple of weeks ago, but I just got around to playing it this week.

40:17.680 --> 40:22.400
So do you remember a couple of weeks ago, uh, when I was doing Japanese releases, I was talking

40:22.400 --> 40:27.520
about the Namcot collection or no, no, it was because of the story of the Pac-Man championship

40:27.520 --> 40:32.800
D make that's in the Namcot collection in Japan. Right. Well, that collection also came out here,

40:32.800 --> 40:36.720
uh, as I think it's, uh, the Namco, I don't know the official name of it, but it's like

40:36.720 --> 40:42.160
Namco collection volume one and volume two, and it's on switch and it's on PlayStation four.

40:42.160 --> 40:47.040
So I actually picked it up on PlayStation four, just because I don't know, trophies or, um, I

40:47.040 --> 40:50.640
don't know. I just picked up my places before, because that's where I wanted to buy it. I bought

40:50.640 --> 40:57.520
volume one so I could actually play that D make of Pac-Man championship edition. And it's pretty

40:57.520 --> 41:01.520
cool. I gotta say, um, I, I should have grabbed some B roll for tonight, but I didn't have the

41:01.520 --> 41:06.720
PS four in the studio. Sorry guys. Um, but it's cool. And I guess, I guess some news is coming

41:06.720 --> 41:12.000
out this week that Namco may have adopted that from a ROM that somebody did in 2008.

41:12.560 --> 41:17.280
So it might actually be like a legitimized ROM hack of sorts. It's interesting,

41:17.280 --> 41:23.120
but I thought it was neat how the whole screen goes back and forth to kind of make up for

41:23.120 --> 41:27.440
the limitations of the NES. It's kind of, it's interesting. I like that. And then of course,

41:27.440 --> 41:31.360
there's a ton of other games. It's, you know, a lot of the, and it's pretty much nothing,

41:31.360 --> 41:37.680
but any S ROMs, uh, you know, things like dig, Doug, tower of Druaga, uh, things like that.

41:37.680 --> 41:43.360
But what's interesting. I think they retained all the Japanese releases because they all say

41:43.360 --> 41:48.080
NAM caught at the bottom. When you launch into the games, I don't remember that being the case

41:48.080 --> 41:52.560
in the U S and I don't think all these games even came out in the U S on the NES or Famicom,

41:52.560 --> 41:57.920
whatever. In fact, I know one of them is new in volume one and I forget the full name of the

41:57.920 --> 42:02.320
game. Sorry. Maybe somebody knows in chat, but there's like a cutesy splatter house.

42:03.520 --> 42:07.680
Um, I know that sounds a little weird cutesy splatter house, but if you think about it,

42:07.680 --> 42:14.880
the NES couldn't handle the realism of splatter house, it couldn't handle those types of graphics.

42:14.880 --> 42:19.520
You remember that game? So they have like a cutesy cartoony version that came out and that

42:19.520 --> 42:24.000
is in this collection. And what's interesting. I know it never came out in the U S and what's

42:24.000 --> 42:29.040
interesting about it. The title screen is still in Japanese, but they translated the text in the

42:29.040 --> 42:34.320
game. So it's like another kind of like new thing that's in the collection. And I think that's

42:34.320 --> 42:38.800
really cool. So I did buy volume one and overall, yeah, it's a, it's a solid little collection of

42:38.800 --> 42:43.440
games. It's 20 bucks. I'm not sure if everybody's going to want to drop that kind of money

42:43.440 --> 42:48.960
on some retro. I love retro games though. So it was fine for me. I'll probably pick up volume

42:48.960 --> 42:52.640
two eventually as well, uh, because there's some really cool games in volume two as well.

42:52.640 --> 42:58.240
I'm going to talk about one of them a little later. So, um, anyway, Bobby says in the future,

42:58.240 --> 43:02.080
you don't need to bring the PS4 in the studio. Just hit the share button, capture 15 minutes

43:02.080 --> 43:06.720
of video and move it to a USB stick. I always forget that you can move the video to a USB stick,

43:07.360 --> 43:13.520
but I'll do that. I will remember that in the future. So, uh, yeah. So I, I thought that was

43:13.520 --> 43:19.040
a nice little collection. So I enjoyed playing that. So, uh, the, the U S version of the Namcock

43:19.040 --> 43:23.600
collection, I approve, uh, and I'll show you some of the championship edition either on a personal

43:23.600 --> 43:27.200
stream or maybe, maybe I'll do a follow-up video. That's something I've been looking at doing is

43:27.200 --> 43:33.040
trying to do some follow-up like content. Um, so maybe we'll do a, uh, uh, a breakout on, uh,

43:33.040 --> 43:38.000
championship edition a little later on in the make. So, uh, okay. That's it for my gaming week.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.320
So let's move on. Um, before I get into the news, I have a little bit of housekeeping I want to get

43:42.320 --> 43:46.560
into. Uh, sorry, Loki. I didn't warn you about this. I need to do a little bit of a tangent.

43:46.560 --> 43:50.240
It has nothing to do with this show. It has nothing to do. Well, a little bit has to do

43:50.240 --> 43:59.760
with podcasting. So let me get into it a little bit. Um, I got some somewhat difficult news

43:59.760 --> 44:08.400
yesterday that, uh, a long time listener that of my show, Hoard House. Um, and you guys may or

44:08.400 --> 44:14.640
may not remember, I had a show, I think it was around 2012 to 2000. No, it was probably 2011 to

44:14.640 --> 44:18.880
2014, give or take a year. So look, it's been a while. I had a show called Hoard House. It was

44:18.880 --> 44:25.200
dedicated to World of Warcraft and it was hosted with my buddies, Extifer, Shane, and, uh, Grandpa,

44:25.200 --> 44:29.440
or you know him as Captain Matt on Starboard Power Coupling. You've, you've heard all these people on

44:29.440 --> 44:33.760
OLR at some point or another, but we used to have a World of Warcraft based show. And through that,

44:33.760 --> 44:38.160
we had kind of a different audience than we would have here on OLR because the Warcraft community,

44:38.480 --> 44:43.280
is very tight knit. And, um, you know, there's a lot of awesome people that I met through that.

44:43.280 --> 44:47.120
It's the thing I miss most about doing Hoard House. I don't necessarily miss the game World

44:47.120 --> 44:51.440
of Warcraft. Um, but I miss the people that I met through it. Cause you know, like for example,

44:51.440 --> 44:55.600
Girls Gone Wow was an amazing show, uh, that used to be here at the Voice Geeks Network.

44:55.600 --> 44:59.760
They've continued on to Wow Radio and they're doing just fine. Uh, and I would have never met

44:59.760 --> 45:03.840
those gals if it wasn't for my time in World of Warcraft. And that's just one of many examples.

45:04.640 --> 45:08.960
So amongst doing the show Hoard House, and your guys are going to have to forgive me with my

45:08.960 --> 45:14.720
memory. I feel like he may have guest hosted even in one episode or something. Um, but we

45:14.720 --> 45:18.880
had a listener on that show. His name was Hastur. It was his online name. His real name was Steven.

45:18.880 --> 45:23.120
I can probably tell you that now. Um, but his online name was, was Hastur. And, um,

45:23.120 --> 45:27.200
he listened on, uh, Hoard House. He may have listened a couple of times to OLR,

45:27.200 --> 45:31.120
but I know he was more of a wow guy. So, um, that was a show that he was listening to in a

45:31.120 --> 45:36.800
minute through that. And interestingly enough, I don't know if it was because I think it was

45:36.800 --> 45:40.960
maybe a little bit because I used to talk about it a lot on Hoard House. I was starting to get

45:40.960 --> 45:47.120
into a game called Ingress, which I've still talked about on OLR to this day. Um, but I know

45:47.120 --> 45:53.280
that Hastur actually downloaded that game, joined the same team that I was on and kind of fell off

45:53.280 --> 46:00.640
the deep end on that game as I did, uh, uh, in that game. And so I ended up kind of interacting

46:00.640 --> 46:04.240
even after Hoard House was done and I wasn't really playing World of Warcraft anymore.

46:04.240 --> 46:09.440
I was still interacting with Hastur in Ingress related things. Uh, I met up with him at the

46:09.440 --> 46:14.960
big Chicago anomaly that I took OLR off to go attend, uh, Memorial day of last year. We had a

46:14.960 --> 46:21.200
big event here in Sacramento in October. He was here for that. Um, I'm using the past tense. So,

46:21.200 --> 46:26.400
you know, all know where this is headed. Um, Hastur passed away at the end of last week. Um,

46:26.400 --> 46:34.160
and I'm really, I'm really gutted about it. Um, you know, the listeners that we have that we're

46:34.160 --> 46:39.360
very fortunate to have here at Orange Laundry and I've said this many times before you guys are like

46:39.360 --> 46:45.600
an extended family. And, you know, obviously I got, this is one of those instances where I got

46:45.600 --> 46:52.240
to know somebody offline in person and interact with them. Maybe not every day. We weren't BFFs,

46:52.240 --> 46:57.120
but he was somebody I knew and I liked and I respected and I appreciated that he was

46:57.120 --> 47:04.000
supportive of many of the projects that I had done, um, previously. So it's, it's been,

47:04.640 --> 47:10.240
it's been hard. Yesterday was not an easy day when I got this news. Um, what's making this

47:10.240 --> 47:16.560
more difficult and more complicated is that the family suspects, the reason why he passed away

47:16.560 --> 47:26.880
was due to complications of COVID-19. Um, which he had been, I presumed positive like four days

47:26.880 --> 47:31.840
before he passed. Um, I think that means he had all the symptoms and talked to a doctor and the

47:31.840 --> 47:36.880
doctor went, yep, you probably have this. But because, uh, the system is so backed up with

47:36.880 --> 47:40.960
tests right now, because you're in Texas, which is one of the States that it's, you know, blown

47:40.960 --> 47:44.960
up everywhere. And again, I might be inserting my own dialogue in here, but for whatever reason,

47:44.960 --> 47:49.760
he didn't get an official test. Um, but the family is presuming it is, um, that situation.

47:50.400 --> 47:58.160
So like that just leaves me feeling even more frustrated and angry because I feel like

47:58.720 --> 48:04.160
something like this could have been preventable. And I know you guys don't like it sometimes,

48:04.160 --> 48:09.760
not all of you like it. When I get on my high horse here and I preach certain things that aren't

48:09.760 --> 48:16.000
necessarily about video games and things of that sort to which I say tonight, too fucking bad,

48:16.000 --> 48:22.240
because now this thing has consumed a friend of mine that I've met because of doing shows like

48:22.240 --> 48:27.920
this. And because of my love of video games and all this stuff that now are incompetent government,

48:27.920 --> 48:33.120
who, which has allowed this thing to spread way more than it ought to have. And because of

48:33.120 --> 48:41.280
incompetent fools and assholes that are so brazen enough to sit there and think that this thing is a

48:41.280 --> 48:47.200
lie or masks don't help. Even though all these scientists everywhere are seeing mass help,

48:47.200 --> 48:52.080
people will put images of the side of a box, say, look, it says it doesn't prevent COVID-19.

48:52.080 --> 48:58.880
No, you idiot. It doesn't prevent it, but it goes a long way in stopping the spread of it.

48:58.880 --> 49:05.360
Those disclaimers are on boxes of masks because they're not the N95 mask that medical providers

49:05.360 --> 49:10.160
are supposed to be used when they're exposed to the thing all day long. But when you go to a

49:10.160 --> 49:17.440
fucking bar or a restaurant or whatever it is, you can be bothered to put on a goddamn mask.

49:17.440 --> 49:25.840
I'm sick of this masks are a lie narrative. I am ready to fight people over this. If you believe

49:25.840 --> 49:34.640
that masks are a lie, I need you to fuck off because now this is fucking personal.

49:37.120 --> 49:40.800
A member of my family passed away this week because of this disease.

49:42.080 --> 49:50.000
Because some of y'all out there can't be bothered to take this seriously. And it, it's enraging.

49:50.000 --> 49:55.760
I'm just like, I can't even put words in my mouth right now because I will see things online that

49:55.760 --> 50:01.200
drive me nuts. Thank God, this is the weekend I also decided to deactivate Facebook because

50:01.200 --> 50:05.360
I'll tell you what, if I hadn't deactivated, I would have said something to get myself banned

50:05.360 --> 50:13.600
this weekend. Trust. Please take this seriously. And I know many of you all out there are.

50:15.120 --> 50:18.880
But to those that are pushing this narrative that it's a lie and all this stuff like,

50:18.880 --> 50:26.400
I hope, I hope you're comfortable with that choice.

50:28.080 --> 50:32.400
Because people that thought like that just took the life of a friend of mine.

50:40.640 --> 50:46.640
In chat over at Twitch TV slash vog network, Bobby Blackwell says in an RPG,

50:46.640 --> 50:49.200
if I get an accessory that gives me 30%

50:49.200 --> 50:53.600
disease resistance and the slot it goes in is open, I equip it immediately.

50:55.440 --> 51:00.880
Perfect analogy. Thank you. Sjoan under Matt says we have not flattened the curve as well

51:00.880 --> 51:03.600
as other countries because people are not taking this seriously.

51:04.400 --> 51:08.720
Dark Tetsuya says my wife and my dad are both immunocompromised. So they're both

51:08.720 --> 51:15.280
one idiot with a mask away from catching it. And DJ Rama S says in a way, I'm glad my mom is not

51:15.280 --> 51:20.480
alive for this. Because she was immunocompromised. If someone got her sick, I'd kill them personally.

51:21.360 --> 51:27.040
Rama, I am right there with you. And I've even said it on this show that like, I miss my mom

51:27.040 --> 51:32.800
every single day. But I am so happy she does not have to see this right now. I'm so happy she

51:32.800 --> 51:40.240
doesn't have to see this right now. Anyway, I had to vent a little bit. Ultimately, I said all that

51:40.240 --> 51:48.960
because I want to dedicate tonight's show to Hester's memory. And thank him for all the support

51:49.600 --> 51:56.080
over the years of podcasting and so forth. And I'm just I'm so sorry that this happened. And I

51:57.120 --> 52:02.560
I like that immediate next words that want to leave your mouth are, I wish it could have

52:02.560 --> 52:15.760
been prevented. Could have. Let's move on and talk about games. Loki.

52:17.280 --> 52:24.560
All right, so Nintendo has decided to finally fess up about the whole joy con drifting issue,

52:24.560 --> 52:31.280
although they didn't really have much to say. So this is coming from Nintendo of Japan president

52:32.240 --> 52:39.360
Shintaro Furukawa, who noted he apologizes for any trouble that the hardware has caused.

52:40.960 --> 52:44.800
But he can't speak more on the matter because there's a class action lawsuit going on.

52:46.400 --> 52:53.840
So while that's nice that he apologizes for the trouble, what are they doing to fix the problem

52:53.840 --> 52:59.120
aside from the three fixes that they were doing? But like I've had that already fixed, you know,

53:00.080 --> 53:07.520
all of my joy cons already. Well, I mean, I have two more to fix, but I've got the parts to do it.

53:08.400 --> 53:14.560
It's definitely something that's plaguing all of them. And it's something that he knows the design

53:14.560 --> 53:19.600
issue, then change the design, fix the problem. Don't just say sorry, sorry.

53:20.240 --> 53:25.680
Well, it is very interesting that they won't comment on it due to the ongoing lawsuit,

53:26.480 --> 53:32.000
which almost in some way gives that lawsuit a little more merit because I mean, that's also

53:32.000 --> 53:35.600
probably just part of procedure. I don't want to, you know, speak completely out of term,

53:35.600 --> 53:38.560
but it almost seems like there may be something here that Nintendo really is legitimately

53:38.560 --> 53:44.320
concerned with. I think it's just like the whole scenario like they did with not Nintendo,

53:44.320 --> 53:49.120
but Microsoft was with the red ring stuff. It's like basically to minimize, minimize, minimize

53:49.120 --> 53:55.680
until they're forced to take action because it's obvious that, you know, I think I don't remember

53:55.680 --> 54:01.120
if the red ring, I know that they had lawsuits with that. I'm sure that this is similar.

54:01.120 --> 54:07.520
Basically the lawsuit that was filed in 2019 still underway under arbitration in Washington,

54:07.520 --> 54:16.160
but the court denied Nintendo's dismissal. So, I mean, it's still going along. And, you know,

54:16.160 --> 54:21.600
by all means, you know, I would definitely take part of that because, you know,

54:22.800 --> 54:28.400
it's obviously a thing. I had to buy stuff to fix it. It's ridiculous. I understand that they

54:28.400 --> 54:33.280
were offering to fix them, but Microsoft did the same thing. And I don't know.

54:33.840 --> 54:38.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says legally, they can't comment. They cannot comment on pending

54:38.000 --> 54:42.560
litigation. And yeah, I get that. But it does seem like with all of the lawsuits and all of

54:42.560 --> 54:46.880
like the crazy things we talk about on this show, like it's kind of weird to hear, even though,

54:46.880 --> 54:49.920
yes, I understand that that's in the back of my mind. It's still kind of weird to see that come

54:49.920 --> 54:55.680
actually come full circle where Nintendo actually go so far to comment and say no comment. Now I

54:55.680 --> 55:00.640
understand the, you know, the president was asked a question by a journalist and that's where it

55:00.640 --> 55:04.960
ended up, but it's, you don't always hear anything at all on a lot of these things that are going

55:04.960 --> 55:10.400
around, especially when Nintendo is usually the one that's the litigator. But anyway, I also,

55:10.480 --> 55:16.080
this story is just interesting to me because knock on wood, I feel like one of the only people who's

55:16.080 --> 55:21.920
never experienced that ish this issue. I don't have drifting, drifting joy cons. Again, knock

55:21.920 --> 55:27.280
on wood. Cause that's when it's going to break tomorrow. But I also play primarily on the

55:27.280 --> 55:34.160
television with a pro controller, like 95%, if not more of my switch time is on the television

55:34.160 --> 55:39.520
with a pro controller. So I'm not as maybe different. I don't know. Oh yeah. I'm sure

55:39.520 --> 55:42.000
the pro controllers, since they're built completely differently, they're fine.

55:42.880 --> 55:47.040
And then Alan now is a big switch gamer because not only is he playing animal crossing,

55:47.040 --> 55:50.560
but I've caught him this week, you know, caught him, but I've seen him this week for many,

55:50.560 --> 55:54.560
many hours. In fact, he's probably playing it right now, playing through dark souls on the

55:54.560 --> 55:57.760
switch. Cause that came out on the switch and he loved that game on PC. So now he's playing it on

55:57.760 --> 56:04.720
the switch. But he's on a switch light. And so I don't think that necessarily has the same problems

56:04.800 --> 56:11.600
either. Cause he has the, I would certainly hope not being integrated. You can't, I mean,

56:13.680 --> 56:19.040
it would be much harder to fix. I would think, I mean, I'm assuming if, if it is designed the

56:19.040 --> 56:25.200
same way as the joy cons are, as far as having the same hardware in there, it wasn't, it's not

56:25.200 --> 56:30.240
too hard to fix. I mean, you, you can follow the instructions online. It's what I did. I just

56:30.240 --> 56:34.640
bought the stuff for my fix. And I think each one of the replacement analog six was like

56:35.280 --> 56:43.440
10 bucks maybe. But it's still, it's a hassle to have to do that. It should just not be breaking

56:43.440 --> 56:47.760
in the first place. I mean, the same could be said with like, like the dual shock controllers and,

56:47.760 --> 56:52.560
and the rubber on those, you know, I, I have, it's not dual shock by having an Xbox 360

56:53.360 --> 56:58.240
third-party controller where the rubber on the analog six cracked and is falling off.

56:58.240 --> 57:03.040
And so I had, thankfully I have another defective one, the same model. I just took

57:03.040 --> 57:08.160
it apart to pull the good pieces off and threw the rest of the way. So I could replace those,

57:08.160 --> 57:12.160
but it's still annoying that it happens. Bobby Blackwolf says the pro controller's

57:12.160 --> 57:16.000
also got a software update to fix the drift. You know, now that you say that I kind of remember

57:16.000 --> 57:20.240
that, but since that is also seamless, like it's like, Oh, I kind of forgot that ever happened.

57:20.240 --> 57:23.360
Cause you know, your Nintendo, Nintendo just updates every now and then. Right. So you just

57:23.360 --> 57:27.440
kind of let it, I don't understand how a software problem would fix the drift problem. The drift is

57:27.440 --> 57:35.200
from dirt getting into their, where the sensor is, it's causing fluctuations in the, the resistance

57:35.200 --> 57:41.200
on those pads. So it's making it feel near the software, or I guess it would interpret it,

57:41.200 --> 57:45.600
interpolate is I'm pushing the controller in a certain direction because it's,

57:45.600 --> 57:51.760
it's dirt that's getting in there from the pad being rubbed back and forth. But I don't know,

57:51.760 --> 57:56.560
whatever. I mean, if they have a solution that it fixes it and they could do an update that'll fix

57:56.560 --> 58:01.200
it permanently. Great. I would think though, if they had a solution for that, they would have

58:01.200 --> 58:07.360
already done it, but it's still an issue. Good comment here too, on the whole litigation thing

58:07.360 --> 58:12.000
from Questbuster over Twitch TV slash VOG network, who says, just look at Boeing's response over the

58:12.000 --> 58:17.840
737 max. Many people faulted the software and the plane, but Boeing deflected admitting fault

58:17.840 --> 58:22.800
because to admit it would open the flood gate to lawsuits. Yes. You can't really say, Oh yes,

58:22.800 --> 58:26.800
we're aware there's a problem. Oops. You just said there's a problem. Now the flood gates get

58:26.800 --> 58:31.360
open to lawsuits. Although it seems like it's going to be inevitable. They'll probably, there

58:31.360 --> 58:35.680
will probably end up being some sort of settlement anyway, but I don't expect that you're just going

58:35.680 --> 58:40.080
to get cash in pocket. They're probably just going to have to set up some sort of exchange program

58:40.080 --> 58:45.360
repair thing, which they're kind of already doing. Yeah. And they'll have to give away

58:47.120 --> 58:52.640
Zelda for free or something. Who knows? I don't know. It was a hassle already to do that. And so

58:53.200 --> 58:57.840
I had signed up to do it, but like I had done it with the wrong controller at the time because I

58:57.840 --> 59:02.560
was only having like certain ones were drifting and then eventually everything started drifting.

59:02.560 --> 59:06.960
So, and I just, by that point it had been too long and I was like, okay, I don't know how to

59:06.960 --> 59:10.080
change this to say, no, it's not the right Joy-Con, it's the left Joy-Con. And

59:10.640 --> 59:16.000
it was, I didn't trust that, you know, it was going to be done quickly. So I just went ahead and

59:16.000 --> 59:20.480
hit the bullet and instead of replacing them, cause they're like $79, replace a pair. It's just

59:20.640 --> 59:27.760
stupid in the first place. I don't know. We'll see. All right. Well, we'll see what develops

59:28.400 --> 59:31.840
as I'm sure this litigation is going to continue over the next seven years. You know,

59:31.840 --> 59:36.800
by the time they won a hundred matches, they won't give Zelda away for free. They'll get

59:36.800 --> 59:41.120
one, two, switch for free. Haven't we suffered enough? Haven't we suffered enough? Why would

59:41.120 --> 59:48.240
they do that? I'm like the accuracy of that statement. I fucking hate it. Send it back.

59:50.800 --> 59:55.600
Oh man. All right. Well, can't play one, two switch if you have a broken controller.

59:56.400 --> 01:00:04.800
All right. You don't want to. All right. Anyhow. Bobby Blackwold in chat says Xtafur posted on

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:10.000
Twitter and said that the baby game in one, two switch is the most realistic game ever made. Oh

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.640
yeah. It's, it's a, a Braum is one month old today. I don't know if you know that. So Xtafur is

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:21.360
enjoying the dad life. So, all right. Anyway. Let's move on. We have more stories to get to.

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:27.200
And boy, I have a lot of difficult news tonight. There's no easy way to say it. And I don't want

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:31.920
to make light of this either because this news is terrible. And it's another huge loss in the

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:36.320
World of Warcraft community. I have to admit, I did not know this individual. I didn't have

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:41.680
a personal connection to this person as the person I just talked about a minute ago. But I know a lot

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:46.480
of people really respected this person. And I know he was somewhat of a pioneer of sorts,

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.080
I think, when it came to streaming and so forth in the World of Warcraft community.

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:57.680
His online name was Reckful. His real name was Byron Bernstein. I hope I said that right. I'm

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:04.960
very sorry. But unfortunately, the news came this week that he passed away. And this came from his

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:11.120
ex, Blue, and a close friend of his, Andy Milonakis, who, if I'm not mistaking,

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:16.640
had an... That's the same guy that had an MTV show. So anyway, I mean, people are people. And

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.640
I'm not like... This is horrible what they're going through. They lost their friend. I am not

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:25.200
about to make light of this in any way or another. But I think it also goes to show,

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:30.000
number one, people are people. Celebrities are people. People you remember as kids are people.

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:36.400
People that stream on Twitch for your entertainment are people. And everybody

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:42.480
goes through their own ups and their downs and their challenges and all of this. So anyway,

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:51.120
a lot of nice words and things that were said on Twitter. Things like, I wish we could have

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:56.000
helped you. We all do. I'm sorry I couldn't. Thank you for being a part of my life.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.320
Heartbroken, still in shock. I feel a little awkward reading these quotes on air. I'm sorry.

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:04.640
It's a little... Because these are people's personal feelings, even if they did post them

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:09.600
publicly. And it's a lot of... Obviously, a lot of emotions people are going through that they're

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:16.320
trying to deal with and so forth. But you put it all together, and it does seem like, allegedly,

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:24.480
he may have taken his own life. And that's extremely devastating,

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:28.240
especially when paired with some of the other things that have been going around Twitter,

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:35.360
such as, because he has been a streamer for so long, there was a video floating around out there

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:40.240
from several years ago, from 2016 or something. And chat, feel free to correct me, because I'm

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:44.640
going off my memory, and my memory ain't always so great. But I wanna say, in this clip,

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:53.040
a chatter was basically saying, you should kill yourself. And he was reacting to that. And

01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:00.400
he was able to roll it off and so forth. But you could tell for a moment, there's a part of that

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:09.760
that got to him. And it's just tragic that people would go there in the first place. And we really

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:18.400
have to take a good, hard, long look at the way we treat people on social media and on Twitch,

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:24.320
and the way that we treat these people that we watch on Twitch. And I'm pretty sure this

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:30.320
audience that's watching this show, after getting to know all of you, probably don't need to be told

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:35.440
this. I'm saying it anyway, because you never know. I'm gonna have a stranger watching tonight,

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:41.520
somebody might be lurking who's done this before. But when you say something like,

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:47.120
kill yourself to a stranger on the internet, those sorts of words carry a lot of weight.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:55.440
And you can't just go throwing it around like it's LOL. I was just kidding. Because you don't

01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:01.200
know people's lives. You don't know what they're going through. And I think it's up to the rest of

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:07.280
us who do try to conduct ourselves with integrity and try to keep things generally positive and keep

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:11.760
the negatives to criticisms, but constructive ones and so forth online. I think it's up to the rest

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:19.920
of us to call out bullshit behavior when we see it. And stick up for the streamers and so forth

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:28.640
that we respect online. And all of that. Anyhow, it's really tragic because Reckful was only 31

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:33.360
years old. That's incredibly young. Younger than me, younger than Loki, anyone on this show.

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:39.520
He was a streamer and game developer. He used all those hours streaming World of Warcraft

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:45.920
to start to make his own MMO, Everland. He had been open about struggles with depression and

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:51.600
mental health, which is a very brave thing to do. Not everybody is able to do that. And I'm sure he

01:04:51.600 --> 01:05:00.800
was surrounded by love and support and so forth. Unfortunately, like any disease, treatment doesn't

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:07.200
always end up being 100% effective. And God, I hope that really doesn't sound... I'm really

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:14.560
not trying to minimize or make this horrible loss sound any less. But my point is that we have to be

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:21.360
there to help people realize that people go through this and not mock people for this or

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:27.760
challenge people with this. Like, are you sure you have this? Well, depression is just a myth to sell

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:33.760
medication. We have to really watch our language in challenging people that are very open with

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:39.520
these types of struggles and so forth. Because again, you're not in somebody else's shoes. You

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:47.280
don't know what they're going through. And most of all, stop bullying people online. On Twitch,

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:52.640
on Twitter, on Facebook. Because when you tell somebody KYS, that's what you're doing is you're

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:58.640
bullying. And that behavior sucks and needs to stop. Sorry, I've been looking away from chat for

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:04.480
a little bit. So I haven't seen you guys commenting on this. But as Joe and Hunter Matt says,

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:08.480
Reckful would talk about battles with depression on a stream all the time in an effort to help

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:12.880
others battling it as well. Sadly, he lost his own battle. And I think that's why this is this news

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:17.360
may be affecting a lot of people. And why we're seeing a lot of people really pour out their

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:23.200
feelings on Twitter is I would bet there are many people, not only that we're just fans that enjoyed

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:26.960
his streams enjoyed his content, but there's also many people out there that could probably relate.

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:34.320
And it's it's hard to get, you know, I just went through an emotional bit a minute ago,

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:38.400
because somebody that I felt I could call a friend went through something terrible this week.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:43.040
And I bet there were many people that felt they could call Reckful a friend as well.

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:50.880
Rican Elite in chat says, Hey, it's been a crazy week for real in the internet. It has been a

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:57.840
crazy year. And it's only July. It's been a crazy decade. And it's only 2020. Like I hear you it's

01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:05.360
it's who who really continues as we need to listen to people out there because they might seem all

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:10.080
good online and happy but deep down inside they are hurting. Tiger Claw says basically,

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:14.160
it's best to be nice to them. They may say something stupid, but don't be mean to people

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:20.320
for saying dumb shit. Yeah, educate don't berate as to 100. Matt says I was going to mention

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:26.080
Etika hope I said that right. Anthony Bourdain were all public figures that performed in front

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:31.920
of a camera. A lot of their pain was behind the scenes. Hype Mayhem in chat says I've dealt with

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:37.040
depression for years. There have been times where it's damn near killed me. Thank you for being

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:41.600
brave and saying that and let me be the first of many people in chat to tell you I'm glad you're

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:46.880
still here with us. And I hope you will continue to be here with us every Sunday. And there's many

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:57.440
of us that would be happy to listen if you ever needed it. So anyhow, who? Yeah, as Jonah Matt

01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:01.920
says we're dealing with a very hard time this year for some it's harder. Check in with folks

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:08.560
and do it often. And I think it's something not even I think I know it's something with this whole

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:15.600
pandemic and what it's done to like all of us. That is just really heightening everything right

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:21.840
now. And we're seeing it play out in all of these different ways. You know, and some of them have

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:26.960
been things that have been a long time coming, such as they're addressing racial justice in this

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:33.440
country and inequality and those things. That has been something that has been unfortunately,

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:37.280
well, you know what I mean? Fortunately, but unfortunately, right? A long time coming, right?

01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:42.080
Like we need to have this discussion and we're going to have it now. And something about the

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:49.120
pandemic has really just escalated all of that. And you know, now it's mental health. Last week

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:52.880
on the show we talked about and unfortunately, we're going to talk about again on tonight's

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:58.400
show in a little bit because it hasn't stopped is the game industry having to address some of its

01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:05.040
own problems with people in power. And people need needing to be removed from power as a result.

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:12.400
Like this is just it's a hell of a decade. But I think as many would say, you know, whereas some of

01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:18.320
this is extremely tragic, such as the loss from COVID that is unnecessary, such as the loss of

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:23.680
our friends dealing with mental health issues that are only heightened by this whole situation

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:29.600
that's going on with quarantine. But then there's also that side of it that you know what, finally,

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:35.360
we're having discussion on racial injustice and equality. Finally, some of these abusers and

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:40.480
people in power that need to be taken out of power, we're finally talking about that. So there's a

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:45.760
little bit of there's a little bit of nice and a little bit of not so nice, you know, or I shouldn't

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:50.720
say nice, like, I'm really struggling with the correct words tonight. Please forgive me. I'm

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:57.600
human. A lot of I would say like, like things that will be long term positive, long term positive

01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:05.600
coming out of this. And things that are immediately very negative. So anyhow, who fat ninja DM in chat

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:12.800
says, he hugs for all who need it. Yes, please hand them out. Rick and elite says, yes, depression

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:16.400
is horrible, been going through it for years and thought drinking would solve the problem,

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:20.960
but made it worse finding a good support group and a good community to guide you to the right path

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:26.480
and keep you positive and strong. Always a help. I hope that's you saying you you've found sobriety

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:32.240
and congratulations to you. If that is the case, and stick with it. And there's a lot of people out

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:36.320
there that will help you through it and finding the right group for that is yes, a big part of

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:43.120
that for sure. Okay, who heavy topics tonight. And now we've got one more right low key.

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:49.840
Yeah, we're gonna have a nice light topic about you know, abuse allegations coming out of the

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:54.480
I can't evo I can't even laugh. It's not funny. Like it's just it just no, it's just thought.

01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:04.480
So yes, apparently there's been allegations of sexual misconduct from about their previous CEO,

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:10.880
Joey Mr. Wizard seller. And so these were made not to be convenient. I'm not I'm not

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:16.480
kidding. I want to be clear not to be confused with the Mr. Wizard that was on television in

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:22.800
the 80s. Okay, because when I hear Mr. Wizard, there will be no other Mr. Wizard than Don Herbert,

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:27.280
okay, in my opinion, even if he probably didn't like having to do that show with children,

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:30.880
but it doesn't matter. He taught me a lot about science and I was growing up to a lot of people

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:36.560
on Nickelodeon. I just want to make sure we're all very clear. Not that Mr. Wizard. Okay,

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:44.960
but somebody who who dared to take that name who dared to take and we continue looking.

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:52.880
So apparently this was made after one of the one of the veteran competitors, Mikey crack prawn

01:11:52.880 --> 01:12:00.000
fam, who accused Joey seller of preying on teenage boys at Southern hills golf land,

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.600
which was where they had a lot of these different meetups for some of the fighting

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:08.480
game tournaments in Southern California. I've been to it was a big music game meetup

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:12.880
back in the day too. You've probably been to right Southern hills. I not not to that one.

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:16.720
I've been to it. They did close it. They closed it earlier than a lot of the others.

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:23.520
But I've I've been to Southern hills golf land, which is no longer there. It's condos now,

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:29.280
I think. Don't think I've been to that one. But no, there's there's been other ones. But yeah,

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:34.720
not that particular one. But apparently, he described multiple instances taking place in

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:43.760
the early 2000s, where he used the gifts of arcade tokens to bribe teenage boys to do,

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:50.240
you know, inappropriate things. And yes, we'll just leave that. So during that, of course,

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:58.160
after that, you know, these allegations were made, basically just kind of was a chain of events. So

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:06.800
you had starting off with a bunch of participants dropping out of Evo online. So including Sonic Fox,

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:19.360
SKD, Yohosi, Lord Knight and Seijam were all dropping out of it. And then once you had the

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:24.800
big competitors dropping out, then following Stute, you had the actual companies dropping out.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:30.800
So starting you had them fighting herds pulling everybody wanted to distance themselves from a

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:35.760
pedophile. Can we say we're surprised? No. Yes, exactly. So yeah, every everybody,

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:41.120
all of the big game companies pulled their games out of there because they don't want to,

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:46.480
you know, they're standing in solidarity, they want to be involved with that. And I would have

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:51.520
ran away too. I don't blame a single person or company with with all the games and all the

01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:57.760
competitors gone. They had to cancel Evo online this year. So with that, they're going to be

01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:03.040
donating the equivalent of the proceeds promised to Project Hope. They've also

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:12.960
established a new CEO, Tony Cannon, who is I think he was the previous CEO or co sponsor or

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:17.040
something like that. He's going to be taking the leadership role and then the other guy is of

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:24.000
course not involved with Evo online at all in any capacity. So it's been a crazy week.

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:29.200
Tigerclaw in chat says, I honestly don't understand what drives these people to prey on

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:37.760
underage children, etc, etc. Tigerclaw like, good. You shouldn't understand that. And I think that's

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:44.080
what makes all of this so shocking is that nope, any reasonable person is not going to say, well,

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:50.080
that makes sense. Which is which is interesting, because I have, you know, and when we talk about

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:55.280
the whole like, cancel culture and all this, and how long do we give somebody like this,

01:14:55.280 --> 01:15:03.840
this isn't somebody's opinion. Okay. This is somebody's action, that actions that he's,

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:08.320
you know, and some, and I've seen the very interesting Twitter takes of it's been 20

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:12.240
years type of thing, but it's like, Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:19.120
I know y'all hate my obsession with Drag Race, but there was a queen on it. I think it's in the

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:24.400
preview for next week. I think it was Alexis, sorry if I'm misattributing it, who says a quote,

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:30.800
and that is, what is in the darkness will always come to light, might be paraphrasing a little bit

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:37.280
there. But that's the point is that he's paying for it now because he didn't pay for it 20 years

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:44.640
ago. Look at that. Look at that guy here in our area, the Golden State Killer, maybe not

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:48.960
everybody out there has heard of it. But you know, Loki want to talk about right? That guy who lived

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:54.960
in my neighborhood when I was a child, apparently, who had killed a bunch of people in the 70s. I

01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:59.520
don't know what I'm not all up on the serial killer stuff, like some of my friends. But he'd

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:03.920
killed a bunch of people and so forth. He was just recently arrested. Now, granted, he probably

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:08.000
hasn't killed anybody in like 30 years since the 80s or whatever. But he was recently arrested.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.400
They had to have the trial at Sacramento State because the only place where everybody could

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:18.480
socially distance and all this stuff. And he, you know, is going to jail, pled guilty. And he's 80

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:23.360
now and he'll be behind bars forever. The reason why I bring that up. Well, do we just let him go

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:32.160
because it's been 30 years? No, of course not. No, we don't. Now, they probably, I don't know

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:37.280
what the statute of limitations on some of this stuff is. It doesn't matter for this, for this,

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:46.240
for this doesn't matter. There are none. And, you know, yeah, maybe it can't actually be tried in a

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:49.360
court because I go I get what you're going with that Loki like it probably can't actually be

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:54.480
tried in a court because of statute of limitations. But in in this particular court of, you know,

01:16:54.480 --> 01:17:00.560
people that want to associate and do business and give this person power. Everybody's having a

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:08.080
moment of reckoning saying, whoa, you don't deserve power. And that's that. Yeah.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:18.400
So, oh, one of my one of my serial killer friend experts just joined chat. What a great time to

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:25.520
speak up. So, is that isn't just saying I'm obsessed with this guy. Yes, 70s and 80s,

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:30.320
also known as the East Area Rapist, Original Night Stalker, blah, all these nasty things.

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:34.480
But I mean, surely you also agree with my point I was making just because he's 80 years old.

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:40.000
And it all happened 30 years ago. That doesn't that doesn't suddenly make the issue go away.

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:48.400
And it's it's the same with this individual. And this person is being unceremoniously removed from

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:53.040
the gaming industry. And that's how it should be or wasn't still doing it. Like, I don't think

01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:58.240
it was just like, oh, yeah. And then he stopped because he grew out of it. I mean, like,

01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:04.720
I'm sorry. Yeah, we don't know. Yeah. So, let them investigate.

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:12.480
So, I imagine EVO will come back next year with new people at the helm and so forth. And,

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:20.160
and, you know, COVID won't be hopefully knock on wood an issue next year and things can attain

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:25.840
somewhat a sense of normalcy. But I mean, this is the purge that's happening in the gaming

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:29.680
industry right now. Yeah.

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:35.520
And just like I said a moment ago, something about this year, it's dragging it all out.

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:43.120
So, those of you still hiding in the dark, look out. All right. Anyhow, let's move on,

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:47.120
shall we? Yeah. All right. What do you have for us next, Logie?

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:53.760
So, let's talk a little bit about greed and the game industry.

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:59.360
I'm so sorry, Logie. I just, I have to reiterate this point in chat because I think it's so good.

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:04.160
And a nice little like uplifting, hopeful thing to end on. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:12.720
teach your kids not to be a creep. And yes, that part. It is, you know, maybe our generation

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:20.080
is really screwed up. But the best thing we could do is teach the next generation

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:27.360
how to not make the same mistakes. And I think that's a nice like, what can I do to help?

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:35.200
Help the next generation not have to deal with it. Anyway. Okay. Sorry. I just thought that was

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:42.480
a very good note to end it on. Logie, continue. So, it's been found out that apparently

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:50.960
the next NBA 2K game, NBA 2K21 on next gen consoles is going to be more expensive

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:57.840
than your typical game. So, they're going to be charging $70 for the brand new game coming up.

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:07.360
They're basically trying to, a PR spokesman for Take-Two said that, we believe our suggested

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:13.920
retail price for NBA 2K21 on next generation platforms fairly represents the value of what's

01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:18.960
being offered. Power speed technology, and that's only possible on our new hardware.

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:31.520
So, right now, the suggested retail price is $69. I think it's more testing the waters to see if

01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:39.680
they can get that. And I know that I've seen a lot of folks compare this to, well, hey, when I

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:47.680
was buying like Super Nintendo games and stuff like that, they were like $79, $89, $90 or older

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:51.440
games like on cartridges were more expensive. Right. Because they were on cartridges and you

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:54.960
were paying for all the chips inside of them. That's why Neo Geo games are so fucking expensive

01:20:54.960 --> 01:21:00.320
because those games are gigantic. You're paying for all those chips. That may be true in a sense,

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:06.160
but let's just not be confused here. The games you're buying nowadays, you're not paying $60

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:12.880
for them. Sure. $60 may be the price to purchase the disc or purchase the initial download,

01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:17.680
but then there's the season passes. There's all the microtransactions in there. There's all the

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:24.400
DLC that they're adding in there. And I get it that a lot of it is additional content,

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:28.800
but there's also a lot of content that is normally included in these games. And you can't tell me

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:33.760
that they haven't, they're not planning to put this stuff out. A lot of these games that you'll

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:38.960
have features that were in a previous version of the game, and then they're separating it and

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:49.600
selling it to you piecemeal in the later versions that come out. And NBA 2K, the game that last year

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:57.360
was just blatantly, they have like gambling loot boxes in these things. You can't tell me that

01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:00.560
they're not going to be making, and then they've already said they make billions of dollars on

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:07.600
these loot boxes. Why is it that they need an additional $10 to put this game out? They don't

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:12.720
need it. They make tons of money on it. And I get it additional development costs because of higher

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:18.240
fidelity graphics and sound and whatever. They're still making tons of money off of those

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:23.840
microtransactions and they don't need the additional money, but it's an excuse to try to

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:28.800
raise those prices so that they can get more money because why not get more money if you can?

01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:37.760
So I think we're going to see some folks, some companies try to do this. And I think if there's

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:42.480
not a huge backlash to it, you're going to see a lot of other companies start to follow suit

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:46.400
because that's what they did with the Xbox 360 and that generation. And they're like,

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:51.280
well, you know, these games, they have better graphics. And so it's going to take a lot more

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:57.840
manpower to put these games out. And that's why we need to charge more money. It's an excuse.

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:04.800
I have some similarities to what you're saying, Loki, but I find that I'm comfortable with the

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:12.800
idea of a $70 price tag for the AAA game, for the high end, you know, premier showcase games.

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:19.600
I think things have become so warped since the cartridge era because in the cartridge era,

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:26.000
a $999 game was practically unheard of unless it was like, you know, on sale a thousand times over

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:31.680
or some type of like corporate trash or something like a $10 game. What sneak king was like a $10

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:36.160
game on the Xbox 360. But those games, you know, those games were like few and far between, right?

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:43.520
My point is, is that number one, games really aren't all one price anymore. Games are on this

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:49.200
sliding scale. And what a company really has to figure out is what is my game worth, right?

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:53.040
Because like, for example, I mentioned Allen's playing Dark Souls again on the Switch. And the

01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:57.040
first thing I said is I said, so you paid 60 bucks to play Dark Souls again? He's like, no,

01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:00.720
it's only like 30 or 40. And I was like, oh, okay. That makes sense.

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:05.760
Like, I get it. Like, I guarantee you that they, the excuse may be like, they're going to have all

01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:11.120
sorts of excuses that they use. It's going to be that, oh, we need more money for server costs.

01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:15.040
We need more money for development and stuff like that. But I guarantee you when you look at the

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:20.480
actual employees that they're hiring and who they're keeping and how much they're paying them,

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:25.040
that is not going up at all. If anything, it's the money is going to the CEO.

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:29.600
To some extent, I would permiss the additional develop costs when it comes to, you know,

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:34.000
making 4k graphics and doing everything that comes into a AAA experience and so forth.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.440
I'm not dismissing your points, Loki, because I do think they're valid. And especially when you

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:42.800
talk about like the loot boxes on top of that and everything else, I think that is really up to us

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:47.360
what we have to evaluate as buyers and companies do need to be upfront with this.

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:52.080
The ESRB needs to require them to be upfront with this, which good news they do now,

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:54.560
because we have that whole, you know, what did they end up calling it?

01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:57.520
Well, they'd have ways to get around it though. They have ways. I mean, look at,

01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:01.600
look at perfect example, not actually, I'm sorry, not take two that did it this time,

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:07.920
but it was Activision. So Activision, they printed their copies of Crash Bandicoot,

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:12.560
the remake that they did, and they did not have loot boxes on there. So on the packaging,

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:17.440
it doesn't have to say that there's loot boxes. They added it, they patched it in later on,

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:22.000
it updated on the ESRB website, but I don't think they have the reprint in any of their packaging

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.400
that said that there's no loot boxes in there. So it, they have ways to get around it. They

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:31.840
purposefully patches stuff in later, so it doesn't get caught in the early reviews that go out.

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:33.760
So because people try to stay away from that stuff.

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:40.960
We as gamers are kind of getting smarter to those types of tactics too, and kind of have our ways

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:45.520
to deal with that. And I kind of think that's all going to like work out in the end. My point is

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:50.320
like, like, I feel like a Final Fantasy 16 or something, if they charge me 70 bucks for it,

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:56.240
I'm probably going to pay it. And, you know, because, and we've been saying, and I've said

01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:00.640
on the show before, you know what, I would rather instead of you having all these loot boxes,

01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:05.520
and all these other ways to nickel and dime people, just, just charge 70 bucks for the game,

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:09.520
and give me the game you, you know, you want to make. And I'm willing to stand by that earlier

01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:12.720
comment and pay 70 bucks for the game, if it's a well-rounded game.

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:17.200
So here's, here's another thing, and this didn't make our show roll, but, uh, I did want to bring

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:25.200
it up. So earlier this week, the House of Lords actually ruled in the UK that loot boxes are

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:30.960
gambling, and should be regulated as such. So in the UK, that's how they're, they're seeing these

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:34.960
now. And they're basically seeing that because of the way that they're being monetized, and the way

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:42.160
that they're being marketed, and it, it's basically gambling, and they have to be regulated

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:46.960
as such. So I think that maybe they can see the writing on the wall, and that the, their gravy

01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:52.160
train of loot boxes is kind of going away. And so maybe this is why they think that they need to

01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:54.800
raise the price of the games, because they're not going to be able to do that. In which case,

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:59.520
I'm fine with that, as long as I don't have to have my game like rebalanced, because they're

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:03.680
trying to sell me a bunch of garbage I don't want to necessarily buy. And there are lots of games

01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:09.280
that they build and rebalance based on that, that make it more grindier to, you know, stretch out

01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:14.640
the experience. There was that Lord of the Rings games that they had not too long ago, that they

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:20.080
completely had to rebalance the whole game after they patched those out, because it was just such

01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:25.120
a grind fest. I want to say even maybe some of the Forza games and stuff had a little bit grindy,

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:31.760
grinder aspects to them, because they were selling their in-game currency for that as well. But

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:35.760
there's a lot of games that they modeled based on that, to make them more grindier so that you

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:41.200
buy these loot boxes. And it's a big business. PodCulture's brought up a good point in chat,

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:46.240
and this thought crossed my mind too. PodCulture says that twitch.tv slash vog network,

01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:53.200
make physical 70 and keep digital 60. You know, that thought's crossed my mind too, is,

01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:59.360
you know, I feel like the game industry, for many people, the industry would love nothing more than

01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:04.880
to lose the physical thing completely and go completely digital. And there are many games that

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:09.040
are completely digital. I mean, that's pretty much how the indie stuff thrives, unless you're

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:14.160
lucky enough to get one of those limited run game things. But not every game gets that, like almost

01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:19.040
everything indie is digital and it's working out fine. And I almost feel like the industry would

01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:24.480
really prefer things to go that way. You kind of saw that with some of the Xbox One stuff that

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:29.600
they had to backtrack, right? So, yeah, but do we know how much of the, how much, because I don't

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:34.880
know the numbers off the top of my head of what's digital versus what is being sold physical out

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:38.800
there. Granted, I know that they would like to see it go more digital because that's more money in

01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:44.640
their pocket, but I think retailers like GameStop, a lot of these big box stores, Walmart, you know,

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:50.400
retailers online, I don't think that they have any interest in that going to an all digital format.

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:55.280
Considering that they don't, but the writing's been on the wall for them for a long time and

01:28:55.280 --> 01:29:02.160
they all know it's coming. They all look at big players. They, they drive, they drive what these,

01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:08.000
these industries do because they have such pull with that. That's why that they can do the things

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:14.800
that they do. Um, I, I just have a thing cause who's selling these systems for them. They have

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:20.080
to rely on these retailers to make money. And if they're going to, you know, screw them out of like

01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:25.440
sales because they're charging more retail. I mean, that's just a suggested retail price.

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:29.520
They don't have to necessarily sell it for that price. They can always sell it lower, but

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:35.760
I don't see them doing that. I see them, they'd have to be parody across all, all formats, you

01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:43.280
know, just because it would be confusing for one. And for the second one is that they don't want to

01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:46.880
burn those bridges with these partners because they still need the function of selling. They

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:50.560
can't sell them direct right now. I mean, they could, they could try selling these systems direct,

01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:57.440
but I, they don't, they need them. Unfortunately. I can actually see that. And I, I get that. I

01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:02.000
think this is already happening though, and will continue to happen is that the game comes out,

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.600
everything is in parody, dah, dah, dah, just like you said, but then six weeks later,

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:14.480
here comes the first sale and the digital version is marked off 20%. So with a $70 price point,

01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:19.760
let's say that they do raise at the same price dollars and not everybody's on board with jumping

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:25.840
into that price. I think that the scrutiny on those gains is going to be much higher because

01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:34.000
if you have everything at $60 and NBA two K 21 comes out at $70 and NBA two K 21 ends up being

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:40.720
like WWE two K 20, where it's just a piece of garbage. That's all like rushed and buggy as hell

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:47.200
that is going to come down really hard on them. So I, I caution them doing something like that.

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:51.200
They're just going to do whatever they're going to do.

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:53.920
All right. Well, for time's sake, I'm going to move on to the next story,

01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:58.240
but, um, I do think this is a conversation that's going to definitely come up again.

01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:01.520
If, you know, again, we're, we're going off a little bit of speculation here. I mean,

01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:04.880
there, there does seem to be some proof in the pudding and so forth, but you know,

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:09.120
if we have to continue this games, face that reality, the games, the next generation are

01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:13.120
going to be 70 bucks for the high-end stuff. We'll continue that conversation later on.

01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:16.080
Just everybody kind of has to start thinking that this is a possibility.

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:20.640
One last thought real quick. And I just want to put out there. So another thing with a $70

01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:24.880
price point games is that you're also not just competing against other games out there,

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:29.600
but you're competing against services like games pass, where I'm going to be getting all of like

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:34.480
the AAA games that are coming out from Microsoft and all these other games studios for like 10

01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:39.040
bucks a month. So, and truthfully low key, I think that's where it's all headed.

01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:43.840
Like Nintendo will get away without doing it because they can always be last to the party

01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:49.680
and somehow still be fine. But I, I kind of feel like game pass, like that's,

01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:53.760
that's where the movie industry has ended up. Everybody's got their own streaming service and

01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:56.960
monthly service. That's where the games industry is going to end up too. Just give it a little

01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:04.800
more time. Yeah. All right. Anyhow, moving on and talking about a new offering from, from one of

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:10.240
these companies that has their own service, although this is outside of that. Ubisoft

01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:15.840
is recently put out their own battle royale game, or at least it's in testing. You can kind of see

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:20.400
it on Twitch right now, some streams for hyperscape. It is a battle royale, but it's a

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:25.120
little more futuristic and first person take on the genre. I was watching a streamer play it

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:29.680
earlier because right now, like if you watch a streamer play it, you have the potential to get

01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:34.560
the drop. So you can play the beta as well. I only watched for a little bit. But I was just

01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:38.080
kind of curious what the game was, but it's definitely got like that morphe. It kind of

01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:43.440
almost like. Looks like watchdogs in a way, not, not totally, but like has that futuristic kind

01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:48.640
of look to it, but they've got things like low gravity and people are like jumping super high

01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:52.400
and like, you know, kind of, maybe it's almost a little bit like crackdown in that regard. Might

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:57.120
be up your alley, Logie. But is it, it was interesting, you know, kind of a different

01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:02.800
type of battle royale. You can play solo or in teams of three. I think the guy I was watching

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:07.040
was playing in teams of three and there can be up to a hundred players in each match. You can

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:11.680
revive teammates by if you're taking out another player, a respawn beacon appears. This is already

01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:19.040
baked into the game already. So yeah, also what's interesting about this. It also kind of integrates

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:27.360
with Twitch. So you can actually vote, your Twitch fans can kind of like vote on what twist

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:33.760
would be on the upcoming map and so forth. There is a crown cast extension available on Twitch and

01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:40.160
you get to impact the game in different ways by helping to vote for the next event, granting

01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:45.520
infinite ammo, revealing player locations. So that's kind of interesting. The technical test is

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:50.160
running through July 7th. So by the time a lot of you hear this on the podcast, it may already be

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:54.160
over, but I believe the full launch of the game, I thought I heard on the stream today, they were

01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:59.200
saying the 12th, although that's not in the article I'm looking at now. But the full game

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:05.200
will come out a little bit later. So kind of neat. Another, another battle royale contender,

01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:11.760
but this one is doing that interesting thing of doing the Twitch giveaways to kind of build the

01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:16.480
hype for it. And it is Ubisoft, which is a pretty big player out there and so on and so on. So it'll

01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:22.080
be interesting to see what develops there. So, all right, let's move on. Loki.

01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:34.240
All right. And so we've got some more news about Ubisoft, unfortunately. So they're going to be

01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:43.360
shaking up their editorial group, which right now is all white males. And now, of course,

01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:49.360
they, you know, being the focus on all of these different companies is diversity and inclusiveness

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:56.560
that they're going to be changing that, of course, to make it more inclusive. So it's a situation

01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:01.840
that some of you have experienced or witnessed are absolutely not acceptable. No one should feel

01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:07.040
harassed or disrespected at work. And the types of inappropriate behavior we have recently learned

01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:17.600
about cannot and will not be tolerated. And this is coming from the CEO Eze Gamont. They sent an

01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:24.880
email to all of his employees in specifically says, I've decided to revise the composition

01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:30.560
of the editorial department transforming our human resources process and improving the accountability

01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:38.080
of all managers on these subjects. So it's interesting that they're doing this to kind of

01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:45.680
combat some of the harassment in the workplace. I don't remember necessarily the allegations here,

01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:52.160
but I do remember Ubisoft being brought up. I was gonna say, I think somebody at Ubisoft has

01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:56.880
been implicated in a lot of this and this might be Ubisoft's long-term response to making sure

01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:04.480
it doesn't happen again. Yeah, so. I mean, if we're gonna say, and we talked about this a couple

01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:09.920
weeks ago on the show when we were discussing a lot of these issues. If we're gonna say that

01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:16.000
everybody games, and that's something we, I think we all agree games are for everybody. Everybody

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:23.760
is welcome to play video games. You have to have game makers. And I don't necessarily literally

01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:29.440
mean that, well, I do actually literally mean them and my long-term goal, the people that are

01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:34.720
on the board of directors and so forth, the people that are the financial side of that needs to also

01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:42.160
reflect. Everybody is welcome to play video games and not just one type of stereotype that has been

01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:45.840
that for years and years. Can we just run a business without harassing their employees?

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:53.040
That would be great, but it might take this position and maybe we have to shake up and

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:58.960
challenge the positions of power so that there isn't a structure set up in place that can

01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:05.840
incubate that anymore, if that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm not saying this of Ubisoft,

01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:12.800
but in a lot of places and culture and so forth, the boys club, right? We've got to break that

01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:20.400
shit up. And the way you break up the boys club is you bring in some women and so on and et cetera,

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:26.480
and diversify things a little bit. So I think this will be a great long-term thing for Ubisoft.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.760
Yeah, hopefully. Hopefully it stops them from harassing people.

01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:41.840
It's also nice to see that there's a little more thought and action beyond so-and-so fucked up,

01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:47.600
can him. There's a little more. Well, there was people left, let go. So there was a guy

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:53.440
but there's more. Yeah. There's more than that. There's how are we going to make sure it doesn't

01:37:53.440 --> 01:38:00.720
happen again? And I think that's the happy news here is that Ubisoft is taking steps to

01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:08.880
how can we prevent this from happening again? Yeah. All right. Moving on. Let's get to

01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:11.840
our next story, which is sure to be buggy, right, Logie?

01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:20.240
Yes. So I've been trying to think about how they could possibly release a buggy TV show,

01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:24.560
but I'm sure if there's someone that's going to figure it out, it's going to be Bethesda.

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:31.520
And Bethesda has announced that they're going to be doing a Fallout TV show. So they are,

01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:41.280
it's being produced by the creators behind Westworld. And they didn't really,

01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:44.080
it's supposed to be like, I guess it looks like it's an Amazon original.

01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:50.240
No word on necessarily what it's going to be. I mean, it's going to be about Fallout,

01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:55.680
but like, I don't know what the story is going to be about. It's being created by Lisa Joy and

01:38:55.680 --> 01:39:03.040
Jonathan Nolan. And of course, those are the folks that were behind Westworld. And that's all we

01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:10.720
know right now. No release dates been given, but they did like a little teaser that kind of teased

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:18.800
this whole thing coming out. I hope it's better than their last game that they put out. I mean,

01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:25.760
it's completely different. It's completely different creative minds to make a TV show

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:32.800
and that can great. So, I mean, I have hopes that it'll be all right. And the Fallout universe is

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:37.600
definitely pretty vast. And there's a lot of like stories that you could come up with. So I could

01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:42.240
see where it could be pretty cool. And I hope it is. Video games have kind of been winning in

01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:46.320
the TV show department too, in the past year or so between like the success of The Witcher,

01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:49.840
although obviously The Witcher was books too. But then the Castlevania anime.

01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:55.520
That's right. They're doing, I thought they're doing a Last of Us show that HBO is doing that,

01:39:55.520 --> 01:40:00.000
I think. I think that's the thing too. Someone picking up Silent Hill or something,

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.560
or maybe I'm thinking. I think there's rumors about a Silent Hill movie,

01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:08.880
but there's also rumors about a Silent Hill game. And anytime you have a beloved franchise,

01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:12.640
like Silent Hill, there's rumors that are following, but I don't think we have anything

01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:20.000
official in that universe yet. Fingers crossed. They're not quite Five Nights at Freddy's movie,

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:30.720
but it's a Five Nights at Freddy's inspired movie starring Nicolas Cage. I'm sold. So,

01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:37.920
tell me. And it also kind of feels like nobody's making movies now. So it's interesting that this

01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:42.000
show gets announced, but it's like, well, they're not going to really be able to film it anytime

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:46.560
soon, but there's also a lot that goes into a TV show before it gets filmed. They're going to have

01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:52.080
to cast it. They're going to have to write it. They're going to have to scout the locations and

01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:56.400
so forth. So there is a lot of steps that are going to be taken before they get to actually

01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:03.600
shooting it anyway. Just hopefully, COVID's got all of Hollywood frozen right now. If it can't

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:09.040
be done over Zoom, they're not doing it. Well, that's fine. After 2020, there'll be a literal

01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:13.920
wasteland, so they just won't have to... It's going to be similar to the writer's strike. Once

01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:19.280
COVID's over, you can expect things like Big Brother on CBS is going to fill up a lot of time

01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:23.680
in the immediate... Reality TV is going to boom again because those shows are quick and easy to

01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:29.360
make. And you'll probably see some imported shows for... Because it's all the same things that

01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:34.880
happened during the writer's strike. But we'll see. Again, we don't want COVID to keep on going

01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:41.280
and so forth. And who knows how long it's going to be at this point, but it just feels like the

01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:44.960
film industry is not going to get back to work before... Even though, I guess technically the

01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:51.040
film industry opened, but I don't think anyone is actually doing anything because, oh yes,

01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:55.760
the unions don't approve it. That's what's happening because COVID's back on the rise

01:41:55.760 --> 01:42:01.360
and LA is one of the huge places for that. And even other places that they would consider

01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:09.840
shooting, it's on the rise everywhere. And then other places don't want them. They can't film

01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:17.920
Survivor in Fiji right now because Fiji doesn't want them. So it's going to take some time before

01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:22.720
this all sorts itself out and hopefully, knock on wood, we have a vaccine or effective treatment.

01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:27.040
And then we can talk about when those things are going to film again, which would include

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:32.480
this show. But my long way of getting to this point, don't expect to see a single frame of

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:37.360
this show until like 2022, right? Yeah, it'll be a while.

01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:42.480
Interesting. It'll go by super fast though, just like this year.

01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:47.840
Bobby Blackwell says the new Jurassic World movie is back on set in the UK.

01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:53.280
Really? I didn't realize they were shooting again, but I guess the UK has loosened a lot

01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:56.560
of restrictions as well. And I imagine if people quarantined for a little bit or whatever,

01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:02.880
they're probably able to do it. And then Bobby says you'll start seeing shows like The Floor

01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:10.480
is Lava. Exactly. I did watch that.

01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:14.560
Did you? I haven't watched it. I watched the first episode of that,

01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:19.120
or like part of the first episode of that because it wasn't very good. It's just

01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:27.760
it's frustrating the drama that they try to instill in that show. And also it's like,

01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:33.840
I don't know, like it'd be better with kids doing it because, you know, it's totally like

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:42.880
something like The Legend of the Secret Temple or whatever. I don't know. It's silly. It's a

01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:49.440
silly show. Orange Right in Chat says more game shows. Hey, if that means one of the first

01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:54.400
things back on air is going to be that new supermarket sweep, I'm down. Bring on game

01:43:54.400 --> 01:44:02.800
shows. Hell yeah. Yeah. Don't threaten me with a good time. So, yeah. All right. Anyhow,

01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:09.040
bring back one versus 100. On Xbox. Absolutely. All right. Yeah. Let's move on. Speaking of

01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:14.320
things that we watch, let's talk about Nintendo and some of the things Nintendo has us watch.

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:18.800
So Nintendo is talking about the Nintendo Directs. There was recently, of course,

01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:25.360
like a mini direct, but we never got anything that would be like an E3, Mondo, supersize,

01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:31.920
direct type of thing. So what in the heck is going on? Well, recently, Shintaro Furukawa was

01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:37.760
speaking to investors and was talking about that direct still feel like an incredibly effective

01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:43.680
way to present information. But in a somewhat vague statement, Shintaro Furukawa went on to

01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:49.520
say, inversely, times change, and so does the most effective way to promote products.

01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:54.560
So there is a chance that a new, better way to present this information comes about.

01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:59.520
So we always like to examine all of the possible ways to communicate this information to customers.

01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:06.880
So maybe they would do something that's not just a direct? Would we see more bite-sized type of

01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:12.240
announcements like what happened with the Mario? And we see more types of social media or the

01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:17.440
Paper Mario game that was recently revealed. And will we see more types of those social media

01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:25.760
reveals? I don't know. That's not like, that's not unique. That's I released a trailer. I mean, like

01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:30.640
you're not cutting edge Nintendo. You're not trying anything that everybody else hasn't

01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:37.600
already done. Ooh, you released a trailer on Twitter. Ooh, ooh, bravo for thinking inside

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:41.840
the box. Like, I don't understand how that's any different than what everybody else is doing. And

01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:46.640
honestly, the directs were kind of a unique thing. Now everybody's kind of copied that and stuff.

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:52.240
I can't really think what else they could possibly do that would be kind of different. But like,

01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:55.120
if that's the move that they're going to do, it's like, we're just going to do what everybody else

01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:58.960
is doing. I mean, I guess it's worked for everybody else. They're doing what you're doing, so.

01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:04.720
I feel like Nintendo can really do whatever the fuck with A1. Like every podcaster,

01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:09.360
every Twitch streamer out there that has ever said anything critical about Nintendo,

01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:14.800
like, it's just Nintendo just goes, huh, and does their own thing. And it almost always,

01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:21.040
exception, we you, it almost always, it doesn't matter what any of these criticisms are.

01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:24.720
It doesn't matter that Nintendo's online is shitty. You know why? Because they have Animal

01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:30.800
Crossing. And it doesn't matter that you have to talk to the dodos, like through 5000 lines of

01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:36.240
text just to visit somebody else's island. Because it's Nintendo and it's Animal Crossing. Who cares?

01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:43.280
Like, Nintendo just gets away with it every time. Unless it's the Wii U.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Yeah, I don't know. I just,

01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:57.680
I really don't care what, I just want more news. Like, I would like to know what they're working

01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:01.520
on. And right now, like, all I know is like, oh, hey, there's a game that's coming out soon.

01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:06.480
Well, there's a Metroid Prime 4 that they restarted. So, lord knows where that is right now.

01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:13.520
Time to port some of those old Wii U game, or hell, Wii games.

01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:17.120
I was gonna say, I think they've almost ported everything from the Wii U over that was worth

01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:23.200
porting. Oh, yeah. Well, the Wii, there's still the Wii. I mean, after all, I mean,

01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:28.560
it's Metroid Prime trilogy, right? I mean, the Switch is pretty much an Nvidia Shield.

01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:36.720
So, why not? All right, let's move on to a simpler time when there was no

01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:44.640
portability in the games like this. It's the classic game of the week. And every week,

01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:50.080
Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you brats should be

01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:54.880
checking this game out this week. It's time to dust this old school game off and give it a go.

01:47:55.600 --> 01:48:00.000
This week, since Dark Sakura is not here, I have taken on the responsibility of choosing

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:04.960
a classic game of the week. And I decided to pick something that is a little bit topical

01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:09.840
because it's a game that came up casually in discussion a couple weeks ago when, again,

01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:16.400
we were talking about these Namco collections that are coming out. And in the second collection,

01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:20.320
there's quite the variety of different Namco games. But then there's also a game in there

01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:26.160
where I'm like, I don't remember Namco ever being involved with this game. But that's because

01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:34.720
Broderbund published it here in the US. Namcot published it on the Famicom. And it's a game called

01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:42.400
Legacy of the Wizard. And that is my classic game choice for tonight. So, Legacy of the Wizard is

01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:51.920
actually a US or localized version of Dragon Slayer IV Dracy family. Now, the Dragon Slayer

01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:57.840
series is pretty big in Japan and gave us a lot of different types of games. Like, obviously,

01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:02.800
there were games that came out on the TurboGrafx, which were probably well known. There was also

01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:09.200
a game called Xanadu that was the second game in the Dragon Slayer series. And there was a spin-off

01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:17.120
to Xanadu that was Fa Xanadu or Fa Shanadu, Fa Xanadu. That game we ended up getting on the NES.

01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:23.680
So, it's interesting how this series kind of came and went and so forth through the different...

01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:33.600
In America, we kind of got one here, one there, but we never really got the entire series. Anyhow,

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:36.400
so this is the one that I picked for tonight, Legacy of the Wizard, which was, again,

01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:42.320
Dragon Slayer IV when it was originally released, not just on the Famicom, but on the MSX and the

01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:47.120
MSX2. But I've picked the version that I remember on the Nintendo Entertainment System where it's

01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:53.360
called Legacy of the Wizard. In this game, it's actually an early example of a Metroidvania game,

01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:59.440
it really is. Now, maybe that's because Metroid was also a game on the NES and one could argue

01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:04.640
Metroid was a Metroidvania game. I would say it also has a lot in common with Goonies 2.

01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:08.400
For some reason, that's a lot of the vibe I get from this game, except you don't really have so

01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:12.080
much the parts where you're doing the indoor puzzles that were really infuriating in the

01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:16.160
old game. You do have indoor areas like inns and shops, but it's a little bit different. But I

01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:19.840
don't know why, but the overworld kind of reminded me of Goonies 2 a little bit and just the fact

01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:24.400
that you had these big sprawling maps that you went through. So anyway, in the game,

01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:29.360
you are trying to destroy an ancient dragon. The dragon's name is Keela and Keela is trapped in a

01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:32.720
painting. And so you'll actually... I don't know how long we'll let this footage that we're playing

01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:36.640
on Twitch go, but after about seven minutes or so, you actually see our character get to

01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:42.800
where Keela's at. It's a big painting in the ground. And to get to the painting or to unleash

01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:48.000
the dragon, you have to find the dragon slayer, which is a magical sword. There are four crowns

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:54.000
protecting the sword. So there are essentially five family members that you play as. There's

01:50:54.000 --> 01:51:00.160
also a grandma and a grandpa who are like the password system, but you also play as dad, mom,

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:06.320
sister, brother, and pet. Little... And it's not like a dog or a cat. It's a little pink

01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:16.080
puff thing that you play as. So you use all five of those characters to essentially explore

01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:20.640
different parts of the underground. So on the Twitch video right now, we're looking at the dad

01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:27.680
character being played here. So the dad I think has like strength basically and is able to use a

01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:33.040
glove in a little bit that he's going to find here that will allow him to move bricks around.

01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:40.800
Okay. And the bricks are, you know, one area of the map has a bunch of bricks. It's a brick puzzle.

01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:47.360
So you need to use him to get through that part. And then later on, the mother has some weaker

01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:53.120
attributes, but she can use some really strong magic stuff. And so she gets a magical item you

01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:58.160
have to use to get to one of the crowns. And then I think the sister does like fireballs

01:51:58.160 --> 01:52:04.240
or something. And the pet is really strong, but doesn't have a big range for their weapons. So

01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:07.280
they all have kind of like their pluses and negatives, right? It's kind of like Mario

01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:12.000
Brothers 2 in that regard, but you have to use certain characters to get past certain parts.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:16.880
And a lot of that is just trial and error to figure out what to do. Or you do what a lot of

01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:23.280
people did and you just read a guide online. In fact, I remember as a kid, one of the old,

01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:28.400
one of the letters I wrote to Nintendo Power Magazine was about this game. And they did

01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:32.720
answer the question in Nintendo Power Magazine. I'm not saying it was my letter because I'm going

01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:37.760
to say there were probably hundreds of kids that got frustrated by this fucking game, but it was

01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:41.440
enough of us writing Nintendo where they did actually answer some of the questions about

01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:46.320
how do I find the crowns or how, how do I make any goddamn progress in this game? I mean,

01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:49.920
I don't think I phrased it that way, but it's essentially what I was asking. How do I do

01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:54.160
literally anything in this game? And they answered that in an episode, excuse me,

01:52:54.160 --> 01:53:01.680
an issue of Nintendo Power at one point. So eventually you get all four crowns by using

01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:07.200
each family member, except the brother type. And the brother is the one that can actually

01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:12.080
wield the sword who goes to slay the dragon. And tada, you slay the dragon. That's why you played

01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:18.080
a game called Dragon Slayer. So there it is. Anyway, this game was first released for the MSX

01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:25.280
2. It came out July 10th, 1987. Sometimes, and the Wiki article I'm looking at on this says that it's

01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:31.440
sometimes misattributed to a quintet production due to a reference in the ending credits,

01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:36.640
but Yuzo Koshiro, who is the composer, that's why the music's so fucking good in this game,

01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:42.240
confirmed that this is a coincidence. And Quinten actually didn't exist until 1989. Anyway,

01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:51.440
it was ported to the Famicom just a week later, July 17th, 1987. And then there was a Famicom,

01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:57.600
I guess the ending credits of the version showed that the Famicom port was developed internally

01:53:57.600 --> 01:54:04.400
by Nihon Falcom, but apparently Compile somehow contributed this as well. It was published in

01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:11.680
Japan by Namco and then, of course, released two years later in 1989 by Broderbund on the NES as,

01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:16.160
of course, Legacy of the Wizard that we're looking at here. There was another version of this game

01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:21.280
years and years later. In 2008, a version of this game came out for mobile phones in Japan.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:28.800
So there it is. There it is, your classic game of the week, Legacy of the Wizard. And my parents

01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:33.680
bought me this game for one Christmas. It was probably Christmas of 89 when it came out because

01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:40.480
my mom knew I liked the Dungeons and Fantasy Slayer type of games. And she said, when I looked

01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:46.880
at the box, it looked like something you'd like. And she was right. I was into it, even though it

01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:52.720
was an annoyingly hard game. And I think I ended up using passwords online or in magazines or

01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:58.240
however we did it back then to just skip my way straight to the final boss and do it that way.

01:54:58.560 --> 01:54:59.840
Did you ever play this game, Loki?

01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:03.200
No, I have never played that game.

01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:08.080
It's a good game. Again, you have to remember, this is on the NES and it's a huge map.

01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:14.800
And again, I know we overuse the term Metroidvania sometimes, but those games were pretty few and

01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:20.480
far between on the NES unless you were literally Metroid or Castlevania II, which was kind of the

01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:27.440
Metroidvania-esque game on the NES. So games like this were really fun to discover. Looking at some

01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:34.240
comments in chat about this game, SSG100Matt says, I Game Genie this game for sure. Shehulk10

01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:40.160
with the Broderbund reference says, Print Shop was a great software package that they made as well.

01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:44.560
That is where most people probably remember Broderbund. I would say the Print Shop was a

01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:50.480
huge one. And then the other huge, huge game that they put out, they had an NES version,

01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:56.320
but it was also on many types of home computer systems was Lode Runner, L-O-D-E Runner. That

01:55:56.320 --> 01:56:03.280
was a big Broderbund game too back in the day. And you know, you know what else Compile had a

01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:08.800
hand in that Broderbund published in the US? You know what other game that was? That's right. The

01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:16.720
Guardian fucking legend. So when I heard this game came out in the Namcock collection, I had a moment

01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:25.440
of, I had that gay gasp. Okay. I had the, could this mean that we could get the Guardian legend

01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:32.000
released in a collection? Well, Namcock actually published this game in Japan. So that's where I

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:37.600
think we're able to see it here, but they, but, but they, they did release the same collection

01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:47.360
in the US. They were able to do that. So I, I don't know, maybe. Some other Broderbund memories

01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:53.120
in chats. Hype Mayhem says, I think Broderbund put out Raid on Bungling Bay too. That is correct.

01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:58.000
They did that as well. And Quest Motion says Broderbund also came out with everybody's favorite

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:02.320
question. Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego? Very good call out. That was also a Broderbund.

01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:07.280
Broderbund definitely no longer in the business of publishing games though. I kind of always

01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:13.920
saw Broderbund more as a like utility company because of things like print shop and I guess

01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:18.160
edutainment like where in the world is Carmen Sandiego, but you know, they kind of got their

01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:22.400
hands in a little bit with the NES stuff, but I don't think any of their games were a huge

01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:27.520
runaway successes on console. I think Lode Runner and Carmen Sandiego, those games are always kind

01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:35.280
of more personal computer-based games. So Broderbund was much more known in that space. So, oh wow,

01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:41.360
I, I'm forgetting all these greats. The original Prince of Persia was Broderbund and Myst. I didn't

01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:46.480
know that. I didn't remember Myst being a Broderbund game. That's a great call out there. So, huh, wow.

01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:54.640
Let's see, looking at, I just wanted to see real quick because I'm looking at, before we get back

01:57:54.640 --> 01:58:02.960
in the news, I want to see, I think Compile just released the Guardian Legends themselves in Japan.

01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:10.240
No, Irem did. Irem released it to Japan, so sadly it wasn't Namco. But Nintendo themselves released

01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:16.080
it in Europe, so anything is possible. Just game industry, I'm asking for one simple thing.

01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:22.080
The Guardian Legend. Bring it back. Let's, let's give that game to the love it deserves. That's all

01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:28.400
I want. All right, anyhow, let's move on. We have more gaming news to get to before we get to your

01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:32.640
questions and so forth in chat a little later in the show and your emails. I actually don't know

01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:37.120
if we have any tonight, but we'll look. Let's get to it. Loki, rapid fire news.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:49.360
Yes, okay. Let's see, so let's talk a little bit about NBA 2K again. So, NBA 2K20 and Rise of the

01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:56.240
Tomb Raider are going to be your free games that you get for PlayStation Plus in the month of July.

01:58:56.800 --> 01:59:03.120
Also, they're going to be giving away a game called Erica as well. It's the bonus game because

01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:12.000
apparently it's PlayStation Plus, their 10th anniversary. Hooray! Okay, I mean, I ain't

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:16.960
one to complain about an additional game getting thrown in. Yeah, so that's cool. And then speaking

01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:21.760
of games that were on PlayStation, Horizon Zero Dawn is going to be coming to the PC on Steam and

01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:28.000
Epic Games Store on August 7th. That'll be pretty cool. I don't know if I'll have to get this again,

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:37.360
but it's gonna be bundled with the Frozen Wild expansion as well. So, pretty cool. I am curious

01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:43.120
to see how this looks on PC, I'm sure. And all the cool mods that they're gonna have.

01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:49.120
Yeah, that's the thing is I'm like, I don't know if I can really justify spending the money again

01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:55.680
on PC when I already have it on PlayStation 4. I'm sure it's gonna look great on PC,

01:59:55.680 --> 02:00:02.480
but you said the magic word there, mods. And I bet Alan will probably, because he loves to mod

02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:06.160
games, if there's some good mods for that that come out, I imagine he's probably going to pick

02:00:06.160 --> 02:00:11.760
that up at some point. So, I'm very curious to see how the modding community wrecks that game,

02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:21.760
but in a good way. Yeah, they've got like improved reflections and they're gonna have dynamic

02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:28.320
foliage and I don't know, it looks pretty cool based on the trailer. It looks like a shiny

02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:34.880
coat of paint on it. Well, speaking of Sony-based things, the PlayStation. Sony PlayStation is the

02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:42.080
latest company to jump on with a boycott of ads on Facebook and Instagram. This according to a report

02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:47.920
by gamesindustry.biz. There's a lot of companies that have stopped advertising on Facebook recently

02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:54.960
and yeah, PlayStation is jumping on that as well. This is also an excuse for me to do that cheap

02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:59.920
plug that I finally pulled the plug. So, y'all know I went on a rant last week on Facebook games,

02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:04.400
right? So, I finally put my money where my mouth is, so to speak. I deactivated my Facebook on

02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:10.000
Thursday, Friday, I don't remember. And so, I'm detoxing from Facebook right now and again,

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:15.920
it's my choice and I'm not saying I'm any better or worse and or anybody has to feel like they need

02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:21.840
to do the same thing. Because to be fair, I am still using messenger and a little bit of

02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:27.840
Instagram because like I can't pull away from messenger yet because it's how I actually get

02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:32.160
some gigs that are completely outside this whole video game thing that I do. So, I kind of

02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:38.240
can't pull myself. But even just pulling myself off of Facebook, those are less ads that can be

02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:43.760
served to me there. So, and I find just out of muscle memory, Loki, do you know how many times

02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:47.680
I just instinctively I'm putting like Facebook.com in my phone or on my desktop

02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:54.000
just like and I'm greeted with the login screen and I have to go, oh yeah, I deleted that or I

02:01:54.000 --> 02:02:02.720
just deactivated that. So, yeah. Anyway, yeah. Bobby says, this means I control the vog network

02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:07.520
fan page exclusively. Yeah, pretty much. Understand. Understand. And Bobby says,

02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:10.960
wish I could do the same. I just unfriended a bunch of toxic people on both sides of the

02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:16.560
spectrum. Yeah. I just, it is out of control on Facebook. I'm not even talking about like

02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:22.000
friends and stuff. Although there's a lot of friends that are just going crazy. But it's

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:27.280
just that it's Facebook culture. I think that's the only way I can put it. It's Facebook culture

02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:32.720
and the things that happen on public pages and stuff too and things that Facebook has no interest

02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:40.000
in trying to control or what. And I'm just like, you know what? I don't want to participate anymore.

02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:45.680
I'm gonna take myself out of this. And so, I have. So, we'll see. Some people are like,

02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:49.360
oh, you're only gonna be able to make it last a couple months. We'll see. Spite is very

02:02:49.360 --> 02:02:55.680
fucking motivating. Let's see. All right. Moving on. Other rapid fire news. Oh, this one's pretty

02:02:55.680 --> 02:03:00.960
cool. So, Dark to See You brought this one to my attention. I think this is pretty neat. We love

02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:07.120
the hiddenpalace.org because that's the website where they find like deleted things in games and

02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:12.880
old prototypes and old things. Well, they just released just in time for the 4th of July a

02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:21.760
mondo report about a Street Fighter 2 Championship Edition prototype from both March and July of 1993

02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:27.440
for the Mega Drive. This was the version that you may have seen in older magazines that were hyping

02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:32.320
Street Fighter Championship with the black bar at the top of the screen. The background didn't cover

02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:35.520
because if you look at most versions of Street Fighter, the background goes all the way top of

02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:42.160
the screen. In this early version, the black bar was at the top there where the health bars are.

02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:46.720
And then that ended up going away in the actual version that they released and it had the

02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:52.480
background that went all the way to the top. So, it's a very large piece and it's really kind of

02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:57.840
gets into that basically for whatever reason, the first version of this was like stopped,

02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:02.640
thrown out, and a new one was started. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that

02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:08.880
there was like some behind the scenes boardroom stuff with counter moves by what Capcom was doing

02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:14.240
with Nintendo and the turbo edition of the game that happened and all this stuff. So, it's a

02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:20.160
fascinating read and I would have to spend an hour to go through all of it with you here on air,

02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:23.840
but I thought it was really neat. So, I want to give that a plug over hiddenpalace.org

02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:29.120
because we like those little hidden gem types of things. It's pretty cool. So, all right, moving

02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:32.960
on. That's it for rapid fire. So, let's do world release dates and talk about the types of video

02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:39.200
games coming to a store near you this week. First in the US, Loki. Not a whole lot. So, we've got

02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:45.360
Catherine Full Body and Nintendo Switch, Subliminal on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:04:46.480 --> 02:04:52.320
Looks like we've got Cross Code coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

02:04:52.880 --> 02:04:58.240
Bloodstained Curse of the Moon 2 coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:05.520
Deadly Premonition 2, A Blessing in Disguise coming out on Nintendo Switch, F1 2020 on

02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:14.400
PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Stadia, NASCAR Heat 5 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:24.160
and last but not least, Sword Art Online, the Alakazation Lycoris on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox

02:05:24.160 --> 02:05:29.120
One. All right, traveling over to Japan and looking at the releases there. Just a couple

02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:34.480
things on the Switch this week. Blair Witch gets its localized multi-language edition released on

02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:41.040
the Switch this week, as well as a Konami baseball game. eBaseball Powerful Pro Yaku 2020 comes out

02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:45.360
this week on the Nintendo Switch. And looking at the PlayStation 4 to see what's out there,

02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:52.000
we have a few more things. Sword Art Online Alakazation Lycoris. I'm probably saying that

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:56.400
wrong, but that game is out this week in Japan from Bandai Namco. Blair Witch also out on

02:05:56.400 --> 02:06:02.960
PlayStation 4. That same eBaseball Powerful Pro is out as well. And those are the big games. Oh,

02:06:02.960 --> 02:06:09.840
there's one more game called Overpass that's also out on PlayStation 4 in Japan this week. And I'm

02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:15.200
assuming it's not talking about like a freeway Overpass. No, but it is a driving game. It looks

02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:22.640
like you're driving Excite Trucks. You're driving the big dune buggies in a lot of dirt and woodland

02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:27.520
type of things. That's Overpass. So cool. All right. How about Europe? Dark Soccer is not here

02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:31.440
tonight. She has the night off. So, Loki, if you wouldn't mind filling in for her with the Europe

02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:38.080
release dates. Sure. So, we've got kind of the same type of stuff coming out over there. So,

02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:42.400
we've got Catherine Full Body on the Nintendo Switch. They're getting the Namco Complete

02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:50.240
Collection over there as well, also on Nintendo Switch. F1 2020-70 edition. That's on PC,

02:06:50.240 --> 02:06:59.040
Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. We have the Story of Seasons, Friends of Mineral Town. And that's on

02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:08.240
Nintendo Switch. Hard West Collector's Edition on Nintendo Switch. Sword Art Online. The Alkaization

02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:16.080
Lycros. Or Lycros, I guess that's how you pronounce it. It's a made-up word. PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:22.960
there. Guacamelee! One-Two Punch Collection on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. Deadly

02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:30.400
Premonition 2, A Blessing in Disguise on Nintendo Switch. And that's it. All right. Well, in this

02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:35.120
part of the show, we would typically open up the mailbag, which you can email us at participate

02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:40.480
at orangelaunchrader.com. And we read emails here on the air, but we didn't really get anything

02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:44.800
for on air this week. So, probably because we got a handful of things last week,

02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:50.480
with last week having been the 18th anniversary show. So, a little more folks probably want to

02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:55.520
participate with that show. But just a reminder, you can send us emails if you, especially one of

02:07:55.520 --> 02:08:00.000
the things I love that we get is sometimes we get like little mini reviews of games that we just

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:03.760
didn't have time to get to on this show and talk about. And so, people will email us like mini

02:08:03.760 --> 02:08:08.240
reviews of games or something like that. And I'm all for more of those types of things. But

02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:12.320
anything that's on your mind you want us to bring up that we didn't discuss, or you want us to

02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:16.160
discuss a little more in detail, or you want to give your perspective on something, participate

02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:20.880
at orangelaunchrader.com is the place to do it. And we'll see if we get anything next week.

02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:23.360
In the meantime, some more news for you guys. Loki.

02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:32.560
Yes. So, apparently hackers are defacing some of the avatars in Roblox with Trump

02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:40.880
paraphernalia and also putting similar messaging in the profiles of these users as well saying,

02:08:40.880 --> 02:08:43.840
ask your parents to vote for Trump this year, MAGA 2020.

02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:51.920
So, this is not profiles. Explain to me a little more because like, I can say anything I want in

02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:57.520
like my online gaming profile, but you're saying they're like hacking stuff into the game, like

02:08:57.520 --> 02:09:02.400
MAGA hats or something or what? Actually on these folks' profiles. So, like, you know how

02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:07.040
in your profile you can type little things and stuff there. So, they're changing what the avatar

02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:11.680
is wearing. So, in Roblox, you have this like Lego looking character that you can dress up

02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:17.840
however you want. And so, they're putting the default avatar as wearing, since they don't really

02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:25.440
have any like Trump related shirts and like hats, they have to use like, for example, a running of

02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:35.760
the Bulls red hat. And it's just a, it looks like a MAGA hat sort of, but not quite. And then there's

02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:41.760
like a bald eagle in front of an American flag is like this shirt. So, that's kind of a stretch

02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:47.920
there, but then like the, you know, little message that they put in all of the different profiles.

02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:53.920
So, like you can put a little message in your profile and that's what they put. It's not like

02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:58.800
they've really done too much. You can go and fix that stuff. And the thought is that it's only

02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:03.200
affected these accounts that have like weak passwords, which is a lot of these are owned by

02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:09.520
like kids and stuff. They probably have really terrible passwords. Oh, okay. I get it. I get,

02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:14.640
because I'm like, this doesn't, like who fucking cares? Some nerds went in and did some weirdo

02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:22.160
profiles, whatever. But I get it. So, they've taken like established accounts and they're

02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:28.720
basically hacking them to become, okay. Okay. I get it now. Yeah. You're right. Kids probably

02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:33.280
have some pretty, I know a lot of adults that have crappy passwords too. So, I'm not surprised,

02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:38.160
you know, kids have pretty easily guessable things. So, teach those kids at a young age,

02:10:38.160 --> 02:10:43.760
how to make a strong password. So, yes, definitely. Acronyms are a good trick that I teach.

02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:48.960
Acronyms are very hard to guess. But you have to, you have to think of like a song lyric or

02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:53.440
something that only makes sense to you. And it's much, like it's a thousand times stronger when

02:10:53.440 --> 02:10:59.760
you can think of a song lyric from this song and this song. Take the acronyms, put them together.

02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:04.320
And then it's much, because if you do all the same song, then somebody that maybe knows your

02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:07.760
password as an acronym of a song can figure it out. But it's going to be very hard if it's

02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:12.480
two random things combined. That's the best type of password. Combine a bunch of random shit together.

02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:19.920
So, all right. Anyhow. All right. Well, let's move on and talk about, hey, this is interesting

02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:26.160
because this came up earlier in the show. And this was about microtransactions for Crash Bandicoot.

02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:30.960
And apparently, they're getting called out already about, are you going to shove this

02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:38.080
shit into Crash Bandicoot 4 as well? Well, Toys for Bob, who is developing the game,

02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:44.320
went to Twitter to say, not happening. We're seeing confusion about MTX microtransactions

02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:50.560
in Crash Bandicoot 4 and want to be crystal clear. There are, all caps, no microtransactions

02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:56.720
in Crash 4. As a bonus, the totally tubular skins are included in all digital versions of the game.

02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:01.280
Now, this doesn't mean they can't change their mind later on.

02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:04.480
But I don't think- After those reviews come out.

02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:10.720
I don't think Toys for Bob did the other, or did they? Did they do the remasters?

02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:12.960
I don't remember. I don't think they did.

02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:15.040
It wouldn't necessarily be the developers.

02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:17.600
That's true. If Activision wants it, Activision.

02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:21.680
Yeah. But maybe because of all that negativity or whatever. I mean,

02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:24.960
it's a pretty bold statement to make. And certainly something like that,

02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:29.760
there are no microtransactions in Crash 4. Like, that statement's going to come back to haunt them

02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:34.160
if that ends up being not true because people are going to, quote, tweet that shit left and right.

02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:36.400
Right? Yeah, I would think so.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:42.800
So, all right. Well, let's move on. Next story, Logie.

02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:49.680
All right. So, this is something we kind of talked a little bit about last week,

02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:56.480
at the end of the show, that there's a brand new mod out there or exploit for the PlayStation 2

02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:04.400
that allows you to run games on burned DVD discs in your PlayStation 2 without a mod chip,

02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:10.720
without any sort of USB exploit or anything. It's just a way to burn your DVDs.

02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:17.200
And so, it's this free DVD boot exploit that basically exploits the console's DVD player

02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:22.240
functionality and triggers a corruption in the video playback and then runs the game through

02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:27.840
that. So, you can use it for homebrew and whatnot. I don't know if they'd necessarily

02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:32.480
have it running like full actual games. Oh, apparently you can. Okay. Apparently,

02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:36.560
I see that there's people writing copies of Shadows of the Colossus on there.

02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:40.640
So, does that mean I could also run like Japanese games on my US PlayStation?

02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:42.960
Because that would be right. You probably could. Yeah.

02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:49.520
Because I bought a Japanese PlayStation 2 back in the day just so I could play Beat Media 2DX

02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:55.920
and the other Konami music games on my Japanese PlayStation 2. I might own like one non-thing.

02:13:55.920 --> 02:14:01.520
Yeah. I would love to try this except for two small problems. Number one,

02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:09.200
my laptop doesn't have a DVD drive or a DVD burner. I have an old laptop that does,

02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:15.040
but I'd have to dig it out. Number two, I don't believe my DVD drive in my PlayStation 2 works

02:14:15.040 --> 02:14:24.240
anymore. So, I'm kind of stuck there. I do have a hard drive for it and I do have

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:32.240
a modded memory card, but I never quite got that stuff to work. And I just recently did that because

02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:39.200
I was attempting to... That was back when I was trying to put like PlayStation 1 step files for

02:14:39.920 --> 02:14:45.440
DDR back on the cabinet, the edits and everything. And I never quite got that to work correctly.

02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:49.920
So, I never bothered to try to see if I can get the backups of the games to work. And I don't

02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:54.480
know if I have like that, if they're still on that hard drive or anything.

02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:58.000
I was going to say, I have a working DVD burner if you need help.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:03.120
And like at this point, like I'm not even sure I would even try to like bother with it because

02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:08.880
I don't think I have cables that would work with my TV as is, you know, an HD or anything.

02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:11.680
And I could just probably emulate that on the PC anyways.

02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:17.280
And as much as our minds are all going to, oh, I can play all the games, you know,

02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:23.120
I couldn't before. And a lot of us, our heads are going, yay, piracy. I think Jason actually

02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:27.600
addressed this in the intro tonight. And I think it's a very good point worth repeating is that

02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:33.280
this is great for preservation of games, you know, because like all our PlayStation 2s are breaking.

02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:39.840
So this might actually be a really good way to make sure that old games that may never come back,

02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:44.000
like, you know, like again, I keep bitching and moaning about the guardian legend,

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:47.600
but which I, I noticed you changed your background on Twitch to be like,

02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:52.240
is that like a remake or something? It's a remake of it's somebody like,

02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:57.840
I was like curious, like, has anyone tried the remake? Oh yeah. It was a big, this is it that

02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:01.120
you're looking at. There was a big attempt a couple of years ago. I don't think they ever

02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:06.800
download it, but I couldn't, I couldn't, can't get it to run, but I was trying to, to run it,

02:16:06.800 --> 02:16:11.760
but yeah. But like, I'm basically sitting here going, please let me pay you money again.

02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:16.480
So I can play this game on a modern console without having to dig up my NES and blow on

02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:20.160
the cartridge and pray that the goddamn thing still works. Cause you know, I got guardian

02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:25.120
legend on cartridge. I have like two cartridges, guardian legend anyway, all that aside, um,

02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:32.000
with all this, uh, like, like, uh, making the PlayStation two can work again. And to get,

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:37.440
to get these all games, this is great for game preservation is that, you know, these, even if,

02:16:37.440 --> 02:16:43.920
if a game that's really hard to get like rule of Rose, people will still be able to, cause that

02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:48.320
game, that game's a little wacky or, or earlier, even not even necessarily a PlayStation two game,

02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:54.240
but I watched a streamer play, uh, the unreleased version of saints row on PSP.

02:16:54.560 --> 02:16:59.840
And that was hot guards because it was nowhere near complete. Um, do you, do you want to hear

02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:06.960
my most depressing story? Um, and I bet, I think I've told this on OLR before, but I'm gonna tell

02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:11.440
it again because I think we have some new people watching tonight. Hello. This is my most depressing

02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:17.120
story about the PlayStation two and the video game rule of Rose. So, you know, that that game goes

02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:22.720
for like hundreds of dollars because there wasn't a lot of copies of that game made. Right. So

02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:26.640
here's the thing. Not only did I have a copy of rule of Rose,

02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:35.040
I had a press copy of rule of Rose because I got that for you. I know. And do you think I know

02:17:35.040 --> 02:17:41.680
where that fucking thing is now? Loki? Nope. Nope. I'm almost positive. I just got rid of it in a

02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:46.880
past move. I was like, I don't need this anymore. I have too much shit in this house. I don't need

02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:51.280
this anymore. Was it, was it through your connections or I thought it was a podcast thing.

02:17:51.280 --> 02:17:56.400
I thought we got it. Cause no, no, no, you're right. It was, it was a podcast. It was a podcast

02:17:56.400 --> 02:18:01.680
thing. We, we had a little thingy thing going with Atlas back in the day. Uh, because all

02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:06.160
these game companies were wanting to work with pot cause you know, it was, Ooh, podcasts. What's

02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:10.160
that all about? So yeah, most positive Atlas like sent us that disc and we did, we talked about the

02:18:10.160 --> 02:18:14.320
game on air and all that stuff. Uh, we did everything we were supposed to do, but it's like,

02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:23.200
Oh, I got rid of a promo copy, a promo copy of the most valuable PlayStation two game out there.

02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:27.680
And Phoenix seven, seven, two, six asks, is it any good? I played it and I thought it was pretty

02:18:27.680 --> 02:18:33.040
good. It was a creepy game. It is, but it's got a little like, uh, it's got a little flowers in the

02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:38.000
attic thing going on, if you know what I'm talking about. So some of those themes might be a little

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:45.120
like, Ooh, I don't know. So that's, um, I'll leave it at that. But as far as like a, uh, competent,

02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:50.880
uh, psychological horror type of game. Yes. That's why, that's why everybody, that's why everybody

02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:55.280
wants to play it and why it's so goddamn popular because it is a competent psychological horror

02:18:55.280 --> 02:19:02.960
game. That's kind of gross and you shouldn't be playing it probably. So, all right. A Phoenix

02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:08.400
77, 26 says, Rob, is that an old way of saying that it's problematic? No, no, I'm, I'm literally

02:19:08.400 --> 02:19:14.000
saying some of those problematic themes from flowers in the attic are also in rule of Rose,

02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:22.720
like specifically that piece of literature. All right. Anyway, SSG owner, Matt says flowers in

02:19:22.720 --> 02:19:28.000
the attic that flew over everyone's head. Pixel pocket is LOL. So not everybody, somebody knows

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:34.240
what I'm talking about. Fucking Google it. What is the plot of flowers in the attic?

02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:41.760
But I warned you. All right. I finally did get the, the guardian legacy, uh, or the guardian

02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:46.640
legends legacy thing they run. I just have to install XNA of the redistributable, um,

02:19:46.640 --> 02:19:51.360
redistributable, but cool. I can play it now. Neat. All right. Well have fun with that. Do some,

02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:56.640
do some recording. What's the link in chat? Yeah. All right. Uh, moving on. We got one more story

02:19:56.640 --> 02:20:02.960
officially, uh, on the record tonight and some folks in chat are like, why is toy in quotes? And

02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:07.840
what are we talking about with this story? Because it says on the sidebar, animal crossing toy

02:20:07.840 --> 02:20:15.920
in quotes. What does that mean? And well, y'all I'm talking about it for animal crossing.

02:20:15.920 --> 02:20:20.000
I'm talking about a butt plug is what I'm talking about. Uh, animal crossing, uh,

02:20:20.800 --> 02:20:26.640
it's in a whole report that vice did where they have designed a, they, somebody out there who has

02:20:26.640 --> 02:20:33.200
a lot of free time in this pandemic situation has designed a way for sex toys to communicate

02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:41.040
with a Nintendo switch and it's haptic feedback capabilities. So when animal crossing triggers

02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:46.720
a little character rumble by like digging a hole or hitting something with a shovel,

02:20:47.680 --> 02:20:51.120
that same haptic feedback can go right in your butt.

02:20:52.560 --> 02:20:58.400
Literally. I love that the effect can be triggered in solo play,

02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:03.280
but there are multiplayer possibilities as well.

02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:13.920
So what about the integration with one, two switch? I mean, cause I,

02:21:13.920 --> 02:21:17.920
I love that they tied it to animal crossing when in reality,

02:21:17.920 --> 02:21:22.720
all it is is that somebody figured out how to get the haptic vibrations that go in the controller

02:21:22.720 --> 02:21:30.800
to also go to a different device. And yet it's animal crossing that we all immediately go for.

02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:39.200
It's because rez isn't on the switch yet, but maybe, maybe they'll try harder to put it there

02:21:39.200 --> 02:21:44.960
in the future. Sorry. I'm screaming at this chat comment. This is my favorite thing.

02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:49.600
Pixel pockets and chat says animal crossing in my butt.

02:21:59.040 --> 02:22:07.040
Like seriously, like I guess you got all this time with the COVID-19 situation. And so it's like,

02:22:07.600 --> 02:22:13.680
you know, I've got all those free time. Hey, I wonder if I can get this to work with this.

02:22:13.680 --> 02:22:20.560
Why not? Sorry. I knocked all the Pokemon over cause I died laughing. All right.

02:22:23.680 --> 02:22:29.440
Hype mayhem and chat says, so Tom Nook can F you in the butt IRL, not just metaphorically in game.

02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:36.080
If, if that's what you want. Sure. Bobby says the best thing is the name of the API that they're

02:22:36.080 --> 02:22:39.680
using, which I don't even know what it is. And I don't think I want to know, did your own SS.

02:22:39.680 --> 02:22:45.440
Can I get a link for this? I know someone who would buy this. Sure. Let's see where can you

02:22:45.440 --> 02:22:52.080
get more information on this? I'm looking it up right now. Cause all I have are these stories

02:22:52.080 --> 02:22:59.440
that are going around. Oh, there's a GitHub for the project. And it is, the username is,

02:22:59.440 --> 02:23:11.120
um, Intiface. You can take it Intiface or, all right, forget it. It's I N T I F A C E. So,

02:23:11.120 --> 02:23:17.360
uh, Intiface is the user on GitHub and this is like Intiface console game haptics router.

02:23:17.360 --> 02:23:24.960
So there it is. Anyhow, enjoy that. Well, that's, that's interesting.

02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:32.320
All right. Let's quickly move on to another story. All right. Uh, this is the part where

02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:36.320
I'm going to open up the listener round table in our chat. If you have any questions or,

02:23:36.320 --> 02:23:40.240
or things you'd like us to address on the show, you can go ahead and say those in chat.

02:23:40.240 --> 02:23:42.960
Unfortunately, they're probably still going to be talking about butt plugs for the next

02:23:42.960 --> 02:23:46.960
five minutes. Uh, so maybe we need a few last minute stories to help us shift the topic around.

02:23:48.400 --> 02:23:54.720
Yes, we should definitely get something. Um, okay. All right. Wait, let me say this cause Bobby,

02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:59.360
Bobby brought it up like that. Bobby said, Hey, any news about summer games done quick?

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:03.840
Why? Yes. And you should listen to the Bobby Black Wolf show from tonight to find out.

02:24:03.840 --> 02:24:09.280
All right, go ahead. No, I'm just kidding. Um, Bobby, uh, auditioned to be a host at summer

02:24:09.280 --> 02:24:14.880
games done quick and, uh, good news and bad news. Uh, bad news is he is not one of the

02:24:14.880 --> 02:24:20.960
25 main hosts, but the good news is he's one of the backup hosts. Um, so if, if miss America

02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:26.080
cannot fulfill her duties as host, um, Bobby Black Wolf shall step in and be the, uh, runner

02:24:26.080 --> 02:24:31.360
up host, I think is the technical terms for it. Uh, the, all the details are on the show.

02:24:31.360 --> 02:24:34.960
Uh, finger, you know, it's, it's a weird situation cause you're like,

02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:39.760
Oh, uh, we really want to see Bobby get that opportunity, but Oh, if he gets that opportunity,

02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:43.760
that means somebody else had something happen where they can't do it. And that's very sad.

02:24:43.760 --> 02:24:48.800
So it's a tricky situation. So all I can really say is I'm just happy Bobby made it that far.

02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:53.920
It's his very first year of auditioning. I think there's something like 130 people that audition

02:24:53.920 --> 02:24:59.440
and he's maybe 120, I don't know. Uh, but he's in like the top 32 then 25 will say he's in the top

02:24:59.440 --> 02:25:03.280
32 of that. And that's, that's still pretty impressive, especially your first year with

02:25:03.280 --> 02:25:07.440
like no guidance or anything beyond your own research. So kudos to Bobby Black Wolf,

02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:12.640
high five, high five. And, um, I would say we hope to see you on summer games done quick,

02:25:12.640 --> 02:25:17.760
although that's rude. So I'm going to say instead, we hope you get a lot of great experience at

02:25:17.760 --> 02:25:22.720
summer games done quick so that in turn we see you at awesome games done quick when COVID is

02:25:22.720 --> 02:25:31.440
all done. Hopefully sound good. Good. All right. All right. So I've got some stuff that we can

02:25:31.440 --> 02:25:38.240
talk about. Um, did you know that there's a brand new DDR version coming out? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:45.760
I did hear, uh, it's, it's kind of like a rehash of ACE 20, right? Yeah. So it's, it's a 20 plus

02:25:46.480 --> 02:25:52.320
and they're adding more songs to it as well. Uh, I launched, I appreciate that cause I love third

02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:58.880
mix plus and fourth mix plus. So yeah. So it launched already on the gold cabinets on the first,

02:25:59.520 --> 02:26:05.840
um, but now it'll be coming to the blue cabinets, I believe on the eighth, if I remember correctly.

02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:11.520
Where is it launching? Arcades are closed. Are there arcades still open in Japan?

02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:16.720
I guess they are. Yeah, I guess they've controlled the, I guess I heard a resurgence is

02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:20.800
kind of like coming, but they're kind of managing it a little better there, but it's awesome. My

02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:26.640
first thing is like, where the fuck are arcades open right now? Yeah. So they've got some new

02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:31.840
songs. Um, you know, there's four that were mentioned. So destructive force by bad myth,

02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:37.760
hyper twist, hyper bomb in the past. And then there's a last card by chorus K, uh,

02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:44.720
looks pretty awesome. And they did some rebalancing. They have a new thing, uh,

02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:51.440
that's basically to check your level. So it allows you to see what kind of, uh, foot level

02:26:51.440 --> 02:26:55.520
you should be. I don't even know if they do foot feet or any more if it's stars or whatever.

02:26:55.520 --> 02:27:01.280
Um, but they're basically trying to let you know, like what level you should be playing at, uh,

02:27:01.280 --> 02:27:07.200
what songs may be right for you so you can play that stage and then it will assess you and let

02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:12.320
you know, okay, you're good for these songs. And just real quick, cause I said, where are arcades

02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:16.320
open, but I'm being corrected in chat cause yeah, Bobby had that whole thing on the pinball arcade.

02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:19.840
He did on the show a couple of weeks ago and he says, are Dave and busters and main event

02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:24.800
are open here. And you know, now that I think about it, um, bars, it probably, if bars were

02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:29.760
open, I don't see why a place like round one or Dave and busters weren't also open. Um,

02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:34.480
especially like casinos and all that. Although, as you know, here in California where we're at,

02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:40.080
they in all the mostly populated counties, you know, it's not every county, but it's mostly the

02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:44.560
populated ones. Uh, they've closed everything again. So, um, they're not having it now,

02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:50.320
but yeah, you're, I gotta remember the world in California. Um, but yeah, I just, I, I,

02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:56.560
going out to play DDR in public, like there, I can't think of anything I want to do less.

02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:03.120
I still think this news is cool, but I'll wait until next year. Thanks.

02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:13.680
So, um, because we're clamoring for, uh, brand new press events and stuff, I am happy to announce

02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:20.560
that Devolver digital direct 2020 will be airing on Saturday, July 11th. So we can look forward to

02:28:20.560 --> 02:28:27.440
that this week. Uh, I can't wait. It's going to be, uh, at 12 PM Pacific time on Twitch.

02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:35.120
That should be fun. And then, uh, apparently Nintendo is, um, they're not too concerned

02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:39.520
anymore about 3DS vulnerabilities. They've actually shifted their hacker bounty program

02:28:39.520 --> 02:28:46.560
to entirely, um, encompass the switch now and, um, no longer have any 3DS

02:28:46.560 --> 02:28:51.440
vulnerabilities in their program. Nintendo officially no longer cares about the 3DS

02:28:51.440 --> 02:28:58.720
confirmed hack away. Yep. Hack away. And then apparently there's a VR experience in Japan for,

02:28:58.720 --> 02:29:05.040
uh, Rockman over there. So Rockman VR aimed at the virtual world. I want to play that.

02:29:05.920 --> 02:29:09.200
Oh, is that something like, uh, like, I don't know, like mega Bay and

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:16.640
legend in like VR or something, or am I totally on base? I don't know. They said starting July 18th.

02:29:17.200 --> 02:29:30.000
Um, it'll be playable at the Plaza Capcom, um, in Tokyo's, uh, Ika Bakuro. And I don't know if they

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:36.480
said it'll be a permanent VR corner where you can experience, uh, that game. It says, uh, apparently

02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:42.560
in the game says you create a Donna headset created by Dr. Light and try to stop Dr. Wily.

02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:45.760
Well, that's pretty much every single game. It actually, it actually kind of reminds me

02:29:45.760 --> 02:29:49.280
of another story that we cut from the list tonight. It was a surprising amount of news

02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:53.040
for this. I thought going into today, I was like, I think it was a slow news week. And then I'm like,

02:29:53.040 --> 02:29:57.280
Oh, actually, no, it wasn't. There was a lot of stuff. Um, there was an emulator that came out for

02:29:57.280 --> 02:30:03.040
the NES that takes 2d games and turns them into 3d games. And one of the main man games was one

02:30:03.040 --> 02:30:08.960
of them. No, it's not. I mean, it's more like, um, not like a first person 3d, but it's like, uh,

02:30:08.960 --> 02:30:14.560
like you kind of can tilt the play field kind of thing. Do you, uh, speaking of the 3DS,

02:30:14.560 --> 02:30:19.680
remember back when the 3DS was releasing some NES games and there were a few that had enhancements

02:30:19.680 --> 02:30:26.080
where it would make some stereoscopic 3d stuff. It's basically that without the stereoscopic 3d.

02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:31.200
Okay. Okay. I got you. So they have like voxel support and stuff. And so like, it'll make,

02:30:31.200 --> 02:30:38.000
you know, the pipes rounded in super Mario, um, brothers three or, um, it'll do stuff like that.

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:42.320
And it, they have like a few hundred games that it supports that they've added this,

02:30:42.320 --> 02:30:48.240
these enhancements to, um, pretty cool. Um, can I just say real quick, and this is totally

02:30:48.240 --> 02:30:52.720
unrelated to what we're talking about, but just off camera over here, my husband is unloading the,

02:30:52.720 --> 02:30:58.800
the supplies from target. And can I say how happy I am? Can you bring me like your gold star discovery

02:30:58.800 --> 02:31:04.320
that you got at target? Can I just say how happy I am? Because I think this is a sign that somehow

02:31:04.320 --> 02:31:13.200
the earth will heal. Um, is that Alan was actually able to find at target the really good toilet

02:31:13.200 --> 02:31:22.000
paper. And there was a lot of it in stock and it's not some fucking off brand shit. And it's not some

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:30.400
like one ply 99 cent store thing. This is the real, this is gold plated toilet paper.

02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:35.280
Yeah. It's only a disinfectant. Wait. Yeah. It's like a blanket. Actually. Wait,

02:31:35.280 --> 02:31:38.160
as I don't want this being an endorsement that they didn't pay for it. God damn it.

02:31:38.160 --> 02:31:43.520
Is there a name like not on there somewhere? So this is a sign perhaps

02:31:44.240 --> 02:31:47.920
that nature will find a way we will heal.

02:31:51.760 --> 02:31:58.720
Looking in chat at some comments, um, orange, right? Says, wow. Pixel pockets put X, D, um,

02:31:58.800 --> 02:32:04.720
issue on her map. But yes, I was so excited when I got the text message. I put, we're going to Vegas.

02:32:07.280 --> 02:32:09.120
Hello. I'm on camera.

02:32:13.040 --> 02:32:19.520
There's a great, like one line on your article that says, um, two month long personal nightmare

02:32:19.520 --> 02:32:22.800
of using up the wrong type of toilet paper that someone purchased finally over.

02:32:23.840 --> 02:32:27.360
Cause like the husband brings home the wrong toilet paper and it's like, this is,

02:32:27.360 --> 02:32:32.960
we have to use this now for weeks. And then once the final role is all they have though,

02:32:32.960 --> 02:32:38.480
you have to just, you have to buy what they have. Well, everybody else is having to dip into their,

02:32:38.480 --> 02:32:43.680
you know, bunker supply now. So it finally leaves some nice fluffy three ply for the rest of us.

02:32:43.680 --> 02:32:49.040
And I couldn't be more thankful. We're still using up the, uh, industrial like paper towels

02:32:49.040 --> 02:32:53.280
that I got a while back from Amazon, like the stuff that you would find in your office building

02:32:53.280 --> 02:32:58.880
bathroom. Um, and to be honest, I mean, those things have lasted for months. Like I still

02:32:58.880 --> 02:33:04.640
have like three rolls of that stuff left and they were like massive, but I remember at one time,

02:33:04.640 --> 02:33:09.280
like the local grocery store by us, they could not get toilet paper in and all they can do is

02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:13.840
get it from their supplier. And so it was like, it was that really cheap, cheap, cheap stuff that

02:33:13.840 --> 02:33:19.840
they're selling by single roll. And it's like, take what I can get. Uh, quest buster and chat

02:33:19.840 --> 02:33:25.760
says you have added premium toilet paper to your inventory, plus one to charisma.

02:33:28.320 --> 02:33:35.280
Um, yes, but yeah, we, we had like, we had just bought a big pack right before we went on the

02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:39.760
cruise. Cause you might remember we were on a cruise like the week before lockdown started and

02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:43.200
everything was fine with the cruise. It was nothing like you heard about with the other stuff.

02:33:43.200 --> 02:33:49.200
Um, so, uh, we were able, we were able to use that for like months. I think we finally just

02:33:49.200 --> 02:33:55.120
ran out of that like last month. And then it was like, Oh, the horrific, uh, off-brand supply has

02:33:55.120 --> 02:34:00.800
to begin now. So I'm so glad our long national nightmare is over. All right. Uh, let's see,

02:34:00.800 --> 02:34:05.600
uh, other comments in chat here. Um, Hype Mayhem says nice teepee pun. Yup. Yeah. That's what we're

02:34:05.600 --> 02:34:11.120
pros at here at OLR. SG100 Matt says we went from talking about butts and now we're back to it.

02:34:11.120 --> 02:34:17.360
And Azet with what will probably be the perfect chat comment tonight. Everything is about butts.

02:34:17.360 --> 02:34:23.040
Correct. Everything is about butts. Uh, any other last minute stories?

02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:30.000
No, that's it. Then I think that's the perfect note to end on. Uh, so get it and on. All right.

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:34.240
Anyway, so that is going to do it for another episode of orange lounge radio. Thank you guys

02:34:34.240 --> 02:34:38.720
so much for checking out our show tonight. Uh, whether it was on the podcast feed or on Twitch,

02:34:38.720 --> 02:34:44.000
we really appreciate your guys' support and you lasted through the whole thing. Congratulations.

02:34:44.240 --> 02:34:48.960
It's been a night of ups and downs. Let me tell you. Uh, and it was only two of us here tonight,

02:34:48.960 --> 02:34:54.800
like is something anyway. Um, thank you guys so much for downloading the show or tuning in live.

02:34:54.800 --> 02:34:58.720
All we ask. We don't, we don't really ask for your money. Although if you do throw the subs

02:34:58.720 --> 02:35:02.160
and the bits, we're not going to complain. I'm going to, I'm going to put that out there. However,

02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:05.840
all we really, really want, just help us spread the word. We are the show where every gamer has

02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:09.680
a voice, but we need your friends. We need your enemies. We need your frenemies here,

02:35:09.680 --> 02:35:13.600
uh, to help out and expand our audience. Uh, because we are the show where every gamer has

02:35:13.600 --> 02:35:18.560
a voice. But if your voices aren't here to put on air, what are we going to do? So anyway, um,

02:35:18.560 --> 02:35:23.840
a nice five star review wherever you found this show goes a nice long way. Auto hosts on Twitch

02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:28.720
are outstanding. And I thank all of you that do it. Unfortunately, Twitch no longer gives me a

02:35:28.720 --> 02:35:32.160
list of who's doing it. So I can't thank you personally, but please know if you're doing it.

02:35:32.160 --> 02:35:37.280
I do see some of it on the stats stuff like viewers who watch these channels also watch

02:35:37.280 --> 02:35:40.640
yours because they're always hosting or whatever. So we really appreciate that. So thank you. Thank

02:35:40.640 --> 02:35:47.040
you. Thank you. Um, that takes us to, I believe final thoughts. So Loki with that all said,

02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:51.280
do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight? Uh, I don't really have much of anything,

02:35:51.280 --> 02:35:55.680
but I did want to mention that X-Box game pass ultimate right now as a dollar.

02:35:55.680 --> 02:36:03.280
Oh shit. Where? On Microsoft site. Really? Like for new people only?

02:36:04.880 --> 02:36:10.240
Or can I buy 12 of them? I don't know. I'm trying to figure that out right now.

02:36:10.240 --> 02:36:13.520
Take that with a grain of salt. Cause I have a feeling that could be a new people

02:36:13.520 --> 02:36:18.800
only type of offer. It's like 99 cents for your first month of insert thing here. And then you're

02:36:18.800 --> 02:36:25.120
subscribed on NeoGaf. So that's why. Okay. And, and, and, and I went to the page and it said a

02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:31.920
dollar. Yeah. So I don't know. All right. We'll look at, we'll look into that. All right. Um,

02:36:31.920 --> 02:36:36.000
and that's your final thought tonight. That's my final thought. All right. Uh, and my final

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:41.440
thought tonight is, um, yeah, I think, I think I said all my piece earlier in the show, so I'm not

02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:46.240
going to say too much more, but just, um, you know, thank you all for being here. I, I'm so

02:36:46.240 --> 02:36:51.440
thankful, uh, that there's a place for me to say shit on Sunday night and there's people that

02:36:51.440 --> 02:36:56.000
actually want to listen to it. Thank you so much. We'll see you in seven days to talk about video

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:59.840
games all over again, dark soccer. We'll be back next week. And I think she's here for the full

02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:03.760
show next week. Cause she did a work thing where she's not working on Monday. So that's really

02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:08.400
exciting. So we'll be back in seven days to talk about whatever happens in the next week and with

02:37:08.400 --> 02:37:15.040
E3 not having happened and random announcements coming at random times, there could be a lot of

02:37:15.040 --> 02:37:20.160
stuff. In the meantime, I will enjoy my burger time machine. You enjoy whatever it is, makes you

02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:26.800
happy. Have a wonderful night, everybody. You've been listening to orange lounge radio. Orange
