0	13440	In the year of hindsight, we find ourselves with non-news and weird news.
13440	17280	Would it surprise you to hear that Sony is ramping up more supply of PlayStation 5s?
17280	19520	Can you have more when you're already making many?
19520	20520	Shrug.
20520	24560	Also, Microsoft Flight Simulator's Physical Edition is coming on 10 DVDs because Blu-ray
24560	28240	won the war but hasn't proliferated outside of devices that connect to your TV.
28240	32080	Tonight, your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki bring you news that would require
32080	37120	three audio CDs to hold, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
37120	44680	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
44680	49360	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
49360	57880	It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again tonight with episode number 828 for this July
57880	60480	19th of 2020.
60480	65760	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you live from our studio in Sacramento, California, where
65760	70880	we would all collaborate usually over the last 18 years in the same room.
70880	74020	But due to the way things are in the world, we're doing a little bit of social distant
74020	76420	recording thanks to the magic of Discord.
76420	78320	So I'm here and joining me on Discord.
78320	80560	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
80560	81560	Hello.
81560	82560	Hi, how are you?
82560	83560	I don't know.
83560	84560	Maybe I should make it a little bit more obvious.
84560	90400	I am protecting myself from the plague.
90400	97360	I have my plague mask shoved with Rosemary in it right now.
97360	101600	So you're showing off your mask on Twitch, because even though this is a radio podcast
101600	102600	—
102600	103600	People can screenshot it.
103600	104600	Yeah, that's true.
104600	105600	We do tape live —
105600	107480	And it's low because I've got this damn mask on.
107480	112320	We do tape live every Sunday night at The Voice of the Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash
112320	116740	VOG Network Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby
116740	117740	Blackwell show.
117740	121040	So if you do want to see some of the video, you can join us live or you can subscribe
121040	123080	to us over at VOG Network.
123080	128100	And yeah, I guess the elaborate mask that you're wearing is impacting some of the audio,
128100	129440	but I think we got that now.
129440	133040	I folded the mask under now, so that should be a little bit better.
133040	134840	Oh yeah, that sounds better to me.
134840	138960	So you get the top down view without me covering my mouth.
138960	139960	Ta-da!
139960	140960	Ta-da!
141000	145160	I feel now like I should actually have like a gachamon helmet on instead.
145160	147640	Just call me June the swallow.
147640	151800	Some of the comments from our chat room over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, sg100matt
151800	154600	says, the mask protects her from the haters.
154600	155600	Tiger —
155600	156600	What haters?
156600	159000	Tigerclaws says she should take that mask to work.
159000	161680	Imagine how the coworkers would react, but you're working from home right now.
161680	162680	I work from home.
162680	163680	Exactly.
163680	164680	Yeah.
164680	167960	I mean, this arrived the day after because I had to go in and clean out my desk at work,
167960	171840	which means it's all official now.
171840	175640	If I had this yesterday, the day that I went, I would have worn it, but it actually arrived
175640	176640	yesterday.
176640	179600	So, oh well.
179600	182320	Was that a friend online who made that?
182320	184640	Yeah, my friend Amber did.
184640	185640	Nice.
185640	188680	And for those that aren't able to see the video, it's kind of like a space type of thing,
188680	192120	but it's against the old school type of plague mask with the big beak.
192120	197280	So a dark Sakura kind of looks like bird Sakura tonight.
197280	201160	Here is a picture on my Twitter from yesterday.
201160	202500	So there you go.
202500	203500	Good way to —
203500	204760	You got to go hunting for it.
204760	207280	Good way to get the cheap plug in for the Twitter there.
207280	209720	And my Instagram at dark Sakura.
209720	212780	Questbuster in chat says she's ready to treat medieval patients.
212780	213780	That's right.
213780	216040	Yeah, I'm going to give them cocaine.
216040	221160	She's also ready to greet people who misbehave in our chat room tonight.
221160	223960	Any random Twitch trolls beware.
223960	224960	Speaking of trolls —
224960	226540	I never get trolled.
226540	229600	Also say hello, uh, joining us every week here on the show.
229600	230600	Say hello to tech master.
230600	231600	Loki.
231600	232600	Hello.
232600	233600	Hi, how are you?
233600	234660	I'm doing fine.
234660	239340	And I see tonight you've got some — is that Minecraft going on behind you, like an elaborate?
239340	240340	Yes.
240340	245540	And this is actually a B-roll that I recorded just before the show of my actual server.
245540	249340	So this is all of the stuff that I've built.
249340	252420	I thought you were actually like playing the way you were kind of looking.
252420	256460	I thought you might be like actually playing Minecraft right now while doing the show.
256460	259840	Technically, yes, I was playing Minecraft at the time to record that.
259840	263860	So this is like, for example, the second or third floor in my basement with the automatic
263860	264860	sorting system.
264860	266860	It's all redstone I've built.
266860	268740	But yeah, I'll be scrolling.
268740	272900	It'll be just showing kind of the stuff I've built over the course of things like 15 minutes
272900	273900	long.
273900	274900	It'll just be looping.
274900	275900	Wow.
275900	276900	All right.
276900	277900	Well, it looks fancy for Minecraft.
277900	278900	It looks pretty cool.
278900	282060	It's been, yeah, a few months, so it's pretty fancy now.
282060	283060	All right.
283060	285460	Well, let's get into some news tonight.
285460	288820	Of course, Minecraft is a Microsoft property now.
288820	292720	And we know we're going to be getting a lot of Microsoft news coming up this week.
292720	297300	And in advance of that, we have some other little details that have come out kind of
297300	300020	in advance of the show on the 23rd.
300020	301580	Although we do know on the...
301580	304420	And Loki, I'll ask you to recap these stories here in a minute.
304420	307620	But what we do know on the 23rd is that we're not going to get a price.
307620	309220	We're not going to get a date for the system.
309220	312580	So they've already kind of set our expectations there.
312580	313580	Sony didn't.
313580	314580	Why should they?
314700	315700	We don't know.
315700	317660	We're not going to get either of those.
317660	320020	But we will get games, games, games.
320020	326700	So I imagine a new Halo kind of deep dive, hopefully something Forza, either mainline
326700	330220	Horizon or maybe a new thing for Forza, who knows?
330220	332680	And then I imagine we're getting maybe Fable.
332680	334620	That's always the big rumor is that Fable's coming back.
334620	336020	One of the studios is working on Fable.
336020	338420	That'd be pretty cool.
338420	339420	And then who knows?
339420	342340	We know Microsoft has acquired many, many studios over the past couple of years.
342340	346420	I think it was something like 13 studios, places like Double Fine and stuff.
346420	349980	So we know Microsoft has been acquiring these studios, and we're going to find out this
349980	354780	week what most of them likely have been working on, or at least a good chunk of them.
354780	358020	We probably won't get to see them all, although that would be pretty impressive if they all
358020	359020	had something.
359020	363460	But imagine we'll see a good chunk of them, and that's to get everybody hyped, really,
363460	369480	especially with Sony coming right off of some big exclusives on their system.
369480	375360	Sony just released Ghosts of Tsushima this week, which is doing really well as far as
375360	378400	a lot of the reviews and things people are saying online.
378400	384480	They also, of course, have Last of Us 2, which, as I guess controversial as that game is,
384480	389120	it seems like mostly critics agree it's pretty good.
389120	393060	Just a lot of controversies and where the story went, I suppose.
393060	397520	But in God of War, Horizon, Sony's got a lot of great, great IPs.
397520	400140	So it's going to be interesting to see now Microsoft really kind of show what they're
400140	402320	going to offer to really go against that.
402320	405680	Meanwhile, Nintendo's over here putting out a new Mario game this week and kind of doing
405680	408960	their own thing, and that's what's worked for them.
408960	413960	Anyway, other big news, though, about Microsoft ahead of their event.
413960	416960	I can't really say press conference, because that's what it would have been if this was
416960	417960	an E3 world.
417960	421520	Yeah, it's like an online direct, if you will.
421520	423400	Virtual event on the 23rd.
423920	429040	Yeah, so they announced, of course, that they're going to be wrapping up the production on
429040	437360	the Xbox One X, which makes sense, because you have the Xbox Series X coming out.
437360	443280	But they already have stopped production on that, so that's to be expected with the brand
443280	447660	new version that's going to kind of replace it anyways.
447660	451480	Or possibly something else that's unannounced yet that may replace it, so we'll have to
451480	452480	wait and see.
453400	460720	Along with that other cool stuff, Game Pass Ultimate now is going to be getting the X
460720	466400	Cloud support, so that's going to be included with the price of Game Pass, which is pretty
466400	467400	cool.
467400	471400	So $15 a month to get all that with Xbox Live together.
471400	479200	And then, of course, there's rumors that they may be just getting rid of Xbox Live
479200	488160	Gold altogether, because already SKUs have been taken off of the Xbox website, where
488160	493360	you cannot purchase a year subscription to Xbox Live Gold anymore.
493360	496580	So you can only purchase three months or one month.
496580	500580	So I'm wondering if maybe at the end of the year, they're just going to kick off Gold
500580	503400	altogether and maybe replace it with something else.
503400	509920	This Xbox Game Pass, it'll just be the one fee and you get all of the services under
509920	510920	that one.
510920	517240	If only anyone could have potentially saw this coming three years ago, although I saw
517240	519920	that eye roll, I can say.
519920	527200	So we'll see what happens, because it could be that they're just replacing with the Xbox
527200	529920	this Game Pass thing, so it would be pretty cool.
529920	534600	Because if that's the case, then it's kind of like, whereas they were giving away one
534600	539200	or two free games a month or whatever, now you're getting like 100 games total.
539200	543200	They're going to be rolling new titles into it each month.
543200	545840	It's going to be interesting to see what they do with that.
545840	551040	I know that's why they're kind of keeping their cards close to their chest, because
551040	556360	they don't want Sony to kind of react with their PlayStation Now, although let's be honest
556360	561040	with you, PlayStation Now, I don't really care for it too much.
561040	565320	Definitely the Game Pass is a lot more appealing to me.
565320	567840	So I'm curious to see what they announce.
567840	568840	Yeah.
568840	573360	S2100 Matt in chat says, Rob is going to pull that lever that has the banner that says,
573360	574440	I was right.
574440	576360	He's been waiting to pull that for three years.
576360	581160	Yeah, it's just going to be a bunch of dust and balloon particles that fall from the ceiling
581160	582160	when that happens.
582160	583320	No, here's the thing.
583320	584320	Okay.
584320	586000	So I have like two mindsets about this.
586000	590840	There is that part of me that still kind of is convinced that Microsoft may be doing this.
590840	594400	And for those of you that are newer to OLR and don't know what I'm talking about, I said
594400	598960	in one of the year prediction segments, beginning of the year things about three years ago,
598960	604200	I said, Microsoft is going to go big and they're going to do something really shocking because
604200	608460	they were, they're still feeling a little sore from when they got slapped in the face
608460	614240	by Sony at E3 all those years ago when the PlayStation 4 was first revealed and they
614240	616320	really sucker punched the Xbox One.
616320	621020	And so Microsoft is just waiting to sucker punch Sony and say, well, we're going to get
621020	622720	rid of the price to pay online.
622720	628200	And I've kind of given these reasons for it is that Xbox, PC, they're trying to come closer
628200	630000	together into one environment.
630000	635680	And isn't it really weird that if I have no man's sky on PC, I don't have to pay to play
635680	636680	online.
636680	641000	But if I have it on my on Microsoft Xbox, I do have to pay to play it online, even though
641000	642660	we have cross platform now.
642660	644660	Like, aren't those types of things weird?
644660	648980	So yeah, so what I could definitely see them doing to keep parity with the PC side is just
648980	655740	charge for games pass and the X cloud service and then do Xbox live for free, basically.
655740	658460	Well, okay, so I'm still I'm still a couple couple mindsets.
658460	659460	Yeah, exactly.
659460	663700	Is that I think they could still make Xbox live free and go that way.
663700	666900	And that would be a huge shocker in the industry.
666900	671220	And you know, the only the thing I would have gotten wrong was that I would have predicted
671220	677500	Microsoft to do it mid cycle for Xbox one to get the leg up on PlayStation.
677500	681780	What I would have gotten wrong is that they've been saving it to do it at the start of a
681780	686700	new cycle to really get the jump on the PlayStation five.
686700	689580	And you know, kind of looking back hindsight's 2020.
689580	693380	You think about this news about Microsoft positioning all these chess pieces and interesting
693380	694940	places and so forth.
694940	700900	They've been setting up to go big with Xbox Series X for years.
700900	707940	So if they do end up sucker punching Sony and saying, guess what, online is now free,
707940	712060	then that's going to be, you know, a huge, a huge thing.
712060	718420	And it's going to be a huge plus in Microsoft's hat, especially when rumor is this big rumor.
718420	722900	But a lot of, you know, even like investor articles online are saying that you can expect
722900	726100	that Microsoft's console is going to cost less than Sony's console.
726100	729300	So all those things are going to add up to something very, very, very interesting.
729300	734340	Now, all that being said about the whole, why I might be right camp, there is still
734340	738820	that critical, you know, having watched this industry for years and years and doing this
738820	742780	show, there's that other side of me, it's a little more realistic that thinks this is
742780	749220	more of a branding type of thing is that it's too confusing to have game pass ultimate,
749220	756380	an X cloud pass and games with gold, all these separate, you know, tickets that are separate.
756380	757380	It's too much to keep track of.
757380	763960	Now granted, Loki just said, they just announced this week that X cloud and game pass ultimate
763960	765060	are going to be tied together.
765060	767700	So you're not going to have to worry about like, what is it?
767700	774460	But isn't it interesting that they didn't say Xbox gold is that too?
774460	780660	So that almost makes me wonder, it kind of goes back to, oh, maybe I'm right again, because
780660	782580	they didn't call that out.
782580	784940	And why wouldn't they have if that's the direction they're going?
784940	788580	I don't think though, that they're just rebranding it, because if that was the case, and they
788580	791540	would just still have the subscription up, they would just say, Okay, well, after this
791540	794300	date, we're just calling it something different.
794300	798260	I think that they're just changing up how they actually, you know, sell it.
798260	806100	So I guess I don't know what's going to happen if I mean, I guess if you purchase so many
806100	811700	years of Xbox Live gold, maybe they'll just convert that over into games pass or something
811700	812700	like that.
812700	818260	Um, yeah, we'll wait until Thursday this week.
818260	819260	Dark soccer.
819260	820260	Let me pick on you for a minute here.
820260	821260	We'll not pick on you.
821260	825900	But I want your opinion from somebody who specifically is probably not really a Microsoft
825900	826900	person.
826900	828940	Like, I don't think you and Dan even have an I don't remember Do you guys even have
828940	829940	an Xbox?
829940	830940	I don't think you do.
830940	832940	Since Xbox 360.
832940	833940	Okay.
833940	834940	Okay.
834940	840860	So you've been in Microsoft's camp before, but it would be fair to say of Sony, Nintendo
840860	844580	and Microsoft, Microsoft's getting the least amount in your house, right?
844580	845580	Yeah.
845580	846580	Okay.
846580	848220	It doesn't, we don't feel too much love for it.
848220	850500	And I would imagine a lot of that is the games, right?
850500	854020	It's just not the, you know, you've made your feelings on Halo known on this show before
854020	855020	and so forth.
855020	858380	It's not the games are not tickling your fancy, so to speak.
858380	861220	Nothing interesting enough yet to really make it worth it to me, right?
861220	866580	So I mean, I feel like dark soccer is the type of gamer that Microsoft like Phil Spencer
866580	870340	sees dark soccer and goes, that's who I need to bring back to Microsoft.
870340	875020	So that being said, when I talk about this potential that, oh, Microsoft might get rid
875020	876820	of the fee to pay online.
876820	877820	Does that excite you at all?
877820	880060	Or is it just kind of like a no, no, no.
880060	881060	Okay.
881060	882060	No.
882060	884060	Show me the games.
884060	885060	Fair enough.
885060	886060	I don't care if they're free.
886060	887060	I want good games.
887060	888060	Fair enough.
888060	889360	No, that's, that's excellent point.
889360	891060	It's just, it's really about the games.
891060	892060	So okay.
892060	896860	And, and all this new, you know, well granted, everything is really speculation and the little
896860	902580	news that's come out was not in the context of a press conference or direct or anything.
902580	906500	It's just, you know, kind of a leaking, I don't want to say leaking, but like comments
906500	910700	to game journalists, blogs, and things like that, a Twitter posts.
910700	912780	And that's where a lot of this is coming out right now.
912780	919500	So you know, to, to your credit and that point, dark soccer, July 23rd, here comes the games.
919500	923620	So I'm really interested to hear your take on what happens after this week.
923620	927900	And if anything comes out of, out of that, where you go, Ooh, we'll see.
927900	933700	The other thing too, is why am I going to buy a system when I've, I, me playing the
933700	939340	last of us is the first time I've touched my PS4 since last year, except to dust it
939340	941740	a couple of times.
941740	948220	So it's, if I haven't been touching that and I really like the system, what makes me going
948220	953820	to touch, uh, uh, get an Xbox one just to do, you know, I don't, I'm going to pay money
953820	957180	to do something that I'm probably just going to let sit there anyway and not care about.
957180	961620	So, well, and the fact that you do a lot of gaming on PC, Mac computers, you're using
961620	966720	computers in place of concerts, switch a lot lately.
966720	972660	The only gaming I've really done on, on any, uh, computer has been on my Mac and it's been,
972660	977620	I mean, just my puzzle games and a few, uh, a few like typography based games and stuff
977620	978620	on Apple arcade, really.
978620	984240	Um, although, yeah, I've been mentioning, I am going to stream, um, for charity once
984240	987120	I get, you know, everything put together from the house.
987120	989380	So I voted for the game that didn't win.
989380	991620	I voted for Colonel Sanders.
991620	992620	Didn't win.
992620	998700	I had to do a new poll because dream daddy and how to full boyfriend tied.
998700	1000460	I also voted for Colonel Sanders.
1000460	1002380	So yeah.
1002380	1003380	Fuck my drag.
1003380	1004380	Right.
1004380	1005380	All right.
1005380	1006380	Okay.
1006380	1011460	Mayhem, uh, hype mayhem and chat says, uh, I think that was a Kennedy Davenport line
1011460	1012460	too.
1012460	1017100	Uh, hype mayhem says, even when I was strictly a con Bobby voted for Colonel Sanders to all
1017100	1021700	the VOG people voted for Colonel Sanders, uh, hype mayhem says, uh, even when I was
1021700	1026700	strictly a console gamer, the three 60 was my secondary console.
1026700	1031220	PC is my main thing right now, although I do fire up my three 60 every now and then
1031220	1039060	I'm very curious to see on the 23rd, how much PC is a win for Microsoft.
1039060	1043380	And what I mean by that is, is the emphasis, is there going to be, how much emphasis is
1043380	1044920	there going to be on Xbox series X?
1044920	1047680	We know we're not getting the system where no, we're not getting the date.
1047680	1054860	So is, I'm curious to see how many times the messages reiterated coming to PC and Xbox,
1054860	1058420	or this is something you can play on PC and let's be real, it's Microsoft.
1058420	1059420	So they're going to say windows.
1059420	1061020	This would be a lot of windows 10.
1061020	1062020	It's a windows 10 game.
1062020	1063020	Cause it's Microsoft.
1063020	1064020	That's what they're going to do.
1064020	1067780	So, um, I know, but so let's be real.
1067780	1068780	That's what they're going to do.
1068780	1069780	But go ahead.
1069780	1075060	So here's what I don't understand about X-cloud so I, and this is just my not doing any research
1075060	1076060	on it.
1076060	1082180	Um, so X-cloud is that streaming from your Xbox to your phone or is that like, say just
1082180	1085940	any other game streaming service where it's just from the cloud to you, whatever device
1085940	1090340	that you want to stream to, because if it doesn't require a console, I would love to
1090340	1096300	have X-cloud support for my PC to be able to play these games that I don't have a console
1096300	1097300	for.
1097300	1098300	Great question.
1098300	1101060	And one I'm hoping we get more clarity on, uh, on the 23rd.
1101060	1103940	Cause I think the branding with X-cloud is kind of confusing.
1103940	1107860	I think the fact that we don't have a definitive, like this is the answer to that.
1107860	1112840	Um, and I'm sure you guys in chat, you know, and as far as I know, the project X-cloud
1112840	1119040	that's been tested is your Xbox streaming to your device, uh, like a phone or something
1119040	1120040	like that.
1120040	1123520	Or even, I suppose your PC, which is something you've been able to do for a long time, really
1123520	1125680	a stream your Xbox one to your PC.
1125680	1131240	But I do think that's a message that Microsoft could stand to kind of clarify a little bit,
1131240	1132680	like what is X-cloud?
1132680	1137820	Is it, is it gaming from the cloud to your Xbox or is it, is it all of it?
1137820	1139280	Like what's the difference?
1139280	1140520	How does one work versus another?
1140520	1145500	And I, I kind of think, I think there's going to be a lot when it comes to like branding
1145500	1148220	and how they show that off, that's going to be important.
1148220	1151660	And I know a lot of you, again, a lot of you guys are probably sitting there ready to explain
1151660	1153840	it to me in technical fashion, how it all works.
1153840	1155160	And I get that.
1155160	1158440	But remember, we got to explain this to the average consumer.
1158440	1163880	We got to explain this to the parent that's shopping for the household or hell the college
1163880	1168280	kid that's buying their home console or whatever it is, you know, it's gotta be explaining
1168280	1172700	it a little more to that audience, especially around the holiday season.
1172700	1176920	Explain to grandma why this, this, why Microsoft X-cloud makes it better than so.
1176920	1181160	So to clarify, so according to the actual official page is that, and this is just for
1181160	1184600	the test, this test streaming console quality tiles from the cloud.
1184600	1185600	No waiting for downloads.
1185600	1189280	During the preview, you don't need to own games or console.
1189280	1193940	So it is right now streaming just from the cloud, not from a console.
1193940	1195640	I'm curious if it's going to stay that way.
1195640	1196640	I didn't even know.
1197400	1203480	I mean, sorry, it's either way for like other thing, everything else out of, you know, the
1203480	1204920	games pass stuff.
1204920	1208880	It says a lot that I was convinced it was your console to your phone.
1208880	1212440	And I swear that's something they've also been testing and fine.
1212440	1215840	I'm, I'm happy to be wrong because it just proves my point.
1215840	1221360	Like we kind of need clarity on what is it and how does it work and how easy is it going
1221360	1223800	to be, you know, in that whole thing.
1223800	1224800	Yeah.
1224960	1225960	Yeah.
1225960	1226960	So.
1226960	1227960	All right.
1227960	1233120	S2100 Matt says there is a Reddit thread where people ask folks to explain certain things
1233120	1234200	like they're 12.
1234200	1235200	I thought it was five.
1235200	1238160	Isn't there a subreddit ELI five or something like that?
1238160	1239160	Yeah.
1239160	1240880	So, well, there's probably a 12 year old one too.
1240880	1244620	The way you'd word things to a 12 year old and the five year old are a little different,
1244620	1245620	but still.
1245620	1246620	Yeah.
1246620	1250320	That's, that's, that's what, that's what Microsoft needs to do with xCloud.
1250320	1251960	ELI 12.
1251960	1252960	That's what it is.
1253120	1254120	So.
1254120	1255120	All right.
1255120	1256120	Anyway.
1256120	1261360	Um, Loki, are you, are you getting hyped about this event?
1261360	1265720	Are you kind of lukewarm on Microsoft game information?
1265720	1272480	So yes, of course I got to say I'm, I love Sony and I love PlayStation five.
1272480	1277500	I almost am more excited about Microsoft this time around and I think it has something to
1277500	1280580	do with their underdog status.
1280580	1284380	You know, the reality is y'all, I love games so much.
1284380	1286020	I'm going to buy both.
1286020	1287020	I'm going to buy both.
1287020	1289820	Um, and that's just the way it is.
1289820	1294820	But uh, I, there, there's a certain like underdog element and you know, this is, this is Phil
1294820	1299900	Spencer's time as opposed to, you know, Don Matrick who kind of screwed the Xbox one right
1299900	1300900	out the gate.
1300900	1305420	Like I, I'm really just excited to see like what it is and how they're going to get that
1305420	1306420	messaging across.
1306420	1309860	And I'm, I'm kind of really excited about it to be honest.
1310140	1313540	I still don't know what their exclusives are though between the different platforms.
1313540	1318100	So that's why right now I like having a hard time making decisions because like, I don't
1318100	1319100	know what they're offering.
1319100	1321180	Like they keep saying, Oh, our hardware is more powerful.
1321180	1323020	I mean, every company is going to say that.
1323020	1328260	So like I need to see what the games are and I, I'm not clear, like especially after that
1328260	1333500	last event that Sony had, like I'm not clear what games they're offering, it was all third
1333500	1334500	party stuff.
1334500	1337940	And like, yeah, Assassin's Creed is going to be on both platforms and I don't care about
1337940	1339100	that game anyways.
1339100	1345980	Um, I just don't know third party wise, like I, I would lean a little bit towards Sony
1345980	1351900	just because I have a huge library of stuff on there, but I mean, with Game Pass, it doesn't
1351900	1352900	matter anyway.
1352900	1357420	So like, I have to see, I have to see what they have to offer like exclusive wise.
1357420	1361420	Cause that's really kind of what drives me to one console or the other.
1361420	1365660	If Sony would really go big on the backwards compatibility thing, I would be so happy.
1365660	1369460	And I know people are like, why do you need a new console to play old games?
1369460	1371700	Because I ran out of shelf space for the old consoles.
1371700	1373460	The old consoles get dusty and die.
1373460	1376780	I don't even know where the fricking cords are for my old consoles at some point.
1376780	1379020	Like it's kind of nice to have it all in one.
1379020	1382220	And I gotta be honest, if Sony does open up and say, guess what?
1382220	1385500	All those PlayStation two and three and one games that have been sitting on your shelf,
1385500	1386700	now they have value again.
1386700	1387700	You can play them on your phone.
1387700	1389740	I'll be so excited to be honest.
1389740	1390740	So we'll see.
1390740	1391740	We'll see.
1391740	1395140	Especially when Matt says we won't notice a difference between a console power for a
1395140	1396140	few years.
1396140	1399220	And by then studios will be able to use the console to its full potential.
1399220	1402620	We're never going to know which console is better anyways, because what's going to happen,
1402620	1407420	especially when it comes to mainline games that are multi-platform, they're going to
1407420	1409100	keep them in parity with each other.
1409100	1412100	You're not going to have one that's like vastly different than the other one.
1412100	1415500	It's going to be first party titles that would be showing that stuff off.
1415500	1419340	And honestly, I don't think it's going to be like night and day between these different
1419340	1420340	consoles.
1420340	1425380	I don't think it's just all hype and, you know, advertised speak.
1425380	1430420	I think that's a very important point is that technical power does not mean what it used
1430420	1431500	to mean.
1431500	1435600	Case in point, Nintendo, I rest my case.
1435600	1440220	Like Nintendo has the weakest console out there from a technological, although some
1440220	1444540	would argue the technological marvel of the dock and take it off the dock is a pretty
1444540	1447640	big feather in the hat, but you guys know what I mean, right?
1447640	1450720	Basically the switch is going to be the least powerful thing on the market, but does it
1450720	1451720	matter?
1451720	1455540	No, it absolutely doesn't matter because they have animal crossing.
1455540	1458320	They have a Metroid game coming out in the future.
1458320	1462860	They likely are doing another Mario game this holiday of some form or another.
1462860	1463960	It's not going to matter.
1463960	1469840	So like, you know, whereas back in the day when it was, you know, super Nintendo or Nintendo
1469840	1474920	64 on a cartridge versus PlayStation on a disc versus Dreamcast, you know, all the,
1474920	1479840	all this stuff going on, like the technological end of it doesn't matter anymore.
1479840	1482480	If that makes sense.
1482480	1484840	So yeah, that makes sense.
1484840	1491240	Phoenix 7726 in chat says, Rob, power has never meant the same thing to Nintendo, even
1491240	1493680	when they are on the edge during the GameCube era.
1493680	1495840	Yeah, that's a brilliant point.
1495840	1500280	The GameCube was probably the closest they ever got to kind of being on par with the
1500280	1502880	other consoles that were available at the time.
1502880	1507960	But even then they, their online was so weak compared to the competition.
1507960	1511560	The thing that's going to hurt them though, power wise, I mean, I get it, the Switch is
1511560	1512800	an okay system.
1512800	1518720	It's just that when you're looking at third party titles, you're going to have, the Switch
1518720	1522080	is not going to be able to run a lot of these modern engines on it.
1522080	1526760	It's not without them massively altering those games.
1526760	1531020	That's why you see a lot of these older games being ported to the Switch, which is fine.
1531020	1535700	But you're not going to see Cyberpunk running on the Switch or something like that.
1535700	1539700	It's going to be very much separate in that sense.
1539700	1541900	Same with Madden or anything like that.
1541900	1545740	These next gen Madden games, they're going to have, it all is going to be porting that
1545740	1551460	old version of Madden onto the Switch over and over and over again with a roster update.
1551460	1557140	Counterpoint though, because Microsoft is still developing for the Xbox One.
1557140	1559780	Everything that is being developed is going to run on the Xbox One.
1559780	1565380	So that being said, it's not going to be as difficult, I mean, I say that like I have
1565380	1569740	any technical knowledge of programming a game whatsoever, but I think that bridge would
1569740	1574780	be a lot less strenuous to cross from Xbox One to Switch than it would be from PlayStation
1574780	1576340	5 and Xbox Series X.
1576340	1580920	And we know for a couple of years, Microsoft is still going to be supporting Xbox One.
1580920	1583740	Third party could be a different story, I understand that.
1583740	1589740	But I think that bridge is not as monumental as it might have felt before, especially with
1589740	1592060	the way the Switch is sold.
1592060	1595980	It's motivating third party developers to kind of keep it in mind when they develop.
1595980	1601140	Now in a couple years when Microsoft finally decides to leave the Xbox One behind, I think
1601140	1605620	that's when the conversations will start really about what is the Switch's successor, which
1605620	1608260	I full on just expect to be a Switch 2.0.
1608260	1613460	I don't see Nintendo leaving this formula behind at all, like it's going to be another
1613460	1620500	portable and a desktop, I don't know, a living room system, Nintendo's not going to leave
1620500	1621500	that behind.
1621500	1623300	It's been too damn successful this time around.
1623300	1624300	So.
1624300	1625300	Yeah.
1625300	1626300	All right.
1626300	1632180	I just, I think there's just a lot of even stuff with the current generation of consoles
1632180	1636100	that doesn't come to the Switch because it can't run that stuff.
1636100	1639380	Although now it's going to be running Crysis, so I guess anything's possible.
1639700	1643540	S2-100 Matt in chat says, Loki going after sports games again.
1643540	1644580	But he's right.
1644580	1650220	The last year or two of sports games on an expiring consoles are just really sad ports.
1650220	1652740	That's what they've been the last few years already on the Switch.
1652740	1653740	Nothing's going to change.
1653740	1654740	Nothing.
1654740	1658220	All of a sudden them making a brand new engine that runs on next generation of consoles doesn't
1658220	1660300	mean all of a sudden they're going to port it to.
1660300	1661300	It's not going to happen.
1661300	1665020	But that's up to the third parties to do better in some regard too, because Nintendo is doing
1665020	1666020	great.
1666020	1667020	All right.
1667020	1668340	Anyway, let's move on.
1668340	1670820	Let's talk about the types of games we've been playing this week, whether it's been
1670820	1674860	on our Switch, our computer, our Xbox, PlayStation, whatever.
1674860	1675860	How was your gaming week?
1675860	1677260	And we'll start with Dark Sakura.
1677260	1679820	How was your gaming week?
1679820	1680820	It was all right.
1680820	1684300	I played a lot of Animal Crossing.
1684300	1687300	Dan's been playing Bloodstained.
1687300	1693140	He's actually been playing both Curse of the Moon 2 and then the regular Bloodstained.
1693140	1696180	I've been playing this stupid game that I'm kind of hooked on.
1696180	1700420	And it's one of those like free with ads stupid games, but the ads aren't very long on it.
1700420	1705380	And it's if people can see, it looks like it's like this where you have you get like
1705380	1706380	letters.
1706380	1707380	Okay.
1707380	1711420	For the podcast, folks, it looks like a word for words with friends, but with a spinny
1711420	1712420	dial thing.
1712420	1715500	It's the word wheel mode from words with friends is what it is.
1715500	1716500	Okay.
1716500	1720020	And so, of course, you know, you have to build the words on it.
1720020	1723660	And me, like on this one, I've guessed three of the words on the puzzle and I've done thirty
1723660	1725540	three other words.
1725540	1730860	The last one I did was like nine words and I guessed seventy.
1730860	1732420	So yeah.
1732420	1733420	And they were all real words.
1733420	1738380	So I'm like, yeah, this game isn't for people who actually have a vocabulary.
1738380	1739380	It's been pretty fun.
1739380	1743860	I'm still playing words with friends and I haven't really gotten to much of The Last
1743860	1746580	of Us this week just because other things are going on.
1746580	1754020	But I this upcoming week isn't going to be much better because I get my new desk and
1754020	1755940	I have to set up my office and everything.
1755940	1763140	So this all of this behind me is going to be different, hopefully the next time I'm
1763140	1765140	on the show.
1765140	1766140	Awesome.
1766140	1768940	But in other news, next week is my last half show.
1768940	1773900	I go back to my old schedule and you get me for a full show.
1773900	1778580	I'm glad the warden's giving you a pardon so we can have y'all show.
1778580	1779580	Good to know.
1779580	1782420	I don't know how I feel about closing again, though.
1782420	1787220	I've kind of gotten used to my quiet six a.m., but it is what it is.
1787220	1788220	Yeah.
1788220	1789220	You'll do fine.
1789220	1790220	All right.
1790220	1794460	Well, if that's it for your gaming week, we'll move to Loki, who clearly Minecraft was part
1794460	1795460	of his week.
1795460	1796460	Yes.
1796460	1797860	I'm always playing Minecraft.
1797860	1801140	So I played lots of Minecraft.
1801140	1803660	And aside from that, Orna.
1803660	1810860	And then also I did finally get the switch to play a little bit of Paper Mario, the Origami
1810860	1811860	King.
1812300	1813300	So that was pretty awesome.
1813300	1815100	I'm enjoying that quite a bit.
1815100	1818540	So just not too far into it.
1818540	1822620	I'm not too like the first big boss yet, but I played like three hours of it.
1822620	1823620	That's pretty good.
1825620	1826620	So that's pretty much it.
1826620	1827620	OK.
1827620	1828620	All right.
1828620	1829620	My gaming week.
1829620	1830620	I have a lot to talk about, actually.
1830620	1833180	So there's all the usuals, right?
1833180	1834820	Like, you know, Pokemon Go.
1834820	1839340	I got like 11 shinies during community day catching for my Bluetooth, you know, whatever.
1839340	1841340	But I got a 100 percent Gastly.
1841340	1845740	And those are more exciting to me when you get a perfect 100 percent because they give
1845740	1848300	out shinies like candy on community day, I swear.
1848300	1849380	But yeah.
1849380	1851300	So I participated in that Gomi.
1851300	1853580	I'm still playing Orna a bit.
1853580	1856660	And this was a week where I was kind of like, I'm going to tackle some games that have just
1856660	1861700	been sitting in my backlog or, you know, just play something random on Xbox Game Pass.
1861700	1863580	So I played on Xbox Game Pass.
1863580	1866280	They just added a game called Forager.
1866280	1869900	And Loki, this might be something that's up your alley because it is very Minecrafty,
1869900	1872300	especially when it comes to the crafting in the game.
1872300	1878420	But the graphics look a little more like honestly to me, they're almost like a Binding of Isaac
1878420	1881360	style graphics, although the game is nothing like Binding of Isaac.
1881360	1885180	It's more Minecraft, but it's 2D.
1885180	1888380	And you know, you're going around, you mind these different things.
1888380	1893940	You have things that you build like a forage and you do other things like a thread, a loom,
1893940	1894940	things like that.
1894940	1899640	You're kind of crafting and then you expand your land through money and you're crafting
1899640	1901140	money as well.
1901140	1904120	And so it's an interesting kind of 2D Minecraft.
1904120	1906400	We've seen these types of games before.
1906400	1912000	Maybe Don't Starve would be another good comparison, although I feel like Forager was like really,
1912000	1913000	really dumbed down.
1913000	1914300	And that's a good thing.
1914300	1917260	I think that's an okay thing to be sometimes.
1917260	1919540	Sometimes being a simpler game gives you an edge.
1919540	1921260	That's why I love Heroes of the Storm.
1921260	1925660	It's like League of Legends, but it's dumbed down and that's not a bad thing.
1925660	1928620	So Forager is pretty cool in that regard.
1929620	1933200	I wish it had a little bit more robust of a tutorial.
1933200	1938440	Like sometimes the little dude will tell you like what to do, but I was kind of having
1938440	1942540	a hard time figuring out like, am I doing this the right way?
1942540	1945600	Am I eating the right things I'm supposed to be eating?
1945600	1948680	Because this seems very difficult and I'm running out of life very often.
1948680	1950840	I guess maybe I need to build more fish traps.
1950840	1952280	I don't know.
1952280	1955560	That type of discovery might be a plus for some people, though.
1955620	1958740	I like to be handheld just a little bit more in the beginning of the game.
1958740	1962220	But that's really just my it's a minor piece of feedback, all things considered.
1962220	1963940	I think the game is fun.
1963940	1964940	It's interesting.
1964940	1968860	And I feel like it moves at a faster pace than Minecraft, too, which I kind of like.
1968860	1972380	So yeah, that's cool.
1972380	1977420	Some other games I've been playing, Epic Games Store, I'm like, you know, I've been collecting
1977420	1978860	all these free games.
1978860	1980900	I'm going to play some free games.
1980900	1985540	So I played one called Lifeless Planet that I think came out a couple or excuse me, was
1985540	1987440	a free game a couple weeks ago.
1987440	1991880	I think the game itself dates back to like 2014 or something like that.
1991880	1995120	And I thought it might be kind of like a No Man's Sky type of game, because that was the
1995120	1997880	vibe that a lot of the screenshots were giving me.
1997880	2000460	It's not quite that open world.
2000460	2002880	It's a little more platformy.
2002880	2007160	I would almost call it a little bit more like an old school Tomb Raider type of thing is
2007160	2010400	honestly how it kind of felt to me with some of the puzzles where it's like, oh, I got
2010400	2015080	to take a ball and roll the ball over to this cliff so I can jump on the ball and jet pack
2015080	2016780	up here and do these types of things.
2016780	2019620	It has kind of an interesting story to it too.
2019620	2021500	It was okay.
2021500	2025100	I thought the game kind of wasn't what I expected it would be.
2025100	2028880	Like I thought a game like Lifeless Planet would be very much about exploration and kind
2028880	2030300	of open worldness.
2030300	2032000	And that's not really what this is at all.
2032000	2033140	But that doesn't make it bad.
2033140	2035160	It's just it wasn't what I expected.
2035160	2036160	So there you go.
2036160	2039440	Now you can set your expectations appropriately if you ever play this game, which I got on
2039440	2040980	Epic Games Store a while ago.
2040980	2044120	And it's, you know, again, many of you guys probably picked it up for free.
2044120	2045120	It's worth a look.
2045120	2046120	It's pretty neat.
2046120	2048060	I also played a game.
2048060	2050600	Oh, everybody knows this game, Celeste.
2050600	2053000	I finally got around to playing Celeste.
2053000	2055920	Finally got around to playing Celeste this week.
2055920	2061480	And because that was on Epic Games Store at some point that that game is hard as hell.
2061480	2063560	My God.
2063560	2064740	But it's it's fun.
2064740	2065740	It's it.
2065740	2070360	It it has like to me it has like a Super Meat Boy vibe kind of going with it.
2070360	2073120	And that's kind of what it reminds me of closest.
2073120	2075260	But the soundtrack's really good.
2075260	2079520	And I like how I like it.
2079520	2080520	I don't like it.
2080520	2081520	I like it.
2081520	2084880	How there's these like these little strawberries that very clearly are things you're supposed
2084880	2087460	to be collecting that are like dangled in front of you.
2087460	2089040	But they're hard as hell to get.
2089040	2092840	And like I can get them sometimes, but other times, no, can't do it.
2092840	2094560	And I just have to move on.
2094560	2095560	And then sometimes there's choices.
2095560	2096680	Do I go left or right?
2096680	2097680	And I don't know.
2097680	2100200	Like, I thought games like this only had one path.
2100200	2102100	But no, there's there's multiple ways to get there.
2102100	2105220	So that's kind of interesting where it's like a Super Meat Boy S type of game.
2105220	2107820	But there's multiple ways to kind of get to the finish.
2107820	2111300	So yeah, I thought that was interesting.
2111300	2113580	Some comments in chat on these games.
2113580	2115620	Act Def says Celeste is so awesome.
2115620	2117680	It's hard, but it's so rewarding.
2117680	2119540	And the story is great.
2119540	2122620	And Pele Hanumeya talking about Lifeless Planet was interesting to play.
2122620	2123620	Yeah, it's interesting.
2123620	2126400	The story is kind of kind of not what I expected it to be at all.
2126400	2130300	But it's very narrative, but it's good.
2130300	2131300	And let's see.
2131500	2135300	I think that's about like my newer games I was playing and catching up.
2135300	2141600	Okay, so I mentioned on Twitter that like, I have found this new thing in one of my games
2141600	2145000	that I play a lot that I really enjoy.
2145000	2147420	Some of you might find it a little weird.
2147420	2151300	And that's why I'm going to talk about it openly and publicly on this show that I do.
2151300	2156600	So obviously, you guys know I play a lot of a game called Ingress, right?
2156600	2163000	So something they just recently did in Ingress is they released something called portal scanning.
2163000	2166360	And what portal scanning is, is quite simply all you're doing, you're taking like a, you
2166360	2172120	take your camera, and you walk around like a portal basically where it is, and you're
2172120	2179120	taking a 3D scan of that portal for Niantic's database to be used in some other game down
2179120	2180120	the road.
2180120	2183480	Now this same feature is in Pokemon Go.
2183480	2186000	But it's, I think it's a little more, it's Pokestop scanning.
2186000	2188840	I think it's a little more hidden, and they don't give you any rewards for it.
2188840	2191100	There's like no reason to do it in Pokemon Go.
2191100	2194680	So I doubt any of you are except maybe the curiosity factor.
2194680	2198400	But in Ingress, they have some little badges, you know, little achievements that you can
2198400	2199960	get from doing these things.
2199960	2203120	And so that kind of motivated me to start taking a look, I was like, well, at least
2203120	2207160	I can do this bronze level, you know, achievement and do this.
2207160	2211080	And they ended so they did one badge for scanning portals.
2211080	2214840	But then they released a second badge called scout controller.
2214840	2216880	This is very different than Pokemon.
2216880	2223920	And what scout controller is, is that scout controller is for uniques, basically, like,
2223920	2229800	if you have more portal scans than anybody else on a portal, then you are the scout controller
2229800	2230800	for 30 days.
2230800	2234180	Now, if somebody comes and scans more than you, they'll take it away from you.
2234180	2237600	But you've already stamped that as a unique scout controller claim.
2237600	2239880	So it goes towards your badge.
2239880	2243440	So this added up to and there's there's a point I'm getting to here.
2243440	2250800	This added up to me trying to find portal dense areas to just scan a lot of things.
2250800	2253320	And so I could work on my controller badge really fast.
2253320	2258680	I'm already up to I got the bronze level, I'm past 100 I'm up to about 150 unique portals
2258680	2264360	because I've been going to dense areas, parks, I found I was scanning at parks.
2264360	2267360	But right now there's a lot of kids at parks.
2267360	2272780	There's a lot of asshole teenagers at parks, because people you know, there's not a lot
2272780	2275560	to do in quarantine right now, but go outside and go to parks.
2275560	2280100	So it's hard for me to be like, I'm going to take out my phone and like, pretend like
2280100	2282060	I'm not taking pictures of your kid.
2282060	2283060	I promise.
2283060	2284060	I'm taking pictures.
2284060	2285400	It's too weird for me.
2285400	2287380	And I don't want to go there.
2287380	2293220	So where do you think the portal dense area is that I found where I don't get bothered
2293220	2298940	by anybody and graveyards graveyards that is exactly right.
2298940	2304460	And so let me actually roll some b roll of me doing a portal scan at a graveyard at a
2304460	2306140	graveyard.
2306140	2311380	And I gotta tell you, you know, what's fun about it is that the location doesn't so you
2311380	2314420	can see you're in the in sorry, I haven't narrated for the podcast.
2314420	2317460	You can see I see where the let me let me actually start.
2317460	2320100	I'm sorry, I was a bad narrator, I'm gonna start the b roll again.
2320100	2325020	So you see, it shows me a picture of what the grave looks like and the name on it.
2325020	2326720	I've got to find it.
2326720	2329200	And the location isn't always accurate.
2329200	2332960	And that's the fun part is that kind of have to play Where's Waldo a little bit.
2332960	2338420	So now in the video, okay, I found the portal, I found the grave marker that was in the picture.
2338420	2340120	And so I start to actually scan.
2340120	2342480	So this is me walking around the portal.
2342480	2345560	And you see it actually kind of nevermind the Pokemon Go messages, because that's me
2345560	2347280	catching via Bluetooth.
2347280	2351520	But I walk around the portal best I can, although obviously, I'm not going to walk up, I'm not
2351520	2355120	going to be disrespectful to the graveyard itself.
2355120	2358960	So I do the best that I can, and then it actually encodes it.
2358960	2363200	And then it sends the data to Niantic, so that Pikachu can pop out of that gravestone
2363200	2366640	at some point in Pokemon Go, I imagine.
2366640	2369960	So you see it actually like replays it to you, it shows a little scan that I took.
2369960	2371840	And there it goes, I do upload later.
2371840	2375840	And then I actually upload those scans when I get home at some point later on.
2375840	2378800	So that's, that's basically what it looks like.
2378800	2384640	So again, the fun part is, I'm having to use clues in the picture because graveyards, right,
2384640	2386120	there's tons of gravestones.
2386120	2389000	But you want to make sure you're scanning the right thing, right?
2389000	2391660	So I have to use clues like in the picture.
2391660	2393140	What is the grave shape like?
2393140	2394640	Does it have a cross on top of it?
2394640	2397680	Or does it have like a, some of them have a drapery?
2397680	2398880	Does it have a torch?
2398880	2400340	Like what like things are on it?
2400340	2401340	What color is it?
2401340	2407080	I see a tree in the background, because again, the location is not always accurate in a graveyard.
2407080	2414040	People like submit it like close, but it's very hard in Niantic system with Pokemon Go
2414040	2418200	and Ingress, like you see a satellite view of where the portal is supposed to be.
2418200	2422980	You can't, you can't find that unless it's one of those giant tombs, which sometimes
2422980	2425540	there's that as well.
2425540	2427000	It's very hard to find that on satellite view.
2427000	2428740	So a lot of these things are in the wrong place.
2428740	2433680	So yeah, that's, that's, and I had a lot of fun doing that today.
2433680	2438160	And now I'm like, oh, I want to go to all these other places and scan too, because they're
2438160	2440200	the best things to scan.
2440200	2443520	Like you know, when you're scanning like plaques on a wall and stuff, they're not very interesting.
2443520	2446800	They don't really have a lot of shape to them, but gravestones are like kind of awesome
2446800	2447800	for that.
2447800	2452000	And again, nobody fucking bothers me at a graveyard at all.
2452000	2453000	It's great.
2453000	2457000	I saw one other person there today and I'm pretty sure they were taking the gyms in Pokemon
2457000	2459080	Go is what they were doing.
2459080	2462840	It was also, and I, you know, and as weird as y'all might think it is or whatever, like
2462840	2467960	I'm completely respectful when I just, I make sure I'm not walking in places that feel disrespectful.
2467960	2469720	I don't make noise.
2469720	2474120	I don't, you know, I don't jump on things quite honestly.
2474120	2478280	And one thing I found through this, because games like Pokemon Go and Ingress and all
2478280	2482400	these Niantic things and several games are also about exploring your community, right?
2482400	2484120	That's a big thing that they've always pitched, right?
2484120	2485120	Right?
2485120	2486840	Loki is like, explore your community, get to your community.
2486840	2491520	You know, one thing I learned, this graveyard sucks at upkeep.
2491520	2493760	And I was actually kind of distressed about it.
2493800	2499960	I was like, if my relative was buried at the cemetery, I would be so upset by the state
2499960	2500960	of this.
2500960	2503200	All of the, none of the grass had been kept.
2503200	2504640	It was all dead.
2504640	2507780	California hasn't been in a drought for a couple of years, so I don't know what their
2507780	2509280	excuse is on that front.
2509280	2510920	They get at least water at once in a while.
2510920	2512360	So all the grass was dead.
2512360	2517760	I saw tombs that were completely like, like had fallen over just out of like disrepair.
2517760	2521180	There was one, I put a picture on my Instagram that was just like something that had fallen
2521180	2522180	over into three pieces.
2522380	2525220	And I was like, what if this was my relative?
2525220	2528140	This is, this is distressful.
2528140	2534340	So there's almost a part of me that's like, this game might turn me into an activist of
2534340	2539440	some sort where I'm like, y'all need to, y'all are paying good money for, you know, this
2539440	2544620	type of care and to memorialize your relatives and so forth.
2544620	2550340	And I bet if some people saw the state of disrepair this place was in, they'd be shocked.
2550340	2551340	So I don't know.
2551500	2554340	I could just start an Instagram or a Yelp or something like that.
2554340	2555340	I don't know.
2555340	2560260	So Bobby Blackwolf in chat says the undertaker would take care of that graveyard.
2560260	2561260	Yeah.
2561260	2563380	Bobby Blackwolf says Rob has 5G.
2563380	2564380	Okay.
2564380	2566620	But that's, that's the fake 5G.
2566620	2568580	That's the, it's look very carefully.
2568580	2570920	It's 5GE.
2570920	2572740	That's my AT&T 5G.
2572740	2573740	Okay.
2573740	2575260	It's, it's very different.
2575260	2579900	It's not, not actual 5G.
2579900	2580900	Let's see.
2581460	2582460	Let's see some comments in chat here.
2582460	2585660	Quest Buster says Rob is going to end up on the 11 o'clock news as part of the graveyard
2585660	2586660	hoard story.
2586660	2587660	I don't know.
2587660	2591660	Phoenix 7726 says, so Pikachu's a grave digger.
2591660	2592660	LOL.
2592660	2598420	I mean, that's what, I assume it's for Pokemon Go and some type of AR feature, but we also
2598420	2600860	know Niantic's working on Catan.
2600860	2606660	I don't know what type of AR stuff would be in Catan, but at the same time I would have
2606660	2610400	never foresaw what AR stuff would have been in Pokemon.
2610400	2611400	So who knows?
2611400	2614860	Maybe when you build things in Catan, cause that is Niantic's next game, that's, that's
2614860	2618560	out there and you can sign up for the beta now.
2618560	2619560	I don't know.
2619560	2620880	They might implement it in their Harry Potter game.
2620880	2621880	I keep forgetting.
2621880	2623560	I kind of stopped on Harry Potter, Wizards Unite.
2623560	2628960	I just, I, I think that that's Orna's fault because I have found the maximum number of
2628960	2630960	those games I can play at once is three.
2630960	2634960	I cannot play more than three GPS games at once.
2634960	2636080	So I finally left.
2636080	2641560	So Wizards Unite by the wayside and I don't know, maybe the traces will do something with
2641560	2642560	the AR.
2642560	2643560	I don't know.
2643560	2644560	So interesting.
2644560	2649840	Anyway, so yeah, that's, that's my interesting new obsession is I'm scanning graveyards.
2649840	2651060	It's good exercise.
2651060	2653120	I get my steps in.
2653120	2658200	There's no children running around acting crazy and no parents going like, why is that
2658200	2661480	creepy dude with his phone trying to take pictures of my kid?
2661480	2665680	I would much rather somebody just be like, why is that dude taking pictures in a graveyard?
2665680	2669720	Because honestly, I think there's a lot of people, graveyards are, graveyards are meant
2669720	2670880	to be good looking.
2670880	2672200	They're meant to be beautiful.
2672200	2674840	They're meant to be eternal resting spots of sorts.
2674840	2678400	That's why I was so irritated with this one I went to today and the state of disrepair
2678400	2679400	it was in.
2679400	2682720	I was like, if I was buried here, I'd be so mad.
2682720	2686160	And I don't think what I'm doing is disrespectful either.
2686160	2692240	Like it's, it's a way to memorialize or if, if I pass away, you guys suddenly and unexpectedly,
2692240	2694800	I know this is a morbid thing to talk about, but I should talk about it.
2695160	2701280	If I should pass away unexpectedly and quickly, absolutely, I want to become a Pokestop and
2701280	2702280	a portal.
2702280	2709360	So whether it's a bench with my name on it or whatever, absolutely, that is how I want
2709360	2710360	to be remembered.
2710360	2712400	So, all right.
2712400	2717820	Phoenix 7726 in chat says, Rob, are you going, Rob, are you going through an elder emo phase
2717820	2718820	of sorts?
2718820	2720820	I mean, I was always a little emo.
2720820	2723440	And actdeft in chat says, you're not wrong, Rob at all.
2723440	2724440	No, thank you.
2724580	2725580	Thank you.
2725580	2726580	That's my favorite phrase.
2726580	2727580	All right.
2727580	2729360	Anyway, enough of my gaming week.
2729360	2731200	I just had to talk about that a little bit.
2731200	2736840	Let's actually get into some gaming news and some other things that have happened around
2736840	2738000	the gaming world this week.
2738000	2741240	Sorry, I'm reading some more comments in chat.
2741240	2745600	Chronos Ode in chat says, cemeteries are some of my favorite places to go for peace and
2745600	2746600	quiet.
2746600	2747720	Exactly that.
2747720	2749480	Like people don't bother me.
2749480	2750800	They don't look at me funny.
2750800	2753320	Like everybody's kind of minding their own business.
2753320	2756200	I used to have picnics in cemeteries.
2756200	2758520	That's and you know what we would do?
2758520	2761560	We would do gravestone rubbings with chalk and paper.
2761560	2763160	Oh, that's pretty cool.
2763160	2764600	Yeah, that's really neat.
2764600	2766760	I mean, I'm a kid.
2766760	2767760	Yeah.
2767760	2771960	I mean, and I don't again, I don't think it's I don't find myself being disrespectful.
2771960	2776560	I mean, if I was making noise and screaming and dancing and knocking things over like
2776560	2779360	somebody clearly did in this place, there's a graffiti too.
2779360	2780360	I would.
2780360	2781360	That's that.
2781360	2782360	I don't.
2782360	2783360	But I don't do that stuff.
2783360	2784960	Um, let's see.
2784960	2788480	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, put on your tombstone, dear resistance.
2788480	2789960	Keep this portal.
2789960	2792320	Hell no.
2792320	2793320	Forever green.
2793320	2794320	All right.
2794320	2797880	Anyway, I suppose there's some people on resistance I like.
2797880	2800680	And I suppose if they wanted to visit once in a while, they could.
2800680	2801720	But this is very morbid.
2801720	2802720	So let's move on.
2802720	2805520	Let's talk about what's going on in gaming news around the industry.
2805520	2807800	So Loki, we'll start with you.
2807800	2808800	Yes.
2809240	2815040	So there is a very exciting new Lego set that's been announced that is going to celebrate
2815040	2818480	the 30th anniversary of the Nintendo Entertainment System.
2818480	2822120	And it is a Lego Nintendo Enter entertainment system.
2822120	2827340	So not only do you get the console, you get a controller, you get the Super Mario Brothers
2827340	2832560	game cartridge, which actually does plug into the console itself, but also a retro style
2832560	2837900	TV with a crank that moves a little scene in there that you can actually move Mario
2837900	2839980	up and down on as well.
2839980	2846100	And then, of course, if you have the starter kit for the new Super Mario Brothers Lego
2846100	2850440	sets, then you can plug that in on top and it'll play the Mario Brothers theme music
2850440	2851440	as well.
2851440	2853700	So it's coming out August 1st.
2853700	2857980	It's going to run two hundred and thirty dollars.
2857980	2859300	But wow, does it look amazing?
2859300	2866380	Yeah, I got to say this is I mean, the fact that it's a Nintendo set is cool, but even
2866380	2872020	if it wasn't Nintendo, this is probably one of the most badass Lego things I've ever seen.
2872020	2875140	Like this is next level.
2875140	2880180	But I can't with that price tag, I can't like not not for me, but I'm also I'm not the Lego
2880180	2881500	affectionate.
2881500	2883780	Some of the rest of y'all are low key.
2883780	2888220	So have you or did you drop the money on it or trying to?
2888220	2891820	Well, they don't they don't always for your other sets.
2891820	2892820	Oh, right.
2892820	2893820	Yeah.
2893820	2895220	You have to wait.
2895220	2900300	Bobby Black Wolf and Chad says, I'm getting this even at that price, not a scalper price,
2900300	2901300	though.
2901300	2905660	So I'm with you on that and I would never pay a scalper for it.
2905660	2909300	I was just about to ask you because you guys do some Lego collecting, right?
2909300	2911060	Just not a ton, right?
2911060	2912940	We do.
2912940	2920180	We we actually have like two Back to the Future sets, the DeLorean and two Ecto ones.
2920180	2922460	And I would really want this one.
2922460	2926220	But then again, we do have other things that we need to do.
2926220	2929380	So anyone want to buy a house for selling one?
2929380	2931380	Oh, actually, yes.
2931380	2935100	You want to live in a retirement community?
2935100	2936980	No, that no, I don't.
2936980	2937980	OK.
2937980	2938980	Yeah.
2938980	2944220	But it's funny to say that, though, you know, I really you know, we really are about to
2944220	2945220	start those conversations.
2945220	2946220	Right.
2946220	2948060	So we may have to talk.
2948060	2949060	Yeah.
2949060	2951140	But the other kind of funny thing with all that is.
2951140	2955580	OK, so so Bobby Black over the chat is I'm willing to pay 230 for it, not any higher
2955580	2956580	as to 100.
2956580	2958460	Matt says 250 was my max for it.
2958460	2959460	Thankfully, it was lower.
2959460	2962380	So you guys say that two thirty to fifty with Lego sets.
2962380	2968060	And my mind goes, I could get another arcade one up cabinet for 200 bucks, dude.
2968060	2972900	I'm telling you, I Placerville.
2972900	2978140	Has Pacman cabs for fifty dollars, 50, don't they've got a few left.
2978140	2980980	My husband will divorce me if I bring another one of those in this house.
2980980	2983780	I've been just sitting there.
2983780	2985700	I still want the Star Wars one.
2985700	2988700	Those are still in Roseville.
2988700	2991860	I'm going to be sending hubby on an errand.
2991860	2997380	Yeah, but that's the thing that was like like I don't like Pacman that much.
2997380	2999740	And so I'm like, no, I can't do that.
2999740	3002060	That's like that's the one you hack in it.
3002060	3006020	That's because surely, surely somebody's figured out how to hack one of those cabinets.
3006020	3007020	No, they already have.
3007060	3008420	I mean, they have tons of stuff.
3008420	3009900	There's a whole marketplace for that stuff.
3009900	3016300	But I would like something that's less that, you know, less that you need to modify to it.
3016300	3020540	Like, for example, a street fighter cab where it has six buttons for each player.
3020540	3026900	I mean, that would be ideal or like a the Ninja Turtles one would be pretty cool, too.
3026900	3028780	But those are still full price.
3028780	3031420	Wait, oh, wait.
3031420	3034380	I mean, at one time at one time, it's ridiculous.
3034420	3039420	At one time, the asteroid caps, they were clearing them out at a dollar, one dollar.
3040940	3045260	Like, how I don't understand what happens, didn't get snatched up by the employees.
3045860	3048060	I'm so upset because it's a space thing.
3048060	3052380	They do take up a bit of space like you can, you know, and they're not they're not for
3052380	3053500	every type of living space.
3053500	3055300	I don't even like having one in a rental.
3055500	3056300	I could imagine.
3056300	3059820	Loki, back when this show started, you and I used to live in an apartment.
3060060	3061540	You know what I was about to say?
3061900	3064260	Could you imagine us having one of those machines in the house?
3064260	3069860	But then I remember in that apartment, you had that fucking arcade cabinet that you
3069860	3071820	built in that apartment.
3072780	3074220	That thing was gigantic.
3074220	3075900	Oh, God, I wish I had a picture of it.
3076380	3078100	That's that's an ultimate.
3078100	3079900	It's an Ultimark arcade.
3080860	3082780	I think that's what the brand was.
3082780	3083740	The design was.
3083980	3086980	But yeah, it was a four player and you like players.
3087220	3089460	Wasn't our television in that cabinet?
3090180	3091860	Yes, the television was in the cabinet.
3091860	3092360	Yes.
3092960	3097160	I remember playing Dracula X on that thing, hooked up the TurboGrafx.
3098080	3098680	It's funny.
3099960	3107120	All right, anyway, all our collections and what they do to us, let's move on.
3107320	3110200	Let's talk about Cyberpunk 2077.
3110200	3112360	Some updates on that game this week.
3112760	3114080	Obviously, the game didn't come out.
3114560	3118640	But, you know, there's more interviews and things that are being done that are building
3118640	3121960	more hype for the game and a couple of interesting new features, if you will.
3122600	3123920	Coming out about the game this week.
3123920	3128440	So there was a Polish website, Spider's Web, that actually interviewed some of the
3128440	3134040	folks, lead quest designer in this case for Cyberpunk 2077, talking a little bit
3134040	3138160	about, you know, how the game works and the way you can play through the game.
3138400	3142400	What's interesting in the interview, the lead quest designer said, all the most
3142400	3147600	important choices in the game, all bosses and elite opponents, there is always a way
3147600	3150080	to go without killing anyone.
3150680	3154800	Sometimes aggression and fighting with an opponent is something that cannot be avoided.
3155080	3159800	It is not that you have to take someone's legs or arms, but it is also not so that you
3159800	3161240	can completely avoid the fight.
3161240	3166360	But you are able to fight in such a way that you only neutralize your opponents and thus
3166360	3167240	pass the game.
3167520	3172080	So in other words, if you want to be Batman and not actually kill anybody, that's going
3172080	3173840	to be an option to you in Cyberpunk.
3173840	3177480	I think that's kind of interesting, the kind of like pacifist approach to play the game.
3177800	3183960	And it sounds like it may not be the obvious way to get through the game either.
3184760	3189040	I suppose, spoiler alert, but this game is how many years old at this point?
3189240	3193240	It might be something like Undertale, where the fact that there is a pacifist approach
3193240	3195720	you can take in that game is not necessarily obvious at first.
3195800	3196400	You know what I mean?
3196560	3197520	Those of you that have played it.
3197800	3204080	So it'll be interesting to see what kind of playthroughs with that, especially now that
3204080	3204720	people know.
3205160	3207000	I'm sure there'll be some people that are looking for it.
3207520	3211240	And of course, some people that maybe aren't into the uber violence like myself, I'm not
3211240	3212400	really into uber violence.
3213040	3216280	That might be an interesting approach for me to take, knowing that I don't have to
3216280	3219640	dismember all these heads and things to actually win the game.
3219640	3220440	So that's kind of neat.
3222040	3229120	Also, on a related note with Cyberpunk 2077, also in that same interview, the game is
3229120	3233800	built in such a way where you can actually complete it without necessarily getting
3233800	3235520	through the main quest.
3235960	3240080	A quote on that, we built the cyberpunk structure based on the conclusions we drew
3240080	3240960	from The Witcher 3.
3241240	3245200	The Witcher had the main stem of history and side threads departing from it.
3245200	3247840	And this was our main structure, which we call the ear.
3248240	3253200	So in cyberpunk structure, we have this wheat spike, which serves as its center, the
3253200	3257360	main storyline with different subplots surrounding it, which can be triggered in
3257360	3258280	various ways.
3258520	3261320	Those subplots allow us to do something we've never done before.
3261560	3265400	They change the main plot of the game, and they're doing that in such a way that you
3265400	3269880	may not even finish the main plot, but still finish the game and get a completely
3269880	3273440	different epilogue than the player with a different life path who made different
3273440	3277160	choices, met different characters and form relationships with them.
3277400	3281400	So very interesting type of approach to the game where it sounds like it's going to be
3281400	3285560	very, I mean, there's open world games and then there's like open world games.
3285560	3289320	And this definitely sounds like it's going to be open in all sorts of ways that the
3289320	3292640	main quest isn't even necessarily what you beat to beat the game.
3292640	3294160	And I think that's kind of fascinating in a way.
3294280	3299600	I have to admit, I haven't been like as excited about cyberpunk just because I've
3299600	3302400	kind of chalked it up to it's one of those open world games.
3302400	3304400	I'm just not going to have the four hundred hours to beat.
3304600	3308400	But the more I hear about it, the more I'm kind of like, hmm, that's interesting.
3308400	3310120	I can't. They're doing some things with it.
3310280	3312000	Yeah, I know you're on their day one.
3312000	3313240	I know it, but we'll see.
3313320	3314480	Can't wait. Yeah.
3315040	3318320	All right. Moving on, Dark Sakura, I'm hoping you're still there.
3319320	3321520	And you've got the next story.
3321720	3323600	Yeah, I'm here. I just went off because I
3323600	3326280	don't think anyone wants to watch me eat my dinner.
3326480	3329600	I wish I had a way to turn my camera off because I was sitting here eating, too.
3329800	3333680	And I don't have a thing to take my camera off.
3333680	3335000	Sorry.
3335200	3337480	Well, at any rate,
3337680	3339640	there's also
3339840	3344120	updates on the horizon for PS Now
3344320	3348920	that basically in the form of a Sony patent
3348920	3351920	that was updated that included some different details.
3352120	3355640	So one of those things that they're talking about, the
3355840	3361960	the some of the services for PS Now going on to PS5 to allow older games to offer
3362160	3368680	segments that work as playable demos so they could cut up like different
3368880	3372480	parts of the game and share them with other people so that they can get a feel
3372680	3376600	for how the game is. Of course, there's no details
3376760	3379480	about how exactly that's going to work, but it would be.
3379680	3383240	But it's supposed to go on on PS Now.
3383440	3386000	The other talk is that it could also just
3386200	3390280	be for the sake of clips, but they're talking about it being something playable.
3390480	3395520	The patent description states in one embodiment, a method is provided for
3395720	3400800	creating a playable limited version of a video game and executed by a user of
3401000	3403800	a complete version of a video game.
3404000	3406320	So that's actually kind of cool.
3406480	3409240	Yeah, that would be good.
3409440	3413240	I just think it would be a really great way to to share experiences with people
3413440	3417240	and try to get other people to to get in on some of these games.
3417240	3419320	It definitely would spread the market
3419320	3422080	because I mean, how many times do we lend out demo discs and whatnot?
3422280	3423280	Kind of the same.
3423480	3428280	Yeah, it's it's a real novel approach of kind of taking this idea of like watching
3428280	3431000	a YouTube or a Twitch stream to kind of get a feel of a game.
3431200	3433560	It's really kind of taking that to the next level where it's like,
3433720	3437280	don't just watch this clip of the game, play this clip of the game.
3437480	3440240	I think that's that's a really interesting approach.
3440440	3444560	If that's again, we nothing is official until Sony says it's there.
3444760	3447800	But if that's true, that's that is neat.
3448000	3450160	That's that's a real next generation thing.
3450360	3451600	You can do better. You try it.
3451800	3454040	Yeah, it's well, it's an interesting
3454240	3456880	approach that nobody seems to be interested in in Stadia.
3457080	3461840	So, you know, Stadia's got this thing that will be out.
3461840	3464440	So this is you can play your favorite.
3464640	3466080	You'll be able to play with your favorite
3466280	3469120	creator while the world watches with crowd play.
3469320	3473600	So it means that people, I guess, will watch it live on YouTube.
3473800	3475960	And then you can join in against like
3476160	3481000	creators of the games and play versus on them, like bring about Dead by Daylight
3481200	3485000	and Super Bomberman are online, so I mean, that's cool and all.
3485000	3487400	But what are the odds you're actually going up against the developer?
3487440	3489760	Or are we talking about, like,
3489960	3495160	like essentially like a ghost racer in a game like Mario Kart or something or
3495160	3498560	like one of the developers is the ghost racer and you're playing against them?
3498560	3500560	I don't that makes sense.
3500760	3503640	It does. Or you could be playing with the
3503840	3508480	personal assistant of the second head of the unit.
3508680	3511280	I mean, not that I wouldn't mind playing with a personal assistant or anything.
3511280	3515160	I'm not putting that down, but I mean, I'm just saying it's kind of.
3515360	3516640	It could be anybody.
3516800	3519600	It almost sounds much like the
3519800	3525400	not necessarily demos, like special versions of the games that they put on,
3525600	3531360	like the Nintendo online and the Super Nintendo online.
3531560	3534320	They're little like, yes, so tell of you.
3534520	3536280	Oh, no, no, no, not necessarily that.
3536280	3539080	I'm talking about the ones where it's like, well, it's a safe state.
3539280	3541520	That's at the end of the game with all of this,
3541720	3545640	you know, all of these power ups and go play, you know, or oh, hey,
3545640	3549920	we started the game with like one hundred lives and all these equipment.
3550120	3552640	It's SP. It's the SP games like there's
3552840	3556720	the Kid Icarus SP that just starts you on the last level.
3556920	3562000	Or the Zelda SP that starts you with two hundred fifty five rupees or something
3562000	3563080	like that, I know what you're talking about.
3563280	3566560	Yeah, you're right, it is kind of like that.
3566760	3569920	Interesting, but but you're only getting into though.
3569920	3572720	I mean, it's not like, yeah, you're at the end of the game with all this.
3572720	3574640	It's like, let me send you something
3574840	3579680	from the middle most boring part of the game, because I'm a good friend.
3580120	3581400	Here, do all this farming.
3581600	3586120	Welcome to my life or like a game like Celeste, I think is a good example, too.
3586320	3591600	Like here's see if you can beat this random fucking hard ass room and get
3591800	3594680	the strawberry that, you know, I could do earlier.
3594880	3596040	Here you go. Have fun.
3596240	3597600	That's as pretty neat.
3597600	3600800	I'd be very curious what the limitations are on something like that.
3601000	3604720	But it's it's a real rad idea.
3604920	3606760	I think so. Yeah, I think so, too.
3606960	3610000	All right. I'm looking forward to some of these newer developments.
3610000	3613000	I think the PlayStation stuff is becoming a little bit more exciting to me.
3613200	3615280	Yeah, well, and it's it's these types
3615480	3620040	of things that really start to feel next gen, so to speak.
3620040	3622960	Like, you know, again, from a technological perspective, you know,
3623160	3627360	how many more gigaflops or whatever can we get in the consoles?
3627360	3629360	I think it's really these sorts of ideas
3629400	3633440	that are going to start to feel like, oh, this is this is the next generation
3633640	3636200	of gaming, this is the next generation of sharing.
3636400	3637360	It's participating.
3637560	3640320	You know, it's going to be very interesting.
3641160	3645920	All right. Well, Loki, what are my chances I'll get a PS5?
3646120	3649040	Hopefully better than they would normally be,
3649240	3653800	apparently Sony has been ramping up production ahead of the launch of the
3654000	3658640	console, and they're expecting or at least targeting 10 million consoles made by
3658640	3663040	March 2021, so that would be within their fiscal year.
3664440	3668480	Yeah, I hope that's actually going to happen, and I hope that that means that
3668480	3671000	the console will be easier to get and that we're not going to have to,
3671200	3674200	you know, fight the black markets to get that stuff.
3674400	3676520	I'm thinking that maybe
3676720	3681080	obviously that they're going to want to try to ramp that up just in general,
3681280	3685840	because I think we're still going to be in like a pandemic scenario by the time
3685880	3687760	that stuff rolls around anyways.
3687960	3690920	And a lot of people suck at home, got to have something to do.
3691120	3694560	You know, it makes sense that you want to launch it with as many units as possible.
3694760	3697080	So I hope that's actually going to be the case.
3697280	3700800	And maybe, you know, that the whole COVID-19
3701000	3704040	situation doesn't affect production too much.
3704240	3706840	But we'll have to wait and see, I guess.
3707040	3710360	Or they may be just not going to have a problem selling those consoles because
3710360	3712760	it's going to be too damn expensive and no one's going to buy them.
3712960	3714760	Well, they're not making the consoles in
3714800	3719800	this country and they're not making them in Brazil or what's the other?
3720000	3722360	Is it Russia that's third right now?
3722560	3724360	So it's they're not making them there.
3724560	3728280	So, I mean, COVID, COVID is still a global issue,
3728480	3730320	but other countries have it in control.
3730520	3733320	This is this is it's really a U.S. problem right now.
3733320	3735000	I mean, in Brazil and other countries.
3735200	3736360	But we're number one.
3736560	3737960	Yeah, we're number one.
3738160	3739600	All right. We're winning.
3739800	3741240	It's all this winning I've been told about.
3741440	3743600	So anyway, sorry, we know and we shouldn't
3743800	3748560	make light of what is really horrific, but like in this type of
3748760	3752600	situation, like a morbid sense of humor is the only thing that's carrying me
3752800	3757560	through right now, because otherwise I would just be so upset and angry.
3757760	3758880	So.
3759080	3760400	Anyway,
3761080	3761920	let's see,
3762120	3765440	DJ Rama S talking about Sony versus Microsoft in chat saying,
3765640	3769720	regardless of which console drops first, I'll be getting the Xbox Series X first
3769720	3771920	between backwards compatibility and Game Pass.
3772120	3773320	I'm sold.
3773520	3776440	VG Realness in chat talking a little bit about the last story,
3776440	3779640	although it all ties into PlayStation 5, says at the same time,
3779840	3783640	a feature like that doesn't seem like something that needs a new console to pull
3783840	3787640	off. True, especially because SharePlay is
3787840	3790840	already something that exists on the PlayStation 4.
3791040	3793840	But since they are rebuilding the interface
3794040	3798280	completely for PlayStation 5, I would say there'd be a lot to go
3798280	3803240	with how seamless that is, how easy that is for them to build into that.
3803440	3805640	But you are right to the extent of they
3805640	3807720	could probably just build it into the PlayStation 4.
3807920	3810520	But I suppose it also goes back to what we were talking about at the very beginning
3810720	3816360	of the show is that Microsoft could stop charging for gold tomorrow if they want.
3816560	3820640	But there's something very symbolic about doing it with Xbox Series X that could be
3820840	3824360	very interesting if that does pan out and ends up being true.
3824360	3826680	It's almost almost like you kind of tie
3826880	3830160	that feature to the new generation, if that makes sense.
3830360	3835280	So anyhow, let's move on to our next story, which is something I would like to play
3835480	3839720	with backwards compatibility, even on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.
3839920	3844880	Although knowing this game, it will probably get a rerelease on those systems
3845080	3848680	and will probably have even more features because this game just won't stop.
3848880	3850360	It's No Man's Sky.
3850560	3855360	And No Man's Sky got yet another big update this week.
3855560	3858480	What did they add? Something called Desolation.
3858680	3860840	It's a free update, as they all have been.
3861040	3863560	And now you have new freighters in the game.
3863760	3867240	And it's supposed to be kind of like a scary type of experience.
3867440	3869280	The freighters are procedurally
3869280	3871840	generated, like everything else in the game, of course.
3872040	3875880	And so wherever you find one, it'll be different every time.
3876080	3878680	You'll find ship logs, personal possessions,
3878680	3881600	and it'll talk about what happened to the crew that used to be there.
3881600	3882560	Yikes.
3882760	3884440	They brought a little bit of dead space into...
3884440	3886480	They brought a little bit of dead space in No Man's Sky.
3886680	3887720	That's exactly right.
3887920	3890360	You might find in these places the lights
3890560	3895040	are off or the gravity is off or the life support systems have gone wrong.
3895240	3900640	There will also be biological horrors that will be there to respond to you.
3900840	3902720	So that might be a little scary.
3902920	3904640	What is interesting, though, is that now,
3904680	3908480	if you didn't know, No Man's Sky truly is multiplayer now.
3908680	3910680	So you don't have to explore these things on your own.
3910880	3913120	You can do it with other people.
3913320	3915680	If you really want to kick up that horror,
3915880	3919040	don't forget No Man's Sky also got a VR update some time ago.
3919240	3922080	So you could do this whole thing in VR if you want,
3922280	3926200	if you want, underlined and italicized.
3926400	3926840	But yeah.
3926840	3928080	And of course, if you get through these
3928280	3931720	freighters, you get big rewards that you can use on your own starship.
3931920	3936440	And they say it will reflect the history of ships you've scavenged.
3936640	3937720	That's kind of interesting.
3937920	3940280	So, yeah, so that is yet another.
3940280	3941800	And of course, this update also comes
3942000	3945120	with bug fixes and the other types of minor updates.
3945320	3947760	But as much as it's almost meme-able
3947960	3951480	at this point that No Man's Sky got yet another update,
3951680	3957680	it is pretty awesome that this game that everybody hated right out the gate has not
3957680	3961720	stopped and has remained committed to filling out that full vision,
3961920	3965160	which quite honestly, if they had stopped six months ago,
3965160	3968000	I don't think anybody would have faulted them and said,
3968000	3969680	oh, you never delivered us a full game.
3969680	3971360	You know, they they've they delivered us
3971360	3973760	a full game and a lot of good stuff a long time ago.
3973960	3978480	But this like it almost feels like now they just want to one up their critics.
3978680	3982000	And that's fine, too, because the game just keeps going.
3982200	3983320	But, you know, I was talking about this
3983320	3985760	with Alan yesterday and he did bring up a good point.
3985760	3990560	And that was that he kind of like he was playing it for a little bit,
3990760	3993560	but almost got frustrated that whenever there was a big update,
3993760	3996120	it was like, I have to like relearn the game.
3996320	4000280	I have to like restart because all these things have changed in the game.
4000280	4002520	I don't think you necessarily have to restart.
4002720	4004160	But sometimes you just like there's that
4004360	4007200	psychological part that's like, I've missed all this stuff.
4007400	4009800	So I need to go back to the beginning and re-experience it all.
4010000	4014520	And so I kind of get that, too, where it's like, hey, guys,
4014680	4016640	hello, games, what you're doing is fabulous.
4016640	4018760	And we love that you supported the game this long.
4018960	4022760	But at the same time, could you kind of tell us, like, when you're done
4022960	4029200	so that we know it's it's safe to go exploring now and that it's I don't know,
4029400	4032160	like, is it's kind of a fine line.
4032160	4033560	What do you guys think in chat?
4033760	4036080	Do they keep building out the game or
4036280	4039120	is it time to just stop and let us experience what there is?
4039320	4041600	What do you think, Loki or Dark Sakura?
4041800	4043880	I still have to go back to play the game.
4044040	4048360	It's been a while and I've got a PC now, so I need to do that.
4048560	4054320	But I don't know if I don't know if I want to play it in VR and go into one of those
4054520	4056440	new freighters.
4057560	4061920	Well, I think that for them, this is actually kind of
4062120	4066160	a way to keep a franchise alive without actually having to do too much work to it.
4066360	4067640	Does that make sense?
4067840	4069240	Sure. I mean, I get it.
4069440	4073040	It is work, but it's I guess starting from scratch is a lot more work.
4073080	4075240	Creating No Man's Sky, too, is even more work.
4075440	4077200	I get it. Exactly.
4077400	4080200	So in this way, they get to keep
4080400	4083520	putting out more content
4083720	4088320	without having to go through all the.
4088520	4090880	The strains of
4091080	4095680	the best way to put it, without the strains of having to recreate their world,
4095880	4100120	it's just adding on and adding on like they've got infinite property and you're
4100120	4104320	just adding new it's like it's like Sarah Winchester in her house.
4105400	4107120	Or anyone who don't know,
4107320	4111360	you know, this is the Winchester Mystery House of Games.
4112560	4113760	No, that's right on the money.
4113760	4115200	That's that's a perfect answer.
4115400	4118040	No, that is the perfect comparison.
4118040	4120440	No Man's Sky is the Winchester Mystery House of Games.
4120640	4122240	You're absolutely right.
4122440	4127960	Yeah. And but hey, you know, she kept doing it until she died.
4128960	4132120	And nature tried to knock it over and guess what?
4132320	4133680	The house fucking stood.
4133880	4137760	So No Man's Sky is going to stand just like the Winchester Mystery House.
4137960	4141360	I think I think the Winchester Mystery House might be a local reference,
4141360	4143920	like most people from Northern California probably understand the joke.
4144120	4146120	There's that movie. Oh, that's right.
4146120	4147560	They made a movie out of it. I forgot.
4147560	4149280	It wasn't good, though. I don't think a lot of people saw it.
4149480	4151680	So if you don't want to see it, I love that place.
4151680	4154400	There's this woman and Winchester was like a gun company or something, right?
4154600	4157200	And she it was actually the Winchester Rifle Company.
4157240	4159400	Yeah, she there's this house in San Jose
4159400	4162040	and everybody knows it because everybody took a field trip there at some point
4162240	4164640	in their life while they grew up in this area.
4164840	4168000	And so she kept building and building and building to this house because she
4168000	4170080	believed she was being haunted or something like that.
4170280	4172480	Like the victims of the story.
4172680	4177960	The story goes is that because her husband's guns had killed so many
4178160	4184280	Native Americans that she that she thought she was being haunted by by their spirits.
4184440	4186480	She saw a medium who said that she wasn't
4186680	4189760	going to die until construction stopped on the house.
4189960	4194120	I mean, there's a lot there's she was a pretty private lady on top of it.
4194320	4197760	So there's really not a whole lot that's known.
4197960	4201600	But, you know, the house itself is absolutely amazing.
4201800	4204600	I've been on the extended tour.
4204800	4210280	Chris and I went before they moved out to Wisconsin.
4210480	4212880	I have a secret I've never been.
4213040	4215640	But I've beautiful I've done Rocky Horror
4215840	4218080	Picture Show in the movie theater next door.
4218280	4220520	And yes, there is a movie theater next door.
4220720	4222320	That was where I saw the labyrinth.
4222520	4224880	It's it's right in the middle of San Jose.
4224880	4226280	It's like they tear it down, though.
4226480	4229880	So the movie theater they did, they were going to tear down because we had
4229880	4232120	a mutual friend who was the manager there for many years.
4232320	4233120	That's right. Yeah.
4233320	4236880	So but they finally turn it down at any rate.
4236880	4240520	I mean, and you go into this and it's actually going back to No Man's Sky.
4240520	4241760	You go through and you have all this
4241800	4246000	discovery and you find these interesting little things and things that look like
4246200	4251920	their purpose, purposeless, I guess that's sort of making up just now purposeless.
4252120	4257440	Like she has a seance room that has a door that leads to a two story drop.
4257640	4261320	There are stairs that go to nowhere just to the ceiling.
4261520	4263480	She collected so much Tiffany.
4263680	4266480	There's like they've got a whole room dedicated to the Tiffany that she
4266680	4268840	collected and these teensy tiny little stairs.
4268840	4270640	But if you think about it again in terms
4270640	4272960	of the game being like the Winchester Mystery House,
4273160	4276280	doesn't the game have kind of weird dead ends like that, too?
4276480	4281440	So we have a we have a mutual friend and I don't want to out them here on the show,
4281640	4287480	but he lives kind of out in a rural area in a very kind of older home.
4287480	4290320	And we always kind of joke that he lived in the Winchester Mystery House because he
4290520	4294440	legit had this like room where, like, you would open a door and there just be a
4294440	4300520	brick wall there like, yeah, there was crazy stuff like that in the house.
4300720	4302520	And we're like, dude, your house is haunted.
4302720	4303600	But he loves it there.
4303800	4305560	So anyway.
4305760	4308240	All right. Sorry, we got on a tangent, but that's OK.
4308240	4308840	We're educated.
4309040	4312880	Let me ask you to have an email.
4313080	4316280	No. Oh, OK, I'll tell you later.
4316480	4318480	I'll text you. It's somebody local.
4318680	4321680	OK, OK, because I want to go there now.
4321840	4325240	OK, I texted you, OK,
4325440	4330520	but at any rate, at any rate, I'll just look at pictures of the Winchester Mystery.
4330720	4332800	Oh, OK, cool.
4333800	4335680	I love him. I haven't talked to him in so long.
4335880	4337400	Yeah, it's been a while for me, too.
4337600	4339880	But at any rate.
4340840	4342960	I think when you look at the Winchester
4343160	4348560	Mystery House and you look at the the game there, yeah, it is the Winchester
4348560	4352840	Mystery House of games, I feel confident in giving it that moniker.
4353040	4355960	No, that's great. And who even needs to expand on that?
4356160	4357280	OK. Hype mayhem.
4357480	4359720	I know you know what I meant.
4359760	4363200	He says, OK, not going to lie, even though I know what Jamie meant by Tiffany,
4363400	4368360	I also made a connection to the team from 80s that saying I think we're alone now.
4368560	4370240	Now, you know what?
4370440	4372240	Tiffany was a great singer.
4372440	4374320	She did more than malls.
4374520	4377800	OK, one point I have to get back to, though, that's very important with this is
4378040	4381720	that the whole and you brought up this idea of Dark Soccer with your Winchester
4381920	4386120	Mystery House comparison is that that there is particularly like new features
4386320	4391320	and new things that might expose the game to a new audience that hasn't experienced
4391520	4395520	the game yet. And a lot of you guys in chat are kind of when you hear that
4395520	4398320	they've built this jump scare thing in a no man's sky.
4398320	4399680	They've built a dead space type game.
4399880	4402360	A lot of you guys in chat are like, nope, nope, man.
4402560	4406080	Sky nope. And out of that, not for me, it's not what I want to do.
4406120	4408760	But if you think about it, and I'm sure all of you can see this,
4408960	4412000	there is an audience that loves scary games.
4412000	4414560	Look at some of the big stuff that streamed on Twitch.
4414560	4415920	A lot of scary games. Right.
4416120	4420520	And there's probably an audience out there that when they hear, oh, did you hear?
4420720	4423080	No man's sky has like a full on horror mode.
4423280	4425720	Now people are going to be like, what really?
4425920	4429360	I need to go back and visit that game or I need to pick that game up already.
4429360	4431160	It's on sale again or whatever it is.
4431360	4435280	So even though you might look at that feature and go, that's really not for me.
4435280	4437960	I think you can see where, oh, there's somebody else is going to look at that
4438160	4440560	and go, oh, I should check that out.
4440760	4441920	That's that's my jam.
4442120	4443480	I love horror games.
4443680	4446760	So kind of interesting anyway.
4446960	4448600	All right, let's move on.
4448800	4449840	More big stories.
4450040	4452720	I think this one's yours, Loki, or who's there?
4452720	4454520	Is it mine? Where are we at even?
4454720	4457080	It would be Jamie. Oh, it's Jamie again.
4457280	4458440	Yep. Well, shit.
4458440	4461400	I was going to eat some more pizza, but OK.
4462400	4467280	So there, you know, we often complain about Metacritic with, you know,
4467480	4470440	especially like when there's games that come out that people just want to
4470640	4474640	immediately poo poo on because they want to, you know, there was a woman
4474840	4478640	developed it or a writer or they don't like the storyline and they're just
4478840	4482040	really doing that soon now, you know, we call that review bombing.
4482040	4482760	Right.
4482960	4488560	So it's become such a big issue now that Metacritic announced that they're going
4488560	4495440	to delay user reviews for a video game for thirty six hours after the game's release.
4495640	4499800	And they quote that their decision is based on, here's the quote,
4500000	4504360	data driven research and with the input of critics and industry experts.
4504560	4505520	So here's the rest of it.
4505720	4509480	We recently implemented implemented the thirty six hour waiting period for all
4509680	4514000	user reviews in our game section to ensure our gamers have time to play these games
4514200	4517320	before writing their reviews, a Metacritic spokesperson said.
4517520	4521400	The new waiting period is for user reviews, for user reviews have been rolled out
4521400	4524920	across Metacritic's game section and was based on data driven research
4525120	4527720	with the input of critics and industry standards.
4527920	4530560	Now, we know that if they want to bomb it, they're going to bomb it.
4530760	4536120	But my hope with this is that they're going to.
4536320	4540000	They're going to, you know, kind of push people off that immediate thing
4540000	4541160	when they see that they can't get their
4541360	4544800	immediate reward out of it, then hopefully they're not going to do it.
4545000	4548320	Now, on top of that, just to add in another layer on things,
4548520	4552640	and this has actually been going on for quite a while, you know,
4552840	4558040	developers are really unhappy with how Metacritic was handling it before,
4558240	4562360	because, you know, some of those reviews are the lifeblood of of their their
4562560	4566360	careers, their games, you know, so.
4566560	4568240	I think this is this is a good step,
4568440	4573440	whether or not it will work remains to be seen, but, you know.
4574200	4579840	Yeah, with the whole Metacritic thing, I mean, I just just don't listen to user
4580040	4584680	reviews in the first place, that kind of would fix the problem, in my opinion.
4585880	4589680	Well, but the thing is, it's supposed to be, you know,
4589880	4592920	what's the word I'm thinking of, it's supposed to be
4593120	4595400	community driven as well.
4595600	4598360	So, I don't know.
4598560	4601080	Yeah, I mean, it's it's not going to stop
4601080	4604760	people from reviewing games on their Twitter account or on their Facebook feed
4604960	4607920	or on other places with social media or what have you.
4608120	4613880	But, you know, I guess Metacritic, if they want to stop being known as like the home
4614080	4619040	of terrible user reviews because games keep getting bombed because it's a game
4619240	4623960	for SJWs or whatever thing people are mad about with the with the games.
4624160	4626600	I I can understand where Metacritic's like,
4626800	4629600	we got to do something like this is getting crazy.
4630280	4634480	I don't think it's going to really I mean, maybe it'll just
4634680	4638560	calm them down a little bit, but like, I think they're going to still review bomb
4638760	4643360	and they'll review bomb in other places like Steam or something.
4643560	4645040	Yeah, that's true.
4645240	4649440	Do you do you think other you know, sometimes when a company does this,
4649640	4654720	it sets something in motion where like other companies start to follow suit a little bit.
4654920	4656920	Do you think Metacritic might be setting
4656920	4659880	a standard that sites like Steam and so forth are going to follow?
4660000	4661240	Although I don't know, Steam also just
4661440	4664480	shows like right there, like you've played for this many hours.
4664680	4666920	So you like you like know on Steam right away,
4667120	4670680	like this person actually played the game or they're full of shit.
4670880	4675960	Yeah, I don't know if that's going to necessarily I think that I know Metacritic
4675960	4678640	is kind of garbage when it comes to user reviews anyways.
4678840	4680440	I mean, that's what a lot of people think.
4680640	4685560	So it would be nice to have it not be garbage.
4686560	4689400	I don't know, I just kind of
4689600	4692880	just consider it just a complete garbage and look at the user reviews.
4693080	4697640	It's a good aggregate for like, you know, professional reviews, but
4697840	4702960	people want their voices heard and they're going to wait three days if they have to.
4703160	4706680	Or like I said, it's going to
4706880	4709400	it's going to make it not fun for them anymore having to wait.
4709400	4711640	And so there's not going to be any point in doing it.
4711800	4716680	Games do make so much of their buck right when they launch, though, you know,
4716880	4721480	like that that launch week, that launch day is so important that even delaying
4721680	4724800	that by three days might kind of sway things one way or another.
4725000	4728680	I look a lot with Mass Effect Andromeda, I think is a good example of that,
4728880	4732200	because remember how like a lot of the negativity for that game,
4732400	4735520	which, you know, in retrospect may have been too much,
4735720	4740120	really came out because it was released on that EA Access or whatever about three
4740120	4743720	days before the main might have been a little more like maybe like six or seven
4743920	4748960	days, but it came out a few days before it hit every other site.
4749160	4753240	And that's when people tore this game apart and we're showing off all the bugs
4753440	4755200	that hit social media and all this other stuff.
4755400	4759920	And it kind of did impact, I would say, how much that game sold on day one was
4760120	4765760	because EA did that preview for their monthly whatever peoples.
4765920	4768200	And I don't think like,
4768400	4772480	you know, my initial concern was that this is some other thing that they're going
4772680	4776360	to use, and when I say they, I mean, like the game industry is going to use
4776560	4780960	to try to hide negative reviews for, you know, legitimate stuff.
4780960	4783720	Like, for example, when they're adding loot boxes in, you know,
4783920	4785240	a lot of times you'll see these review
4785440	4790280	embargoes until, you know, the release date where they're hiding that stuff
4790280	4793160	in there so that people are unaware of it when they're making their purchases
4793160	4795320	or their preorders, when I don't think that's going to be
4795360	4798920	the case for this, I think it's more just to cut down on the garbage.
4799120	4801480	But you're just delaying the inevitable.
4801680	4805360	And if people are going to complain about game or if there's like something that is
4805360	4809120	really wrong with something, there's plenty of other outlets to complain about that.
4809120	4810560	Yeah, you are right in that.
4810560	4811680	They're going to just go to Twitter.
4811680	4812600	They're going to go to Facebook.
4812600	4814800	They're going to go to other social media platforms.
4814800	4819280	Twitter being the biggest one that comes to mind and and have their way there.
4819480	4820680	So
4821520	4823360	going to chat for some comments.
4823560	4827320	Quest Buster in chat says, I remember the early looks from Andromeda's
4827520	4831520	early access via EA Origins went viral over the flaws.
4831720	4835720	Yeah, that was that was a huge, huge, I think, faux pas to put.
4835920	4839920	I mean, it's a weird thing because I want to say it was really bad to put that out
4839920	4842000	early so that all those bugs could be called out.
4842200	4845800	But at the same time, those bugs needed to be called out.
4846000	4850320	That game was released half to bake, even though it was delayed a bunch of times.
4850520	4852440	It needed to be delayed one more time.
4852640	4855320	Cyberpunk has the right idea in that regard.
4855320	4857160	And, you know, if even though we can all
4857160	4860880	look at cyberpunk and go, oh, God, they are delaying that game again.
4860960	4862520	Well, do you want it to be?
4862720	4865000	Do you want it to be Mass Effect Andromeda?
4865200	4868040	So, you know, they might have to delay it again.
4868240	4869280	So.
4869480	4871640	All right. Anyway, let's move on.
4871840	4874600	We have some more stories, Loki.
4874800	4880560	All right. So like most things are convention related,
4880600	4883680	everything's kind of gone to this whole digital equivalent.
4883880	4887680	And that's going to be the same thing that's going to happen to QuakeCon,
4887880	4890160	which is held every year around August.
4890360	4894120	And so this year they're going to be doing in QuakeCon at Home 2020.
4894320	4897480	It's going to be set between August 7th and the 9th.
4897680	4901240	And they're going to have various events that are going to go along with that.
4901240	4903240	So they're going to have the global super stream.
4903440	4909160	It's going to feature news and different updates about Bethesda products.
4909320	4916360	They're going to have the QuakeCon Pro League and QuakeCon World Championships.
4916560	4920760	And yeah, they're also still having a prize pool up there.
4920960	4925080	So $150,000 up for grabs.
4925280	4928480	I'm not really I mean.
4928680	4929520	It'll be neat.
4929720	4931360	It's nice that they're going to be able
4931560	4934680	to carry on with this, even though they can't do an in-person event.
4934680	4936360	But
4936960	4937880	I don't know.
4938080	4940920	Not super excited about Bethesda these days.
4941120	4944440	I'm kind of like, let's see what the big news is that comes out about it.
4944640	4947680	You know, like if there's a new another Quake, I don't know.
4947680	4951320	What are we expecting that you're going to release another Quake game at some point?
4951520	4954280	Or is it still just about the champions game?
4955400	4957600	I don't know if there's any other news,
4957600	4961240	although I do see here in this article, they're talking about some new T-shirts
4961240	4963120	and those look pretty nice.
4963320	4968480	Like they have the Dovahkin and there's the Caddo demon.
4968680	4970840	But they're pretty cool.
4971040	4972880	I do still have a lot of love for classic
4973080	4977680	Quake, though, because I used to play that on LAN in college
4977880	4981360	with friends who had high speed Internet at their university.
4981560	4984280	And I would dial in and and play with them Quake.
4984280	4985120	We had a lot of fun with that.
4985120	4986560	And I think that was I think we would do
4986560	4989600	Team Fortress 2 back in the because, you know, that's where Team Fortress started
4989600	4992040	was a Quake mod, so it's good.
4992240	4995040	So what other what the other thing that's kind of cool about this, too,
4995040	4997080	is there are live streams that they're going to be doing as well.
4997120	5000800	They're going to be donating the proceeds to those two different charities.
5001000	5003040	So you have the Direct Relief UNICEF
5003240	5006640	for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the Trevor Project.
5006840	5007760	Cool.
5007960	5010520	And then they're also saying that you can
5010720	5016280	also donate as well to the Dallas Pet Alive and 4paws.
5016480	5017120	Very cool.
5017160	5021080	I love that they're turning it into a charity thing at this point.
5021280	5022520	So that's that's a good use.
5022720	5023760	Great. Yeah.
5023960	5025360	All right. Let's move on.
5025560	5029600	And this this kind of falls in the whole like rumors category.
5029800	5034320	But there's there's a little there's a little smoke with this one
5034320	5035880	that shows there might be a little fire.
5036080	5039880	And this has to do with some Twitter accounts that that were recently
5040080	5043120	registered and it appears they were registered by Nintendo.
5043320	5045160	There was a Twitter account called
5045360	5051000	at Super Mario 35th that was registered back in March of this year
5051200	5056160	that somebody recently found and it looks like, oh, there might be something
5056160	5058160	going on for Super Mario's 35th anniversary.
5058360	5063840	We had heard we've heard earlier rumors that Nintendo plans to do like re releases
5064040	5067120	of old Mario games this holiday and really kind of like, you know,
5067320	5071320	put out old Mario stuff again on the switch for this anniversary,
5071320	5073760	maybe like a souped up version of Mario 64, things like that.
5073760	5075280	Mario Sunshine might make a comeback.
5075480	5077120	We've heard these rumors before.
5077320	5082000	And now we see a Twitter account that kind of goes, oh, there might be something there.
5082000	5083040	Who knows now?
5083240	5086360	A lot of you probably thinking what I first thought when I saw this is I was
5086360	5089200	like, any idiot can roll a Twitter account with any name they want.
5089400	5093040	But I didn't realize you could do this.
5093240	5097720	One thing you can do on Twitter is you can go in and you can request to reset your
5097760	5101440	password. Well, I knew you could do that, but it actually shows you.
5101640	5105520	It says, like, you know, do you have your email address or whatever?
5105720	5108640	And it says email
5108840	5109880	with a link.
5110080	5113720	So that would be the email that's tied to the Twitter account.
5113920	5118200	Well, while you can't see the whole email, it masks it for privacy reasons that,
5118200	5121840	you know, whoever you don't want to be given out, especially like celebrities,
5121840	5124360	like you don't want to know the email behind Lady Gaga's account.
5124360	5126720	Right. That would be too much.
5126920	5131520	But what's interesting, it says email a link to it says ML and then a bunch of
5131720	5135960	asterisks, like it's somebody's name at and
5136160	5139480	blank, blank, blank, blank, dot, blank, blank, dot, blank, blank,
5139680	5145920	which is the perfect length for at Nintendo dot co dot JP.
5146120	5151200	And what somebody noticed is that it is the same email link,
5151200	5154200	like the same like chain of letters as
5154400	5160080	the official Splatoon JP account and the Smash Brothers JP account.
5160280	5165840	So it looks like this Super Mario thirty fifth may be something official.
5166040	5169760	But are you ready for the real whopper?
5169960	5172840	Because that isn't the only Twitter account that was made.
5173040	5175440	There is another Twitter account that was made.
5175600	5181360	And that it is at we're finally going to make an F-Zero game.
5181560	5186040	It Loki, it is at F-Zero, JP is the other that is no joke.
5186240	5188880	That is the other that is the other Twitter account.
5189080	5190320	Way to ruin my hype.
5190520	5191200	It really is.
5191400	5196240	OK, you know, I thought it was I thought it was a fucking joke, too.
5196440	5199760	And the same thing they went through and tried to reset the password.
5199960	5203640	And it's the same link such and such at at like, like, like.
5203800	5206760	So F-Zero JP appears to be an account.
5206960	5210400	Now, before we get too carried away, this could be a lot of things.
5210600	5215800	This could be just them protecting their IP, which Nintendo is notorious to do,
5216000	5217680	so that nobody else rolls this account.
5217880	5222000	It could be maybe we get a re it doesn't necessarily mean a new F-Zero game.
5222200	5227520	It could be a rerelease of F-Zero GX and AX, which I would be totally happy with.
5227720	5230280	To be quite honest, I'd be totally good with that.
5230480	5233400	It could be that. Who knows?
5234080	5236200	You know, there was a lot of rumors.
5236200	5239680	Again, now we're really going to the rumor farm, but whatever, who cares?
5239880	5242040	There was a lot of rumors
5242240	5245840	that one of the games that Nintendo bumped back from this holiday
5246040	5249720	that they've been working hard on was Mario Kart nine.
5249920	5252800	What if and humor me for a minute here,
5253000	5257840	what if somewhere along the way, Mario Kart nine became a new F-Zero game?
5259680	5261880	I mean, there's enough.
5262120	5263160	I don't see that.
5263360	5266440	Well, look at something like 250 CC, for God's sake.
5266640	5268880	It plays pretty crazy fast and there's
5269080	5274160	perfectly competent F-Zero tracks and stuff in Mario Kart.
5274360	5277360	Like maybe they decided to make Mario Kart
5277560	5280760	nine an F-Zero game instead somewhere along the way.
5280960	5285520	Again, I completely realize I'm being tinfoil, hatty and
5285960	5289200	you know, rumor mongering and all that stuff. Fine.
5289400	5291880	But this Twitter account is interesting.
5292080	5294880	It does appear Nintendo did register it.
5295080	5296040	So
5296240	5298080	SDG100Matt says, don't do this.
5298080	5299320	Don't mess with us like this.
5299520	5302640	Sorry. Orange Right says, I'll believe it when I see it.
5302840	5304720	Same at the end of the day.
5304920	5308080	Zetenchant says in chat says too late.
5308280	5310440	He opened the box. It can't be closed again.
5310640	5312240	Yeah, I went I went there.
5312360	5313840	Sorry. I bought a house there.
5314040	5315480	I live there.
5315680	5316600	What can we do?
5316800	5320720	Hype Mayhem says Mario Kart versus F-Zero.
5322360	5324360	That I wouldn't get.
5324560	5328520	I mean, in a way, you kind of already have that in Mario Kart eight,
5328720	5332680	but a full on versus, that would be a little weird to me because, you know,
5332880	5336480	F-Zero is supposed to be more science fictiony, but maybe maybe they're going
5336480	5338640	to take it in a cartoony direction. I don't know.
5338640	5342320	It's too early to say we have a fucking Twitter account and nothing else.
5342520	5344640	I just need Nintendo to have a direct already.
5344800	5348040	I think that's what we all want, but we'll see.
5348240	5349520	Who knows?
5349720	5351200	All right.
5351720	5352600	Whoo. All right.
5352800	5356360	Anyhow, enough of rumors with that, but that one got me really excited.
5356560	5359360	I'm still laughing that you kind of ruined the punch line there.
5359360	5361640	Loki would like, oh, what's it going to be, a new F-Zero?
5361840	5364040	Well, actually.
5364240	5366400	Well, actually.
5367160	5368760	All right, anyway, Dark Sakura,
5368960	5372760	you have another story for us before we get to our classic segment.
5372960	5374080	I do.
5374280	5375760	I think so about.
5375960	5377000	Yeah, yeah, I do.
5377200	5380840	Sorry, I was used to going right into my classic game.
5381040	5383680	So, yeah, anyway.
5383880	5389120	There is a Twitch streamer who built a computer inside of a video game
5389320	5395640	and it was done in let's see, it was.
5395960	5399400	Oh, my gosh, why can't I read so anyway,
5399640	5402840	a person named Tyler Hill built a reduced
5403040	5408840	instruction set computer RSC inside of another sandbox adventure game called
5409040	5410640	Astroneer.
5411160	5415280	He is kind of known for trying to build computers inside of video games.
5415480	5418400	So he actually posted it.
5418600	5420120	There's a link on Twitter to it.
5420320	5423800	And he did a demo.
5424000	5426600	It's actually out there public.
5426600	5428880	And he actually even explained how he did it.
5428960	5432640	So it looks like it's really just like a huge countdown.
5432840	5436520	So it's basically just very optimized
5436720	5439840	instructions, given a place to live in this game.
5440040	5442240	So I thought it was pretty cool.
5443000	5449840	But at any rate, yeah, it's it's it's a program ception, game ception,
5450040	5451640	compu ception.
5451840	5455360	No, it's that they built they built a game inside a game.
5455560	5457800	More like a counter inside a game.
5457840	5459960	But still, it's computing within computing.
5459960	5461360	Yeah, no, I think that's super cool.
5461360	5465040	Like, it makes me think of people that when they're like an emulator built
5465040	5466840	in Minecraft or something like that, I want to I don't know.
5467040	5469600	I might be just making shit up.
5469800	5471680	Gameboy emulator, I think at one time.
5471680	5473080	OK, so that's that's pretty cool.
5473280	5475040	But the fact that somebody kind of broke
5475040	5478360	it down even to like what a computer's kind of like bare roots are,
5478360	5479320	I think that's pretty cool.
5479320	5481040	And I love that they streamed it, too,
5481240	5485240	so that you can actually go back and learn something, so to speak.
5486080	5487120	So cool.
5487320	5487920	All right.
5488120	5492840	Well, now I suppose we can take a step back and take a look at Dark Sakura's
5493040	5498720	classic game of the week every week here on Orange on Tradio.
5498720	5502400	Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey,
5502600	5505080	you brats ought to be checking this game out this week.
5505280	5509680	But once a month in the year 2020, she, instead of spotlighting a classic
5509880	5514080	video game, likes to spotlight a classic pinball table.
5514320	5517600	And what is the table going to be this week?
5517800	5522920	I'm doing one that we're borrowing right now that is very stiff.
5523120	5526880	And I'm doing this in honor of the new
5527080	5530320	Sternbell Vira game that's coming out that.
5530520	5533680	Oh, my gosh, Rob, if you haven't seen it,
5533880	5536080	it's it's pretty, pretty cool.
5536280	5537760	It's a
5537960	5540520	got one of the video screens and everything.
5540560	5545000	And it plays back like old black and white B movies while she does
5545200	5548080	commentary on it, Elvira's House of Horrors.
5548280	5550360	But we're not talking about the new pinball.
5550560	5552160	We're talking about the old pinball.
5552360	5553960	So
5554160	5557640	scared stiff came out in 1996.
5557840	5562680	It was designed by Dennis Nordman, released by Midway as Bally.
5562880	5566120	And it features Elvira, the actress of the dark.
5566320	5568600	And it's the follow up to 1989's
5568640	5572080	Elvira and the Party Monsters was also designed by Nordman.
5572280	5575520	Now, the reason I didn't go with the one
5575720	5579920	in 1989 because I'm pretty much doing 90s and up for pinball.
5580120	5583520	I'm basically picking where we started getting the DMDs and everything.
5583720	5588640	So not any of the little ticker bars like Black Knight, the one before was very much
5588840	5591920	like the same type of scoring like Black Knight did.
5592120	5595720	But anyway, the game, of course, has a B movie horror thing.
5595720	5598280	You have to go through tales of terror
5598480	5603800	to level up on the Stiff-O-Meter and you have Eyes of the Boating Beast,
5604000	5607880	Terror from the Crate, The Stiff in the Coffin, The Monster's Lab,
5608080	5611440	Night of the Leapers, and Return of the Deadheads.
5611640	5617240	You also have an interactive back box that has a spinning slider,
5617440	5621800	sorry, a spinning spider, my gosh, and you use it to collect different
5621840	5625720	features and start special modes, and it uses the DSC sound system.
5625920	5627440	It was
5629400	5636920	one of those games that when they did the exhibition at the 1996 AMOA show,
5637120	5640520	Miss Cassandra Peterson showed up as Elvira to promote the game.
5640720	5642200	Pretty cool.
5642840	5647160	Now, it was supposed to have these little rubber bogeyman features,
5647360	5650760	slingshots that were supposed to move forward with the kicker.
5650960	5655480	It was when you hit the slingshot and the ROM still allows the bogeyman to dance
5655680	5658800	with the music from the bogeyman boogie mode,
5659000	5663600	but they removed it late in production because the arms were,
5663800	5666160	they thought they were going to break off
5666360	5669920	because there's an opening between the slingshot plastics
5670120	5673040	that's actually still present that you can
5673240	5676800	go in and there's even something about it in the game's manual.
5677000	5679560	So since the code is still there,
5679760	5682720	people have added the bogeyman modifications back to their games.
5682920	5684880	You can buy them
5685080	5690120	at freeplayamusements.com, it looks like.
5691120	5693560	Or you can look for them at Robertwinter.com.
5693760	5698040	I think it's supposed to be re-release, he's re-releasing them.
5698240	5700880	But at any rate, going now to the specifics
5701080	5706400	from IPMD, the Internet Involved Machine Database,
5707360	5709360	it
5710200	5713640	actually is a really amazing machine.
5713840	5717720	You can look at all the specifications on it there, the back glasses screen.
5717920	5722920	I think what I linked was a pinball arcade or something like that.
5723120	5725120	But the game's really, really super fun.
5725320	5730360	And, you know, it's got a great theme because Elvira is just absolutely hilarious.
5730560	5736080	She is a queen, she is a drag queen, and she did it perfectly before
5736240	5740600	a lot of our modern queens owe their stuff to Elvira, I'm just saying.
5741440	5744440	But at any rate, it's really amazing.
5744640	5749040	If you never have played it, you need to find it.
5749240	5753560	And there's another note that there's a skull pile in the upper right corner
5753760	5758800	of the play field that do not have light up eyes in the production games.
5759000	5763360	So if you see any games that have LEDs in the skull, this is after Factory,
5763560	5765600	as were, of course, the bogeyman characters.
5765800	5767640	So there you go.
5767840	5774840	The classic game of September 1996 is Scared Stiff by Bally Midway.
5775040	5778520	And one of my very favorite tables as well, because I love Elvira.
5778720	5782040	How can you not? Decontaminate yourself from play.
5782240	5783480	I know, right?
5783680	5787240	So I've been stuck in this house since March.
5787440	5788440	Haven't been able to do anything.
5788640	5792440	If you haven't been around other people for two weeks and you're not sick.
5792640	5794440	There's that whole thing that happened with my dad.
5794480	5797560	So technically, I'm not at two weeks out, you know, so.
5797760	5799720	But at any rate, see, listen to us.
5799920	5802480	We're being responsible.
5802680	5805480	We quarantine before we make any plans.
5805680	5807960	And it's all masks all the time.
5808160	5812720	So speaking of which, I'm putting my mask back on.
5812920	5815080	Oh, yes. I can go back on camera.
5815280	5819480	Because you're about to bid us adieu tonight, right?
5820680	5822280	All right.
5822680	5824120	I forgot the song.
5824320	5825640	Crap. Oh, well.
5825840	5829560	And you don't forget, your mic gets really quiet when you have that mask on.
5829760	5831240	I know. Here, I'll put it under.
5831440	5833440	Oh, it's in my mouth now.
5835880	5841360	All right. I'm filling this with rosemary and rose petals.
5841560	5845360	So it's Rose Rosemary or maybe Rosemary Rose.
5845560	5851280	I am coming to stick the cocaine in you and use my leeches to get rid of the nasty
5851280	5853560	humors that are causing your illness.
5853760	5855280	Oh,
5856480	5858280	beautiful. Thank you so much.
5858480	5861280	So my Oscar pitch,
5861480	5862880	it's in the mail.
5863080	5867480	Anyway, I know you have to bid us adieu, but take care.
5867480	5868320	Thank you for being here.
5868520	5871280	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
5871480	5873240	They'll be stupid.
5873440	5874680	Good advice. Thank you.
5874880	5876960	I'll take that to heart. Wear your mask.
5877160	5878920	Wash your hands.
5879080	5882560	If you've been around people for any reason, take two weeks to decontaminate.
5882560	5883800	Make sure you're not sick.
5884000	5886880	Oh, and good news, my mom does not have the COVID.
5887080	5890320	I totally forgot to ask you that question on air, but I know you told me that off
5890320	5891560	air, but yeah, great.
5891560	5892680	Thank you for confirming.
5892880	5894160	Does not have the COVID.
5894360	5896280	So that's good news.
5896480	5897720	Hope she feels better nonetheless,
5897720	5900600	because obviously whatever she has is pretty shitty like a flu or something.
5900800	5904360	But I sent her I sent her vitamins and feel good stuff.
5904560	5905920	So I'll check on her.
5905920	5910200	But everybody be smart, take care of yourself.
5910400	5912680	Be healthy, be safe and be intelligent.
5912880	5916360	All right. Because if you're not, I'll make fun of you and then stay, you know,
5916560	5918520	miles away from you. All right.
5918720	5920400	With love. Sounds good.
5920600	5922200	Take care, Jamie.
5922400	5923600	Bye. Bye.
5923800	5927080	All right. We're going to move on with rapid fire news.
5927280	5928560	Logie.
5931120	5932520	You want to unmute yourself, Logie?
5932520	5934400	It would be easier to hear you. I want to do that.
5934400	5936160	Yes. Yes, very good.
5936360	5940760	So apparently there's been a lot of people upset with the fact
5940960	5944440	that Rockstar Games hasn't updated Red Dead Online in a while.
5944640	5948320	So they haven't had a major update in over seven months,
5948520	5951880	with the last one being in December of last year.
5952080	5959000	And so to kind of protest that the users online have been dressing like clowns.
5959200	5964320	So they're bringing in the clowns to protest the fact that
5964520	5966120	this isn't a joke to them.
5966320	5971760	I think that's funny because the whole clown clownery is kind of like a meme online.
5971960	5974640	And so there's all sorts of, like, clown memes out there.
5974640	5977080	You know, when you do clownery, the clown come back to bite,
5977080	5978280	you know, those sorts of things.
5978480	5981000	So I love that they're actually, like, dressing.
5981200	5983640	Like, how big of a clown can you be in Red Dead?
5983840	5986840	Like, can you full on, like, red nose Hong Kong?
5987040	5991360	You can do some pretty decent clown makeup in there, at least.
5992120	5995880	Yeah, it looks period accurate clowning.
5996080	5998000	All right. Pure clownery.
5998200	6001560	So that's what they're doing to protest that.
6001760	6003120	Which, yeah, I mean, I get it.
6003120	6004560	Maybe they just don't make this.
6004760	6007800	Rockstar is probably not bringing as much money with Red Dead Online,
6007800	6012240	but they've never really kind of given it the same attention as Grand Theft Auto 5
6012440	6013760	or Grand Theft Auto Online.
6013960	6015280	So,
6015960	6018960	yeah, you get what you put into it, I guess.
6019160	6020680	Yeah, for sure.
6020840	6026800	And then more movie news coming out and just as crazy as some of these other movie
6026800	6029600	ideas that they've had with, like, the Saints Row movie and stuff.
6029800	6032440	This was another one that I would definitely want to see.
6032640	6033720	Just Cause.
6033920	6038080	So Just Cause has finally secured a director,
6038280	6042920	Mike Douse, who I guess he had shot, let's see,
6043120	6048320	a metal mockumentary FUBAR, the F word, some episodes for that.
6048480	6053720	And, of course, the show that's on, I think, Hulu right now, Future Man.
6053920	6055400	And then they have Preacher.
6055600	6058680	So I don't see necessarily a lot of movie stuff there.
6058880	6063080	But yeah, if they can keep it as crazy
6063280	6069000	as the game, then I'm all in because that game is absolutely nuts.
6070440	6072640	Sounds like something up your alley.
6072840	6074600	Oh, yeah. All right.
6074800	6075720	Crazy.
6075920	6078000	Moving on, some other rapid fire news.
6078240	6082560	For those of you guys that don't like to download your games or buy them online
6082560	6086680	and you prefer to install them the old fashioned way and talking about PC games,
6086880	6090520	you have quite the option for Microsoft Flight Simulator.
6090720	6093640	You can actually buy a version of Microsoft Flight Simulator,
6093840	6100280	which is a 90 gigabyte game that will actually come on ten different DVDs.
6100480	6102640	That's right. Ten different DVDs.
6102840	6104120	Because apparently, and Jason was kind
6104120	6106480	of hinting at this in the intro a little bit for tonight's show.
6106640	6110200	Apparently, a lot of computers don't actually have Blu-ray players in them.
6110200	6112160	DVDs a little more standard, not to say.
6112160	6114760	I mean, I'm sure many of you in chat are like mine as a Blu-ray player.
6114880	6115960	Yeah, some of them do.
6115960	6119120	But because Blu-ray didn't really catch on as like a standard for digital medium,
6119320	6121800	I think a lot more computers kind of have DVD built in.
6122000	6125000	And Flight Simulator is one of those games.
6125200	6127800	I mean, it's truly for people of all ages.
6128000	6130680	But there is like an older audience,
6130920	6135960	especially retired pilots and older folks
6135960	6139120	that maybe don't actually get to get out and fly like a regular plane.
6139320	6144400	I would say that Microsoft Flight Simulator is actually has a good sales
6144600	6150280	block from this group of probably older folks who don't do the steam
6150280	6152880	and the online stuff, who have to do something a little more.
6152880	6154920	And I'm using my quote fingers old fashioned.
6155120	6159000	And so installing from the DVDs might be the way to do it.
6159000	6161120	So it actually, you know, as much we're kind of like laughing at it,
6161320	6164320	because like 10 DVDs to play one game, that's crazy.
6164520	6166160	Although, you know, back in the day,
6166160	6169000	I remember when it was those three and a half inch floppies.
6169120	6174640	And I think it was like King's Quest five or six was on like 14 disks to install.
6174840	6177960	Well, I mean, a gigantic game that would take a long time.
6178160	6181600	But hey, I mean, if you're strapped for bandwidth, you know,
6181800	6186560	and that's 90 gigs that you don't have to download or you you live in a place
6186600	6190480	like Alaska or something that doesn't have, you know, well, obviously,
6190480	6192080	if you live in like Juneau or one of the big cities.
6192280	6195800	But, you know, again, if you're a retired pilot, chances are you probably live
6195800	6198080	somewhere pretty remote on your nice little ranch somewhere.
6198240	6201120	And you may not have that kind of Internet, you know.
6201320	6204080	Yeah, yeah. So I think I think it's really interesting.
6204280	6207240	So they say the simulator is 100 percent the same.
6207440	6209280	The box retail version just has a nice
6209480	6212600	box and about 90 gigs that you don't have to download.
6212760	6214640	There's no difference between box retail
6214640	6217120	and the version that Microsoft sells directly.
6217320	6219000	It's kind of kind of interesting.
6219200	6223040	But yeah, I think this is really to address like an older audience that wouldn't
6223240	6226360	necessarily buy a lot of other games, so to speak.
6226560	6229040	And SGA 100 Matt says, Where is Legend of Zaku?
6229040	6232360	He's the flight simulator buff, but also an excellent example of the fact
6232560	6237240	that when I say like the older audience is an audience, it's clearly not the only
6237440	6240360	audience, Zaku is not over the age of 65.
6240360	6242960	In fact, he's quite younger than I am and enjoys flight simulators.
6243200	6246920	There's people that enjoy flight sims of all ages, of course.
6247120	6250880	And so there's many people that will just do the 90 gigabyte download, I'm sure.
6251080	6254400	I just think it is kind of interesting that a game like this kind of has to still do
6254600	6260680	an old fashioned, so to speak, route, probably for a certain chunk of its audience.
6260880	6264880	So TigerClanChat says, Imagine how many floppies this game would take.
6265080	6268120	Yeah, but counterpoint, as fun as that is
6268320	6271960	to imagine how many computers actually have floppy drives anymore.
6272160	6274840	I remember it was like an ingress thing or something.
6274840	6277800	Something happened where like there was a three and a half inch floppy.
6277800	6280280	Somebody found and I think it was an ingress thing.
6280280	6281960	We had to get the contents of the disk.
6282160	6286160	Nobody on the team had a fucking three and a half inch floppy drive.
6286360	6288240	Nobody had a drive to do it.
6288440	6292680	Like, so now to find a working floppy drive is actually a challenge.
6292880	6296240	And again, I'm sure there's somebody in chat that's going to go, I've got one.
6296440	6300560	It works. OK, but you do realize you're one of only a few.
6301360	6303920	And they have USB.
6304120	6309840	Like, it's very easy to find, like a USB, $20, like floppy drive type of thing
6310040	6314440	so that people can get old pictures and old media and things like that.
6314640	6316240	There's certainly plenty of uses for it.
6316440	6319720	But I think we all know that isn't common.
6319920	6325160	DVD drives are common now in computers and have been for over 10 years,
6325360	6328880	probably more like 15 years, probably even longer than that shit.
6328920	6331960	Probably closer to 20 years in computers.
6332160	6334680	So, yeah.
6334880	6338840	Anyway, looking in chat, Tigerclass says, I bet you can find on eBay.
6339040	6342160	Of course, S2100Matt says, yeah, Newegg has a bunch.
6342240	6343040	Yeah, of course. Yeah.
6343040	6345320	Again, I'm not saying these things don't exist.
6345520	6348920	I'm just saying they're not common in computers anymore.
6348920	6350720	And that was the idea behind this was
6350920	6354760	how do we what is common in computers if somebody doesn't have the right Internet?
6354920	6359000	Now, PodCulture in chat says, wonder why they couldn't go USB.
6359200	6361120	Even old computers have that.
6361320	6363120	That's actually a good question.
6363320	6367480	It's probably cheaper to actually do the 10 DVDs.
6367680	6373800	It's cheaper to press this than it is to purchase a USB and have that available.
6374000	6376240	Some of those USB sticks, though, are pretty.
6376440	6380200	But maybe a 32 and a 64 would still be pretty cheap.
6380400	6382880	Once you start to go past that, it probably gets a little more pricey.
6382880	6384160	And it probably isn't, you know.
6384760	6386400	But for a collector's edition or
6386400	6389200	something, I don't think PodCulture's idea is necessarily bad.
6389400	6390840	No, it's not a terrible idea.
6391040	6394280	I don't think they want to spend that money,
6394480	6400000	whereas it costs since to press a disk, so I don't know.
6400200	6401360	And even on top of that,
6401360	6404440	even after you've installed everything off that disk, you still have to download
6404640	6409640	updates that are significantly large.
6409840	6411560	Now, DJ Rama S. brings up a good point
6411560	6413280	saying, interesting that you discussed this.
6413480	6416680	I'm looking to buy a new computer case to rebuild my PC into.
6416880	6421760	And 90 percent of cases out there don't support spaces for DVD or Blu-ray drives.
6421960	6423880	Well, now it's the opposite problem.
6424080	6425200	Why should they?
6425400	6428920	What what what even comes out on DVD and Blu-ray anymore?
6429120	6431960	Microsoft Flight Simulator.
6432160	6434640	Well, you can always just get a USB drive.
6434840	6437680	I mean, that's what you're and
6437880	6441080	there's a great application of PodCulture's idea.
6441080	6443440	It's a USB drive now.
6443640	6446480	No, I mean like a USB DVD drive.
6446680	6448000	Oh, yeah, no pleasure.
6448200	6453160	My first my first CD burner was an external that was through USB.
6453360	6453880	You remember that?
6453880	6457360	Because I think it was on the O.L.R. computer, the one in the garage for a while.
6457560	6464600	My first CD was it my first CD drive was a SCSI and an external SCSI card.
6464800	6466520	Now, so that was fun.
6466720	6468760	I remember my old work,
6468920	6471800	who remembers these?
6472000	6478080	I used to have the zip drive at work, which was those gigantic fucking disks.
6478280	6480840	Was it 100 megs that they held or 100 gigs?
6481040	6482880	It was 100 megs.
6483080	6485040	And so, yes.
6485240	6490600	So previously I used to have a pretty decent Internet.
6490640	6492320	This is back when I was on like dial up.
6492520	6495400	So I had decent Internet, like.
6495640	6503440	At work, so I used to put on zip disk.
6503640	6504600	Not everybody knows this,
6504600	6507560	but I used to do light publishing work like way back in the day.
6507760	6511360	And so some of the layouts, they were too big for a normal disk.
6511560	6513240	And this zip drive was like maybe like
6513440	6516280	two years before, like CD burners were commonplace.
6516480	6519640	So we actually had the zip drive thing and I used to used to save it to a zip
6519640	6522760	drive and FedEx it to the main office to be in the magazine.
6522840	6524160	That's how we would send the files back
6524160	6528640	and forth, because you couldn't like 100 make you couldn't send a print layout.
6528840	6533280	It was way too big of a file, but like the drive was like the perfect media for it.
6533480	6537680	And then before zip drives, it used to be zipping it up and disk
6537880	6542800	spanning, which, oh, God, and I would do that with like 50 days.
6542840	6543880	Oh, yeah. With shareware.
6544080	6545200	Yeah. Hell yeah.
6545400	6549560	Not necessarily shareware with step files.
6549760	6550880	Oh, God.
6551880	6552880	All right.
6553080	6554640	I love that.
6554840	6557360	We got to move on. We still got more show to cover here.
6557560	6559640	And let's talk about EA.
6559840	6565680	EA is going to remove the Washington football team's name in Madden 21.
6565880	6568560	I'm sure you guys all heard the Washington team.
6568720	6570400	This is how much I follow sports.
6570400	6572360	Everybody, you ready? You all ready to make fun of me?
6572560	6577120	SSG one hundred. Matt, you got your popcorn ready up until this week.
6577320	6578840	I always thought when they were talking
6578840	6583040	about the Washington football team, it was Washington State.
6583240	6586920	I thought they were in like Spokane or something.
6587120	6592280	I did not realize until this week that that team was a Washington DC team.
6592480	6594720	That's how much I follow football.
6594920	6598200	I'm so embarrassed, but also not like come on.
6598400	6602160	But yeah, so that team, as you know, is changing their name.
6602360	6604480	We don't know what the new name is going to be yet.
6604680	6606720	But Madden 21 has already responded.
6606760	6609280	EA saying they're going to make some changes there.
6609480	6612000	So they will have that fixed in Madden 21.
6612000	6613480	I imagine that's going to be in a patch
6613680	6616560	maybe because Madden 21 comes out on August 25th.
6616760	6618920	So it's very likely it's already gone gold.
6619120	6619880	I don't know.
6620080	6624640	But there will be a generic Washington name and logo first and then they will
6624840	6626920	patch in whatever is decided later on.
6627120	6632120	So I think it's just going to be Washington with no name and like a W on
6632160	6636280	the hat or something, and then they will patch in whatever they actually decide to
6636480	6639720	do when that's all figured out. So there you go.
6639720	6641800	And I got to look at chat and see if there's any comments.
6642000	6644640	SGA 100 Matt says, actually, that's not that bad.
6644640	6647960	Oh, thank you. You all are so nice.
6648160	6650280	SGA 100 Matt says, although the last
6650480	6654120	Magfest you were at, Rob, that football team took up part of the hotel.
6654320	6657520	I didn't even realize.
6657720	6659200	You say that it makes sense.
6659400	6661040	But anyway,
6662120	6666520	Bobby Black Wolf says the Onion had a great article about how they were finally
6666720	6671080	changing the offensive part of their name and changing their name to the DC.
6671280	6673880	Old name. This is funny.
6674080	6675240	All right.
6675440	6679040	Moving on, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
6679240	6680680	I need to step away real quick.
6680680	6683240	Loki, I'm going to do Japanese releases first, if you don't mind.
6683240	6685120	So that gives you a nice little buffer time there.
6685320	6688720	All right. So let me do the Japanese releases real quick here.
6688920	6690960	So coming out in Japan this week,
6691160	6694840	first off on the Nintendo Switch coming out,
6695040	6698720	I think Call of Cthulhu is the only game this week on the Nintendo Switch.
6698920	6700400	That is coming out on the twenty third.
6700600	6705880	And then on the PlayStation four this week over in Japan,
6706080	6709720	Sengoku Basara for Sumer Gari.
6709920	6712000	And that's a anniversary edition.
6712000	6714960	So that is a price reduction of a game from Capcom.
6715160	6719120	I'm trying to see if this is one that I recognized.
6719280	6722760	Sengoku Basara is this.
6722960	6727320	This is Dynasty Warriors, no, because they don't count as make that game.
6727520	6732240	It's it's like Dynasty Warriors, it's Capcom's version of that.
6732240	6734320	Yeah, I can't remember the name of it here.
6734520	6738800	I'm sure somebody in chat will type in all the things for Sara here.
6739000	6740200	They call it that here.
6740400	6743720	They gave it a different name on the like it was on the Wii or
6743920	6747200	something or maybe it was around the time that we was around.
6747360	6750440	They call it something different, but I don't remember what it was.
6750640	6753880	But I think they still call it Sengoku Basara.
6754080	6755200	Gotcha. All right.
6755400	6758040	I will be right back, Loki.
6758240	6760360	OK, let's see.
6760560	6764400	So in the U.S., we've got a few things coming out this week.
6764600	6767840	So Rock of Ages three, make and break on PC,
6768040	6773600	Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, Xbox one and Stadia carry on,
6773760	6775440	which is from Devolver Digital.
6775640	6779160	That's going to be on PC, Nintendo Switch and Xbox one.
6779360	6782920	Crisis remastered on Nintendo Switch,
6783120	6788000	Tannenberg on PlayStation four and Xbox one.
6788200	6792440	And last but not least this week,
6792640	6795440	actually, that would be last and not least.
6795640	6797480	So Tannenberg it is.
6797680	6801120	And then we've got for the UK,
6801280	6805680	New Super Lucky's Tale on PlayStation four
6805880	6811760	and Human Fall Flat on PlayStation four, Nintendo Switch and Xbox one.
6811960	6814880	And then finally,
6815080	6817280	that's it, I guess. Very limited.
6817280	6819000	Lots of stuff coming out next week, though.
6819200	6824040	I've got Destroy All Humans or the week after next Destroy All Humans with that remake.
6824240	6826480	And it's been a while since I played that.
6826680	6830760	They'll be coming out on consoles very soon.
6831520	6836040	And until then, I guess we can talk about Minecraft since Rob's not here.
6836240	6840240	So as you see, like this video that's
6840440	6845360	been playing in the very background here of my image, it's actually a survival server
6845560	6849240	that we've been doing for about four months, I think, because we did have
6849240	6853080	a world that started off with my kids, but we finished that very fast
6853080	6856280	because they wanted to kind of cheat their way through everything and finally
6856480	6860480	convinced them again to start from scratch and not cheat.
6860640	6864360	So we've been doing that for a while, finally finished
6864560	6868160	taking on pretty much all the challenges of this.
6868360	6872520	The last thing we have to do is actually the woodland mansion.
6872720	6876960	But we did the sea or was it the ocean monuments?
6877160	6880160	We did two of those yesterday.
6880360	6885680	And so I'd actually physically take took down one whole monument.
6885880	6888640	And I'm going to turn the other one into a guardian spawner.
6888680	6890480	So that'd be fun. I'm back.
6890680	6892520	Thank you for buying time.
6893120	6894040	No, that's good.
6894240	6895400	That's no, that's good. That's good.
6895400	6897320	I can hear on my monitor here, so that's good.
6897320	6898320	All right, awesome.
6898520	6900240	We're going to go to the mailbag.
6900440	6904560	So every week you guys send us emails, participate at orangelandradio.com
6904760	6907120	and we read some of our favorites here on the show.
6907120	6910240	So we have a couple of emails here tonight and we're going to start tonight
6910440	6914920	with an email from good old YYR, creator of such
6915120	6917800	classic games available on Steam,
6918000	6922240	such as multi super multitasking,
6922440	6924320	such as names that escape me in the moment,
6924520	6928160	Sharpshooter, Bungee Ferret tossing, although that's not on Steam right now.
6928360	6932160	But it's, you know, check out his site, YYRgames.com.
6932160	6933200	It goes over everything.
6933400	6936520	Hello, LR. Towards the end of the July 5th show,
6936720	6940280	you mentioned DDR A20 Plus, new level check feature.
6940480	6943480	I find it to be one of the really interesting additions to this new version.
6943480	6945320	So I figured I'd explain how it works.
6945520	6949240	This special stage will begin playing automatically if the first stage has
6949440	6954360	failed and if at least one player has never passed a level seven or higher song
6954560	6957240	or did not log in with the amusement pass.
6957440	6959920	The machine will proclaim, let's see your moves.
6960120	6963200	And we'll begin playing one of A20 certified bangers.
6963400	6965880	This beat is with a special chart.
6966080	6970240	This full length chart starts off very easy, which is occasional simple steps,
6970440	6972720	but ramps up in difficulty as you play,
6972920	6976320	testing you with jumps, free zeros and some mix ups.
6976520	6978840	If you miss 20 steps, you will fail out.
6978960	6981640	But the other player can keep going if they're doing better.
6981840	6985200	Just as with the tutorial, you can also choose to skip this stage entirely
6985200	6987280	by pressing the green button on the machine.
6987480	6991440	If you don't skip, then you'll get a results screen after the stage is played
6991640	6995920	and it'll show a recommended level for each player between one and six
6996120	6999520	or simply over six if you aced it.
6999680	7000920	That's a pun.
7001120	7003760	It will also show some chart recommendations,
7003960	7007080	but since it only picks from default songs added to A20,
7007280	7010200	plus the pool it picks from is rather small.
7010400	7012680	Finally, if at least one player logged
7012680	7015400	in with their amusement pass and premium play was used,
7015600	7019640	the game will proceed to the second stage as usual because three songs are guaranteed.
7019840	7021760	If not, the game ends there and you'll have
7021760	7024040	to play again if you want to try the recommendations.
7024240	7025640	Still, I think it's nice that you get
7025640	7028360	to play a bit longer if you bomb out of the first song.
7028560	7031000	Yeah, it's one of those things where like now that you're explaining it,
7031000	7033800	I'm like, damn, that would have been awesome in DDR back in the day.
7034000	7039320	Like a song to measure like this is the level of song you should be trying right now.
7039520	7043680	Why don't they should put that in like BeatMania 2DX and there are other games
7043880	7048320	which I realize, man, I wish we had BeatMania 2DX at home.
7048520	7051720	I so wish we had that, but I guess that's another story.
7051920	7052760	All right.
7052960	7055000	Anyway, I'm actually taking a peek at chat real quick.
7055200	7057440	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, oh, that sounds cool.
7057480	7060800	Hopefully, if we ever get out of this COVID thing and I can find a machine,
7061000	7063000	I'll definitely play some A20 plus.
7063000	7063800	Yeah, for sure.
7063920	7065920	That's where I'm at, too, is it's like, all right.
7066120	7067600	Any day when COVID is done.
7067800	7069000	OK.
7069880	7071880	Moving on
7072600	7073680	to the rest of that email.
7073880	7075320	I didn't finish the email.
7075520	7079800	It seems that this feature is intended for brand new players who have no idea what
7079800	7082400	to pick and wind up choosing something too difficult.
7082600	7086000	Unfortunately, this is also the sort of player who typically walks off after
7086040	7087800	the first song, whether they pass or not.
7088000	7088920	Oh, well.
7089120	7091360	Before I go, I want to mention an interesting
7091360	7093680	bit of news that may or may not have made the show roll.
7093880	7097760	It appears that as of today, it is no longer possible to purchase a 12 month
7097760	7101120	Xbox Live Gold subscription digitally, which, of course, we did talk about at
7101120	7103640	the beginning of the show, but let's get YYR's thoughts.
7103840	7107360	The one month and three month options remain and their prices are unchanged,
7107560	7111160	but the 12 month options vanished entirely from the Xbox dashboard.
7111360	7115720	Immediately, I thought of Rob's past speculation that Microsoft may choose
7115720	7118320	to make online player free in the future,
7118520	7123160	or this may just be a heavy handed way to steer folks towards Game Pass Ultimate.
7123360	7126680	But if they want to really make headlines on the Series X launches,
7126880	7130040	dropping paid online multiplayer would be one way to do it.
7130240	7131280	What do you think?
7131480	7135520	Well, I think I made my thoughts on this at the beginning of the show known,
7135720	7141600	but I appreciate you because you've been a big Microsoft guy for a while now.
7141600	7144200	I know in the early days and I didn't even own an Xbox one.
7144400	7149320	You're kind of sometimes setting our path right on some assumptions we made about
7149320	7150920	the system that we weren't always right about.
7151120	7156440	So the fact that I know you're kind of coming to the same conclusion that my
7156640	7160880	crazy speculation did a few years ago is actually oddly comforting.
7161080	7162400	So we'll see what becomes of it.
7162600	7164080	And that's what I think.
7164280	7168040	Anyway, thanks again for putting the show together and have another great week.
7168240	7171400	Wishing he could actually go play DDR without risking his life.
7171560	7174480	Aaron Yyr. Same, same.
7174680	7178840	And I really hope we get to the other side of this before too long.
7179040	7180120	Anyway,
7180320	7183680	there is some pretty exciting stuff, speaking of DDR,
7183880	7186760	that I saw on Twitter this week.
7186960	7192360	So there's been a lot of development in producing a DDR omni mix,
7192560	7197560	which is basically hacking the old System 573 mixes
7197760	7200200	to put whatever songs you want on there.
7200400	7205480	And pretty exciting stuff I saw where they've mixed up the song list to add
7205680	7210040	stuff that's been taken out of Extreme and removing other songs like Let Them Move.
7210240	7212240	And
7212640	7217440	yeah, very exciting to see where that goes, since I have a modded system to do that.
7217560	7221760	Of course, I also have set mania, so it's kind of irrelevant, but still would be neat.
7221760	7222680	That's still neat.
7222880	7224840	I'd be curious to see where that goes. Cool.
7225040	7228360	All right. We have one more email tonight from AJ Twist.
7228560	7232480	I haven't heard this name in the email bag for a long time, so good to have you back.
7232680	7235320	AJ Twist emails us saying, Good evening, OLR.
7235520	7238120	Long time listener. Third time writer.
7238320	7240720	I know you've written us before, but all right.
7240920	7244440	I've had an itch for a new music rhythm game for a while now.
7244440	7246080	We've got a lot of music stories tonight.
7246280	7247480	I don't mind.
7247680	7253760	A few months ago, I saw someone streaming Spin Rhythm XD and had to try it out.
7253960	7256160	It almost plays like DJ Hero.
7256360	7257800	It was $15 on Steam.
7257840	7259640	I'm not sure if it's available anywhere else.
7259840	7262880	It seems you can use almost anything for a controller.
7262880	7264440	The button options are pretty wide.
7264640	7267160	You can play it with keyboard and mouse or a controller.
7267360	7270480	The craziest thing is the ability to use a midi turntable to play.
7270480	7271360	Well, that's pretty cool.
7271560	7273840	The game is not as polished as DJ Hero.
7274040	7277000	It almost has this frequency amplitude look, in my opinion.
7277200	7278960	It's a great game and has great music.
7279160	7280720	Ten out of ten recommend.
7280920	7283560	Have any of you heard of it or played it? AJ Twist.
7283760	7286200	I must admit, I'm going to open this.
7286400	7287600	I have not, AJ Twist.
7287800	7290040	I'm going to open it to chat to see if there's any further opinions.
7290240	7292120	Spin Rhythm XD.
7292320	7293200	Yeah, I've heard of it.
7293200	7294200	Oh, you have heard of it?
7294400	7295320	It's on my wish list.
7295320	7298120	I just haven't bothered to buy it because I know I'm not going to actually play any of it.
7298320	7300680	But yeah, it looks pretty cool.
7300880	7305920	I think it does work with the DJ Hero controllers, too, if you have that in there.
7306120	7311360	But yeah, pretty much any sort of like midi or just any sort of like
7311560	7315240	turntable or dial or something that you use it because the way that works,
7315240	7317440	there's like an actual
7317640	7321440	a bar that basically you're just moving back and forth between the different
7321640	7326120	lanes in there and you can, you know, spin everything around and stuff.
7326320	7327160	It looks pretty cool.
7327360	7329600	I just think that
7329800	7331400	probably wouldn't play it.
7331600	7332480	I'll have to check it out.
7332480	7333520	I almost picked it up in the last sale.
7333720	7335800	I'm very curious about the music because
7335800	7338600	I imagine a fifteen dollar game probably didn't license music.
7338600	7341080	So it probably is more like twenty bucks right now.
7341280	7342560	So, I mean, it's...
7342760	7344760	Did they license music or is it original artists?
7344800	7347000	Not that that's bad, but
7347200	7350680	part of part of what made DJ Hero very
7350880	7356120	appealing was that the mashup mixes were A plus like that.
7356320	7357360	What was it was Mary J.
7357560	7362240	Blige, All of Me and Queen's Radio Gaga is still like just like just like a song
7362440	7365640	that I love, like that mashup is so stinking good in that game.
7365840	7368720	There's a lot of like great mashups in that game.
7368920	7371240	But obviously that took some big record
7371240	7375400	label maneuvering from a huge ass company like Activision to make happen.
7375600	7380080	So, again, I'm not I'm all about indie artists too and up and comers and so forth.
7380280	7383800	So I'd be just curious to hear how the songs are.
7384000	7389200	OK, so like some of the like artists I recognize on this list, which probably is
7389400	7391440	not going to be very many, Tokyo Machine.
7391640	7394400	So they did a lot of stuff and they have Beat Saber.
7394600	7397040	And, of course, in
7397240	7398840	Oh, God.
7399720	7403480	How's that really popular game?
7404320	7405560	I can't remember.
7405760	7408800	Anyways, yeah, Beat Saber, I know they have some songs in there.
7409000	7410200	Rocket League, that's what I'm saying.
7410400	7412720	Sorry. And
7413520	7415360	what else? So the other artists that they
7415560	7420240	mentioned on here, Rogue, Nitro Fun, Hyper Potions, Tut Tut Child, Panda Eyes,
7420440	7424440	Terminite, Pegboard Nerds, Tristem, Bracken.
7424640	7425880	I haven't heard of a lot of these.
7426040	7428640	A Tokyo Machine is the only one I know and their songs are awesome.
7428640	7431080	So, OK, but it's like it's like other it's
7431280	7434200	folks that have either they're indie completely and this is their first
7434400	7437120	experience or like they were artists for other games.
7437120	7438840	That's pretty cool, though.
7439040	7442520	Yeah, Rocket League has a sweet soundtrack, so that's cool.
7442720	7443920	Some comments from chat.
7444120	7447800	Tiger Claw says, I have a real live version of DJ Hero and I mean, I have an actual
7447800	7450320	DJ controller. I play with it from time to time when I
7450320	7452360	want to play around with my music to see how they mix.
7452560	7456440	Well, speaking of music, mixing that harmonics game is on the horizon, too.
7456440	7458000	I mean, that's not really a DJ Hero game.
7458200	7460680	It's their card game adapted for consoles.
7460680	7463720	But I think people are going to have fun doing mashups with that.
7463920	7467280	Anything with Carly Rae Jepsen songs is going to be a blast.
7467480	7469000	Can you name anybody more perfect?
7469000	7471080	I'll wait. OK, I'm done waiting.
7471280	7472120	Moving on.
7472320	7474720	We also have Dark Tetsuya says, I've heard of it.
7474760	7475720	It seems cool.
7475920	7479000	I just need to get a hold of my turntable controller.
7479200	7480880	And let's see.
7482920	7485080	I thought there was another comment on that, but that's all I see in the moment.
7485280	7487640	So, yeah, it sounds like a neat game to me.
7487640	7490000	I'm probably going to check it out based on your email recommendations.
7490000	7491280	So thank you for the email, AJ Twist.
7491480	7494680	Appreciate that. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
7494880	7497600	if you want to send us an email for a future week.
7497800	7501880	In the meantime, let's move on to some other stories.
7502080	7503160	Loki.
7503360	7507440	Yes, so one of the other kind of digital
7507640	7512040	things that they did this week was with Google Stadium making more announcements
7512080	7514720	about their console.
7514920	7517400	So the Stadia Connect event,
7517600	7521600	they did talk about some more games coming to the platform.
7521800	7528560	So Forks Must Die 3, which was supposed to be free with Stadia Pro.
7528760	7534640	They did announce that Super Bomberman R Online is coming.
7534840	7539520	So it's like a Bomberman battle royale game with 64 players.
7539720	7541280	And then
7541480	7546040	I want to say that they also had announced that there's a new harmonics game coming
7546240	7548320	to the platform, which is kind of interesting.
7548520	7553520	And then also Uppercut Games, which did City of Brass.
7553720	7558080	And then Supermassive Games, who are behind Until Dawn.
7559160	7563320	I'm curious to see how the harmonics stuff works out, considering that it's going to
7563520	7566480	really have to be low latency to do a music game.
7566920	7571280	Yeah, that's a pretty gutsy thing to put on a system like Stadia.
7571280	7574720	But having played a little bit of Stadia in those first couple of months,
7574920	7576640	thanks to the buddy pass that Mr.
7576840	7581520	Blackwolf gave me, I was playing things like Destiny and Thumper.
7581520	7583600	I remember playing, which is kind of a music game.
7583800	7585000	It's not quite as intense.
7585200	7588240	I want to say it's not quite as intense,
7588240	7592280	but actually it's probably more intense because it's like a music horror game.
7592400	7595880	But you know what I mean? Like the accuracy isn't quite, it's a little different.
7595880	7597360	You have a little room for error in that game.
7597560	7602400	But my point is, both of those games played pretty darn well, all things considered.
7602600	7608200	So it's almost like, and has Harmonix developed a non-music game?
7608400	7610680	And I think they did an itoy game.
7610880	7613240	I think they did the itoy skater game.
7613440	7617920	But that was like 20 years ago, 15 years ago, a long time ago.
7618120	7620200	Yeah, I can't think of any.
7620400	7620800	Yeah.
7620800	7622600	So
7622800	7627040	now they could be doing something a little more like the drop mix
7627240	7629320	fuser or whatever they're calling it on console.
7629520	7632640	They could be doing something more like that that maybe doesn't have the strict timing.
7632840	7638120	But it could be a very interesting flex for Stadia to have something that requires
7638320	7642480	precise timing and it works well. And honestly,
7642680	7648600	any comments I've had about Stadia really aren't about the technology.
7648640	7650840	The technology is good.
7651040	7654400	It's a good technology.
7654600	7657840	It's just going to be like, all I'm saying is like come Thursday,
7658040	7664840	if even if they weren't like Microsoft wasn't announcing free online or whatever,
7665040	7671280	it's still a hard sell already when you've got their library,
7671480	7674440	hundreds of games that are part of Games Pass.
7674480	7680000	It's almost the same price as the Stadia cost.
7680200	7685040	Plus, I would trust Microsoft more with purchases than I would Google,
7685240	7688400	just because this platform is relatively new.
7688600	7696000	Google has the tradition of shuttering a lot of these platforms early on if they
7696200	7699360	feel that they're not being popular.
7699560	7700960	I just
7701680	7703520	am having a hard time.
7703720	7707440	I know these announcements, they want to make me believe that Google
7707640	7710600	is going to invest in this for the long haul and so forth.
7710800	7712920	And again, we still haven't even had
7713120	7716960	the rollout of Stadia in the browser boom for everyone.
7716960	7719800	I think many of us suspected we would have that by now.
7720000	7724400	I don't know if Covid is to blame or some type of underestimation of the project is
7724400	7726240	to blame or a combination of those things.
7726440	7728720	Whatever point is, we don't have it yet.
7728720	7730360	And I think many of us thought we would.
7730520	7732920	This announcement about Harmonix and
7733120	7738160	the folks behind Until Dawn making games for Stadia, that is very exciting news.
7738360	7742720	This is news we should have had a year ago when they first unveiled things,
7742920	7746280	whether they've been sitting on it or whether these deals were recently inked.
7746480	7748200	I suppose we'll never know.
7748400	7752600	But I feel like this news is going to get lost.
7752800	7754400	This news is going to get really lost.
7754400	7756640	Like you said, Microsoft's got a big event this week.
7756840	7758520	Sony's got PlayStation five.
7758520	7760680	I feel like this news without any type of
7760680	7764640	footage or anything or something to really get us pumped up is going to get lost.
7764840	7766520	And people are going to forget.
7766720	7769440	Some of the other games that they're talking about coming to the platform are
7769440	7771960	obviously games that have been out for a little bit already.
7772160	7774680	So we have PGA Tour 2K21.
7774880	7778840	OK, I'm going to stop you right there, because let's be let's be real.
7779040	7781040	Let's be completely real.
7781360	7782200	This doesn't matter.
7782400	7787880	Like old games and we're releasing shit that already came out a year or two ago.
7788040	7789240	It's not going to matter.
7789440	7791280	Like, is anybody is anybody going to be
7791480	7794760	buying stuff on Stadia that they've already bought two years ago?
7794960	7798640	No, no. And so sorry, I don't mean to disrespect you,
7798640	7801840	Loki, or the news you're trying to read, but I think the reality is that this news
7802040	7807000	doesn't matter and this is this is the problem that we you had right out the gate.
7807200	7808560	What are our launch titles?
7808760	7811200	A bunch of shit from two years ago.
7812280	7815600	So right, and I just don't know how they make themselves relevant.
7815600	7818440	I thought that with, you know,
7818640	7822960	having it's really like I said, back when I was talking about choosing consoles,
7822960	7826480	you know, it's really the exclusives that are going to bring it to the platform.
7826680	7830000	And then having the vast library will kind of keep you there as well.
7830200	7833960	I just don't see the exclusives for Stadia.
7834160	7835640	It just seems like a fad.
7835840	7840480	And honestly, by the time they get it right, it's going to be too late, I think.
7840680	7844240	Yeah, I'm I'm really worried about Stadia from that perspective, too.
7844280	7848520	Like we we should already have the Stadia for everybody.
7848720	7853320	I don't I mean, I don't understand why we're still waiting on that
7853520	7857920	because technically they're kind of giving out pro for free because like you can get
7857920	7860000	that trial or whatever and you can play it in your browser.
7860200	7863640	Like they need to stop making it like, oh, you're signing up for a pro.
7863640	7865200	They need to make it like you just you're
7865200	7867760	logging into your Google account and it has Stadia on it.
7867960	7872160	Like it's like it's drive like Google Drive or Google Docs or whatever.
7872200	7876720	Like it's just Stadia is one of those things you can just go like they need to,
7876920	7878760	you know, and I realize, oh, it could be a bandwidth thing.
7878760	7882960	It could be like we're past the time where it should have already been something
7883160	7887000	that everybody can just easily access every day that we don't have.
7887000	7889400	That Stadia is going to fall further and further behind.
7889600	7890560	That's the reality.
7890760	7892480	And these game announcements,
7892680	7896560	especially the stuff that's years old that people have already bought or got for free.
7896680	7897880	How many of the games that they've
7897880	7902160	announced on Stadia has Epic Games Store already given away for free?
7902360	7903520	Quite a few.
7903720	7907000	Like the two of the games that they had on there were hit me at one at two.
7907000	7908400	I guarantee I have those.
7908600	7911800	I'm pretty sure I've got those on multiple platforms already.
7912000	7917400	Yeah. And the Tomb Raider series, I'm almost positive, was free on Square.
7917600	7919880	Square Enix gave it away, I think, at the beginning of the covid stuff.
7920080	7923280	So my point is, yeah, and that's that's why I cut off you
7923280	7925920	reading the list is because these announcements don't matter.
7926120	7927280	They don't mean anything.
7927480	7931120	Most people already have played these games or they're already in their library.
7931320	7932400	And this is scraps.
7932600	7935640	And Stadia is not going to survive off scraps.
7935840	7937840	And it's a bummer because, again,
7938040	7941280	any complaint I've ever had about Stadia isn't the technology.
7941480	7945680	If you actually go through the hoops to check it out and play Destiny 2,
7945880	7949400	it kind of works and it's pretty cool.
7949600	7956440	But how long is that going to sustain the idea of give Stadia money?
7956600	7958720	I don't know. Not at all for me.
7958920	7960040	Yeah, same here.
7960240	7962160	Running out of time. All right.
7962160	7965960	Well, one game that's managed to keep going for years and years and years is
7965960	7968880	Minecraft, right, Loki? Minecraft had the right idea, right?
7969080	7972240	So now I get Loki.
7972240	7974760	You might have to give me some background on this because I'm not totally
7974760	7978720	understanding like why this is like huge news, but it is circulating around game
7978920	7984000	blogs and stuff, and that is that the Minecraft title screen
7984200	7986400	apparently shows a world in the background.
7986400	7987120	We all knew that.
7987320	7990640	I always thought it was just a random fucking world each and every time.
7990640	7991320	But apparently not.
7991520	7993640	It's the same world every time.
7993840	7995960	And they have just discovered this week.
7996160	8001720	If you want to play in the title screen world, here is the seed.
8001720	8003160	And there's actually two seeds.
8003360	8004440	So spoiler alert.
8004560	8007720	See, I would have thought the seed would have been something like
8007920	8013160	Microsoft rules or something like somebody's cat name or something like that.
8013320	8018800	No, no, the seed is two one five one nine zero one five five three nine six eight
8018800	8021720	three five two seven four all of the seeds are converted to numeric.
8021920	8025600	So whether you type in Microsoft rules or whatever like that, you know,
8025800	8028640	it would still be it converts it down to that.
8028840	8030240	OK, that I would have known.
8030240	8031160	So thank you.
8031360	8033600	What they were doing is like
8033800	8038080	once again, it's a lot of time being wasted on this stuff there.
8038080	8041680	They had algorithms and stuff that they were trying to figure out what the seed
8041680	8047760	was to find the world and based on the generation that was there,
8047960	8053040	chunk generation and where the different objects were in there.
8053240	8056320	And so they were basing that trying to figure out, you know,
8056520	8060240	how to find the actual seed that is shown in those screenshots.
8060440	8065000	They did something similar not too long ago with PewDiePie with his seed
8065200	8068840	that he was playing in his world because they wanted to play the same one.
8069040	8070280	I don't know. It's time.
8070440	8072000	People got a lot of time nowadays.
8072200	8074520	And so just now you can check it out.
8074720	8077320	Just think you could have found a cure for covid.
8077520	8081000	But no, you found the Minecraft title screen seed.
8081200	8082280	No, I should look.
8082480	8085160	I've spent 18 years of my life doing a podcast.
8085160	8086120	I have no room to judge.
8086320	8088040	Yeah, it is the blurry image.
8088240	8093240	And then they found the exact spot in the exact world to actually check it out.
8093240	8094640	I mean, it's kind of cool that they are
8094840	8099200	able to find that amongst the billions of levels or worlds that could be generated.
8099360	8101520	Yeah. And, you know, the versions
8101720	8106120	now have to change the screenshot and then figure it out all over again.
8106320	8111000	All jokes aside, like the science behind it and how they discovered it is pretty
8111000	8114680	cool, you know, we have to rip it a little bit because it's like all that time you
8114680	8116560	spent doing X, you could have been doing Y.
8116760	8119360	But the fact that they did use these kind
8119360	8123200	of unconventional techniques to figure it out and it's like this is this is this is
8123400	8127320	what we want and we're going to find it, they found it good for them.
8127480	8129680	Now, go cure Covid.
8131760	8132960	All right.
8133160	8136680	Anyhow, moving on, Loki, what do you have for us?
8136880	8138040	So this is kind of fun.
8138240	8143200	So there is a a little indie game that someone made
8143400	8148040	that's kind of like WarioWare, but with like a horror trope twist to it.
8148240	8154200	So this game Spookware by Adam Pipe is a it's 10 micro games.
8154400	8156120	They're all themed around horror stuff.
8156120	8160400	So it's different things like, you know, moving
8160600	8165760	with the reader across the Ouija board, you know, sawing a leg in half,
8165960	8170280	finding the missing letters and like a Slenderman type of thing.
8170480	8175240	And you use the arrow keys on your keyboard to play the game.
8175440	8178520	And it's very authentic to WarioWare.
8178520	8179320	It's pretty awesome.
8179320	8181480	So what's great, though, is you can check it out.
8181680	8183880	It is free.
8184080	8190040	It's taken him 24 months or I'm sorry, it's game a month.
8190040	8191040	So he created in a month.
8191040	8193000	He's done this for 24 months straight, though.
8193200	8195440	So it's his 24th one they put together.
8195640	8199440	If you want to check it out, it's papercookies.itch.io
8199640	8203160	slash Spookware and it looks pretty cool.
8203280	8204040	You got to play it.
8204160	8205120	Yeah, I want to check that out.
8205320	8206480	That was really cool.
8206680	8212280	I love WarioWare, which is why I enjoy super multitasking by YYR.
8212480	8213560	But no, seriously, I do.
8213760	8215360	I love the WarioWare games.
8215560	8219720	And so and that's always also one of those franchises where I'm like, God,
8219720	8222320	I wish Nintendo would bring this back because it's been a while since I've had
8222320	8223800	one of those games, been a long while.
8224000	8228080	And I feel like the last game we got was just a rehash of one of the old games.
8228280	8229720	Yeah, it's cool.
8229920	8234800	It's funny, though, is they've got like it's there's some cheesy stuff in there.
8235000	8239480	It's very much got the same like feeling of WarioWare game.
8239680	8241360	Like, for example, the one where it's
8241440	8245600	kind of gross, where you're like sawing a leg in half that's on a chopping board
8245800	8248240	with a chainsaw, though, but you're sawing it like a knife.
8248440	8249800	It's all what's for dinner.
8250000	8252560	And it's like dinner is served.
8252760	8256000	Or like they have what they have another one where it's like a dark room.
8256200	8257960	It's like, where's Nosferatu?
8258160	8261400	You find his face and there he is.
8261600	8262840	It's still like stuff like that.
8262840	8266200	It's kind of funny, as long as it's like silly and comical and like, you know,
8266400	8269400	and I've talked about this with horror a lot.
8269560	8273760	I don't I'm not into the very realistic looking horror stuff.
8273960	8277520	But when it's like Disney's Haunted Mansion or like Elvira,
8277520	8280720	like Darsaka went over earlier, like that macabre type of stuff,
8280920	8283280	that stuff I think is great and I eat it up.
8283280	8286800	I think that stuff is the Addams Family, like one of the all times greatest.
8287000	8288120	I think that shit is great.
8288320	8289760	Like that. That's awesome.
8289760	8291640	It's the stuff that's like too realistic.
8291760	8293320	So it's like, where's Nosferatu?
8293520	8295000	And it's cartoony and stuff.
8295200	8296520	I think that would be funny.
8296680	8300280	Yeah, it's it's very much looks like a Warrior War game.
8300280	8301800	OK, that's that's cool.
8301800	8302960	I want to check it out. I will.
8302960	8304520	That's that's cool. All right.
8304520	8306400	Did you say it was free or is it a small?
8306400	8308120	It's free. Yeah. Oh, that's awesome.
8308320	8309720	That's even better.
8309920	8310680	All right.
8310880	8314680	One more free upgrade for owners of this game.
8314680	8317240	And I feel like this is a game Loki probably owns.
8317440	8318840	I did it one time.
8319040	8320760	I don't know if I still do.
8320960	8322600	Let me check my Steam library.
8322760	8326960	Worms Armageddon came out over 20 years ago.
8326960	8330920	And of course, the Worms franchise kind of came from those old tank war games
8330920	8334760	from the 60s, from the 60s, from the 90s,
8335680	8338200	those early TV titles
8338200	8342520	when there was just zeros and ones and blips played on my telescope.
8344360	8346280	So from the 90s, things like what was it?
8346280	8347920	Tank Wars and Scorched Earth.
8347920	8350040	Those are the games. Can you play?
8350040	8352480	We played it with real worms and real grenades.
8352560	8353480	We need to do.
8353480	8357640	Loki, you and I need to play Scorched Earth on a live stream someday.
8357840	8360800	We do. That would be fun.
8361000	8363560	Do they can you even run it at normal speed anymore?
8363560	8367440	Would it go like I'm sure they've got like there's also Tank Wars and stuff.
8367640	8370000	I'm sure there's an online version of that.
8370080	8371320	Oh, God, I've got to find that.
8371320	8373120	We've got to make that happen some night anyway.
8373320	8375800	But Worms was kind of like an evolution of that stuff.
8375800	8378280	Right. Where instead of tanks, it became worms.
8378440	8383640	And in celebration of twenty five years of the entire franchise,
8383920	8388880	developer Team 17 put out an update for Worms Armageddon on the PC.
8389160	8392960	Seven years worth of fixes, changes and improvements.
8393160	8395240	The announcement was made on Twitter and Steam.
8395240	8400800	There's a new three point eight update for the 1999 release Worms Armageddon.
8401520	8405760	And there's some of the fan improvements and fixes, some mod features
8405920	8407800	and are now integrated into the game.
8407840	8411680	For example, somebody named Rubber Worm in the I'm sorry,
8411680	8413600	that's one of the mods or the actual mod names.
8413800	8416720	It was a popular Armageddon mod that lets you manipulate the physics
8416720	8418760	and fire multiple weapons in a single turn.
8418880	8420480	And so now that's in the official game.
8420720	8421840	So that's pretty cool.
8421840	8425080	That's a real neat fan love letter is that you know what?
8425080	8428440	We are going to embrace these fan mods now as official canon.
8428640	8429880	That's pretty cool.
8429880	8432560	And we're seeing developers do that more and more like we kind of saw that
8432560	8437120	with the recent Doom rerelease on like PlayStation four and stuff
8437120	8441960	where like the big user community wads are like right there in the game
8441960	8443920	and you can just install them for free and play them.
8444080	8445040	I think that's really rad.
8445200	8448560	So, yeah, that I love this like community,
8448760	8452000	the developers embracing the modding community like this is really cool.
8453400	8455600	Can't wait for the rerelease of Mass Effect.
8455600	8459200	That's just going to embrace the H the high res texture mods
8459480	8461640	that are already out there.
8461640	8463840	We'll see. All right.
8463840	8466640	Anyhow, pretty cool. I like that.
8466880	8469640	All right. This is the part of the show where we're going to open up
8469640	8472520	our chat room for any questions or any topics we didn't get to tonight.
8472720	8474680	So if you have anything you want to bring to the listener roundtable,
8474680	8480200	twitch.tv slash vog network and Hype Mayhem is always like on it, ready to go.
8480200	8482240	I love it. Hype Mayhem says questions.
8482240	8485480	Seeing that digital games are prevalent nowadays, especially on PC,
8485720	8489160	our physical games, their cases, boxes and any extras included.
8489160	8492320	See, special editions have any place or relevancy nowadays.
8492560	8495400	People used to love displaying their games and stuff on shelves
8495400	8496520	for the longest time.
8496520	8500680	But nowadays, people love the freebies on Epic or the seasonal Steam GOG sales.
8500960	8503200	Plus, there's a subscription stuff, too.
8503200	8505880	Has displaying your collection gone the way of the dodo?
8506640	8508200	Excellent question.
8508200	8513720	And one that comes up often on gaming shows and the community
8513720	8516920	these days is like, are we really ready to go all digital?
8516920	8520160	And the simplest answer to this question is that there's always
8520160	8522880	there's just there's just always going to be both.
8522880	8525680	And you see a company like Limited Run Games.
8525880	8527800	And we talked about them on the show a couple of weeks ago.
8527920	8531240	They're doing all these limited runs like that
8531240	8535600	Shante game on the Game Boy Color that group is rereleasing, for God's sake.
8535600	8538400	Like they're doing a lot of physical releases.
8538400	8541720	So there is always going to be a call for collectibles.
8542000	8545200	And I've brought up this analogy on OLR before.
8545200	8547200	It's been a bit, so I'll bring it up again.
8547200	8549760	We're not really like an analogy, but but the fact that
8550320	8554720	the physical games that you own end up having equity. Right.
8555640	8558480	And I don't like to go and buy games digitally
8558760	8562480	unless there's some type of trade off, because essentially, if I buy digitally,
8562480	8565960	I'm giving up that equity because you can't trade your digital games.
8566280	8569880	So if Epic is going to give me a free game, well, shit,
8569880	8572000	that's a good way to make me let go of equity.
8572000	8574160	Give it to me for free. Right.
8574160	8576520	And so that's what a lot of people have done with their digital collections.
8577560	8579520	And now things are getting to a point.
8579520	8581760	I think there's a lot of people who are finding themselves
8581760	8584320	more and more inconvenienced with physical media.
8584680	8588040	For example, I think about Bobby Blackwolf and the setup in his house.
8588880	8593000	And sorry, Bobby, I don't mean to speak for you, but if I lived in your house,
8593280	8596320	I would imagine when I want to play games down there in that basement,
8596880	8599760	it would actually be kind of a pain in the ass to have physical media.
8599760	8602960	Sometimes it would be much easier to just have games digital
8603120	8605960	so I could kind of like flip between them there, because like getting up
8605960	8608880	to open the door that has the consoles in it and all that stuff
8609120	8611880	might end up being a little bit of a pain.
8611880	8615120	So you might give up your equity because you kind of know
8615120	8618160	I'm never going to sell these games back, whatever, and that whole thing.
8620480	8623800	But also something that's kind of driven me back to physical,
8623800	8625600	like I was kind of at this point where I was like,
8625600	8628920	I'm buying more and more digital, like I just bought Animal Crossing digital.
8628920	8632280	I pop Pokemon digital because I'm like, these are types of games
8632280	8634080	that you just want to kind of always have available
8634080	8636760	and you don't want to have to switch a cartridge in and out or anything like that.
8636760	8640560	So, you know, like there's there's that.
8642200	8644280	But then Alan got a switch, too.
8645280	8647480	And now it's like, well, wait a minute,
8647480	8650120	I don't really want to buy digital games because Alan can't play them
8650120	8651920	if I buy them digitally.
8651920	8655040	So now I'm back to I want to get physical releases
8655320	8658400	so that he can play them, too, if he if he would play anything else
8658400	8660400	besides Dark Souls and Animal Crossing.
8660400	8662720	But that's what makes him happy. So whatever.
8662720	8665520	But it does make me think, well, maybe he'll want to play Zelda someday
8665520	8667080	or maybe he'll want to play his other game someday.
8667080	8669360	So I should probably get it on physical media.
8669360	8671720	So there's that, too.
8671720	8673920	And Bobby does clarify.
8674080	8677600	Yes, I still like my physical media because of my data cap.
8677600	8679320	That's a very good point, too.
8679320	8680480	Marissa Mizell in chat.
8680480	8684440	Hi, Marissa says my Internet connection is awful, so I still like physical,
8684440	8687560	but I also like owning the product and not licensing it.
8688240	8690200	Tiger Claw talks about shelf space.
8690200	8692720	You might not have enough space to store all your physical media.
8692960	8694320	That's why we joke about.
8694320	8697240	I don't have any room for a shelf to have shelf space.
8697280	8700440	Well, and that's why we joke about Dark Sakura's vault. Right.
8700480	8703680	She has a lot of physical stuff from especially from back in the day
8703680	8704720	in the older systems.
8704720	8708880	But at one point, there was literally an entire room in her house dedicated to it.
8708920	8710720	That's how much space it took up.
8710720	8713800	There's a very old YouTube, very, very old YouTube video out there
8713800	8715560	on the channel Orange Lounge Radio.
8715560	8717720	If you didn't know, it's like very old.
8717720	8720400	But we actually show Dark Sakura's old vault in one of the videos.
8720400	8722440	So that's out there.
8723280	8725640	DJ Rama S says, I'm OK with buying digital,
8725640	8727880	but not when it's the same price as the physical release.
8727880	8728800	Yeah, there's that.
8728800	8731200	And that's that's the equity, right?
8731200	8734960	Like, what am I what am I getting digital but physical?
8734960	8738040	I'll have something that I could technically give, sell back or give out
8738040	8740240	or, you know, trade or what have you.
8740480	8744800	So I think the answer to that is really going to be different for everybody.
8744960	8747280	And for me, it is.
8747280	8750360	I'll go digital if there's a good reason for me to go digital.
8750840	8753800	Otherwise, excuse me, otherwise I still tend to go physical,
8754120	8757360	especially with Nintendo Switch, those cartridges are like itty bitty.
8757360	8758920	They don't take up shelf space.
8758920	8761880	I do. I keep all the boxes somewhere, but then I have my little purse,
8761880	8764320	my switch purse that has all my games in it.
8764600	8767280	And it's not going to fill up anytime soon because those cartridges are itty bitty.
8768120	8772480	So anything you want to add to that, Loki, about the whole digital versus physical?
8773280	8777000	Oh, I just I always thought I wasn't going to do mostly digital as well.
8777600	8781360	But then, you know, that ended up being the complete opposite.
8781360	8785040	So, yeah, really, for me, a lot of times
8785200	8789080	the sales seem to be more frequent on the digital stuff.
8789480	8791760	And a lot of the stuff I get is also only digital,
8791840	8794280	but it's also more convenient to like,
8794800	8797200	you know, the local game style closed down over here.
8797200	8801440	So, I mean, I could order from Amazon or something like that,
8801440	8804600	but it's just it's easier to know.
8804600	8807120	I don't have to worry about it coming in the mail.
8807680	8809720	It's usually available 9 p.m.
8809720	8811760	the night before it's supposed to release.
8811760	8818280	So I just I don't see myself going out and trading in stuff as much as I used to.
8818280	8822880	And even when I was it, you don't get anything for it.
8822880	8826080	And yeah, I know you could go sell stuff on eBay, but that's a hassle.
8826120	8830560	So for me, it's just the time saved is more valuable than the
8831720	8834280	money I might make back from selling something.
8834600	8838360	All right. I'll open it up to chat to see if there's any other questions.
8838360	8841160	In the meantime, while we see if there's any other discussion topics,
8841720	8844200	Loki, I usually open it up for any last minute stories you might have.
8844840	8848120	Yeah. So there's going to be a Dragon's Dogma anime series.
8848120	8851320	It's going to be coming to Netflix September 17th.
8851640	8854600	That's interesting, you know, considering that Castlevania has done well.
8855320	8859960	I'd be interested to see how this one fares as well, but be pretty cool.
8860000	8861840	I'm not very familiar with the series.
8861840	8867200	I know it's kind of similar to, I think, Skyrim or an Elder Scrolls type of game.
8867200	8871520	But I think the other side from just the adventuring and the fantasy stuff like that,
8871520	8873120	it's probably pretty different.
8873120	8877440	But as that is that is excited in chat saying, ah, best game.
8878480	8880800	So, yeah, be cool. I can't wait to see it.
8881680	8885320	Yeah, the success of things like The Witcher and Castlevania, man, it's just
8885320	8890760	it's going to make this video game stuff on on demand services really explode.
8891160	8894360	I'm so hyped for Final Fantasy 14 whenever they get that going.
8894360	8896120	Like, obviously, Covid has that stock right now.
8896120	8900120	But, you know, back in the day, you know, when it's like, oh, the video game adaptation.
8900120	8905560	Oh, you know, now it's like, oh, hey, people, they finally get it now.
8905560	8907800	They they they know how to do it right.
8909960	8913720	All right. I have to read this comment from She-Hulk in chat because it's the best reason
8913720	8915400	against physical media.
8915400	8919080	When I have a cat in my lap, I cannot get up to change the disk.
8920040	8921000	Good thinking, She-Hulk.
8924200	8929400	Marissa is telling a story about how iTunes removed some TVs and movies because the publisher,
8929400	8931880	I guess, had pulled the material off iTunes.
8931880	8935560	So that is kind of scary, too, when the digital license gets revoked to physical media.
8935560	8937800	Sometimes the only way you can kind of keep things.
8937800	8940680	That's it's rare, but it does happen.
8940680	8942280	I've heard of that with video games, too.
8943400	8947640	It's typically, you know, well, that was all different.
8947800	8949320	I know a little bit of it.
8950200	8954840	Typically, though, when they're removing stuff off of a service like not they're just not
8954840	8958040	selling it anymore, but you'd still have access to your digital copies.
8958040	8964120	It's very rare that they ever remove it completely from your library.
8964120	8966120	Yeah, but I can understand not wanting to take a chance.
8966120	8966920	I get that.
8967480	8967980	Yeah.
8968600	8973480	It's happened a lot with different like Ninja Turtles, for example, has had it where the
8973480	8975320	rights have gone away.
8975320	8978840	And they've also done it with other things where they'll even mark down the game to,
8978840	8983480	like, a ridiculously low price because they know that they're pulling the rights to it
8983480	8984120	pretty soon.
8984120	8984620	So.
8986200	8989720	Oh, this is a dark to see you found a free version of scorched earth online.
8989720	8992440	Can you tweet me that link dark to see because I'll lose it in the chat.
8992440	8993160	So thank you.
8993160	8993960	I want to check that out.
8994520	8995320	OK, sorry, lucky.
8995960	8999560	I was going to say some other things, though, that we've seen is not necessarily and that
8999560	9000200	link doesn't work.
9001160	9011480	Is that not only does we have games removed from your library, but also like games alter,
9011480	9016280	like, for example, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and even Grand Theft Auto four have had like
9016280	9017800	music taken out of the game.
9017800	9018520	Good call.
9018520	9019640	The music change.
9019640	9020840	Yeah, the license.
9020840	9024440	Yeah, there's not much you can do that with the games constantly updating.
9024440	9029000	So, yeah, you know, and that discussion is coming up again when we're talking about Xbox
9029000	9034600	backwards compatibility is that Microsoft will not commit to the full library being
9034600	9037880	backwards backwards compatible from Xbox one on Series X.
9038440	9042040	It sounds like there will be some rare games that will not be backwards compatible.
9042040	9043800	And it doesn't sound like it's a technology thing.
9043800	9047000	It sounds like it's a licensing thing, like something in that realm.
9047000	9051160	Like and I don't know this for sure, but it is an example.
9051800	9053480	Something like Rock Band 4.
9054280	9058040	I could see where maybe they're not going to let that play on the new one because of
9058040	9060040	like music and licensing and those types of things.
9060040	9065800	Again, not that I've heard that game specifically, but I could see where, oh, maybe that's going
9065800	9066920	to complicate it.
9066920	9067560	It's interesting.
9069080	9069320	Yeah.
9070120	9070440	All right.
9071080	9072360	Any other last minute stories for us?
9074840	9076360	No, that's pretty much it.
9076360	9076840	All right.
9076840	9081320	Then I think we are good to wrap up and get our final thoughts out.
9081320	9084440	Hey, I want to thank you guys for listening and participating with Orange Launch Radio
9084440	9085240	tonight.
9085240	9086120	Thank you so much.
9086200	9089400	If you liked what you heard here at the show, help us spread the message.
9089400	9092920	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the gamers voices aren't here to put
9092920	9096120	out on the air, then what can we do?
9096120	9097480	Tell a friend or two about the show.
9097480	9100760	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
9101400	9105320	And again, I want to thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening, whether it was
9105320	9108680	on the podcast feed or if it was on our Twitch feed.
9108680	9112200	Either way, just thank you for being here and being a part of our Sunday nights.
9112200	9117400	And I hope we, uh, made for some good entertainment on your Sunday night or Monday afternoon,
9117400	9119880	whenever you're listening to this, um, super appreciate it.
9120440	9127800	My final thought for tonight is, um, you guys didn't get to see it on the Twitch stream
9127800	9131000	because the discord is in the way, but I'll switch the shot real quick.
9131000	9134360	So there's this little basket here on the couch.
9134360	9138520	And I was really hoping because earlier today, about two or three o'clock, Mr.
9138520	9143800	Smoosh climbed up in this basket and I got from work and was sitting there and actually
9143800	9147400	Smoosh was sitting there until like five 30.
9147400	9151560	It was about halfway through Bobby show when he finally got up to leave.
9151560	9153880	I guess, I guess he didn't care for the Bobby black Wolf show.
9153880	9154360	I don't know.
9154360	9158280	It wasn't that it was, he just, he'd been there for hours and I think he knew his food
9158280	9160760	thing was going to go off soon because it goes off at six o'clock.
9160760	9164440	So I knew he wouldn't make it to OLR, but I thought I might get him for the Bobby call,
9164440	9166440	but apparently, uh, sadly I didn't.
9166440	9167720	So I was hoping he'd come back.
9168280	9170600	So I'm going to hope in a future week, I'm going to leave this.
9170600	9176360	So you might all be wondering why is there a basket mixed in with all the video game
9176360	9177960	crap that we have on the couch?
9177960	9179560	Why is a basket suddenly mixed in?
9179560	9183560	That is going to be the answer because I'm, this is Smoosh's throne and I'm waiting for
9183560	9185960	him to come back and have a seat.
9185960	9189400	And yes, I did tweet a picture earlier and Tiger Claw dug that up there.
9189400	9191480	So you can check out that picture if you want.
9191480	9191720	All right.
9191720	9192920	That's my very long final thought.
9192920	9193800	Loki, your final thought.
9193800	9199720	Oh, um, I did remember there was one story that I didn't talk about, but, um, it's kind
9199720	9206760	of a given since there's a lot of other retailers doing this, but mandating masks, um, the apparently
9206760	9212040	GameStop is going to be, um, putting out notices on their doors saying that they're requiring
9212040	9215800	masks in shop, but they're not allowing the employees to enforce that.
9217080	9221720	So, you know, that's a thing, I guess it's a dangerous situation.
9221720	9225240	Like, I can't believe I'm going to defend this because I fully believe people need to
9225240	9229560	be wearing their fucking masks, but they're not paying those employees enough to deal
9229560	9230360	with that bullshit.
9230360	9235880	Well, I need, I need to watch my words because at the same time, those employees shouldn't
9235880	9237800	be exposed to COVID in the first place.
9237800	9240440	So I hope they have some type of glass thing set up.
9240440	9242440	Like you might see the 7-Eleven or something like that.
9242440	9243880	I really, really hope.
9243880	9248120	But at the same time, like those guys just aren't paid enough to like fight with somebody
9248120	9249960	and throw them out of the store and that whole thing.
9249960	9253880	Like people should just be decent enough to wear their masks in the store in the first
9253880	9254440	place, but.
9256040	9256520	Right.
9256520	9258760	And there's a whole, whole other situation.
9258760	9263720	I mean, um, there was other stuff I saw this week too, about talking about pre-orders and
9263720	9264040	everything.
9264040	9268120	And if you have games pre-ordered as store and that store happens to close down, which
9268120	9273000	a lot of them are because they're running, they're having financial problems right now.
9273000	9276200	Um, you're not getting your money back or at least you're not getting your money back
9276200	9277240	without quite a fight.
9277240	9281400	So just keep that in mind when you're pre-ordering stuff, especially with brand new consoles
9281400	9288440	around the corner, that they're going to keep your money unless you drag it out and calling
9288440	9291800	corporates like I do anything because you're just going to be on hold for hours without
9291800	9292600	them picking up.
9292600	9298440	They know fully well that they're doing this and they just don't care because what are
9298440	9299160	you going to do about it?
9299160	9304520	Yeah, that's, that's gonna, GameStop might want to clarify or clear up that policy before
9304520	9309240	they do start because that word is going to spread around social media fast, uh, around
9309240	9313080	the time of one of the things that could be the only thing that keeps GameStop afloat
9313080	9314120	for another year.
9314120	9320600	Um, so if I were GameStop, I would, uh, I would clear that up real fast or they're going
9320600	9324280	to have some people decide to take that pre-order elsewhere.
9324280	9329720	Uh, that's a scary thought, but I feel like their upper management is so dumb.
9329720	9331800	Um, they probably won't even think of that.
9331800	9333800	And that is why GameStop is failing.
9334760	9335000	Yeah.
9335000	9336040	So just be careful.
9336840	9337320	Yeah.
9337320	9337720	All right.
9337720	9338280	Great.
9338280	9338760	Great.
9338760	9340520	Final thought slash last story.
9340520	9341320	All right.
9341320	9342680	Uh, that's it everybody.
9342680	9343560	Thank you, Loki.
9343560	9344600	Thanks Dark Sakura.
9344600	9346840	Thanks you all for being here tonight.
