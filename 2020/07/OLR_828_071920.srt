1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,440
In the year of hindsight, we find ourselves with non-news and weird news.

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,280
Would it surprise you to hear that Sony is ramping up more supply of PlayStation 5s?

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,520
Can you have more when you're already making many?

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,520
Shrug.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,560
Also, Microsoft Flight Simulator's Physical Edition is coming on 10 DVDs because Blu-ray

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,240
won the war but hasn't proliferated outside of devices that connect to your TV.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,080
Tonight, your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki bring you news that would require

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,120
three audio CDs to hold, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:44,680
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,360
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:57,880
It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again tonight with episode number 828 for this July

12
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,480
19th of 2020.

13
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,760
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you live from our studio in Sacramento, California, where

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,880
we would all collaborate usually over the last 18 years in the same room.

15
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,020
But due to the way things are in the world, we're doing a little bit of social distant

16
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,420
recording thanks to the magic of Discord.

17
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,320
So I'm here and joining me on Discord.

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,560
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

19
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,560
Hello.

20
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,560
Hi, how are you?

21
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,560
I don't know.

22
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,560
Maybe I should make it a little bit more obvious.

23
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,400
I am protecting myself from the plague.

24
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,360
I have my plague mask shoved with Rosemary in it right now.

25
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,600
So you're showing off your mask on Twitch, because even though this is a radio podcast

26
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600
—

27
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,600
People can screenshot it.

28
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Yeah, that's true.

29
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
We do tape live —

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,480
And it's low because I've got this damn mask on.

31
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,320
We do tape live every Sunday night at The Voice of the Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash

32
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,740
VOG Network Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby

33
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,740
Blackwell show.

34
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,040
So if you do want to see some of the video, you can join us live or you can subscribe

35
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,080
to us over at VOG Network.

36
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,100
And yeah, I guess the elaborate mask that you're wearing is impacting some of the audio,

37
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,440
but I think we got that now.

38
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,040
I folded the mask under now, so that should be a little bit better.

39
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,840
Oh yeah, that sounds better to me.

40
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,960
So you get the top down view without me covering my mouth.

41
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
Ta-da!

42
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,960
Ta-da!

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,160
I feel now like I should actually have like a gachamon helmet on instead.

44
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,640
Just call me June the swallow.

45
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,800
Some of the comments from our chat room over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, sg100matt

46
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,600
says, the mask protects her from the haters.

47
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Tiger —

48
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
What haters?

49
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,000
Tigerclaws says she should take that mask to work.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,680
Imagine how the coworkers would react, but you're working from home right now.

51
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,680
I work from home.

52
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,680
Exactly.

53
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,680
Yeah.

54
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,960
I mean, this arrived the day after because I had to go in and clean out my desk at work,

55
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,840
which means it's all official now.

56
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,640
If I had this yesterday, the day that I went, I would have worn it, but it actually arrived

57
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,640
yesterday.

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,600
So, oh well.

59
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,320
Was that a friend online who made that?

60
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,640
Yeah, my friend Amber did.

61
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,640
Nice.

62
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,680
And for those that aren't able to see the video, it's kind of like a space type of thing,

63
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,120
but it's against the old school type of plague mask with the big beak.

64
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,280
So a dark Sakura kind of looks like bird Sakura tonight.

65
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,160
Here is a picture on my Twitter from yesterday.

66
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,500
So there you go.

67
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
Good way to —

68
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,760
You got to go hunting for it.

69
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,280
Good way to get the cheap plug in for the Twitter there.

70
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,720
And my Instagram at dark Sakura.

71
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,780
Questbuster in chat says she's ready to treat medieval patients.

72
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,780
That's right.

73
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,040
Yeah, I'm going to give them cocaine.

74
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,160
She's also ready to greet people who misbehave in our chat room tonight.

75
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,960
Any random Twitch trolls beware.

76
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
Speaking of trolls —

77
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,540
I never get trolled.

78
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,600
Also say hello, uh, joining us every week here on the show.

79
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Say hello to tech master.

80
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Loki.

81
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Hello.

82
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Hi, how are you?

83
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,660
I'm doing fine.

84
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,340
And I see tonight you've got some — is that Minecraft going on behind you, like an elaborate?

85
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,340
Yes.

86
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,540
And this is actually a B-roll that I recorded just before the show of my actual server.

87
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,340
So this is all of the stuff that I've built.

88
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,420
I thought you were actually like playing the way you were kind of looking.

89
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,460
I thought you might be like actually playing Minecraft right now while doing the show.

90
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,840
Technically, yes, I was playing Minecraft at the time to record that.

91
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,860
So this is like, for example, the second or third floor in my basement with the automatic

92
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,860
sorting system.

93
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,860
It's all redstone I've built.

94
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,740
But yeah, I'll be scrolling.

95
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,900
It'll be just showing kind of the stuff I've built over the course of things like 15 minutes

96
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,900
long.

97
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,900
It'll just be looping.

98
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,900
Wow.

99
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,900
All right.

100
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,900
Well, it looks fancy for Minecraft.

101
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,900
It looks pretty cool.

102
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,060
It's been, yeah, a few months, so it's pretty fancy now.

103
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,060
All right.

104
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,460
Well, let's get into some news tonight.

105
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,820
Of course, Minecraft is a Microsoft property now.

106
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,720
And we know we're going to be getting a lot of Microsoft news coming up this week.

107
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,300
And in advance of that, we have some other little details that have come out kind of

108
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,020
in advance of the show on the 23rd.

109
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,580
Although we do know on the...

110
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,420
And Loki, I'll ask you to recap these stories here in a minute.

111
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,620
But what we do know on the 23rd is that we're not going to get a price.

112
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,220
We're not going to get a date for the system.

113
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,580
So they've already kind of set our expectations there.

114
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,580
Sony didn't.

115
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,580
Why should they?

116
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,700
We don't know.

117
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,660
We're not going to get either of those.

118
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,020
But we will get games, games, games.

119
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:26,700
So I imagine a new Halo kind of deep dive, hopefully something Forza, either mainline

120
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,220
Horizon or maybe a new thing for Forza, who knows?

121
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,680
And then I imagine we're getting maybe Fable.

122
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,620
That's always the big rumor is that Fable's coming back.

123
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,020
One of the studios is working on Fable.

124
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,420
That'd be pretty cool.

125
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,420
And then who knows?

126
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,340
We know Microsoft has acquired many, many studios over the past couple of years.

127
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,420
I think it was something like 13 studios, places like Double Fine and stuff.

128
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,980
So we know Microsoft has been acquiring these studios, and we're going to find out this

129
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:54,780
week what most of them likely have been working on, or at least a good chunk of them.

130
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,020
We probably won't get to see them all, although that would be pretty impressive if they all

131
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,020
had something.

132
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,460
But imagine we'll see a good chunk of them, and that's to get everybody hyped, really,

133
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:09,480
especially with Sony coming right off of some big exclusives on their system.

134
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:15,360
Sony just released Ghosts of Tsushima this week, which is doing really well as far as

135
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,400
a lot of the reviews and things people are saying online.

136
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,480
They also, of course, have Last of Us 2, which, as I guess controversial as that game is,

137
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,120
it seems like mostly critics agree it's pretty good.

138
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,060
Just a lot of controversies and where the story went, I suppose.

139
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,520
But in God of War, Horizon, Sony's got a lot of great, great IPs.

140
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,140
So it's going to be interesting to see now Microsoft really kind of show what they're

141
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,320
going to offer to really go against that.

142
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,680
Meanwhile, Nintendo's over here putting out a new Mario game this week and kind of doing

143
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,960
their own thing, and that's what's worked for them.

144
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,960
Anyway, other big news, though, about Microsoft ahead of their event.

145
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,960
I can't really say press conference, because that's what it would have been if this was

146
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,960
an E3 world.

147
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,520
Yeah, it's like an online direct, if you will.

148
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,400
Virtual event on the 23rd.

149
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:09,040
Yeah, so they announced, of course, that they're going to be wrapping up the production on

150
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:17,360
the Xbox One X, which makes sense, because you have the Xbox Series X coming out.

151
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,280
But they already have stopped production on that, so that's to be expected with the brand

152
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,660
new version that's going to kind of replace it anyways.

153
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,480
Or possibly something else that's unannounced yet that may replace it, so we'll have to

154
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
wait and see.

155
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:40,720
Along with that other cool stuff, Game Pass Ultimate now is going to be getting the X

156
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,400
Cloud support, so that's going to be included with the price of Game Pass, which is pretty

157
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
cool.

158
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,400
So $15 a month to get all that with Xbox Live together.

159
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:59,200
And then, of course, there's rumors that they may be just getting rid of Xbox Live

160
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:08,160
Gold altogether, because already SKUs have been taken off of the Xbox website, where

161
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,360
you cannot purchase a year subscription to Xbox Live Gold anymore.

162
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,580
So you can only purchase three months or one month.

163
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,580
So I'm wondering if maybe at the end of the year, they're just going to kick off Gold

164
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,400
altogether and maybe replace it with something else.

165
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:29,920
This Xbox Game Pass, it'll just be the one fee and you get all of the services under

166
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,920
that one.

167
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:37,240
If only anyone could have potentially saw this coming three years ago, although I saw

168
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,920
that eye roll, I can say.

169
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:47,200
So we'll see what happens, because it could be that they're just replacing with the Xbox

170
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,920
this Game Pass thing, so it would be pretty cool.

171
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,600
Because if that's the case, then it's kind of like, whereas they were giving away one

172
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,200
or two free games a month or whatever, now you're getting like 100 games total.

173
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,200
They're going to be rolling new titles into it each month.

174
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,840
It's going to be interesting to see what they do with that.

175
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,040
I know that's why they're kind of keeping their cards close to their chest, because

176
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,360
they don't want Sony to kind of react with their PlayStation Now, although let's be honest

177
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,040
with you, PlayStation Now, I don't really care for it too much.

178
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,320
Definitely the Game Pass is a lot more appealing to me.

179
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,840
So I'm curious to see what they announce.

180
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,840
Yeah.

181
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,360
S2100 Matt in chat says, Rob is going to pull that lever that has the banner that says,

182
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,440
I was right.

183
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,360
He's been waiting to pull that for three years.

184
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,160
Yeah, it's just going to be a bunch of dust and balloon particles that fall from the ceiling

185
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,160
when that happens.

186
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,320
No, here's the thing.

187
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
Okay.

188
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
So I have like two mindsets about this.

189
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,840
There is that part of me that still kind of is convinced that Microsoft may be doing this.

190
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,400
And for those of you that are newer to OLR and don't know what I'm talking about, I said

191
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,960
in one of the year prediction segments, beginning of the year things about three years ago,

192
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:04,200
I said, Microsoft is going to go big and they're going to do something really shocking because

193
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,460
they were, they're still feeling a little sore from when they got slapped in the face

194
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:14,240
by Sony at E3 all those years ago when the PlayStation 4 was first revealed and they

195
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,320
really sucker punched the Xbox One.

196
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,020
And so Microsoft is just waiting to sucker punch Sony and say, well, we're going to get

197
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,720
rid of the price to pay online.

198
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,200
And I've kind of given these reasons for it is that Xbox, PC, they're trying to come closer

199
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,000
together into one environment.

200
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,680
And isn't it really weird that if I have no man's sky on PC, I don't have to pay to play

201
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,680
online.

202
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,000
But if I have it on my on Microsoft Xbox, I do have to pay to play it online, even though

203
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,660
we have cross platform now.

204
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,660
Like, aren't those types of things weird?

205
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,980
So yeah, so what I could definitely see them doing to keep parity with the PC side is just

206
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:55,740
charge for games pass and the X cloud service and then do Xbox live for free, basically.

207
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,460
Well, okay, so I'm still I'm still a couple couple mindsets.

208
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,460
Yeah, exactly.

209
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,700
Is that I think they could still make Xbox live free and go that way.

210
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,900
And that would be a huge shocker in the industry.

211
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,220
And you know, the only the thing I would have gotten wrong was that I would have predicted

212
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:17,500
Microsoft to do it mid cycle for Xbox one to get the leg up on PlayStation.

213
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,780
What I would have gotten wrong is that they've been saving it to do it at the start of a

214
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:26,700
new cycle to really get the jump on the PlayStation five.

215
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,580
And you know, kind of looking back hindsight's 2020.

216
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,380
You think about this news about Microsoft positioning all these chess pieces and interesting

217
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,940
places and so forth.

218
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:40,900
They've been setting up to go big with Xbox Series X for years.

219
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:47,940
So if they do end up sucker punching Sony and saying, guess what, online is now free,

220
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,060
then that's going to be, you know, a huge, a huge thing.

221
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:58,420
And it's going to be a huge plus in Microsoft's hat, especially when rumor is this big rumor.

222
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,900
But a lot of, you know, even like investor articles online are saying that you can expect

223
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,100
that Microsoft's console is going to cost less than Sony's console.

224
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,300
So all those things are going to add up to something very, very, very interesting.

225
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,340
Now, all that being said about the whole, why I might be right camp, there is still

226
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,820
that critical, you know, having watched this industry for years and years and doing this

227
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,780
show, there's that other side of me, it's a little more realistic that thinks this is

228
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:29,220
more of a branding type of thing is that it's too confusing to have game pass ultimate,

229
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:36,380
an X cloud pass and games with gold, all these separate, you know, tickets that are separate.

230
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,380
It's too much to keep track of.

231
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:43,960
Now granted, Loki just said, they just announced this week that X cloud and game pass ultimate

232
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,060
are going to be tied together.

233
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,700
So you're not going to have to worry about like, what is it?

234
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:54,460
But isn't it interesting that they didn't say Xbox gold is that too?

235
00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:00,660
So that almost makes me wonder, it kind of goes back to, oh, maybe I'm right again, because

236
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,580
they didn't call that out.

237
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,940
And why wouldn't they have if that's the direction they're going?

238
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,580
I don't think though, that they're just rebranding it, because if that was the case, and they

239
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,540
would just still have the subscription up, they would just say, Okay, well, after this

240
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,300
date, we're just calling it something different.

241
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,260
I think that they're just changing up how they actually, you know, sell it.

242
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:26,100
So I guess I don't know what's going to happen if I mean, I guess if you purchase so many

243
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,700
years of Xbox Live gold, maybe they'll just convert that over into games pass or something

244
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,700
like that.

245
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:38,260
Um, yeah, we'll wait until Thursday this week.

246
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,260
Dark soccer.

247
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,260
Let me pick on you for a minute here.

248
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,260
We'll not pick on you.

249
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,900
But I want your opinion from somebody who specifically is probably not really a Microsoft

250
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,900
person.

251
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,940
Like, I don't think you and Dan even have an I don't remember Do you guys even have

252
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,940
an Xbox?

253
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,940
I don't think you do.

254
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,940
Since Xbox 360.

255
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,940
Okay.

256
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,940
Okay.

257
00:13:54,940 --> 00:14:00,860
So you've been in Microsoft's camp before, but it would be fair to say of Sony, Nintendo

258
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,580
and Microsoft, Microsoft's getting the least amount in your house, right?

259
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,580
Yeah.

260
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,580
Okay.

261
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,220
It doesn't, we don't feel too much love for it.

262
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,500
And I would imagine a lot of that is the games, right?

263
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,020
It's just not the, you know, you've made your feelings on Halo known on this show before

264
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,020
and so forth.

265
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,380
It's not the games are not tickling your fancy, so to speak.

266
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,220
Nothing interesting enough yet to really make it worth it to me, right?

267
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:26,580
So I mean, I feel like dark soccer is the type of gamer that Microsoft like Phil Spencer

268
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,340
sees dark soccer and goes, that's who I need to bring back to Microsoft.

269
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:35,020
So that being said, when I talk about this potential that, oh, Microsoft might get rid

270
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,820
of the fee to pay online.

271
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,820
Does that excite you at all?

272
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,060
Or is it just kind of like a no, no, no.

273
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,060
Okay.

274
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,060
No.

275
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,060
Show me the games.

276
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,060
Fair enough.

277
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,060
I don't care if they're free.

278
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,060
I want good games.

279
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,060
Fair enough.

280
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,360
No, that's, that's excellent point.

281
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,060
It's just, it's really about the games.

282
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,060
So okay.

283
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,860
And, and all this new, you know, well granted, everything is really speculation and the little

284
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:02,580
news that's come out was not in the context of a press conference or direct or anything.

285
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,500
It's just, you know, kind of a leaking, I don't want to say leaking, but like comments

286
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,700
to game journalists, blogs, and things like that, a Twitter posts.

287
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,780
And that's where a lot of this is coming out right now.

288
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:19,500
So you know, to, to your credit and that point, dark soccer, July 23rd, here comes the games.

289
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,620
So I'm really interested to hear your take on what happens after this week.

290
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,900
And if anything comes out of, out of that, where you go, Ooh, we'll see.

291
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:33,700
The other thing too, is why am I going to buy a system when I've, I, me playing the

292
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:39,340
last of us is the first time I've touched my PS4 since last year, except to dust it

293
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,740
a couple of times.

294
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:48,220
So it's, if I haven't been touching that and I really like the system, what makes me going

295
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:53,820
to touch, uh, uh, get an Xbox one just to do, you know, I don't, I'm going to pay money

296
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,180
to do something that I'm probably just going to let sit there anyway and not care about.

297
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,620
So, well, and the fact that you do a lot of gaming on PC, Mac computers, you're using

298
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,720
computers in place of concerts, switch a lot lately.

299
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,660
The only gaming I've really done on, on any, uh, computer has been on my Mac and it's been,

300
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:17,620
I mean, just my puzzle games and a few, uh, a few like typography based games and stuff

301
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,620
on Apple arcade, really.

302
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:24,240
Um, although, yeah, I've been mentioning, I am going to stream, um, for charity once

303
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,120
I get, you know, everything put together from the house.

304
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,380
So I voted for the game that didn't win.

305
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,620
I voted for Colonel Sanders.

306
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,620
Didn't win.

307
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:38,700
I had to do a new poll because dream daddy and how to full boyfriend tied.

308
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,460
I also voted for Colonel Sanders.

309
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,380
So yeah.

310
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,380
Fuck my drag.

311
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,380
Right.

312
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,380
All right.

313
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,380
Okay.

314
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:51,460
Mayhem, uh, hype mayhem and chat says, uh, I think that was a Kennedy Davenport line

315
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,460
too.

316
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:57,100
Uh, hype mayhem says, even when I was strictly a con Bobby voted for Colonel Sanders to all

317
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,700
the VOG people voted for Colonel Sanders, uh, hype mayhem says, uh, even when I was

318
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,700
strictly a console gamer, the three 60 was my secondary console.

319
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:11,220
PC is my main thing right now, although I do fire up my three 60 every now and then

320
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:19,060
I'm very curious to see on the 23rd, how much PC is a win for Microsoft.

321
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:23,380
And what I mean by that is, is the emphasis, is there going to be, how much emphasis is

322
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,920
there going to be on Xbox series X?

323
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,680
We know we're not getting the system where no, we're not getting the date.

324
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:34,860
So is, I'm curious to see how many times the messages reiterated coming to PC and Xbox,

325
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,420
or this is something you can play on PC and let's be real, it's Microsoft.

326
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,420
So they're going to say windows.

327
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,020
This would be a lot of windows 10.

328
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,020
It's a windows 10 game.

329
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,020
Cause it's Microsoft.

330
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,020
That's what they're going to do.

331
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,780
So, um, I know, but so let's be real.

332
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,780
That's what they're going to do.

333
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,780
But go ahead.

334
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:55,060
So here's what I don't understand about X-cloud so I, and this is just my not doing any research

335
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,060
on it.

336
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:02,180
Um, so X-cloud is that streaming from your Xbox to your phone or is that like, say just

337
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,940
any other game streaming service where it's just from the cloud to you, whatever device

338
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,340
that you want to stream to, because if it doesn't require a console, I would love to

339
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:16,300
have X-cloud support for my PC to be able to play these games that I don't have a console

340
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,300
for.

341
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,300
Great question.

342
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,060
And one I'm hoping we get more clarity on, uh, on the 23rd.

343
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,940
Cause I think the branding with X-cloud is kind of confusing.

344
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,860
I think the fact that we don't have a definitive, like this is the answer to that.

345
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:32,840
Um, and I'm sure you guys in chat, you know, and as far as I know, the project X-cloud

346
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:39,040
that's been tested is your Xbox streaming to your device, uh, like a phone or something

347
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,040
like that.

348
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,520
Or even, I suppose your PC, which is something you've been able to do for a long time, really

349
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,680
a stream your Xbox one to your PC.

350
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:51,240
But I do think that's a message that Microsoft could stand to kind of clarify a little bit,

351
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,680
like what is X-cloud?

352
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,820
Is it, is it gaming from the cloud to your Xbox or is it, is it all of it?

353
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,280
Like what's the difference?

354
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,520
How does one work versus another?

355
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,500
And I, I kind of think, I think there's going to be a lot when it comes to like branding

356
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,220
and how they show that off, that's going to be important.

357
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,660
And I know a lot of you, again, a lot of you guys are probably sitting there ready to explain

358
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,840
it to me in technical fashion, how it all works.

359
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,160
And I get that.

360
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,440
But remember, we got to explain this to the average consumer.

361
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,880
We got to explain this to the parent that's shopping for the household or hell the college

362
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,280
kid that's buying their home console or whatever it is, you know, it's gotta be explaining

363
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,700
it a little more to that audience, especially around the holiday season.

364
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,920
Explain to grandma why this, this, why Microsoft X-cloud makes it better than so.

365
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,160
So to clarify, so according to the actual official page is that, and this is just for

366
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,600
the test, this test streaming console quality tiles from the cloud.

367
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
No waiting for downloads.

368
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,280
During the preview, you don't need to own games or console.

369
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,940
So it is right now streaming just from the cloud, not from a console.

370
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,640
I'm curious if it's going to stay that way.

371
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,640
I didn't even know.

372
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:03,480
I mean, sorry, it's either way for like other thing, everything else out of, you know, the

373
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,920
games pass stuff.

374
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,880
It says a lot that I was convinced it was your console to your phone.

375
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,440
And I swear that's something they've also been testing and fine.

376
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,840
I'm, I'm happy to be wrong because it just proves my point.

377
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,360
Like we kind of need clarity on what is it and how does it work and how easy is it going

378
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,800
to be, you know, in that whole thing.

379
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Yeah.

380
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,960
Yeah.

381
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,960
So.

382
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,960
All right.

383
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,120
S2100 Matt says there is a Reddit thread where people ask folks to explain certain things

384
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,200
like they're 12.

385
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,200
I thought it was five.

386
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,160
Isn't there a subreddit ELI five or something like that?

387
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,160
Yeah.

388
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,880
So, well, there's probably a 12 year old one too.

389
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,620
The way you'd word things to a 12 year old and the five year old are a little different,

390
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,620
but still.

391
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,620
Yeah.

392
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,320
That's, that's, that's what, that's what Microsoft needs to do with xCloud.

393
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,960
ELI 12.

394
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,960
That's what it is.

395
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,120
So.

396
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,120
All right.

397
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,120
Anyway.

398
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:01,360
Um, Loki, are you, are you getting hyped about this event?

399
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,720
Are you kind of lukewarm on Microsoft game information?

400
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:12,480
So yes, of course I got to say I'm, I love Sony and I love PlayStation five.

401
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,500
I almost am more excited about Microsoft this time around and I think it has something to

402
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,580
do with their underdog status.

403
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,380
You know, the reality is y'all, I love games so much.

404
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,020
I'm going to buy both.

405
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,020
I'm going to buy both.

406
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,820
Um, and that's just the way it is.

407
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:34,820
But uh, I, there, there's a certain like underdog element and you know, this is, this is Phil

408
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:39,900
Spencer's time as opposed to, you know, Don Matrick who kind of screwed the Xbox one right

409
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,900
out the gate.

410
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,420
Like I, I'm really just excited to see like what it is and how they're going to get that

411
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,420
messaging across.

412
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,860
And I'm, I'm kind of really excited about it to be honest.

413
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,540
I still don't know what their exclusives are though between the different platforms.

414
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:58,100
So that's why right now I like having a hard time making decisions because like, I don't

415
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,100
know what they're offering.

416
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,180
Like they keep saying, Oh, our hardware is more powerful.

417
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,020
I mean, every company is going to say that.

418
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:08,260
So like I need to see what the games are and I, I'm not clear, like especially after that

419
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:13,500
last event that Sony had, like I'm not clear what games they're offering, it was all third

420
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,500
party stuff.

421
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,940
And like, yeah, Assassin's Creed is going to be on both platforms and I don't care about

422
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,100
that game anyways.

423
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:25,980
Um, I just don't know third party wise, like I, I would lean a little bit towards Sony

424
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:31,900
just because I have a huge library of stuff on there, but I mean, with Game Pass, it doesn't

425
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,900
matter anyway.

426
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,420
So like, I have to see, I have to see what they have to offer like exclusive wise.

427
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:41,420
Cause that's really kind of what drives me to one console or the other.

428
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:45,660
If Sony would really go big on the backwards compatibility thing, I would be so happy.

429
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:49,460
And I know people are like, why do you need a new console to play old games?

430
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,700
Because I ran out of shelf space for the old consoles.

431
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,460
The old consoles get dusty and die.

432
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,780
I don't even know where the fricking cords are for my old consoles at some point.

433
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,020
Like it's kind of nice to have it all in one.

434
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,220
And I gotta be honest, if Sony does open up and say, guess what?

435
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,500
All those PlayStation two and three and one games that have been sitting on your shelf,

436
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,700
now they have value again.

437
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,700
You can play them on your phone.

438
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,740
I'll be so excited to be honest.

439
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,740
So we'll see.

440
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,740
We'll see.

441
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,140
Especially when Matt says we won't notice a difference between a console power for a

442
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,140
few years.

443
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,220
And by then studios will be able to use the console to its full potential.

444
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,620
We're never going to know which console is better anyways, because what's going to happen,

445
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:27,420
especially when it comes to mainline games that are multi-platform, they're going to

446
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,100
keep them in parity with each other.

447
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,100
You're not going to have one that's like vastly different than the other one.

448
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,500
It's going to be first party titles that would be showing that stuff off.

449
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,340
And honestly, I don't think it's going to be like night and day between these different

450
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,340
consoles.

451
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:45,380
I don't think it's just all hype and, you know, advertised speak.

452
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:50,420
I think that's a very important point is that technical power does not mean what it used

453
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,500
to mean.

454
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,600
Case in point, Nintendo, I rest my case.

455
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,220
Like Nintendo has the weakest console out there from a technological, although some

456
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,540
would argue the technological marvel of the dock and take it off the dock is a pretty

457
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,640
big feather in the hat, but you guys know what I mean, right?

458
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,720
Basically the switch is going to be the least powerful thing on the market, but does it

459
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,720
matter?

460
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,540
No, it absolutely doesn't matter because they have animal crossing.

461
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,320
They have a Metroid game coming out in the future.

462
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,860
They likely are doing another Mario game this holiday of some form or another.

463
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,960
It's not going to matter.

464
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:29,840
So like, you know, whereas back in the day when it was, you know, super Nintendo or Nintendo

465
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,920
64 on a cartridge versus PlayStation on a disc versus Dreamcast, you know, all the,

466
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,840
all this stuff going on, like the technological end of it doesn't matter anymore.

467
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,480
If that makes sense.

468
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,840
So yeah, that makes sense.

469
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:51,240
Phoenix 7726 in chat says, Rob, power has never meant the same thing to Nintendo, even

470
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,680
when they are on the edge during the GameCube era.

471
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,840
Yeah, that's a brilliant point.

472
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,280
The GameCube was probably the closest they ever got to kind of being on par with the

473
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,880
other consoles that were available at the time.

474
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,960
But even then they, their online was so weak compared to the competition.

475
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,560
The thing that's going to hurt them though, power wise, I mean, I get it, the Switch is

476
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,800
an okay system.

477
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:18,720
It's just that when you're looking at third party titles, you're going to have, the Switch

478
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,080
is not going to be able to run a lot of these modern engines on it.

479
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,760
It's not without them massively altering those games.

480
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:31,020
That's why you see a lot of these older games being ported to the Switch, which is fine.

481
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:35,700
But you're not going to see Cyberpunk running on the Switch or something like that.

482
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,700
It's going to be very much separate in that sense.

483
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,900
Same with Madden or anything like that.

484
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,740
These next gen Madden games, they're going to have, it all is going to be porting that

485
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:51,460
old version of Madden onto the Switch over and over and over again with a roster update.

486
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:57,140
Counterpoint though, because Microsoft is still developing for the Xbox One.

487
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,780
Everything that is being developed is going to run on the Xbox One.

488
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:05,380
So that being said, it's not going to be as difficult, I mean, I say that like I have

489
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,740
any technical knowledge of programming a game whatsoever, but I think that bridge would

490
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:14,780
be a lot less strenuous to cross from Xbox One to Switch than it would be from PlayStation

491
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,340
5 and Xbox Series X.

492
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,920
And we know for a couple of years, Microsoft is still going to be supporting Xbox One.

493
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,740
Third party could be a different story, I understand that.

494
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:29,740
But I think that bridge is not as monumental as it might have felt before, especially with

495
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,060
the way the Switch is sold.

496
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,980
It's motivating third party developers to kind of keep it in mind when they develop.

497
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:41,140
Now in a couple years when Microsoft finally decides to leave the Xbox One behind, I think

498
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:45,620
that's when the conversations will start really about what is the Switch's successor, which

499
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,260
I full on just expect to be a Switch 2.0.

500
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:53,460
I don't see Nintendo leaving this formula behind at all, like it's going to be another

501
00:26:53,460 --> 00:27:00,500
portable and a desktop, I don't know, a living room system, Nintendo's not going to leave

502
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
that behind.

503
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,300
It's been too damn successful this time around.

504
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,300
So.

505
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,300
Yeah.

506
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,300
All right.

507
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:12,180
I just, I think there's just a lot of even stuff with the current generation of consoles

508
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,100
that doesn't come to the Switch because it can't run that stuff.

509
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,380
Although now it's going to be running Crysis, so I guess anything's possible.

510
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,540
S2-100 Matt in chat says, Loki going after sports games again.

511
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,580
But he's right.

512
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:30,220
The last year or two of sports games on an expiring consoles are just really sad ports.

513
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,740
That's what they've been the last few years already on the Switch.

514
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,740
Nothing's going to change.

515
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,740
Nothing.

516
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,220
All of a sudden them making a brand new engine that runs on next generation of consoles doesn't

517
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,300
mean all of a sudden they're going to port it to.

518
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,300
It's not going to happen.

519
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:45,020
But that's up to the third parties to do better in some regard too, because Nintendo is doing

520
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,020
great.

521
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,020
All right.

522
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,340
Anyway, let's move on.

523
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,820
Let's talk about the types of games we've been playing this week, whether it's been

524
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,860
on our Switch, our computer, our Xbox, PlayStation, whatever.

525
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,860
How was your gaming week?

526
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,260
And we'll start with Dark Sakura.

527
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,820
How was your gaming week?

528
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,820
It was all right.

529
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:04,300
I played a lot of Animal Crossing.

530
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,300
Dan's been playing Bloodstained.

531
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:13,140
He's actually been playing both Curse of the Moon 2 and then the regular Bloodstained.

532
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,180
I've been playing this stupid game that I'm kind of hooked on.

533
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:20,420
And it's one of those like free with ads stupid games, but the ads aren't very long on it.

534
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:25,380
And it's if people can see, it looks like it's like this where you have you get like

535
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,380
letters.

536
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,380
Okay.

537
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:31,420
For the podcast, folks, it looks like a word for words with friends, but with a spinny

538
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,420
dial thing.

539
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,500
It's the word wheel mode from words with friends is what it is.

540
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,500
Okay.

541
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,020
And so, of course, you know, you have to build the words on it.

542
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,660
And me, like on this one, I've guessed three of the words on the puzzle and I've done thirty

543
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,540
three other words.

544
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:50,860
The last one I did was like nine words and I guessed seventy.

545
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,420
So yeah.

546
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,420
And they were all real words.

547
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:58,380
So I'm like, yeah, this game isn't for people who actually have a vocabulary.

548
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,380
It's been pretty fun.

549
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:03,860
I'm still playing words with friends and I haven't really gotten to much of The Last

550
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,580
of Us this week just because other things are going on.

551
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:14,020
But I this upcoming week isn't going to be much better because I get my new desk and

552
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,940
I have to set up my office and everything.

553
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:23,140
So this all of this behind me is going to be different, hopefully the next time I'm

554
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,140
on the show.

555
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,140
Awesome.

556
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,940
But in other news, next week is my last half show.

557
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,900
I go back to my old schedule and you get me for a full show.

558
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:38,580
I'm glad the warden's giving you a pardon so we can have y'all show.

559
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,580
Good to know.

560
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,420
I don't know how I feel about closing again, though.

561
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:47,220
I've kind of gotten used to my quiet six a.m., but it is what it is.

562
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,220
Yeah.

563
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,220
You'll do fine.

564
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,220
All right.

565
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,460
Well, if that's it for your gaming week, we'll move to Loki, who clearly Minecraft was part

566
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,460
of his week.

567
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,460
Yes.

568
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,860
I'm always playing Minecraft.

569
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,140
So I played lots of Minecraft.

570
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,660
And aside from that, Orna.

571
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:10,860
And then also I did finally get the switch to play a little bit of Paper Mario, the Origami

572
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,860
King.

573
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,300
So that was pretty awesome.

574
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,100
I'm enjoying that quite a bit.

575
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,540
So just not too far into it.

576
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:22,620
I'm not too like the first big boss yet, but I played like three hours of it.

577
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,620
That's pretty good.

578
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,620
So that's pretty much it.

579
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,620
OK.

580
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,620
All right.

581
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,620
My gaming week.

582
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,620
I have a lot to talk about, actually.

583
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,180
So there's all the usuals, right?

584
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,820
Like, you know, Pokemon Go.

585
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:39,340
I got like 11 shinies during community day catching for my Bluetooth, you know, whatever.

586
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,340
But I got a 100 percent Gastly.

587
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,740
And those are more exciting to me when you get a perfect 100 percent because they give

588
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,300
out shinies like candy on community day, I swear.

589
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,380
But yeah.

590
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,300
So I participated in that Gomi.

591
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,580
I'm still playing Orna a bit.

592
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,660
And this was a week where I was kind of like, I'm going to tackle some games that have just

593
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:01,700
been sitting in my backlog or, you know, just play something random on Xbox Game Pass.

594
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,580
So I played on Xbox Game Pass.

595
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,280
They just added a game called Forager.

596
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,900
And Loki, this might be something that's up your alley because it is very Minecrafty,

597
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,300
especially when it comes to the crafting in the game.

598
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:18,420
But the graphics look a little more like honestly to me, they're almost like a Binding of Isaac

599
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,360
style graphics, although the game is nothing like Binding of Isaac.

600
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,180
It's more Minecraft, but it's 2D.

601
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:28,380
And you know, you're going around, you mind these different things.

602
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:33,940
You have things that you build like a forage and you do other things like a thread, a loom,

603
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,940
things like that.

604
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:39,640
You're kind of crafting and then you expand your land through money and you're crafting

605
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,140
money as well.

606
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,120
And so it's an interesting kind of 2D Minecraft.

607
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,400
We've seen these types of games before.

608
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:52,000
Maybe Don't Starve would be another good comparison, although I feel like Forager was like really,

609
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
really dumbed down.

610
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,300
And that's a good thing.

611
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,260
I think that's an okay thing to be sometimes.

612
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,540
Sometimes being a simpler game gives you an edge.

613
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,260
That's why I love Heroes of the Storm.

614
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:05,660
It's like League of Legends, but it's dumbed down and that's not a bad thing.

615
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,620
So Forager is pretty cool in that regard.

616
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,200
I wish it had a little bit more robust of a tutorial.

617
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,440
Like sometimes the little dude will tell you like what to do, but I was kind of having

618
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,540
a hard time figuring out like, am I doing this the right way?

619
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,600
Am I eating the right things I'm supposed to be eating?

620
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,680
Because this seems very difficult and I'm running out of life very often.

621
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,840
I guess maybe I need to build more fish traps.

622
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,280
I don't know.

623
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,560
That type of discovery might be a plus for some people, though.

624
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,740
I like to be handheld just a little bit more in the beginning of the game.

625
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,220
But that's really just my it's a minor piece of feedback, all things considered.

626
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,940
I think the game is fun.

627
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,940
It's interesting.

628
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:48,860
And I feel like it moves at a faster pace than Minecraft, too, which I kind of like.

629
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:52,380
So yeah, that's cool.

630
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:57,420
Some other games I've been playing, Epic Games Store, I'm like, you know, I've been collecting

631
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,860
all these free games.

632
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,900
I'm going to play some free games.

633
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:05,540
So I played one called Lifeless Planet that I think came out a couple or excuse me, was

634
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,440
a free game a couple weeks ago.

635
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,880
I think the game itself dates back to like 2014 or something like that.

636
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,120
And I thought it might be kind of like a No Man's Sky type of game, because that was the

637
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,880
vibe that a lot of the screenshots were giving me.

638
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,460
It's not quite that open world.

639
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,880
It's a little more platformy.

640
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,160
I would almost call it a little bit more like an old school Tomb Raider type of thing is

641
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,400
honestly how it kind of felt to me with some of the puzzles where it's like, oh, I got

642
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,080
to take a ball and roll the ball over to this cliff so I can jump on the ball and jet pack

643
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,780
up here and do these types of things.

644
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,620
It has kind of an interesting story to it too.

645
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,500
It was okay.

646
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,100
I thought the game kind of wasn't what I expected it would be.

647
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,880
Like I thought a game like Lifeless Planet would be very much about exploration and kind

648
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,300
of open worldness.

649
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,000
And that's not really what this is at all.

650
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,140
But that doesn't make it bad.

651
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,160
It's just it wasn't what I expected.

652
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,160
So there you go.

653
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,440
Now you can set your expectations appropriately if you ever play this game, which I got on

654
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,980
Epic Games Store a while ago.

655
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,120
And it's, you know, again, many of you guys probably picked it up for free.

656
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,120
It's worth a look.

657
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,120
It's pretty neat.

658
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,060
I also played a game.

659
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,600
Oh, everybody knows this game, Celeste.

660
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,000
I finally got around to playing Celeste.

661
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,920
Finally got around to playing Celeste this week.

662
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:21,480
And because that was on Epic Games Store at some point that that game is hard as hell.

663
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,560
My God.

664
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,740
But it's it's fun.

665
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,740
It's it.

666
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:30,360
It it has like to me it has like a Super Meat Boy vibe kind of going with it.

667
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,120
And that's kind of what it reminds me of closest.

668
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,260
But the soundtrack's really good.

669
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:39,520
And I like how I like it.

670
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,520
I don't like it.

671
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,520
I like it.

672
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,880
How there's these like these little strawberries that very clearly are things you're supposed

673
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,460
to be collecting that are like dangled in front of you.

674
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,040
But they're hard as hell to get.

675
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,840
And like I can get them sometimes, but other times, no, can't do it.

676
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,560
And I just have to move on.

677
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,560
And then sometimes there's choices.

678
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,680
Do I go left or right?

679
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,680
And I don't know.

680
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,200
Like, I thought games like this only had one path.

681
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,100
But no, there's there's multiple ways to get there.

682
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,220
So that's kind of interesting where it's like a Super Meat Boy S type of game.

683
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,820
But there's multiple ways to kind of get to the finish.

684
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,300
So yeah, I thought that was interesting.

685
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,580
Some comments in chat on these games.

686
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,620
Act Def says Celeste is so awesome.

687
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,680
It's hard, but it's so rewarding.

688
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,540
And the story is great.

689
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,620
And Pele Hanumeya talking about Lifeless Planet was interesting to play.

690
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,620
Yeah, it's interesting.

691
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,400
The story is kind of kind of not what I expected it to be at all.

692
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,300
But it's very narrative, but it's good.

693
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,300
And let's see.

694
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,300
I think that's about like my newer games I was playing and catching up.

695
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:41,600
Okay, so I mentioned on Twitter that like, I have found this new thing in one of my games

696
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,000
that I play a lot that I really enjoy.

697
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,420
Some of you might find it a little weird.

698
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:51,300
And that's why I'm going to talk about it openly and publicly on this show that I do.

699
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:56,600
So obviously, you guys know I play a lot of a game called Ingress, right?

700
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:03,000
So something they just recently did in Ingress is they released something called portal scanning.

701
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,360
And what portal scanning is, is quite simply all you're doing, you're taking like a, you

702
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:12,120
take your camera, and you walk around like a portal basically where it is, and you're

703
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:19,120
taking a 3D scan of that portal for Niantic's database to be used in some other game down

704
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,120
the road.

705
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,480
Now this same feature is in Pokemon Go.

706
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,000
But it's, I think it's a little more, it's Pokestop scanning.

707
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,840
I think it's a little more hidden, and they don't give you any rewards for it.

708
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,100
There's like no reason to do it in Pokemon Go.

709
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,680
So I doubt any of you are except maybe the curiosity factor.

710
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,400
But in Ingress, they have some little badges, you know, little achievements that you can

711
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,960
get from doing these things.

712
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,120
And so that kind of motivated me to start taking a look, I was like, well, at least

713
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:47,160
I can do this bronze level, you know, achievement and do this.

714
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,080
And they ended so they did one badge for scanning portals.

715
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,840
But then they released a second badge called scout controller.

716
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,880
This is very different than Pokemon.

717
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:03,920
And what scout controller is, is that scout controller is for uniques, basically, like,

718
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,800
if you have more portal scans than anybody else on a portal, then you are the scout controller

719
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,800
for 30 days.

720
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,180
Now, if somebody comes and scans more than you, they'll take it away from you.

721
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:17,600
But you've already stamped that as a unique scout controller claim.

722
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,880
So it goes towards your badge.

723
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,440
So this added up to and there's there's a point I'm getting to here.

724
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:30,800
This added up to me trying to find portal dense areas to just scan a lot of things.

725
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,320
And so I could work on my controller badge really fast.

726
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:38,680
I'm already up to I got the bronze level, I'm past 100 I'm up to about 150 unique portals

727
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:44,360
because I've been going to dense areas, parks, I found I was scanning at parks.

728
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,360
But right now there's a lot of kids at parks.

729
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:52,780
There's a lot of asshole teenagers at parks, because people you know, there's not a lot

730
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,560
to do in quarantine right now, but go outside and go to parks.

731
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,100
So it's hard for me to be like, I'm going to take out my phone and like, pretend like

732
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,060
I'm not taking pictures of your kid.

733
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,060
I promise.

734
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,060
I'm taking pictures.

735
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,400
It's too weird for me.

736
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,380
And I don't want to go there.

737
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:13,220
So where do you think the portal dense area is that I found where I don't get bothered

738
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:18,940
by anybody and graveyards graveyards that is exactly right.

739
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:24,460
And so let me actually roll some b roll of me doing a portal scan at a graveyard at a

740
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,140
graveyard.

741
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:31,380
And I gotta tell you, you know, what's fun about it is that the location doesn't so you

742
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,420
can see you're in the in sorry, I haven't narrated for the podcast.

743
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,460
You can see I see where the let me let me actually start.

744
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:40,100
I'm sorry, I was a bad narrator, I'm gonna start the b roll again.

745
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:45,020
So you see, it shows me a picture of what the grave looks like and the name on it.

746
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,720
I've got to find it.

747
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,200
And the location isn't always accurate.

748
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,960
And that's the fun part is that kind of have to play Where's Waldo a little bit.

749
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,420
So now in the video, okay, I found the portal, I found the grave marker that was in the picture.

750
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,120
And so I start to actually scan.

751
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,480
So this is me walking around the portal.

752
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,560
And you see it actually kind of nevermind the Pokemon Go messages, because that's me

753
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,280
catching via Bluetooth.

754
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,520
But I walk around the portal best I can, although obviously, I'm not going to walk up, I'm not

755
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,120
going to be disrespectful to the graveyard itself.

756
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,960
So I do the best that I can, and then it actually encodes it.

757
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,200
And then it sends the data to Niantic, so that Pikachu can pop out of that gravestone

758
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,640
at some point in Pokemon Go, I imagine.

759
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,960
So you see it actually like replays it to you, it shows a little scan that I took.

760
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,840
And there it goes, I do upload later.

761
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,840
And then I actually upload those scans when I get home at some point later on.

762
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,800
So that's, that's basically what it looks like.

763
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,640
So again, the fun part is, I'm having to use clues in the picture because graveyards, right,

764
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,120
there's tons of gravestones.

765
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,000
But you want to make sure you're scanning the right thing, right?

766
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,660
So I have to use clues like in the picture.

767
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,140
What is the grave shape like?

768
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,640
Does it have a cross on top of it?

769
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,680
Or does it have like a, some of them have a drapery?

770
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,880
Does it have a torch?

771
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,340
Like what like things are on it?

772
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,340
What color is it?

773
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:07,080
I see a tree in the background, because again, the location is not always accurate in a graveyard.

774
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:14,040
People like submit it like close, but it's very hard in Niantic system with Pokemon Go

775
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,200
and Ingress, like you see a satellite view of where the portal is supposed to be.

776
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,980
You can't, you can't find that unless it's one of those giant tombs, which sometimes

777
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,540
there's that as well.

778
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,000
It's very hard to find that on satellite view.

779
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,740
So a lot of these things are in the wrong place.

780
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:33,680
So yeah, that's, that's, and I had a lot of fun doing that today.

781
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,160
And now I'm like, oh, I want to go to all these other places and scan too, because they're

782
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,200
the best things to scan.

783
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,520
Like you know, when you're scanning like plaques on a wall and stuff, they're not very interesting.

784
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,800
They don't really have a lot of shape to them, but gravestones are like kind of awesome

785
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
for that.

786
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,000
And again, nobody fucking bothers me at a graveyard at all.

787
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
It's great.

788
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I saw one other person there today and I'm pretty sure they were taking the gyms in Pokemon

789
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,080
Go is what they were doing.

790
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,840
It was also, and I, you know, and as weird as y'all might think it is or whatever, like

791
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:07,960
I'm completely respectful when I just, I make sure I'm not walking in places that feel disrespectful.

792
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,720
I don't make noise.

793
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:14,120
I don't, you know, I don't jump on things quite honestly.

794
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:18,280
And one thing I found through this, because games like Pokemon Go and Ingress and all

795
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,400
these Niantic things and several games are also about exploring your community, right?

796
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,120
That's a big thing that they've always pitched, right?

797
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,120
Right?

798
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,840
Loki is like, explore your community, get to your community.

799
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:31,520
You know, one thing I learned, this graveyard sucks at upkeep.

800
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,760
And I was actually kind of distressed about it.

801
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:39,960
I was like, if my relative was buried at the cemetery, I would be so upset by the state

802
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,960
of this.

803
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,200
All of the, none of the grass had been kept.

804
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,640
It was all dead.

805
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,780
California hasn't been in a drought for a couple of years, so I don't know what their

806
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,280
excuse is on that front.

807
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,920
They get at least water at once in a while.

808
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,360
So all the grass was dead.

809
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:57,760
I saw tombs that were completely like, like had fallen over just out of like disrepair.

810
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,180
There was one, I put a picture on my Instagram that was just like something that had fallen

811
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,180
over into three pieces.

812
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,220
And I was like, what if this was my relative?

813
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:08,140
This is, this is distressful.

814
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:14,340
So there's almost a part of me that's like, this game might turn me into an activist of

815
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:19,440
some sort where I'm like, y'all need to, y'all are paying good money for, you know, this

816
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,620
type of care and to memorialize your relatives and so forth.

817
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:30,340
And I bet if some people saw the state of disrepair this place was in, they'd be shocked.

818
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,340
So I don't know.

819
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,340
I could just start an Instagram or a Yelp or something like that.

820
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,340
I don't know.

821
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:40,260
So Bobby Blackwolf in chat says the undertaker would take care of that graveyard.

822
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,260
Yeah.

823
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,380
Bobby Blackwolf says Rob has 5G.

824
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,380
Okay.

825
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,620
But that's, that's the fake 5G.

826
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,580
That's the, it's look very carefully.

827
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,920
It's 5GE.

828
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,740
That's my AT&T 5G.

829
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,740
Okay.

830
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,260
It's, it's very different.

831
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:59,900
It's not, not actual 5G.

832
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,900
Let's see.

833
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,460
Let's see some comments in chat here.

834
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,660
Quest Buster says Rob is going to end up on the 11 o'clock news as part of the graveyard

835
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,660
hoard story.

836
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,660
I don't know.

837
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:11,660
Phoenix 7726 says, so Pikachu's a grave digger.

838
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,660
LOL.

839
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:18,420
I mean, that's what, I assume it's for Pokemon Go and some type of AR feature, but we also

840
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,860
know Niantic's working on Catan.

841
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:26,660
I don't know what type of AR stuff would be in Catan, but at the same time I would have

842
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:30,400
never foresaw what AR stuff would have been in Pokemon.

843
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,400
So who knows?

844
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,860
Maybe when you build things in Catan, cause that is Niantic's next game, that's, that's

845
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:38,560
out there and you can sign up for the beta now.

846
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,560
I don't know.

847
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,880
They might implement it in their Harry Potter game.

848
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,880
I keep forgetting.

849
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,560
I kind of stopped on Harry Potter, Wizards Unite.

850
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:48,960
I just, I, I think that that's Orna's fault because I have found the maximum number of

851
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,960
those games I can play at once is three.

852
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,960
I cannot play more than three GPS games at once.

853
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,080
So I finally left.

854
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:01,560
So Wizards Unite by the wayside and I don't know, maybe the traces will do something with

855
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,560
the AR.

856
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,560
I don't know.

857
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,560
So interesting.

858
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:09,840
Anyway, so yeah, that's, that's my interesting new obsession is I'm scanning graveyards.

859
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,060
It's good exercise.

860
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:13,120
I get my steps in.

861
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:18,200
There's no children running around acting crazy and no parents going like, why is that

862
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,480
creepy dude with his phone trying to take pictures of my kid?

863
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,680
I would much rather somebody just be like, why is that dude taking pictures in a graveyard?

864
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,720
Because honestly, I think there's a lot of people, graveyards are, graveyards are meant

865
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,880
to be good looking.

866
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,200
They're meant to be beautiful.

867
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,840
They're meant to be eternal resting spots of sorts.

868
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:38,400
That's why I was so irritated with this one I went to today and the state of disrepair

869
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,400
it was in.

870
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,720
I was like, if I was buried here, I'd be so mad.

871
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,160
And I don't think what I'm doing is disrespectful either.

872
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:52,240
Like it's, it's a way to memorialize or if, if I pass away, you guys suddenly and unexpectedly,

873
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,800
I know this is a morbid thing to talk about, but I should talk about it.

874
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:01,280
If I should pass away unexpectedly and quickly, absolutely, I want to become a Pokestop and

875
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,280
a portal.

876
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:09,360
So whether it's a bench with my name on it or whatever, absolutely, that is how I want

877
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,360
to be remembered.

878
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,400
So, all right.

879
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,820
Phoenix 7726 in chat says, Rob, are you going, Rob, are you going through an elder emo phase

880
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:18,820
of sorts?

881
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,820
I mean, I was always a little emo.

882
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,440
And actdeft in chat says, you're not wrong, Rob at all.

883
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,440
No, thank you.

884
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,580
Thank you.

885
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:26,580
That's my favorite phrase.

886
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:27,580
All right.

887
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,360
Anyway, enough of my gaming week.

888
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,200
I just had to talk about that a little bit.

889
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,840
Let's actually get into some gaming news and some other things that have happened around

890
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,000
the gaming world this week.

891
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,240
Sorry, I'm reading some more comments in chat.

892
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,600
Chronos Ode in chat says, cemeteries are some of my favorite places to go for peace and

893
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,600
quiet.

894
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,720
Exactly that.

895
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,480
Like people don't bother me.

896
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,800
They don't look at me funny.

897
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,320
Like everybody's kind of minding their own business.

898
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,200
I used to have picnics in cemeteries.

899
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,520
That's and you know what we would do?

900
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,560
We would do gravestone rubbings with chalk and paper.

901
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,160
Oh, that's pretty cool.

902
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,600
Yeah, that's really neat.

903
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,760
I mean, I'm a kid.

904
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,760
Yeah.

905
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,960
I mean, and I don't again, I don't think it's I don't find myself being disrespectful.

906
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,560
I mean, if I was making noise and screaming and dancing and knocking things over like

907
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,360
somebody clearly did in this place, there's a graffiti too.

908
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,360
I would.

909
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,360
That's that.

910
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,360
I don't.

911
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,360
But I don't do that stuff.

912
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,960
Um, let's see.

913
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,480
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, put on your tombstone, dear resistance.

914
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,960
Keep this portal.

915
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,320
Hell no.

916
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,320
Forever green.

917
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,320
All right.

918
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,880
Anyway, I suppose there's some people on resistance I like.

919
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,680
And I suppose if they wanted to visit once in a while, they could.

920
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,720
But this is very morbid.

921
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,720
So let's move on.

922
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,520
Let's talk about what's going on in gaming news around the industry.

923
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,800
So Loki, we'll start with you.

924
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,800
Yes.

925
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:55,040
So there is a very exciting new Lego set that's been announced that is going to celebrate

926
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,480
the 30th anniversary of the Nintendo Entertainment System.

927
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,120
And it is a Lego Nintendo Enter entertainment system.

928
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:07,340
So not only do you get the console, you get a controller, you get the Super Mario Brothers

929
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:12,560
game cartridge, which actually does plug into the console itself, but also a retro style

930
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:17,900
TV with a crank that moves a little scene in there that you can actually move Mario

931
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,980
up and down on as well.

932
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:26,100
And then, of course, if you have the starter kit for the new Super Mario Brothers Lego

933
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:30,440
sets, then you can plug that in on top and it'll play the Mario Brothers theme music

934
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,440
as well.

935
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,700
So it's coming out August 1st.

936
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:37,980
It's going to run two hundred and thirty dollars.

937
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,300
But wow, does it look amazing?

938
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:46,380
Yeah, I got to say this is I mean, the fact that it's a Nintendo set is cool, but even

939
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:52,020
if it wasn't Nintendo, this is probably one of the most badass Lego things I've ever seen.

940
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,140
Like this is next level.

941
00:47:55,140 --> 00:48:00,180
But I can't with that price tag, I can't like not not for me, but I'm also I'm not the Lego

942
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,500
affectionate.

943
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,780
Some of the rest of y'all are low key.

944
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:08,220
So have you or did you drop the money on it or trying to?

945
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:11,820
Well, they don't they don't always for your other sets.

946
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:12,820
Oh, right.

947
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:13,820
Yeah.

948
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:15,220
You have to wait.

949
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:20,300
Bobby Black Wolf and Chad says, I'm getting this even at that price, not a scalper price,

950
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,300
though.

951
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,660
So I'm with you on that and I would never pay a scalper for it.

952
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:29,300
I was just about to ask you because you guys do some Lego collecting, right?

953
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,060
Just not a ton, right?

954
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:32,940
We do.

955
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:40,180
We we actually have like two Back to the Future sets, the DeLorean and two Ecto ones.

956
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,460
And I would really want this one.

957
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,220
But then again, we do have other things that we need to do.

958
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:49,380
So anyone want to buy a house for selling one?

959
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,380
Oh, actually, yes.

960
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:55,100
You want to live in a retirement community?

961
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,980
No, that no, I don't.

962
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:57,980
OK.

963
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:58,980
Yeah.

964
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:04,220
But it's funny to say that, though, you know, I really you know, we really are about to

965
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:05,220
start those conversations.

966
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:06,220
Right.

967
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,060
So we may have to talk.

968
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:09,060
Yeah.

969
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,140
But the other kind of funny thing with all that is.

970
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:15,580
OK, so so Bobby Black over the chat is I'm willing to pay 230 for it, not any higher

971
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,580
as to 100.

972
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,460
Matt says 250 was my max for it.

973
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,460
Thankfully, it was lower.

974
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:22,380
So you guys say that two thirty to fifty with Lego sets.

975
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:28,060
And my mind goes, I could get another arcade one up cabinet for 200 bucks, dude.

976
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:32,900
I'm telling you, I Placerville.

977
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:38,140
Has Pacman cabs for fifty dollars, 50, don't they've got a few left.

978
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,980
My husband will divorce me if I bring another one of those in this house.

979
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,780
I've been just sitting there.

980
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,700
I still want the Star Wars one.

981
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,700
Those are still in Roseville.

982
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,860
I'm going to be sending hubby on an errand.

983
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:57,380
Yeah, but that's the thing that was like like I don't like Pacman that much.

984
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,740
And so I'm like, no, I can't do that.

985
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:02,060
That's like that's the one you hack in it.

986
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:06,020
That's because surely, surely somebody's figured out how to hack one of those cabinets.

987
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,020
No, they already have.

988
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:08,420
I mean, they have tons of stuff.

989
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:09,900
There's a whole marketplace for that stuff.

990
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:16,300
But I would like something that's less that, you know, less that you need to modify to it.

991
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:20,540
Like, for example, a street fighter cab where it has six buttons for each player.

992
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:26,900
I mean, that would be ideal or like a the Ninja Turtles one would be pretty cool, too.

993
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,780
But those are still full price.

994
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:31,420
Wait, oh, wait.

995
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:34,380
I mean, at one time at one time, it's ridiculous.

996
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:39,420
At one time, the asteroid caps, they were clearing them out at a dollar, one dollar.

997
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:45,260
Like, how I don't understand what happens, didn't get snatched up by the employees.

998
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:48,060
I'm so upset because it's a space thing.

999
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:52,380
They do take up a bit of space like you can, you know, and they're not they're not for

1000
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:53,500
every type of living space.

1001
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,300
I don't even like having one in a rental.

1002
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,300
I could imagine.

1003
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:59,820
Loki, back when this show started, you and I used to live in an apartment.

1004
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,540
You know what I was about to say?

1005
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,260
Could you imagine us having one of those machines in the house?

1006
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:09,860
But then I remember in that apartment, you had that fucking arcade cabinet that you

1007
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:11,820
built in that apartment.

1008
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,220
That thing was gigantic.

1009
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:15,900
Oh, God, I wish I had a picture of it.

1010
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:18,100
That's that's an ultimate.

1011
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,900
It's an Ultimark arcade.

1012
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,780
I think that's what the brand was.

1013
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:23,740
The design was.

1014
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:26,980
But yeah, it was a four player and you like players.

1015
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:29,460
Wasn't our television in that cabinet?

1016
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:31,860
Yes, the television was in the cabinet.

1017
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:32,360
Yes.

1018
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,160
I remember playing Dracula X on that thing, hooked up the TurboGrafx.

1019
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:38,680
It's funny.

1020
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:47,120
All right, anyway, all our collections and what they do to us, let's move on.

1021
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:50,200
Let's talk about Cyberpunk 2077.

1022
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,360
Some updates on that game this week.

1023
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,080
Obviously, the game didn't come out.

1024
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:58,640
But, you know, there's more interviews and things that are being done that are building

1025
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,960
more hype for the game and a couple of interesting new features, if you will.

1026
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,920
Coming out about the game this week.

1027
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,440
So there was a Polish website, Spider's Web, that actually interviewed some of the

1028
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:14,040
folks, lead quest designer in this case for Cyberpunk 2077, talking a little bit

1029
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:18,160
about, you know, how the game works and the way you can play through the game.

1030
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,400
What's interesting in the interview, the lead quest designer said, all the most

1031
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,600
important choices in the game, all bosses and elite opponents, there is always a way

1032
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,080
to go without killing anyone.

1033
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,800
Sometimes aggression and fighting with an opponent is something that cannot be avoided.

1034
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:39,800
It is not that you have to take someone's legs or arms, but it is also not so that you

1035
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,240
can completely avoid the fight.

1036
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:46,360
But you are able to fight in such a way that you only neutralize your opponents and thus

1037
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,240
pass the game.

1038
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:52,080
So in other words, if you want to be Batman and not actually kill anybody, that's going

1039
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,840
to be an option to you in Cyberpunk.

1040
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:57,480
I think that's kind of interesting, the kind of like pacifist approach to play the game.

1041
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:03,960
And it sounds like it may not be the obvious way to get through the game either.

1042
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:09,040
I suppose, spoiler alert, but this game is how many years old at this point?

1043
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:13,240
It might be something like Undertale, where the fact that there is a pacifist approach

1044
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,720
you can take in that game is not necessarily obvious at first.

1045
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,400
You know what I mean?

1046
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,520
Those of you that have played it.

1047
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:24,080
So it'll be interesting to see what kind of playthroughs with that, especially now that

1048
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:24,720
people know.

1049
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,000
I'm sure there'll be some people that are looking for it.

1050
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,240
And of course, some people that maybe aren't into the uber violence like myself, I'm not

1051
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,400
really into uber violence.

1052
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,280
That might be an interesting approach for me to take, knowing that I don't have to

1053
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,640
dismember all these heads and things to actually win the game.

1054
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:40,440
So that's kind of neat.

1055
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:49,120
Also, on a related note with Cyberpunk 2077, also in that same interview, the game is

1056
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:53,800
built in such a way where you can actually complete it without necessarily getting

1057
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,520
through the main quest.

1058
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:00,080
A quote on that, we built the cyberpunk structure based on the conclusions we drew

1059
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:00,960
from The Witcher 3.

1060
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:05,200
The Witcher had the main stem of history and side threads departing from it.

1061
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,840
And this was our main structure, which we call the ear.

1062
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:13,200
So in cyberpunk structure, we have this wheat spike, which serves as its center, the

1063
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,360
main storyline with different subplots surrounding it, which can be triggered in

1064
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,280
various ways.

1065
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,320
Those subplots allow us to do something we've never done before.

1066
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:25,400
They change the main plot of the game, and they're doing that in such a way that you

1067
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:29,880
may not even finish the main plot, but still finish the game and get a completely

1068
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,440
different epilogue than the player with a different life path who made different

1069
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,160
choices, met different characters and form relationships with them.

1070
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,400
So very interesting type of approach to the game where it sounds like it's going to be

1071
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,560
very, I mean, there's open world games and then there's like open world games.

1072
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:49,320
And this definitely sounds like it's going to be open in all sorts of ways that the

1073
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,640
main quest isn't even necessarily what you beat to beat the game.

1074
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,160
And I think that's kind of fascinating in a way.

1075
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:59,600
I have to admit, I haven't been like as excited about cyberpunk just because I've

1076
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,400
kind of chalked it up to it's one of those open world games.

1077
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,400
I'm just not going to have the four hundred hours to beat.

1078
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,400
But the more I hear about it, the more I'm kind of like, hmm, that's interesting.

1079
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,120
I can't. They're doing some things with it.

1080
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,000
Yeah, I know you're on their day one.

1081
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,240
I know it, but we'll see.

1082
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,480
Can't wait. Yeah.

1083
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,320
All right. Moving on, Dark Sakura, I'm hoping you're still there.

1084
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,520
And you've got the next story.

1085
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,600
Yeah, I'm here. I just went off because I

1086
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,280
don't think anyone wants to watch me eat my dinner.

1087
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,600
I wish I had a way to turn my camera off because I was sitting here eating, too.

1088
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,680
And I don't have a thing to take my camera off.

1089
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,000
Sorry.

1090
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,480
Well, at any rate,

1091
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,640
there's also

1092
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:44,120
updates on the horizon for PS Now

1093
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:48,920
that basically in the form of a Sony patent

1094
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,920
that was updated that included some different details.

1095
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:55,640
So one of those things that they're talking about, the

1096
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:01,960
the some of the services for PS Now going on to PS5 to allow older games to offer

1097
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:08,680
segments that work as playable demos so they could cut up like different

1098
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,480
parts of the game and share them with other people so that they can get a feel

1099
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:16,600
for how the game is. Of course, there's no details

1100
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,480
about how exactly that's going to work, but it would be.

1101
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,240
But it's supposed to go on on PS Now.

1102
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,000
The other talk is that it could also just

1103
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:30,280
be for the sake of clips, but they're talking about it being something playable.

1104
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:35,520
The patent description states in one embodiment, a method is provided for

1105
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:40,800
creating a playable limited version of a video game and executed by a user of

1106
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,800
a complete version of a video game.

1107
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,320
So that's actually kind of cool.

1108
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,240
Yeah, that would be good.

1109
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,240
I just think it would be a really great way to to share experiences with people

1110
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,240
and try to get other people to to get in on some of these games.

1111
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,320
It definitely would spread the market

1112
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,080
because I mean, how many times do we lend out demo discs and whatnot?

1113
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,280
Kind of the same.

1114
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:08,280
Yeah, it's it's a real novel approach of kind of taking this idea of like watching

1115
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:11,000
a YouTube or a Twitch stream to kind of get a feel of a game.

1116
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,560
It's really kind of taking that to the next level where it's like,

1117
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:17,280
don't just watch this clip of the game, play this clip of the game.

1118
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:20,240
I think that's that's a really interesting approach.

1119
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:24,560
If that's again, we nothing is official until Sony says it's there.

1120
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,800
But if that's true, that's that is neat.

1121
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,160
That's that's a real next generation thing.

1122
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,600
You can do better. You try it.

1123
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,040
Yeah, it's well, it's an interesting

1124
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,880
approach that nobody seems to be interested in in Stadia.

1125
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:41,840
So, you know, Stadia's got this thing that will be out.

1126
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,440
So this is you can play your favorite.

1127
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,080
You'll be able to play with your favorite

1128
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,120
creator while the world watches with crowd play.

1129
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:53,600
So it means that people, I guess, will watch it live on YouTube.

1130
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,960
And then you can join in against like

1131
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:01,000
creators of the games and play versus on them, like bring about Dead by Daylight

1132
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,000
and Super Bomberman are online, so I mean, that's cool and all.

1133
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,400
But what are the odds you're actually going up against the developer?

1134
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,760
Or are we talking about, like,

1135
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:15,160
like essentially like a ghost racer in a game like Mario Kart or something or

1136
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,560
like one of the developers is the ghost racer and you're playing against them?

1137
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,560
I don't that makes sense.

1138
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,640
It does. Or you could be playing with the

1139
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:28,480
personal assistant of the second head of the unit.

1140
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,280
I mean, not that I wouldn't mind playing with a personal assistant or anything.

1141
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:35,160
I'm not putting that down, but I mean, I'm just saying it's kind of.

1142
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,640
It could be anybody.

1143
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:39,600
It almost sounds much like the

1144
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:45,400
not necessarily demos, like special versions of the games that they put on,

1145
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:51,360
like the Nintendo online and the Super Nintendo online.

1146
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,320
They're little like, yes, so tell of you.

1147
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,280
Oh, no, no, no, not necessarily that.

1148
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,080
I'm talking about the ones where it's like, well, it's a safe state.

1149
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,520
That's at the end of the game with all of this,

1150
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:05,640
you know, all of these power ups and go play, you know, or oh, hey,

1151
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:09,920
we started the game with like one hundred lives and all these equipment.

1152
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,640
It's SP. It's the SP games like there's

1153
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:16,720
the Kid Icarus SP that just starts you on the last level.

1154
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:22,000
Or the Zelda SP that starts you with two hundred fifty five rupees or something

1155
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,080
like that, I know what you're talking about.

1156
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,560
Yeah, you're right, it is kind of like that.

1157
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:29,920
Interesting, but but you're only getting into though.

1158
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,720
I mean, it's not like, yeah, you're at the end of the game with all this.

1159
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,640
It's like, let me send you something

1160
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:39,680
from the middle most boring part of the game, because I'm a good friend.

1161
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,400
Here, do all this farming.

1162
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:46,120
Welcome to my life or like a game like Celeste, I think is a good example, too.

1163
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:51,600
Like here's see if you can beat this random fucking hard ass room and get

1164
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,680
the strawberry that, you know, I could do earlier.

1165
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,040
Here you go. Have fun.

1166
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,600
That's as pretty neat.

1167
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,800
I'd be very curious what the limitations are on something like that.

1168
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,720
But it's it's a real rad idea.

1169
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,760
I think so. Yeah, I think so, too.

1170
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:10,000
All right. I'm looking forward to some of these newer developments.

1171
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I think the PlayStation stuff is becoming a little bit more exciting to me.

1172
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,280
Yeah, well, and it's it's these types

1173
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:20,040
of things that really start to feel next gen, so to speak.

1174
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,960
Like, you know, again, from a technological perspective, you know,

1175
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:27,360
how many more gigaflops or whatever can we get in the consoles?

1176
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,360
I think it's really these sorts of ideas

1177
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:33,440
that are going to start to feel like, oh, this is this is the next generation

1178
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:36,200
of gaming, this is the next generation of sharing.

1179
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,360
It's participating.

1180
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:40,320
You know, it's going to be very interesting.

1181
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:45,920
All right. Well, Loki, what are my chances I'll get a PS5?

1182
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:49,040
Hopefully better than they would normally be,

1183
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:53,800
apparently Sony has been ramping up production ahead of the launch of the

1184
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,640
console, and they're expecting or at least targeting 10 million consoles made by

1185
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:03,040
March 2021, so that would be within their fiscal year.

1186
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:08,480
Yeah, I hope that's actually going to happen, and I hope that that means that

1187
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,000
the console will be easier to get and that we're not going to have to,

1188
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,200
you know, fight the black markets to get that stuff.

1189
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,520
I'm thinking that maybe

1190
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:21,080
obviously that they're going to want to try to ramp that up just in general,

1191
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:25,840
because I think we're still going to be in like a pandemic scenario by the time

1192
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,760
that stuff rolls around anyways.

1193
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:30,920
And a lot of people suck at home, got to have something to do.

1194
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,560
You know, it makes sense that you want to launch it with as many units as possible.

1195
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,080
So I hope that's actually going to be the case.

1196
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,800
And maybe, you know, that the whole COVID-19

1197
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,040
situation doesn't affect production too much.

1198
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,840
But we'll have to wait and see, I guess.

1199
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:50,360
Or they may be just not going to have a problem selling those consoles because

1200
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,760
it's going to be too damn expensive and no one's going to buy them.

1201
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,760
Well, they're not making the consoles in

1202
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:59,800
this country and they're not making them in Brazil or what's the other?

1203
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,360
Is it Russia that's third right now?

1204
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,360
So it's they're not making them there.

1205
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:08,280
So, I mean, COVID, COVID is still a global issue,

1206
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,320
but other countries have it in control.

1207
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:13,320
This is this is it's really a U.S. problem right now.

1208
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,000
I mean, in Brazil and other countries.

1209
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,360
But we're number one.

1210
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,960
Yeah, we're number one.

1211
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,600
All right. We're winning.

1212
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,240
It's all this winning I've been told about.

1213
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,600
So anyway, sorry, we know and we shouldn't

1214
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:28,560
make light of what is really horrific, but like in this type of

1215
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:32,600
situation, like a morbid sense of humor is the only thing that's carrying me

1216
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:37,560
through right now, because otherwise I would just be so upset and angry.

1217
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:38,880
So.

1218
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:40,400
Anyway,

1219
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:41,920
let's see,

1220
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:45,440
DJ Rama S talking about Sony versus Microsoft in chat saying,

1221
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:49,720
regardless of which console drops first, I'll be getting the Xbox Series X first

1222
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,920
between backwards compatibility and Game Pass.

1223
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,320
I'm sold.

1224
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,440
VG Realness in chat talking a little bit about the last story,

1225
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,640
although it all ties into PlayStation 5, says at the same time,

1226
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:03,640
a feature like that doesn't seem like something that needs a new console to pull

1227
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,640
off. True, especially because SharePlay is

1228
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,840
already something that exists on the PlayStation 4.

1229
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,840
But since they are rebuilding the interface

1230
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:18,280
completely for PlayStation 5, I would say there'd be a lot to go

1231
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:23,240
with how seamless that is, how easy that is for them to build into that.

1232
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,640
But you are right to the extent of they

1233
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,720
could probably just build it into the PlayStation 4.

1234
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,520
But I suppose it also goes back to what we were talking about at the very beginning

1235
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:36,360
of the show is that Microsoft could stop charging for gold tomorrow if they want.

1236
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:40,640
But there's something very symbolic about doing it with Xbox Series X that could be

1237
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:44,360
very interesting if that does pan out and ends up being true.

1238
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,680
It's almost almost like you kind of tie

1239
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,160
that feature to the new generation, if that makes sense.

1240
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:55,280
So anyhow, let's move on to our next story, which is something I would like to play

1241
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:59,720
with backwards compatibility, even on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.

1242
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:04,880
Although knowing this game, it will probably get a rerelease on those systems

1243
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:08,680
and will probably have even more features because this game just won't stop.

1244
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,360
It's No Man's Sky.

1245
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:15,360
And No Man's Sky got yet another big update this week.

1246
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,480
What did they add? Something called Desolation.

1247
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,840
It's a free update, as they all have been.

1248
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:23,560
And now you have new freighters in the game.

1249
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,240
And it's supposed to be kind of like a scary type of experience.

1250
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,280
The freighters are procedurally

1251
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,840
generated, like everything else in the game, of course.

1252
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:35,880
And so wherever you find one, it'll be different every time.

1253
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,680
You'll find ship logs, personal possessions,

1254
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:41,600
and it'll talk about what happened to the crew that used to be there.

1255
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,560
Yikes.

1256
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,440
They brought a little bit of dead space into...

1257
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:46,480
They brought a little bit of dead space in No Man's Sky.

1258
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:47,720
That's exactly right.

1259
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,360
You might find in these places the lights

1260
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:55,040
are off or the gravity is off or the life support systems have gone wrong.

1261
01:04:55,240 --> 01:05:00,640
There will also be biological horrors that will be there to respond to you.

1262
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,720
So that might be a little scary.

1263
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,640
What is interesting, though, is that now,

1264
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:08,480
if you didn't know, No Man's Sky truly is multiplayer now.

1265
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,680
So you don't have to explore these things on your own.

1266
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,120
You can do it with other people.

1267
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:15,680
If you really want to kick up that horror,

1268
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:19,040
don't forget No Man's Sky also got a VR update some time ago.

1269
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:22,080
So you could do this whole thing in VR if you want,

1270
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:26,200
if you want, underlined and italicized.

1271
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:26,840
But yeah.

1272
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,080
And of course, if you get through these

1273
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:31,720
freighters, you get big rewards that you can use on your own starship.

1274
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:36,440
And they say it will reflect the history of ships you've scavenged.

1275
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,720
That's kind of interesting.

1276
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,280
So, yeah, so that is yet another.

1277
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,800
And of course, this update also comes

1278
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,120
with bug fixes and the other types of minor updates.

1279
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,760
But as much as it's almost meme-able

1280
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:51,480
at this point that No Man's Sky got yet another update,

1281
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:57,680
it is pretty awesome that this game that everybody hated right out the gate has not

1282
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:01,720
stopped and has remained committed to filling out that full vision,

1283
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,160
which quite honestly, if they had stopped six months ago,

1284
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:08,000
I don't think anybody would have faulted them and said,

1285
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,680
oh, you never delivered us a full game.

1286
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,360
You know, they they've they delivered us

1287
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,760
a full game and a lot of good stuff a long time ago.

1288
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:18,480
But this like it almost feels like now they just want to one up their critics.

1289
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:22,000
And that's fine, too, because the game just keeps going.

1290
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,320
But, you know, I was talking about this

1291
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,760
with Alan yesterday and he did bring up a good point.

1292
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:30,560
And that was that he kind of like he was playing it for a little bit,

1293
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:33,560
but almost got frustrated that whenever there was a big update,

1294
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,120
it was like, I have to like relearn the game.

1295
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:40,280
I have to like restart because all these things have changed in the game.

1296
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:42,520
I don't think you necessarily have to restart.

1297
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,160
But sometimes you just like there's that

1298
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:47,200
psychological part that's like, I've missed all this stuff.

1299
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,800
So I need to go back to the beginning and re-experience it all.

1300
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,520
And so I kind of get that, too, where it's like, hey, guys,

1301
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,640
hello, games, what you're doing is fabulous.

1302
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,760
And we love that you supported the game this long.

1303
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,760
But at the same time, could you kind of tell us, like, when you're done

1304
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:09,200
so that we know it's it's safe to go exploring now and that it's I don't know,

1305
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,160
like, is it's kind of a fine line.

1306
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,560
What do you guys think in chat?

1307
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,080
Do they keep building out the game or

1308
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:19,120
is it time to just stop and let us experience what there is?

1309
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:21,600
What do you think, Loki or Dark Sakura?

1310
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,880
I still have to go back to play the game.

1311
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:28,360
It's been a while and I've got a PC now, so I need to do that.

1312
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:34,320
But I don't know if I don't know if I want to play it in VR and go into one of those

1313
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,440
new freighters.

1314
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:41,920
Well, I think that for them, this is actually kind of

1315
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:46,160
a way to keep a franchise alive without actually having to do too much work to it.

1316
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:47,640
Does that make sense?

1317
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,240
Sure. I mean, I get it.

1318
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:53,040
It is work, but it's I guess starting from scratch is a lot more work.

1319
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,240
Creating No Man's Sky, too, is even more work.

1320
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,200
I get it. Exactly.

1321
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:00,200
So in this way, they get to keep

1322
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,520
putting out more content

1323
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:08,320
without having to go through all the.

1324
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,880
The strains of

1325
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:15,680
the best way to put it, without the strains of having to recreate their world,

1326
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:20,120
it's just adding on and adding on like they've got infinite property and you're

1327
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:24,320
just adding new it's like it's like Sarah Winchester in her house.

1328
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,120
Or anyone who don't know,

1329
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:31,360
you know, this is the Winchester Mystery House of Games.

1330
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,760
No, that's right on the money.

1331
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,200
That's that's a perfect answer.

1332
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:38,040
No, that is the perfect comparison.

1333
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:40,440
No Man's Sky is the Winchester Mystery House of Games.

1334
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,240
You're absolutely right.

1335
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:47,960
Yeah. And but hey, you know, she kept doing it until she died.

1336
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,120
And nature tried to knock it over and guess what?

1337
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:53,680
The house fucking stood.

1338
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:57,760
So No Man's Sky is going to stand just like the Winchester Mystery House.

1339
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:01,360
I think I think the Winchester Mystery House might be a local reference,

1340
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,920
like most people from Northern California probably understand the joke.

1341
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:06,120
There's that movie. Oh, that's right.

1342
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,560
They made a movie out of it. I forgot.

1343
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,280
It wasn't good, though. I don't think a lot of people saw it.

1344
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,680
So if you don't want to see it, I love that place.

1345
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,400
There's this woman and Winchester was like a gun company or something, right?

1346
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,200
And she it was actually the Winchester Rifle Company.

1347
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,400
Yeah, she there's this house in San Jose

1348
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,040
and everybody knows it because everybody took a field trip there at some point

1349
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:24,640
in their life while they grew up in this area.

1350
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:28,000
And so she kept building and building and building to this house because she

1351
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,080
believed she was being haunted or something like that.

1352
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,480
Like the victims of the story.

1353
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:37,960
The story goes is that because her husband's guns had killed so many

1354
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:44,280
Native Americans that she that she thought she was being haunted by by their spirits.

1355
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,480
She saw a medium who said that she wasn't

1356
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:49,760
going to die until construction stopped on the house.

1357
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:54,120
I mean, there's a lot there's she was a pretty private lady on top of it.

1358
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:57,760
So there's really not a whole lot that's known.

1359
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:01,600
But, you know, the house itself is absolutely amazing.

1360
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,600
I've been on the extended tour.

1361
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:10,280
Chris and I went before they moved out to Wisconsin.

1362
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,880
I have a secret I've never been.

1363
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,640
But I've beautiful I've done Rocky Horror

1364
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,080
Picture Show in the movie theater next door.

1365
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,520
And yes, there is a movie theater next door.

1366
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,320
That was where I saw the labyrinth.

1367
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,880
It's it's right in the middle of San Jose.

1368
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,280
It's like they tear it down, though.

1369
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:29,880
So the movie theater they did, they were going to tear down because we had

1370
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,120
a mutual friend who was the manager there for many years.

1371
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,120
That's right. Yeah.

1372
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:36,880
So but they finally turn it down at any rate.

1373
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:40,520
I mean, and you go into this and it's actually going back to No Man's Sky.

1374
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:41,760
You go through and you have all this

1375
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:46,000
discovery and you find these interesting little things and things that look like

1376
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:51,920
their purpose, purposeless, I guess that's sort of making up just now purposeless.

1377
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:57,440
Like she has a seance room that has a door that leads to a two story drop.

1378
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:01,320
There are stairs that go to nowhere just to the ceiling.

1379
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,480
She collected so much Tiffany.

1380
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:06,480
There's like they've got a whole room dedicated to the Tiffany that she

1381
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,840
collected and these teensy tiny little stairs.

1382
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,640
But if you think about it again in terms

1383
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,960
of the game being like the Winchester Mystery House,

1384
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,280
doesn't the game have kind of weird dead ends like that, too?

1385
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:21,440
So we have a we have a mutual friend and I don't want to out them here on the show,

1386
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:27,480
but he lives kind of out in a rural area in a very kind of older home.

1387
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:30,320
And we always kind of joke that he lived in the Winchester Mystery House because he

1388
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:34,440
legit had this like room where, like, you would open a door and there just be a

1389
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:40,520
brick wall there like, yeah, there was crazy stuff like that in the house.

1390
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,520
And we're like, dude, your house is haunted.

1391
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:43,600
But he loves it there.

1392
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,560
So anyway.

1393
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,240
All right. Sorry, we got on a tangent, but that's OK.

1394
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:48,840
We're educated.

1395
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,880
Let me ask you to have an email.

1396
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:56,280
No. Oh, OK, I'll tell you later.

1397
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,480
I'll text you. It's somebody local.

1398
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,680
OK, OK, because I want to go there now.

1399
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,240
OK, I texted you, OK,

1400
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:10,520
but at any rate, at any rate, I'll just look at pictures of the Winchester Mystery.

1401
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:12,800
Oh, OK, cool.

1402
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,680
I love him. I haven't talked to him in so long.

1403
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,400
Yeah, it's been a while for me, too.

1404
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,880
But at any rate.

1405
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,960
I think when you look at the Winchester

1406
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:28,560
Mystery House and you look at the the game there, yeah, it is the Winchester

1407
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:32,840
Mystery House of games, I feel confident in giving it that moniker.

1408
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,960
No, that's great. And who even needs to expand on that?

1409
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,280
OK. Hype mayhem.

1410
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,720
I know you know what I meant.

1411
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:43,200
He says, OK, not going to lie, even though I know what Jamie meant by Tiffany,

1412
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:48,360
I also made a connection to the team from 80s that saying I think we're alone now.

1413
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,240
Now, you know what?

1414
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,240
Tiffany was a great singer.

1415
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,320
She did more than malls.

1416
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:57,800
OK, one point I have to get back to, though, that's very important with this is

1417
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,720
that the whole and you brought up this idea of Dark Soccer with your Winchester

1418
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:06,120
Mystery House comparison is that that there is particularly like new features

1419
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:11,320
and new things that might expose the game to a new audience that hasn't experienced

1420
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:15,520
the game yet. And a lot of you guys in chat are kind of when you hear that

1421
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,320
they've built this jump scare thing in a no man's sky.

1422
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:19,680
They've built a dead space type game.

1423
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:22,360
A lot of you guys in chat are like, nope, nope, man.

1424
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:26,080
Sky nope. And out of that, not for me, it's not what I want to do.

1425
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:28,760
But if you think about it, and I'm sure all of you can see this,

1426
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:32,000
there is an audience that loves scary games.

1427
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,560
Look at some of the big stuff that streamed on Twitch.

1428
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:35,920
A lot of scary games. Right.

1429
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:40,520
And there's probably an audience out there that when they hear, oh, did you hear?

1430
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:43,080
No man's sky has like a full on horror mode.

1431
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,720
Now people are going to be like, what really?

1432
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:49,360
I need to go back and visit that game or I need to pick that game up already.

1433
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,160
It's on sale again or whatever it is.

1434
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:55,280
So even though you might look at that feature and go, that's really not for me.

1435
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,960
I think you can see where, oh, there's somebody else is going to look at that

1436
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,560
and go, oh, I should check that out.

1437
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:01,920
That's that's my jam.

1438
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:03,480
I love horror games.

1439
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,760
So kind of interesting anyway.

1440
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,600
All right, let's move on.

1441
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,840
More big stories.

1442
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:12,720
I think this one's yours, Loki, or who's there?

1443
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:14,520
Is it mine? Where are we at even?

1444
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:17,080
It would be Jamie. Oh, it's Jamie again.

1445
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:18,440
Yep. Well, shit.

1446
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:21,400
I was going to eat some more pizza, but OK.

1447
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:27,280
So there, you know, we often complain about Metacritic with, you know,

1448
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:30,440
especially like when there's games that come out that people just want to

1449
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:34,640
immediately poo poo on because they want to, you know, there was a woman

1450
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:38,640
developed it or a writer or they don't like the storyline and they're just

1451
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:42,040
really doing that soon now, you know, we call that review bombing.

1452
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:42,760
Right.

1453
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:48,560
So it's become such a big issue now that Metacritic announced that they're going

1454
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:55,440
to delay user reviews for a video game for thirty six hours after the game's release.

1455
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:59,800
And they quote that their decision is based on, here's the quote,

1456
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,360
data driven research and with the input of critics and industry experts.

1457
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:05,520
So here's the rest of it.

1458
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:09,480
We recently implemented implemented the thirty six hour waiting period for all

1459
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:14,000
user reviews in our game section to ensure our gamers have time to play these games

1460
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:17,320
before writing their reviews, a Metacritic spokesperson said.

1461
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,400
The new waiting period is for user reviews, for user reviews have been rolled out

1462
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:24,920
across Metacritic's game section and was based on data driven research

1463
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,720
with the input of critics and industry standards.

1464
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,560
Now, we know that if they want to bomb it, they're going to bomb it.

1465
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:36,120
But my hope with this is that they're going to.

1466
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:40,000
They're going to, you know, kind of push people off that immediate thing

1467
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,160
when they see that they can't get their

1468
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:44,800
immediate reward out of it, then hopefully they're not going to do it.

1469
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,320
Now, on top of that, just to add in another layer on things,

1470
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:52,640
and this has actually been going on for quite a while, you know,

1471
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:58,040
developers are really unhappy with how Metacritic was handling it before,

1472
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:02,360
because, you know, some of those reviews are the lifeblood of of their their

1473
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:06,360
careers, their games, you know, so.

1474
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,240
I think this is this is a good step,

1475
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:13,440
whether or not it will work remains to be seen, but, you know.

1476
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:19,840
Yeah, with the whole Metacritic thing, I mean, I just just don't listen to user

1477
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:24,680
reviews in the first place, that kind of would fix the problem, in my opinion.

1478
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:29,680
Well, but the thing is, it's supposed to be, you know,

1479
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:32,920
what's the word I'm thinking of, it's supposed to be

1480
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,400
community driven as well.

1481
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,360
So, I don't know.

1482
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,080
Yeah, I mean, it's it's not going to stop

1483
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:44,760
people from reviewing games on their Twitter account or on their Facebook feed

1484
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,920
or on other places with social media or what have you.

1485
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:53,880
But, you know, I guess Metacritic, if they want to stop being known as like the home

1486
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:59,040
of terrible user reviews because games keep getting bombed because it's a game

1487
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:03,960
for SJWs or whatever thing people are mad about with the with the games.

1488
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:06,600
I I can understand where Metacritic's like,

1489
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,600
we got to do something like this is getting crazy.

1490
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:14,480
I don't think it's going to really I mean, maybe it'll just

1491
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:18,560
calm them down a little bit, but like, I think they're going to still review bomb

1492
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:23,360
and they'll review bomb in other places like Steam or something.

1493
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:25,040
Yeah, that's true.

1494
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:29,440
Do you do you think other you know, sometimes when a company does this,

1495
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:34,720
it sets something in motion where like other companies start to follow suit a little bit.

1496
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,920
Do you think Metacritic might be setting

1497
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:39,880
a standard that sites like Steam and so forth are going to follow?

1498
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,240
Although I don't know, Steam also just

1499
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:44,480
shows like right there, like you've played for this many hours.

1500
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:46,920
So you like you like know on Steam right away,

1501
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:50,680
like this person actually played the game or they're full of shit.

1502
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:55,960
Yeah, I don't know if that's going to necessarily I think that I know Metacritic

1503
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:58,640
is kind of garbage when it comes to user reviews anyways.

1504
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,440
I mean, that's what a lot of people think.

1505
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:05,560
So it would be nice to have it not be garbage.

1506
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,400
I don't know, I just kind of

1507
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,880
just consider it just a complete garbage and look at the user reviews.

1508
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:17,640
It's a good aggregate for like, you know, professional reviews, but

1509
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:22,960
people want their voices heard and they're going to wait three days if they have to.

1510
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:26,680
Or like I said, it's going to

1511
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:29,400
it's going to make it not fun for them anymore having to wait.

1512
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,640
And so there's not going to be any point in doing it.

1513
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:36,680
Games do make so much of their buck right when they launch, though, you know,

1514
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:41,480
like that that launch week, that launch day is so important that even delaying

1515
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:44,800
that by three days might kind of sway things one way or another.

1516
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,680
I look a lot with Mass Effect Andromeda, I think is a good example of that,

1517
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:52,200
because remember how like a lot of the negativity for that game,

1518
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:55,520
which, you know, in retrospect may have been too much,

1519
01:18:55,720 --> 01:19:00,120
really came out because it was released on that EA Access or whatever about three

1520
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:03,720
days before the main might have been a little more like maybe like six or seven

1521
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:08,960
days, but it came out a few days before it hit every other site.

1522
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:13,240
And that's when people tore this game apart and we're showing off all the bugs

1523
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,200
that hit social media and all this other stuff.

1524
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:19,920
And it kind of did impact, I would say, how much that game sold on day one was

1525
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:25,760
because EA did that preview for their monthly whatever peoples.

1526
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,200
And I don't think like,

1527
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:32,480
you know, my initial concern was that this is some other thing that they're going

1528
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:36,360
to use, and when I say they, I mean, like the game industry is going to use

1529
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:40,960
to try to hide negative reviews for, you know, legitimate stuff.

1530
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,720
Like, for example, when they're adding loot boxes in, you know,

1531
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,240
a lot of times you'll see these review

1532
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:50,280
embargoes until, you know, the release date where they're hiding that stuff

1533
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:53,160
in there so that people are unaware of it when they're making their purchases

1534
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:55,320
or their preorders, when I don't think that's going to be

1535
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:58,920
the case for this, I think it's more just to cut down on the garbage.

1536
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,480
But you're just delaying the inevitable.

1537
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:05,360
And if people are going to complain about game or if there's like something that is

1538
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:09,120
really wrong with something, there's plenty of other outlets to complain about that.

1539
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,560
Yeah, you are right in that.

1540
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:11,680
They're going to just go to Twitter.

1541
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:12,600
They're going to go to Facebook.

1542
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,800
They're going to go to other social media platforms.

1543
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:19,280
Twitter being the biggest one that comes to mind and and have their way there.

1544
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:20,680
So

1545
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,360
going to chat for some comments.

1546
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:27,320
Quest Buster in chat says, I remember the early looks from Andromeda's

1547
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:31,520
early access via EA Origins went viral over the flaws.

1548
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:35,720
Yeah, that was that was a huge, huge, I think, faux pas to put.

1549
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:39,920
I mean, it's a weird thing because I want to say it was really bad to put that out

1550
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,000
early so that all those bugs could be called out.

1551
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:45,800
But at the same time, those bugs needed to be called out.

1552
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,320
That game was released half to bake, even though it was delayed a bunch of times.

1553
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,440
It needed to be delayed one more time.

1554
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:55,320
Cyberpunk has the right idea in that regard.

1555
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,160
And, you know, if even though we can all

1556
01:20:57,160 --> 01:21:00,880
look at cyberpunk and go, oh, God, they are delaying that game again.

1557
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,520
Well, do you want it to be?

1558
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:05,000
Do you want it to be Mass Effect Andromeda?

1559
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:08,040
So, you know, they might have to delay it again.

1560
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:09,280
So.

1561
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:11,640
All right. Anyway, let's move on.

1562
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,600
We have some more stories, Loki.

1563
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:20,560
All right. So like most things are convention related,

1564
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:23,680
everything's kind of gone to this whole digital equivalent.

1565
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:27,680
And that's going to be the same thing that's going to happen to QuakeCon,

1566
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:30,160
which is held every year around August.

1567
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:34,120
And so this year they're going to be doing in QuakeCon at Home 2020.

1568
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:37,480
It's going to be set between August 7th and the 9th.

1569
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:41,240
And they're going to have various events that are going to go along with that.

1570
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:43,240
So they're going to have the global super stream.

1571
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:49,160
It's going to feature news and different updates about Bethesda products.

1572
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:56,360
They're going to have the QuakeCon Pro League and QuakeCon World Championships.

1573
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,760
And yeah, they're also still having a prize pool up there.

1574
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:05,080
So $150,000 up for grabs.

1575
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:08,480
I'm not really I mean.

1576
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:09,520
It'll be neat.

1577
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:11,360
It's nice that they're going to be able

1578
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,680
to carry on with this, even though they can't do an in-person event.

1579
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,360
But

1580
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:17,880
I don't know.

1581
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,920
Not super excited about Bethesda these days.

1582
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:24,440
I'm kind of like, let's see what the big news is that comes out about it.

1583
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,680
You know, like if there's a new another Quake, I don't know.

1584
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:31,320
What are we expecting that you're going to release another Quake game at some point?

1585
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,280
Or is it still just about the champions game?

1586
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,600
I don't know if there's any other news,

1587
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:41,240
although I do see here in this article, they're talking about some new T-shirts

1588
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:43,120
and those look pretty nice.

1589
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:48,480
Like they have the Dovahkin and there's the Caddo demon.

1590
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:50,840
But they're pretty cool.

1591
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:52,880
I do still have a lot of love for classic

1592
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:57,680
Quake, though, because I used to play that on LAN in college

1593
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:01,360
with friends who had high speed Internet at their university.

1594
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,280
And I would dial in and and play with them Quake.

1595
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,120
We had a lot of fun with that.

1596
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:06,560
And I think that was I think we would do

1597
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:09,600
Team Fortress 2 back in the because, you know, that's where Team Fortress started

1598
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,040
was a Quake mod, so it's good.

1599
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:15,040
So what other what the other thing that's kind of cool about this, too,

1600
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,080
is there are live streams that they're going to be doing as well.

1601
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:20,800
They're going to be donating the proceeds to those two different charities.

1602
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,040
So you have the Direct Relief UNICEF

1603
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:26,640
for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the Trevor Project.

1604
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:27,760
Cool.

1605
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:30,520
And then they're also saying that you can

1606
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:36,280
also donate as well to the Dallas Pet Alive and 4paws.

1607
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:37,120
Very cool.

1608
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:41,080
I love that they're turning it into a charity thing at this point.

1609
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,520
So that's that's a good use.

1610
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,760
Great. Yeah.

1611
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:45,360
All right. Let's move on.

1612
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:49,600
And this this kind of falls in the whole like rumors category.

1613
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:54,320
But there's there's a little there's a little smoke with this one

1614
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,880
that shows there might be a little fire.

1615
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:59,880
And this has to do with some Twitter accounts that that were recently

1616
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:03,120
registered and it appears they were registered by Nintendo.

1617
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:05,160
There was a Twitter account called

1618
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:11,000
at Super Mario 35th that was registered back in March of this year

1619
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:16,160
that somebody recently found and it looks like, oh, there might be something

1620
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:18,160
going on for Super Mario's 35th anniversary.

1621
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:23,840
We had heard we've heard earlier rumors that Nintendo plans to do like re releases

1622
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:27,120
of old Mario games this holiday and really kind of like, you know,

1623
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:31,320
put out old Mario stuff again on the switch for this anniversary,

1624
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:33,760
maybe like a souped up version of Mario 64, things like that.

1625
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,280
Mario Sunshine might make a comeback.

1626
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,120
We've heard these rumors before.

1627
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:42,000
And now we see a Twitter account that kind of goes, oh, there might be something there.

1628
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,040
Who knows now?

1629
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:46,360
A lot of you probably thinking what I first thought when I saw this is I was

1630
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:49,200
like, any idiot can roll a Twitter account with any name they want.

1631
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:53,040
But I didn't realize you could do this.

1632
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:57,720
One thing you can do on Twitter is you can go in and you can request to reset your

1633
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:01,440
password. Well, I knew you could do that, but it actually shows you.

1634
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:05,520
It says, like, you know, do you have your email address or whatever?

1635
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:08,640
And it says email

1636
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:09,880
with a link.

1637
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:13,720
So that would be the email that's tied to the Twitter account.

1638
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:18,200
Well, while you can't see the whole email, it masks it for privacy reasons that,

1639
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:21,840
you know, whoever you don't want to be given out, especially like celebrities,

1640
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,360
like you don't want to know the email behind Lady Gaga's account.

1641
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:26,720
Right. That would be too much.

1642
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:31,520
But what's interesting, it says email a link to it says ML and then a bunch of

1643
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:35,960
asterisks, like it's somebody's name at and

1644
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:39,480
blank, blank, blank, blank, dot, blank, blank, dot, blank, blank,

1645
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:45,920
which is the perfect length for at Nintendo dot co dot JP.

1646
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:51,200
And what somebody noticed is that it is the same email link,

1647
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:54,200
like the same like chain of letters as

1648
01:25:54,400 --> 01:26:00,080
the official Splatoon JP account and the Smash Brothers JP account.

1649
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:05,840
So it looks like this Super Mario thirty fifth may be something official.

1650
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:09,760
But are you ready for the real whopper?

1651
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:12,840
Because that isn't the only Twitter account that was made.

1652
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,440
There is another Twitter account that was made.

1653
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:21,360
And that it is at we're finally going to make an F-Zero game.

1654
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:26,040
It Loki, it is at F-Zero, JP is the other that is no joke.

1655
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:28,880
That is the other that is the other Twitter account.

1656
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:30,320
Way to ruin my hype.

1657
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:31,200
It really is.

1658
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:36,240
OK, you know, I thought it was I thought it was a fucking joke, too.

1659
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:39,760
And the same thing they went through and tried to reset the password.

1660
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:43,640
And it's the same link such and such at at like, like, like.

1661
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:46,760
So F-Zero JP appears to be an account.

1662
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:50,400
Now, before we get too carried away, this could be a lot of things.

1663
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:55,800
This could be just them protecting their IP, which Nintendo is notorious to do,

1664
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,680
so that nobody else rolls this account.

1665
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:02,000
It could be maybe we get a re it doesn't necessarily mean a new F-Zero game.

1666
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:07,520
It could be a rerelease of F-Zero GX and AX, which I would be totally happy with.

1667
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:10,280
To be quite honest, I'd be totally good with that.

1668
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:13,400
It could be that. Who knows?

1669
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,200
You know, there was a lot of rumors.

1670
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:19,680
Again, now we're really going to the rumor farm, but whatever, who cares?

1671
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:22,040
There was a lot of rumors

1672
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:25,840
that one of the games that Nintendo bumped back from this holiday

1673
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:29,720
that they've been working hard on was Mario Kart nine.

1674
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:32,800
What if and humor me for a minute here,

1675
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:37,840
what if somewhere along the way, Mario Kart nine became a new F-Zero game?

1676
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,880
I mean, there's enough.

1677
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:43,160
I don't see that.

1678
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,440
Well, look at something like 250 CC, for God's sake.

1679
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:48,880
It plays pretty crazy fast and there's

1680
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:54,160
perfectly competent F-Zero tracks and stuff in Mario Kart.

1681
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:57,360
Like maybe they decided to make Mario Kart

1682
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:00,760
nine an F-Zero game instead somewhere along the way.

1683
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:05,520
Again, I completely realize I'm being tinfoil, hatty and

1684
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:09,200
you know, rumor mongering and all that stuff. Fine.

1685
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,880
But this Twitter account is interesting.

1686
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:14,880
It does appear Nintendo did register it.

1687
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:16,040
So

1688
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:18,080
SDG100Matt says, don't do this.

1689
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:19,320
Don't mess with us like this.

1690
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:22,640
Sorry. Orange Right says, I'll believe it when I see it.

1691
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:24,720
Same at the end of the day.

1692
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:28,080
Zetenchant says in chat says too late.

1693
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:30,440
He opened the box. It can't be closed again.

1694
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:32,240
Yeah, I went I went there.

1695
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:33,840
Sorry. I bought a house there.

1696
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:35,480
I live there.

1697
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:36,600
What can we do?

1698
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:40,720
Hype Mayhem says Mario Kart versus F-Zero.

1699
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:44,360
That I wouldn't get.

1700
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:48,520
I mean, in a way, you kind of already have that in Mario Kart eight,

1701
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:52,680
but a full on versus, that would be a little weird to me because, you know,

1702
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:56,480
F-Zero is supposed to be more science fictiony, but maybe maybe they're going

1703
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,640
to take it in a cartoony direction. I don't know.

1704
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:02,320
It's too early to say we have a fucking Twitter account and nothing else.

1705
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:04,640
I just need Nintendo to have a direct already.

1706
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:08,040
I think that's what we all want, but we'll see.

1707
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:09,520
Who knows?

1708
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,200
All right.

1709
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:12,600
Whoo. All right.

1710
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:16,360
Anyhow, enough of rumors with that, but that one got me really excited.

1711
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,360
I'm still laughing that you kind of ruined the punch line there.

1712
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,640
Loki would like, oh, what's it going to be, a new F-Zero?

1713
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,040
Well, actually.

1714
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:26,400
Well, actually.

1715
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:28,760
All right, anyway, Dark Sakura,

1716
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:32,760
you have another story for us before we get to our classic segment.

1717
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:34,080
I do.

1718
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:35,760
I think so about.

1719
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:37,000
Yeah, yeah, I do.

1720
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:40,840
Sorry, I was used to going right into my classic game.

1721
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:43,680
So, yeah, anyway.

1722
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:49,120
There is a Twitch streamer who built a computer inside of a video game

1723
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:55,640
and it was done in let's see, it was.

1724
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:59,400
Oh, my gosh, why can't I read so anyway,

1725
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:02,840
a person named Tyler Hill built a reduced

1726
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:08,840
instruction set computer RSC inside of another sandbox adventure game called

1727
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,640
Astroneer.

1728
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:15,280
He is kind of known for trying to build computers inside of video games.

1729
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:18,400
So he actually posted it.

1730
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,120
There's a link on Twitter to it.

1731
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:23,800
And he did a demo.

1732
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,600
It's actually out there public.

1733
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:28,880
And he actually even explained how he did it.

1734
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:32,640
So it looks like it's really just like a huge countdown.

1735
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:36,520
So it's basically just very optimized

1736
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:39,840
instructions, given a place to live in this game.

1737
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:42,240
So I thought it was pretty cool.

1738
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:49,840
But at any rate, yeah, it's it's it's a program ception, game ception,

1739
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:51,640
compu ception.

1740
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:55,360
No, it's that they built they built a game inside a game.

1741
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:57,800
More like a counter inside a game.

1742
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,960
But still, it's computing within computing.

1743
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:01,360
Yeah, no, I think that's super cool.

1744
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:05,040
Like, it makes me think of people that when they're like an emulator built

1745
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:06,840
in Minecraft or something like that, I want to I don't know.

1746
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:09,600
I might be just making shit up.

1747
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,680
Gameboy emulator, I think at one time.

1748
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:13,080
OK, so that's that's pretty cool.

1749
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,040
But the fact that somebody kind of broke

1750
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:18,360
it down even to like what a computer's kind of like bare roots are,

1751
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:19,320
I think that's pretty cool.

1752
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:21,040
And I love that they streamed it, too,

1753
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:25,240
so that you can actually go back and learn something, so to speak.

1754
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,120
So cool.

1755
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:27,920
All right.

1756
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:32,840
Well, now I suppose we can take a step back and take a look at Dark Sakura's

1757
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:38,720
classic game of the week every week here on Orange on Tradio.

1758
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:42,400
Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey,

1759
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:45,080
you brats ought to be checking this game out this week.

1760
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:49,680
But once a month in the year 2020, she, instead of spotlighting a classic

1761
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:54,080
video game, likes to spotlight a classic pinball table.

1762
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:57,600
And what is the table going to be this week?

1763
01:31:57,800 --> 01:32:02,920
I'm doing one that we're borrowing right now that is very stiff.

1764
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:06,880
And I'm doing this in honor of the new

1765
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:10,320
Sternbell Vira game that's coming out that.

1766
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:13,680
Oh, my gosh, Rob, if you haven't seen it,

1767
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:16,080
it's it's pretty, pretty cool.

1768
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:17,760
It's a

1769
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:20,520
got one of the video screens and everything.

1770
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:25,000
And it plays back like old black and white B movies while she does

1771
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:28,080
commentary on it, Elvira's House of Horrors.

1772
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:30,360
But we're not talking about the new pinball.

1773
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,160
We're talking about the old pinball.

1774
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:33,960
So

1775
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:37,640
scared stiff came out in 1996.

1776
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:42,680
It was designed by Dennis Nordman, released by Midway as Bally.

1777
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:46,120
And it features Elvira, the actress of the dark.

1778
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:48,600
And it's the follow up to 1989's

1779
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:52,080
Elvira and the Party Monsters was also designed by Nordman.

1780
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:55,520
Now, the reason I didn't go with the one

1781
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:59,920
in 1989 because I'm pretty much doing 90s and up for pinball.

1782
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:03,520
I'm basically picking where we started getting the DMDs and everything.

1783
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:08,640
So not any of the little ticker bars like Black Knight, the one before was very much

1784
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:11,920
like the same type of scoring like Black Knight did.

1785
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:15,720
But anyway, the game, of course, has a B movie horror thing.

1786
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:18,280
You have to go through tales of terror

1787
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:23,800
to level up on the Stiff-O-Meter and you have Eyes of the Boating Beast,

1788
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,880
Terror from the Crate, The Stiff in the Coffin, The Monster's Lab,

1789
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:31,440
Night of the Leapers, and Return of the Deadheads.

1790
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:37,240
You also have an interactive back box that has a spinning slider,

1791
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:41,800
sorry, a spinning spider, my gosh, and you use it to collect different

1792
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:45,720
features and start special modes, and it uses the DSC sound system.

1793
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:47,440
It was

1794
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:56,920
one of those games that when they did the exhibition at the 1996 AMOA show,

1795
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:00,520
Miss Cassandra Peterson showed up as Elvira to promote the game.

1796
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:02,200
Pretty cool.

1797
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:07,160
Now, it was supposed to have these little rubber bogeyman features,

1798
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:10,760
slingshots that were supposed to move forward with the kicker.

1799
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:15,480
It was when you hit the slingshot and the ROM still allows the bogeyman to dance

1800
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:18,800
with the music from the bogeyman boogie mode,

1801
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,600
but they removed it late in production because the arms were,

1802
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:26,160
they thought they were going to break off

1803
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:29,920
because there's an opening between the slingshot plastics

1804
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:33,040
that's actually still present that you can

1805
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:36,800
go in and there's even something about it in the game's manual.

1806
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,560
So since the code is still there,

1807
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:42,720
people have added the bogeyman modifications back to their games.

1808
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:44,880
You can buy them

1809
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:50,120
at freeplayamusements.com, it looks like.

1810
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:53,560
Or you can look for them at Robertwinter.com.

1811
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:58,040
I think it's supposed to be re-release, he's re-releasing them.

1812
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:00,880
But at any rate, going now to the specifics

1813
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:06,400
from IPMD, the Internet Involved Machine Database,

1814
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,360
it

1815
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:13,640
actually is a really amazing machine.

1816
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:17,720
You can look at all the specifications on it there, the back glasses screen.

1817
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:22,920
I think what I linked was a pinball arcade or something like that.

1818
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:25,120
But the game's really, really super fun.

1819
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:30,360
And, you know, it's got a great theme because Elvira is just absolutely hilarious.

1820
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:36,080
She is a queen, she is a drag queen, and she did it perfectly before

1821
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:40,600
a lot of our modern queens owe their stuff to Elvira, I'm just saying.

1822
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:44,440
But at any rate, it's really amazing.

1823
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:49,040
If you never have played it, you need to find it.

1824
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:53,560
And there's another note that there's a skull pile in the upper right corner

1825
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:58,800
of the play field that do not have light up eyes in the production games.

1826
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:03,360
So if you see any games that have LEDs in the skull, this is after Factory,

1827
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:05,600
as were, of course, the bogeyman characters.

1828
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:07,640
So there you go.

1829
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:14,840
The classic game of September 1996 is Scared Stiff by Bally Midway.

1830
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:18,520
And one of my very favorite tables as well, because I love Elvira.

1831
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:22,040
How can you not? Decontaminate yourself from play.

1832
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:23,480
I know, right?

1833
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:27,240
So I've been stuck in this house since March.

1834
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:28,440
Haven't been able to do anything.

1835
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:32,440
If you haven't been around other people for two weeks and you're not sick.

1836
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:34,440
There's that whole thing that happened with my dad.

1837
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:37,560
So technically, I'm not at two weeks out, you know, so.

1838
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:39,720
But at any rate, see, listen to us.

1839
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:42,480
We're being responsible.

1840
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:45,480
We quarantine before we make any plans.

1841
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:47,960
And it's all masks all the time.

1842
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:52,720
So speaking of which, I'm putting my mask back on.

1843
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:55,080
Oh, yes. I can go back on camera.

1844
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:59,480
Because you're about to bid us adieu tonight, right?

1845
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:02,280
All right.

1846
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:04,120
I forgot the song.

1847
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:05,640
Crap. Oh, well.

1848
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:09,560
And you don't forget, your mic gets really quiet when you have that mask on.

1849
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:11,240
I know. Here, I'll put it under.

1850
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,440
Oh, it's in my mouth now.

1851
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:21,360
All right. I'm filling this with rosemary and rose petals.

1852
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:25,360
So it's Rose Rosemary or maybe Rosemary Rose.

1853
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:31,280
I am coming to stick the cocaine in you and use my leeches to get rid of the nasty

1854
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:33,560
humors that are causing your illness.

1855
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,280
Oh,

1856
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,280
beautiful. Thank you so much.

1857
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:41,280
So my Oscar pitch,

1858
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:42,880
it's in the mail.

1859
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:47,480
Anyway, I know you have to bid us adieu, but take care.

1860
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:48,320
Thank you for being here.

1861
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:51,280
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1862
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:53,240
They'll be stupid.

1863
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:54,680
Good advice. Thank you.

1864
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:56,960
I'll take that to heart. Wear your mask.

1865
01:37:57,160 --> 01:37:58,920
Wash your hands.

1866
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:02,560
If you've been around people for any reason, take two weeks to decontaminate.

1867
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:03,800
Make sure you're not sick.

1868
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,880
Oh, and good news, my mom does not have the COVID.

1869
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:10,320
I totally forgot to ask you that question on air, but I know you told me that off

1870
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:11,560
air, but yeah, great.

1871
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:12,680
Thank you for confirming.

1872
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,160
Does not have the COVID.

1873
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:16,280
So that's good news.

1874
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:17,720
Hope she feels better nonetheless,

1875
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:20,600
because obviously whatever she has is pretty shitty like a flu or something.

1876
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:24,360
But I sent her I sent her vitamins and feel good stuff.

1877
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:25,920
So I'll check on her.

1878
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:30,200
But everybody be smart, take care of yourself.

1879
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:32,680
Be healthy, be safe and be intelligent.

1880
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:36,360
All right. Because if you're not, I'll make fun of you and then stay, you know,

1881
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:38,520
miles away from you. All right.

1882
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:40,400
With love. Sounds good.

1883
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:42,200
Take care, Jamie.

1884
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:43,600
Bye. Bye.

1885
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:47,080
All right. We're going to move on with rapid fire news.

1886
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:48,560
Logie.

1887
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:52,520
You want to unmute yourself, Logie?

1888
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:54,400
It would be easier to hear you. I want to do that.

1889
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:56,160
Yes. Yes, very good.

1890
01:38:56,360 --> 01:39:00,760
So apparently there's been a lot of people upset with the fact

1891
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:04,440
that Rockstar Games hasn't updated Red Dead Online in a while.

1892
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:08,320
So they haven't had a major update in over seven months,

1893
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:11,880
with the last one being in December of last year.

1894
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:19,000
And so to kind of protest that the users online have been dressing like clowns.

1895
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:24,320
So they're bringing in the clowns to protest the fact that

1896
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:26,120
this isn't a joke to them.

1897
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:31,760
I think that's funny because the whole clown clownery is kind of like a meme online.

1898
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:34,640
And so there's all sorts of, like, clown memes out there.

1899
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:37,080
You know, when you do clownery, the clown come back to bite,

1900
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:38,280
you know, those sorts of things.

1901
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:41,000
So I love that they're actually, like, dressing.

1902
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:43,640
Like, how big of a clown can you be in Red Dead?

1903
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:46,840
Like, can you full on, like, red nose Hong Kong?

1904
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:51,360
You can do some pretty decent clown makeup in there, at least.

1905
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:55,880
Yeah, it looks period accurate clowning.

1906
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:58,000
All right. Pure clownery.

1907
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:01,560
So that's what they're doing to protest that.

1908
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:03,120
Which, yeah, I mean, I get it.

1909
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:04,560
Maybe they just don't make this.

1910
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:07,800
Rockstar is probably not bringing as much money with Red Dead Online,

1911
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:12,240
but they've never really kind of given it the same attention as Grand Theft Auto 5

1912
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:13,760
or Grand Theft Auto Online.

1913
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:15,280
So,

1914
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:18,960
yeah, you get what you put into it, I guess.

1915
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:20,680
Yeah, for sure.

1916
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:26,800
And then more movie news coming out and just as crazy as some of these other movie

1917
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:29,600
ideas that they've had with, like, the Saints Row movie and stuff.

1918
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:32,440
This was another one that I would definitely want to see.

1919
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,720
Just Cause.

1920
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:38,080
So Just Cause has finally secured a director,

1921
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:42,920
Mike Douse, who I guess he had shot, let's see,

1922
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:48,320
a metal mockumentary FUBAR, the F word, some episodes for that.

1923
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:53,720
And, of course, the show that's on, I think, Hulu right now, Future Man.

1924
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:55,400
And then they have Preacher.

1925
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,680
So I don't see necessarily a lot of movie stuff there.

1926
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:03,080
But yeah, if they can keep it as crazy

1927
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:09,000
as the game, then I'm all in because that game is absolutely nuts.

1928
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:12,640
Sounds like something up your alley.

1929
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:14,600
Oh, yeah. All right.

1930
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:15,720
Crazy.

1931
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:18,000
Moving on, some other rapid fire news.

1932
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:22,560
For those of you guys that don't like to download your games or buy them online

1933
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:26,680
and you prefer to install them the old fashioned way and talking about PC games,

1934
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:30,520
you have quite the option for Microsoft Flight Simulator.

1935
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:33,640
You can actually buy a version of Microsoft Flight Simulator,

1936
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:40,280
which is a 90 gigabyte game that will actually come on ten different DVDs.

1937
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,640
That's right. Ten different DVDs.

1938
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:44,120
Because apparently, and Jason was kind

1939
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:46,480
of hinting at this in the intro a little bit for tonight's show.

1940
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:50,200
Apparently, a lot of computers don't actually have Blu-ray players in them.

1941
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:52,160
DVDs a little more standard, not to say.

1942
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:54,760
I mean, I'm sure many of you in chat are like mine as a Blu-ray player.

1943
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:55,960
Yeah, some of them do.

1944
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:59,120
But because Blu-ray didn't really catch on as like a standard for digital medium,

1945
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:01,800
I think a lot more computers kind of have DVD built in.

1946
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,000
And Flight Simulator is one of those games.

1947
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:07,800
I mean, it's truly for people of all ages.

1948
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,680
But there is like an older audience,

1949
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:15,960
especially retired pilots and older folks

1950
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:19,120
that maybe don't actually get to get out and fly like a regular plane.

1951
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:24,400
I would say that Microsoft Flight Simulator is actually has a good sales

1952
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:30,280
block from this group of probably older folks who don't do the steam

1953
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:32,880
and the online stuff, who have to do something a little more.

1954
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,920
And I'm using my quote fingers old fashioned.

1955
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:39,000
And so installing from the DVDs might be the way to do it.

1956
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,120
So it actually, you know, as much we're kind of like laughing at it,

1957
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:44,320
because like 10 DVDs to play one game, that's crazy.

1958
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:46,160
Although, you know, back in the day,

1959
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:49,000
I remember when it was those three and a half inch floppies.

1960
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:54,640
And I think it was like King's Quest five or six was on like 14 disks to install.

1961
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:57,960
Well, I mean, a gigantic game that would take a long time.

1962
01:42:58,160 --> 01:43:01,600
But hey, I mean, if you're strapped for bandwidth, you know,

1963
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:06,560
and that's 90 gigs that you don't have to download or you you live in a place

1964
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:10,480
like Alaska or something that doesn't have, you know, well, obviously,

1965
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:12,080
if you live in like Juneau or one of the big cities.

1966
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:15,800
But, you know, again, if you're a retired pilot, chances are you probably live

1967
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:18,080
somewhere pretty remote on your nice little ranch somewhere.

1968
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:21,120
And you may not have that kind of Internet, you know.

1969
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:24,080
Yeah, yeah. So I think I think it's really interesting.

1970
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:27,240
So they say the simulator is 100 percent the same.

1971
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:29,280
The box retail version just has a nice

1972
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:32,600
box and about 90 gigs that you don't have to download.

1973
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:34,640
There's no difference between box retail

1974
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:37,120
and the version that Microsoft sells directly.

1975
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:39,000
It's kind of kind of interesting.

1976
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:43,040
But yeah, I think this is really to address like an older audience that wouldn't

1977
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:46,360
necessarily buy a lot of other games, so to speak.

1978
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:49,040
And SGA 100 Matt says, Where is Legend of Zaku?

1979
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:52,360
He's the flight simulator buff, but also an excellent example of the fact

1980
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:57,240
that when I say like the older audience is an audience, it's clearly not the only

1981
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,360
audience, Zaku is not over the age of 65.

1982
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:02,960
In fact, he's quite younger than I am and enjoys flight simulators.

1983
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:06,920
There's people that enjoy flight sims of all ages, of course.

1984
01:44:07,120 --> 01:44:10,880
And so there's many people that will just do the 90 gigabyte download, I'm sure.

1985
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:14,400
I just think it is kind of interesting that a game like this kind of has to still do

1986
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:20,680
an old fashioned, so to speak, route, probably for a certain chunk of its audience.

1987
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:24,880
So TigerClanChat says, Imagine how many floppies this game would take.

1988
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:28,120
Yeah, but counterpoint, as fun as that is

1989
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:31,960
to imagine how many computers actually have floppy drives anymore.

1990
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:34,840
I remember it was like an ingress thing or something.

1991
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:37,800
Something happened where like there was a three and a half inch floppy.

1992
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:40,280
Somebody found and I think it was an ingress thing.

1993
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:41,960
We had to get the contents of the disk.

1994
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:46,160
Nobody on the team had a fucking three and a half inch floppy drive.

1995
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:48,240
Nobody had a drive to do it.

1996
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:52,680
Like, so now to find a working floppy drive is actually a challenge.

1997
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:56,240
And again, I'm sure there's somebody in chat that's going to go, I've got one.

1998
01:44:56,440 --> 01:45:00,560
It works. OK, but you do realize you're one of only a few.

1999
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,920
And they have USB.

2000
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:09,840
Like, it's very easy to find, like a USB, $20, like floppy drive type of thing

2001
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:14,440
so that people can get old pictures and old media and things like that.

2002
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:16,240
There's certainly plenty of uses for it.

2003
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:19,720
But I think we all know that isn't common.

2004
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:25,160
DVD drives are common now in computers and have been for over 10 years,

2005
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:28,880
probably more like 15 years, probably even longer than that shit.

2006
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:31,960
Probably closer to 20 years in computers.

2007
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:34,680
So, yeah.

2008
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:38,840
Anyway, looking in chat, Tigerclass says, I bet you can find on eBay.

2009
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:42,160
Of course, S2100Matt says, yeah, Newegg has a bunch.

2010
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:43,040
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

2011
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:45,320
Again, I'm not saying these things don't exist.

2012
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:48,920
I'm just saying they're not common in computers anymore.

2013
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:50,720
And that was the idea behind this was

2014
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:54,760
how do we what is common in computers if somebody doesn't have the right Internet?

2015
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:59,000
Now, PodCulture in chat says, wonder why they couldn't go USB.

2016
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:01,120
Even old computers have that.

2017
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:03,120
That's actually a good question.

2018
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:07,480
It's probably cheaper to actually do the 10 DVDs.

2019
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:13,800
It's cheaper to press this than it is to purchase a USB and have that available.

2020
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,240
Some of those USB sticks, though, are pretty.

2021
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:20,200
But maybe a 32 and a 64 would still be pretty cheap.

2022
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:22,880
Once you start to go past that, it probably gets a little more pricey.

2023
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:24,160
And it probably isn't, you know.

2024
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:26,400
But for a collector's edition or

2025
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:29,200
something, I don't think PodCulture's idea is necessarily bad.

2026
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:30,840
No, it's not a terrible idea.

2027
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:34,280
I don't think they want to spend that money,

2028
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:40,000
whereas it costs since to press a disk, so I don't know.

2029
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:41,360
And even on top of that,

2030
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:44,440
even after you've installed everything off that disk, you still have to download

2031
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:49,640
updates that are significantly large.

2032
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:51,560
Now, DJ Rama S. brings up a good point

2033
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:53,280
saying, interesting that you discussed this.

2034
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:56,680
I'm looking to buy a new computer case to rebuild my PC into.

2035
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:01,760
And 90 percent of cases out there don't support spaces for DVD or Blu-ray drives.

2036
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:03,880
Well, now it's the opposite problem.

2037
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:05,200
Why should they?

2038
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:08,920
What what what even comes out on DVD and Blu-ray anymore?

2039
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:11,960
Microsoft Flight Simulator.

2040
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:14,640
Well, you can always just get a USB drive.

2041
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:17,680
I mean, that's what you're and

2042
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:21,080
there's a great application of PodCulture's idea.

2043
01:47:21,080 --> 01:47:23,440
It's a USB drive now.

2044
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:26,480
No, I mean like a USB DVD drive.

2045
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:28,000
Oh, yeah, no pleasure.

2046
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:33,160
My first my first CD burner was an external that was through USB.

2047
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:33,880
You remember that?

2048
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:37,360
Because I think it was on the O.L.R. computer, the one in the garage for a while.

2049
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:44,600
My first CD was it my first CD drive was a SCSI and an external SCSI card.

2050
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:46,520
Now, so that was fun.

2051
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:48,760
I remember my old work,

2052
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:51,800
who remembers these?

2053
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:58,080
I used to have the zip drive at work, which was those gigantic fucking disks.

2054
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:00,840
Was it 100 megs that they held or 100 gigs?

2055
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:02,880
It was 100 megs.

2056
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:05,040
And so, yes.

2057
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:10,600
So previously I used to have a pretty decent Internet.

2058
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:12,320
This is back when I was on like dial up.

2059
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:15,400
So I had decent Internet, like.

2060
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:23,440
At work, so I used to put on zip disk.

2061
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:24,600
Not everybody knows this,

2062
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:27,560
but I used to do light publishing work like way back in the day.

2063
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:31,360
And so some of the layouts, they were too big for a normal disk.

2064
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:33,240
And this zip drive was like maybe like

2065
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:36,280
two years before, like CD burners were commonplace.

2066
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:39,640
So we actually had the zip drive thing and I used to used to save it to a zip

2067
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:42,760
drive and FedEx it to the main office to be in the magazine.

2068
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:44,160
That's how we would send the files back

2069
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:48,640
and forth, because you couldn't like 100 make you couldn't send a print layout.

2070
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:53,280
It was way too big of a file, but like the drive was like the perfect media for it.

2071
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:57,680
And then before zip drives, it used to be zipping it up and disk

2072
01:48:57,880 --> 01:49:02,800
spanning, which, oh, God, and I would do that with like 50 days.

2073
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:03,880
Oh, yeah. With shareware.

2074
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:05,200
Yeah. Hell yeah.

2075
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:09,560
Not necessarily shareware with step files.

2076
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:10,880
Oh, God.

2077
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:12,880
All right.

2078
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:14,640
I love that.

2079
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:17,360
We got to move on. We still got more show to cover here.

2080
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:19,640
And let's talk about EA.

2081
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:25,680
EA is going to remove the Washington football team's name in Madden 21.

2082
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:28,560
I'm sure you guys all heard the Washington team.

2083
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:30,400
This is how much I follow sports.

2084
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:32,360
Everybody, you ready? You all ready to make fun of me?

2085
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:37,120
SSG one hundred. Matt, you got your popcorn ready up until this week.

2086
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:38,840
I always thought when they were talking

2087
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:43,040
about the Washington football team, it was Washington State.

2088
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:46,920
I thought they were in like Spokane or something.

2089
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:52,280
I did not realize until this week that that team was a Washington DC team.

2090
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:54,720
That's how much I follow football.

2091
01:49:54,920 --> 01:49:58,200
I'm so embarrassed, but also not like come on.

2092
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:02,160
But yeah, so that team, as you know, is changing their name.

2093
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:04,480
We don't know what the new name is going to be yet.

2094
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:06,720
But Madden 21 has already responded.

2095
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:09,280
EA saying they're going to make some changes there.

2096
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:12,000
So they will have that fixed in Madden 21.

2097
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,480
I imagine that's going to be in a patch

2098
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:16,560
maybe because Madden 21 comes out on August 25th.

2099
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:18,920
So it's very likely it's already gone gold.

2100
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:19,880
I don't know.

2101
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:24,640
But there will be a generic Washington name and logo first and then they will

2102
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:26,920
patch in whatever is decided later on.

2103
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:32,120
So I think it's just going to be Washington with no name and like a W on

2104
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:36,280
the hat or something, and then they will patch in whatever they actually decide to

2105
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:39,720
do when that's all figured out. So there you go.

2106
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:41,800
And I got to look at chat and see if there's any comments.

2107
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,640
SGA 100 Matt says, actually, that's not that bad.

2108
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:47,960
Oh, thank you. You all are so nice.

2109
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:50,280
SGA 100 Matt says, although the last

2110
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:54,120
Magfest you were at, Rob, that football team took up part of the hotel.

2111
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:57,520
I didn't even realize.

2112
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:59,200
You say that it makes sense.

2113
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:01,040
But anyway,

2114
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:06,520
Bobby Black Wolf says the Onion had a great article about how they were finally

2115
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:11,080
changing the offensive part of their name and changing their name to the DC.

2116
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:13,880
Old name. This is funny.

2117
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:15,240
All right.

2118
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:19,040
Moving on, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

2119
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:20,680
I need to step away real quick.

2120
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:23,240
Loki, I'm going to do Japanese releases first, if you don't mind.

2121
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:25,120
So that gives you a nice little buffer time there.

2122
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:28,720
All right. So let me do the Japanese releases real quick here.

2123
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:30,960
So coming out in Japan this week,

2124
01:51:31,160 --> 01:51:34,840
first off on the Nintendo Switch coming out,

2125
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:38,720
I think Call of Cthulhu is the only game this week on the Nintendo Switch.

2126
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:40,400
That is coming out on the twenty third.

2127
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:45,880
And then on the PlayStation four this week over in Japan,

2128
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:49,720
Sengoku Basara for Sumer Gari.

2129
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:52,000
And that's a anniversary edition.

2130
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,960
So that is a price reduction of a game from Capcom.

2131
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:59,120
I'm trying to see if this is one that I recognized.

2132
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:02,760
Sengoku Basara is this.

2133
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:07,320
This is Dynasty Warriors, no, because they don't count as make that game.

2134
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:12,240
It's it's like Dynasty Warriors, it's Capcom's version of that.

2135
01:52:12,240 --> 01:52:14,320
Yeah, I can't remember the name of it here.

2136
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:18,800
I'm sure somebody in chat will type in all the things for Sara here.

2137
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,200
They call it that here.

2138
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:23,720
They gave it a different name on the like it was on the Wii or

2139
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:27,200
something or maybe it was around the time that we was around.

2140
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:30,440
They call it something different, but I don't remember what it was.

2141
01:52:30,640 --> 01:52:33,880
But I think they still call it Sengoku Basara.

2142
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:35,200
Gotcha. All right.

2143
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:38,040
I will be right back, Loki.

2144
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:40,360
OK, let's see.

2145
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:44,400
So in the U.S., we've got a few things coming out this week.

2146
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:47,840
So Rock of Ages three, make and break on PC,

2147
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:53,600
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, Xbox one and Stadia carry on,

2148
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:55,440
which is from Devolver Digital.

2149
01:52:55,640 --> 01:52:59,160
That's going to be on PC, Nintendo Switch and Xbox one.

2150
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:02,920
Crisis remastered on Nintendo Switch,

2151
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:08,000
Tannenberg on PlayStation four and Xbox one.

2152
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:12,440
And last but not least this week,

2153
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:15,440
actually, that would be last and not least.

2154
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:17,480
So Tannenberg it is.

2155
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:21,120
And then we've got for the UK,

2156
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:25,680
New Super Lucky's Tale on PlayStation four

2157
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:31,760
and Human Fall Flat on PlayStation four, Nintendo Switch and Xbox one.

2158
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:34,880
And then finally,

2159
01:53:35,080 --> 01:53:37,280
that's it, I guess. Very limited.

2160
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:39,000
Lots of stuff coming out next week, though.

2161
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:44,040
I've got Destroy All Humans or the week after next Destroy All Humans with that remake.

2162
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:46,480
And it's been a while since I played that.

2163
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:50,760
They'll be coming out on consoles very soon.

2164
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:56,040
And until then, I guess we can talk about Minecraft since Rob's not here.

2165
01:53:56,240 --> 01:54:00,240
So as you see, like this video that's

2166
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:05,360
been playing in the very background here of my image, it's actually a survival server

2167
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:09,240
that we've been doing for about four months, I think, because we did have

2168
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:13,080
a world that started off with my kids, but we finished that very fast

2169
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:16,280
because they wanted to kind of cheat their way through everything and finally

2170
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:20,480
convinced them again to start from scratch and not cheat.

2171
01:54:20,640 --> 01:54:24,360
So we've been doing that for a while, finally finished

2172
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:28,160
taking on pretty much all the challenges of this.

2173
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:32,520
The last thing we have to do is actually the woodland mansion.

2174
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:36,960
But we did the sea or was it the ocean monuments?

2175
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:40,160
We did two of those yesterday.

2176
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:45,680
And so I'd actually physically take took down one whole monument.

2177
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:48,640
And I'm going to turn the other one into a guardian spawner.

2178
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:50,480
So that'd be fun. I'm back.

2179
01:54:50,680 --> 01:54:52,520
Thank you for buying time.

2180
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:54,040
No, that's good.

2181
01:54:54,240 --> 01:54:55,400
That's no, that's good. That's good.

2182
01:54:55,400 --> 01:54:57,320
I can hear on my monitor here, so that's good.

2183
01:54:57,320 --> 01:54:58,320
All right, awesome.

2184
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:00,240
We're going to go to the mailbag.

2185
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:04,560
So every week you guys send us emails, participate at orangelandradio.com

2186
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:07,120
and we read some of our favorites here on the show.

2187
01:55:07,120 --> 01:55:10,240
So we have a couple of emails here tonight and we're going to start tonight

2188
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:14,920
with an email from good old YYR, creator of such

2189
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:17,800
classic games available on Steam,

2190
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:22,240
such as multi super multitasking,

2191
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:24,320
such as names that escape me in the moment,

2192
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:28,160
Sharpshooter, Bungee Ferret tossing, although that's not on Steam right now.

2193
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:32,160
But it's, you know, check out his site, YYRgames.com.

2194
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:33,200
It goes over everything.

2195
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:36,520
Hello, LR. Towards the end of the July 5th show,

2196
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:40,280
you mentioned DDR A20 Plus, new level check feature.

2197
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:43,480
I find it to be one of the really interesting additions to this new version.

2198
01:55:43,480 --> 01:55:45,320
So I figured I'd explain how it works.

2199
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:49,240
This special stage will begin playing automatically if the first stage has

2200
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:54,360
failed and if at least one player has never passed a level seven or higher song

2201
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:57,240
or did not log in with the amusement pass.

2202
01:55:57,440 --> 01:55:59,920
The machine will proclaim, let's see your moves.

2203
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:03,200
And we'll begin playing one of A20 certified bangers.

2204
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:05,880
This beat is with a special chart.

2205
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:10,240
This full length chart starts off very easy, which is occasional simple steps,

2206
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:12,720
but ramps up in difficulty as you play,

2207
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:16,320
testing you with jumps, free zeros and some mix ups.

2208
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:18,840
If you miss 20 steps, you will fail out.

2209
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:21,640
But the other player can keep going if they're doing better.

2210
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:25,200
Just as with the tutorial, you can also choose to skip this stage entirely

2211
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:27,280
by pressing the green button on the machine.

2212
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:31,440
If you don't skip, then you'll get a results screen after the stage is played

2213
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:35,920
and it'll show a recommended level for each player between one and six

2214
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:39,520
or simply over six if you aced it.

2215
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:40,920
That's a pun.

2216
01:56:41,120 --> 01:56:43,760
It will also show some chart recommendations,

2217
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:47,080
but since it only picks from default songs added to A20,

2218
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:50,200
plus the pool it picks from is rather small.

2219
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:52,680
Finally, if at least one player logged

2220
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:55,400
in with their amusement pass and premium play was used,

2221
01:56:55,600 --> 01:56:59,640
the game will proceed to the second stage as usual because three songs are guaranteed.

2222
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:01,760
If not, the game ends there and you'll have

2223
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:04,040
to play again if you want to try the recommendations.

2224
01:57:04,240 --> 01:57:05,640
Still, I think it's nice that you get

2225
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:08,360
to play a bit longer if you bomb out of the first song.

2226
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:11,000
Yeah, it's one of those things where like now that you're explaining it,

2227
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,800
I'm like, damn, that would have been awesome in DDR back in the day.

2228
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:19,320
Like a song to measure like this is the level of song you should be trying right now.

2229
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:23,680
Why don't they should put that in like BeatMania 2DX and there are other games

2230
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:28,320
which I realize, man, I wish we had BeatMania 2DX at home.

2231
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:31,720
I so wish we had that, but I guess that's another story.

2232
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:32,760
All right.

2233
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:35,000
Anyway, I'm actually taking a peek at chat real quick.

2234
01:57:35,200 --> 01:57:37,440
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, oh, that sounds cool.

2235
01:57:37,480 --> 01:57:40,800
Hopefully, if we ever get out of this COVID thing and I can find a machine,

2236
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
I'll definitely play some A20 plus.

2237
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:43,800
Yeah, for sure.

2238
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:45,920
That's where I'm at, too, is it's like, all right.

2239
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:47,600
Any day when COVID is done.

2240
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:49,000
OK.

2241
01:57:49,880 --> 01:57:51,880
Moving on

2242
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:53,680
to the rest of that email.

2243
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:55,320
I didn't finish the email.

2244
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:59,800
It seems that this feature is intended for brand new players who have no idea what

2245
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:02,400
to pick and wind up choosing something too difficult.

2246
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:06,000
Unfortunately, this is also the sort of player who typically walks off after

2247
01:58:06,040 --> 01:58:07,800
the first song, whether they pass or not.

2248
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:08,920
Oh, well.

2249
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:11,360
Before I go, I want to mention an interesting

2250
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:13,680
bit of news that may or may not have made the show roll.

2251
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:17,760
It appears that as of today, it is no longer possible to purchase a 12 month

2252
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:21,120
Xbox Live Gold subscription digitally, which, of course, we did talk about at

2253
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:23,640
the beginning of the show, but let's get YYR's thoughts.

2254
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:27,360
The one month and three month options remain and their prices are unchanged,

2255
01:58:27,560 --> 01:58:31,160
but the 12 month options vanished entirely from the Xbox dashboard.

2256
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:35,720
Immediately, I thought of Rob's past speculation that Microsoft may choose

2257
01:58:35,720 --> 01:58:38,320
to make online player free in the future,

2258
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:43,160
or this may just be a heavy handed way to steer folks towards Game Pass Ultimate.

2259
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:46,680
But if they want to really make headlines on the Series X launches,

2260
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:50,040
dropping paid online multiplayer would be one way to do it.

2261
01:58:50,240 --> 01:58:51,280
What do you think?

2262
01:58:51,480 --> 01:58:55,520
Well, I think I made my thoughts on this at the beginning of the show known,

2263
01:58:55,720 --> 01:59:01,600
but I appreciate you because you've been a big Microsoft guy for a while now.

2264
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:04,200
I know in the early days and I didn't even own an Xbox one.

2265
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:09,320
You're kind of sometimes setting our path right on some assumptions we made about

2266
01:59:09,320 --> 01:59:10,920
the system that we weren't always right about.

2267
01:59:11,120 --> 01:59:16,440
So the fact that I know you're kind of coming to the same conclusion that my

2268
01:59:16,640 --> 01:59:20,880
crazy speculation did a few years ago is actually oddly comforting.

2269
01:59:21,080 --> 01:59:22,400
So we'll see what becomes of it.

2270
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:24,080
And that's what I think.

2271
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:28,040
Anyway, thanks again for putting the show together and have another great week.

2272
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:31,400
Wishing he could actually go play DDR without risking his life.

2273
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:34,480
Aaron Yyr. Same, same.

2274
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:38,840
And I really hope we get to the other side of this before too long.

2275
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:40,120
Anyway,

2276
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:43,680
there is some pretty exciting stuff, speaking of DDR,

2277
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:46,760
that I saw on Twitter this week.

2278
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:52,360
So there's been a lot of development in producing a DDR omni mix,

2279
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:57,560
which is basically hacking the old System 573 mixes

2280
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:00,200
to put whatever songs you want on there.

2281
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:05,480
And pretty exciting stuff I saw where they've mixed up the song list to add

2282
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:10,040
stuff that's been taken out of Extreme and removing other songs like Let Them Move.

2283
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:12,240
And

2284
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:17,440
yeah, very exciting to see where that goes, since I have a modded system to do that.

2285
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:21,760
Of course, I also have set mania, so it's kind of irrelevant, but still would be neat.

2286
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:22,680
That's still neat.

2287
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:24,840
I'd be curious to see where that goes. Cool.

2288
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:28,360
All right. We have one more email tonight from AJ Twist.

2289
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:32,480
I haven't heard this name in the email bag for a long time, so good to have you back.

2290
02:00:32,680 --> 02:00:35,320
AJ Twist emails us saying, Good evening, OLR.

2291
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:38,120
Long time listener. Third time writer.

2292
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:40,720
I know you've written us before, but all right.

2293
02:00:40,920 --> 02:00:44,440
I've had an itch for a new music rhythm game for a while now.

2294
02:00:44,440 --> 02:00:46,080
We've got a lot of music stories tonight.

2295
02:00:46,280 --> 02:00:47,480
I don't mind.

2296
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:53,760
A few months ago, I saw someone streaming Spin Rhythm XD and had to try it out.

2297
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:56,160
It almost plays like DJ Hero.

2298
02:00:56,360 --> 02:00:57,800
It was $15 on Steam.

2299
02:00:57,840 --> 02:00:59,640
I'm not sure if it's available anywhere else.

2300
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:02,880
It seems you can use almost anything for a controller.

2301
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:04,440
The button options are pretty wide.

2302
02:01:04,640 --> 02:01:07,160
You can play it with keyboard and mouse or a controller.

2303
02:01:07,360 --> 02:01:10,480
The craziest thing is the ability to use a midi turntable to play.

2304
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:11,360
Well, that's pretty cool.

2305
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:13,840
The game is not as polished as DJ Hero.

2306
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:17,000
It almost has this frequency amplitude look, in my opinion.

2307
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:18,960
It's a great game and has great music.

2308
02:01:19,160 --> 02:01:20,720
Ten out of ten recommend.

2309
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:23,560
Have any of you heard of it or played it? AJ Twist.

2310
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:26,200
I must admit, I'm going to open this.

2311
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:27,600
I have not, AJ Twist.

2312
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:30,040
I'm going to open it to chat to see if there's any further opinions.

2313
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:32,120
Spin Rhythm XD.

2314
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:33,200
Yeah, I've heard of it.

2315
02:01:33,200 --> 02:01:34,200
Oh, you have heard of it?

2316
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:35,320
It's on my wish list.

2317
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:38,120
I just haven't bothered to buy it because I know I'm not going to actually play any of it.

2318
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:40,680
But yeah, it looks pretty cool.

2319
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:45,920
I think it does work with the DJ Hero controllers, too, if you have that in there.

2320
02:01:46,120 --> 02:01:51,360
But yeah, pretty much any sort of like midi or just any sort of like

2321
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:55,240
turntable or dial or something that you use it because the way that works,

2322
02:01:55,240 --> 02:01:57,440
there's like an actual

2323
02:01:57,640 --> 02:02:01,440
a bar that basically you're just moving back and forth between the different

2324
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:06,120
lanes in there and you can, you know, spin everything around and stuff.

2325
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:07,160
It looks pretty cool.

2326
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:09,600
I just think that

2327
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:11,400
probably wouldn't play it.

2328
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:12,480
I'll have to check it out.

2329
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:13,520
I almost picked it up in the last sale.

2330
02:02:13,720 --> 02:02:15,800
I'm very curious about the music because

2331
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:18,600
I imagine a fifteen dollar game probably didn't license music.

2332
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:21,080
So it probably is more like twenty bucks right now.

2333
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:22,560
So, I mean, it's...

2334
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:24,760
Did they license music or is it original artists?

2335
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:27,000
Not that that's bad, but

2336
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:30,680
part of part of what made DJ Hero very

2337
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:36,120
appealing was that the mashup mixes were A plus like that.

2338
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:37,360
What was it was Mary J.

2339
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:42,240
Blige, All of Me and Queen's Radio Gaga is still like just like just like a song

2340
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:45,640
that I love, like that mashup is so stinking good in that game.

2341
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:48,720
There's a lot of like great mashups in that game.

2342
02:02:48,920 --> 02:02:51,240
But obviously that took some big record

2343
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:55,400
label maneuvering from a huge ass company like Activision to make happen.

2344
02:02:55,600 --> 02:03:00,080
So, again, I'm not I'm all about indie artists too and up and comers and so forth.

2345
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:03,800
So I'd be just curious to hear how the songs are.

2346
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:09,200
OK, so like some of the like artists I recognize on this list, which probably is

2347
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:11,440
not going to be very many, Tokyo Machine.

2348
02:03:11,640 --> 02:03:14,400
So they did a lot of stuff and they have Beat Saber.

2349
02:03:14,600 --> 02:03:17,040
And, of course, in

2350
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:18,840
Oh, God.

2351
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:23,480
How's that really popular game?

2352
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:25,560
I can't remember.

2353
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:28,800
Anyways, yeah, Beat Saber, I know they have some songs in there.

2354
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,200
Rocket League, that's what I'm saying.

2355
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:32,720
Sorry. And

2356
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:35,360
what else? So the other artists that they

2357
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:40,240
mentioned on here, Rogue, Nitro Fun, Hyper Potions, Tut Tut Child, Panda Eyes,

2358
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:44,440
Terminite, Pegboard Nerds, Tristem, Bracken.

2359
02:03:44,640 --> 02:03:45,880
I haven't heard of a lot of these.

2360
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:48,640
A Tokyo Machine is the only one I know and their songs are awesome.

2361
02:03:48,640 --> 02:03:51,080
So, OK, but it's like it's like other it's

2362
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:54,200
folks that have either they're indie completely and this is their first

2363
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:57,120
experience or like they were artists for other games.

2364
02:03:57,120 --> 02:03:58,840
That's pretty cool, though.

2365
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:02,520
Yeah, Rocket League has a sweet soundtrack, so that's cool.

2366
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:03,920
Some comments from chat.

2367
02:04:04,120 --> 02:04:07,800
Tiger Claw says, I have a real live version of DJ Hero and I mean, I have an actual

2368
02:04:07,800 --> 02:04:10,320
DJ controller. I play with it from time to time when I

2369
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:12,360
want to play around with my music to see how they mix.

2370
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:16,440
Well, speaking of music, mixing that harmonics game is on the horizon, too.

2371
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:18,000
I mean, that's not really a DJ Hero game.

2372
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:20,680
It's their card game adapted for consoles.

2373
02:04:20,680 --> 02:04:23,720
But I think people are going to have fun doing mashups with that.

2374
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:27,280
Anything with Carly Rae Jepsen songs is going to be a blast.

2375
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:29,000
Can you name anybody more perfect?

2376
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,080
I'll wait. OK, I'm done waiting.

2377
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:32,120
Moving on.

2378
02:04:32,320 --> 02:04:34,720
We also have Dark Tetsuya says, I've heard of it.

2379
02:04:34,760 --> 02:04:35,720
It seems cool.

2380
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:39,000
I just need to get a hold of my turntable controller.

2381
02:04:39,200 --> 02:04:40,880
And let's see.

2382
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:45,080
I thought there was another comment on that, but that's all I see in the moment.

2383
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:47,640
So, yeah, it sounds like a neat game to me.

2384
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:50,000
I'm probably going to check it out based on your email recommendations.

2385
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,280
So thank you for the email, AJ Twist.

2386
02:04:51,480 --> 02:04:54,680
Appreciate that. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

2387
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:57,600
if you want to send us an email for a future week.

2388
02:04:57,800 --> 02:05:01,880
In the meantime, let's move on to some other stories.

2389
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:03,160
Loki.

2390
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:07,440
Yes, so one of the other kind of digital

2391
02:05:07,640 --> 02:05:12,040
things that they did this week was with Google Stadium making more announcements

2392
02:05:12,080 --> 02:05:14,720
about their console.

2393
02:05:14,920 --> 02:05:17,400
So the Stadia Connect event,

2394
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:21,600
they did talk about some more games coming to the platform.

2395
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:28,560
So Forks Must Die 3, which was supposed to be free with Stadia Pro.

2396
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:34,640
They did announce that Super Bomberman R Online is coming.

2397
02:05:34,840 --> 02:05:39,520
So it's like a Bomberman battle royale game with 64 players.

2398
02:05:39,720 --> 02:05:41,280
And then

2399
02:05:41,480 --> 02:05:46,040
I want to say that they also had announced that there's a new harmonics game coming

2400
02:05:46,240 --> 02:05:48,320
to the platform, which is kind of interesting.

2401
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:53,520
And then also Uppercut Games, which did City of Brass.

2402
02:05:53,720 --> 02:05:58,080
And then Supermassive Games, who are behind Until Dawn.

2403
02:05:59,160 --> 02:06:03,320
I'm curious to see how the harmonics stuff works out, considering that it's going to

2404
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:06,480
really have to be low latency to do a music game.

2405
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:11,280
Yeah, that's a pretty gutsy thing to put on a system like Stadia.

2406
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:14,720
But having played a little bit of Stadia in those first couple of months,

2407
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:16,640
thanks to the buddy pass that Mr.

2408
02:06:16,840 --> 02:06:21,520
Blackwolf gave me, I was playing things like Destiny and Thumper.

2409
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:23,600
I remember playing, which is kind of a music game.

2410
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:25,000
It's not quite as intense.

2411
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:28,240
I want to say it's not quite as intense,

2412
02:06:28,240 --> 02:06:32,280
but actually it's probably more intense because it's like a music horror game.

2413
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:35,880
But you know what I mean? Like the accuracy isn't quite, it's a little different.

2414
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:37,360
You have a little room for error in that game.

2415
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:42,400
But my point is, both of those games played pretty darn well, all things considered.

2416
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:48,200
So it's almost like, and has Harmonix developed a non-music game?

2417
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:50,680
And I think they did an itoy game.

2418
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:53,240
I think they did the itoy skater game.

2419
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:57,920
But that was like 20 years ago, 15 years ago, a long time ago.

2420
02:06:58,120 --> 02:07:00,200
Yeah, I can't think of any.

2421
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:00,800
Yeah.

2422
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:02,600
So

2423
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:07,040
now they could be doing something a little more like the drop mix

2424
02:07:07,240 --> 02:07:09,320
fuser or whatever they're calling it on console.

2425
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:12,640
They could be doing something more like that that maybe doesn't have the strict timing.

2426
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:18,120
But it could be a very interesting flex for Stadia to have something that requires

2427
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:22,480
precise timing and it works well. And honestly,

2428
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:28,600
any comments I've had about Stadia really aren't about the technology.

2429
02:07:28,640 --> 02:07:30,840
The technology is good.

2430
02:07:31,040 --> 02:07:34,400
It's a good technology.

2431
02:07:34,600 --> 02:07:37,840
It's just going to be like, all I'm saying is like come Thursday,

2432
02:07:38,040 --> 02:07:44,840
if even if they weren't like Microsoft wasn't announcing free online or whatever,

2433
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:51,280
it's still a hard sell already when you've got their library,

2434
02:07:51,480 --> 02:07:54,440
hundreds of games that are part of Games Pass.

2435
02:07:54,480 --> 02:08:00,000
It's almost the same price as the Stadia cost.

2436
02:08:00,200 --> 02:08:05,040
Plus, I would trust Microsoft more with purchases than I would Google,

2437
02:08:05,240 --> 02:08:08,400
just because this platform is relatively new.

2438
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:16,000
Google has the tradition of shuttering a lot of these platforms early on if they

2439
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:19,360
feel that they're not being popular.

2440
02:08:19,560 --> 02:08:20,960
I just

2441
02:08:21,680 --> 02:08:23,520
am having a hard time.

2442
02:08:23,720 --> 02:08:27,440
I know these announcements, they want to make me believe that Google

2443
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:30,600
is going to invest in this for the long haul and so forth.

2444
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:32,920
And again, we still haven't even had

2445
02:08:33,120 --> 02:08:36,960
the rollout of Stadia in the browser boom for everyone.

2446
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:39,800
I think many of us suspected we would have that by now.

2447
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:44,400
I don't know if Covid is to blame or some type of underestimation of the project is

2448
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:46,240
to blame or a combination of those things.

2449
02:08:46,440 --> 02:08:48,720
Whatever point is, we don't have it yet.

2450
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:50,360
And I think many of us thought we would.

2451
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:52,920
This announcement about Harmonix and

2452
02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:58,160
the folks behind Until Dawn making games for Stadia, that is very exciting news.

2453
02:08:58,360 --> 02:09:02,720
This is news we should have had a year ago when they first unveiled things,

2454
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:06,280
whether they've been sitting on it or whether these deals were recently inked.

2455
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:08,200
I suppose we'll never know.

2456
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:12,600
But I feel like this news is going to get lost.

2457
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:14,400
This news is going to get really lost.

2458
02:09:14,400 --> 02:09:16,640
Like you said, Microsoft's got a big event this week.

2459
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:18,520
Sony's got PlayStation five.

2460
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:20,680
I feel like this news without any type of

2461
02:09:20,680 --> 02:09:24,640
footage or anything or something to really get us pumped up is going to get lost.

2462
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:26,520
And people are going to forget.

2463
02:09:26,720 --> 02:09:29,440
Some of the other games that they're talking about coming to the platform are

2464
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:31,960
obviously games that have been out for a little bit already.

2465
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:34,680
So we have PGA Tour 2K21.

2466
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:38,840
OK, I'm going to stop you right there, because let's be let's be real.

2467
02:09:39,040 --> 02:09:41,040
Let's be completely real.

2468
02:09:41,360 --> 02:09:42,200
This doesn't matter.

2469
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:47,880
Like old games and we're releasing shit that already came out a year or two ago.

2470
02:09:48,040 --> 02:09:49,240
It's not going to matter.

2471
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:51,280
Like, is anybody is anybody going to be

2472
02:09:51,480 --> 02:09:54,760
buying stuff on Stadia that they've already bought two years ago?

2473
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:58,640
No, no. And so sorry, I don't mean to disrespect you,

2474
02:09:58,640 --> 02:10:01,840
Loki, or the news you're trying to read, but I think the reality is that this news

2475
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:07,000
doesn't matter and this is this is the problem that we you had right out the gate.

2476
02:10:07,200 --> 02:10:08,560
What are our launch titles?

2477
02:10:08,760 --> 02:10:11,200
A bunch of shit from two years ago.

2478
02:10:12,280 --> 02:10:15,600
So right, and I just don't know how they make themselves relevant.

2479
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:18,440
I thought that with, you know,

2480
02:10:18,640 --> 02:10:22,960
having it's really like I said, back when I was talking about choosing consoles,

2481
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:26,480
you know, it's really the exclusives that are going to bring it to the platform.

2482
02:10:26,680 --> 02:10:30,000
And then having the vast library will kind of keep you there as well.

2483
02:10:30,200 --> 02:10:33,960
I just don't see the exclusives for Stadia.

2484
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:35,640
It just seems like a fad.

2485
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:40,480
And honestly, by the time they get it right, it's going to be too late, I think.

2486
02:10:40,680 --> 02:10:44,240
Yeah, I'm I'm really worried about Stadia from that perspective, too.

2487
02:10:44,280 --> 02:10:48,520
Like we we should already have the Stadia for everybody.

2488
02:10:48,720 --> 02:10:53,320
I don't I mean, I don't understand why we're still waiting on that

2489
02:10:53,520 --> 02:10:57,920
because technically they're kind of giving out pro for free because like you can get

2490
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:00,000
that trial or whatever and you can play it in your browser.

2491
02:11:00,200 --> 02:11:03,640
Like they need to stop making it like, oh, you're signing up for a pro.

2492
02:11:03,640 --> 02:11:05,200
They need to make it like you just you're

2493
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:07,760
logging into your Google account and it has Stadia on it.

2494
02:11:07,960 --> 02:11:12,160
Like it's like it's drive like Google Drive or Google Docs or whatever.

2495
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:16,720
Like it's just Stadia is one of those things you can just go like they need to,

2496
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:18,760
you know, and I realize, oh, it could be a bandwidth thing.

2497
02:11:18,760 --> 02:11:22,960
It could be like we're past the time where it should have already been something

2498
02:11:23,160 --> 02:11:27,000
that everybody can just easily access every day that we don't have.

2499
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,400
That Stadia is going to fall further and further behind.

2500
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:30,560
That's the reality.

2501
02:11:30,760 --> 02:11:32,480
And these game announcements,

2502
02:11:32,680 --> 02:11:36,560
especially the stuff that's years old that people have already bought or got for free.

2503
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:37,880
How many of the games that they've

2504
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:42,160
announced on Stadia has Epic Games Store already given away for free?

2505
02:11:42,360 --> 02:11:43,520
Quite a few.

2506
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:47,000
Like the two of the games that they had on there were hit me at one at two.

2507
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:48,400
I guarantee I have those.

2508
02:11:48,600 --> 02:11:51,800
I'm pretty sure I've got those on multiple platforms already.

2509
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:57,400
Yeah. And the Tomb Raider series, I'm almost positive, was free on Square.

2510
02:11:57,600 --> 02:11:59,880
Square Enix gave it away, I think, at the beginning of the covid stuff.

2511
02:12:00,080 --> 02:12:03,280
So my point is, yeah, and that's that's why I cut off you

2512
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:05,920
reading the list is because these announcements don't matter.

2513
02:12:06,120 --> 02:12:07,280
They don't mean anything.

2514
02:12:07,480 --> 02:12:11,120
Most people already have played these games or they're already in their library.

2515
02:12:11,320 --> 02:12:12,400
And this is scraps.

2516
02:12:12,600 --> 02:12:15,640
And Stadia is not going to survive off scraps.

2517
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:17,840
And it's a bummer because, again,

2518
02:12:18,040 --> 02:12:21,280
any complaint I've ever had about Stadia isn't the technology.

2519
02:12:21,480 --> 02:12:25,680
If you actually go through the hoops to check it out and play Destiny 2,

2520
02:12:25,880 --> 02:12:29,400
it kind of works and it's pretty cool.

2521
02:12:29,600 --> 02:12:36,440
But how long is that going to sustain the idea of give Stadia money?

2522
02:12:36,600 --> 02:12:38,720
I don't know. Not at all for me.

2523
02:12:38,920 --> 02:12:40,040
Yeah, same here.

2524
02:12:40,240 --> 02:12:42,160
Running out of time. All right.

2525
02:12:42,160 --> 02:12:45,960
Well, one game that's managed to keep going for years and years and years is

2526
02:12:45,960 --> 02:12:48,880
Minecraft, right, Loki? Minecraft had the right idea, right?

2527
02:12:49,080 --> 02:12:52,240
So now I get Loki.

2528
02:12:52,240 --> 02:12:54,760
You might have to give me some background on this because I'm not totally

2529
02:12:54,760 --> 02:12:58,720
understanding like why this is like huge news, but it is circulating around game

2530
02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:04,000
blogs and stuff, and that is that the Minecraft title screen

2531
02:13:04,200 --> 02:13:06,400
apparently shows a world in the background.

2532
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:07,120
We all knew that.

2533
02:13:07,320 --> 02:13:10,640
I always thought it was just a random fucking world each and every time.

2534
02:13:10,640 --> 02:13:11,320
But apparently not.

2535
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:13,640
It's the same world every time.

2536
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:15,960
And they have just discovered this week.

2537
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:21,720
If you want to play in the title screen world, here is the seed.

2538
02:13:21,720 --> 02:13:23,160
And there's actually two seeds.

2539
02:13:23,360 --> 02:13:24,440
So spoiler alert.

2540
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:27,720
See, I would have thought the seed would have been something like

2541
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:33,160
Microsoft rules or something like somebody's cat name or something like that.

2542
02:13:33,320 --> 02:13:38,800
No, no, the seed is two one five one nine zero one five five three nine six eight

2543
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:41,720
three five two seven four all of the seeds are converted to numeric.

2544
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:45,600
So whether you type in Microsoft rules or whatever like that, you know,

2545
02:13:45,800 --> 02:13:48,640
it would still be it converts it down to that.

2546
02:13:48,840 --> 02:13:50,240
OK, that I would have known.

2547
02:13:50,240 --> 02:13:51,160
So thank you.

2548
02:13:51,360 --> 02:13:53,600
What they were doing is like

2549
02:13:53,800 --> 02:13:58,080
once again, it's a lot of time being wasted on this stuff there.

2550
02:13:58,080 --> 02:14:01,680
They had algorithms and stuff that they were trying to figure out what the seed

2551
02:14:01,680 --> 02:14:07,760
was to find the world and based on the generation that was there,

2552
02:14:07,960 --> 02:14:13,040
chunk generation and where the different objects were in there.

2553
02:14:13,240 --> 02:14:16,320
And so they were basing that trying to figure out, you know,

2554
02:14:16,520 --> 02:14:20,240
how to find the actual seed that is shown in those screenshots.

2555
02:14:20,440 --> 02:14:25,000
They did something similar not too long ago with PewDiePie with his seed

2556
02:14:25,200 --> 02:14:28,840
that he was playing in his world because they wanted to play the same one.

2557
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:30,280
I don't know. It's time.

2558
02:14:30,440 --> 02:14:32,000
People got a lot of time nowadays.

2559
02:14:32,200 --> 02:14:34,520
And so just now you can check it out.

2560
02:14:34,720 --> 02:14:37,320
Just think you could have found a cure for covid.

2561
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:41,000
But no, you found the Minecraft title screen seed.

2562
02:14:41,200 --> 02:14:42,280
No, I should look.

2563
02:14:42,480 --> 02:14:45,160
I've spent 18 years of my life doing a podcast.

2564
02:14:45,160 --> 02:14:46,120
I have no room to judge.

2565
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:48,040
Yeah, it is the blurry image.

2566
02:14:48,240 --> 02:14:53,240
And then they found the exact spot in the exact world to actually check it out.

2567
02:14:53,240 --> 02:14:54,640
I mean, it's kind of cool that they are

2568
02:14:54,840 --> 02:14:59,200
able to find that amongst the billions of levels or worlds that could be generated.

2569
02:14:59,360 --> 02:15:01,520
Yeah. And, you know, the versions

2570
02:15:01,720 --> 02:15:06,120
now have to change the screenshot and then figure it out all over again.

2571
02:15:06,320 --> 02:15:11,000
All jokes aside, like the science behind it and how they discovered it is pretty

2572
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:14,680
cool, you know, we have to rip it a little bit because it's like all that time you

2573
02:15:14,680 --> 02:15:16,560
spent doing X, you could have been doing Y.

2574
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:19,360
But the fact that they did use these kind

2575
02:15:19,360 --> 02:15:23,200
of unconventional techniques to figure it out and it's like this is this is this is

2576
02:15:23,400 --> 02:15:27,320
what we want and we're going to find it, they found it good for them.

2577
02:15:27,480 --> 02:15:29,680
Now, go cure Covid.

2578
02:15:31,760 --> 02:15:32,960
All right.

2579
02:15:33,160 --> 02:15:36,680
Anyhow, moving on, Loki, what do you have for us?

2580
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:38,040
So this is kind of fun.

2581
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:43,200
So there is a a little indie game that someone made

2582
02:15:43,400 --> 02:15:48,040
that's kind of like WarioWare, but with like a horror trope twist to it.

2583
02:15:48,240 --> 02:15:54,200
So this game Spookware by Adam Pipe is a it's 10 micro games.

2584
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:56,120
They're all themed around horror stuff.

2585
02:15:56,120 --> 02:16:00,400
So it's different things like, you know, moving

2586
02:16:00,600 --> 02:16:05,760
with the reader across the Ouija board, you know, sawing a leg in half,

2587
02:16:05,960 --> 02:16:10,280
finding the missing letters and like a Slenderman type of thing.

2588
02:16:10,480 --> 02:16:15,240
And you use the arrow keys on your keyboard to play the game.

2589
02:16:15,440 --> 02:16:18,520
And it's very authentic to WarioWare.

2590
02:16:18,520 --> 02:16:19,320
It's pretty awesome.

2591
02:16:19,320 --> 02:16:21,480
So what's great, though, is you can check it out.

2592
02:16:21,680 --> 02:16:23,880
It is free.

2593
02:16:24,080 --> 02:16:30,040
It's taken him 24 months or I'm sorry, it's game a month.

2594
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:31,040
So he created in a month.

2595
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:33,000
He's done this for 24 months straight, though.

2596
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:35,440
So it's his 24th one they put together.

2597
02:16:35,640 --> 02:16:39,440
If you want to check it out, it's papercookies.itch.io

2598
02:16:39,640 --> 02:16:43,160
slash Spookware and it looks pretty cool.

2599
02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:44,040
You got to play it.

2600
02:16:44,160 --> 02:16:45,120
Yeah, I want to check that out.

2601
02:16:45,320 --> 02:16:46,480
That was really cool.

2602
02:16:46,680 --> 02:16:52,280
I love WarioWare, which is why I enjoy super multitasking by YYR.

2603
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:53,560
But no, seriously, I do.

2604
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:55,360
I love the WarioWare games.

2605
02:16:55,560 --> 02:16:59,720
And so and that's always also one of those franchises where I'm like, God,

2606
02:16:59,720 --> 02:17:02,320
I wish Nintendo would bring this back because it's been a while since I've had

2607
02:17:02,320 --> 02:17:03,800
one of those games, been a long while.

2608
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:08,080
And I feel like the last game we got was just a rehash of one of the old games.

2609
02:17:08,280 --> 02:17:09,720
Yeah, it's cool.

2610
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:14,800
It's funny, though, is they've got like it's there's some cheesy stuff in there.

2611
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:19,480
It's very much got the same like feeling of WarioWare game.

2612
02:17:19,680 --> 02:17:21,360
Like, for example, the one where it's

2613
02:17:21,440 --> 02:17:25,600
kind of gross, where you're like sawing a leg in half that's on a chopping board

2614
02:17:25,800 --> 02:17:28,240
with a chainsaw, though, but you're sawing it like a knife.

2615
02:17:28,440 --> 02:17:29,800
It's all what's for dinner.

2616
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,560
And it's like dinner is served.

2617
02:17:32,760 --> 02:17:36,000
Or like they have what they have another one where it's like a dark room.

2618
02:17:36,200 --> 02:17:37,960
It's like, where's Nosferatu?

2619
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:41,400
You find his face and there he is.

2620
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:42,840
It's still like stuff like that.

2621
02:17:42,840 --> 02:17:46,200
It's kind of funny, as long as it's like silly and comical and like, you know,

2622
02:17:46,400 --> 02:17:49,400
and I've talked about this with horror a lot.

2623
02:17:49,560 --> 02:17:53,760
I don't I'm not into the very realistic looking horror stuff.

2624
02:17:53,960 --> 02:17:57,520
But when it's like Disney's Haunted Mansion or like Elvira,

2625
02:17:57,520 --> 02:18:00,720
like Darsaka went over earlier, like that macabre type of stuff,

2626
02:18:00,920 --> 02:18:03,280
that stuff I think is great and I eat it up.

2627
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:06,800
I think that stuff is the Addams Family, like one of the all times greatest.

2628
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:08,120
I think that shit is great.

2629
02:18:08,320 --> 02:18:09,760
Like that. That's awesome.

2630
02:18:09,760 --> 02:18:11,640
It's the stuff that's like too realistic.

2631
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:13,320
So it's like, where's Nosferatu?

2632
02:18:13,520 --> 02:18:15,000
And it's cartoony and stuff.

2633
02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:16,520
I think that would be funny.

2634
02:18:16,680 --> 02:18:20,280
Yeah, it's it's very much looks like a Warrior War game.

2635
02:18:20,280 --> 02:18:21,800
OK, that's that's cool.

2636
02:18:21,800 --> 02:18:22,960
I want to check it out. I will.

2637
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:24,520
That's that's cool. All right.

2638
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:26,400
Did you say it was free or is it a small?

2639
02:18:26,400 --> 02:18:28,120
It's free. Yeah. Oh, that's awesome.

2640
02:18:28,320 --> 02:18:29,720
That's even better.

2641
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:30,680
All right.

2642
02:18:30,880 --> 02:18:34,680
One more free upgrade for owners of this game.

2643
02:18:34,680 --> 02:18:37,240
And I feel like this is a game Loki probably owns.

2644
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:38,840
I did it one time.

2645
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:40,760
I don't know if I still do.

2646
02:18:40,960 --> 02:18:42,600
Let me check my Steam library.

2647
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:46,960
Worms Armageddon came out over 20 years ago.

2648
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:50,920
And of course, the Worms franchise kind of came from those old tank war games

2649
02:18:50,920 --> 02:18:54,760
from the 60s, from the 60s, from the 90s,

2650
02:18:55,680 --> 02:18:58,200
those early TV titles

2651
02:18:58,200 --> 02:19:02,520
when there was just zeros and ones and blips played on my telescope.

2652
02:19:04,360 --> 02:19:06,280
So from the 90s, things like what was it?

2653
02:19:06,280 --> 02:19:07,920
Tank Wars and Scorched Earth.

2654
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:10,040
Those are the games. Can you play?

2655
02:19:10,040 --> 02:19:12,480
We played it with real worms and real grenades.

2656
02:19:12,560 --> 02:19:13,480
We need to do.

2657
02:19:13,480 --> 02:19:17,640
Loki, you and I need to play Scorched Earth on a live stream someday.

2658
02:19:17,840 --> 02:19:20,800
We do. That would be fun.

2659
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,560
Do they can you even run it at normal speed anymore?

2660
02:19:23,560 --> 02:19:27,440
Would it go like I'm sure they've got like there's also Tank Wars and stuff.

2661
02:19:27,640 --> 02:19:30,000
I'm sure there's an online version of that.

2662
02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:31,320
Oh, God, I've got to find that.

2663
02:19:31,320 --> 02:19:33,120
We've got to make that happen some night anyway.

2664
02:19:33,320 --> 02:19:35,800
But Worms was kind of like an evolution of that stuff.

2665
02:19:35,800 --> 02:19:38,280
Right. Where instead of tanks, it became worms.

2666
02:19:38,440 --> 02:19:43,640
And in celebration of twenty five years of the entire franchise,

2667
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:48,880
developer Team 17 put out an update for Worms Armageddon on the PC.

2668
02:19:49,160 --> 02:19:52,960
Seven years worth of fixes, changes and improvements.

2669
02:19:53,160 --> 02:19:55,240
The announcement was made on Twitter and Steam.

2670
02:19:55,240 --> 02:20:00,800
There's a new three point eight update for the 1999 release Worms Armageddon.

2671
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:05,760
And there's some of the fan improvements and fixes, some mod features

2672
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:07,800
and are now integrated into the game.

2673
02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:11,680
For example, somebody named Rubber Worm in the I'm sorry,

2674
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:13,600
that's one of the mods or the actual mod names.

2675
02:20:13,800 --> 02:20:16,720
It was a popular Armageddon mod that lets you manipulate the physics

2676
02:20:16,720 --> 02:20:18,760
and fire multiple weapons in a single turn.

2677
02:20:18,880 --> 02:20:20,480
And so now that's in the official game.

2678
02:20:20,720 --> 02:20:21,840
So that's pretty cool.

2679
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:25,080
That's a real neat fan love letter is that you know what?

2680
02:20:25,080 --> 02:20:28,440
We are going to embrace these fan mods now as official canon.

2681
02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:29,880
That's pretty cool.

2682
02:20:29,880 --> 02:20:32,560
And we're seeing developers do that more and more like we kind of saw that

2683
02:20:32,560 --> 02:20:37,120
with the recent Doom rerelease on like PlayStation four and stuff

2684
02:20:37,120 --> 02:20:41,960
where like the big user community wads are like right there in the game

2685
02:20:41,960 --> 02:20:43,920
and you can just install them for free and play them.

2686
02:20:44,080 --> 02:20:45,040
I think that's really rad.

2687
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:48,560
So, yeah, that I love this like community,

2688
02:20:48,760 --> 02:20:52,000
the developers embracing the modding community like this is really cool.

2689
02:20:53,400 --> 02:20:55,600
Can't wait for the rerelease of Mass Effect.

2690
02:20:55,600 --> 02:20:59,200
That's just going to embrace the H the high res texture mods

2691
02:20:59,480 --> 02:21:01,640
that are already out there.

2692
02:21:01,640 --> 02:21:03,840
We'll see. All right.

2693
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:06,640
Anyhow, pretty cool. I like that.

2694
02:21:06,880 --> 02:21:09,640
All right. This is the part of the show where we're going to open up

2695
02:21:09,640 --> 02:21:12,520
our chat room for any questions or any topics we didn't get to tonight.

2696
02:21:12,720 --> 02:21:14,680
So if you have anything you want to bring to the listener roundtable,

2697
02:21:14,680 --> 02:21:20,200
twitch.tv slash vog network and Hype Mayhem is always like on it, ready to go.

2698
02:21:20,200 --> 02:21:22,240
I love it. Hype Mayhem says questions.

2699
02:21:22,240 --> 02:21:25,480
Seeing that digital games are prevalent nowadays, especially on PC,

2700
02:21:25,720 --> 02:21:29,160
our physical games, their cases, boxes and any extras included.

2701
02:21:29,160 --> 02:21:32,320
See, special editions have any place or relevancy nowadays.

2702
02:21:32,560 --> 02:21:35,400
People used to love displaying their games and stuff on shelves

2703
02:21:35,400 --> 02:21:36,520
for the longest time.

2704
02:21:36,520 --> 02:21:40,680
But nowadays, people love the freebies on Epic or the seasonal Steam GOG sales.

2705
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:43,200
Plus, there's a subscription stuff, too.

2706
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:45,880
Has displaying your collection gone the way of the dodo?

2707
02:21:46,640 --> 02:21:48,200
Excellent question.

2708
02:21:48,200 --> 02:21:53,720
And one that comes up often on gaming shows and the community

2709
02:21:53,720 --> 02:21:56,920
these days is like, are we really ready to go all digital?

2710
02:21:56,920 --> 02:22:00,160
And the simplest answer to this question is that there's always

2711
02:22:00,160 --> 02:22:02,880
there's just there's just always going to be both.

2712
02:22:02,880 --> 02:22:05,680
And you see a company like Limited Run Games.

2713
02:22:05,880 --> 02:22:07,800
And we talked about them on the show a couple of weeks ago.

2714
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:11,240
They're doing all these limited runs like that

2715
02:22:11,240 --> 02:22:15,600
Shante game on the Game Boy Color that group is rereleasing, for God's sake.

2716
02:22:15,600 --> 02:22:18,400
Like they're doing a lot of physical releases.

2717
02:22:18,400 --> 02:22:21,720
So there is always going to be a call for collectibles.

2718
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:25,200
And I've brought up this analogy on OLR before.

2719
02:22:25,200 --> 02:22:27,200
It's been a bit, so I'll bring it up again.

2720
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:29,760
We're not really like an analogy, but but the fact that

2721
02:22:30,320 --> 02:22:34,720
the physical games that you own end up having equity. Right.

2722
02:22:35,640 --> 02:22:38,480
And I don't like to go and buy games digitally

2723
02:22:38,760 --> 02:22:42,480
unless there's some type of trade off, because essentially, if I buy digitally,

2724
02:22:42,480 --> 02:22:45,960
I'm giving up that equity because you can't trade your digital games.

2725
02:22:46,280 --> 02:22:49,880
So if Epic is going to give me a free game, well, shit,

2726
02:22:49,880 --> 02:22:52,000
that's a good way to make me let go of equity.

2727
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,160
Give it to me for free. Right.

2728
02:22:54,160 --> 02:22:56,520
And so that's what a lot of people have done with their digital collections.

2729
02:22:57,560 --> 02:22:59,520
And now things are getting to a point.

2730
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:01,760
I think there's a lot of people who are finding themselves

2731
02:23:01,760 --> 02:23:04,320
more and more inconvenienced with physical media.

2732
02:23:04,680 --> 02:23:08,040
For example, I think about Bobby Blackwolf and the setup in his house.

2733
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:13,000
And sorry, Bobby, I don't mean to speak for you, but if I lived in your house,

2734
02:23:13,280 --> 02:23:16,320
I would imagine when I want to play games down there in that basement,

2735
02:23:16,880 --> 02:23:19,760
it would actually be kind of a pain in the ass to have physical media.

2736
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:22,960
Sometimes it would be much easier to just have games digital

2737
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:25,960
so I could kind of like flip between them there, because like getting up

2738
02:23:25,960 --> 02:23:28,880
to open the door that has the consoles in it and all that stuff

2739
02:23:29,120 --> 02:23:31,880
might end up being a little bit of a pain.

2740
02:23:31,880 --> 02:23:35,120
So you might give up your equity because you kind of know

2741
02:23:35,120 --> 02:23:38,160
I'm never going to sell these games back, whatever, and that whole thing.

2742
02:23:40,480 --> 02:23:43,800
But also something that's kind of driven me back to physical,

2743
02:23:43,800 --> 02:23:45,600
like I was kind of at this point where I was like,

2744
02:23:45,600 --> 02:23:48,920
I'm buying more and more digital, like I just bought Animal Crossing digital.

2745
02:23:48,920 --> 02:23:52,280
I pop Pokemon digital because I'm like, these are types of games

2746
02:23:52,280 --> 02:23:54,080
that you just want to kind of always have available

2747
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:56,760
and you don't want to have to switch a cartridge in and out or anything like that.

2748
02:23:56,760 --> 02:24:00,560
So, you know, like there's there's that.

2749
02:24:02,200 --> 02:24:04,280
But then Alan got a switch, too.

2750
02:24:05,280 --> 02:24:07,480
And now it's like, well, wait a minute,

2751
02:24:07,480 --> 02:24:10,120
I don't really want to buy digital games because Alan can't play them

2752
02:24:10,120 --> 02:24:11,920
if I buy them digitally.

2753
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:15,040
So now I'm back to I want to get physical releases

2754
02:24:15,320 --> 02:24:18,400
so that he can play them, too, if he if he would play anything else

2755
02:24:18,400 --> 02:24:20,400
besides Dark Souls and Animal Crossing.

2756
02:24:20,400 --> 02:24:22,720
But that's what makes him happy. So whatever.

2757
02:24:22,720 --> 02:24:25,520
But it does make me think, well, maybe he'll want to play Zelda someday

2758
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:27,080
or maybe he'll want to play his other game someday.

2759
02:24:27,080 --> 02:24:29,360
So I should probably get it on physical media.

2760
02:24:29,360 --> 02:24:31,720
So there's that, too.

2761
02:24:31,720 --> 02:24:33,920
And Bobby does clarify.

2762
02:24:34,080 --> 02:24:37,600
Yes, I still like my physical media because of my data cap.

2763
02:24:37,600 --> 02:24:39,320
That's a very good point, too.

2764
02:24:39,320 --> 02:24:40,480
Marissa Mizell in chat.

2765
02:24:40,480 --> 02:24:44,440
Hi, Marissa says my Internet connection is awful, so I still like physical,

2766
02:24:44,440 --> 02:24:47,560
but I also like owning the product and not licensing it.

2767
02:24:48,240 --> 02:24:50,200
Tiger Claw talks about shelf space.

2768
02:24:50,200 --> 02:24:52,720
You might not have enough space to store all your physical media.

2769
02:24:52,960 --> 02:24:54,320
That's why we joke about.

2770
02:24:54,320 --> 02:24:57,240
I don't have any room for a shelf to have shelf space.

2771
02:24:57,280 --> 02:25:00,440
Well, and that's why we joke about Dark Sakura's vault. Right.

2772
02:25:00,480 --> 02:25:03,680
She has a lot of physical stuff from especially from back in the day

2773
02:25:03,680 --> 02:25:04,720
in the older systems.

2774
02:25:04,720 --> 02:25:08,880
But at one point, there was literally an entire room in her house dedicated to it.

2775
02:25:08,920 --> 02:25:10,720
That's how much space it took up.

2776
02:25:10,720 --> 02:25:13,800
There's a very old YouTube, very, very old YouTube video out there

2777
02:25:13,800 --> 02:25:15,560
on the channel Orange Lounge Radio.

2778
02:25:15,560 --> 02:25:17,720
If you didn't know, it's like very old.

2779
02:25:17,720 --> 02:25:20,400
But we actually show Dark Sakura's old vault in one of the videos.

2780
02:25:20,400 --> 02:25:22,440
So that's out there.

2781
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:25,640
DJ Rama S says, I'm OK with buying digital,

2782
02:25:25,640 --> 02:25:27,880
but not when it's the same price as the physical release.

2783
02:25:27,880 --> 02:25:28,800
Yeah, there's that.

2784
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:31,200
And that's that's the equity, right?

2785
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:34,960
Like, what am I what am I getting digital but physical?

2786
02:25:34,960 --> 02:25:38,040
I'll have something that I could technically give, sell back or give out

2787
02:25:38,040 --> 02:25:40,240
or, you know, trade or what have you.

2788
02:25:40,480 --> 02:25:44,800
So I think the answer to that is really going to be different for everybody.

2789
02:25:44,960 --> 02:25:47,280
And for me, it is.

2790
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:50,360
I'll go digital if there's a good reason for me to go digital.

2791
02:25:50,840 --> 02:25:53,800
Otherwise, excuse me, otherwise I still tend to go physical,

2792
02:25:54,120 --> 02:25:57,360
especially with Nintendo Switch, those cartridges are like itty bitty.

2793
02:25:57,360 --> 02:25:58,920
They don't take up shelf space.

2794
02:25:58,920 --> 02:26:01,880
I do. I keep all the boxes somewhere, but then I have my little purse,

2795
02:26:01,880 --> 02:26:04,320
my switch purse that has all my games in it.

2796
02:26:04,600 --> 02:26:07,280
And it's not going to fill up anytime soon because those cartridges are itty bitty.

2797
02:26:08,120 --> 02:26:12,480
So anything you want to add to that, Loki, about the whole digital versus physical?

2798
02:26:13,280 --> 02:26:17,000
Oh, I just I always thought I wasn't going to do mostly digital as well.

2799
02:26:17,600 --> 02:26:21,360
But then, you know, that ended up being the complete opposite.

2800
02:26:21,360 --> 02:26:25,040
So, yeah, really, for me, a lot of times

2801
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:29,080
the sales seem to be more frequent on the digital stuff.

2802
02:26:29,480 --> 02:26:31,760
And a lot of the stuff I get is also only digital,

2803
02:26:31,840 --> 02:26:34,280
but it's also more convenient to like,

2804
02:26:34,800 --> 02:26:37,200
you know, the local game style closed down over here.

2805
02:26:37,200 --> 02:26:41,440
So, I mean, I could order from Amazon or something like that,

2806
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:44,600
but it's just it's easier to know.

2807
02:26:44,600 --> 02:26:47,120
I don't have to worry about it coming in the mail.

2808
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:49,720
It's usually available 9 p.m.

2809
02:26:49,720 --> 02:26:51,760
the night before it's supposed to release.

2810
02:26:51,760 --> 02:26:58,280
So I just I don't see myself going out and trading in stuff as much as I used to.

2811
02:26:58,280 --> 02:27:02,880
And even when I was it, you don't get anything for it.

2812
02:27:02,880 --> 02:27:06,080
And yeah, I know you could go sell stuff on eBay, but that's a hassle.

2813
02:27:06,120 --> 02:27:10,560
So for me, it's just the time saved is more valuable than the

2814
02:27:11,720 --> 02:27:14,280
money I might make back from selling something.

2815
02:27:14,600 --> 02:27:18,360
All right. I'll open it up to chat to see if there's any other questions.

2816
02:27:18,360 --> 02:27:21,160
In the meantime, while we see if there's any other discussion topics,

2817
02:27:21,720 --> 02:27:24,200
Loki, I usually open it up for any last minute stories you might have.

2818
02:27:24,840 --> 02:27:28,120
Yeah. So there's going to be a Dragon's Dogma anime series.

2819
02:27:28,120 --> 02:27:31,320
It's going to be coming to Netflix September 17th.

2820
02:27:31,640 --> 02:27:34,600
That's interesting, you know, considering that Castlevania has done well.

2821
02:27:35,320 --> 02:27:39,960
I'd be interested to see how this one fares as well, but be pretty cool.

2822
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:41,840
I'm not very familiar with the series.

2823
02:27:41,840 --> 02:27:47,200
I know it's kind of similar to, I think, Skyrim or an Elder Scrolls type of game.

2824
02:27:47,200 --> 02:27:51,520
But I think the other side from just the adventuring and the fantasy stuff like that,

2825
02:27:51,520 --> 02:27:53,120
it's probably pretty different.

2826
02:27:53,120 --> 02:27:57,440
But as that is that is excited in chat saying, ah, best game.

2827
02:27:58,480 --> 02:28:00,800
So, yeah, be cool. I can't wait to see it.

2828
02:28:01,680 --> 02:28:05,320
Yeah, the success of things like The Witcher and Castlevania, man, it's just

2829
02:28:05,320 --> 02:28:10,760
it's going to make this video game stuff on on demand services really explode.

2830
02:28:11,160 --> 02:28:14,360
I'm so hyped for Final Fantasy 14 whenever they get that going.

2831
02:28:14,360 --> 02:28:16,120
Like, obviously, Covid has that stock right now.

2832
02:28:16,120 --> 02:28:20,120
But, you know, back in the day, you know, when it's like, oh, the video game adaptation.

2833
02:28:20,120 --> 02:28:25,560
Oh, you know, now it's like, oh, hey, people, they finally get it now.

2834
02:28:25,560 --> 02:28:27,800
They they they know how to do it right.

2835
02:28:29,960 --> 02:28:33,720
All right. I have to read this comment from She-Hulk in chat because it's the best reason

2836
02:28:33,720 --> 02:28:35,400
against physical media.

2837
02:28:35,400 --> 02:28:39,080
When I have a cat in my lap, I cannot get up to change the disk.

2838
02:28:40,040 --> 02:28:41,000
Good thinking, She-Hulk.

2839
02:28:44,200 --> 02:28:49,400
Marissa is telling a story about how iTunes removed some TVs and movies because the publisher,

2840
02:28:49,400 --> 02:28:51,880
I guess, had pulled the material off iTunes.

2841
02:28:51,880 --> 02:28:55,560
So that is kind of scary, too, when the digital license gets revoked to physical media.

2842
02:28:55,560 --> 02:28:57,800
Sometimes the only way you can kind of keep things.

2843
02:28:57,800 --> 02:29:00,680
That's it's rare, but it does happen.

2844
02:29:00,680 --> 02:29:02,280
I've heard of that with video games, too.

2845
02:29:03,400 --> 02:29:07,640
It's typically, you know, well, that was all different.

2846
02:29:07,800 --> 02:29:09,320
I know a little bit of it.

2847
02:29:10,200 --> 02:29:14,840
Typically, though, when they're removing stuff off of a service like not they're just not

2848
02:29:14,840 --> 02:29:18,040
selling it anymore, but you'd still have access to your digital copies.

2849
02:29:18,040 --> 02:29:24,120
It's very rare that they ever remove it completely from your library.

2850
02:29:24,120 --> 02:29:26,120
Yeah, but I can understand not wanting to take a chance.

2851
02:29:26,120 --> 02:29:26,920
I get that.

2852
02:29:27,480 --> 02:29:27,980
Yeah.

2853
02:29:28,600 --> 02:29:33,480
It's happened a lot with different like Ninja Turtles, for example, has had it where the

2854
02:29:33,480 --> 02:29:35,320
rights have gone away.

2855
02:29:35,320 --> 02:29:38,840
And they've also done it with other things where they'll even mark down the game to,

2856
02:29:38,840 --> 02:29:43,480
like, a ridiculously low price because they know that they're pulling the rights to it

2857
02:29:43,480 --> 02:29:44,120
pretty soon.

2858
02:29:44,120 --> 02:29:44,620
So.

2859
02:29:46,200 --> 02:29:49,720
Oh, this is a dark to see you found a free version of scorched earth online.

2860
02:29:49,720 --> 02:29:52,440
Can you tweet me that link dark to see because I'll lose it in the chat.

2861
02:29:52,440 --> 02:29:53,160
So thank you.

2862
02:29:53,160 --> 02:29:53,960
I want to check that out.

2863
02:29:54,520 --> 02:29:55,320
OK, sorry, lucky.

2864
02:29:55,960 --> 02:29:59,560
I was going to say some other things, though, that we've seen is not necessarily and that

2865
02:29:59,560 --> 02:30:00,200
link doesn't work.

2866
02:30:01,160 --> 02:30:11,480
Is that not only does we have games removed from your library, but also like games alter,

2867
02:30:11,480 --> 02:30:16,280
like, for example, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and even Grand Theft Auto four have had like

2868
02:30:16,280 --> 02:30:17,800
music taken out of the game.

2869
02:30:17,800 --> 02:30:18,520
Good call.

2870
02:30:18,520 --> 02:30:19,640
The music change.

2871
02:30:19,640 --> 02:30:20,840
Yeah, the license.

2872
02:30:20,840 --> 02:30:24,440
Yeah, there's not much you can do that with the games constantly updating.

2873
02:30:24,440 --> 02:30:29,000
So, yeah, you know, and that discussion is coming up again when we're talking about Xbox

2874
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:34,600
backwards compatibility is that Microsoft will not commit to the full library being

2875
02:30:34,600 --> 02:30:37,880
backwards backwards compatible from Xbox one on Series X.

2876
02:30:38,440 --> 02:30:42,040
It sounds like there will be some rare games that will not be backwards compatible.

2877
02:30:42,040 --> 02:30:43,800
And it doesn't sound like it's a technology thing.

2878
02:30:43,800 --> 02:30:47,000
It sounds like it's a licensing thing, like something in that realm.

2879
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:51,160
Like and I don't know this for sure, but it is an example.

2880
02:30:51,800 --> 02:30:53,480
Something like Rock Band 4.

2881
02:30:54,280 --> 02:30:58,040
I could see where maybe they're not going to let that play on the new one because of

2882
02:30:58,040 --> 02:31:00,040
like music and licensing and those types of things.

2883
02:31:00,040 --> 02:31:05,800
Again, not that I've heard that game specifically, but I could see where, oh, maybe that's going

2884
02:31:05,800 --> 02:31:06,920
to complicate it.

2885
02:31:06,920 --> 02:31:07,560
It's interesting.

2886
02:31:09,080 --> 02:31:09,320
Yeah.

2887
02:31:10,120 --> 02:31:10,440
All right.

2888
02:31:11,080 --> 02:31:12,360
Any other last minute stories for us?

2889
02:31:14,840 --> 02:31:16,360
No, that's pretty much it.

2890
02:31:16,360 --> 02:31:16,840
All right.

2891
02:31:16,840 --> 02:31:21,320
Then I think we are good to wrap up and get our final thoughts out.

2892
02:31:21,320 --> 02:31:24,440
Hey, I want to thank you guys for listening and participating with Orange Launch Radio

2893
02:31:24,440 --> 02:31:25,240
tonight.

2894
02:31:25,240 --> 02:31:26,120
Thank you so much.

2895
02:31:26,200 --> 02:31:29,400
If you liked what you heard here at the show, help us spread the message.

2896
02:31:29,400 --> 02:31:32,920
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the gamers voices aren't here to put

2897
02:31:32,920 --> 02:31:36,120
out on the air, then what can we do?

2898
02:31:36,120 --> 02:31:37,480
Tell a friend or two about the show.

2899
02:31:37,480 --> 02:31:40,760
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2900
02:31:41,400 --> 02:31:45,320
And again, I want to thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening, whether it was

2901
02:31:45,320 --> 02:31:48,680
on the podcast feed or if it was on our Twitch feed.

2902
02:31:48,680 --> 02:31:52,200
Either way, just thank you for being here and being a part of our Sunday nights.

2903
02:31:52,200 --> 02:31:57,400
And I hope we, uh, made for some good entertainment on your Sunday night or Monday afternoon,

2904
02:31:57,400 --> 02:31:59,880
whenever you're listening to this, um, super appreciate it.

2905
02:32:00,440 --> 02:32:07,800
My final thought for tonight is, um, you guys didn't get to see it on the Twitch stream

2906
02:32:07,800 --> 02:32:11,000
because the discord is in the way, but I'll switch the shot real quick.

2907
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:14,360
So there's this little basket here on the couch.

2908
02:32:14,360 --> 02:32:18,520
And I was really hoping because earlier today, about two or three o'clock, Mr.

2909
02:32:18,520 --> 02:32:23,800
Smoosh climbed up in this basket and I got from work and was sitting there and actually

2910
02:32:23,800 --> 02:32:27,400
Smoosh was sitting there until like five 30.

2911
02:32:27,400 --> 02:32:31,560
It was about halfway through Bobby show when he finally got up to leave.

2912
02:32:31,560 --> 02:32:33,880
I guess, I guess he didn't care for the Bobby black Wolf show.

2913
02:32:33,880 --> 02:32:34,360
I don't know.

2914
02:32:34,360 --> 02:32:38,280
It wasn't that it was, he just, he'd been there for hours and I think he knew his food

2915
02:32:38,280 --> 02:32:40,760
thing was going to go off soon because it goes off at six o'clock.

2916
02:32:40,760 --> 02:32:44,440
So I knew he wouldn't make it to OLR, but I thought I might get him for the Bobby call,

2917
02:32:44,440 --> 02:32:46,440
but apparently, uh, sadly I didn't.

2918
02:32:46,440 --> 02:32:47,720
So I was hoping he'd come back.

2919
02:32:48,280 --> 02:32:50,600
So I'm going to hope in a future week, I'm going to leave this.

2920
02:32:50,600 --> 02:32:56,360
So you might all be wondering why is there a basket mixed in with all the video game

2921
02:32:56,360 --> 02:32:57,960
crap that we have on the couch?

2922
02:32:57,960 --> 02:32:59,560
Why is a basket suddenly mixed in?

2923
02:32:59,560 --> 02:33:03,560
That is going to be the answer because I'm, this is Smoosh's throne and I'm waiting for

2924
02:33:03,560 --> 02:33:05,960
him to come back and have a seat.

2925
02:33:05,960 --> 02:33:09,400
And yes, I did tweet a picture earlier and Tiger Claw dug that up there.

2926
02:33:09,400 --> 02:33:11,480
So you can check out that picture if you want.

2927
02:33:11,480 --> 02:33:11,720
All right.

2928
02:33:11,720 --> 02:33:12,920
That's my very long final thought.

2929
02:33:12,920 --> 02:33:13,800
Loki, your final thought.

2930
02:33:13,800 --> 02:33:19,720
Oh, um, I did remember there was one story that I didn't talk about, but, um, it's kind

2931
02:33:19,720 --> 02:33:26,760
of a given since there's a lot of other retailers doing this, but mandating masks, um, the apparently

2932
02:33:26,760 --> 02:33:32,040
GameStop is going to be, um, putting out notices on their doors saying that they're requiring

2933
02:33:32,040 --> 02:33:35,800
masks in shop, but they're not allowing the employees to enforce that.

2934
02:33:37,080 --> 02:33:41,720
So, you know, that's a thing, I guess it's a dangerous situation.

2935
02:33:41,720 --> 02:33:45,240
Like, I can't believe I'm going to defend this because I fully believe people need to

2936
02:33:45,240 --> 02:33:49,560
be wearing their fucking masks, but they're not paying those employees enough to deal

2937
02:33:49,560 --> 02:33:50,360
with that bullshit.

2938
02:33:50,360 --> 02:33:55,880
Well, I need, I need to watch my words because at the same time, those employees shouldn't

2939
02:33:55,880 --> 02:33:57,800
be exposed to COVID in the first place.

2940
02:33:57,800 --> 02:34:00,440
So I hope they have some type of glass thing set up.

2941
02:34:00,440 --> 02:34:02,440
Like you might see the 7-Eleven or something like that.

2942
02:34:02,440 --> 02:34:03,880
I really, really hope.

2943
02:34:03,880 --> 02:34:08,120
But at the same time, like those guys just aren't paid enough to like fight with somebody

2944
02:34:08,120 --> 02:34:09,960
and throw them out of the store and that whole thing.

2945
02:34:09,960 --> 02:34:13,880
Like people should just be decent enough to wear their masks in the store in the first

2946
02:34:13,880 --> 02:34:14,440
place, but.

2947
02:34:16,040 --> 02:34:16,520
Right.

2948
02:34:16,520 --> 02:34:18,760
And there's a whole, whole other situation.

2949
02:34:18,760 --> 02:34:23,720
I mean, um, there was other stuff I saw this week too, about talking about pre-orders and

2950
02:34:23,720 --> 02:34:24,040
everything.

2951
02:34:24,040 --> 02:34:28,120
And if you have games pre-ordered as store and that store happens to close down, which

2952
02:34:28,120 --> 02:34:33,000
a lot of them are because they're running, they're having financial problems right now.

2953
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:36,200
Um, you're not getting your money back or at least you're not getting your money back

2954
02:34:36,200 --> 02:34:37,240
without quite a fight.

2955
02:34:37,240 --> 02:34:41,400
So just keep that in mind when you're pre-ordering stuff, especially with brand new consoles

2956
02:34:41,400 --> 02:34:48,440
around the corner, that they're going to keep your money unless you drag it out and calling

2957
02:34:48,440 --> 02:34:51,800
corporates like I do anything because you're just going to be on hold for hours without

2958
02:34:51,800 --> 02:34:52,600
them picking up.

2959
02:34:52,600 --> 02:34:58,440
They know fully well that they're doing this and they just don't care because what are

2960
02:34:58,440 --> 02:34:59,160
you going to do about it?

2961
02:34:59,160 --> 02:35:04,520
Yeah, that's, that's gonna, GameStop might want to clarify or clear up that policy before

2962
02:35:04,520 --> 02:35:09,240
they do start because that word is going to spread around social media fast, uh, around

2963
02:35:09,240 --> 02:35:13,080
the time of one of the things that could be the only thing that keeps GameStop afloat

2964
02:35:13,080 --> 02:35:14,120
for another year.

2965
02:35:14,120 --> 02:35:20,600
Um, so if I were GameStop, I would, uh, I would clear that up real fast or they're going

2966
02:35:20,600 --> 02:35:24,280
to have some people decide to take that pre-order elsewhere.

2967
02:35:24,280 --> 02:35:29,720
Uh, that's a scary thought, but I feel like their upper management is so dumb.

2968
02:35:29,720 --> 02:35:31,800
Um, they probably won't even think of that.

2969
02:35:31,800 --> 02:35:33,800
And that is why GameStop is failing.

2970
02:35:34,760 --> 02:35:35,000
Yeah.

2971
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:36,040
So just be careful.

2972
02:35:36,840 --> 02:35:37,320
Yeah.

2973
02:35:37,320 --> 02:35:37,720
All right.

2974
02:35:37,720 --> 02:35:38,280
Great.

2975
02:35:38,280 --> 02:35:38,760
Great.

2976
02:35:38,760 --> 02:35:40,520
Final thought slash last story.

2977
02:35:40,520 --> 02:35:41,320
All right.

2978
02:35:41,320 --> 02:35:42,680
Uh, that's it everybody.

2979
02:35:42,680 --> 02:35:43,560
Thank you, Loki.

2980
02:35:43,560 --> 02:35:44,600
Thanks Dark Sakura.

2981
02:35:44,600 --> 02:35:46,840
Thanks you all for being here tonight.

2982
02:35:46,840 --> 02:35:49,720

2983
02:35:49,720 --> 02:35:51,240

2984
02:35:51,240 --> 02:35:51,960
