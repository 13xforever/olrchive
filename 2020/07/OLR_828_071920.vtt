00:00.000 --> 00:13.440
In the year of hindsight, we find ourselves with non-news and weird news.

00:13.440 --> 00:17.280
Would it surprise you to hear that Sony is ramping up more supply of PlayStation 5s?

00:17.280 --> 00:19.520
Can you have more when you're already making many?

00:19.520 --> 00:20.520
Shrug.

00:20.520 --> 00:24.560
Also, Microsoft Flight Simulator's Physical Edition is coming on 10 DVDs because Blu-ray

00:24.560 --> 00:28.240
won the war but hasn't proliferated outside of devices that connect to your TV.

00:28.240 --> 00:32.080
Tonight, your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki bring you news that would require

00:32.080 --> 00:37.120
three audio CDs to hold, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.120 --> 00:44.680
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

00:44.680 --> 00:49.360
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:49.360 --> 00:57.880
It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again tonight with episode number 828 for this July

00:57.880 --> 01:00.480
19th of 2020.

01:00.480 --> 01:05.760
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you live from our studio in Sacramento, California, where

01:05.760 --> 01:10.880
we would all collaborate usually over the last 18 years in the same room.

01:10.880 --> 01:14.020
But due to the way things are in the world, we're doing a little bit of social distant

01:14.020 --> 01:16.420
recording thanks to the magic of Discord.

01:16.420 --> 01:18.320
So I'm here and joining me on Discord.

01:18.320 --> 01:20.560
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:20.560 --> 01:21.560
Hello.

01:21.560 --> 01:22.560
Hi, how are you?

01:22.560 --> 01:23.560
I don't know.

01:23.560 --> 01:24.560
Maybe I should make it a little bit more obvious.

01:24.560 --> 01:30.400
I am protecting myself from the plague.

01:30.400 --> 01:37.360
I have my plague mask shoved with Rosemary in it right now.

01:37.360 --> 01:41.600
So you're showing off your mask on Twitch, because even though this is a radio podcast

01:41.600 --> 01:42.600
—

01:42.600 --> 01:43.600
People can screenshot it.

01:43.600 --> 01:44.600
Yeah, that's true.

01:44.600 --> 01:45.600
We do tape live —

01:45.600 --> 01:47.480
And it's low because I've got this damn mask on.

01:47.480 --> 01:52.320
We do tape live every Sunday night at The Voice of the Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash

01:52.320 --> 01:56.740
VOG Network Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby

01:56.740 --> 01:57.740
Blackwell show.

01:57.740 --> 02:01.040
So if you do want to see some of the video, you can join us live or you can subscribe

02:01.040 --> 02:03.080
to us over at VOG Network.

02:03.080 --> 02:08.100
And yeah, I guess the elaborate mask that you're wearing is impacting some of the audio,

02:08.100 --> 02:09.440
but I think we got that now.

02:09.440 --> 02:13.040
I folded the mask under now, so that should be a little bit better.

02:13.040 --> 02:14.840
Oh yeah, that sounds better to me.

02:14.840 --> 02:18.960
So you get the top down view without me covering my mouth.

02:18.960 --> 02:19.960
Ta-da!

02:19.960 --> 02:20.960
Ta-da!

02:21.000 --> 02:25.160
I feel now like I should actually have like a gachamon helmet on instead.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.640
Just call me June the swallow.

02:27.640 --> 02:31.800
Some of the comments from our chat room over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, sg100matt

02:31.800 --> 02:34.600
says, the mask protects her from the haters.

02:34.600 --> 02:35.600
Tiger —

02:35.600 --> 02:36.600
What haters?

02:36.600 --> 02:39.000
Tigerclaws says she should take that mask to work.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.680
Imagine how the coworkers would react, but you're working from home right now.

02:41.680 --> 02:42.680
I work from home.

02:42.680 --> 02:43.680
Exactly.

02:43.680 --> 02:44.680
Yeah.

02:44.680 --> 02:47.960
I mean, this arrived the day after because I had to go in and clean out my desk at work,

02:47.960 --> 02:51.840
which means it's all official now.

02:51.840 --> 02:55.640
If I had this yesterday, the day that I went, I would have worn it, but it actually arrived

02:55.640 --> 02:56.640
yesterday.

02:56.640 --> 02:59.600
So, oh well.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.320
Was that a friend online who made that?

03:02.320 --> 03:04.640
Yeah, my friend Amber did.

03:04.640 --> 03:05.640
Nice.

03:05.640 --> 03:08.680
And for those that aren't able to see the video, it's kind of like a space type of thing,

03:08.680 --> 03:12.120
but it's against the old school type of plague mask with the big beak.

03:12.120 --> 03:17.280
So a dark Sakura kind of looks like bird Sakura tonight.

03:17.280 --> 03:21.160
Here is a picture on my Twitter from yesterday.

03:21.160 --> 03:22.500
So there you go.

03:22.500 --> 03:23.500
Good way to —

03:23.500 --> 03:24.760
You got to go hunting for it.

03:24.760 --> 03:27.280
Good way to get the cheap plug in for the Twitter there.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.720
And my Instagram at dark Sakura.

03:29.720 --> 03:32.780
Questbuster in chat says she's ready to treat medieval patients.

03:32.780 --> 03:33.780
That's right.

03:33.780 --> 03:36.040
Yeah, I'm going to give them cocaine.

03:36.040 --> 03:41.160
She's also ready to greet people who misbehave in our chat room tonight.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.960
Any random Twitch trolls beware.

03:43.960 --> 03:44.960
Speaking of trolls —

03:44.960 --> 03:46.540
I never get trolled.

03:46.540 --> 03:49.600
Also say hello, uh, joining us every week here on the show.

03:49.600 --> 03:50.600
Say hello to tech master.

03:50.600 --> 03:51.600
Loki.

03:51.600 --> 03:52.600
Hello.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.600
Hi, how are you?

03:53.600 --> 03:54.660
I'm doing fine.

03:54.660 --> 03:59.340
And I see tonight you've got some — is that Minecraft going on behind you, like an elaborate?

03:59.340 --> 04:00.340
Yes.

04:00.340 --> 04:05.540
And this is actually a B-roll that I recorded just before the show of my actual server.

04:05.540 --> 04:09.340
So this is all of the stuff that I've built.

04:09.340 --> 04:12.420
I thought you were actually like playing the way you were kind of looking.

04:12.420 --> 04:16.460
I thought you might be like actually playing Minecraft right now while doing the show.

04:16.460 --> 04:19.840
Technically, yes, I was playing Minecraft at the time to record that.

04:19.840 --> 04:23.860
So this is like, for example, the second or third floor in my basement with the automatic

04:23.860 --> 04:24.860
sorting system.

04:24.860 --> 04:26.860
It's all redstone I've built.

04:26.860 --> 04:28.740
But yeah, I'll be scrolling.

04:28.740 --> 04:32.900
It'll be just showing kind of the stuff I've built over the course of things like 15 minutes

04:32.900 --> 04:33.900
long.

04:33.900 --> 04:34.900
It'll just be looping.

04:34.900 --> 04:35.900
Wow.

04:35.900 --> 04:36.900
All right.

04:36.900 --> 04:37.900
Well, it looks fancy for Minecraft.

04:37.900 --> 04:38.900
It looks pretty cool.

04:38.900 --> 04:42.060
It's been, yeah, a few months, so it's pretty fancy now.

04:42.060 --> 04:43.060
All right.

04:43.060 --> 04:45.460
Well, let's get into some news tonight.

04:45.460 --> 04:48.820
Of course, Minecraft is a Microsoft property now.

04:48.820 --> 04:52.720
And we know we're going to be getting a lot of Microsoft news coming up this week.

04:52.720 --> 04:57.300
And in advance of that, we have some other little details that have come out kind of

04:57.300 --> 05:00.020
in advance of the show on the 23rd.

05:00.020 --> 05:01.580
Although we do know on the...

05:01.580 --> 05:04.420
And Loki, I'll ask you to recap these stories here in a minute.

05:04.420 --> 05:07.620
But what we do know on the 23rd is that we're not going to get a price.

05:07.620 --> 05:09.220
We're not going to get a date for the system.

05:09.220 --> 05:12.580
So they've already kind of set our expectations there.

05:12.580 --> 05:13.580
Sony didn't.

05:13.580 --> 05:14.580
Why should they?

05:14.700 --> 05:15.700
We don't know.

05:15.700 --> 05:17.660
We're not going to get either of those.

05:17.660 --> 05:20.020
But we will get games, games, games.

05:20.020 --> 05:26.700
So I imagine a new Halo kind of deep dive, hopefully something Forza, either mainline

05:26.700 --> 05:30.220
Horizon or maybe a new thing for Forza, who knows?

05:30.220 --> 05:32.680
And then I imagine we're getting maybe Fable.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.620
That's always the big rumor is that Fable's coming back.

05:34.620 --> 05:36.020
One of the studios is working on Fable.

05:36.020 --> 05:38.420
That'd be pretty cool.

05:38.420 --> 05:39.420
And then who knows?

05:39.420 --> 05:42.340
We know Microsoft has acquired many, many studios over the past couple of years.

05:42.340 --> 05:46.420
I think it was something like 13 studios, places like Double Fine and stuff.

05:46.420 --> 05:49.980
So we know Microsoft has been acquiring these studios, and we're going to find out this

05:49.980 --> 05:54.780
week what most of them likely have been working on, or at least a good chunk of them.

05:54.780 --> 05:58.020
We probably won't get to see them all, although that would be pretty impressive if they all

05:58.020 --> 05:59.020
had something.

05:59.020 --> 06:03.460
But imagine we'll see a good chunk of them, and that's to get everybody hyped, really,

06:03.460 --> 06:09.480
especially with Sony coming right off of some big exclusives on their system.

06:09.480 --> 06:15.360
Sony just released Ghosts of Tsushima this week, which is doing really well as far as

06:15.360 --> 06:18.400
a lot of the reviews and things people are saying online.

06:18.400 --> 06:24.480
They also, of course, have Last of Us 2, which, as I guess controversial as that game is,

06:24.480 --> 06:29.120
it seems like mostly critics agree it's pretty good.

06:29.120 --> 06:33.060
Just a lot of controversies and where the story went, I suppose.

06:33.060 --> 06:37.520
But in God of War, Horizon, Sony's got a lot of great, great IPs.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.140
So it's going to be interesting to see now Microsoft really kind of show what they're

06:40.140 --> 06:42.320
going to offer to really go against that.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.680
Meanwhile, Nintendo's over here putting out a new Mario game this week and kind of doing

06:45.680 --> 06:48.960
their own thing, and that's what's worked for them.

06:48.960 --> 06:53.960
Anyway, other big news, though, about Microsoft ahead of their event.

06:53.960 --> 06:56.960
I can't really say press conference, because that's what it would have been if this was

06:56.960 --> 06:57.960
an E3 world.

06:57.960 --> 07:01.520
Yeah, it's like an online direct, if you will.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.400
Virtual event on the 23rd.

07:03.920 --> 07:09.040
Yeah, so they announced, of course, that they're going to be wrapping up the production on

07:09.040 --> 07:17.360
the Xbox One X, which makes sense, because you have the Xbox Series X coming out.

07:17.360 --> 07:23.280
But they already have stopped production on that, so that's to be expected with the brand

07:23.280 --> 07:27.660
new version that's going to kind of replace it anyways.

07:27.660 --> 07:31.480
Or possibly something else that's unannounced yet that may replace it, so we'll have to

07:31.480 --> 07:32.480
wait and see.

07:33.400 --> 07:40.720
Along with that other cool stuff, Game Pass Ultimate now is going to be getting the X

07:40.720 --> 07:46.400
Cloud support, so that's going to be included with the price of Game Pass, which is pretty

07:46.400 --> 07:47.400
cool.

07:47.400 --> 07:51.400
So $15 a month to get all that with Xbox Live together.

07:51.400 --> 07:59.200
And then, of course, there's rumors that they may be just getting rid of Xbox Live

07:59.200 --> 08:08.160
Gold altogether, because already SKUs have been taken off of the Xbox website, where

08:08.160 --> 08:13.360
you cannot purchase a year subscription to Xbox Live Gold anymore.

08:13.360 --> 08:16.580
So you can only purchase three months or one month.

08:16.580 --> 08:20.580
So I'm wondering if maybe at the end of the year, they're just going to kick off Gold

08:20.580 --> 08:23.400
altogether and maybe replace it with something else.

08:23.400 --> 08:29.920
This Xbox Game Pass, it'll just be the one fee and you get all of the services under

08:29.920 --> 08:30.920
that one.

08:30.920 --> 08:37.240
If only anyone could have potentially saw this coming three years ago, although I saw

08:37.240 --> 08:39.920
that eye roll, I can say.

08:39.920 --> 08:47.200
So we'll see what happens, because it could be that they're just replacing with the Xbox

08:47.200 --> 08:49.920
this Game Pass thing, so it would be pretty cool.

08:49.920 --> 08:54.600
Because if that's the case, then it's kind of like, whereas they were giving away one

08:54.600 --> 08:59.200
or two free games a month or whatever, now you're getting like 100 games total.

08:59.200 --> 09:03.200
They're going to be rolling new titles into it each month.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.840
It's going to be interesting to see what they do with that.

09:05.840 --> 09:11.040
I know that's why they're kind of keeping their cards close to their chest, because

09:11.040 --> 09:16.360
they don't want Sony to kind of react with their PlayStation Now, although let's be honest

09:16.360 --> 09:21.040
with you, PlayStation Now, I don't really care for it too much.

09:21.040 --> 09:25.320
Definitely the Game Pass is a lot more appealing to me.

09:25.320 --> 09:27.840
So I'm curious to see what they announce.

09:27.840 --> 09:28.840
Yeah.

09:28.840 --> 09:33.360
S2100 Matt in chat says, Rob is going to pull that lever that has the banner that says,

09:33.360 --> 09:34.440
I was right.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.360
He's been waiting to pull that for three years.

09:36.360 --> 09:41.160
Yeah, it's just going to be a bunch of dust and balloon particles that fall from the ceiling

09:41.160 --> 09:42.160
when that happens.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.320
No, here's the thing.

09:43.320 --> 09:44.320
Okay.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.000
So I have like two mindsets about this.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.840
There is that part of me that still kind of is convinced that Microsoft may be doing this.

09:50.840 --> 09:54.400
And for those of you that are newer to OLR and don't know what I'm talking about, I said

09:54.400 --> 09:58.960
in one of the year prediction segments, beginning of the year things about three years ago,

09:58.960 --> 10:04.200
I said, Microsoft is going to go big and they're going to do something really shocking because

10:04.200 --> 10:08.460
they were, they're still feeling a little sore from when they got slapped in the face

10:08.460 --> 10:14.240
by Sony at E3 all those years ago when the PlayStation 4 was first revealed and they

10:14.240 --> 10:16.320
really sucker punched the Xbox One.

10:16.320 --> 10:21.020
And so Microsoft is just waiting to sucker punch Sony and say, well, we're going to get

10:21.020 --> 10:22.720
rid of the price to pay online.

10:22.720 --> 10:28.200
And I've kind of given these reasons for it is that Xbox, PC, they're trying to come closer

10:28.200 --> 10:30.000
together into one environment.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.680
And isn't it really weird that if I have no man's sky on PC, I don't have to pay to play

10:35.680 --> 10:36.680
online.

10:36.680 --> 10:41.000
But if I have it on my on Microsoft Xbox, I do have to pay to play it online, even though

10:41.000 --> 10:42.660
we have cross platform now.

10:42.660 --> 10:44.660
Like, aren't those types of things weird?

10:44.660 --> 10:48.980
So yeah, so what I could definitely see them doing to keep parity with the PC side is just

10:48.980 --> 10:55.740
charge for games pass and the X cloud service and then do Xbox live for free, basically.

10:55.740 --> 10:58.460
Well, okay, so I'm still I'm still a couple couple mindsets.

10:58.460 --> 10:59.460
Yeah, exactly.

10:59.460 --> 11:03.700
Is that I think they could still make Xbox live free and go that way.

11:03.700 --> 11:06.900
And that would be a huge shocker in the industry.

11:06.900 --> 11:11.220
And you know, the only the thing I would have gotten wrong was that I would have predicted

11:11.220 --> 11:17.500
Microsoft to do it mid cycle for Xbox one to get the leg up on PlayStation.

11:17.500 --> 11:21.780
What I would have gotten wrong is that they've been saving it to do it at the start of a

11:21.780 --> 11:26.700
new cycle to really get the jump on the PlayStation five.

11:26.700 --> 11:29.580
And you know, kind of looking back hindsight's 2020.

11:29.580 --> 11:33.380
You think about this news about Microsoft positioning all these chess pieces and interesting

11:33.380 --> 11:34.940
places and so forth.

11:34.940 --> 11:40.900
They've been setting up to go big with Xbox Series X for years.

11:40.900 --> 11:47.940
So if they do end up sucker punching Sony and saying, guess what, online is now free,

11:47.940 --> 11:52.060
then that's going to be, you know, a huge, a huge thing.

11:52.060 --> 11:58.420
And it's going to be a huge plus in Microsoft's hat, especially when rumor is this big rumor.

11:58.420 --> 12:02.900
But a lot of, you know, even like investor articles online are saying that you can expect

12:02.900 --> 12:06.100
that Microsoft's console is going to cost less than Sony's console.

12:06.100 --> 12:09.300
So all those things are going to add up to something very, very, very interesting.

12:09.300 --> 12:14.340
Now, all that being said about the whole, why I might be right camp, there is still

12:14.340 --> 12:18.820
that critical, you know, having watched this industry for years and years and doing this

12:18.820 --> 12:22.780
show, there's that other side of me, it's a little more realistic that thinks this is

12:22.780 --> 12:29.220
more of a branding type of thing is that it's too confusing to have game pass ultimate,

12:29.220 --> 12:36.380
an X cloud pass and games with gold, all these separate, you know, tickets that are separate.

12:36.380 --> 12:37.380
It's too much to keep track of.

12:37.380 --> 12:43.960
Now granted, Loki just said, they just announced this week that X cloud and game pass ultimate

12:43.960 --> 12:45.060
are going to be tied together.

12:45.060 --> 12:47.700
So you're not going to have to worry about like, what is it?

12:47.700 --> 12:54.460
But isn't it interesting that they didn't say Xbox gold is that too?

12:54.460 --> 13:00.660
So that almost makes me wonder, it kind of goes back to, oh, maybe I'm right again, because

13:00.660 --> 13:02.580
they didn't call that out.

13:02.580 --> 13:04.940
And why wouldn't they have if that's the direction they're going?

13:04.940 --> 13:08.580
I don't think though, that they're just rebranding it, because if that was the case, and they

13:08.580 --> 13:11.540
would just still have the subscription up, they would just say, Okay, well, after this

13:11.540 --> 13:14.300
date, we're just calling it something different.

13:14.300 --> 13:18.260
I think that they're just changing up how they actually, you know, sell it.

13:18.260 --> 13:26.100
So I guess I don't know what's going to happen if I mean, I guess if you purchase so many

13:26.100 --> 13:31.700
years of Xbox Live gold, maybe they'll just convert that over into games pass or something

13:31.700 --> 13:32.700
like that.

13:32.700 --> 13:38.260
Um, yeah, we'll wait until Thursday this week.

13:38.260 --> 13:39.260
Dark soccer.

13:39.260 --> 13:40.260
Let me pick on you for a minute here.

13:40.260 --> 13:41.260
We'll not pick on you.

13:41.260 --> 13:45.900
But I want your opinion from somebody who specifically is probably not really a Microsoft

13:45.900 --> 13:46.900
person.

13:46.900 --> 13:48.940
Like, I don't think you and Dan even have an I don't remember Do you guys even have

13:48.940 --> 13:49.940
an Xbox?

13:49.940 --> 13:50.940
I don't think you do.

13:50.940 --> 13:52.940
Since Xbox 360.

13:52.940 --> 13:53.940
Okay.

13:53.940 --> 13:54.940
Okay.

13:54.940 --> 14:00.860
So you've been in Microsoft's camp before, but it would be fair to say of Sony, Nintendo

14:00.860 --> 14:04.580
and Microsoft, Microsoft's getting the least amount in your house, right?

14:04.580 --> 14:05.580
Yeah.

14:05.580 --> 14:06.580
Okay.

14:06.580 --> 14:08.220
It doesn't, we don't feel too much love for it.

14:08.220 --> 14:10.500
And I would imagine a lot of that is the games, right?

14:10.500 --> 14:14.020
It's just not the, you know, you've made your feelings on Halo known on this show before

14:14.020 --> 14:15.020
and so forth.

14:15.020 --> 14:18.380
It's not the games are not tickling your fancy, so to speak.

14:18.380 --> 14:21.220
Nothing interesting enough yet to really make it worth it to me, right?

14:21.220 --> 14:26.580
So I mean, I feel like dark soccer is the type of gamer that Microsoft like Phil Spencer

14:26.580 --> 14:30.340
sees dark soccer and goes, that's who I need to bring back to Microsoft.

14:30.340 --> 14:35.020
So that being said, when I talk about this potential that, oh, Microsoft might get rid

14:35.020 --> 14:36.820
of the fee to pay online.

14:36.820 --> 14:37.820
Does that excite you at all?

14:37.820 --> 14:40.060
Or is it just kind of like a no, no, no.

14:40.060 --> 14:41.060
Okay.

14:41.060 --> 14:42.060
No.

14:42.060 --> 14:44.060
Show me the games.

14:44.060 --> 14:45.060
Fair enough.

14:45.060 --> 14:46.060
I don't care if they're free.

14:46.060 --> 14:47.060
I want good games.

14:47.060 --> 14:48.060
Fair enough.

14:48.060 --> 14:49.360
No, that's, that's excellent point.

14:49.360 --> 14:51.060
It's just, it's really about the games.

14:51.060 --> 14:52.060
So okay.

14:52.060 --> 14:56.860
And, and all this new, you know, well granted, everything is really speculation and the little

14:56.860 --> 15:02.580
news that's come out was not in the context of a press conference or direct or anything.

15:02.580 --> 15:06.500
It's just, you know, kind of a leaking, I don't want to say leaking, but like comments

15:06.500 --> 15:10.700
to game journalists, blogs, and things like that, a Twitter posts.

15:10.700 --> 15:12.780
And that's where a lot of this is coming out right now.

15:12.780 --> 15:19.500
So you know, to, to your credit and that point, dark soccer, July 23rd, here comes the games.

15:19.500 --> 15:23.620
So I'm really interested to hear your take on what happens after this week.

15:23.620 --> 15:27.900
And if anything comes out of, out of that, where you go, Ooh, we'll see.

15:27.900 --> 15:33.700
The other thing too, is why am I going to buy a system when I've, I, me playing the

15:33.700 --> 15:39.340
last of us is the first time I've touched my PS4 since last year, except to dust it

15:39.340 --> 15:41.740
a couple of times.

15:41.740 --> 15:48.220
So it's, if I haven't been touching that and I really like the system, what makes me going

15:48.220 --> 15:53.820
to touch, uh, uh, get an Xbox one just to do, you know, I don't, I'm going to pay money

15:53.820 --> 15:57.180
to do something that I'm probably just going to let sit there anyway and not care about.

15:57.180 --> 16:01.620
So, well, and the fact that you do a lot of gaming on PC, Mac computers, you're using

16:01.620 --> 16:06.720
computers in place of concerts, switch a lot lately.

16:06.720 --> 16:12.660
The only gaming I've really done on, on any, uh, computer has been on my Mac and it's been,

16:12.660 --> 16:17.620
I mean, just my puzzle games and a few, uh, a few like typography based games and stuff

16:17.620 --> 16:18.620
on Apple arcade, really.

16:18.620 --> 16:24.240
Um, although, yeah, I've been mentioning, I am going to stream, um, for charity once

16:24.240 --> 16:27.120
I get, you know, everything put together from the house.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.380
So I voted for the game that didn't win.

16:29.380 --> 16:31.620
I voted for Colonel Sanders.

16:31.620 --> 16:32.620
Didn't win.

16:32.620 --> 16:38.700
I had to do a new poll because dream daddy and how to full boyfriend tied.

16:38.700 --> 16:40.460
I also voted for Colonel Sanders.

16:40.460 --> 16:42.380
So yeah.

16:42.380 --> 16:43.380
Fuck my drag.

16:43.380 --> 16:44.380
Right.

16:44.380 --> 16:45.380
All right.

16:45.380 --> 16:46.380
Okay.

16:46.380 --> 16:51.460
Mayhem, uh, hype mayhem and chat says, uh, I think that was a Kennedy Davenport line

16:51.460 --> 16:52.460
too.

16:52.460 --> 16:57.100
Uh, hype mayhem says, even when I was strictly a con Bobby voted for Colonel Sanders to all

16:57.100 --> 17:01.700
the VOG people voted for Colonel Sanders, uh, hype mayhem says, uh, even when I was

17:01.700 --> 17:06.700
strictly a console gamer, the three 60 was my secondary console.

17:06.700 --> 17:11.220
PC is my main thing right now, although I do fire up my three 60 every now and then

17:11.220 --> 17:19.060
I'm very curious to see on the 23rd, how much PC is a win for Microsoft.

17:19.060 --> 17:23.380
And what I mean by that is, is the emphasis, is there going to be, how much emphasis is

17:23.380 --> 17:24.920
there going to be on Xbox series X?

17:24.920 --> 17:27.680
We know we're not getting the system where no, we're not getting the date.

17:27.680 --> 17:34.860
So is, I'm curious to see how many times the messages reiterated coming to PC and Xbox,

17:34.860 --> 17:38.420
or this is something you can play on PC and let's be real, it's Microsoft.

17:38.420 --> 17:39.420
So they're going to say windows.

17:39.420 --> 17:41.020
This would be a lot of windows 10.

17:41.020 --> 17:42.020
It's a windows 10 game.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.020
Cause it's Microsoft.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.020
That's what they're going to do.

17:44.020 --> 17:47.780
So, um, I know, but so let's be real.

17:47.780 --> 17:48.780
That's what they're going to do.

17:48.780 --> 17:49.780
But go ahead.

17:49.780 --> 17:55.060
So here's what I don't understand about X-cloud so I, and this is just my not doing any research

17:55.060 --> 17:56.060
on it.

17:56.060 --> 18:02.180
Um, so X-cloud is that streaming from your Xbox to your phone or is that like, say just

18:02.180 --> 18:05.940
any other game streaming service where it's just from the cloud to you, whatever device

18:05.940 --> 18:10.340
that you want to stream to, because if it doesn't require a console, I would love to

18:10.340 --> 18:16.300
have X-cloud support for my PC to be able to play these games that I don't have a console

18:16.300 --> 18:17.300
for.

18:17.300 --> 18:18.300
Great question.

18:18.300 --> 18:21.060
And one I'm hoping we get more clarity on, uh, on the 23rd.

18:21.060 --> 18:23.940
Cause I think the branding with X-cloud is kind of confusing.

18:23.940 --> 18:27.860
I think the fact that we don't have a definitive, like this is the answer to that.

18:27.860 --> 18:32.840
Um, and I'm sure you guys in chat, you know, and as far as I know, the project X-cloud

18:32.840 --> 18:39.040
that's been tested is your Xbox streaming to your device, uh, like a phone or something

18:39.040 --> 18:40.040
like that.

18:40.040 --> 18:43.520
Or even, I suppose your PC, which is something you've been able to do for a long time, really

18:43.520 --> 18:45.680
a stream your Xbox one to your PC.

18:45.680 --> 18:51.240
But I do think that's a message that Microsoft could stand to kind of clarify a little bit,

18:51.240 --> 18:52.680
like what is X-cloud?

18:52.680 --> 18:57.820
Is it, is it gaming from the cloud to your Xbox or is it, is it all of it?

18:57.820 --> 18:59.280
Like what's the difference?

18:59.280 --> 19:00.520
How does one work versus another?

19:00.520 --> 19:05.500
And I, I kind of think, I think there's going to be a lot when it comes to like branding

19:05.500 --> 19:08.220
and how they show that off, that's going to be important.

19:08.220 --> 19:11.660
And I know a lot of you, again, a lot of you guys are probably sitting there ready to explain

19:11.660 --> 19:13.840
it to me in technical fashion, how it all works.

19:13.840 --> 19:15.160
And I get that.

19:15.160 --> 19:18.440
But remember, we got to explain this to the average consumer.

19:18.440 --> 19:23.880
We got to explain this to the parent that's shopping for the household or hell the college

19:23.880 --> 19:28.280
kid that's buying their home console or whatever it is, you know, it's gotta be explaining

19:28.280 --> 19:32.700
it a little more to that audience, especially around the holiday season.

19:32.700 --> 19:36.920
Explain to grandma why this, this, why Microsoft X-cloud makes it better than so.

19:36.920 --> 19:41.160
So to clarify, so according to the actual official page is that, and this is just for

19:41.160 --> 19:44.600
the test, this test streaming console quality tiles from the cloud.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.600
No waiting for downloads.

19:45.600 --> 19:49.280
During the preview, you don't need to own games or console.

19:49.280 --> 19:53.940
So it is right now streaming just from the cloud, not from a console.

19:53.940 --> 19:55.640
I'm curious if it's going to stay that way.

19:55.640 --> 19:56.640
I didn't even know.

19:57.400 --> 20:03.480
I mean, sorry, it's either way for like other thing, everything else out of, you know, the

20:03.480 --> 20:04.920
games pass stuff.

20:04.920 --> 20:08.880
It says a lot that I was convinced it was your console to your phone.

20:08.880 --> 20:12.440
And I swear that's something they've also been testing and fine.

20:12.440 --> 20:15.840
I'm, I'm happy to be wrong because it just proves my point.

20:15.840 --> 20:21.360
Like we kind of need clarity on what is it and how does it work and how easy is it going

20:21.360 --> 20:23.800
to be, you know, in that whole thing.

20:23.800 --> 20:24.800
Yeah.

20:24.960 --> 20:25.960
Yeah.

20:25.960 --> 20:26.960
So.

20:26.960 --> 20:27.960
All right.

20:27.960 --> 20:33.120
S2100 Matt says there is a Reddit thread where people ask folks to explain certain things

20:33.120 --> 20:34.200
like they're 12.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.200
I thought it was five.

20:35.200 --> 20:38.160
Isn't there a subreddit ELI five or something like that?

20:38.160 --> 20:39.160
Yeah.

20:39.160 --> 20:40.880
So, well, there's probably a 12 year old one too.

20:40.880 --> 20:44.620
The way you'd word things to a 12 year old and the five year old are a little different,

20:44.620 --> 20:45.620
but still.

20:45.620 --> 20:46.620
Yeah.

20:46.620 --> 20:50.320
That's, that's, that's what, that's what Microsoft needs to do with xCloud.

20:50.320 --> 20:51.960
ELI 12.

20:51.960 --> 20:52.960
That's what it is.

20:53.120 --> 20:54.120
So.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.120
All right.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.120
Anyway.

20:56.120 --> 21:01.360
Um, Loki, are you, are you getting hyped about this event?

21:01.360 --> 21:05.720
Are you kind of lukewarm on Microsoft game information?

21:05.720 --> 21:12.480
So yes, of course I got to say I'm, I love Sony and I love PlayStation five.

21:12.480 --> 21:17.500
I almost am more excited about Microsoft this time around and I think it has something to

21:17.500 --> 21:20.580
do with their underdog status.

21:20.580 --> 21:24.380
You know, the reality is y'all, I love games so much.

21:24.380 --> 21:26.020
I'm going to buy both.

21:26.020 --> 21:27.020
I'm going to buy both.

21:27.020 --> 21:29.820
Um, and that's just the way it is.

21:29.820 --> 21:34.820
But uh, I, there, there's a certain like underdog element and you know, this is, this is Phil

21:34.820 --> 21:39.900
Spencer's time as opposed to, you know, Don Matrick who kind of screwed the Xbox one right

21:39.900 --> 21:40.900
out the gate.

21:40.900 --> 21:45.420
Like I, I'm really just excited to see like what it is and how they're going to get that

21:45.420 --> 21:46.420
messaging across.

21:46.420 --> 21:49.860
And I'm, I'm kind of really excited about it to be honest.

21:50.140 --> 21:53.540
I still don't know what their exclusives are though between the different platforms.

21:53.540 --> 21:58.100
So that's why right now I like having a hard time making decisions because like, I don't

21:58.100 --> 21:59.100
know what they're offering.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.180
Like they keep saying, Oh, our hardware is more powerful.

22:01.180 --> 22:03.020
I mean, every company is going to say that.

22:03.020 --> 22:08.260
So like I need to see what the games are and I, I'm not clear, like especially after that

22:08.260 --> 22:13.500
last event that Sony had, like I'm not clear what games they're offering, it was all third

22:13.500 --> 22:14.500
party stuff.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.940
And like, yeah, Assassin's Creed is going to be on both platforms and I don't care about

22:17.940 --> 22:19.100
that game anyways.

22:19.100 --> 22:25.980
Um, I just don't know third party wise, like I, I would lean a little bit towards Sony

22:25.980 --> 22:31.900
just because I have a huge library of stuff on there, but I mean, with Game Pass, it doesn't

22:31.900 --> 22:32.900
matter anyway.

22:32.900 --> 22:37.420
So like, I have to see, I have to see what they have to offer like exclusive wise.

22:37.420 --> 22:41.420
Cause that's really kind of what drives me to one console or the other.

22:41.420 --> 22:45.660
If Sony would really go big on the backwards compatibility thing, I would be so happy.

22:45.660 --> 22:49.460
And I know people are like, why do you need a new console to play old games?

22:49.460 --> 22:51.700
Because I ran out of shelf space for the old consoles.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.460
The old consoles get dusty and die.

22:53.460 --> 22:56.780
I don't even know where the fricking cords are for my old consoles at some point.

22:56.780 --> 22:59.020
Like it's kind of nice to have it all in one.

22:59.020 --> 23:02.220
And I gotta be honest, if Sony does open up and say, guess what?

23:02.220 --> 23:05.500
All those PlayStation two and three and one games that have been sitting on your shelf,

23:05.500 --> 23:06.700
now they have value again.

23:06.700 --> 23:07.700
You can play them on your phone.

23:07.700 --> 23:09.740
I'll be so excited to be honest.

23:09.740 --> 23:10.740
So we'll see.

23:10.740 --> 23:11.740
We'll see.

23:11.740 --> 23:15.140
Especially when Matt says we won't notice a difference between a console power for a

23:15.140 --> 23:16.140
few years.

23:16.140 --> 23:19.220
And by then studios will be able to use the console to its full potential.

23:19.220 --> 23:22.620
We're never going to know which console is better anyways, because what's going to happen,

23:22.620 --> 23:27.420
especially when it comes to mainline games that are multi-platform, they're going to

23:27.420 --> 23:29.100
keep them in parity with each other.

23:29.100 --> 23:32.100
You're not going to have one that's like vastly different than the other one.

23:32.100 --> 23:35.500
It's going to be first party titles that would be showing that stuff off.

23:35.500 --> 23:39.340
And honestly, I don't think it's going to be like night and day between these different

23:39.340 --> 23:40.340
consoles.

23:40.340 --> 23:45.380
I don't think it's just all hype and, you know, advertised speak.

23:45.380 --> 23:50.420
I think that's a very important point is that technical power does not mean what it used

23:50.420 --> 23:51.500
to mean.

23:51.500 --> 23:55.600
Case in point, Nintendo, I rest my case.

23:55.600 --> 24:00.220
Like Nintendo has the weakest console out there from a technological, although some

24:00.220 --> 24:04.540
would argue the technological marvel of the dock and take it off the dock is a pretty

24:04.540 --> 24:07.640
big feather in the hat, but you guys know what I mean, right?

24:07.640 --> 24:10.720
Basically the switch is going to be the least powerful thing on the market, but does it

24:10.720 --> 24:11.720
matter?

24:11.720 --> 24:15.540
No, it absolutely doesn't matter because they have animal crossing.

24:15.540 --> 24:18.320
They have a Metroid game coming out in the future.

24:18.320 --> 24:22.860
They likely are doing another Mario game this holiday of some form or another.

24:22.860 --> 24:23.960
It's not going to matter.

24:23.960 --> 24:29.840
So like, you know, whereas back in the day when it was, you know, super Nintendo or Nintendo

24:29.840 --> 24:34.920
64 on a cartridge versus PlayStation on a disc versus Dreamcast, you know, all the,

24:34.920 --> 24:39.840
all this stuff going on, like the technological end of it doesn't matter anymore.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.480
If that makes sense.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.840
So yeah, that makes sense.

24:44.840 --> 24:51.240
Phoenix 7726 in chat says, Rob, power has never meant the same thing to Nintendo, even

24:51.240 --> 24:53.680
when they are on the edge during the GameCube era.

24:53.680 --> 24:55.840
Yeah, that's a brilliant point.

24:55.840 --> 25:00.280
The GameCube was probably the closest they ever got to kind of being on par with the

25:00.280 --> 25:02.880
other consoles that were available at the time.

25:02.880 --> 25:07.960
But even then they, their online was so weak compared to the competition.

25:07.960 --> 25:11.560
The thing that's going to hurt them though, power wise, I mean, I get it, the Switch is

25:11.560 --> 25:12.800
an okay system.

25:12.800 --> 25:18.720
It's just that when you're looking at third party titles, you're going to have, the Switch

25:18.720 --> 25:22.080
is not going to be able to run a lot of these modern engines on it.

25:22.080 --> 25:26.760
It's not without them massively altering those games.

25:26.760 --> 25:31.020
That's why you see a lot of these older games being ported to the Switch, which is fine.

25:31.020 --> 25:35.700
But you're not going to see Cyberpunk running on the Switch or something like that.

25:35.700 --> 25:39.700
It's going to be very much separate in that sense.

25:39.700 --> 25:41.900
Same with Madden or anything like that.

25:41.900 --> 25:45.740
These next gen Madden games, they're going to have, it all is going to be porting that

25:45.740 --> 25:51.460
old version of Madden onto the Switch over and over and over again with a roster update.

25:51.460 --> 25:57.140
Counterpoint though, because Microsoft is still developing for the Xbox One.

25:57.140 --> 25:59.780
Everything that is being developed is going to run on the Xbox One.

25:59.780 --> 26:05.380
So that being said, it's not going to be as difficult, I mean, I say that like I have

26:05.380 --> 26:09.740
any technical knowledge of programming a game whatsoever, but I think that bridge would

26:09.740 --> 26:14.780
be a lot less strenuous to cross from Xbox One to Switch than it would be from PlayStation

26:14.780 --> 26:16.340
5 and Xbox Series X.

26:16.340 --> 26:20.920
And we know for a couple of years, Microsoft is still going to be supporting Xbox One.

26:20.920 --> 26:23.740
Third party could be a different story, I understand that.

26:23.740 --> 26:29.740
But I think that bridge is not as monumental as it might have felt before, especially with

26:29.740 --> 26:32.060
the way the Switch is sold.

26:32.060 --> 26:35.980
It's motivating third party developers to kind of keep it in mind when they develop.

26:35.980 --> 26:41.140
Now in a couple years when Microsoft finally decides to leave the Xbox One behind, I think

26:41.140 --> 26:45.620
that's when the conversations will start really about what is the Switch's successor, which

26:45.620 --> 26:48.260
I full on just expect to be a Switch 2.0.

26:48.260 --> 26:53.460
I don't see Nintendo leaving this formula behind at all, like it's going to be another

26:53.460 --> 27:00.500
portable and a desktop, I don't know, a living room system, Nintendo's not going to leave

27:00.500 --> 27:01.500
that behind.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.300
It's been too damn successful this time around.

27:03.300 --> 27:04.300
So.

27:04.300 --> 27:05.300
Yeah.

27:05.300 --> 27:06.300
All right.

27:06.300 --> 27:12.180
I just, I think there's just a lot of even stuff with the current generation of consoles

27:12.180 --> 27:16.100
that doesn't come to the Switch because it can't run that stuff.

27:16.100 --> 27:19.380
Although now it's going to be running Crysis, so I guess anything's possible.

27:19.700 --> 27:23.540
S2-100 Matt in chat says, Loki going after sports games again.

27:23.540 --> 27:24.580
But he's right.

27:24.580 --> 27:30.220
The last year or two of sports games on an expiring consoles are just really sad ports.

27:30.220 --> 27:32.740
That's what they've been the last few years already on the Switch.

27:32.740 --> 27:33.740
Nothing's going to change.

27:33.740 --> 27:34.740
Nothing.

27:34.740 --> 27:38.220
All of a sudden them making a brand new engine that runs on next generation of consoles doesn't

27:38.220 --> 27:40.300
mean all of a sudden they're going to port it to.

27:40.300 --> 27:41.300
It's not going to happen.

27:41.300 --> 27:45.020
But that's up to the third parties to do better in some regard too, because Nintendo is doing

27:45.020 --> 27:46.020
great.

27:46.020 --> 27:47.020
All right.

27:47.020 --> 27:48.340
Anyway, let's move on.

27:48.340 --> 27:50.820
Let's talk about the types of games we've been playing this week, whether it's been

27:50.820 --> 27:54.860
on our Switch, our computer, our Xbox, PlayStation, whatever.

27:54.860 --> 27:55.860
How was your gaming week?

27:55.860 --> 27:57.260
And we'll start with Dark Sakura.

27:57.260 --> 27:59.820
How was your gaming week?

27:59.820 --> 28:00.820
It was all right.

28:00.820 --> 28:04.300
I played a lot of Animal Crossing.

28:04.300 --> 28:07.300
Dan's been playing Bloodstained.

28:07.300 --> 28:13.140
He's actually been playing both Curse of the Moon 2 and then the regular Bloodstained.

28:13.140 --> 28:16.180
I've been playing this stupid game that I'm kind of hooked on.

28:16.180 --> 28:20.420
And it's one of those like free with ads stupid games, but the ads aren't very long on it.

28:20.420 --> 28:25.380
And it's if people can see, it looks like it's like this where you have you get like

28:25.380 --> 28:26.380
letters.

28:26.380 --> 28:27.380
Okay.

28:27.380 --> 28:31.420
For the podcast, folks, it looks like a word for words with friends, but with a spinny

28:31.420 --> 28:32.420
dial thing.

28:32.420 --> 28:35.500
It's the word wheel mode from words with friends is what it is.

28:35.500 --> 28:36.500
Okay.

28:36.500 --> 28:40.020
And so, of course, you know, you have to build the words on it.

28:40.020 --> 28:43.660
And me, like on this one, I've guessed three of the words on the puzzle and I've done thirty

28:43.660 --> 28:45.540
three other words.

28:45.540 --> 28:50.860
The last one I did was like nine words and I guessed seventy.

28:50.860 --> 28:52.420
So yeah.

28:52.420 --> 28:53.420
And they were all real words.

28:53.420 --> 28:58.380
So I'm like, yeah, this game isn't for people who actually have a vocabulary.

28:58.380 --> 28:59.380
It's been pretty fun.

28:59.380 --> 29:03.860
I'm still playing words with friends and I haven't really gotten to much of The Last

29:03.860 --> 29:06.580
of Us this week just because other things are going on.

29:06.580 --> 29:14.020
But I this upcoming week isn't going to be much better because I get my new desk and

29:14.020 --> 29:15.940
I have to set up my office and everything.

29:15.940 --> 29:23.140
So this all of this behind me is going to be different, hopefully the next time I'm

29:23.140 --> 29:25.140
on the show.

29:25.140 --> 29:26.140
Awesome.

29:26.140 --> 29:28.940
But in other news, next week is my last half show.

29:28.940 --> 29:33.900
I go back to my old schedule and you get me for a full show.

29:33.900 --> 29:38.580
I'm glad the warden's giving you a pardon so we can have y'all show.

29:38.580 --> 29:39.580
Good to know.

29:39.580 --> 29:42.420
I don't know how I feel about closing again, though.

29:42.420 --> 29:47.220
I've kind of gotten used to my quiet six a.m., but it is what it is.

29:47.220 --> 29:48.220
Yeah.

29:48.220 --> 29:49.220
You'll do fine.

29:49.220 --> 29:50.220
All right.

29:50.220 --> 29:54.460
Well, if that's it for your gaming week, we'll move to Loki, who clearly Minecraft was part

29:54.460 --> 29:55.460
of his week.

29:55.460 --> 29:56.460
Yes.

29:56.460 --> 29:57.860
I'm always playing Minecraft.

29:57.860 --> 30:01.140
So I played lots of Minecraft.

30:01.140 --> 30:03.660
And aside from that, Orna.

30:03.660 --> 30:10.860
And then also I did finally get the switch to play a little bit of Paper Mario, the Origami

30:10.860 --> 30:11.860
King.

30:12.300 --> 30:13.300
So that was pretty awesome.

30:13.300 --> 30:15.100
I'm enjoying that quite a bit.

30:15.100 --> 30:18.540
So just not too far into it.

30:18.540 --> 30:22.620
I'm not too like the first big boss yet, but I played like three hours of it.

30:22.620 --> 30:23.620
That's pretty good.

30:25.620 --> 30:26.620
So that's pretty much it.

30:26.620 --> 30:27.620
OK.

30:27.620 --> 30:28.620
All right.

30:28.620 --> 30:29.620
My gaming week.

30:29.620 --> 30:30.620
I have a lot to talk about, actually.

30:30.620 --> 30:33.180
So there's all the usuals, right?

30:33.180 --> 30:34.820
Like, you know, Pokemon Go.

30:34.820 --> 30:39.340
I got like 11 shinies during community day catching for my Bluetooth, you know, whatever.

30:39.340 --> 30:41.340
But I got a 100 percent Gastly.

30:41.340 --> 30:45.740
And those are more exciting to me when you get a perfect 100 percent because they give

30:45.740 --> 30:48.300
out shinies like candy on community day, I swear.

30:48.300 --> 30:49.380
But yeah.

30:49.380 --> 30:51.300
So I participated in that Gomi.

30:51.300 --> 30:53.580
I'm still playing Orna a bit.

30:53.580 --> 30:56.660
And this was a week where I was kind of like, I'm going to tackle some games that have just

30:56.660 --> 31:01.700
been sitting in my backlog or, you know, just play something random on Xbox Game Pass.

31:01.700 --> 31:03.580
So I played on Xbox Game Pass.

31:03.580 --> 31:06.280
They just added a game called Forager.

31:06.280 --> 31:09.900
And Loki, this might be something that's up your alley because it is very Minecrafty,

31:09.900 --> 31:12.300
especially when it comes to the crafting in the game.

31:12.300 --> 31:18.420
But the graphics look a little more like honestly to me, they're almost like a Binding of Isaac

31:18.420 --> 31:21.360
style graphics, although the game is nothing like Binding of Isaac.

31:21.360 --> 31:25.180
It's more Minecraft, but it's 2D.

31:25.180 --> 31:28.380
And you know, you're going around, you mind these different things.

31:28.380 --> 31:33.940
You have things that you build like a forage and you do other things like a thread, a loom,

31:33.940 --> 31:34.940
things like that.

31:34.940 --> 31:39.640
You're kind of crafting and then you expand your land through money and you're crafting

31:39.640 --> 31:41.140
money as well.

31:41.140 --> 31:44.120
And so it's an interesting kind of 2D Minecraft.

31:44.120 --> 31:46.400
We've seen these types of games before.

31:46.400 --> 31:52.000
Maybe Don't Starve would be another good comparison, although I feel like Forager was like really,

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
really dumbed down.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.300
And that's a good thing.

31:54.300 --> 31:57.260
I think that's an okay thing to be sometimes.

31:57.260 --> 31:59.540
Sometimes being a simpler game gives you an edge.

31:59.540 --> 32:01.260
That's why I love Heroes of the Storm.

32:01.260 --> 32:05.660
It's like League of Legends, but it's dumbed down and that's not a bad thing.

32:05.660 --> 32:08.620
So Forager is pretty cool in that regard.

32:09.620 --> 32:13.200
I wish it had a little bit more robust of a tutorial.

32:13.200 --> 32:18.440
Like sometimes the little dude will tell you like what to do, but I was kind of having

32:18.440 --> 32:22.540
a hard time figuring out like, am I doing this the right way?

32:22.540 --> 32:25.600
Am I eating the right things I'm supposed to be eating?

32:25.600 --> 32:28.680
Because this seems very difficult and I'm running out of life very often.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.840
I guess maybe I need to build more fish traps.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.280
I don't know.

32:32.280 --> 32:35.560
That type of discovery might be a plus for some people, though.

32:35.620 --> 32:38.740
I like to be handheld just a little bit more in the beginning of the game.

32:38.740 --> 32:42.220
But that's really just my it's a minor piece of feedback, all things considered.

32:42.220 --> 32:43.940
I think the game is fun.

32:43.940 --> 32:44.940
It's interesting.

32:44.940 --> 32:48.860
And I feel like it moves at a faster pace than Minecraft, too, which I kind of like.

32:48.860 --> 32:52.380
So yeah, that's cool.

32:52.380 --> 32:57.420
Some other games I've been playing, Epic Games Store, I'm like, you know, I've been collecting

32:57.420 --> 32:58.860
all these free games.

32:58.860 --> 33:00.900
I'm going to play some free games.

33:00.900 --> 33:05.540
So I played one called Lifeless Planet that I think came out a couple or excuse me, was

33:05.540 --> 33:07.440
a free game a couple weeks ago.

33:07.440 --> 33:11.880
I think the game itself dates back to like 2014 or something like that.

33:11.880 --> 33:15.120
And I thought it might be kind of like a No Man's Sky type of game, because that was the

33:15.120 --> 33:17.880
vibe that a lot of the screenshots were giving me.

33:17.880 --> 33:20.460
It's not quite that open world.

33:20.460 --> 33:22.880
It's a little more platformy.

33:22.880 --> 33:27.160
I would almost call it a little bit more like an old school Tomb Raider type of thing is

33:27.160 --> 33:30.400
honestly how it kind of felt to me with some of the puzzles where it's like, oh, I got

33:30.400 --> 33:35.080
to take a ball and roll the ball over to this cliff so I can jump on the ball and jet pack

33:35.080 --> 33:36.780
up here and do these types of things.

33:36.780 --> 33:39.620
It has kind of an interesting story to it too.

33:39.620 --> 33:41.500
It was okay.

33:41.500 --> 33:45.100
I thought the game kind of wasn't what I expected it would be.

33:45.100 --> 33:48.880
Like I thought a game like Lifeless Planet would be very much about exploration and kind

33:48.880 --> 33:50.300
of open worldness.

33:50.300 --> 33:52.000
And that's not really what this is at all.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.140
But that doesn't make it bad.

33:53.140 --> 33:55.160
It's just it wasn't what I expected.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.160
So there you go.

33:56.160 --> 33:59.440
Now you can set your expectations appropriately if you ever play this game, which I got on

33:59.440 --> 34:00.980
Epic Games Store a while ago.

34:00.980 --> 34:04.120
And it's, you know, again, many of you guys probably picked it up for free.

34:04.120 --> 34:05.120
It's worth a look.

34:05.120 --> 34:06.120
It's pretty neat.

34:06.120 --> 34:08.060
I also played a game.

34:08.060 --> 34:10.600
Oh, everybody knows this game, Celeste.

34:10.600 --> 34:13.000
I finally got around to playing Celeste.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.920
Finally got around to playing Celeste this week.

34:15.920 --> 34:21.480
And because that was on Epic Games Store at some point that that game is hard as hell.

34:21.480 --> 34:23.560
My God.

34:23.560 --> 34:24.740
But it's it's fun.

34:24.740 --> 34:25.740
It's it.

34:25.740 --> 34:30.360
It it has like to me it has like a Super Meat Boy vibe kind of going with it.

34:30.360 --> 34:33.120
And that's kind of what it reminds me of closest.

34:33.120 --> 34:35.260
But the soundtrack's really good.

34:35.260 --> 34:39.520
And I like how I like it.

34:39.520 --> 34:40.520
I don't like it.

34:40.520 --> 34:41.520
I like it.

34:41.520 --> 34:44.880
How there's these like these little strawberries that very clearly are things you're supposed

34:44.880 --> 34:47.460
to be collecting that are like dangled in front of you.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.040
But they're hard as hell to get.

34:49.040 --> 34:52.840
And like I can get them sometimes, but other times, no, can't do it.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.560
And I just have to move on.

34:54.560 --> 34:55.560
And then sometimes there's choices.

34:55.560 --> 34:56.680
Do I go left or right?

34:56.680 --> 34:57.680
And I don't know.

34:57.680 --> 35:00.200
Like, I thought games like this only had one path.

35:00.200 --> 35:02.100
But no, there's there's multiple ways to get there.

35:02.100 --> 35:05.220
So that's kind of interesting where it's like a Super Meat Boy S type of game.

35:05.220 --> 35:07.820
But there's multiple ways to kind of get to the finish.

35:07.820 --> 35:11.300
So yeah, I thought that was interesting.

35:11.300 --> 35:13.580
Some comments in chat on these games.

35:13.580 --> 35:15.620
Act Def says Celeste is so awesome.

35:15.620 --> 35:17.680
It's hard, but it's so rewarding.

35:17.680 --> 35:19.540
And the story is great.

35:19.540 --> 35:22.620
And Pele Hanumeya talking about Lifeless Planet was interesting to play.

35:22.620 --> 35:23.620
Yeah, it's interesting.

35:23.620 --> 35:26.400
The story is kind of kind of not what I expected it to be at all.

35:26.400 --> 35:30.300
But it's very narrative, but it's good.

35:30.300 --> 35:31.300
And let's see.

35:31.500 --> 35:35.300
I think that's about like my newer games I was playing and catching up.

35:35.300 --> 35:41.600
Okay, so I mentioned on Twitter that like, I have found this new thing in one of my games

35:41.600 --> 35:45.000
that I play a lot that I really enjoy.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.420
Some of you might find it a little weird.

35:47.420 --> 35:51.300
And that's why I'm going to talk about it openly and publicly on this show that I do.

35:51.300 --> 35:56.600
So obviously, you guys know I play a lot of a game called Ingress, right?

35:56.600 --> 36:03.000
So something they just recently did in Ingress is they released something called portal scanning.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.360
And what portal scanning is, is quite simply all you're doing, you're taking like a, you

36:06.360 --> 36:12.120
take your camera, and you walk around like a portal basically where it is, and you're

36:12.120 --> 36:19.120
taking a 3D scan of that portal for Niantic's database to be used in some other game down

36:19.120 --> 36:20.120
the road.

36:20.120 --> 36:23.480
Now this same feature is in Pokemon Go.

36:23.480 --> 36:26.000
But it's, I think it's a little more, it's Pokestop scanning.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.840
I think it's a little more hidden, and they don't give you any rewards for it.

36:28.840 --> 36:31.100
There's like no reason to do it in Pokemon Go.

36:31.100 --> 36:34.680
So I doubt any of you are except maybe the curiosity factor.

36:34.680 --> 36:38.400
But in Ingress, they have some little badges, you know, little achievements that you can

36:38.400 --> 36:39.960
get from doing these things.

36:39.960 --> 36:43.120
And so that kind of motivated me to start taking a look, I was like, well, at least

36:43.120 --> 36:47.160
I can do this bronze level, you know, achievement and do this.

36:47.160 --> 36:51.080
And they ended so they did one badge for scanning portals.

36:51.080 --> 36:54.840
But then they released a second badge called scout controller.

36:54.840 --> 36:56.880
This is very different than Pokemon.

36:56.880 --> 37:03.920
And what scout controller is, is that scout controller is for uniques, basically, like,

37:03.920 --> 37:09.800
if you have more portal scans than anybody else on a portal, then you are the scout controller

37:09.800 --> 37:10.800
for 30 days.

37:10.800 --> 37:14.180
Now, if somebody comes and scans more than you, they'll take it away from you.

37:14.180 --> 37:17.600
But you've already stamped that as a unique scout controller claim.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.880
So it goes towards your badge.

37:19.880 --> 37:23.440
So this added up to and there's there's a point I'm getting to here.

37:23.440 --> 37:30.800
This added up to me trying to find portal dense areas to just scan a lot of things.

37:30.800 --> 37:33.320
And so I could work on my controller badge really fast.

37:33.320 --> 37:38.680
I'm already up to I got the bronze level, I'm past 100 I'm up to about 150 unique portals

37:38.680 --> 37:44.360
because I've been going to dense areas, parks, I found I was scanning at parks.

37:44.360 --> 37:47.360
But right now there's a lot of kids at parks.

37:47.360 --> 37:52.780
There's a lot of asshole teenagers at parks, because people you know, there's not a lot

37:52.780 --> 37:55.560
to do in quarantine right now, but go outside and go to parks.

37:55.560 --> 38:00.100
So it's hard for me to be like, I'm going to take out my phone and like, pretend like

38:00.100 --> 38:02.060
I'm not taking pictures of your kid.

38:02.060 --> 38:03.060
I promise.

38:03.060 --> 38:04.060
I'm taking pictures.

38:04.060 --> 38:05.400
It's too weird for me.

38:05.400 --> 38:07.380
And I don't want to go there.

38:07.380 --> 38:13.220
So where do you think the portal dense area is that I found where I don't get bothered

38:13.220 --> 38:18.940
by anybody and graveyards graveyards that is exactly right.

38:18.940 --> 38:24.460
And so let me actually roll some b roll of me doing a portal scan at a graveyard at a

38:24.460 --> 38:26.140
graveyard.

38:26.140 --> 38:31.380
And I gotta tell you, you know, what's fun about it is that the location doesn't so you

38:31.380 --> 38:34.420
can see you're in the in sorry, I haven't narrated for the podcast.

38:34.420 --> 38:37.460
You can see I see where the let me let me actually start.

38:37.460 --> 38:40.100
I'm sorry, I was a bad narrator, I'm gonna start the b roll again.

38:40.100 --> 38:45.020
So you see, it shows me a picture of what the grave looks like and the name on it.

38:45.020 --> 38:46.720
I've got to find it.

38:46.720 --> 38:49.200
And the location isn't always accurate.

38:49.200 --> 38:52.960
And that's the fun part is that kind of have to play Where's Waldo a little bit.

38:52.960 --> 38:58.420
So now in the video, okay, I found the portal, I found the grave marker that was in the picture.

38:58.420 --> 39:00.120
And so I start to actually scan.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.480
So this is me walking around the portal.

39:02.480 --> 39:05.560
And you see it actually kind of nevermind the Pokemon Go messages, because that's me

39:05.560 --> 39:07.280
catching via Bluetooth.

39:07.280 --> 39:11.520
But I walk around the portal best I can, although obviously, I'm not going to walk up, I'm not

39:11.520 --> 39:15.120
going to be disrespectful to the graveyard itself.

39:15.120 --> 39:18.960
So I do the best that I can, and then it actually encodes it.

39:18.960 --> 39:23.200
And then it sends the data to Niantic, so that Pikachu can pop out of that gravestone

39:23.200 --> 39:26.640
at some point in Pokemon Go, I imagine.

39:26.640 --> 39:29.960
So you see it actually like replays it to you, it shows a little scan that I took.

39:29.960 --> 39:31.840
And there it goes, I do upload later.

39:31.840 --> 39:35.840
And then I actually upload those scans when I get home at some point later on.

39:35.840 --> 39:38.800
So that's, that's basically what it looks like.

39:38.800 --> 39:44.640
So again, the fun part is, I'm having to use clues in the picture because graveyards, right,

39:44.640 --> 39:46.120
there's tons of gravestones.

39:46.120 --> 39:49.000
But you want to make sure you're scanning the right thing, right?

39:49.000 --> 39:51.660
So I have to use clues like in the picture.

39:51.660 --> 39:53.140
What is the grave shape like?

39:53.140 --> 39:54.640
Does it have a cross on top of it?

39:54.640 --> 39:57.680
Or does it have like a, some of them have a drapery?

39:57.680 --> 39:58.880
Does it have a torch?

39:58.880 --> 40:00.340
Like what like things are on it?

40:00.340 --> 40:01.340
What color is it?

40:01.340 --> 40:07.080
I see a tree in the background, because again, the location is not always accurate in a graveyard.

40:07.080 --> 40:14.040
People like submit it like close, but it's very hard in Niantic system with Pokemon Go

40:14.040 --> 40:18.200
and Ingress, like you see a satellite view of where the portal is supposed to be.

40:18.200 --> 40:22.980
You can't, you can't find that unless it's one of those giant tombs, which sometimes

40:22.980 --> 40:25.540
there's that as well.

40:25.540 --> 40:27.000
It's very hard to find that on satellite view.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.740
So a lot of these things are in the wrong place.

40:28.740 --> 40:33.680
So yeah, that's, that's, and I had a lot of fun doing that today.

40:33.680 --> 40:38.160
And now I'm like, oh, I want to go to all these other places and scan too, because they're

40:38.160 --> 40:40.200
the best things to scan.

40:40.200 --> 40:43.520
Like you know, when you're scanning like plaques on a wall and stuff, they're not very interesting.

40:43.520 --> 40:46.800
They don't really have a lot of shape to them, but gravestones are like kind of awesome

40:46.800 --> 40:47.800
for that.

40:47.800 --> 40:52.000
And again, nobody fucking bothers me at a graveyard at all.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
It's great.

40:53.000 --> 40:57.000
I saw one other person there today and I'm pretty sure they were taking the gyms in Pokemon

40:57.000 --> 40:59.080
Go is what they were doing.

40:59.080 --> 41:02.840
It was also, and I, you know, and as weird as y'all might think it is or whatever, like

41:02.840 --> 41:07.960
I'm completely respectful when I just, I make sure I'm not walking in places that feel disrespectful.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.720
I don't make noise.

41:09.720 --> 41:14.120
I don't, you know, I don't jump on things quite honestly.

41:14.120 --> 41:18.280
And one thing I found through this, because games like Pokemon Go and Ingress and all

41:18.280 --> 41:22.400
these Niantic things and several games are also about exploring your community, right?

41:22.400 --> 41:24.120
That's a big thing that they've always pitched, right?

41:24.120 --> 41:25.120
Right?

41:25.120 --> 41:26.840
Loki is like, explore your community, get to your community.

41:26.840 --> 41:31.520
You know, one thing I learned, this graveyard sucks at upkeep.

41:31.520 --> 41:33.760
And I was actually kind of distressed about it.

41:33.800 --> 41:39.960
I was like, if my relative was buried at the cemetery, I would be so upset by the state

41:39.960 --> 41:40.960
of this.

41:40.960 --> 41:43.200
All of the, none of the grass had been kept.

41:43.200 --> 41:44.640
It was all dead.

41:44.640 --> 41:47.780
California hasn't been in a drought for a couple of years, so I don't know what their

41:47.780 --> 41:49.280
excuse is on that front.

41:49.280 --> 41:50.920
They get at least water at once in a while.

41:50.920 --> 41:52.360
So all the grass was dead.

41:52.360 --> 41:57.760
I saw tombs that were completely like, like had fallen over just out of like disrepair.

41:57.760 --> 42:01.180
There was one, I put a picture on my Instagram that was just like something that had fallen

42:01.180 --> 42:02.180
over into three pieces.

42:02.380 --> 42:05.220
And I was like, what if this was my relative?

42:05.220 --> 42:08.140
This is, this is distressful.

42:08.140 --> 42:14.340
So there's almost a part of me that's like, this game might turn me into an activist of

42:14.340 --> 42:19.440
some sort where I'm like, y'all need to, y'all are paying good money for, you know, this

42:19.440 --> 42:24.620
type of care and to memorialize your relatives and so forth.

42:24.620 --> 42:30.340
And I bet if some people saw the state of disrepair this place was in, they'd be shocked.

42:30.340 --> 42:31.340
So I don't know.

42:31.500 --> 42:34.340
I could just start an Instagram or a Yelp or something like that.

42:34.340 --> 42:35.340
I don't know.

42:35.340 --> 42:40.260
So Bobby Blackwolf in chat says the undertaker would take care of that graveyard.

42:40.260 --> 42:41.260
Yeah.

42:41.260 --> 42:43.380
Bobby Blackwolf says Rob has 5G.

42:43.380 --> 42:44.380
Okay.

42:44.380 --> 42:46.620
But that's, that's the fake 5G.

42:46.620 --> 42:48.580
That's the, it's look very carefully.

42:48.580 --> 42:50.920
It's 5GE.

42:50.920 --> 42:52.740
That's my AT&T 5G.

42:52.740 --> 42:53.740
Okay.

42:53.740 --> 42:55.260
It's, it's very different.

42:55.260 --> 42:59.900
It's not, not actual 5G.

42:59.900 --> 43:00.900
Let's see.

43:01.460 --> 43:02.460
Let's see some comments in chat here.

43:02.460 --> 43:05.660
Quest Buster says Rob is going to end up on the 11 o'clock news as part of the graveyard

43:05.660 --> 43:06.660
hoard story.

43:06.660 --> 43:07.660
I don't know.

43:07.660 --> 43:11.660
Phoenix 7726 says, so Pikachu's a grave digger.

43:11.660 --> 43:12.660
LOL.

43:12.660 --> 43:18.420
I mean, that's what, I assume it's for Pokemon Go and some type of AR feature, but we also

43:18.420 --> 43:20.860
know Niantic's working on Catan.

43:20.860 --> 43:26.660
I don't know what type of AR stuff would be in Catan, but at the same time I would have

43:26.660 --> 43:30.400
never foresaw what AR stuff would have been in Pokemon.

43:30.400 --> 43:31.400
So who knows?

43:31.400 --> 43:34.860
Maybe when you build things in Catan, cause that is Niantic's next game, that's, that's

43:34.860 --> 43:38.560
out there and you can sign up for the beta now.

43:38.560 --> 43:39.560
I don't know.

43:39.560 --> 43:40.880
They might implement it in their Harry Potter game.

43:40.880 --> 43:41.880
I keep forgetting.

43:41.880 --> 43:43.560
I kind of stopped on Harry Potter, Wizards Unite.

43:43.560 --> 43:48.960
I just, I, I think that that's Orna's fault because I have found the maximum number of

43:48.960 --> 43:50.960
those games I can play at once is three.

43:50.960 --> 43:54.960
I cannot play more than three GPS games at once.

43:54.960 --> 43:56.080
So I finally left.

43:56.080 --> 44:01.560
So Wizards Unite by the wayside and I don't know, maybe the traces will do something with

44:01.560 --> 44:02.560
the AR.

44:02.560 --> 44:03.560
I don't know.

44:03.560 --> 44:04.560
So interesting.

44:04.560 --> 44:09.840
Anyway, so yeah, that's, that's my interesting new obsession is I'm scanning graveyards.

44:09.840 --> 44:11.060
It's good exercise.

44:11.060 --> 44:13.120
I get my steps in.

44:13.120 --> 44:18.200
There's no children running around acting crazy and no parents going like, why is that

44:18.200 --> 44:21.480
creepy dude with his phone trying to take pictures of my kid?

44:21.480 --> 44:25.680
I would much rather somebody just be like, why is that dude taking pictures in a graveyard?

44:25.680 --> 44:29.720
Because honestly, I think there's a lot of people, graveyards are, graveyards are meant

44:29.720 --> 44:30.880
to be good looking.

44:30.880 --> 44:32.200
They're meant to be beautiful.

44:32.200 --> 44:34.840
They're meant to be eternal resting spots of sorts.

44:34.840 --> 44:38.400
That's why I was so irritated with this one I went to today and the state of disrepair

44:38.400 --> 44:39.400
it was in.

44:39.400 --> 44:42.720
I was like, if I was buried here, I'd be so mad.

44:42.720 --> 44:46.160
And I don't think what I'm doing is disrespectful either.

44:46.160 --> 44:52.240
Like it's, it's a way to memorialize or if, if I pass away, you guys suddenly and unexpectedly,

44:52.240 --> 44:54.800
I know this is a morbid thing to talk about, but I should talk about it.

44:55.160 --> 45:01.280
If I should pass away unexpectedly and quickly, absolutely, I want to become a Pokestop and

45:01.280 --> 45:02.280
a portal.

45:02.280 --> 45:09.360
So whether it's a bench with my name on it or whatever, absolutely, that is how I want

45:09.360 --> 45:10.360
to be remembered.

45:10.360 --> 45:12.400
So, all right.

45:12.400 --> 45:17.820
Phoenix 7726 in chat says, Rob, are you going, Rob, are you going through an elder emo phase

45:17.820 --> 45:18.820
of sorts?

45:18.820 --> 45:20.820
I mean, I was always a little emo.

45:20.820 --> 45:23.440
And actdeft in chat says, you're not wrong, Rob at all.

45:23.440 --> 45:24.440
No, thank you.

45:24.580 --> 45:25.580
Thank you.

45:25.580 --> 45:26.580
That's my favorite phrase.

45:26.580 --> 45:27.580
All right.

45:27.580 --> 45:29.360
Anyway, enough of my gaming week.

45:29.360 --> 45:31.200
I just had to talk about that a little bit.

45:31.200 --> 45:36.840
Let's actually get into some gaming news and some other things that have happened around

45:36.840 --> 45:38.000
the gaming world this week.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.240
Sorry, I'm reading some more comments in chat.

45:41.240 --> 45:45.600
Chronos Ode in chat says, cemeteries are some of my favorite places to go for peace and

45:45.600 --> 45:46.600
quiet.

45:46.600 --> 45:47.720
Exactly that.

45:47.720 --> 45:49.480
Like people don't bother me.

45:49.480 --> 45:50.800
They don't look at me funny.

45:50.800 --> 45:53.320
Like everybody's kind of minding their own business.

45:53.320 --> 45:56.200
I used to have picnics in cemeteries.

45:56.200 --> 45:58.520
That's and you know what we would do?

45:58.520 --> 46:01.560
We would do gravestone rubbings with chalk and paper.

46:01.560 --> 46:03.160
Oh, that's pretty cool.

46:03.160 --> 46:04.600
Yeah, that's really neat.

46:04.600 --> 46:06.760
I mean, I'm a kid.

46:06.760 --> 46:07.760
Yeah.

46:07.760 --> 46:11.960
I mean, and I don't again, I don't think it's I don't find myself being disrespectful.

46:11.960 --> 46:16.560
I mean, if I was making noise and screaming and dancing and knocking things over like

46:16.560 --> 46:19.360
somebody clearly did in this place, there's a graffiti too.

46:19.360 --> 46:20.360
I would.

46:20.360 --> 46:21.360
That's that.

46:21.360 --> 46:22.360
I don't.

46:22.360 --> 46:23.360
But I don't do that stuff.

46:23.360 --> 46:24.960
Um, let's see.

46:24.960 --> 46:28.480
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, put on your tombstone, dear resistance.

46:28.480 --> 46:29.960
Keep this portal.

46:29.960 --> 46:32.320
Hell no.

46:32.320 --> 46:33.320
Forever green.

46:33.320 --> 46:34.320
All right.

46:34.320 --> 46:37.880
Anyway, I suppose there's some people on resistance I like.

46:37.880 --> 46:40.680
And I suppose if they wanted to visit once in a while, they could.

46:40.680 --> 46:41.720
But this is very morbid.

46:41.720 --> 46:42.720
So let's move on.

46:42.720 --> 46:45.520
Let's talk about what's going on in gaming news around the industry.

46:45.520 --> 46:47.800
So Loki, we'll start with you.

46:47.800 --> 46:48.800
Yes.

46:49.240 --> 46:55.040
So there is a very exciting new Lego set that's been announced that is going to celebrate

46:55.040 --> 46:58.480
the 30th anniversary of the Nintendo Entertainment System.

46:58.480 --> 47:02.120
And it is a Lego Nintendo Enter entertainment system.

47:02.120 --> 47:07.340
So not only do you get the console, you get a controller, you get the Super Mario Brothers

47:07.340 --> 47:12.560
game cartridge, which actually does plug into the console itself, but also a retro style

47:12.560 --> 47:17.900
TV with a crank that moves a little scene in there that you can actually move Mario

47:17.900 --> 47:19.980
up and down on as well.

47:19.980 --> 47:26.100
And then, of course, if you have the starter kit for the new Super Mario Brothers Lego

47:26.100 --> 47:30.440
sets, then you can plug that in on top and it'll play the Mario Brothers theme music

47:30.440 --> 47:31.440
as well.

47:31.440 --> 47:33.700
So it's coming out August 1st.

47:33.700 --> 47:37.980
It's going to run two hundred and thirty dollars.

47:37.980 --> 47:39.300
But wow, does it look amazing?

47:39.300 --> 47:46.380
Yeah, I got to say this is I mean, the fact that it's a Nintendo set is cool, but even

47:46.380 --> 47:52.020
if it wasn't Nintendo, this is probably one of the most badass Lego things I've ever seen.

47:52.020 --> 47:55.140
Like this is next level.

47:55.140 --> 48:00.180
But I can't with that price tag, I can't like not not for me, but I'm also I'm not the Lego

48:00.180 --> 48:01.500
affectionate.

48:01.500 --> 48:03.780
Some of the rest of y'all are low key.

48:03.780 --> 48:08.220
So have you or did you drop the money on it or trying to?

48:08.220 --> 48:11.820
Well, they don't they don't always for your other sets.

48:11.820 --> 48:12.820
Oh, right.

48:12.820 --> 48:13.820
Yeah.

48:13.820 --> 48:15.220
You have to wait.

48:15.220 --> 48:20.300
Bobby Black Wolf and Chad says, I'm getting this even at that price, not a scalper price,

48:20.300 --> 48:21.300
though.

48:21.300 --> 48:25.660
So I'm with you on that and I would never pay a scalper for it.

48:25.660 --> 48:29.300
I was just about to ask you because you guys do some Lego collecting, right?

48:29.300 --> 48:31.060
Just not a ton, right?

48:31.060 --> 48:32.940
We do.

48:32.940 --> 48:40.180
We we actually have like two Back to the Future sets, the DeLorean and two Ecto ones.

48:40.180 --> 48:42.460
And I would really want this one.

48:42.460 --> 48:46.220
But then again, we do have other things that we need to do.

48:46.220 --> 48:49.380
So anyone want to buy a house for selling one?

48:49.380 --> 48:51.380
Oh, actually, yes.

48:51.380 --> 48:55.100
You want to live in a retirement community?

48:55.100 --> 48:56.980
No, that no, I don't.

48:56.980 --> 48:57.980
OK.

48:57.980 --> 48:58.980
Yeah.

48:58.980 --> 49:04.220
But it's funny to say that, though, you know, I really you know, we really are about to

49:04.220 --> 49:05.220
start those conversations.

49:05.220 --> 49:06.220
Right.

49:06.220 --> 49:08.060
So we may have to talk.

49:08.060 --> 49:09.060
Yeah.

49:09.060 --> 49:11.140
But the other kind of funny thing with all that is.

49:11.140 --> 49:15.580
OK, so so Bobby Black over the chat is I'm willing to pay 230 for it, not any higher

49:15.580 --> 49:16.580
as to 100.

49:16.580 --> 49:18.460
Matt says 250 was my max for it.

49:18.460 --> 49:19.460
Thankfully, it was lower.

49:19.460 --> 49:22.380
So you guys say that two thirty to fifty with Lego sets.

49:22.380 --> 49:28.060
And my mind goes, I could get another arcade one up cabinet for 200 bucks, dude.

49:28.060 --> 49:32.900
I'm telling you, I Placerville.

49:32.900 --> 49:38.140
Has Pacman cabs for fifty dollars, 50, don't they've got a few left.

49:38.140 --> 49:40.980
My husband will divorce me if I bring another one of those in this house.

49:40.980 --> 49:43.780
I've been just sitting there.

49:43.780 --> 49:45.700
I still want the Star Wars one.

49:45.700 --> 49:48.700
Those are still in Roseville.

49:48.700 --> 49:51.860
I'm going to be sending hubby on an errand.

49:51.860 --> 49:57.380
Yeah, but that's the thing that was like like I don't like Pacman that much.

49:57.380 --> 49:59.740
And so I'm like, no, I can't do that.

49:59.740 --> 50:02.060
That's like that's the one you hack in it.

50:02.060 --> 50:06.020
That's because surely, surely somebody's figured out how to hack one of those cabinets.

50:06.020 --> 50:07.020
No, they already have.

50:07.060 --> 50:08.420
I mean, they have tons of stuff.

50:08.420 --> 50:09.900
There's a whole marketplace for that stuff.

50:09.900 --> 50:16.300
But I would like something that's less that, you know, less that you need to modify to it.

50:16.300 --> 50:20.540
Like, for example, a street fighter cab where it has six buttons for each player.

50:20.540 --> 50:26.900
I mean, that would be ideal or like a the Ninja Turtles one would be pretty cool, too.

50:26.900 --> 50:28.780
But those are still full price.

50:28.780 --> 50:31.420
Wait, oh, wait.

50:31.420 --> 50:34.380
I mean, at one time at one time, it's ridiculous.

50:34.420 --> 50:39.420
At one time, the asteroid caps, they were clearing them out at a dollar, one dollar.

50:40.940 --> 50:45.260
Like, how I don't understand what happens, didn't get snatched up by the employees.

50:45.860 --> 50:48.060
I'm so upset because it's a space thing.

50:48.060 --> 50:52.380
They do take up a bit of space like you can, you know, and they're not they're not for

50:52.380 --> 50:53.500
every type of living space.

50:53.500 --> 50:55.300
I don't even like having one in a rental.

50:55.500 --> 50:56.300
I could imagine.

50:56.300 --> 50:59.820
Loki, back when this show started, you and I used to live in an apartment.

51:00.060 --> 51:01.540
You know what I was about to say?

51:01.900 --> 51:04.260
Could you imagine us having one of those machines in the house?

51:04.260 --> 51:09.860
But then I remember in that apartment, you had that fucking arcade cabinet that you

51:09.860 --> 51:11.820
built in that apartment.

51:12.780 --> 51:14.220
That thing was gigantic.

51:14.220 --> 51:15.900
Oh, God, I wish I had a picture of it.

51:16.380 --> 51:18.100
That's that's an ultimate.

51:18.100 --> 51:19.900
It's an Ultimark arcade.

51:20.860 --> 51:22.780
I think that's what the brand was.

51:22.780 --> 51:23.740
The design was.

51:23.980 --> 51:26.980
But yeah, it was a four player and you like players.

51:27.220 --> 51:29.460
Wasn't our television in that cabinet?

51:30.180 --> 51:31.860
Yes, the television was in the cabinet.

51:31.860 --> 51:32.360
Yes.

51:32.960 --> 51:37.160
I remember playing Dracula X on that thing, hooked up the TurboGrafx.

51:38.080 --> 51:38.680
It's funny.

51:39.960 --> 51:47.120
All right, anyway, all our collections and what they do to us, let's move on.

51:47.320 --> 51:50.200
Let's talk about Cyberpunk 2077.

51:50.200 --> 51:52.360
Some updates on that game this week.

51:52.760 --> 51:54.080
Obviously, the game didn't come out.

51:54.560 --> 51:58.640
But, you know, there's more interviews and things that are being done that are building

51:58.640 --> 52:01.960
more hype for the game and a couple of interesting new features, if you will.

52:02.600 --> 52:03.920
Coming out about the game this week.

52:03.920 --> 52:08.440
So there was a Polish website, Spider's Web, that actually interviewed some of the

52:08.440 --> 52:14.040
folks, lead quest designer in this case for Cyberpunk 2077, talking a little bit

52:14.040 --> 52:18.160
about, you know, how the game works and the way you can play through the game.

52:18.400 --> 52:22.400
What's interesting in the interview, the lead quest designer said, all the most

52:22.400 --> 52:27.600
important choices in the game, all bosses and elite opponents, there is always a way

52:27.600 --> 52:30.080
to go without killing anyone.

52:30.680 --> 52:34.800
Sometimes aggression and fighting with an opponent is something that cannot be avoided.

52:35.080 --> 52:39.800
It is not that you have to take someone's legs or arms, but it is also not so that you

52:39.800 --> 52:41.240
can completely avoid the fight.

52:41.240 --> 52:46.360
But you are able to fight in such a way that you only neutralize your opponents and thus

52:46.360 --> 52:47.240
pass the game.

52:47.520 --> 52:52.080
So in other words, if you want to be Batman and not actually kill anybody, that's going

52:52.080 --> 52:53.840
to be an option to you in Cyberpunk.

52:53.840 --> 52:57.480
I think that's kind of interesting, the kind of like pacifist approach to play the game.

52:57.800 --> 53:03.960
And it sounds like it may not be the obvious way to get through the game either.

53:04.760 --> 53:09.040
I suppose, spoiler alert, but this game is how many years old at this point?

53:09.240 --> 53:13.240
It might be something like Undertale, where the fact that there is a pacifist approach

53:13.240 --> 53:15.720
you can take in that game is not necessarily obvious at first.

53:15.800 --> 53:16.400
You know what I mean?

53:16.560 --> 53:17.520
Those of you that have played it.

53:17.800 --> 53:24.080
So it'll be interesting to see what kind of playthroughs with that, especially now that

53:24.080 --> 53:24.720
people know.

53:25.160 --> 53:27.000
I'm sure there'll be some people that are looking for it.

53:27.520 --> 53:31.240
And of course, some people that maybe aren't into the uber violence like myself, I'm not

53:31.240 --> 53:32.400
really into uber violence.

53:33.040 --> 53:36.280
That might be an interesting approach for me to take, knowing that I don't have to

53:36.280 --> 53:39.640
dismember all these heads and things to actually win the game.

53:39.640 --> 53:40.440
So that's kind of neat.

53:42.040 --> 53:49.120
Also, on a related note with Cyberpunk 2077, also in that same interview, the game is

53:49.120 --> 53:53.800
built in such a way where you can actually complete it without necessarily getting

53:53.800 --> 53:55.520
through the main quest.

53:55.960 --> 54:00.080
A quote on that, we built the cyberpunk structure based on the conclusions we drew

54:00.080 --> 54:00.960
from The Witcher 3.

54:01.240 --> 54:05.200
The Witcher had the main stem of history and side threads departing from it.

54:05.200 --> 54:07.840
And this was our main structure, which we call the ear.

54:08.240 --> 54:13.200
So in cyberpunk structure, we have this wheat spike, which serves as its center, the

54:13.200 --> 54:17.360
main storyline with different subplots surrounding it, which can be triggered in

54:17.360 --> 54:18.280
various ways.

54:18.520 --> 54:21.320
Those subplots allow us to do something we've never done before.

54:21.560 --> 54:25.400
They change the main plot of the game, and they're doing that in such a way that you

54:25.400 --> 54:29.880
may not even finish the main plot, but still finish the game and get a completely

54:29.880 --> 54:33.440
different epilogue than the player with a different life path who made different

54:33.440 --> 54:37.160
choices, met different characters and form relationships with them.

54:37.400 --> 54:41.400
So very interesting type of approach to the game where it sounds like it's going to be

54:41.400 --> 54:45.560
very, I mean, there's open world games and then there's like open world games.

54:45.560 --> 54:49.320
And this definitely sounds like it's going to be open in all sorts of ways that the

54:49.320 --> 54:52.640
main quest isn't even necessarily what you beat to beat the game.

54:52.640 --> 54:54.160
And I think that's kind of fascinating in a way.

54:54.280 --> 54:59.600
I have to admit, I haven't been like as excited about cyberpunk just because I've

54:59.600 --> 55:02.400
kind of chalked it up to it's one of those open world games.

55:02.400 --> 55:04.400
I'm just not going to have the four hundred hours to beat.

55:04.600 --> 55:08.400
But the more I hear about it, the more I'm kind of like, hmm, that's interesting.

55:08.400 --> 55:10.120
I can't. They're doing some things with it.

55:10.280 --> 55:12.000
Yeah, I know you're on their day one.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.240
I know it, but we'll see.

55:13.320 --> 55:14.480
Can't wait. Yeah.

55:15.040 --> 55:18.320
All right. Moving on, Dark Sakura, I'm hoping you're still there.

55:19.320 --> 55:21.520
And you've got the next story.

55:21.720 --> 55:23.600
Yeah, I'm here. I just went off because I

55:23.600 --> 55:26.280
don't think anyone wants to watch me eat my dinner.

55:26.480 --> 55:29.600
I wish I had a way to turn my camera off because I was sitting here eating, too.

55:29.800 --> 55:33.680
And I don't have a thing to take my camera off.

55:33.680 --> 55:35.000
Sorry.

55:35.200 --> 55:37.480
Well, at any rate,

55:37.680 --> 55:39.640
there's also

55:39.840 --> 55:44.120
updates on the horizon for PS Now

55:44.320 --> 55:48.920
that basically in the form of a Sony patent

55:48.920 --> 55:51.920
that was updated that included some different details.

55:52.120 --> 55:55.640
So one of those things that they're talking about, the

55:55.840 --> 56:01.960
the some of the services for PS Now going on to PS5 to allow older games to offer

56:02.160 --> 56:08.680
segments that work as playable demos so they could cut up like different

56:08.880 --> 56:12.480
parts of the game and share them with other people so that they can get a feel

56:12.680 --> 56:16.600
for how the game is. Of course, there's no details

56:16.760 --> 56:19.480
about how exactly that's going to work, but it would be.

56:19.680 --> 56:23.240
But it's supposed to go on on PS Now.

56:23.440 --> 56:26.000
The other talk is that it could also just

56:26.200 --> 56:30.280
be for the sake of clips, but they're talking about it being something playable.

56:30.480 --> 56:35.520
The patent description states in one embodiment, a method is provided for

56:35.720 --> 56:40.800
creating a playable limited version of a video game and executed by a user of

56:41.000 --> 56:43.800
a complete version of a video game.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.320
So that's actually kind of cool.

56:46.480 --> 56:49.240
Yeah, that would be good.

56:49.440 --> 56:53.240
I just think it would be a really great way to to share experiences with people

56:53.440 --> 56:57.240
and try to get other people to to get in on some of these games.

56:57.240 --> 56:59.320
It definitely would spread the market

56:59.320 --> 57:02.080
because I mean, how many times do we lend out demo discs and whatnot?

57:02.280 --> 57:03.280
Kind of the same.

57:03.480 --> 57:08.280
Yeah, it's it's a real novel approach of kind of taking this idea of like watching

57:08.280 --> 57:11.000
a YouTube or a Twitch stream to kind of get a feel of a game.

57:11.200 --> 57:13.560
It's really kind of taking that to the next level where it's like,

57:13.720 --> 57:17.280
don't just watch this clip of the game, play this clip of the game.

57:17.480 --> 57:20.240
I think that's that's a really interesting approach.

57:20.440 --> 57:24.560
If that's again, we nothing is official until Sony says it's there.

57:24.760 --> 57:27.800
But if that's true, that's that is neat.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.160
That's that's a real next generation thing.

57:30.360 --> 57:31.600
You can do better. You try it.

57:31.800 --> 57:34.040
Yeah, it's well, it's an interesting

57:34.240 --> 57:36.880
approach that nobody seems to be interested in in Stadia.

57:37.080 --> 57:41.840
So, you know, Stadia's got this thing that will be out.

57:41.840 --> 57:44.440
So this is you can play your favorite.

57:44.640 --> 57:46.080
You'll be able to play with your favorite

57:46.280 --> 57:49.120
creator while the world watches with crowd play.

57:49.320 --> 57:53.600
So it means that people, I guess, will watch it live on YouTube.

57:53.800 --> 57:55.960
And then you can join in against like

57:56.160 --> 58:01.000
creators of the games and play versus on them, like bring about Dead by Daylight

58:01.200 --> 58:05.000
and Super Bomberman are online, so I mean, that's cool and all.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.400
But what are the odds you're actually going up against the developer?

58:07.440 --> 58:09.760
Or are we talking about, like,

58:09.960 --> 58:15.160
like essentially like a ghost racer in a game like Mario Kart or something or

58:15.160 --> 58:18.560
like one of the developers is the ghost racer and you're playing against them?

58:18.560 --> 58:20.560
I don't that makes sense.

58:20.760 --> 58:23.640
It does. Or you could be playing with the

58:23.840 --> 58:28.480
personal assistant of the second head of the unit.

58:28.680 --> 58:31.280
I mean, not that I wouldn't mind playing with a personal assistant or anything.

58:31.280 --> 58:35.160
I'm not putting that down, but I mean, I'm just saying it's kind of.

58:35.360 --> 58:36.640
It could be anybody.

58:36.800 --> 58:39.600
It almost sounds much like the

58:39.800 --> 58:45.400
not necessarily demos, like special versions of the games that they put on,

58:45.600 --> 58:51.360
like the Nintendo online and the Super Nintendo online.

58:51.560 --> 58:54.320
They're little like, yes, so tell of you.

58:54.520 --> 58:56.280
Oh, no, no, no, not necessarily that.

58:56.280 --> 58:59.080
I'm talking about the ones where it's like, well, it's a safe state.

58:59.280 --> 59:01.520
That's at the end of the game with all of this,

59:01.720 --> 59:05.640
you know, all of these power ups and go play, you know, or oh, hey,

59:05.640 --> 59:09.920
we started the game with like one hundred lives and all these equipment.

59:10.120 --> 59:12.640
It's SP. It's the SP games like there's

59:12.840 --> 59:16.720
the Kid Icarus SP that just starts you on the last level.

59:16.920 --> 59:22.000
Or the Zelda SP that starts you with two hundred fifty five rupees or something

59:22.000 --> 59:23.080
like that, I know what you're talking about.

59:23.280 --> 59:26.560
Yeah, you're right, it is kind of like that.

59:26.760 --> 59:29.920
Interesting, but but you're only getting into though.

59:29.920 --> 59:32.720
I mean, it's not like, yeah, you're at the end of the game with all this.

59:32.720 --> 59:34.640
It's like, let me send you something

59:34.840 --> 59:39.680
from the middle most boring part of the game, because I'm a good friend.

59:40.120 --> 59:41.400
Here, do all this farming.

59:41.600 --> 59:46.120
Welcome to my life or like a game like Celeste, I think is a good example, too.

59:46.320 --> 59:51.600
Like here's see if you can beat this random fucking hard ass room and get

59:51.800 --> 59:54.680
the strawberry that, you know, I could do earlier.

59:54.880 --> 59:56.040
Here you go. Have fun.

59:56.240 --> 59:57.600
That's as pretty neat.

59:57.600 --> 01:00:00.800
I'd be very curious what the limitations are on something like that.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.720
But it's it's a real rad idea.

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:06.760
I think so. Yeah, I think so, too.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:10.000
All right. I'm looking forward to some of these newer developments.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
I think the PlayStation stuff is becoming a little bit more exciting to me.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.280
Yeah, well, and it's it's these types

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:20.040
of things that really start to feel next gen, so to speak.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.960
Like, you know, again, from a technological perspective, you know,

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:27.360
how many more gigaflops or whatever can we get in the consoles?

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:29.360
I think it's really these sorts of ideas

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:33.440
that are going to start to feel like, oh, this is this is the next generation

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:36.200
of gaming, this is the next generation of sharing.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.360
It's participating.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:40.320
You know, it's going to be very interesting.

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:45.920
All right. Well, Loki, what are my chances I'll get a PS5?

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:49.040
Hopefully better than they would normally be,

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:53.800
apparently Sony has been ramping up production ahead of the launch of the

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.640
console, and they're expecting or at least targeting 10 million consoles made by

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:03.040
March 2021, so that would be within their fiscal year.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:08.480
Yeah, I hope that's actually going to happen, and I hope that that means that

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:11.000
the console will be easier to get and that we're not going to have to,

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:14.200
you know, fight the black markets to get that stuff.

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.520
I'm thinking that maybe

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:21.080
obviously that they're going to want to try to ramp that up just in general,

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:25.840
because I think we're still going to be in like a pandemic scenario by the time

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:27.760
that stuff rolls around anyways.

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:30.920
And a lot of people suck at home, got to have something to do.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:34.560
You know, it makes sense that you want to launch it with as many units as possible.

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.080
So I hope that's actually going to be the case.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:40.800
And maybe, you know, that the whole COVID-19

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.040
situation doesn't affect production too much.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.840
But we'll have to wait and see, I guess.

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:50.360
Or they may be just not going to have a problem selling those consoles because

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.760
it's going to be too damn expensive and no one's going to buy them.

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.760
Well, they're not making the consoles in

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:59.800
this country and they're not making them in Brazil or what's the other?

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.360
Is it Russia that's third right now?

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.360
So it's they're not making them there.

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.280
So, I mean, COVID, COVID is still a global issue,

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.320
but other countries have it in control.

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:13.320
This is this is it's really a U.S. problem right now.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.000
I mean, in Brazil and other countries.

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.360
But we're number one.

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:17.960
Yeah, we're number one.

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.600
All right. We're winning.

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:21.240
It's all this winning I've been told about.

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:23.600
So anyway, sorry, we know and we shouldn't

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:28.560
make light of what is really horrific, but like in this type of

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:32.600
situation, like a morbid sense of humor is the only thing that's carrying me

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:37.560
through right now, because otherwise I would just be so upset and angry.

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:38.880
So.

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:40.400
Anyway,

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:41.920
let's see,

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:45.440
DJ Rama S talking about Sony versus Microsoft in chat saying,

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:49.720
regardless of which console drops first, I'll be getting the Xbox Series X first

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.920
between backwards compatibility and Game Pass.

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.320
I'm sold.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.440
VG Realness in chat talking a little bit about the last story,

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:59.640
although it all ties into PlayStation 5, says at the same time,

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:03.640
a feature like that doesn't seem like something that needs a new console to pull

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:07.640
off. True, especially because SharePlay is

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:10.840
already something that exists on the PlayStation 4.

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.840
But since they are rebuilding the interface

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:18.280
completely for PlayStation 5, I would say there'd be a lot to go

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:23.240
with how seamless that is, how easy that is for them to build into that.

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:25.640
But you are right to the extent of they

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:27.720
could probably just build it into the PlayStation 4.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:30.520
But I suppose it also goes back to what we were talking about at the very beginning

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:36.360
of the show is that Microsoft could stop charging for gold tomorrow if they want.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:40.640
But there's something very symbolic about doing it with Xbox Series X that could be

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:44.360
very interesting if that does pan out and ends up being true.

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:46.680
It's almost almost like you kind of tie

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:50.160
that feature to the new generation, if that makes sense.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:55.280
So anyhow, let's move on to our next story, which is something I would like to play

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:59.720
with backwards compatibility, even on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:04.880
Although knowing this game, it will probably get a rerelease on those systems

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:08.680
and will probably have even more features because this game just won't stop.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.360
It's No Man's Sky.

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:15.360
And No Man's Sky got yet another big update this week.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:18.480
What did they add? Something called Desolation.

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:20.840
It's a free update, as they all have been.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:23.560
And now you have new freighters in the game.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:27.240
And it's supposed to be kind of like a scary type of experience.

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.280
The freighters are procedurally

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.840
generated, like everything else in the game, of course.

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:35.880
And so wherever you find one, it'll be different every time.

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.680
You'll find ship logs, personal possessions,

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:41.600
and it'll talk about what happened to the crew that used to be there.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.560
Yikes.

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.440
They brought a little bit of dead space into...

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.480
They brought a little bit of dead space in No Man's Sky.

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:47.720
That's exactly right.

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.360
You might find in these places the lights

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:55.040
are off or the gravity is off or the life support systems have gone wrong.

01:04:55.240 --> 01:05:00.640
There will also be biological horrors that will be there to respond to you.

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:02.720
So that might be a little scary.

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:04.640
What is interesting, though, is that now,

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:08.480
if you didn't know, No Man's Sky truly is multiplayer now.

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:10.680
So you don't have to explore these things on your own.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:13.120
You can do it with other people.

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.680
If you really want to kick up that horror,

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:19.040
don't forget No Man's Sky also got a VR update some time ago.

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:22.080
So you could do this whole thing in VR if you want,

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:26.200
if you want, underlined and italicized.

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:26.840
But yeah.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.080
And of course, if you get through these

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:31.720
freighters, you get big rewards that you can use on your own starship.

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:36.440
And they say it will reflect the history of ships you've scavenged.

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:37.720
That's kind of interesting.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.280
So, yeah, so that is yet another.

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.800
And of course, this update also comes

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.120
with bug fixes and the other types of minor updates.

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:47.760
But as much as it's almost meme-able

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:51.480
at this point that No Man's Sky got yet another update,

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:57.680
it is pretty awesome that this game that everybody hated right out the gate has not

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:01.720
stopped and has remained committed to filling out that full vision,

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:05.160
which quite honestly, if they had stopped six months ago,

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:08.000
I don't think anybody would have faulted them and said,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.680
oh, you never delivered us a full game.

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.360
You know, they they've they delivered us

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.760
a full game and a lot of good stuff a long time ago.

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:18.480
But this like it almost feels like now they just want to one up their critics.

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:22.000
And that's fine, too, because the game just keeps going.

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:23.320
But, you know, I was talking about this

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:25.760
with Alan yesterday and he did bring up a good point.

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:30.560
And that was that he kind of like he was playing it for a little bit,

01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:33.560
but almost got frustrated that whenever there was a big update,

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:36.120
it was like, I have to like relearn the game.

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:40.280
I have to like restart because all these things have changed in the game.

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:42.520
I don't think you necessarily have to restart.

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:44.160
But sometimes you just like there's that

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:47.200
psychological part that's like, I've missed all this stuff.

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:49.800
So I need to go back to the beginning and re-experience it all.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.520
And so I kind of get that, too, where it's like, hey, guys,

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:56.640
hello, games, what you're doing is fabulous.

01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:58.760
And we love that you supported the game this long.

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:02.760
But at the same time, could you kind of tell us, like, when you're done

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:09.200
so that we know it's it's safe to go exploring now and that it's I don't know,

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.160
like, is it's kind of a fine line.

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.560
What do you guys think in chat?

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:16.080
Do they keep building out the game or

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:19.120
is it time to just stop and let us experience what there is?

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:21.600
What do you think, Loki or Dark Sakura?

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.880
I still have to go back to play the game.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:28.360
It's been a while and I've got a PC now, so I need to do that.

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:34.320
But I don't know if I don't know if I want to play it in VR and go into one of those

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.440
new freighters.

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:41.920
Well, I think that for them, this is actually kind of

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:46.160
a way to keep a franchise alive without actually having to do too much work to it.

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.640
Does that make sense?

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.240
Sure. I mean, I get it.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:53.040
It is work, but it's I guess starting from scratch is a lot more work.

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:55.240
Creating No Man's Sky, too, is even more work.

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.200
I get it. Exactly.

01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:00.200
So in this way, they get to keep

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:03.520
putting out more content

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:08.320
without having to go through all the.

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.880
The strains of

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:15.680
the best way to put it, without the strains of having to recreate their world,

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:20.120
it's just adding on and adding on like they've got infinite property and you're

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:24.320
just adding new it's like it's like Sarah Winchester in her house.

01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:27.120
Or anyone who don't know,

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:31.360
you know, this is the Winchester Mystery House of Games.

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:33.760
No, that's right on the money.

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.200
That's that's a perfect answer.

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:38.040
No, that is the perfect comparison.

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:40.440
No Man's Sky is the Winchester Mystery House of Games.

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:42.240
You're absolutely right.

01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:47.960
Yeah. And but hey, you know, she kept doing it until she died.

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:52.120
And nature tried to knock it over and guess what?

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:53.680
The house fucking stood.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:57.760
So No Man's Sky is going to stand just like the Winchester Mystery House.

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:01.360
I think I think the Winchester Mystery House might be a local reference,

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.920
like most people from Northern California probably understand the joke.

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:06.120
There's that movie. Oh, that's right.

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:07.560
They made a movie out of it. I forgot.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.280
It wasn't good, though. I don't think a lot of people saw it.

01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:11.680
So if you don't want to see it, I love that place.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.400
There's this woman and Winchester was like a gun company or something, right?

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:17.200
And she it was actually the Winchester Rifle Company.

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:19.400
Yeah, she there's this house in San Jose

01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:22.040
and everybody knows it because everybody took a field trip there at some point

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:24.640
in their life while they grew up in this area.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:28.000
And so she kept building and building and building to this house because she

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.080
believed she was being haunted or something like that.

01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:32.480
Like the victims of the story.

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:37.960
The story goes is that because her husband's guns had killed so many

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:44.280
Native Americans that she that she thought she was being haunted by by their spirits.

01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:46.480
She saw a medium who said that she wasn't

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:49.760
going to die until construction stopped on the house.

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:54.120
I mean, there's a lot there's she was a pretty private lady on top of it.

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:57.760
So there's really not a whole lot that's known.

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:01.600
But, you know, the house itself is absolutely amazing.

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:04.600
I've been on the extended tour.

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:10.280
Chris and I went before they moved out to Wisconsin.

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.880
I have a secret I've never been.

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:15.640
But I've beautiful I've done Rocky Horror

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:18.080
Picture Show in the movie theater next door.

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:20.520
And yes, there is a movie theater next door.

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.320
That was where I saw the labyrinth.

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:24.880
It's it's right in the middle of San Jose.

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:26.280
It's like they tear it down, though.

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:29.880
So the movie theater they did, they were going to tear down because we had

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:32.120
a mutual friend who was the manager there for many years.

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.120
That's right. Yeah.

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:36.880
So but they finally turn it down at any rate.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:40.520
I mean, and you go into this and it's actually going back to No Man's Sky.

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:41.760
You go through and you have all this

01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:46.000
discovery and you find these interesting little things and things that look like

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:51.920
their purpose, purposeless, I guess that's sort of making up just now purposeless.

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:57.440
Like she has a seance room that has a door that leads to a two story drop.

01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:01.320
There are stairs that go to nowhere just to the ceiling.

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:03.480
She collected so much Tiffany.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:06.480
There's like they've got a whole room dedicated to the Tiffany that she

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:08.840
collected and these teensy tiny little stairs.

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:10.640
But if you think about it again in terms

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.960
of the game being like the Winchester Mystery House,

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:16.280
doesn't the game have kind of weird dead ends like that, too?

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:21.440
So we have a we have a mutual friend and I don't want to out them here on the show,

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:27.480
but he lives kind of out in a rural area in a very kind of older home.

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:30.320
And we always kind of joke that he lived in the Winchester Mystery House because he

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:34.440
legit had this like room where, like, you would open a door and there just be a

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:40.520
brick wall there like, yeah, there was crazy stuff like that in the house.

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.520
And we're like, dude, your house is haunted.

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:43.600
But he loves it there.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.560
So anyway.

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:48.240
All right. Sorry, we got on a tangent, but that's OK.

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:48.840
We're educated.

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:52.880
Let me ask you to have an email.

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:56.280
No. Oh, OK, I'll tell you later.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:58.480
I'll text you. It's somebody local.

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:01.680
OK, OK, because I want to go there now.

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:05.240
OK, I texted you, OK,

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:10.520
but at any rate, at any rate, I'll just look at pictures of the Winchester Mystery.

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:12.800
Oh, OK, cool.

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:15.680
I love him. I haven't talked to him in so long.

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.400
Yeah, it's been a while for me, too.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.880
But at any rate.

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:22.960
I think when you look at the Winchester

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:28.560
Mystery House and you look at the the game there, yeah, it is the Winchester

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:32.840
Mystery House of games, I feel confident in giving it that moniker.

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:35.960
No, that's great. And who even needs to expand on that?

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:37.280
OK. Hype mayhem.

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:39.720
I know you know what I meant.

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:43.200
He says, OK, not going to lie, even though I know what Jamie meant by Tiffany,

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:48.360
I also made a connection to the team from 80s that saying I think we're alone now.

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:50.240
Now, you know what?

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.240
Tiffany was a great singer.

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.320
She did more than malls.

01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:57.800
OK, one point I have to get back to, though, that's very important with this is

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:01.720
that the whole and you brought up this idea of Dark Soccer with your Winchester

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:06.120
Mystery House comparison is that that there is particularly like new features

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:11.320
and new things that might expose the game to a new audience that hasn't experienced

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:15.520
the game yet. And a lot of you guys in chat are kind of when you hear that

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:18.320
they've built this jump scare thing in a no man's sky.

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:19.680
They've built a dead space type game.

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:22.360
A lot of you guys in chat are like, nope, nope, man.

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:26.080
Sky nope. And out of that, not for me, it's not what I want to do.

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:28.760
But if you think about it, and I'm sure all of you can see this,

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:32.000
there is an audience that loves scary games.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.560
Look at some of the big stuff that streamed on Twitch.

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:35.920
A lot of scary games. Right.

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:40.520
And there's probably an audience out there that when they hear, oh, did you hear?

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:43.080
No man's sky has like a full on horror mode.

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:45.720
Now people are going to be like, what really?

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:49.360
I need to go back and visit that game or I need to pick that game up already.

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:51.160
It's on sale again or whatever it is.

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:55.280
So even though you might look at that feature and go, that's really not for me.

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.960
I think you can see where, oh, there's somebody else is going to look at that

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:00.560
and go, oh, I should check that out.

01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:01.920
That's that's my jam.

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:03.480
I love horror games.

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:06.760
So kind of interesting anyway.

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:08.600
All right, let's move on.

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:09.840
More big stories.

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:12.720
I think this one's yours, Loki, or who's there?

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:14.520
Is it mine? Where are we at even?

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:17.080
It would be Jamie. Oh, it's Jamie again.

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:18.440
Yep. Well, shit.

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:21.400
I was going to eat some more pizza, but OK.

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:27.280
So there, you know, we often complain about Metacritic with, you know,

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:30.440
especially like when there's games that come out that people just want to

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:34.640
immediately poo poo on because they want to, you know, there was a woman

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:38.640
developed it or a writer or they don't like the storyline and they're just

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:42.040
really doing that soon now, you know, we call that review bombing.

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:42.760
Right.

01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:48.560
So it's become such a big issue now that Metacritic announced that they're going

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:55.440
to delay user reviews for a video game for thirty six hours after the game's release.

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:59.800
And they quote that their decision is based on, here's the quote,

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.360
data driven research and with the input of critics and industry experts.

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:05.520
So here's the rest of it.

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:09.480
We recently implemented implemented the thirty six hour waiting period for all

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:14.000
user reviews in our game section to ensure our gamers have time to play these games

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.320
before writing their reviews, a Metacritic spokesperson said.

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:21.400
The new waiting period is for user reviews, for user reviews have been rolled out

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:24.920
across Metacritic's game section and was based on data driven research

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.720
with the input of critics and industry standards.

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:30.560
Now, we know that if they want to bomb it, they're going to bomb it.

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:36.120
But my hope with this is that they're going to.

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:40.000
They're going to, you know, kind of push people off that immediate thing

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.160
when they see that they can't get their

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:44.800
immediate reward out of it, then hopefully they're not going to do it.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.320
Now, on top of that, just to add in another layer on things,

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:52.640
and this has actually been going on for quite a while, you know,

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:58.040
developers are really unhappy with how Metacritic was handling it before,

01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:02.360
because, you know, some of those reviews are the lifeblood of of their their

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:06.360
careers, their games, you know, so.

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:08.240
I think this is this is a good step,

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:13.440
whether or not it will work remains to be seen, but, you know.

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:19.840
Yeah, with the whole Metacritic thing, I mean, I just just don't listen to user

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:24.680
reviews in the first place, that kind of would fix the problem, in my opinion.

01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:29.680
Well, but the thing is, it's supposed to be, you know,

01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:32.920
what's the word I'm thinking of, it's supposed to be

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:35.400
community driven as well.

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:38.360
So, I don't know.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:41.080
Yeah, I mean, it's it's not going to stop

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:44.760
people from reviewing games on their Twitter account or on their Facebook feed

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:47.920
or on other places with social media or what have you.

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:53.880
But, you know, I guess Metacritic, if they want to stop being known as like the home

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:59.040
of terrible user reviews because games keep getting bombed because it's a game

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:03.960
for SJWs or whatever thing people are mad about with the with the games.

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:06.600
I I can understand where Metacritic's like,

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:09.600
we got to do something like this is getting crazy.

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:14.480
I don't think it's going to really I mean, maybe it'll just

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:18.560
calm them down a little bit, but like, I think they're going to still review bomb

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:23.360
and they'll review bomb in other places like Steam or something.

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:25.040
Yeah, that's true.

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:29.440
Do you do you think other you know, sometimes when a company does this,

01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:34.720
it sets something in motion where like other companies start to follow suit a little bit.

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:36.920
Do you think Metacritic might be setting

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:39.880
a standard that sites like Steam and so forth are going to follow?

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.240
Although I don't know, Steam also just

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:44.480
shows like right there, like you've played for this many hours.

01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:46.920
So you like you like know on Steam right away,

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:50.680
like this person actually played the game or they're full of shit.

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:55.960
Yeah, I don't know if that's going to necessarily I think that I know Metacritic

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:58.640
is kind of garbage when it comes to user reviews anyways.

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.440
I mean, that's what a lot of people think.

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:05.560
So it would be nice to have it not be garbage.

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:09.400
I don't know, I just kind of

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.880
just consider it just a complete garbage and look at the user reviews.

01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:17.640
It's a good aggregate for like, you know, professional reviews, but

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:22.960
people want their voices heard and they're going to wait three days if they have to.

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:26.680
Or like I said, it's going to

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:29.400
it's going to make it not fun for them anymore having to wait.

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.640
And so there's not going to be any point in doing it.

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:36.680
Games do make so much of their buck right when they launch, though, you know,

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:41.480
like that that launch week, that launch day is so important that even delaying

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:44.800
that by three days might kind of sway things one way or another.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.680
I look a lot with Mass Effect Andromeda, I think is a good example of that,

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:52.200
because remember how like a lot of the negativity for that game,

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:55.520
which, you know, in retrospect may have been too much,

01:18:55.720 --> 01:19:00.120
really came out because it was released on that EA Access or whatever about three

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:03.720
days before the main might have been a little more like maybe like six or seven

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:08.960
days, but it came out a few days before it hit every other site.

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:13.240
And that's when people tore this game apart and we're showing off all the bugs

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:15.200
that hit social media and all this other stuff.

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:19.920
And it kind of did impact, I would say, how much that game sold on day one was

01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:25.760
because EA did that preview for their monthly whatever peoples.

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:28.200
And I don't think like,

01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:32.480
you know, my initial concern was that this is some other thing that they're going

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:36.360
to use, and when I say they, I mean, like the game industry is going to use

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:40.960
to try to hide negative reviews for, you know, legitimate stuff.

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:43.720
Like, for example, when they're adding loot boxes in, you know,

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:45.240
a lot of times you'll see these review

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:50.280
embargoes until, you know, the release date where they're hiding that stuff

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:53.160
in there so that people are unaware of it when they're making their purchases

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.320
or their preorders, when I don't think that's going to be

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:58.920
the case for this, I think it's more just to cut down on the garbage.

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:01.480
But you're just delaying the inevitable.

01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:05.360
And if people are going to complain about game or if there's like something that is

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:09.120
really wrong with something, there's plenty of other outlets to complain about that.

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:10.560
Yeah, you are right in that.

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:11.680
They're going to just go to Twitter.

01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:12.600
They're going to go to Facebook.

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.800
They're going to go to other social media platforms.

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:19.280
Twitter being the biggest one that comes to mind and and have their way there.

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:20.680
So

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:23.360
going to chat for some comments.

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:27.320
Quest Buster in chat says, I remember the early looks from Andromeda's

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:31.520
early access via EA Origins went viral over the flaws.

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:35.720
Yeah, that was that was a huge, huge, I think, faux pas to put.

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:39.920
I mean, it's a weird thing because I want to say it was really bad to put that out

01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:42.000
early so that all those bugs could be called out.

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:45.800
But at the same time, those bugs needed to be called out.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.320
That game was released half to bake, even though it was delayed a bunch of times.

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:52.440
It needed to be delayed one more time.

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:55.320
Cyberpunk has the right idea in that regard.

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:57.160
And, you know, if even though we can all

01:20:57.160 --> 01:21:00.880
look at cyberpunk and go, oh, God, they are delaying that game again.

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:02.520
Well, do you want it to be?

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:05.000
Do you want it to be Mass Effect Andromeda?

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:08.040
So, you know, they might have to delay it again.

01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:09.280
So.

01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:11.640
All right. Anyway, let's move on.

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:14.600
We have some more stories, Loki.

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:20.560
All right. So like most things are convention related,

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:23.680
everything's kind of gone to this whole digital equivalent.

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:27.680
And that's going to be the same thing that's going to happen to QuakeCon,

01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:30.160
which is held every year around August.

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:34.120
And so this year they're going to be doing in QuakeCon at Home 2020.

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:37.480
It's going to be set between August 7th and the 9th.

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:41.240
And they're going to have various events that are going to go along with that.

01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:43.240
So they're going to have the global super stream.

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:49.160
It's going to feature news and different updates about Bethesda products.

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:56.360
They're going to have the QuakeCon Pro League and QuakeCon World Championships.

01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:00.760
And yeah, they're also still having a prize pool up there.

01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:05.080
So $150,000 up for grabs.

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:08.480
I'm not really I mean.

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:09.520
It'll be neat.

01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:11.360
It's nice that they're going to be able

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:14.680
to carry on with this, even though they can't do an in-person event.

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.360
But

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:17.880
I don't know.

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:20.920
Not super excited about Bethesda these days.

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:24.440
I'm kind of like, let's see what the big news is that comes out about it.

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:27.680
You know, like if there's a new another Quake, I don't know.

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:31.320
What are we expecting that you're going to release another Quake game at some point?

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:34.280
Or is it still just about the champions game?

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.600
I don't know if there's any other news,

01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:41.240
although I do see here in this article, they're talking about some new T-shirts

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:43.120
and those look pretty nice.

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:48.480
Like they have the Dovahkin and there's the Caddo demon.

01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:50.840
But they're pretty cool.

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:52.880
I do still have a lot of love for classic

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:57.680
Quake, though, because I used to play that on LAN in college

01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:01.360
with friends who had high speed Internet at their university.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:04.280
And I would dial in and and play with them Quake.

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:05.120
We had a lot of fun with that.

01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:06.560
And I think that was I think we would do

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:09.600
Team Fortress 2 back in the because, you know, that's where Team Fortress started

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:12.040
was a Quake mod, so it's good.

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:15.040
So what other what the other thing that's kind of cool about this, too,

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.080
is there are live streams that they're going to be doing as well.

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:20.800
They're going to be donating the proceeds to those two different charities.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.040
So you have the Direct Relief UNICEF

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:26.640
for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the Trevor Project.

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:27.760
Cool.

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:30.520
And then they're also saying that you can

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:36.280
also donate as well to the Dallas Pet Alive and 4paws.

01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:37.120
Very cool.

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:41.080
I love that they're turning it into a charity thing at this point.

01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:42.520
So that's that's a good use.

01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:43.760
Great. Yeah.

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:45.360
All right. Let's move on.

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:49.600
And this this kind of falls in the whole like rumors category.

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:54.320
But there's there's a little there's a little smoke with this one

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:55.880
that shows there might be a little fire.

01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:59.880
And this has to do with some Twitter accounts that that were recently

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:03.120
registered and it appears they were registered by Nintendo.

01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:05.160
There was a Twitter account called

01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:11.000
at Super Mario 35th that was registered back in March of this year

01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:16.160
that somebody recently found and it looks like, oh, there might be something

01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:18.160
going on for Super Mario's 35th anniversary.

01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:23.840
We had heard we've heard earlier rumors that Nintendo plans to do like re releases

01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:27.120
of old Mario games this holiday and really kind of like, you know,

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:31.320
put out old Mario stuff again on the switch for this anniversary,

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:33.760
maybe like a souped up version of Mario 64, things like that.

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.280
Mario Sunshine might make a comeback.

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:37.120
We've heard these rumors before.

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:42.000
And now we see a Twitter account that kind of goes, oh, there might be something there.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.040
Who knows now?

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:46.360
A lot of you probably thinking what I first thought when I saw this is I was

01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:49.200
like, any idiot can roll a Twitter account with any name they want.

01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:53.040
But I didn't realize you could do this.

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:57.720
One thing you can do on Twitter is you can go in and you can request to reset your

01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:01.440
password. Well, I knew you could do that, but it actually shows you.

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:05.520
It says, like, you know, do you have your email address or whatever?

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:08.640
And it says email

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:09.880
with a link.

01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:13.720
So that would be the email that's tied to the Twitter account.

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:18.200
Well, while you can't see the whole email, it masks it for privacy reasons that,

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:21.840
you know, whoever you don't want to be given out, especially like celebrities,

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:24.360
like you don't want to know the email behind Lady Gaga's account.

01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:26.720
Right. That would be too much.

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:31.520
But what's interesting, it says email a link to it says ML and then a bunch of

01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:35.960
asterisks, like it's somebody's name at and

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:39.480
blank, blank, blank, blank, dot, blank, blank, dot, blank, blank,

01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:45.920
which is the perfect length for at Nintendo dot co dot JP.

01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:51.200
And what somebody noticed is that it is the same email link,

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:54.200
like the same like chain of letters as

01:25:54.400 --> 01:26:00.080
the official Splatoon JP account and the Smash Brothers JP account.

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:05.840
So it looks like this Super Mario thirty fifth may be something official.

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:09.760
But are you ready for the real whopper?

01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:12.840
Because that isn't the only Twitter account that was made.

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:15.440
There is another Twitter account that was made.

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:21.360
And that it is at we're finally going to make an F-Zero game.

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:26.040
It Loki, it is at F-Zero, JP is the other that is no joke.

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:28.880
That is the other that is the other Twitter account.

01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:30.320
Way to ruin my hype.

01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:31.200
It really is.

01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:36.240
OK, you know, I thought it was I thought it was a fucking joke, too.

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:39.760
And the same thing they went through and tried to reset the password.

01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:43.640
And it's the same link such and such at at like, like, like.

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:46.760
So F-Zero JP appears to be an account.

01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:50.400
Now, before we get too carried away, this could be a lot of things.

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:55.800
This could be just them protecting their IP, which Nintendo is notorious to do,

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.680
so that nobody else rolls this account.

01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:02.000
It could be maybe we get a re it doesn't necessarily mean a new F-Zero game.

01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:07.520
It could be a rerelease of F-Zero GX and AX, which I would be totally happy with.

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:10.280
To be quite honest, I'd be totally good with that.

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:13.400
It could be that. Who knows?

01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:16.200
You know, there was a lot of rumors.

01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:19.680
Again, now we're really going to the rumor farm, but whatever, who cares?

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:22.040
There was a lot of rumors

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:25.840
that one of the games that Nintendo bumped back from this holiday

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:29.720
that they've been working hard on was Mario Kart nine.

01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:32.800
What if and humor me for a minute here,

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.840
what if somewhere along the way, Mario Kart nine became a new F-Zero game?

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:41.880
I mean, there's enough.

01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:43.160
I don't see that.

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:46.440
Well, look at something like 250 CC, for God's sake.

01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:48.880
It plays pretty crazy fast and there's

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:54.160
perfectly competent F-Zero tracks and stuff in Mario Kart.

01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:57.360
Like maybe they decided to make Mario Kart

01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:00.760
nine an F-Zero game instead somewhere along the way.

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:05.520
Again, I completely realize I'm being tinfoil, hatty and

01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:09.200
you know, rumor mongering and all that stuff. Fine.

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:11.880
But this Twitter account is interesting.

01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:14.880
It does appear Nintendo did register it.

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:16.040
So

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:18.080
SDG100Matt says, don't do this.

01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:19.320
Don't mess with us like this.

01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:22.640
Sorry. Orange Right says, I'll believe it when I see it.

01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:24.720
Same at the end of the day.

01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:28.080
Zetenchant says in chat says too late.

01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:30.440
He opened the box. It can't be closed again.

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:32.240
Yeah, I went I went there.

01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:33.840
Sorry. I bought a house there.

01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:35.480
I live there.

01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:36.600
What can we do?

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:40.720
Hype Mayhem says Mario Kart versus F-Zero.

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:44.360
That I wouldn't get.

01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:48.520
I mean, in a way, you kind of already have that in Mario Kart eight,

01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:52.680
but a full on versus, that would be a little weird to me because, you know,

01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:56.480
F-Zero is supposed to be more science fictiony, but maybe maybe they're going

01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:58.640
to take it in a cartoony direction. I don't know.

01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:02.320
It's too early to say we have a fucking Twitter account and nothing else.

01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:04.640
I just need Nintendo to have a direct already.

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:08.040
I think that's what we all want, but we'll see.

01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:09.520
Who knows?

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:11.200
All right.

01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:12.600
Whoo. All right.

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:16.360
Anyhow, enough of rumors with that, but that one got me really excited.

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:19.360
I'm still laughing that you kind of ruined the punch line there.

01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:21.640
Loki would like, oh, what's it going to be, a new F-Zero?

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:24.040
Well, actually.

01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.400
Well, actually.

01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:28.760
All right, anyway, Dark Sakura,

01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:32.760
you have another story for us before we get to our classic segment.

01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:34.080
I do.

01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:35.760
I think so about.

01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:37.000
Yeah, yeah, I do.

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:40.840
Sorry, I was used to going right into my classic game.

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.680
So, yeah, anyway.

01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:49.120
There is a Twitch streamer who built a computer inside of a video game

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:55.640
and it was done in let's see, it was.

01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:59.400
Oh, my gosh, why can't I read so anyway,

01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:02.840
a person named Tyler Hill built a reduced

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:08.840
instruction set computer RSC inside of another sandbox adventure game called

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:10.640
Astroneer.

01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:15.280
He is kind of known for trying to build computers inside of video games.

01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:18.400
So he actually posted it.

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:20.120
There's a link on Twitter to it.

01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:23.800
And he did a demo.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.600
It's actually out there public.

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:28.880
And he actually even explained how he did it.

01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:32.640
So it looks like it's really just like a huge countdown.

01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:36.520
So it's basically just very optimized

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:39.840
instructions, given a place to live in this game.

01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:42.240
So I thought it was pretty cool.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:49.840
But at any rate, yeah, it's it's it's a program ception, game ception,

01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:51.640
compu ception.

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:55.360
No, it's that they built they built a game inside a game.

01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:57.800
More like a counter inside a game.

01:30:57.840 --> 01:30:59.960
But still, it's computing within computing.

01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:01.360
Yeah, no, I think that's super cool.

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:05.040
Like, it makes me think of people that when they're like an emulator built

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:06.840
in Minecraft or something like that, I want to I don't know.

01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:09.600
I might be just making shit up.

01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:11.680
Gameboy emulator, I think at one time.

01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:13.080
OK, so that's that's pretty cool.

01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:15.040
But the fact that somebody kind of broke

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:18.360
it down even to like what a computer's kind of like bare roots are,

01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:19.320
I think that's pretty cool.

01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:21.040
And I love that they streamed it, too,

01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:25.240
so that you can actually go back and learn something, so to speak.

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:27.120
So cool.

01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:27.920
All right.

01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:32.840
Well, now I suppose we can take a step back and take a look at Dark Sakura's

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:38.720
classic game of the week every week here on Orange on Tradio.

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:42.400
Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey,

01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:45.080
you brats ought to be checking this game out this week.

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:49.680
But once a month in the year 2020, she, instead of spotlighting a classic

01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:54.080
video game, likes to spotlight a classic pinball table.

01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:57.600
And what is the table going to be this week?

01:31:57.800 --> 01:32:02.920
I'm doing one that we're borrowing right now that is very stiff.

01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:06.880
And I'm doing this in honor of the new

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:10.320
Sternbell Vira game that's coming out that.

01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:13.680
Oh, my gosh, Rob, if you haven't seen it,

01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:16.080
it's it's pretty, pretty cool.

01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:17.760
It's a

01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:20.520
got one of the video screens and everything.

01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:25.000
And it plays back like old black and white B movies while she does

01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:28.080
commentary on it, Elvira's House of Horrors.

01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:30.360
But we're not talking about the new pinball.

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:32.160
We're talking about the old pinball.

01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:33.960
So

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:37.640
scared stiff came out in 1996.

01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:42.680
It was designed by Dennis Nordman, released by Midway as Bally.

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:46.120
And it features Elvira, the actress of the dark.

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:48.600
And it's the follow up to 1989's

01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:52.080
Elvira and the Party Monsters was also designed by Nordman.

01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:55.520
Now, the reason I didn't go with the one

01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:59.920
in 1989 because I'm pretty much doing 90s and up for pinball.

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:03.520
I'm basically picking where we started getting the DMDs and everything.

01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:08.640
So not any of the little ticker bars like Black Knight, the one before was very much

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:11.920
like the same type of scoring like Black Knight did.

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:15.720
But anyway, the game, of course, has a B movie horror thing.

01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:18.280
You have to go through tales of terror

01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:23.800
to level up on the Stiff-O-Meter and you have Eyes of the Boating Beast,

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.880
Terror from the Crate, The Stiff in the Coffin, The Monster's Lab,

01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:31.440
Night of the Leapers, and Return of the Deadheads.

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:37.240
You also have an interactive back box that has a spinning slider,

01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:41.800
sorry, a spinning spider, my gosh, and you use it to collect different

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:45.720
features and start special modes, and it uses the DSC sound system.

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:47.440
It was

01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:56.920
one of those games that when they did the exhibition at the 1996 AMOA show,

01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:00.520
Miss Cassandra Peterson showed up as Elvira to promote the game.

01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:02.200
Pretty cool.

01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:07.160
Now, it was supposed to have these little rubber bogeyman features,

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:10.760
slingshots that were supposed to move forward with the kicker.

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:15.480
It was when you hit the slingshot and the ROM still allows the bogeyman to dance

01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:18.800
with the music from the bogeyman boogie mode,

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.600
but they removed it late in production because the arms were,

01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:26.160
they thought they were going to break off

01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:29.920
because there's an opening between the slingshot plastics

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:33.040
that's actually still present that you can

01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:36.800
go in and there's even something about it in the game's manual.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.560
So since the code is still there,

01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:42.720
people have added the bogeyman modifications back to their games.

01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:44.880
You can buy them

01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:50.120
at freeplayamusements.com, it looks like.

01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:53.560
Or you can look for them at Robertwinter.com.

01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:58.040
I think it's supposed to be re-release, he's re-releasing them.

01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:00.880
But at any rate, going now to the specifics

01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:06.400
from IPMD, the Internet Involved Machine Database,

01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:09.360
it

01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:13.640
actually is a really amazing machine.

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:17.720
You can look at all the specifications on it there, the back glasses screen.

01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:22.920
I think what I linked was a pinball arcade or something like that.

01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:25.120
But the game's really, really super fun.

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:30.360
And, you know, it's got a great theme because Elvira is just absolutely hilarious.

01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:36.080
She is a queen, she is a drag queen, and she did it perfectly before

01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:40.600
a lot of our modern queens owe their stuff to Elvira, I'm just saying.

01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:44.440
But at any rate, it's really amazing.

01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:49.040
If you never have played it, you need to find it.

01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:53.560
And there's another note that there's a skull pile in the upper right corner

01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:58.800
of the play field that do not have light up eyes in the production games.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.360
So if you see any games that have LEDs in the skull, this is after Factory,

01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:05.600
as were, of course, the bogeyman characters.

01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:07.640
So there you go.

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:14.840
The classic game of September 1996 is Scared Stiff by Bally Midway.

01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:18.520
And one of my very favorite tables as well, because I love Elvira.

01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:22.040
How can you not? Decontaminate yourself from play.

01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:23.480
I know, right?

01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:27.240
So I've been stuck in this house since March.

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:28.440
Haven't been able to do anything.

01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:32.440
If you haven't been around other people for two weeks and you're not sick.

01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:34.440
There's that whole thing that happened with my dad.

01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:37.560
So technically, I'm not at two weeks out, you know, so.

01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:39.720
But at any rate, see, listen to us.

01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:42.480
We're being responsible.

01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:45.480
We quarantine before we make any plans.

01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:47.960
And it's all masks all the time.

01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:52.720
So speaking of which, I'm putting my mask back on.

01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:55.080
Oh, yes. I can go back on camera.

01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:59.480
Because you're about to bid us adieu tonight, right?

01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:02.280
All right.

01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:04.120
I forgot the song.

01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:05.640
Crap. Oh, well.

01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:09.560
And you don't forget, your mic gets really quiet when you have that mask on.

01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:11.240
I know. Here, I'll put it under.

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:13.440
Oh, it's in my mouth now.

01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:21.360
All right. I'm filling this with rosemary and rose petals.

01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:25.360
So it's Rose Rosemary or maybe Rosemary Rose.

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:31.280
I am coming to stick the cocaine in you and use my leeches to get rid of the nasty

01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:33.560
humors that are causing your illness.

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:35.280
Oh,

01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:38.280
beautiful. Thank you so much.

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:41.280
So my Oscar pitch,

01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:42.880
it's in the mail.

01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:47.480
Anyway, I know you have to bid us adieu, but take care.

01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:48.320
Thank you for being here.

01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:51.280
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:53.240
They'll be stupid.

01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:54.680
Good advice. Thank you.

01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:56.960
I'll take that to heart. Wear your mask.

01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:58.920
Wash your hands.

01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:02.560
If you've been around people for any reason, take two weeks to decontaminate.

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:03.800
Make sure you're not sick.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.880
Oh, and good news, my mom does not have the COVID.

01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:10.320
I totally forgot to ask you that question on air, but I know you told me that off

01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:11.560
air, but yeah, great.

01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:12.680
Thank you for confirming.

01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:14.160
Does not have the COVID.

01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:16.280
So that's good news.

01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:17.720
Hope she feels better nonetheless,

01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:20.600
because obviously whatever she has is pretty shitty like a flu or something.

01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:24.360
But I sent her I sent her vitamins and feel good stuff.

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:25.920
So I'll check on her.

01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:30.200
But everybody be smart, take care of yourself.

01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:32.680
Be healthy, be safe and be intelligent.

01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:36.360
All right. Because if you're not, I'll make fun of you and then stay, you know,

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:38.520
miles away from you. All right.

01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:40.400
With love. Sounds good.

01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:42.200
Take care, Jamie.

01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:43.600
Bye. Bye.

01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:47.080
All right. We're going to move on with rapid fire news.

01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:48.560
Logie.

01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:52.520
You want to unmute yourself, Logie?

01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:54.400
It would be easier to hear you. I want to do that.

01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:56.160
Yes. Yes, very good.

01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:00.760
So apparently there's been a lot of people upset with the fact

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:04.440
that Rockstar Games hasn't updated Red Dead Online in a while.

01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:08.320
So they haven't had a major update in over seven months,

01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:11.880
with the last one being in December of last year.

01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:19.000
And so to kind of protest that the users online have been dressing like clowns.

01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:24.320
So they're bringing in the clowns to protest the fact that

01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:26.120
this isn't a joke to them.

01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:31.760
I think that's funny because the whole clown clownery is kind of like a meme online.

01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:34.640
And so there's all sorts of, like, clown memes out there.

01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:37.080
You know, when you do clownery, the clown come back to bite,

01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:38.280
you know, those sorts of things.

01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:41.000
So I love that they're actually, like, dressing.

01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:43.640
Like, how big of a clown can you be in Red Dead?

01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:46.840
Like, can you full on, like, red nose Hong Kong?

01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:51.360
You can do some pretty decent clown makeup in there, at least.

01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:55.880
Yeah, it looks period accurate clowning.

01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:58.000
All right. Pure clownery.

01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:01.560
So that's what they're doing to protest that.

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:03.120
Which, yeah, I mean, I get it.

01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:04.560
Maybe they just don't make this.

01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:07.800
Rockstar is probably not bringing as much money with Red Dead Online,

01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:12.240
but they've never really kind of given it the same attention as Grand Theft Auto 5

01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:13.760
or Grand Theft Auto Online.

01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:15.280
So,

01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:18.960
yeah, you get what you put into it, I guess.

01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:20.680
Yeah, for sure.

01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:26.800
And then more movie news coming out and just as crazy as some of these other movie

01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:29.600
ideas that they've had with, like, the Saints Row movie and stuff.

01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:32.440
This was another one that I would definitely want to see.

01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:33.720
Just Cause.

01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:38.080
So Just Cause has finally secured a director,

01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:42.920
Mike Douse, who I guess he had shot, let's see,

01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:48.320
a metal mockumentary FUBAR, the F word, some episodes for that.

01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:53.720
And, of course, the show that's on, I think, Hulu right now, Future Man.

01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:55.400
And then they have Preacher.

01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:58.680
So I don't see necessarily a lot of movie stuff there.

01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:03.080
But yeah, if they can keep it as crazy

01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:09.000
as the game, then I'm all in because that game is absolutely nuts.

01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:12.640
Sounds like something up your alley.

01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:14.600
Oh, yeah. All right.

01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:15.720
Crazy.

01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:18.000
Moving on, some other rapid fire news.

01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:22.560
For those of you guys that don't like to download your games or buy them online

01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:26.680
and you prefer to install them the old fashioned way and talking about PC games,

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:30.520
you have quite the option for Microsoft Flight Simulator.

01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:33.640
You can actually buy a version of Microsoft Flight Simulator,

01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:40.280
which is a 90 gigabyte game that will actually come on ten different DVDs.

01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:42.640
That's right. Ten different DVDs.

01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:44.120
Because apparently, and Jason was kind

01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:46.480
of hinting at this in the intro a little bit for tonight's show.

01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:50.200
Apparently, a lot of computers don't actually have Blu-ray players in them.

01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:52.160
DVDs a little more standard, not to say.

01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:54.760
I mean, I'm sure many of you in chat are like mine as a Blu-ray player.

01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:55.960
Yeah, some of them do.

01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:59.120
But because Blu-ray didn't really catch on as like a standard for digital medium,

01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:01.800
I think a lot more computers kind of have DVD built in.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.000
And Flight Simulator is one of those games.

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:07.800
I mean, it's truly for people of all ages.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.680
But there is like an older audience,

01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:15.960
especially retired pilots and older folks

01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:19.120
that maybe don't actually get to get out and fly like a regular plane.

01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:24.400
I would say that Microsoft Flight Simulator is actually has a good sales

01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:30.280
block from this group of probably older folks who don't do the steam

01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:32.880
and the online stuff, who have to do something a little more.

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:34.920
And I'm using my quote fingers old fashioned.

01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:39.000
And so installing from the DVDs might be the way to do it.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.120
So it actually, you know, as much we're kind of like laughing at it,

01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:44.320
because like 10 DVDs to play one game, that's crazy.

01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:46.160
Although, you know, back in the day,

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:49.000
I remember when it was those three and a half inch floppies.

01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:54.640
And I think it was like King's Quest five or six was on like 14 disks to install.

01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:57.960
Well, I mean, a gigantic game that would take a long time.

01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:01.600
But hey, I mean, if you're strapped for bandwidth, you know,

01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:06.560
and that's 90 gigs that you don't have to download or you you live in a place

01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:10.480
like Alaska or something that doesn't have, you know, well, obviously,

01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:12.080
if you live in like Juneau or one of the big cities.

01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:15.800
But, you know, again, if you're a retired pilot, chances are you probably live

01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:18.080
somewhere pretty remote on your nice little ranch somewhere.

01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:21.120
And you may not have that kind of Internet, you know.

01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:24.080
Yeah, yeah. So I think I think it's really interesting.

01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:27.240
So they say the simulator is 100 percent the same.

01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:29.280
The box retail version just has a nice

01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:32.600
box and about 90 gigs that you don't have to download.

01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:34.640
There's no difference between box retail

01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:37.120
and the version that Microsoft sells directly.

01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:39.000
It's kind of kind of interesting.

01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:43.040
But yeah, I think this is really to address like an older audience that wouldn't

01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:46.360
necessarily buy a lot of other games, so to speak.

01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:49.040
And SGA 100 Matt says, Where is Legend of Zaku?

01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:52.360
He's the flight simulator buff, but also an excellent example of the fact

01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:57.240
that when I say like the older audience is an audience, it's clearly not the only

01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:00.360
audience, Zaku is not over the age of 65.

01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:02.960
In fact, he's quite younger than I am and enjoys flight simulators.

01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:06.920
There's people that enjoy flight sims of all ages, of course.

01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:10.880
And so there's many people that will just do the 90 gigabyte download, I'm sure.

01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:14.400
I just think it is kind of interesting that a game like this kind of has to still do

01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:20.680
an old fashioned, so to speak, route, probably for a certain chunk of its audience.

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:24.880
So TigerClanChat says, Imagine how many floppies this game would take.

01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:28.120
Yeah, but counterpoint, as fun as that is

01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:31.960
to imagine how many computers actually have floppy drives anymore.

01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:34.840
I remember it was like an ingress thing or something.

01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:37.800
Something happened where like there was a three and a half inch floppy.

01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:40.280
Somebody found and I think it was an ingress thing.

01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:41.960
We had to get the contents of the disk.

01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:46.160
Nobody on the team had a fucking three and a half inch floppy drive.

01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:48.240
Nobody had a drive to do it.

01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:52.680
Like, so now to find a working floppy drive is actually a challenge.

01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:56.240
And again, I'm sure there's somebody in chat that's going to go, I've got one.

01:44:56.440 --> 01:45:00.560
It works. OK, but you do realize you're one of only a few.

01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:03.920
And they have USB.

01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:09.840
Like, it's very easy to find, like a USB, $20, like floppy drive type of thing

01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:14.440
so that people can get old pictures and old media and things like that.

01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:16.240
There's certainly plenty of uses for it.

01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:19.720
But I think we all know that isn't common.

01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:25.160
DVD drives are common now in computers and have been for over 10 years,

01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:28.880
probably more like 15 years, probably even longer than that shit.

01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:31.960
Probably closer to 20 years in computers.

01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:34.680
So, yeah.

01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:38.840
Anyway, looking in chat, Tigerclass says, I bet you can find on eBay.

01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:42.160
Of course, S2100Matt says, yeah, Newegg has a bunch.

01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:43.040
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:45.320
Again, I'm not saying these things don't exist.

01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:48.920
I'm just saying they're not common in computers anymore.

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:50.720
And that was the idea behind this was

01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:54.760
how do we what is common in computers if somebody doesn't have the right Internet?

01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:59.000
Now, PodCulture in chat says, wonder why they couldn't go USB.

01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:01.120
Even old computers have that.

01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:03.120
That's actually a good question.

01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:07.480
It's probably cheaper to actually do the 10 DVDs.

01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:13.800
It's cheaper to press this than it is to purchase a USB and have that available.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.240
Some of those USB sticks, though, are pretty.

01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:20.200
But maybe a 32 and a 64 would still be pretty cheap.

01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:22.880
Once you start to go past that, it probably gets a little more pricey.

01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:24.160
And it probably isn't, you know.

01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:26.400
But for a collector's edition or

01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:29.200
something, I don't think PodCulture's idea is necessarily bad.

01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:30.840
No, it's not a terrible idea.

01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:34.280
I don't think they want to spend that money,

01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:40.000
whereas it costs since to press a disk, so I don't know.

01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:41.360
And even on top of that,

01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:44.440
even after you've installed everything off that disk, you still have to download

01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:49.640
updates that are significantly large.

01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:51.560
Now, DJ Rama S. brings up a good point

01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:53.280
saying, interesting that you discussed this.

01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:56.680
I'm looking to buy a new computer case to rebuild my PC into.

01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:01.760
And 90 percent of cases out there don't support spaces for DVD or Blu-ray drives.

01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:03.880
Well, now it's the opposite problem.

01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:05.200
Why should they?

01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:08.920
What what what even comes out on DVD and Blu-ray anymore?

01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:11.960
Microsoft Flight Simulator.

01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:14.640
Well, you can always just get a USB drive.

01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:17.680
I mean, that's what you're and

01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:21.080
there's a great application of PodCulture's idea.

01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:23.440
It's a USB drive now.

01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:26.480
No, I mean like a USB DVD drive.

01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:28.000
Oh, yeah, no pleasure.

01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:33.160
My first my first CD burner was an external that was through USB.

01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:33.880
You remember that?

01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:37.360
Because I think it was on the O.L.R. computer, the one in the garage for a while.

01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:44.600
My first CD was it my first CD drive was a SCSI and an external SCSI card.

01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:46.520
Now, so that was fun.

01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:48.760
I remember my old work,

01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:51.800
who remembers these?

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:58.080
I used to have the zip drive at work, which was those gigantic fucking disks.

01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:00.840
Was it 100 megs that they held or 100 gigs?

01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:02.880
It was 100 megs.

01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:05.040
And so, yes.

01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:10.600
So previously I used to have a pretty decent Internet.

01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:12.320
This is back when I was on like dial up.

01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:15.400
So I had decent Internet, like.

01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:23.440
At work, so I used to put on zip disk.

01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:24.600
Not everybody knows this,

01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:27.560
but I used to do light publishing work like way back in the day.

01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:31.360
And so some of the layouts, they were too big for a normal disk.

01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:33.240
And this zip drive was like maybe like

01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:36.280
two years before, like CD burners were commonplace.

01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:39.640
So we actually had the zip drive thing and I used to used to save it to a zip

01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:42.760
drive and FedEx it to the main office to be in the magazine.

01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:44.160
That's how we would send the files back

01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:48.640
and forth, because you couldn't like 100 make you couldn't send a print layout.

01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:53.280
It was way too big of a file, but like the drive was like the perfect media for it.

01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:57.680
And then before zip drives, it used to be zipping it up and disk

01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:02.800
spanning, which, oh, God, and I would do that with like 50 days.

01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:03.880
Oh, yeah. With shareware.

01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:05.200
Yeah. Hell yeah.

01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:09.560
Not necessarily shareware with step files.

01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:10.880
Oh, God.

01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:12.880
All right.

01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:14.640
I love that.

01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:17.360
We got to move on. We still got more show to cover here.

01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:19.640
And let's talk about EA.

01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:25.680
EA is going to remove the Washington football team's name in Madden 21.

01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:28.560
I'm sure you guys all heard the Washington team.

01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:30.400
This is how much I follow sports.

01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:32.360
Everybody, you ready? You all ready to make fun of me?

01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:37.120
SSG one hundred. Matt, you got your popcorn ready up until this week.

01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:38.840
I always thought when they were talking

01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:43.040
about the Washington football team, it was Washington State.

01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:46.920
I thought they were in like Spokane or something.

01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:52.280
I did not realize until this week that that team was a Washington DC team.

01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:54.720
That's how much I follow football.

01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:58.200
I'm so embarrassed, but also not like come on.

01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:02.160
But yeah, so that team, as you know, is changing their name.

01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:04.480
We don't know what the new name is going to be yet.

01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:06.720
But Madden 21 has already responded.

01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:09.280
EA saying they're going to make some changes there.

01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:12.000
So they will have that fixed in Madden 21.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.480
I imagine that's going to be in a patch

01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:16.560
maybe because Madden 21 comes out on August 25th.

01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:18.920
So it's very likely it's already gone gold.

01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:19.880
I don't know.

01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:24.640
But there will be a generic Washington name and logo first and then they will

01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:26.920
patch in whatever is decided later on.

01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:32.120
So I think it's just going to be Washington with no name and like a W on

01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:36.280
the hat or something, and then they will patch in whatever they actually decide to

01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:39.720
do when that's all figured out. So there you go.

01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:41.800
And I got to look at chat and see if there's any comments.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.640
SGA 100 Matt says, actually, that's not that bad.

01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:47.960
Oh, thank you. You all are so nice.

01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:50.280
SGA 100 Matt says, although the last

01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:54.120
Magfest you were at, Rob, that football team took up part of the hotel.

01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:57.520
I didn't even realize.

01:50:57.720 --> 01:50:59.200
You say that it makes sense.

01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:01.040
But anyway,

01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:06.520
Bobby Black Wolf says the Onion had a great article about how they were finally

01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:11.080
changing the offensive part of their name and changing their name to the DC.

01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:13.880
Old name. This is funny.

01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:15.240
All right.

01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:19.040
Moving on, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:20.680
I need to step away real quick.

01:51:20.680 --> 01:51:23.240
Loki, I'm going to do Japanese releases first, if you don't mind.

01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:25.120
So that gives you a nice little buffer time there.

01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:28.720
All right. So let me do the Japanese releases real quick here.

01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:30.960
So coming out in Japan this week,

01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:34.840
first off on the Nintendo Switch coming out,

01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:38.720
I think Call of Cthulhu is the only game this week on the Nintendo Switch.

01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:40.400
That is coming out on the twenty third.

01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:45.880
And then on the PlayStation four this week over in Japan,

01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:49.720
Sengoku Basara for Sumer Gari.

01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:52.000
And that's a anniversary edition.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.960
So that is a price reduction of a game from Capcom.

01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:59.120
I'm trying to see if this is one that I recognized.

01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:02.760
Sengoku Basara is this.

01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:07.320
This is Dynasty Warriors, no, because they don't count as make that game.

01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:12.240
It's it's like Dynasty Warriors, it's Capcom's version of that.

01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:14.320
Yeah, I can't remember the name of it here.

01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:18.800
I'm sure somebody in chat will type in all the things for Sara here.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.200
They call it that here.

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:23.720
They gave it a different name on the like it was on the Wii or

01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:27.200
something or maybe it was around the time that we was around.

01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:30.440
They call it something different, but I don't remember what it was.

01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:33.880
But I think they still call it Sengoku Basara.

01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:35.200
Gotcha. All right.

01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:38.040
I will be right back, Loki.

01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:40.360
OK, let's see.

01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:44.400
So in the U.S., we've got a few things coming out this week.

01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:47.840
So Rock of Ages three, make and break on PC,

01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:53.600
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, Xbox one and Stadia carry on,

01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:55.440
which is from Devolver Digital.

01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:59.160
That's going to be on PC, Nintendo Switch and Xbox one.

01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:02.920
Crisis remastered on Nintendo Switch,

01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:08.000
Tannenberg on PlayStation four and Xbox one.

01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:12.440
And last but not least this week,

01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:15.440
actually, that would be last and not least.

01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:17.480
So Tannenberg it is.

01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:21.120
And then we've got for the UK,

01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:25.680
New Super Lucky's Tale on PlayStation four

01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:31.760
and Human Fall Flat on PlayStation four, Nintendo Switch and Xbox one.

01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:34.880
And then finally,

01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:37.280
that's it, I guess. Very limited.

01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:39.000
Lots of stuff coming out next week, though.

01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:44.040
I've got Destroy All Humans or the week after next Destroy All Humans with that remake.

01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:46.480
And it's been a while since I played that.

01:53:46.680 --> 01:53:50.760
They'll be coming out on consoles very soon.

01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:56.040
And until then, I guess we can talk about Minecraft since Rob's not here.

01:53:56.240 --> 01:54:00.240
So as you see, like this video that's

01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:05.360
been playing in the very background here of my image, it's actually a survival server

01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:09.240
that we've been doing for about four months, I think, because we did have

01:54:09.240 --> 01:54:13.080
a world that started off with my kids, but we finished that very fast

01:54:13.080 --> 01:54:16.280
because they wanted to kind of cheat their way through everything and finally

01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:20.480
convinced them again to start from scratch and not cheat.

01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:24.360
So we've been doing that for a while, finally finished

01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:28.160
taking on pretty much all the challenges of this.

01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:32.520
The last thing we have to do is actually the woodland mansion.

01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:36.960
But we did the sea or was it the ocean monuments?

01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:40.160
We did two of those yesterday.

01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:45.680
And so I'd actually physically take took down one whole monument.

01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:48.640
And I'm going to turn the other one into a guardian spawner.

01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:50.480
So that'd be fun. I'm back.

01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:52.520
Thank you for buying time.

01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:54.040
No, that's good.

01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:55.400
That's no, that's good. That's good.

01:54:55.400 --> 01:54:57.320
I can hear on my monitor here, so that's good.

01:54:57.320 --> 01:54:58.320
All right, awesome.

01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:00.240
We're going to go to the mailbag.

01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:04.560
So every week you guys send us emails, participate at orangelandradio.com

01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:07.120
and we read some of our favorites here on the show.

01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:10.240
So we have a couple of emails here tonight and we're going to start tonight

01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:14.920
with an email from good old YYR, creator of such

01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:17.800
classic games available on Steam,

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:22.240
such as multi super multitasking,

01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:24.320
such as names that escape me in the moment,

01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:28.160
Sharpshooter, Bungee Ferret tossing, although that's not on Steam right now.

01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:32.160
But it's, you know, check out his site, YYRgames.com.

01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:33.200
It goes over everything.

01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:36.520
Hello, LR. Towards the end of the July 5th show,

01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:40.280
you mentioned DDR A20 Plus, new level check feature.

01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:43.480
I find it to be one of the really interesting additions to this new version.

01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:45.320
So I figured I'd explain how it works.

01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:49.240
This special stage will begin playing automatically if the first stage has

01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:54.360
failed and if at least one player has never passed a level seven or higher song

01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:57.240
or did not log in with the amusement pass.

01:55:57.440 --> 01:55:59.920
The machine will proclaim, let's see your moves.

01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:03.200
And we'll begin playing one of A20 certified bangers.

01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:05.880
This beat is with a special chart.

01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:10.240
This full length chart starts off very easy, which is occasional simple steps,

01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:12.720
but ramps up in difficulty as you play,

01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:16.320
testing you with jumps, free zeros and some mix ups.

01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:18.840
If you miss 20 steps, you will fail out.

01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:21.640
But the other player can keep going if they're doing better.

01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:25.200
Just as with the tutorial, you can also choose to skip this stage entirely

01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:27.280
by pressing the green button on the machine.

01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:31.440
If you don't skip, then you'll get a results screen after the stage is played

01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:35.920
and it'll show a recommended level for each player between one and six

01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:39.520
or simply over six if you aced it.

01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:40.920
That's a pun.

01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:43.760
It will also show some chart recommendations,

01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:47.080
but since it only picks from default songs added to A20,

01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:50.200
plus the pool it picks from is rather small.

01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:52.680
Finally, if at least one player logged

01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:55.400
in with their amusement pass and premium play was used,

01:56:55.600 --> 01:56:59.640
the game will proceed to the second stage as usual because three songs are guaranteed.

01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:01.760
If not, the game ends there and you'll have

01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:04.040
to play again if you want to try the recommendations.

01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:05.640
Still, I think it's nice that you get

01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:08.360
to play a bit longer if you bomb out of the first song.

01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:11.000
Yeah, it's one of those things where like now that you're explaining it,

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.800
I'm like, damn, that would have been awesome in DDR back in the day.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:19.320
Like a song to measure like this is the level of song you should be trying right now.

01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:23.680
Why don't they should put that in like BeatMania 2DX and there are other games

01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:28.320
which I realize, man, I wish we had BeatMania 2DX at home.

01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:31.720
I so wish we had that, but I guess that's another story.

01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:32.760
All right.

01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:35.000
Anyway, I'm actually taking a peek at chat real quick.

01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:37.440
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, oh, that sounds cool.

01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:40.800
Hopefully, if we ever get out of this COVID thing and I can find a machine,

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
I'll definitely play some A20 plus.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:43.800
Yeah, for sure.

01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:45.920
That's where I'm at, too, is it's like, all right.

01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:47.600
Any day when COVID is done.

01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:49.000
OK.

01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:51.880
Moving on

01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:53.680
to the rest of that email.

01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:55.320
I didn't finish the email.

01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:59.800
It seems that this feature is intended for brand new players who have no idea what

01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:02.400
to pick and wind up choosing something too difficult.

01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:06.000
Unfortunately, this is also the sort of player who typically walks off after

01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:07.800
the first song, whether they pass or not.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:08.920
Oh, well.

01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:11.360
Before I go, I want to mention an interesting

01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:13.680
bit of news that may or may not have made the show roll.

01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:17.760
It appears that as of today, it is no longer possible to purchase a 12 month

01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:21.120
Xbox Live Gold subscription digitally, which, of course, we did talk about at

01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:23.640
the beginning of the show, but let's get YYR's thoughts.

01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:27.360
The one month and three month options remain and their prices are unchanged,

01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:31.160
but the 12 month options vanished entirely from the Xbox dashboard.

01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:35.720
Immediately, I thought of Rob's past speculation that Microsoft may choose

01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:38.320
to make online player free in the future,

01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:43.160
or this may just be a heavy handed way to steer folks towards Game Pass Ultimate.

01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:46.680
But if they want to really make headlines on the Series X launches,

01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:50.040
dropping paid online multiplayer would be one way to do it.

01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:51.280
What do you think?

01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:55.520
Well, I think I made my thoughts on this at the beginning of the show known,

01:58:55.720 --> 01:59:01.600
but I appreciate you because you've been a big Microsoft guy for a while now.

01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:04.200
I know in the early days and I didn't even own an Xbox one.

01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:09.320
You're kind of sometimes setting our path right on some assumptions we made about

01:59:09.320 --> 01:59:10.920
the system that we weren't always right about.

01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:16.440
So the fact that I know you're kind of coming to the same conclusion that my

01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:20.880
crazy speculation did a few years ago is actually oddly comforting.

01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:22.400
So we'll see what becomes of it.

01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:24.080
And that's what I think.

01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:28.040
Anyway, thanks again for putting the show together and have another great week.

01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:31.400
Wishing he could actually go play DDR without risking his life.

01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:34.480
Aaron Yyr. Same, same.

01:59:34.680 --> 01:59:38.840
And I really hope we get to the other side of this before too long.

01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:40.120
Anyway,

01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:43.680
there is some pretty exciting stuff, speaking of DDR,

01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:46.760
that I saw on Twitter this week.

01:59:46.960 --> 01:59:52.360
So there's been a lot of development in producing a DDR omni mix,

01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:57.560
which is basically hacking the old System 573 mixes

01:59:57.760 --> 02:00:00.200
to put whatever songs you want on there.

02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:05.480
And pretty exciting stuff I saw where they've mixed up the song list to add

02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:10.040
stuff that's been taken out of Extreme and removing other songs like Let Them Move.

02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:12.240
And

02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:17.440
yeah, very exciting to see where that goes, since I have a modded system to do that.

02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:21.760
Of course, I also have set mania, so it's kind of irrelevant, but still would be neat.

02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:22.680
That's still neat.

02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:24.840
I'd be curious to see where that goes. Cool.

02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:28.360
All right. We have one more email tonight from AJ Twist.

02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:32.480
I haven't heard this name in the email bag for a long time, so good to have you back.

02:00:32.680 --> 02:00:35.320
AJ Twist emails us saying, Good evening, OLR.

02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:38.120
Long time listener. Third time writer.

02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:40.720
I know you've written us before, but all right.

02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:44.440
I've had an itch for a new music rhythm game for a while now.

02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:46.080
We've got a lot of music stories tonight.

02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:47.480
I don't mind.

02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:53.760
A few months ago, I saw someone streaming Spin Rhythm XD and had to try it out.

02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:56.160
It almost plays like DJ Hero.

02:00:56.360 --> 02:00:57.800
It was $15 on Steam.

02:00:57.840 --> 02:00:59.640
I'm not sure if it's available anywhere else.

02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:02.880
It seems you can use almost anything for a controller.

02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:04.440
The button options are pretty wide.

02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:07.160
You can play it with keyboard and mouse or a controller.

02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:10.480
The craziest thing is the ability to use a midi turntable to play.

02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:11.360
Well, that's pretty cool.

02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:13.840
The game is not as polished as DJ Hero.

02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:17.000
It almost has this frequency amplitude look, in my opinion.

02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:18.960
It's a great game and has great music.

02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:20.720
Ten out of ten recommend.

02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:23.560
Have any of you heard of it or played it? AJ Twist.

02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:26.200
I must admit, I'm going to open this.

02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:27.600
I have not, AJ Twist.

02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:30.040
I'm going to open it to chat to see if there's any further opinions.

02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:32.120
Spin Rhythm XD.

02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:33.200
Yeah, I've heard of it.

02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:34.200
Oh, you have heard of it?

02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:35.320
It's on my wish list.

02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:38.120
I just haven't bothered to buy it because I know I'm not going to actually play any of it.

02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:40.680
But yeah, it looks pretty cool.

02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:45.920
I think it does work with the DJ Hero controllers, too, if you have that in there.

02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:51.360
But yeah, pretty much any sort of like midi or just any sort of like

02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:55.240
turntable or dial or something that you use it because the way that works,

02:01:55.240 --> 02:01:57.440
there's like an actual

02:01:57.640 --> 02:02:01.440
a bar that basically you're just moving back and forth between the different

02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:06.120
lanes in there and you can, you know, spin everything around and stuff.

02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:07.160
It looks pretty cool.

02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:09.600
I just think that

02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:11.400
probably wouldn't play it.

02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:12.480
I'll have to check it out.

02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:13.520
I almost picked it up in the last sale.

02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:15.800
I'm very curious about the music because

02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:18.600
I imagine a fifteen dollar game probably didn't license music.

02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:21.080
So it probably is more like twenty bucks right now.

02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:22.560
So, I mean, it's...

02:02:22.760 --> 02:02:24.760
Did they license music or is it original artists?

02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:27.000
Not that that's bad, but

02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:30.680
part of part of what made DJ Hero very

02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:36.120
appealing was that the mashup mixes were A plus like that.

02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:37.360
What was it was Mary J.

02:02:37.560 --> 02:02:42.240
Blige, All of Me and Queen's Radio Gaga is still like just like just like a song

02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:45.640
that I love, like that mashup is so stinking good in that game.

02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:48.720
There's a lot of like great mashups in that game.

02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:51.240
But obviously that took some big record

02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:55.400
label maneuvering from a huge ass company like Activision to make happen.

02:02:55.600 --> 02:03:00.080
So, again, I'm not I'm all about indie artists too and up and comers and so forth.

02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:03.800
So I'd be just curious to hear how the songs are.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:09.200
OK, so like some of the like artists I recognize on this list, which probably is

02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:11.440
not going to be very many, Tokyo Machine.

02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:14.400
So they did a lot of stuff and they have Beat Saber.

02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:17.040
And, of course, in

02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:18.840
Oh, God.

02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:23.480
How's that really popular game?

02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:25.560
I can't remember.

02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:28.800
Anyways, yeah, Beat Saber, I know they have some songs in there.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:30.200
Rocket League, that's what I'm saying.

02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:32.720
Sorry. And

02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:35.360
what else? So the other artists that they

02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:40.240
mentioned on here, Rogue, Nitro Fun, Hyper Potions, Tut Tut Child, Panda Eyes,

02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:44.440
Terminite, Pegboard Nerds, Tristem, Bracken.

02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:45.880
I haven't heard of a lot of these.

02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:48.640
A Tokyo Machine is the only one I know and their songs are awesome.

02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:51.080
So, OK, but it's like it's like other it's

02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:54.200
folks that have either they're indie completely and this is their first

02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:57.120
experience or like they were artists for other games.

02:03:57.120 --> 02:03:58.840
That's pretty cool, though.

02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:02.520
Yeah, Rocket League has a sweet soundtrack, so that's cool.

02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:03.920
Some comments from chat.

02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:07.800
Tiger Claw says, I have a real live version of DJ Hero and I mean, I have an actual

02:04:07.800 --> 02:04:10.320
DJ controller. I play with it from time to time when I

02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:12.360
want to play around with my music to see how they mix.

02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:16.440
Well, speaking of music, mixing that harmonics game is on the horizon, too.

02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:18.000
I mean, that's not really a DJ Hero game.

02:04:18.200 --> 02:04:20.680
It's their card game adapted for consoles.

02:04:20.680 --> 02:04:23.720
But I think people are going to have fun doing mashups with that.

02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:27.280
Anything with Carly Rae Jepsen songs is going to be a blast.

02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:29.000
Can you name anybody more perfect?

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.080
I'll wait. OK, I'm done waiting.

02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:32.120
Moving on.

02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:34.720
We also have Dark Tetsuya says, I've heard of it.

02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:35.720
It seems cool.

02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:39.000
I just need to get a hold of my turntable controller.

02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:40.880
And let's see.

02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:45.080
I thought there was another comment on that, but that's all I see in the moment.

02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:47.640
So, yeah, it sounds like a neat game to me.

02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:50.000
I'm probably going to check it out based on your email recommendations.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:51.280
So thank you for the email, AJ Twist.

02:04:51.480 --> 02:04:54.680
Appreciate that. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:04:54.880 --> 02:04:57.600
if you want to send us an email for a future week.

02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:01.880
In the meantime, let's move on to some other stories.

02:05:02.080 --> 02:05:03.160
Loki.

02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:07.440
Yes, so one of the other kind of digital

02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:12.040
things that they did this week was with Google Stadium making more announcements

02:05:12.080 --> 02:05:14.720
about their console.

02:05:14.920 --> 02:05:17.400
So the Stadia Connect event,

02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:21.600
they did talk about some more games coming to the platform.

02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:28.560
So Forks Must Die 3, which was supposed to be free with Stadia Pro.

02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:34.640
They did announce that Super Bomberman R Online is coming.

02:05:34.840 --> 02:05:39.520
So it's like a Bomberman battle royale game with 64 players.

02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:41.280
And then

02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:46.040
I want to say that they also had announced that there's a new harmonics game coming

02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:48.320
to the platform, which is kind of interesting.

02:05:48.520 --> 02:05:53.520
And then also Uppercut Games, which did City of Brass.

02:05:53.720 --> 02:05:58.080
And then Supermassive Games, who are behind Until Dawn.

02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:03.320
I'm curious to see how the harmonics stuff works out, considering that it's going to

02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:06.480
really have to be low latency to do a music game.

02:06:06.920 --> 02:06:11.280
Yeah, that's a pretty gutsy thing to put on a system like Stadia.

02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:14.720
But having played a little bit of Stadia in those first couple of months,

02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:16.640
thanks to the buddy pass that Mr.

02:06:16.840 --> 02:06:21.520
Blackwolf gave me, I was playing things like Destiny and Thumper.

02:06:21.520 --> 02:06:23.600
I remember playing, which is kind of a music game.

02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:25.000
It's not quite as intense.

02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:28.240
I want to say it's not quite as intense,

02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:32.280
but actually it's probably more intense because it's like a music horror game.

02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:35.880
But you know what I mean? Like the accuracy isn't quite, it's a little different.

02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:37.360
You have a little room for error in that game.

02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:42.400
But my point is, both of those games played pretty darn well, all things considered.

02:06:42.600 --> 02:06:48.200
So it's almost like, and has Harmonix developed a non-music game?

02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:50.680
And I think they did an itoy game.

02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:53.240
I think they did the itoy skater game.

02:06:53.440 --> 02:06:57.920
But that was like 20 years ago, 15 years ago, a long time ago.

02:06:58.120 --> 02:07:00.200
Yeah, I can't think of any.

02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:00.800
Yeah.

02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:02.600
So

02:07:02.800 --> 02:07:07.040
now they could be doing something a little more like the drop mix

02:07:07.240 --> 02:07:09.320
fuser or whatever they're calling it on console.

02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:12.640
They could be doing something more like that that maybe doesn't have the strict timing.

02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:18.120
But it could be a very interesting flex for Stadia to have something that requires

02:07:18.320 --> 02:07:22.480
precise timing and it works well. And honestly,

02:07:22.680 --> 02:07:28.600
any comments I've had about Stadia really aren't about the technology.

02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:30.840
The technology is good.

02:07:31.040 --> 02:07:34.400
It's a good technology.

02:07:34.600 --> 02:07:37.840
It's just going to be like, all I'm saying is like come Thursday,

02:07:38.040 --> 02:07:44.840
if even if they weren't like Microsoft wasn't announcing free online or whatever,

02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:51.280
it's still a hard sell already when you've got their library,

02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:54.440
hundreds of games that are part of Games Pass.

02:07:54.480 --> 02:08:00.000
It's almost the same price as the Stadia cost.

02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:05.040
Plus, I would trust Microsoft more with purchases than I would Google,

02:08:05.240 --> 02:08:08.400
just because this platform is relatively new.

02:08:08.600 --> 02:08:16.000
Google has the tradition of shuttering a lot of these platforms early on if they

02:08:16.200 --> 02:08:19.360
feel that they're not being popular.

02:08:19.560 --> 02:08:20.960
I just

02:08:21.680 --> 02:08:23.520
am having a hard time.

02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:27.440
I know these announcements, they want to make me believe that Google

02:08:27.640 --> 02:08:30.600
is going to invest in this for the long haul and so forth.

02:08:30.800 --> 02:08:32.920
And again, we still haven't even had

02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:36.960
the rollout of Stadia in the browser boom for everyone.

02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:39.800
I think many of us suspected we would have that by now.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:44.400
I don't know if Covid is to blame or some type of underestimation of the project is

02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:46.240
to blame or a combination of those things.

02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:48.720
Whatever point is, we don't have it yet.

02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:50.360
And I think many of us thought we would.

02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:52.920
This announcement about Harmonix and

02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:58.160
the folks behind Until Dawn making games for Stadia, that is very exciting news.

02:08:58.360 --> 02:09:02.720
This is news we should have had a year ago when they first unveiled things,

02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:06.280
whether they've been sitting on it or whether these deals were recently inked.

02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:08.200
I suppose we'll never know.

02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:12.600
But I feel like this news is going to get lost.

02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:14.400
This news is going to get really lost.

02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:16.640
Like you said, Microsoft's got a big event this week.

02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:18.520
Sony's got PlayStation five.

02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:20.680
I feel like this news without any type of

02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:24.640
footage or anything or something to really get us pumped up is going to get lost.

02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:26.520
And people are going to forget.

02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:29.440
Some of the other games that they're talking about coming to the platform are

02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:31.960
obviously games that have been out for a little bit already.

02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:34.680
So we have PGA Tour 2K21.

02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:38.840
OK, I'm going to stop you right there, because let's be let's be real.

02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:41.040
Let's be completely real.

02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:42.200
This doesn't matter.

02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:47.880
Like old games and we're releasing shit that already came out a year or two ago.

02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:49.240
It's not going to matter.

02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:51.280
Like, is anybody is anybody going to be

02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:54.760
buying stuff on Stadia that they've already bought two years ago?

02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:58.640
No, no. And so sorry, I don't mean to disrespect you,

02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:01.840
Loki, or the news you're trying to read, but I think the reality is that this news

02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:07.000
doesn't matter and this is this is the problem that we you had right out the gate.

02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:08.560
What are our launch titles?

02:10:08.760 --> 02:10:11.200
A bunch of shit from two years ago.

02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:15.600
So right, and I just don't know how they make themselves relevant.

02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:18.440
I thought that with, you know,

02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:22.960
having it's really like I said, back when I was talking about choosing consoles,

02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:26.480
you know, it's really the exclusives that are going to bring it to the platform.

02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:30.000
And then having the vast library will kind of keep you there as well.

02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:33.960
I just don't see the exclusives for Stadia.

02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:35.640
It just seems like a fad.

02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:40.480
And honestly, by the time they get it right, it's going to be too late, I think.

02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:44.240
Yeah, I'm I'm really worried about Stadia from that perspective, too.

02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:48.520
Like we we should already have the Stadia for everybody.

02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:53.320
I don't I mean, I don't understand why we're still waiting on that

02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:57.920
because technically they're kind of giving out pro for free because like you can get

02:10:57.920 --> 02:11:00.000
that trial or whatever and you can play it in your browser.

02:11:00.200 --> 02:11:03.640
Like they need to stop making it like, oh, you're signing up for a pro.

02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:05.200
They need to make it like you just you're

02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:07.760
logging into your Google account and it has Stadia on it.

02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:12.160
Like it's like it's drive like Google Drive or Google Docs or whatever.

02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:16.720
Like it's just Stadia is one of those things you can just go like they need to,

02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:18.760
you know, and I realize, oh, it could be a bandwidth thing.

02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:22.960
It could be like we're past the time where it should have already been something

02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:27.000
that everybody can just easily access every day that we don't have.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.400
That Stadia is going to fall further and further behind.

02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:30.560
That's the reality.

02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:32.480
And these game announcements,

02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:36.560
especially the stuff that's years old that people have already bought or got for free.

02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:37.880
How many of the games that they've

02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:42.160
announced on Stadia has Epic Games Store already given away for free?

02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:43.520
Quite a few.

02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:47.000
Like the two of the games that they had on there were hit me at one at two.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:48.400
I guarantee I have those.

02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:51.800
I'm pretty sure I've got those on multiple platforms already.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:57.400
Yeah. And the Tomb Raider series, I'm almost positive, was free on Square.

02:11:57.600 --> 02:11:59.880
Square Enix gave it away, I think, at the beginning of the covid stuff.

02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:03.280
So my point is, yeah, and that's that's why I cut off you

02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:05.920
reading the list is because these announcements don't matter.

02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:07.280
They don't mean anything.

02:12:07.480 --> 02:12:11.120
Most people already have played these games or they're already in their library.

02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:12.400
And this is scraps.

02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:15.640
And Stadia is not going to survive off scraps.

02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:17.840
And it's a bummer because, again,

02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:21.280
any complaint I've ever had about Stadia isn't the technology.

02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:25.680
If you actually go through the hoops to check it out and play Destiny 2,

02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:29.400
it kind of works and it's pretty cool.

02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:36.440
But how long is that going to sustain the idea of give Stadia money?

02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:38.720
I don't know. Not at all for me.

02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:40.040
Yeah, same here.

02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:42.160
Running out of time. All right.

02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:45.960
Well, one game that's managed to keep going for years and years and years is

02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:48.880
Minecraft, right, Loki? Minecraft had the right idea, right?

02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:52.240
So now I get Loki.

02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:54.760
You might have to give me some background on this because I'm not totally

02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:58.720
understanding like why this is like huge news, but it is circulating around game

02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:04.000
blogs and stuff, and that is that the Minecraft title screen

02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:06.400
apparently shows a world in the background.

02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:07.120
We all knew that.

02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:10.640
I always thought it was just a random fucking world each and every time.

02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:11.320
But apparently not.

02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:13.640
It's the same world every time.

02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:15.960
And they have just discovered this week.

02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:21.720
If you want to play in the title screen world, here is the seed.

02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:23.160
And there's actually two seeds.

02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:24.440
So spoiler alert.

02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:27.720
See, I would have thought the seed would have been something like

02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:33.160
Microsoft rules or something like somebody's cat name or something like that.

02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:38.800
No, no, the seed is two one five one nine zero one five five three nine six eight

02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:41.720
three five two seven four all of the seeds are converted to numeric.

02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:45.600
So whether you type in Microsoft rules or whatever like that, you know,

02:13:45.800 --> 02:13:48.640
it would still be it converts it down to that.

02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:50.240
OK, that I would have known.

02:13:50.240 --> 02:13:51.160
So thank you.

02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:53.600
What they were doing is like

02:13:53.800 --> 02:13:58.080
once again, it's a lot of time being wasted on this stuff there.

02:13:58.080 --> 02:14:01.680
They had algorithms and stuff that they were trying to figure out what the seed

02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:07.760
was to find the world and based on the generation that was there,

02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:13.040
chunk generation and where the different objects were in there.

02:14:13.240 --> 02:14:16.320
And so they were basing that trying to figure out, you know,

02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:20.240
how to find the actual seed that is shown in those screenshots.

02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:25.000
They did something similar not too long ago with PewDiePie with his seed

02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:28.840
that he was playing in his world because they wanted to play the same one.

02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:30.280
I don't know. It's time.

02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:32.000
People got a lot of time nowadays.

02:14:32.200 --> 02:14:34.520
And so just now you can check it out.

02:14:34.720 --> 02:14:37.320
Just think you could have found a cure for covid.

02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:41.000
But no, you found the Minecraft title screen seed.

02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:42.280
No, I should look.

02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:45.160
I've spent 18 years of my life doing a podcast.

02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:46.120
I have no room to judge.

02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:48.040
Yeah, it is the blurry image.

02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:53.240
And then they found the exact spot in the exact world to actually check it out.

02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:54.640
I mean, it's kind of cool that they are

02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:59.200
able to find that amongst the billions of levels or worlds that could be generated.

02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:01.520
Yeah. And, you know, the versions

02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:06.120
now have to change the screenshot and then figure it out all over again.

02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:11.000
All jokes aside, like the science behind it and how they discovered it is pretty

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:14.680
cool, you know, we have to rip it a little bit because it's like all that time you

02:15:14.680 --> 02:15:16.560
spent doing X, you could have been doing Y.

02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:19.360
But the fact that they did use these kind

02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:23.200
of unconventional techniques to figure it out and it's like this is this is this is

02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:27.320
what we want and we're going to find it, they found it good for them.

02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:29.680
Now, go cure Covid.

02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:32.960
All right.

02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:36.680
Anyhow, moving on, Loki, what do you have for us?

02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:38.040
So this is kind of fun.

02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:43.200
So there is a a little indie game that someone made

02:15:43.400 --> 02:15:48.040
that's kind of like WarioWare, but with like a horror trope twist to it.

02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:54.200
So this game Spookware by Adam Pipe is a it's 10 micro games.

02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:56.120
They're all themed around horror stuff.

02:15:56.120 --> 02:16:00.400
So it's different things like, you know, moving

02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:05.760
with the reader across the Ouija board, you know, sawing a leg in half,

02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:10.280
finding the missing letters and like a Slenderman type of thing.

02:16:10.480 --> 02:16:15.240
And you use the arrow keys on your keyboard to play the game.

02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:18.520
And it's very authentic to WarioWare.

02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:19.320
It's pretty awesome.

02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:21.480
So what's great, though, is you can check it out.

02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:23.880
It is free.

02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:30.040
It's taken him 24 months or I'm sorry, it's game a month.

02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:31.040
So he created in a month.

02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:33.000
He's done this for 24 months straight, though.

02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:35.440
So it's his 24th one they put together.

02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:39.440
If you want to check it out, it's papercookies.itch.io

02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:43.160
slash Spookware and it looks pretty cool.

02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:44.040
You got to play it.

02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:45.120
Yeah, I want to check that out.

02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:46.480
That was really cool.

02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:52.280
I love WarioWare, which is why I enjoy super multitasking by YYR.

02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:53.560
But no, seriously, I do.

02:16:53.760 --> 02:16:55.360
I love the WarioWare games.

02:16:55.560 --> 02:16:59.720
And so and that's always also one of those franchises where I'm like, God,

02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:02.320
I wish Nintendo would bring this back because it's been a while since I've had

02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:03.800
one of those games, been a long while.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:08.080
And I feel like the last game we got was just a rehash of one of the old games.

02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:09.720
Yeah, it's cool.

02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:14.800
It's funny, though, is they've got like it's there's some cheesy stuff in there.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:19.480
It's very much got the same like feeling of WarioWare game.

02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:21.360
Like, for example, the one where it's

02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:25.600
kind of gross, where you're like sawing a leg in half that's on a chopping board

02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:28.240
with a chainsaw, though, but you're sawing it like a knife.

02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:29.800
It's all what's for dinner.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.560
And it's like dinner is served.

02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:36.000
Or like they have what they have another one where it's like a dark room.

02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:37.960
It's like, where's Nosferatu?

02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:41.400
You find his face and there he is.

02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:42.840
It's still like stuff like that.

02:17:42.840 --> 02:17:46.200
It's kind of funny, as long as it's like silly and comical and like, you know,

02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:49.400
and I've talked about this with horror a lot.

02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:53.760
I don't I'm not into the very realistic looking horror stuff.

02:17:53.960 --> 02:17:57.520
But when it's like Disney's Haunted Mansion or like Elvira,

02:17:57.520 --> 02:18:00.720
like Darsaka went over earlier, like that macabre type of stuff,

02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:03.280
that stuff I think is great and I eat it up.

02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:06.800
I think that stuff is the Addams Family, like one of the all times greatest.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:08.120
I think that shit is great.

02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:09.760
Like that. That's awesome.

02:18:09.760 --> 02:18:11.640
It's the stuff that's like too realistic.

02:18:11.760 --> 02:18:13.320
So it's like, where's Nosferatu?

02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:15.000
And it's cartoony and stuff.

02:18:15.200 --> 02:18:16.520
I think that would be funny.

02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:20.280
Yeah, it's it's very much looks like a Warrior War game.

02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:21.800
OK, that's that's cool.

02:18:21.800 --> 02:18:22.960
I want to check it out. I will.

02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:24.520
That's that's cool. All right.

02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:26.400
Did you say it was free or is it a small?

02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:28.120
It's free. Yeah. Oh, that's awesome.

02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:29.720
That's even better.

02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:30.680
All right.

02:18:30.880 --> 02:18:34.680
One more free upgrade for owners of this game.

02:18:34.680 --> 02:18:37.240
And I feel like this is a game Loki probably owns.

02:18:37.440 --> 02:18:38.840
I did it one time.

02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:40.760
I don't know if I still do.

02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:42.600
Let me check my Steam library.

02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:46.960
Worms Armageddon came out over 20 years ago.

02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:50.920
And of course, the Worms franchise kind of came from those old tank war games

02:18:50.920 --> 02:18:54.760
from the 60s, from the 60s, from the 90s,

02:18:55.680 --> 02:18:58.200
those early TV titles

02:18:58.200 --> 02:19:02.520
when there was just zeros and ones and blips played on my telescope.

02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:06.280
So from the 90s, things like what was it?

02:19:06.280 --> 02:19:07.920
Tank Wars and Scorched Earth.

02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:10.040
Those are the games. Can you play?

02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:12.480
We played it with real worms and real grenades.

02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:13.480
We need to do.

02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:17.640
Loki, you and I need to play Scorched Earth on a live stream someday.

02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:20.800
We do. That would be fun.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.560
Do they can you even run it at normal speed anymore?

02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:27.440
Would it go like I'm sure they've got like there's also Tank Wars and stuff.

02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:30.000
I'm sure there's an online version of that.

02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:31.320
Oh, God, I've got to find that.

02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:33.120
We've got to make that happen some night anyway.

02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:35.800
But Worms was kind of like an evolution of that stuff.

02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:38.280
Right. Where instead of tanks, it became worms.

02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:43.640
And in celebration of twenty five years of the entire franchise,

02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:48.880
developer Team 17 put out an update for Worms Armageddon on the PC.

02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:52.960
Seven years worth of fixes, changes and improvements.

02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:55.240
The announcement was made on Twitter and Steam.

02:19:55.240 --> 02:20:00.800
There's a new three point eight update for the 1999 release Worms Armageddon.

02:20:01.520 --> 02:20:05.760
And there's some of the fan improvements and fixes, some mod features

02:20:05.920 --> 02:20:07.800
and are now integrated into the game.

02:20:07.840 --> 02:20:11.680
For example, somebody named Rubber Worm in the I'm sorry,

02:20:11.680 --> 02:20:13.600
that's one of the mods or the actual mod names.

02:20:13.800 --> 02:20:16.720
It was a popular Armageddon mod that lets you manipulate the physics

02:20:16.720 --> 02:20:18.760
and fire multiple weapons in a single turn.

02:20:18.880 --> 02:20:20.480
And so now that's in the official game.

02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:21.840
So that's pretty cool.

02:20:21.840 --> 02:20:25.080
That's a real neat fan love letter is that you know what?

02:20:25.080 --> 02:20:28.440
We are going to embrace these fan mods now as official canon.

02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:29.880
That's pretty cool.

02:20:29.880 --> 02:20:32.560
And we're seeing developers do that more and more like we kind of saw that

02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:37.120
with the recent Doom rerelease on like PlayStation four and stuff

02:20:37.120 --> 02:20:41.960
where like the big user community wads are like right there in the game

02:20:41.960 --> 02:20:43.920
and you can just install them for free and play them.

02:20:44.080 --> 02:20:45.040
I think that's really rad.

02:20:45.200 --> 02:20:48.560
So, yeah, that I love this like community,

02:20:48.760 --> 02:20:52.000
the developers embracing the modding community like this is really cool.

02:20:53.400 --> 02:20:55.600
Can't wait for the rerelease of Mass Effect.

02:20:55.600 --> 02:20:59.200
That's just going to embrace the H the high res texture mods

02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:01.640
that are already out there.

02:21:01.640 --> 02:21:03.840
We'll see. All right.

02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:06.640
Anyhow, pretty cool. I like that.

02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:09.640
All right. This is the part of the show where we're going to open up

02:21:09.640 --> 02:21:12.520
our chat room for any questions or any topics we didn't get to tonight.

02:21:12.720 --> 02:21:14.680
So if you have anything you want to bring to the listener roundtable,

02:21:14.680 --> 02:21:20.200
twitch.tv slash vog network and Hype Mayhem is always like on it, ready to go.

02:21:20.200 --> 02:21:22.240
I love it. Hype Mayhem says questions.

02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:25.480
Seeing that digital games are prevalent nowadays, especially on PC,

02:21:25.720 --> 02:21:29.160
our physical games, their cases, boxes and any extras included.

02:21:29.160 --> 02:21:32.320
See, special editions have any place or relevancy nowadays.

02:21:32.560 --> 02:21:35.400
People used to love displaying their games and stuff on shelves

02:21:35.400 --> 02:21:36.520
for the longest time.

02:21:36.520 --> 02:21:40.680
But nowadays, people love the freebies on Epic or the seasonal Steam GOG sales.

02:21:40.960 --> 02:21:43.200
Plus, there's a subscription stuff, too.

02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:45.880
Has displaying your collection gone the way of the dodo?

02:21:46.640 --> 02:21:48.200
Excellent question.

02:21:48.200 --> 02:21:53.720
And one that comes up often on gaming shows and the community

02:21:53.720 --> 02:21:56.920
these days is like, are we really ready to go all digital?

02:21:56.920 --> 02:22:00.160
And the simplest answer to this question is that there's always

02:22:00.160 --> 02:22:02.880
there's just there's just always going to be both.

02:22:02.880 --> 02:22:05.680
And you see a company like Limited Run Games.

02:22:05.880 --> 02:22:07.800
And we talked about them on the show a couple of weeks ago.

02:22:07.920 --> 02:22:11.240
They're doing all these limited runs like that

02:22:11.240 --> 02:22:15.600
Shante game on the Game Boy Color that group is rereleasing, for God's sake.

02:22:15.600 --> 02:22:18.400
Like they're doing a lot of physical releases.

02:22:18.400 --> 02:22:21.720
So there is always going to be a call for collectibles.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:25.200
And I've brought up this analogy on OLR before.

02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:27.200
It's been a bit, so I'll bring it up again.

02:22:27.200 --> 02:22:29.760
We're not really like an analogy, but but the fact that

02:22:30.320 --> 02:22:34.720
the physical games that you own end up having equity. Right.

02:22:35.640 --> 02:22:38.480
And I don't like to go and buy games digitally

02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:42.480
unless there's some type of trade off, because essentially, if I buy digitally,

02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:45.960
I'm giving up that equity because you can't trade your digital games.

02:22:46.280 --> 02:22:49.880
So if Epic is going to give me a free game, well, shit,

02:22:49.880 --> 02:22:52.000
that's a good way to make me let go of equity.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.160
Give it to me for free. Right.

02:22:54.160 --> 02:22:56.520
And so that's what a lot of people have done with their digital collections.

02:22:57.560 --> 02:22:59.520
And now things are getting to a point.

02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:01.760
I think there's a lot of people who are finding themselves

02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:04.320
more and more inconvenienced with physical media.

02:23:04.680 --> 02:23:08.040
For example, I think about Bobby Blackwolf and the setup in his house.

02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:13.000
And sorry, Bobby, I don't mean to speak for you, but if I lived in your house,

02:23:13.280 --> 02:23:16.320
I would imagine when I want to play games down there in that basement,

02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:19.760
it would actually be kind of a pain in the ass to have physical media.

02:23:19.760 --> 02:23:22.960
Sometimes it would be much easier to just have games digital

02:23:23.120 --> 02:23:25.960
so I could kind of like flip between them there, because like getting up

02:23:25.960 --> 02:23:28.880
to open the door that has the consoles in it and all that stuff

02:23:29.120 --> 02:23:31.880
might end up being a little bit of a pain.

02:23:31.880 --> 02:23:35.120
So you might give up your equity because you kind of know

02:23:35.120 --> 02:23:38.160
I'm never going to sell these games back, whatever, and that whole thing.

02:23:40.480 --> 02:23:43.800
But also something that's kind of driven me back to physical,

02:23:43.800 --> 02:23:45.600
like I was kind of at this point where I was like,

02:23:45.600 --> 02:23:48.920
I'm buying more and more digital, like I just bought Animal Crossing digital.

02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:52.280
I pop Pokemon digital because I'm like, these are types of games

02:23:52.280 --> 02:23:54.080
that you just want to kind of always have available

02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:56.760
and you don't want to have to switch a cartridge in and out or anything like that.

02:23:56.760 --> 02:24:00.560
So, you know, like there's there's that.

02:24:02.200 --> 02:24:04.280
But then Alan got a switch, too.

02:24:05.280 --> 02:24:07.480
And now it's like, well, wait a minute,

02:24:07.480 --> 02:24:10.120
I don't really want to buy digital games because Alan can't play them

02:24:10.120 --> 02:24:11.920
if I buy them digitally.

02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:15.040
So now I'm back to I want to get physical releases

02:24:15.320 --> 02:24:18.400
so that he can play them, too, if he if he would play anything else

02:24:18.400 --> 02:24:20.400
besides Dark Souls and Animal Crossing.

02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:22.720
But that's what makes him happy. So whatever.

02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:25.520
But it does make me think, well, maybe he'll want to play Zelda someday

02:24:25.520 --> 02:24:27.080
or maybe he'll want to play his other game someday.

02:24:27.080 --> 02:24:29.360
So I should probably get it on physical media.

02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:31.720
So there's that, too.

02:24:31.720 --> 02:24:33.920
And Bobby does clarify.

02:24:34.080 --> 02:24:37.600
Yes, I still like my physical media because of my data cap.

02:24:37.600 --> 02:24:39.320
That's a very good point, too.

02:24:39.320 --> 02:24:40.480
Marissa Mizell in chat.

02:24:40.480 --> 02:24:44.440
Hi, Marissa says my Internet connection is awful, so I still like physical,

02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:47.560
but I also like owning the product and not licensing it.

02:24:48.240 --> 02:24:50.200
Tiger Claw talks about shelf space.

02:24:50.200 --> 02:24:52.720
You might not have enough space to store all your physical media.

02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:54.320
That's why we joke about.

02:24:54.320 --> 02:24:57.240
I don't have any room for a shelf to have shelf space.

02:24:57.280 --> 02:25:00.440
Well, and that's why we joke about Dark Sakura's vault. Right.

02:25:00.480 --> 02:25:03.680
She has a lot of physical stuff from especially from back in the day

02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:04.720
in the older systems.

02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:08.880
But at one point, there was literally an entire room in her house dedicated to it.

02:25:08.920 --> 02:25:10.720
That's how much space it took up.

02:25:10.720 --> 02:25:13.800
There's a very old YouTube, very, very old YouTube video out there

02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:15.560
on the channel Orange Lounge Radio.

02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:17.720
If you didn't know, it's like very old.

02:25:17.720 --> 02:25:20.400
But we actually show Dark Sakura's old vault in one of the videos.

02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:22.440
So that's out there.

02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:25.640
DJ Rama S says, I'm OK with buying digital,

02:25:25.640 --> 02:25:27.880
but not when it's the same price as the physical release.

02:25:27.880 --> 02:25:28.800
Yeah, there's that.

02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:31.200
And that's that's the equity, right?

02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:34.960
Like, what am I what am I getting digital but physical?

02:25:34.960 --> 02:25:38.040
I'll have something that I could technically give, sell back or give out

02:25:38.040 --> 02:25:40.240
or, you know, trade or what have you.

02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:44.800
So I think the answer to that is really going to be different for everybody.

02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:47.280
And for me, it is.

02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:50.360
I'll go digital if there's a good reason for me to go digital.

02:25:50.840 --> 02:25:53.800
Otherwise, excuse me, otherwise I still tend to go physical,

02:25:54.120 --> 02:25:57.360
especially with Nintendo Switch, those cartridges are like itty bitty.

02:25:57.360 --> 02:25:58.920
They don't take up shelf space.

02:25:58.920 --> 02:26:01.880
I do. I keep all the boxes somewhere, but then I have my little purse,

02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:04.320
my switch purse that has all my games in it.

02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:07.280
And it's not going to fill up anytime soon because those cartridges are itty bitty.

02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:12.480
So anything you want to add to that, Loki, about the whole digital versus physical?

02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:17.000
Oh, I just I always thought I wasn't going to do mostly digital as well.

02:26:17.600 --> 02:26:21.360
But then, you know, that ended up being the complete opposite.

02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:25.040
So, yeah, really, for me, a lot of times

02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:29.080
the sales seem to be more frequent on the digital stuff.

02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:31.760
And a lot of the stuff I get is also only digital,

02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:34.280
but it's also more convenient to like,

02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:37.200
you know, the local game style closed down over here.

02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:41.440
So, I mean, I could order from Amazon or something like that,

02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:44.600
but it's just it's easier to know.

02:26:44.600 --> 02:26:47.120
I don't have to worry about it coming in the mail.

02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:49.720
It's usually available 9 p.m.

02:26:49.720 --> 02:26:51.760
the night before it's supposed to release.

02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:58.280
So I just I don't see myself going out and trading in stuff as much as I used to.

02:26:58.280 --> 02:27:02.880
And even when I was it, you don't get anything for it.

02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:06.080
And yeah, I know you could go sell stuff on eBay, but that's a hassle.

02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:10.560
So for me, it's just the time saved is more valuable than the

02:27:11.720 --> 02:27:14.280
money I might make back from selling something.

02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:18.360
All right. I'll open it up to chat to see if there's any other questions.

02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:21.160
In the meantime, while we see if there's any other discussion topics,

02:27:21.720 --> 02:27:24.200
Loki, I usually open it up for any last minute stories you might have.

02:27:24.840 --> 02:27:28.120
Yeah. So there's going to be a Dragon's Dogma anime series.

02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:31.320
It's going to be coming to Netflix September 17th.

02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:34.600
That's interesting, you know, considering that Castlevania has done well.

02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:39.960
I'd be interested to see how this one fares as well, but be pretty cool.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:41.840
I'm not very familiar with the series.

02:27:41.840 --> 02:27:47.200
I know it's kind of similar to, I think, Skyrim or an Elder Scrolls type of game.

02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:51.520
But I think the other side from just the adventuring and the fantasy stuff like that,

02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:53.120
it's probably pretty different.

02:27:53.120 --> 02:27:57.440
But as that is that is excited in chat saying, ah, best game.

02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:00.800
So, yeah, be cool. I can't wait to see it.

02:28:01.680 --> 02:28:05.320
Yeah, the success of things like The Witcher and Castlevania, man, it's just

02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:10.760
it's going to make this video game stuff on on demand services really explode.

02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:14.360
I'm so hyped for Final Fantasy 14 whenever they get that going.

02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:16.120
Like, obviously, Covid has that stock right now.

02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:20.120
But, you know, back in the day, you know, when it's like, oh, the video game adaptation.

02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:25.560
Oh, you know, now it's like, oh, hey, people, they finally get it now.

02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:27.800
They they they know how to do it right.

02:28:29.960 --> 02:28:33.720
All right. I have to read this comment from She-Hulk in chat because it's the best reason

02:28:33.720 --> 02:28:35.400
against physical media.

02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:39.080
When I have a cat in my lap, I cannot get up to change the disk.

02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:41.000
Good thinking, She-Hulk.

02:28:44.200 --> 02:28:49.400
Marissa is telling a story about how iTunes removed some TVs and movies because the publisher,

02:28:49.400 --> 02:28:51.880
I guess, had pulled the material off iTunes.

02:28:51.880 --> 02:28:55.560
So that is kind of scary, too, when the digital license gets revoked to physical media.

02:28:55.560 --> 02:28:57.800
Sometimes the only way you can kind of keep things.

02:28:57.800 --> 02:29:00.680
That's it's rare, but it does happen.

02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:02.280
I've heard of that with video games, too.

02:29:03.400 --> 02:29:07.640
It's typically, you know, well, that was all different.

02:29:07.800 --> 02:29:09.320
I know a little bit of it.

02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:14.840
Typically, though, when they're removing stuff off of a service like not they're just not

02:29:14.840 --> 02:29:18.040
selling it anymore, but you'd still have access to your digital copies.

02:29:18.040 --> 02:29:24.120
It's very rare that they ever remove it completely from your library.

02:29:24.120 --> 02:29:26.120
Yeah, but I can understand not wanting to take a chance.

02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:26.920
I get that.

02:29:27.480 --> 02:29:27.980
Yeah.

02:29:28.600 --> 02:29:33.480
It's happened a lot with different like Ninja Turtles, for example, has had it where the

02:29:33.480 --> 02:29:35.320
rights have gone away.

02:29:35.320 --> 02:29:38.840
And they've also done it with other things where they'll even mark down the game to,

02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:43.480
like, a ridiculously low price because they know that they're pulling the rights to it

02:29:43.480 --> 02:29:44.120
pretty soon.

02:29:44.120 --> 02:29:44.620
So.

02:29:46.200 --> 02:29:49.720
Oh, this is a dark to see you found a free version of scorched earth online.

02:29:49.720 --> 02:29:52.440
Can you tweet me that link dark to see because I'll lose it in the chat.

02:29:52.440 --> 02:29:53.160
So thank you.

02:29:53.160 --> 02:29:53.960
I want to check that out.

02:29:54.520 --> 02:29:55.320
OK, sorry, lucky.

02:29:55.960 --> 02:29:59.560
I was going to say some other things, though, that we've seen is not necessarily and that

02:29:59.560 --> 02:30:00.200
link doesn't work.

02:30:01.160 --> 02:30:11.480
Is that not only does we have games removed from your library, but also like games alter,

02:30:11.480 --> 02:30:16.280
like, for example, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and even Grand Theft Auto four have had like

02:30:16.280 --> 02:30:17.800
music taken out of the game.

02:30:17.800 --> 02:30:18.520
Good call.

02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:19.640
The music change.

02:30:19.640 --> 02:30:20.840
Yeah, the license.

02:30:20.840 --> 02:30:24.440
Yeah, there's not much you can do that with the games constantly updating.

02:30:24.440 --> 02:30:29.000
So, yeah, you know, and that discussion is coming up again when we're talking about Xbox

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:34.600
backwards compatibility is that Microsoft will not commit to the full library being

02:30:34.600 --> 02:30:37.880
backwards backwards compatible from Xbox one on Series X.

02:30:38.440 --> 02:30:42.040
It sounds like there will be some rare games that will not be backwards compatible.

02:30:42.040 --> 02:30:43.800
And it doesn't sound like it's a technology thing.

02:30:43.800 --> 02:30:47.000
It sounds like it's a licensing thing, like something in that realm.

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:51.160
Like and I don't know this for sure, but it is an example.

02:30:51.800 --> 02:30:53.480
Something like Rock Band 4.

02:30:54.280 --> 02:30:58.040
I could see where maybe they're not going to let that play on the new one because of

02:30:58.040 --> 02:31:00.040
like music and licensing and those types of things.

02:31:00.040 --> 02:31:05.800
Again, not that I've heard that game specifically, but I could see where, oh, maybe that's going

02:31:05.800 --> 02:31:06.920
to complicate it.

02:31:06.920 --> 02:31:07.560
It's interesting.

02:31:09.080 --> 02:31:09.320
Yeah.

02:31:10.120 --> 02:31:10.440
All right.

02:31:11.080 --> 02:31:12.360
Any other last minute stories for us?

02:31:14.840 --> 02:31:16.360
No, that's pretty much it.

02:31:16.360 --> 02:31:16.840
All right.

02:31:16.840 --> 02:31:21.320
Then I think we are good to wrap up and get our final thoughts out.

02:31:21.320 --> 02:31:24.440
Hey, I want to thank you guys for listening and participating with Orange Launch Radio

02:31:24.440 --> 02:31:25.240
tonight.

02:31:25.240 --> 02:31:26.120
Thank you so much.

02:31:26.200 --> 02:31:29.400
If you liked what you heard here at the show, help us spread the message.

02:31:29.400 --> 02:31:32.920
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the gamers voices aren't here to put

02:31:32.920 --> 02:31:36.120
out on the air, then what can we do?

02:31:36.120 --> 02:31:37.480
Tell a friend or two about the show.

02:31:37.480 --> 02:31:40.760
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:31:41.400 --> 02:31:45.320
And again, I want to thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening, whether it was

02:31:45.320 --> 02:31:48.680
on the podcast feed or if it was on our Twitch feed.

02:31:48.680 --> 02:31:52.200
Either way, just thank you for being here and being a part of our Sunday nights.

02:31:52.200 --> 02:31:57.400
And I hope we, uh, made for some good entertainment on your Sunday night or Monday afternoon,

02:31:57.400 --> 02:31:59.880
whenever you're listening to this, um, super appreciate it.

02:32:00.440 --> 02:32:07.800
My final thought for tonight is, um, you guys didn't get to see it on the Twitch stream

02:32:07.800 --> 02:32:11.000
because the discord is in the way, but I'll switch the shot real quick.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:14.360
So there's this little basket here on the couch.

02:32:14.360 --> 02:32:18.520
And I was really hoping because earlier today, about two or three o'clock, Mr.

02:32:18.520 --> 02:32:23.800
Smoosh climbed up in this basket and I got from work and was sitting there and actually

02:32:23.800 --> 02:32:27.400
Smoosh was sitting there until like five 30.

02:32:27.400 --> 02:32:31.560
It was about halfway through Bobby show when he finally got up to leave.

02:32:31.560 --> 02:32:33.880
I guess, I guess he didn't care for the Bobby black Wolf show.

02:32:33.880 --> 02:32:34.360
I don't know.

02:32:34.360 --> 02:32:38.280
It wasn't that it was, he just, he'd been there for hours and I think he knew his food

02:32:38.280 --> 02:32:40.760
thing was going to go off soon because it goes off at six o'clock.

02:32:40.760 --> 02:32:44.440
So I knew he wouldn't make it to OLR, but I thought I might get him for the Bobby call,

02:32:44.440 --> 02:32:46.440
but apparently, uh, sadly I didn't.

02:32:46.440 --> 02:32:47.720
So I was hoping he'd come back.

02:32:48.280 --> 02:32:50.600
So I'm going to hope in a future week, I'm going to leave this.

02:32:50.600 --> 02:32:56.360
So you might all be wondering why is there a basket mixed in with all the video game

02:32:56.360 --> 02:32:57.960
crap that we have on the couch?

02:32:57.960 --> 02:32:59.560
Why is a basket suddenly mixed in?

02:32:59.560 --> 02:33:03.560
That is going to be the answer because I'm, this is Smoosh's throne and I'm waiting for

02:33:03.560 --> 02:33:05.960
him to come back and have a seat.

02:33:05.960 --> 02:33:09.400
And yes, I did tweet a picture earlier and Tiger Claw dug that up there.

02:33:09.400 --> 02:33:11.480
So you can check out that picture if you want.

02:33:11.480 --> 02:33:11.720
All right.

02:33:11.720 --> 02:33:12.920
That's my very long final thought.

02:33:12.920 --> 02:33:13.800
Loki, your final thought.

02:33:13.800 --> 02:33:19.720
Oh, um, I did remember there was one story that I didn't talk about, but, um, it's kind

02:33:19.720 --> 02:33:26.760
of a given since there's a lot of other retailers doing this, but mandating masks, um, the apparently

02:33:26.760 --> 02:33:32.040
GameStop is going to be, um, putting out notices on their doors saying that they're requiring

02:33:32.040 --> 02:33:35.800
masks in shop, but they're not allowing the employees to enforce that.

02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:41.720
So, you know, that's a thing, I guess it's a dangerous situation.

02:33:41.720 --> 02:33:45.240
Like, I can't believe I'm going to defend this because I fully believe people need to

02:33:45.240 --> 02:33:49.560
be wearing their fucking masks, but they're not paying those employees enough to deal

02:33:49.560 --> 02:33:50.360
with that bullshit.

02:33:50.360 --> 02:33:55.880
Well, I need, I need to watch my words because at the same time, those employees shouldn't

02:33:55.880 --> 02:33:57.800
be exposed to COVID in the first place.

02:33:57.800 --> 02:34:00.440
So I hope they have some type of glass thing set up.

02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:02.440
Like you might see the 7-Eleven or something like that.

02:34:02.440 --> 02:34:03.880
I really, really hope.

02:34:03.880 --> 02:34:08.120
But at the same time, like those guys just aren't paid enough to like fight with somebody

02:34:08.120 --> 02:34:09.960
and throw them out of the store and that whole thing.

02:34:09.960 --> 02:34:13.880
Like people should just be decent enough to wear their masks in the store in the first

02:34:13.880 --> 02:34:14.440
place, but.

02:34:16.040 --> 02:34:16.520
Right.

02:34:16.520 --> 02:34:18.760
And there's a whole, whole other situation.

02:34:18.760 --> 02:34:23.720
I mean, um, there was other stuff I saw this week too, about talking about pre-orders and

02:34:23.720 --> 02:34:24.040
everything.

02:34:24.040 --> 02:34:28.120
And if you have games pre-ordered as store and that store happens to close down, which

02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:33.000
a lot of them are because they're running, they're having financial problems right now.

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:36.200
Um, you're not getting your money back or at least you're not getting your money back

02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:37.240
without quite a fight.

02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:41.400
So just keep that in mind when you're pre-ordering stuff, especially with brand new consoles

02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:48.440
around the corner, that they're going to keep your money unless you drag it out and calling

02:34:48.440 --> 02:34:51.800
corporates like I do anything because you're just going to be on hold for hours without

02:34:51.800 --> 02:34:52.600
them picking up.

02:34:52.600 --> 02:34:58.440
They know fully well that they're doing this and they just don't care because what are

02:34:58.440 --> 02:34:59.160
you going to do about it?

02:34:59.160 --> 02:35:04.520
Yeah, that's, that's gonna, GameStop might want to clarify or clear up that policy before

02:35:04.520 --> 02:35:09.240
they do start because that word is going to spread around social media fast, uh, around

02:35:09.240 --> 02:35:13.080
the time of one of the things that could be the only thing that keeps GameStop afloat

02:35:13.080 --> 02:35:14.120
for another year.

02:35:14.120 --> 02:35:20.600
Um, so if I were GameStop, I would, uh, I would clear that up real fast or they're going

02:35:20.600 --> 02:35:24.280
to have some people decide to take that pre-order elsewhere.

02:35:24.280 --> 02:35:29.720
Uh, that's a scary thought, but I feel like their upper management is so dumb.

02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:31.800
Um, they probably won't even think of that.

02:35:31.800 --> 02:35:33.800
And that is why GameStop is failing.

02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:35.000
Yeah.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:36.040
So just be careful.

02:35:36.840 --> 02:35:37.320
Yeah.

02:35:37.320 --> 02:35:37.720
All right.

02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:38.280
Great.

02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:38.760
Great.

02:35:38.760 --> 02:35:40.520
Final thought slash last story.

02:35:40.520 --> 02:35:41.320
All right.

02:35:41.320 --> 02:35:42.680
Uh, that's it everybody.

02:35:42.680 --> 02:35:43.560
Thank you, Loki.

02:35:43.560 --> 02:35:44.600
Thanks Dark Sakura.

02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:46.840
Thanks you all for being here tonight.

02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:49.720
We'll be back in seven days to do it all over again until then.

02:35:49.720 --> 02:35:51.240
Have a wonderful night, everybody.

02:35:51.240 --> 02:35:51.960
