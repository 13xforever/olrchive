00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,720
This week, we're reminded that the larger sums of money don't prevent problems from

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,720
happening.

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,440
The MMO New Earth has been delayed from this autumn until next spring, at least.

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,640
Amazon Gaming has now encountered at least two setbacks for New Earth, one for unforeseeable

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,520
reasons, along with the critically muted reaction to its hero arena shooter, Crucible.

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,440
No success is guaranteed, but that shouldn't stop you from trying, much like our hosts

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,920
Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki, who continue to press on with the show where every

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,920
gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:47,440
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,480
where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:55,880
It is Orange Lounge Radio Live yet again tonight with another week of our show.

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:01,480
It is episode number 827 for this July 12th of 2020.

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you live here from our recording studio that we used to

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,160
do for many years.

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,760
We would meet live in person here in this studio, but due to the current state of the

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,680
world, we're separated a little bit and saying hello through the magic of Discord.

17
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,800
Joining me, Rob, here in studio is DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,080
Greetings and salivations.

19
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,080
Welcome back.

20
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,080
Thank you so much for joining us this week.

21
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,080
What did you throw?

22
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,320
Yeah, I was going to say my aim is steadily improving.

23
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,080
I'm trying, but yeah.

24
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,800
So hopefully, I hope you're doing well.

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Hanging in there?

26
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,800
I'm doing alright.

27
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,800
I'm definitely better than last week.

28
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,800
Good.

29
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,480
There's just some stuff going on.

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,200
We've all got stuff.

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,920
I understand.

32
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,920
As I was saying to somebody the other day, it's been a hell of a year today.

33
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,680
I'll go ahead and be honest with it.

34
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,880
My mom is sick with COVID symptoms, and she got tested on Thursday last week, and we don't

35
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,880
find out for a few more days.

36
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:08,260
So yeah, so kind of fun coming two months after my dad dies.

37
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:14,680
Of course, I've been worried and stressed out, but mom is full of spite as ever.

38
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,520
It's where you get it.

39
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,520
In all seriousness.

40
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,700
I expanded on that.

41
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,580
In all seriousness, obviously, fingers and toes crossed, and just hoping for all the

42
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,820
best with your mom.

43
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,200
If it is that, then hopefully the symptoms don't get any worse.

44
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,540
I can cross all that, but if I cross my eyes, they'll get stuck that way.

45
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,980
Mama said so.

46
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,580
Alright, well, we can actually see, thanks to the magic of Discord, if his eyes are stuck,

47
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,580
say hello to Tech...

48
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,460
I wore makeup.

49
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,580
Your face is beat very well tonight, Darzakra.

50
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,580
Too bad the...

51
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,700
Yeah, doing that daytime drag.

52
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,700
Your eyes look great.

53
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,060
Too bad the podcasties can't appreciate it, but that's alright.

54
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:01,180
More incentive to tune in live every Sunday night at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, where we tape

55
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,500
right after the Bobby Blackwell show, twitch.tv slash vog network, and of course you can join

56
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,160
us in our chat room at twitch.tv slash vog network if you want to chat along with the

57
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,160
show.

58
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,020
I'll say hello to you guys in a minute, but I have to say hello to Techmaster Loki, also

59
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,020
on Discord.

60
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,020
Hello.

61
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,020
Hi, Loki.

62
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,140
How are you?

63
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,140
I'm pretty good.

64
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,580
Awesome.

65
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,140
I'm excited to talk about your background video, but obviously we have a little ways

66
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,100
in the show to get to before we can, but yeah.

67
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,220
I'm sure some folks recognize what it is.

68
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,380
I always pick something that's appropriate for...

69
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,020
Well, unless I can't think of anything appropriate to what we're talking about.

70
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,020
Fair enough.

71
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,740
I have to decide, because I've mentioned this on the show before, it's inevitable that the

72
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:45,300
studio is going to change again at some point, and obviously someday, fingers and toes crossed,

73
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,580
I'd love for us all to be back in person.

74
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,340
But I'm kind of wondering if maybe in the new studio, I won't just have a giant green

75
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,620
screen in the background so we can just, you know, put in whatever we want, which I think

76
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,620
would be fun.

77
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,620
Yeah.

78
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,700
It would be like those old clips from the 90s of Conan O'Brien taking the desk out for

79
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,700
a drive.

80
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,260
I don't know if you remember those segments from the...

81
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,260
Yes, I remember that.

82
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,500
It might be dating a little bit.

83
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,500
I don't know.

84
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
All right.

85
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,820
Let's get into some of the news, gaming news.

86
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,460
For our kickoff topic tonight, we've had some very big press conferences.

87
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,300
Well, I don't know if you'd call them press conferences.

88
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,300
They were more like...

89
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,300
Directs, I guess.

90
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,300
Yeah.

91
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,860
Direct updates to the peoples from two companies this week.

92
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,740
We had Ubisoft, Devolver Digital, and Loki.

93
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,100
Tell us a little bit about what we learned about.

94
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:41,580
So if you haven't watched the Devolver Digital Direct or show or presentation in the last

95
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,220
few years, you're really missing out.

96
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:50,100
They are unique, to say the least, and there's this ongoing storyline that goes from each

97
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,100
one.

98
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,140
It's just bonkers.

99
00:04:54,140 --> 00:05:00,740
But they did show a few different games that are going to be coming out pretty soon.

100
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,140
So Shadow Warrior 3 was one that looked pretty awesome.

101
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:10,140
Kind of resembling more like the new Doom Eternal games versus the old Shadow Warrior

102
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,140
stuff.

103
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,140
A game called Fall Guys looks pretty fun.

104
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,140
Carry On, which I swear was already out, but I think that now maybe it's coming out the

105
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,140
consoles.

106
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,140
And this one game, I guess, is called Alesia.

107
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,140
Alesia.

108
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,140
And that looked pretty cool.

109
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:32,140
And of course, more footage of Serious Sam 4, which had been talked about before.

110
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:38,140
But the thing that's in my background and another thing that they announced as well

111
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,420
was this Devolverland Expo.

112
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,540
And what it is, it's a free game you can get on Steam.

113
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,940
And it's a game, and it's also a bunch of their trailers and stuff like that.

114
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:56,260
And so it's a perfect Devolver Digital thing that you really should go check out.

115
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,340
It's a pretty decent game.

116
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,100
So go check it out.

117
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,460
It's like breaking into the E3 Expo.

118
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,460
I mean, they've modeled it after the Los Angeles Expo Center there.

119
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,460
So it's fun, and it's free.

120
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:17,460
Interestingly enough, Loki, I don't always get the hype around the Devolver stuff.

121
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,460
I get that it's cute and it's funny and so forth.

122
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,460
But I thought that this Expo thing that they put out, the Devolverland Expo, is that the

123
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,460
official name of it?

124
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,460
Devolverland Expo?

125
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,460
I don't know.

126
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,460
That's the name of the game.

127
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:36,460
I thought, I feel like it's really clever and very unexpected.

128
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,460
And I downloaded it, and I've actually played a little bit of it.

129
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:47,460
And I was really kind of blown away uncannily how it is the Los Angeles Convention Center,

130
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,460
no doubt.

131
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,460
Like, when you start, you're walking right into it.

132
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,460
And I remember, it's been a few years now, but I remember going through those doors.

133
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,460
Now, obviously, things didn't look so dreary and bio-shocky like they do in that particular demo.

134
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,460
But you go through the doors, and it's like, oh, I remember this lobby.

135
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,460
And I just instinctively was like, well, registration was over here.

136
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,460
And you go around to the left, and there's a place where you get like a t-shirt gun.

137
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:18,460
And that's what, spoiler alert, that's what you can use against some of the sentries that are in there and so forth.

138
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:24,460
So it's an interesting little like, but once you finally get into the South Hall, then it's like, okay,

139
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,460
this is a little different.

140
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,460
Like, it would never have been this crazy in here.

141
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,460
But yeah, it was neat.

142
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,460
I think that is a very clever little thing.

143
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,460
And it actually had me doing some exploring.

144
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:44,460
I watched one of the trailers for that Carrion, was that the name?

145
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,460
Yeah, Carrion.

146
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:50,460
Okay, so I was watching that, and you collect these little pieces,

147
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,460
and I guess you can get unannounced game trailers, too.

148
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,460
So you can actually get like bonus stuff.

149
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:02,460
Although, I was told if you just go into your Steam library and actually go to where the application is,

150
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,460
all the videos are right there.

151
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,460
So you can just spoiler alert yourself if you want.

152
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,460
It's fun.

153
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,460
Well, the other thing, too, which folks didn't notice right away,

154
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:15,460
but the trailer for the actual game, Devolverland Expo, had Steam keys hidden in it

155
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,460
for some of the games that were in there.

156
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,460
So it was kind of neat.

157
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:27,460
I was going to say, though, one of the other things about that,

158
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,460
yeah, it's just bonkers.

159
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,460
You really need to check out the whole direct, if you will.

160
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,460
I mean, it's poking fun, obviously, that all the directs,

161
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:44,460
and they tout the game as it's a first-person marketing simulator, which is kind of silly.

162
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,460
But yeah, it's pretty cool.

163
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:55,460
So aside from Devolver Digital, the other thing that happened earlier today was Ubisoft.

164
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:01,460
So Ubisoft had their kind of Ubisoft Forward event

165
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,460
that showed some more footage of some of these games that had already been announced.

166
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:11,460
So we had more footage for the Assassin's Creed Valhalla.

167
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:19,460
We had a pretty lengthy thing for Watchdog Legends, which looks interesting.

168
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:27,460
There was more stuff for, I think they were talking a little bit about Ghost Recon and Breakpoint.

169
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:38,460
I'm surprised we still haven't seen anything for the, oh god, I don't remember the series now.

170
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,460
Anyways, there was Elite Squad that they were showing off,

171
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,460
which is kind of a weird stylized version of, I guess, the Tom Clancy universe,

172
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:52,460
which, I gotta be honest, looks a whole hell of a lot like Agents of Mayhem, and not in a good way.

173
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:58,460
There's Hyperscape, which is their battle royale game, which I think is already out now.

174
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,460
They showed a little bit of Brawlhalla getting cross-play and stuff.

175
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,460
I think Hyperscape is in an open beta now, because it was already in a

176
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,460
get an invite on Twitch by watching streams sort of thing.

177
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,460
I don't usually super get into a lot of the battle royale games,

178
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,460
just because there's a lot of toxic communities out there with battle royale games.

179
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,460
But I'm curious a little bit about Hyperscape,

180
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,460
because it's got a little bit of that crazy crackdown bit to it,

181
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,460
because there's anti-gravity and you can jump super high and silly things.

182
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,460
Yeah, it looks interesting.

183
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,460
And then they finished off with a trailer for Far Cry 6,

184
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:41,460
which that announcement was leaked earlier when it showed up on some of the online storefronts.

185
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:49,460
And then, of course, there's speculation that the kid in this game

186
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:55,460
is a child version of Vos, who was in Far Cry 3.

187
00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:01,460
His name's Diego in this game, but, I mean, maybe he changes his name. Who knows?

188
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:06,460
But it looks interesting. It's supposed to take place in Cuba or something like that.

189
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,460
So, pretty cool.

190
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,460
So not really a lot of big surprises, though, if I'm not mistaken, though, right?

191
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,460
Like, we knew about Assassin's Creed. We knew, I mean, Far Cry 6, I guess, is a surprise.

192
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,460
But is it?

193
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,460
No, I guess not. But it looks interesting.

194
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,460
I was going to say that we didn't see any Beyond Good and Evil 2,

195
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,460
but they did promise, much like Microsoft did, I'm not sure about EA,

196
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,460
that there's going to be yet another Ubisoft 4 later on in the summer,

197
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,460
and they're going to show off more of that stuff around then,

198
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,460
so we may see some more of that stuff poke up there.

199
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,460
But, I mean, it's neat.

200
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:48,460
Like, Watch Dogs Legion, it's a game that I'm interested in,

201
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,460
but at the same time, I know how I am with games,

202
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,460
and Watch Dogs 2 I was pretty excited for,

203
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,460
and I played it for a few hours and then went on to something else,

204
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,460
and I'm worried that that's going to be the same thing happening here,

205
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,460
but it looks cool. I mean, so I'll give them that.

206
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,460
Let's get some comments from our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

207
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,460
QuestBuster says, Far Cry 6 is going to be interesting.

208
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:14,460
Another open world sandbox. Yay. I love my open world sandbox games.

209
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:19,460
There's a lot of people that do, and there's some people that you kind of get annoyed with it,

210
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:24,460
but that's okay. Different games, I mean, there's literally, like, a million games to play online,

211
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,460
so pick what works for you.

212
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,460
Dark Dead Studio says, Far Cry 6 leaked on PSN, I heard.

213
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,460
I believe, yes, I heard that same rumor, what have you,

214
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:38,460
that one of the overseas stores put the artwork up early.

215
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:43,460
Probably one of those things where it was probably dated for tomorrow,

216
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:48,460
but because tomorrow in Asia is today, if that makes an international dateline play there,

217
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,460
it may have triggered early or something like that. I don't know, I'm just theorizing.

218
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,460
I don't know if they really explained why it happened, but that's just a theory.

219
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:02,460
And let's see, Phoenix7726 says, I keep wondering when we're going to get a modern Assassin's Creed,

220
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,460
and the answer is likely never.

221
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,460
Well, I mean, on one hand it seems a little bit out of character for Assassin's Creed,

222
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:15,460
but on the other, I mean, would like an Assassin's Creed in the future be something like,

223
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,460
I don't know, I think like a Matrix-y style thing, is that something that could ever happen?

224
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,460
Or is that just Watch Dogs?

225
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,460
Well, the whole Assassin's Creed thing I think is supposed to have some,

226
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,460
I don't know the entire storyline for Assassin's Creed,

227
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:33,460
but I know that there is a future element to it because you're exploring memories

228
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,460
of like one of the descendants of all these assassins,

229
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,460
and that's how you're kind of replaying all this stuff.

230
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:44,460
And there is like a modern day story part to it that's going from game to game,

231
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:49,460
but like I said, I never really got past Assassin's Creed 1 as far as holding my attention.

232
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,460
So I don't know what the storyline is,

233
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:56,460
and I know they made a really terrible movie that's based on Assassin's Creed

234
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,460
that we all like to forget about, but it's out there.

235
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,460
So I don't know. I don't know what exactly the storyline is,

236
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:08,460
but I do know that there is something that does take place like in the future.

237
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,460
I don't know what it's building up to,

238
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:14,460
but right now it's just an excuse to be able to go to the different timelines and do all this stuff.

239
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,460
Yeah, and Quest Buster is kind of filling in on that too.

240
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:23,460
Ass Creed has a modern component that briefly explores that side of the narrative,

241
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,460
but it feels mostly like an appendage at this point.

242
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,460
And that's kind of what I like because I remember playing,

243
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,460
I've played the games a little bit, and I remember it like especially in the first, the early games,

244
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,460
they like remastered the early games, and I think that's the one I played.

245
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,460
And I remember it kind of like explains it a little bit,

246
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,460
but it's very much like this is not the point of the game.

247
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,460
Maybe it's like, you know what I mean.

248
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,460
It's kind of one of those things, you're in it for like 30 seconds,

249
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,460
then you're not really thinking about that part anymore, if that makes sense.

250
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,460
Yeah.

251
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,460
Let's see. And then also, VGRealness in chat says,

252
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,460
Watch Dogs fills the void of future Assassin's Creed.

253
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,460
Yeah, I suppose.

254
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,460
And I guess maybe like your modern Assassin's Creed as well.

255
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:08,460
Assassin's Creed is one of those things I think is always going to be a little bit historical,

256
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:13,460
especially when we've seen these modes like in the recent one,

257
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,460
was Odyssey had that whole little like history adventure mode, right?

258
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,460
And there was the one before it had it too, right?

259
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,460
Where it's like, this isn't really the game,

260
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,460
but you can explore and actually learn about history

261
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,460
because we went so far as to render all these historical things.

262
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,460
Why not put this in here as like a learning thing too?

263
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,460
And I imagine this new one's going to have something like that too, just because.

264
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:40,460
I guess. I mean, I want to say, though, like, I don't remember which game it was,

265
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:45,460
but I thought that there was one of the games that they had that you were,

266
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,460
they wanted like, they were touting its historic accuracy,

267
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:54,460
and then they had you fighting like Greek gods or something like that.

268
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,460
I don't want to say it's like something ridiculous like that,

269
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:01,460
but I think that, I don't remember which Assassin's Creed that was,

270
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,460
but like I said, not a franchise I'm into, but it looks cool.

271
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:10,460
And I don't know, Watch Dogs, more my cup of tea, and Far Cry.

272
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:16,460
Although once again, Far Cry, I played a little bit of Five and never finished it.

273
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,460
But most importantly, and I'll admit I missed the thing

274
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,460
because I've been dealing with some other personal stuff this weekend,

275
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,460
but was there a new trailer for a new Just Dance?

276
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,460
Not that I saw. I missed about a minute of it.

277
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:34,460
And so they did not have Just Dance.

278
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,460
Well, that's upsetting.

279
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:40,460
We don't have enough time for all of the nonsense that they would pull off for that.

280
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,460
So no Just Dance this time. Maybe they'll kick off the next one.

281
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,460
But yeah, I mean, I'm all right.

282
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,460
I think there's a random aside, but I think there's a huge sale on PlayStation.

283
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,460
It seems like they always have some type of sale going on,

284
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,460
like they're just rotating them in week after week right now.

285
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:59,460
Well, they were giving away Watch Dogs 2 on PC for free.

286
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,460
I couldn't log into my Ubisoft account. Surprise.

287
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,460
Oh, no.

288
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:07,460
So they are like I remember my password and everything,

289
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:12,460
but I tried resetting it because for whatever reason it wasn't working

290
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:16,460
and I never got an email to reset it. So I was locked out.

291
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,460
I was going to say with the PlayStation sale, the latest Just Dance, like 2020,

292
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,460
is down to like 15 bucks or something like that.

293
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,460
And I was tempted. I'll tell you, I was tempted to pick it up.

294
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,460
I have no idea how those games control anymore.

295
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,460
Like, do they use the camera? Do they use the controller?

296
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,460
I heard there's I think maybe an iPhone app.

297
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,460
I think it's the phone.

298
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,460
Yeah, I think that makes sense.

299
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,460
I think it's your phone now.

300
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,460
I don't think that they use the camera anymore.

301
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,460
Oh, Bobby Blackwolf confirms they use your mobile phone,

302
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,460
which makes sense because mobile phones are like the universal controller these days.

303
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,460
You know, don't you guys have phones?

304
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,460
I just want to bust out DDR.

305
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,460
It works for Jackbox.

306
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,460
I wish I would love a modern like DDR game,

307
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,460
like DDR Ace or something on PlayStation four or five.

308
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,460
I'd live for that. I would be so happy.

309
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,460
I don't know why they won't do it.

310
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,460
Like Konami just doesn't see the money in it or something like I,

311
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,460
I would be so thrilled when make money off of it.

312
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,460
It's very niche for them.

313
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,460
They're going to make Apache slot.

314
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,460
I wish they would just release the PC versions as the software runs on PC.

315
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,460
Anyways, it wouldn't be that difficult.

316
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:29,460
I mean, I know it's not difficult to port it because if you know where the look,

317
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,460
you can get it to run on your PC.

318
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:39,460
So I don't understand why they don't do something like that and have songs available or I don't know.

319
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,460
I mean, I guess they're trying to do that with that.

320
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:49,460
What was the one S or I don't remember the one that they had online recently that was running in unity that we tried it.

321
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,460
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

322
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,460
It was real quick.

323
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,460
That just means they need to bust out the Dreamcast.

324
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,460
Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

325
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,460
You have to stick to the oldies.

326
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,460
I guess this is what it is.

327
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:07,460
I guess maybe they feel dance games have to have these camera and full body motion things

328
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:12,460
because we've kind of lived through the era of Kinect and things like Dance Central

329
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,460
and that now that like maybe a dance pad alone isn't good enough.

330
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,460
I'm using my quoting fingers, good enough.

331
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:25,460
When I I don't know, like I feel like DDR, there's still there are all these new kids playing DDR at the arcade now.

332
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,460
And I don't I don't recognize them.

333
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,460
There's a whole new DDR community, even though like DDR freak isn't really around anymore.

334
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,460
But they're they're forming around things like Facebook and Twitter and so forth.

335
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:42,460
I believe there are music game podcasts that which is really ironic because that's where we started.

336
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,460
But there's a whole new class.

337
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,460
There's like a new class of like music gaming podcast.

338
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,460
And we don't you know, we don't follow that stuff as closely anymore.

339
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:58,460
But the reason why I bring all that up is that I feel like there is a whole new fandom for those types of games.

340
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:03,460
And I think, you know, if they were to just try to do a DDR on PlayStation four or five,

341
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:08,460
it would be not just something for the old fans like us, but the new fans as well.

342
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,460
I really wish they'd give it a shot.

343
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,460
But I can understand that there's a risk when it comes with like the peripherals.

344
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,460
So maybe they need to focus on something that's a little more like a button music game.

345
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,460
And then it's like, oh, but you can use the peripheral as well.

346
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:27,460
I don't have all those peripherals that they'd made for the I mean, let's just here's how silly like their priorities are.

347
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,460
So like I understand that peripherals aren't necessarily high on their radar,

348
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,460
but at the same time, didn't they just have a whole bunch of peripherals for their mobile games?

349
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,460
I mean, like I can we repurpose some of that stuff?

350
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,460
Yeah, I don't know.

351
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:48,460
Anyway, I didn't mean to go on a dance game tangent by talking about just dance, but maybe I did a little bit.

352
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,460
I don't know. So well, there's going to be a lot of people who are happy about just dance stuff,

353
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:58,460
because I mean, especially with this going on with the pandemic, it's a good way to get some exercise.

354
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,460
I mean, honestly, an announcement about just dance is timely.

355
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,460
Yeah, actually, that's part of the reason when I saw the sale, I honestly considered getting it.

356
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,460
And I still might because I think the sale is on through Thursday or what have you.

357
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,460
And it's considering it. It's exactly for that.

358
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,460
I've been trying very hard to go outside and get exercise and go walking.

359
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,460
But the reality is, it was one hundred and five today here in SAC.

360
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:23,460
And so I'm like, yeah, I went out in it for 10 minutes.

361
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:28,460
Yikes. I don't know how hot it is in my garage in order to play DDR.

362
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,460
So like it's like one hundred and twenty degrees in there.

363
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:37,460
In the words in the words of the great Jasmine Masters. No, ma'am.

364
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:46,460
No. Oh, ma'am. Although I hurt my hip a few weeks ago and re sprained it tripping over the cat.

365
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:55,460
Going outside in the weather for just a little bit makes me understand why old people move to Arizona.

366
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:02,460
I was like, oh, it doesn't hurt for five seconds. Oh, it's hot.

367
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:08,460
Pele Hanumea in chat brings up Beat Saber and says Beat Saber type games are replacing them.

368
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,460
I mean, I think there's always going to be like that fresh new thing in any type of genre.

369
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:20,460
And music games are not immune to that either, because like there was DDR and then there was Guitar Hero.

370
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,460
Right. And Rock Band, the plastic instruments really dominated that conversation for a long time.

371
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:30,460
And you're right. You're right. A lot of the VR and music is Beat Saber is very strong in that department, too.

372
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,460
And I think because of Beat Saber's success,

373
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:38,460
you're even seeing non VR things that are trying to do the Beat Saber thing, even though Beat Saber is.

374
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:44,460
And that's another discussion. But I can kind of see that that every genre kind of has its you know,

375
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,460
this is the hot new thing in the genre right now. So.

376
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:53,460
Even when we were you know, we even when we were young kids right around the time this show started,

377
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:59,460
I feel like, you know, we were all playing DDR and then and then one day dark soccer,

378
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:05,460
because this was the day that you and I met one day Milpitas Golf Land got a paraparaparadise.

379
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,460
Yes. And we finally knew half the routine.

380
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,460
We had to go see it because it was like, but it's DDR, but it's like you're using your hands.

381
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:18,460
It's a new thing. It's crazy. Yeah, it's new. Exactly. It's new.

382
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:26,460
Anyway. All right. Well, we have the pink biscuits of doom collecting dust somewhere.

383
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:31,460
Oh, and not the knockoff green biscuits of doom that I think was the other game they put it on Dreamcast.

384
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:36,460
Some other company gets, I believe. Yeah. Anyway. All right.

385
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,460
I don't remember you having a bunch of weird stuff on Dreamcast, so. Yeah.

386
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:47,460
Anyway. OK, so that's that's that for Ubisoft to devolve for, even though it devolved into conversation on old school music games.

387
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:52,460
But hey, that's our audience. Right. And by the way, dark soccer, since I have to say it at some point,

388
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,460
while while Loki was trying to be serious and read the news there.

389
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:03,460
Thank you, Loki. You're in the background changing wigs and playing with our chat room and making all these faces.

390
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:07,460
You keep you keep doing like these all the like. Mm hmm.

391
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:17,460
I'm moving on to three because this one is my wigs have been disused because I'm not doing any cons or anything.

392
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:23,460
So and, you know, I'm not like going all out and wearing a wig cap and doing it right now that I'm not pinning it or anything.

393
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:32,460
I'm just going on the wig like this one. I still have yet to trim the lace on it just because this was going to be some work.

394
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:38,460
I don't have wigs. I just have hats. All right.

395
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,460
Anyway, also some stuff in chat talking about drop mix a little bit.

396
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:48,460
Bobby saying I enjoy drop mix and fuser is basically a digital version of drop mix.

397
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,460
Yeah. Yeah. Their other game that they have coming out. Yeah.

398
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,460
Miltonious Games in chat says, yeah, I like the music mixing of drop mix.

399
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,460
So just being able to do that without physical cards sounds good.

400
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:03,460
Yeah. I think there was fun just in like mixing stuff on that game.

401
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,460
So I'm excited. Is fuser out? I didn't think it was out yet. Right.

402
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,460
I think it's out yet. Yeah. Out soonish in the next couple of months.

403
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:15,460
So I'll check that out, though, because I do have a drop mix thing, but I've played it like twice.

404
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:19,460
I think it'll be fun to try the digital one, I think. All right.

405
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:25,460
Anyhow, let's move on and talk about the types of games that we have been playing this week in a segment called How Is Your Gaming Week?

406
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:31,460
Dark Sakura, how is your gaming week? I played something that was an animal crossing.

407
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,460
What? I didn't play a lot of Animal Crossing. OK.

408
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:40,460
But I want to start off with my little rant about Animal Crossing. OK. OK.

409
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:45,460
So we get to go swimming in the ocean. We can dive.

410
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:51,460
We can get pearls, you know, or can we because I haven't got one yet.

411
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:57,460
I have I have three. Wow. And one of them I got on my alt and you get Pascal.

412
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:02,460
And that was fun. I found out that if you talk to him like at the top of above your island,

413
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:08,460
you can actually watch him swim off into the distance and watch him eat the the scallop that he begged you for.

414
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:13,460
Oh, I've seen him. I've seen him like go off, but I've never seen him actually eat the scallop.

415
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:18,460
That's cute. I had to. I tried to get some shots of it earlier, but it didn't quite work out.

416
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:24,460
So. But and this is a big mix a lot size sitting on a butt.

417
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:32,460
But OK. You can dive off the pier and people like, OK, that's pretty cool.

418
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:45,460
But not people who do lots and lots of trading where you have strangers come into your town who think they can run over your flowers and cut all your fruit and dig up your plant.

419
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:53,460
Well, I mean, I guess I can't really dig up your plants if they're not besties, but it's like a lot of people take a lot of pride in their little towns.

420
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:58,460
I take pride in my little town and my town is fucking adorable. Deal with it.

421
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:09,460
But like. You jump off and you can't block people out of running amok all over your town, you know, like it's just it's just not good.

422
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:16,460
And I found a place to leave feedback for Nintendo, so I'm going to do it. But like this shit don't fly.

423
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:29,460
I've heard this complaint on Twitter and social media. Some people are not happy about how the diving off the pier kind of leads to that sort of exploit, which I think Nintendo probably didn't think of because I don't know.

424
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:36,460
They did it on purpose. Maybe. Well, it's getting in the way of our intended vision for how you play the game.

425
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:49,460
Well, and that was a point that came up when I was talking about it with my friends is that is this Nintendo trying to take a little jab at some of the like the fact that, you know, we're inviting so many people online, especially with the turnip game.

426
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:59,460
Right. Like we've all any of us that have had spiked turnips probably had strangers on our island to help sell the turnips, whether it was like friend of a friend or, you know, through a community or something.

427
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:07,460
And maybe Nintendo's kind of trying to jab at that a little bit where it's like, you know, we really just want you to have people that like you actually know on your island.

428
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:16,460
But I at the same time, like I'm kind of like maybe that's Nintendo's perspective, but at the same time, I'm kind of like I think that's the fun of it is meeting people through this.

429
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:27,460
I think I don't think they just I don't think they anticipated that it would be used in that manner, to be honest, because there's a lot of design decisions that they made in there that doesn't seem to make any sense.

430
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:35,460
Like, for example, whoever whoever plays the game first is the mayor of the town, basically, and gets to make all the decisions where everybody else doesn't really get to do that.

431
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:40,460
And what with that? Well, I understand that. And that's what they probably thought.

432
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:46,460
Well, when most people are just complaining by themselves, it's fine. But I have a family and we all play on the switch.

433
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:51,460
And unfortunately, my youngest son is the one that played it first just by happenstance.

434
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:57,460
And so now he has to make all the decisions and it's really annoying.

435
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:05,460
Yeah. And so, like, you know, we can't progress or progress in the game because, like, he's got all of the decisions that need to be made.

436
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:12,460
And he doesn't like our current administration here in America.

437
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,460
You have a small child in charge.

438
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,460
Well, it's it's it's not as bad as that.

439
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:25,460
You know, the worst the worst thing we have going on is there's like waterfalls in some weird places now.

440
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:29,460
But, you know, other than that, it's it's been all right. Well, you can terraform to you.

441
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,460
You've got that power. So I'm not laughing because it's funny. I'm laughing because it's true.

442
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:39,460
I'm crying inside. But but at any rate, I wanted to address that.

443
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:49,460
And I mean, I also wonder if this might be Nintendo's way to sort of get past the people who are selling things for money, you know, like selling like charging.

444
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:54,460
And then you pay like certain miles tickets or something. And it's ridiculous.

445
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:58,460
And I whatever you know what I.

446
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:09,460
But there are people who are using it just to enhance their, you know, play their enjoyment of the game, who want to sell their turnips and want to trade items and catalog.

447
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:13,460
And I mean, but now, like I was I was veering out a little bit.

448
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:18,460
I was venturing. I was I was letting new people into town. And now I'm back on lockdown.

449
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:26,460
Now, people who come visit me are my friends. Fort Sakura is closed.

450
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,460
Well, and the other will call it's gone back to being a dream.

451
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:41,460
Spoilers, but you know, and there's a few people in in my Facebook group that I would let in just because I've seen them be good players.

452
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:55,460
I've gotten positive feedback on them. I've had them in the town before. I, I think they would be trustworthy, but I don't really go outside of that group anymore, except for maybe a few co workers because we have an Animal Crossing group at my work.

453
00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:04,460
You know, though, he and you know the star sucker I kind of closed Facebook a couple weeks ago just because for my own reasons I'm just over Facebook.

454
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:19,460
But one thing I do kind of miss are those groups because I just had a villager move out two days ago Gigi left, and I was okay with her going because she was a duplicate type she already had a snooty type, but you know I have like maybe like one messenger group

455
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:33,460
that I can kind of send does anybody want Gigi and like literally nobody had an empty plot that day anyway. So it was kind of pointless I was like, well, I guess to the abyss she goes because I don't like it on a normal day I would have posted a group.

456
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:37,460
She'll go into a pool I think of your for your last 10 visitors.

457
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:46,460
Oh, interesting. Okay, so if someone gets an opening there's a chance that she might show up at the campsite or on another island. Hmm. Okay.

458
00:31:46,460 --> 00:32:00,460
I believe that's how it works. I have heard that villagers will move and say they're from another place. If you don't recruit somebody I recruited a normal type to replace her because that's the one thing I needed.

459
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:13,460
Yeah, I'm going to be since I've got, I think, all of the DIY is from the villagers that I'm going to, I don't have to have the different types now in my town so I'm going to be.

460
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:21,460
I already promised him to Gwen, but when it's going to get my Octavian when I bring in either Bruce or Marshall, I haven't decided.

461
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:33,460
Do you know who Alan let go this week and I couldn't believe it. Marina, Marina, I can't believe Oh yeah that's right. He, he still has, he still has Facebook so he probably Oh yeah I think he gave, I think he did give her away.

462
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,460
I think so I think somebody got her.

463
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:47,460
So she didn't go I was, I was so close to trying, I didn't have an opening but I would have loved to have claimed Marina, because I have the other two octopus octopi.

464
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:56,460
Because I have sucker and Octavian and we're never getting rid of sucker, because he's my special child. Yeah, I will I will never let catch up leave on my own.

465
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,460
Julian go because I have his card.

466
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:14,460
And, you know, sometimes the queen needs to move and Julian being my unicorn drag queen. Sometimes she needs to just feel her oats, how, how do you get okay so like I know if you work on your friendship and you give a lot of random gifts.

467
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:27,460
You are actually like I use the app to show like what gifts somebody really prefers. So I tried to do that and and eventually catch up gave me a photo of herself and I love that and from what I understand, that's like the ultimate prize from a villager

468
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,460
right like if they, if they give you a photo, that's it, you've done it you've maxed everything out.

469
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:40,460
So now I'm trying to okay so I'm trying to get others so I'm trying to get one from poncho, who's my little jock bear. And I think he's adorable.

470
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:52,460
And so I keep like every day, I give him a wrapped coconut, because I know if nothing else you get a decent amount of points from a wrapped coconut right, you get a decent amount of points from your wrapped native fruit.

471
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,460
Oh do you okay.

472
00:33:54,460 --> 00:34:10,460
But my thing is that I like giving them close because I like to make them wear ridiculous stuff, I just make sure it's in their favorite color. Hmm. Okay, so for Agnes, she gets black and gray for Dina, she gets to wear a lot of plaid green, you know, I put her in the flannels

473
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,460
I put her in sportswear she's my lesbian.

474
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:18,460
I put Rosie and reds and pinks.

475
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:30,460
I put Julian and blues and purples. Right now he's wearing the vampire clothes and he loves the hell out of that. Roscoe gets mostly black and red and it's all like punk kind of you know hardcore stuff.

476
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:40,460
I put kind of how that's how cherry cherry likes to dress that way to cherries like a hot topic worker. I had cherry in New Leaf.

477
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:53,460
I like cherry. Gotcha. But, you know, it's funny though I have a lot of my OG, you know, my original people, cherry would wear that wig you're wearing.

478
00:34:53,460 --> 00:35:02,460
Well, it's gonna get changed after this segment but you know, I have actually a lot of my original characters except I have Dom and Dom is great.

479
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,460
He's my little wannabe fluffball buff guy.

480
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:13,460
I will tell you my newest villager so you know I went searching for a normal type and I just took the first one I found. Are you ready for the name of the villager I got?

481
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:24,460
I got Norma. Norma the normal. Norma the normal. She's a cow. She's cute. So, anyway.

482
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:38,460
Okay, and I think the internet just froze because I've completely lost the video connection and I'm really worried that it's going to drop completely here in a moment because, yeah, this is really not good.

483
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:45,460
So, I think what I'm going to do is, oh, I'm still on Twitch. It's just Discord that slowed down.

484
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:54,460
Okay, so apparently I've completely lost connection on Discord with my co-host. So, we're gonna just see what happens here.

485
00:35:54,460 --> 00:36:06,460
Discord may have had a hiccup or something like that. Not sure. So, I would, yeah, Jamie's in a very stunning pose where she's frozen, isn't it?

486
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:18,460
Anyway, okay. So, I guess I don't have a choice for the moment. What should I do? I'm going to turn it off and turn it on and off again. Off and on again.

487
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:26,460
And see if that helps. So, let's see what happens if I'm going to disconnect from that. And then I'm going to try to reconnect to that and see if I get my co-host back.

488
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:34,460
And nope, I'm just getting the, oh, nope, nope. Oh, I might have got him back. How about that? Turning it off and on again fixed it. What's that?

489
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,460
I didn't have time to change my wig.

490
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:42,460
Oh, that's okay. It was a little unexpected hiccup there, but that's the perils of doing a live show. Okay, sorry.

491
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,460
I was saying that you stole Dina the first time at my GameCube village.

492
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:50,460
I did, I did. Sorry, it was a little awkward hiccup and I was talking about Norma the Normal, who's a cow.

493
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:56,460
Yeah. So, I was saying that since you stole Dina last time, you get first dibs on Dina this time.

494
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:01,460
Okay, yay. Now, you mentioned you played other stuff, yeah.

495
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:07,460
Yes, I got The Last of Us. I got the remastered one. I do want to play Last of Us 2.

496
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:13,460
So, I figured I should start at the beginning. That and a friend of mine has talked and talked and talked it up.

497
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:20,460
So, I was like, okay, I'm doing it. And I really enjoyed it. It's kind of, well, you know, I was having these problems with my hands.

498
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:26,460
And I do have a little bit of that problem again with holding a PlayStation controller for too long.

499
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,460
And the control scheme is one of those, every button does everything. The menus are weird.

500
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:37,460
So, it's a little bit of getting used to it. But yeah, I cried ugly in the first 10 minutes, you know.

501
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:45,460
So, I had myself a little silence up. And I really like it so far. The remastered one looks really good.

502
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:50,460
The voice acting is, is really good. And you know me, I'm piggy on voice acting.

503
00:37:50,460 --> 00:38:01,460
So, I really, I'm really enjoying it so far. And then I'm still playing Words with Friends, because I'm kind of addicted and you know I'm a word nerd.

504
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:16,460
But there's like this mode in Words with Friends that like I really like. I think it's called like word circle, where you get like a set of letters, and you have to make, you know, as many different words out of it and they kind of are crossword style, right.

505
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:29,460
And I like that because I don't know what it is, I guess that Words with Friends thinks that people doing that mode. I have no vocabulary because I'm like, you got a hidden word, you got a hidden word, you got a hidden word.

506
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:45,460
I'm like, but I want the words out of the puzzle. You know, and so I actually found a game that is the same thing and like it's got ads so, but it's not as bad but it must think that that, you know, toddler because it's called Words with Friends.

507
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,460
I kind of enjoy it.

508
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:56,460
And I'm waiting to get more, more stuff in pattern, because I love pattern, and I'm very very sad that there are no more puzzles for me to do.

509
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:03,460
I'm back to playing like the mahjong puzzle games too because I can do it mindlessly while I'm doing other things.

510
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:16,460
Oh, oh, oh, and new acquisition of Bloodstained Curse of the Moon 2 which I know we're going to discuss in a bit. Dan is on it. He loves it.

511
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,460
I love Zangetsu.

512
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:32,460
I love how completely off like the, the other Bloodstained game that this is like every one of these Curse of the Moon ones both of these are like two different universes almost just with the same characters kind of au shenanigans.

513
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,460
But it's really cool the music's great.

514
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:42,460
Dan seems to really enjoy it I have other games to play and Dan is taking taking it over.

515
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:53,460
And sometimes it's really hard to play some games when we also have our more recent acquisition in pinball in the other room which is AC DC one of the limited editions.

516
00:39:53,460 --> 00:40:10,460
And we are borrowing Guardians of the Galaxy right now so it's kind of annoying because I catch myself singing along with like the soundtrack as we're going along, and to the point where I've got stuck on a feeling on my head and repeat, and I sing it to the cat.

517
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,460
That's my gaming week.

518
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:25,460
Alright, nice. I will be very curious. I almost feel like you're just discovery path with the last of us is, you know, this is the type of thing we've done before like both you and I arrived to the Mass Effect series like we were very late to the party.

519
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,460
We were very fast.

520
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,460
We looked fierce in those wigs.

521
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:41,460
But we showed up late to the party and played the whole trilogy and it's like now we're in love with that. So I'm very curious, even though I don't see myself taking that same adventure through the last of us because I told you this before.

522
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:49,460
I don't think I'm okay with the level of violence in those games for me personally, you know, and again this is just a personal thing like again, I'm not saying they're bad games.

523
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:56,460
In fact, from everything I've heard about them and I have spoiled myself on the second one I'm not gonna be a jerk and say anything, but I know I'm not going to play us I kind of spoiled myself.

524
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:13,460
And after reading about it I was like, okay, I can see where that is really like that's like definitely thought provoking like it's definitely like a, and that's what really know what you're talking about it's about the don't spoil it for our listeners, but it's

525
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:26,460
the one thing that's got parts of the community up in arms. Yeah, it's an art should make you should be thought provoking so I think in that regard.

526
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:34,460
If, if art makes you go, or, you know, then it's not doing what it's supposed to art is supposed to be provocative. Yeah.

527
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,460
So, just like that way of Jamie's wearing.

528
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:41,460
Oh, hey, wait till you see the next one. It sucks.

529
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,460
All right, low key.

530
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,460
Low key. How was your gaming week.

531
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:52,460
So I did play a few things this week, mainly Minecraft is still.

532
00:41:52,460 --> 00:42:03,460
I mean just still building more complex things. I dug out a third basement in the house so it's just massive I really need to do a video for it.

533
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:15,460
And then, aside from that Orna, and then I played a bit of the Devolver land Expo. And also I played a little bit of Animal Crossing.

534
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:22,460
I finally got my tent into a house. And that was about it.

535
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,460
That's it.

536
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,460
Yeah, that's it. All right.

537
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:41,460
Then let's talk about my gaming week and the types of games I've played this week, I played also Minecraft, that might shock you, but there was a there was a little I actually bought into one of those little ad ad things that was on my Xbox dashboard, because

538
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:50,460
I was in the game pass section and it said there was some new add on that was like a runner type thing and it kind of had like a futuristic look to it I was like oh is this like a chart everything.

539
00:42:50,460 --> 00:43:05,460
So there's like a free custom game add on thing that they have. It's like and it's that's what it is an endless runner you're basically jumping over the things and collecting items and so forth, while the background is like slowly trying to catch up to you.

540
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:20,460
It's just really cool like I knew this was happening that people are building meta games in Minecraft, and that Minecraft in a way is almost its own game creation engine at this point too, but it's just it's neat to I admittedly have not played a lot of the products

541
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:33,460
that's come from that. So I like that Microsoft is kind of giving this one, a little boost by making it free obviously to check out, but also just kind of like showing us that hey look at the crazy things people are doing in Minecraft, because I did play it a few

542
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:41,460
months ago. I mean it's, yeah, it's not lots of you've played this game before it's nothing earth shattering but it was just kind of cool that was in Minecraft.

543
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:55,460
There's lots of like different little game modes and stuff that people make that are some of them can be pretty complex like they have sky block is a pretty popular game mode and they have a lot of these like infinite sky blocks and stuff that'll kind of keep the game

544
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:17,460
What I like about those is it kind of gives you more objectives to try to hit. I know in the Java version they've added more of these. It's not achievements, they call them like advancements, I guess, and it's like little mini goals to kind of keep you motivated in the game, even after you beat stuff.

545
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:31,460
And since they don't really have it yet in the pocket edition or bedrock. This is kind of cool. In the meantime, plus there's like lots of like unique game modes that you can play on all these different servers and stuff and that's all free.

546
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:44,460
But yeah, and myself like I've run add ons on my realm, and some I've even created from scratch so it's it's fun to be able to do that kind of stuff and modify the game to however you want.

547
00:44:44,460 --> 00:45:13,460
So yeah, I love looking at that type of stuff on Minecraft that's that's been really fun and inventive. So I've been playing other stuff to the same old standbys like Orna, Pokemon Go. I've, I've oddly this week been playing probably more Ingress than I usually do like I've been going pretty hard this week and I'm sure the opposing team is like, what the hell has gotten into him? And the answer is quarantine has been a big part of that, because the nice thing about Ingress is either I'm playing outdoors like I'm walking in a big

548
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:37,460
park or going to take a portal outdoors, or I'm in my car. And both of those places are pretty safe. You know what I mean? So it's like, it's yeah, it's a fun and it's like a good excuse to get out of the house and like do something, you know, because it's like, we can't just, oh, go to the mall and just hang out. Well, I mean, I guess technically you can, but you know, do I want to do that right now? Not really.

549
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:46,460
Well, one of the things you're missing on Facebook is all the events for going to see movies, like drive in movies at the mall is the new thing that malls are doing, it seems like.

550
00:45:46,460 --> 00:46:01,460
Well, hey, you know, I understand these are these are crazy ass fucking times and they've got to do what they've got to do to stay in business. And as long as it's being respectful of the things we need to do to stop COVID from spreading, which a drive in event is, then I'm living for it.

551
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:13,460
Honestly, I would give a lot to be able to go to like that drive in drag show. And I know Jamie's got to be thinking this, too. I think it's in Chicago or something. They're taking some drive in movie theater and turning it into a drag show.

552
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:24,460
They're going to have drag queens perform and then like show it on the movie screens as it's happening on this stage, like way down there. And I'm like, it's kind of kind of amazing, actually. So all right.

553
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:37,460
This wig needs some love. I just pulled it right out of the bag. V.G. realness and chat says, I'm loving the show within a show. Yeah, dark soccer's dark soccer's. Meanwhile, she's doing like a monologue called Wigs Upon Wigs over there.

554
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:51,460
Where she's number three. She's OK. No, it's not just that you're putting on wigs. It's that you keep doing these looks to the camera. You're like, I'm a model. Don't tell. I have a secret. I'm on a video game podcast.

555
00:46:51,460 --> 00:47:05,460
But don't tell you like doing soccer is secret. And then you're like, I'm going to put this moment on Instagram over here. Yes, I am. Look, see, CJ is my favorite character in Animal Crossing. I wonder why.

556
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:13,460
Like it's not giving me like it's like they're together anyway. All right.

557
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:18,460
Anyway, other games that I've been playing this week besides those other usuals.

558
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:28,460
So Soul Calibur six is on Xbox Game Pass and I played it a little bit on PC, but I was like, I'm going to play it again now that it's on Xbox.

559
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:34,460
And it's really fun to get in there and design your own character. I think they did a good job with the single player campaign, too.

560
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:41,460
It kind of throws back a little bit to part two, honestly, for me, although I know all the Soul Calibur games have had like, you know, kind of like a mission mode.

561
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:48,460
But I'm for some reason reminded of part two. My only complaint about Soul Calibur six on Xbox. Holy shit.

562
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:53,460
The loading times. Holy shit. They're bad.

563
00:47:53,460 --> 00:48:00,460
And maybe it's because I'm on an original Xbox, but I can and keep in mind it's on Game Pass, so it's all digital.

564
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:06,460
I can't imagine how bad it would be if I still had the disk. The disk must copy everything to the drive.

565
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:11,460
It's the only way it would work. But the loading times. Wow. They're they're bad. They're very noticeable.

566
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:18,460
Otherwise, it's a fun game. And I like they they do some like the supers from like Super Street Fighter four and stuff.

567
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:22,460
And it is really over the top stuff. So that's yeah, that's kind of fun.

568
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:27,460
Bobby Blackwell says all Xbox one and PS4 games copy the whole disk to the drive.

569
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:36,460
Yeah. I mean, I guess I thought there were some that would still retain like movies, but I guess that's more of a trick back from the PlayStation one and PlayStation two days.

570
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:42,460
So excuse me, but I have heard Blu-ray drives are notoriously slow.

571
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:48,460
That like doesn't totally surprise me. Anyway, other games I played this week.

572
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:54,460
So, OK, this is bad. I can't remember the name of this game, but it's also on Game Pass.

573
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:57,460
I'm hoping Loki or Dark Soccer. One of you guys knows this game.

574
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:01,460
I or or our chat. I think it's called Chrono World or something like that.

575
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:06,460
Maybe cross world. Somebody in channel. No, it's new. They just put it on Game Pass.

576
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:11,460
Is it cross code? Is that it? Cross code. OK.

577
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:17,460
OK. Sorry, it's cross code. OK. That yes, that is it. Maybe I'm thinking of the game within the game.

578
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:24,460
So the whole setup is that like and maybe this is like a spoilery type of thing, but not really, because I'm only like I just beat chapter two.

579
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,460
And this is something that comes up in chapter one.

580
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:33,460
But it's like you're a character in an MMO who's been like kicked out of the MMO, basically.

581
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:41,460
And now you exist like in the game master space and they go to put you back in the game.

582
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:43,460
And there's a whole nother plot, I'm sure. And it goes further.

583
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:47,460
But there's a whole game within a game type of element, like a dot hack or something.

584
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:51,460
You and while jail. Not really. Wow. Jail. But it's a ship.

585
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:55,460
You end up on a ship. But anyway, I'm actually really into it.

586
00:49:55,460 --> 00:50:01,460
It's funny that I can't remember all these details because I am actually really into it because it really reminds me of like Zelda.

587
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:10,460
I would say like the action of a Zelda game meets the music of a Secret of Mana or Chrono Trigger type of game meets maybe that.

588
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:18,460
It's a really interesting little throwback to like all of those Super Nintendo RPGs, like all at once.

589
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:22,460
And I think it's kind of interesting. It has an interesting story.

590
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:27,460
Like I wasn't expecting some of those like, oh, this is kind of the direction it's going.

591
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:30,460
It's interesting. I like it.

592
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:37,460
Going in chat. As 200 Matt says, so Tron. I don't know. Maybe a little bit. A little bit Tron.

593
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:41,460
Like dot hack meets something else.

594
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:49,460
Yeah. Or that's what Sia Dabiri says. Dot hack meets Wreck-It Ralph. Yeah, there's that, too.

595
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:57,460
So, yeah, I'm into it. Yeah. And if you like those old Super Nintendo type of games, especially if you have Xbox Game Pass,

596
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:01,460
because I see Miltonius Games in chat says, I guess I'm downloading this. Interesting.

597
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:05,460
If you have Xbox Game Pass, by all means, get it, because it's good.

598
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:09,460
But it is also on Switch. And I think it's on all the consoles.

599
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:17,460
I don't see why it wouldn't be on PlayStation. So I would say, you know, I don't think it's probably an expensive game, maybe 15, 20 bucks.

600
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:21,460
And if you enjoy those Super Nintendo types of games, I'm sure this is going to be right up your alley.

601
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:26,460
So I would I would recommend it. So I'm hoping to play more of that. That's for sure.

602
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:33,460
Bobby says it was released on PC in 2019 and it's on PC Game Pass.

603
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:37,460
So somehow I just missed it on the PC version. I've been playing it on Xbox.

604
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:44,460
But whatever that happens sometimes, it's like, oh, I didn't know this game was on PC because I found it on my console first or vice versa.

605
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:49,460
So like that pinball game I played a few weeks ago was on, which is the one I said Dark Soccer should play.

606
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:53,460
It was on Xbox Game Pass that just totally remind me of like Devil's Crush.

607
00:51:53,460 --> 00:52:01,460
I played that on PC first. But of course, it's on Xbox as well. So it just depends on, you know, where you like to get stuff.

608
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:07,460
If you're done with your gaming week, there's actually one other thing I forgot about. Yeah, go for it.

609
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:15,460
I'm going to be doing a charity stream in Sisterface because I'm going to be doing it, like I said, for charity through for we haven't decided on which one.

610
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:22,460
But on my Twitter at Dark Sakura, I have a pull up. It's up for the rest of the week.

611
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:28,460
I might extend it, but I want someone to help me pick the first of three games I'm going to start off with.

612
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:35,460
So it's either going to be Dream Daddy or Hot to Full Boyfriend or I Love You, Colonel Sanders.

613
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:41,460
I'm going to. That's a tough decision. Why not all three?

614
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:45,460
Because I can't play all three simultaneously. There's only one me.

615
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:49,460
Have you tried? I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

616
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:55,460
It'd be like just like different recordings of me in different wigs, you know, all in the same Sisterface.

617
00:52:55,460 --> 00:53:00,460
Yeah. But then you'll get to see my real drag. All right. Well, that'll be fun.

618
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:05,460
My real drag. Make sure you send me the details on when I can make sure we're hosting it here at VOG.

619
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:09,460
So I'm still working on on the on the details, but it's coming up.

620
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:14,460
I'm just right now gathering the stuff together. But you will see Dark Sakura.

621
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:19,460
You'll see the Kiki. Good times. All right. All right.

622
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:23,460
Well, that's it for our gaming weeks. We're going to get into some gaming news just real quickly.

623
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:30,460
First, I just want to put like a personal thing out there. And don't worry, this won't be as yelling as last week.

624
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:41,460
Although this says this has been a rough week. Those of you that follow me on Twitter know that my dad had an urgent situation on Friday morning and I had to go over to his house and call 911 on him.

625
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:50,460
And it turns out that he actually had a stroke. So I'm really glad that I did call 911 on him that because I actually I thought he had a concussion.

626
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:54,460
And I was like, well, he needs to be evaluated for this. And I don't I don't want to move him or whatever.

627
00:53:54,460 --> 00:54:00,460
So luckily, even though I figured it was the wrong thing, it kind of led to all the right decisions.

628
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:06,460
So I'm thankful I got him in when he did, because it does seem like he will be OK.

629
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:15,460
He's going to need to go through some physical therapy and so forth. This whole thing's been very scary, but it could have been a lot worse if we'd let it go longer or what have you.

630
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:21,460
So anyway, my point is, I don't want to burden you too much with with sad news or what have you.

631
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:30,460
But I did want to just say thank you because I know a lot of you have said some very kind things on Twitter, as well as, you know, the Vogue Network Discord and places like that.

632
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:37,460
So I just want to take a minute to really thank you guys for the support and everything. And yeah, it means a lot.

633
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:43,460
So thank you very much. So. All right. We can go back to video games. Loki.

634
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:48,460
All right. So let's talk a little bit about Epic and Sony.

635
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:55,460
So Epic Games, of course, really big or trying to be big in the PC space.

636
00:54:55,460 --> 00:55:00,460
And before you had a lot of money going into them from Tencent and whatnot.

637
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:14,460
But now we have Sony actually purchasing 250 million dollars of stake in the company and they're promising to, I guess, collaborate with them.

638
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:29,460
So throughout our investment, we explore opportunities for further collaboration with Epic to delight and bring value to consumers and the industry at large, not only in games, but also across rapidly evolving digital entertainment landscapes.

639
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:48,460
So I have no idea what that's supposed to mean as far as, you know, maybe exclusives for certain things, maybe with the trend of a lot of their PC titles coming to their PlayStation 4 titles coming to PC, that it'll continue going to epic first.

640
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:53,460
Well, something to think about, too. And Bobby talked a little bit about this on his show.

641
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:58,460
I'm going to get into that in a moment. But I'm certainly Sony is more than just a video game company.

642
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:05,460
Sony also is in the habit of doing, you know, music and movies and they're a multi type of entertainment company.

643
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:11,460
So and Bobby went into this on his show a little bit. So I'll kind of like defer you to check out his show.

644
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:25,460
And I'm not going to try to repeat it too much. But the gist of it is, if you look at the way some TV shows are made right now, it's not or not just TV shows, excuse me, but even some movies is that it's not necessarily just green screen.

645
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:34,460
But you can have the projection of the unreal or excuse me, the unreal. Yeah. Unreal engine only virtual sets. Exactly.

646
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:42,460
With the virtual sets and all of that. So if you think about it from that regard, because a lot of people are kind of joking, like, oh, 250 million.

647
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:49,460
How I mean, it doesn't take fortnight long to make that much money. But maybe I mean, sure. Sure. The game thing might be part of it. Who knows?

648
00:56:49,460 --> 00:57:03,460
Maybe Sony's trying to buy some exclusives for fortnight. Who knows? But I think it would make a lot of sense, especially in the current state of the world with COVID and this whole thing being quite the uncertainty.

649
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:08,460
And we don't know how long it's going to be before maybe we can make movies the old fashioned way again.

650
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:18,460
It might make a lot of sense for Sony to be exploring these types of virtual filmmaking type of things to provide these different backgrounds.

651
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:28,460
And so that maybe it would take less people on a set. I mean, obviously, it would still take a lot of people designing it and doing the programming and so forth, but they wouldn't necessarily be on the set.

652
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:42,460
So it's a way to kind of do things a little more distant. So when you kind of pair those things against each other, like in a way to me, like it makes a lot of sense where a relationship like that could be really fruitful, not just necessarily gaming.

653
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,460
Yeah, I guess we'll have to see what they do with it.

654
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:53,460
Yeah. Questbuster in chat says, I mentioned this on Bobby's show, but it's interesting seeing how valuable Epic has become over the years.

655
00:57:53,460 --> 00:58:06,460
$250 million from Sony bought them 1.4% stake in the company. $330 million back in 2012 from Tencent bought them 40%. Yeah, that's right. The cost has gone way, way up. That's for sure.

656
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:17,460
SG100Matt says, for movies and TV, everyone would just go to ILM for them to do everything that involves special effects, but that's Disney now. So not everyone wants to go Disney every time.

657
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:32,460
Yeah. So I think that could be an element of it is that it's not just necessarily Fortnite as much as it might be Epic's game making abilities and the game maker engine and how that can be utilized in other mediums such as filmmaking,

658
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:42,460
because I've heard of Unreal Engine being used in things like teaching, and there's other industries and other places that that engine can develop things for.

659
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:55,460
I know one of the focuses that they have on the training that's online is with architecture and designing buildings and interiors, decorating that type of stuff.

660
00:58:55,460 --> 00:59:02,460
It's used a lot for that as well. So, yeah, be interesting to see what they do with it.

661
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:07,460
Yeah, for sure. All right, well, moving on, let's talk about a new game announcement that happened this week.

662
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:15,460
So Nintendo was hyping a treehouse event where they were going to be showing more footage of the new Paper Mario game, the Origami King that's coming out pretty soon.

663
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:20,460
So they did a treehouse event to show some footage for that, but they also dropped on Twitter.

664
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:28,460
By the way, WayForward is going to be announcing a new game that's new for them, not a new IP or something like that.

665
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:35,460
And this caused social media to go fucking nuts because WayForward has done a lot of really quality retro revivals.

666
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:40,460
I believe they were behind the Blaster Master Zero stuff, if I'm not mistaken, right?

667
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:45,460
Certainly WayForward is synonymous with Shantae and those types of games.

668
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:49,460
Didn't they do the DuckTales remaster as well?

669
00:59:49,460 --> 01:00:02,460
Yes, they did. So a lot of people, the first thing was, holy shit, Nintendo has given them Metroid, I don't know, insert fanboy thing here, and WayForward is going to announce this.

670
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:07,460
Well, Nintendo had to go so far as to say it's not a first party title.

671
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:12,460
They actually did that rare follow-up tweet where they were like, calm the fuck down. They didn't say that, but that's what I heard.

672
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:16,460
Calm the fuck down, it's not a first party game, it's a third party game.

673
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:23,460
But then everybody, and myself included, I was like, I would love for it. How about the Guardian Legend? How about a Konami title?

674
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:31,460
You know, but I did put the footnote, I did say, I know I'm just hyping myself up, these things are not going to happen and we'll just be happy with whatever it is.

675
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,460
It's time for Elibits to come back.

676
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:45,460
Well, imagine the internet's response. Imagine everybody hypes themselves up and imagine the response when WayForward comes out and announces, Bakugan, champions of Vestroya.

677
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:54,460
And everybody's like, Bakugan? The fuck is that? And that was, it came out on the Wii and if you see the art, you'll be like, oh yeah, I've seen this game before.

678
01:00:54,460 --> 01:01:01,460
It was a game that was on the Wii and so forth. So WayForward is bringing it back and it's a game where you can, and it's going to launch on November 3rd.

679
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:10,460
And you can build your own team. It's an action RPG style game. There actually is a TV series that goes with this and it's an original story that will expand on that.

680
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:16,460
There's 100 different quests in the game, over 100 different quests. You collect different Bakugan, it's kind of like Pokemon like that.

681
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:23,460
You collect 80 different ones. There's 200 different ability types and upgrades. There will be online head-to-head multiplayer and so on.

682
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:31,460
And you know, it's funny because there are a lot of people that were like, Bakugan? But there's also some people that were like, fuck yeah, I liked Bakugan. I'm glad this is coming back.

683
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:39,460
So it's a little bit niche and I think, again, people set the bar really high on what they were expecting, but that's what the internet does.

684
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:44,460
And if you are not used to the internet setting themselves up for disappointment, I don't know, you must be new here.

685
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:54,460
But Bakugan, it's an interesting choice. I'll say that. And that's not me being shady. It just is, wow, you know, of all the different games out there, it's interesting they're going back to this one.

686
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:57,460
But they have the TV series and all those tie-ins too.

687
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:06,460
Miltonious Games and Chat says, that announcement made the live chat for that treehouse insufferable.

688
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:11,460
Everyone being rude and impatient during the Paper Mario stuff just to be angry at the announcement.

689
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:22,460
For me personally, when it comes to these big events, this is why I always, always, always turn chat off and just do a full screen theater mode on my PS4.

690
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:29,460
I never read chat during these types of events because the chat is shit. I just, it's horrible.

691
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:39,460
The only time I have ever experienced good chat rooms, I would say for the most part, the awesome games done quick, they usually have pretty good chats.

692
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:48,460
But what really, like, I don't think chat will ever be this good again, was that first Bob Ross marathon they had on Twitch.

693
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:59,460
That was pure and wholesome. And I don't think I'll ever be in a Twitch chat, well, besides you guys, of course, I'll ever be in a Twitch chat room that great again.

694
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:08,460
So, yeah. Anyway, other comments in chat. I want to make sure I got what VG Realness said because it is very true.

695
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:17,460
VG Realness says, always go into any type of Nintendo Direct or event with the utmost minimal expectations and you will always be satisfied.

696
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:22,460
After they showed Yarn Yoshi for like a year on Nintendo Directs, I learned my lesson.

697
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:26,460
That part. That is exactly correct.

698
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:28,460
Alright.

699
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:32,460
Agdefton chat says, never read chat except VOG chat. Fair.

700
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:36,460
Alright, moving on. Let's get into another story.

701
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:41,460
So, I think this one's yours, Dark Sakura. So, you have to take a break from your meta game and your camera up there.

702
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:44,460
I got to do something, right?

703
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:50,460
So, going back to Ubisoft, there's more drama.

704
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:53,460
And they actually...

705
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:56,460
I'm going to step off cam for just a moment, but I'll be listening. Sorry.

706
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,460
Wait, I'm stealing my thunder.

707
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:00,460
Okay, I see how it is.

708
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:05,460
Anyway, Ubisoft has released an announcement.

709
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:09,460
Yes, that was a Sailor Venus pinned RG Realness. I have the full set of the original five.

710
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:17,460
But at any rate, Ubisoft has announced that they are having a departure of many of their top officials.

711
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:23,460
Including their human resources director, their second highest official.

712
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:27,460
I'm going to mispronounce Serge Hasouette.

713
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:33,460
Hasouette has quit his post as Chief Creative Officer immediately.

714
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:38,460
And that his role will be taken over by the CEO, Yves Guillemot.

715
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:49,460
And the quote from Guillemot says, Ubisoft has fallen short of its obligation to guarantee a safe and inclusive working environment for its employees.

716
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:53,460
So, do you know what that goes back to?

717
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:58,460
It goes back to quite a bit more harassment and misconduct.

718
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:01,460
It's actually pretty terrible.

719
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:06,460
And I'm really glad that people are speaking up about it.

720
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:13,460
That people are putting their foot down and letting them know that these things won't be tolerated anymore and going very public with it.

721
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,460
We need more of this.

722
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:22,460
So, we're definitely seeing the resurgence of Me Too and we are seeing these voices being heard finally.

723
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:31,460
And so, their HR person, Cecile Corneille, has also resigned, like I said earlier.

724
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:38,460
And they are going to be appointing a new global human resources manager.

725
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:48,460
Now, even with all of this, they are not, well, by are not, mean did not address misconduct issues during the digital showcase.

726
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:51,460
And I'm going to read the direct quote from their Twitter.

727
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:56,460
Ubisoft Forward comes during a time of big internal change.

728
01:05:56,460 --> 01:06:04,460
Because all the content has been prerecorded, we want to recognize that the issues we're currently dealing with won't be addressed directly in the show.

729
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:07,460
We still have significant work to do and are committed to this process.

730
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:10,460
We will provide more updates soon.

731
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:28,460
So basically, they're not glossing over it, but it, it looks like that they are acknowledging it but I mean if this stuff was recorded then, yeah, there's no way they can time travel and do it with enough time and it's already been done.

732
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:42,460
And then I mean there's also, I mean there's a bunch of other announcements come up for sexual misconduct, like over 50 in the Super Smash Brothers community.

733
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:53,460
There were the ones that I spoke about a few weeks ago, and it's really time that people in, you know, especially I'm just gonna go say it.

734
01:06:53,460 --> 01:07:06,460
Don't go, not all men because it is enough cisgender men who are pulling this shit that we have to be wary of all of them, except the people I know.

735
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:09,460
You guys are cool.

736
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:25,460
Trust is something that's earned. Trust is not something that's automatically granted in a position of power and I think we talked about this. I don't know if it was two weeks ago or last week but I remember having a tangent where it was, this is really a call against people in power

737
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:37,460
and do they deserve that power, and if they're going to use that power for bad things that power is going to be taken away and there's going to be that accountability and I think there's a big kind of reckoning with that concept in all sorts of places right now.

738
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:48,460
There's a lot of what you see with the racial injustice and the police and that whole thing is that police are in a position of power. And the reason why they have protections to let them abuse it.

739
01:07:48,460 --> 01:08:02,460
And so that's why people are saying they want to defund the police because these this power, if it's not being used for good things should be taken away. So my point is, is that I think that's kind of like the common thread you're seeing in a lot of these

740
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:16,460
social movements that are going on right now is kind of questioning why are these people in power, are they using power for good things. Why should they continue to be in power, you know, that being said, there actually is.

741
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:22,460
Well, I mean it's no secret that probably my favorite other podcast out there is stuff mom never told you.

742
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:35,460
The July 3 episode is a really good one to listen to talking about the state of me to during the pandemic, you know, going on in July, but it brings up a lot of what's going on in the gaming community.

743
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:48,460
Definitely, definitely worth a listen to it's a very good episode, and it goes into a lot of some of the same things that I've said so I think it would definitely be worth a listen to.

744
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:56,460
Let me go ahead and give Matt a chance to jump in with the next story because it just like you actually referenced it a second here.

745
01:08:56,460 --> 01:09:16,460
Darcyra just keeps on going so you know you have, you know, allegations in major AAA companies. And of course there's been a countless, not countless but lots of allegations of misconduct in very is in gaming communities and one of those in particular

746
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:30,460
is the Super Smash Brothers community. So, over the last few weeks has been about 50 different allegations made from the community regarding different people in the community.

747
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:48,460
And just, it's been all sorts of things from allegations of rape sexual assault preying on minors grooming underage players I mean it's just, it's, it's ridiculous that this is just everywhere.

748
01:09:48,460 --> 01:10:04,460
But yeah, it's a lot of people have kind of dropped out of, you know, competing in the Smash Brothers community because of this. I know that there's been several people that have been taken out of the tournaments.

749
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:14,460
I don't know how people can get their arms around this kind of stuff. It's just, I think it's just everywhere and unfortunately we are only hearing about, you know, a small percentage of them.

750
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:35,460
Yeah, and I mean, and I think the number I heard was that there's 50 allegations of 50 different in the Smash community. I mean, 50, 50, that is all. I mean, one is too many I mean we all know that but I mean that just really like is like holy God, you know, it's, it's, it's a tricky

751
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:50,460
And it's a tricky story because on one hand you're like, I that's horrible that these events ever happened on the same token, it's coming to light and maybe we can do something about it now and clean this up because, you know, we might be you know losing these people

752
01:10:50,460 --> 01:11:07,460
from from the the tournament scene or whatever but think about all the people that and again this goes back to being in a position of power and what you do with that power. Think of all the people that think of all the people that other people in power suppressed from wanting to join the community.

753
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:22,460
Like for for everyone who speaks up, there are other people who have not spoken up. You know there's, and, and this is just more of a general thing but at least for for people who are assigned, you know, female at birth.

754
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:35,460
We are raised with this conditioning that we're just supposed to take it that this is the way it is that our voice isn't as important that we're supposed to worry about the needs of others before ourselves and we're all.

755
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:46,460
Yeah, it's bullshit. We have as much right to anger. We have as much right to protect ourselves we have as much right to have power and want things as anybody.

756
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:57,460
And, and I think that the old guard is starting to realize that they're losing their ground, and it's, it's really time to hold those asses to the fire. Yeah.

757
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:14,460
And, you know, there's those types of things those types of traumatic experiences that people go through whether it's you know these very very very serious allegations of sexual assault or so forth or, you know, even, even folks that bully other people and use,

758
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:34,460
you know their positions of power to, you know, bully or traumatize other people can can can hold people back from wanting to join a space like designing video games like entering these types of tournaments and so forth and, or maybe not wanting to be on

759
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:46,460
Twitch, a few years earlier. I don't know. Anyway, well, and by statistics, women do make up half of the gamers. We are, I mean it is split.

760
01:12:46,460 --> 01:13:01,460
Yet, you know, it's been such a boys club for so long that, you know, there's this, you know, this myth versus the reality, and it's time. It's time for people to realize that we are half of it.

761
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:09,460
We deserve respect, everyone deserves respect, but it's time to start paying attention to it. It's long last time to start paying attention.

762
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:13,460
I'm sorry Loki I took your story.

763
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:17,460
Oh, that's fine. We bring stories to the table for discussion that's what it is.

764
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:26,460
Tiger con chat says you're in a place of business, and you're supposed to treat it as one. This is not some bar where you can go mingle with others and hoping you'll hook up.

765
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:29,460
That's a really good point.

766
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:43,460
And I know sometimes I give Tiger Claw a lot of shit for some of like the constant updates on the Sonic movie and things like that, but I'm gonna give credit where credit is due, because that is an excellent point I want y'all to think about for a little bit.

767
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:56,460
Especially because we know that Twitch is a place where some people have gone to want to create their certain types of careers, right like I'm going to stream full time and that's going to be my job.

768
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:13,460
Well then, you got to put on your big boy pants and treat it like a job, and exactly that. That means when you go to these mixer parties and so forth that E3 or Twitch con or something like that, you are still representing you and your brand.

769
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:25,460
That is not the time to be a sleaze. Unless your brand is sleaze, I suppose, but I don't think a sleaze brand tends to do very well.

770
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:39,460
So, that's a very excellent point in my opinion. If you want Twitch streaming to be your job, if you want competitive video games to be your job, treat it like it's your fucking job.

771
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:41,460
Because it is.

772
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:43,460
Because it is, and that's what you want it to be.

773
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:55,460
Alright, let's see, I'm looking at other... GGRama S says true, but there is after hours which causes all this.

774
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:57,460
Well, I think...

775
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:59,460
Oh no, this shit happens at work.

776
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:09,460
Of course, of course. But when virtualness is your workplace, right? Then it is something that kind of like always surrounds you.

777
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:22,460
And again, if your workplace, if your job is you and your brand, then you've kind of picked a career where you're always on 24-7. I mean look at actors and actresses, right?

778
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:32,460
Who's that guy? Is it Ezra Miller that got filmed at like a Costco or something? Like some fan goes like, choke me daddy or something.

779
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:40,460
And like Ezra Miller like does it. Like full on like kind of like assault. And I'm sorry because I don't remember if it was provoked or not.

780
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:47,460
And I don't want to make it sound like it was provoked when it wasn't. I saw this thing once like two months ago. Maybe somebody in chat can fill me in.

781
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:55,460
But like literally chokes a fan. And I think I have to say it's allegedly Ezra Miller because I don't know if it was ever proven it really was him.

782
01:15:55,460 --> 01:16:10,460
But my point with all that is like because everybody's got you know the smartphones and cameras and so forth. He's a celebrity. You can't just go around choking people when you're off the clock. Does that make sense?

783
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:12,460
You can't just go around choking people anyway.

784
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:16,460
Exactly, exactly. Sorry, I'm on the clock. It's okay now.

785
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:25,460
Sorry, you're right. I worded that horribly. I'm very sorry. No, my job is being Darth Vader. I will force choke you now. No, I shouldn't make light of it. No, don't choke people ever. That's a good thing.

786
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:38,460
But you know the point I'm getting at though, right? Is that, you know, he has to represent his brand because his brand is his job and being able to land movie roles and things like that all of the time, right?

787
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:44,460
Yeah, so don't choke strangers. That's that's the thing. Let's see.

788
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:46,460
Bonds006 says, Darn, can't choke the fan.

789
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:53,460
Oh yeah, SD100Matt says, You're mostly right, Rob. The fan was stalking him in a bar and he snapped and he choked the fan.

790
01:16:53,460 --> 01:17:04,460
So there's a little bit of, you know, not that choking is ever appropriate, but this is definitely one of those cases of a wrong led to a bigger wrong and it led to a big whole wrong snowball.

791
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:12,460
So, you know, at the same time, you have to allow actors and actresses, you know, they're fucking people, give them their space, right?

792
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:19,460
That's why I hate doing that stuff. Like I've been told like, oh, look, there's so and so over there. We should go like talk to him.

793
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:27,460
And I'm like, no, let them like have your moment of hey, that's so and so and move on because you like let them live. It's so annoying.

794
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:36,460
Anyway. All right. Anything else you want to say on this important topic? I'm sorry, I might have derailed things a little bit, but I did want to get the chat comments out.

795
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:45,460
Fuck it. Just just be decent. Be nice. Yeah. Stop being an asshole.

796
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:49,460
Gaming is for everyone. Make it a space for everyone.

797
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:51,460
Gaming is for everyone. Exactly.

798
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:54,460
Yeah, Bobby. Teach your kids to be decent.

799
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:59,460
That too. Don't be creepy. All right. Moving on.

800
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:07,460
Let's go to a completely different topic and talk about Nintendo and a lot of a lot of confusion about where the hell Nintendo is at right now,

801
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:16,460
because Nintendo hasn't really done a direct to announce a barrage of new games outside of this random Bakugan announcement, which isn't even really their game anyway.

802
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:24,460
So what's Nintendo doing? What are they up to? Did this COVID situation screw them up? What's happening?

803
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:32,460
So there was a shareholder meeting and in talking to investors, senior managing executive officer at Nintendo,

804
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:40,460
Shinya Takahashi said that although the company as a whole is a little behind schedule due to the pandemic,

805
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:47,460
game releases this fiscal year through March 2021 are currently not affected.

806
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:52,460
So they're saying that games that are scheduled to come out this fiscal year are not affected.

807
01:18:52,460 --> 01:19:01,460
Now, here's my thing, though. I think there's a lot of word choice going on there because fiscal year goes through March 2021.

808
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:08,460
So if there was a game that was going to come out in November, that maybe doesn't make it out now until March 2021.

809
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:12,460
Well, they still made their fiscal year now, didn't they?

810
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:17,460
So I don't think this necessarily means that everything is on and they admit to being a little bit behind.

811
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:20,460
So I don't think this is necessarily saying that everything is on schedule.

812
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:31,460
Now, of course, the other thing that Nintendo has kind of taught us is that the holiday season might not be what it once was in this industry.

813
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:33,460
And what I mean by that is let's not forget.

814
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:40,460
Nintendo launched the switch outside of the holiday period within the fiscal year. They launched it in March.

815
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:48,460
So technically, Nintendo is kind of used to this where they can launch big products in January, February, March, and they'll still do very well.

816
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:54,460
If the game is good, it'll sell, right? So I wouldn't worry too much.

817
01:19:54,460 --> 01:20:01,460
Well, I think if you are we're expecting a whole bunch of releases in October, November, they may be delayed a few months.

818
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:06,460
But it sounds like we will still have some things coming by March of 2021 for sure.

819
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:09,460
What that is, though, we don't know how they're going to announce those games.

820
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:12,460
We don't know. Nothing has really been said on that front.

821
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:20,460
So Phoenix 7726 says, I can only imagine what Black Friday is going to be like.

822
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:26,460
I think everybody should prepare themselves for the possibility there may not be one like the way you were used to before.

823
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:34,460
I mean, we just we don't know what the virus situation is going to look like, but there's likely not going to be a vaccine by November or treatment.

824
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:38,460
So, I mean, we can cross our fingers and hope for a miracle in the treatment department.

825
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:44,460
But as things, you know, hopefully COVID starts to trail off.

826
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:48,460
You know, maybe by some miracle, we are able to reverse that.

827
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:53,460
We convince people to wear their masks and it's it starts to trail off a little more in this country.

828
01:20:53,460 --> 01:21:02,460
But I imagine those huge crowds of people fighting over toasters not going to happen this year because they're just going to limit how many people go in those stores.

829
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:04,460
But it's it is still too early to say.

830
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:09,460
I mean, if you think about it, from March till now has been four months.

831
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:15,460
And how much has changed in that four months? And guess what? From July to November, that's another four months.

832
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:20,460
So a lot can change. We'll see.

833
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:25,460
S2100 Matt says, Prime Day was supposed to be this past week. Amazon delayed it indefinitely.

834
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:29,460
Phoenix 7726 says, at least in the USA. Yeah, it's going to get canceled.

835
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:32,460
I don't trust our leaders enough to knock this down by then.

836
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:41,460
This is probably unfortunately true. However, don't get conceded if you're in another country.

837
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:45,460
There's still going to have to be protections that happen in other countries.

838
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:52,460
Like I know New Zealand's very proud of the fact that they don't really have coronavirus right now, or at least those that they do are like completely isolated.

839
01:21:52,460 --> 01:21:56,460
It's a very low number. They haven't had the outbreak in New Zealand nearly in the way that we've had here.

840
01:21:56,460 --> 01:22:01,460
Kudos to them. They've had very competent leadership in New Zealand in fighting this virus.

841
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:08,460
But they can't get lazy about it, right? If they suddenly relax a lot of things, what's going to happen?

842
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:12,460
It's going to invite the virus into this place that's been mostly unexposed, right?

843
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:27,460
So my point is, countries are going to have to continue to fight and protect against this until we have a vaccine, effective treatment, herd immunity, which seems, I mean, I know there's a lot of recent studies on that.

844
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:35,460
There's a lot of conflicting stuff right now on that. Let's just say the reports on vaccines seem more promising than the reports on herd immunity. That's all I'll say with that.

845
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:38,460
Well, and Sweden proved that point.

846
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:40,460
Oh yeah, there was that too.

847
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:46,460
And on top of that, the new studies are saying that it's possible to be reinfected and that the virus is airborne.

848
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:51,460
Joy. Yeah. So, anyhow.

849
01:22:51,460 --> 01:23:00,460
So anyway, one other thing I want to say about the Nintendo piece though, besides just like, you know, the games possibly being pushed out till March 2021 a little bit.

850
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:03,460
We have to think of the holiday season running through March.

851
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:13,460
They did mention that the working from home benefits have not necessarily been all negative because it was also revealed that recent surprise release of their jump rope challenge.

852
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:22,460
I don't know if you've seen that on the switch, but it was like a little freebie they put out jump rope challenge was like a game jam that Nintendo did in house.

853
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:29,460
Another comment from Takahashi said that the game was built with pandemic centric physical fitness in mind.

854
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:39,460
So they they basically did a game jam, it sounds like about what are some ways that the switch could encourage physical fitness while being at home and jump rope challenge was the result.

855
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:49,460
That's kind of rad actually so and I love this image of big game companies doing internal game jams to find the next little big product.

856
01:23:49,460 --> 01:24:02,460
And I'm sure Nintendo is not the only company to do it. And I just I think that's really neat. So I like that I think that's a good thing to come from this whole isolation thing not that there's really anything good about it but you, you look for the diamonds

857
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:09,460
in the rough I suppose. So, all right, well moving on dark soccer What do you have for us next.

858
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:12,460
You're muted dark soccer just you know on your, on your headset.

859
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:18,460
Thank you. You're welcome. Well going back to other Nintendo related news.

860
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:29,460
We have now had another unopened copy of Super Mario Brothers sell, not like a Mario Super Mario Brothers Duck Hunt or any of that it's a Super Mario Brothers.

861
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:34,460
And this one sold for 114,000.

862
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:43,460
It was one of the 1985 releases. It was put up by heritage auctions that based out of Dallas.

863
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:49,460
It is the most money ever paid for a video game according to heritage.

864
01:24:49,460 --> 01:25:06,460
It is a particularly rare copy of Super Mario Brothers because the, it means that the box was sealed with a cardboard hanging tab underneath the plastic which is an indicator that this was produced after Nintendo started using shrink shrink wrap to seal their

865
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:08,460
games rather than stickers.

866
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:18,460
And so it's an excellent condition. It's the highest graded copy of the game that heritage is ever sold.

867
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:36,460
The whole auction that they did brought in about 700,000, according to a heritage. They also sold a prototype of a Sega Pluto to console, which sold for 84,000, as far as I know, I think there's only two in existence.

868
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:51,460
So, this particular one, the the Pluto zero to the thing about this one is it was supposed to be a Sega Saturn, that was more of a budget model that had the built in

869
01:25:51,460 --> 01:26:02,460
internet connectors on it. And so the thing with that is it had it been released it would have been the first home console that that was internet capable.

870
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:10,460
And then one of their other big sellers was a copy of Mike Tyson's punch out for 50,400, and it was one of the first.

871
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:19,460
And one of the first sealed copies of Super Mario Brothers three that was 38,400. And there are apparently less than 10 copies of that in existence.

872
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:21,460
Wow.

873
01:26:21,460 --> 01:26:33,460
There's something if I had, if I had that money, I could I could pay off my house, well there's, there's certain elements of these that are making them collectibles and like you said with the Super Mario.

874
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:42,460
It's the fact that it had the pull tab and it was sealed that way as opposed to shrink wrap, because I think that also indicated I think, and somebody in chat might have to help me fill in the gaps.

875
01:26:42,460 --> 01:27:00,460
But I want to say that pull tab was very unique to like the first pressing of the game. And I think some type of arrangement with Sears, that they were sold exclusively in their store like in the first pressing and I think the box itself has like a black bar in a different place or something like that

876
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:22,460
But there's, there were very few of those made because the pull tab was more of a test market thing. Whereas when it went like full, because you might be sitting there at home and you have a copy of just Super Mario Brothers, because I mean, as rare as it is to find a Super Mario Brothers by itself cartridge because most people remember that packed in with Duck Hunt, right, or even the Duck Hunt world class track meet, right.

877
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:29,460
But there were some Mario Brothers by itself because if you, you might recall, there was also a Rob the Robot set.

878
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:43,460
And Mario, Mario Brothers wasn't packed in with that. It was Gyrumite. Once it was Gyrumite, maybe it was Breakthrough. It was one of those Rob the Robot games and I think Duck Hunt.

879
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:44,460
No, Wrecking Crew.

880
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:45,460
Wrecking Crew.

881
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:58,460
Okay, so it was a difference. So you still had to buy Mario Brothers separately. So I mean, that card existed, but I think in the earliest, earliest version, like the test market stuff had the pull tab and that's what makes it so rare.

882
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:03,460
So, and there's got to be things like Mike Tyson's Punch Out. Shit, I had that game.

883
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:10,460
But there's got to be something about like a particular first pressing or a mistake or something. I mean, the fact that still shrink wraps pretty good.

884
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:17,460
But you can, you can go back and re-shrink wrap games. There's got to be something about that packaging that's different.

885
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:25,460
Oh, Hype Mayhem is actually saying, I got the NES that came with Gyrumite and Duck Hunt and we got Super Mario Brothers separately.

886
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:34,460
And Dark Tetsuya says, I have the Super Mario Brothers Duck Hunt track meet three and one. Yeah, a little later on, then the power pad Nintendo.

887
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:50,460
So there was like, there was the NES robot set and the action set and the action set was one with the Zapper and that sold way more than the robot set because the robot set was more expensive and Nintendo never really convinced people why the robot was a thing you needed.

888
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:51,460
It was a gimmick.

889
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:52,460
It was, yeah, it was very gimmicky.

890
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:58,460
So then I have to ask everyone, what color was the gun on your Nintendo?

891
01:28:58,460 --> 01:28:59,460
Silver.

892
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:00,460
It was gray.

893
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:10,460
Silver, yeah. So yes, they did. They changed the color of the gun. What, by about 87, they changed the color of the gun to that neon orange because realism.

894
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:18,460
And also, and I was also going to make the joke that the action set with the gun sold better than the robot set because this is America and we love guns.

895
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:19,460
So the action set.

896
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:21,460
But you know what never changed color?

897
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:22,460
Huh?

898
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:25,460
The zillion gun that came with the Sega Master System.

899
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,460
Oh yeah.

900
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:30,460
Wasn't the Rob the Robot set way more expensive too?

901
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:36,460
It was. It was way more expensive and they really could, and then people didn't, people didn't want Gyromite and Duck Hunt.

902
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:39,460
People wanted Mario Brothers that are Super Mario Brothers, of course.

903
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:40,460
That was the game.

904
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:47,460
I remember I always, I would always see like it was at our local like video rental store and I think they sold games too because I bought games from them.

905
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:53,460
But they always had like behind the like display case, the Rob the Robot thing. I was like, oh man, I don't want that.

906
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:57,460
But then like, of course, you know, it's like a couple hundred bucks with just that.

907
01:29:57,460 --> 01:30:01,460
One of my friends in high school had Rob the Robot because he was a spoiled brat.

908
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:05,460
So he had that and I remember playing it at his house.

909
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:09,460
So there was, you know, I did, I get to get to check that out at one point.

910
01:30:09,460 --> 01:30:11,460
So, all right.

911
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:15,460
I just, I'm just telling it like it is, y'all. All right.

912
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:19,460
Anyway, need to know that the old video is, oh, anyway, sorry.

913
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:25,460
I meant to say, so the action set got replaced at some point with the power pad set, right?

914
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:26,460
That was everything.

915
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:29,460
And then I think after the power pad set came that new Nintendo.

916
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:31,460
So they didn't even really sell sets anymore at that point.

917
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:34,460
So a lot of people had that power pad set as well.

918
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:44,460
But ironically, the other super expensive NES game is if you can find that track meet game, world class track meet.

919
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:48,460
I mean, if you can find that when it was called stadium events, because what happened,

920
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:53,460
Nintendo got that power pad by acquiring it from another company and they acquired stadium events

921
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:55,460
and then repackaged it as world class track meet.

922
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:59,460
But if you can find an original stadium events, that shit is very expensive.

923
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:04,460
So it's kind of neat. Interesting.

924
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:09,460
All right. Stadium events. Yeah, that's what I thought there in a chat.

925
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:15,460
Act F says, I still remember that news story about some dudes in Brazil robbing a bank or something with Master System guns.

926
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:19,460
And Bobby Black Wolf does point out with all the counterfeits, it's really hard.

927
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:30,460
That's a good point. It's easy relatively through minorly sophisticated technology to just take an old cart no one wants,

928
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:38,460
like gyro mite, sorry, gyro mite fans, and replace the ROM, flash an image instead of stadium, excuse me,

929
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:42,460
stadium events on the ROM, put a new sticker on it.

930
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:45,460
Tada. You have a counterfeit copy of stadium events.

931
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:50,460
And that's unfortunately something that you can do. So it's tricky, tricky.

932
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:53,460
All right. Anyway, let's move on. We got some more news to get into.

933
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:57,460
We could talk about video game collecting for a long time, but we have news about a video game collectible.

934
01:31:57,460 --> 01:32:06,460
Right, Logie? Yes. And so this this really hits home for me because I own a full size cabinet of one of these.

935
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:16,460
It's a Sega Astro City, and it's basically a bunch of it's a mini one of those like mini devices.

936
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:24,460
And I mean, it looks pretty beefy. It's reminds me a lot of like the Neo Geo collectors mini that they did,

937
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:26,460
but about that same size.

938
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:33,460
It's got thirty six games and it's going to retail for about one hundred nineteen dollars or twelve thousand eight hundred yen.

939
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:38,460
And some of the games that they've revealed are at least the first ten.

940
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:44,460
Virtua Fighter, Fantasy Zone, Golden Axe, Golden Axe, The Revenge of Death Adder, Alien Storm,

941
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:51,460
Alien Syndrome, Columns II, Dark Edge, Puzzle in Action, Tant R, and Altered Beasts.

942
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:55,460
You know, I want it. And it's pretty cool.

943
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:59,460
So aside from it having like a screen in there and everything,

944
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:08,460
they also have it looks like a almost like a Genesis controller version that you can get as well.

945
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:15,460
Almost looks like an old Mark three controller, but with the extra buttons.

946
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:22,460
Yeah, I mean, the controller that they have on there, I mean, definitely resembles the Astro City.

947
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:28,460
But the little like controller, I guess, plugs in its USB is only twenty six bucks.

948
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:36,460
Yeah, it's pretty nice. I just wish my screen worked on mine because when I moved it to the garage, it stopped displaying pictures.

949
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:41,460
And actually now I was looking at some parts and stuff. I'm like, I just remembered that.

950
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:47,460
I wonder if I disconnected something on the power supply. So I have I have to go look at that later tonight.

951
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:53,460
But it's not 100 degrees out in the garage. Do you think it's the heat that screwed up that system?

952
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:57,460
No, no, no, no, no. This was in the winter when I moved everything.

953
01:33:57,460 --> 01:34:01,460
So I had an issue with I don't know what it is.

954
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:06,460
I think it could have been because like it's a really I mean, it's got a CRT in it.

955
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:09,460
That's like a 29 inch CRT. And I think it's heavy.

956
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:17,460
So I think it's possible that when I moved it in there, maybe the jostling it around could have caused some problems or because it's old.

957
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:24,460
I mean, it's probably a few decades old. So I mean, I don't know.

958
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:31,460
It's stuff like that just eventually dies. And you might feel like, yeah, redo the capacitors on there or I may just need to replace them.

959
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:35,460
I knew that someone take a look at it. But I mean, I had restored everything.

960
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:43,460
I gutted the PC out of it, though, because I had Mame running it. But now I needed it for parts for my DDR machine.

961
01:34:43,460 --> 01:34:46,460
So I'll have to rebuild it and it'll be even better.

962
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:50,460
Now, I didn't really talk about it during my gaming week, but I still love my BurgerTime one up cabinet.

963
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:55,460
Although I promised I promised my husband I'm not going to get any more one up cabinets.

964
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:59,460
You sure? Because I saw that. So I was looking online.

965
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:03,460
I noticed that they had marked the bunch down in April to 50 bucks.

966
01:35:03,460 --> 01:35:09,460
And apparently there's a few of the Star Wars ones left over in Roseville for 50 bucks.

967
01:35:09,460 --> 01:35:14,460
Thank you, Alan. Put a smush cameo on. Sorry. Wow.

968
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:19,460
It's a space thing. We need less. They also had a final fight in West.

969
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:25,460
We need less in this house, not more. Here's 50 bucks, by the way.

970
01:35:25,460 --> 01:35:28,460
Wow. You might want to get on that. Where am I going to put that with all the pinball in my house?

971
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:34,460
You'll find a place. You don't need a bed.

972
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:39,460
But I did. I did say, though, like I promised Alan no more one up cabinets.

973
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:44,460
However, if they announce a Tron cabinet.

974
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:50,460
I'll risk divorce. I'm just kidding. That wouldn't happen, but I.

975
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:57,460
Alan would have to understand and give me that one if if if they do a Tron arcade one up cabinet at some point.

976
01:35:57,460 --> 01:36:04,460
And now that apparently Tron three like those, I'll believe it when I see a trailer or that they're actually like there's on set photos or something.

977
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:09,460
You know, like I thought it was supposed to be a remake, though, like I don't.

978
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:17,460
I don't know the whole thing with Jared Leto was supposed to be a remake. And I'll be very disappointed if it is because they left it open like it was like it was a really interesting storyline.

979
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:22,460
And I was like, never reboot it. Why? I'll believe it when I see footage.

980
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:30,460
But until then, my hope is if they were to do a new Tron movie, they would want to like maybe release a cabinet to go with that.

981
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:36,460
Although, I don't know, maybe Disney want to do their own thing, but I would love to get electronica back, Rob.

982
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:45,460
I'd be so well, now that I'm going to have all this time off work saved up, that that trip to Disney World is happening when it's safe.

983
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:55,460
I'm not going to be there tomorrow, but when the Tron ride opens and, you know, hopefully our world gets past covid, I will be on that ride.

984
01:36:55,460 --> 01:36:57,460
I'm so excited.

985
01:36:57,460 --> 01:37:02,460
Pretty sure Bobby Black Wolf has already said he's driving down for that, too, or I just committed him. I don't know.

986
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:03,460
All right.

987
01:37:03,460 --> 01:37:07,460
Are they bringing the Tron ride to Disney World?

988
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:11,460
Oh, yeah, the one in Shanghai. They've been building that in Disney World for about a year.

989
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:16,460
It's supposed to open next year, although I don't know how the timetable gets thrown off.

990
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:18,460
So it looks very cool.

991
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:20,460
Yeah, for real.

992
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:22,460
All right. Anyhow, moving on.

993
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:24,460
Let's talk about Microsoft.

994
01:37:24,460 --> 01:37:31,460
And we know that Xbox and Xbox Game Studios has been growing and growing thanks to acquisitions.

995
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:37,460
In fact, they were rumored recently as a possible suitor for Warner Interactive, if I'm not mistaken.

996
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:39,460
Right. That was the thing that was going around.

997
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:43,460
So is Microsoft going to stop the acquisition of Game Studios?

998
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:46,460
And the short answer is no.

999
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:53,460
And this is in an interview with GamesIndustry.biz that Phil Spencer, of course, the head of Xbox, did, saying,

1000
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:59,460
We acquired quite a few new studios in a short amount of time, and we want to make sure that those studios are onboarded in the right way.

1001
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:08,460
As the head, Matt, and I were talking about it, we just want to make sure that we treated the incoming studios as full parts of the organization they felt supported.

1002
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:10,460
And so on and so on.

1003
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:18,460
Goes on to say that the CEO of Microsoft, who is not Bill Gates, Bill Gates actually is very removed from that company at this point.

1004
01:38:18,460 --> 01:38:24,460
But Sataya Nadella, and I probably said his name wrong, I'm sorry, but he's the CEO of Microsoft,

1005
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:31,460
has not really given the sign that they should slow down acquisitions of studios.

1006
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:34,460
So they're just going to continue to onboard studios.

1007
01:38:34,460 --> 01:38:40,460
And Phil Spencer says that the Game Pass subscriber base portfolio continues to grow.

1008
01:38:40,460 --> 01:38:42,460
We're launching a new console.

1009
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:46,460
It was our biggest year ever on PC in terms of revenue.

1010
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:53,460
We have really strong support from the CEO and the chief financial officer, Amy Hood.

1011
01:38:53,460 --> 01:39:00,460
And there's been no signal at all that we should be slowing down, but just to go at a pace that is maintainable for us as a leadership team.

1012
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:05,460
We're always out there talking to people, but it has to be the right opportunity.

1013
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:13,460
And this article I'm looking at as well reminds us that they were rumored, as I just mentioned, with the whole Warner Interactive thing going on.

1014
01:39:13,460 --> 01:39:16,460
So there may be more in the future.

1015
01:39:16,460 --> 01:39:17,460
So we'll see.

1016
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:24,460
And of course, it's really only a couple of weeks now until we really get to see the fruits of what that's going to bring us.

1017
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:29,460
Yes, we know a few of the Xbox games from that trailer peak a couple weeks ago.

1018
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:38,460
But we know we're going to be getting a real meaty look at what 2020 is going to look like for Microsoft in just a couple weeks on the 23rd, right?

1019
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:41,460
Yeah, very shortly.

1020
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:44,460
I'm very excited to see what they have for there.

1021
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:52,460
Hopefully, the demos that they're going to be bringing are going to have PC versions as well because I don't got no Xbox.

1022
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:55,460
And for all we know, they may announce new acquisitions at that time.

1023
01:39:55,460 --> 01:39:58,460
They don't necessarily have to announce it right when it happens.

1024
01:39:58,460 --> 01:40:03,460
Look at what happened at that one E3 where they remember they had them all out on the stage.

1025
01:40:03,460 --> 01:40:04,460
That was a really impressive E3.

1026
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:07,460
And they're like, we got this one and this one and this one and this one.

1027
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:08,460
It's like, damn.

1028
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:11,460
So it could be anyone.

1029
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:17,460
And I see in chat, DGRama S says Microsoft needs to acquire a few Japanese studios. Seriously.

1030
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:19,460
That would be a gag.

1031
01:40:19,460 --> 01:40:23,460
If Microsoft acquires a Japanese studio, that is going to be huge.

1032
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:28,460
And I know a lot of people have their fan wank as to which studio they want to see acquired.

1033
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:33,460
But I think just if they were to get at all a Japanese studio, that would be a pretty big deal.

1034
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:41,460
So we'll see. Hype Mayhem in chat says next up, Microsoft buys Sony, Nintendo, Disney, Activision, EA, the White House.

1035
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:43,460
I don't really see it going that far.

1036
01:40:43,460 --> 01:40:52,460
But I think because we have other big gaming companies out there like EA is buying a bunch of little things.

1037
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:55,460
Activision Blizzard buys a bunch of little things.

1038
01:40:55,460 --> 01:41:02,460
I don't think MS is going to get accused of antitrust violations by picking up a couple other studios.

1039
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:05,460
It's all about kind of how they handle it, I suppose.

1040
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:14,460
But they have, I think, a huge way they've also been kind of avoiding that talk is that they're putting Minecraft out on the Switch and PlayStation.

1041
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:18,460
So that is one way I think Microsoft kind of gets around that hole.

1042
01:41:18,460 --> 01:41:23,460
They're not allowing competition because they're actually putting games on competitors consoles.

1043
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:26,460
So true. Yeah.

1044
01:41:26,460 --> 01:41:31,460
All right. We'll see what develops. It's going to be it's going to be very fascinating when we get to July.

1045
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:35,460
Anyway, let's let's go back to a classic time, shall we?

1046
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:40,460
We're going to go back, take a step in time to the classic game of the week.

1047
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:47,460
Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking this game out.

1048
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:53,460
And you should acquire some knowledge about this particular game.

1049
01:41:53,460 --> 01:41:57,460
Dark Sakura, what have you picked for the folks for the classic game of the week?

1050
01:41:57,460 --> 01:41:59,460
I'm on week number six, by the way.

1051
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:03,460
I know. But now we can't see because I brought the bump back with our makeover.

1052
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:06,460
We have the bumper again. All right. I'll leave it on. Yeah.

1053
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:13,460
Anyway, the game that I've chosen is Breath of Fire, which is another one I haven't done before.

1054
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:19,460
But hey, and just a little hiccup on the stream here because I forgot to load the B roll.

1055
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:23,460
Sorry. So it's it's blank on purpose for a reason. But here we go.

1056
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:25,460
I got it. I got it. There we go. There's your. All right.

1057
01:42:25,460 --> 01:42:34,460
So so again, it's Breath of Fire, which is a role playing game developed by Capcom for the Super Famicom or Super Nintendo.

1058
01:42:34,460 --> 01:42:38,460
And it was released in Japan, April nineteen ninety three.

1059
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:43,460
It could have been out for my birthday, but it came out on April 3rd.

1060
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:49,460
And then in the US, it was released on August 10th, 1994.

1061
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:57,460
So over a year later and there's been other versions of it released, but I'll get into them in a moment.

1062
01:42:57,460 --> 01:43:01,460
So it is Capcom's first traditional role playing game.

1063
01:43:01,460 --> 01:43:07,460
And it set the tone for future games because we have quite a few Breath of Fire games now.

1064
01:43:07,460 --> 01:43:18,460
The character designs were done by Inafune Keiji and music was done by Capcom's in-house sound team, Alf Lila.

1065
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:26,460
There was a re-release, like I said, in 2001, it was released for the Game Boy Advanced with new save features and graphical enhancements.

1066
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:30,460
And the English version finally being released in Europe for the first time.

1067
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:35,460
And then it was released on the Nintendo 3DS virtual console.

1068
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:38,460
And now in 2019, we have a Switch version.

1069
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:46,460
So it is a fantasy story set in sort of a medieval time with a boy named Ryu.

1070
01:43:46,460 --> 01:43:50,460
Ryu can transform into a dragon.

1071
01:43:50,460 --> 01:43:53,460
He's one of the last members of this race that can transform into a dragon.

1072
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:58,460
And he's off looking for his sister, I guess, who is the other member of their race that can turn into a dragon.

1073
01:43:58,460 --> 01:44:00,460
So he's not the only one.

1074
01:44:01,460 --> 01:44:06,460
So on his quest, he finds other people who will work with him.

1075
01:44:06,460 --> 01:44:12,460
And then he comes into conflict with the dark dragon clan, oh my god,

1076
01:44:12,460 --> 01:44:19,460
which is an empire that wants to take over the world by bringing back a crazy goddess.

1077
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:22,460
And it was really well received.

1078
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:25,460
And of course, it had a sequel, Breath of Fire 2, in 1994.

1079
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:36,460
As far as the play of the game, it's basically two-dimensional sprites with a top-down perspective.

1080
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:41,460
And you move your character in four directions while navigating through the environments.

1081
01:44:41,460 --> 01:44:44,460
You go from towns, dungeons, there's traps, there's monsters.

1082
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:51,460
And you have to do these story-based scenarios that will have you go into these areas and defeat enemies.

1083
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:56,460
And also interact with NPCs who are part of the plot.

1084
01:44:56,460 --> 01:45:04,460
And so you keep bringing in different characters that have different spells as well as unique actions that they can perform.

1085
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:08,460
You can solve puzzles, you navigate some of the environments,

1086
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:15,460
but some of these people are going to bring better access to the game.

1087
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:19,460
And so you can have up to four members in your party at a time.

1088
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:26,460
And then, of course, you have your icon menus that you can let you use your stock and character information

1089
01:45:26,460 --> 01:45:32,460
and shortcuts that let you assign unused buttons so you can access things.

1090
01:45:32,460 --> 01:45:38,460
Kind of like when I used to do all my macros on a controller for Final Fantasy XI.

1091
01:45:39,460 --> 01:45:45,460
And so the random encounters are every few steps.

1092
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:47,460
It's a turn-based system in combat.

1093
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:54,460
So basically you input the commands for each character and then they are carried out in order of their agility rating.

1094
01:45:54,460 --> 01:46:02,460
And so basically you just go through the game and beat the bad guy, save the world.

1095
01:46:02,460 --> 01:46:06,460
And I'm not going to go too much more into the story about it.

1096
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:10,460
But it was developed by Capcom for the SNES.

1097
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:13,460
The designer was Kawano Yoshinori.

1098
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:21,460
And the producer was Fujiwara Tokuro, who had also been the creator of the Ghost and Goblin series.

1099
01:46:21,460 --> 01:46:29,460
So we, of course, also, like I said, Inahune did the game's characters.

1100
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:37,460
And, I mean, it was a pretty nice group of folks that worked on it.

1101
01:46:37,460 --> 01:46:40,460
And then when it was localized to North America,

1102
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:46,460
Capcom USA didn't really have a lot of experience with text-heavy role-play games.

1103
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:56,460
And so it was actually Squaresoft, I think, that had gone...

1104
01:46:56,460 --> 01:47:00,460
Yeah, Squaresoft did the US release on it.

1105
01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:06,460
And so it was marketed as from the company that brought you Final Fantasy.

1106
01:47:06,460 --> 01:47:10,460
So not quite great there.

1107
01:47:10,460 --> 01:47:14,460
But Capcom took the reins back in 2001 for the Game Boy Advance port,

1108
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:19,460
and had this intuitive play system and redrawn character portraits,

1109
01:47:19,460 --> 01:47:24,460
and the menu that works more like Breath of Fire 2, updated cutscene graphics.

1110
01:47:24,460 --> 01:47:29,460
And then you could do temporary saves with a quick save feature.

1111
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:38,460
And Capcom had announced their English version right before E3 2001.

1112
01:47:39,460 --> 01:47:42,460
So yeah, the game was very well received.

1113
01:47:42,460 --> 01:47:48,460
You know, on average, it was... I'd probably say in the 80 percentile, you know.

1114
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:53,460
It was modestly successful in the US, but very successful in Japan.

1115
01:47:53,460 --> 01:47:57,460
Of course, the Super Nintendo version suffered from...

1116
01:47:57,460 --> 01:48:00,460
And this is actually a quote from Play Magazine,

1117
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:02,460
Flawed Execution.

1118
01:48:02,460 --> 01:48:05,460
And so, you know, take it as you will.

1119
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:07,460
Take it as you will. A lot of people like Breath of Fire.

1120
01:48:07,460 --> 01:48:10,460
I hate the US artwork for it, because it's just that general,

1121
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:13,460
Let's make them look western. Yeah.

1122
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:17,460
So, whatever. Good game.

1123
01:48:17,460 --> 01:48:18,460
Play it.

1124
01:48:18,460 --> 01:48:20,460
So, can I confess something?

1125
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:21,460
Do it.

1126
01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:23,460
I've never played it.

1127
01:48:23,460 --> 01:48:25,460
You want me to confess something else too?

1128
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:26,460
What?

1129
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:27,460
Neither have I.

1130
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:29,460
Really? You picked it as your classic game?

1131
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:32,460
I did, because it deserves to be a classic game.

1132
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:34,460
I know a lot of people who love it.

1133
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:36,460
Dan is a fan of it.

1134
01:48:36,460 --> 01:48:39,460
Our chat room is really lighting up too.

1135
01:48:39,460 --> 01:48:41,460
So, they approve. Yeah.

1136
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:46,460
And so, you know, for that, just because I haven't personally played something,

1137
01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:50,460
it doesn't mean that it's not a good game.

1138
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:52,460
You know, it's not worthy of being mentioned.

1139
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:56,460
You know, some of the games I've done... Halo. Halo.

1140
01:48:56,460 --> 01:48:58,460
Rob.

1141
01:48:58,460 --> 01:48:59,460
I had to.

1142
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:01,460
You left me no choice.

1143
01:49:01,460 --> 01:49:03,460
I left myself out for that one.

1144
01:49:03,460 --> 01:49:05,460
Okay?

1145
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:10,460
Thanks to doing Halo, my mother could live in her house for another month.

1146
01:49:10,460 --> 01:49:12,460
I know. I know. We're very thankful to everybody.

1147
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:13,460
Thank you, everybody.

1148
01:49:13,460 --> 01:49:17,460
I'm going back to the cameras by turning off the gameplay footage.

1149
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:19,460
So, this is my DragonCon wig.

1150
01:49:19,460 --> 01:49:21,460
It needs some love.

1151
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:24,460
She hasn't been worn in like a year, because...

1152
01:49:24,460 --> 01:49:26,460
But I love this wig.

1153
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:28,460
It looks like... I think the color looks great on me.

1154
01:49:28,460 --> 01:49:31,460
And yes, and I am aware, actually, of what Bobby's saying in chat,

1155
01:49:31,460 --> 01:49:33,460
is that it's on Super Nintendo Online on Switch.

1156
01:49:33,460 --> 01:49:35,460
Yeah, at least I knew the first one was there.

1157
01:49:35,460 --> 01:49:37,460
I didn't realize both one and two were there.

1158
01:49:37,460 --> 01:49:41,460
So, yeah, maybe I will have to do like a playthrough at some point.

1159
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:43,460
Maybe, Darsakha, you might have to join me.

1160
01:49:43,460 --> 01:49:47,460
Maybe we could do a virtual, like, playthrough together.

1161
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:49,460
The thing is, is that I think that...

1162
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:52,460
I don't remember if the first ones were, but I know later ones are RTS,

1163
01:49:52,460 --> 01:49:54,460
and I hate RTS games.

1164
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:58,460
Oh, no, this one definitely doesn't look like it,

1165
01:49:58,460 --> 01:50:01,460
just from the gameplay footage that was rolling in the background, so, yeah.

1166
01:50:01,460 --> 01:50:06,460
But, I mean, maybe, but, I mean, right now, I'm still...

1167
01:50:06,460 --> 01:50:09,460
Yeah, they're both... Okay, they're turn-based good.

1168
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:13,460
It's just the later ones are RTS, and I hate RTS games.

1169
01:50:13,460 --> 01:50:16,460
I am Dale in chat. I hope I said that name right.

1170
01:50:16,460 --> 01:50:19,460
I'm sorry, it's in a dark blue that's really hard to read. Sorry.

1171
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:22,460
I'm not going to spoil it, but for a classic game, the story was great.

1172
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:24,460
Play both games. It's great. Oh, yeah.

1173
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:27,460
And, you know, just as DarkSakura said, and I totally agree with,

1174
01:50:27,460 --> 01:50:29,460
just because we don't get around to playing certain games

1175
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:31,460
doesn't mean they're not good.

1176
01:50:31,460 --> 01:50:33,460
Sports games are a great example.

1177
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:36,460
Like, I think between the three of us, including Loki,

1178
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:38,460
there's very few sports games that we play.

1179
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:41,460
Not to say we don't play any sports games.

1180
01:50:41,460 --> 01:50:43,460
I fucking love Tecmo Bowl back in the day,

1181
01:50:43,460 --> 01:50:45,460
and I still like NBA Jam is a lot of fun.

1182
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:47,460
You know, I like the arcade...

1183
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:49,460
Hey, you know what mine was? Super high impact.

1184
01:50:49,460 --> 01:50:51,460
Yeah, super high impact, right?

1185
01:50:51,460 --> 01:50:56,460
But when it comes to Madden 2019, not so much.

1186
01:50:56,460 --> 01:50:59,460
We don't really play those games. They're not bad games.

1187
01:50:59,460 --> 01:51:01,460
They're just not the games we play, and that's okay.

1188
01:51:01,460 --> 01:51:03,460
It's like music, right?

1189
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:06,460
I don't know shit about country western music.

1190
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:08,460
Well, unless it's Reba McEntire.

1191
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:12,460
But, you know, that doesn't mean it's necessarily all bad.

1192
01:51:12,460 --> 01:51:17,460
Oh, my exes live in Texas.

1193
01:51:17,460 --> 01:51:19,460
I mean, there is a lot of bad country.

1194
01:51:19,460 --> 01:51:21,460
You know what? There's a lot of bad pop music, too.

1195
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:25,460
And I like pop music, and there's a lot of bad pop music, so it's fine.

1196
01:51:25,460 --> 01:51:29,460
I grew up spending my summers in Dothan, Alabama.

1197
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:37,460
I listen to a lot of country, but it's what introduced me to the original version of Black Velvet,

1198
01:51:37,460 --> 01:51:39,460
which I love to this day.

1199
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:43,460
Nice. Alright. Anyway, your classic game of the week, Breath of Fire.

1200
01:51:43,460 --> 01:51:45,460
Yay!

1201
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:48,460
How we got from Breath of Fire to country music, only OLR knows.

1202
01:51:48,460 --> 01:51:51,460
Alright, we're going to do some rapid fire news.

1203
01:51:51,460 --> 01:51:55,460
And nice thing, usually we'd be saying goodbye to Jamie about now,

1204
01:51:55,460 --> 01:51:59,460
but Jamie's actually going to be with us all night long, changing out weeks.

1205
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:01,460
I did a thing. I did a thing.

1206
01:52:01,460 --> 01:52:07,460
I got tomorrow off because I have a doctor's appointment that actually may have been canceled, so I don't know.

1207
01:52:07,460 --> 01:52:09,460
So, yeah.

1208
01:52:09,460 --> 01:52:13,460
And I'm still, I'm going to keep this wig on for a while. I love this one.

1209
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:14,460
Yeah, that's a good wig.

1210
01:52:14,460 --> 01:52:16,460
She's good. She's good.

1211
01:52:16,460 --> 01:52:22,460
I wish, I wish, I hope somebody's been taking screenshots throughout the show so we can have a Twitter poll later to rate Jamie's wigs.

1212
01:52:22,460 --> 01:52:24,460
Alright, anyway.

1213
01:52:24,460 --> 01:52:26,460
Maybe I'll put some selfies up there.

1214
01:52:26,460 --> 01:52:28,460
That's a good idea. Alright, moving on.

1215
01:52:28,460 --> 01:52:33,460
We have some rapid fire news, so let's talk about some other news that's happening in the industry.

1216
01:52:33,460 --> 01:52:35,460
Quickly-ish.

1217
01:52:35,460 --> 01:52:41,460
I say quickly, but it's OLR. Sometimes the segment goes on longer than the other news stories. It's whatever.

1218
01:52:41,460 --> 01:52:43,460
Loki, why don't you start us off?

1219
01:52:43,460 --> 01:52:48,460
Alright, so we've got a few new games coming to the Nintendo Switch Online Collection.

1220
01:52:48,460 --> 01:52:55,460
So, for Super Nintendo, we're going to be getting Donkey Kong Country and Natsume Championship Wrestling.

1221
01:52:55,460 --> 01:52:59,460
And then, on the NES, we're getting The Immortal.

1222
01:52:59,460 --> 01:53:02,460
I have not played The Immortal.

1223
01:53:02,460 --> 01:53:03,460
The other two I've played, though.

1224
01:53:03,460 --> 01:53:07,460
Isn't that based on a movie or a comic, The Immortal? I feel like it is.

1225
01:53:07,460 --> 01:53:12,460
Uh, it looks like it could be.

1226
01:53:12,460 --> 01:53:15,460
It's Will Harvey Presents The Immortal.

1227
01:53:15,460 --> 01:53:17,460
I don't know.

1228
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:21,460
I've seen a little bit of that game before.

1229
01:53:21,460 --> 01:53:26,460
I don't think I ever really played a lot of it, but I'll check it out on Switch Online. Of course I will. Why not?

1230
01:53:26,460 --> 01:53:28,460
Yep.

1231
01:53:28,460 --> 01:53:35,460
And then, we've got Halo 3 coming to PC on the 14th.

1232
01:53:35,460 --> 01:53:40,460
So, it's going to be a part of the Master Chief Collection.

1233
01:53:40,460 --> 01:53:42,460
So, pretty neat.

1234
01:53:42,460 --> 01:53:46,460
I like how they've been adding to that collection piece by piece on PC.

1235
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:49,460
It's been very interesting because I've played it there.

1236
01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:51,460
So, it's interesting.

1237
01:53:51,460 --> 01:53:54,460
Yeah. So, pretty cool.

1238
01:53:54,460 --> 01:54:02,460
Alright. Limited Run Games is going to be doing a physical edition of the Castlevania Anniversary Collection.

1239
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:07,460
Now, many of you probably already own this collection because it's been out digitally for a little bit.

1240
01:54:07,460 --> 01:54:10,460
But, you know, for the collectors, that's what Limited Run Games is for.

1241
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:21,460
And they announced on their own little streaming event they did earlier this week is that they are going to be putting out this collection of Konami Castlevania games for the Nintendo Switch and the PlayStation 4.

1242
01:54:21,460 --> 01:54:28,460
Castlevania Collection was originally released in May 2019, but this is going to be a limited physical edition, which is neat.

1243
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:33,460
You know, I mean, probably not for me, but I love that it's a thing that they do.

1244
01:54:33,460 --> 01:54:40,460
Speaking of Limited Run Games, they announced, what, like 30 different physical editions that they're doing.

1245
01:54:40,460 --> 01:54:42,460
So, it's not just this.

1246
01:54:42,460 --> 01:54:45,460
They're going to be doing Samurai Jack from Adult Swim Games.

1247
01:54:45,460 --> 01:54:47,460
They're going to be doing Towerfall Ascension.

1248
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:49,460
To the Moon, that's a big one.

1249
01:54:49,460 --> 01:54:54,460
Space Channel 5 VR is getting a Limited Run Games edition, the PSVR game.

1250
01:54:54,460 --> 01:54:57,460
The Grandia HD Collection for Switch.

1251
01:54:57,460 --> 01:54:59,460
Bloodstained Curse of the Moon 2.

1252
01:54:59,460 --> 01:55:05,460
So, I mean, I know Dark Sakura, you and Dan are trying to do less stuff, but it's just a video game.

1253
01:55:07,460 --> 01:55:09,460
Yeah, but we already have the game. We already bought it.

1254
01:55:09,460 --> 01:55:10,460
True, true.

1255
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:16,460
I think the most fascinating one on the entire list, Papers, Please.

1256
01:55:16,460 --> 01:55:20,460
But the reason why it's fascinating, it's a Vita physical release.

1257
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:22,460
Yes, they're putting out Papers, Please.

1258
01:55:22,460 --> 01:55:24,460
I think that's fucking rad.

1259
01:55:24,460 --> 01:55:27,460
Garu Mark of the Wolves, the PlayStation 4 ported that.

1260
01:55:27,460 --> 01:55:28,460
Oh, yeah.

1261
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:29,460
Pretty cool, right?

1262
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:31,460
Super Meat Boy Forever.

1263
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:34,460
A Boy and His Blob, the PlayStation 4 redo.

1264
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:37,460
Shantae, Shantae's Risky Revenge, and Extreme Sports.

1265
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:40,460
So, there's a lot of stuff that Limited Run Games is doing.

1266
01:55:40,460 --> 01:55:43,460
That must mean that their physical editions do very well.

1267
01:55:43,460 --> 01:55:45,460
Well, not necessarily.

1268
01:55:45,460 --> 01:55:47,460
Very is a relative term, right?

1269
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:50,460
Well enough for them to keep going with more.

1270
01:55:50,460 --> 01:55:52,460
So, neat.

1271
01:55:52,460 --> 01:55:53,460
All right.

1272
01:55:53,460 --> 01:55:54,460
Anyhow, moving on.

1273
01:55:54,460 --> 01:55:57,460
One of the games I mentioned there was Shantae.

1274
01:55:57,460 --> 01:56:02,460
And yes, the classic Shantae titles are coming to Nintendo Switch in the fall.

1275
01:56:02,460 --> 01:56:05,460
Some of the earliest Shantae games, actually.

1276
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:09,460
The very first game, which I think Dark Soccer did as a game of the week, sometime this year.

1277
01:56:09,460 --> 01:56:10,460
I don't think it was that long ago.

1278
01:56:10,460 --> 01:56:12,460
I'm pretty sure that I did.

1279
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:15,460
Yeah, it was originally released for the Game Boy Color in 2002.

1280
01:56:15,460 --> 01:56:19,460
It is going to be released on the eShop at some point this fall.

1281
01:56:19,460 --> 01:56:24,460
Don't know when, but it does also tie into Limited Run Games is also going to be putting that out.

1282
01:56:24,460 --> 01:56:25,460
That's really cool.

1283
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:28,460
They will also, this is a trip.

1284
01:56:28,460 --> 01:56:31,460
It's not only are they going to be doing the Switch version of the game.

1285
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:37,460
They are going to facilitate a new run of cartridges for the Game Boy Color.

1286
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:40,460
So if you want to get a legit, legit Shantae.

1287
01:56:40,460 --> 01:56:44,460
Well, I mean, it is a repressing, but you know, still, that's pretty cool.

1288
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:50,460
And they are saying it's because, you know, Shantae's kind of built up a following that it didn't have when it originally came out.

1289
01:56:51,460 --> 01:56:55,460
Shantae's Risky Revenge, also coming to Nintendo Switch and Xbox One.

1290
01:56:55,460 --> 01:56:58,460
That originally was a DSi title, but they will be doing that.

1291
01:56:58,460 --> 01:57:00,460
And again, Limited Run involved with that.

1292
01:57:00,460 --> 01:57:03,460
So Shantae fans have a lot to be happy about.

1293
01:57:03,460 --> 01:57:06,460
Insert the mandatory Shantae, you stay joke.

1294
01:57:06,460 --> 01:57:10,460
All right, what do we have from Dark Soccer?

1295
01:57:10,460 --> 01:57:13,460
We have some other stuff.

1296
01:57:13,460 --> 01:57:17,460
Bloodstained, Cursed of the Moon 2, which is fun.

1297
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:28,460
Is getting version 1.2.0 released on the 16th that has, July 16th that is, as boss rush mode and some bug fixes.

1298
01:57:28,460 --> 01:57:30,460
Just keep your eyes open for it.

1299
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:39,460
And then the director and writer for the Ace Attorney series, Yamazaki Takeshi, has left Capcom.

1300
01:57:39,460 --> 01:57:44,460
He was with the company for 15 years.

1301
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:50,460
And he's quoted as saying, although leaving a company is always painful, I like to think of this as graduating.

1302
01:57:50,460 --> 01:57:55,460
I'm truly glad I was able to make games and meet the Ace Attorney series at Capcom.

1303
01:57:55,460 --> 01:57:59,460
And he's going to keep working in game development, looking for other challenges.

1304
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:02,460
Best of luck to him.

1305
01:58:02,460 --> 01:58:07,460
Maybe we'll get some type of new series that has similarities to Ace Attorney.

1306
01:58:07,460 --> 01:58:08,460
Yet different.

1307
01:58:08,460 --> 01:58:09,460
All right.

1308
01:58:09,460 --> 01:58:10,460
Yet different.

1309
01:58:10,460 --> 01:58:16,460
Well, let's travel around the world and check out some games coming out a little sooner than that as we do some world release dates.

1310
01:58:16,460 --> 01:58:19,460
And why don't we start in the US with Loki?

1311
01:58:19,460 --> 01:58:24,460
So this week we've got Death Stranding coming out on PC.

1312
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:28,460
Rocket Arena on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1313
01:58:28,460 --> 01:58:33,460
Story of Seasons, Friends of Mineral Town on PC and Nintendo Switch.

1314
01:58:33,460 --> 01:58:39,460
We've got Dragon Quest Tacked on iOS and Android.

1315
01:58:39,460 --> 01:58:45,460
Superhot Mind Control Delete on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1316
01:58:45,460 --> 01:58:52,460
And by the way, if you own a copy of the original Superhot on any of those platforms and not necessarily from, I think, one of the free services.

1317
01:58:52,460 --> 01:58:55,460
Probably Humble if you did get that.

1318
01:58:55,460 --> 01:58:57,460
You get this for free.

1319
01:58:57,460 --> 01:58:58,460
So that's pretty cool.

1320
01:58:58,460 --> 01:59:00,460
So check your library.

1321
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:03,460
Ghosts of Tsushima on PlayStation 4.

1322
01:59:03,460 --> 01:59:06,460
Death Come True on PC.

1323
01:59:06,460 --> 01:59:12,460
And last but not least, Paper Mario, the Origami King on Nintendo Switch.

1324
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:15,460
I think there's a couple of people looking forward to that. That's for sure.

1325
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:17,460
I am looking forward to that.

1326
01:59:17,460 --> 01:59:22,460
So assuming I can pry that switch away from my kids and my wife.

1327
01:59:22,460 --> 01:59:23,460
I might check it out.

1328
01:59:23,460 --> 01:59:28,460
It's hard to tear myself away from Animal Crossing, which I know I didn't talk a lot about my gaming week.

1329
01:59:28,460 --> 01:59:32,460
But I'm kind of I'm back on Animal Crossing because I actually I kind of enjoy the diving thing.

1330
01:59:32,460 --> 01:59:34,460
I kind of like breathe a little new life.

1331
01:59:34,460 --> 01:59:36,460
But I don't have the same concerns Star Soccer had.

1332
01:59:36,460 --> 01:59:38,460
Like, I don't have enough people.

1333
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:41,460
I don't have enough people that want to come visit to worry about my island is kind of a dump anyway.

1334
01:59:41,460 --> 01:59:44,460
And like, you can't make the dump look worse.

1335
01:59:44,460 --> 01:59:46,460
So I'm not worried about it.

1336
01:59:46,460 --> 01:59:48,460
But I think you cover your beach and stingweed.

1337
01:59:48,460 --> 01:59:51,460
Yeah, I've been enjoying I've been enjoying the diving mechanic.

1338
01:59:51,460 --> 01:59:53,460
It's fun. I like collecting the wetsuits, too.

1339
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:55,460
All right. By the way, Rob.

1340
01:59:55,460 --> 01:59:57,460
I got I have a Pascal card.

1341
01:59:57,460 --> 01:59:59,460
And if you want a poster, I'll send you a poster.

1342
01:59:59,460 --> 02:00:01,460
I think you have sent me one.

1343
02:00:01,460 --> 02:00:03,460
You've been very good about the Pascal card.

1344
02:00:03,460 --> 02:00:05,460
Oh, OK.

1345
02:00:05,460 --> 02:00:08,460
I don't think I got a Katie card to sell some new Katie poster.

1346
02:00:08,460 --> 02:00:09,460
That's fun. All right.

1347
02:00:09,460 --> 02:00:11,460
Nice if she comes back in the game anyway.

1348
02:00:11,460 --> 02:00:14,460
Let's talk about Nintendo Switch releases coming out in Japan.

1349
02:00:14,460 --> 02:00:20,460
So in Japan, we have together the battle cats comes out in Japan this week.

1350
02:00:20,460 --> 02:00:24,460
And I'm curious if that means finally we're getting our laser cat stream game.

1351
02:00:24,460 --> 02:00:26,460
But I don't think this is actually that.

1352
02:00:26,460 --> 02:00:30,460
But it does say this game features over three hundred and fifty creepy,

1353
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:32,460
cute cat characters.

1354
02:00:32,460 --> 02:00:36,460
You train and strengthen your cats through gacha games,

1355
02:00:36,460 --> 02:00:38,460
cat coins, tickets.

1356
02:00:38,460 --> 02:00:40,460
Yeah. All right.

1357
02:00:40,460 --> 02:00:45,460
Also coming out on the switch, Code Realize Shirogane no Kisuke comes out this week,

1358
02:00:45,460 --> 02:00:49,460
as well as a game called Indivisible is out this week in Japan.

1359
02:00:49,460 --> 02:00:51,460
I think that's coming out other places, too.

1360
02:00:51,460 --> 02:00:54,460
So that's the releases for the Nintendo Switch.

1361
02:00:54,460 --> 02:01:00,460
Looking at the PlayStation 4, we have Indivisible is also out on PlayStation 4.

1362
02:01:00,460 --> 02:01:06,460
And then Ghosts of Tsushima is also out this week on the same day as it is in the U.S.

1363
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:07,460
The 17th.

1364
02:01:07,460 --> 02:01:09,460
And those are your big releases in Japan this week.

1365
02:01:09,460 --> 02:01:11,460
How about Europe, Dark Sakura?

1366
02:01:11,460 --> 02:01:13,460
There's a few.

1367
02:01:13,460 --> 02:01:21,460
On July 13th, we have Rocket Arena, also the PC version of Death Stranding.

1368
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:25,460
On the 16th, we have Paper Mario, the Origami King,

1369
02:01:25,460 --> 02:01:28,460
Warhammer 40,000, Mechanicus.

1370
02:01:28,460 --> 02:01:35,460
And also on the 16th, Ghosts of Tsushima, which I really am interested in.

1371
02:01:35,460 --> 02:01:37,460
But backlog.

1372
02:01:39,460 --> 02:01:41,460
The struggle.

1373
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:43,460
All right.

1374
02:01:43,460 --> 02:01:45,460
Every week we read the mail bag.

1375
02:01:45,460 --> 02:01:47,460
I don't know if Dark Sakura remembers how to do it.

1376
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:49,460
It's been so long.

1377
02:01:49,460 --> 02:01:52,460
I can read and we have one.

1378
02:01:52,460 --> 02:01:57,460
I know you know how to read, but I'm like, do you remember the password to the mail bag?

1379
02:01:57,460 --> 02:01:59,460
I don't have to. I have autofill.

1380
02:01:59,460 --> 02:02:01,460
Oh, OK. All right.

1381
02:02:01,460 --> 02:02:08,460
Well, if as a reminder, if you need the password to the mail bag, it's Loki is a butt.

1382
02:02:08,460 --> 02:02:10,460
That's the password. OK. All right.

1383
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:15,460
Anyway, participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place where you can send your emails every week.

1384
02:02:15,460 --> 02:02:18,460
And it sounds like Dark Sakura has one to read for us tonight.

1385
02:02:18,460 --> 02:02:20,460
I do.

1386
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:25,460
And I think you might have hit your button trying to do it.

1387
02:02:25,460 --> 02:02:26,460
Yeah. Yeah.

1388
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:30,460
So I have funny hype mayhem.

1389
02:02:30,460 --> 02:02:32,460
The password is one, two, three, four, five.

1390
02:02:32,460 --> 02:02:33,460
The same as my luggage.

1391
02:02:33,460 --> 02:02:34,460
Yay, Spaceballs.

1392
02:02:34,460 --> 02:02:40,460
By the way, off topic, I saw Spaceballs, the mask, and I'm probably going to get it.

1393
02:02:40,460 --> 02:02:42,460
OK. Anyway, that's a good one.

1394
02:02:42,460 --> 02:02:44,460
I'd get that, too.

1395
02:02:44,460 --> 02:02:46,460
Hello, LR.

1396
02:02:46,460 --> 02:02:48,460
OK, I have to find it again.

1397
02:02:48,460 --> 02:02:52,460
One of the calmer parts of last week's episode was a debate about the price of next gen games

1398
02:02:52,460 --> 02:02:58,460
and whether AAA games have any right to move up to seventy dollars from their previous MSRP of 60.

1399
02:02:58,460 --> 02:02:59,460
Hold on. Hold on.

1400
02:02:59,460 --> 02:03:03,460
Did the emailer say one of the calmer parts of the last episode?

1401
02:03:03,460 --> 02:03:05,460
Is that what it said?

1402
02:03:05,460 --> 02:03:07,460
Mm hmm.

1403
02:03:07,460 --> 02:03:12,460
I think that's a commentary on our last episode, Loki.

1404
02:03:12,460 --> 02:03:17,460
This is what happens when I'm not here to babysit you.

1405
02:03:17,460 --> 02:03:19,460
All right. No, I.

1406
02:03:19,460 --> 02:03:25,460
I don't know if you know about my my friend online that passed away and covid was suspected, but I,

1407
02:03:25,460 --> 02:03:31,460
I really got angry about all that stuff last week, and I know you're angry, too, because you're dealing with it, too.

1408
02:03:31,460 --> 02:03:34,460
So anyway. Anyway. Sorry. Go ahead.

1409
02:03:34,460 --> 02:03:41,460
It's just it's just hard for me to think of my mother there by herself, uninsured because of anyway.

1410
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:44,460
Before I make a point, let's get one thing out of the way.

1411
02:03:44,460 --> 02:03:49,460
Buyable virtual currency loot boxes and gotcha mechanics are in full price.

1412
02:03:49,460 --> 02:03:58,460
AAA games are absolute and total bullshit. Either get rid of that garbage or make that component of a free of a game free to play.

1413
02:03:58,460 --> 02:04:06,460
That nonsense aside, full price AAA games went up from fifty dollars to sixty dollars with the launch of the Xbox 360 all the way back in 2005.

1414
02:04:06,460 --> 02:04:09,460
Well, in 2005, you could still get a candy bar for a dollar.

1415
02:04:09,460 --> 02:04:12,460
Since then, the cost of everything has gone way up.

1416
02:04:12,460 --> 02:04:18,460
The impact of inflation has been so significant that in order to match the overall purchasing power of sixty U.S.

1417
02:04:18,460 --> 02:04:22,460
dollars back in 2005, you would need about 80 U.S. dollars today.

1418
02:04:22,460 --> 02:04:29,460
So the price of games today is actually decreased significantly since 2005, even more so if you consider the fact that these days,

1419
02:04:29,460 --> 02:04:34,460
almost every non Nintendo game starts getting discounted mere weeks after its release.

1420
02:04:34,460 --> 02:04:37,460
Hell, you can get Anthem for five dollars right now.

1421
02:04:37,460 --> 02:04:45,460
If an increase to seventy dollars means that there's a greater chance we will be able to continue purchasing big budget story driven AAA games,

1422
02:04:45,460 --> 02:04:47,460
then I am honestly all for it.

1423
02:04:47,460 --> 02:04:53,460
I'd rather pay a little more to have games on day one than see everything turn into a gotcha loot box game as a service.

1424
02:04:53,460 --> 02:04:55,460
What do you folks think?

1425
02:04:55,460 --> 02:04:58,460
And that really that echoes a lot of what I said last week.

1426
02:04:58,460 --> 02:05:01,460
So, yeah.

1427
02:05:01,460 --> 02:05:05,460
Well, yeah, I.

1428
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:13,460
I don't mind paying for things that are worth it, so they're still going to do it, even if they charge 80 or 90 dollars for the game,

1429
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:16,460
they're still going to have all those because they can get money from you both ways.

1430
02:05:16,460 --> 02:05:19,460
Why not? They're going to do it.

1431
02:05:19,460 --> 02:05:27,460
See, that's the thing is, like, even though you're saying that games would have been equivalently the same amount or less money now than they were back

1432
02:05:27,460 --> 02:05:34,460
when the Xbox 360 launch, we didn't have like a ton of DLC coming out for these titles.

1433
02:05:34,460 --> 02:05:40,460
They weren't pushing that stuff like they were at the beginning of that generation as they are now.

1434
02:05:40,460 --> 02:05:45,460
Like, I mean, hell, back in that generation, the very beginning, you still had cheat codes in games.

1435
02:05:45,460 --> 02:05:49,460
Nowadays, you have to buy that as DLC.

1436
02:05:49,460 --> 02:05:55,460
It's slowly been piecemealing, you know, stuff from the games, adding it to the cost.

1437
02:05:55,460 --> 02:05:59,460
Yeah, your initial buying costs may be slightly cheaper if you account for inflation,

1438
02:05:59,460 --> 02:06:06,460
but then you have all the other additional stuff on top of that in order to get the same experience you would have gotten back when that console originally launched.

1439
02:06:06,460 --> 02:06:11,460
I think, though, and this kind of briefly came up here in the email and so forth,

1440
02:06:11,460 --> 02:06:17,460
is that the games industry in some ways is almost kind of like policing their own prices.

1441
02:06:17,460 --> 02:06:22,460
And we talked about that a little bit last week's show is that, you know, video games can be like 10 bucks, you know,

1442
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:28,460
or they can be even cheaper than that on places like itch.io and other independent sites online, Steam and so forth, you know.

1443
02:06:28,460 --> 02:06:31,460
But there's a lot of video games out there that are 10, 20 bucks.

1444
02:06:31,460 --> 02:06:35,460
Heck, I just recommended a game at the top of the show that I think is more in the $20 price category.

1445
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:38,460
So there's all these different games of all these different price ranges.

1446
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:43,460
And what I mean by policing itself is, in the email I brought up, you could get Anthem now for five bucks,

1447
02:06:43,460 --> 02:06:47,460
because pretty quickly word got out that this game ain't worth 60 bucks.

1448
02:06:47,460 --> 02:06:53,460
And they're having a hard time getting people to pay five bucks for it, which is kind of sad for all those, you know,

1449
02:06:53,460 --> 02:06:56,460
developers and people to spend a lot of time making the game.

1450
02:06:56,460 --> 02:07:03,460
But at the same time, they kind of had to come in the high level executive decisions to change some of those things.

1451
02:07:03,460 --> 02:07:09,460
And, you know, the fact that we all knew Anthem would end up being a games as a service type of thing,

1452
02:07:09,460 --> 02:07:12,460
and they tried to charge the full price and have all these other things going on.

1453
02:07:12,460 --> 02:07:18,460
So I kind of feel like when word gets out and it can impact the sales of games.

1454
02:07:18,460 --> 02:07:22,460
And so the price of the game ends up having to like change itself.

1455
02:07:22,460 --> 02:07:29,460
Whereas there's other games, a lot of Nintendo titles that still charge full price to this day,

1456
02:07:29,460 --> 02:07:31,460
and people pay it because they're worth it.

1457
02:07:31,460 --> 02:07:35,460
Has Zelda Breath of the Wild ever gone on sale?

1458
02:07:35,460 --> 02:07:41,460
Maybe for like Black Friday or a holiday sale, but outside of that, probably not.

1459
02:07:41,460 --> 02:07:47,460
It has because I purchased it on sale, so I know it has.

1460
02:07:47,460 --> 02:07:50,460
But certainly you get the point I'm making, though.

1461
02:07:50,460 --> 02:07:53,460
Like, it's rare, it's few and far between.

1462
02:07:53,460 --> 02:07:58,460
They could still charge 60 bucks for that game and probably get it.

1463
02:07:58,460 --> 02:07:59,460
Yeah.

1464
02:07:59,460 --> 02:08:00,460
All right.

1465
02:08:00,460 --> 02:08:03,460
Anyhow, and as Joe 100 Matt says, it's dropped to maybe 40.

1466
02:08:03,460 --> 02:08:04,460
Yes, you can. Sorry.

1467
02:08:04,460 --> 02:08:05,460
Okay.

1468
02:08:05,460 --> 02:08:09,460
Also, I must say, as much as I enjoyed the classic game of the week last episode,

1469
02:08:09,460 --> 02:08:10,460
I was a bit disappointed.

1470
02:08:10,460 --> 02:08:14,460
It was included in Namco Museum Archives Volume 2, you said.

1471
02:08:14,460 --> 02:08:16,460
It was a game not developed by Namco, you said.

1472
02:08:16,460 --> 02:08:19,460
But sadly, it was not my favorite game from that collection

1473
02:08:19,460 --> 02:08:23,460
and the reason I thought nothing of dropping $20 on it day one.

1474
02:08:23,460 --> 02:08:25,460
Game Freak's phenomenal Mendel Palace.

1475
02:08:25,460 --> 02:08:30,460
Actually, I decided years ago that if for some reason I was ever in studio

1476
02:08:30,460 --> 02:08:33,460
and asked to pick a classic game of the week, it would be that one.

1477
02:08:33,460 --> 02:08:35,460
And here we were so close.

1478
02:08:35,460 --> 02:08:38,460
Rob, if you decide to buy Volume 2 in the future,

1479
02:08:38,460 --> 02:08:40,460
I highly recommend that you check it out.

1480
02:08:40,460 --> 02:08:43,460
It's one of my favorite arcade-style games of all time.

1481
02:08:43,460 --> 02:08:44,460
Have a great week, everybody.

1482
02:08:44,460 --> 02:08:45,460
Aaron, YYR.

1483
02:08:45,460 --> 02:08:50,460
So just so you know, Dark Sakura, last week when you weren't going to be here,

1484
02:08:50,460 --> 02:08:53,460
I switched out the classic game real quick and I did Legacy of the Wizard

1485
02:08:53,460 --> 02:08:56,460
because it had come up in that Namco collection discussion

1486
02:08:56,460 --> 02:08:59,460
and I owned that game when I was a kid, so I was talking about that.

1487
02:08:59,460 --> 02:09:03,460
So I think YYR is a little disappointed because, as he says,

1488
02:09:03,460 --> 02:09:07,460
also in that collection is Mendel Palace, but I didn't own that game as a kid.

1489
02:09:07,460 --> 02:09:09,460
I'm not as familiar with that game.

1490
02:09:09,460 --> 02:09:13,460
I can't talk off the cusp on that game as well, but who knows?

1491
02:09:13,460 --> 02:09:15,460
You never know what might happen in the future.

1492
02:09:15,460 --> 02:09:17,460
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

1493
02:09:17,460 --> 02:09:18,460
Maybe.

1494
02:09:18,460 --> 02:09:19,460
All right.

1495
02:09:19,460 --> 02:09:20,460
Was that it?

1496
02:09:20,460 --> 02:09:22,460
Now I'm going to do E.T.

1497
02:09:22,460 --> 02:09:23,460
Yeah, that was it.

1498
02:09:23,460 --> 02:09:26,460
I thought I saw one come in right at showtime.

1499
02:09:26,460 --> 02:09:30,460
When I just hit delete on the email, it was empty.

1500
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:32,460
That was the one that came in.

1501
02:09:32,460 --> 02:09:33,460
Okay, that's weird.

1502
02:09:33,460 --> 02:09:35,460
Because somebody doesn't clean out the email box.

1503
02:09:35,460 --> 02:09:36,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1504
02:09:36,460 --> 02:09:37,460
All right.

1505
02:09:37,460 --> 02:09:39,460
If we did accidentally miss anyone, we'll get to it.

1506
02:09:39,460 --> 02:09:42,460
Because the thing I saw had an attachment anyway

1507
02:09:42,460 --> 02:09:45,460
that's going to need to be looked at this week, so we'll come back to it.

1508
02:09:45,460 --> 02:09:48,460
So not ignoring anyone on purpose, I promise.

1509
02:09:48,460 --> 02:09:49,460
All right.

1510
02:09:49,460 --> 02:09:50,460
You'll have to check the trash then.

1511
02:09:50,460 --> 02:09:53,460
Yeah, I'll check the trash because we might have just accidentally missed it.

1512
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:57,460
But I think there is one because I just noticed it right at 6 o'clock.

1513
02:09:57,460 --> 02:09:58,460
So anyway.

1514
02:09:58,460 --> 02:09:59,460
We'll take a look.

1515
02:09:59,460 --> 02:10:01,460
Yeah, it's no biggie.

1516
02:10:01,460 --> 02:10:05,460
If you read it, you'll be like, oh, there's something in it that Rob needs time to look at.

1517
02:10:05,460 --> 02:10:07,460
And I didn't have time before the show.

1518
02:10:07,460 --> 02:10:08,460
All right.

1519
02:10:08,460 --> 02:10:10,460
So if we kick it to next week, it's not a big deal.

1520
02:10:10,460 --> 02:10:11,460
All right.

1521
02:10:11,460 --> 02:10:12,460
Moving on.

1522
02:10:12,460 --> 02:10:14,460
Let's get to some more gaming news.

1523
02:10:14,460 --> 02:10:16,460
In the meantime, you can email us.

1524
02:10:16,460 --> 02:10:19,460
Actually, I found an email that I didn't read, actually.

1525
02:10:19,460 --> 02:10:21,460
Okay, do you want to read it?

1526
02:10:21,460 --> 02:10:22,460
I think it's the one I'm thinking of.

1527
02:10:22,460 --> 02:10:23,460
Yeah, go for it.

1528
02:10:23,460 --> 02:10:24,460
I don't see any attachments on it.

1529
02:10:24,460 --> 02:10:29,460
Hey, OLR, not sure if this will be on your showroom this week.

1530
02:10:29,460 --> 02:10:32,460
But yeah, it does have a link to it.

1531
02:10:32,460 --> 02:10:34,460
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

1532
02:10:34,460 --> 02:10:35,460
That's all right.

1533
02:10:35,460 --> 02:10:36,460
You read it.

1534
02:10:36,460 --> 02:10:37,460
It's fine.

1535
02:10:37,460 --> 02:10:38,460
All right.

1536
02:10:38,460 --> 02:10:39,460
But this week was the GMTK Game Jam.

1537
02:10:39,460 --> 02:10:44,460
It was started by the guy behind the Game Makers Toolkit YouTube channel and is now

1538
02:10:44,460 --> 02:10:46,460
almost as big as Ludlam Dare.

1539
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:51,460
This year, 70,000 people registered and over 5,000 games were submitted at the end of the

1540
02:10:51,460 --> 02:10:52,460
weekend.

1541
02:10:52,460 --> 02:10:55,460
I joined it almost this close.

1542
02:10:55,460 --> 02:10:57,460
One of them is mine.

1543
02:10:57,460 --> 02:10:58,460
It's called Momentum.

1544
02:10:58,460 --> 02:11:00,460
It's a platform game similar to Celeste.

1545
02:11:00,460 --> 02:11:03,460
Put out a link, which we'll check it out first.

1546
02:11:03,460 --> 02:11:06,460
And if you want to share it, then that's fine.

1547
02:11:06,460 --> 02:11:08,460
Anyone wants to look in.

1548
02:11:08,460 --> 02:11:13,460
So this is my first proper game jam, and it was a stressful 48 hours, especially when

1549
02:11:13,460 --> 02:11:16,460
I decided to ditch my first idea halfway through.

1550
02:11:16,460 --> 02:11:18,460
I'm super proud of the game I built, though.

1551
02:11:18,460 --> 02:11:23,460
Plus, it was nice to have a lockdown weekend where I didn't lie around doing nothing for

1552
02:11:23,460 --> 02:11:24,460
once.

1553
02:11:24,460 --> 02:11:26,460
I hope you're all doing well.

1554
02:11:26,460 --> 02:11:30,460
OLR continues to be my port in this very stormy year, Elliot B.

1555
02:11:30,460 --> 02:11:32,460
Well, thank you for that.

1556
02:11:32,460 --> 02:11:36,460
And congratulations on actually completing a game, unlike someone else on this panel

1557
02:11:36,460 --> 02:11:38,460
whose shower name is Aimless.

1558
02:11:38,460 --> 02:11:40,460
Someone missed this opportunity.

1559
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:42,460
That's more than what I did.

1560
02:11:42,460 --> 02:11:44,460
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1561
02:11:44,460 --> 02:11:45,460
And I'm sorry.

1562
02:11:45,460 --> 02:11:48,460
I saved all the emails that didn't look like they had been checked.

1563
02:11:48,460 --> 02:11:49,460
So I apologize.

1564
02:11:49,460 --> 02:11:51,460
I'm glad I went back and looked for it.

1565
02:11:51,460 --> 02:11:55,460
Darsakha and I have different ways of managing the email account, as in she manages it and

1566
02:11:56,460 --> 02:11:59,460
But Bobby Shade Wolf in our chat room says,

1567
02:11:59,460 --> 02:12:03,460
You do realize that game jams expect you to finish something by the deadline, usually,

1568
02:12:03,460 --> 02:12:05,460
right, Loki?

1569
02:12:05,460 --> 02:12:08,460
Hey, Loki could have gotten a pizza.

1570
02:12:08,460 --> 02:12:10,460
I offered him pizza.

1571
02:12:10,460 --> 02:12:11,460
That's right.

1572
02:12:11,460 --> 02:12:13,460
Oh, yeah, the pizza.

1573
02:12:13,460 --> 02:12:14,460
Oh, my.

1574
02:12:14,460 --> 02:12:15,460
That was my favorite.

1575
02:12:15,460 --> 02:12:18,460
That was one of my favorite jokes ever on this show.

1576
02:12:18,460 --> 02:12:19,460
It's a contest.

1577
02:12:19,460 --> 02:12:23,460
One person is eligible.

1578
02:12:23,460 --> 02:12:29,460
I can even extend time to pizza because I can have it delivered to your house.

1579
02:12:29,460 --> 02:12:32,460
So I will extend time to pizza for this year.

1580
02:12:32,460 --> 02:12:33,460
Elliot, here's the bummer.

1581
02:12:33,460 --> 02:12:37,460
Thank you for emailing us and congratulations on your successful game jam.

1582
02:12:37,460 --> 02:12:40,460
But here's the gag since I didn't see your email till just before we went on air.

1583
02:12:40,460 --> 02:12:42,460
I haven't been able to play your game.

1584
02:12:42,460 --> 02:12:48,460
So I'm sure it's great, like, but I can't comment on it further.

1585
02:12:48,460 --> 02:12:50,460
But congratulations on completing that.

1586
02:12:50,460 --> 02:12:53,460
And it does sound like there's a lot of people that participate in this game jam.

1587
02:12:53,460 --> 02:12:56,460
And I'm not surprised, especially in quarantine time,

1588
02:12:56,460 --> 02:12:59,460
that you have so many people that are participating in game jams.

1589
02:12:59,460 --> 02:13:01,460
Hell, Loki actually almost did it.

1590
02:13:01,460 --> 02:13:04,460
And he might have, like, at least put an idea down or something.

1591
02:13:04,460 --> 02:13:06,460
I did put an idea down.

1592
02:13:06,460 --> 02:13:08,460
Oh, oh.

1593
02:13:08,460 --> 02:13:15,460
I didn't make anything, but I put the idea down because it was the idea.

1594
02:13:15,460 --> 02:13:17,460
Now we want to know.

1595
02:13:18,460 --> 02:13:20,460
Well, first I have to make it sure it's the same game jam

1596
02:13:20,460 --> 02:13:22,460
because there's, like, several game jams going on at the same time.

1597
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:28,460
So I think it was, if I'm correct, it was the one that was Out of Control, I think was the theme.

1598
02:13:28,460 --> 02:13:30,460
Yes, OK, so it was.

1599
02:13:30,460 --> 02:13:32,460
So it was Out of Control was the theme.

1600
02:13:32,460 --> 02:13:39,460
And I was inspired by this game I played on the Ouya called No Brakes Valet.

1601
02:13:39,460 --> 02:13:43,460
So the whole premise was going to be a, like, just a racing game.

1602
02:13:43,460 --> 02:13:46,460
But it's all gas, no brakes.

1603
02:13:46,460 --> 02:13:48,460
So that was going to be the game.

1604
02:13:48,460 --> 02:13:53,460
It's a racing game the way I play racing games, which is I don't use the brakes at all.

1605
02:13:53,460 --> 02:13:55,460
I just smash into the walls and stuff.

1606
02:13:55,460 --> 02:14:01,460
And so not so much a racing game, but kind of like a puzzle game where you would have to get to your house

1607
02:14:01,460 --> 02:14:07,460
or something like that without killing yourself, which means colliding with another car.

1608
02:14:07,460 --> 02:14:12,460
But of course, there'd be collateral damage with, like, pedestrians on the street and stuff like that.

1609
02:14:12,460 --> 02:14:15,460
Are you sure you aren't describing roundabout?

1610
02:14:15,460 --> 02:14:18,460
Because I'm kind of, did you ever play roundabout with the limo?

1611
02:14:18,460 --> 02:14:21,460
No, I did play roundabout. That's a whole, it's a different type of game.

1612
02:14:21,460 --> 02:14:23,460
I know what you're talking about there.

1613
02:14:23,460 --> 02:14:30,460
Shane has spent years trying to convince me that game is funny when I'm like, it's more awkward than it is funny.

1614
02:14:30,460 --> 02:14:35,460
It's OK. It was an OK game. I played it, but like, no.

1615
02:14:35,460 --> 02:14:38,460
Cue a text message in three, two, one.

1616
02:14:38,460 --> 02:14:42,460
Yeah. No Brakes Valet was the one I played because that was kind of fun.

1617
02:14:42,460 --> 02:14:46,460
You had to park a car, but you fit.

1618
02:14:46,460 --> 02:14:51,460
Well, that one, you could use brakes, although I didn't figure out that there was a brake button for the longest time.

1619
02:14:51,460 --> 02:14:58,460
But you tried to park your car in specific spaces and then one of them has no brakes.

1620
02:14:58,460 --> 02:15:02,460
And you and you're just smashing cars in this like this parking lot.

1621
02:15:02,460 --> 02:15:04,460
It's kind of funny. Yeah. OK. Inspiration.

1622
02:15:05,460 --> 02:15:08,460
That's going to take too long. Not going to have the time to actually take.

1623
02:15:08,460 --> 02:15:14,460
I was going to get about like half of the time in the jam anyways to even work on anything and probably less than that.

1624
02:15:14,460 --> 02:15:16,460
So I just didn't start it.

1625
02:15:16,460 --> 02:15:21,460
Elliot in chat says, Loki, that would have totally fit the theme of GMTK Jam.

1626
02:15:21,460 --> 02:15:24,460
That was the name of it this year. The theme was out of control.

1627
02:15:24,460 --> 02:15:26,460
So this is the same game jam.

1628
02:15:26,460 --> 02:15:30,460
Yeah, it was. Yeah. I followed their channel. I watched a lot of their videos and stuff.

1629
02:15:30,460 --> 02:15:34,460
So we'll go play Elliot's game. It's the link is in chat.

1630
02:15:34,460 --> 02:15:37,460
I'll read it because it's not too hard to remember.

1631
02:15:37,460 --> 02:15:42,460
Paw prints. So P.A.W.P.R.I.N.T.S. dot itch dot IO.

1632
02:15:42,460 --> 02:15:49,460
Everybody knows that site, right? Paw prints dot itch IO slash momentum is the place to go to check out Elliot's game,

1633
02:15:49,460 --> 02:15:58,460
which he said was a little bit kind of kind of inspired by Celeste a little bit or a lot of like I seriously a lot of these game jams are starting to mix together.

1634
02:15:58,460 --> 02:16:03,460
There's there's another one that's Kenny. They're doing a Kenny land.

1635
02:16:03,460 --> 02:16:07,460
So Kenny is the guy. He does a lot of like CC zero assets out there.

1636
02:16:07,460 --> 02:16:12,460
So he's very famous and like the indie community as far as providing free art assets.

1637
02:16:12,460 --> 02:16:16,460
So he has a gym coming out that's going to be using his art assets.

1638
02:16:16,460 --> 02:16:22,460
Then there's the code list jam, which is being done by our local.

1639
02:16:22,460 --> 02:16:25,460
I don't remember the called now, but the SAC Gaming Collective or something like that.

1640
02:16:25,460 --> 02:16:28,460
So they have their developers collective. Yeah. Yeah.

1641
02:16:28,460 --> 02:16:35,460
So they're doing one that's it's a game jam that you have to use the visual scripting tools.

1642
02:16:35,460 --> 02:16:44,460
So like Bolt and I guess I'm trying to think what the UE4 stuff is.

1643
02:16:44,460 --> 02:16:51,460
Their blueprints and stuff like that. So you have to use that, which that's kind of a learning curve in itself.

1644
02:16:51,460 --> 02:16:55,460
But that's coming up. I like I seriously like all of these start crisscrossing.

1645
02:16:55,460 --> 02:17:02,460
Like I thought that the CC that the one game jam was the Kenny jam for like this time around, too.

1646
02:17:02,460 --> 02:17:08,460
So I don't know. But yeah, it's fun. I just wish I had the time.

1647
02:17:08,460 --> 02:17:18,460
Don't need to need to be longer. Like, you know, like I wish I could get in on the progressive game jams that the Sacramento group does,

1648
02:17:18,460 --> 02:17:24,460
because it's basically just getting together with a bunch of people like for five hours every month or week or whatever.

1649
02:17:24,460 --> 02:17:33,460
I think it's month and just starting to like collaborate that way over a long period of time versus like being able to have to cram in 48 hours.

1650
02:17:33,460 --> 02:17:38,460
I just I can't. Yeah, that's just like well, that's just like having like a regular DND game, basically.

1651
02:17:38,460 --> 02:17:42,460
But instead of playing a DND campaign, you're working as a group to create a new game.

1652
02:17:42,460 --> 02:17:51,460
Yeah, that that fits more like your lifestyle where, you know, you have to worry about raising kids and stuff and you can't exactly pull, you know, 48 hours straight and all that.

1653
02:17:51,460 --> 02:17:55,460
So I wish I could. I mean, I get it. I get it. That would be great. All right.

1654
02:17:55,460 --> 02:17:58,460
Well, let's move on with the show. We do have some more news we want to get into here.

1655
02:17:58,460 --> 02:18:04,460
Thank you so much for the email, Elliot. And I hope a lot of our listeners choose to play your game, which you got in chat there a moment ago.

1656
02:18:04,460 --> 02:18:11,460
And I will play it later this week. Promise. OK, let's move on and get into some other news.

1657
02:18:11,460 --> 02:18:17,460
And Loki, I think you're gonna start us off with this story. Yes. So this is interesting.

1658
02:18:17,460 --> 02:18:24,460
So there's this brand new Tetris mole game, I guess that is.

1659
02:18:24,460 --> 02:18:34,460
I guess it's a it's a brand new show that they're doing where you compete with other players to earn money by playing Tetris.

1660
02:18:34,460 --> 02:18:44,460
So every night, I guess at seven thirty, there's a show that's hosted by this actor, Millen Baird in New Zealand.

1661
02:18:44,460 --> 02:18:49,460
And players will fight each other for five thousand dollar daily prize pool.

1662
02:18:49,460 --> 02:18:56,460
And you play the current cities that you play in. Auckland, Perth, Moscow, Berlin, London, New York City and Los Angeles.

1663
02:18:56,460 --> 02:19:03,460
So whatever city you're closest to would be the city that you're competing in. And app is, I guess, free on Android and iOS.

1664
02:19:03,460 --> 02:19:11,460
And it's called Network Tetris and network with the E is a three.

1665
02:19:11,460 --> 02:19:20,460
So, yeah, you can try your chance to get money or what's actually probably going to happen is the people that are really good at Tetris are going to beat the crap out of you.

1666
02:19:20,460 --> 02:19:27,460
Yeah, somebody's going to somebody's going to cheat it or something. I wonder who cheated, but it's just going to be like you're going to have those kids.

1667
02:19:27,460 --> 02:19:34,460
Does anyone know if Kevin D.R. has found this game yet and attacked it? I'd be so curious.

1668
02:19:34,460 --> 02:19:39,460
So, yeah, I because I know he's very, very, very good at Tetris and could probably.

1669
02:19:39,460 --> 02:19:44,460
Yes, a lot of people. It is actually it's just the official Tetris game.

1670
02:19:44,460 --> 02:19:50,460
The company that makes it, though, is Network Inc, which is, you know, so just look for Tetris.

1671
02:19:51,460 --> 02:19:58,460
It's HQ trivia meets Tetris 99, basically, I guess. Yeah. Interesting. All right.

1672
02:19:58,460 --> 02:20:02,460
We'll see. We'll see what happens. All right. Moving on. Let's talk about now.

1673
02:20:02,460 --> 02:20:14,460
I don't I don't always need to talk about ninjas every step and move as as big news because I personally don't really follow the guy just because I'm not shading him.

1674
02:20:14,460 --> 02:20:18,460
It's just I follow other people that I just know and, you know, so forth.

1675
02:20:18,460 --> 02:20:24,460
I kind of keep it around like a similar circle to what I follow on Twitter. But I'm not an idiot.

1676
02:20:24,460 --> 02:20:27,460
I know that Ninja does have a lot of people that do follow him.

1677
02:20:27,460 --> 02:20:33,460
And wherever ninjas goes to stream is probably going to lead a big crowd with him.

1678
02:20:33,460 --> 02:20:40,460
Now, he was on Mixer, as we all know, and Mixer is not going to be any more pretty soon.

1679
02:20:40,460 --> 02:20:46,460
And Ninja turned down basically the opportunity to go right over to Facebook gaming.

1680
02:20:46,460 --> 02:20:51,460
And I don't blame him because he wants to probably will a face Facebook gaming sucks, too.

1681
02:20:51,460 --> 02:20:56,460
He probably wants to see what kind of money they're willing to give him first.

1682
02:20:56,460 --> 02:21:05,460
So anyway, some reports that are showing up this week is that now this is this is kind of a you know, this is coming from an e-sports consultant's Twitter account.

1683
02:21:05,460 --> 02:21:06,460
Take it with a grain of salt.

1684
02:21:06,460 --> 02:21:12,460
But based I mean, it isn't it isn't outside the on the plausibility scale. It ranks high.

1685
02:21:12,460 --> 02:21:19,460
So Ninja says is in negotiate. They are in negotiations with streaming platforms and no exclusive deal has yet been signed.

1686
02:21:19,460 --> 02:21:22,460
But I'm like, how many streaming platforms are there that are left?

1687
02:21:22,460 --> 02:21:29,460
Twitch, which he was with before YouTube and Facebook gaming, unless we don't count that last.

1688
02:21:29,460 --> 02:21:34,460
And I don't count flop book gaming. I'm sorry. It's that would be a horrible decision.

1689
02:21:34,460 --> 02:21:41,460
Like, but I could I could go off again, but I'd just be repeating myself from the last several weeks.

1690
02:21:41,460 --> 02:21:45,460
Friends don't look flat. Friends stream on flop book gaming.

1691
02:21:45,460 --> 02:21:52,460
So Ninja, but Ninja just you know what, if they want to pay him tons of money, then Ninja is willing to go there.

1692
02:21:52,460 --> 02:21:58,460
It sounds like it'll just see what happens. In the meantime, Ninja started a YouTube stream.

1693
02:21:58,460 --> 02:22:01,460
And so it's just kind of like, let's see what kind of numbers I can pull on YouTube.

1694
02:22:01,460 --> 02:22:07,460
Just, you know, doing a stream. And apparently one hundred and sixty thousand concurrent viewers showed up.

1695
02:22:07,460 --> 02:22:10,460
Although it did drop down to one hundred and twenty thousand people.

1696
02:22:10,460 --> 02:22:15,460
But I doubt that many people have ever listened to OLR in the world.

1697
02:22:15,460 --> 02:22:21,460
So that's still a really big number of people to be pulling in for one of your streams.

1698
02:22:21,460 --> 02:22:25,460
So that's pretty big. So, yeah, who knows where he'll end up.

1699
02:22:25,460 --> 02:22:29,460
And then there's always been those rumors about some type of like new streaming platform.

1700
02:22:29,460 --> 02:22:36,460
But seeing as those rumors also said we'd have an announcement by now, I'm sure those rumors were just full of crap.

1701
02:22:36,460 --> 02:22:39,460
But we'll we'll see what comes of this, because, you know, again,

1702
02:22:39,460 --> 02:22:47,460
although I don't think it's necessarily worth reporting on this guy's every move and step, he does carry a big audience.

1703
02:22:47,460 --> 02:22:53,460
And it is. I mean, if he does sign with flop book, it's going to be a pretty big deal.

1704
02:22:53,460 --> 02:22:55,460
So, you know, we'll see what happens with that.

1705
02:22:55,460 --> 02:23:02,460
So, Tiger Claw says there's others, too. There's SmashCast.tv.

1706
02:23:02,460 --> 02:23:06,460
Now, who knows if these companies could afford Ninja, though?

1707
02:23:06,460 --> 02:23:11,460
However, then with a with an up and comer like a SmashCast.

1708
02:23:11,460 --> 02:23:14,460
I don't know this company's financials. They're investors.

1709
02:23:14,460 --> 02:23:22,460
But let's say you have a startup. Something you can start to negotiate with with Ninja is a percentage of the stake in the company.

1710
02:23:22,460 --> 02:23:24,460
You know, like an episode of Shark Tank, right?

1711
02:23:24,460 --> 02:23:28,460
You get Ninja to join your up and coming thing for a 10 percent stake in the company.

1712
02:23:28,460 --> 02:23:33,460
And as his exposure helps up your total number of viewers, then your total valuation of your company goes up.

1713
02:23:33,460 --> 02:23:37,460
So it's like that stock he's holding goes up and up and up, basically.

1714
02:23:37,460 --> 02:23:42,460
So that could be an interesting thing to leverage with a newer company.

1715
02:23:42,460 --> 02:23:45,460
So we'll see. So. All right.

1716
02:23:45,460 --> 02:23:50,460
Act F says GFM cast is lucky if we get more than three concurrent viewers.

1717
02:23:50,460 --> 02:23:53,460
G.G. Ramas says, I feel you. And you know what?

1718
02:23:53,460 --> 02:24:00,460
And I tell all the podcasters in the world that I know this is that as even if there's just one person there,

1719
02:24:00,460 --> 02:24:03,460
that's still one person that wants to tune in to hear to what you have to say.

1720
02:24:03,460 --> 02:24:09,460
And also, sometimes it's about, you know, because we we were in those levels for years and years and years.

1721
02:24:10,460 --> 02:24:15,460
And sometimes it's about getting the group together to talk about to just hang,

1722
02:24:15,460 --> 02:24:19,460
to hang as a group and talk about the things that you enjoy and that.

1723
02:24:19,460 --> 02:24:21,460
I'd like to think we'd still be doing a well,

1724
02:24:21,460 --> 02:24:25,460
or even if we were only getting seven people here like we used to in the old days.

1725
02:24:25,460 --> 02:24:30,460
So they're going to miss all this wig action.

1726
02:24:30,460 --> 02:24:35,460
This is right. Those hundred twenty thousand people show today.

1727
02:24:35,460 --> 02:24:40,460
Those hundred twenty thousand people, they might be seeing Ninja, but are they seeing wigs?

1728
02:24:40,460 --> 02:24:45,460
I don't think so. Are they seeing all this?

1729
02:24:51,460 --> 02:24:56,460
Anyway, D.G. Ramas says, sometimes I do wish we'd get big numbers, but you know what?

1730
02:24:56,460 --> 02:25:01,460
When me, Mako, Ichigo and Ari do a show, it's just freaking fun and I love it.

1731
02:25:01,460 --> 02:25:06,460
And you know, I've kind of and I've said this before, like I feel like our moment has probably come and gone

1732
02:25:06,460 --> 02:25:10,460
where we would have been one of those shows that has hundreds of thousands of people watching.

1733
02:25:10,460 --> 02:25:13,460
And you know what? I'm at peace with it because when hundreds of people watch you,

1734
02:25:13,460 --> 02:25:16,460
that's when all of your movements get over analyzed.

1735
02:25:16,460 --> 02:25:22,460
And that's when, you know, people will dig back in the archives and find some shitty thing from the show

1736
02:25:22,460 --> 02:25:25,460
15 years ago and try to cancel me over it and all this stuff.

1737
02:25:25,460 --> 02:25:30,460
And I'm just like, you know, sometimes having a small group, it's not such a bad thing.

1738
02:25:31,460 --> 02:25:36,460
So. All right. Anyhow, let's move on, shall we?

1739
02:25:36,460 --> 02:25:39,460
I think where we are now is Dark Soccer. This is yours, right?

1740
02:25:39,460 --> 02:25:43,460
Oh, my gosh. It's been so long since I've done a show all the way through.

1741
02:25:43,460 --> 02:25:48,460
Anyway, how about some Amazon stuff?

1742
02:25:48,460 --> 02:25:54,460
Their MMO title, New Earth, got delayed.

1743
02:25:54,460 --> 02:26:03,460
Basically, they they had this whole, like, new entire world thing.

1744
02:26:03,460 --> 02:26:09,460
And it was supposed to set in some time at this point.

1745
02:26:09,460 --> 02:26:12,460
It was actually supposed to be released, I think, in March.

1746
02:26:12,460 --> 02:26:15,460
And then it was delayed until August 25th.

1747
02:26:15,460 --> 02:26:22,460
And now their studio director, Rich Lawrence, is saying they're delaying it until spring 2021.

1748
02:26:22,460 --> 02:26:28,460
And the reason is from different responses to the game's alpha reviews.

1749
02:26:28,460 --> 02:26:35,460
And the developers are trying to make sure that the most devoted players have loads of middle and end game experiences.

1750
02:26:35,460 --> 02:26:44,460
That is a quote. And so as compensation for this, there's going to be a beta for a limited time starting August 25th.

1751
02:26:44,460 --> 02:26:52,460
There'll be a beta sign up coming later on with those who preordered the game getting first access.

1752
02:26:52,460 --> 02:26:56,460
And so you can look into that and and order it.

1753
02:26:56,460 --> 02:27:04,460
If you're you know, I mean, if if you've got the preorder, then then you'll be able to get in on the beta.

1754
02:27:04,460 --> 02:27:11,460
And honestly, I commend them for listening to the reviews and for taking all of that into account,

1755
02:27:11,460 --> 02:27:18,460
because I would rather and while I have probably zero interest in playing it,

1756
02:27:18,460 --> 02:27:26,460
I would rather that they listen to the feedback and put time and effort into a quality release.

1757
02:27:26,460 --> 02:27:31,460
Well, and as as Quest Buster says in chat, after what happened with Crucible, I don't blame them.

1758
02:27:31,460 --> 02:27:36,460
That was a train wreck. And yeah, Amazon's track record with gaming for all the hype that, you know,

1759
02:27:36,460 --> 02:27:42,460
oh, my gosh, Amazon's got a game studio company. This isn't been a great year for them and this type of news.

1760
02:27:42,460 --> 02:27:47,460
So even though this delay will probably inevitably be a good thing for the lifespan of the game,

1761
02:27:47,460 --> 02:27:52,460
it isn't a good thing for Amazon Game Studios. Look now, at the same time,

1762
02:27:52,460 --> 02:27:58,460
you look at Amazon as an entire company and someone like Jeff Bezos has like one of those rooms that Uncle Scrooge has,

1763
02:27:58,460 --> 02:28:05,460
where you just who where who can dive off of the diving board and just swim in the money pit of money.

1764
02:28:05,460 --> 02:28:13,460
So I don't I'm not exactly concerned for Amazon's financial stability, but it's still probably not a great look for the company.

1765
02:28:13,460 --> 02:28:20,460
So anyway, as as we're on our Amazon owned Twitch feed.

1766
02:28:20,460 --> 02:28:26,460
But I'm looking at you. Yep. All right. Moving on. Loki.

1767
02:28:26,460 --> 02:28:32,460
All right. So this is kind of odd. So we just got done talking about a game show for Tetris.

1768
02:28:32,460 --> 02:28:38,460
Now there's a reality show for The Sims. Now, this is not what you might think it might be.

1769
02:28:38,460 --> 02:28:42,460
Please say they speak Simlish. They do not speak Simlish.

1770
02:28:42,460 --> 02:28:52,460
So this is a little bit along the lines of like a almost like that that Lego show that they had not too long ago.

1771
02:28:52,460 --> 02:28:57,460
It's about building stuff with The Sims.

1772
02:28:57,460 --> 02:29:02,460
So it's called The Sims Sparked and supposed to premiere actually on the 17th.

1773
02:29:02,460 --> 02:29:11,460
So that's this week. And it's supposed to be with contestants creating characters, worlds and stories in The Sims 4.

1774
02:29:11,460 --> 02:29:21,460
And with that, I guess there they have like a judges panel which will judge them and everything about the creations that they make and everything.

1775
02:29:21,460 --> 02:29:24,460
I just I don't know. It's interesting.

1776
02:29:24,460 --> 02:29:30,460
It also looks a little bit like Project Runway or something like that, you know, where they're just like building different things.

1777
02:29:30,460 --> 02:29:35,460
In fact, I think they even have parts where they're building clothing for their characters and stuff.

1778
02:29:35,460 --> 02:29:45,460
So it's different. That's for sure. But if it's anything like Lego Masters or whatever, where they focus on the drama.

1779
02:29:45,460 --> 02:29:50,460
Like, I hate that. I know maybe reality TV is just not for me because it's always focusing on drama.

1780
02:29:50,460 --> 02:29:55,460
But like, I love competition shows, but I hate when it's like a reality competition show.

1781
02:29:55,460 --> 02:30:00,460
I just would like the competition without all of the drama thrown in.

1782
02:30:00,460 --> 02:30:08,460
Yeah, I don't know. I mean, it's probably going to be a bit of a mess, but I still think Dark Sakura should think about applying because I mean,

1783
02:30:08,460 --> 02:30:14,460
Dark Sakura is very talented when it comes to The Sims and she has wigs.

1784
02:30:15,460 --> 02:30:21,460
She stepped away so she can't comment at the moment, but I'm still going to encourage that.

1785
02:30:21,460 --> 02:30:28,460
So apparently the judges that are on the panel for this first season, they have YouTube creator Kelsey Impechi.

1786
02:30:28,460 --> 02:30:33,460
I don't know how to pronounce her name. Sims voice actor Tayla Parks.

1787
02:30:33,460 --> 02:30:39,460
And I guess Dave Sim Guru Ninja Itoki.

1788
02:30:39,460 --> 02:30:44,460
And I guess they're going to have a producer as well for Maxis.

1789
02:30:46,460 --> 02:30:52,460
I don't know. It says the contestants are our various online personalities, which I guess have a connection to the series.

1790
02:30:52,460 --> 02:30:54,460
It's kind of similar to how Lego Masters was.

1791
02:30:54,460 --> 02:30:58,460
Wait, was that their judging panel you just read off?

1792
02:30:58,460 --> 02:31:02,460
Is like, wow, that's OK. Interesting.

1793
02:31:02,460 --> 02:31:06,460
So YouTube YouTube influencers are judging this.

1794
02:31:06,460 --> 02:31:10,460
Hey, Dark Sakura, we think you should go on The Sims reality show.

1795
02:31:10,460 --> 02:31:19,460
And there's a Sims reality show where because because you're good at The Sims about making stuff and you could make our show famous.

1796
02:31:19,460 --> 02:31:25,460
OK, they can pay me. I love how if you win.

1797
02:31:25,460 --> 02:31:29,460
So like the Lego builders thing. Yes, it is actually.

1798
02:31:29,460 --> 02:31:32,460
So apparently it's pretty short. They said this is far.

1799
02:31:32,460 --> 02:31:36,460
It's a joint production between TVS and BuzzFeed multiplayer.

1800
02:31:36,460 --> 02:31:43,460
And all four episodes are going to be online on Monday after the air or the Monday after they air on television.

1801
02:31:43,460 --> 02:31:45,460
So.

1802
02:31:45,460 --> 02:31:49,460
Neat, I guess.

1803
02:31:49,460 --> 02:31:55,460
I don't know. Not really interested in this is, but I don't know.

1804
02:31:55,460 --> 02:32:03,460
Some of the people I watch on YouTube, like the guy call me Kevin or whatever, would be more interesting to see on this show than some of these creators.

1805
02:32:03,460 --> 02:32:13,460
OK, and I'm sorry if I mispronounce your name, but I think I read that as I touch is an art, says the best line for dark soccer competing in this show.

1806
02:32:13,460 --> 02:32:17,460
Love your hair. Hope you win.

1807
02:32:17,460 --> 02:32:19,460
Yeah.

1808
02:32:19,460 --> 02:32:22,460
Which is a drag race, man. Yeah.

1809
02:32:23,460 --> 02:32:30,460
For the record, the wig that I'm wearing now, as some of you may remember, my hair was actually this color before.

1810
02:32:30,460 --> 02:32:34,460
I got this wig at DragCon two years ago, actually.

1811
02:32:34,460 --> 02:32:40,460
My buddy J.J., also known as the queen Miss Patsy declined, got me this wig.

1812
02:32:40,460 --> 02:32:45,460
It's your lightning wig. You look like lightning. I agree with chat. You look like lightning in that wig.

1813
02:32:45,460 --> 02:32:50,460
So love it. All right. They have a speed run competition for killing the Sims in this game.

1814
02:32:50,460 --> 02:32:53,460
I don't see I could see the dark soccer anymore.

1815
02:32:53,460 --> 02:32:59,460
Dark soccer could design like a murder house. And I think that would be she could be the spooky contestant.

1816
02:32:59,460 --> 02:33:03,460
Like, well, I was going to say Sharon Needles, but we don't talk about her anymore.

1817
02:33:03,460 --> 02:33:06,460
So spooky, like I don't know who's spooky in the drag race.

1818
02:33:07,460 --> 02:33:09,460
Elvira. Oh, perfect.

1819
02:33:09,460 --> 02:33:16,460
And Elvira is a bio queen. Let's be real.

1820
02:33:16,460 --> 02:33:20,460
She's like, yeah, everybody, everybody says Drag Race has never had a bio queen on it.

1821
02:33:20,460 --> 02:33:23,460
They've had one on the judging panel. Not that they shouldn't have contestants on the show, too.

1822
02:33:23,460 --> 02:33:26,460
But they've had one on the judging panel several times. Elvira.

1823
02:33:26,460 --> 02:33:32,460
So, yeah, well, and myself, myself, Visage. I mean, yeah, true.

1824
02:33:32,460 --> 02:33:39,460
All right. Anyway, moving on, let's talk about when you want to make big changes to your character in a game like World of Warcraft.

1825
02:33:39,460 --> 02:33:44,460
You've had to pay a fee before if you want to make changes like you want to change the race or the gender or what have you.

1826
02:33:44,460 --> 02:33:49,460
You have to pay a fee to Activision Blizzard in order to do that.

1827
02:33:49,460 --> 02:33:53,460
However, they just had like a little press.

1828
02:33:53,460 --> 02:33:58,460
They had like a little hour long kind of livestream about World of Warcraft Shadowlands.

1829
02:33:58,460 --> 02:34:07,460
And one of the things that they announced is that they are actually going to be removing the 15 dollar fee to change the gender of your character.

1830
02:34:07,460 --> 02:34:11,460
And they're going to say it's going to be similar basically to like the barbershop.

1831
02:34:11,460 --> 02:34:19,460
If you go in and get the haircut, you know, you can change your gender easily without that money being spent if you want.

1832
02:34:19,460 --> 02:34:25,460
And it seems like part of the reason here, there is an interview that happened with Eurogamer and the executive producer behind Shadowlands,

1833
02:34:25,460 --> 02:34:32,460
John Hight, said that the fee was not sending the right message, but that they also can't fix it through a hot fix.

1834
02:34:32,460 --> 02:34:42,460
And they're also talking a little bit about this new character that's in Shadowlands called Pelagos that many are interpreting as a transgender character in WoW

1835
02:34:42,460 --> 02:34:49,460
because they're saying aspirants are able to choose a physical form that represents their true self.

1836
02:34:49,460 --> 02:34:55,460
Pelagos, who presented as a woman in his mortal life, chose to be a man in the Shadowlands.

1837
02:34:55,460 --> 02:35:01,460
So there's an interesting kind of like parallel there about becoming like your true self and so forth.

1838
02:35:01,460 --> 02:35:06,460
And so maybe they felt, I'm assuming, I'm kind of filling the gaps that maybe if there are some players,

1839
02:35:06,460 --> 02:35:11,460
and let's be real, World of Warcraft has been out for 15 plus years.

1840
02:35:11,460 --> 02:35:17,460
And maybe there's some people out there that with their characters can maybe relate to a situation like Pelagos.

1841
02:35:17,460 --> 02:35:22,460
They don't want to put a $15 fee so that you can change the gender of your character.

1842
02:35:22,460 --> 02:35:29,460
So the rare story about removing a microtransaction. How about that?

1843
02:35:29,460 --> 02:35:31,460
Now I've seen everything.

1844
02:35:31,460 --> 02:35:36,460
Especially from a game that already had a monthly fee. So that's pretty cool.

1845
02:35:36,460 --> 02:35:38,460
I think it's a good step toward being inclusive.

1846
02:35:38,460 --> 02:35:43,460
It is. And it's neat to hear that they have that storyline in Shadowlands.

1847
02:35:43,460 --> 02:35:47,460
And I'm only refraining from talking much more about it because I'm going to be honest,

1848
02:35:47,460 --> 02:35:50,460
I haven't followed World of Warcraft as closely in quite a while.

1849
02:35:50,460 --> 02:35:53,460
So I don't want to like fuck up or misrepresent something.

1850
02:35:53,460 --> 02:35:58,460
But you know, kind of what I'm reading about it, it does sound like they're exploring some themes in the game

1851
02:35:58,460 --> 02:36:04,460
where maybe they've been told they could have explored a long time ago.

1852
02:36:04,460 --> 02:36:06,460
I'm still not going back to WoW.

1853
02:36:06,460 --> 02:36:10,460
I don't see myself visiting it anytime soon.

1854
02:36:10,460 --> 02:36:14,460
But I can still say I'm glad it's happening for the people that are still there.

1855
02:36:14,460 --> 02:36:18,460
Because I know plenty of people that still love and appreciate World of Warcraft.

1856
02:36:18,460 --> 02:36:20,460
And will probably be thrilled that this is there.

1857
02:36:20,460 --> 02:36:22,460
So, yay.

1858
02:36:22,460 --> 02:36:24,460
Alright.

1859
02:36:24,460 --> 02:36:26,460
Moving, yeah.

1860
02:36:26,460 --> 02:36:29,460
Sia Tabiri in chat says $15 is a microtransaction?

1861
02:36:29,460 --> 02:36:31,460
I need a bigger piggy bank. Good point.

1862
02:36:31,460 --> 02:36:33,460
Remember, they're all transactions.

1863
02:36:33,460 --> 02:36:34,460
I know.

1864
02:36:34,460 --> 02:36:36,460
They're all taking money out of your pocket.

1865
02:36:36,460 --> 02:36:39,460
You know what they're, you know what they're really calling it, though.

1866
02:36:39,460 --> 02:36:41,460
Alright, anyhow.

1867
02:36:41,460 --> 02:36:44,460
Let's get into, that was our last scheduled story.

1868
02:36:44,460 --> 02:36:46,460
So this is the listener roundtable.

1869
02:36:46,460 --> 02:36:50,460
If you want to bring up any additional comments or questions that we haven't addressed on the show yet,

1870
02:36:50,460 --> 02:36:54,460
you can bring that up in our chat room here.

1871
02:36:54,460 --> 02:36:57,460
Okay, wow. Hype Mayhem was ready to go with a comment there.

1872
02:36:57,460 --> 02:36:59,460
Let me read through this.

1873
02:36:59,460 --> 02:37:01,460
Excuse me, let me read through this here.

1874
02:37:01,460 --> 02:37:03,460
Ask Loki, of course, and Dark StarCraft.

1875
02:37:03,460 --> 02:37:05,460
They have any last minute stories in a moment.

1876
02:37:05,460 --> 02:37:07,460
But first, Hype Mayhem says,

1877
02:37:07,460 --> 02:37:10,460
This primarily applies to PC gaming more than consoles.

1878
02:37:10,460 --> 02:37:13,460
Since PC gaming is pretty much digital only,

1879
02:37:13,460 --> 02:37:15,460
physical releases have gone the way of the 8-track,

1880
02:37:15,460 --> 02:37:18,460
and games can often get delisted for XYZ reasons,

1881
02:37:18,460 --> 02:37:20,460
I see PC gamers having two options.

1882
02:37:20,460 --> 02:37:23,460
Either buy up any games that look interesting,

1883
02:37:23,460 --> 02:37:26,460
and hedge against the possibility of missing out due to delisting.

1884
02:37:26,460 --> 02:37:28,460
But backlogs get insanely huge.

1885
02:37:28,460 --> 02:37:31,460
Or keep purchasing and backlog is reasonable,

1886
02:37:31,460 --> 02:37:34,460
but run the risk of missing out on buying a game.

1887
02:37:34,460 --> 02:37:39,460
So all that being said, which camp do you folks find yourselves in and why?

1888
02:37:39,460 --> 02:37:42,460
I'm going to invent a new camp.

1889
02:37:42,460 --> 02:37:44,460
Because that's what I do.

1890
02:37:44,460 --> 02:37:48,460
This illustrates, the situation you're describing,

1891
02:37:48,460 --> 02:37:52,460
illustrates the importance of preserving video game history,

1892
02:37:52,460 --> 02:37:56,460
and why we need websites like archive.org

1893
02:37:56,460 --> 02:37:59,460
that are exploring about preserving old video games.

1894
02:37:59,460 --> 02:38:02,460
Because honestly, if you go into their library,

1895
02:38:02,460 --> 02:38:04,460
it's kind of the reverse of what you're talking about.

1896
02:38:04,460 --> 02:38:07,460
It's not necessarily things that were digital and got delisted.

1897
02:38:07,460 --> 02:38:11,460
It were things that were physical that you can no longer find anymore.

1898
02:38:11,460 --> 02:38:13,460
Or that don't really run on current computers,

1899
02:38:13,460 --> 02:38:15,460
because the software has changed.

1900
02:38:15,460 --> 02:38:19,460
So I think that preservation of games is super important.

1901
02:38:19,460 --> 02:38:24,460
And I don't necessarily believe in filling up a gigantic backlog

1902
02:38:24,460 --> 02:38:26,460
that I'll never get through.

1903
02:38:26,460 --> 02:38:29,460
I just want to see that the old games get protected.

1904
02:38:29,460 --> 02:38:32,460
So that way, if I do think of a game 20 years from now

1905
02:38:32,460 --> 02:38:35,460
that I want to show someone else's kid,

1906
02:38:35,460 --> 02:38:36,460
because I'm not going to have my own.

1907
02:38:36,460 --> 02:38:38,460
But if I want to show someone else's kid this game that I used to play,

1908
02:38:38,460 --> 02:38:41,460
I want to know that there will be a place like archive.org

1909
02:38:41,460 --> 02:38:44,460
or something like that, where I can pull up the game

1910
02:38:44,460 --> 02:38:46,460
and show it to somebody.

1911
02:38:46,460 --> 02:38:47,460
You know what I mean?

1912
02:38:47,460 --> 02:38:50,460
So I love archive for the old game stuff.

1913
02:38:51,460 --> 02:38:54,460
Able to pull up old Dr. Brain games on there

1914
02:38:54,460 --> 02:38:58,460
and some of the old edutainment games from the Apple days.

1915
02:38:58,460 --> 02:39:00,460
And it's not just about like,

1916
02:39:00,460 --> 02:39:03,460
oh, I want to play all these games for free.

1917
02:39:03,460 --> 02:39:05,460
It's a nostalgia trip.

1918
02:39:05,460 --> 02:39:07,460
It's remembering things.

1919
02:39:07,460 --> 02:39:11,460
It's the equivalent of looking at an old magazine in a library.

1920
02:39:11,460 --> 02:39:12,460
You know what I mean?

1921
02:39:12,460 --> 02:39:14,460
Like, is the magazine going to go out of business

1922
02:39:14,460 --> 02:39:16,460
because I looked at an old copy in the library?

1923
02:39:16,460 --> 02:39:18,460
I don't know.

1924
02:39:18,460 --> 02:39:20,460
Anyway, so that's my kind of take on it.

1925
02:39:20,460 --> 02:39:22,460
I don't know if you guys have anything to add to that.

1926
02:39:24,460 --> 02:39:29,460
Dark Soccer, you're a big game collector of sorts, I suppose.

1927
02:39:29,460 --> 02:39:34,460
Like, is the concept of digital collection important to you?

1928
02:39:36,460 --> 02:39:40,460
Lately, if there's something that I'm really into,

1929
02:39:40,460 --> 02:39:41,460
I think I would have a physical copy.

1930
02:39:41,460 --> 02:39:44,460
And I would have done that for Animal Crossing.

1931
02:39:44,460 --> 02:39:47,460
But I had pneumonia when it came out.

1932
02:39:47,460 --> 02:39:49,460
I got the digital copy.

1933
02:39:50,460 --> 02:39:57,460
So I'm not, I guess, as much into it as I used to be, I guess.

1934
02:39:57,460 --> 02:40:01,460
You know, just it doesn't seem as important,

1935
02:40:01,460 --> 02:40:07,460
especially now since I'm, I guess, trying to downsize.

1936
02:40:07,460 --> 02:40:09,460
Yeah, I hear that.

1937
02:40:09,460 --> 02:40:10,460
I hear that.

1938
02:40:10,460 --> 02:40:12,460
Well, although, I mean, we're not selling anything.

1939
02:40:12,460 --> 02:40:14,460
And I might downsize a kitty

1940
02:40:14,460 --> 02:40:16,460
if he doesn't shut the hell up over there.

1941
02:40:16,460 --> 02:40:17,460
All right.

1942
02:40:17,460 --> 02:40:19,460
I cannot hear the smooshy.

1943
02:40:19,460 --> 02:40:20,460
Oh, really?

1944
02:40:20,460 --> 02:40:21,460
He's being louder than he usually is.

1945
02:40:21,460 --> 02:40:22,460
All right.

1946
02:40:22,460 --> 02:40:24,460
And I miss picking him up against his will.

1947
02:40:24,460 --> 02:40:26,460
He misses you too, Aunt Jamie.

1948
02:40:26,460 --> 02:40:27,460
All right.

1949
02:40:27,460 --> 02:40:31,460
Anyway, let's see if there's any, if there's any, yeah.

1950
02:40:31,460 --> 02:40:33,460
The chat's like, oh, now I hear smoosh.

1951
02:40:33,460 --> 02:40:34,460
Because earlier, I don't know if you heard of it,

1952
02:40:34,460 --> 02:40:37,460
Stella was in the background at Loki's house making some noise.

1953
02:40:37,460 --> 02:40:39,460
And the chatters could hear that.

1954
02:40:39,460 --> 02:40:40,460
Yeah.

1955
02:40:40,460 --> 02:40:42,460
Minda's fucked off somewhere.

1956
02:40:42,460 --> 02:40:43,460
She's probably sleeping.

1957
02:40:43,460 --> 02:40:45,460
Minda doesn't usually scream on cam though, right?

1958
02:40:45,460 --> 02:40:46,460
I don't, at least I don't remember that.

1959
02:40:46,460 --> 02:40:50,460
No, and she also, she also though has a very melodic meow.

1960
02:40:50,460 --> 02:40:53,460
I like this comment in chat or question.

1961
02:40:53,460 --> 02:40:55,460
Miltonius Games in chat says,

1962
02:40:55,460 --> 02:40:58,460
I've been getting into novels set in video game universes,

1963
02:40:58,460 --> 02:41:00,460
Warcraft, Halo, so forth.

1964
02:41:00,460 --> 02:41:04,460
Have any of you ever gotten into any video game content

1965
02:41:04,460 --> 02:41:07,460
set outside of the video game format,

1966
02:41:07,460 --> 02:41:10,460
shows, comics, et cetera?

1967
02:41:10,460 --> 02:41:12,460
I read a lot of those Warcraft books,

1968
02:41:12,460 --> 02:41:14,460
the World of Warcraft ones that were,

1969
02:41:14,460 --> 02:41:17,460
like I read Thrall and I read the,

1970
02:41:17,460 --> 02:41:22,460
the fuck, what was the, the war with the well

1971
02:41:22,460 --> 02:41:25,460
and fuck, why can't I think of the name?

1972
02:41:25,460 --> 02:41:29,460
With, God, why can't I think Illidan and,

1973
02:41:29,460 --> 02:41:32,460
and his brother and Illidan being stupid.

1974
02:41:32,460 --> 02:41:33,460
I know what you're talking about.

1975
02:41:33,460 --> 02:41:35,460
Is that the lead into cataclysm, right?

1976
02:41:35,460 --> 02:41:39,460
No, this was like the lead into like the whole of everything.

1977
02:41:39,460 --> 02:41:40,460
Oh, okay.

1978
02:41:40,460 --> 02:41:43,460
When all the demons popped up and were stupid.

1979
02:41:43,460 --> 02:41:46,460
And then I read the,

1980
02:41:46,460 --> 02:41:49,460
the book with a holding,

1981
02:41:49,460 --> 02:41:50,460
what's his face on trial.

1982
02:41:50,460 --> 02:41:55,460
And I mostly read it because of Sylvanas,

1983
02:41:57,460 --> 02:41:59,460
you know, meeting back up with her sister

1984
02:41:59,460 --> 02:42:02,460
and talking about trying to kill what's his face.

1985
02:42:02,460 --> 02:42:05,460
Oh, I can't remember his name either because I hated him.

1986
02:42:05,460 --> 02:42:06,460
Everyone hated him during cataclysm.

1987
02:42:06,460 --> 02:42:07,460
Garrosh?

1988
02:42:07,460 --> 02:42:08,460
Yeah, Garrosh.

1989
02:42:08,460 --> 02:42:09,460
Yeah.

1990
02:42:09,460 --> 02:42:11,460
God, my brain is just not like working for names.

1991
02:42:11,460 --> 02:42:12,460
That's okay.

1992
02:42:12,460 --> 02:42:15,460
And I've, I mean, for other things,

1993
02:42:15,460 --> 02:42:17,460
I've read some of the supernatural books.

1994
02:42:17,460 --> 02:42:20,460
I've got some old Doctor Who books from the eighties.

1995
02:42:20,460 --> 02:42:25,460
I've, I mean, gosh, I, I, when I get into a fandom,

1996
02:42:25,460 --> 02:42:27,460
I get into a fandom.

1997
02:42:27,460 --> 02:42:29,460
It's just like reading all those Star Wars books.

1998
02:42:29,460 --> 02:42:31,460
I haven't read any of the older ones,

1999
02:42:31,460 --> 02:42:34,460
but I've read the, some of the newer ones.

2000
02:42:34,460 --> 02:42:38,460
I read the Phasma, Phasma book.

2001
02:42:39,460 --> 02:42:41,460
I've read a few of the others.

2002
02:42:41,460 --> 02:42:43,460
I want to read the Belea book.

2003
02:42:43,460 --> 02:42:45,460
It's on, it's on my list.

2004
02:42:45,460 --> 02:42:46,460
So, yeah.

2005
02:42:46,460 --> 02:42:48,460
I have a couple of answers for this,

2006
02:42:48,460 --> 02:42:50,460
as far as like games and other things.

2007
02:42:50,460 --> 02:42:54,460
When Pokemon first came out, I used to love the anime,

2008
02:42:54,460 --> 02:42:56,460
the original OG anime.

2009
02:42:56,460 --> 02:42:57,460
I loved Pokemon.

2010
02:42:57,460 --> 02:42:58,460
Of course, it was all the dubbed ones

2011
02:42:58,460 --> 02:43:01,460
that we had here in the US, but still, I love that.

2012
02:43:01,460 --> 02:43:03,460
What's that?

2013
02:43:03,460 --> 02:43:05,460
It's a movie in Japanese, remember?

2014
02:43:05,460 --> 02:43:07,460
Oh yeah, yeah, I remember that.

2015
02:43:07,460 --> 02:43:08,460
Yeah, yeah.

2016
02:43:08,460 --> 02:43:13,460
But the other thing was when I was really younger,

2017
02:43:13,460 --> 02:43:16,460
and I don't know if people will remember these.

2018
02:43:16,460 --> 02:43:19,460
Some people will, but they had these books that came out,

2019
02:43:19,460 --> 02:43:21,460
and I could get them at like Walden Books or something,

2020
02:43:21,460 --> 02:43:23,460
but they were the Worlds of Power books

2021
02:43:23,460 --> 02:43:25,460
where they took video games, right?

2022
02:43:25,460 --> 02:43:29,460
FX9, I think was the shadow name.

2023
02:43:29,460 --> 02:43:31,460
That wasn't really the guy that wrote them

2024
02:43:31,460 --> 02:43:32,460
because it's on Wikipedia,

2025
02:43:32,460 --> 02:43:34,460
and it kind of gives the whole story

2026
02:43:34,460 --> 02:43:36,460
that somebody else really wrote them under that name.

2027
02:43:36,460 --> 02:43:39,460
But there were games, or excuse me, books

2028
02:43:39,460 --> 02:43:42,460
based on things like Blaster Master had a book.

2029
02:43:42,460 --> 02:43:44,460
I remember Simon's Quest had a book, which was weird

2030
02:43:44,460 --> 02:43:47,460
because it was like you had an adventurer

2031
02:43:47,460 --> 02:43:48,460
that was with Simon.

2032
02:43:48,460 --> 02:43:51,460
Metal Gear had a decent book from what I remember too.

2033
02:43:51,460 --> 02:43:53,460
They weren't giant books.

2034
02:43:53,460 --> 02:43:55,460
They were young adult books.

2035
02:43:55,460 --> 02:43:58,460
They were made for 12-year-old gamers,

2036
02:43:58,460 --> 02:44:02,460
and they were only like yay thick and about 100 pages,

2037
02:44:02,460 --> 02:44:04,460
so you could get through them pretty quickly.

2038
02:44:04,460 --> 02:44:08,460
But they were good for somebody who at the time

2039
02:44:08,460 --> 02:44:11,460
games were a very like nerd thing and very niche thing.

2040
02:44:11,460 --> 02:44:13,460
It was kind of neat to see them cross over into books

2041
02:44:13,460 --> 02:44:15,460
because you didn't see that a lot.

2042
02:44:15,460 --> 02:44:17,460
Ninja Gaiden had one too.

2043
02:44:17,460 --> 02:44:18,460
I remember that.

2044
02:44:18,460 --> 02:44:19,460
That had a really good book.

2045
02:44:19,460 --> 02:44:21,460
Actually, there's another series of books

2046
02:44:21,460 --> 02:44:24,460
that I actually went out and found translations for.

2047
02:44:24,460 --> 02:44:29,460
One of them was the Silent Hill 2 novelization.

2048
02:44:29,460 --> 02:44:31,460
Oh, I didn't know it had one.

2049
02:44:31,460 --> 02:44:33,460
Which was really freaking good.

2050
02:44:34,460 --> 02:44:36,460
I have a PDF of it.

2051
02:44:36,460 --> 02:44:38,460
And the Catherine books.

2052
02:44:41,460 --> 02:44:44,460
Okay, you guys are lighting up our round table tonight.

2053
02:44:44,460 --> 02:44:45,460
Hold on, I got to cut up all their comments,

2054
02:44:45,460 --> 02:44:46,460
then we'll get to the last minute stories.

2055
02:44:46,460 --> 02:44:50,460
SG100Matt says, dropping this GoFundMe in here

2056
02:44:50,460 --> 02:44:53,460
for saving the New Jersey Arcade 8 on the break,

2057
02:44:53,460 --> 02:44:56,460
which I've been to before, Rob Roberts approved,

2058
02:44:56,460 --> 02:44:58,460
which is having a hard time paying off its taxes

2059
02:44:58,460 --> 02:44:59,460
due to the pandemic.

2060
02:44:59,460 --> 02:45:00,460
I think we all know.

2061
02:45:00,460 --> 02:45:02,460
The break has been around for several decades

2062
02:45:02,460 --> 02:45:04,460
and has become a staple in the music game community.

2063
02:45:04,460 --> 02:45:06,460
Thankfully, it hit its initial goal,

2064
02:45:06,460 --> 02:45:08,460
but the arcade is not reopening anytime soon

2065
02:45:08,460 --> 02:45:10,460
because of the recent surge in cases.

2066
02:45:10,460 --> 02:45:13,460
Any links to the GoFundMe, which is in chat

2067
02:45:13,460 --> 02:45:15,460
for those of you participating live.

2068
02:45:15,460 --> 02:45:16,460
If you're on the podcast feed,

2069
02:45:16,460 --> 02:45:18,460
I'm sure if you just search for GoFundMe

2070
02:45:18,460 --> 02:45:20,460
and on the break, you'll find it.

2071
02:45:20,460 --> 02:45:22,460
But shout out for that.

2072
02:45:22,460 --> 02:45:24,460
I'll link it on my Twitter.

2073
02:45:24,460 --> 02:45:25,460
Thank you.

2074
02:45:25,460 --> 02:45:28,460
Going to a tweet from Pixel Pacas,

2075
02:45:28,460 --> 02:45:31,460
who tweets a saying, I'm sorry, not a tweet,

2076
02:45:31,460 --> 02:45:34,460
a comment in chat, but DarkSakura just mentioned tweeting,

2077
02:45:34,460 --> 02:45:35,460
so I got confused.

2078
02:45:35,460 --> 02:45:37,460
Pixel Pacas says,

2079
02:45:37,460 --> 02:45:40,460
have you folks attended any digital conventions yet?

2080
02:45:40,460 --> 02:45:43,460
I felt like the concept was a bit silly,

2081
02:45:43,460 --> 02:45:45,460
but just got out of FUJO CON,

2082
02:45:45,460 --> 02:45:47,460
which is the YowieCon, basically,

2083
02:45:47,460 --> 02:45:48,460
and it was so fun.

2084
02:45:48,460 --> 02:45:52,460
They had academic panels, games on tabletop simulator,

2085
02:45:52,460 --> 02:45:55,460
and themed fan meetups on Discord.

2086
02:45:55,460 --> 02:45:59,460
Well, Bobby Blackwolf drops the cheap, obvious plug in there

2087
02:45:59,460 --> 02:46:02,460
Vogg showed up at a digital convention this weekend,

2088
02:46:02,460 --> 02:46:05,460
which sadly I mentioned earlier in the show,

2089
02:46:05,460 --> 02:46:08,460
I've had some personal issues.

2090
02:46:08,460 --> 02:46:10,460
I was hoping to contribute a video

2091
02:46:10,460 --> 02:46:12,460
before those personal issues even popped up,

2092
02:46:12,460 --> 02:46:15,460
but making videos is a lot of work.

2093
02:46:15,460 --> 02:46:16,460
Bobby did a very good job on that,

2094
02:46:16,460 --> 02:46:18,460
and I just had some conflicting priorities,

2095
02:46:18,460 --> 02:46:21,460
especially with a lot going on in my day job leading up to that.

2096
02:46:21,460 --> 02:46:23,460
But anyway, I had full on planned to,

2097
02:46:23,460 --> 02:46:25,460
oh, I'm going to be there live when it debuts,

2098
02:46:25,460 --> 02:46:26,460
and I'll participate as well.

2099
02:46:26,460 --> 02:46:28,460
I'm sure Bobby and the rest of you understand

2100
02:46:28,460 --> 02:46:30,460
why I didn't do that,

2101
02:46:30,460 --> 02:46:33,460
but he did post the video early to our Discord

2102
02:46:33,460 --> 02:46:36,460
over at voggnetwork.com slash Discord

2103
02:46:36,460 --> 02:46:41,460
if you're a subscriber here at Vogg Network on Twitch,

2104
02:46:41,460 --> 02:46:43,460
and you have your Discord link to Twitch.

2105
02:46:43,460 --> 02:46:44,460
That's very important.

2106
02:46:44,460 --> 02:46:46,460
If both those things are true,

2107
02:46:46,460 --> 02:46:49,460
then you get access to a super secret subscriber chat.

2108
02:46:49,460 --> 02:46:51,460
We don't fill it up a lot,

2109
02:46:51,460 --> 02:46:54,460
but a couple weeks ago before the new stuff showed up at OLR,

2110
02:46:54,460 --> 02:46:57,460
I posted some sneak peeks of the new stuff at OLR,

2111
02:46:57,460 --> 02:47:00,460
and then Bobby posted his panel early for people to see.

2112
02:47:00,460 --> 02:47:02,460
So technically, Vogg Network was a part of that,

2113
02:47:02,460 --> 02:47:05,460
but because of my personal situations,

2114
02:47:05,460 --> 02:47:07,460
I did not participate with that convention.

2115
02:47:07,460 --> 02:47:11,460
I did a professional convention for work.

2116
02:47:11,460 --> 02:47:13,460
Work paid for me to go to a virtual convention,

2117
02:47:13,460 --> 02:47:18,460
which had a lot of on-demand seminars for the field that I'm in,

2118
02:47:18,460 --> 02:47:20,460
and I thought it was pretty cool.

2119
02:47:20,460 --> 02:47:21,460
Very informative talks.

2120
02:47:21,460 --> 02:47:23,460
There were things you could go to live.

2121
02:47:23,460 --> 02:47:26,460
You could ask questions and interact with the speakers,

2122
02:47:26,460 --> 02:47:29,460
which for my industry was very good for learning and so forth.

2123
02:47:29,460 --> 02:47:31,460
What I also thought was really interesting

2124
02:47:31,460 --> 02:47:36,460
was that they had this section that was like these roundtables,

2125
02:47:36,460 --> 02:47:37,460
and you could sign up and say,

2126
02:47:37,460 --> 02:47:40,460
I want to have a roundtable session on this,

2127
02:47:40,460 --> 02:47:44,460
and then up to five other people could come sit at your table,

2128
02:47:44,460 --> 02:47:47,460
and then it would be like, go to this Zoom chat,

2129
02:47:47,460 --> 02:47:50,460
and now you can have a roundtable chat on this particular thing.

2130
02:47:50,460 --> 02:47:52,460
And I thought that was really cool,

2131
02:47:52,460 --> 02:47:54,460
because this company that was putting it on,

2132
02:47:54,460 --> 02:47:57,460
I think has done virtual shows before, and it shows,

2133
02:47:57,460 --> 02:47:59,460
because they had a lot of interesting ideas like that.

2134
02:47:59,460 --> 02:48:01,460
So I thought that was pretty cool.

2135
02:48:01,460 --> 02:48:04,460
I full-on plan on doing DragonCon virtually,

2136
02:48:04,460 --> 02:48:06,460
because I'm sure as many of you know,

2137
02:48:06,460 --> 02:48:09,460
DragonCon was officially canceled this week,

2138
02:48:09,460 --> 02:48:14,460
which is sad, but at the same time is necessary.

2139
02:48:14,460 --> 02:48:18,460
So I'm sad to see it not happen, but I think it's pretty cool.

2140
02:48:18,460 --> 02:48:19,460
They're going to be doing a virtual one,

2141
02:48:19,460 --> 02:48:21,460
and I full-on intend to participate.

2142
02:48:21,460 --> 02:48:25,460
I hope I'll be asked to participate as a panelist on one of the tracks,

2143
02:48:25,460 --> 02:48:28,460
but I realize they're going to have a limited amount of space.

2144
02:48:28,460 --> 02:48:32,460
It's not going to be as flowing as the convention itself is,

2145
02:48:32,460 --> 02:48:36,460
so I'll be happy just to participate with that whole thing.

2146
02:48:36,460 --> 02:48:39,460
So, yeah.

2147
02:48:39,460 --> 02:48:42,460
SheHulk10 is pointing out KaijuCon going on right now,

2148
02:48:42,460 --> 02:48:44,460
heading there after the show.

2149
02:48:44,460 --> 02:48:48,460
Bobby linked his panel there.

2150
02:48:48,460 --> 02:48:51,460
Let's see. Oh, yeah, it's available to all.

2151
02:48:51,460 --> 02:48:54,460
Bobby says, yeah, I don't like doing pre-recorded material.

2152
02:48:54,460 --> 02:49:01,460
I have been wanting to for a while get into more video-on-demand type of stuff,

2153
02:49:01,460 --> 02:49:04,460
but obviously it's kind of getting over the mountain of,

2154
02:49:04,460 --> 02:49:06,460
I don't have the time.

2155
02:49:06,460 --> 02:49:08,460
I'm really trying to make time,

2156
02:49:08,460 --> 02:49:10,460
but obviously some of these scenarios that keep coming up

2157
02:49:10,460 --> 02:49:14,460
are pushing me back a little bit.

2158
02:49:14,460 --> 02:49:17,460
But I'm going to try and do a little more of that type of stuff,

2159
02:49:17,460 --> 02:49:19,460
so we'll see.

2160
02:49:19,460 --> 02:49:21,460
That video he did was almost an hour.

2161
02:49:21,460 --> 02:49:22,460
That's a lot of content.

2162
02:49:22,460 --> 02:49:24,460
That's very, very good.

2163
02:49:24,460 --> 02:49:26,460
All right.

2164
02:49:26,460 --> 02:49:28,460
Anyhow, let's get into some last-minute stories.

2165
02:49:28,460 --> 02:49:30,460
Loki, I don't know if you have anything for us here.

2166
02:49:30,460 --> 02:49:31,460
I have one.

2167
02:49:31,460 --> 02:49:32,460
Oh, do you?

2168
02:49:32,460 --> 02:49:33,460
Then why not Dark Soccer first?

2169
02:49:33,460 --> 02:49:34,460
Go ahead.

2170
02:49:34,460 --> 02:49:35,460
Okay.

2171
02:49:35,460 --> 02:49:38,460
This looks like something that was more recently related.

2172
02:49:38,460 --> 02:49:40,460
I actually just found the article on this one.

2173
02:49:40,460 --> 02:49:45,460
Sony has a patent now hinting to cloud-based backwards compatibility.

2174
02:49:45,460 --> 02:49:47,460
I don't know if that's old news or what,

2175
02:49:47,460 --> 02:49:51,460
but I'm looking at these patent drawings, and it's pretty interesting.

2176
02:49:51,460 --> 02:49:55,460
No, but I'd heard this rumor that that's how they were going to do it,

2177
02:49:55,460 --> 02:49:59,460
so this patent just seems to kind of light up that rumor a little more.

2178
02:49:59,460 --> 02:50:05,460
Yeah, and the patent appeared on Japan's platform for patent information website.

2179
02:50:05,460 --> 02:50:09,460
It was filed on July 2nd, and of course it is in Japanese,

2180
02:50:09,460 --> 02:50:13,460
but there is a comment on it translated.

2181
02:50:13,460 --> 02:50:17,460
Another trend growing in this industry relates to the development of cloud-based gaming systems.

2182
02:50:17,460 --> 02:50:20,460
Such a system may include a remote processing server

2183
02:50:20,460 --> 02:50:24,460
that is configured to execute a game application, receive input from a user,

2184
02:50:24,460 --> 02:50:29,460
and communicate with a local thin client configured to display an image on a display,

2185
02:50:29,460 --> 02:50:36,460
meaning that it's got an illustration of a user climbing a step

2186
02:50:36,460 --> 02:50:40,460
to get to a different type of gaming system.

2187
02:50:40,460 --> 02:50:49,460
The illustration they have on here shows a PS3, because it looks like a Foreman grill.

2188
02:50:49,460 --> 02:50:54,460
And so in another image, it's basically showing the various input selects

2189
02:50:54,460 --> 02:50:57,460
with all the models of PlayStation going back to the first one,

2190
02:50:57,460 --> 02:51:02,460
and then going on to another readout for the display

2191
02:51:02,460 --> 02:51:05,460
where you can pick the games pertaining to that particular system.

2192
02:51:06,460 --> 02:51:16,460
And there's also, of course, a little blank box on there where the PS4 would go.

2193
02:51:16,460 --> 02:51:22,460
And so it's sort of hinting that this is going to be

2194
02:51:22,460 --> 02:51:26,460
since the fact that PS5 will support the top 100 PS4 games,

2195
02:51:26,460 --> 02:51:31,460
and that all of the new PS4 games after July are certified to be PS5 compatible.

2196
02:51:32,460 --> 02:51:36,460
So that could be a thing.

2197
02:51:36,460 --> 02:51:41,460
That part, I know, had been discussed before about the whole games after a certain point.

2198
02:51:41,460 --> 02:51:48,460
That's making me think that that's why there's no icon.

2199
02:51:48,460 --> 02:51:53,460
I mean, it's literally like a cutout square with little dashes around it

2200
02:51:53,460 --> 02:51:56,460
that don't show anything for PS4.

2201
02:51:56,460 --> 02:52:02,460
So I guess that's maybe a placeholder for working on backwards compatibility

2202
02:52:02,460 --> 02:52:05,460
for some of the earlier PS4 games, who knows?

2203
02:52:05,460 --> 02:52:10,460
By the way, and I don't know if this is something Loki had planned for Last Minute Stories, sorry,

2204
02:52:10,460 --> 02:52:15,460
but on a tangent, we didn't talk about it this week,

2205
02:52:15,460 --> 02:52:20,460
but the PlayStation 5 box art was released, like what the games are going to look like.

2206
02:52:20,460 --> 02:52:22,460
It looks like a game.

2207
02:52:22,460 --> 02:52:27,460
It's the PlayStation 4 box in new colors, which, you know,

2208
02:52:27,460 --> 02:52:29,460
I know there's a lot of negativity on the internet about that,

2209
02:52:29,460 --> 02:52:34,460
but I'm like, honestly, the PlayStation 4 box was the PlayStation 3 box in different colors.

2210
02:52:34,460 --> 02:52:36,460
So it's not...

2211
02:52:36,460 --> 02:52:40,460
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

2212
02:52:40,460 --> 02:52:45,460
The PlayStation 3 ones are black, the PlayStation 4 ones are blue,

2213
02:52:45,460 --> 02:52:47,460
and now the PlayStation 5 ones will be white.

2214
02:52:47,460 --> 02:52:50,460
And you will be able to see them when they're sitting on the shelf.

2215
02:52:50,460 --> 02:52:52,460
And fine, great.

2216
02:52:52,460 --> 02:53:00,460
For those who are in chat, I'm actually linking a picture of that menu translation,

2217
02:53:00,460 --> 02:53:04,460
so I thought it was really interesting.

2218
02:53:04,460 --> 02:53:06,460
It's out there.

2219
02:53:06,460 --> 02:53:15,460
If people want to find the information, you'll just want to go to look up the Japanese patent website,

2220
02:53:15,460 --> 02:53:17,460
and it'll be on there.

2221
02:53:17,460 --> 02:53:18,460
All right.

2222
02:53:18,460 --> 02:53:20,460
Well, if that's it for Dark Sakura...

2223
02:53:20,460 --> 02:53:22,460
I have another.

2224
02:53:22,460 --> 02:53:24,460
Oh, wow. Go for it.

2225
02:53:24,460 --> 02:53:29,460
Sony is delaying the Monster Hunter movie until 2021.

2226
02:53:29,460 --> 02:53:31,460
Sorry, 2021.

2227
02:53:31,460 --> 02:53:33,460
I forgot that it's even coming out.

2228
02:53:33,460 --> 02:53:37,460
Yeah, it's set to release April 23rd, 2021,

2229
02:53:37,460 --> 02:53:44,460
and it's going to have some Resident Evil people in it, like Mila.

2230
02:53:44,460 --> 02:53:46,460
Because same director.

2231
02:53:46,460 --> 02:53:47,460
Yeah.

2232
02:53:47,460 --> 02:53:52,460
And she's kind of pissed about them trying to reboot Resident Evil, just saying.

2233
02:53:52,460 --> 02:53:56,460
Probably because she wasn't asked to be in it, and that's always a little bit...

2234
02:53:56,460 --> 02:53:57,460
Probably.

2235
02:53:57,460 --> 02:53:58,460
Yeah.

2236
02:53:58,460 --> 02:54:03,460
It kind of stings when you are not asked to be in the reboot of something, but sometimes...

2237
02:54:03,460 --> 02:54:05,460
Maybe it'll be more like the games.

2238
02:54:05,460 --> 02:54:06,460
You know what, though?

2239
02:54:06,460 --> 02:54:08,460
But you look at the reboot they're doing for Candyman,

2240
02:54:08,460 --> 02:54:10,460
and obviously all we've seen is that trailer.

2241
02:54:10,460 --> 02:54:14,460
The movie should have been out by now, and I'm not big on how I feel about horror movies,

2242
02:54:14,460 --> 02:54:16,460
but Candyman's kind of cool, and I do love the fact...

2243
02:54:16,460 --> 02:54:18,460
Yeah, that looks so badass.

2244
02:54:18,460 --> 02:54:24,460
The new one has the guy that used to play Candyman in it, still.

2245
02:54:24,460 --> 02:54:26,460
I think that Tony Todd, right?

2246
02:54:26,460 --> 02:54:27,460
Yeah, I think that's awesome.

2247
02:54:27,460 --> 02:54:29,460
I think that's awesome, too.

2248
02:54:29,460 --> 02:54:32,460
And isn't it produced by Jordan Peele?

2249
02:54:32,460 --> 02:54:35,460
I think he's a producer, yeah, but I don't think he wrote it or anything.

2250
02:54:35,460 --> 02:54:37,460
But yeah, he's a producer.

2251
02:54:37,460 --> 02:54:40,460
But yeah, if he's going to put his money behind it, it's got to have some quality.

2252
02:54:40,460 --> 02:54:43,460
True, true. And the trailer was great.

2253
02:54:43,460 --> 02:54:46,460
Oh, yeah. I will do that.

2254
02:54:46,460 --> 02:54:52,460
I'm trying to think of other things where the talent was or was not asked to be a part of it.

2255
02:54:52,460 --> 02:54:57,460
Somebody was just commenting on it recently that they were kind of hurt, that they weren't asked to be in it,

2256
02:54:57,460 --> 02:54:59,460
but they were glad to see that it was still going.

2257
02:54:59,460 --> 02:55:01,460
I can't remember what it was.

2258
02:55:01,460 --> 02:55:07,460
Sorry, I know that makes for a terrible story, but there's things like that that come up once in a while.

2259
02:55:07,460 --> 02:55:09,460
That's it for me.

2260
02:55:09,460 --> 02:55:15,460
DJ Rama S talking about the Resident Evil saying the reboot is supposed to be a lot closer to the games.

2261
02:55:15,460 --> 02:55:18,460
And I think Silent Hill, they were talking about possibly doing that, too,

2262
02:55:18,460 --> 02:55:21,460
but I think that's really, really rumor, great assault type of thing.

2263
02:55:21,460 --> 02:55:25,460
All right. Well, I don't think Loki had any last minute stories if I heard them right,

2264
02:55:25,460 --> 02:55:29,460
so I think we're about the time to wrap up the show.

2265
02:55:29,460 --> 02:55:34,460
Thank you guys so much for participating with our show tonight and listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2266
02:55:34,460 --> 02:55:36,460
Whether you were here live or on our podcast feed,

2267
02:55:36,460 --> 02:55:40,460
we really appreciate you guys sitting down with us every week and spending, you know,

2268
02:55:40,460 --> 02:55:44,460
if you've gotten this far in the show, that means you've made it close to three hours with us.

2269
02:55:44,460 --> 02:55:50,460
So I hope we made your day go by a little faster, whether you're working at home or out exercising outdoors

2270
02:55:50,460 --> 02:55:55,460
or maybe in the workplace taking precautions because I know not everybody can work from home right now.

2271
02:55:55,460 --> 02:55:58,460
I hope we're making your day go by a little bit quicker.

2272
02:55:58,460 --> 02:56:00,460
And thank you so much for making us a part of your week.

2273
02:56:00,460 --> 02:56:02,460
Really, really appreciate it.

2274
02:56:02,460 --> 02:56:04,460
We'll be back in seven days to do it all again.

2275
02:56:04,460 --> 02:56:08,460
Obviously, we've been getting kind of the trickle of announcements that would have been at E3.

2276
02:56:08,460 --> 02:56:10,460
We're kind of getting that trickle through the coming weeks.

2277
02:56:10,460 --> 02:56:13,460
And in a couple of weeks, we're going to get a lot of news about the Xbox.

2278
02:56:13,460 --> 02:56:17,460
So that's going to be very, very exciting.

2279
02:56:17,460 --> 02:56:20,460
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend.

2280
02:56:20,460 --> 02:56:23,460
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2281
02:56:23,460 --> 02:56:28,460
But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, yikes, then we don't have anything.

2282
02:56:28,460 --> 02:56:32,460
So a nice five-star review wherever you found this show, like iTunes,

2283
02:56:32,460 --> 02:56:36,460
or just recommending us by sharing a link to our page on Spotify or what have you,

2284
02:56:36,460 --> 02:56:38,460
that goes an awful long way.

2285
02:56:38,460 --> 02:56:41,460
So thank you, thank you so much to everybody that helps us spread the word.

2286
02:56:41,460 --> 02:56:44,460
With that, it's time to get into final thoughts.

2287
02:56:44,460 --> 02:56:46,460
I'll start tonight.

2288
02:56:46,460 --> 02:56:53,460
My final thought is I'm going to play more of that cross code or the game whose name I can't remember,

2289
02:56:53,460 --> 02:56:57,460
but it's a good game and it's a good throwback to Super Nintendo stuff.

2290
02:56:57,460 --> 02:56:59,460
So I'm going to play some more of that this week.

2291
02:56:59,460 --> 02:57:05,460
And I'm going to play Elliot's Jam Game and probably lots of other stuff this week too.

2292
02:57:05,460 --> 02:57:10,460
As much as quarantine sucks and I miss interacting with real people,

2293
02:57:10,460 --> 02:57:16,460
I miss my weekend trips to San Francisco, I miss my nights out downtown,

2294
02:57:16,460 --> 02:57:19,460
it's given me a chance to play a lot of video games.

2295
02:57:19,460 --> 02:57:21,460
So I'll be doing that.

2296
02:57:21,460 --> 02:57:23,460
Loki, how about you?

2297
02:57:23,460 --> 02:57:30,460
Well, it's just going to be working this week and maybe I'll get some game dev time in there as well.

2298
02:57:30,460 --> 02:57:31,460
We'll see.

2299
02:57:31,460 --> 02:57:36,460
And last but certainly not least, here for the whole show tonight, Dark Soccer, your final thought.

2300
02:57:38,460 --> 02:57:40,460
Your unmuted final thought, please.

2301
02:57:40,460 --> 02:57:41,460
Sorry.

2302
02:57:41,460 --> 02:57:42,460
It's okay.

2303
02:57:42,460 --> 02:57:46,460
Eight weeks total and I'm not going to be doing this again anytime soon because it's hot.

2304
02:57:47,460 --> 02:57:51,460
And I have been sitting here smelling the pizza that Dan ordered that arrived

2305
02:57:51,460 --> 02:57:54,460
right after the start of the show, and I have not eaten any of it.

2306
02:57:54,460 --> 02:57:56,460
Girl, just turn your cam off and go to town.

2307
02:57:56,460 --> 02:57:58,460
No, I'm a professional bitch.

2308
02:57:58,460 --> 02:57:59,460
I appreciate it.

2309
02:57:59,460 --> 02:58:00,460
We know.

2310
02:58:00,460 --> 02:58:01,460
Let me mean it.

2311
02:58:01,460 --> 02:58:04,460
No, I'm going to.

2312
02:58:04,460 --> 02:58:05,460
Oh, okay.

2313
02:58:05,460 --> 02:58:09,460
So what is the average airspeed of an unladen swallow?

2314
02:58:09,460 --> 02:58:12,460
And Brad from Pod Culture beat me to it.

2315
02:58:12,460 --> 02:58:15,460
African or European.

2316
02:58:15,460 --> 02:58:16,460
All right.

2317
02:58:16,460 --> 02:58:17,460
Anything else?

2318
02:58:17,460 --> 02:58:20,460
All right.

2319
02:58:20,460 --> 02:58:22,460
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2320
02:58:22,460 --> 02:58:23,460
Happy gaming this week.

2321
02:58:23,460 --> 02:58:26,460
We will see you in seven days when we do this all again.

2322
02:58:26,460 --> 02:58:29,460
Thanks again for being part of the family here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2323
02:58:29,460 --> 02:58:30,460
We appreciate you guys so much.

2324
02:58:30,460 --> 02:58:33,460
And all these wigs are just for you.

2325
02:58:33,460 --> 02:58:34,460
Good night, everybody.

2326
02:58:34,460 --> 02:58:38,460
And trust me, I got another 20 I hadn't pulled out yet.

2327
02:58:38,460 --> 02:58:40,460
Something to tune in for next week.

2328
02:58:40,460 --> 02:58:41,460
Bye, guys.

2329
02:58:41,460 --> 02:58:42,460
No.
