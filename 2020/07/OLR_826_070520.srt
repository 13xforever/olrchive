1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,840
Every year has their revivals, revisits, and reflections on the past, but it's always

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,760
interesting when over a generation later we see applied knowledge taking over the past.

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,960
In the seemingly final state of the PlayStation 2, we now have in our hands a hardware hackless

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,080
means for taking over the entire console. Any dubious means aside, this is great for

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,320
preservation and flexibility of now sunset consoles. Gaming companies may be changing

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,680
up their strategies, but we're still able to bring you your hosts Rob Roberts,

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,120
Jamie Summers, and Loki on the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:02,880
The 4th of July, making it July 5th, of course. My name Rob Roberts, joining you here in studio.

9
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,600
Not joining us tonight, unfortunately, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. She has the night off to take

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,400
care of some personal business, but joining me thanks to the magic of Discord while we continue

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,200
to socially distance for over 120 days now. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

12
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,280
Hey, how's it going?

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,800
Hey, I'm doing okay. How are you doing, Loki?

14
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,480
I'm doing pretty good.

15
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,000
It's good to talk to you as always. How was your week personally before we get into games?

16
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,880
Um, it was uneventful, really.

17
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,380
Yeah.

18
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,520
Yeah. Stand inside.

19
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,840
Did you do anything for like the 4th or, I don't know, Canada Day or anything?

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,840
We weren't planning on it. And then we ended up doing,

21
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,560
going or trying to go to get some fireworks. And so we managed to hit up one of the booths

22
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,440
that had just like a very few left. I mean, they were sold out in a lot of places because

23
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,080
it's 8 o'clock at night on the 4th of July. So we managed to get some small stuff and then

24
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,640
the neighbors were setting them off. So we just kind of combined ours with theirs and just watched

25
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,920
them set some stuff up.

26
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,600
Gotcha. Now I'm kind of like over the explosions. It was fun when I was a kid, but I'm kind of like,

27
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,520
so I get it when you do it for your kids, but for me, I'm kind of over it at this point.

28
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:21,200
And I'm just like, I was just hiding in the house and, yeah, trying to keep the cat protected away

29
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,480
from all the noise. And it was, it was, yeah, something. So I'm glad it's over. Let's be real.

30
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,080
Yeah. Go ahead.

31
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,680
Well, assuming it's over, I mean, because, you know, everyone still has stuff left over.

32
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,600
It seems like everybody, since they have it, have to have been social distancing for a while.

33
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,120
And so they haven't been spending the money going out and stuff. So they dropped all that

34
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,640
money into fireworks, it seems like.

35
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,280
Oh yeah. That's actually probably a really good point is that you have a lot of people that are

36
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,480
probably saving money because they're not doing as much as they used to do. And yeah. And now

37
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,280
it's like they spend them on like dumb things like me buying an arcade cabinet this week. But

38
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,880
we'll come back to that later. Some of the chatters, Loki, are noticing your shirt. It's,

39
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,320
and for those on the podcast feed, they can't see the visuals. Although if you want to join us for

40
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,360
the visuals, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,440
VOG Network, VOG Network. Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern,

42
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,320
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. Or if you subscribe to our Twitch channel at VOG Network,

43
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,600
you can watch the video on demand at any time. But of course our audio podcast is free as it has been

44
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,520
for years and years and years. But one of our listeners here in chat, Pod Culture, is saying,

45
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,080
I'm sorry, it was Fifth Dream, same chat caller. Fifth Dream says, I spot a prince of all cosmos

46
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,400
on your t-shirt. And it is, you've got like a yellow and black shirt on, which isn't very

47
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,200
Katamari colors. What is, what is this? Just a Katamari shirt?

48
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,800
Yeah, it's actually, it's an official shirt from it. I had a, my, uh, coworker was cleaning out his

49
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:57,280
closet and he had some shirts that he hadn't worn. Um, and so he's all, he, he recognized that I,

50
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,880
I know what these games are. So I, I have one Katamari shirt and then I've got two Novi Novi

51
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,240
boy shirts. Oh, nice. And I guess they were from the actual developers or something like that. I,

52
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,400
I don't remember where he said he got them, but he says like, I haven't worn them ever. So here

53
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,960
you go. I'm like, cool. Hey, free shirts. Love it. All right. Uh, let's talk a little bit about,

54
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,640
uh, what's going on in the news. We'll get into tonight's kickoff topic. So, uh, why don't you

55
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:29,440
start us off, Loki? All right. So this is pretty cool. I've been like asking for this for, well,

56
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:36,480
since 2006. I mean, we've all been asking for it since 2006. Yes. So every year I always ask,

57
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,480
I'm like, when are they going to do something like they did with 2006, where they have,

58
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,920
you know, demos, it's like bringing E3 home. I think we talked about that literally last week

59
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,200
or like two weeks ago. I think that was under discussion with just last week. Yeah. So, so

60
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,240
that's finally going to happen again. So now since E3 isn't really happening and the whole Xbox thing

61
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,280
and everybody's gotta be, you know, distant and doing all the digital stuff, they've announced

62
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,840
that they're going to be doing this, uh, digital, uh, summer games Fest event starting July 21st.

63
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,400
And I think it's going to run for a week or so. So they're going to have it set up to,

64
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,640
they have over 60 demos. You can try a home. Now I'm guessing that a lot of these are probably

65
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,760
going to be indie games, but there's going to be quite a few demos that you can check out on the

66
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,040
Xbox one. If you have one of those, although kind of wish kind of wish I had one, but I don't know,

67
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,280
just to check out demos, maybe not the best idea, but, uh, pretty cool to see that they're doing

68
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,200
something like that. And with such large numbers, um, I'm hoping that some of this spills over onto

69
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,880
PC because I'd love to check out a PC demo of some of those Xbox games or Microsoft games.

70
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,160
Um, but we'll have to see right now. It's just, uh, specifically Xbox, but, um,

71
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:00,480
yeah, I I'm very excited to see this. They didn't really state which games yet. They did mention

72
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:07,360
though, um, uh, Chris tales and, uh, they're going to have destroy all humans, which I think is the

73
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:14,400
remake of that. And skate bird, uh, was another one, which that was just, um, out on the, uh,

74
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:21,440
steam indie showcase that they did. And then, um, the welcome to elk and hell point. So.

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,240
So I, I imagine there's going to be several games that we don't know about yet

76
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,720
that Microsoft plans to unveil at the, um, you know, event that they're going to be doing in

77
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,520
July, which I think we are starting to narrow down the timeframe of when that's going to be happening.

78
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,960
Um, I'm sorry, I might've missed this. Do we know if they're using the cloud gaming to deliver this,

79
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,880
or is this something where you're going to have to download demos of a significant size to be able

80
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,520
to play them or are they doing, are we going to see the cloud stuff get invoked? It does not say

81
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,040
that they're doing the cloud stuff. It just says that it's going to be, um, unlike normal demos

82
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,200
that you would see on there. A lot of these are gonna be very early. Um, so it's basically kind

83
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,200
of like show floor demos that they would have had, uh, which I think is kind of how they did it in

84
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:09,120
2006. It doesn't really necessarily say that they're going to be using like games pass or

85
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,280
the cloud streaming or anything like that to do this. I guess we'll find out a little bit more

86
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,440
once I think rolls around July 21st. The only thing that's like kind of a bummer with so many

87
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,520
and having to download them all is that of course, this would be the same month that certain large,

88
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,360
uh, internet providers like Comcast, I'm looking at you have decided after they were the good guys

89
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:38,000
for disabling the bandwidth meters for so long. This is going to, because of COVID that, um,

90
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,600
somehow COVID just went away, even though it's actually worse than it's ever been. Um,

91
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:49,040
so Comcast has decided to re-enable those bandwidth caps, um, for whatever reason,

92
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,160
even after showing that for several months, uh, that data caps are just there, they're invented,

93
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,240
they're made up. Um, now granted, I noticed that mine came back in July. If you have Comcast, you

94
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,800
have a bandwidth cap again, too. I noticed my bandwidth cap got higher. It went to a weird,

95
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:12,720
like, instead of like 1024 megabyte or yeah, no 1024 gigabytes or whatever, right. A terabyte.

96
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,640
I noticed that it's like 1226 or something a little, it's kind of like a higher number

97
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:25,360
for whatever reason, but still, um, 60 demos, that's going to be a lot of traffic. Now on the

98
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,520
flip side, if this are all going to be cloud delivered, then you start to run into some of

99
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,000
the issues that people are having with Stadia, right? Which is how much bandwidth is that going

100
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,640
to eat up if I'm doing, you know, 4k gaming for a significant amount of time, but the bandwidth

101
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,000
isn't too bad for 1080p. I noticed that when I was playing Stadia on my PC a few months ago.

102
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,600
So I would assume that since these are demos, it's going to be the file size is going to be

103
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:54,240
much smaller. Um, so I would assume that it shouldn't be too bad. And, and probably out

104
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,080
of the 60 plus games that they're going to have, I'm assuming that you're not going to want to play

105
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,080
it necessarily everything. Uh, Questbuster in chat says Comcast COVID has somehow disappeared,

106
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,520
activate data caps, confused worker, but COVID is worse now than Comcast. Your lack of faith

107
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,600
is disturbing. I actually imagine the conversation went just like that. I think you're correct.

108
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,120
Bobby Blackwell says, good news. They up me to 1.2 terabytes. So I, that Bobby is experiencing

109
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:26,880
the same thing that I, I did. So woo. Now how generous of them. Yeah, I know. Uh, now to be

110
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:34,560
fair, I looked at how much we use last month and we used maybe 690 gigs last month, which is about

111
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:41,040
half that. Um, which is interesting though, because that's way higher than we've ever been

112
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,400
before. I mean, we were maybe at like four 50 besides the one month, my Xbox went crazy and

113
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,000
like downloaded the same thing over and over. And I went way over the cap. Usually I've been

114
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,560
around like four 50 maybe, but Alan and I both work from home now and I do a lot of multimedia

115
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,520
work. So I'm oftentimes sending big files back and forth. I have to do that for work.

116
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:07,200
So I can see why we went up all of a sudden another 200 gigabytes. Um, but I can't exactly

117
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,080
spend, you know, a ton of ton of gigs downloading a bunch of demos. So I'm going to have to like

118
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:17,440
cherry pick the stuff I want to play. I mean, I guess my, my Xbox only holds a terabyte anyway,

119
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,440
and there's some things I'm not looking to delete anytime soon, but it is, it is kind of an

120
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,040
interesting little downside to, you know, because like in 2006, when we talked about the Xbox,

121
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,840
um, three 60 demos, not only were those smaller for sure, but, uh, also there was only like,

122
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:41,680
what, like four of them. And there was like a lost planet. It was lost planet, uh, dead rising,

123
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:50,000
I think. And, um, Moto GP six, it was all Capcom games, which, you know, which, you know, not to,

124
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,720
but the numbers gone way up. So there's going to be way more to pick from. And you know,

125
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,360
there's going to be some people that want to play every single one of them, you know, and, and due

126
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,880
to the world situation have time to do so. Yeah. And I don't know, we'll, we'll have to see how

127
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,680
it is. I wish, I mean, I hope they're not like time exclusive demos. Like, I hope it's like,

128
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,280
you have a certain window to download them, but then you can play them for like a long time.

129
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,800
Cause I remember that's what they did with like the original saints row is they had it, you know,

130
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,520
you can play it for awhile. And like, I played that demo like a bunch of times,

131
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:29,440
I think until the game came out. Cause it was a 30 minute demo. My still, one of my still favorite

132
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,160
E3 memories to this day was when the Nintendo DS was somewhat new. It was like the first year

133
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,400
everybody had them. And they had those demo stations where you could download a demo to your

134
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:44,160
DS. And, uh, a friend of mine at the time that went with me and I both downloaded the luminous

135
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,720
demo that was on a 3DS or was it? No, I'm sorry. It was the creators. No, the creators of luminous

136
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,520
did a different game. Um, that was the, Oh my God. Why can't I remember the moment? Meteos

137
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,800
was the name of it. Yeah. Meteos. So Meteos was the demo and I remember we dealt with it

138
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,240
and he played it the entire car ride home. And we, we, we, we brought it home. We didn't like,

139
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,200
we didn't turn off our DSs the entire, like we would charge them, keep them on charger at night.

140
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,000
It made the trip home somehow. Cause we kept the lid closed, charged him again. And we were showing

141
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,120
it to friends back home here. Like, Hey, look, here's the Meteos demo on DS cause we haven't

142
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:28,720
shut off our 3DS or our DS, excuse me, in like a week. But that was awesome. I loved that. I

143
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,960
missed the, I, that was one of my favorite years. Yeah. I literally brought a piece of E3 home with

144
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:41,600
me and I have, I pay in the power bill for it. So, um, VidPower 573 says these data caps caused

145
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,600
me to refrain from trying out demos for all these new giant full size or excuse me, giant file size

146
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,600
games. Let me ask this question for those of you that feel the way that VidPower does. Cause I see

147
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,400
some of you guys in chat are like, well, LOL, I don't have bandwidth caps to which I say,

148
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:03,040
hmm, how nice for you. Hmm. But the rest of us have to deal with bandwidth. No,

149
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,800
let look lucky you, but you know, you're lucky. So the rest of us that are dealing with bandwidth

150
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:13,440
caps, let me ask this question. Would you rather that they put out the demos where it's a file size

151
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,400
and you download whatever, or would you like a cloud based solution where maybe you have the

152
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:25,520
power to play a demo in 10 ADP versus 4k, you know, and you have some sort of power over using

153
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,960
cloud gaming solution. So I asked that to VidPower and everybody else in that situation in chat.

154
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,200
What would you, we still don't know how they're going to deliver them. We just assumed that it's

155
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:42,400
downloadable demos. Um, maybe it would be like, I could see the argument of doing the cloud based

156
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:48,480
solution because in that way you can't have people data mining your stuff because I could see that

157
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:55,120
happening quite a bit. Um, I don't know. That's a really good point. That's a really good point

158
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,560
is that they got to be careful what they put in these demos because data miners love to mine. I

159
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,880
mean, look at what happened with the Pokemon DLC, right? Like everybody already knows what's

160
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,920
happening with the next DLC because for whatever reason it was in the data files for this deals.

161
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,120
Well, I shouldn't say that like they did a dumb thing because it probably, they probably have to

162
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,320
do that to set up the infrastructure for both DLC to run. So for whatever the reason, everybody

163
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,320
data or people data mined it. Now everybody knows what Pokemon are going to be in the next

164
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,440
DLC as well. So you're right. Data miners will go crazy if given the opportunity to do so. And

165
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:36,880
cloud streaming, you will get around that completely. Yeah, it would, or at least I

166
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,760
would think it would be harder to do that if they could. Yeah. Uh, the power of five,

167
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,640
seven, three and chat says I would be in favor of cloud streaming for demos and full downloading

168
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:53,120
for games that I buy. I love that as an option and I really hope that is a place that Microsoft

169
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,680
is considering going. Like if they're really going to get this thing right, like I would love

170
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,440
the download it and play, or, you know, maybe you're on the go on your phone or just for

171
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,160
whatever reason, for bandwidth reasons, use one stream or a demo or what have you. I would love

172
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,840
options. Do they still have that option with, I know Sony was doing it for a while where they

173
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:19,280
would have these games that they'd put out as like a, it's not even really a trial. It was a full game

174
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:25,920
trial where you get an hour or two to play the game and try it out. And if you wanted to play

175
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,200
more, you could just purchase the game and then play from there. Otherwise, you know, you could

176
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,000
just check out like a section of the game. I don't know if Microsoft's done that. Somebody in chat

177
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,920
would have to help me out with that. Um, PlayStation's also unique though, that it has that

178
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,160
whole share play thing. So like, if you just want to try it for, and people kind of forget it's

179
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,160
there, but it's a great feature. If you just want to try a friend's game, that is also a cloud-based

180
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,200
solution, essentially. Uh, it's, it's different, but you're essentially streaming a video game that

181
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,360
you can try yourself. And I think that's how I played Bloodborne for the first time was through

182
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:04,000
share play. Um, so that's an option. Um, but as far as the time things, I always associate that

183
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,080
with Steam because Steam does those free game weekends all the time. Like they just had DJ Max

184
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,240
not that long ago. It was like a free game weekend and they do that kind of stuff all the time. I

185
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,200
don't know if Microsoft's done it. Somebody in chat would have to help me out. Yeah, it was a little bit different than

186
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,640
those free game weekends. Cause I know they still do those. It was, um, like once a month they would

187
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:28,880
pick like several games that they would allow you to play one or two hours of for free. And I think

188
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,640
it was even like a perk of PlayStation Plus or something like that, where it's like full game

189
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:38,240
demos or full game trials. And then, um, once you play those, you could like, if you could beat the

190
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,360
game in like an hour or whatever, then cool, you'd be able to buy it. But, um, I think you could also

191
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,400
purchase those games as well. It was kind of a way to like save from the developers having to

192
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:54,320
create, you know, unique demos for the games or, or, you know, I also like with the ones that they do

193
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,200
where the demo is completely separate from the actual game. Like they did that, I guess it wasn't

194
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:06,080
necessarily a demo, but it was, um, like a prologue or something like that. Like Dead Rising 2 did

195
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:11,360
something like that. They had a prologue. Um, I don't know. I'm just curious. I can't wait to see what they have.

196
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,640
Um, some more comments from chat, and this is a really good one from Hype Mayhem that says for

197
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,920
games, I'm against streaming. If only because if your internet goes out, shit out of luck, which,

198
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,000
you know, for all this stuff that we're sitting here going, data caps, there's, you know, when

199
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,440
we're talking about our fast internet, there's some people out there that live in rural parts

200
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,360
of the country or Alaska or Zach Def pointed out Mexico that are going like, hmm, must be nice to

201
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:44,000
have fast internet so you can even do cloud gaming in the first place. Hmm. So there's that whole

202
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,040
angle too, is that if cloud streaming were the only way to do it, that's not really going to work for

203
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,960
everybody either. It'll work for a big chunk of the population in the countries that they tend to

204
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:02,000
focus on first, uh, US, Canada, the, uh, the, the Europe regions that they are in and so forth, but

205
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,680
it may not work for everybody. So that's a very interesting call out too, which is why choice

206
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:12,720
would be great. Um, but there may be reasons why they don't want you to have choice. I don't know,

207
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:19,600
but I just, I, the perfect next Xbox, in my opinion, would have cloud streaming or

208
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:27,760
download and play on your own side at the touch of a button, which one could argue Sony started

209
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,640
to kind of have that in place with PlayStation now, but I don't think it's quite as seamless

210
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,280
as I think we would like. Right. Shouldn't it just be like a little switch before you launch the game

211
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,520
play on the X cloud play local, right? Yeah. And well, PlayStation now, I mean,

212
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,960
it just certainly doesn't have the appeal that, you know, something like game pass has. So

213
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,440
I think they really need to figure out that how Sony has a chance to step it up with PlayStation

214
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,400
five. Like they have every ability to say, okay, so here's the new version of PlayStation now on

215
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,120
the PlayStation five and they can reinvent it any way they want really. So there is that.

216
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,160
But I don't think they're right now in a position where they think that they're

217
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,120
threatened by, I think they're just like, yeah, we're, we're the number one, you know, game in

218
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,080
town right now. And so we're not going to do anything. So I think the ones that have the most

219
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,280
loser are going to be the ones that innovate more. So we'll see, you know, more from the Microsoft

220
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,760
side of things than we would Sony until Sony gets beaten down and then they'll finally get their

221
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,160
act together. Interesting, interesting way to put it. I don't, I don't know if Sony's necessarily,

222
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,800
I mean, it all, for me, like all of this technical stuff, like at the end of the day,

223
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,680
a lot of it doesn't matter. I mean, it does, but it's not going to matter nearly as much as

224
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:47,040
what do those launch games look like? Like which system has the games that people are going to go

225
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,360
for and, you know, Microsoft's likely going to come out with a new halo right out the gate.

226
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:57,680
I think we all know that. Um, but Microsoft also has that interesting, you know, complex complexity

227
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:03,520
where you kind of don't have to buy the new console. The new halo will still work on your

228
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:11,280
old Xbox, right? So they're not exactly encouraging people to upgrade either, but I can also see if

229
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,760
you're Microsoft and you're trailing in the game a little bit right now, you're just happy to have

230
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,520
people in your ecosystem. Like every Game Pass subscription is a giant fucking victory, right?

231
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:28,560
And Game Pass, you know, I, I use it. I do think it's great, honestly. Um, so, um, yeah, I just,

232
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,800
it's, it's just going to be very interesting to see what the, uh, console wars look like in just

233
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:39,600
a few months. And once we really know everything about these new systems, so, um, Pele Hanumeo with

234
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,120
another point in our chat saying internet speed is fine. It's the 4,000 mile round trip to streaming

235
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:51,520
servers. That's the problem. So you and I are a little spoiled in Northern California, whereas

236
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,000
almost assuredly in Silicon Valley, which is less than a two hour drive from here, there's always

237
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,960
going to be a server of some sort. So we don't have to worry about, uh, when I play Final Fantasy

238
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,120
14 online, those data centers are in a Thomas, they moved him to the Thomas. So I have a great

239
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,880
ping in that game because they're in my fricking backyard practically. So, uh, you're right. The

240
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,720
distance for how far it is to the servers is going to be an issue as well. So yeah. Anyway,

241
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,280
um, anything else we want to say on the demos? It feels like there's not too much else to say

242
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,200
until they're actually out and we know what all to be playing, but it's exciting. It is making a

243
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,480
comeback. Yeah. It's not just, you know, the demos as well. I believe that the actual show that

244
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,760
they're doing, the digital show is on the 21st as well. So that whole week, we're going to get some

245
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,840
more news about the Xbox and what's going on there. So very exciting. Only a few more weeks

246
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,960
away. Yeah. That's only what about, uh, two, two weeks to change away. That's cool. All right.

247
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,880
Awesome. All right. Well, let's get into, um, we haven't been streaming a lot of demos this

248
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,920
weekend. Well, maybe you have, I don't know. Well, let's talk about the types of games that we have

249
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,320
been playing this week and how was your gaming week again, dark soccer has the night off. She's

250
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,720
taking care of some personal issues tonight. She will be back next week with us. So we'll get her

251
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:13,040
gaming week then for now, uh, Loki. It's been all Minecraft pretty much. So, uh, I've been working

252
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:18,640
on stuff with the realm and everything, and, uh, I was trying to add more add-ons to the game. So

253
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:26,880
those are like the mods for, uh, bedrock. And so a lot of it ended up being trying to get the server

254
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:34,640
to cooperate because I tried to upload everything with it and it won't upload sometimes when they

255
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,680
have some network issues. And then the other times that it does upload because of certain

256
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:47,200
restrictions that they have on, um, the realms, which is there's parts, I don't know what exactly

257
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,800
is deemed experimental gameplay, but it's one of the options that they have in your actual worlds

258
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,240
that you make is with these add-ons. Some of them require experimental game gameplay in order to run

259
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,800
and realms is supposed to not support that. And so that causes your add-ons to break in very

260
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:10,560
different ways each time. So I was trying to get some, a few on there just to kind of add some more

261
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:15,200
difficulty to the game, like add some more mobs and everything. And the problem I was having,

262
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,080
well, I had lots of problems. So the first one I wanted to add was the Minecraft earth, um,

263
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,480
characters or the mobs that are from that game, which it doesn't really change anything. It just

264
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,200
makes things look a little bit different, which is kind of cool. Uh, none of that worked, uh, or

265
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,880
if they were spawning, they're all invisible. And then I had an issue where I tried getting these

266
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,200
mutant creatures to spawn and I had purposefully removed the creeper out of the game because

267
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,720
that thing just explodes like crazy and will tear apart everything that you have.

268
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:53,440
I'm like, okay, I don't want that near my house, blowing a hole in the house. So I purposefully

269
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,720
took it out of there. Well, when I uploaded it to the realm, somehow it's still there.

270
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,760
Cause I think what happens is it'll actually, they have a key that's associated with each add-on.

271
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:09,200
And because of that, I think copies that stuff over. So if it's already in their database,

272
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,840
it may just, you know, pull it from there. So the modifications I made didn't seem to go through,

273
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,280
but it was invisible as well. So big hole, thankfully I was smart and backed up my

274
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,960
stuff when I'm doing all that. So I ended up making a few modifications. I did get one to work,

275
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:33,040
uh, which was they have the brand new mob Strider. It's a, uh, little creature that walks on lava.

276
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:37,440
So I made one that's in the overworld, like called a depth Strider. And so that's kind of

277
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,280
cool. So I made it for my kids cause they wanted a Strider to walk around with on, um, the overworld,

278
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,760
but they die in water. So, and it rains all the time by our house. So I had to do something

279
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,800
different. So I did all that. And then I've been having issues with, um, mob spawning in my house.

280
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:58,560
So like right before I logged off today, um, my son doesn't know it yet, but there are skeletons

281
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:04,160
that spawned up in our main living room and it killed one of his birds. So, uh, we'll have to

282
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:09,360
respond that one. Um, but yeah, it just running into all sorts of weird stuff, especially with

283
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,000
the new update that came out a couple of weeks ago, it's changed how stuff spawns in the game.

284
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,760
And so even though if you keep, you're supposed to be able to keep the light levels high enough

285
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,640
to where they won't spawn, that's how it knows whether you have a house or not, or like a base

286
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,160
or whatever. If you keep the light levels up, it should, the rules should, uh, cause it not to

287
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:35,840
spawn in your house. Something is broken right now, which happens with any update and it's not

288
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,040
working correctly. So I'm having stuff, even though I've lit up everything, I'm having mobs

289
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:46,560
spawn all over the place. Also could be because our base is like five stories tall. Um, so it

290
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:51,040
might be something that involved with that, but it's, it's causing problems. Meanwhile,

291
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,800
I dig a hole into the side of a cliff and that's where I live in Minecraft.

292
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,600
Like I, I've thought about streaming some of it, but like, we've already gotten so far into it

293
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,280
already. Um, but like, it's just, it's a complete system right now. We've got like automatic sorting

294
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:13,680
systems and, um, mob farms all over the place. It's just, it's elaborate right now. So maybe

295
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:18,560
later when we reboot the whole thing again, we, we can, um, people probably wouldn't mind a tour

296
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,560
of the current space. Like I, I would still be willing to stream animal crossing, even though

297
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:27,040
I haven't gotten it from the very beginning, but I could show everybody how the roses roses have

298
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:32,880
grown out of control on my Island because it rains all the flipping time. Yeah. So we, we beat the

299
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,360
other dragon today. Uh, I was building, um, cause I have a network of tunnels in the, the end or

300
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:45,040
not the end of the nether to go to all these different, um, biomes that are not near our house.

301
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:50,960
So I have all that. And then a new update added this thing called souls. It's like a soul speed

302
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,880
or something like that. And so if you're running on soul sand, which normally slows you down,

303
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,760
it'll actually speed you up. So I just put that on the floor and all my tunnels and you can zip

304
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,080
around like the whole map. So the next thing we're doing is going to the Woodland mansion,

305
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,640
which is another like kind of boss area. And then there's, um, a few other things we have to do when

306
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,800
they were pretty much done. It's just kind of adding on to it. Um, so that's what we've been

307
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:18,400
doing. And then, um, aside from that, of course, or not, I've been playing that, um, I did download

308
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,720
the Ironman VR game, but I just didn't get a chance to set it up and play it, but I know my kids

309
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,480
want to play that. So. I have been taking areas like crazy in Orna. I'm becoming that person that

310
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,560
we all hated in the beginning. Well, there's people taking stuff back from me, but I've been

311
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:39,520
like, um, I've been trying to just, you know, you keep, um, spamming it and you eventually take them.

312
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:45,360
So yeah. Yeah. All right. That's it. Well, then my gaming week, I I've also been playing a bit

313
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,080
of Orna as usual, kind of the good old standby has been playing a little more Pokemon go as well

314
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,200
with the new event that's going on that kind of leads into the Pokemon go, uh, summer faster or

315
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,280
go fest. That's anywhere this year, obviously, because of everything going on in the world.

316
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:04,000
Um, but they have some events leading into it and, uh, they released a new duck Pokemon whose

317
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,960
name escapes me right now. It's like, it's like duck monitor. So it's very generic name. Somebody

318
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,800
will say it in chat, but they just released that. And then they have all these little quests,

319
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,920
uh, where if you catch so many Pokemon and like throw an excellent and all these things,

320
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:23,360
uh, it's supposed to, if a lot of trainers do it, unlock new Pokemon that will be available during

321
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,320
go fest, which you know, the trainers are going to complete it. They always do. I've never seen

322
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,520
them actually hold back on anything. So thank you, ducklet. Thank you. Act F say I knew it was a very

323
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,000
generic kind of name, uh, but that's still fun. And, uh, it's nice to have like little new things

324
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,760
here and there and Pokemon go keeps that game motivating, uh, and still playing ingress. Of

325
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,640
course, always, uh, good to see people. There was a ingress, a virtual event that happened yesterday

326
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,640
where it's kind of like, we're going to all play ingress at the same time in our house, but since

327
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,080
we can't do anything but recharge, that's what we're going to do is have a recharge party.

328
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,160
So it's interesting, but I, Hey, that's what they got to do right now. It's the responsible thing

329
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:03,600
to do. We can all like meet at a restaurant like we used to do. Um, okay. So outside the usuals,

330
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,200
let's talk about some of the new stuff and I bet you guys want to hear about this. All right. So

331
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,280
this week, uh, on Monday, and I've been teasing this for the past couple of weeks is that I

332
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,680
ordered myself a birthday present. So my birthday was at the end of last month. And so I spent a

333
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:22,400
little bit of money, uh, and bought myself something on arcade one up that I wanted for,

334
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,960
I, I wanted an arcade one up machine. I didn't have one yet. And I was like, I'm going to buy

335
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,560
one when there there's a game that comes out where I'm like, Ooh, I got to have that. I almost bought

336
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,240
the mortal combat one, but I never did. Cause I was like, Oh, we don't have room for it. We don't

337
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,760
have room for it. And then earlier this year, they announced the thing that finally got me

338
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,560
a burger time arcade cabinet burger times. You know, those who've been listening to OLR a long

339
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:48,640
time burger times, one of my jams from the 1980s. I remember that game as a kid. And not only did

340
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,760
they release a bird time cabinet, they released a limited edition burger time cabinet. So they're

341
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:00,560
only going to make like, it's something like 3,200, no 3075 of these. And based on my certificate,

342
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:05,920
I have machine number 2,604. So I think that's right. Or was it 2,406? I forget,

343
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:11,360
but it's one of those ways. Uh, so I, I did get one of these machines and it's got four games on

344
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:18,240
it. It's got a burger time, bad dudes, karate champ and caveman ninja. And, uh, the machine

345
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,400
took me about two and a half hours to build. And you probably want to see what the darn thing

346
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,560
looks like. So let me just show some of the footage here on stream, uh, that I shot in the

347
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,520
living room where I put this. And, uh, it probably took me about two and a half hours to build.

348
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:38,720
And it is, uh, similar to building Ikea furniture, but I actually found it to be a little bit easier

349
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,760
than building Ikea furniture because they actually put all the different parts in little bags.

350
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:50,240
They're like, use a screw from the A bag, use a wooden thing from the B bag and so forth. Um,

351
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,440
and so, uh, it was actually, it wasn't so bad to put together. I was able to do it mostly myself.

352
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,840
And I'm not saying that in a flex kind of way. I'm saying that in a, this really wasn't that bad

353
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,760
type of way. The hardest part were the hinges, because you can see, if you're looking at the

354
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,160
video, you can see the monitor is slanted. Like you would expect an old, old arcade machine to be.

355
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:13,440
And so it has to slant just right against the two side panels. So you have to attach these hinge

356
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,760
parts. Uh, and that was the hardest part by far. And, uh, I needed Alan's help on that to shine

357
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,320
a light because I couldn't see everything I was doing. So I was like, come over here and shine

358
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:31,680
a light, uh, right in this spot so I can see what I'm doing. Um, anyway, so you can see in the video

359
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,040
for those that are watching on Twitch, it just ran through the whole little boot up sequence.

360
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,120
You choose your game, you hit the button to start it. And then there I am playing burger time. Of

361
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,400
course, it's kind of hard to play the game appropriately with one hand while you're

362
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,720
filming with the other. Cause you probably see my fat reflection there in the monitor,

363
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,520
but whatever, but there you go. I am making my way through the game. And I think that's

364
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:56,320
about where the B roll ends there. So, so who, who, who's asked in there and knows the high score

365
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:03,040
second place is it might be me. Uh, excuse me, second place and fifth place. Thank you.

366
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,640
Okay. So yeah. Yeah. So I act like I'm 11, whatever. Yes. I put ass as the initials.

367
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,440
I do it every time. Well, not every time I used to put VOG in. Uh, and I still, if I,

368
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,000
if I'm at a professional environment, like when I'm at California extreme,

369
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,560
I will put VOG as the initials as a cheap plug for our little network here.

370
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,560
But when I'm in the privacy of my own home, it's all about ass.

371
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:35,440
All right. Uh, so, uh, looking in chat, uh, at some of the comments,

372
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:41,840
Vidpower 573 says, love that classic burger time game music. Yep. Uh, bonds double 06 also spotted

373
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:47,280
the high scores. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, Questbuster says classic burger time. So good. Yeah, it was,

374
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:54,160
it was, uh, it was, it was great. Like it was, it was, it, it looks very sharp on that LCD monitor.

375
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,600
You know, it's, it's different cause it's not a CRT monitor like the eighties. So it does look

376
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,320
a little different, but I mean, come on, y'all have played maim. I know you have. So you've

377
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,720
probably played these games on a modern monitor, but there's something about the actual like

378
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,360
correct resolution on that screen. And it's a nice vertical fit. Like it's not like you're trying to

379
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,880
play burger time on your, your wide screen monitor. We have this black space. There's

380
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,200
something about the way it fills out the screen just perfectly. That is, is very refreshing quite

381
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,960
frankly. Um, so I played a little bit of burger time of course, and then I played some of the

382
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,960
other games too. I played karate champ, which is why there's two joysticks for each side on that

383
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,520
thing. I don't know if you saw when I was running the bureau again, but you'll notice the, the

384
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,800
machine actually has four sticks on it. That's because each player needs two sticks in karate

385
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,880
champ. So even though everything is decked out in burger time, it still has everything. You only

386
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,560
need one button for burger time too. You don't need two. Um, so for other games like caveman ninja

387
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:51,600
and, um, I think bad dudes may have used two buttons as well. That's the one game I haven't

388
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:57,280
played yet is bad dudes because Alan played bad dudes on the cabinet. And that's when Mr. Smoosh

389
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:02,560
decided this is my cabinet now. And he decided he found his way out of jump on top of that and

390
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,480
so forth. And you know how that goes. Oops. You know how that goes when you're a cat owner. So

391
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:12,960
all right. Um, Questbuster says, wow, those cabs look great. They really do. I, I I'm pretty

392
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,640
impressed. Like I'm going to be honest. I want to buy another one. Um, and one of my friends,

393
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,600
one of my friends has really gotten into collecting them and was like,

394
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:28,480
Hey Rob, Hey, Hey, the Walmart in, uh, Auburn right now has the Pac-Man one for 50 bucks.

395
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,240
And I'm like, number one, fuck you for telling me that. Number two, fuck you again for telling

396
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:41,440
me that when you know, I want one of these things. Number three, the full size Pac-Man one,

397
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,960
because that's been out for how long now? They're probably unloading it. I don't know if it's still

398
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,760
there. Loki. I see you making a face. I I'd have to ask my friend. That's not a bad, like,

399
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,800
I don't need it, but you kind of want it so you can hack the shit out of it. I know you do.

400
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,160
I know we're watching the gears turn in Loki's. We're watching him plot live on air

401
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,960
as 200 mats. Like the wheels are turning in Loki's mind. Dr. T says,

402
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,760
yeah, that's how it starts handicap in the garage. You can't, I can't, it's just the, um,

403
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,520
any of the monitor replaced or fixed or something because the monitor doesn't turn on,

404
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,800
but it monitors fixed. I mean, I have Mame on had Mame on there. I took the computer apart, but

405
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,960
I never built a new one anyways, but in all ideal situations, I have a dedicated system to do that.

406
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,240
And it's six buttons and everything like that. Yeah. It's the one that used to be here in the

407
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:37,360
studio. No. Oh no. Different one. No, I have an actual, it's a Sega Astro city. It's a,

408
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,360
like, like the ones you'd see, uh, arcade infinity. They used to play like,

409
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:49,920
okay. Yeah. So yeah, it's like those, um, it's just the monitors. It's a, you know, a CGA,

410
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:56,880
a CRT and it's, it doesn't, I don't know what happened when I moved it out of the house into

411
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,560
the garage. Like I tested it before I left, you know, moved it and it was fine. And I moved in

412
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:07,360
the garage and it sat in there for like a little bit and I tried doing it again and it doesn't

413
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:12,080
power on anymore. It's old. So I, it seems to be repaired, but who are you going to get to repair

414
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:17,760
that? And like, I don't want to touch those high, I don't want to touch any of those capacitors to,

415
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,200
you know, ground those out to replace the, whatever. I don't know how to fix any of that

416
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:29,520
stuff. So I got to find someone to do it. Um, yeah. And, and I, I really do want another

417
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,040
cabinet. Like I already, I kind of want that mortal combat trilogy one, because I know Alan

418
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,360
will be into that one as well. Um, and you know, there's other new ones that are coming out that

419
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,280
I want, but the reality is I, and I promised Alan, I'm putting the brakes on it. I'm not going to

420
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,280
actually buy another one. So hopefully I don't miss out on too many of them or they reprint or

421
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:52,160
something. Um, until we, and I don't, I don't want to speak too much out of turn, but once this

422
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,160
COVID thing gets a little more under control, cause it's really bad, especially this month

423
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,800
right now, but maybe in a month or two and things hopefully at least start to go down significantly

424
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,960
again. And it's not as crazy as it is right now. Uh, Alan and I are looking into buying our own

425
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,200
home as opposed to renting one finally, uh, finally becoming big boys and getting our own

426
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:17,520
home. And the nice thing about that is that, um, you know, then we, uh, won't be beholden to

427
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:23,280
how many pets we can own and things like that. So the deal is when we buy our own home, the reward

428
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:30,400
is Alan gets to have another cat and I benefit from that too. And then I get to have more arcade

429
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,960
cabinets and Alan benefits a little bit from that too. So, uh, that's, that's the deal. So I'm hoping

430
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,320
fingers and toes crossed, and I hope I'm not talking too much out of turn, but the ironic thing

431
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,040
is by the time we all return to OLR in the same place, we might not actually be in the same place

432
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,880
anymore. It's fine. It'll be, it'll be a nice little reboot whenever that happens. So we'll see.

433
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,080
Yeah. So yeah, I, again, I don't know that that process could take like a year. I don't know how

434
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,360
it's going to take. I don't even know if I, we have the money for it, but we've been saving

435
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:02,160
for a little bit. So that'll be nice. Anyway, enough personal stuff. Let's get back to, um,

436
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,480
some of the other things that I've been playing this week. So one of the other games I've been

437
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,960
playing this week, animal crossing, of course, um, you might think same old, same old, but I

438
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,440
was reinvigorated a little bit on animal crossing with the whole deep sea diving thing. Uh, that's

439
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,520
kind of cool. And it gives new stuff to collect and it's not like there's only like four things

440
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,800
in the ocean right now. Uh, there's at least like 10 or 12 probably that I've found so far. So

441
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,960
there's a variety of things to find in the ocean right now. And it was, it's a nice little kick in

442
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,360
the butt that that game needed. Uh, because I feel like, Oh, I have a new thing I can do now.

443
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,520
There's something new to collect and, Oh, there's this otter that will show up and give me random

444
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,920
new, uh, furniture patterns and the mermaid set and so forth. And I really hope this is the type

445
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,880
of little kick in the pants, the animal crossing keeps getting every month or every six weeks or

446
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,400
so. Uh, cause I think that's going to keep the game really exciting. I'm, I'm sure it's just

447
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,440
a matter of time before we have some like substantial DLC for this game. Like Nintendo

448
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,000
would be fools not to do that. Um, but the free content updates that we're getting in the meantime,

449
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,600
or I guess if we get a lot of free content updates, they don't actually sell any DLC.

450
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,400
That's cool too. Um, but I would think Nintendo would be morons not to try to sell some DLC at

451
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,960
some point. Um, I don't know what they'll do. We'll see. So anyway,

452
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,320
Yeah, it would be interesting to see what they're going to do to expand on that. I mean,

453
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,320
I'm surprised that they haven't had any DLC yet.

454
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,600
Uh, some folks in chat, I'm just taking a look at a chat as 200. Matt says buying smoosh, a home

455
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:30,480
y'all are renting from him. Yeah. Uh, Bobby Blackwell says dedicated studio space, studio

456
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,920
smoosh. Well, technically we kind of, I mean like this is the family room in our house that we rent

457
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:41,200
right now and it's a dedicated studio space. My husband lets me get away with a lot of shit. Um,

458
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:48,320
but he knew, he knew what he was marrying. So he knew he would be marrying a radio show as well as

459
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:55,600
me. So, uh, it happened. Um, let's see a Tiberian chat says pocket camp has been getting good with

460
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,320
doing a new event every few weeks. Like every month you get a larger event and three weekly

461
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,440
smaller events. Yeah. So it would be cool if, um, the switch version adopts a similar rhythm and we

462
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,520
see a lot of new things because just the little things like exploring the ocean is a big kick in

463
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,400
the pants. All right. One more game I want to talk about that I played this week. That's new ish. Um,

464
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,680
it actually came out a couple of weeks ago, but I just got around to playing it this week.

465
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,400
So do you remember a couple of weeks ago, uh, when I was doing Japanese releases, I was talking

466
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,520
about the Namcot collection or no, no, it was because of the story of the Pac-Man championship

467
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,800
D make that's in the Namcot collection in Japan. Right. Well, that collection also came out here,

468
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,720
uh, as I think it's, uh, the Namco, I don't know the official name of it, but it's like

469
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:42,160
Namco collection volume one and volume two, and it's on switch and it's on PlayStation four.

470
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:47,040
So I actually picked it up on PlayStation four, just because I don't know, trophies or, um, I

471
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,640
don't know. I just picked up my places before, because that's where I wanted to buy it. I bought

472
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:57,520
volume one so I could actually play that D make of Pac-Man championship edition. And it's pretty

473
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,520
cool. I gotta say, um, I, I should have grabbed some B roll for tonight, but I didn't have the

474
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,720
PS four in the studio. Sorry guys. Um, but it's cool. And I guess, I guess some news is coming

475
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:12,000
out this week that Namco may have adopted that from a ROM that somebody did in 2008.

476
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,280
So it might actually be like a legitimized ROM hack of sorts. It's interesting,

477
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,120
but I thought it was neat how the whole screen goes back and forth to kind of make up for

478
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,440
the limitations of the NES. It's kind of, it's interesting. I like that. And then of course,

479
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,360
there's a ton of other games. It's, you know, a lot of the, and it's pretty much nothing,

480
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:37,680
but any S ROMs, uh, you know, things like dig, Doug, tower of Druaga, uh, things like that.

481
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:43,360
But what's interesting. I think they retained all the Japanese releases because they all say

482
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:48,080
NAM caught at the bottom. When you launch into the games, I don't remember that being the case

483
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:52,560
in the U S and I don't think all these games even came out in the U S on the NES or Famicom,

484
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,920
whatever. In fact, I know one of them is new in volume one and I forget the full name of the

485
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,320
game. Sorry. Maybe somebody knows in chat, but there's like a cutesy splatter house.

486
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,680
Um, I know that sounds a little weird cutesy splatter house, but if you think about it,

487
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:14,880
the NES couldn't handle the realism of splatter house, it couldn't handle those types of graphics.

488
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,520
You remember that game? So they have like a cutesy cartoony version that came out and that

489
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,000
is in this collection. And what's interesting. I know it never came out in the U S and what's

490
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,040
interesting about it. The title screen is still in Japanese, but they translated the text in the

491
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,320
game. So it's like another kind of like new thing that's in the collection. And I think that's

492
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,800
really cool. So I did buy volume one and overall, yeah, it's a, it's a solid little collection of

493
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,440
games. It's 20 bucks. I'm not sure if everybody's going to want to drop that kind of money

494
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,960
on some retro. I love retro games though. So it was fine for me. I'll probably pick up volume

495
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,640
two eventually as well, uh, because there's some really cool games in volume two as well.

496
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:58,240
I'm going to talk about one of them a little later. So, um, anyway, Bobby says in the future,

497
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,080
you don't need to bring the PS4 in the studio. Just hit the share button, capture 15 minutes

498
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:06,720
of video and move it to a USB stick. I always forget that you can move the video to a USB stick,

499
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:13,520
but I'll do that. I will remember that in the future. So, uh, yeah. So I, I thought that was

500
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:19,040
a nice little collection. So I enjoyed playing that. So, uh, the, the U S version of the Namcock

501
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,600
collection, I approve, uh, and I'll show you some of the championship edition either on a personal

502
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,200
stream or maybe, maybe I'll do a follow-up video. That's something I've been looking at doing is

503
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:33,040
trying to do some follow-up like content. Um, so maybe we'll do a, uh, uh, a breakout on, uh,

504
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:38,000
championship edition a little later on in the make. So, uh, okay. That's it for my gaming week.

505
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,320
So let's move on. Um, before I get into the news, I have a little bit of housekeeping I want to get

506
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,560
into. Uh, sorry, Loki. I didn't warn you about this. I need to do a little bit of a tangent.

507
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,240
It has nothing to do with this show. It has nothing to do. Well, a little bit has to do

508
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:59,760
with podcasting. So let me get into it a little bit. Um, I got some somewhat difficult news

509
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:08,400
yesterday that, uh, a long time listener that of my show, Hoard House. Um, and you guys may or

510
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:14,640
may not remember, I had a show, I think it was around 2012 to 2000. No, it was probably 2011 to

511
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,880
2014, give or take a year. So look, it's been a while. I had a show called Hoard House. It was

512
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:25,200
dedicated to World of Warcraft and it was hosted with my buddies, Extifer, Shane, and, uh, Grandpa,

513
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,440
or you know him as Captain Matt on Starboard Power Coupling. You've, you've heard all these people on

514
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,760
OLR at some point or another, but we used to have a World of Warcraft based show. And through that,

515
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,160
we had kind of a different audience than we would have here on OLR because the Warcraft community,

516
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,280
is very tight knit. And, um, you know, there's a lot of awesome people that I met through that.

517
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,120
It's the thing I miss most about doing Hoard House. I don't necessarily miss the game World

518
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:51,440
of Warcraft. Um, but I miss the people that I met through it. Cause you know, like for example,

519
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,600
Girls Gone Wow was an amazing show, uh, that used to be here at the Voice Geeks Network.

520
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,760
They've continued on to Wow Radio and they're doing just fine. Uh, and I would have never met

521
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,840
those gals if it wasn't for my time in World of Warcraft. And that's just one of many examples.

522
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,960
So amongst doing the show Hoard House, and your guys are going to have to forgive me with my

523
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,720
memory. I feel like he may have guest hosted even in one episode or something. Um, but we

524
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,880
had a listener on that show. His name was Hastur. It was his online name. His real name was Steven.

525
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,120
I can probably tell you that now. Um, but his online name was, was Hastur. And, um,

526
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:27,200
he listened on, uh, Hoard House. He may have listened a couple of times to OLR,

527
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,120
but I know he was more of a wow guy. So, um, that was a show that he was listening to in a

528
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:36,800
minute through that. And interestingly enough, I don't know if it was because I think it was

529
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,960
maybe a little bit because I used to talk about it a lot on Hoard House. I was starting to get

530
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:47,120
into a game called Ingress, which I've still talked about on OLR to this day. Um, but I know

531
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:53,280
that Hastur actually downloaded that game, joined the same team that I was on and kind of fell off

532
00:45:53,280 --> 00:46:00,640
the deep end on that game as I did, uh, uh, in that game. And so I ended up kind of interacting

533
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,240
even after Hoard House was done and I wasn't really playing World of Warcraft anymore.

534
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,440
I was still interacting with Hastur in Ingress related things. Uh, I met up with him at the

535
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,960
big Chicago anomaly that I took OLR off to go attend, uh, Memorial day of last year. We had a

536
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:21,200
big event here in Sacramento in October. He was here for that. Um, I'm using the past tense. So,

537
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,400
you know, all know where this is headed. Um, Hastur passed away at the end of last week. Um,

538
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:34,160
and I'm really, I'm really gutted about it. Um, you know, the listeners that we have that we're

539
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,360
very fortunate to have here at Orange Laundry and I've said this many times before you guys are like

540
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:45,600
an extended family. And, you know, obviously I got, this is one of those instances where I got

541
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:52,240
to know somebody offline in person and interact with them. Maybe not every day. We weren't BFFs,

542
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,120
but he was somebody I knew and I liked and I respected and I appreciated that he was

543
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:04,000
supportive of many of the projects that I had done, um, previously. So it's, it's been,

544
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:10,240
it's been hard. Yesterday was not an easy day when I got this news. Um, what's making this

545
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:16,560
more difficult and more complicated is that the family suspects, the reason why he passed away

546
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:26,880
was due to complications of COVID-19. Um, which he had been, I presumed positive like four days

547
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,840
before he passed. Um, I think that means he had all the symptoms and talked to a doctor and the

548
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:36,880
doctor went, yep, you probably have this. But because, uh, the system is so backed up with

549
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,960
tests right now, because you're in Texas, which is one of the States that it's, you know, blown

550
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,960
up everywhere. And again, I might be inserting my own dialogue in here, but for whatever reason,

551
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,760
he didn't get an official test. Um, but the family is presuming it is, um, that situation.

552
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:58,160
So like that just leaves me feeling even more frustrated and angry because I feel like

553
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:04,160
something like this could have been preventable. And I know you guys don't like it sometimes,

554
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:09,760
not all of you like it. When I get on my high horse here and I preach certain things that aren't

555
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:16,000
necessarily about video games and things of that sort to which I say tonight, too fucking bad,

556
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,240
because now this thing has consumed a friend of mine that I've met because of doing shows like

557
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:27,920
this. And because of my love of video games and all this stuff that now are incompetent government,

558
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:33,120
who, which has allowed this thing to spread way more than it ought to have. And because of

559
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:41,280
incompetent fools and assholes that are so brazen enough to sit there and think that this thing is a

560
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:47,200
lie or masks don't help. Even though all these scientists everywhere are seeing mass help,

561
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:52,080
people will put images of the side of a box, say, look, it says it doesn't prevent COVID-19.

562
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:58,880
No, you idiot. It doesn't prevent it, but it goes a long way in stopping the spread of it.

563
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:05,360
Those disclaimers are on boxes of masks because they're not the N95 mask that medical providers

564
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:10,160
are supposed to be used when they're exposed to the thing all day long. But when you go to a

565
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:17,440
fucking bar or a restaurant or whatever it is, you can be bothered to put on a goddamn mask.

566
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:25,840
I'm sick of this masks are a lie narrative. I am ready to fight people over this. If you believe

567
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:34,640
that masks are a lie, I need you to fuck off because now this is fucking personal.

568
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,800
A member of my family passed away this week because of this disease.

569
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:50,000
Because some of y'all out there can't be bothered to take this seriously. And it, it's enraging.

570
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,760
I'm just like, I can't even put words in my mouth right now because I will see things online that

571
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:01,200
drive me nuts. Thank God, this is the weekend I also decided to deactivate Facebook because

572
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,360
I'll tell you what, if I hadn't deactivated, I would have said something to get myself banned

573
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:13,600
this weekend. Trust. Please take this seriously. And I know many of you all out there are.

574
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:18,880
But to those that are pushing this narrative that it's a lie and all this stuff like,

575
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:26,400
I hope, I hope you're comfortable with that choice.

576
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:32,400
Because people that thought like that just took the life of a friend of mine.

577
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:46,640
In chat over at Twitch TV slash vog network, Bobby Blackwell says in an RPG,

578
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,200
if I get an accessory that gives me 30%

579
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,600
disease resistance and the slot it goes in is open, I equip it immediately.

580
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,880
Perfect analogy. Thank you. Sjoan under Matt says we have not flattened the curve as well

581
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,600
as other countries because people are not taking this seriously.

582
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,720
Dark Tetsuya says my wife and my dad are both immunocompromised. So they're both

583
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:15,280
one idiot with a mask away from catching it. And DJ Rama S says in a way, I'm glad my mom is not

584
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:20,480
alive for this. Because she was immunocompromised. If someone got her sick, I'd kill them personally.

585
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:27,040
Rama, I am right there with you. And I've even said it on this show that like, I miss my mom

586
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:32,800
every single day. But I am so happy she does not have to see this right now. I'm so happy she

587
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:40,240
doesn't have to see this right now. Anyway, I had to vent a little bit. Ultimately, I said all that

588
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:48,960
because I want to dedicate tonight's show to Hester's memory. And thank him for all the support

589
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:56,080
over the years of podcasting and so forth. And I'm just I'm so sorry that this happened. And I

590
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:02,560
I like that immediate next words that want to leave your mouth are, I wish it could have

591
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:15,760
been prevented. Could have. Let's move on and talk about games. Loki.

592
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:24,560
All right, so Nintendo has decided to finally fess up about the whole joy con drifting issue,

593
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:31,280
although they didn't really have much to say. So this is coming from Nintendo of Japan president

594
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:39,360
Shintaro Furukawa, who noted he apologizes for any trouble that the hardware has caused.

595
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,800
But he can't speak more on the matter because there's a class action lawsuit going on.

596
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:53,840
So while that's nice that he apologizes for the trouble, what are they doing to fix the problem

597
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:59,120
aside from the three fixes that they were doing? But like I've had that already fixed, you know,

598
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:07,520
all of my joy cons already. Well, I mean, I have two more to fix, but I've got the parts to do it.

599
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:14,560
It's definitely something that's plaguing all of them. And it's something that he knows the design

600
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:19,600
issue, then change the design, fix the problem. Don't just say sorry, sorry.

601
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:25,680
Well, it is very interesting that they won't comment on it due to the ongoing lawsuit,

602
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:32,000
which almost in some way gives that lawsuit a little more merit because I mean, that's also

603
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,600
probably just part of procedure. I don't want to, you know, speak completely out of term,

604
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,560
but it almost seems like there may be something here that Nintendo really is legitimately

605
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:44,320
concerned with. I think it's just like the whole scenario like they did with not Nintendo,

606
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:49,120
but Microsoft was with the red ring stuff. It's like basically to minimize, minimize, minimize

607
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:55,680
until they're forced to take action because it's obvious that, you know, I think I don't remember

608
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:01,120
if the red ring, I know that they had lawsuits with that. I'm sure that this is similar.

609
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:07,520
Basically the lawsuit that was filed in 2019 still underway under arbitration in Washington,

610
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:16,160
but the court denied Nintendo's dismissal. So, I mean, it's still going along. And, you know,

611
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:21,600
by all means, you know, I would definitely take part of that because, you know,

612
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:28,400
it's obviously a thing. I had to buy stuff to fix it. It's ridiculous. I understand that they

613
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,280
were offering to fix them, but Microsoft did the same thing. And I don't know.

614
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:38,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says legally, they can't comment. They cannot comment on pending

615
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,560
litigation. And yeah, I get that. But it does seem like with all of the lawsuits and all of

616
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:46,880
like the crazy things we talk about on this show, like it's kind of weird to hear, even though,

617
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,920
yes, I understand that that's in the back of my mind. It's still kind of weird to see that come

618
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:55,680
actually come full circle where Nintendo actually go so far to comment and say no comment. Now I

619
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:00,640
understand the, you know, the president was asked a question by a journalist and that's where it

620
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,960
ended up, but it's, you don't always hear anything at all on a lot of these things that are going

621
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:10,400
around, especially when Nintendo is usually the one that's the litigator. But anyway, I also,

622
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:16,080
this story is just interesting to me because knock on wood, I feel like one of the only people who's

623
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:21,920
never experienced that ish this issue. I don't have drifting, drifting joy cons. Again, knock

624
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:27,280
on wood. Cause that's when it's going to break tomorrow. But I also play primarily on the

625
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:34,160
television with a pro controller, like 95%, if not more of my switch time is on the television

626
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:39,520
with a pro controller. So I'm not as maybe different. I don't know. Oh yeah. I'm sure

627
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,000
the pro controllers, since they're built completely differently, they're fine.

628
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,040
And then Alan now is a big switch gamer because not only is he playing animal crossing,

629
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,560
but I've caught him this week, you know, caught him, but I've seen him this week for many,

630
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:54,560
many hours. In fact, he's probably playing it right now, playing through dark souls on the

631
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,760
switch. Cause that came out on the switch and he loved that game on PC. So now he's playing it on

632
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:04,720
the switch. But he's on a switch light. And so I don't think that necessarily has the same problems

633
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:11,600
either. Cause he has the, I would certainly hope not being integrated. You can't, I mean,

634
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:19,040
it would be much harder to fix. I would think, I mean, I'm assuming if, if it is designed the

635
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:25,200
same way as the joy cons are, as far as having the same hardware in there, it wasn't, it's not

636
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:30,240
too hard to fix. I mean, you, you can follow the instructions online. It's what I did. I just

637
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:34,640
bought the stuff for my fix. And I think each one of the replacement analog six was like

638
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:43,440
10 bucks maybe. But it's still, it's a hassle to have to do that. It should just not be breaking

639
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,760
in the first place. I mean, the same could be said with like, like the dual shock controllers and,

640
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:52,560
and the rubber on those, you know, I, I have, it's not dual shock by having an Xbox 360

641
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:58,240
third-party controller where the rubber on the analog six cracked and is falling off.

642
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:03,040
And so I had, thankfully I have another defective one, the same model. I just took

643
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:08,160
it apart to pull the good pieces off and threw the rest of the way. So I could replace those,

644
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:12,160
but it's still annoying that it happens. Bobby Blackwolf says the pro controller's

645
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:16,000
also got a software update to fix the drift. You know, now that you say that I kind of remember

646
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,240
that, but since that is also seamless, like it's like, Oh, I kind of forgot that ever happened.

647
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,360
Cause you know, your Nintendo, Nintendo just updates every now and then. Right. So you just

648
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:27,440
kind of let it, I don't understand how a software problem would fix the drift problem. The drift is

649
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:35,200
from dirt getting into their, where the sensor is, it's causing fluctuations in the, the resistance

650
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:41,200
on those pads. So it's making it feel near the software, or I guess it would interpret it,

651
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:45,600
interpolate is I'm pushing the controller in a certain direction because it's,

652
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:51,760
it's dirt that's getting in there from the pad being rubbed back and forth. But I don't know,

653
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,560
whatever. I mean, if they have a solution that it fixes it and they could do an update that'll fix

654
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:01,200
it permanently. Great. I would think though, if they had a solution for that, they would have

655
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:07,360
already done it, but it's still an issue. Good comment here too, on the whole litigation thing

656
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:12,000
from Questbuster over Twitch TV slash VOG network, who says, just look at Boeing's response over the

657
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,840
737 max. Many people faulted the software and the plane, but Boeing deflected admitting fault

658
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:22,800
because to admit it would open the flood gate to lawsuits. Yes. You can't really say, Oh yes,

659
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:26,800
we're aware there's a problem. Oops. You just said there's a problem. Now the flood gates get

660
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:31,360
open to lawsuits. Although it seems like it's going to be inevitable. They'll probably, there

661
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:35,680
will probably end up being some sort of settlement anyway, but I don't expect that you're just going

662
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:40,080
to get cash in pocket. They're probably just going to have to set up some sort of exchange program

663
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:45,360
repair thing, which they're kind of already doing. Yeah. And they'll have to give away

664
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:52,640
Zelda for free or something. Who knows? I don't know. It was a hassle already to do that. And so

665
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:57,840
I had signed up to do it, but like I had done it with the wrong controller at the time because I

666
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:02,560
was only having like certain ones were drifting and then eventually everything started drifting.

667
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:06,960
So, and I just, by that point it had been too long and I was like, okay, I don't know how to

668
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,080
change this to say, no, it's not the right Joy-Con, it's the left Joy-Con. And

669
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:16,000
it was, I didn't trust that, you know, it was going to be done quickly. So I just went ahead and

670
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,480
hit the bullet and instead of replacing them, cause they're like $79, replace a pair. It's just

671
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:27,760
stupid in the first place. I don't know. We'll see. All right. Well, we'll see what develops

672
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,840
as I'm sure this litigation is going to continue over the next seven years. You know,

673
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:36,800
by the time they won a hundred matches, they won't give Zelda away for free. They'll get

674
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:41,120
one, two, switch for free. Haven't we suffered enough? Haven't we suffered enough? Why would

675
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:48,240
they do that? I'm like the accuracy of that statement. I fucking hate it. Send it back.

676
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:55,600
Oh man. All right. Well, can't play one, two switch if you have a broken controller.

677
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:04,800
All right. You don't want to. All right. Anyhow. Bobby Blackwold in chat says Xtafur posted on

01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:10,000
Twitter and said that the baby game in one, two switch is the most realistic game ever made. Oh

679
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,640
yeah. It's, it's a, a Braum is one month old today. I don't know if you know that. So Xtafur is

680
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:21,360
enjoying the dad life. So, all right. Anyway. Let's move on. We have more stories to get to.

681
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:27,200
And boy, I have a lot of difficult news tonight. There's no easy way to say it. And I don't want

682
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:31,920
to make light of this either because this news is terrible. And it's another huge loss in the

683
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,320
World of Warcraft community. I have to admit, I did not know this individual. I didn't have

684
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:41,680
a personal connection to this person as the person I just talked about a minute ago. But I know a lot

685
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:46,480
of people really respected this person. And I know he was somewhat of a pioneer of sorts,

686
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,080
I think, when it came to streaming and so forth in the World of Warcraft community.

687
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:57,680
His online name was Reckful. His real name was Byron Bernstein. I hope I said that right. I'm

688
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:04,960
very sorry. But unfortunately, the news came this week that he passed away. And this came from his

689
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:11,120
ex, Blue, and a close friend of his, Andy Milonakis, who, if I'm not mistaking,

690
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:16,640
had an... That's the same guy that had an MTV show. So anyway, I mean, people are people. And

691
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:20,640
I'm not like... This is horrible what they're going through. They lost their friend. I am not

692
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:25,200
about to make light of this in any way or another. But I think it also goes to show,

693
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:30,000
number one, people are people. Celebrities are people. People you remember as kids are people.

694
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:36,400
People that stream on Twitch for your entertainment are people. And everybody

695
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:42,480
goes through their own ups and their downs and their challenges and all of this. So anyway,

696
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:51,120
a lot of nice words and things that were said on Twitter. Things like, I wish we could have

697
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:56,000
helped you. We all do. I'm sorry I couldn't. Thank you for being a part of my life.

698
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,320
Heartbroken, still in shock. I feel a little awkward reading these quotes on air. I'm sorry.

699
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,640
It's a little... Because these are people's personal feelings, even if they did post them

700
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:09,600
publicly. And it's a lot of... Obviously, a lot of emotions people are going through that they're

701
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:16,320
trying to deal with and so forth. But you put it all together, and it does seem like, allegedly,

702
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:24,480
he may have taken his own life. And that's extremely devastating,

703
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:28,240
especially when paired with some of the other things that have been going around Twitter,

704
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:35,360
such as, because he has been a streamer for so long, there was a video floating around out there

705
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:40,240
from several years ago, from 2016 or something. And chat, feel free to correct me, because I'm

706
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:44,640
going off my memory, and my memory ain't always so great. But I wanna say, in this clip,

707
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:53,040
a chatter was basically saying, you should kill yourself. And he was reacting to that. And

708
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:00,400
he was able to roll it off and so forth. But you could tell for a moment, there's a part of that

709
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:09,760
that got to him. And it's just tragic that people would go there in the first place. And we really

710
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:18,400
have to take a good, hard, long look at the way we treat people on social media and on Twitch,

711
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:24,320
and the way that we treat these people that we watch on Twitch. And I'm pretty sure this

712
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:30,320
audience that's watching this show, after getting to know all of you, probably don't need to be told

713
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:35,440
this. I'm saying it anyway, because you never know. I'm gonna have a stranger watching tonight,

714
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:41,520
somebody might be lurking who's done this before. But when you say something like,

715
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:47,120
kill yourself to a stranger on the internet, those sorts of words carry a lot of weight.

716
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:55,440
And you can't just go throwing it around like it's LOL. I was just kidding. Because you don't

717
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:01,200
know people's lives. You don't know what they're going through. And I think it's up to the rest of

718
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:07,280
us who do try to conduct ourselves with integrity and try to keep things generally positive and keep

719
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:11,760
the negatives to criticisms, but constructive ones and so forth online. I think it's up to the rest

720
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:19,920
of us to call out bullshit behavior when we see it. And stick up for the streamers and so forth

721
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:28,640
that we respect online. And all of that. Anyhow, it's really tragic because Reckful was only 31

722
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:33,360
years old. That's incredibly young. Younger than me, younger than Loki, anyone on this show.

723
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:39,520
He was a streamer and game developer. He used all those hours streaming World of Warcraft

724
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:45,920
to start to make his own MMO, Everland. He had been open about struggles with depression and

725
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:51,600
mental health, which is a very brave thing to do. Not everybody is able to do that. And I'm sure he

726
01:04:51,600 --> 01:05:00,800
was surrounded by love and support and so forth. Unfortunately, like any disease, treatment doesn't

727
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:07,200
always end up being 100% effective. And God, I hope that really doesn't sound... I'm really

728
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:14,560
not trying to minimize or make this horrible loss sound any less. But my point is that we have to be

729
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:21,360
there to help people realize that people go through this and not mock people for this or

730
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:27,760
challenge people with this. Like, are you sure you have this? Well, depression is just a myth to sell

731
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:33,760
medication. We have to really watch our language in challenging people that are very open with

732
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:39,520
these types of struggles and so forth. Because again, you're not in somebody else's shoes. You

733
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:47,280
don't know what they're going through. And most of all, stop bullying people online. On Twitch,

734
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:52,640
on Twitter, on Facebook. Because when you tell somebody KYS, that's what you're doing is you're

735
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:58,640
bullying. And that behavior sucks and needs to stop. Sorry, I've been looking away from chat for

736
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:04,480
a little bit. So I haven't seen you guys commenting on this. But as Joe and Hunter Matt says,

737
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:08,480
Reckful would talk about battles with depression on a stream all the time in an effort to help

738
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:12,880
others battling it as well. Sadly, he lost his own battle. And I think that's why this is this news

739
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:17,360
may be affecting a lot of people. And why we're seeing a lot of people really pour out their

740
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:23,200
feelings on Twitter is I would bet there are many people, not only that we're just fans that enjoyed

741
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,960
his streams enjoyed his content, but there's also many people out there that could probably relate.

742
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:34,320
And it's it's hard to get, you know, I just went through an emotional bit a minute ago,

743
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:38,400
because somebody that I felt I could call a friend went through something terrible this week.

744
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:43,040
And I bet there were many people that felt they could call Reckful a friend as well.

745
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:50,880
Rican Elite in chat says, Hey, it's been a crazy week for real in the internet. It has been a

746
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:57,840
crazy year. And it's only July. It's been a crazy decade. And it's only 2020. Like I hear you it's

747
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:05,360
it's who who really continues as we need to listen to people out there because they might seem all

748
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:10,080
good online and happy but deep down inside they are hurting. Tiger Claw says basically,

749
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:14,160
it's best to be nice to them. They may say something stupid, but don't be mean to people

750
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:20,320
for saying dumb shit. Yeah, educate don't berate as to 100. Matt says I was going to mention

751
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:26,080
Etika hope I said that right. Anthony Bourdain were all public figures that performed in front

752
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:31,920
of a camera. A lot of their pain was behind the scenes. Hype Mayhem in chat says I've dealt with

753
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:37,040
depression for years. There have been times where it's damn near killed me. Thank you for being

754
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:41,600
brave and saying that and let me be the first of many people in chat to tell you I'm glad you're

755
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:46,880
still here with us. And I hope you will continue to be here with us every Sunday. And there's many

756
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:57,440
of us that would be happy to listen if you ever needed it. So anyhow, who? Yeah, as Jonah Matt

757
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:01,920
says we're dealing with a very hard time this year for some it's harder. Check in with folks

758
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:08,560
and do it often. And I think it's something not even I think I know it's something with this whole

759
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:15,600
pandemic and what it's done to like all of us. That is just really heightening everything right

760
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:21,840
now. And we're seeing it play out in all of these different ways. You know, and some of them have

761
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:26,960
been things that have been a long time coming, such as they're addressing racial justice in this

762
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:33,440
country and inequality and those things. That has been something that has been unfortunately,

763
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:37,280
well, you know what I mean? Fortunately, but unfortunately, right? A long time coming, right?

764
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:42,080
Like we need to have this discussion and we're going to have it now. And something about the

765
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:49,120
pandemic has really just escalated all of that. And you know, now it's mental health. Last week

766
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,880
on the show we talked about and unfortunately, we're going to talk about again on tonight's

767
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:58,400
show in a little bit because it hasn't stopped is the game industry having to address some of its

768
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:05,040
own problems with people in power. And people need needing to be removed from power as a result.

769
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:12,400
Like this is just it's a hell of a decade. But I think as many would say, you know, whereas some of

770
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:18,320
this is extremely tragic, such as the loss from COVID that is unnecessary, such as the loss of

771
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:23,680
our friends dealing with mental health issues that are only heightened by this whole situation

772
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:29,600
that's going on with quarantine. But then there's also that side of it that you know what, finally,

773
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:35,360
we're having discussion on racial injustice and equality. Finally, some of these abusers and

774
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:40,480
people in power that need to be taken out of power, we're finally talking about that. So there's a

775
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:45,760
little bit of there's a little bit of nice and a little bit of not so nice, you know, or I shouldn't

776
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:50,720
say nice, like, I'm really struggling with the correct words tonight. Please forgive me. I'm

777
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:57,600
human. A lot of I would say like, like things that will be long term positive, long term positive

778
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:05,600
coming out of this. And things that are immediately very negative. So anyhow, who fat ninja DM in chat

779
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:12,800
says, he hugs for all who need it. Yes, please hand them out. Rick and elite says, yes, depression

780
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:16,400
is horrible, been going through it for years and thought drinking would solve the problem,

781
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:20,960
but made it worse finding a good support group and a good community to guide you to the right path

782
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:26,480
and keep you positive and strong. Always a help. I hope that's you saying you you've found sobriety

783
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:32,240
and congratulations to you. If that is the case, and stick with it. And there's a lot of people out

784
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:36,320
there that will help you through it and finding the right group for that is yes, a big part of

785
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:43,120
that for sure. Okay, who heavy topics tonight. And now we've got one more right low key.

786
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:49,840
Yeah, we're gonna have a nice light topic about you know, abuse allegations coming out of the

787
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:54,480
I can't evo I can't even laugh. It's not funny. Like it's just it just no, it's just thought.

788
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:04,480
So yes, apparently there's been allegations of sexual misconduct from about their previous CEO,

789
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:10,880
Joey Mr. Wizard seller. And so these were made not to be convenient. I'm not I'm not

790
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:16,480
kidding. I want to be clear not to be confused with the Mr. Wizard that was on television in

791
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:22,800
the 80s. Okay, because when I hear Mr. Wizard, there will be no other Mr. Wizard than Don Herbert,

792
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:27,280
okay, in my opinion, even if he probably didn't like having to do that show with children,

793
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,880
but it doesn't matter. He taught me a lot about science and I was growing up to a lot of people

794
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:36,560
on Nickelodeon. I just want to make sure we're all very clear. Not that Mr. Wizard. Okay,

795
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:44,960
but somebody who who dared to take that name who dared to take and we continue looking.

796
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:52,880
So apparently this was made after one of the one of the veteran competitors, Mikey crack prawn

797
01:11:52,880 --> 01:12:00,000
fam, who accused Joey seller of preying on teenage boys at Southern hills golf land,

798
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,600
which was where they had a lot of these different meetups for some of the fighting

799
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:08,480
game tournaments in Southern California. I've been to it was a big music game meetup

800
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:12,880
back in the day too. You've probably been to right Southern hills. I not not to that one.

801
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:16,720
I've been to it. They did close it. They closed it earlier than a lot of the others.

802
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:23,520
But I've I've been to Southern hills golf land, which is no longer there. It's condos now,

803
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:29,280
I think. Don't think I've been to that one. But no, there's there's been other ones. But yeah,

804
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:34,720
not that particular one. But apparently, he described multiple instances taking place in

805
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:43,760
the early 2000s, where he used the gifts of arcade tokens to bribe teenage boys to do,

806
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:50,240
you know, inappropriate things. And yes, we'll just leave that. So during that, of course,

807
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:58,160
after that, you know, these allegations were made, basically just kind of was a chain of events. So

808
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:06,800
you had starting off with a bunch of participants dropping out of Evo online. So including Sonic Fox,

809
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:19,360
SKD, Yohosi, Lord Knight and Seijam were all dropping out of it. And then once you had the

810
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:24,800
big competitors dropping out, then following Stute, you had the actual companies dropping out.

811
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:30,800
So starting you had them fighting herds pulling everybody wanted to distance themselves from a

812
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:35,760
pedophile. Can we say we're surprised? No. Yes, exactly. So yeah, every everybody,

813
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:41,120
all of the big game companies pulled their games out of there because they don't want to,

814
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:46,480
you know, they're standing in solidarity, they want to be involved with that. And I would have

815
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:51,520
ran away too. I don't blame a single person or company with with all the games and all the

816
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:57,760
competitors gone. They had to cancel Evo online this year. So with that, they're going to be

817
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:03,040
donating the equivalent of the proceeds promised to Project Hope. They've also

818
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:12,960
established a new CEO, Tony Cannon, who is I think he was the previous CEO or co sponsor or

819
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:17,040
something like that. He's going to be taking the leadership role and then the other guy is of

820
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:24,000
course not involved with Evo online at all in any capacity. So it's been a crazy week.

821
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:29,200
Tigerclaw in chat says, I honestly don't understand what drives these people to prey on

822
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:37,760
underage children, etc, etc. Tigerclaw like, good. You shouldn't understand that. And I think that's

823
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:44,080
what makes all of this so shocking is that nope, any reasonable person is not going to say, well,

824
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:50,080
that makes sense. Which is which is interesting, because I have, you know, and when we talk about

825
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:55,280
the whole like, cancel culture and all this, and how long do we give somebody like this,

826
01:14:55,280 --> 01:15:03,840
this isn't somebody's opinion. Okay. This is somebody's action, that actions that he's,

827
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:08,320
you know, and some, and I've seen the very interesting Twitter takes of it's been 20

828
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:12,240
years type of thing, but it's like, Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.

829
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:19,120
I know y'all hate my obsession with Drag Race, but there was a queen on it. I think it's in the

830
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:24,400
preview for next week. I think it was Alexis, sorry if I'm misattributing it, who says a quote,

831
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:30,800
and that is, what is in the darkness will always come to light, might be paraphrasing a little bit

832
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:37,280
there. But that's the point is that he's paying for it now because he didn't pay for it 20 years

833
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:44,640
ago. Look at that. Look at that guy here in our area, the Golden State Killer, maybe not

834
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:48,960
everybody out there has heard of it. But you know, Loki want to talk about right? That guy who lived

835
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:54,960
in my neighborhood when I was a child, apparently, who had killed a bunch of people in the 70s. I

836
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:59,520
don't know what I'm not all up on the serial killer stuff, like some of my friends. But he'd

837
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,920
killed a bunch of people and so forth. He was just recently arrested. Now, granted, he probably

838
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:08,000
hasn't killed anybody in like 30 years since the 80s or whatever. But he was recently arrested.

839
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,400
They had to have the trial at Sacramento State because the only place where everybody could

840
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:18,480
socially distance and all this stuff. And he, you know, is going to jail, pled guilty. And he's 80

841
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:23,360
now and he'll be behind bars forever. The reason why I bring that up. Well, do we just let him go

842
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:32,160
because it's been 30 years? No, of course not. No, we don't. Now, they probably, I don't know

843
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:37,280
what the statute of limitations on some of this stuff is. It doesn't matter for this, for this,

844
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:46,240
for this doesn't matter. There are none. And, you know, yeah, maybe it can't actually be tried in a

845
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:49,360
court because I go I get what you're going with that Loki like it probably can't actually be

846
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:54,480
tried in a court because of statute of limitations. But in in this particular court of, you know,

847
01:16:54,480 --> 01:17:00,560
people that want to associate and do business and give this person power. Everybody's having a

848
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:08,080
moment of reckoning saying, whoa, you don't deserve power. And that's that. Yeah.

849
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:18,400
So, oh, one of my one of my serial killer friend experts just joined chat. What a great time to

850
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:25,520
speak up. So, is that isn't just saying I'm obsessed with this guy. Yes, 70s and 80s,

851
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:30,320
also known as the East Area Rapist, Original Night Stalker, blah, all these nasty things.

852
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:34,480
But I mean, surely you also agree with my point I was making just because he's 80 years old.

853
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:40,000
And it all happened 30 years ago. That doesn't that doesn't suddenly make the issue go away.

854
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:48,400
And it's it's the same with this individual. And this person is being unceremoniously removed from

855
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:53,040
the gaming industry. And that's how it should be or wasn't still doing it. Like, I don't think

856
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:58,240
it was just like, oh, yeah. And then he stopped because he grew out of it. I mean, like,

857
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:04,720
I'm sorry. Yeah, we don't know. Yeah. So, let them investigate.

858
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:12,480
So, I imagine EVO will come back next year with new people at the helm and so forth. And,

859
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:20,160
and, you know, COVID won't be hopefully knock on wood an issue next year and things can attain

860
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:25,840
somewhat a sense of normalcy. But I mean, this is the purge that's happening in the gaming

861
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:29,680
industry right now. Yeah.

862
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:35,520
And just like I said a moment ago, something about this year, it's dragging it all out.

863
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:43,120
So, those of you still hiding in the dark, look out. All right. Anyhow, let's move on,

864
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:47,120
shall we? Yeah. All right. What do you have for us next, Logie?

865
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:53,760
So, let's talk a little bit about greed and the game industry.

866
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:59,360
I'm so sorry, Logie. I just, I have to reiterate this point in chat because I think it's so good.

867
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:04,160
And a nice little like uplifting, hopeful thing to end on. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

868
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:12,720
teach your kids not to be a creep. And yes, that part. It is, you know, maybe our generation

869
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:20,080
is really screwed up. But the best thing we could do is teach the next generation

870
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:27,360
how to not make the same mistakes. And I think that's a nice like, what can I do to help?

871
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:35,200
Help the next generation not have to deal with it. Anyway. Okay. Sorry. I just thought that was

872
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:42,480
a very good note to end it on. Logie, continue. So, it's been found out that apparently

873
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:50,960
the next NBA 2K game, NBA 2K21 on next gen consoles is going to be more expensive

874
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:57,840
than your typical game. So, they're going to be charging $70 for the brand new game coming up.

875
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:07,360
They're basically trying to, a PR spokesman for Take-Two said that, we believe our suggested

876
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:13,920
retail price for NBA 2K21 on next generation platforms fairly represents the value of what's

877
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:18,960
being offered. Power speed technology, and that's only possible on our new hardware.

878
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:31,520
So, right now, the suggested retail price is $69. I think it's more testing the waters to see if

879
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:39,680
they can get that. And I know that I've seen a lot of folks compare this to, well, hey, when I

880
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:47,680
was buying like Super Nintendo games and stuff like that, they were like $79, $89, $90 or older

881
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:51,440
games like on cartridges were more expensive. Right. Because they were on cartridges and you

882
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:54,960
were paying for all the chips inside of them. That's why Neo Geo games are so fucking expensive

883
01:20:54,960 --> 01:21:00,320
because those games are gigantic. You're paying for all those chips. That may be true in a sense,

884
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:06,160
but let's just not be confused here. The games you're buying nowadays, you're not paying $60

885
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:12,880
for them. Sure. $60 may be the price to purchase the disc or purchase the initial download,

886
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:17,680
but then there's the season passes. There's all the microtransactions in there. There's all the

887
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:24,400
DLC that they're adding in there. And I get it that a lot of it is additional content,

888
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:28,800
but there's also a lot of content that is normally included in these games. And you can't tell me

889
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:33,760
that they haven't, they're not planning to put this stuff out. A lot of these games that you'll

890
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:38,960
have features that were in a previous version of the game, and then they're separating it and

891
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:49,600
selling it to you piecemeal in the later versions that come out. And NBA 2K, the game that last year

892
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:57,360
was just blatantly, they have like gambling loot boxes in these things. You can't tell me that

893
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:00,560
they're not going to be making, and then they've already said they make billions of dollars on

894
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:07,600
these loot boxes. Why is it that they need an additional $10 to put this game out? They don't

895
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:12,720
need it. They make tons of money on it. And I get it additional development costs because of higher

896
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:18,240
fidelity graphics and sound and whatever. They're still making tons of money off of those

897
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:23,840
microtransactions and they don't need the additional money, but it's an excuse to try to

898
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:28,800
raise those prices so that they can get more money because why not get more money if you can?

899
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:37,760
So I think we're going to see some folks, some companies try to do this. And I think if there's

900
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:42,480
not a huge backlash to it, you're going to see a lot of other companies start to follow suit

901
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:46,400
because that's what they did with the Xbox 360 and that generation. And they're like,

902
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:51,280
well, you know, these games, they have better graphics. And so it's going to take a lot more

903
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:57,840
manpower to put these games out. And that's why we need to charge more money. It's an excuse.

904
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:04,800
I have some similarities to what you're saying, Loki, but I find that I'm comfortable with the

905
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:12,800
idea of a $70 price tag for the AAA game, for the high end, you know, premier showcase games.

906
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:19,600
I think things have become so warped since the cartridge era because in the cartridge era,

907
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:26,000
a $999 game was practically unheard of unless it was like, you know, on sale a thousand times over

908
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,680
or some type of like corporate trash or something like a $10 game. What sneak king was like a $10

909
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:36,160
game on the Xbox 360. But those games, you know, those games were like few and far between, right?

910
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:43,520
My point is, is that number one, games really aren't all one price anymore. Games are on this

911
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:49,200
sliding scale. And what a company really has to figure out is what is my game worth, right?

912
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:53,040
Because like, for example, I mentioned Allen's playing Dark Souls again on the Switch. And the

913
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:57,040
first thing I said is I said, so you paid 60 bucks to play Dark Souls again? He's like, no,

914
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:00,720
it's only like 30 or 40. And I was like, oh, okay. That makes sense.

915
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:05,760
Like, I get it. Like, I guarantee you that they, the excuse may be like, they're going to have all

916
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:11,120
sorts of excuses that they use. It's going to be that, oh, we need more money for server costs.

917
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:15,040
We need more money for development and stuff like that. But I guarantee you when you look at the

918
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:20,480
actual employees that they're hiring and who they're keeping and how much they're paying them,

919
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:25,040
that is not going up at all. If anything, it's the money is going to the CEO.

920
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:29,600
To some extent, I would permiss the additional develop costs when it comes to, you know,

921
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:34,000
making 4k graphics and doing everything that comes into a AAA experience and so forth.

922
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,440
I'm not dismissing your points, Loki, because I do think they're valid. And especially when you

923
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:42,800
talk about like the loot boxes on top of that and everything else, I think that is really up to us

924
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:47,360
what we have to evaluate as buyers and companies do need to be upfront with this.

925
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:52,080
The ESRB needs to require them to be upfront with this, which good news they do now,

926
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,560
because we have that whole, you know, what did they end up calling it?

927
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,520
Well, they'd have ways to get around it though. They have ways. I mean, look at,

928
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:01,600
look at perfect example, not actually, I'm sorry, not take two that did it this time,

929
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:07,920
but it was Activision. So Activision, they printed their copies of Crash Bandicoot,

930
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:12,560
the remake that they did, and they did not have loot boxes on there. So on the packaging,

931
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:17,440
it doesn't have to say that there's loot boxes. They added it, they patched it in later on,

932
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:22,000
it updated on the ESRB website, but I don't think they have the reprint in any of their packaging

933
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,400
that said that there's no loot boxes in there. So it, they have ways to get around it. They

934
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:31,840
purposefully patches stuff in later, so it doesn't get caught in the early reviews that go out.

935
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,760
So because people try to stay away from that stuff.

936
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:40,960
We as gamers are kind of getting smarter to those types of tactics too, and kind of have our ways

937
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:45,520
to deal with that. And I kind of think that's all going to like work out in the end. My point is

938
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:50,320
like, like, I feel like a Final Fantasy 16 or something, if they charge me 70 bucks for it,

939
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:56,240
I'm probably going to pay it. And, you know, because, and we've been saying, and I've said

940
01:25:56,240 --> 01:26:00,640
on the show before, you know what, I would rather instead of you having all these loot boxes,

941
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:05,520
and all these other ways to nickel and dime people, just, just charge 70 bucks for the game,

942
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:09,520
and give me the game you, you know, you want to make. And I'm willing to stand by that earlier

943
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:12,720
comment and pay 70 bucks for the game, if it's a well-rounded game.

944
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:17,200
So here's, here's another thing, and this didn't make our show roll, but, uh, I did want to bring

945
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:25,200
it up. So earlier this week, the House of Lords actually ruled in the UK that loot boxes are

946
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:30,960
gambling, and should be regulated as such. So in the UK, that's how they're, they're seeing these

947
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,960
now. And they're basically seeing that because of the way that they're being monetized, and the way

948
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:42,160
that they're being marketed, and it, it's basically gambling, and they have to be regulated

949
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:46,960
as such. So I think that maybe they can see the writing on the wall, and that the, their gravy

950
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:52,160
train of loot boxes is kind of going away. And so maybe this is why they think that they need to

951
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,800
raise the price of the games, because they're not going to be able to do that. In which case,

952
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:59,520
I'm fine with that, as long as I don't have to have my game like rebalanced, because they're

953
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:03,680
trying to sell me a bunch of garbage I don't want to necessarily buy. And there are lots of games

954
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:09,280
that they build and rebalance based on that, that make it more grindier to, you know, stretch out

955
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:14,640
the experience. There was that Lord of the Rings games that they had not too long ago, that they

956
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:20,080
completely had to rebalance the whole game after they patched those out, because it was just such

957
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:25,120
a grind fest. I want to say even maybe some of the Forza games and stuff had a little bit grindy,

958
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:31,760
grinder aspects to them, because they were selling their in-game currency for that as well. But

959
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:35,760
there's a lot of games that they modeled based on that, to make them more grindier so that you

960
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:41,200
buy these loot boxes. And it's a big business. PodCulture's brought up a good point in chat,

961
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:46,240
and this thought crossed my mind too. PodCulture says that twitch.tv slash vog network,

962
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:53,200
make physical 70 and keep digital 60. You know, that thought's crossed my mind too, is,

963
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:59,360
you know, I feel like the game industry, for many people, the industry would love nothing more than

964
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:04,880
to lose the physical thing completely and go completely digital. And there are many games that

965
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:09,040
are completely digital. I mean, that's pretty much how the indie stuff thrives, unless you're

966
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:14,160
lucky enough to get one of those limited run game things. But not every game gets that, like almost

967
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:19,040
everything indie is digital and it's working out fine. And I almost feel like the industry would

968
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:24,480
really prefer things to go that way. You kind of saw that with some of the Xbox One stuff that

969
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:29,600
they had to backtrack, right? So, yeah, but do we know how much of the, how much, because I don't

970
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:34,880
know the numbers off the top of my head of what's digital versus what is being sold physical out

971
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:38,800
there. Granted, I know that they would like to see it go more digital because that's more money in

972
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:44,640
their pocket, but I think retailers like GameStop, a lot of these big box stores, Walmart, you know,

973
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:50,400
retailers online, I don't think that they have any interest in that going to an all digital format.

974
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:55,280
Considering that they don't, but the writing's been on the wall for them for a long time and

975
01:28:55,280 --> 01:29:02,160
they all know it's coming. They all look at big players. They, they drive, they drive what these,

976
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:08,000
these industries do because they have such pull with that. That's why that they can do the things

977
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:14,800
that they do. Um, I, I just have a thing cause who's selling these systems for them. They have

978
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:20,080
to rely on these retailers to make money. And if they're going to, you know, screw them out of like

979
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:25,440
sales because they're charging more retail. I mean, that's just a suggested retail price.

980
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:29,520
They don't have to necessarily sell it for that price. They can always sell it lower, but

981
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:35,760
I don't see them doing that. I see them, they'd have to be parody across all, all formats, you

982
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:43,280
know, just because it would be confusing for one. And for the second one is that they don't want to

983
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:46,880
burn those bridges with these partners because they still need the function of selling. They

984
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:50,560
can't sell them direct right now. I mean, they could, they could try selling these systems direct,

985
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:57,440
but I, they don't, they need them. Unfortunately. I can actually see that. And I, I get that. I

986
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:02,000
think this is already happening though, and will continue to happen is that the game comes out,

987
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,600
everything is in parody, dah, dah, dah, just like you said, but then six weeks later,

988
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:14,480
here comes the first sale and the digital version is marked off 20%. So with a $70 price point,

989
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:19,760
let's say that they do raise at the same price dollars and not everybody's on board with jumping

990
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:25,840
into that price. I think that the scrutiny on those gains is going to be much higher because

991
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:34,000
if you have everything at $60 and NBA two K 21 comes out at $70 and NBA two K 21 ends up being

992
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:40,720
like WWE two K 20, where it's just a piece of garbage. That's all like rushed and buggy as hell

993
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:47,200
that is going to come down really hard on them. So I, I caution them doing something like that.

994
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:51,200
They're just going to do whatever they're going to do.

995
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:53,920
All right. Well, for time's sake, I'm going to move on to the next story,

996
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:58,240
but, um, I do think this is a conversation that's going to definitely come up again.

997
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:01,520
If, you know, again, we're, we're going off a little bit of speculation here. I mean,

998
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:04,880
there, there does seem to be some proof in the pudding and so forth, but you know,

999
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:09,120
if we have to continue this games, face that reality, the games, the next generation are

1000
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:13,120
going to be 70 bucks for the high-end stuff. We'll continue that conversation later on.

1001
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:16,080
Just everybody kind of has to start thinking that this is a possibility.

1002
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,640
One last thought real quick. And I just want to put out there. So another thing with a $70

1003
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:24,880
price point games is that you're also not just competing against other games out there,

1004
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:29,600
but you're competing against services like games pass, where I'm going to be getting all of like

1005
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:34,480
the AAA games that are coming out from Microsoft and all these other games studios for like 10

1006
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:39,040
bucks a month. So, and truthfully low key, I think that's where it's all headed.

1007
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:43,840
Like Nintendo will get away without doing it because they can always be last to the party

1008
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:49,680
and somehow still be fine. But I, I kind of feel like game pass, like that's,

1009
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:53,760
that's where the movie industry has ended up. Everybody's got their own streaming service and

1010
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,960
monthly service. That's where the games industry is going to end up too. Just give it a little

1011
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:04,800
more time. Yeah. All right. Anyhow, moving on and talking about a new offering from, from one of

1012
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:10,240
these companies that has their own service, although this is outside of that. Ubisoft

1013
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:15,840
is recently put out their own battle royale game, or at least it's in testing. You can kind of see

1014
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:20,400
it on Twitch right now, some streams for hyperscape. It is a battle royale, but it's a

1015
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:25,120
little more futuristic and first person take on the genre. I was watching a streamer play it

1016
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:29,680
earlier because right now, like if you watch a streamer play it, you have the potential to get

1017
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:34,560
the drop. So you can play the beta as well. I only watched for a little bit. But I was just

1018
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:38,080
kind of curious what the game was, but it's definitely got like that morphe. It kind of

1019
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:43,440
almost like. Looks like watchdogs in a way, not, not totally, but like has that futuristic kind

1020
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:48,640
of look to it, but they've got things like low gravity and people are like jumping super high

1021
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:52,400
and like, you know, kind of, maybe it's almost a little bit like crackdown in that regard. Might

1022
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:57,120
be up your alley, Logie. But is it, it was interesting, you know, kind of a different

1023
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:02,800
type of battle royale. You can play solo or in teams of three. I think the guy I was watching

1024
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:07,040
was playing in teams of three and there can be up to a hundred players in each match. You can

1025
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:11,680
revive teammates by if you're taking out another player, a respawn beacon appears. This is already

1026
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:19,040
baked into the game already. So yeah, also what's interesting about this. It also kind of integrates

1027
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:27,360
with Twitch. So you can actually vote, your Twitch fans can kind of like vote on what twist

1028
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:33,760
would be on the upcoming map and so forth. There is a crown cast extension available on Twitch and

1029
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:40,160
you get to impact the game in different ways by helping to vote for the next event, granting

1030
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:45,520
infinite ammo, revealing player locations. So that's kind of interesting. The technical test is

1031
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:50,160
running through July 7th. So by the time a lot of you hear this on the podcast, it may already be

1032
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:54,160
over, but I believe the full launch of the game, I thought I heard on the stream today, they were

1033
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:59,200
saying the 12th, although that's not in the article I'm looking at now. But the full game

1034
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:05,200
will come out a little bit later. So kind of neat. Another, another battle royale contender,

1035
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:11,760
but this one is doing that interesting thing of doing the Twitch giveaways to kind of build the

1036
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:16,480
hype for it. And it is Ubisoft, which is a pretty big player out there and so on and so on. So it'll

1037
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:22,080
be interesting to see what develops there. So, all right, let's move on. Loki.

1038
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:34,240
All right. And so we've got some more news about Ubisoft, unfortunately. So they're going to be

1039
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:43,360
shaking up their editorial group, which right now is all white males. And now, of course,

1040
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:49,360
they, you know, being the focus on all of these different companies is diversity and inclusiveness

1041
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:56,560
that they're going to be changing that, of course, to make it more inclusive. So it's a situation

1042
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:01,840
that some of you have experienced or witnessed are absolutely not acceptable. No one should feel

1043
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:07,040
harassed or disrespected at work. And the types of inappropriate behavior we have recently learned

1044
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:17,600
about cannot and will not be tolerated. And this is coming from the CEO Eze Gamont. They sent an

1045
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:24,880
email to all of his employees in specifically says, I've decided to revise the composition

1046
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:30,560
of the editorial department transforming our human resources process and improving the accountability

1047
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:38,080
of all managers on these subjects. So it's interesting that they're doing this to kind of

1048
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:45,680
combat some of the harassment in the workplace. I don't remember necessarily the allegations here,

1049
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:52,160
but I do remember Ubisoft being brought up. I was gonna say, I think somebody at Ubisoft has

1050
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:56,880
been implicated in a lot of this and this might be Ubisoft's long-term response to making sure

1051
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:04,480
it doesn't happen again. Yeah, so. I mean, if we're gonna say, and we talked about this a couple

1052
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:09,920
weeks ago on the show when we were discussing a lot of these issues. If we're gonna say that

1053
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:16,000
everybody games, and that's something we, I think we all agree games are for everybody. Everybody

1054
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:23,760
is welcome to play video games. You have to have game makers. And I don't necessarily literally

1055
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:29,440
mean that, well, I do actually literally mean them and my long-term goal, the people that are

1056
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:34,720
on the board of directors and so forth, the people that are the financial side of that needs to also

1057
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:42,160
reflect. Everybody is welcome to play video games and not just one type of stereotype that has been

1058
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:45,840
that for years and years. Can we just run a business without harassing their employees?

1059
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:53,040
That would be great, but it might take this position and maybe we have to shake up and

1060
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:58,960
challenge the positions of power so that there isn't a structure set up in place that can

1061
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:05,840
incubate that anymore, if that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm not saying this of Ubisoft,

1062
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:12,800
but in a lot of places and culture and so forth, the boys club, right? We've got to break that

1063
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:20,400
shit up. And the way you break up the boys club is you bring in some women and so on and et cetera,

1064
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:26,480
and diversify things a little bit. So I think this will be a great long-term thing for Ubisoft.

1065
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,760
Yeah, hopefully. Hopefully it stops them from harassing people.

1066
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:41,840
It's also nice to see that there's a little more thought and action beyond so-and-so fucked up,

1067
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:47,600
can him. There's a little more. Well, there was people left, let go. So there was a guy

1068
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:53,440
but there's more. Yeah. There's more than that. There's how are we going to make sure it doesn't

1069
01:37:53,440 --> 01:38:00,720
happen again? And I think that's the happy news here is that Ubisoft is taking steps to

1070
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:08,880
how can we prevent this from happening again? Yeah. All right. Moving on. Let's get to

1071
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:11,840
our next story, which is sure to be buggy, right, Logie?

1072
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:20,240
Yes. So I've been trying to think about how they could possibly release a buggy TV show,

1073
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:24,560
but I'm sure if there's someone that's going to figure it out, it's going to be Bethesda.

1074
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:31,520
And Bethesda has announced that they're going to be doing a Fallout TV show. So they are,

1075
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:41,280
it's being produced by the creators behind Westworld. And they didn't really,

1076
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:44,080
it's supposed to be like, I guess it looks like it's an Amazon original.

1077
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:50,240
No word on necessarily what it's going to be. I mean, it's going to be about Fallout,

1078
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:55,680
but like, I don't know what the story is going to be about. It's being created by Lisa Joy and

1079
01:38:55,680 --> 01:39:03,040
Jonathan Nolan. And of course, those are the folks that were behind Westworld. And that's all we

1080
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:10,720
know right now. No release dates been given, but they did like a little teaser that kind of teased

1081
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:18,800
this whole thing coming out. I hope it's better than their last game that they put out. I mean,

1082
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:25,760
it's completely different. It's completely different creative minds to make a TV show

1083
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:32,800
and that can great. So, I mean, I have hopes that it'll be all right. And the Fallout universe is

1084
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:37,600
definitely pretty vast. And there's a lot of like stories that you could come up with. So I could

1085
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:42,240
see where it could be pretty cool. And I hope it is. Video games have kind of been winning in

1086
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:46,320
the TV show department too, in the past year or so between like the success of The Witcher,

1087
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:49,840
although obviously The Witcher was books too. But then the Castlevania anime.

1088
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:55,520
That's right. They're doing, I thought they're doing a Last of Us show that HBO is doing that,

1089
01:39:55,520 --> 01:40:00,000
I think. I think that's the thing too. Someone picking up Silent Hill or something,

1090
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,560
or maybe I'm thinking. I think there's rumors about a Silent Hill movie,

1091
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:08,880
but there's also rumors about a Silent Hill game. And anytime you have a beloved franchise,

1092
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:12,640
like Silent Hill, there's rumors that are following, but I don't think we have anything

1093
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:20,000
official in that universe yet. Fingers crossed. They're not quite Five Nights at Freddy's movie,

1094
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:30,720
but it's a Five Nights at Freddy's inspired movie starring Nicolas Cage. I'm sold. So,

1095
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:37,920
tell me. And it also kind of feels like nobody's making movies now. So it's interesting that this

1096
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:42,000
show gets announced, but it's like, well, they're not going to really be able to film it anytime

1097
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,560
soon, but there's also a lot that goes into a TV show before it gets filmed. They're going to have

1098
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:52,080
to cast it. They're going to have to write it. They're going to have to scout the locations and

1099
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:56,400
so forth. So there is a lot of steps that are going to be taken before they get to actually

1100
01:40:56,400 --> 01:41:03,600
shooting it anyway. Just hopefully, COVID's got all of Hollywood frozen right now. If it can't

1101
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:09,040
be done over Zoom, they're not doing it. Well, that's fine. After 2020, there'll be a literal

1102
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:13,920
wasteland, so they just won't have to... It's going to be similar to the writer's strike. Once

1103
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:19,280
COVID's over, you can expect things like Big Brother on CBS is going to fill up a lot of time

1104
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:23,680
in the immediate... Reality TV is going to boom again because those shows are quick and easy to

1105
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:29,360
make. And you'll probably see some imported shows for... Because it's all the same things that

1106
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:34,880
happened during the writer's strike. But we'll see. Again, we don't want COVID to keep on going

1107
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:41,280
and so forth. And who knows how long it's going to be at this point, but it just feels like the

1108
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:44,960
film industry is not going to get back to work before... Even though, I guess technically the

1109
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:51,040
film industry opened, but I don't think anyone is actually doing anything because, oh yes,

1110
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:55,760
the unions don't approve it. That's what's happening because COVID's back on the rise

1111
01:41:55,760 --> 01:42:01,360
and LA is one of the huge places for that. And even other places that they would consider

1112
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:09,840
shooting, it's on the rise everywhere. And then other places don't want them. They can't film

1113
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:17,920
Survivor in Fiji right now because Fiji doesn't want them. So it's going to take some time before

1114
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:22,720
this all sorts itself out and hopefully, knock on wood, we have a vaccine or effective treatment.

1115
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:27,040
And then we can talk about when those things are going to film again, which would include

1116
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:32,480
this show. But my long way of getting to this point, don't expect to see a single frame of

1117
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:37,360
this show until like 2022, right? Yeah, it'll be a while.

1118
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:42,480
Interesting. It'll go by super fast though, just like this year.

1119
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:47,840
Bobby Blackwell says the new Jurassic World movie is back on set in the UK.

1120
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:53,280
Really? I didn't realize they were shooting again, but I guess the UK has loosened a lot

1121
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:56,560
of restrictions as well. And I imagine if people quarantined for a little bit or whatever,

1122
01:42:56,560 --> 01:43:02,880
they're probably able to do it. And then Bobby says you'll start seeing shows like The Floor

1123
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:10,480
is Lava. Exactly. I did watch that.

1124
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:14,560
Did you? I haven't watched it. I watched the first episode of that,

1125
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:19,120
or like part of the first episode of that because it wasn't very good. It's just

1126
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:27,760
it's frustrating the drama that they try to instill in that show. And also it's like,

1127
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:33,840
I don't know, like it'd be better with kids doing it because, you know, it's totally like

1128
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:42,880
something like The Legend of the Secret Temple or whatever. I don't know. It's silly. It's a

1129
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:49,440
silly show. Orange Right in Chat says more game shows. Hey, if that means one of the first

1130
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:54,400
things back on air is going to be that new supermarket sweep, I'm down. Bring on game

1131
01:43:54,400 --> 01:44:02,800
shows. Hell yeah. Yeah. Don't threaten me with a good time. So, yeah. All right. Anyhow,

1132
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:09,040
bring back one versus 100. On Xbox. Absolutely. All right. Yeah. Let's move on. Speaking of

1133
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:14,320
things that we watch, let's talk about Nintendo and some of the things Nintendo has us watch.

1134
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:18,800
So Nintendo is talking about the Nintendo Directs. There was recently, of course,

1135
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:25,360
like a mini direct, but we never got anything that would be like an E3, Mondo, supersize,

1136
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:31,920
direct type of thing. So what in the heck is going on? Well, recently, Shintaro Furukawa was

1137
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:37,760
speaking to investors and was talking about that direct still feel like an incredibly effective

1138
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:43,680
way to present information. But in a somewhat vague statement, Shintaro Furukawa went on to

1139
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:49,520
say, inversely, times change, and so does the most effective way to promote products.

1140
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:54,560
So there is a chance that a new, better way to present this information comes about.

1141
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:59,520
So we always like to examine all of the possible ways to communicate this information to customers.

1142
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:06,880
So maybe they would do something that's not just a direct? Would we see more bite-sized type of

1143
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:12,240
announcements like what happened with the Mario? And we see more types of social media or the

1144
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:17,440
Paper Mario game that was recently revealed. And will we see more types of those social media

1145
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:25,760
reveals? I don't know. That's not like, that's not unique. That's I released a trailer. I mean, like

1146
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:30,640
you're not cutting edge Nintendo. You're not trying anything that everybody else hasn't

1147
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:37,600
already done. Ooh, you released a trailer on Twitter. Ooh, ooh, bravo for thinking inside

1148
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:41,840
the box. Like, I don't understand how that's any different than what everybody else is doing. And

1149
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:46,640
honestly, the directs were kind of a unique thing. Now everybody's kind of copied that and stuff.

1150
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:52,240
I can't really think what else they could possibly do that would be kind of different. But like,

1151
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:55,120
if that's the move that they're going to do, it's like, we're just going to do what everybody else

1152
01:45:55,120 --> 01:45:58,960
is doing. I mean, I guess it's worked for everybody else. They're doing what you're doing, so.

1153
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:04,720
I feel like Nintendo can really do whatever the fuck with A1. Like every podcaster,

1154
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:09,360
every Twitch streamer out there that has ever said anything critical about Nintendo,

1155
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:14,800
like, it's just Nintendo just goes, huh, and does their own thing. And it almost always,

1156
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:21,040
exception, we you, it almost always, it doesn't matter what any of these criticisms are.

1157
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:24,720
It doesn't matter that Nintendo's online is shitty. You know why? Because they have Animal

1158
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:30,800
Crossing. And it doesn't matter that you have to talk to the dodos, like through 5000 lines of

1159
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:36,240
text just to visit somebody else's island. Because it's Nintendo and it's Animal Crossing. Who cares?

1160
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:43,280
Like, Nintendo just gets away with it every time. Unless it's the Wii U.

1161
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Yeah, I don't know. I just,

1162
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:57,680
I really don't care what, I just want more news. Like, I would like to know what they're working

1163
01:46:57,680 --> 01:47:01,520
on. And right now, like, all I know is like, oh, hey, there's a game that's coming out soon.

1164
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:06,480
Well, there's a Metroid Prime 4 that they restarted. So, lord knows where that is right now.

1165
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:13,520
Time to port some of those old Wii U game, or hell, Wii games.

1166
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:17,120
I was gonna say, I think they've almost ported everything from the Wii U over that was worth

1167
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:23,200
porting. Oh, yeah. Well, the Wii, there's still the Wii. I mean, after all, I mean,

1168
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:28,560
it's Metroid Prime trilogy, right? I mean, the Switch is pretty much an Nvidia Shield.

1169
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:36,720
So, why not? All right, let's move on to a simpler time when there was no

1170
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:44,640
portability in the games like this. It's the classic game of the week. And every week,

1171
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:50,080
Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you brats should be

1172
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:54,880
checking this game out this week. It's time to dust this old school game off and give it a go.

1173
01:47:55,600 --> 01:48:00,000
This week, since Dark Sakura is not here, I have taken on the responsibility of choosing

1174
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,960
a classic game of the week. And I decided to pick something that is a little bit topical

1175
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:09,840
because it's a game that came up casually in discussion a couple weeks ago when, again,

1176
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:16,400
we were talking about these Namco collections that are coming out. And in the second collection,

1177
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:20,320
there's quite the variety of different Namco games. But then there's also a game in there

1178
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:26,160
where I'm like, I don't remember Namco ever being involved with this game. But that's because

1179
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:34,720
Broderbund published it here in the US. Namcot published it on the Famicom. And it's a game called

1180
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:42,400
Legacy of the Wizard. And that is my classic game choice for tonight. So, Legacy of the Wizard is

1181
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:51,920
actually a US or localized version of Dragon Slayer IV Dracy family. Now, the Dragon Slayer

1182
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:57,840
series is pretty big in Japan and gave us a lot of different types of games. Like, obviously,

1183
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:02,800
there were games that came out on the TurboGrafx, which were probably well known. There was also

1184
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:09,200
a game called Xanadu that was the second game in the Dragon Slayer series. And there was a spin-off

1185
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:17,120
to Xanadu that was Fa Xanadu or Fa Shanadu, Fa Xanadu. That game we ended up getting on the NES.

1186
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:23,680
So, it's interesting how this series kind of came and went and so forth through the different...

1187
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:33,600
In America, we kind of got one here, one there, but we never really got the entire series. Anyhow,

1188
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:36,400
so this is the one that I picked for tonight, Legacy of the Wizard, which was, again,

1189
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:42,320
Dragon Slayer IV when it was originally released, not just on the Famicom, but on the MSX and the

1190
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:47,120
MSX2. But I've picked the version that I remember on the Nintendo Entertainment System where it's

1191
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:53,360
called Legacy of the Wizard. In this game, it's actually an early example of a Metroidvania game,

1192
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:59,440
it really is. Now, maybe that's because Metroid was also a game on the NES and one could argue

1193
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:04,640
Metroid was a Metroidvania game. I would say it also has a lot in common with Goonies 2.

1194
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:08,400
For some reason, that's a lot of the vibe I get from this game, except you don't really have so

1195
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:12,080
much the parts where you're doing the indoor puzzles that were really infuriating in the

1196
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:16,160
old game. You do have indoor areas like inns and shops, but it's a little bit different. But I

1197
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:19,840
don't know why, but the overworld kind of reminded me of Goonies 2 a little bit and just the fact

1198
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:24,400
that you had these big sprawling maps that you went through. So anyway, in the game,

1199
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:29,360
you are trying to destroy an ancient dragon. The dragon's name is Keela and Keela is trapped in a

1200
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:32,720
painting. And so you'll actually... I don't know how long we'll let this footage that we're playing

1201
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:36,640
on Twitch go, but after about seven minutes or so, you actually see our character get to

1202
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:42,800
where Keela's at. It's a big painting in the ground. And to get to the painting or to unleash

1203
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:48,000
the dragon, you have to find the dragon slayer, which is a magical sword. There are four crowns

1204
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:54,000
protecting the sword. So there are essentially five family members that you play as. There's

1205
01:50:54,000 --> 01:51:00,160
also a grandma and a grandpa who are like the password system, but you also play as dad, mom,

1206
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:06,320
sister, brother, and pet. Little... And it's not like a dog or a cat. It's a little pink

1207
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:16,080
puff thing that you play as. So you use all five of those characters to essentially explore

1208
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:20,640
different parts of the underground. So on the Twitch video right now, we're looking at the dad

1209
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:27,680
character being played here. So the dad I think has like strength basically and is able to use a

1210
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:33,040
glove in a little bit that he's going to find here that will allow him to move bricks around.

1211
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:40,800
Okay. And the bricks are, you know, one area of the map has a bunch of bricks. It's a brick puzzle.

1212
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:47,360
So you need to use him to get through that part. And then later on, the mother has some weaker

1213
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:53,120
attributes, but she can use some really strong magic stuff. And so she gets a magical item you

1214
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:58,160
have to use to get to one of the crowns. And then I think the sister does like fireballs

1215
01:51:58,160 --> 01:52:04,240
or something. And the pet is really strong, but doesn't have a big range for their weapons. So

1216
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:07,280
they all have kind of like their pluses and negatives, right? It's kind of like Mario

1217
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:12,000
Brothers 2 in that regard, but you have to use certain characters to get past certain parts.

1218
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:16,880
And a lot of that is just trial and error to figure out what to do. Or you do what a lot of

1219
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:23,280
people did and you just read a guide online. In fact, I remember as a kid, one of the old,

1220
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:28,400
one of the letters I wrote to Nintendo Power Magazine was about this game. And they did

1221
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:32,720
answer the question in Nintendo Power Magazine. I'm not saying it was my letter because I'm going

1222
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:37,760
to say there were probably hundreds of kids that got frustrated by this fucking game, but it was

1223
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:41,440
enough of us writing Nintendo where they did actually answer some of the questions about

1224
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:46,320
how do I find the crowns or how, how do I make any goddamn progress in this game? I mean,

1225
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:49,920
I don't think I phrased it that way, but it's essentially what I was asking. How do I do

1226
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:54,160
literally anything in this game? And they answered that in an episode, excuse me,

1227
01:52:54,160 --> 01:53:01,680
an issue of Nintendo Power at one point. So eventually you get all four crowns by using

1228
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:07,200
each family member, except the brother type. And the brother is the one that can actually

1229
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:12,080
wield the sword who goes to slay the dragon. And tada, you slay the dragon. That's why you played

1230
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:18,080
a game called Dragon Slayer. So there it is. Anyway, this game was first released for the MSX

1231
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:25,280
2. It came out July 10th, 1987. Sometimes, and the Wiki article I'm looking at on this says that it's

1232
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:31,440
sometimes misattributed to a quintet production due to a reference in the ending credits,

1233
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:36,640
but Yuzo Koshiro, who is the composer, that's why the music's so fucking good in this game,

1234
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:42,240
confirmed that this is a coincidence. And Quinten actually didn't exist until 1989. Anyway,

1235
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:51,440
it was ported to the Famicom just a week later, July 17th, 1987. And then there was a Famicom,

1236
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:57,600
I guess the ending credits of the version showed that the Famicom port was developed internally

1237
01:53:57,600 --> 01:54:04,400
by Nihon Falcom, but apparently Compile somehow contributed this as well. It was published in

1238
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:11,680
Japan by Namco and then, of course, released two years later in 1989 by Broderbund on the NES as,

1239
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:16,160
of course, Legacy of the Wizard that we're looking at here. There was another version of this game

1240
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:21,280
years and years later. In 2008, a version of this game came out for mobile phones in Japan.

1241
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:28,800
So there it is. There it is, your classic game of the week, Legacy of the Wizard. And my parents

1242
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:33,680
bought me this game for one Christmas. It was probably Christmas of 89 when it came out because

1243
01:54:33,680 --> 01:54:40,480
my mom knew I liked the Dungeons and Fantasy Slayer type of games. And she said, when I looked

1244
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:46,880
at the box, it looked like something you'd like. And she was right. I was into it, even though it

1245
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:52,720
was an annoyingly hard game. And I think I ended up using passwords online or in magazines or

1246
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:58,240
however we did it back then to just skip my way straight to the final boss and do it that way.

1247
01:54:58,560 --> 01:54:59,840
Did you ever play this game, Loki?

1248
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:03,200
No, I have never played that game.

1249
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:08,080
It's a good game. Again, you have to remember, this is on the NES and it's a huge map.

1250
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:14,800
And again, I know we overuse the term Metroidvania sometimes, but those games were pretty few and

1251
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:20,480
far between on the NES unless you were literally Metroid or Castlevania II, which was kind of the

1252
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:27,440
Metroidvania-esque game on the NES. So games like this were really fun to discover. Looking at some

1253
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:34,240
comments in chat about this game, SSG100Matt says, I Game Genie this game for sure. Shehulk10

1254
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:40,160
with the Broderbund reference says, Print Shop was a great software package that they made as well.

1255
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:44,560
That is where most people probably remember Broderbund. I would say the Print Shop was a

1256
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:50,480
huge one. And then the other huge, huge game that they put out, they had an NES version,

1257
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:56,320
but it was also on many types of home computer systems was Lode Runner, L-O-D-E Runner. That

1258
01:55:56,320 --> 01:56:03,280
was a big Broderbund game too back in the day. And you know, you know what else Compile had a

1259
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:08,800
hand in that Broderbund published in the US? You know what other game that was? That's right. The

1260
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:16,720
Guardian fucking legend. So when I heard this game came out in the Namcock collection, I had a moment

1261
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:25,440
of, I had that gay gasp. Okay. I had the, could this mean that we could get the Guardian legend

1262
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:32,000
released in a collection? Well, Namcock actually published this game in Japan. So that's where I

1263
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:37,600
think we're able to see it here, but they, but, but they, they did release the same collection

1264
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:47,360
in the US. They were able to do that. So I, I don't know, maybe. Some other Broderbund memories

1265
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:53,120
in chats. Hype Mayhem says, I think Broderbund put out Raid on Bungling Bay too. That is correct.

1266
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:58,000
They did that as well. And Quest Motion says Broderbund also came out with everybody's favorite

1267
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:02,320
question. Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego? Very good call out. That was also a Broderbund.

1268
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:07,280
Broderbund definitely no longer in the business of publishing games though. I kind of always

1269
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:13,920
saw Broderbund more as a like utility company because of things like print shop and I guess

1270
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:18,160
edutainment like where in the world is Carmen Sandiego, but you know, they kind of got their

1271
01:57:18,160 --> 01:57:22,400
hands in a little bit with the NES stuff, but I don't think any of their games were a huge

1272
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:27,520
runaway successes on console. I think Lode Runner and Carmen Sandiego, those games are always kind

1273
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:35,280
of more personal computer-based games. So Broderbund was much more known in that space. So, oh wow,

1274
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:41,360
I, I'm forgetting all these greats. The original Prince of Persia was Broderbund and Myst. I didn't

1275
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:46,480
know that. I didn't remember Myst being a Broderbund game. That's a great call out there. So, huh, wow.

1276
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:54,640
Let's see, looking at, I just wanted to see real quick because I'm looking at, before we get back

1277
01:57:54,640 --> 01:58:02,960
in the news, I want to see, I think Compile just released the Guardian Legends themselves in Japan.

1278
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:10,240
No, Irem did. Irem released it to Japan, so sadly it wasn't Namco. But Nintendo themselves released

1279
01:58:10,240 --> 01:58:16,080
it in Europe, so anything is possible. Just game industry, I'm asking for one simple thing.

1280
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:22,080
The Guardian Legend. Bring it back. Let's, let's give that game to the love it deserves. That's all

1281
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:28,400
I want. All right, anyhow, let's move on. We have more gaming news to get to before we get to your

1282
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:32,640
questions and so forth in chat a little later in the show and your emails. I actually don't know

1283
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:37,120
if we have any tonight, but we'll look. Let's get to it. Loki, rapid fire news.

1284
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:49,360
Yes, okay. Let's see, so let's talk a little bit about NBA 2K again. So, NBA 2K20 and Rise of the

1285
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:56,240
Tomb Raider are going to be your free games that you get for PlayStation Plus in the month of July.

1286
01:58:56,800 --> 01:59:03,120
Also, they're going to be giving away a game called Erica as well. It's the bonus game because

1287
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:12,000
apparently it's PlayStation Plus, their 10th anniversary. Hooray! Okay, I mean, I ain't

1288
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:16,960
one to complain about an additional game getting thrown in. Yeah, so that's cool. And then speaking

1289
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:21,760
of games that were on PlayStation, Horizon Zero Dawn is going to be coming to the PC on Steam and

1290
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:28,000
Epic Games Store on August 7th. That'll be pretty cool. I don't know if I'll have to get this again,

1291
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:37,360
but it's gonna be bundled with the Frozen Wild expansion as well. So, pretty cool. I am curious

1292
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:43,120
to see how this looks on PC, I'm sure. And all the cool mods that they're gonna have.

1293
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:49,120
Yeah, that's the thing is I'm like, I don't know if I can really justify spending the money again

1294
01:59:49,120 --> 01:59:55,680
on PC when I already have it on PlayStation 4. I'm sure it's gonna look great on PC,

1295
01:59:55,680 --> 02:00:02,480
but you said the magic word there, mods. And I bet Alan will probably, because he loves to mod

1296
02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:06,160
games, if there's some good mods for that that come out, I imagine he's probably going to pick

1297
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:11,760
that up at some point. So, I'm very curious to see how the modding community wrecks that game,

1298
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:21,760
but in a good way. Yeah, they've got like improved reflections and they're gonna have dynamic

1299
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:28,320
foliage and I don't know, it looks pretty cool based on the trailer. It looks like a shiny

1300
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:34,880
coat of paint on it. Well, speaking of Sony-based things, the PlayStation. Sony PlayStation is the

1301
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:42,080
latest company to jump on with a boycott of ads on Facebook and Instagram. This according to a report

1302
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:47,920
by gamesindustry.biz. There's a lot of companies that have stopped advertising on Facebook recently

1303
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:54,960
and yeah, PlayStation is jumping on that as well. This is also an excuse for me to do that cheap

1304
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:59,920
plug that I finally pulled the plug. So, y'all know I went on a rant last week on Facebook games,

1305
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:04,400
right? So, I finally put my money where my mouth is, so to speak. I deactivated my Facebook on

1306
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:10,000
Thursday, Friday, I don't remember. And so, I'm detoxing from Facebook right now and again,

1307
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:15,920
it's my choice and I'm not saying I'm any better or worse and or anybody has to feel like they need

1308
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:21,840
to do the same thing. Because to be fair, I am still using messenger and a little bit of

1309
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:27,840
Instagram because like I can't pull away from messenger yet because it's how I actually get

1310
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:32,160
some gigs that are completely outside this whole video game thing that I do. So, I kind of

1311
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:38,240
can't pull myself. But even just pulling myself off of Facebook, those are less ads that can be

1312
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:43,760
served to me there. So, and I find just out of muscle memory, Loki, do you know how many times

1313
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:47,680
I just instinctively I'm putting like Facebook.com in my phone or on my desktop

1314
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:54,000
just like and I'm greeted with the login screen and I have to go, oh yeah, I deleted that or I

1315
02:01:54,000 --> 02:02:02,720
just deactivated that. So, yeah. Anyway, yeah. Bobby says, this means I control the vog network

1316
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:07,520
fan page exclusively. Yeah, pretty much. Understand. Understand. And Bobby says,

1317
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:10,960
wish I could do the same. I just unfriended a bunch of toxic people on both sides of the

1318
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:16,560
spectrum. Yeah. I just, it is out of control on Facebook. I'm not even talking about like

1319
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:22,000
friends and stuff. Although there's a lot of friends that are just going crazy. But it's

1320
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:27,280
just that it's Facebook culture. I think that's the only way I can put it. It's Facebook culture

1321
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:32,720
and the things that happen on public pages and stuff too and things that Facebook has no interest

1322
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:40,000
in trying to control or what. And I'm just like, you know what? I don't want to participate anymore.

1323
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:45,680
I'm gonna take myself out of this. And so, I have. So, we'll see. Some people are like,

1324
02:02:45,680 --> 02:02:49,360
oh, you're only gonna be able to make it last a couple months. We'll see. Spite is very

1325
02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:55,680
fucking motivating. Let's see. All right. Moving on. Other rapid fire news. Oh, this one's pretty

1326
02:02:55,680 --> 02:03:00,960
cool. So, Dark to See You brought this one to my attention. I think this is pretty neat. We love

1327
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:07,120
the hiddenpalace.org because that's the website where they find like deleted things in games and

1328
02:03:07,120 --> 02:03:12,880
old prototypes and old things. Well, they just released just in time for the 4th of July a

1329
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:21,760
mondo report about a Street Fighter 2 Championship Edition prototype from both March and July of 1993

1330
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:27,440
for the Mega Drive. This was the version that you may have seen in older magazines that were hyping

1331
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:32,320
Street Fighter Championship with the black bar at the top of the screen. The background didn't cover

1332
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:35,520
because if you look at most versions of Street Fighter, the background goes all the way top of

1333
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:42,160
the screen. In this early version, the black bar was at the top there where the health bars are.

1334
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:46,720
And then that ended up going away in the actual version that they released and it had the

1335
02:03:46,720 --> 02:03:52,480
background that went all the way to the top. So, it's a very large piece and it's really kind of

1336
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:57,840
gets into that basically for whatever reason, the first version of this was like stopped,

1337
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:02,640
thrown out, and a new one was started. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that

1338
02:04:02,640 --> 02:04:08,880
there was like some behind the scenes boardroom stuff with counter moves by what Capcom was doing

1339
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:14,240
with Nintendo and the turbo edition of the game that happened and all this stuff. So, it's a

1340
02:04:14,240 --> 02:04:20,160
fascinating read and I would have to spend an hour to go through all of it with you here on air,

1341
02:04:20,160 --> 02:04:23,840
but I thought it was really neat. So, I want to give that a plug over hiddenpalace.org

1342
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:29,120
because we like those little hidden gem types of things. It's pretty cool. So, all right, moving

1343
02:04:29,120 --> 02:04:32,960
on. That's it for rapid fire. So, let's do world release dates and talk about the types of video

1344
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:39,200
games coming to a store near you this week. First in the US, Loki. Not a whole lot. So, we've got

1345
02:04:39,200 --> 02:04:45,360
Catherine Full Body and Nintendo Switch, Subliminal on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1346
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:52,320
Looks like we've got Cross Code coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

1347
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:58,240
Bloodstained Curse of the Moon 2 coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

1348
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:05,520
Deadly Premonition 2, A Blessing in Disguise coming out on Nintendo Switch, F1 2020 on

1349
02:05:06,640 --> 02:05:14,400
PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Stadia, NASCAR Heat 5 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

1350
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:24,160
and last but not least, Sword Art Online, the Alakazation Lycoris on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox

1351
02:05:24,160 --> 02:05:29,120
One. All right, traveling over to Japan and looking at the releases there. Just a couple

1352
02:05:29,120 --> 02:05:34,480
things on the Switch this week. Blair Witch gets its localized multi-language edition released on

1353
02:05:34,480 --> 02:05:41,040
the Switch this week, as well as a Konami baseball game. eBaseball Powerful Pro Yaku 2020 comes out

1354
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:45,360
this week on the Nintendo Switch. And looking at the PlayStation 4 to see what's out there,

1355
02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:52,000
we have a few more things. Sword Art Online Alakazation Lycoris. I'm probably saying that

1356
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:56,400
wrong, but that game is out this week in Japan from Bandai Namco. Blair Witch also out on

1357
02:05:56,400 --> 02:06:02,960
PlayStation 4. That same eBaseball Powerful Pro is out as well. And those are the big games. Oh,

1358
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:09,840
there's one more game called Overpass that's also out on PlayStation 4 in Japan this week. And I'm

1359
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:15,200
assuming it's not talking about like a freeway Overpass. No, but it is a driving game. It looks

1360
02:06:15,200 --> 02:06:22,640
like you're driving Excite Trucks. You're driving the big dune buggies in a lot of dirt and woodland

1361
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:27,520
type of things. That's Overpass. So cool. All right. How about Europe? Dark Soccer is not here

1362
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:31,440
tonight. She has the night off. So, Loki, if you wouldn't mind filling in for her with the Europe

1363
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:38,080
release dates. Sure. So, we've got kind of the same type of stuff coming out over there. So,

1364
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:42,400
we've got Catherine Full Body on the Nintendo Switch. They're getting the Namco Complete

1365
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:50,240
Collection over there as well, also on Nintendo Switch. F1 2020-70 edition. That's on PC,

1366
02:06:50,240 --> 02:06:59,040
Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. We have the Story of Seasons, Friends of Mineral Town. And that's on

1367
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:08,240
Nintendo Switch. Hard West Collector's Edition on Nintendo Switch. Sword Art Online. The Alkaization

1368
02:07:09,200 --> 02:07:16,080
Lycros. Or Lycros, I guess that's how you pronounce it. It's a made-up word. PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

1369
02:07:16,080 --> 02:07:22,960
there. Guacamelee! One-Two Punch Collection on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. Deadly

1370
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:30,400
Premonition 2, A Blessing in Disguise on Nintendo Switch. And that's it. All right. Well, in this

1371
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:35,120
part of the show, we would typically open up the mailbag, which you can email us at participate

1372
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:40,480
at orangelaunchrader.com. And we read emails here on the air, but we didn't really get anything

1373
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:44,800
for on air this week. So, probably because we got a handful of things last week,

1374
02:07:44,800 --> 02:07:50,480
with last week having been the 18th anniversary show. So, a little more folks probably want to

1375
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:55,520
participate with that show. But just a reminder, you can send us emails if you, especially one of

1376
02:07:55,520 --> 02:08:00,000
the things I love that we get is sometimes we get like little mini reviews of games that we just

1377
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:03,760
didn't have time to get to on this show and talk about. And so, people will email us like mini

1378
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:08,240
reviews of games or something like that. And I'm all for more of those types of things. But

1379
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:12,320
anything that's on your mind you want us to bring up that we didn't discuss, or you want us to

1380
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:16,160
discuss a little more in detail, or you want to give your perspective on something, participate

1381
02:08:16,160 --> 02:08:20,880
at orangelaunchrader.com is the place to do it. And we'll see if we get anything next week.

1382
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:23,360
In the meantime, some more news for you guys. Loki.

1383
02:08:24,720 --> 02:08:32,560
Yes. So, apparently hackers are defacing some of the avatars in Roblox with Trump

1384
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:40,880
paraphernalia and also putting similar messaging in the profiles of these users as well saying,

1385
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:43,840
ask your parents to vote for Trump this year, MAGA 2020.

1386
02:08:45,680 --> 02:08:51,920
So, this is not profiles. Explain to me a little more because like, I can say anything I want in

1387
02:08:51,920 --> 02:08:57,520
like my online gaming profile, but you're saying they're like hacking stuff into the game, like

1388
02:08:57,520 --> 02:09:02,400
MAGA hats or something or what? Actually on these folks' profiles. So, like, you know how

1389
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:07,040
in your profile you can type little things and stuff there. So, they're changing what the avatar

1390
02:09:07,040 --> 02:09:11,680
is wearing. So, in Roblox, you have this like Lego looking character that you can dress up

1391
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:17,840
however you want. And so, they're putting the default avatar as wearing, since they don't really

1392
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:25,440
have any like Trump related shirts and like hats, they have to use like, for example, a running of

1393
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:35,760
the Bulls red hat. And it's just a, it looks like a MAGA hat sort of, but not quite. And then there's

1394
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:41,760
like a bald eagle in front of an American flag is like this shirt. So, that's kind of a stretch

1395
02:09:41,760 --> 02:09:47,920
there, but then like the, you know, little message that they put in all of the different profiles.

1396
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:53,920
So, like you can put a little message in your profile and that's what they put. It's not like

1397
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:58,800
they've really done too much. You can go and fix that stuff. And the thought is that it's only

1398
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:03,200
affected these accounts that have like weak passwords, which is a lot of these are owned by

1399
02:10:03,200 --> 02:10:09,520
like kids and stuff. They probably have really terrible passwords. Oh, okay. I get it. I get,

1400
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:14,640
because I'm like, this doesn't, like who fucking cares? Some nerds went in and did some weirdo

1401
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:22,160
profiles, whatever. But I get it. So, they've taken like established accounts and they're

1402
02:10:22,160 --> 02:10:28,720
basically hacking them to become, okay. Okay. I get it now. Yeah. You're right. Kids probably

1403
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:33,280
have some pretty, I know a lot of adults that have crappy passwords too. So, I'm not surprised,

1404
02:10:33,280 --> 02:10:38,160
you know, kids have pretty easily guessable things. So, teach those kids at a young age,

1405
02:10:38,160 --> 02:10:43,760
how to make a strong password. So, yes, definitely. Acronyms are a good trick that I teach.

1406
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:48,960
Acronyms are very hard to guess. But you have to, you have to think of like a song lyric or

1407
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:53,440
something that only makes sense to you. And it's much, like it's a thousand times stronger when

1408
02:10:53,440 --> 02:10:59,760
you can think of a song lyric from this song and this song. Take the acronyms, put them together.

1409
02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:04,320
And then it's much, because if you do all the same song, then somebody that maybe knows your

1410
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:07,760
password as an acronym of a song can figure it out. But it's going to be very hard if it's

1411
02:11:07,760 --> 02:11:12,480
two random things combined. That's the best type of password. Combine a bunch of random shit together.

1412
02:11:12,720 --> 02:11:19,920
So, all right. Anyhow. All right. Well, let's move on and talk about, hey, this is interesting

1413
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:26,160
because this came up earlier in the show. And this was about microtransactions for Crash Bandicoot.

1414
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:30,960
And apparently, they're getting called out already about, are you going to shove this

1415
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:38,080
shit into Crash Bandicoot 4 as well? Well, Toys for Bob, who is developing the game,

1416
02:11:38,080 --> 02:11:44,320
went to Twitter to say, not happening. We're seeing confusion about MTX microtransactions

1417
02:11:44,320 --> 02:11:50,560
in Crash Bandicoot 4 and want to be crystal clear. There are, all caps, no microtransactions

1418
02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:56,720
in Crash 4. As a bonus, the totally tubular skins are included in all digital versions of the game.

1419
02:11:57,680 --> 02:12:01,280
Now, this doesn't mean they can't change their mind later on.

1420
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:04,480
But I don't think- After those reviews come out.

1421
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:10,720
I don't think Toys for Bob did the other, or did they? Did they do the remasters?

1422
02:12:10,720 --> 02:12:12,960
I don't remember. I don't think they did.

1423
02:12:12,960 --> 02:12:15,040
It wouldn't necessarily be the developers.

1424
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:17,600
That's true. If Activision wants it, Activision.

1425
02:12:17,600 --> 02:12:21,680
Yeah. But maybe because of all that negativity or whatever. I mean,

1426
02:12:21,680 --> 02:12:24,960
it's a pretty bold statement to make. And certainly something like that,

1427
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:29,760
there are no microtransactions in Crash 4. Like, that statement's going to come back to haunt them

1428
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:34,160
if that ends up being not true because people are going to, quote, tweet that shit left and right.

1429
02:12:34,240 --> 02:12:36,400
Right? Yeah, I would think so.

1430
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:42,800
So, all right. Well, let's move on. Next story, Logie.

1431
02:12:44,080 --> 02:12:49,680
All right. So, this is something we kind of talked a little bit about last week,

1432
02:12:49,680 --> 02:12:56,480
at the end of the show, that there's a brand new mod out there or exploit for the PlayStation 2

1433
02:12:56,480 --> 02:13:04,400
that allows you to run games on burned DVD discs in your PlayStation 2 without a mod chip,

1434
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:10,720
without any sort of USB exploit or anything. It's just a way to burn your DVDs.

1435
02:13:10,720 --> 02:13:17,200
And so, it's this free DVD boot exploit that basically exploits the console's DVD player

1436
02:13:17,200 --> 02:13:22,240
functionality and triggers a corruption in the video playback and then runs the game through

1437
02:13:22,240 --> 02:13:27,840
that. So, you can use it for homebrew and whatnot. I don't know if they'd necessarily

1438
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:32,480
have it running like full actual games. Oh, apparently you can. Okay. Apparently,

1439
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:36,560
I see that there's people writing copies of Shadows of the Colossus on there.

1440
02:13:37,120 --> 02:13:40,640
So, does that mean I could also run like Japanese games on my US PlayStation?

1441
02:13:40,640 --> 02:13:42,960
Because that would be right. You probably could. Yeah.

1442
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:49,520
Because I bought a Japanese PlayStation 2 back in the day just so I could play Beat Media 2DX

1443
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:55,920
and the other Konami music games on my Japanese PlayStation 2. I might own like one non-thing.

1444
02:13:55,920 --> 02:14:01,520
Yeah. I would love to try this except for two small problems. Number one,

1445
02:14:03,680 --> 02:14:09,200
my laptop doesn't have a DVD drive or a DVD burner. I have an old laptop that does,

1446
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:15,040
but I'd have to dig it out. Number two, I don't believe my DVD drive in my PlayStation 2 works

1447
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:24,240
anymore. So, I'm kind of stuck there. I do have a hard drive for it and I do have

1448
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:32,240
a modded memory card, but I never quite got that stuff to work. And I just recently did that because

1449
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:39,200
I was attempting to... That was back when I was trying to put like PlayStation 1 step files for

1450
02:14:39,920 --> 02:14:45,440
DDR back on the cabinet, the edits and everything. And I never quite got that to work correctly.

1451
02:14:45,440 --> 02:14:49,920
So, I never bothered to try to see if I can get the backups of the games to work. And I don't

1452
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:54,480
know if I have like that, if they're still on that hard drive or anything.

1453
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:58,000
I was going to say, I have a working DVD burner if you need help.

1454
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:03,120
And like at this point, like I'm not even sure I would even try to like bother with it because

1455
02:15:03,120 --> 02:15:08,880
I don't think I have cables that would work with my TV as is, you know, an HD or anything.

1456
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:11,680
And I could just probably emulate that on the PC anyways.

1457
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:17,280
And as much as our minds are all going to, oh, I can play all the games, you know,

1458
02:15:17,280 --> 02:15:23,120
I couldn't before. And a lot of us, our heads are going, yay, piracy. I think Jason actually

1459
02:15:23,120 --> 02:15:27,600
addressed this in the intro tonight. And I think it's a very good point worth repeating is that

1460
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:33,280
this is great for preservation of games, you know, because like all our PlayStation 2s are breaking.

1461
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:39,840
So this might actually be a really good way to make sure that old games that may never come back,

1462
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:44,000
like, you know, like again, I keep bitching and moaning about the guardian legend,

1463
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:47,600
but which I, I noticed you changed your background on Twitch to be like,

1464
02:15:47,600 --> 02:15:52,240
is that like a remake or something? It's a remake of it's somebody like,

1465
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:57,840
I was like curious, like, has anyone tried the remake? Oh yeah. It was a big, this is it that

1466
02:15:57,840 --> 02:16:01,120
you're looking at. There was a big attempt a couple of years ago. I don't think they ever

1467
02:16:01,760 --> 02:16:06,800
download it, but I couldn't, I couldn't, can't get it to run, but I was trying to, to run it,

1468
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:11,760
but yeah. But like, I'm basically sitting here going, please let me pay you money again.

1469
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:16,480
So I can play this game on a modern console without having to dig up my NES and blow on

1470
02:16:16,480 --> 02:16:20,160
the cartridge and pray that the goddamn thing still works. Cause you know, I got guardian

1471
02:16:20,160 --> 02:16:25,120
legend on cartridge. I have like two cartridges, guardian legend anyway, all that aside, um,

1472
02:16:26,080 --> 02:16:32,000
with all this, uh, like, like, uh, making the PlayStation two can work again. And to get,

1473
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:37,440
to get these all games, this is great for game preservation is that, you know, these, even if,

1474
02:16:37,440 --> 02:16:43,920
if a game that's really hard to get like rule of Rose, people will still be able to, cause that

1475
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:48,320
game, that game's a little wacky or, or earlier, even not even necessarily a PlayStation two game,

1476
02:16:48,320 --> 02:16:54,240
but I watched a streamer play, uh, the unreleased version of saints row on PSP.

1477
02:16:54,560 --> 02:16:59,840
And that was hot guards because it was nowhere near complete. Um, do you, do you want to hear

1478
02:16:59,840 --> 02:17:06,960
my most depressing story? Um, and I bet, I think I've told this on OLR before, but I'm gonna tell

1479
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:11,440
it again because I think we have some new people watching tonight. Hello. This is my most depressing

1480
02:17:11,440 --> 02:17:17,120
story about the PlayStation two and the video game rule of Rose. So, you know, that that game goes

1481
02:17:17,120 --> 02:17:22,720
for like hundreds of dollars because there wasn't a lot of copies of that game made. Right. So

1482
02:17:22,800 --> 02:17:26,640
here's the thing. Not only did I have a copy of rule of Rose,

1483
02:17:27,760 --> 02:17:35,040
I had a press copy of rule of Rose because I got that for you. I know. And do you think I know

1484
02:17:35,040 --> 02:17:41,680
where that fucking thing is now? Loki? Nope. Nope. I'm almost positive. I just got rid of it in a

1485
02:17:41,680 --> 02:17:46,880
past move. I was like, I don't need this anymore. I have too much shit in this house. I don't need

1486
02:17:46,880 --> 02:17:51,280
this anymore. Was it, was it through your connections or I thought it was a podcast thing.

1487
02:17:51,280 --> 02:17:56,400
I thought we got it. Cause no, no, no, you're right. It was, it was a podcast. It was a podcast

1488
02:17:56,400 --> 02:18:01,680
thing. We, we had a little thingy thing going with Atlas back in the day. Uh, because all

1489
02:18:01,680 --> 02:18:06,160
these game companies were wanting to work with pot cause you know, it was, Ooh, podcasts. What's

1490
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:10,160
that all about? So yeah, most positive Atlas like sent us that disc and we did, we talked about the

1491
02:18:10,160 --> 02:18:14,320
game on air and all that stuff. Uh, we did everything we were supposed to do, but it's like,

1492
02:18:14,320 --> 02:18:23,200
Oh, I got rid of a promo copy, a promo copy of the most valuable PlayStation two game out there.

1493
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:27,680
And Phoenix seven, seven, two, six asks, is it any good? I played it and I thought it was pretty

1494
02:18:27,680 --> 02:18:33,040
good. It was a creepy game. It is, but it's got a little like, uh, it's got a little flowers in the

1495
02:18:33,040 --> 02:18:38,000
attic thing going on, if you know what I'm talking about. So some of those themes might be a little

1496
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:45,120
like, Ooh, I don't know. So that's, um, I'll leave it at that. But as far as like a, uh, competent,

1497
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:50,880
uh, psychological horror type of game. Yes. That's why, that's why everybody, that's why everybody

1498
02:18:50,880 --> 02:18:55,280
wants to play it and why it's so goddamn popular because it is a competent psychological horror

1499
02:18:55,280 --> 02:19:02,960
game. That's kind of gross and you shouldn't be playing it probably. So, all right. A Phoenix

1500
02:19:02,960 --> 02:19:08,400
77, 26 says, Rob, is that an old way of saying that it's problematic? No, no, I'm, I'm literally

1501
02:19:08,400 --> 02:19:14,000
saying some of those problematic themes from flowers in the attic are also in rule of Rose,

1502
02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:22,720
like specifically that piece of literature. All right. Anyway, SSG owner, Matt says flowers in

1503
02:19:22,720 --> 02:19:28,000
the attic that flew over everyone's head. Pixel pocket is LOL. So not everybody, somebody knows

1504
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:34,240
what I'm talking about. Fucking Google it. What is the plot of flowers in the attic?

1505
02:19:34,240 --> 02:19:41,760
But I warned you. All right. I finally did get the, the guardian legacy, uh, or the guardian

1506
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:46,640
legends legacy thing they run. I just have to install XNA of the redistributable, um,

1507
02:19:46,640 --> 02:19:51,360
redistributable, but cool. I can play it now. Neat. All right. Well have fun with that. Do some,

1508
02:19:51,360 --> 02:19:56,640
do some recording. What's the link in chat? Yeah. All right. Uh, moving on. We got one more story

1509
02:19:56,640 --> 02:20:02,960
officially, uh, on the record tonight and some folks in chat are like, why is toy in quotes? And

1510
02:20:02,960 --> 02:20:07,840
what are we talking about with this story? Because it says on the sidebar, animal crossing toy

1511
02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:15,920
in quotes. What does that mean? And well, y'all I'm talking about it for animal crossing.

1512
02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:20,000
I'm talking about a butt plug is what I'm talking about. Uh, animal crossing, uh,

1513
02:20:20,800 --> 02:20:26,640
it's in a whole report that vice did where they have designed a, they, somebody out there who has

1514
02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:33,200
a lot of free time in this pandemic situation has designed a way for sex toys to communicate

1515
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:41,040
with a Nintendo switch and it's haptic feedback capabilities. So when animal crossing triggers

1516
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:46,720
a little character rumble by like digging a hole or hitting something with a shovel,

1517
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:51,120
that same haptic feedback can go right in your butt.

1518
02:20:52,560 --> 02:20:58,400
Literally. I love that the effect can be triggered in solo play,

1519
02:21:00,160 --> 02:21:03,280
but there are multiplayer possibilities as well.

1520
02:21:10,400 --> 02:21:13,920
So what about the integration with one, two switch? I mean, cause I,

1521
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:17,920
I love that they tied it to animal crossing when in reality,

1522
02:21:17,920 --> 02:21:22,720
all it is is that somebody figured out how to get the haptic vibrations that go in the controller

1523
02:21:22,720 --> 02:21:30,800
to also go to a different device. And yet it's animal crossing that we all immediately go for.

1524
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:39,200
It's because rez isn't on the switch yet, but maybe, maybe they'll try harder to put it there

1525
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:44,960
in the future. Sorry. I'm screaming at this chat comment. This is my favorite thing.

1526
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:49,600
Pixel pockets and chat says animal crossing in my butt.

1527
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:07,040
Like seriously, like I guess you got all this time with the COVID-19 situation. And so it's like,

1528
02:22:07,600 --> 02:22:13,680
you know, I've got all those free time. Hey, I wonder if I can get this to work with this.

1529
02:22:13,680 --> 02:22:20,560
Why not? Sorry. I knocked all the Pokemon over cause I died laughing. All right.

1530
02:22:23,680 --> 02:22:29,440
Hype mayhem and chat says, so Tom Nook can F you in the butt IRL, not just metaphorically in game.

1531
02:22:29,440 --> 02:22:36,080
If, if that's what you want. Sure. Bobby says the best thing is the name of the API that they're

1532
02:22:36,080 --> 02:22:39,680
using, which I don't even know what it is. And I don't think I want to know, did your own SS.

1533
02:22:39,680 --> 02:22:45,440
Can I get a link for this? I know someone who would buy this. Sure. Let's see where can you

1534
02:22:45,440 --> 02:22:52,080
get more information on this? I'm looking it up right now. Cause all I have are these stories

1535
02:22:52,080 --> 02:22:59,440
that are going around. Oh, there's a GitHub for the project. And it is, the username is,

1536
02:22:59,440 --> 02:23:11,120
um, Intiface. You can take it Intiface or, all right, forget it. It's I N T I F A C E. So,

1537
02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:17,360
uh, Intiface is the user on GitHub and this is like Intiface console game haptics router.

1538
02:23:17,360 --> 02:23:24,960
So there it is. Anyhow, enjoy that. Well, that's, that's interesting.

1539
02:23:25,600 --> 02:23:32,320
All right. Let's quickly move on to another story. All right. Uh, this is the part where

1540
02:23:32,320 --> 02:23:36,320
I'm going to open up the listener round table in our chat. If you have any questions or,

1541
02:23:36,320 --> 02:23:40,240
or things you'd like us to address on the show, you can go ahead and say those in chat.

1542
02:23:40,240 --> 02:23:42,960
Unfortunately, they're probably still going to be talking about butt plugs for the next

1543
02:23:42,960 --> 02:23:46,960
five minutes. Uh, so maybe we need a few last minute stories to help us shift the topic around.

1544
02:23:48,400 --> 02:23:54,720
Yes, we should definitely get something. Um, okay. All right. Wait, let me say this cause Bobby,

1545
02:23:54,800 --> 02:23:59,360
Bobby brought it up like that. Bobby said, Hey, any news about summer games done quick?

1546
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:03,840
Why? Yes. And you should listen to the Bobby Black Wolf show from tonight to find out.

1547
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:09,280
All right, go ahead. No, I'm just kidding. Um, Bobby, uh, auditioned to be a host at summer

1548
02:24:09,280 --> 02:24:14,880
games done quick and, uh, good news and bad news. Uh, bad news is he is not one of the

1549
02:24:14,880 --> 02:24:20,960
25 main hosts, but the good news is he's one of the backup hosts. Um, so if, if miss America

1550
02:24:20,960 --> 02:24:26,080
cannot fulfill her duties as host, um, Bobby Black Wolf shall step in and be the, uh, runner

1551
02:24:26,080 --> 02:24:31,360
up host, I think is the technical terms for it. Uh, the, all the details are on the show.

1552
02:24:31,360 --> 02:24:34,960
Uh, finger, you know, it's, it's a weird situation cause you're like,

1553
02:24:34,960 --> 02:24:39,760
Oh, uh, we really want to see Bobby get that opportunity, but Oh, if he gets that opportunity,

1554
02:24:39,760 --> 02:24:43,760
that means somebody else had something happen where they can't do it. And that's very sad.

1555
02:24:43,760 --> 02:24:48,800
So it's a tricky situation. So all I can really say is I'm just happy Bobby made it that far.

1556
02:24:49,360 --> 02:24:53,920
It's his very first year of auditioning. I think there's something like 130 people that audition

1557
02:24:53,920 --> 02:24:59,440
and he's maybe 120, I don't know. Uh, but he's in like the top 32 then 25 will say he's in the top

1558
02:24:59,440 --> 02:25:03,280
32 of that. And that's, that's still pretty impressive, especially your first year with

1559
02:25:03,280 --> 02:25:07,440
like no guidance or anything beyond your own research. So kudos to Bobby Black Wolf,

1560
02:25:07,440 --> 02:25:12,640
high five, high five. And, um, I would say we hope to see you on summer games done quick,

1561
02:25:12,640 --> 02:25:17,760
although that's rude. So I'm going to say instead, we hope you get a lot of great experience at

1562
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:22,720
summer games done quick so that in turn we see you at awesome games done quick when COVID is

1563
02:25:22,720 --> 02:25:31,440
all done. Hopefully sound good. Good. All right. All right. So I've got some stuff that we can

1564
02:25:31,440 --> 02:25:38,240
talk about. Um, did you know that there's a brand new DDR version coming out? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1565
02:25:38,240 --> 02:25:45,760
I did hear, uh, it's, it's kind of like a rehash of ACE 20, right? Yeah. So it's, it's a 20 plus

1566
02:25:46,480 --> 02:25:52,320
and they're adding more songs to it as well. Uh, I launched, I appreciate that cause I love third

1567
02:25:52,320 --> 02:25:58,880
mix plus and fourth mix plus. So yeah. So it launched already on the gold cabinets on the first,

1568
02:25:59,520 --> 02:26:05,840
um, but now it'll be coming to the blue cabinets, I believe on the eighth, if I remember correctly.

1569
02:26:07,040 --> 02:26:11,520
Where is it launching? Arcades are closed. Are there arcades still open in Japan?

1570
02:26:12,480 --> 02:26:16,720
I guess they are. Yeah, I guess they've controlled the, I guess I heard a resurgence is

1571
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:20,800
kind of like coming, but they're kind of managing it a little better there, but it's awesome. My

1572
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:26,640
first thing is like, where the fuck are arcades open right now? Yeah. So they've got some new

1573
02:26:26,640 --> 02:26:31,840
songs. Um, you know, there's four that were mentioned. So destructive force by bad myth,

1574
02:26:31,840 --> 02:26:37,760
hyper twist, hyper bomb in the past. And then there's a last card by chorus K, uh,

1575
02:26:37,840 --> 02:26:44,720
looks pretty awesome. And they did some rebalancing. They have a new thing, uh,

1576
02:26:44,720 --> 02:26:51,440
that's basically to check your level. So it allows you to see what kind of, uh, foot level

1577
02:26:51,440 --> 02:26:55,520
you should be. I don't even know if they do foot feet or any more if it's stars or whatever.

1578
02:26:55,520 --> 02:27:01,280
Um, but they're basically trying to let you know, like what level you should be playing at, uh,

1579
02:27:01,280 --> 02:27:07,200
what songs may be right for you so you can play that stage and then it will assess you and let

1580
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:12,320
you know, okay, you're good for these songs. And just real quick, cause I said, where are arcades

1581
02:27:12,320 --> 02:27:16,320
open, but I'm being corrected in chat cause yeah, Bobby had that whole thing on the pinball arcade.

1582
02:27:16,320 --> 02:27:19,840
He did on the show a couple of weeks ago and he says, are Dave and busters and main event

1583
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:24,800
are open here. And you know, now that I think about it, um, bars, it probably, if bars were

1584
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:29,760
open, I don't see why a place like round one or Dave and busters weren't also open. Um,

1585
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:34,480
especially like casinos and all that. Although, as you know, here in California where we're at,

1586
02:27:34,480 --> 02:27:40,080
they in all the mostly populated counties, you know, it's not every county, but it's mostly the

1587
02:27:40,080 --> 02:27:44,560
populated ones. Uh, they've closed everything again. So, um, they're not having it now,

1588
02:27:44,560 --> 02:27:50,320
but yeah, you're, I gotta remember the world in California. Um, but yeah, I just, I, I,

1589
02:27:51,760 --> 02:27:56,560
going out to play DDR in public, like there, I can't think of anything I want to do less.

1590
02:27:59,200 --> 02:28:03,120
I still think this news is cool, but I'll wait until next year. Thanks.

1591
02:28:05,360 --> 02:28:13,680
So, um, because we're clamoring for, uh, brand new press events and stuff, I am happy to announce

1592
02:28:13,680 --> 02:28:20,560
that Devolver digital direct 2020 will be airing on Saturday, July 11th. So we can look forward to

1593
02:28:20,560 --> 02:28:27,440
that this week. Uh, I can't wait. It's going to be, uh, at 12 PM Pacific time on Twitch.

1594
02:28:27,440 --> 02:28:35,120
That should be fun. And then, uh, apparently Nintendo is, um, they're not too concerned

1595
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:39,520
anymore about 3DS vulnerabilities. They've actually shifted their hacker bounty program

1596
02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:46,560
to entirely, um, encompass the switch now and, um, no longer have any 3DS

1597
02:28:46,560 --> 02:28:51,440
vulnerabilities in their program. Nintendo officially no longer cares about the 3DS

1598
02:28:51,440 --> 02:28:58,720
confirmed hack away. Yep. Hack away. And then apparently there's a VR experience in Japan for,

1599
02:28:58,720 --> 02:29:05,040
uh, Rockman over there. So Rockman VR aimed at the virtual world. I want to play that.

1600
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:09,200
Oh, is that something like, uh, like, I don't know, like mega Bay and

1601
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:16,640
legend in like VR or something, or am I totally on base? I don't know. They said starting July 18th.

1602
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:30,000
Um, it'll be playable at the Plaza Capcom, um, in Tokyo's, uh, Ika Bakuro. And I don't know if they

1603
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:36,480
said it'll be a permanent VR corner where you can experience, uh, that game. It says, uh, apparently

1604
02:29:36,480 --> 02:29:42,560
in the game says you create a Donna headset created by Dr. Light and try to stop Dr. Wily.

1605
02:29:42,560 --> 02:29:45,760
Well, that's pretty much every single game. It actually, it actually kind of reminds me

1606
02:29:45,760 --> 02:29:49,280
of another story that we cut from the list tonight. It was a surprising amount of news

1607
02:29:49,280 --> 02:29:53,040
for this. I thought going into today, I was like, I think it was a slow news week. And then I'm like,

1608
02:29:53,040 --> 02:29:57,280
Oh, actually, no, it wasn't. There was a lot of stuff. Um, there was an emulator that came out for

1609
02:29:57,280 --> 02:30:03,040
the NES that takes 2d games and turns them into 3d games. And one of the main man games was one

1610
02:30:03,040 --> 02:30:08,960
of them. No, it's not. I mean, it's more like, um, not like a first person 3d, but it's like, uh,

1611
02:30:08,960 --> 02:30:14,560
like you kind of can tilt the play field kind of thing. Do you, uh, speaking of the 3DS,

1612
02:30:14,560 --> 02:30:19,680
remember back when the 3DS was releasing some NES games and there were a few that had enhancements

1613
02:30:19,680 --> 02:30:26,080
where it would make some stereoscopic 3d stuff. It's basically that without the stereoscopic 3d.

1614
02:30:26,080 --> 02:30:31,200
Okay. Okay. I got you. So they have like voxel support and stuff. And so like, it'll make,

1615
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:38,000
you know, the pipes rounded in super Mario, um, brothers three or, um, it'll do stuff like that.

1616
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:42,320
And it, they have like a few hundred games that it supports that they've added this,

1617
02:30:42,320 --> 02:30:48,240
these enhancements to, um, pretty cool. Um, can I just say real quick, and this is totally

1618
02:30:48,240 --> 02:30:52,720
unrelated to what we're talking about, but just off camera over here, my husband is unloading the,

1619
02:30:52,720 --> 02:30:58,800
the supplies from target. And can I say how happy I am? Can you bring me like your gold star discovery

1620
02:30:58,800 --> 02:31:04,320
that you got at target? Can I just say how happy I am? Because I think this is a sign that somehow

1621
02:31:04,320 --> 02:31:13,200
the earth will heal. Um, is that Alan was actually able to find at target the really good toilet

1622
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:22,000
paper. And there was a lot of it in stock and it's not some fucking off brand shit. And it's not some

1623
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:30,400
like one ply 99 cent store thing. This is the real, this is gold plated toilet paper.

1624
02:31:30,960 --> 02:31:35,280
Yeah. It's only a disinfectant. Wait. Yeah. It's like a blanket. Actually. Wait,

1625
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:38,160
as I don't want this being an endorsement that they didn't pay for it. God damn it.

1626
02:31:38,160 --> 02:31:43,520
Is there a name like not on there somewhere? So this is a sign perhaps

1627
02:31:44,240 --> 02:31:47,920
that nature will find a way we will heal.

1628
02:31:51,760 --> 02:31:58,720
Looking in chat at some comments, um, orange, right? Says, wow. Pixel pockets put X, D, um,

1629
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:04,720
issue on her map. But yes, I was so excited when I got the text message. I put, we're going to Vegas.

1630
02:32:07,280 --> 02:32:09,120
Hello. I'm on camera.

1631
02:32:13,040 --> 02:32:19,520
There's a great, like one line on your article that says, um, two month long personal nightmare

1632
02:32:19,520 --> 02:32:22,800
of using up the wrong type of toilet paper that someone purchased finally over.

1633
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:27,360
Cause like the husband brings home the wrong toilet paper and it's like, this is,

1634
02:32:27,360 --> 02:32:32,960
we have to use this now for weeks. And then once the final role is all they have though,

1635
02:32:32,960 --> 02:32:38,480
you have to just, you have to buy what they have. Well, everybody else is having to dip into their,

1636
02:32:38,480 --> 02:32:43,680
you know, bunker supply now. So it finally leaves some nice fluffy three ply for the rest of us.

1637
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:49,040
And I couldn't be more thankful. We're still using up the, uh, industrial like paper towels

1638
02:32:49,040 --> 02:32:53,280
that I got a while back from Amazon, like the stuff that you would find in your office building

1639
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:58,880
bathroom. Um, and to be honest, I mean, those things have lasted for months. Like I still

1640
02:32:58,880 --> 02:33:04,640
have like three rolls of that stuff left and they were like massive, but I remember at one time,

1641
02:33:04,640 --> 02:33:09,280
like the local grocery store by us, they could not get toilet paper in and all they can do is

1642
02:33:09,280 --> 02:33:13,840
get it from their supplier. And so it was like, it was that really cheap, cheap, cheap stuff that

1643
02:33:13,840 --> 02:33:19,840
they're selling by single roll. And it's like, take what I can get. Uh, quest buster and chat

1644
02:33:19,840 --> 02:33:25,760
says you have added premium toilet paper to your inventory, plus one to charisma.

1645
02:33:28,320 --> 02:33:35,280
Um, yes, but yeah, we, we had like, we had just bought a big pack right before we went on the

1646
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:39,760
cruise. Cause you might remember we were on a cruise like the week before lockdown started and

1647
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:43,200
everything was fine with the cruise. It was nothing like you heard about with the other stuff.

1648
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:49,200
Um, so, uh, we were able, we were able to use that for like months. I think we finally just

1649
02:33:49,200 --> 02:33:55,120
ran out of that like last month. And then it was like, Oh, the horrific, uh, off-brand supply has

1650
02:33:55,120 --> 02:34:00,800
to begin now. So I'm so glad our long national nightmare is over. All right. Uh, let's see,

1651
02:34:00,800 --> 02:34:05,600
uh, other comments in chat here. Um, Hype Mayhem says nice teepee pun. Yup. Yeah. That's what we're

1652
02:34:05,600 --> 02:34:11,120
pros at here at OLR. SG100 Matt says we went from talking about butts and now we're back to it.

1653
02:34:11,120 --> 02:34:17,360
And Azet with what will probably be the perfect chat comment tonight. Everything is about butts.

1654
02:34:17,360 --> 02:34:23,040
Correct. Everything is about butts. Uh, any other last minute stories?

1655
02:34:24,240 --> 02:34:30,000
No, that's it. Then I think that's the perfect note to end on. Uh, so get it and on. All right.

1656
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:34,240
Anyway, so that is going to do it for another episode of orange lounge radio. Thank you guys

1657
02:34:34,240 --> 02:34:38,720
so much for checking out our show tonight. Uh, whether it was on the podcast feed or on Twitch,

1658
02:34:38,720 --> 02:34:44,000
we really appreciate your guys' support and you lasted through the whole thing. Congratulations.

1659
02:34:44,240 --> 02:34:48,960
It's been a night of ups and downs. Let me tell you. Uh, and it was only two of us here tonight,

1660
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:54,800
like is something anyway. Um, thank you guys so much for downloading the show or tuning in live.

1661
02:34:54,800 --> 02:34:58,720
All we ask. We don't, we don't really ask for your money. Although if you do throw the subs

1662
02:34:58,720 --> 02:35:02,160
and the bits, we're not going to complain. I'm going to, I'm going to put that out there. However,

1663
02:35:02,160 --> 02:35:05,840
all we really, really want, just help us spread the word. We are the show where every gamer has

1664
02:35:05,840 --> 02:35:09,680
a voice, but we need your friends. We need your enemies. We need your frenemies here,

1665
02:35:09,680 --> 02:35:13,600
uh, to help out and expand our audience. Uh, because we are the show where every gamer has

1666
02:35:13,600 --> 02:35:18,560
a voice. But if your voices aren't here to put on air, what are we going to do? So anyway, um,

1667
02:35:18,560 --> 02:35:23,840
a nice five star review wherever you found this show goes a nice long way. Auto hosts on Twitch

1668
02:35:23,840 --> 02:35:28,720
are outstanding. And I thank all of you that do it. Unfortunately, Twitch no longer gives me a

1669
02:35:28,720 --> 02:35:32,160
list of who's doing it. So I can't thank you personally, but please know if you're doing it.

1670
02:35:32,160 --> 02:35:37,280
I do see some of it on the stats stuff like viewers who watch these channels also watch

1671
02:35:37,280 --> 02:35:40,640
yours because they're always hosting or whatever. So we really appreciate that. So thank you. Thank

1672
02:35:40,640 --> 02:35:47,040
you. Thank you. Um, that takes us to, I believe final thoughts. So Loki with that all said,

1673
02:35:47,040 --> 02:35:51,280
do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight? Uh, I don't really have much of anything,

1674
02:35:51,280 --> 02:35:55,680
but I did want to mention that X-Box game pass ultimate right now as a dollar.

1675
02:35:55,680 --> 02:36:03,280
Oh shit. Where? On Microsoft site. Really? Like for new people only?

1676
02:36:04,880 --> 02:36:10,240
Or can I buy 12 of them? I don't know. I'm trying to figure that out right now.

1677
02:36:10,240 --> 02:36:13,520
Take that with a grain of salt. Cause I have a feeling that could be a new people

1678
02:36:13,520 --> 02:36:18,800
only type of offer. It's like 99 cents for your first month of insert thing here. And then you're

1679
02:36:18,800 --> 02:36:25,120
subscribed on NeoGaf. So that's why. Okay. And, and, and, and I went to the page and it said a

1680
02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:31,920
dollar. Yeah. So I don't know. All right. We'll look at, we'll look into that. All right. Um,

1681
02:36:31,920 --> 02:36:36,000
and that's your final thought tonight. That's my final thought. All right. Uh, and my final

1682
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:41,440
thought tonight is, um, yeah, I think, I think I said all my piece earlier in the show, so I'm not

1683
02:36:41,440 --> 02:36:46,240
going to say too much more, but just, um, you know, thank you all for being here. I, I'm so

1684
02:36:46,240 --> 02:36:51,440
thankful, uh, that there's a place for me to say shit on Sunday night and there's people that

1685
02:36:51,440 --> 02:36:56,000
actually want to listen to it. Thank you so much. We'll see you in seven days to talk about video

1686
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:59,840
games all over again, dark soccer. We'll be back next week. And I think she's here for the full

1687
02:36:59,840 --> 02:37:03,760
show next week. Cause she did a work thing where she's not working on Monday. So that's really

1688
02:37:03,760 --> 02:37:08,400
exciting. So we'll be back in seven days to talk about whatever happens in the next week and with

1689
02:37:08,400 --> 02:37:15,040
E3 not having happened and random announcements coming at random times, there could be a lot of

1690
02:37:15,040 --> 02:37:20,160
stuff. In the meantime, I will enjoy my burger time machine. You enjoy whatever it is, makes you

1691
02:37:20,160 --> 02:37:26,800
happy. Have a wonderful night, everybody. You've been listening to orange lounge radio. Orange
