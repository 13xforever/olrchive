00:00.000 --> 00:13.720
This week, we're reminded that the larger sums of money don't prevent problems from

00:13.720 --> 00:14.720
happening.

00:14.720 --> 00:18.440
The MMO New Earth has been delayed from this autumn until next spring, at least.

00:18.440 --> 00:22.640
Amazon Gaming has now encountered at least two setbacks for New Earth, one for unforeseeable

00:22.640 --> 00:27.520
reasons, along with the critically muted reaction to its hero arena shooter, Crucible.

00:27.520 --> 00:31.440
No success is guaranteed, but that shouldn't stop you from trying, much like our hosts

00:31.440 --> 00:35.920
Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki, who continue to press on with the show where every

00:35.920 --> 00:37.920
gamer has a voice.

00:37.920 --> 00:47.440
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:47.440 --> 00:49.480
where every gamer has a voice.

00:49.480 --> 00:55.880
It is Orange Lounge Radio Live yet again tonight with another week of our show.

00:55.880 --> 01:01.480
It is episode number 827 for this July 12th of 2020.

01:01.480 --> 01:07.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you live here from our recording studio that we used to

01:07.000 --> 01:08.160
do for many years.

01:08.160 --> 01:11.760
We would meet live in person here in this studio, but due to the current state of the

01:11.760 --> 01:16.680
world, we're separated a little bit and saying hello through the magic of Discord.

01:16.680 --> 01:21.800
Joining me, Rob, here in studio is DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

01:21.800 --> 01:24.080
Greetings and salivations.

01:24.080 --> 01:25.080
Welcome back.

01:25.080 --> 01:26.080
Thank you so much for joining us this week.

01:26.080 --> 01:27.080
What did you throw?

01:27.080 --> 01:29.320
Yeah, I was going to say my aim is steadily improving.

01:29.320 --> 01:31.080
I'm trying, but yeah.

01:31.080 --> 01:33.800
So hopefully, I hope you're doing well.

01:33.800 --> 01:34.800
Hanging in there?

01:34.800 --> 01:35.800
I'm doing alright.

01:35.800 --> 01:38.800
I'm definitely better than last week.

01:38.800 --> 01:39.800
Good.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.480
There's just some stuff going on.

01:42.480 --> 01:44.200
We've all got stuff.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.920
I understand.

01:45.920 --> 01:49.920
As I was saying to somebody the other day, it's been a hell of a year today.

01:49.920 --> 01:53.680
I'll go ahead and be honest with it.

01:53.680 --> 01:58.880
My mom is sick with COVID symptoms, and she got tested on Thursday last week, and we don't

01:58.880 --> 02:00.880
find out for a few more days.

02:00.880 --> 02:08.260
So yeah, so kind of fun coming two months after my dad dies.

02:08.260 --> 02:14.680
Of course, I've been worried and stressed out, but mom is full of spite as ever.

02:14.680 --> 02:17.520
It's where you get it.

02:17.520 --> 02:18.520
In all seriousness.

02:18.520 --> 02:20.700
I expanded on that.

02:20.700 --> 02:25.580
In all seriousness, obviously, fingers and toes crossed, and just hoping for all the

02:25.580 --> 02:27.820
best with your mom.

02:27.820 --> 02:32.200
If it is that, then hopefully the symptoms don't get any worse.

02:32.200 --> 02:35.540
I can cross all that, but if I cross my eyes, they'll get stuck that way.

02:35.540 --> 02:36.980
Mama said so.

02:36.980 --> 02:41.580
Alright, well, we can actually see, thanks to the magic of Discord, if his eyes are stuck,

02:41.580 --> 02:42.580
say hello to Tech...

02:42.580 --> 02:44.460
I wore makeup.

02:44.460 --> 02:46.580
Your face is beat very well tonight, Darzakra.

02:46.580 --> 02:47.580
Too bad the...

02:47.580 --> 02:49.700
Yeah, doing that daytime drag.

02:49.700 --> 02:50.700
Your eyes look great.

02:50.700 --> 02:54.060
Too bad the podcasties can't appreciate it, but that's alright.

02:54.060 --> 03:01.180
More incentive to tune in live every Sunday night at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, where we tape

03:01.180 --> 03:05.500
right after the Bobby Blackwell show, twitch.tv slash vog network, and of course you can join

03:05.500 --> 03:09.160
us in our chat room at twitch.tv slash vog network if you want to chat along with the

03:09.160 --> 03:10.160
show.

03:10.160 --> 03:14.020
I'll say hello to you guys in a minute, but I have to say hello to Techmaster Loki, also

03:14.020 --> 03:15.020
on Discord.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.020
Hello.

03:16.020 --> 03:17.020
Hi, Loki.

03:17.020 --> 03:18.140
How are you?

03:18.140 --> 03:19.140
I'm pretty good.

03:19.580 --> 03:20.580
Awesome.

03:20.580 --> 03:23.140
I'm excited to talk about your background video, but obviously we have a little ways

03:23.140 --> 03:27.100
in the show to get to before we can, but yeah.

03:27.100 --> 03:29.220
I'm sure some folks recognize what it is.

03:29.220 --> 03:31.380
I always pick something that's appropriate for...

03:31.380 --> 03:35.020
Well, unless I can't think of anything appropriate to what we're talking about.

03:35.020 --> 03:36.020
Fair enough.

03:36.020 --> 03:39.740
I have to decide, because I've mentioned this on the show before, it's inevitable that the

03:39.740 --> 03:45.300
studio is going to change again at some point, and obviously someday, fingers and toes crossed,

03:45.300 --> 03:47.580
I'd love for us all to be back in person.

03:47.580 --> 03:51.340
But I'm kind of wondering if maybe in the new studio, I won't just have a giant green

03:51.340 --> 03:57.620
screen in the background so we can just, you know, put in whatever we want, which I think

03:57.620 --> 03:58.620
would be fun.

03:58.620 --> 03:59.620
Yeah.

03:59.620 --> 04:04.700
It would be like those old clips from the 90s of Conan O'Brien taking the desk out for

04:04.700 --> 04:05.700
a drive.

04:05.700 --> 04:07.260
I don't know if you remember those segments from the...

04:07.260 --> 04:08.260
Yes, I remember that.

04:08.260 --> 04:09.500
It might be dating a little bit.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.500
I don't know.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.500
All right.

04:11.500 --> 04:14.820
Let's get into some of the news, gaming news.

04:14.860 --> 04:18.460
For our kickoff topic tonight, we've had some very big press conferences.

04:18.460 --> 04:21.300
Well, I don't know if you'd call them press conferences.

04:21.300 --> 04:22.300
They were more like...

04:22.300 --> 04:23.300
Directs, I guess.

04:23.300 --> 04:24.300
Yeah.

04:24.300 --> 04:26.860
Direct updates to the peoples from two companies this week.

04:26.860 --> 04:30.740
We had Ubisoft, Devolver Digital, and Loki.

04:30.740 --> 04:34.100
Tell us a little bit about what we learned about.

04:34.100 --> 04:41.580
So if you haven't watched the Devolver Digital Direct or show or presentation in the last

04:41.580 --> 04:44.220
few years, you're really missing out.

04:44.220 --> 04:50.100
They are unique, to say the least, and there's this ongoing storyline that goes from each

04:50.100 --> 04:53.100
one.

04:53.100 --> 04:54.140
It's just bonkers.

04:54.140 --> 05:00.740
But they did show a few different games that are going to be coming out pretty soon.

05:00.740 --> 05:04.140
So Shadow Warrior 3 was one that looked pretty awesome.

05:04.140 --> 05:10.140
Kind of resembling more like the new Doom Eternal games versus the old Shadow Warrior

05:10.140 --> 05:11.140
stuff.

05:11.140 --> 05:14.140
A game called Fall Guys looks pretty fun.

05:14.140 --> 05:18.140
Carry On, which I swear was already out, but I think that now maybe it's coming out the

05:18.140 --> 05:21.140
consoles.

05:21.140 --> 05:25.140
And this one game, I guess, is called Alesia.

05:25.140 --> 05:26.140
Alesia.

05:26.140 --> 05:27.140
And that looked pretty cool.

05:27.140 --> 05:32.140
And of course, more footage of Serious Sam 4, which had been talked about before.

05:32.140 --> 05:38.140
But the thing that's in my background and another thing that they announced as well

05:38.580 --> 05:41.420
was this Devolverland Expo.

05:41.420 --> 05:44.540
And what it is, it's a free game you can get on Steam.

05:44.540 --> 05:49.940
And it's a game, and it's also a bunch of their trailers and stuff like that.

05:49.940 --> 05:56.260
And so it's a perfect Devolver Digital thing that you really should go check out.

05:56.260 --> 05:57.340
It's a pretty decent game.

05:57.340 --> 05:59.100
So go check it out.

05:59.100 --> 06:03.460
It's like breaking into the E3 Expo.

06:03.460 --> 06:07.460
I mean, they've modeled it after the Los Angeles Expo Center there.

06:08.460 --> 06:11.460
So it's fun, and it's free.

06:11.460 --> 06:17.460
Interestingly enough, Loki, I don't always get the hype around the Devolver stuff.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.460
I get that it's cute and it's funny and so forth.

06:20.460 --> 06:25.460
But I thought that this Expo thing that they put out, the Devolverland Expo, is that the

06:25.460 --> 06:26.460
official name of it?

06:26.460 --> 06:27.460
Devolverland Expo?

06:27.460 --> 06:28.460
I don't know.

06:28.460 --> 06:29.460
That's the name of the game.

06:29.460 --> 06:36.460
I thought, I feel like it's really clever and very unexpected.

06:36.460 --> 06:40.460
And I downloaded it, and I've actually played a little bit of it.

06:40.460 --> 06:47.460
And I was really kind of blown away uncannily how it is the Los Angeles Convention Center,

06:47.460 --> 06:48.460
no doubt.

06:48.460 --> 06:51.460
Like, when you start, you're walking right into it.

06:51.460 --> 06:55.460
And I remember, it's been a few years now, but I remember going through those doors.

06:55.460 --> 07:00.460
Now, obviously, things didn't look so dreary and bio-shocky like they do in that particular demo.

07:00.460 --> 07:04.460
But you go through the doors, and it's like, oh, I remember this lobby.

07:04.460 --> 07:08.460
And I just instinctively was like, well, registration was over here.

07:08.460 --> 07:13.460
And you go around to the left, and there's a place where you get like a t-shirt gun.

07:13.460 --> 07:18.460
And that's what, spoiler alert, that's what you can use against some of the sentries that are in there and so forth.

07:18.460 --> 07:24.460
So it's an interesting little like, but once you finally get into the South Hall, then it's like, okay,

07:24.460 --> 07:26.460
this is a little different.

07:26.460 --> 07:29.460
Like, it would never have been this crazy in here.

07:29.460 --> 07:33.460
But yeah, it was neat.

07:33.460 --> 07:36.460
I think that is a very clever little thing.

07:36.460 --> 07:39.460
And it actually had me doing some exploring.

07:39.460 --> 07:44.460
I watched one of the trailers for that Carrion, was that the name?

07:44.460 --> 07:45.460
Yeah, Carrion.

07:45.460 --> 07:50.460
Okay, so I was watching that, and you collect these little pieces,

07:50.460 --> 07:54.460
and I guess you can get unannounced game trailers, too.

07:54.460 --> 07:56.460
So you can actually get like bonus stuff.

07:56.460 --> 08:02.460
Although, I was told if you just go into your Steam library and actually go to where the application is,

08:02.460 --> 08:03.460
all the videos are right there.

08:03.460 --> 08:05.460
So you can just spoiler alert yourself if you want.

08:05.460 --> 08:06.460
It's fun.

08:06.460 --> 08:10.460
Well, the other thing, too, which folks didn't notice right away,

08:10.460 --> 08:15.460
but the trailer for the actual game, Devolverland Expo, had Steam keys hidden in it

08:15.460 --> 08:17.460
for some of the games that were in there.

08:17.460 --> 08:19.460
So it was kind of neat.

08:19.460 --> 08:27.460
I was going to say, though, one of the other things about that,

08:28.460 --> 08:30.460
yeah, it's just bonkers.

08:30.460 --> 08:34.460
You really need to check out the whole direct, if you will.

08:34.460 --> 08:37.460
I mean, it's poking fun, obviously, that all the directs,

08:37.460 --> 08:44.460
and they tout the game as it's a first-person marketing simulator, which is kind of silly.

08:44.460 --> 08:48.460
But yeah, it's pretty cool.

08:48.460 --> 08:55.460
So aside from Devolver Digital, the other thing that happened earlier today was Ubisoft.

08:55.460 --> 09:01.460
So Ubisoft had their kind of Ubisoft Forward event

09:01.460 --> 09:05.460
that showed some more footage of some of these games that had already been announced.

09:05.460 --> 09:11.460
So we had more footage for the Assassin's Creed Valhalla.

09:11.460 --> 09:19.460
We had a pretty lengthy thing for Watchdog Legends, which looks interesting.

09:19.460 --> 09:27.460
There was more stuff for, I think they were talking a little bit about Ghost Recon and Breakpoint.

09:27.460 --> 09:38.460
I'm surprised we still haven't seen anything for the, oh god, I don't remember the series now.

09:38.460 --> 09:41.460
Anyways, there was Elite Squad that they were showing off,

09:41.460 --> 09:45.460
which is kind of a weird stylized version of, I guess, the Tom Clancy universe,

09:45.460 --> 09:52.460
which, I gotta be honest, looks a whole hell of a lot like Agents of Mayhem, and not in a good way.

09:52.460 --> 09:58.460
There's Hyperscape, which is their battle royale game, which I think is already out now.

09:58.460 --> 10:02.460
They showed a little bit of Brawlhalla getting cross-play and stuff.

10:02.460 --> 10:07.460
I think Hyperscape is in an open beta now, because it was already in a

10:07.460 --> 10:11.460
get an invite on Twitch by watching streams sort of thing.

10:11.460 --> 10:15.460
I don't usually super get into a lot of the battle royale games,

10:15.460 --> 10:18.460
just because there's a lot of toxic communities out there with battle royale games.

10:18.460 --> 10:22.460
But I'm curious a little bit about Hyperscape,

10:22.460 --> 10:26.460
because it's got a little bit of that crazy crackdown bit to it,

10:26.460 --> 10:30.460
because there's anti-gravity and you can jump super high and silly things.

10:30.460 --> 10:32.460
Yeah, it looks interesting.

10:32.460 --> 10:35.460
And then they finished off with a trailer for Far Cry 6,

10:35.460 --> 10:41.460
which that announcement was leaked earlier when it showed up on some of the online storefronts.

10:41.460 --> 10:49.460
And then, of course, there's speculation that the kid in this game

10:49.460 --> 10:55.460
is a child version of Vos, who was in Far Cry 3.

10:55.460 --> 11:01.460
His name's Diego in this game, but, I mean, maybe he changes his name. Who knows?

11:01.460 --> 11:06.460
But it looks interesting. It's supposed to take place in Cuba or something like that.

11:06.460 --> 11:08.460
So, pretty cool.

11:08.460 --> 11:12.460
So not really a lot of big surprises, though, if I'm not mistaken, though, right?

11:12.460 --> 11:16.460
Like, we knew about Assassin's Creed. We knew, I mean, Far Cry 6, I guess, is a surprise.

11:16.460 --> 11:18.460
But is it?

11:18.460 --> 11:22.460
No, I guess not. But it looks interesting.

11:22.460 --> 11:26.460
I was going to say that we didn't see any Beyond Good and Evil 2,

11:26.460 --> 11:30.460
but they did promise, much like Microsoft did, I'm not sure about EA,

11:30.460 --> 11:34.460
that there's going to be yet another Ubisoft 4 later on in the summer,

11:34.460 --> 11:37.460
and they're going to show off more of that stuff around then,

11:37.460 --> 11:40.460
so we may see some more of that stuff poke up there.

11:40.460 --> 11:43.460
But, I mean, it's neat.

11:43.460 --> 11:48.460
Like, Watch Dogs Legion, it's a game that I'm interested in,

11:48.460 --> 11:50.460
but at the same time, I know how I am with games,

11:50.460 --> 11:53.460
and Watch Dogs 2 I was pretty excited for,

11:53.460 --> 11:57.460
and I played it for a few hours and then went on to something else,

11:57.460 --> 12:00.460
and I'm worried that that's going to be the same thing happening here,

12:00.460 --> 12:03.460
but it looks cool. I mean, so I'll give them that.

12:03.460 --> 12:07.460
Let's get some comments from our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

12:07.460 --> 12:10.460
QuestBuster says, Far Cry 6 is going to be interesting.

12:10.460 --> 12:14.460
Another open world sandbox. Yay. I love my open world sandbox games.

12:14.460 --> 12:19.460
There's a lot of people that do, and there's some people that you kind of get annoyed with it,

12:19.460 --> 12:24.460
but that's okay. Different games, I mean, there's literally, like, a million games to play online,

12:24.460 --> 12:26.460
so pick what works for you.

12:26.460 --> 12:30.460
Dark Dead Studio says, Far Cry 6 leaked on PSN, I heard.

12:30.460 --> 12:33.460
I believe, yes, I heard that same rumor, what have you,

12:33.460 --> 12:38.460
that one of the overseas stores put the artwork up early.

12:38.460 --> 12:43.460
Probably one of those things where it was probably dated for tomorrow,

12:43.460 --> 12:48.460
but because tomorrow in Asia is today, if that makes an international dateline play there,

12:48.460 --> 12:51.460
it may have triggered early or something like that. I don't know, I'm just theorizing.

12:51.460 --> 12:55.460
I don't know if they really explained why it happened, but that's just a theory.

12:55.460 --> 13:02.460
And let's see, Phoenix7726 says, I keep wondering when we're going to get a modern Assassin's Creed,

13:02.460 --> 13:04.460
and the answer is likely never.

13:04.460 --> 13:08.460
Well, I mean, on one hand it seems a little bit out of character for Assassin's Creed,

13:08.460 --> 13:15.460
but on the other, I mean, would like an Assassin's Creed in the future be something like,

13:15.460 --> 13:19.460
I don't know, I think like a Matrix-y style thing, is that something that could ever happen?

13:19.460 --> 13:21.460
Or is that just Watch Dogs?

13:21.460 --> 13:24.460
Well, the whole Assassin's Creed thing I think is supposed to have some,

13:24.460 --> 13:27.460
I don't know the entire storyline for Assassin's Creed,

13:27.460 --> 13:33.460
but I know that there is a future element to it because you're exploring memories

13:33.460 --> 13:37.460
of like one of the descendants of all these assassins,

13:37.460 --> 13:39.460
and that's how you're kind of replaying all this stuff.

13:39.460 --> 13:44.460
And there is like a modern day story part to it that's going from game to game,

13:44.460 --> 13:49.460
but like I said, I never really got past Assassin's Creed 1 as far as holding my attention.

13:49.460 --> 13:52.460
So I don't know what the storyline is,

13:52.460 --> 13:56.460
and I know they made a really terrible movie that's based on Assassin's Creed

13:56.460 --> 13:59.460
that we all like to forget about, but it's out there.

13:59.460 --> 14:03.460
So I don't know. I don't know what exactly the storyline is,

14:03.460 --> 14:08.460
but I do know that there is something that does take place like in the future.

14:08.460 --> 14:10.460
I don't know what it's building up to,

14:10.460 --> 14:14.460
but right now it's just an excuse to be able to go to the different timelines and do all this stuff.

14:14.460 --> 14:18.460
Yeah, and Quest Buster is kind of filling in on that too.

14:18.460 --> 14:23.460
Ass Creed has a modern component that briefly explores that side of the narrative,

14:23.460 --> 14:25.460
but it feels mostly like an appendage at this point.

14:25.460 --> 14:27.460
And that's kind of what I like because I remember playing,

14:27.460 --> 14:31.460
I've played the games a little bit, and I remember it like especially in the first, the early games,

14:31.460 --> 14:34.460
they like remastered the early games, and I think that's the one I played.

14:34.460 --> 14:37.460
And I remember it kind of like explains it a little bit,

14:37.460 --> 14:41.460
but it's very much like this is not the point of the game.

14:42.460 --> 14:44.460
Maybe it's like, you know what I mean.

14:44.460 --> 14:46.460
It's kind of one of those things, you're in it for like 30 seconds,

14:46.460 --> 14:49.460
then you're not really thinking about that part anymore, if that makes sense.

14:49.460 --> 14:50.460
Yeah.

14:52.460 --> 14:55.460
Let's see. And then also, VGRealness in chat says,

14:55.460 --> 14:58.460
Watch Dogs fills the void of future Assassin's Creed.

14:58.460 --> 15:00.460
Yeah, I suppose.

15:00.460 --> 15:03.460
And I guess maybe like your modern Assassin's Creed as well.

15:03.460 --> 15:08.460
Assassin's Creed is one of those things I think is always going to be a little bit historical,

15:08.460 --> 15:13.460
especially when we've seen these modes like in the recent one,

15:13.460 --> 15:17.460
was Odyssey had that whole little like history adventure mode, right?

15:17.460 --> 15:19.460
And there was the one before it had it too, right?

15:19.460 --> 15:21.460
Where it's like, this isn't really the game,

15:21.460 --> 15:23.460
but you can explore and actually learn about history

15:23.460 --> 15:27.460
because we went so far as to render all these historical things.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.460
Why not put this in here as like a learning thing too?

15:29.460 --> 15:33.460
And I imagine this new one's going to have something like that too, just because.

15:33.460 --> 15:40.460
I guess. I mean, I want to say, though, like, I don't remember which game it was,

15:40.460 --> 15:45.460
but I thought that there was one of the games that they had that you were,

15:45.460 --> 15:49.460
they wanted like, they were touting its historic accuracy,

15:49.460 --> 15:54.460
and then they had you fighting like Greek gods or something like that.

15:54.460 --> 15:56.460
I don't want to say it's like something ridiculous like that,

15:56.460 --> 16:01.460
but I think that, I don't remember which Assassin's Creed that was,

16:01.460 --> 16:04.460
but like I said, not a franchise I'm into, but it looks cool.

16:04.460 --> 16:10.460
And I don't know, Watch Dogs, more my cup of tea, and Far Cry.

16:10.460 --> 16:16.460
Although once again, Far Cry, I played a little bit of Five and never finished it.

16:16.460 --> 16:20.460
But most importantly, and I'll admit I missed the thing

16:20.460 --> 16:22.460
because I've been dealing with some other personal stuff this weekend,

16:22.460 --> 16:26.460
but was there a new trailer for a new Just Dance?

16:26.460 --> 16:30.460
Not that I saw. I missed about a minute of it.

16:30.460 --> 16:34.460
And so they did not have Just Dance.

16:34.460 --> 16:35.460
Well, that's upsetting.

16:35.460 --> 16:40.460
We don't have enough time for all of the nonsense that they would pull off for that.

16:40.460 --> 16:44.460
So no Just Dance this time. Maybe they'll kick off the next one.

16:44.460 --> 16:47.460
But yeah, I mean, I'm all right.

16:47.460 --> 16:51.460
I think there's a random aside, but I think there's a huge sale on PlayStation.

16:51.460 --> 16:53.460
It seems like they always have some type of sale going on,

16:53.460 --> 16:55.460
like they're just rotating them in week after week right now.

16:55.460 --> 16:59.460
Well, they were giving away Watch Dogs 2 on PC for free.

16:59.460 --> 17:02.460
I couldn't log into my Ubisoft account. Surprise.

17:02.460 --> 17:03.460
Oh, no.

17:03.460 --> 17:07.460
So they are like I remember my password and everything,

17:07.460 --> 17:12.460
but I tried resetting it because for whatever reason it wasn't working

17:12.460 --> 17:16.460
and I never got an email to reset it. So I was locked out.

17:16.460 --> 17:20.460
I was going to say with the PlayStation sale, the latest Just Dance, like 2020,

17:20.460 --> 17:23.460
is down to like 15 bucks or something like that.

17:23.460 --> 17:26.460
And I was tempted. I'll tell you, I was tempted to pick it up.

17:26.460 --> 17:28.460
I have no idea how those games control anymore.

17:28.460 --> 17:31.460
Like, do they use the camera? Do they use the controller?

17:31.460 --> 17:33.460
I heard there's I think maybe an iPhone app.

17:33.460 --> 17:34.460
I think it's the phone.

17:34.460 --> 17:35.460
Yeah, I think that makes sense.

17:35.460 --> 17:39.460
I think it's your phone now.

17:39.460 --> 17:42.460
I don't think that they use the camera anymore.

17:42.460 --> 17:45.460
Oh, Bobby Blackwolf confirms they use your mobile phone,

17:45.460 --> 17:49.460
which makes sense because mobile phones are like the universal controller these days.

17:49.460 --> 17:52.460
You know, don't you guys have phones?

17:52.460 --> 17:55.460
I just want to bust out DDR.

17:55.460 --> 17:56.460
It works for Jackbox.

17:56.460 --> 18:00.460
I wish I would love a modern like DDR game,

18:00.460 --> 18:03.460
like DDR Ace or something on PlayStation four or five.

18:03.460 --> 18:06.460
I'd live for that. I would be so happy.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.460
I don't know why they won't do it.

18:08.460 --> 18:11.460
Like Konami just doesn't see the money in it or something like I,

18:11.460 --> 18:15.460
I would be so thrilled when make money off of it.

18:15.460 --> 18:17.460
It's very niche for them.

18:17.460 --> 18:20.460
They're going to make Apache slot.

18:20.460 --> 18:23.460
I wish they would just release the PC versions as the software runs on PC.

18:23.460 --> 18:25.460
Anyways, it wouldn't be that difficult.

18:25.460 --> 18:29.460
I mean, I know it's not difficult to port it because if you know where the look,

18:29.460 --> 18:31.460
you can get it to run on your PC.

18:31.460 --> 18:39.460
So I don't understand why they don't do something like that and have songs available or I don't know.

18:39.460 --> 18:41.460
I mean, I guess they're trying to do that with that.

18:41.460 --> 18:49.460
What was the one S or I don't remember the one that they had online recently that was running in unity that we tried it.

18:49.460 --> 18:50.460
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:50.460 --> 18:51.460
It was real quick.

18:51.460 --> 18:54.460
That just means they need to bust out the Dreamcast.

18:55.460 --> 18:57.460
Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

18:57.460 --> 18:59.460
You have to stick to the oldies.

18:59.460 --> 19:00.460
I guess this is what it is.

19:00.460 --> 19:07.460
I guess maybe they feel dance games have to have these camera and full body motion things

19:07.460 --> 19:12.460
because we've kind of lived through the era of Kinect and things like Dance Central

19:12.460 --> 19:16.460
and that now that like maybe a dance pad alone isn't good enough.

19:16.460 --> 19:18.460
I'm using my quoting fingers, good enough.

19:18.460 --> 19:25.460
When I I don't know, like I feel like DDR, there's still there are all these new kids playing DDR at the arcade now.

19:25.460 --> 19:26.460
And I don't I don't recognize them.

19:26.460 --> 19:30.460
There's a whole new DDR community, even though like DDR freak isn't really around anymore.

19:30.460 --> 19:34.460
But they're they're forming around things like Facebook and Twitter and so forth.

19:34.460 --> 19:42.460
I believe there are music game podcasts that which is really ironic because that's where we started.

19:42.460 --> 19:43.460
But there's a whole new class.

19:43.460 --> 19:46.460
There's like a new class of like music gaming podcast.

19:46.460 --> 19:50.460
And we don't you know, we don't follow that stuff as closely anymore.

19:50.460 --> 19:58.460
But the reason why I bring all that up is that I feel like there is a whole new fandom for those types of games.

19:58.460 --> 20:03.460
And I think, you know, if they were to just try to do a DDR on PlayStation four or five,

20:03.460 --> 20:08.460
it would be not just something for the old fans like us, but the new fans as well.

20:08.460 --> 20:09.460
I really wish they'd give it a shot.

20:09.460 --> 20:14.460
But I can understand that there's a risk when it comes with like the peripherals.

20:14.460 --> 20:18.460
So maybe they need to focus on something that's a little more like a button music game.

20:18.460 --> 20:21.460
And then it's like, oh, but you can use the peripheral as well.

20:21.460 --> 20:27.460
I don't have all those peripherals that they'd made for the I mean, let's just here's how silly like their priorities are.

20:27.460 --> 20:31.460
So like I understand that peripherals aren't necessarily high on their radar,

20:31.460 --> 20:35.460
but at the same time, didn't they just have a whole bunch of peripherals for their mobile games?

20:35.460 --> 20:40.460
I mean, like I can we repurpose some of that stuff?

20:40.460 --> 20:42.460
Yeah, I don't know.

20:42.460 --> 20:48.460
Anyway, I didn't mean to go on a dance game tangent by talking about just dance, but maybe I did a little bit.

20:48.460 --> 20:52.460
I don't know. So well, there's going to be a lot of people who are happy about just dance stuff,

20:52.460 --> 20:58.460
because I mean, especially with this going on with the pandemic, it's a good way to get some exercise.

20:58.460 --> 21:02.460
I mean, honestly, an announcement about just dance is timely.

21:02.460 --> 21:06.460
Yeah, actually, that's part of the reason when I saw the sale, I honestly considered getting it.

21:06.460 --> 21:09.460
And I still might because I think the sale is on through Thursday or what have you.

21:09.460 --> 21:12.460
And it's considering it. It's exactly for that.

21:12.460 --> 21:16.460
I've been trying very hard to go outside and get exercise and go walking.

21:16.460 --> 21:19.460
But the reality is, it was one hundred and five today here in SAC.

21:19.460 --> 21:23.460
And so I'm like, yeah, I went out in it for 10 minutes.

21:23.460 --> 21:28.460
Yikes. I don't know how hot it is in my garage in order to play DDR.

21:28.460 --> 21:31.460
So like it's like one hundred and twenty degrees in there.

21:31.460 --> 21:37.460
In the words in the words of the great Jasmine Masters. No, ma'am.

21:37.460 --> 21:46.460
No. Oh, ma'am. Although I hurt my hip a few weeks ago and re sprained it tripping over the cat.

21:46.460 --> 21:55.460
Going outside in the weather for just a little bit makes me understand why old people move to Arizona.

21:55.460 --> 22:02.460
I was like, oh, it doesn't hurt for five seconds. Oh, it's hot.

22:02.460 --> 22:08.460
Pele Hanumea in chat brings up Beat Saber and says Beat Saber type games are replacing them.

22:08.460 --> 22:13.460
I mean, I think there's always going to be like that fresh new thing in any type of genre.

22:13.460 --> 22:20.460
And music games are not immune to that either, because like there was DDR and then there was Guitar Hero.

22:20.460 --> 22:24.460
Right. And Rock Band, the plastic instruments really dominated that conversation for a long time.

22:24.460 --> 22:30.460
And you're right. You're right. A lot of the VR and music is Beat Saber is very strong in that department, too.

22:30.460 --> 22:32.460
And I think because of Beat Saber's success,

22:32.460 --> 22:38.460
you're even seeing non VR things that are trying to do the Beat Saber thing, even though Beat Saber is.

22:38.460 --> 22:44.460
And that's another discussion. But I can kind of see that that every genre kind of has its you know,

22:44.460 --> 22:48.460
this is the hot new thing in the genre right now. So.

22:48.460 --> 22:53.460
Even when we were you know, we even when we were young kids right around the time this show started,

22:53.460 --> 22:59.460
I feel like, you know, we were all playing DDR and then and then one day dark soccer,

22:59.460 --> 23:05.460
because this was the day that you and I met one day Milpitas Golf Land got a paraparaparadise.

23:05.460 --> 23:08.460
Yes. And we finally knew half the routine.

23:08.460 --> 23:13.460
We had to go see it because it was like, but it's DDR, but it's like you're using your hands.

23:13.460 --> 23:18.460
It's a new thing. It's crazy. Yeah, it's new. Exactly. It's new.

23:18.460 --> 23:26.460
Anyway. All right. Well, we have the pink biscuits of doom collecting dust somewhere.

23:26.460 --> 23:31.460
Oh, and not the knockoff green biscuits of doom that I think was the other game they put it on Dreamcast.

23:31.460 --> 23:36.460
Some other company gets, I believe. Yeah. Anyway. All right.

23:36.460 --> 23:40.460
I don't remember you having a bunch of weird stuff on Dreamcast, so. Yeah.

23:40.460 --> 23:47.460
Anyway. OK, so that's that's that for Ubisoft to devolve for, even though it devolved into conversation on old school music games.

23:47.460 --> 23:52.460
But hey, that's our audience. Right. And by the way, dark soccer, since I have to say it at some point,

23:52.460 --> 23:56.460
while while Loki was trying to be serious and read the news there.

23:56.460 --> 24:03.460
Thank you, Loki. You're in the background changing wigs and playing with our chat room and making all these faces.

24:03.460 --> 24:07.460
You keep you keep doing like these all the like. Mm hmm.

24:07.460 --> 24:17.460
I'm moving on to three because this one is my wigs have been disused because I'm not doing any cons or anything.

24:17.460 --> 24:23.460
So and, you know, I'm not like going all out and wearing a wig cap and doing it right now that I'm not pinning it or anything.

24:23.460 --> 24:32.460
I'm just going on the wig like this one. I still have yet to trim the lace on it just because this was going to be some work.

24:33.460 --> 24:38.460
I don't have wigs. I just have hats. All right.

24:38.460 --> 24:43.460
Anyway, also some stuff in chat talking about drop mix a little bit.

24:43.460 --> 24:48.460
Bobby saying I enjoy drop mix and fuser is basically a digital version of drop mix.

24:48.460 --> 24:51.460
Yeah. Yeah. Their other game that they have coming out. Yeah.

24:51.460 --> 24:55.460
Miltonious Games in chat says, yeah, I like the music mixing of drop mix.

24:55.460 --> 24:58.460
So just being able to do that without physical cards sounds good.

24:58.460 --> 25:03.460
Yeah. I think there was fun just in like mixing stuff on that game.

25:03.460 --> 25:07.460
So I'm excited. Is fuser out? I didn't think it was out yet. Right.

25:07.460 --> 25:10.460
I think it's out yet. Yeah. Out soonish in the next couple of months.

25:10.460 --> 25:15.460
So I'll check that out, though, because I do have a drop mix thing, but I've played it like twice.

25:15.460 --> 25:19.460
I think it'll be fun to try the digital one, I think. All right.

25:19.460 --> 25:25.460
Anyhow, let's move on and talk about the types of games that we have been playing this week in a segment called How Is Your Gaming Week?

25:25.460 --> 25:31.460
Dark Sakura, how is your gaming week? I played something that was an animal crossing.

25:31.460 --> 25:35.460
What? I didn't play a lot of Animal Crossing. OK.

25:35.460 --> 25:40.460
But I want to start off with my little rant about Animal Crossing. OK. OK.

25:40.460 --> 25:45.460
So we get to go swimming in the ocean. We can dive.

25:45.460 --> 25:51.460
We can get pearls, you know, or can we because I haven't got one yet.

25:51.460 --> 25:57.460
I have I have three. Wow. And one of them I got on my alt and you get Pascal.

25:57.460 --> 26:02.460
And that was fun. I found out that if you talk to him like at the top of above your island,

26:02.460 --> 26:08.460
you can actually watch him swim off into the distance and watch him eat the the scallop that he begged you for.

26:08.460 --> 26:13.460
Oh, I've seen him. I've seen him like go off, but I've never seen him actually eat the scallop.

26:13.460 --> 26:18.460
That's cute. I had to. I tried to get some shots of it earlier, but it didn't quite work out.

26:18.460 --> 26:24.460
So. But and this is a big mix a lot size sitting on a butt.

26:24.460 --> 26:32.460
But OK. You can dive off the pier and people like, OK, that's pretty cool.

26:32.460 --> 26:45.460
But not people who do lots and lots of trading where you have strangers come into your town who think they can run over your flowers and cut all your fruit and dig up your plant.

26:45.460 --> 26:53.460
Well, I mean, I guess I can't really dig up your plants if they're not besties, but it's like a lot of people take a lot of pride in their little towns.

26:53.460 --> 26:58.460
I take pride in my little town and my town is fucking adorable. Deal with it.

26:58.460 --> 27:09.460
But like. You jump off and you can't block people out of running amok all over your town, you know, like it's just it's just not good.

27:09.460 --> 27:16.460
And I found a place to leave feedback for Nintendo, so I'm going to do it. But like this shit don't fly.

27:16.460 --> 27:29.460
I've heard this complaint on Twitter and social media. Some people are not happy about how the diving off the pier kind of leads to that sort of exploit, which I think Nintendo probably didn't think of because I don't know.

27:29.460 --> 27:36.460
They did it on purpose. Maybe. Well, it's getting in the way of our intended vision for how you play the game.

27:36.460 --> 27:49.460
Well, and that was a point that came up when I was talking about it with my friends is that is this Nintendo trying to take a little jab at some of the like the fact that, you know, we're inviting so many people online, especially with the turnip game.

27:49.460 --> 27:59.460
Right. Like we've all any of us that have had spiked turnips probably had strangers on our island to help sell the turnips, whether it was like friend of a friend or, you know, through a community or something.

27:59.460 --> 28:07.460
And maybe Nintendo's kind of trying to jab at that a little bit where it's like, you know, we really just want you to have people that like you actually know on your island.

28:07.460 --> 28:16.460
But I at the same time, like I'm kind of like maybe that's Nintendo's perspective, but at the same time, I'm kind of like I think that's the fun of it is meeting people through this.

28:16.460 --> 28:27.460
I think I don't think they just I don't think they anticipated that it would be used in that manner, to be honest, because there's a lot of design decisions that they made in there that doesn't seem to make any sense.

28:27.460 --> 28:35.460
Like, for example, whoever whoever plays the game first is the mayor of the town, basically, and gets to make all the decisions where everybody else doesn't really get to do that.

28:35.460 --> 28:40.460
And what with that? Well, I understand that. And that's what they probably thought.

28:40.460 --> 28:46.460
Well, when most people are just complaining by themselves, it's fine. But I have a family and we all play on the switch.

28:46.460 --> 28:51.460
And unfortunately, my youngest son is the one that played it first just by happenstance.

28:51.460 --> 28:57.460
And so now he has to make all the decisions and it's really annoying.

28:57.460 --> 29:05.460
Yeah. And so, like, you know, we can't progress or progress in the game because, like, he's got all of the decisions that need to be made.

29:05.460 --> 29:12.460
And he doesn't like our current administration here in America.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.460
You have a small child in charge.

29:15.460 --> 29:19.460
Well, it's it's it's not as bad as that.

29:19.460 --> 29:25.460
You know, the worst the worst thing we have going on is there's like waterfalls in some weird places now.

29:25.460 --> 29:29.460
But, you know, other than that, it's it's been all right. Well, you can terraform to you.

29:29.460 --> 29:34.460
You've got that power. So I'm not laughing because it's funny. I'm laughing because it's true.

29:34.460 --> 29:39.460
I'm crying inside. But but at any rate, I wanted to address that.

29:39.460 --> 29:49.460
And I mean, I also wonder if this might be Nintendo's way to sort of get past the people who are selling things for money, you know, like selling like charging.

29:49.460 --> 29:54.460
And then you pay like certain miles tickets or something. And it's ridiculous.

29:54.460 --> 29:58.460
And I whatever you know what I.

29:58.460 --> 30:09.460
But there are people who are using it just to enhance their, you know, play their enjoyment of the game, who want to sell their turnips and want to trade items and catalog.

30:09.460 --> 30:13.460
And I mean, but now, like I was I was veering out a little bit.

30:13.460 --> 30:18.460
I was venturing. I was I was letting new people into town. And now I'm back on lockdown.

30:18.460 --> 30:26.460
Now, people who come visit me are my friends. Fort Sakura is closed.

30:26.460 --> 30:30.460
Well, and the other will call it's gone back to being a dream.

30:30.460 --> 30:41.460
Spoilers, but you know, and there's a few people in in my Facebook group that I would let in just because I've seen them be good players.

30:41.460 --> 30:55.460
I've gotten positive feedback on them. I've had them in the town before. I, I think they would be trustworthy, but I don't really go outside of that group anymore, except for maybe a few co workers because we have an Animal Crossing group at my work.

30:55.460 --> 31:04.460
You know, though, he and you know the star sucker I kind of closed Facebook a couple weeks ago just because for my own reasons I'm just over Facebook.

31:04.460 --> 31:19.460
But one thing I do kind of miss are those groups because I just had a villager move out two days ago Gigi left, and I was okay with her going because she was a duplicate type she already had a snooty type, but you know I have like maybe like one messenger group

31:19.460 --> 31:33.460
that I can kind of send does anybody want Gigi and like literally nobody had an empty plot that day anyway. So it was kind of pointless I was like, well, I guess to the abyss she goes because I don't like it on a normal day I would have posted a group.

31:33.460 --> 31:37.460
She'll go into a pool I think of your for your last 10 visitors.

31:37.460 --> 31:46.460
Oh, interesting. Okay, so if someone gets an opening there's a chance that she might show up at the campsite or on another island. Hmm. Okay.

31:46.460 --> 32:00.460
I believe that's how it works. I have heard that villagers will move and say they're from another place. If you don't recruit somebody I recruited a normal type to replace her because that's the one thing I needed.

32:00.460 --> 32:13.460
Yeah, I'm going to be since I've got, I think, all of the DIY is from the villagers that I'm going to, I don't have to have the different types now in my town so I'm going to be.

32:13.460 --> 32:21.460
I already promised him to Gwen, but when it's going to get my Octavian when I bring in either Bruce or Marshall, I haven't decided.

32:21.460 --> 32:33.460
Do you know who Alan let go this week and I couldn't believe it. Marina, Marina, I can't believe Oh yeah that's right. He, he still has, he still has Facebook so he probably Oh yeah I think he gave, I think he did give her away.

32:33.460 --> 32:35.460
I think so I think somebody got her.

32:35.460 --> 32:47.460
So she didn't go I was, I was so close to trying, I didn't have an opening but I would have loved to have claimed Marina, because I have the other two octopus octopi.

32:47.460 --> 32:56.460
Because I have sucker and Octavian and we're never getting rid of sucker, because he's my special child. Yeah, I will I will never let catch up leave on my own.

32:56.460 --> 32:59.460
Julian go because I have his card.

32:59.460 --> 33:14.460
And, you know, sometimes the queen needs to move and Julian being my unicorn drag queen. Sometimes she needs to just feel her oats, how, how do you get okay so like I know if you work on your friendship and you give a lot of random gifts.

33:14.460 --> 33:27.460
You are actually like I use the app to show like what gifts somebody really prefers. So I tried to do that and and eventually catch up gave me a photo of herself and I love that and from what I understand, that's like the ultimate prize from a villager

33:27.460 --> 33:31.460
right like if they, if they give you a photo, that's it, you've done it you've maxed everything out.

33:31.460 --> 33:40.460
So now I'm trying to okay so I'm trying to get others so I'm trying to get one from poncho, who's my little jock bear. And I think he's adorable.

33:40.460 --> 33:52.460
And so I keep like every day, I give him a wrapped coconut, because I know if nothing else you get a decent amount of points from a wrapped coconut right, you get a decent amount of points from your wrapped native fruit.

33:52.460 --> 33:54.460
Oh do you okay.

33:54.460 --> 34:10.460
But my thing is that I like giving them close because I like to make them wear ridiculous stuff, I just make sure it's in their favorite color. Hmm. Okay, so for Agnes, she gets black and gray for Dina, she gets to wear a lot of plaid green, you know, I put her in the flannels

34:10.460 --> 34:14.460
I put her in sportswear she's my lesbian.

34:14.460 --> 34:18.460
I put Rosie and reds and pinks.

34:18.460 --> 34:30.460
I put Julian and blues and purples. Right now he's wearing the vampire clothes and he loves the hell out of that. Roscoe gets mostly black and red and it's all like punk kind of you know hardcore stuff.

34:30.460 --> 34:40.460
I put kind of how that's how cherry cherry likes to dress that way to cherries like a hot topic worker. I had cherry in New Leaf.

34:41.460 --> 34:53.460
I like cherry. Gotcha. But, you know, it's funny though I have a lot of my OG, you know, my original people, cherry would wear that wig you're wearing.

34:53.460 --> 35:02.460
Well, it's gonna get changed after this segment but you know, I have actually a lot of my original characters except I have Dom and Dom is great.

35:03.460 --> 35:05.460
He's my little wannabe fluffball buff guy.

35:05.460 --> 35:13.460
I will tell you my newest villager so you know I went searching for a normal type and I just took the first one I found. Are you ready for the name of the villager I got?

35:13.460 --> 35:24.460
I got Norma. Norma the normal. Norma the normal. She's a cow. She's cute. So, anyway.

35:25.460 --> 35:38.460
Okay, and I think the internet just froze because I've completely lost the video connection and I'm really worried that it's going to drop completely here in a moment because, yeah, this is really not good.

35:38.460 --> 35:45.460
So, I think what I'm going to do is, oh, I'm still on Twitch. It's just Discord that slowed down.

35:45.460 --> 35:54.460
Okay, so apparently I've completely lost connection on Discord with my co-host. So, we're gonna just see what happens here.

35:54.460 --> 36:06.460
Discord may have had a hiccup or something like that. Not sure. So, I would, yeah, Jamie's in a very stunning pose where she's frozen, isn't it?

36:06.460 --> 36:18.460
Anyway, okay. So, I guess I don't have a choice for the moment. What should I do? I'm going to turn it off and turn it on and off again. Off and on again.

36:18.460 --> 36:26.460
And see if that helps. So, let's see what happens if I'm going to disconnect from that. And then I'm going to try to reconnect to that and see if I get my co-host back.

36:26.460 --> 36:34.460
And nope, I'm just getting the, oh, nope, nope. Oh, I might have got him back. How about that? Turning it off and on again fixed it. What's that?

36:34.460 --> 36:36.460
I didn't have time to change my wig.

36:36.460 --> 36:42.460
Oh, that's okay. It was a little unexpected hiccup there, but that's the perils of doing a live show. Okay, sorry.

36:42.460 --> 36:45.460
I was saying that you stole Dina the first time at my GameCube village.

36:45.460 --> 36:50.460
I did, I did. Sorry, it was a little awkward hiccup and I was talking about Norma the Normal, who's a cow.

36:50.460 --> 36:56.460
Yeah. So, I was saying that since you stole Dina last time, you get first dibs on Dina this time.

36:56.460 --> 37:01.460
Okay, yay. Now, you mentioned you played other stuff, yeah.

37:01.460 --> 37:07.460
Yes, I got The Last of Us. I got the remastered one. I do want to play Last of Us 2.

37:07.460 --> 37:13.460
So, I figured I should start at the beginning. That and a friend of mine has talked and talked and talked it up.

37:13.460 --> 37:20.460
So, I was like, okay, I'm doing it. And I really enjoyed it. It's kind of, well, you know, I was having these problems with my hands.

37:20.460 --> 37:26.460
And I do have a little bit of that problem again with holding a PlayStation controller for too long.

37:26.460 --> 37:31.460
And the control scheme is one of those, every button does everything. The menus are weird.

37:31.460 --> 37:37.460
So, it's a little bit of getting used to it. But yeah, I cried ugly in the first 10 minutes, you know.

37:37.460 --> 37:45.460
So, I had myself a little silence up. And I really like it so far. The remastered one looks really good.

37:45.460 --> 37:50.460
The voice acting is, is really good. And you know me, I'm piggy on voice acting.

37:50.460 --> 38:01.460
So, I really, I'm really enjoying it so far. And then I'm still playing Words with Friends, because I'm kind of addicted and you know I'm a word nerd.

38:01.460 --> 38:16.460
But there's like this mode in Words with Friends that like I really like. I think it's called like word circle, where you get like a set of letters, and you have to make, you know, as many different words out of it and they kind of are crossword style, right.

38:16.460 --> 38:29.460
And I like that because I don't know what it is, I guess that Words with Friends thinks that people doing that mode. I have no vocabulary because I'm like, you got a hidden word, you got a hidden word, you got a hidden word.

38:29.460 --> 38:45.460
I'm like, but I want the words out of the puzzle. You know, and so I actually found a game that is the same thing and like it's got ads so, but it's not as bad but it must think that that, you know, toddler because it's called Words with Friends.

38:45.460 --> 38:47.460
I kind of enjoy it.

38:47.460 --> 38:56.460
And I'm waiting to get more, more stuff in pattern, because I love pattern, and I'm very very sad that there are no more puzzles for me to do.

38:56.460 --> 39:03.460
I'm back to playing like the mahjong puzzle games too because I can do it mindlessly while I'm doing other things.

39:04.460 --> 39:16.460
Oh, oh, oh, and new acquisition of Bloodstained Curse of the Moon 2 which I know we're going to discuss in a bit. Dan is on it. He loves it.

39:16.460 --> 39:18.460
I love Zangetsu.

39:18.460 --> 39:32.460
I love how completely off like the, the other Bloodstained game that this is like every one of these Curse of the Moon ones both of these are like two different universes almost just with the same characters kind of au shenanigans.

39:32.460 --> 39:35.460
But it's really cool the music's great.

39:35.460 --> 39:42.460
Dan seems to really enjoy it I have other games to play and Dan is taking taking it over.

39:42.460 --> 39:53.460
And sometimes it's really hard to play some games when we also have our more recent acquisition in pinball in the other room which is AC DC one of the limited editions.

39:53.460 --> 40:10.460
And we are borrowing Guardians of the Galaxy right now so it's kind of annoying because I catch myself singing along with like the soundtrack as we're going along, and to the point where I've got stuck on a feeling on my head and repeat, and I sing it to the cat.

40:10.460 --> 40:12.460
That's my gaming week.

40:12.460 --> 40:25.460
Alright, nice. I will be very curious. I almost feel like you're just discovery path with the last of us is, you know, this is the type of thing we've done before like both you and I arrived to the Mass Effect series like we were very late to the party.

40:25.460 --> 40:27.460
We were very fast.

40:27.460 --> 40:30.460
We looked fierce in those wigs.

40:30.460 --> 40:41.460
But we showed up late to the party and played the whole trilogy and it's like now we're in love with that. So I'm very curious, even though I don't see myself taking that same adventure through the last of us because I told you this before.

40:41.460 --> 40:49.460
I don't think I'm okay with the level of violence in those games for me personally, you know, and again this is just a personal thing like again, I'm not saying they're bad games.

40:49.460 --> 40:56.460
In fact, from everything I've heard about them and I have spoiled myself on the second one I'm not gonna be a jerk and say anything, but I know I'm not going to play us I kind of spoiled myself.

40:56.460 --> 41:13.460
And after reading about it I was like, okay, I can see where that is really like that's like definitely thought provoking like it's definitely like a, and that's what really know what you're talking about it's about the don't spoil it for our listeners, but it's

41:14.460 --> 41:26.460
the one thing that's got parts of the community up in arms. Yeah, it's an art should make you should be thought provoking so I think in that regard.

41:26.460 --> 41:34.460
If, if art makes you go, or, you know, then it's not doing what it's supposed to art is supposed to be provocative. Yeah.

41:34.460 --> 41:37.460
So, just like that way of Jamie's wearing.

41:37.460 --> 41:41.460
Oh, hey, wait till you see the next one. It sucks.

41:41.460 --> 41:43.460
All right, low key.

41:43.460 --> 41:46.460
Low key. How was your gaming week.

41:46.460 --> 41:52.460
So I did play a few things this week, mainly Minecraft is still.

41:52.460 --> 42:03.460
I mean just still building more complex things. I dug out a third basement in the house so it's just massive I really need to do a video for it.

42:03.460 --> 42:15.460
And then, aside from that Orna, and then I played a bit of the Devolver land Expo. And also I played a little bit of Animal Crossing.

42:15.460 --> 42:22.460
I finally got my tent into a house. And that was about it.

42:22.460 --> 42:24.460
That's it.

42:24.460 --> 42:26.460
Yeah, that's it. All right.

42:26.460 --> 42:41.460
Then let's talk about my gaming week and the types of games I've played this week, I played also Minecraft, that might shock you, but there was a there was a little I actually bought into one of those little ad ad things that was on my Xbox dashboard, because

42:41.460 --> 42:50.460
I was in the game pass section and it said there was some new add on that was like a runner type thing and it kind of had like a futuristic look to it I was like oh is this like a chart everything.

42:50.460 --> 43:05.460
So there's like a free custom game add on thing that they have. It's like and it's that's what it is an endless runner you're basically jumping over the things and collecting items and so forth, while the background is like slowly trying to catch up to you.

43:06.460 --> 43:20.460
It's just really cool like I knew this was happening that people are building meta games in Minecraft, and that Minecraft in a way is almost its own game creation engine at this point too, but it's just it's neat to I admittedly have not played a lot of the products

43:20.460 --> 43:33.460
that's come from that. So I like that Microsoft is kind of giving this one, a little boost by making it free obviously to check out, but also just kind of like showing us that hey look at the crazy things people are doing in Minecraft, because I did play it a few

43:33.460 --> 43:41.460
months ago. I mean it's, yeah, it's not lots of you've played this game before it's nothing earth shattering but it was just kind of cool that was in Minecraft.

43:41.460 --> 43:55.460
There's lots of like different little game modes and stuff that people make that are some of them can be pretty complex like they have sky block is a pretty popular game mode and they have a lot of these like infinite sky blocks and stuff that'll kind of keep the game

43:56.460 --> 44:17.460
What I like about those is it kind of gives you more objectives to try to hit. I know in the Java version they've added more of these. It's not achievements, they call them like advancements, I guess, and it's like little mini goals to kind of keep you motivated in the game, even after you beat stuff.

44:17.460 --> 44:31.460
And since they don't really have it yet in the pocket edition or bedrock. This is kind of cool. In the meantime, plus there's like lots of like unique game modes that you can play on all these different servers and stuff and that's all free.

44:31.460 --> 44:44.460
But yeah, and myself like I've run add ons on my realm, and some I've even created from scratch so it's it's fun to be able to do that kind of stuff and modify the game to however you want.

44:44.460 --> 45:13.460
So yeah, I love looking at that type of stuff on Minecraft that's that's been really fun and inventive. So I've been playing other stuff to the same old standbys like Orna, Pokemon Go. I've, I've oddly this week been playing probably more Ingress than I usually do like I've been going pretty hard this week and I'm sure the opposing team is like, what the hell has gotten into him? And the answer is quarantine has been a big part of that, because the nice thing about Ingress is either I'm playing outdoors like I'm walking in a big

45:14.460 --> 45:37.460
park or going to take a portal outdoors, or I'm in my car. And both of those places are pretty safe. You know what I mean? So it's like, it's yeah, it's a fun and it's like a good excuse to get out of the house and like do something, you know, because it's like, we can't just, oh, go to the mall and just hang out. Well, I mean, I guess technically you can, but you know, do I want to do that right now? Not really.

45:37.460 --> 45:46.460
Well, one of the things you're missing on Facebook is all the events for going to see movies, like drive in movies at the mall is the new thing that malls are doing, it seems like.

45:46.460 --> 46:01.460
Well, hey, you know, I understand these are these are crazy ass fucking times and they've got to do what they've got to do to stay in business. And as long as it's being respectful of the things we need to do to stop COVID from spreading, which a drive in event is, then I'm living for it.

46:01.460 --> 46:13.460
Honestly, I would give a lot to be able to go to like that drive in drag show. And I know Jamie's got to be thinking this, too. I think it's in Chicago or something. They're taking some drive in movie theater and turning it into a drag show.

46:13.460 --> 46:24.460
They're going to have drag queens perform and then like show it on the movie screens as it's happening on this stage, like way down there. And I'm like, it's kind of kind of amazing, actually. So all right.

46:24.460 --> 46:37.460
This wig needs some love. I just pulled it right out of the bag. V.G. realness and chat says, I'm loving the show within a show. Yeah, dark soccer's dark soccer's. Meanwhile, she's doing like a monologue called Wigs Upon Wigs over there.

46:37.460 --> 46:51.460
Where she's number three. She's OK. No, it's not just that you're putting on wigs. It's that you keep doing these looks to the camera. You're like, I'm a model. Don't tell. I have a secret. I'm on a video game podcast.

46:51.460 --> 47:05.460
But don't tell you like doing soccer is secret. And then you're like, I'm going to put this moment on Instagram over here. Yes, I am. Look, see, CJ is my favorite character in Animal Crossing. I wonder why.

47:06.460 --> 47:13.460
Like it's not giving me like it's like they're together anyway. All right.

47:13.460 --> 47:18.460
Anyway, other games that I've been playing this week besides those other usuals.

47:18.460 --> 47:28.460
So Soul Calibur six is on Xbox Game Pass and I played it a little bit on PC, but I was like, I'm going to play it again now that it's on Xbox.

47:28.460 --> 47:34.460
And it's really fun to get in there and design your own character. I think they did a good job with the single player campaign, too.

47:34.460 --> 47:41.460
It kind of throws back a little bit to part two, honestly, for me, although I know all the Soul Calibur games have had like, you know, kind of like a mission mode.

47:41.460 --> 47:48.460
But I'm for some reason reminded of part two. My only complaint about Soul Calibur six on Xbox. Holy shit.

47:48.460 --> 47:53.460
The loading times. Holy shit. They're bad.

47:53.460 --> 48:00.460
And maybe it's because I'm on an original Xbox, but I can and keep in mind it's on Game Pass, so it's all digital.

48:00.460 --> 48:06.460
I can't imagine how bad it would be if I still had the disk. The disk must copy everything to the drive.

48:06.460 --> 48:11.460
It's the only way it would work. But the loading times. Wow. They're they're bad. They're very noticeable.

48:11.460 --> 48:18.460
Otherwise, it's a fun game. And I like they they do some like the supers from like Super Street Fighter four and stuff.

48:18.460 --> 48:22.460
And it is really over the top stuff. So that's yeah, that's kind of fun.

48:22.460 --> 48:27.460
Bobby Blackwell says all Xbox one and PS4 games copy the whole disk to the drive.

48:27.460 --> 48:36.460
Yeah. I mean, I guess I thought there were some that would still retain like movies, but I guess that's more of a trick back from the PlayStation one and PlayStation two days.

48:36.460 --> 48:42.460
So excuse me, but I have heard Blu-ray drives are notoriously slow.

48:42.460 --> 48:48.460
That like doesn't totally surprise me. Anyway, other games I played this week.

48:48.460 --> 48:54.460
So, OK, this is bad. I can't remember the name of this game, but it's also on Game Pass.

48:54.460 --> 48:57.460
I'm hoping Loki or Dark Soccer. One of you guys knows this game.

48:57.460 --> 49:01.460
I or or our chat. I think it's called Chrono World or something like that.

49:01.460 --> 49:06.460
Maybe cross world. Somebody in channel. No, it's new. They just put it on Game Pass.

49:06.460 --> 49:11.460
Is it cross code? Is that it? Cross code. OK.

49:11.460 --> 49:17.460
OK. Sorry, it's cross code. OK. That yes, that is it. Maybe I'm thinking of the game within the game.

49:17.460 --> 49:24.460
So the whole setup is that like and maybe this is like a spoilery type of thing, but not really, because I'm only like I just beat chapter two.

49:24.460 --> 49:26.460
And this is something that comes up in chapter one.

49:26.460 --> 49:33.460
But it's like you're a character in an MMO who's been like kicked out of the MMO, basically.

49:33.460 --> 49:41.460
And now you exist like in the game master space and they go to put you back in the game.

49:41.460 --> 49:43.460
And there's a whole nother plot, I'm sure. And it goes further.

49:43.460 --> 49:47.460
But there's a whole game within a game type of element, like a dot hack or something.

49:47.460 --> 49:51.460
You and while jail. Not really. Wow. Jail. But it's a ship.

49:51.460 --> 49:55.460
You end up on a ship. But anyway, I'm actually really into it.

49:55.460 --> 50:01.460
It's funny that I can't remember all these details because I am actually really into it because it really reminds me of like Zelda.

50:01.460 --> 50:10.460
I would say like the action of a Zelda game meets the music of a Secret of Mana or Chrono Trigger type of game meets maybe that.

50:10.460 --> 50:18.460
It's a really interesting little throwback to like all of those Super Nintendo RPGs, like all at once.

50:18.460 --> 50:22.460
And I think it's kind of interesting. It has an interesting story.

50:22.460 --> 50:27.460
Like I wasn't expecting some of those like, oh, this is kind of the direction it's going.

50:27.460 --> 50:30.460
It's interesting. I like it.

50:30.460 --> 50:37.460
Going in chat. As 200 Matt says, so Tron. I don't know. Maybe a little bit. A little bit Tron.

50:37.460 --> 50:41.460
Like dot hack meets something else.

50:41.460 --> 50:49.460
Yeah. Or that's what Sia Dabiri says. Dot hack meets Wreck-It Ralph. Yeah, there's that, too.

50:49.460 --> 50:57.460
So, yeah, I'm into it. Yeah. And if you like those old Super Nintendo type of games, especially if you have Xbox Game Pass,

50:57.460 --> 51:01.460
because I see Miltonius Games in chat says, I guess I'm downloading this. Interesting.

51:01.460 --> 51:05.460
If you have Xbox Game Pass, by all means, get it, because it's good.

51:05.460 --> 51:09.460
But it is also on Switch. And I think it's on all the consoles.

51:09.460 --> 51:17.460
I don't see why it wouldn't be on PlayStation. So I would say, you know, I don't think it's probably an expensive game, maybe 15, 20 bucks.

51:17.460 --> 51:21.460
And if you enjoy those Super Nintendo types of games, I'm sure this is going to be right up your alley.

51:21.460 --> 51:26.460
So I would I would recommend it. So I'm hoping to play more of that. That's for sure.

51:26.460 --> 51:33.460
Bobby says it was released on PC in 2019 and it's on PC Game Pass.

51:33.460 --> 51:37.460
So somehow I just missed it on the PC version. I've been playing it on Xbox.

51:37.460 --> 51:44.460
But whatever that happens sometimes, it's like, oh, I didn't know this game was on PC because I found it on my console first or vice versa.

51:44.460 --> 51:49.460
So like that pinball game I played a few weeks ago was on, which is the one I said Dark Soccer should play.

51:49.460 --> 51:53.460
It was on Xbox Game Pass that just totally remind me of like Devil's Crush.

51:53.460 --> 52:01.460
I played that on PC first. But of course, it's on Xbox as well. So it just depends on, you know, where you like to get stuff.

52:02.460 --> 52:07.460
If you're done with your gaming week, there's actually one other thing I forgot about. Yeah, go for it.

52:07.460 --> 52:15.460
I'm going to be doing a charity stream in Sisterface because I'm going to be doing it, like I said, for charity through for we haven't decided on which one.

52:15.460 --> 52:22.460
But on my Twitter at Dark Sakura, I have a pull up. It's up for the rest of the week.

52:22.460 --> 52:28.460
I might extend it, but I want someone to help me pick the first of three games I'm going to start off with.

52:28.460 --> 52:35.460
So it's either going to be Dream Daddy or Hot to Full Boyfriend or I Love You, Colonel Sanders.

52:37.460 --> 52:41.460
I'm going to. That's a tough decision. Why not all three?

52:41.460 --> 52:45.460
Because I can't play all three simultaneously. There's only one me.

52:45.460 --> 52:49.460
Have you tried? I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

52:49.460 --> 52:55.460
It'd be like just like different recordings of me in different wigs, you know, all in the same Sisterface.

52:55.460 --> 53:00.460
Yeah. But then you'll get to see my real drag. All right. Well, that'll be fun.

53:00.460 --> 53:05.460
My real drag. Make sure you send me the details on when I can make sure we're hosting it here at VOG.

53:05.460 --> 53:09.460
So I'm still working on on the on the details, but it's coming up.

53:09.460 --> 53:14.460
I'm just right now gathering the stuff together. But you will see Dark Sakura.

53:14.460 --> 53:19.460
You'll see the Kiki. Good times. All right. All right.

53:19.460 --> 53:23.460
Well, that's it for our gaming weeks. We're going to get into some gaming news just real quickly.

53:23.460 --> 53:30.460
First, I just want to put like a personal thing out there. And don't worry, this won't be as yelling as last week.

53:30.460 --> 53:41.460
Although this says this has been a rough week. Those of you that follow me on Twitter know that my dad had an urgent situation on Friday morning and I had to go over to his house and call 911 on him.

53:41.460 --> 53:50.460
And it turns out that he actually had a stroke. So I'm really glad that I did call 911 on him that because I actually I thought he had a concussion.

53:50.460 --> 53:54.460
And I was like, well, he needs to be evaluated for this. And I don't I don't want to move him or whatever.

53:54.460 --> 54:00.460
So luckily, even though I figured it was the wrong thing, it kind of led to all the right decisions.

54:00.460 --> 54:06.460
So I'm thankful I got him in when he did, because it does seem like he will be OK.

54:06.460 --> 54:15.460
He's going to need to go through some physical therapy and so forth. This whole thing's been very scary, but it could have been a lot worse if we'd let it go longer or what have you.

54:15.460 --> 54:21.460
So anyway, my point is, I don't want to burden you too much with with sad news or what have you.

54:21.460 --> 54:30.460
But I did want to just say thank you because I know a lot of you have said some very kind things on Twitter, as well as, you know, the Vogue Network Discord and places like that.

54:30.460 --> 54:37.460
So I just want to take a minute to really thank you guys for the support and everything. And yeah, it means a lot.

54:37.460 --> 54:43.460
So thank you very much. So. All right. We can go back to video games. Loki.

54:43.460 --> 54:48.460
All right. So let's talk a little bit about Epic and Sony.

54:48.460 --> 54:55.460
So Epic Games, of course, really big or trying to be big in the PC space.

54:55.460 --> 55:00.460
And before you had a lot of money going into them from Tencent and whatnot.

55:00.460 --> 55:14.460
But now we have Sony actually purchasing 250 million dollars of stake in the company and they're promising to, I guess, collaborate with them.

55:14.460 --> 55:29.460
So throughout our investment, we explore opportunities for further collaboration with Epic to delight and bring value to consumers and the industry at large, not only in games, but also across rapidly evolving digital entertainment landscapes.

55:30.460 --> 55:48.460
So I have no idea what that's supposed to mean as far as, you know, maybe exclusives for certain things, maybe with the trend of a lot of their PC titles coming to their PlayStation 4 titles coming to PC, that it'll continue going to epic first.

55:48.460 --> 55:53.460
Well, something to think about, too. And Bobby talked a little bit about this on his show.

55:53.460 --> 55:58.460
I'm going to get into that in a moment. But I'm certainly Sony is more than just a video game company.

55:58.460 --> 56:05.460
Sony also is in the habit of doing, you know, music and movies and they're a multi type of entertainment company.

56:05.460 --> 56:11.460
So and Bobby went into this on his show a little bit. So I'll kind of like defer you to check out his show.

56:11.460 --> 56:25.460
And I'm not going to try to repeat it too much. But the gist of it is, if you look at the way some TV shows are made right now, it's not or not just TV shows, excuse me, but even some movies is that it's not necessarily just green screen.

56:25.460 --> 56:34.460
But you can have the projection of the unreal or excuse me, the unreal. Yeah. Unreal engine only virtual sets. Exactly.

56:34.460 --> 56:42.460
With the virtual sets and all of that. So if you think about it from that regard, because a lot of people are kind of joking, like, oh, 250 million.

56:42.460 --> 56:49.460
How I mean, it doesn't take fortnight long to make that much money. But maybe I mean, sure. Sure. The game thing might be part of it. Who knows?

56:49.460 --> 57:03.460
Maybe Sony's trying to buy some exclusives for fortnight. Who knows? But I think it would make a lot of sense, especially in the current state of the world with COVID and this whole thing being quite the uncertainty.

57:03.460 --> 57:08.460
And we don't know how long it's going to be before maybe we can make movies the old fashioned way again.

57:09.460 --> 57:18.460
It might make a lot of sense for Sony to be exploring these types of virtual filmmaking type of things to provide these different backgrounds.

57:18.460 --> 57:28.460
And so that maybe it would take less people on a set. I mean, obviously, it would still take a lot of people designing it and doing the programming and so forth, but they wouldn't necessarily be on the set.

57:28.460 --> 57:42.460
So it's a way to kind of do things a little more distant. So when you kind of pair those things against each other, like in a way to me, like it makes a lot of sense where a relationship like that could be really fruitful, not just necessarily gaming.

57:42.460 --> 57:44.460
Yeah, I guess we'll have to see what they do with it.

57:44.460 --> 57:53.460
Yeah. Questbuster in chat says, I mentioned this on Bobby's show, but it's interesting seeing how valuable Epic has become over the years.

57:53.460 --> 58:06.460
$250 million from Sony bought them 1.4% stake in the company. $330 million back in 2012 from Tencent bought them 40%. Yeah, that's right. The cost has gone way, way up. That's for sure.

58:06.460 --> 58:17.460
SG100Matt says, for movies and TV, everyone would just go to ILM for them to do everything that involves special effects, but that's Disney now. So not everyone wants to go Disney every time.

58:17.460 --> 58:32.460
Yeah. So I think that could be an element of it is that it's not just necessarily Fortnite as much as it might be Epic's game making abilities and the game maker engine and how that can be utilized in other mediums such as filmmaking,

58:32.460 --> 58:42.460
because I've heard of Unreal Engine being used in things like teaching, and there's other industries and other places that that engine can develop things for.

58:42.460 --> 58:55.460
I know one of the focuses that they have on the training that's online is with architecture and designing buildings and interiors, decorating that type of stuff.

58:55.460 --> 59:02.460
It's used a lot for that as well. So, yeah, be interesting to see what they do with it.

59:02.460 --> 59:07.460
Yeah, for sure. All right, well, moving on, let's talk about a new game announcement that happened this week.

59:07.460 --> 59:15.460
So Nintendo was hyping a treehouse event where they were going to be showing more footage of the new Paper Mario game, the Origami King that's coming out pretty soon.

59:15.460 --> 59:20.460
So they did a treehouse event to show some footage for that, but they also dropped on Twitter.

59:20.460 --> 59:28.460
By the way, WayForward is going to be announcing a new game that's new for them, not a new IP or something like that.

59:28.460 --> 59:35.460
And this caused social media to go fucking nuts because WayForward has done a lot of really quality retro revivals.

59:35.460 --> 59:40.460
I believe they were behind the Blaster Master Zero stuff, if I'm not mistaken, right?

59:40.460 --> 59:45.460
Certainly WayForward is synonymous with Shantae and those types of games.

59:46.460 --> 59:49.460
Didn't they do the DuckTales remaster as well?

59:49.460 --> 01:00:02.460
Yes, they did. So a lot of people, the first thing was, holy shit, Nintendo has given them Metroid, I don't know, insert fanboy thing here, and WayForward is going to announce this.

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:07.460
Well, Nintendo had to go so far as to say it's not a first party title.

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:12.460
They actually did that rare follow-up tweet where they were like, calm the fuck down. They didn't say that, but that's what I heard.

01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:16.460
Calm the fuck down, it's not a first party game, it's a third party game.

01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:23.460
But then everybody, and myself included, I was like, I would love for it. How about the Guardian Legend? How about a Konami title?

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:31.460
You know, but I did put the footnote, I did say, I know I'm just hyping myself up, these things are not going to happen and we'll just be happy with whatever it is.

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:33.460
It's time for Elibits to come back.

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:45.460
Well, imagine the internet's response. Imagine everybody hypes themselves up and imagine the response when WayForward comes out and announces, Bakugan, champions of Vestroya.

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:54.460
And everybody's like, Bakugan? The fuck is that? And that was, it came out on the Wii and if you see the art, you'll be like, oh yeah, I've seen this game before.

01:00:54.460 --> 01:01:01.460
It was a game that was on the Wii and so forth. So WayForward is bringing it back and it's a game where you can, and it's going to launch on November 3rd.

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:10.460
And you can build your own team. It's an action RPG style game. There actually is a TV series that goes with this and it's an original story that will expand on that.

01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:16.460
There's 100 different quests in the game, over 100 different quests. You collect different Bakugan, it's kind of like Pokemon like that.

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:23.460
You collect 80 different ones. There's 200 different ability types and upgrades. There will be online head-to-head multiplayer and so on.

01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:31.460
And you know, it's funny because there are a lot of people that were like, Bakugan? But there's also some people that were like, fuck yeah, I liked Bakugan. I'm glad this is coming back.

01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:39.460
So it's a little bit niche and I think, again, people set the bar really high on what they were expecting, but that's what the internet does.

01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:44.460
And if you are not used to the internet setting themselves up for disappointment, I don't know, you must be new here.

01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:54.460
But Bakugan, it's an interesting choice. I'll say that. And that's not me being shady. It just is, wow, you know, of all the different games out there, it's interesting they're going back to this one.

01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:57.460
But they have the TV series and all those tie-ins too.

01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:06.460
Miltonious Games and Chat says, that announcement made the live chat for that treehouse insufferable.

01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:11.460
Everyone being rude and impatient during the Paper Mario stuff just to be angry at the announcement.

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:22.460
For me personally, when it comes to these big events, this is why I always, always, always turn chat off and just do a full screen theater mode on my PS4.

01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:29.460
I never read chat during these types of events because the chat is shit. I just, it's horrible.

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:39.460
The only time I have ever experienced good chat rooms, I would say for the most part, the awesome games done quick, they usually have pretty good chats.

01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:48.460
But what really, like, I don't think chat will ever be this good again, was that first Bob Ross marathon they had on Twitch.

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:59.460
That was pure and wholesome. And I don't think I'll ever be in a Twitch chat, well, besides you guys, of course, I'll ever be in a Twitch chat room that great again.

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:08.460
So, yeah. Anyway, other comments in chat. I want to make sure I got what VG Realness said because it is very true.

01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:17.460
VG Realness says, always go into any type of Nintendo Direct or event with the utmost minimal expectations and you will always be satisfied.

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:22.460
After they showed Yarn Yoshi for like a year on Nintendo Directs, I learned my lesson.

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:26.460
That part. That is exactly correct.

01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:28.460
Alright.

01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:32.460
Agdefton chat says, never read chat except VOG chat. Fair.

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:36.460
Alright, moving on. Let's get into another story.

01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:41.460
So, I think this one's yours, Dark Sakura. So, you have to take a break from your meta game and your camera up there.

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:44.460
I got to do something, right?

01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:50.460
So, going back to Ubisoft, there's more drama.

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:53.460
And they actually...

01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:56.460
I'm going to step off cam for just a moment, but I'll be listening. Sorry.

01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:58.460
Wait, I'm stealing my thunder.

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.460
Okay, I see how it is.

01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:05.460
Anyway, Ubisoft has released an announcement.

01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:09.460
Yes, that was a Sailor Venus pinned RG Realness. I have the full set of the original five.

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:17.460
But at any rate, Ubisoft has announced that they are having a departure of many of their top officials.

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:23.460
Including their human resources director, their second highest official.

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:27.460
I'm going to mispronounce Serge Hasouette.

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:33.460
Hasouette has quit his post as Chief Creative Officer immediately.

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:38.460
And that his role will be taken over by the CEO, Yves Guillemot.

01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:49.460
And the quote from Guillemot says, Ubisoft has fallen short of its obligation to guarantee a safe and inclusive working environment for its employees.

01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:53.460
So, do you know what that goes back to?

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:58.460
It goes back to quite a bit more harassment and misconduct.

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:01.460
It's actually pretty terrible.

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:06.460
And I'm really glad that people are speaking up about it.

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:13.460
That people are putting their foot down and letting them know that these things won't be tolerated anymore and going very public with it.

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:15.460
We need more of this.

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:22.460
So, we're definitely seeing the resurgence of Me Too and we are seeing these voices being heard finally.

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:31.460
And so, their HR person, Cecile Corneille, has also resigned, like I said earlier.

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:38.460
And they are going to be appointing a new global human resources manager.

01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:48.460
Now, even with all of this, they are not, well, by are not, mean did not address misconduct issues during the digital showcase.

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:51.460
And I'm going to read the direct quote from their Twitter.

01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:56.460
Ubisoft Forward comes during a time of big internal change.

01:05:56.460 --> 01:06:04.460
Because all the content has been prerecorded, we want to recognize that the issues we're currently dealing with won't be addressed directly in the show.

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:07.460
We still have significant work to do and are committed to this process.

01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:10.460
We will provide more updates soon.

01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:28.460
So basically, they're not glossing over it, but it, it looks like that they are acknowledging it but I mean if this stuff was recorded then, yeah, there's no way they can time travel and do it with enough time and it's already been done.

01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:42.460
And then I mean there's also, I mean there's a bunch of other announcements come up for sexual misconduct, like over 50 in the Super Smash Brothers community.

01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:53.460
There were the ones that I spoke about a few weeks ago, and it's really time that people in, you know, especially I'm just gonna go say it.

01:06:53.460 --> 01:07:06.460
Don't go, not all men because it is enough cisgender men who are pulling this shit that we have to be wary of all of them, except the people I know.

01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:09.460
You guys are cool.

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:25.460
Trust is something that's earned. Trust is not something that's automatically granted in a position of power and I think we talked about this. I don't know if it was two weeks ago or last week but I remember having a tangent where it was, this is really a call against people in power

01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:37.460
and do they deserve that power, and if they're going to use that power for bad things that power is going to be taken away and there's going to be that accountability and I think there's a big kind of reckoning with that concept in all sorts of places right now.

01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:48.460
There's a lot of what you see with the racial injustice and the police and that whole thing is that police are in a position of power. And the reason why they have protections to let them abuse it.

01:07:48.460 --> 01:08:02.460
And so that's why people are saying they want to defund the police because these this power, if it's not being used for good things should be taken away. So my point is, is that I think that's kind of like the common thread you're seeing in a lot of these

01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:16.460
social movements that are going on right now is kind of questioning why are these people in power, are they using power for good things. Why should they continue to be in power, you know, that being said, there actually is.

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:22.460
Well, I mean it's no secret that probably my favorite other podcast out there is stuff mom never told you.

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:35.460
The July 3 episode is a really good one to listen to talking about the state of me to during the pandemic, you know, going on in July, but it brings up a lot of what's going on in the gaming community.

01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:48.460
Definitely, definitely worth a listen to it's a very good episode, and it goes into a lot of some of the same things that I've said so I think it would definitely be worth a listen to.

01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:56.460
Let me go ahead and give Matt a chance to jump in with the next story because it just like you actually referenced it a second here.

01:08:56.460 --> 01:09:16.460
Darcyra just keeps on going so you know you have, you know, allegations in major AAA companies. And of course there's been a countless, not countless but lots of allegations of misconduct in very is in gaming communities and one of those in particular

01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:30.460
is the Super Smash Brothers community. So, over the last few weeks has been about 50 different allegations made from the community regarding different people in the community.

01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:48.460
And just, it's been all sorts of things from allegations of rape sexual assault preying on minors grooming underage players I mean it's just, it's, it's ridiculous that this is just everywhere.

01:09:48.460 --> 01:10:04.460
But yeah, it's a lot of people have kind of dropped out of, you know, competing in the Smash Brothers community because of this. I know that there's been several people that have been taken out of the tournaments.

01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:14.460
I don't know how people can get their arms around this kind of stuff. It's just, I think it's just everywhere and unfortunately we are only hearing about, you know, a small percentage of them.

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:35.460
Yeah, and I mean, and I think the number I heard was that there's 50 allegations of 50 different in the Smash community. I mean, 50, 50, that is all. I mean, one is too many I mean we all know that but I mean that just really like is like holy God, you know, it's, it's, it's a tricky

01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:50.460
And it's a tricky story because on one hand you're like, I that's horrible that these events ever happened on the same token, it's coming to light and maybe we can do something about it now and clean this up because, you know, we might be you know losing these people

01:10:50.460 --> 01:11:07.460
from from the the tournament scene or whatever but think about all the people that and again this goes back to being in a position of power and what you do with that power. Think of all the people that think of all the people that other people in power suppressed from wanting to join the community.

01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:22.460
Like for for everyone who speaks up, there are other people who have not spoken up. You know there's, and, and this is just more of a general thing but at least for for people who are assigned, you know, female at birth.

01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:35.460
We are raised with this conditioning that we're just supposed to take it that this is the way it is that our voice isn't as important that we're supposed to worry about the needs of others before ourselves and we're all.

01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:46.460
Yeah, it's bullshit. We have as much right to anger. We have as much right to protect ourselves we have as much right to have power and want things as anybody.

01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:57.460
And, and I think that the old guard is starting to realize that they're losing their ground, and it's, it's really time to hold those asses to the fire. Yeah.

01:11:57.460 --> 01:12:14.460
And, you know, there's those types of things those types of traumatic experiences that people go through whether it's you know these very very very serious allegations of sexual assault or so forth or, you know, even, even folks that bully other people and use,

01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:34.460
you know their positions of power to, you know, bully or traumatize other people can can can hold people back from wanting to join a space like designing video games like entering these types of tournaments and so forth and, or maybe not wanting to be on

01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:46.460
Twitch, a few years earlier. I don't know. Anyway, well, and by statistics, women do make up half of the gamers. We are, I mean it is split.

01:12:46.460 --> 01:13:01.460
Yet, you know, it's been such a boys club for so long that, you know, there's this, you know, this myth versus the reality, and it's time. It's time for people to realize that we are half of it.

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:09.460
We deserve respect, everyone deserves respect, but it's time to start paying attention to it. It's long last time to start paying attention.

01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:13.460
I'm sorry Loki I took your story.

01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:17.460
Oh, that's fine. We bring stories to the table for discussion that's what it is.

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:26.460
Tiger con chat says you're in a place of business, and you're supposed to treat it as one. This is not some bar where you can go mingle with others and hoping you'll hook up.

01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:29.460
That's a really good point.

01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:43.460
And I know sometimes I give Tiger Claw a lot of shit for some of like the constant updates on the Sonic movie and things like that, but I'm gonna give credit where credit is due, because that is an excellent point I want y'all to think about for a little bit.

01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:56.460
Especially because we know that Twitch is a place where some people have gone to want to create their certain types of careers, right like I'm going to stream full time and that's going to be my job.

01:13:56.460 --> 01:14:13.460
Well then, you got to put on your big boy pants and treat it like a job, and exactly that. That means when you go to these mixer parties and so forth that E3 or Twitch con or something like that, you are still representing you and your brand.

01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:25.460
That is not the time to be a sleaze. Unless your brand is sleaze, I suppose, but I don't think a sleaze brand tends to do very well.

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:39.460
So, that's a very excellent point in my opinion. If you want Twitch streaming to be your job, if you want competitive video games to be your job, treat it like it's your fucking job.

01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:41.460
Because it is.

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:43.460
Because it is, and that's what you want it to be.

01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:55.460
Alright, let's see, I'm looking at other... GGRama S says true, but there is after hours which causes all this.

01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:57.460
Well, I think...

01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:59.460
Oh no, this shit happens at work.

01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:09.460
Of course, of course. But when virtualness is your workplace, right? Then it is something that kind of like always surrounds you.

01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:22.460
And again, if your workplace, if your job is you and your brand, then you've kind of picked a career where you're always on 24-7. I mean look at actors and actresses, right?

01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:32.460
Who's that guy? Is it Ezra Miller that got filmed at like a Costco or something? Like some fan goes like, choke me daddy or something.

01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:40.460
And like Ezra Miller like does it. Like full on like kind of like assault. And I'm sorry because I don't remember if it was provoked or not.

01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:47.460
And I don't want to make it sound like it was provoked when it wasn't. I saw this thing once like two months ago. Maybe somebody in chat can fill me in.

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:55.460
But like literally chokes a fan. And I think I have to say it's allegedly Ezra Miller because I don't know if it was ever proven it really was him.

01:15:55.460 --> 01:16:10.460
But my point with all that is like because everybody's got you know the smartphones and cameras and so forth. He's a celebrity. You can't just go around choking people when you're off the clock. Does that make sense?

01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:12.460
You can't just go around choking people anyway.

01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:16.460
Exactly, exactly. Sorry, I'm on the clock. It's okay now.

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:25.460
Sorry, you're right. I worded that horribly. I'm very sorry. No, my job is being Darth Vader. I will force choke you now. No, I shouldn't make light of it. No, don't choke people ever. That's a good thing.

01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:38.460
But you know the point I'm getting at though, right? Is that, you know, he has to represent his brand because his brand is his job and being able to land movie roles and things like that all of the time, right?

01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:44.460
Yeah, so don't choke strangers. That's that's the thing. Let's see.

01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:46.460
Bonds006 says, Darn, can't choke the fan.

01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:53.460
Oh yeah, SD100Matt says, You're mostly right, Rob. The fan was stalking him in a bar and he snapped and he choked the fan.

01:16:53.460 --> 01:17:04.460
So there's a little bit of, you know, not that choking is ever appropriate, but this is definitely one of those cases of a wrong led to a bigger wrong and it led to a big whole wrong snowball.

01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:12.460
So, you know, at the same time, you have to allow actors and actresses, you know, they're fucking people, give them their space, right?

01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:19.460
That's why I hate doing that stuff. Like I've been told like, oh, look, there's so and so over there. We should go like talk to him.

01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:27.460
And I'm like, no, let them like have your moment of hey, that's so and so and move on because you like let them live. It's so annoying.

01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:36.460
Anyway. All right. Anything else you want to say on this important topic? I'm sorry, I might have derailed things a little bit, but I did want to get the chat comments out.

01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:45.460
Fuck it. Just just be decent. Be nice. Yeah. Stop being an asshole.

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:49.460
Gaming is for everyone. Make it a space for everyone.

01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:51.460
Gaming is for everyone. Exactly.

01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:54.460
Yeah, Bobby. Teach your kids to be decent.

01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:59.460
That too. Don't be creepy. All right. Moving on.

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:07.460
Let's go to a completely different topic and talk about Nintendo and a lot of a lot of confusion about where the hell Nintendo is at right now,

01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:16.460
because Nintendo hasn't really done a direct to announce a barrage of new games outside of this random Bakugan announcement, which isn't even really their game anyway.

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:24.460
So what's Nintendo doing? What are they up to? Did this COVID situation screw them up? What's happening?

01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:32.460
So there was a shareholder meeting and in talking to investors, senior managing executive officer at Nintendo,

01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:40.460
Shinya Takahashi said that although the company as a whole is a little behind schedule due to the pandemic,

01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:47.460
game releases this fiscal year through March 2021 are currently not affected.

01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:52.460
So they're saying that games that are scheduled to come out this fiscal year are not affected.

01:18:52.460 --> 01:19:01.460
Now, here's my thing, though. I think there's a lot of word choice going on there because fiscal year goes through March 2021.

01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:08.460
So if there was a game that was going to come out in November, that maybe doesn't make it out now until March 2021.

01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:12.460
Well, they still made their fiscal year now, didn't they?

01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:17.460
So I don't think this necessarily means that everything is on and they admit to being a little bit behind.

01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:20.460
So I don't think this is necessarily saying that everything is on schedule.

01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:31.460
Now, of course, the other thing that Nintendo has kind of taught us is that the holiday season might not be what it once was in this industry.

01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:33.460
And what I mean by that is let's not forget.

01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:40.460
Nintendo launched the switch outside of the holiday period within the fiscal year. They launched it in March.

01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:48.460
So technically, Nintendo is kind of used to this where they can launch big products in January, February, March, and they'll still do very well.

01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:54.460
If the game is good, it'll sell, right? So I wouldn't worry too much.

01:19:54.460 --> 01:20:01.460
Well, I think if you are we're expecting a whole bunch of releases in October, November, they may be delayed a few months.

01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:06.460
But it sounds like we will still have some things coming by March of 2021 for sure.

01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:09.460
What that is, though, we don't know how they're going to announce those games.

01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:12.460
We don't know. Nothing has really been said on that front.

01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:20.460
So Phoenix 7726 says, I can only imagine what Black Friday is going to be like.

01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:26.460
I think everybody should prepare themselves for the possibility there may not be one like the way you were used to before.

01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:34.460
I mean, we just we don't know what the virus situation is going to look like, but there's likely not going to be a vaccine by November or treatment.

01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:38.460
So, I mean, we can cross our fingers and hope for a miracle in the treatment department.

01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:44.460
But as things, you know, hopefully COVID starts to trail off.

01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:48.460
You know, maybe by some miracle, we are able to reverse that.

01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:53.460
We convince people to wear their masks and it's it starts to trail off a little more in this country.

01:20:53.460 --> 01:21:02.460
But I imagine those huge crowds of people fighting over toasters not going to happen this year because they're just going to limit how many people go in those stores.

01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:04.460
But it's it is still too early to say.

01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:09.460
I mean, if you think about it, from March till now has been four months.

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:15.460
And how much has changed in that four months? And guess what? From July to November, that's another four months.

01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:20.460
So a lot can change. We'll see.

01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:25.460
S2100 Matt says, Prime Day was supposed to be this past week. Amazon delayed it indefinitely.

01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:29.460
Phoenix 7726 says, at least in the USA. Yeah, it's going to get canceled.

01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:32.460
I don't trust our leaders enough to knock this down by then.

01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:41.460
This is probably unfortunately true. However, don't get conceded if you're in another country.

01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:45.460
There's still going to have to be protections that happen in other countries.

01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:52.460
Like I know New Zealand's very proud of the fact that they don't really have coronavirus right now, or at least those that they do are like completely isolated.

01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:56.460
It's a very low number. They haven't had the outbreak in New Zealand nearly in the way that we've had here.

01:21:56.460 --> 01:22:01.460
Kudos to them. They've had very competent leadership in New Zealand in fighting this virus.

01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:08.460
But they can't get lazy about it, right? If they suddenly relax a lot of things, what's going to happen?

01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:12.460
It's going to invite the virus into this place that's been mostly unexposed, right?

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:27.460
So my point is, countries are going to have to continue to fight and protect against this until we have a vaccine, effective treatment, herd immunity, which seems, I mean, I know there's a lot of recent studies on that.

01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:35.460
There's a lot of conflicting stuff right now on that. Let's just say the reports on vaccines seem more promising than the reports on herd immunity. That's all I'll say with that.

01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:38.460
Well, and Sweden proved that point.

01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:40.460
Oh yeah, there was that too.

01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:46.460
And on top of that, the new studies are saying that it's possible to be reinfected and that the virus is airborne.

01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:51.460
Joy. Yeah. So, anyhow.

01:22:51.460 --> 01:23:00.460
So anyway, one other thing I want to say about the Nintendo piece though, besides just like, you know, the games possibly being pushed out till March 2021 a little bit.

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:03.460
We have to think of the holiday season running through March.

01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:13.460
They did mention that the working from home benefits have not necessarily been all negative because it was also revealed that recent surprise release of their jump rope challenge.

01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:22.460
I don't know if you've seen that on the switch, but it was like a little freebie they put out jump rope challenge was like a game jam that Nintendo did in house.

01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:29.460
Another comment from Takahashi said that the game was built with pandemic centric physical fitness in mind.

01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:39.460
So they they basically did a game jam, it sounds like about what are some ways that the switch could encourage physical fitness while being at home and jump rope challenge was the result.

01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:49.460
That's kind of rad actually so and I love this image of big game companies doing internal game jams to find the next little big product.

01:23:49.460 --> 01:24:02.460
And I'm sure Nintendo is not the only company to do it. And I just I think that's really neat. So I like that I think that's a good thing to come from this whole isolation thing not that there's really anything good about it but you, you look for the diamonds

01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:09.460
in the rough I suppose. So, all right, well moving on dark soccer What do you have for us next.

01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:12.460
You're muted dark soccer just you know on your, on your headset.

01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:18.460
Thank you. You're welcome. Well going back to other Nintendo related news.

01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:29.460
We have now had another unopened copy of Super Mario Brothers sell, not like a Mario Super Mario Brothers Duck Hunt or any of that it's a Super Mario Brothers.

01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:34.460
And this one sold for 114,000.

01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:43.460
It was one of the 1985 releases. It was put up by heritage auctions that based out of Dallas.

01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:49.460
It is the most money ever paid for a video game according to heritage.

01:24:49.460 --> 01:25:06.460
It is a particularly rare copy of Super Mario Brothers because the, it means that the box was sealed with a cardboard hanging tab underneath the plastic which is an indicator that this was produced after Nintendo started using shrink shrink wrap to seal their

01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:08.460
games rather than stickers.

01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:18.460
And so it's an excellent condition. It's the highest graded copy of the game that heritage is ever sold.

01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:36.460
The whole auction that they did brought in about 700,000, according to a heritage. They also sold a prototype of a Sega Pluto to console, which sold for 84,000, as far as I know, I think there's only two in existence.

01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:51.460
So, this particular one, the the Pluto zero to the thing about this one is it was supposed to be a Sega Saturn, that was more of a budget model that had the built in

01:25:51.460 --> 01:26:02.460
internet connectors on it. And so the thing with that is it had it been released it would have been the first home console that that was internet capable.

01:26:02.460 --> 01:26:10.460
And then one of their other big sellers was a copy of Mike Tyson's punch out for 50,400, and it was one of the first.

01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:19.460
And one of the first sealed copies of Super Mario Brothers three that was 38,400. And there are apparently less than 10 copies of that in existence.

01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:21.460
Wow.

01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:33.460
There's something if I had, if I had that money, I could I could pay off my house, well there's, there's certain elements of these that are making them collectibles and like you said with the Super Mario.

01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:42.460
It's the fact that it had the pull tab and it was sealed that way as opposed to shrink wrap, because I think that also indicated I think, and somebody in chat might have to help me fill in the gaps.

01:26:42.460 --> 01:27:00.460
But I want to say that pull tab was very unique to like the first pressing of the game. And I think some type of arrangement with Sears, that they were sold exclusively in their store like in the first pressing and I think the box itself has like a black bar in a different place or something like that

01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:22.460
But there's, there were very few of those made because the pull tab was more of a test market thing. Whereas when it went like full, because you might be sitting there at home and you have a copy of just Super Mario Brothers, because I mean, as rare as it is to find a Super Mario Brothers by itself cartridge because most people remember that packed in with Duck Hunt, right, or even the Duck Hunt world class track meet, right.

01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:29.460
But there were some Mario Brothers by itself because if you, you might recall, there was also a Rob the Robot set.

01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:43.460
And Mario, Mario Brothers wasn't packed in with that. It was Gyrumite. Once it was Gyrumite, maybe it was Breakthrough. It was one of those Rob the Robot games and I think Duck Hunt.

01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:44.460
No, Wrecking Crew.

01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:45.460
Wrecking Crew.

01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:58.460
Okay, so it was a difference. So you still had to buy Mario Brothers separately. So I mean, that card existed, but I think in the earliest, earliest version, like the test market stuff had the pull tab and that's what makes it so rare.

01:27:58.460 --> 01:28:03.460
So, and there's got to be things like Mike Tyson's Punch Out. Shit, I had that game.

01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:10.460
But there's got to be something about like a particular first pressing or a mistake or something. I mean, the fact that still shrink wraps pretty good.

01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:17.460
But you can, you can go back and re-shrink wrap games. There's got to be something about that packaging that's different.

01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:25.460
Oh, Hype Mayhem is actually saying, I got the NES that came with Gyrumite and Duck Hunt and we got Super Mario Brothers separately.

01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:34.460
And Dark Tetsuya says, I have the Super Mario Brothers Duck Hunt track meet three and one. Yeah, a little later on, then the power pad Nintendo.

01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:50.460
So there was like, there was the NES robot set and the action set and the action set was one with the Zapper and that sold way more than the robot set because the robot set was more expensive and Nintendo never really convinced people why the robot was a thing you needed.

01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:51.460
It was a gimmick.

01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:52.460
It was, yeah, it was very gimmicky.

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:58.460
So then I have to ask everyone, what color was the gun on your Nintendo?

01:28:58.460 --> 01:28:59.460
Silver.

01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:00.460
It was gray.

01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:10.460
Silver, yeah. So yes, they did. They changed the color of the gun. What, by about 87, they changed the color of the gun to that neon orange because realism.

01:29:10.460 --> 01:29:18.460
And also, and I was also going to make the joke that the action set with the gun sold better than the robot set because this is America and we love guns.

01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:19.460
So the action set.

01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:21.460
But you know what never changed color?

01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:22.460
Huh?

01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:25.460
The zillion gun that came with the Sega Master System.

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:26.460
Oh yeah.

01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:30.460
Wasn't the Rob the Robot set way more expensive too?

01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:36.460
It was. It was way more expensive and they really could, and then people didn't, people didn't want Gyromite and Duck Hunt.

01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:39.460
People wanted Mario Brothers that are Super Mario Brothers, of course.

01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:40.460
That was the game.

01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:47.460
I remember I always, I would always see like it was at our local like video rental store and I think they sold games too because I bought games from them.

01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:53.460
But they always had like behind the like display case, the Rob the Robot thing. I was like, oh man, I don't want that.

01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:57.460
But then like, of course, you know, it's like a couple hundred bucks with just that.

01:29:57.460 --> 01:30:01.460
One of my friends in high school had Rob the Robot because he was a spoiled brat.

01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:05.460
So he had that and I remember playing it at his house.

01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:09.460
So there was, you know, I did, I get to get to check that out at one point.

01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:11.460
So, all right.

01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:15.460
I just, I'm just telling it like it is, y'all. All right.

01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:19.460
Anyway, need to know that the old video is, oh, anyway, sorry.

01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:25.460
I meant to say, so the action set got replaced at some point with the power pad set, right?

01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:26.460
That was everything.

01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:29.460
And then I think after the power pad set came that new Nintendo.

01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:31.460
So they didn't even really sell sets anymore at that point.

01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:34.460
So a lot of people had that power pad set as well.

01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:44.460
But ironically, the other super expensive NES game is if you can find that track meet game, world class track meet.

01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:48.460
I mean, if you can find that when it was called stadium events, because what happened,

01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:53.460
Nintendo got that power pad by acquiring it from another company and they acquired stadium events

01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:55.460
and then repackaged it as world class track meet.

01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:59.460
But if you can find an original stadium events, that shit is very expensive.

01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:04.460
So it's kind of neat. Interesting.

01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:09.460
All right. Stadium events. Yeah, that's what I thought there in a chat.

01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:15.460
Act F says, I still remember that news story about some dudes in Brazil robbing a bank or something with Master System guns.

01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:19.460
And Bobby Black Wolf does point out with all the counterfeits, it's really hard.

01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:30.460
That's a good point. It's easy relatively through minorly sophisticated technology to just take an old cart no one wants,

01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:38.460
like gyro mite, sorry, gyro mite fans, and replace the ROM, flash an image instead of stadium, excuse me,

01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:42.460
stadium events on the ROM, put a new sticker on it.

01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:45.460
Tada. You have a counterfeit copy of stadium events.

01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:50.460
And that's unfortunately something that you can do. So it's tricky, tricky.

01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:53.460
All right. Anyway, let's move on. We got some more news to get into.

01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:57.460
We could talk about video game collecting for a long time, but we have news about a video game collectible.

01:31:57.460 --> 01:32:06.460
Right, Logie? Yes. And so this this really hits home for me because I own a full size cabinet of one of these.

01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:16.460
It's a Sega Astro City, and it's basically a bunch of it's a mini one of those like mini devices.

01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:24.460
And I mean, it looks pretty beefy. It's reminds me a lot of like the Neo Geo collectors mini that they did,

01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:26.460
but about that same size.

01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:33.460
It's got thirty six games and it's going to retail for about one hundred nineteen dollars or twelve thousand eight hundred yen.

01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:38.460
And some of the games that they've revealed are at least the first ten.

01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:44.460
Virtua Fighter, Fantasy Zone, Golden Axe, Golden Axe, The Revenge of Death Adder, Alien Storm,

01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:51.460
Alien Syndrome, Columns II, Dark Edge, Puzzle in Action, Tant R, and Altered Beasts.

01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:55.460
You know, I want it. And it's pretty cool.

01:32:55.460 --> 01:32:59.460
So aside from it having like a screen in there and everything,

01:32:59.460 --> 01:33:08.460
they also have it looks like a almost like a Genesis controller version that you can get as well.

01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:15.460
Almost looks like an old Mark three controller, but with the extra buttons.

01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:22.460
Yeah, I mean, the controller that they have on there, I mean, definitely resembles the Astro City.

01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:28.460
But the little like controller, I guess, plugs in its USB is only twenty six bucks.

01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:36.460
Yeah, it's pretty nice. I just wish my screen worked on mine because when I moved it to the garage, it stopped displaying pictures.

01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:41.460
And actually now I was looking at some parts and stuff. I'm like, I just remembered that.

01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:47.460
I wonder if I disconnected something on the power supply. So I have I have to go look at that later tonight.

01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:53.460
But it's not 100 degrees out in the garage. Do you think it's the heat that screwed up that system?

01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:57.460
No, no, no, no, no. This was in the winter when I moved everything.

01:33:57.460 --> 01:34:01.460
So I had an issue with I don't know what it is.

01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:06.460
I think it could have been because like it's a really I mean, it's got a CRT in it.

01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:09.460
That's like a 29 inch CRT. And I think it's heavy.

01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:17.460
So I think it's possible that when I moved it in there, maybe the jostling it around could have caused some problems or because it's old.

01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:24.460
I mean, it's probably a few decades old. So I mean, I don't know.

01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:31.460
It's stuff like that just eventually dies. And you might feel like, yeah, redo the capacitors on there or I may just need to replace them.

01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:35.460
I knew that someone take a look at it. But I mean, I had restored everything.

01:34:35.460 --> 01:34:43.460
I gutted the PC out of it, though, because I had Mame running it. But now I needed it for parts for my DDR machine.

01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:46.460
So I'll have to rebuild it and it'll be even better.

01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:50.460
Now, I didn't really talk about it during my gaming week, but I still love my BurgerTime one up cabinet.

01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:55.460
Although I promised I promised my husband I'm not going to get any more one up cabinets.

01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:59.460
You sure? Because I saw that. So I was looking online.

01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:03.460
I noticed that they had marked the bunch down in April to 50 bucks.

01:35:03.460 --> 01:35:09.460
And apparently there's a few of the Star Wars ones left over in Roseville for 50 bucks.

01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:14.460
Thank you, Alan. Put a smush cameo on. Sorry. Wow.

01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:19.460
It's a space thing. We need less. They also had a final fight in West.

01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:25.460
We need less in this house, not more. Here's 50 bucks, by the way.

01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:28.460
Wow. You might want to get on that. Where am I going to put that with all the pinball in my house?

01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:34.460
You'll find a place. You don't need a bed.

01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:39.460
But I did. I did say, though, like I promised Alan no more one up cabinets.

01:35:39.460 --> 01:35:44.460
However, if they announce a Tron cabinet.

01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:50.460
I'll risk divorce. I'm just kidding. That wouldn't happen, but I.

01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:57.460
Alan would have to understand and give me that one if if if they do a Tron arcade one up cabinet at some point.

01:35:57.460 --> 01:36:04.460
And now that apparently Tron three like those, I'll believe it when I see a trailer or that they're actually like there's on set photos or something.

01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:09.460
You know, like I thought it was supposed to be a remake, though, like I don't.

01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:17.460
I don't know the whole thing with Jared Leto was supposed to be a remake. And I'll be very disappointed if it is because they left it open like it was like it was a really interesting storyline.

01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:22.460
And I was like, never reboot it. Why? I'll believe it when I see footage.

01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:30.460
But until then, my hope is if they were to do a new Tron movie, they would want to like maybe release a cabinet to go with that.

01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:36.460
Although, I don't know, maybe Disney want to do their own thing, but I would love to get electronica back, Rob.

01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:45.460
I'd be so well, now that I'm going to have all this time off work saved up, that that trip to Disney World is happening when it's safe.

01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:55.460
I'm not going to be there tomorrow, but when the Tron ride opens and, you know, hopefully our world gets past covid, I will be on that ride.

01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:57.460
I'm so excited.

01:36:57.460 --> 01:37:02.460
Pretty sure Bobby Black Wolf has already said he's driving down for that, too, or I just committed him. I don't know.

01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:03.460
All right.

01:37:03.460 --> 01:37:07.460
Are they bringing the Tron ride to Disney World?

01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:11.460
Oh, yeah, the one in Shanghai. They've been building that in Disney World for about a year.

01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:16.460
It's supposed to open next year, although I don't know how the timetable gets thrown off.

01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:18.460
So it looks very cool.

01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:20.460
Yeah, for real.

01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:22.460
All right. Anyhow, moving on.

01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:24.460
Let's talk about Microsoft.

01:37:24.460 --> 01:37:31.460
And we know that Xbox and Xbox Game Studios has been growing and growing thanks to acquisitions.

01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:37.460
In fact, they were rumored recently as a possible suitor for Warner Interactive, if I'm not mistaken.

01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:39.460
Right. That was the thing that was going around.

01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:43.460
So is Microsoft going to stop the acquisition of Game Studios?

01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:46.460
And the short answer is no.

01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:53.460
And this is in an interview with GamesIndustry.biz that Phil Spencer, of course, the head of Xbox, did, saying,

01:37:53.460 --> 01:37:59.460
We acquired quite a few new studios in a short amount of time, and we want to make sure that those studios are onboarded in the right way.

01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:08.460
As the head, Matt, and I were talking about it, we just want to make sure that we treated the incoming studios as full parts of the organization they felt supported.

01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:10.460
And so on and so on.

01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:18.460
Goes on to say that the CEO of Microsoft, who is not Bill Gates, Bill Gates actually is very removed from that company at this point.

01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:24.460
But Sataya Nadella, and I probably said his name wrong, I'm sorry, but he's the CEO of Microsoft,

01:38:24.460 --> 01:38:31.460
has not really given the sign that they should slow down acquisitions of studios.

01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:34.460
So they're just going to continue to onboard studios.

01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:40.460
And Phil Spencer says that the Game Pass subscriber base portfolio continues to grow.

01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:42.460
We're launching a new console.

01:38:42.460 --> 01:38:46.460
It was our biggest year ever on PC in terms of revenue.

01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:53.460
We have really strong support from the CEO and the chief financial officer, Amy Hood.

01:38:53.460 --> 01:39:00.460
And there's been no signal at all that we should be slowing down, but just to go at a pace that is maintainable for us as a leadership team.

01:39:00.460 --> 01:39:05.460
We're always out there talking to people, but it has to be the right opportunity.

01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:13.460
And this article I'm looking at as well reminds us that they were rumored, as I just mentioned, with the whole Warner Interactive thing going on.

01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:16.460
So there may be more in the future.

01:39:16.460 --> 01:39:17.460
So we'll see.

01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:24.460
And of course, it's really only a couple of weeks now until we really get to see the fruits of what that's going to bring us.

01:39:24.460 --> 01:39:29.460
Yes, we know a few of the Xbox games from that trailer peak a couple weeks ago.

01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:38.460
But we know we're going to be getting a real meaty look at what 2020 is going to look like for Microsoft in just a couple weeks on the 23rd, right?

01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:41.460
Yeah, very shortly.

01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:44.460
I'm very excited to see what they have for there.

01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:52.460
Hopefully, the demos that they're going to be bringing are going to have PC versions as well because I don't got no Xbox.

01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:55.460
And for all we know, they may announce new acquisitions at that time.

01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:58.460
They don't necessarily have to announce it right when it happens.

01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:03.460
Look at what happened at that one E3 where they remember they had them all out on the stage.

01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:04.460
That was a really impressive E3.

01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:07.460
And they're like, we got this one and this one and this one and this one.

01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:08.460
It's like, damn.

01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:11.460
So it could be anyone.

01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:17.460
And I see in chat, DGRama S says Microsoft needs to acquire a few Japanese studios. Seriously.

01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:19.460
That would be a gag.

01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:23.460
If Microsoft acquires a Japanese studio, that is going to be huge.

01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:28.460
And I know a lot of people have their fan wank as to which studio they want to see acquired.

01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:33.460
But I think just if they were to get at all a Japanese studio, that would be a pretty big deal.

01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:41.460
So we'll see. Hype Mayhem in chat says next up, Microsoft buys Sony, Nintendo, Disney, Activision, EA, the White House.

01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:43.460
I don't really see it going that far.

01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:52.460
But I think because we have other big gaming companies out there like EA is buying a bunch of little things.

01:40:52.460 --> 01:40:55.460
Activision Blizzard buys a bunch of little things.

01:40:55.460 --> 01:41:02.460
I don't think MS is going to get accused of antitrust violations by picking up a couple other studios.

01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:05.460
It's all about kind of how they handle it, I suppose.

01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:14.460
But they have, I think, a huge way they've also been kind of avoiding that talk is that they're putting Minecraft out on the Switch and PlayStation.

01:41:14.460 --> 01:41:18.460
So that is one way I think Microsoft kind of gets around that hole.

01:41:18.460 --> 01:41:23.460
They're not allowing competition because they're actually putting games on competitors consoles.

01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:26.460
So true. Yeah.

01:41:26.460 --> 01:41:31.460
All right. We'll see what develops. It's going to be it's going to be very fascinating when we get to July.

01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:35.460
Anyway, let's let's go back to a classic time, shall we?

01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:40.460
We're going to go back, take a step in time to the classic game of the week.

01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:47.460
Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking this game out.

01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:53.460
And you should acquire some knowledge about this particular game.

01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:57.460
Dark Sakura, what have you picked for the folks for the classic game of the week?

01:41:57.460 --> 01:41:59.460
I'm on week number six, by the way.

01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:03.460
I know. But now we can't see because I brought the bump back with our makeover.

01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:06.460
We have the bumper again. All right. I'll leave it on. Yeah.

01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:13.460
Anyway, the game that I've chosen is Breath of Fire, which is another one I haven't done before.

01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:19.460
But hey, and just a little hiccup on the stream here because I forgot to load the B roll.

01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:23.460
Sorry. So it's it's blank on purpose for a reason. But here we go.

01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:25.460
I got it. I got it. There we go. There's your. All right.

01:42:25.460 --> 01:42:34.460
So so again, it's Breath of Fire, which is a role playing game developed by Capcom for the Super Famicom or Super Nintendo.

01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:38.460
And it was released in Japan, April nineteen ninety three.

01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:43.460
It could have been out for my birthday, but it came out on April 3rd.

01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:49.460
And then in the US, it was released on August 10th, 1994.

01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:57.460
So over a year later and there's been other versions of it released, but I'll get into them in a moment.

01:42:57.460 --> 01:43:01.460
So it is Capcom's first traditional role playing game.

01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:07.460
And it set the tone for future games because we have quite a few Breath of Fire games now.

01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:18.460
The character designs were done by Inafune Keiji and music was done by Capcom's in-house sound team, Alf Lila.

01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:26.460
There was a re-release, like I said, in 2001, it was released for the Game Boy Advanced with new save features and graphical enhancements.

01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:30.460
And the English version finally being released in Europe for the first time.

01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:35.460
And then it was released on the Nintendo 3DS virtual console.

01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:38.460
And now in 2019, we have a Switch version.

01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:46.460
So it is a fantasy story set in sort of a medieval time with a boy named Ryu.

01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:50.460
Ryu can transform into a dragon.

01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:53.460
He's one of the last members of this race that can transform into a dragon.

01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:58.460
And he's off looking for his sister, I guess, who is the other member of their race that can turn into a dragon.

01:43:58.460 --> 01:44:00.460
So he's not the only one.

01:44:01.460 --> 01:44:06.460
So on his quest, he finds other people who will work with him.

01:44:06.460 --> 01:44:12.460
And then he comes into conflict with the dark dragon clan, oh my god,

01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:19.460
which is an empire that wants to take over the world by bringing back a crazy goddess.

01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:22.460
And it was really well received.

01:44:22.460 --> 01:44:25.460
And of course, it had a sequel, Breath of Fire 2, in 1994.

01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:36.460
As far as the play of the game, it's basically two-dimensional sprites with a top-down perspective.

01:44:36.460 --> 01:44:41.460
And you move your character in four directions while navigating through the environments.

01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:44.460
You go from towns, dungeons, there's traps, there's monsters.

01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:51.460
And you have to do these story-based scenarios that will have you go into these areas and defeat enemies.

01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:56.460
And also interact with NPCs who are part of the plot.

01:44:56.460 --> 01:45:04.460
And so you keep bringing in different characters that have different spells as well as unique actions that they can perform.

01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:08.460
You can solve puzzles, you navigate some of the environments,

01:45:08.460 --> 01:45:15.460
but some of these people are going to bring better access to the game.

01:45:15.460 --> 01:45:19.460
And so you can have up to four members in your party at a time.

01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:26.460
And then, of course, you have your icon menus that you can let you use your stock and character information

01:45:26.460 --> 01:45:32.460
and shortcuts that let you assign unused buttons so you can access things.

01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:38.460
Kind of like when I used to do all my macros on a controller for Final Fantasy XI.

01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:45.460
And so the random encounters are every few steps.

01:45:45.460 --> 01:45:47.460
It's a turn-based system in combat.

01:45:47.460 --> 01:45:54.460
So basically you input the commands for each character and then they are carried out in order of their agility rating.

01:45:54.460 --> 01:46:02.460
And so basically you just go through the game and beat the bad guy, save the world.

01:46:02.460 --> 01:46:06.460
And I'm not going to go too much more into the story about it.

01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:10.460
But it was developed by Capcom for the SNES.

01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:13.460
The designer was Kawano Yoshinori.

01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:21.460
And the producer was Fujiwara Tokuro, who had also been the creator of the Ghost and Goblin series.

01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:29.460
So we, of course, also, like I said, Inahune did the game's characters.

01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:37.460
And, I mean, it was a pretty nice group of folks that worked on it.

01:46:37.460 --> 01:46:40.460
And then when it was localized to North America,

01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:46.460
Capcom USA didn't really have a lot of experience with text-heavy role-play games.

01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:56.460
And so it was actually Squaresoft, I think, that had gone...

01:46:56.460 --> 01:47:00.460
Yeah, Squaresoft did the US release on it.

01:47:00.460 --> 01:47:06.460
And so it was marketed as from the company that brought you Final Fantasy.

01:47:06.460 --> 01:47:10.460
So not quite great there.

01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:14.460
But Capcom took the reins back in 2001 for the Game Boy Advance port,

01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:19.460
and had this intuitive play system and redrawn character portraits,

01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:24.460
and the menu that works more like Breath of Fire 2, updated cutscene graphics.

01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:29.460
And then you could do temporary saves with a quick save feature.

01:47:29.460 --> 01:47:38.460
And Capcom had announced their English version right before E3 2001.

01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:42.460
So yeah, the game was very well received.

01:47:42.460 --> 01:47:48.460
You know, on average, it was... I'd probably say in the 80 percentile, you know.

01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:53.460
It was modestly successful in the US, but very successful in Japan.

01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:57.460
Of course, the Super Nintendo version suffered from...

01:47:57.460 --> 01:48:00.460
And this is actually a quote from Play Magazine,

01:48:00.460 --> 01:48:02.460
Flawed Execution.

01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:05.460
And so, you know, take it as you will.

01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:07.460
Take it as you will. A lot of people like Breath of Fire.

01:48:07.460 --> 01:48:10.460
I hate the US artwork for it, because it's just that general,

01:48:10.460 --> 01:48:13.460
Let's make them look western. Yeah.

01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:17.460
So, whatever. Good game.

01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:18.460
Play it.

01:48:18.460 --> 01:48:20.460
So, can I confess something?

01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:21.460
Do it.

01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:23.460
I've never played it.

01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:25.460
You want me to confess something else too?

01:48:25.460 --> 01:48:26.460
What?

01:48:26.460 --> 01:48:27.460
Neither have I.

01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:29.460
Really? You picked it as your classic game?

01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:32.460
I did, because it deserves to be a classic game.

01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:34.460
I know a lot of people who love it.

01:48:34.460 --> 01:48:36.460
Dan is a fan of it.

01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:39.460
Our chat room is really lighting up too.

01:48:39.460 --> 01:48:41.460
So, they approve. Yeah.

01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:46.460
And so, you know, for that, just because I haven't personally played something,

01:48:46.460 --> 01:48:50.460
it doesn't mean that it's not a good game.

01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:52.460
You know, it's not worthy of being mentioned.

01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:56.460
You know, some of the games I've done... Halo. Halo.

01:48:56.460 --> 01:48:58.460
Rob.

01:48:58.460 --> 01:48:59.460
I had to.

01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:01.460
You left me no choice.

01:49:01.460 --> 01:49:03.460
I left myself out for that one.

01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:05.460
Okay?

01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:10.460
Thanks to doing Halo, my mother could live in her house for another month.

01:49:10.460 --> 01:49:12.460
I know. I know. We're very thankful to everybody.

01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:13.460
Thank you, everybody.

01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:17.460
I'm going back to the cameras by turning off the gameplay footage.

01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:19.460
So, this is my DragonCon wig.

01:49:19.460 --> 01:49:21.460
It needs some love.

01:49:21.460 --> 01:49:24.460
She hasn't been worn in like a year, because...

01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:26.460
But I love this wig.

01:49:26.460 --> 01:49:28.460
It looks like... I think the color looks great on me.

01:49:28.460 --> 01:49:31.460
And yes, and I am aware, actually, of what Bobby's saying in chat,

01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:33.460
is that it's on Super Nintendo Online on Switch.

01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:35.460
Yeah, at least I knew the first one was there.

01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:37.460
I didn't realize both one and two were there.

01:49:37.460 --> 01:49:41.460
So, yeah, maybe I will have to do like a playthrough at some point.

01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:43.460
Maybe, Darsakha, you might have to join me.

01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:47.460
Maybe we could do a virtual, like, playthrough together.

01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:49.460
The thing is, is that I think that...

01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:52.460
I don't remember if the first ones were, but I know later ones are RTS,

01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:54.460
and I hate RTS games.

01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:58.460
Oh, no, this one definitely doesn't look like it,

01:49:58.460 --> 01:50:01.460
just from the gameplay footage that was rolling in the background, so, yeah.

01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:06.460
But, I mean, maybe, but, I mean, right now, I'm still...

01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:09.460
Yeah, they're both... Okay, they're turn-based good.

01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:13.460
It's just the later ones are RTS, and I hate RTS games.

01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:16.460
I am Dale in chat. I hope I said that name right.

01:50:16.460 --> 01:50:19.460
I'm sorry, it's in a dark blue that's really hard to read. Sorry.

01:50:19.460 --> 01:50:22.460
I'm not going to spoil it, but for a classic game, the story was great.

01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:24.460
Play both games. It's great. Oh, yeah.

01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:27.460
And, you know, just as DarkSakura said, and I totally agree with,

01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:29.460
just because we don't get around to playing certain games

01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:31.460
doesn't mean they're not good.

01:50:31.460 --> 01:50:33.460
Sports games are a great example.

01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:36.460
Like, I think between the three of us, including Loki,

01:50:36.460 --> 01:50:38.460
there's very few sports games that we play.

01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:41.460
Not to say we don't play any sports games.

01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:43.460
I fucking love Tecmo Bowl back in the day,

01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:45.460
and I still like NBA Jam is a lot of fun.

01:50:45.460 --> 01:50:47.460
You know, I like the arcade...

01:50:47.460 --> 01:50:49.460
Hey, you know what mine was? Super high impact.

01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:51.460
Yeah, super high impact, right?

01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:56.460
But when it comes to Madden 2019, not so much.

01:50:56.460 --> 01:50:59.460
We don't really play those games. They're not bad games.

01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:01.460
They're just not the games we play, and that's okay.

01:51:01.460 --> 01:51:03.460
It's like music, right?

01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:06.460
I don't know shit about country western music.

01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:08.460
Well, unless it's Reba McEntire.

01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:12.460
But, you know, that doesn't mean it's necessarily all bad.

01:51:12.460 --> 01:51:17.460
Oh, my exes live in Texas.

01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:19.460
I mean, there is a lot of bad country.

01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:21.460
You know what? There's a lot of bad pop music, too.

01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:25.460
And I like pop music, and there's a lot of bad pop music, so it's fine.

01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:29.460
I grew up spending my summers in Dothan, Alabama.

01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:37.460
I listen to a lot of country, but it's what introduced me to the original version of Black Velvet,

01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:39.460
which I love to this day.

01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:43.460
Nice. Alright. Anyway, your classic game of the week, Breath of Fire.

01:51:43.460 --> 01:51:45.460
Yay!

01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:48.460
How we got from Breath of Fire to country music, only OLR knows.

01:51:48.460 --> 01:51:51.460
Alright, we're going to do some rapid fire news.

01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:55.460
And nice thing, usually we'd be saying goodbye to Jamie about now,

01:51:55.460 --> 01:51:59.460
but Jamie's actually going to be with us all night long, changing out weeks.

01:51:59.460 --> 01:52:01.460
I did a thing. I did a thing.

01:52:01.460 --> 01:52:07.460
I got tomorrow off because I have a doctor's appointment that actually may have been canceled, so I don't know.

01:52:07.460 --> 01:52:09.460
So, yeah.

01:52:09.460 --> 01:52:13.460
And I'm still, I'm going to keep this wig on for a while. I love this one.

01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:14.460
Yeah, that's a good wig.

01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:16.460
She's good. She's good.

01:52:16.460 --> 01:52:22.460
I wish, I wish, I hope somebody's been taking screenshots throughout the show so we can have a Twitter poll later to rate Jamie's wigs.

01:52:22.460 --> 01:52:24.460
Alright, anyway.

01:52:24.460 --> 01:52:26.460
Maybe I'll put some selfies up there.

01:52:26.460 --> 01:52:28.460
That's a good idea. Alright, moving on.

01:52:28.460 --> 01:52:33.460
We have some rapid fire news, so let's talk about some other news that's happening in the industry.

01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:35.460
Quickly-ish.

01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:41.460
I say quickly, but it's OLR. Sometimes the segment goes on longer than the other news stories. It's whatever.

01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:43.460
Loki, why don't you start us off?

01:52:43.460 --> 01:52:48.460
Alright, so we've got a few new games coming to the Nintendo Switch Online Collection.

01:52:48.460 --> 01:52:55.460
So, for Super Nintendo, we're going to be getting Donkey Kong Country and Natsume Championship Wrestling.

01:52:55.460 --> 01:52:59.460
And then, on the NES, we're getting The Immortal.

01:52:59.460 --> 01:53:02.460
I have not played The Immortal.

01:53:02.460 --> 01:53:03.460
The other two I've played, though.

01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:07.460
Isn't that based on a movie or a comic, The Immortal? I feel like it is.

01:53:07.460 --> 01:53:12.460
Uh, it looks like it could be.

01:53:12.460 --> 01:53:15.460
It's Will Harvey Presents The Immortal.

01:53:15.460 --> 01:53:17.460
I don't know.

01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:21.460
I've seen a little bit of that game before.

01:53:21.460 --> 01:53:26.460
I don't think I ever really played a lot of it, but I'll check it out on Switch Online. Of course I will. Why not?

01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:28.460
Yep.

01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:35.460
And then, we've got Halo 3 coming to PC on the 14th.

01:53:35.460 --> 01:53:40.460
So, it's going to be a part of the Master Chief Collection.

01:53:40.460 --> 01:53:42.460
So, pretty neat.

01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:46.460
I like how they've been adding to that collection piece by piece on PC.

01:53:46.460 --> 01:53:49.460
It's been very interesting because I've played it there.

01:53:49.460 --> 01:53:51.460
So, it's interesting.

01:53:51.460 --> 01:53:54.460
Yeah. So, pretty cool.

01:53:54.460 --> 01:54:02.460
Alright. Limited Run Games is going to be doing a physical edition of the Castlevania Anniversary Collection.

01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:07.460
Now, many of you probably already own this collection because it's been out digitally for a little bit.

01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:10.460
But, you know, for the collectors, that's what Limited Run Games is for.

01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:21.460
And they announced on their own little streaming event they did earlier this week is that they are going to be putting out this collection of Konami Castlevania games for the Nintendo Switch and the PlayStation 4.

01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:28.460
Castlevania Collection was originally released in May 2019, but this is going to be a limited physical edition, which is neat.

01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:33.460
You know, I mean, probably not for me, but I love that it's a thing that they do.

01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:40.460
Speaking of Limited Run Games, they announced, what, like 30 different physical editions that they're doing.

01:54:40.460 --> 01:54:42.460
So, it's not just this.

01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:45.460
They're going to be doing Samurai Jack from Adult Swim Games.

01:54:45.460 --> 01:54:47.460
They're going to be doing Towerfall Ascension.

01:54:47.460 --> 01:54:49.460
To the Moon, that's a big one.

01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:54.460
Space Channel 5 VR is getting a Limited Run Games edition, the PSVR game.

01:54:54.460 --> 01:54:57.460
The Grandia HD Collection for Switch.

01:54:57.460 --> 01:54:59.460
Bloodstained Curse of the Moon 2.

01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:05.460
So, I mean, I know Dark Sakura, you and Dan are trying to do less stuff, but it's just a video game.

01:55:07.460 --> 01:55:09.460
Yeah, but we already have the game. We already bought it.

01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:10.460
True, true.

01:55:10.460 --> 01:55:16.460
I think the most fascinating one on the entire list, Papers, Please.

01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:20.460
But the reason why it's fascinating, it's a Vita physical release.

01:55:20.460 --> 01:55:22.460
Yes, they're putting out Papers, Please.

01:55:22.460 --> 01:55:24.460
I think that's fucking rad.

01:55:24.460 --> 01:55:27.460
Garu Mark of the Wolves, the PlayStation 4 ported that.

01:55:27.460 --> 01:55:28.460
Oh, yeah.

01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:29.460
Pretty cool, right?

01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:31.460
Super Meat Boy Forever.

01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:34.460
A Boy and His Blob, the PlayStation 4 redo.

01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:37.460
Shantae, Shantae's Risky Revenge, and Extreme Sports.

01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:40.460
So, there's a lot of stuff that Limited Run Games is doing.

01:55:40.460 --> 01:55:43.460
That must mean that their physical editions do very well.

01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:45.460
Well, not necessarily.

01:55:45.460 --> 01:55:47.460
Very is a relative term, right?

01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:50.460
Well enough for them to keep going with more.

01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:52.460
So, neat.

01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:53.460
All right.

01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:54.460
Anyhow, moving on.

01:55:54.460 --> 01:55:57.460
One of the games I mentioned there was Shantae.

01:55:57.460 --> 01:56:02.460
And yes, the classic Shantae titles are coming to Nintendo Switch in the fall.

01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:05.460
Some of the earliest Shantae games, actually.

01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:09.460
The very first game, which I think Dark Soccer did as a game of the week, sometime this year.

01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:10.460
I don't think it was that long ago.

01:56:10.460 --> 01:56:12.460
I'm pretty sure that I did.

01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:15.460
Yeah, it was originally released for the Game Boy Color in 2002.

01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:19.460
It is going to be released on the eShop at some point this fall.

01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:24.460
Don't know when, but it does also tie into Limited Run Games is also going to be putting that out.

01:56:24.460 --> 01:56:25.460
That's really cool.

01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:28.460
They will also, this is a trip.

01:56:28.460 --> 01:56:31.460
It's not only are they going to be doing the Switch version of the game.

01:56:31.460 --> 01:56:37.460
They are going to facilitate a new run of cartridges for the Game Boy Color.

01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:40.460
So if you want to get a legit, legit Shantae.

01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:44.460
Well, I mean, it is a repressing, but you know, still, that's pretty cool.

01:56:44.460 --> 01:56:50.460
And they are saying it's because, you know, Shantae's kind of built up a following that it didn't have when it originally came out.

01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:55.460
Shantae's Risky Revenge, also coming to Nintendo Switch and Xbox One.

01:56:55.460 --> 01:56:58.460
That originally was a DSi title, but they will be doing that.

01:56:58.460 --> 01:57:00.460
And again, Limited Run involved with that.

01:57:00.460 --> 01:57:03.460
So Shantae fans have a lot to be happy about.

01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:06.460
Insert the mandatory Shantae, you stay joke.

01:57:06.460 --> 01:57:10.460
All right, what do we have from Dark Soccer?

01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:13.460
We have some other stuff.

01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:17.460
Bloodstained, Cursed of the Moon 2, which is fun.

01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:28.460
Is getting version 1.2.0 released on the 16th that has, July 16th that is, as boss rush mode and some bug fixes.

01:57:28.460 --> 01:57:30.460
Just keep your eyes open for it.

01:57:30.460 --> 01:57:39.460
And then the director and writer for the Ace Attorney series, Yamazaki Takeshi, has left Capcom.

01:57:39.460 --> 01:57:44.460
He was with the company for 15 years.

01:57:44.460 --> 01:57:50.460
And he's quoted as saying, although leaving a company is always painful, I like to think of this as graduating.

01:57:50.460 --> 01:57:55.460
I'm truly glad I was able to make games and meet the Ace Attorney series at Capcom.

01:57:55.460 --> 01:57:59.460
And he's going to keep working in game development, looking for other challenges.

01:57:59.460 --> 01:58:02.460
Best of luck to him.

01:58:02.460 --> 01:58:07.460
Maybe we'll get some type of new series that has similarities to Ace Attorney.

01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:08.460
Yet different.

01:58:08.460 --> 01:58:09.460
All right.

01:58:09.460 --> 01:58:10.460
Yet different.

01:58:10.460 --> 01:58:16.460
Well, let's travel around the world and check out some games coming out a little sooner than that as we do some world release dates.

01:58:16.460 --> 01:58:19.460
And why don't we start in the US with Loki?

01:58:19.460 --> 01:58:24.460
So this week we've got Death Stranding coming out on PC.

01:58:24.460 --> 01:58:28.460
Rocket Arena on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:58:28.460 --> 01:58:33.460
Story of Seasons, Friends of Mineral Town on PC and Nintendo Switch.

01:58:33.460 --> 01:58:39.460
We've got Dragon Quest Tacked on iOS and Android.

01:58:39.460 --> 01:58:45.460
Superhot Mind Control Delete on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:58:45.460 --> 01:58:52.460
And by the way, if you own a copy of the original Superhot on any of those platforms and not necessarily from, I think, one of the free services.

01:58:52.460 --> 01:58:55.460
Probably Humble if you did get that.

01:58:55.460 --> 01:58:57.460
You get this for free.

01:58:57.460 --> 01:58:58.460
So that's pretty cool.

01:58:58.460 --> 01:59:00.460
So check your library.

01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:03.460
Ghosts of Tsushima on PlayStation 4.

01:59:03.460 --> 01:59:06.460
Death Come True on PC.

01:59:06.460 --> 01:59:12.460
And last but not least, Paper Mario, the Origami King on Nintendo Switch.

01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:15.460
I think there's a couple of people looking forward to that. That's for sure.

01:59:15.460 --> 01:59:17.460
I am looking forward to that.

01:59:17.460 --> 01:59:22.460
So assuming I can pry that switch away from my kids and my wife.

01:59:22.460 --> 01:59:23.460
I might check it out.

01:59:23.460 --> 01:59:28.460
It's hard to tear myself away from Animal Crossing, which I know I didn't talk a lot about my gaming week.

01:59:28.460 --> 01:59:32.460
But I'm kind of I'm back on Animal Crossing because I actually I kind of enjoy the diving thing.

01:59:32.460 --> 01:59:34.460
I kind of like breathe a little new life.

01:59:34.460 --> 01:59:36.460
But I don't have the same concerns Star Soccer had.

01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:38.460
Like, I don't have enough people.

01:59:38.460 --> 01:59:41.460
I don't have enough people that want to come visit to worry about my island is kind of a dump anyway.

01:59:41.460 --> 01:59:44.460
And like, you can't make the dump look worse.

01:59:44.460 --> 01:59:46.460
So I'm not worried about it.

01:59:46.460 --> 01:59:48.460
But I think you cover your beach and stingweed.

01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:51.460
Yeah, I've been enjoying I've been enjoying the diving mechanic.

01:59:51.460 --> 01:59:53.460
It's fun. I like collecting the wetsuits, too.

01:59:53.460 --> 01:59:55.460
All right. By the way, Rob.

01:59:55.460 --> 01:59:57.460
I got I have a Pascal card.

01:59:57.460 --> 01:59:59.460
And if you want a poster, I'll send you a poster.

01:59:59.460 --> 02:00:01.460
I think you have sent me one.

02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:03.460
You've been very good about the Pascal card.

02:00:03.460 --> 02:00:05.460
Oh, OK.

02:00:05.460 --> 02:00:08.460
I don't think I got a Katie card to sell some new Katie poster.

02:00:08.460 --> 02:00:09.460
That's fun. All right.

02:00:09.460 --> 02:00:11.460
Nice if she comes back in the game anyway.

02:00:11.460 --> 02:00:14.460
Let's talk about Nintendo Switch releases coming out in Japan.

02:00:14.460 --> 02:00:20.460
So in Japan, we have together the battle cats comes out in Japan this week.

02:00:20.460 --> 02:00:24.460
And I'm curious if that means finally we're getting our laser cat stream game.

02:00:24.460 --> 02:00:26.460
But I don't think this is actually that.

02:00:26.460 --> 02:00:30.460
But it does say this game features over three hundred and fifty creepy,

02:00:30.460 --> 02:00:32.460
cute cat characters.

02:00:32.460 --> 02:00:36.460
You train and strengthen your cats through gacha games,

02:00:36.460 --> 02:00:38.460
cat coins, tickets.

02:00:38.460 --> 02:00:40.460
Yeah. All right.

02:00:40.460 --> 02:00:45.460
Also coming out on the switch, Code Realize Shirogane no Kisuke comes out this week,

02:00:45.460 --> 02:00:49.460
as well as a game called Indivisible is out this week in Japan.

02:00:49.460 --> 02:00:51.460
I think that's coming out other places, too.

02:00:51.460 --> 02:00:54.460
So that's the releases for the Nintendo Switch.

02:00:54.460 --> 02:01:00.460
Looking at the PlayStation 4, we have Indivisible is also out on PlayStation 4.

02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:06.460
And then Ghosts of Tsushima is also out this week on the same day as it is in the U.S.

02:01:06.460 --> 02:01:07.460
The 17th.

02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:09.460
And those are your big releases in Japan this week.

02:01:09.460 --> 02:01:11.460
How about Europe, Dark Sakura?

02:01:11.460 --> 02:01:13.460
There's a few.

02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:21.460
On July 13th, we have Rocket Arena, also the PC version of Death Stranding.

02:01:21.460 --> 02:01:25.460
On the 16th, we have Paper Mario, the Origami King,

02:01:25.460 --> 02:01:28.460
Warhammer 40,000, Mechanicus.

02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:35.460
And also on the 16th, Ghosts of Tsushima, which I really am interested in.

02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:37.460
But backlog.

02:01:39.460 --> 02:01:41.460
The struggle.

02:01:41.460 --> 02:01:43.460
All right.

02:01:43.460 --> 02:01:45.460
Every week we read the mail bag.

02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:47.460
I don't know if Dark Sakura remembers how to do it.

02:01:47.460 --> 02:01:49.460
It's been so long.

02:01:49.460 --> 02:01:52.460
I can read and we have one.

02:01:52.460 --> 02:01:57.460
I know you know how to read, but I'm like, do you remember the password to the mail bag?

02:01:57.460 --> 02:01:59.460
I don't have to. I have autofill.

02:01:59.460 --> 02:02:01.460
Oh, OK. All right.

02:02:01.460 --> 02:02:08.460
Well, if as a reminder, if you need the password to the mail bag, it's Loki is a butt.

02:02:08.460 --> 02:02:10.460
That's the password. OK. All right.

02:02:10.460 --> 02:02:15.460
Anyway, participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place where you can send your emails every week.

02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:18.460
And it sounds like Dark Sakura has one to read for us tonight.

02:02:18.460 --> 02:02:20.460
I do.

02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:25.460
And I think you might have hit your button trying to do it.

02:02:25.460 --> 02:02:26.460
Yeah. Yeah.

02:02:26.460 --> 02:02:30.460
So I have funny hype mayhem.

02:02:30.460 --> 02:02:32.460
The password is one, two, three, four, five.

02:02:32.460 --> 02:02:33.460
The same as my luggage.

02:02:33.460 --> 02:02:34.460
Yay, Spaceballs.

02:02:34.460 --> 02:02:40.460
By the way, off topic, I saw Spaceballs, the mask, and I'm probably going to get it.

02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:42.460
OK. Anyway, that's a good one.

02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:44.460
I'd get that, too.

02:02:44.460 --> 02:02:46.460
Hello, LR.

02:02:46.460 --> 02:02:48.460
OK, I have to find it again.

02:02:48.460 --> 02:02:52.460
One of the calmer parts of last week's episode was a debate about the price of next gen games

02:02:52.460 --> 02:02:58.460
and whether AAA games have any right to move up to seventy dollars from their previous MSRP of 60.

02:02:58.460 --> 02:02:59.460
Hold on. Hold on.

02:02:59.460 --> 02:03:03.460
Did the emailer say one of the calmer parts of the last episode?

02:03:03.460 --> 02:03:05.460
Is that what it said?

02:03:05.460 --> 02:03:07.460
Mm hmm.

02:03:07.460 --> 02:03:12.460
I think that's a commentary on our last episode, Loki.

02:03:12.460 --> 02:03:17.460
This is what happens when I'm not here to babysit you.

02:03:17.460 --> 02:03:19.460
All right. No, I.

02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:25.460
I don't know if you know about my my friend online that passed away and covid was suspected, but I,

02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:31.460
I really got angry about all that stuff last week, and I know you're angry, too, because you're dealing with it, too.

02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:34.460
So anyway. Anyway. Sorry. Go ahead.

02:03:34.460 --> 02:03:41.460
It's just it's just hard for me to think of my mother there by herself, uninsured because of anyway.

02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:44.460
Before I make a point, let's get one thing out of the way.

02:03:44.460 --> 02:03:49.460
Buyable virtual currency loot boxes and gotcha mechanics are in full price.

02:03:49.460 --> 02:03:58.460
AAA games are absolute and total bullshit. Either get rid of that garbage or make that component of a free of a game free to play.

02:03:58.460 --> 02:04:06.460
That nonsense aside, full price AAA games went up from fifty dollars to sixty dollars with the launch of the Xbox 360 all the way back in 2005.

02:04:06.460 --> 02:04:09.460
Well, in 2005, you could still get a candy bar for a dollar.

02:04:09.460 --> 02:04:12.460
Since then, the cost of everything has gone way up.

02:04:12.460 --> 02:04:18.460
The impact of inflation has been so significant that in order to match the overall purchasing power of sixty U.S.

02:04:18.460 --> 02:04:22.460
dollars back in 2005, you would need about 80 U.S. dollars today.

02:04:22.460 --> 02:04:29.460
So the price of games today is actually decreased significantly since 2005, even more so if you consider the fact that these days,

02:04:29.460 --> 02:04:34.460
almost every non Nintendo game starts getting discounted mere weeks after its release.

02:04:34.460 --> 02:04:37.460
Hell, you can get Anthem for five dollars right now.

02:04:37.460 --> 02:04:45.460
If an increase to seventy dollars means that there's a greater chance we will be able to continue purchasing big budget story driven AAA games,

02:04:45.460 --> 02:04:47.460
then I am honestly all for it.

02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:53.460
I'd rather pay a little more to have games on day one than see everything turn into a gotcha loot box game as a service.

02:04:53.460 --> 02:04:55.460
What do you folks think?

02:04:55.460 --> 02:04:58.460
And that really that echoes a lot of what I said last week.

02:04:58.460 --> 02:05:01.460
So, yeah.

02:05:01.460 --> 02:05:05.460
Well, yeah, I.

02:05:05.460 --> 02:05:13.460
I don't mind paying for things that are worth it, so they're still going to do it, even if they charge 80 or 90 dollars for the game,

02:05:13.460 --> 02:05:16.460
they're still going to have all those because they can get money from you both ways.

02:05:16.460 --> 02:05:19.460
Why not? They're going to do it.

02:05:19.460 --> 02:05:27.460
See, that's the thing is, like, even though you're saying that games would have been equivalently the same amount or less money now than they were back

02:05:27.460 --> 02:05:34.460
when the Xbox 360 launch, we didn't have like a ton of DLC coming out for these titles.

02:05:34.460 --> 02:05:40.460
They weren't pushing that stuff like they were at the beginning of that generation as they are now.

02:05:40.460 --> 02:05:45.460
Like, I mean, hell, back in that generation, the very beginning, you still had cheat codes in games.

02:05:45.460 --> 02:05:49.460
Nowadays, you have to buy that as DLC.

02:05:49.460 --> 02:05:55.460
It's slowly been piecemealing, you know, stuff from the games, adding it to the cost.

02:05:55.460 --> 02:05:59.460
Yeah, your initial buying costs may be slightly cheaper if you account for inflation,

02:05:59.460 --> 02:06:06.460
but then you have all the other additional stuff on top of that in order to get the same experience you would have gotten back when that console originally launched.

02:06:06.460 --> 02:06:11.460
I think, though, and this kind of briefly came up here in the email and so forth,

02:06:11.460 --> 02:06:17.460
is that the games industry in some ways is almost kind of like policing their own prices.

02:06:17.460 --> 02:06:22.460
And we talked about that a little bit last week's show is that, you know, video games can be like 10 bucks, you know,

02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:28.460
or they can be even cheaper than that on places like itch.io and other independent sites online, Steam and so forth, you know.

02:06:28.460 --> 02:06:31.460
But there's a lot of video games out there that are 10, 20 bucks.

02:06:31.460 --> 02:06:35.460
Heck, I just recommended a game at the top of the show that I think is more in the $20 price category.

02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:38.460
So there's all these different games of all these different price ranges.

02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:43.460
And what I mean by policing itself is, in the email I brought up, you could get Anthem now for five bucks,

02:06:43.460 --> 02:06:47.460
because pretty quickly word got out that this game ain't worth 60 bucks.

02:06:47.460 --> 02:06:53.460
And they're having a hard time getting people to pay five bucks for it, which is kind of sad for all those, you know,

02:06:53.460 --> 02:06:56.460
developers and people to spend a lot of time making the game.

02:06:56.460 --> 02:07:03.460
But at the same time, they kind of had to come in the high level executive decisions to change some of those things.

02:07:03.460 --> 02:07:09.460
And, you know, the fact that we all knew Anthem would end up being a games as a service type of thing,

02:07:09.460 --> 02:07:12.460
and they tried to charge the full price and have all these other things going on.

02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:18.460
So I kind of feel like when word gets out and it can impact the sales of games.

02:07:18.460 --> 02:07:22.460
And so the price of the game ends up having to like change itself.

02:07:22.460 --> 02:07:29.460
Whereas there's other games, a lot of Nintendo titles that still charge full price to this day,

02:07:29.460 --> 02:07:31.460
and people pay it because they're worth it.

02:07:31.460 --> 02:07:35.460
Has Zelda Breath of the Wild ever gone on sale?

02:07:35.460 --> 02:07:41.460
Maybe for like Black Friday or a holiday sale, but outside of that, probably not.

02:07:41.460 --> 02:07:47.460
It has because I purchased it on sale, so I know it has.

02:07:47.460 --> 02:07:50.460
But certainly you get the point I'm making, though.

02:07:50.460 --> 02:07:53.460
Like, it's rare, it's few and far between.

02:07:53.460 --> 02:07:58.460
They could still charge 60 bucks for that game and probably get it.

02:07:58.460 --> 02:07:59.460
Yeah.

02:07:59.460 --> 02:08:00.460
All right.

02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:03.460
Anyhow, and as Joe 100 Matt says, it's dropped to maybe 40.

02:08:03.460 --> 02:08:04.460
Yes, you can. Sorry.

02:08:04.460 --> 02:08:05.460
Okay.

02:08:05.460 --> 02:08:09.460
Also, I must say, as much as I enjoyed the classic game of the week last episode,

02:08:09.460 --> 02:08:10.460
I was a bit disappointed.

02:08:10.460 --> 02:08:14.460
It was included in Namco Museum Archives Volume 2, you said.

02:08:14.460 --> 02:08:16.460
It was a game not developed by Namco, you said.

02:08:16.460 --> 02:08:19.460
But sadly, it was not my favorite game from that collection

02:08:19.460 --> 02:08:23.460
and the reason I thought nothing of dropping $20 on it day one.

02:08:23.460 --> 02:08:25.460
Game Freak's phenomenal Mendel Palace.

02:08:25.460 --> 02:08:30.460
Actually, I decided years ago that if for some reason I was ever in studio

02:08:30.460 --> 02:08:33.460
and asked to pick a classic game of the week, it would be that one.

02:08:33.460 --> 02:08:35.460
And here we were so close.

02:08:35.460 --> 02:08:38.460
Rob, if you decide to buy Volume 2 in the future,

02:08:38.460 --> 02:08:40.460
I highly recommend that you check it out.

02:08:40.460 --> 02:08:43.460
It's one of my favorite arcade-style games of all time.

02:08:43.460 --> 02:08:44.460
Have a great week, everybody.

02:08:44.460 --> 02:08:45.460
Aaron, YYR.

02:08:45.460 --> 02:08:50.460
So just so you know, Dark Sakura, last week when you weren't going to be here,

02:08:50.460 --> 02:08:53.460
I switched out the classic game real quick and I did Legacy of the Wizard

02:08:53.460 --> 02:08:56.460
because it had come up in that Namco collection discussion

02:08:56.460 --> 02:08:59.460
and I owned that game when I was a kid, so I was talking about that.

02:08:59.460 --> 02:09:03.460
So I think YYR is a little disappointed because, as he says,

02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:07.460
also in that collection is Mendel Palace, but I didn't own that game as a kid.

02:09:07.460 --> 02:09:09.460
I'm not as familiar with that game.

02:09:09.460 --> 02:09:13.460
I can't talk off the cusp on that game as well, but who knows?

02:09:13.460 --> 02:09:15.460
You never know what might happen in the future.

02:09:15.460 --> 02:09:17.460
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

02:09:17.460 --> 02:09:18.460
Maybe.

02:09:18.460 --> 02:09:19.460
All right.

02:09:19.460 --> 02:09:20.460
Was that it?

02:09:20.460 --> 02:09:22.460
Now I'm going to do E.T.

02:09:22.460 --> 02:09:23.460
Yeah, that was it.

02:09:23.460 --> 02:09:26.460
I thought I saw one come in right at showtime.

02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:30.460
When I just hit delete on the email, it was empty.

02:09:30.460 --> 02:09:32.460
That was the one that came in.

02:09:32.460 --> 02:09:33.460
Okay, that's weird.

02:09:33.460 --> 02:09:35.460
Because somebody doesn't clean out the email box.

02:09:35.460 --> 02:09:36.460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:09:36.460 --> 02:09:37.460
All right.

02:09:37.460 --> 02:09:39.460
If we did accidentally miss anyone, we'll get to it.

02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:42.460
Because the thing I saw had an attachment anyway

02:09:42.460 --> 02:09:45.460
that's going to need to be looked at this week, so we'll come back to it.

02:09:45.460 --> 02:09:48.460
So not ignoring anyone on purpose, I promise.

02:09:48.460 --> 02:09:49.460
All right.

02:09:49.460 --> 02:09:50.460
You'll have to check the trash then.

02:09:50.460 --> 02:09:53.460
Yeah, I'll check the trash because we might have just accidentally missed it.

02:09:53.460 --> 02:09:57.460
But I think there is one because I just noticed it right at 6 o'clock.

02:09:57.460 --> 02:09:58.460
So anyway.

02:09:58.460 --> 02:09:59.460
We'll take a look.

02:09:59.460 --> 02:10:01.460
Yeah, it's no biggie.

02:10:01.460 --> 02:10:05.460
If you read it, you'll be like, oh, there's something in it that Rob needs time to look at.

02:10:05.460 --> 02:10:07.460
And I didn't have time before the show.

02:10:07.460 --> 02:10:08.460
All right.

02:10:08.460 --> 02:10:10.460
So if we kick it to next week, it's not a big deal.

02:10:10.460 --> 02:10:11.460
All right.

02:10:11.460 --> 02:10:12.460
Moving on.

02:10:12.460 --> 02:10:14.460
Let's get to some more gaming news.

02:10:14.460 --> 02:10:16.460
In the meantime, you can email us.

02:10:16.460 --> 02:10:19.460
Actually, I found an email that I didn't read, actually.

02:10:19.460 --> 02:10:21.460
Okay, do you want to read it?

02:10:21.460 --> 02:10:22.460
I think it's the one I'm thinking of.

02:10:22.460 --> 02:10:23.460
Yeah, go for it.

02:10:23.460 --> 02:10:24.460
I don't see any attachments on it.

02:10:24.460 --> 02:10:29.460
Hey, OLR, not sure if this will be on your showroom this week.

02:10:29.460 --> 02:10:32.460
But yeah, it does have a link to it.

02:10:32.460 --> 02:10:34.460
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

02:10:34.460 --> 02:10:35.460
That's all right.

02:10:35.460 --> 02:10:36.460
You read it.

02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:37.460
It's fine.

02:10:37.460 --> 02:10:38.460
All right.

02:10:38.460 --> 02:10:39.460
But this week was the GMTK Game Jam.

02:10:39.460 --> 02:10:44.460
It was started by the guy behind the Game Makers Toolkit YouTube channel and is now

02:10:44.460 --> 02:10:46.460
almost as big as Ludlam Dare.

02:10:46.460 --> 02:10:51.460
This year, 70,000 people registered and over 5,000 games were submitted at the end of the

02:10:51.460 --> 02:10:52.460
weekend.

02:10:52.460 --> 02:10:55.460
I joined it almost this close.

02:10:55.460 --> 02:10:57.460
One of them is mine.

02:10:57.460 --> 02:10:58.460
It's called Momentum.

02:10:58.460 --> 02:11:00.460
It's a platform game similar to Celeste.

02:11:00.460 --> 02:11:03.460
Put out a link, which we'll check it out first.

02:11:03.460 --> 02:11:06.460
And if you want to share it, then that's fine.

02:11:06.460 --> 02:11:08.460
Anyone wants to look in.

02:11:08.460 --> 02:11:13.460
So this is my first proper game jam, and it was a stressful 48 hours, especially when

02:11:13.460 --> 02:11:16.460
I decided to ditch my first idea halfway through.

02:11:16.460 --> 02:11:18.460
I'm super proud of the game I built, though.

02:11:18.460 --> 02:11:23.460
Plus, it was nice to have a lockdown weekend where I didn't lie around doing nothing for

02:11:23.460 --> 02:11:24.460
once.

02:11:24.460 --> 02:11:26.460
I hope you're all doing well.

02:11:26.460 --> 02:11:30.460
OLR continues to be my port in this very stormy year, Elliot B.

02:11:30.460 --> 02:11:32.460
Well, thank you for that.

02:11:32.460 --> 02:11:36.460
And congratulations on actually completing a game, unlike someone else on this panel

02:11:36.460 --> 02:11:38.460
whose shower name is Aimless.

02:11:38.460 --> 02:11:40.460
Someone missed this opportunity.

02:11:40.460 --> 02:11:42.460
That's more than what I did.

02:11:42.460 --> 02:11:44.460
Yeah, I'm sorry.

02:11:44.460 --> 02:11:45.460
And I'm sorry.

02:11:45.460 --> 02:11:48.460
I saved all the emails that didn't look like they had been checked.

02:11:48.460 --> 02:11:49.460
So I apologize.

02:11:49.460 --> 02:11:51.460
I'm glad I went back and looked for it.

02:11:51.460 --> 02:11:55.460
Darsakha and I have different ways of managing the email account, as in she manages it and

02:11:56.460 --> 02:11:59.460
But Bobby Shade Wolf in our chat room says,

02:11:59.460 --> 02:12:03.460
You do realize that game jams expect you to finish something by the deadline, usually,

02:12:03.460 --> 02:12:05.460
right, Loki?

02:12:05.460 --> 02:12:08.460
Hey, Loki could have gotten a pizza.

02:12:08.460 --> 02:12:10.460
I offered him pizza.

02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:11.460
That's right.

02:12:11.460 --> 02:12:13.460
Oh, yeah, the pizza.

02:12:13.460 --> 02:12:14.460
Oh, my.

02:12:14.460 --> 02:12:15.460
That was my favorite.

02:12:15.460 --> 02:12:18.460
That was one of my favorite jokes ever on this show.

02:12:18.460 --> 02:12:19.460
It's a contest.

02:12:19.460 --> 02:12:23.460
One person is eligible.

02:12:23.460 --> 02:12:29.460
I can even extend time to pizza because I can have it delivered to your house.

02:12:29.460 --> 02:12:32.460
So I will extend time to pizza for this year.

02:12:32.460 --> 02:12:33.460
Elliot, here's the bummer.

02:12:33.460 --> 02:12:37.460
Thank you for emailing us and congratulations on your successful game jam.

02:12:37.460 --> 02:12:40.460
But here's the gag since I didn't see your email till just before we went on air.

02:12:40.460 --> 02:12:42.460
I haven't been able to play your game.

02:12:42.460 --> 02:12:48.460
So I'm sure it's great, like, but I can't comment on it further.

02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:50.460
But congratulations on completing that.

02:12:50.460 --> 02:12:53.460
And it does sound like there's a lot of people that participate in this game jam.

02:12:53.460 --> 02:12:56.460
And I'm not surprised, especially in quarantine time,

02:12:56.460 --> 02:12:59.460
that you have so many people that are participating in game jams.

02:12:59.460 --> 02:13:01.460
Hell, Loki actually almost did it.

02:13:01.460 --> 02:13:04.460
And he might have, like, at least put an idea down or something.

02:13:04.460 --> 02:13:06.460
I did put an idea down.

02:13:06.460 --> 02:13:08.460
Oh, oh.

02:13:08.460 --> 02:13:15.460
I didn't make anything, but I put the idea down because it was the idea.

02:13:15.460 --> 02:13:17.460
Now we want to know.

02:13:18.460 --> 02:13:20.460
Well, first I have to make it sure it's the same game jam

02:13:20.460 --> 02:13:22.460
because there's, like, several game jams going on at the same time.

02:13:22.460 --> 02:13:28.460
So I think it was, if I'm correct, it was the one that was Out of Control, I think was the theme.

02:13:28.460 --> 02:13:30.460
Yes, OK, so it was.

02:13:30.460 --> 02:13:32.460
So it was Out of Control was the theme.

02:13:32.460 --> 02:13:39.460
And I was inspired by this game I played on the Ouya called No Brakes Valet.

02:13:39.460 --> 02:13:43.460
So the whole premise was going to be a, like, just a racing game.

02:13:43.460 --> 02:13:46.460
But it's all gas, no brakes.

02:13:46.460 --> 02:13:48.460
So that was going to be the game.

02:13:48.460 --> 02:13:53.460
It's a racing game the way I play racing games, which is I don't use the brakes at all.

02:13:53.460 --> 02:13:55.460
I just smash into the walls and stuff.

02:13:55.460 --> 02:14:01.460
And so not so much a racing game, but kind of like a puzzle game where you would have to get to your house

02:14:01.460 --> 02:14:07.460
or something like that without killing yourself, which means colliding with another car.

02:14:07.460 --> 02:14:12.460
But of course, there'd be collateral damage with, like, pedestrians on the street and stuff like that.

02:14:12.460 --> 02:14:15.460
Are you sure you aren't describing roundabout?

02:14:15.460 --> 02:14:18.460
Because I'm kind of, did you ever play roundabout with the limo?

02:14:18.460 --> 02:14:21.460
No, I did play roundabout. That's a whole, it's a different type of game.

02:14:21.460 --> 02:14:23.460
I know what you're talking about there.

02:14:23.460 --> 02:14:30.460
Shane has spent years trying to convince me that game is funny when I'm like, it's more awkward than it is funny.

02:14:30.460 --> 02:14:35.460
It's OK. It was an OK game. I played it, but like, no.

02:14:35.460 --> 02:14:38.460
Cue a text message in three, two, one.

02:14:38.460 --> 02:14:42.460
Yeah. No Brakes Valet was the one I played because that was kind of fun.

02:14:42.460 --> 02:14:46.460
You had to park a car, but you fit.

02:14:46.460 --> 02:14:51.460
Well, that one, you could use brakes, although I didn't figure out that there was a brake button for the longest time.

02:14:51.460 --> 02:14:58.460
But you tried to park your car in specific spaces and then one of them has no brakes.

02:14:58.460 --> 02:15:02.460
And you and you're just smashing cars in this like this parking lot.

02:15:02.460 --> 02:15:04.460
It's kind of funny. Yeah. OK. Inspiration.

02:15:05.460 --> 02:15:08.460
That's going to take too long. Not going to have the time to actually take.

02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:14.460
I was going to get about like half of the time in the jam anyways to even work on anything and probably less than that.

02:15:14.460 --> 02:15:16.460
So I just didn't start it.

02:15:16.460 --> 02:15:21.460
Elliot in chat says, Loki, that would have totally fit the theme of GMTK Jam.

02:15:21.460 --> 02:15:24.460
That was the name of it this year. The theme was out of control.

02:15:24.460 --> 02:15:26.460
So this is the same game jam.

02:15:26.460 --> 02:15:30.460
Yeah, it was. Yeah. I followed their channel. I watched a lot of their videos and stuff.

02:15:30.460 --> 02:15:34.460
So we'll go play Elliot's game. It's the link is in chat.

02:15:34.460 --> 02:15:37.460
I'll read it because it's not too hard to remember.

02:15:37.460 --> 02:15:42.460
Paw prints. So P.A.W.P.R.I.N.T.S. dot itch dot IO.

02:15:42.460 --> 02:15:49.460
Everybody knows that site, right? Paw prints dot itch IO slash momentum is the place to go to check out Elliot's game,

02:15:49.460 --> 02:15:58.460
which he said was a little bit kind of kind of inspired by Celeste a little bit or a lot of like I seriously a lot of these game jams are starting to mix together.

02:15:58.460 --> 02:16:03.460
There's there's another one that's Kenny. They're doing a Kenny land.

02:16:03.460 --> 02:16:07.460
So Kenny is the guy. He does a lot of like CC zero assets out there.

02:16:07.460 --> 02:16:12.460
So he's very famous and like the indie community as far as providing free art assets.

02:16:12.460 --> 02:16:16.460
So he has a gym coming out that's going to be using his art assets.

02:16:16.460 --> 02:16:22.460
Then there's the code list jam, which is being done by our local.

02:16:22.460 --> 02:16:25.460
I don't remember the called now, but the SAC Gaming Collective or something like that.

02:16:25.460 --> 02:16:28.460
So they have their developers collective. Yeah. Yeah.

02:16:28.460 --> 02:16:35.460
So they're doing one that's it's a game jam that you have to use the visual scripting tools.

02:16:35.460 --> 02:16:44.460
So like Bolt and I guess I'm trying to think what the UE4 stuff is.

02:16:44.460 --> 02:16:51.460
Their blueprints and stuff like that. So you have to use that, which that's kind of a learning curve in itself.

02:16:51.460 --> 02:16:55.460
But that's coming up. I like I seriously like all of these start crisscrossing.

02:16:55.460 --> 02:17:02.460
Like I thought that the CC that the one game jam was the Kenny jam for like this time around, too.

02:17:02.460 --> 02:17:08.460
So I don't know. But yeah, it's fun. I just wish I had the time.

02:17:08.460 --> 02:17:18.460
Don't need to need to be longer. Like, you know, like I wish I could get in on the progressive game jams that the Sacramento group does,

02:17:18.460 --> 02:17:24.460
because it's basically just getting together with a bunch of people like for five hours every month or week or whatever.

02:17:24.460 --> 02:17:33.460
I think it's month and just starting to like collaborate that way over a long period of time versus like being able to have to cram in 48 hours.

02:17:33.460 --> 02:17:38.460
I just I can't. Yeah, that's just like well, that's just like having like a regular DND game, basically.

02:17:38.460 --> 02:17:42.460
But instead of playing a DND campaign, you're working as a group to create a new game.

02:17:42.460 --> 02:17:51.460
Yeah, that that fits more like your lifestyle where, you know, you have to worry about raising kids and stuff and you can't exactly pull, you know, 48 hours straight and all that.

02:17:51.460 --> 02:17:55.460
So I wish I could. I mean, I get it. I get it. That would be great. All right.

02:17:55.460 --> 02:17:58.460
Well, let's move on with the show. We do have some more news we want to get into here.

02:17:58.460 --> 02:18:04.460
Thank you so much for the email, Elliot. And I hope a lot of our listeners choose to play your game, which you got in chat there a moment ago.

02:18:04.460 --> 02:18:11.460
And I will play it later this week. Promise. OK, let's move on and get into some other news.

02:18:11.460 --> 02:18:17.460
And Loki, I think you're gonna start us off with this story. Yes. So this is interesting.

02:18:17.460 --> 02:18:24.460
So there's this brand new Tetris mole game, I guess that is.

02:18:24.460 --> 02:18:34.460
I guess it's a it's a brand new show that they're doing where you compete with other players to earn money by playing Tetris.

02:18:34.460 --> 02:18:44.460
So every night, I guess at seven thirty, there's a show that's hosted by this actor, Millen Baird in New Zealand.

02:18:44.460 --> 02:18:49.460
And players will fight each other for five thousand dollar daily prize pool.

02:18:49.460 --> 02:18:56.460
And you play the current cities that you play in. Auckland, Perth, Moscow, Berlin, London, New York City and Los Angeles.

02:18:56.460 --> 02:19:03.460
So whatever city you're closest to would be the city that you're competing in. And app is, I guess, free on Android and iOS.

02:19:03.460 --> 02:19:11.460
And it's called Network Tetris and network with the E is a three.

02:19:11.460 --> 02:19:20.460
So, yeah, you can try your chance to get money or what's actually probably going to happen is the people that are really good at Tetris are going to beat the crap out of you.

02:19:20.460 --> 02:19:27.460
Yeah, somebody's going to somebody's going to cheat it or something. I wonder who cheated, but it's just going to be like you're going to have those kids.

02:19:27.460 --> 02:19:34.460
Does anyone know if Kevin D.R. has found this game yet and attacked it? I'd be so curious.

02:19:34.460 --> 02:19:39.460
So, yeah, I because I know he's very, very, very good at Tetris and could probably.

02:19:39.460 --> 02:19:44.460
Yes, a lot of people. It is actually it's just the official Tetris game.

02:19:44.460 --> 02:19:50.460
The company that makes it, though, is Network Inc, which is, you know, so just look for Tetris.

02:19:51.460 --> 02:19:58.460
It's HQ trivia meets Tetris 99, basically, I guess. Yeah. Interesting. All right.

02:19:58.460 --> 02:20:02.460
We'll see. We'll see what happens. All right. Moving on. Let's talk about now.

02:20:02.460 --> 02:20:14.460
I don't I don't always need to talk about ninjas every step and move as as big news because I personally don't really follow the guy just because I'm not shading him.

02:20:14.460 --> 02:20:18.460
It's just I follow other people that I just know and, you know, so forth.

02:20:18.460 --> 02:20:24.460
I kind of keep it around like a similar circle to what I follow on Twitter. But I'm not an idiot.

02:20:24.460 --> 02:20:27.460
I know that Ninja does have a lot of people that do follow him.

02:20:27.460 --> 02:20:33.460
And wherever ninjas goes to stream is probably going to lead a big crowd with him.

02:20:33.460 --> 02:20:40.460
Now, he was on Mixer, as we all know, and Mixer is not going to be any more pretty soon.

02:20:40.460 --> 02:20:46.460
And Ninja turned down basically the opportunity to go right over to Facebook gaming.

02:20:46.460 --> 02:20:51.460
And I don't blame him because he wants to probably will a face Facebook gaming sucks, too.

02:20:51.460 --> 02:20:56.460
He probably wants to see what kind of money they're willing to give him first.

02:20:56.460 --> 02:21:05.460
So anyway, some reports that are showing up this week is that now this is this is kind of a you know, this is coming from an e-sports consultant's Twitter account.

02:21:05.460 --> 02:21:06.460
Take it with a grain of salt.

02:21:06.460 --> 02:21:12.460
But based I mean, it isn't it isn't outside the on the plausibility scale. It ranks high.

02:21:12.460 --> 02:21:19.460
So Ninja says is in negotiate. They are in negotiations with streaming platforms and no exclusive deal has yet been signed.

02:21:19.460 --> 02:21:22.460
But I'm like, how many streaming platforms are there that are left?

02:21:22.460 --> 02:21:29.460
Twitch, which he was with before YouTube and Facebook gaming, unless we don't count that last.

02:21:29.460 --> 02:21:34.460
And I don't count flop book gaming. I'm sorry. It's that would be a horrible decision.

02:21:34.460 --> 02:21:41.460
Like, but I could I could go off again, but I'd just be repeating myself from the last several weeks.

02:21:41.460 --> 02:21:45.460
Friends don't look flat. Friends stream on flop book gaming.

02:21:45.460 --> 02:21:52.460
So Ninja, but Ninja just you know what, if they want to pay him tons of money, then Ninja is willing to go there.

02:21:52.460 --> 02:21:58.460
It sounds like it'll just see what happens. In the meantime, Ninja started a YouTube stream.

02:21:58.460 --> 02:22:01.460
And so it's just kind of like, let's see what kind of numbers I can pull on YouTube.

02:22:01.460 --> 02:22:07.460
Just, you know, doing a stream. And apparently one hundred and sixty thousand concurrent viewers showed up.

02:22:07.460 --> 02:22:10.460
Although it did drop down to one hundred and twenty thousand people.

02:22:10.460 --> 02:22:15.460
But I doubt that many people have ever listened to OLR in the world.

02:22:15.460 --> 02:22:21.460
So that's still a really big number of people to be pulling in for one of your streams.

02:22:21.460 --> 02:22:25.460
So that's pretty big. So, yeah, who knows where he'll end up.

02:22:25.460 --> 02:22:29.460
And then there's always been those rumors about some type of like new streaming platform.

02:22:29.460 --> 02:22:36.460
But seeing as those rumors also said we'd have an announcement by now, I'm sure those rumors were just full of crap.

02:22:36.460 --> 02:22:39.460
But we'll we'll see what comes of this, because, you know, again,

02:22:39.460 --> 02:22:47.460
although I don't think it's necessarily worth reporting on this guy's every move and step, he does carry a big audience.

02:22:47.460 --> 02:22:53.460
And it is. I mean, if he does sign with flop book, it's going to be a pretty big deal.

02:22:53.460 --> 02:22:55.460
So, you know, we'll see what happens with that.

02:22:55.460 --> 02:23:02.460
So, Tiger Claw says there's others, too. There's SmashCast.tv.

02:23:02.460 --> 02:23:06.460
Now, who knows if these companies could afford Ninja, though?

02:23:06.460 --> 02:23:11.460
However, then with a with an up and comer like a SmashCast.

02:23:11.460 --> 02:23:14.460
I don't know this company's financials. They're investors.

02:23:14.460 --> 02:23:22.460
But let's say you have a startup. Something you can start to negotiate with with Ninja is a percentage of the stake in the company.

02:23:22.460 --> 02:23:24.460
You know, like an episode of Shark Tank, right?

02:23:24.460 --> 02:23:28.460
You get Ninja to join your up and coming thing for a 10 percent stake in the company.

02:23:28.460 --> 02:23:33.460
And as his exposure helps up your total number of viewers, then your total valuation of your company goes up.

02:23:33.460 --> 02:23:37.460
So it's like that stock he's holding goes up and up and up, basically.

02:23:37.460 --> 02:23:42.460
So that could be an interesting thing to leverage with a newer company.

02:23:42.460 --> 02:23:45.460
So we'll see. So. All right.

02:23:45.460 --> 02:23:50.460
Act F says GFM cast is lucky if we get more than three concurrent viewers.

02:23:50.460 --> 02:23:53.460
G.G. Ramas says, I feel you. And you know what?

02:23:53.460 --> 02:24:00.460
And I tell all the podcasters in the world that I know this is that as even if there's just one person there,

02:24:00.460 --> 02:24:03.460
that's still one person that wants to tune in to hear to what you have to say.

02:24:03.460 --> 02:24:09.460
And also, sometimes it's about, you know, because we we were in those levels for years and years and years.

02:24:10.460 --> 02:24:15.460
And sometimes it's about getting the group together to talk about to just hang,

02:24:15.460 --> 02:24:19.460
to hang as a group and talk about the things that you enjoy and that.

02:24:19.460 --> 02:24:21.460
I'd like to think we'd still be doing a well,

02:24:21.460 --> 02:24:25.460
or even if we were only getting seven people here like we used to in the old days.

02:24:25.460 --> 02:24:30.460
So they're going to miss all this wig action.

02:24:30.460 --> 02:24:35.460
This is right. Those hundred twenty thousand people show today.

02:24:35.460 --> 02:24:40.460
Those hundred twenty thousand people, they might be seeing Ninja, but are they seeing wigs?

02:24:40.460 --> 02:24:45.460
I don't think so. Are they seeing all this?

02:24:51.460 --> 02:24:56.460
Anyway, D.G. Ramas says, sometimes I do wish we'd get big numbers, but you know what?

02:24:56.460 --> 02:25:01.460
When me, Mako, Ichigo and Ari do a show, it's just freaking fun and I love it.

02:25:01.460 --> 02:25:06.460
And you know, I've kind of and I've said this before, like I feel like our moment has probably come and gone

02:25:06.460 --> 02:25:10.460
where we would have been one of those shows that has hundreds of thousands of people watching.

02:25:10.460 --> 02:25:13.460
And you know what? I'm at peace with it because when hundreds of people watch you,

02:25:13.460 --> 02:25:16.460
that's when all of your movements get over analyzed.

02:25:16.460 --> 02:25:22.460
And that's when, you know, people will dig back in the archives and find some shitty thing from the show

02:25:22.460 --> 02:25:25.460
15 years ago and try to cancel me over it and all this stuff.

02:25:25.460 --> 02:25:30.460
And I'm just like, you know, sometimes having a small group, it's not such a bad thing.

02:25:31.460 --> 02:25:36.460
So. All right. Anyhow, let's move on, shall we?

02:25:36.460 --> 02:25:39.460
I think where we are now is Dark Soccer. This is yours, right?

02:25:39.460 --> 02:25:43.460
Oh, my gosh. It's been so long since I've done a show all the way through.

02:25:43.460 --> 02:25:48.460
Anyway, how about some Amazon stuff?

02:25:48.460 --> 02:25:54.460
Their MMO title, New Earth, got delayed.

02:25:54.460 --> 02:26:03.460
Basically, they they had this whole, like, new entire world thing.

02:26:03.460 --> 02:26:09.460
And it was supposed to set in some time at this point.

02:26:09.460 --> 02:26:12.460
It was actually supposed to be released, I think, in March.

02:26:12.460 --> 02:26:15.460
And then it was delayed until August 25th.

02:26:15.460 --> 02:26:22.460
And now their studio director, Rich Lawrence, is saying they're delaying it until spring 2021.

02:26:22.460 --> 02:26:28.460
And the reason is from different responses to the game's alpha reviews.

02:26:28.460 --> 02:26:35.460
And the developers are trying to make sure that the most devoted players have loads of middle and end game experiences.

02:26:35.460 --> 02:26:44.460
That is a quote. And so as compensation for this, there's going to be a beta for a limited time starting August 25th.

02:26:44.460 --> 02:26:52.460
There'll be a beta sign up coming later on with those who preordered the game getting first access.

02:26:52.460 --> 02:26:56.460
And so you can look into that and and order it.

02:26:56.460 --> 02:27:04.460
If you're you know, I mean, if if you've got the preorder, then then you'll be able to get in on the beta.

02:27:04.460 --> 02:27:11.460
And honestly, I commend them for listening to the reviews and for taking all of that into account,

02:27:11.460 --> 02:27:18.460
because I would rather and while I have probably zero interest in playing it,

02:27:18.460 --> 02:27:26.460
I would rather that they listen to the feedback and put time and effort into a quality release.

02:27:26.460 --> 02:27:31.460
Well, and as as Quest Buster says in chat, after what happened with Crucible, I don't blame them.

02:27:31.460 --> 02:27:36.460
That was a train wreck. And yeah, Amazon's track record with gaming for all the hype that, you know,

02:27:36.460 --> 02:27:42.460
oh, my gosh, Amazon's got a game studio company. This isn't been a great year for them and this type of news.

02:27:42.460 --> 02:27:47.460
So even though this delay will probably inevitably be a good thing for the lifespan of the game,

02:27:47.460 --> 02:27:52.460
it isn't a good thing for Amazon Game Studios. Look now, at the same time,

02:27:52.460 --> 02:27:58.460
you look at Amazon as an entire company and someone like Jeff Bezos has like one of those rooms that Uncle Scrooge has,

02:27:58.460 --> 02:28:05.460
where you just who where who can dive off of the diving board and just swim in the money pit of money.

02:28:05.460 --> 02:28:13.460
So I don't I'm not exactly concerned for Amazon's financial stability, but it's still probably not a great look for the company.

02:28:13.460 --> 02:28:20.460
So anyway, as as we're on our Amazon owned Twitch feed.

02:28:20.460 --> 02:28:26.460
But I'm looking at you. Yep. All right. Moving on. Loki.

02:28:26.460 --> 02:28:32.460
All right. So this is kind of odd. So we just got done talking about a game show for Tetris.

02:28:32.460 --> 02:28:38.460
Now there's a reality show for The Sims. Now, this is not what you might think it might be.

02:28:38.460 --> 02:28:42.460
Please say they speak Simlish. They do not speak Simlish.

02:28:42.460 --> 02:28:52.460
So this is a little bit along the lines of like a almost like that that Lego show that they had not too long ago.

02:28:52.460 --> 02:28:57.460
It's about building stuff with The Sims.

02:28:57.460 --> 02:29:02.460
So it's called The Sims Sparked and supposed to premiere actually on the 17th.

02:29:02.460 --> 02:29:11.460
So that's this week. And it's supposed to be with contestants creating characters, worlds and stories in The Sims 4.

02:29:11.460 --> 02:29:21.460
And with that, I guess there they have like a judges panel which will judge them and everything about the creations that they make and everything.

02:29:21.460 --> 02:29:24.460
I just I don't know. It's interesting.

02:29:24.460 --> 02:29:30.460
It also looks a little bit like Project Runway or something like that, you know, where they're just like building different things.

02:29:30.460 --> 02:29:35.460
In fact, I think they even have parts where they're building clothing for their characters and stuff.

02:29:35.460 --> 02:29:45.460
So it's different. That's for sure. But if it's anything like Lego Masters or whatever, where they focus on the drama.

02:29:45.460 --> 02:29:50.460
Like, I hate that. I know maybe reality TV is just not for me because it's always focusing on drama.

02:29:50.460 --> 02:29:55.460
But like, I love competition shows, but I hate when it's like a reality competition show.

02:29:55.460 --> 02:30:00.460
I just would like the competition without all of the drama thrown in.

02:30:00.460 --> 02:30:08.460
Yeah, I don't know. I mean, it's probably going to be a bit of a mess, but I still think Dark Sakura should think about applying because I mean,

02:30:08.460 --> 02:30:14.460
Dark Sakura is very talented when it comes to The Sims and she has wigs.

02:30:15.460 --> 02:30:21.460
She stepped away so she can't comment at the moment, but I'm still going to encourage that.

02:30:21.460 --> 02:30:28.460
So apparently the judges that are on the panel for this first season, they have YouTube creator Kelsey Impechi.

02:30:28.460 --> 02:30:33.460
I don't know how to pronounce her name. Sims voice actor Tayla Parks.

02:30:33.460 --> 02:30:39.460
And I guess Dave Sim Guru Ninja Itoki.

02:30:39.460 --> 02:30:44.460
And I guess they're going to have a producer as well for Maxis.

02:30:46.460 --> 02:30:52.460
I don't know. It says the contestants are our various online personalities, which I guess have a connection to the series.

02:30:52.460 --> 02:30:54.460
It's kind of similar to how Lego Masters was.

02:30:54.460 --> 02:30:58.460
Wait, was that their judging panel you just read off?

02:30:58.460 --> 02:31:02.460
Is like, wow, that's OK. Interesting.

02:31:02.460 --> 02:31:06.460
So YouTube YouTube influencers are judging this.

02:31:06.460 --> 02:31:10.460
Hey, Dark Sakura, we think you should go on The Sims reality show.

02:31:10.460 --> 02:31:19.460
And there's a Sims reality show where because because you're good at The Sims about making stuff and you could make our show famous.

02:31:19.460 --> 02:31:25.460
OK, they can pay me. I love how if you win.

02:31:25.460 --> 02:31:29.460
So like the Lego builders thing. Yes, it is actually.

02:31:29.460 --> 02:31:32.460
So apparently it's pretty short. They said this is far.

02:31:32.460 --> 02:31:36.460
It's a joint production between TVS and BuzzFeed multiplayer.

02:31:36.460 --> 02:31:43.460
And all four episodes are going to be online on Monday after the air or the Monday after they air on television.

02:31:43.460 --> 02:31:45.460
So.

02:31:45.460 --> 02:31:49.460
Neat, I guess.

02:31:49.460 --> 02:31:55.460
I don't know. Not really interested in this is, but I don't know.

02:31:55.460 --> 02:32:03.460
Some of the people I watch on YouTube, like the guy call me Kevin or whatever, would be more interesting to see on this show than some of these creators.

02:32:03.460 --> 02:32:13.460
OK, and I'm sorry if I mispronounce your name, but I think I read that as I touch is an art, says the best line for dark soccer competing in this show.

02:32:13.460 --> 02:32:17.460
Love your hair. Hope you win.

02:32:17.460 --> 02:32:19.460
Yeah.

02:32:19.460 --> 02:32:22.460
Which is a drag race, man. Yeah.

02:32:23.460 --> 02:32:30.460
For the record, the wig that I'm wearing now, as some of you may remember, my hair was actually this color before.

02:32:30.460 --> 02:32:34.460
I got this wig at DragCon two years ago, actually.

02:32:34.460 --> 02:32:40.460
My buddy J.J., also known as the queen Miss Patsy declined, got me this wig.

02:32:40.460 --> 02:32:45.460
It's your lightning wig. You look like lightning. I agree with chat. You look like lightning in that wig.

02:32:45.460 --> 02:32:50.460
So love it. All right. They have a speed run competition for killing the Sims in this game.

02:32:50.460 --> 02:32:53.460
I don't see I could see the dark soccer anymore.

02:32:53.460 --> 02:32:59.460
Dark soccer could design like a murder house. And I think that would be she could be the spooky contestant.

02:32:59.460 --> 02:33:03.460
Like, well, I was going to say Sharon Needles, but we don't talk about her anymore.

02:33:03.460 --> 02:33:06.460
So spooky, like I don't know who's spooky in the drag race.

02:33:07.460 --> 02:33:09.460
Elvira. Oh, perfect.

02:33:09.460 --> 02:33:16.460
And Elvira is a bio queen. Let's be real.

02:33:16.460 --> 02:33:20.460
She's like, yeah, everybody, everybody says Drag Race has never had a bio queen on it.

02:33:20.460 --> 02:33:23.460
They've had one on the judging panel. Not that they shouldn't have contestants on the show, too.

02:33:23.460 --> 02:33:26.460
But they've had one on the judging panel several times. Elvira.

02:33:26.460 --> 02:33:32.460
So, yeah, well, and myself, myself, Visage. I mean, yeah, true.

02:33:32.460 --> 02:33:39.460
All right. Anyway, moving on, let's talk about when you want to make big changes to your character in a game like World of Warcraft.

02:33:39.460 --> 02:33:44.460
You've had to pay a fee before if you want to make changes like you want to change the race or the gender or what have you.

02:33:44.460 --> 02:33:49.460
You have to pay a fee to Activision Blizzard in order to do that.

02:33:49.460 --> 02:33:53.460
However, they just had like a little press.

02:33:53.460 --> 02:33:58.460
They had like a little hour long kind of livestream about World of Warcraft Shadowlands.

02:33:58.460 --> 02:34:07.460
And one of the things that they announced is that they are actually going to be removing the 15 dollar fee to change the gender of your character.

02:34:07.460 --> 02:34:11.460
And they're going to say it's going to be similar basically to like the barbershop.

02:34:11.460 --> 02:34:19.460
If you go in and get the haircut, you know, you can change your gender easily without that money being spent if you want.

02:34:19.460 --> 02:34:25.460
And it seems like part of the reason here, there is an interview that happened with Eurogamer and the executive producer behind Shadowlands,

02:34:25.460 --> 02:34:32.460
John Hight, said that the fee was not sending the right message, but that they also can't fix it through a hot fix.

02:34:32.460 --> 02:34:42.460
And they're also talking a little bit about this new character that's in Shadowlands called Pelagos that many are interpreting as a transgender character in WoW

02:34:42.460 --> 02:34:49.460
because they're saying aspirants are able to choose a physical form that represents their true self.

02:34:49.460 --> 02:34:55.460
Pelagos, who presented as a woman in his mortal life, chose to be a man in the Shadowlands.

02:34:55.460 --> 02:35:01.460
So there's an interesting kind of like parallel there about becoming like your true self and so forth.

02:35:01.460 --> 02:35:06.460
And so maybe they felt, I'm assuming, I'm kind of filling the gaps that maybe if there are some players,

02:35:06.460 --> 02:35:11.460
and let's be real, World of Warcraft has been out for 15 plus years.

02:35:11.460 --> 02:35:17.460
And maybe there's some people out there that with their characters can maybe relate to a situation like Pelagos.

02:35:17.460 --> 02:35:22.460
They don't want to put a $15 fee so that you can change the gender of your character.

02:35:22.460 --> 02:35:29.460
So the rare story about removing a microtransaction. How about that?

02:35:29.460 --> 02:35:31.460
Now I've seen everything.

02:35:31.460 --> 02:35:36.460
Especially from a game that already had a monthly fee. So that's pretty cool.

02:35:36.460 --> 02:35:38.460
I think it's a good step toward being inclusive.

02:35:38.460 --> 02:35:43.460
It is. And it's neat to hear that they have that storyline in Shadowlands.

02:35:43.460 --> 02:35:47.460
And I'm only refraining from talking much more about it because I'm going to be honest,

02:35:47.460 --> 02:35:50.460
I haven't followed World of Warcraft as closely in quite a while.

02:35:50.460 --> 02:35:53.460
So I don't want to like fuck up or misrepresent something.

02:35:53.460 --> 02:35:58.460
But you know, kind of what I'm reading about it, it does sound like they're exploring some themes in the game

02:35:58.460 --> 02:36:04.460
where maybe they've been told they could have explored a long time ago.

02:36:04.460 --> 02:36:06.460
I'm still not going back to WoW.

02:36:06.460 --> 02:36:10.460
I don't see myself visiting it anytime soon.

02:36:10.460 --> 02:36:14.460
But I can still say I'm glad it's happening for the people that are still there.

02:36:14.460 --> 02:36:18.460
Because I know plenty of people that still love and appreciate World of Warcraft.

02:36:18.460 --> 02:36:20.460
And will probably be thrilled that this is there.

02:36:20.460 --> 02:36:22.460
So, yay.

02:36:22.460 --> 02:36:24.460
Alright.

02:36:24.460 --> 02:36:26.460
Moving, yeah.

02:36:26.460 --> 02:36:29.460
Sia Tabiri in chat says $15 is a microtransaction?

02:36:29.460 --> 02:36:31.460
I need a bigger piggy bank. Good point.

02:36:31.460 --> 02:36:33.460
Remember, they're all transactions.

02:36:33.460 --> 02:36:34.460
I know.

02:36:34.460 --> 02:36:36.460
They're all taking money out of your pocket.

02:36:36.460 --> 02:36:39.460
You know what they're, you know what they're really calling it, though.

02:36:39.460 --> 02:36:41.460
Alright, anyhow.

02:36:41.460 --> 02:36:44.460
Let's get into, that was our last scheduled story.

02:36:44.460 --> 02:36:46.460
So this is the listener roundtable.

02:36:46.460 --> 02:36:50.460
If you want to bring up any additional comments or questions that we haven't addressed on the show yet,

02:36:50.460 --> 02:36:54.460
you can bring that up in our chat room here.

02:36:54.460 --> 02:36:57.460
Okay, wow. Hype Mayhem was ready to go with a comment there.

02:36:57.460 --> 02:36:59.460
Let me read through this.

02:36:59.460 --> 02:37:01.460
Excuse me, let me read through this here.

02:37:01.460 --> 02:37:03.460
Ask Loki, of course, and Dark StarCraft.

02:37:03.460 --> 02:37:05.460
They have any last minute stories in a moment.

02:37:05.460 --> 02:37:07.460
But first, Hype Mayhem says,

02:37:07.460 --> 02:37:10.460
This primarily applies to PC gaming more than consoles.

02:37:10.460 --> 02:37:13.460
Since PC gaming is pretty much digital only,

02:37:13.460 --> 02:37:15.460
physical releases have gone the way of the 8-track,

02:37:15.460 --> 02:37:18.460
and games can often get delisted for XYZ reasons,

02:37:18.460 --> 02:37:20.460
I see PC gamers having two options.

02:37:20.460 --> 02:37:23.460
Either buy up any games that look interesting,

02:37:23.460 --> 02:37:26.460
and hedge against the possibility of missing out due to delisting.

02:37:26.460 --> 02:37:28.460
But backlogs get insanely huge.

02:37:28.460 --> 02:37:31.460
Or keep purchasing and backlog is reasonable,

02:37:31.460 --> 02:37:34.460
but run the risk of missing out on buying a game.

02:37:34.460 --> 02:37:39.460
So all that being said, which camp do you folks find yourselves in and why?

02:37:39.460 --> 02:37:42.460
I'm going to invent a new camp.

02:37:42.460 --> 02:37:44.460
Because that's what I do.

02:37:44.460 --> 02:37:48.460
This illustrates, the situation you're describing,

02:37:48.460 --> 02:37:52.460
illustrates the importance of preserving video game history,

02:37:52.460 --> 02:37:56.460
and why we need websites like archive.org

02:37:56.460 --> 02:37:59.460
that are exploring about preserving old video games.

02:37:59.460 --> 02:38:02.460
Because honestly, if you go into their library,

02:38:02.460 --> 02:38:04.460
it's kind of the reverse of what you're talking about.

02:38:04.460 --> 02:38:07.460
It's not necessarily things that were digital and got delisted.

02:38:07.460 --> 02:38:11.460
It were things that were physical that you can no longer find anymore.

02:38:11.460 --> 02:38:13.460
Or that don't really run on current computers,

02:38:13.460 --> 02:38:15.460
because the software has changed.

02:38:15.460 --> 02:38:19.460
So I think that preservation of games is super important.

02:38:19.460 --> 02:38:24.460
And I don't necessarily believe in filling up a gigantic backlog

02:38:24.460 --> 02:38:26.460
that I'll never get through.

02:38:26.460 --> 02:38:29.460
I just want to see that the old games get protected.

02:38:29.460 --> 02:38:32.460
So that way, if I do think of a game 20 years from now

02:38:32.460 --> 02:38:35.460
that I want to show someone else's kid,

02:38:35.460 --> 02:38:36.460
because I'm not going to have my own.

02:38:36.460 --> 02:38:38.460
But if I want to show someone else's kid this game that I used to play,

02:38:38.460 --> 02:38:41.460
I want to know that there will be a place like archive.org

02:38:41.460 --> 02:38:44.460
or something like that, where I can pull up the game

02:38:44.460 --> 02:38:46.460
and show it to somebody.

02:38:46.460 --> 02:38:47.460
You know what I mean?

02:38:47.460 --> 02:38:50.460
So I love archive for the old game stuff.

02:38:51.460 --> 02:38:54.460
Able to pull up old Dr. Brain games on there

02:38:54.460 --> 02:38:58.460
and some of the old edutainment games from the Apple days.

02:38:58.460 --> 02:39:00.460
And it's not just about like,

02:39:00.460 --> 02:39:03.460
oh, I want to play all these games for free.

02:39:03.460 --> 02:39:05.460
It's a nostalgia trip.

02:39:05.460 --> 02:39:07.460
It's remembering things.

02:39:07.460 --> 02:39:11.460
It's the equivalent of looking at an old magazine in a library.

02:39:11.460 --> 02:39:12.460
You know what I mean?

02:39:12.460 --> 02:39:14.460
Like, is the magazine going to go out of business

02:39:14.460 --> 02:39:16.460
because I looked at an old copy in the library?

02:39:16.460 --> 02:39:18.460
I don't know.

02:39:18.460 --> 02:39:20.460
Anyway, so that's my kind of take on it.

02:39:20.460 --> 02:39:22.460
I don't know if you guys have anything to add to that.

02:39:24.460 --> 02:39:29.460
Dark Soccer, you're a big game collector of sorts, I suppose.

02:39:29.460 --> 02:39:34.460
Like, is the concept of digital collection important to you?

02:39:36.460 --> 02:39:40.460
Lately, if there's something that I'm really into,

02:39:40.460 --> 02:39:41.460
I think I would have a physical copy.

02:39:41.460 --> 02:39:44.460
And I would have done that for Animal Crossing.

02:39:44.460 --> 02:39:47.460
But I had pneumonia when it came out.

02:39:47.460 --> 02:39:49.460
I got the digital copy.

02:39:50.460 --> 02:39:57.460
So I'm not, I guess, as much into it as I used to be, I guess.

02:39:57.460 --> 02:40:01.460
You know, just it doesn't seem as important,

02:40:01.460 --> 02:40:07.460
especially now since I'm, I guess, trying to downsize.

02:40:07.460 --> 02:40:09.460
Yeah, I hear that.

02:40:09.460 --> 02:40:10.460
I hear that.

02:40:10.460 --> 02:40:12.460
Well, although, I mean, we're not selling anything.

02:40:12.460 --> 02:40:14.460
And I might downsize a kitty

02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:16.460
if he doesn't shut the hell up over there.

02:40:16.460 --> 02:40:17.460
All right.

02:40:17.460 --> 02:40:19.460
I cannot hear the smooshy.

02:40:19.460 --> 02:40:20.460
Oh, really?

02:40:20.460 --> 02:40:21.460
He's being louder than he usually is.

02:40:21.460 --> 02:40:22.460
All right.

02:40:22.460 --> 02:40:24.460
And I miss picking him up against his will.

02:40:24.460 --> 02:40:26.460
He misses you too, Aunt Jamie.

02:40:26.460 --> 02:40:27.460
All right.

02:40:27.460 --> 02:40:31.460
Anyway, let's see if there's any, if there's any, yeah.

02:40:31.460 --> 02:40:33.460
The chat's like, oh, now I hear smoosh.

02:40:33.460 --> 02:40:34.460
Because earlier, I don't know if you heard of it,

02:40:34.460 --> 02:40:37.460
Stella was in the background at Loki's house making some noise.

02:40:37.460 --> 02:40:39.460
And the chatters could hear that.

02:40:39.460 --> 02:40:40.460
Yeah.

02:40:40.460 --> 02:40:42.460
Minda's fucked off somewhere.

02:40:42.460 --> 02:40:43.460
She's probably sleeping.

02:40:43.460 --> 02:40:45.460
Minda doesn't usually scream on cam though, right?

02:40:45.460 --> 02:40:46.460
I don't, at least I don't remember that.

02:40:46.460 --> 02:40:50.460
No, and she also, she also though has a very melodic meow.

02:40:50.460 --> 02:40:53.460
I like this comment in chat or question.

02:40:53.460 --> 02:40:55.460
Miltonius Games in chat says,

02:40:55.460 --> 02:40:58.460
I've been getting into novels set in video game universes,

02:40:58.460 --> 02:41:00.460
Warcraft, Halo, so forth.

02:41:00.460 --> 02:41:04.460
Have any of you ever gotten into any video game content

02:41:04.460 --> 02:41:07.460
set outside of the video game format,

02:41:07.460 --> 02:41:10.460
shows, comics, et cetera?

02:41:10.460 --> 02:41:12.460
I read a lot of those Warcraft books,

02:41:12.460 --> 02:41:14.460
the World of Warcraft ones that were,

02:41:14.460 --> 02:41:17.460
like I read Thrall and I read the,

02:41:17.460 --> 02:41:22.460
the fuck, what was the, the war with the well

02:41:22.460 --> 02:41:25.460
and fuck, why can't I think of the name?

02:41:25.460 --> 02:41:29.460
With, God, why can't I think Illidan and,

02:41:29.460 --> 02:41:32.460
and his brother and Illidan being stupid.

02:41:32.460 --> 02:41:33.460
I know what you're talking about.

02:41:33.460 --> 02:41:35.460
Is that the lead into cataclysm, right?

02:41:35.460 --> 02:41:39.460
No, this was like the lead into like the whole of everything.

02:41:39.460 --> 02:41:40.460
Oh, okay.

02:41:40.460 --> 02:41:43.460
When all the demons popped up and were stupid.

02:41:43.460 --> 02:41:46.460
And then I read the,

02:41:46.460 --> 02:41:49.460
the book with a holding,

02:41:49.460 --> 02:41:50.460
what's his face on trial.

02:41:50.460 --> 02:41:55.460
And I mostly read it because of Sylvanas,

02:41:57.460 --> 02:41:59.460
you know, meeting back up with her sister

02:41:59.460 --> 02:42:02.460
and talking about trying to kill what's his face.

02:42:02.460 --> 02:42:05.460
Oh, I can't remember his name either because I hated him.

02:42:05.460 --> 02:42:06.460
Everyone hated him during cataclysm.

02:42:06.460 --> 02:42:07.460
Garrosh?

02:42:07.460 --> 02:42:08.460
Yeah, Garrosh.

02:42:08.460 --> 02:42:09.460
Yeah.

02:42:09.460 --> 02:42:11.460
God, my brain is just not like working for names.

02:42:11.460 --> 02:42:12.460
That's okay.

02:42:12.460 --> 02:42:15.460
And I've, I mean, for other things,

02:42:15.460 --> 02:42:17.460
I've read some of the supernatural books.

02:42:17.460 --> 02:42:20.460
I've got some old Doctor Who books from the eighties.

02:42:20.460 --> 02:42:25.460
I've, I mean, gosh, I, I, when I get into a fandom,

02:42:25.460 --> 02:42:27.460
I get into a fandom.

02:42:27.460 --> 02:42:29.460
It's just like reading all those Star Wars books.

02:42:29.460 --> 02:42:31.460
I haven't read any of the older ones,

02:42:31.460 --> 02:42:34.460
but I've read the, some of the newer ones.

02:42:34.460 --> 02:42:38.460
I read the Phasma, Phasma book.

02:42:39.460 --> 02:42:41.460
I've read a few of the others.

02:42:41.460 --> 02:42:43.460
I want to read the Belea book.

02:42:43.460 --> 02:42:45.460
It's on, it's on my list.

02:42:45.460 --> 02:42:46.460
So, yeah.

02:42:46.460 --> 02:42:48.460
I have a couple of answers for this,

02:42:48.460 --> 02:42:50.460
as far as like games and other things.

02:42:50.460 --> 02:42:54.460
When Pokemon first came out, I used to love the anime,

02:42:54.460 --> 02:42:56.460
the original OG anime.

02:42:56.460 --> 02:42:57.460
I loved Pokemon.

02:42:57.460 --> 02:42:58.460
Of course, it was all the dubbed ones

02:42:58.460 --> 02:43:01.460
that we had here in the US, but still, I love that.

02:43:01.460 --> 02:43:03.460
What's that?

02:43:03.460 --> 02:43:05.460
It's a movie in Japanese, remember?

02:43:05.460 --> 02:43:07.460
Oh yeah, yeah, I remember that.

02:43:07.460 --> 02:43:08.460
Yeah, yeah.

02:43:08.460 --> 02:43:13.460
But the other thing was when I was really younger,

02:43:13.460 --> 02:43:16.460
and I don't know if people will remember these.

02:43:16.460 --> 02:43:19.460
Some people will, but they had these books that came out,

02:43:19.460 --> 02:43:21.460
and I could get them at like Walden Books or something,

02:43:21.460 --> 02:43:23.460
but they were the Worlds of Power books

02:43:23.460 --> 02:43:25.460
where they took video games, right?

02:43:25.460 --> 02:43:29.460
FX9, I think was the shadow name.

02:43:29.460 --> 02:43:31.460
That wasn't really the guy that wrote them

02:43:31.460 --> 02:43:32.460
because it's on Wikipedia,

02:43:32.460 --> 02:43:34.460
and it kind of gives the whole story

02:43:34.460 --> 02:43:36.460
that somebody else really wrote them under that name.

02:43:36.460 --> 02:43:39.460
But there were games, or excuse me, books

02:43:39.460 --> 02:43:42.460
based on things like Blaster Master had a book.

02:43:42.460 --> 02:43:44.460
I remember Simon's Quest had a book, which was weird

02:43:44.460 --> 02:43:47.460
because it was like you had an adventurer

02:43:47.460 --> 02:43:48.460
that was with Simon.

02:43:48.460 --> 02:43:51.460
Metal Gear had a decent book from what I remember too.

02:43:51.460 --> 02:43:53.460
They weren't giant books.

02:43:53.460 --> 02:43:55.460
They were young adult books.

02:43:55.460 --> 02:43:58.460
They were made for 12-year-old gamers,

02:43:58.460 --> 02:44:02.460
and they were only like yay thick and about 100 pages,

02:44:02.460 --> 02:44:04.460
so you could get through them pretty quickly.

02:44:04.460 --> 02:44:08.460
But they were good for somebody who at the time

02:44:08.460 --> 02:44:11.460
games were a very like nerd thing and very niche thing.

02:44:11.460 --> 02:44:13.460
It was kind of neat to see them cross over into books

02:44:13.460 --> 02:44:15.460
because you didn't see that a lot.

02:44:15.460 --> 02:44:17.460
Ninja Gaiden had one too.

02:44:17.460 --> 02:44:18.460
I remember that.

02:44:18.460 --> 02:44:19.460
That had a really good book.

02:44:19.460 --> 02:44:21.460
Actually, there's another series of books

02:44:21.460 --> 02:44:24.460
that I actually went out and found translations for.

02:44:24.460 --> 02:44:29.460
One of them was the Silent Hill 2 novelization.

02:44:29.460 --> 02:44:31.460
Oh, I didn't know it had one.

02:44:31.460 --> 02:44:33.460
Which was really freaking good.

02:44:34.460 --> 02:44:36.460
I have a PDF of it.

02:44:36.460 --> 02:44:38.460
And the Catherine books.

02:44:41.460 --> 02:44:44.460
Okay, you guys are lighting up our round table tonight.

02:44:44.460 --> 02:44:45.460
Hold on, I got to cut up all their comments,

02:44:45.460 --> 02:44:46.460
then we'll get to the last minute stories.

02:44:46.460 --> 02:44:50.460
SG100Matt says, dropping this GoFundMe in here

02:44:50.460 --> 02:44:53.460
for saving the New Jersey Arcade 8 on the break,

02:44:53.460 --> 02:44:56.460
which I've been to before, Rob Roberts approved,

02:44:56.460 --> 02:44:58.460
which is having a hard time paying off its taxes

02:44:58.460 --> 02:44:59.460
due to the pandemic.

02:44:59.460 --> 02:45:00.460
I think we all know.

02:45:00.460 --> 02:45:02.460
The break has been around for several decades

02:45:02.460 --> 02:45:04.460
and has become a staple in the music game community.

02:45:04.460 --> 02:45:06.460
Thankfully, it hit its initial goal,

02:45:06.460 --> 02:45:08.460
but the arcade is not reopening anytime soon

02:45:08.460 --> 02:45:10.460
because of the recent surge in cases.

02:45:10.460 --> 02:45:13.460
Any links to the GoFundMe, which is in chat

02:45:13.460 --> 02:45:15.460
for those of you participating live.

02:45:15.460 --> 02:45:16.460
If you're on the podcast feed,

02:45:16.460 --> 02:45:18.460
I'm sure if you just search for GoFundMe

02:45:18.460 --> 02:45:20.460
and on the break, you'll find it.

02:45:20.460 --> 02:45:22.460
But shout out for that.

02:45:22.460 --> 02:45:24.460
I'll link it on my Twitter.

02:45:24.460 --> 02:45:25.460
Thank you.

02:45:25.460 --> 02:45:28.460
Going to a tweet from Pixel Pacas,

02:45:28.460 --> 02:45:31.460
who tweets a saying, I'm sorry, not a tweet,

02:45:31.460 --> 02:45:34.460
a comment in chat, but DarkSakura just mentioned tweeting,

02:45:34.460 --> 02:45:35.460
so I got confused.

02:45:35.460 --> 02:45:37.460
Pixel Pacas says,

02:45:37.460 --> 02:45:40.460
have you folks attended any digital conventions yet?

02:45:40.460 --> 02:45:43.460
I felt like the concept was a bit silly,

02:45:43.460 --> 02:45:45.460
but just got out of FUJO CON,

02:45:45.460 --> 02:45:47.460
which is the YowieCon, basically,

02:45:47.460 --> 02:45:48.460
and it was so fun.

02:45:48.460 --> 02:45:52.460
They had academic panels, games on tabletop simulator,

02:45:52.460 --> 02:45:55.460
and themed fan meetups on Discord.

02:45:55.460 --> 02:45:59.460
Well, Bobby Blackwolf drops the cheap, obvious plug in there

02:45:59.460 --> 02:46:02.460
Vogg showed up at a digital convention this weekend,

02:46:02.460 --> 02:46:05.460
which sadly I mentioned earlier in the show,

02:46:05.460 --> 02:46:08.460
I've had some personal issues.

02:46:08.460 --> 02:46:10.460
I was hoping to contribute a video

02:46:10.460 --> 02:46:12.460
before those personal issues even popped up,

02:46:12.460 --> 02:46:15.460
but making videos is a lot of work.

02:46:15.460 --> 02:46:16.460
Bobby did a very good job on that,

02:46:16.460 --> 02:46:18.460
and I just had some conflicting priorities,

02:46:18.460 --> 02:46:21.460
especially with a lot going on in my day job leading up to that.

02:46:21.460 --> 02:46:23.460
But anyway, I had full on planned to,

02:46:23.460 --> 02:46:25.460
oh, I'm going to be there live when it debuts,

02:46:25.460 --> 02:46:26.460
and I'll participate as well.

02:46:26.460 --> 02:46:28.460
I'm sure Bobby and the rest of you understand

02:46:28.460 --> 02:46:30.460
why I didn't do that,

02:46:30.460 --> 02:46:33.460
but he did post the video early to our Discord

02:46:33.460 --> 02:46:36.460
over at voggnetwork.com slash Discord

02:46:36.460 --> 02:46:41.460
if you're a subscriber here at Vogg Network on Twitch,

02:46:41.460 --> 02:46:43.460
and you have your Discord link to Twitch.

02:46:43.460 --> 02:46:44.460
That's very important.

02:46:44.460 --> 02:46:46.460
If both those things are true,

02:46:46.460 --> 02:46:49.460
then you get access to a super secret subscriber chat.

02:46:49.460 --> 02:46:51.460
We don't fill it up a lot,

02:46:51.460 --> 02:46:54.460
but a couple weeks ago before the new stuff showed up at OLR,

02:46:54.460 --> 02:46:57.460
I posted some sneak peeks of the new stuff at OLR,

02:46:57.460 --> 02:47:00.460
and then Bobby posted his panel early for people to see.

02:47:00.460 --> 02:47:02.460
So technically, Vogg Network was a part of that,

02:47:02.460 --> 02:47:05.460
but because of my personal situations,

02:47:05.460 --> 02:47:07.460
I did not participate with that convention.

02:47:07.460 --> 02:47:11.460
I did a professional convention for work.

02:47:11.460 --> 02:47:13.460
Work paid for me to go to a virtual convention,

02:47:13.460 --> 02:47:18.460
which had a lot of on-demand seminars for the field that I'm in,

02:47:18.460 --> 02:47:20.460
and I thought it was pretty cool.

02:47:20.460 --> 02:47:21.460
Very informative talks.

02:47:21.460 --> 02:47:23.460
There were things you could go to live.

02:47:23.460 --> 02:47:26.460
You could ask questions and interact with the speakers,

02:47:26.460 --> 02:47:29.460
which for my industry was very good for learning and so forth.

02:47:29.460 --> 02:47:31.460
What I also thought was really interesting

02:47:31.460 --> 02:47:36.460
was that they had this section that was like these roundtables,

02:47:36.460 --> 02:47:37.460
and you could sign up and say,

02:47:37.460 --> 02:47:40.460
I want to have a roundtable session on this,

02:47:40.460 --> 02:47:44.460
and then up to five other people could come sit at your table,

02:47:44.460 --> 02:47:47.460
and then it would be like, go to this Zoom chat,

02:47:47.460 --> 02:47:50.460
and now you can have a roundtable chat on this particular thing.

02:47:50.460 --> 02:47:52.460
And I thought that was really cool,

02:47:52.460 --> 02:47:54.460
because this company that was putting it on,

02:47:54.460 --> 02:47:57.460
I think has done virtual shows before, and it shows,

02:47:57.460 --> 02:47:59.460
because they had a lot of interesting ideas like that.

02:47:59.460 --> 02:48:01.460
So I thought that was pretty cool.

02:48:01.460 --> 02:48:04.460
I full-on plan on doing DragonCon virtually,

02:48:04.460 --> 02:48:06.460
because I'm sure as many of you know,

02:48:06.460 --> 02:48:09.460
DragonCon was officially canceled this week,

02:48:09.460 --> 02:48:14.460
which is sad, but at the same time is necessary.

02:48:14.460 --> 02:48:18.460
So I'm sad to see it not happen, but I think it's pretty cool.

02:48:18.460 --> 02:48:19.460
They're going to be doing a virtual one,

02:48:19.460 --> 02:48:21.460
and I full-on intend to participate.

02:48:21.460 --> 02:48:25.460
I hope I'll be asked to participate as a panelist on one of the tracks,

02:48:25.460 --> 02:48:28.460
but I realize they're going to have a limited amount of space.

02:48:28.460 --> 02:48:32.460
It's not going to be as flowing as the convention itself is,

02:48:32.460 --> 02:48:36.460
so I'll be happy just to participate with that whole thing.

02:48:36.460 --> 02:48:39.460
So, yeah.

02:48:39.460 --> 02:48:42.460
SheHulk10 is pointing out KaijuCon going on right now,

02:48:42.460 --> 02:48:44.460
heading there after the show.

02:48:44.460 --> 02:48:48.460
Bobby linked his panel there.

02:48:48.460 --> 02:48:51.460
Let's see. Oh, yeah, it's available to all.

02:48:51.460 --> 02:48:54.460
Bobby says, yeah, I don't like doing pre-recorded material.

02:48:54.460 --> 02:49:01.460
I have been wanting to for a while get into more video-on-demand type of stuff,

02:49:01.460 --> 02:49:04.460
but obviously it's kind of getting over the mountain of,

02:49:04.460 --> 02:49:06.460
I don't have the time.

02:49:06.460 --> 02:49:08.460
I'm really trying to make time,

02:49:08.460 --> 02:49:10.460
but obviously some of these scenarios that keep coming up

02:49:10.460 --> 02:49:14.460
are pushing me back a little bit.

02:49:14.460 --> 02:49:17.460
But I'm going to try and do a little more of that type of stuff,

02:49:17.460 --> 02:49:19.460
so we'll see.

02:49:19.460 --> 02:49:21.460
That video he did was almost an hour.

02:49:21.460 --> 02:49:22.460
That's a lot of content.

02:49:22.460 --> 02:49:24.460
That's very, very good.

02:49:24.460 --> 02:49:26.460
All right.

02:49:26.460 --> 02:49:28.460
Anyhow, let's get into some last-minute stories.

02:49:28.460 --> 02:49:30.460
Loki, I don't know if you have anything for us here.

02:49:30.460 --> 02:49:31.460
I have one.

02:49:31.460 --> 02:49:32.460
Oh, do you?

02:49:32.460 --> 02:49:33.460
Then why not Dark Soccer first?

02:49:33.460 --> 02:49:34.460
Go ahead.

02:49:34.460 --> 02:49:35.460
Okay.

02:49:35.460 --> 02:49:38.460
This looks like something that was more recently related.

02:49:38.460 --> 02:49:40.460
I actually just found the article on this one.

02:49:40.460 --> 02:49:45.460
Sony has a patent now hinting to cloud-based backwards compatibility.

02:49:45.460 --> 02:49:47.460
I don't know if that's old news or what,

02:49:47.460 --> 02:49:51.460
but I'm looking at these patent drawings, and it's pretty interesting.

02:49:51.460 --> 02:49:55.460
No, but I'd heard this rumor that that's how they were going to do it,

02:49:55.460 --> 02:49:59.460
so this patent just seems to kind of light up that rumor a little more.

02:49:59.460 --> 02:50:05.460
Yeah, and the patent appeared on Japan's platform for patent information website.

02:50:05.460 --> 02:50:09.460
It was filed on July 2nd, and of course it is in Japanese,

02:50:09.460 --> 02:50:13.460
but there is a comment on it translated.

02:50:13.460 --> 02:50:17.460
Another trend growing in this industry relates to the development of cloud-based gaming systems.

02:50:17.460 --> 02:50:20.460
Such a system may include a remote processing server

02:50:20.460 --> 02:50:24.460
that is configured to execute a game application, receive input from a user,

02:50:24.460 --> 02:50:29.460
and communicate with a local thin client configured to display an image on a display,

02:50:29.460 --> 02:50:36.460
meaning that it's got an illustration of a user climbing a step

02:50:36.460 --> 02:50:40.460
to get to a different type of gaming system.

02:50:40.460 --> 02:50:49.460
The illustration they have on here shows a PS3, because it looks like a Foreman grill.

02:50:49.460 --> 02:50:54.460
And so in another image, it's basically showing the various input selects

02:50:54.460 --> 02:50:57.460
with all the models of PlayStation going back to the first one,

02:50:57.460 --> 02:51:02.460
and then going on to another readout for the display

02:51:02.460 --> 02:51:05.460
where you can pick the games pertaining to that particular system.

02:51:06.460 --> 02:51:16.460
And there's also, of course, a little blank box on there where the PS4 would go.

02:51:16.460 --> 02:51:22.460
And so it's sort of hinting that this is going to be

02:51:22.460 --> 02:51:26.460
since the fact that PS5 will support the top 100 PS4 games,

02:51:26.460 --> 02:51:31.460
and that all of the new PS4 games after July are certified to be PS5 compatible.

02:51:32.460 --> 02:51:36.460
So that could be a thing.

02:51:36.460 --> 02:51:41.460
That part, I know, had been discussed before about the whole games after a certain point.

02:51:41.460 --> 02:51:48.460
That's making me think that that's why there's no icon.

02:51:48.460 --> 02:51:53.460
I mean, it's literally like a cutout square with little dashes around it

02:51:53.460 --> 02:51:56.460
that don't show anything for PS4.

02:51:56.460 --> 02:52:02.460
So I guess that's maybe a placeholder for working on backwards compatibility

02:52:02.460 --> 02:52:05.460
for some of the earlier PS4 games, who knows?

02:52:05.460 --> 02:52:10.460
By the way, and I don't know if this is something Loki had planned for Last Minute Stories, sorry,

02:52:10.460 --> 02:52:15.460
but on a tangent, we didn't talk about it this week,

02:52:15.460 --> 02:52:20.460
but the PlayStation 5 box art was released, like what the games are going to look like.

02:52:20.460 --> 02:52:22.460
It looks like a game.

02:52:22.460 --> 02:52:27.460
It's the PlayStation 4 box in new colors, which, you know,

02:52:27.460 --> 02:52:29.460
I know there's a lot of negativity on the internet about that,

02:52:29.460 --> 02:52:34.460
but I'm like, honestly, the PlayStation 4 box was the PlayStation 3 box in different colors.

02:52:34.460 --> 02:52:36.460
So it's not...

02:52:36.460 --> 02:52:40.460
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

02:52:40.460 --> 02:52:45.460
The PlayStation 3 ones are black, the PlayStation 4 ones are blue,

02:52:45.460 --> 02:52:47.460
and now the PlayStation 5 ones will be white.

02:52:47.460 --> 02:52:50.460
And you will be able to see them when they're sitting on the shelf.

02:52:50.460 --> 02:52:52.460
And fine, great.

02:52:52.460 --> 02:53:00.460
For those who are in chat, I'm actually linking a picture of that menu translation,

02:53:00.460 --> 02:53:04.460
so I thought it was really interesting.

02:53:04.460 --> 02:53:06.460
It's out there.

02:53:06.460 --> 02:53:15.460
If people want to find the information, you'll just want to go to look up the Japanese patent website,

02:53:15.460 --> 02:53:17.460
and it'll be on there.

02:53:17.460 --> 02:53:18.460
All right.

02:53:18.460 --> 02:53:20.460
Well, if that's it for Dark Sakura...

02:53:20.460 --> 02:53:22.460
I have another.

02:53:22.460 --> 02:53:24.460
Oh, wow. Go for it.

02:53:24.460 --> 02:53:29.460
Sony is delaying the Monster Hunter movie until 2021.

02:53:29.460 --> 02:53:31.460
Sorry, 2021.

02:53:31.460 --> 02:53:33.460
I forgot that it's even coming out.

02:53:33.460 --> 02:53:37.460
Yeah, it's set to release April 23rd, 2021,

02:53:37.460 --> 02:53:44.460
and it's going to have some Resident Evil people in it, like Mila.

02:53:44.460 --> 02:53:46.460
Because same director.

02:53:46.460 --> 02:53:47.460
Yeah.

02:53:47.460 --> 02:53:52.460
And she's kind of pissed about them trying to reboot Resident Evil, just saying.

02:53:52.460 --> 02:53:56.460
Probably because she wasn't asked to be in it, and that's always a little bit...

02:53:56.460 --> 02:53:57.460
Probably.

02:53:57.460 --> 02:53:58.460
Yeah.

02:53:58.460 --> 02:54:03.460
It kind of stings when you are not asked to be in the reboot of something, but sometimes...

02:54:03.460 --> 02:54:05.460
Maybe it'll be more like the games.

02:54:05.460 --> 02:54:06.460
You know what, though?

02:54:06.460 --> 02:54:08.460
But you look at the reboot they're doing for Candyman,

02:54:08.460 --> 02:54:10.460
and obviously all we've seen is that trailer.

02:54:10.460 --> 02:54:14.460
The movie should have been out by now, and I'm not big on how I feel about horror movies,

02:54:14.460 --> 02:54:16.460
but Candyman's kind of cool, and I do love the fact...

02:54:16.460 --> 02:54:18.460
Yeah, that looks so badass.

02:54:18.460 --> 02:54:24.460
The new one has the guy that used to play Candyman in it, still.

02:54:24.460 --> 02:54:26.460
I think that Tony Todd, right?

02:54:26.460 --> 02:54:27.460
Yeah, I think that's awesome.

02:54:27.460 --> 02:54:29.460
I think that's awesome, too.

02:54:29.460 --> 02:54:32.460
And isn't it produced by Jordan Peele?

02:54:32.460 --> 02:54:35.460
I think he's a producer, yeah, but I don't think he wrote it or anything.

02:54:35.460 --> 02:54:37.460
But yeah, he's a producer.

02:54:37.460 --> 02:54:40.460
But yeah, if he's going to put his money behind it, it's got to have some quality.

02:54:40.460 --> 02:54:43.460
True, true. And the trailer was great.

02:54:43.460 --> 02:54:46.460
Oh, yeah. I will do that.

02:54:46.460 --> 02:54:52.460
I'm trying to think of other things where the talent was or was not asked to be a part of it.

02:54:52.460 --> 02:54:57.460
Somebody was just commenting on it recently that they were kind of hurt, that they weren't asked to be in it,

02:54:57.460 --> 02:54:59.460
but they were glad to see that it was still going.

02:54:59.460 --> 02:55:01.460
I can't remember what it was.

02:55:01.460 --> 02:55:07.460
Sorry, I know that makes for a terrible story, but there's things like that that come up once in a while.

02:55:07.460 --> 02:55:09.460
That's it for me.

02:55:09.460 --> 02:55:15.460
DJ Rama S talking about the Resident Evil saying the reboot is supposed to be a lot closer to the games.

02:55:15.460 --> 02:55:18.460
And I think Silent Hill, they were talking about possibly doing that, too,

02:55:18.460 --> 02:55:21.460
but I think that's really, really rumor, great assault type of thing.

02:55:21.460 --> 02:55:25.460
All right. Well, I don't think Loki had any last minute stories if I heard them right,

02:55:25.460 --> 02:55:29.460
so I think we're about the time to wrap up the show.

02:55:29.460 --> 02:55:34.460
Thank you guys so much for participating with our show tonight and listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:55:34.460 --> 02:55:36.460
Whether you were here live or on our podcast feed,

02:55:36.460 --> 02:55:40.460
we really appreciate you guys sitting down with us every week and spending, you know,

02:55:40.460 --> 02:55:44.460
if you've gotten this far in the show, that means you've made it close to three hours with us.

02:55:44.460 --> 02:55:50.460
So I hope we made your day go by a little faster, whether you're working at home or out exercising outdoors

02:55:50.460 --> 02:55:55.460
or maybe in the workplace taking precautions because I know not everybody can work from home right now.

02:55:55.460 --> 02:55:58.460
I hope we're making your day go by a little bit quicker.

02:55:58.460 --> 02:56:00.460
And thank you so much for making us a part of your week.

02:56:00.460 --> 02:56:02.460
Really, really appreciate it.

02:56:02.460 --> 02:56:04.460
We'll be back in seven days to do it all again.

02:56:04.460 --> 02:56:08.460
Obviously, we've been getting kind of the trickle of announcements that would have been at E3.

02:56:08.460 --> 02:56:10.460
We're kind of getting that trickle through the coming weeks.

02:56:10.460 --> 02:56:13.460
And in a couple of weeks, we're going to get a lot of news about the Xbox.

02:56:13.460 --> 02:56:17.460
So that's going to be very, very exciting.

02:56:17.460 --> 02:56:20.460
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend.

02:56:20.460 --> 02:56:23.460
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:56:23.460 --> 02:56:28.460
But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, yikes, then we don't have anything.

02:56:28.460 --> 02:56:32.460
So a nice five-star review wherever you found this show, like iTunes,

02:56:32.460 --> 02:56:36.460
or just recommending us by sharing a link to our page on Spotify or what have you,

02:56:36.460 --> 02:56:38.460
that goes an awful long way.

02:56:38.460 --> 02:56:41.460
So thank you, thank you so much to everybody that helps us spread the word.

02:56:41.460 --> 02:56:44.460
With that, it's time to get into final thoughts.

02:56:44.460 --> 02:56:46.460
I'll start tonight.

02:56:46.460 --> 02:56:53.460
My final thought is I'm going to play more of that cross code or the game whose name I can't remember,

02:56:53.460 --> 02:56:57.460
but it's a good game and it's a good throwback to Super Nintendo stuff.

02:56:57.460 --> 02:56:59.460
So I'm going to play some more of that this week.

02:56:59.460 --> 02:57:05.460
And I'm going to play Elliot's Jam Game and probably lots of other stuff this week too.

02:57:05.460 --> 02:57:10.460
As much as quarantine sucks and I miss interacting with real people,

02:57:10.460 --> 02:57:16.460
I miss my weekend trips to San Francisco, I miss my nights out downtown,

02:57:16.460 --> 02:57:19.460
it's given me a chance to play a lot of video games.

02:57:19.460 --> 02:57:21.460
So I'll be doing that.

02:57:21.460 --> 02:57:23.460
Loki, how about you?

02:57:23.460 --> 02:57:30.460
Well, it's just going to be working this week and maybe I'll get some game dev time in there as well.

02:57:30.460 --> 02:57:31.460
We'll see.

02:57:31.460 --> 02:57:36.460
And last but certainly not least, here for the whole show tonight, Dark Soccer, your final thought.

02:57:38.460 --> 02:57:40.460
Your unmuted final thought, please.

02:57:40.460 --> 02:57:41.460
Sorry.

02:57:41.460 --> 02:57:42.460
It's okay.

02:57:42.460 --> 02:57:46.460
Eight weeks total and I'm not going to be doing this again anytime soon because it's hot.

02:57:47.460 --> 02:57:51.460
And I have been sitting here smelling the pizza that Dan ordered that arrived

02:57:51.460 --> 02:57:54.460
right after the start of the show, and I have not eaten any of it.

02:57:54.460 --> 02:57:56.460
Girl, just turn your cam off and go to town.

02:57:56.460 --> 02:57:58.460
No, I'm a professional bitch.

02:57:58.460 --> 02:57:59.460
I appreciate it.

02:57:59.460 --> 02:58:00.460
We know.

02:58:00.460 --> 02:58:01.460
Let me mean it.

02:58:01.460 --> 02:58:04.460
No, I'm going to.

02:58:04.460 --> 02:58:05.460
Oh, okay.

02:58:05.460 --> 02:58:09.460
So what is the average airspeed of an unladen swallow?

02:58:09.460 --> 02:58:12.460
And Brad from Pod Culture beat me to it.

02:58:12.460 --> 02:58:15.460
African or European.

02:58:15.460 --> 02:58:16.460
All right.

02:58:16.460 --> 02:58:17.460
Anything else?

02:58:17.460 --> 02:58:20.460
All right.

02:58:20.460 --> 02:58:22.460
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:58:22.460 --> 02:58:23.460
Happy gaming this week.

02:58:23.460 --> 02:58:26.460
We will see you in seven days when we do this all again.

02:58:26.460 --> 02:58:29.460
Thanks again for being part of the family here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:58:29.460 --> 02:58:30.460
We appreciate you guys so much.

02:58:30.460 --> 02:58:33.460
And all these wigs are just for you.

02:58:33.460 --> 02:58:34.460
Good night, everybody.

02:58:34.460 --> 02:58:38.460
And trust me, I got another 20 I hadn't pulled out yet.

02:58:38.460 --> 02:58:40.460
Something to tune in for next week.

02:58:40.460 --> 02:58:41.460
Bye, guys.

02:58:41.460 --> 02:58:42.460
No.
