9600	15200	Government and private sector clashes are all but inevitable, and the difference between the physical and digital mediums blurred even further.
15200	20700	Where the army previously maintained an online game serving as an interactive means of evaluating individuals for military service,
20700	24500	this year saw the attempt at soliciting by the power of personality and mock giveaways.
24500	28500	This latest experiment was short-lived as people exercised their constitutional rights.
28500	34700	It's another week in the wide world of gaming as your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki bring you this and the rest of the week's gaming news,
34700	37300	starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
37300	40600	Music
40600	47800	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47800	61600	It is Orange Lounge Radio back yet again with episode number 829 of our program for this July the, what date are we on here?
61600	67300	I lost the 26th, thank you, July 26th of 2020.
67300	74300	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
74300	75200	Hey.
75200	76900	Hi, how are you?
76900	81500	I'm all new and all different and on pain meds.
81500	84400	Yes, you are, you are looking lovely over there.
84400	86900	Thank you very, thank you, thank you.
86900	93300	People seem to like my black wig from the other week, so I have a different black wig this week that I like better.
93300	95900	With the black flower, you can't really see it because it's black.
95900	96600	Uh-huh.
96600	105400	Sorry guys, if you're watching, sorry guys, if you're watching on Twitch because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern at The Voice Geeks Network,
105400	115400	twitch.tv slash vog network, and if you are watching, I'm changing some shots on the fly here because I thought I made, there we go, that's the shot I wanted.
115400	116400	There we go.
116400	120700	I made a new little layer there and it fell all the way to the bottom of my list and I was like, where did it go?
120700	121400	I can't find it.
121400	124400	Okay, now I can see the episode number and everything like I usually can.
124400	125400	Phew.
125400	130800	That's the fun of doing a live show is that sometimes you have technical difficulties and things that happen.
130800	135600	So come watch us be a train wreck live and you also get to see Dark Sockra's wig.
137600	138100	All right.
138100	141600	Uh, also say hello to, and expensive makeup, you know, I could do that.
141600	142300	Yes, of course.
142300	145100	Uh, also say, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
145900	146600	Hey, how's it going?
147000	147500	Hey, good.
147500	148000	How are you?
149000	150000	Pretty good.
150000	155000	So I see tonight the selection for your virtual background is some, uh, Katamari Damacy?
155700	157200	Yeah, cause I couldn't think of anything else.
157400	158200	That's what, you know what?
158200	159400	There's no problem with Katamari.
159500	160800	Katamari is always a good thing, I think.
161700	161900	Yeah.
161900	162100	All right.
162600	166700	Now those of you that are watching on Twitch are probably like, wait a minute, things look a little different.
166700	167800	There's another person there.
167800	168800	What's going on?
169100	169500	Yes.
169500	178400	So the whole reason why I've got like new layers and shots on and things on Twitch is because I wanted to invite on a guest host to kind of join us at the beginning of tonight's show.
178700	180400	And, uh, he's been on the show before.
180400	181800	It's been a little while though.
181900	184800	So say hello everybody to Mr.
184800	186800	Video game realness or Delvin.
187700	188300	Hey everyone.
188300	189000	How's it going?
189100	190100	Hey, I'm great.
190100	190700	How are you doing?
191500	192200	Wonderful.
192200	192900	Fantastic.
193300	194900	Happy to be on the show again.
194900	195300	Yeah.
195300	195800	Virtually.
196000	196400	Yeah.
196400	202200	Uh, congrats on being, I guess our first like virtual host of sorts, uh, being here at the top of the show with us.
202500	202900	Woo.
202900	203300	Yeah.
204900	209000	Uh, and I see some, uh, comments in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.
209000	211400	DJ Rama S says here comes a new podcaster.
211500	213300	Fifth dream says virtual guests.
213300	213600	Yes.
213800	214800	Well, here's the thing.
214800	221200	So I want to get into tonight's show because of course we do talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle every week here on OLR.
221500	226200	And Delvin, you and I are in a chat with some other gamers, G A Y M E R S.
226500	232100	And, uh, you kind of brought up a topic that I thought was really, really interesting.
232100	239700	And I was like, well, I want to talk about that on OLR, but like, I'd be kind of a Dick if I stole my friend's topic and then didn't invite him on the show to like share his feelings.
239700	240700	So here we are.
242100	243900	So, well, I'm, I'm happy to share.
244000	244200	All right.
244200	244500	Yes.
244500	249200	So tell us, tell us a little bit about this thought that you had that you were sharing with others in a chat room.
250400	271400	Well, it's just that, um, you know, I've been reading comments in multiple, you know, videos, game, uh, groups and things like that, which of course one should never read comments, but you know, the general consensus of what's been shown for both Sony and been shown for Xbox.
271800	275400	Is that, you know, well, they didn't show anything that was next gen.
275800	276200	Right.
276200	280100	And, you know, it's really made me think of this conversation.
280100	290900	Well, what is next gen, you know, what is the next generation and it's not following the regular format of previous generations.
291000	297100	Um, you know, Nintendo's already essentially started its next generation with the switch.
297500	303700	Uh, you know, Sony's paving its traditional path of a new system, throw out the old one.
304000	316800	And then there's Microsoft here with this new blurring of the lines and creating a new space, uh, kind of a hybrid of console and PC.
317200	317500	Right.
317500	322500	And we're going to get into talking a little bit about the Xbox showcase in a little bit, and I hope you'll stay with us to talk about that.
322500	324100	Cause I know you probably have some feelings on that.
324500	334600	But, um, you're, I can say that one big takeaway I had from the Xbox game showcase was that dang, you guys game pass, that's a deal.
334600	336300	Like the whole thing really read to me.
336300	338900	It's like a giant infomercial for game pass.
338900	349500	I don't know how you guys felt, but I felt like it wasn't really selling us an Xbox series X as much as it was selling us on the notion of, Hey y'all Microsoft makes video games.
349600	356700	And if you subscribe to their subscription service, you can play all these games the day they launch and you don't have to pay like $60 per game anymore.
356900	359300	Like that's kind of what I took away from it.
359300	361200	And I don't think that, I don't think that's a bad thing.
361200	366600	And I don't necessarily think Microsoft thinks that's a bad thing because they set the stage several times.
366700	367700	We're showing games.
367900	369900	We're not showing Xbox series X.
370300	374900	We know we're going to be getting another thing in August or maybe later on.
374900	383100	That's probably going to set the stage better as to why do you need Xbox series X specifically now you also know the games.
383200	389400	So, so yeah, so I, it's a kind of follow your comment about like Microsoft's kind of blurring the lines.
389600	390200	You're right.
390200	392900	They didn't try to sell me a series X this week.
392900	396500	I feel like they tried to sell me game pass, which is a different way of thinking about it.
397700	398000	Yeah.
398300	413500	And, um, you know, some of the other comments that, um, Some people have had is like, you know, well, I don't, I don't need to get an, a series X because, um, well, there's nothing exclusive for the series X coming out for the first couple of years.
413500	414400	So I don't need a series X.
414400	415700	I'll just stick with my Xbox.
416200	424600	And, you know, a lot of people are saying it and not really even hearing themselves and what they're saying that, you know, they're saying it as like, it's a bad thing.
424600	428000	Like, I, I, I, I'm not going to buy the new console.
428000	429800	I'm just going to play the games on my old console.
429800	432400	And it's like, that's what Microsoft wants you to do.
433800	434200	Right.
434200	446000	They, you know, they want to create this, uh, new path where you don't throw away your old system just because the new one has come out and, you know, that's something that PC gaming has had.
446600	452400	You know, no, you know, just, just because a new game comes out, um, doesn't mean that you need a new PC.
452400	461100	Uh, you may not be able to play it at its full capability, but you're able to play it maybe on the lowest settings and maybe that's okay for some people.
461100	470200	And some people want, you know, uh, Nvidia 28, 2080 TI highest graphic capability video card.
470200	470500	Right.
471000	481200	Which, which is fine because this is what PC gaming, when I say PC, I mean, Mac as well, because also phone gaming, you know, this has been the, the way those things have worked forever.
481200	481500	Right.
481500	484100	Like obviously I'm a huge fan of Pokemon go.
484100	484400	Right.
484400	493600	I talked about that game an awful lot, and I think we all generally know, like Pokemon go works really, really well on the newest iPhone and the newest Android.
494000	499600	It'll run on an iPhone six or, you know, the, the Android equivalent from those years.
499700	501000	It'll run on those things.
501000	502100	Does it run as well?
503400	505000	Does it do the AR stuff?
506000	511000	You know, but you still pretty much get the same experience.
511000	514500	For the most part, but it does work better on the newer technology.
514500	519500	And now we're seeing that with consoles, which is very disruptive because we're not used to that.
519800	527600	Like we're very used to thinking of the next generation of gaming as more teraflops, right?
527600	530100	More, more bites, more bits, right?
530100	530800	It's eight bit.
530800	531800	No, it's 16 bit.
531900	533800	No, it's 32 kind of bit.
533800	535800	32 X it's, it's 64 bit.
535900	536900	What do you call it?
536900	537400	Dreamcast?
537400	538300	Is that 128?
538300	539900	I don't know, but it's more, you know.
541400	541600	Yeah.
541600	564500	And I also think that in terms of, you know, console gaming as it is, we've kind of really, we're hitting a plateau in terms of what, you know, you know, when you think of the, the generational leap from PlayStation one to PlayStation two, more graphics, you know, and then PlayStation two to three more graphics, three to four more graphics.
564800	572500	We're kind of hitting a plateau in terms of how much further we can go graphically to wow people into buying games.
572600	576700	Well, look at the reception to the new halo game, right?
576700	590800	Not to get too ahead of ourselves, but I think we can generally talk about that, that halo game actually received some kind of negative critiques online for looking like an old generation game for looking like something that we could have played on an Xbox three 60.
590800	594200	I guess I didn't, I didn't walk away with those same feelings.
594200	605800	I wasn't quite as critical, you know, the YouTubers went in there and analyzed every frame and was like, well, you see here at eight minutes and 43 seconds on the 23rd frame, you can see some texture popping in here.
605800	607800	And this is proof that Microsoft is a fraud.
611500	614600	Watch my three hour YouTube analysis, breaking this down.
614800	616600	You're laughing cause it's fucking true.
617000	617300	Yeah.
617300	617800	Yes.
617800	618300	That's right.
618500	619900	That's a hundred percent why I'm laughing.
621400	624000	But, um, but yeah, I'd be like, I, to me.
624000	625500	I didn't walk away with such a negative feeling.
625500	628300	I kind of looked at that when, oh yeah, it looks, it looks pretty.
628300	631000	Um, yeah, I could probably play this on Xbox one.
631000	633600	Maybe it'll just not be quite as smooth, but it'll be fine.
633600	634800	But I like that.
634800	641500	It kind of looks like the old halo and you know, back when I was really into the series in the first couple of games and so forth, that's kind of what I took from it.
641800	647900	But I, and the reason why I bring all that up is because like Delvin, you're saying people are used to, it's gotta be bigger.
647900	648700	It's gotta be faster.
648700	650100	It's gotta be more powerful.
650500	655300	But some would say that Microsoft did not rise to that when they showed the new halo.
655500	657000	Does that mean they're a flop?
657600	659000	That's a hard no for me.
659000	662000	I think they still did a very good job with that conference.
663000	668800	Well, I think again, I think it comes down to what people are traditionally accustomed to.
669200	688900	And I think we've, we, as console gamers have been accustomed to new system, better graphics, more flops, you know, Ray tracing, uh, four K 60 F like we've become accustomed to things are going to look visually better the next time around.
689300	694000	But I think what Microsoft really has done here and, and it's taken a page out of Nintendo's book.
694700	696700	That has shown, you know what?
696700	703000	You can make a console that isn't as graphically capable and it sells a ton.
703000	716500	Let's take a look at the, we let's take a look at the Nintendo 3DS versus the Vita and now the switch versus both consoles, you know, well, not that they're not that the switches outside the PS4, but it's selling really well.
716500	720100	So I think that, you know, again, Microsoft is.
721300	722900	In the, in the respect to halo.
722900	731500	Um, kind of taking that, that page where it's like, let's just make the game really good and, you know, market, um, game pass.
732700	738800	And, and have that option for people who want to have better graphics to get the series X to play on their PC and things like that.
739100	739300	Yeah.
739900	742700	I'm going to chat over at Twitch TV slash Vaga network.
742700	750800	Uh, she Hulk 10 says we are kind of at the end of technology game as end of technology game graphic wise, at least.
750800	751000	Yeah.
751000	756600	For now, you know, we, we've had a long running joke here on OLR that everything is one step closer to the holodeck, right?
756600	758500	Everything in gaming is one step closer to the holiday.
758700	761900	And I kind of think for now we've hit as far as we can go.
762100	765800	Where, yes, there is literal holographic technology and things out there.
765800	772000	And one could say, Oh, VR or HoloLens, but you know what, for whatever reason, gaming is not going there right now.
772000	773400	Maybe in 10 years as well.
773800	775400	I, I, I'm getting ahead of myself.
775500	779900	I don't necessarily mean that with VR because obviously the PlayStation VR has done very well.
780100	784500	Um, but I'm, my mind is going like HoloLens and the literal interpretation of like the holodeck.
784800	787200	Obviously I think we've kind of like hit a limit here.
787600	795500	So anyway, um, back to what we're like really talking about is that, yeah, we've kind of hit like this plateau with graphics and so forth.
795500	799900	So, and I guess this is a question for everybody, for the chat room, for you guys.
800500	803700	What is the next generation of gaming?
803800	815000	What do we expect from the next generation of gaming now that graphics and sound and all that we, we kind of reasonably believe we've hit our limits?
815300	817400	So what is the next generation of gaming?
817400	819100	And, and Delvin, I'll pick on you first.
819100	820500	Cause you brought this topic to us.
821500	836300	Well, I think, um, I think everyone is kind of paving their own path, um, in terms of the big three, so to speak, uh, Nintendo has already, you know, dipped out of the, you know, console generational race.
836600	845300	Uh, you know, they've just, they've shown that they can't compete in the same space in a Sony Microsoft world.
845300	847200	So they dipped out, they created their own space.
847700	855100	They've created now this hybrid home portable system, um, where they're more focused on just making good games.
855100	856600	So they've created their own space.
857000	863100	And I think that Sony and Microsoft, you know, previous generation were, you know, battling it out.
863600	865300	And I think Microsoft just realized, you know what?
866200	876700	This is pointless fighting for, you know, because I think we were getting to a point where it was just fighting for third party, um, games.
876800	886600	Getting windows of exclusivity, you know, and then, you know, trying to sell your, your first party games to lure people over to your console.
886600	888800	But at the end of the day, most people were going to three.
889000	890500	So I think Microsoft was just like, you know what?
890500	891900	This is just not working.
891900	902900	And so, so now they're creating their own path there where, uh, quite frankly, I don't even think their next console, their next offering is a series X.
903100	904500	They're selling you game pass.
905100	909400	Game pass is their next, um, generational leap.
909800	911200	Um, they're offering you a service.
911200	916800	They're offering you a way to play next gen games, however you choose.
916800	920900	And I think X cloud will tie into that down the road and things like that.
921200	924000	And then Sony's just going the traditional route because they're like, you know what?
924000	925100	It works for us.
926100	930600	We get all the big third party games, so they're just going to continue that.
930700	936700	And I think this generation will really show which method works.
937500	947200	Uh, and let me, let me call on my, uh, other co-hosts because, um, you know, I'm, I'm curious what you guys think and that there is no right answer to this because it's, what is the next gen for you?
947200	948900	What is this next generation games for you?
949100	949700	Dark soccer.
949700	955200	I, I'm going to pick on you cause I'm dying to know your opinion, especially because you're kind of the retro queen here on OLR.
955200	959500	You know, you are a very knowledgeable on the retro and you come from.
959800	961000	Well, you know what, you know what I mean?
961000	968100	Like your, your mindset and a lot of the games that you play are in that, you know, when games were more bits and more things like that.
968100	970100	And we were, so I'm very curious for you.
970100	973700	What the next generation, no, I'm not calling you old.
973700	977600	I'm calling you well educated on your gaming history.
978300	985900	So, and a little old, so, seriously, but I can never tell because of your fierce makeup job.
986100	988600	No, but what, what's, what's the next gen of gaming for you?
989600	996500	Um, the next, what would truly be a next generation would have to be a true evolution.
997300	1003900	It would have to go beyond the standard console, new console that does this, new console that does that.
1003900	1007000	You know, they need to do something.
1007900	1009500	I need to not elbow my mute button.
1010000	1014800	They need to do something that is a true innovation.
1015200	1022000	They need to take something that people will not expect and bring it into the modern age.
1022200	1030900	I don't think it's going to be anything like, like bringing a hologram, holograms into our home or anything crazy like that or another console.
1030900	1037400	That's just gonna, you know, like I said before, I do do, oh, it's got 50 bajillion teraflops of floppiness.
1038000	1045400	You know, I think that it's time to take number one, to get back to what makes games good.
1046200	1054200	And then number two, to find an innovative way to distribute them that is unexpected.
1055500	1059400	You have to, it's not just a matter of surprise.
1059400	1061100	It's a matter of delight.
1061800	1066300	You have to bring about this enthusiasm in people.
1066300	1074400	It's this, basically for all of us older gamers, especially, you need to bring back the joy of our childhood with this.
1074400	1084200	That first giddy thought we had when we opened our NES under the tree, you know, if you do that thing.
1085000	1092900	You know, the first feeling we had when we found Mortal Kombat 2, you know, being beta tested somewhere, that was great.
1093000	1100500	You know, they're missing that same joy that we had back in the day.
1100500	1104300	And I'm not saying, oh, it was better back then, meh, get off my lawn, meh.
1104700	1110600	But I'm saying that they need to bring the heart back into it and then innovate it.
1111700	1119100	It's those two things that are, I think, what should come back in the next generation.
1119300	1122100	I mean, Nintendo's been doing it, you know, forever.
1122400	1123500	Nintendo's got it right.
1124200	1127400	And, but no one else is willing to innovate.
1127400	1132900	They just want to stay on that same hard edge and don't want to bring the love into it.
1132900	1142100	They're like, oh, well, we're just going to bring out the niche things to make a few people happy here and there, but we're going to keep pushing all of this triple A bullshit that we know is going to sell.
1142300	1143800	It's all the bottom line for them.
1144100	1147400	And for Nintendo, yeah, of course they got a bottom line to look at.
1147400	1151800	But for the most part, they're looking at what keeps the games fun.
1151800	1152900	What makes them fun?
1152900	1154000	What gives them heart?
1154900	1157800	You know, it's interesting, it's interesting you bring up the gaming's heart.
1157800	1180200	My answer is not that dissimilar from yours, but this particular point is really interesting to me because I do think one thing that has kind of defined the last couple of generations, probably starting with the like the Xbox 360, PS3, but really stepping up in this latest generation is the rise of independent gaming and the ability for more independent creators to get their artwork out there.
1180600	1205700	And as we see, you know, it's no, well, it's a coincidence, but no coincidence that as we're moving into this next generation of gaming, we're also seeing gigantic social uprisings going on between the Black Lives Matter movement, between increased visibility for LGBTQIA, between the hashtag Me Too and how that's been impacting the games industry.
1205900	1209500	And I think you absolutely are going to see that reflect.
1209500	1217900	So you talk about like the heart, you're going to see that reflected in the actual games, the actual content of what we see in the next generation.
1217900	1229700	And I think what we've seen in some of these early reveals, such as, you know, some very varied protagonists and so forth within not just Microsoft's event, but the Sony event as well, I think kind of speaks to that.
1229700	1231200	Am I right, you think?
1231600	1232100	Or on the right track?
1232100	1232800	I think so.
1233200	1243100	But the other thing, too, is that along the same lines that you're saying, too, I think we've definitely seen video games now as a valid form of protest or art.
1243100	1251000	And I think that this is all something that maybe the big players want to shy away from.
1251000	1254500	But at the same time, they have to accept that it's an inevitability.
1254800	1259100	For example, we had the Hong Kong protesters in Animal Crossing.
1259700	1269000	We now have a slew of I mean, if you just go on those little code sites for the Able Sisters, you'll find plenty of Black Lives Matter.
1269000	1271200	You'll find trans apparel.
1272500	1276600	Our friend Marissa made quite a few things that I've got one of them hanging in my shop.
1276700	1277700	Or Loki.
1277700	1288200	Loki had a story last week about how they were protesting in Red Dead, dressing up in clown outfits to protest the fact that Red Dead wasn't being updated.
1288200	1295300	So it's like, there's that, and we might kind of laugh at, you know, oh, that's more of like a silly protest.
1295300	1303600	But at the same way, it's like that ability to protest is finding its way into gaming, which I find fascinating.
1303600	1304600	Okay, Mass Ethnic 3.
1307800	1309400	I guess, yeah, there's that, too.
1309400	1331600	But the other the other thing with this, too, though, is that with the pandemic going on now, this is also going to affect what's happening with the next generation, which is why we're seeing, I think, so much of a burst in online and cloud based gaming and, you know, things that aren't going to require you to leave your house to go venture into a store.
1332200	1341600	On top of that, though, this the next generation, the way everything goes, it's going to affect the way video game industry does their business.
1342300	1345600	We're going to see the big chain stores go.
1345600	1352400	We're going to I think we're really going to have a resurgence of mom and pops of the trading sites of different things like that.
1352400	1359100	So when I think of next generation for gaming, I am not necessarily thinking of a console or a company.
1359500	1361200	I'm trying to look at it holistically.
1361600	1367100	All of these factors are what's going to play in to what we get at home.
1367800	1380700	And as much as this pandemic situation has absolutely sucked and there's not a lot of good things to say about it, you know, the art that will come from it, which includes video games, is going to be something, you know, not to not to be too silly.
1380700	1383000	But there's a lot of hype online on Twitter and stuff.
1383200	1386600	Oh, my gosh. Taylor Swift, surprise, put out an album.
1386800	1390500	Well, do you know why she had the time to make an entire album and surprise release it?
1390700	1393100	Because she was really fucking bored, right?
1393300	1395500	She was she ran out of access to write about.
1395500	1403900	I mean, but another another thing, too, and this is just going a little bit more into the social aspect of the next gen.
1403900	1408700	You were talking about, you know, about trolls and everything, I believe.
1408700	1414900	But I think that we're going to start seeing a lot more backlash from the marginalized within the gaming community.
1415300	1425000	And I think we're going to and whoever is going to be putting out the next consoles, no matter what they are, there's going to be the online element to it and they are going to be held accountable.
1425000	1439500	I mean, we've got all these people who are right now in the fire because they were misogynistic shits or had done all kinds of other atrocity, atrocious things as I was trying to get out.
1439900	1449500	But I think that all of this, I think we're going to have to see protections built in on the next generation, you know, again, to protect that heart.
1450800	1454100	It needs to be safe for everybody.
1454100	1465700	Everyone's going to need to have a good place to go and play and little do a lot of people realize that women are legitimately by the numbers 50% of the gaming market right now.
1466700	1468700	And there's no way to ostracize us.
1468700	1483500	It can't happen, you know, you've got people you have black people, brown people, people of all nationalities of all all color schemes of the rainbow, all sexualities, all genders just across the board.
1483500	1497700	And I think that in whatever is going to happen with the systems, whatever is going to happen with moderation online for any of that, they're going to have to be accepting that this world is changing without them and they better fucking change with it.
1498200	1499500	Games are for everyone.
1499800	1502000	Said it a lot here on the show, especially me.
1502400	1502700	All right.
1503600	1504800	I want to make sure we get everybody.
1504800	1507800	Loki, you know, you know, it was very well said.
1508100	1509500	Loki next.
1509600	1510700	What's the next gen for you?
1511700	1514600	It's going to be exactly the same as it has been this gen.
1514600	1515100	No, actually.
1515800	1519800	So they're going to I think that there's not really anything different.
1519800	1525200	You're going to have consoles pushing better graphics because they have, you know, more streamlined pathways.
1525200	1529100	They can do render more complex things because now they have more power.
1529300	1533200	Plus they don't have the latency from accessing physical drives.
1534200	1540500	You're going to see new ways to purchase content with, you know, the games pass kind of business model.
1541000	1547700	You have streaming services trying to kind of take up that aspect with Google Stadia, which is totally going to fail.
1548000	1557400	And then I don't know, like they have more of a traditional sense with like even Sony, but they're still trying to do their thing to with PlayStation now.
1558100	1561000	Honestly, I wasn't really disappointed in the graphics.
1561000	1570400	We're talking about like a showcase of stuff that's coming out several months away and you don't expect the graphics to be incredibly polished already.
1570600	1576200	I know everyone online was like, say, oh, well, Halo looked like it was kind of not looking as good.
1576200	1582400	But then they uploaded the trailer later that was running, I guess, in engine or something like that on the hardware and it looked a little bit better.
1582700	1585700	So I still think it's very early for that type of stuff.
1586100	1592600	And there are some games that, you know, not necessarily the art style has to push the game itself.
1592600	1597300	I think Halo's basically known for its good gameplay and that's what people are going to be coming in for.
1597800	1601200	Yeah, it's an Xbox system and they're expecting fancy graphics.
1601200	1603700	Well, you know, there's Forza Motorsports for that.
1603700	1606900	There's going to be a lot of other games that are going to be pushing graphics.
1609300	1613800	I don't know, I think people are making a big deal about it because there's not a lot of information to go off of right now.
1613800	1622400	So everybody has to take their stance to keep it competitive in this video game system war or whatever you want to call it.
1624400	1628400	I don't know, I don't see like physical retail going away.
1628400	1633700	I certainly don't see mom and pops taking over because that business model is not profitable at all.
1634000	1642400	They have a hard enough time when the industry is working well and when it was more physical media versus digital and now that switching kind of towards digital.
1643400	1645400	It's not getting any easier for them.
1647300	1651000	So I don't know, I guess we'll have to wait and see what happens.
1651500	1654200	All I know is like there's games I'm excited for.
1655800	1660700	I saw more of those types of games on during the Xbox presentation this last time.
1662500	1671900	Maybe Sony will have more of the next presentation they have or Microsoft will have even more the next time they show off some more stuff because they still have more coming according to their tees.
1671900	1682100	So I don't know and as far as Nintendo innovating there, they better be innovating because they're a little bit behind in a lot of things online being one of them.
1682100	1687000	Yet some of the game design stuff that they're doing and I understand you know where they're not behind sales.
1687500	1692800	So you know, and that's fine that they do have it's like the Apple market though.
1692800	1699500	They have a lot of people that are dedicated fans of their franchises and that's good for them and they'll keep them going for a while.
1699500	1707100	But eventually when the next shiny thing comes along that's able to take those fans away and that could be a very long time or impossible sometimes.
1708800	1709900	Then they're going to move to that.
1709900	1716400	But right now I know that they're not really being forced to innovate because they're kind of they're doing well as it is.
1716900	1725100	But there's a lot of flaws that could be fixed a lot of things that could be better and especially if like a model like games pass takes off.
1725200	1737300	They're going to have to look to adapt to that and fortunately being that they just kind of got into online and I got to say like having used like a lot of the online stuff now on their platform.
1737700	1741700	It's very clunky and it shouldn't be clunky in the year 2020.
1742000	1745500	I mean, they should be polished and ready to go not just getting into this.
1746600	1753500	I mean, I get it that that's the thing is if they're successful in their own right, then they're not going to push to innovate like this.
1753900	1760600	And I don't really consider the switch too innovative considering that yeah, it's a portable system that could dock to a TV.
1761400	1761900	Cool.
1762800	1766100	That itself is not really innovative as far as the way I play those games.
1766600	1775300	And the the we votes are not the we most the the switch joy cons are very similar to the we most but they're not even utilized to that.
1775300	1780100	Except they kind of force a lot of stuff in there with the motion controls, but I don't know.
1781100	1782700	There's games that are on it that are good.
1784000	1786700	But they're kind of in their own ecosystem right now.
1787100	1790700	So all right, so I'm just gonna keep staying the same.
1791400	1795400	I'm gonna I'm gonna try to keep my answer short, which might shock you but here it is.
1795400	1805700	And I'm not trying to be that guy on social media that quotes the movie The Matrix, but I'm gonna because I think for the next generation of games, there is no spoon.
1807000	1810700	And I think that's kind of where we're going is that there is no spoon.
1810900	1819600	And what I mean by that, like we talk a lot about how like the gaming industry follows a very similar path to the movie industry.
1819600	1826000	And I think we very often forget about that as a gaming and moving movies, excuse me, are more tied together than they are different.
1826200	1831300	In fact, to kind of follow up something I really wanted to say to Loki's comment about like Nintendo and Apple.
1831300	1835300	Well, you know, another name that gets thrown in with those guys all the time, Disney.
1835500	1840900	And when it comes to the film industry and entertainment, Disney kind of does their own thing.
1841000	1844700	They appeal to a family audience, but it touches a lot of adults too.
1844900	1847700	And they've been very successful with that model and they kind of exist.
1847800	1851500	They have their own little land and their own little world that you can go to.
1851500	1857900	Well, you know, when there's not a pandemic going on, but it's a very, you know, cute place for all that to exist.
1858100	1864000	So my point is, and when you look at movies, movies have gone through a lot of progression as well, right?
1864000	1870500	Like when we first started movies in the theater and then it started coming to VHS and Beta.
1870500	1874000	And I think before that really were the giant discs, the video discs.
1874200	1880300	And then it was DVD and then it was Blu-ray and then it was Netflix.
1880300	1884000	And now there were video discs and that turned into laser discs.
1885000	1889900	What were the gigantic freaking discs that were right around the time of the early tapes?
1889900	1890600	Laser discs.
1891000	1897200	No, before laser discs, they actually had video discs that came in what looked like a huge ass floppy.
1897400	1898000	Yes.
1898000	1899200	It looked like the size of an album.
1899200	1902000	Those were video discs, which was the concursion of laser discs.
1902100	1902300	Okay.
1902300	1902600	That's it.
1902600	1903000	Video discs.
1903000	1903900	That's what I was trying to think of.
1904300	1904600	Okay.
1904600	1906800	So, but, but anyway, y'all, y'all see what I'm saying.
1906800	1912800	And then for the, for the longest time, you know, the, the movie industry was like, oh my gosh, this is going to kill our industry.
1912800	1915500	We're going to, we're, nobody's going to go see a movie in the theater anymore.
1915800	1917300	And that hasn't happened.
1917400	1923400	And even with this pandemic, we're seeing more like things that are released on demand and in your home.
1923400	1925000	And is that going to kill theaters?
1925300	1926100	Probably not.
1926100	1928800	If anything kills theaters, it'll be this whole pandemic situation.
1929000	1933900	But fingers and toes crossed that we see the other side of this and have some sense of normalcy in the next couple of years.
1934200	1939400	I would bet that we're going to have a lot of things that are still at home and in the theater.
1939500	1951000	But anyway, now the movie industry and the TV industry is so like digital and on demand and services and things like Netflix and Disney Plus.
1951000	1952900	And that this, that's where a lot of that is going.
1953100	1960200	And so my answer for gaming is that I think, and this is what Microsoft, I think is really doing right, is that they see this coming.
1960500	1968400	And so that's why they're starting to sow the seeds with xCloud and, you know, the game, Game Pass is the way to get your games.
1968400	1971500	And the console is just one way to manifest it.
1971600	1975100	The console is one type of Netflix player, if that's what you want to do.
1975200	1977300	But at the end of the day, it's really going to be the games.
1977500	1981700	And to some extent, I think Google Stadia also has this.
1982000	1988100	The problem with Google Stadia is that it's Google's first foray really into games.
1988400	1995400	And they don't have the knowledge, experience or things behind it that are going to elevate it in the way that it needs.
1995400	1999200	And it feels very dated already before it's actually come out.
1999200	2002200	But the technology itself is actually really fascinating.
2002300	2007200	So I say there is no spoon because I think eventually there's not going to be a box anymore.
2007400	2010000	And I think Microsoft probably going to be the first to get there.
2011000	2014400	What do you think about hearing all that, Delvin, all of our answers?
2015200	2023700	Well, one thing I wanted to add is that one of the things I think Microsoft is trying to go for is install base.
2024100	2034500	And I think when we look at 360 versus PS3, you know, they were very neck and neck in terms of the numbers.
2035200	2043800	And then when we go to PS4 and Xbox One, they lost out on a lot of exclusives and third party games because they didn't have the install base.
2043800	2046100	It's the same thing that Nintendo goes through.
2047000	2057900	And I think this is Microsoft's way of kind of changing that narrative where, yes, we have the numbers and they're changing the way in which you achieve that.
2058400	2062700	Normally, it was just the more consoles you sell means the more people that can play your games.
2062700	2064300	But they've now changing that.
2064500	2080600	You know, they're growing that blue ocean strategy like Nintendo was where we're increasing our install base by your computer, by eventually xCloud, you know, on your Samsung Smart TV eventually and everything.
2080600	2092200	And then what they'll be able to go to third parties and say is, we have 200 million Xbox users via PC, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2092200	2098900	Whereas Sony will only have PlayStation 5 or Nintendo will only have a Switch.
2099300	2109000	So that's kind of where I think Microsoft is trying to change the shift and their way to increase their foothold in the console gaming space.
2109900	2114500	I am very curious what you guys in our chat room think over twitch.tv slash vog network.
2114500	2115400	I'll try to get a few comments.
2115400	2117400	I see you guys have said many things.
2117400	2118700	It's scrolling so fast.
2118700	2122700	I almost can't get to get to the comments in time because we're having such a great discussion here on air.
2122800	2123900	But I am watching you guys.
2123900	2125100	You guys are having great discussion.
2125200	2132700	And I also, I have to acknowledge, I know we don't usually acknowledge the biddies and subs, but I have to acknowledge the hype train y'all got up to like level four or something.
2132700	2133500	That's pretty awesome.
2133500	2134900	So thank you guys very much for that.
2135800	2139400	But I want to point out also Bobby was kind of piggybacking on a comment.
2139400	2141800	I said about how like they'll still there.
2141900	2144100	There will always be a place for movie theaters.
2145100	2150400	A big thing that's starting to happen right now is pop up drive-through theaters or not drive-through drive-in theaters.
2151100	2155100	You know, I happen to live not far from an actual drive-in theater.
2155100	2161600	That's that's thriving now in this day and age, but now we're seeing like Walmart parking lots turning into drive-in theaters.
2161700	2174800	Heck, there was a big deal this weekend over at the old miniature golf course, the mine shaft here locally, a bunch of the Burning Man crowd went out and turned it into a drive-through art festival.
2175100	2182500	So you actually got in your car and you kind of like drove from station to station and there were different art installations there, which I thought was a really cool idea.
2182600	2186500	Sadly, I was preoccupied and I didn't get to see it, but I thought it was a neat idea.
2186500	2190100	So it's really interesting to see how like society is kind of like adapting to that.
2190400	2197900	So so the reason why I bring all that up is that it also demonstrates for some people, there's always going to still be a need for a box.
2198100	2208200	I don't think the box necessarily always just totally goes away, but I think definitely the what goes into that box and all that is definitely a changing system.
2208700	2220200	Um, St. 100 Matt in our chat says, on the theater point earlier, I think theaters were hurting before the pandemic, but they were starting to innovate nicer seats, serving alcohol and serving real food.
2220300	2222900	I think gaming needs to continue innovating.
2223200	2223800	Absolutely.
2223800	2227000	Yeah, they need to start serving alcohol and real food and gaming as well.
2228500	2229700	Where's my slash pizza?
2232200	2233400	Great minds think like us.
2233400	2233900	I love it.
2233900	2234900	That would be hilarious.
2235700	2236400	Let's see now.
2236400	2241900	Phoenix in chat says, at least in the USA, internet speeds will kneecap streaming based games for a while to come.
2242100	2246300	A 100 gigabyte connection is still not cheap and data caps will kill it too.
2246500	2248000	That's a very good point as well.
2248300	2249900	Um, so yeah.
2250400	2254900	Um, then some folks talking about where different drive-ins are being set up in their towns.
2255200	2257200	Yeah, it's, uh, they're all starting to pop up everywhere.
2257200	2257900	It's fascinating.
2258400	2264800	So I was going to say they go back to, uh, what you were saying with, um, Disney and how the game industry kind of likes to copy.
2265500	2266700	They already are.
2266700	2277900	In fact, I would say Disney's copying the game industry and the fact that they keep, instead of innovating with brand new original films, they keep churning up, churning out sequel after sequel and remake after remake.
2278200	2282500	So it's a little bit of the movie industry now copying the games industry.
2282900	2294800	Um, I don't know what's nice though, to see it, as you mentioned with the indie games getting highlighted nowadays, um, as a good source of entertainment, um, look at the whole Xbox.
2294900	2299700	You know, game demos at home thing, but for their event, they did, it was all indie titles.
2299900	2307600	I mean, aside from the remake of, um, Destroy All Humans, but it's all indie titles that you can check out and play.
2307600	2309800	So that was pretty cool that that's being highlighted.
2309800	2311600	And we did not too long ago.
2311600	2318600	We even have the steam, uh, the steam indie expo thing that they did as well, a couple of times where you can play indie games as well.
2318600	2321600	And it's all being highlighted these brand new creators.
2321600	2335300	And even a lot of, um, you know, the stuff that's being shown at the Xbox games conference and not so much the Sony, but they had a lot of indie titles being focused on because yeah, people are kind of getting sick of this stuff.
2335300	2339700	And there's a lot of these AAA companies they're saying, Oh, this game types, not single player is dead.
2339700	2345800	It's all about this online, you know, persistent environment that is going to be popular, like destiny and stuff.
2346000	2349100	Whereas people were like, no, we disagree with you.
2349100	2351000	We're going to create single player games in there.
2351600	2357600	And that's extremely successful because some of these companies are really shortsighted and they'd go where the money is the easiest for them.
2357600	2363600	Uh, Sam Tiberian chat says, anyone have thoughts about on how it might parallel the new paradigm arising in TV?
2363600	2369600	Perhaps the services will become less hardware based, but would that also require a further variety of subscriptions?
2369600	2378600	And my answer to that is probably, I think it's guaranteed that by the end of this next generation, Sony has their own response to Microsoft game pass technically.
2378600	2383600	And I bet some of you are going to jump at this. They kind of already have something. They have PlayStation now.
2383600	2390600	The PlayStation now is also based on a lot of older products and it's different because you're streaming it and the technology isn't quite there.
2390600	2395600	But I think Sony is going to try to launch something that is going to kind of really try to compete with game pass.
2395600	2398600	I think that's a foregone conclusion. They're going to have to.
2398600	2403600	Yeah. And like a Phoenix 7, 7, 2, 6 says, you know, a lot of the major companies are already going that way.
2403600	2420600	Like EA, uh, Ubisoft, you know, there's a lot of companies are already piece failing their own like digital streaming stuff where, okay, you get our titles by paying us, you know, some money separate from that you would pay for games pass or PlayStation now or something like that.
2420600	2428600	I'm kind of wish Nintendo would jump on board with that, but I guess we've got some free Nintendo games.
2429600	2440600	I think Nintendo would be open to that idea, but I think in one of Nintendo's biggest struggles is not having the infrastructure means in which to properly set that up.
2440600	2452600	I think it's not that it's an excuse. There's obviously means in which they can go about doing that, but I think they like to keep things in house and not having the infrastructure to run their own servers.
2452600	2463600	That's why they're online is still trash. Um, but, uh, the idea of a subscription service, I'm sure there want to be on board for it, but they just don't necessarily have the infrastructure means to do it.
2463600	2469600	Um, just team up with Microsoft, put their games on their platform. Microsoft can back the infrastructure and win, win everybody.
2469600	2471600	Hey, I'm all for that.
2471600	2479600	Delvin. This has been a phenomenal kickoff topic. It's been going on a while though. We were almost an hour into the show and technically I only have Jamie till 7 30 about.
2479600	2490600	I have to kind of move on for time, but thank you so much. This has been a great kickoff topic and discussion. Did you get what you wanted out of it? A good discussion about next gen.
2490600	2501600	Yes, I think it was great. No, it was great. Um, let's talk briefly because I did, I did want you to stick around and let's talk about. So what the next gen looks like in the more immediate term and the Xbox game showcase.
2501600	2509600	So look, if you wouldn't mind, you might have to step on the gas a little bit with what we, uh, saw at this event and just hit some of the highlights. But, uh, what happened at the Xbox game showcase?
2509600	2522600	Uh, we saw halo infinite. So there is that and people were like, Hey, that's halo, but it doesn't look as good as I was hoping it would be. And so, you know, there's those people as well, but it looks, Hey, it looks like halo.
2523600	2537600	I thought it was fine. I'm into it. Yeah, I'm fine. Um, there's some cool other like indie trailers as well. Like, uh, this game called echo generation. That's a, it kind of has this earthbound type of feel to it and it's like box lace. So it looked pretty cool.
2538600	2555600	Um, hello neighbor too. I know my kids are excited about that one. Uh, this one, I know Jamie's probably pretty excited about Balan wonderland or wonder world. I'm sorry. It's, uh, the developers behind, um, Sonic and nights, uh, Yuji, Naka and Oshima.
2556600	2571600	So that looks happy. Sweet. Uh, can't wait about that. Uh, state of the K look, uh, three look pretty cool. Uh, of course, for some motor sports, we got, you know, the car porn stuff for that. Didn't really show much gameplay, but I mean, it looks pretty.
2571600	2581600	There's always, there's always a racing game to show off the power of the console always. And you know, it, it looks nice. I'm not into the simulation stuff as much as I am the arcade stuff, but it looked nice. It looked pretty.
2582600	2598600	Yeah. Uh, we've got a new original game from rare called Everwild. They look kind of cool. Um, so to check that out a new game from dot nod, uh, which is tell me why so that the story on that looks kind of interesting as well.
2598600	2613600	Um, grounded was one that was, uh, they showed another trailer for, and, um, I like how obsidian coast poking fun at themselves with that. You know, if you're waiting for the biggest game in the industry, wait for cyberpunk, but the smallest game choose ours.
2614600	2626600	Um, so they have that they're going to have that's coming to Xbox preview on July 28. So right around the corner, honey, I shot the kids, the game. Although I think it's, it's, it's like a Minecraft type or it's like it's arc survival, but junior.
2627600	2639600	I got, yeah, it looked cool. So that was pretty neat. Um, the outer wilds, uh, or outer worlds, we're getting a new expansion. So the peril on Gorgon and it looks pretty awesome.
2639600	2653600	Um, and then of course the other thing that obsidian was teasing is their brand new, um, franchise that they're star or I'm hoping it's a franchise, but big open world RPG called avowed, which is basically, Hey, we're obsidian.
2653600	2667600	And we're going to create our own elder school Skyrim now. And I'm all for that. It looks great. Um, what else? So they announced that destiny twos coming to games pass because it's already everywhere else.
2667600	2678600	Um, stalker two was kind of unexpected. So they showed a trailer for that. Uh, talked a little bit about hell blade to, um, psycho knots to another trailer for that as well.
2678600	2689600	And including a song by Jack black, this game called the gunk that is supposed to be, um, kind of a next game in steam world.
2690600	2698600	Uh, Tetris effect is going to be getting an update and is also going to be coming to the Xbox one and series X with multiplayer as well.
2698600	2716600	Um, a new Warhammer game, dark tide, a fancy star online two is coming to the console 2021. So that's pretty sweet. We saw some more like gameplay of, uh, the medium, which looks exactly like silent Hill would be.
2716600	2723600	And last but not least, they tased us with a little bit with fable. So there's going to be a brand new fable game and I'm all for it.
2725600	2738600	Um, Bobby and chat says, I don't, I didn't think Tetris effect connected was an update. I thought it was a new game. I believe it's like an enhancement to the base game and I could be wrong, but I heard it is also coming to PlayStation and the Epic game store.
2738600	2742600	It's not going to be exclusive to Microsoft. It's just that it will be a part of game pass.
2742600	2754600	Yeah. It's, um, they're going to be adding multiplayer to the existing game and it's coming out. It's a free update, um, coming next summer. I don't know why so far away, but that's what they're doing.
2754600	2768600	Uh, quest buster and chat says, can't wait for a vowed. It takes place in the same world as the pillars of eternity series. Yeah. Look, look pretty hot. So quickly, um, from, and just open the floor, what were your impressions overall, uh, on the Xbox event?
2768600	2779600	I thought it was a great infomercial for game pass, honestly, like I was watching this whole thing going, yep. You know what? I'm going to keep my game pass subscription. There's a lot of good stuff coming out that I'm going to want to play and, and stay up on.
2779600	2786600	And so if that was Microsoft's ultimate goal was to sell game pass. Cool. They got me, they got me gal.
2787600	2795600	I wish we had gotten that rumored announcement that games pass is going to replace Xbox live gold. I guess we'll have to wait for their next presentation.
2795600	2801600	Wait for the system presentation. Maybe we'll get that. Um, Delvin, what about you? What were your thoughts?
2801600	2824600	Um, you know, when I looked at the offerings of what Microsoft showed versus what Sony showed, if, you know, in terms of games, um, Microsoft showed me more reasons to jump on board with them, whether that be by getting a series X or, you know, signing up for game pass.
2824600	2841600	And I think they just want people to sign up for game pass. Um, and, uh, ultimately one of the other things that I did notice and find interesting was the absence of a number after Halo, Forza and Fable.
2841600	2859600	Well, Fable, I mean, it's still kind of early and I don't know if they would necessarily throw a number there. They may just try to reboot the whole thing. Same with Forza. I mean, they'll probably have a number with that Halo Infinite. I mean, we already has kind of a, sort of a number.
2859600	2876600	I don't think Fable will get a number. I think, and a lot of people are misthinking it's a remake of the original Fable. I think the true subtitle is Molyneux Free Fable. Fable, Molyneux Free, but they can't say that. So this is, this is what it's going to be.
2876600	2878600	I think it's going to be a re-imagining.
2879600	2894600	Oh, absolutely. And Playground Games, they made Forza Horizon that like revolutionized racing games. So like, I don't want to set the bar too high, but oops, like it's, it's up there. I'm expecting big things from Fable.
2895600	2909600	And honestly, like the games pass, it is, it's like, that's the thing is when you're looking at, and I know what some of the news coming out of the Xbox conference thing is that a lot of these exclusive console launch exclusives or whatever, aren't necessarily exclusive.
2909600	2922600	Some of them are timed exclusive. Some of them are coming out on PC as well. There's a lot of things, but I mean, you know what, Sony does the same thing with their exclusives as well as a lot of the stuff that they had was timed exclusives.
2923600	2931600	But when you're looking to differentiate yourself, games pass is definitely a good way to do that because you're basically saying, Hey, you know, there's a lot of games coming out.
2931600	2939600	And if you want to play them, you could purchase each one piece of mail, or you can pay 15 bucks a month and you get them all.
2940600	2948600	I mean, that's not really a hard sell for folks that are probably paying for more than one streaming service at a time as it is.
2948600	2953600	I mean, it's, it's not, it's a real easy sell is what it is.
2954600	2970600	So I think that's definitely has an edge over Sony right now unless they kind of come out and really, you know, do some updates to PlayStation now, because right now I'm not all down with the constant streaming services with them.
2971600	2978600	I wish I had a way to download their titles and I wish there's more in there, but we'll have to see how they kind of flush that out.
2979600	2987600	Sg100Matt in chat says, I do feel a little sad that this means we won't be getting a new Forza Horizon for a while, but I get it. We're getting a new Forza Motorsport in its place.
2988600	2996600	Yeah. And there's also, I mean, there could be multiple teams within playground games that is, you know, a possibility, but also I do believe we heard that Forza Horizon 4.
2996600	3002600	I don't think it was in there, but like a supplemental press release or tweet Forza Horizon 4 is going to get like a series X boost.
3003600	3011600	So there will be like a version of that game that will play a little better. Yeah. So, um, anyway, we got to move on with the show and get to some of the other headlines for the week.
3012600	3019600	Delvin, you did such a good job. Thank you for your topic tonight and being our first guest host for the kickoff topic.
3020600	3022600	No problem at all. Feel free to have me on whenever you need.
3022600	3027600	I know you probably weren't planning on sitting here for an hour, but thank you so much for doing so anyway.
3028600	3032600	No problem. Do you have anything to plug? Are you still streaming these days or what are you up to?
3033600	3040600	I haven't been streaming much. So, I mean, you could definitely go follow my channel, which is twitch.tv slash VGrealness.
3041600	3046600	But no streaming has been happening there as of lately, but definitely go follow and I'll be back soon.
3047600	3052600	When that Phantasy Star 2 New Genesis thing comes out, that might be a thing.
3053600	3055600	She screamed when that happened.
3056600	3060600	I let out a little, a little like, as well. So it's pretty, yeah.
3061600	3074600	I will leave with this last point regarding Phantasy Star Online 2. When I saw it, it looked like Xenoblade Chronicles X was meant to be played.
3074600	3085600	Like, you know, the massive worlds, online, multi-players, people actually in your party going and, you know, exploring the world.
3086600	3088600	That's what it looked like to me, so it got me excited.
3089600	3096600	Alright. There's a lot to be excited about in gaming right now. You know, the next gen of games is exciting. There's a lot of good stuff coming out, that's for sure.
3097600	3098600	Absolutely.
3099600	3100600	Alright, Delvin, thank you so much for being here tonight. Take care.
3101600	3102600	Good night.
3102600	3103600	Alright, good night.
3104600	3105600	Good night.
3106600	3115600	We are going to talk quickly about our gaming weeks. So let's get into how was your gaming week. And we'll start with Dark Soccer. How was your gaming week?
3116600	3124600	I played Animal Crossing, Some Words with Friends. I played that weird word circle game that I'm kind of into right now.
3124600	3132600	Hold on, there's something else on here that I was playing. Actually, no, not really, because I've been kind of back into reading comics.
3133600	3141600	I've rediscovered my love of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and I am reading the entire IDW series now.
3142600	3150600	And so I'm like, oh yeah, I have games to play but comics. So, c'est la vie.
3151600	3153600	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
3154600	3163600	So I played a little bit of Paper Mario, The Origami King still, so I've been going through that quite a bit, really enjoying that game.
3164600	3177600	I played a little bit of Animal Crossing because everybody's been bugging me to play it, so I finally got my first expansion, well, the first bit of my house and just going through that.
3177600	3186600	And of course, Minecraft most of the week as well, just doing more things than that, building more automated farms.
3187600	3193600	My son now wants me to build him a modern mansion across the street, just one mansion, so it's fine.
3194600	3195600	Just a little mansion, yeah.
3196600	3199600	Just a little mansion, it's all good. So I've been gathering resources for that.
3199600	3216600	I built a really cool creeper head door yesterday, so that was kind of fun. It took several hours to get the redstone correct in the Bedrock Edition because it works very differently than, say, other, you know, the Java Edition stuff.
3217600	3225600	And then a little bit of Orna as well. I haven't been playing as much lately, but I've been making sure to get my wars in each day and doing the gauntlets and stuff like that.
3226600	3227600	So I've been playing a little bit of that.
3227600	3228600	That's pretty much it.
3229600	3236600	My gaming week has not been quite as varied as previous weeks. I didn't get to experiment with a lot of new games this week.
3237600	3241600	I spent most of the weekend doing Pokémon GO and the Pokémon GO Fest that happened.
3242600	3254600	I did an impromptu stream with Shane last night on my personal channel, so if you want to hear us talking for two hours about that, you can go over to my personal channel at Rob Roberts on Twitch and check out the archive there.
3254600	3259600	But I will say quickly, because obviously I don't want to just be like, and I'm not going to tell you my thoughts otherwise.
3260600	3267600	The Cliff Notes version, and having done Day 2 as well, the $15, the price tag was a little steep, I think, for what they offered.
3268600	3277600	And I think they did not make very clear what it was you were going to be paying for from the outset, and I think there's going to be an expectation of Niantic in the future.
3277600	3284600	What do free players get, what do everybody get, and what am I really getting for my $15 so people can make a more informed decision?
3285600	3299600	I don't want to be overly negative on it. They've been very challenged with having to change these games on the fly, because all their games, like Ingress and Pokémon GO and so forth, are about bringing people together.
3299600	3308600	And 2020 is the year not to do that with the pandemic going on. So I will give them some slack that they were really challenged to do that.
3309600	3316600	And I think they've made a lot of great quality of life upgrades to Pokémon GO to make that happen, and they've done some of that with Ingress as well.
3317600	3326600	But I just think at the end of the day, the price tag was too high, and it didn't really deliver enough, because it wasn't a new area. It didn't feel that new.
3326600	3335600	Sure, there were a couple new Pokémons, there was a quest chain, it got me to do that Team Rocket fighting stuff that I don't like doing, but it was so easy to do today.
3336600	3342600	Like, I had to go through it and get my Shadow Mewtwo, and what is it, the Victory L or whatever that thing, the mythical is that you get at the end of it.
3343600	3349600	I had to do all that, and so it got me to do that, so I was cool, I guess I was cool with that, but I think $15 was a little high.
3349600	3356600	I think maybe like $5 would have been awesome, $10 would have been like, okay, but I think $15 was just a little bit too high.
3357600	3366600	So, and some folks in chat, yeah, S.G.O. and Hermat says, I wasn't too crazy about day 2, and Act F says, but day 1 also had its really good stuff.
3367600	3374600	I did try one new game this week through Game Pass, and that was Ark Survival Evolved, which I'd never played before, I didn't know anything about it.
3374600	3380600	And it was kind of neat, but I had no idea what the hell I was doing, because this game doesn't have a tutorial.
3381600	3386600	Or there's a lot of screens that you can just read, read, read, read, but who has time to do that? You want to get in there and you want to play.
3387600	3397600	And so it took me a long time to figure out, like, oh, I can beat up a rock, it's basically Minecraft, but a little more realistic with this whole prehistoric kind of, you know,
3397600	3405600	you wake up and you're on this beach, naked by yourself, and you have to learn to eat, you have to learn to, you know, craft things and survive,
3406600	3416600	and eventually you get to tame the dinosaurs and make the world your own. And it's a cool concept, but like, I just, I felt really sloppy and stupid getting through the first hour or so.
3417600	3424600	And I guess maybe that's, some people like that, some people like that kind of challenge, I just want to make maybe like a little more hand-holding,
3424600	3433600	like Minecraft does this now and it does it very well, like it's like, it walks you through making like the base set of tools and understanding what those tools do and then it turns you loose.
3434600	3441600	And I would have just liked to see a little more of that from Ark, but I don't think it necessarily like ruins the entire game, I definitely have slept on this game otherwise,
3442600	3448600	and I like those kind of like crafting open world games right now, so I'll probably go back to it and try it again and see.
3449600	3460600	And as that says, I've been playing mobile, I love it, I had no idea that it was even like on mobile until you started sharing those screenshots in one of our chats, but yeah, with Xbox,
3461600	3476600	it's got a nice version on there and it's weird to play it with a controller though, like some of, I feel like this game was made for phones or PC slash Mac because it feels really clunky on a controller, that's the only problem.
3476600	3489600	So, no, my house didn't get burned down by somebody else, I didn't even build a house, I didn't get that far, I didn't know what I was doing, it took me forever just to like realize that like I could like mine a tree for wood, that whole type of thing.
3490600	3502600	Alright, anyway, let's move on, we got a lot of stories to get into tonight, and I know Dark Sakura sadly can only stay with us a little longer, though you said your schedule is changing real soon so we'll get to have you for full shows again, which will be awesome.
3502600	3512600	That will actually be next Sunday, where I go back to my normal schedule, so I'll be off on Sundays and going in later on Mondays, so I can do a full show again.
3513600	3519600	Alright, well, while we have you, let's make sure we get some news from you, so why don't you start us off tonight with our first story, Dark Sakura.
3520600	3531600	Well, we actually have, you know, everything old is new again right well there's been a very interesting little teaser that's come up.
3532600	3543600	And it was on the official G4 TV Twitter, and the attack of the show Twitter and the X play Twitter, which were all reactivated to tweet this.
3544600	3564600	And it had responses from many people who are on the network before. And so now all of the, those accounts, the three accounts say we never stopped playing in their bio. So yeah, there is a teaser out there, teasing the return of G4.
3565600	3573600	There's also a funny thing is that it ends with Pong, which of course we know that that's how the channel went out.
3575600	3584600	And we're starting to see like I said the host, the old host are pretty much retweeting and getting in on it so we'll, we'll see what happens.
3587600	3589600	I don't know. I'm.
3590600	3598600	I don't know if it's going to be the network I think it might be just like some of the shows, but we'll see.
3599600	3607600	Phoenix 7726 in our chat room over twitch.tv slash fog network says this announcement gets a five out of five.
3609600	3617600	All right, I'm down for it for that as long as like, I mean I'm good with it, I hope it comes back and it does well.
3619600	3632600	I was out of nowhere. Yeah, I think I have this figured out, I think I Nancy drew this and figure this all out and I arrived at a very similar conclusion to what Bobby Blackwell was talking about before us here when he started tonight.
3632600	3647600	And I think what this is all about. I think if you look at who owns G4 still and who owns the rights. It's Comcast universal it's one of their products, and there's another thing that Comcast universal just recently launched they're putting a lot of stock into because
3647600	3657600	they want to be able to compete with everybody else that's launched one of these, and that's peacock their online streaming service. And I think there's a match there I think if you actually go into peacock the streaming service.
3657600	3670600	There's lots of nonstop all day channels you can watch in there, and CBS all access has this to you can watch your local CBS station and a couple, I think there's like an entertainment tonight channel and a CBS like sports channel, you can watch those all day.
3670600	3679600	There's free apps like Pluto and to be where you can watch like TV channels that are just you know like old school TV channels that's what they are.
3679600	3694600	But they're because now it's on the internet, you have these very niche, sort of channels that show very like niche types of programming. So on peacock we have like a channel that shows old Saturday Night Live bits all day, or old Jimmy Fallon and tonight show stuff.
3694600	3706600	So I think G4 is going to fit real nicely right into there, and they might be showing some of the old stuff, which is maybe why the hosts have suddenly started on Twitter again. I think y'all need to level set your expectations.
3706600	3713600	I would not expect Morgan Webb and Adam Sessler to be coming back to do new episodes as x play, they might do a cameo.
3713600	3720600	They might hand the baton to somebody else, but I would be really surprised if they were to come back and do the show because they've moved on in their careers.
3720600	3732600	Morgan Webb is in the games industry. She's with some game company I think down in Southern California, and Adam Sessler I think went to some I think he's outside the games industry now, if I remember right I don't I can't profess to be their biggest
3732600	3747600	fans and follow their every move. So I just, I, but I know they've moved on in their careers, as has you know somebody we were working with many years ago and you know I still try to keep tabs on Scott Rubin, who is a big part of G4 TV and a big part of the foundation
3747600	3760600	of G4, you know he's moved on with stuff that he does, working with the ice cream stuff at Burning Man and some of the production company and stuff so like, you know, everybody's kind of like moved on in their careers, so I'm not so sure we should expect
3760600	3773600	all these old hosts to get back together again. I think we'll probably see some new stuff, but I think it might be mixed in with old stuff that they're going to show like on this G4 peacock thing, but I think G4 will be a branding for a couple of things.
3773600	3785600	E-sports, don't take your eye off of that because I could totally see that peacock might want to cement itself as an E-sports streaming thing, and they could leverage the G4 brand to do that so there's that.
3785600	3802600	But then also they might try to create bingeable shows they might try to create 10 new episodes x play to binge and they'll be under like the G4 label, and it'll be a part of peacock, but I would, if I bet money on this type of stuff and I would, I would bet G4 and peacock are tied together.
3802600	3808600	But we'll see. It might not end up being that at all. It might end up being like a Twitch channel or something like that like a lot of people are thinking.
3808600	3816600	I hope it's not all just the old stuff. I hope that they do new content for it because it would be kind of disappointing if it's just reruns of the old things.
3816600	3823600	And also speaking of reruns, can we get some Starrcade in there please?
3824600	3834600	Can I host the new Starrcade? Everybody on Twitter, every personality on Twitter is like, I want to be on the new G4. I want to be on the new G4 when we don't even know what the fuck it is.
3834600	3845600	So, you know, y'all can look me up if you need a host for Starrcade, but I'm not exactly going to hold my breath either. I'm sure they have their eye on plenty of other people, but I'd be the best.
3846600	3852600	Gaming has changed since G4 went off the air. Esports is more of a thing that everyone with a video service is fighting to get.
3852600	3857600	Gaming brings in a lot of money now. It feels like a perfect storm for G4 to come back.
3857600	3864600	Crystal Sykes 80 in chat says Morgan Web is working with a new company from Riot Refugees. I knew there was something there.
3864600	3874600	So, yeah. Tiger Claw says the G4 that's relaunching won't be the G4 you remember. I see this more as using an existing brand because of the recognition.
3874600	3880600	I agree with that, and don't forget the G4 you remember could be one of like three or four different things.
3880600	3888600	Do you mean the early G4 that many of you folks who got introduced to our show through All Games and Scott and all that, is that the G4 you remember?
3888600	3895600	Or do you remember G4 Tech TV? Or do you remember when they dropped Tech TV and they were G4 just with Attack of the Show?
3895600	3902600	Or do you remember reruns of Cops? Which G4 are you looking for? Which G4 do you want?
3903600	3912600	So, anyhow, it'll be interesting to see what comes of it. It really will. I'm very curious, but we'll have to just kind of hold our breath.
3912600	3918600	Oh man, I would love for Tech TV to come back. Can they come back on the air too?
3918600	3924600	I know everybody's talking about it. Everybody's talking about Attack of the Show coming back. How about the screensavers?
3924600	3927600	Hello, that's the show I'd love to see come back.
3928600	3931600	They have their own screensavers. It's still on the air.
3931600	3938600	Leo Laporte is this week in tech and that's like if you want to follow him, that's where he's at.
3938600	3946600	Well no, he actually does a show called the screensaver. I think he does the new screensavers now. I think that's what it's called.
3946600	3953600	And it is a streaming video show now. I'm pretty sure. I don't think it's this week in tech still.
3953600	3959600	I know he does his podcast and everything. I'm pretty sure that's a live video show though.
3959600	3964600	Alright, well we'll see. We don't have a lot else to go off of on the G4 thing for now.
3964600	3969600	Let's move on with some more news. Loki, you were talking about a game a little bit earlier.
3969600	3982600	Yes, I did talk about a game a little bit earlier. So this is pretty cool. This is, I think, actually part of their pre-show that they did for the Xbox gaming event or press conference.
3982600	3987600	But they were showing off a brand new game. It's being published by Square Enix.
3987600	4000600	And of course, it combines the talents of Yuji Naka and co-creator of Nights Into Dreams, Naoto Oshima.
4000600	4006600	And it's this game called Balan Wonderland, which I am now playing in the background of my video stream.
4007600	4015600	And it is every, it just exudes the essence of Nights. It is a 3D platformer game.
4015600	4023600	What's kind of cool though is you get these costumes which each have their own powers that sort of remind me a little bit of actually Mega Man as well.
4023600	4030600	And so it's going to be something that's going to be coming to Xbox One and the Series X in 2021.
4031600	4043600	But yeah, I'm down for a brand new game from these guys. And just, it was probably one of the more exciting announcements even before the show started, which is pretty sweet.
4043600	4053600	So yeah, I mean, I'm down. And this is one of these games that you don't need to push like really great graphics to have a really fun looking game.
4053600	4059600	But even seeing that for the graphics is pretty great. So bring it on. Let's do it.
4059600	4069600	Yeah, it looks cute. And Dark Sakura, I know you're a big Nights fan. You and your husband have a Nights tradition around Christmas time for Christmas Nights.
4069600	4072600	So is Balan Wonderland something that speaks to you?
4072600	4079600	Yeah, I'm interested in it. It's on the list. We'll see what happens. It looks really fun, really cute.
4079600	4087600	And it makes me think that Cappy has like a really crazy cousin who decided just to take over people's entire heads.
4088600	4096600	And it should be noted, though, that even though this was part of the Xbox event, it's also coming to other platforms, including Switch.
4096600	4100600	Yeah, I saw stuff about Switch. That's probably what I would want to play it on.
4100600	4102600	Yeah. All right.
4102600	4103600	Still exciting.
4103600	4110600	Yeah, it looks good. I can't wait to have a demo or see more info on it so I can get my hands on it and play it myself.
4110600	4114600	Jumping ahead to some Nintendo news, because Nintendo shared a little bit this week.
4114600	4120600	They also had a direct mini this week where they did like a showcase of some upcoming games from their partners.
4120600	4127600	Unfortunately, I think this is one of those things on social media where people set the bar really high, like OMG, Metroid Prime.
4127600	4137600	No, no, it wasn't any of that. And I thought Nintendo made that clear, but sometimes folks get their expectations set a little bit high.
4138600	4145600	So some folks were left disappointed. But if you more level set those expectations appropriately, then you got a few updates that maybe you liked.
4145600	4152600	For example, Shin Megami Tensei 5, I think that's going to be a big deal because that is coming out exclusively to the Nintendo Switch.
4152600	4157600	That is a role-playing series that's gone on forever. It has tons of spin-off types of things.
4157600	4161600	Like, isn't Persona kind of eventually a spin-off of Shin Megami Tensei, essentially?
4161600	4171600	So like, you know, this series is a mainstay in gaming, so the fact that Nintendo Switch is getting the exclusive on the actual number 5 is a pretty big deal.
4171600	4180600	Shin Megami Tensei 3 is getting a remaster, so that's pretty cool. That'll be coming out in Spring 2021 for the Nintendo Switch.
4180600	4184600	Rogue Company is a new shooter that they showed off as well.
4184600	4189600	I know y'all love wrestling, even though wrestling has been a little iffy in the gaming world in the past few years.
4189600	4197600	But WWE 2K Battlegrounds is coming, and it says that it's going to be all new, over-the-top, in-your-face, arcade action.
4197600	4202600	And what else do we expect from the WWE but over the top? That's why we watch it.
4202600	4207600	And then another big announcement, which is pretty cool, Cadence of Hyrule. Yeah?
4207600	4212600	One thing about that is I was hearing, I think that's the one that they're getting CM Punk to come back for.
4212600	4216600	Oh, that's not on my list, but that would be pretty cool.
4216600	4220600	Yeah, I saw something about that earlier. I think that might be the game.
4220600	4225600	It might be. I'm trying to bring up a story that's got more information on that.
4225600	4229600	Yeah, Phoenix7726 says WWE games have been really bad for the last five years.
4229600	4235600	That might explain why they're trying to do something different with it, though, for what it's worth. So, who knows?
4235600	4242600	Alright, anyway. And then the one other thing I want to mention, the Cadence of Hyrule, there's going to be three DLC packs for this.
4242600	4247600	And a lot of people are really into that game. It's the Crypt of the Necrodancer meets Zelda songs.
4247600	4253600	There's going to be a character pack with five new characters, a melody pack with 39 new songs,
4253600	4259600	and a third pack for additional story called Symphony of the Mask where you actually play as Skull Kid.
4259600	4264600	So I think it's pretty cool that that game has been so successful because that was really a partnership between
4264600	4268600	an established franchise and indie games and a lot of people are really into it.
4268600	4275600	I think people are going to be very pleased to hear Nintendo is pouring even more into that with the three DLC packs that are coming.
4275600	4278600	That's pretty frickin' cool. Alright, let's move on.
4278600	4281600	Yeah. By the way, it's a rumor.
4281600	4282600	Oh, it's a rumor.
4282600	4288600	Yeah, I saw it when going through just somebody looking at people, but it was a rumor.
4288600	4294600	Well, we'll see. Alright, Darsakra, maybe you have another rumor for us.
4294600	4301600	I do. And this one actually has, I think, a little bit more credence to it.
4301600	4316600	But one of my favorite mangaka as a comic artist in Japan, Ito Junji, is apparently in talks with Kojima to do another horror project.
4316600	4323600	Ito is supposed to be working on Silent Hills.
4323600	4335600	And I think also did contribute to the PT, so I'm not sure. But for anyone who doesn't recognize Ito's name, a lot of his manga became movies.
4335600	4342600	For anyone who's into Japanese horror, so Uzumaki, and actually there's going to be a new version of Uzumaki coming out.
4342600	4353600	There's the Tomie movies, there's The Groaning Drain, Grave Markertown, The Face Burglar, The Fearsome Melody.
4353600	4358600	I mean, those are some pretty well-known of his.
4358600	4369600	And then he also did a couple of cute comic series called Junji Ito's Cat Diary, Yon and Moon, which is about him and his wife and their two cats.
4370600	4371600	Cute.
4371600	4379600	But yeah, it looks like there's going to be a collaboration. And I really hope so, because the two of them together could really do amazing things.
4379600	4385600	Well, you know, this also kind of fans the flames of that rumor that Kojima's next game is a horror game.
4385600	4391600	And I know there's been talk, is it, that he got PT and Silent Hills back? Is it that, or is it something different?
4391600	4394600	I mean, we don't really know. We can speculate forever.
4394600	4405600	But it would seem like if he was trying to work with Ito in these other games, that he would, okay, now I've got a project that's not going to get cancelled because it's under this company.
4405600	4411600	I could come back and, you know, maybe we'll put some of those other ideas we were working on into this new idea, whatever it is.
4411600	4417600	So this definitely kind of fans the flames of Kojima's working on a horror game. We'll see.
4418600	4425600	Well, I do hope that this happens, and I do hope that they work together, because that would be absolutely amazing.
4425600	4433600	Like, I would love to see Uzumaki, but I have snail phobia, so I couldn't see it. Uzumaki is the spirals.
4433600	4444600	Questbuster in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network says, another side note on Junji Ito, World of Horror on Steam is inspired by him.
4444600	4450600	I tried the free version a while back, and it's pretty great if you love Japanese horror or Lovecraftian stuff.
4450600	4453600	So a game recommendation there from Questbuster. Cool.
4453600	4456600	All right, well, let's move on with a few more stories. Loki.
4458600	4460600	Loki, you're muted, Justino.
4461600	4463600	Sorry, my cat kept...
4463600	4465600	Believe me, I understand.
4466600	4469600	It's like, I don't know, she wants attention or something.
4469600	4478600	Anyways, all right, so there's some interesting leaks or rumors regarding some updates they're going to be having to Fortnite.
4479600	4487600	So right now, some more teases that there's going to be drivable vehicles pretty soon in Fortnite, which makes sense because they had boats added in there.
4489600	4496600	So I could see that coming out in a new season or something, but they said, you know, fender bender, no sweat, run out of gas, that's not covered.
4497600	4507600	And they talk about the kind of stuff, you know, like fictional insurance company type thing, but that's, you know, from the actual Fortnite Twitter account as well.
4507600	4519600	And of course, you know, folks have been digging into the actual updates and everything, and there's just finding stuff that's been data mined, hints to vehicles coming.
4519600	4527600	So I'm guessing that's going to be coming pretty soon since apparently, you know, that's...
4528600	4531600	Looks like that's where it's pointing to, so I wouldn't be surprised.
4531600	4535600	Could be interesting to see how that impacts the game, like how protected would you be when you're in a vehicle?
4536600	4540600	You know, is there going to be weaponry that could take you right out of a vehicle or get you killed in the vehicle?
4541600	4544600	I'd be kind of curious how that sort of changes the dynamic of the game.
4544600	4551600	Now, I'm going to fess up, of course, I don't play a lot of Fortnite, but I'd be a fool not to acknowledge what a huge impact it has in the gaming industry.
4552600	4560600	So any little thing that Fortnite does to change up the formula is something that people are going to be talking about, you know, and probably copying.
4561600	4562600	Yeah, definitely.
4563600	4570600	All right, well, moving on to other car-based games and one that I think set a lot of standards in the industry, let's talk about Rocket League.
4570600	4573600	And this is pretty exciting. Rocket League is going to be going free to play.
4574600	4577600	Rocket League will be getting an update later this summer that's going to make it free to play.
4578600	4581600	This was announced in a blog post that was made by Psyonix, who's the developer of the game.
4582600	4587600	This is also going to be bringing Rocket League to the Epic Games Store and will no longer be on Steam.
4588600	4589600	That's pretty interesting.
4590600	4596600	Now, I kind of think of this game, too, and I kind of go, most people, I feel like, got this game for free at some point.
4596600	4605600	Most notably through PlayStation Plus gave it away at one point because I feel like when everybody downloaded that game, that's when this game caught fire.
4606600	4612600	And like so many people got turned on to it and it just really ended up being a runaway success.
4613600	4621600	Obviously, a lot of that is just the strength of the game itself and the fact that Rocket League plays like a familiar yet a very new type of sport where it's like,
4621600	4627600	it's soccer, but it's with cars, or it's all sorts of other games, but with cars.
4628600	4632600	Anyway, so now even more people are going to get to try this out thanks to a free to play update.
4633600	4641600	It will also support cross-platform progression, so your inventory and competitive rankings will be under a unified Epic Games account.
4642600	4643600	That's also very interesting to note.
4644600	4648600	So will you log into that account on the other platforms? It sounds like you might be.
4648600	4653600	Now, if you already own the game on Steam, you'll still be able to launch and play from Steam.
4654600	4660600	So you're not going to be robbed of your game or anything or of any of the updates, but they're just no longer going to actively sell it on Steam.
4661600	4667600	Also, the tournaments will change and the reward challenges will change and there'll be some bonus cosmetics.
4668600	4672600	I imagine if it's going free to play, they want to start to make a little more money off of those cosmetics.
4672600	4676600	Plus, it's probably one of those things where the game's been out for a little while now.
4677600	4682600	I feel like it's been out for three or four years, so it's probably just kind of run its course on how many units it's actually going to sell.
4683600	4687600	And maybe now if we go to free to play, we can still kind of get some money through some different outlets.
4688600	4690600	But you know what? Rocket League is still a strong game.
4691600	4698600	I believe it has its own convention because I know our voiceover guy, Jason, really into Rocket League and was that a thing last year,
4699600	4701600	which obviously I'm sure isn't happening this year because of all the COVID stuff.
4702600	4710600	But yeah, this game is a sport all of its own and this game is something that's probably going to be covered on the new G4.
4711600	4716600	It could probably have its own sports show, quite honestly, and we'll see where that ends up.
4717600	4719600	So now everybody can play it for free.
4720600	4725600	Alright, moving on. Dark Sakura, we had a game, I remember talking about this game a month ago,
4726600	4729600	but there's been a lot that's kind of happened with this, right?
4729600	4736600	Yeah, it looks like so. We talked before about a game that's supposed to help with ADHD,
4737600	4743600	attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and they're looking at this game.
4744600	4755600	You know, it's being marketed as a way to help children focus and, you know, do little type of cognitive training to help.
4755600	4763600	So they can prescribe the game, a doctor scan, by giving the kids or giving their parents a code to download the app.
4764600	4766600	It's called EndeavorRx.
4767600	4772600	But there are some critics who are pretty much stepping out against this,
4773600	4780600	including one clinical psychologist named Russell Barkley, who has authored several ADHD books,
4780600	4787600	and he and three other experts reviewed Achilles, the company's research,
4788600	4795600	and said that they were over-promising by implying that they can provide meaningful help for the children struggling in school and at home.
4796600	4801600	And they're talking about on the level of near debilitating neurodevelopmental disorders.
4802600	4812600	And one of the people, Mark Rapport, who is the head of the Children's Learning Clinic at the University of Central Florida,
4813600	4814600	I'm just going to read the quote.
4815600	4821600	I'm a little shocked and more perplexed about why the FDA would approve this and allow it to be paid for by insurance.
4822600	4825600	I abhor seeing desperate parents spend money based on empty promises.
4826600	4833600	On moral grounds, I think it's wrong to tell people to get their doctors to prescribe this when it does nothing of real-world importance.
4836600	4842600	Yeah, and looking at the trailer for that, I mean, the game looks like the most generic of basic,
4843600	4846600	like an endless runner type of game.
4847600	4852600	I mean, I can't imagine how that would be any different from, say, anything that's on the App Store right now.
4852600	4862600	I don't see how this would differentiate itself and be classified as like actual treatment when any of these other games could easily, it's exactly the same.
4863600	4869600	And the company's study was basically saying, and they published it in The Lancet, which is a peer-reviewed journal,
4870600	4874600	found that 36% of children who played the game for 25 minutes a day, five days a week for a month,
4875600	4880600	no longer had a deficit of attention that was measurable.
4880600	4889600	But to quote Barkley, again, the effects just don't generalize. You get better at playing the game and anything similar to playing the game.
4890600	4892600	So really, it's just repetition.
4893600	4904600	And it's, the studies that have gone out and one of them, there was software invented by Adam, I'm going to mispronounce it,
4904600	4911600	Gazali, who's a neuroscientist at UC San Francisco, he's a board member now for Achilles.
4912600	4916600	And they've done five studies and one of them is unpublished.
4917600	4921600	And they were all either wholly or partially funded by Achilles.
4922600	4925600	So we're starting, I think it is very suspect.
4926600	4930600	I mean, it would be great if a game could help kids with cognitive therapy.
4930600	4941600	But I don't really, I'm feeling more and more skeptical.
4942600	4956600	And another thing that when they did the studies, they were warned that their results were not sufficient enough to have the game listed as a replacement for more established treatments.
4957600	4967600	And they had excluded children taking ADHD medication or who had an additional quote, significant psychiatric problem.
4968600	4977600	The authors did disclose that they found a difference between parents' assessments of the children and the control group who played a computerized word game.
4977600	4986600	So it's really, I don't know, I'm really skeptical of it.
4987600	4999600	And of course, there's also now parents who have children with ADHD, though, who are finding that their children are becoming obsessed with the video games they're playing on a level of addiction.
4999600	5005600	And, you know, serotonin is a good thing, dopamine is a good thing, you know, playing those games affect that.
5006600	5013600	So I think that I'm really, really skeptical.
5014600	5021600	And I mean, it's the same reason I think that people are so quick to try naturopathic methods.
5022600	5024600	They don't want to think of their children being medicated.
5024600	5032600	But what they don't understand, and I can vouch for this personally as an autistic person, the medications are prescribed for a reason.
5033600	5041600	Some of us need to have adjustments to our neurochemistry, plain and simple, or else we cannot function.
5042600	5043600	I cannot function off of my meds.
5044600	5057600	And I understand people don't want their kids to be on this, but at the same time, you know, putting a video game out there when there are better therapies for these children.
5058600	5067600	I mean, yeah, if the game will supplement what they're doing, then as a supplement, that's fine, you know, but not as a replacement.
5068600	5071600	Let me get to some comments from chat over at twitch.tv slash avog network.
5072600	5077600	Bobby Blackwolf says that the differentiation in the game is all the distractions that come in.
5078600	5083600	The things in the trailer to notice is that they have distraction elements all around specifically to distract.
5084600	5090600	So the treatment is to be able to focus on the endless runner portion and not always get distracted by the elements that are flying around.
5091600	5093600	Note, I'm not a doctor, I just read up on it.
5093600	5099600	And that it is intended to be played in a clinic with supervision from the doctor, not intended to be played at home.
5100600	5101600	It's to be a supplement.
5102600	5109600	Marissa in chat says, I did an ADHD test on a computer and I was worried I was going to ace it out of sheer gaming skills and misrepresent my test results.
5110600	5111600	Nope, still have ADD.
5112600	5120600	And continues, it's like those brain training apps that are popular, but repeatedly shown by studies to not be as effective as the claims.
5120600	5124600	Oh, very interesting comparison there with things like brain training.
5125600	5134600	I mean, those games sure are kind of fun and it feels like, you know, like, oh, I have this kind of like creative outlet and I'm unleashing this creative energy or what have you.
5135600	5140600	But is it really like, is it like a, is it really expanding your brain?
5141600	5143600	No, it's not doing any of that stuff.
5143600	5151600	It's just like, oh, it's, you know, a different way to kind of stimulate different parts of your brain that might not be getting it otherwise.
5152600	5162600	Yeah, but it's not teaching any cognitive, any cognitive real therapy. It's just teaching you to play a game. It's a distraction.
5163600	5171600	Kronos Ode in our, Kronos Ode in chat says, I have ADHD gaming has been used for me as a supplement to other treatments.
5172600	5177600	So, um, and Marissa says, I'm being generous there. You learned to ace the game, not cognitive skills.
5178600	5179600	Yeah, I think Marissa and I were thinking along the same lines.
5180600	5186600	Yeah, I think so. All right. Well, um, it sounds like this is a very controversial thing, this game in the medicine world.
5187600	5190600	I think this is not the last time we're going to hear about this, so we'll keep our eye on it.
5190600	5203600	It, it also tried to do the same thing for, for autistic people. And for the record, I do not use person first language with that simply because you're not like, I'm not a person with autism.
5204600	5209600	I am autistic. It is a part of me and it is not separate from me. I don't like put it in my person, take it with me where I go.
5209600	5220600	Um, but that being said, there's been, they tried to do some similar therapies like that for, uh, people on the spectrum and to, to very little effect.
5221600	5227600	Only some people really see any kind of benefit from it. Um, just saying, you know.
5228600	5235600	Well, let's move on you guys. We've got a lot more news to cover before we get to our classic game of the week. So Loki.
5236600	5244600	So one of the games, like I said, I was playing is a brand new Paper Mario, the Origami King. Well, apparently there is a game breaking bug in the game.
5245600	5255600	Um, kind of in the middle of the game in this area called the Shangri spa, you get this rainbow VIP pass, which allows you to get into a special area of the game, the spring of rainbows.
5255600	5266600	And apparently if, uh, you leave the area, uh, after visiting the bouncer who takes the pass, you can't get it back. And so you're stuck and can't finish the game.
5267600	5271600	So it's pretty bad that there's this bug that it could possibly break everything. Oh, I guess.
5272600	5277600	Although if you've been used to playing games like Skyrim, you know, there's lots of game requests in that as well.
5277600	5289600	Um, no word on when Intel is going to patch this, but I mean, they've, they're going to have to, obviously, since it's pretty massive bug that allows you to, um, actually have to restart the whole game to get through it. So.
5291600	5294600	Well, I just have to be careful then when I get to that point,
5295600	5303600	as you point out though, um, you know, they're not the first company to have, like, you know, if you align things a certain way, you're going to bork your whole game.
5304600	5312600	Like, I feel like, I feel like this was just recently out there with a recent release. Was it like final fantasy seven remake? I don't want to falsely accuse a game, but there was like another game that had recently come out.
5313600	5321600	It probably was a Bethesda game where like, again, if, if the stars aligned a certain way, you could screw yourself out of beating the game and you'd be stuck and have to start over.
5322600	5329600	So it's just not often we hear it coming out of Nintendo's camp because usually, you know, those games are tested so well and everything's really rock solid.
5330600	5334600	Yeah. So, well, I hope that doesn't happen to me. That would suck.
5335600	5345600	Well, well now you know what not to do. All right. Hey, so more protection coming out for the PlayStation four, although there already is like a two factor authentication.
5346600	5357600	I know, cause I turned mine on. But you, you get like text messages through it. PlayStation and Sony are actually going to be expanding that as part of the 8.0 system update for PlayStation four.
5358600	5368600	Some of the users that are participating in it have noticed that you can actually use other authentication, authenticating apps from the app store through Apple or Google play.
5368600	5376600	I would imagine things like Authy, Google authenticator, and some of the big apps that are already out there. Like, you know, Twitch supports a lot of these as well.
5377600	5382600	Hell Nintendo, a lot of that runs through Google authenticator. So PlayStation is going to go this route as well.
5383600	5391600	And this actually seems to be for an 8.0 release. This is kind of the big deal about it. There's some other minor things they're saying, but this is another thing.
5391600	5398600	Hey, if it makes more people sign up for two factor authentication, then I think it's a great thing because something I learned over the weekend.
5399600	5405600	And just on a personal note, I had mentioned some of the things that were going on with my dad a couple weeks ago on this show that he had had a stroke.
5406600	5412600	And luckily I called the ambulance on him and he got taken in. He just finished up physical rehab and he was discharged on Thursday.
5412600	5419600	I went to visit him on Saturday and things are looking pretty good that he's going to make a pretty darn good recovery.
5420600	5423600	So I'm really, really thankful for that and really thankful for all the good vibes you all were sending.
5424600	5432600	But I do bring that up because I learned firsthand while I was over there visiting is that he got himself kind of like locked out of his Microsoft account.
5433600	5439600	And he couldn't get a text message to authenticate because he doesn't pay for a text messaging plan. He doesn't have any text messages.
5439600	5448600	But if he had an authenticator app, he could probably use it that way, although I would not expect him to necessarily know how to do all that.
5449600	5453600	He just wants to use his computer, do his genealogy projects. He doesn't want to do anything that fancy on there.
5454600	5461600	So yeah, this will be another way for people to protect their accounts and I think that will be a very, very good thing.
5461600	5469600	SHO 100 Matt in Chat says, as a special reminder, always sign up for two-factor auth. Strong. Agree.
5470600	5480600	I mean, there may be reasons that are stopping you, such as limited text or whatever, but consider apps, consider, you know, physical key fobs even if you have to.
5481600	5487600	There's lots of other ways to two-factor auth. Please, please, if nothing else, secure your bank account and your email account.
5487600	5494600	Because your bank account is your money and everything else resets through your email. So at least, for the love of God, get those done.
5495600	5503600	Alright. CrystalSykes80 or Skye, excuse me, CrystalSykes. Sorry, I don't know why. Sometimes I read these names so fast, guys. Sorry.
5504600	5510600	And plus, I can't control the colors that are showing up and some of them are dark colors on a dark background and that doesn't help me. So sorry, guys.
5510600	5518600	So CrystalSykes80 in Chat says, I have a two-factor authenticator on my two-factor authenticator. Hey, that's the ultimate in production.
5519600	5529600	Alright, let's move on and let's go back to a classic time when we didn't have to worry about authentication because not everything was connected online.
5530600	5534600	It's a classic segment we like to call the Classic Game of the Week.
5535600	5547600	So DarkSakura is going to step into the gaming vault and she's going to find a game that, hey, forget all these newfangled next-gen things we were talking about at the top of the show. Play this classic instead.
5548600	5550600	So DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?
5551600	5559600	The Classic Game of the Week is Red Earth, which I was actually surprised that I haven't done before because I've talked about characters from it.
5560600	5568600	And then I realized it was Cyberbots that I did. So yeah, Red Earth, also known in Japan as Warzord.
5569600	5579600	It is a fantasy sword and sorcery 2D fighting game developed by Capcom and was released in the arcades in 1996.
5580600	5589600	It was the first game for Capcom CP System 3 hardware, the same hardware that Street Fighter 3 and later versions came out on.
5590600	5596600	It is a fairly common game in Japan, but had very minimal distribution overseas.
5596600	5609600	It is the only, to date, CPS3 game that has never been officially ported to home platforms, though, like I said, characters appeared in other games and have been playable in other crossover games.
5610600	5617600	The artwork for it was done by some of the same people who worked on Darkstalkers, the Night Warriors.
5617600	5644600	A couple of other little things about Red Earth is that it is one of those games that has this neat password feature in it so that you can play the game later on the same skill level that you reached on your one character in your quest mode.
5644600	5660600	So you actually do get experience points in battle. That's if you do either versus, or I think, what's the word I'm thinking of? The story mode, the quest mode.
5661600	5677600	And so with this one, you have your vitality gauge for each of the computer-controlled characters. You get that at the bottom of the screen and it's bigger than your own gauge.
5677600	5691600	So as you land hits on your appointments, coins and treasure chests come out and collecting the coins gives you experience points and then you can use the items in the treasure chest like the orbs for super moves or food to replenish your vitality.
5691600	5707600	And it makes it work a little bit more like a side-scrolling game, but it's a fighter. On top of this, it is one of the few Capcom games that includes a fatality system.
5707600	5722600	I don't know if they were trying to compete with Mortal Kombat for this one, but Darkstalkers tries to make it more comedic, but Red Earth is more realistic.
5722600	5734600	So like splitting your opponent in half or decapitation or artery rupture or limb slicing or organ removal or all kinds of other gutting, but it is a really beautiful game.
5734600	5747600	It takes place in 1999, first of all, in the Japanese version, on an alternate earth that's stuck in a mythological, medieval, fantasy kind of state.
5747600	5757600	And there's a country that's being led by Blade who's sending out monsters to take over the world and you have four heroes who have to defend it.
5757600	5770600	In the Western version, it takes place in 13XX and shows an earth where there was no industrial revolution or renaissance that progressed the world forward.
5770600	5782600	So your main characters is that you have Leo, who is a giant lion man. He is a 35 year old king.
5782600	5792600	Then you have Kenji, as he was in the US. In Japan, he was called Mukuro, who is like our kind of ninja dude.
5792600	5805600	We have Tessa in the US or Tabasa, who we got in Pocket Fighter, remember? And also she's great because she has four cats who she fights with her cats.
5805600	5806600	My kind of girl.
5806600	5811600	And her cats are also cards in SNK vs Capcom Card Fighters Clash.
5811600	5820600	And she has a bird named Hato and her frog, Kairu, which means frog, and a dragon spirit called Mano.
5820600	5834600	Also, the last character is called Myling, who's in Japan. She's called Tao, who is actually one of the few characters that hasn't made too much of an appearance in any other game.
5834600	5845600	So yeah, it's a very, very interesting fighting game. I would love to have some kind of home release on this. You hear me, Capcom? Do it!
5845600	5856600	And it's just pretty neat. It's beautiful, is what it is. I mean, it's not hard to see where Street Fighter 3 came from with this one.
5856600	5872600	And of course, for your bad guys, you've got a fossil character. You have a merchant who was changed into an oni, like a demon.
5872600	5879600	You know, you have a character that's half Kraken. I mean, it's pretty, pretty amazing fantasy.
5879600	5891600	And of course, the soundtrack was released, composed by EY Takayuki, with help from Yamamoto Ryoji and Hashisako Wataru.
5891600	5896600	Some of the tracks were reused in Capcom Fighting Evolution, although downgraded a little bit.
5896600	5902600	They did two books about the game in Japan. One was called All About Warzord, that looked into the creation of the game.
5902600	5909600	So that's concept art, screenshots, different details about the game, technically and musically.
5909600	5918600	And then the other one was Gamest number 65 Warzord, which is an unofficial book by Gamest and has a fan art section.
5918600	5931600	There is a Darkstalkers Red Earth crossover manga called Maleficarum. It was published in Japan in 1997 and had a release by Udon Comics in 2010.
5931600	5940600	And then, of course, Capcom also released figurines from it. And I mean, so now we get on to the legacy of the game.
5941600	5954600	Tessa, also Tabasa, was in SNK vs. Capcom SBC Chaos Super Gem Fighter, and she had a cameo in Leo's ending in Capcom Fighting Jam.
5954600	5960600	She was also in Dr. Strange's ending for Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
5960600	5968600	Leo is a playable character in Capcom Fighting Jam, and he appeared in Hawkeye's ending in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
5968600	5978600	Kenji was also playable in Capcom Fighting Jam. He has a character called Heroes and Heralds in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
5978600	5990600	Myling hasn't appeared in anything like I said, although she did appear in Pyron and Leo's endings in Capcom Fighting Jam and is one of Tabasa's defenses in Pocket Fighter.
5990600	6000600	So we've had all kinds of different other characters, like GG and other characters appeared in PTX-40A's ending in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
6000600	6004600	So yeah, just keep your eyes open and they show up again.
6004600	6012600	And actually, another funny thing, if you've ever played Dragon's Dogma, there's a piece of armor called the Cursed King's Belt, with the description,
6012600	6022600	a belt worn by an eliminator, the relic of the king who is cursed to live as a lion. It boosts the wearer's ability to stagger his opponent, so it was a reference to Leo.
6022600	6030600	So yeah, it is a gloriously beautiful game. I sorely wish we would have a release of it.
6030600	6040600	So, for right now, there are ways of playing it, and then, um, yeah, I didn't tell you that.
6040600	6044600	So, isn't it pretty?
6044600	6053600	It is a very good looking game, and I have to admit it's one I haven't really played before, so I'm glad you brought it up. You're right, Capcom needs to put this out.
6054600	6072600	Yeah, and the animation in it, I mean, you can really, and this is actually one of the things that I enjoy about just watching this game, is that the fluidity in the animation, you can absolutely see where it came in as going into the influence for Street Fighter.
6072600	6079600	So, I'm down for it. The game is pretty awesome, and Capcom needs to bring it to us at home.
6079600	6081600	Alright, I can agree with that.
6081600	6086600	For the record, I forgot to say that I did get another game this week.
6086600	6087600	Oh, what's that?
6087600	6093600	When I did my class. I got Sega Ages Fantasy Zone for the Sega Saturn.
6093600	6100600	Oh, I just went back to the main show shot, and there's Kitty licking Loki there. It's adorable.
6100600	6103600	But then I stopped killing him for like the last ten minutes, so.
6103600	6105600	She just wanted to come give you kisses.
6105600	6108600	I don't know where the Petittles is. She's fucked off somewhere.
6108600	6111600	I tried to get Smoosh. Smoosh was in here earlier when Delvin was here.
6111600	6112600	I heard him.
6112600	6121600	Yeah, I tried to get him up on the couch, but he wouldn't do it. We did move his basket, so Smoosh's basket is in the hallway now, because he does use it. So, it's pretty crazy. Anyway, it's adorable.
6121600	6123600	So, Darth Sockra, thank you as always.
6123600	6124600	Kitty.
6124600	6136600	Thank you as always. I know you have to head out for the last time early. Well, for now. But thank you, of course, for being here. You looked marvelous, and good luck, and we'll see you in a week.
6136600	6137600	Do you have any last-
6137600	6138600	See y'all later.
6138600	6140600	Do you have any last thoughts for our listeners before you hang up?
6140600	6145600	Um, um, uh, words.
6145600	6146600	Okay, good enough.
6146600	6153600	Oh, also, congrats to Shay Cooley, just saying. Even though I was Team Cracker, congrats.
6154600	6171600	I agree. I was Team any of them. They're all wonderful, but it is nice to see Shay get, you know, like a prize after Season 9. Yeah, I'm trying to think of the right word, but like, you know, because I don't want to, you know, devalue Sasha's win, but at the same time, it's like-
6171600	6173600	Oh, Sasha did earn it.
6173600	6177600	Yeah, Shay really deserves something. So, all right. Anyway.
6177600	6180600	And also, Andina is adorable, and I want to carry her in my pocket.
6180600	6183600	All right. All right. Bye, Jamie.
6183600	6184600	Bye.
6184600	6194600	Thanks. Bye. All right. Let's get into some rapid fire news. So, Loki, if you're able to put the kitty down, let's go to some rapid fire news.
6194600	6206600	Yeah. So, one of the movies that I liked was actually a surprise to like, I mean, I guess I would have liked it anyways because Jim Carrey's in it, but Sonic the Hedgehog, and that came out earlier.
6207600	6218600	So, they have finally announced, because it was a pretty successful movie, that the sequel is coming in April 2022, or to be exact, April 8th, 2022.
6218600	6225600	So, yeah, I can't wait for that movie to finally come out and to check out what they do with it.
6225600	6233600	It's lots of exciting possibilities with that movie, especially with all the teases at the end. So, I'm very much looking forward to that.
6234600	6235600	All right.
6235600	6254600	And then, since we talked about the whole protest last week with Red Dead and the clown costumes and whatnot, it's kind of funny, though, that right now we finally got the update that there is going to be a brand new update to Red Dead Online out July 28th.
6255600	6260600	So, it's going to be huge, and it's going to be coming out right around the corner.
6260600	6266600	And I guess maybe they heard the protests and are finally making some announcements about it or moving up their announcements.
6266600	6274600	But they didn't say exactly what they're going to be adding to that right now, but I guess we'll get the details coming pretty soon.
6274600	6278600	So, we'll just say that those protests work then.
6280600	6283600	I apologize to the podcast listeners who can't see the video.
6284600	6287600	Can we just take a minute to... No, no, no.
6287600	6303600	It's an extra special treat for those that are either subscribed to our Twitch channel and able to access the video archive or here with us live just to see your cat licking your beard and grooming you as you're trying to do the news so professionally.
6303600	6306600	Let's just take a minute to appreciate cats.
6306600	6313600	I know some of y'all are allergic or have other reasons for maybe not caring for them, but I guess maybe pets in general, though.
6313600	6316600	Let's just take a moment to appreciate pets.
6316600	6322600	She does this all day. She knows when I'm on calls and everything with my work and everything.
6322600	6327600	She'll come and she'll just stand there and just like, meow, meow, meow, like the entire time.
6327600	6328600	Smoosh does the same thing.
6328600	6329600	Stop it.
6329600	6334600	But Smoosh doesn't do that. Smoosh doesn't do what Stella's doing to you right now, so he doesn't do that.
6334600	6346600	She's just happy because I trimmed the beard, so it's not as long before when she tried to cuddle or whatever, it would poke her in the ear and kind of tickle her or smash her in the face.
6346600	6348600	And so now that Shorts is like, oh, OK, cool.
6348600	6353600	All right. Well, while the cat grooms you, let me try to get a couple stories of my own here.
6353600	6358600	So let's talk about Overcooked. Overcooked, the all you can eat edition.
6358600	6360600	That's right. It's a repackaging of the Overcooked games.
6360600	6366600	It's the first two games and all the DLC, that's 200 kitchens for you to get mad at your friends about.
6366600	6370600	That's going to be coming out for PlayStation five and Xbox Series X.
6370600	6374600	And obviously, a lot of people are I've played the Overcooked games.
6374600	6384600	J.D., who I haven't seen in chat for a while, but, you know, before all this social distancing stuff happened and I was visiting him once in a while, usually Overcooked would get launched at some point.
6384600	6387600	And I had I had no idea what the hell I was doing in that game.
6387600	6393600	So I was just like, I'll just sit here and wash dishes. I'm going to do one thing and I'm going to do it well.
6393600	6403600	But that game is a lot of fun and getting to interact with people and also getting really mad at your friends when the stage starts like floating and splitting in two and knowing all this crazy stuff.
6403600	6408600	4K resolution and 60 frames a second for the all you can eat edition. That's pretty cool.
6408600	6413600	And if you weren't already aware, Mixer's last day was this week.
6413600	6422600	And what's kind of interesting is that a lot of the people that were streaming on on Mixer the last day were plugging their Twitch accounts.
6422600	6428600	You may remember Mixer actually was creating a bridge to Facebook gaming.
6428600	6431600	But I think a lot of the bridge known once across. Exactly right.
6431600	6438600	Now, there are some to be fair, there are some people who have decided to take stock in Facebook gaming.
6438600	6443600	And good luck. May the odds be ever in your favor and so forth.
6443600	6451600	And I don't want I don't want to talk again. I really don't like Facebook gaming, but has nothing to do with the content creators.
6451600	6455600	So if that's what you've chosen for you in the path for you, I wish you well. I do.
6455600	6459600	I won't be watching because I don't support Facebook and I don't think they should be getting into this business.
6459600	6464600	I'm not going to support them in this business. But, you know, again, I wish you well.
6464600	6468600	I know it sounds like I'm being an ass. Maybe I am a little bit, but yeah.
6468600	6471600	But for those that are making their way over to Twitch, welcome.
6471600	6476600	I hope you're doing OK and getting establishing yourself here and all that good stuff.
6476600	6481600	So, you know, good luck. Some folks in comments, it's tough starting over.
6481600	6486600	One Mixer broadcaster said in a farewell on Mixer, I had 42000 followers.
6486600	6488600	All of a sudden you have to start over.
6488600	6493600	And I think that's something we always kind of have to keep in the back of our minds with a lot of this stuff is that we never know
6493600	6497600	when one day the plug might get pulled. And that goes for Twitch as well.
6497600	6503600	Although Twitch has been doing pretty well thus far, even less people know who we are.
6503600	6508600	Yeah. Right. All right. So, hey, a special guest wanted to come join us.
6508600	6511600	Why not? We had a special guest earlier in the show.
6511600	6517600	So why not bring another special guest on tonight? Because since we've been talking about, you know,
6517600	6522600	the news and all this stuff, we're going to bring on a special guest here who does not have a webcam.
6522600	6528600	So you get the picture of Smoosh instead. So I believe Shane is there on Discord.
6528600	6530600	Yes, I should be. Hello.
6530600	6534600	And they're saying, we see Mr. Smoosh. We don't see Shane. Well, Shane doesn't have a webcam anyway.
6534600	6536600	And you'd probably rather look at Mr. Smoosh.
6536600	6542600	So, yeah, I was out in the sun all day and I walked like another eight miles today.
6542600	6548600	So I am disgusting looking and everything hurts. So you don't want to put up with that anyway.
6548600	6552600	Real quickly, how was Pokémon GO Fest day two for you?
6552600	6556600	Better than yesterday. Still not worth $15.
6556600	6562600	All right. Now, you texted me mid-show, as you sometimes do with your angry feedback about the show.
6562600	6570600	But for once, I actually felt it was justified because there's a very important piece of news that we haven't talked about yet on the show.
6570600	6575600	And it's actually not coming up in Part B either. And I know this is something very near and dear for you.
6575600	6579600	And when you texted me, I was like, oh, shit, yeah, we really should talk about that.
6579600	6581600	So, Shane, what do you want to talk about?
6581600	6596600	I want to talk about the newly announced game slash Kickstarter for the spiritual successor to the Suikoden series called Eiuden Chronicle.
6598600	6601600	And what would you... Tell us more about it.
6601600	6602600	And that's it.
6602600	6604600	And that's it. The end. Goodbye.
6604600	6614600	That's it. So, everybody should know, that knows me, that I'm a huge rabid Suikoden fan.
6614600	6620600	I have every game, even the dumb card game on Game Boy Advance.
6620600	6625600	I worked on the fifth game, which was one of the best things I've ever done in my life.
6625600	6630600	I was going to say, I'm pretty sure we're able to openly talk about the fact that you actually worked on the series.
6630600	6634600	So, you kind of went literally as far as you can go as a fan.
6634600	6646600	Yeah, basically. And there hasn't really been a... There hasn't been a new game in the proper series in, I think it's 14 years.
6646600	6652600	And there was a couple spin-offs that one of them didn't even leave Japan. So, it's like, whatever.
6652600	6664600	And so, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, the story writer for the first, second, and third, even though he wasn't credited,
6664600	6672600	the story writer for the first, second, and third Suikoden games, and a few other people that have been involved in the series,
6672600	6680600	like the character designer for one and four, they got together and created their own video game studio
6680600	6687600	and announced this, like I said, spiritual successor to the Suikoden series, Kickstarter goes live tomorrow.
6687600	6696600	And it looks amazing. It's supposed to harken back to the PS1 JRPG era and what they've shown off so far.
6696600	6702600	There's a trailer supposedly coming tomorrow as well, but they have a little clip of the battle system.
6702600	6712600	And it looks like your standard six-person battle system that Suikoden uses, plus an Octopath traveler design.
6712600	6716600	And it is gorgeous. And I am so excited.
6716600	6720600	But with less lens flare, I thought it actually looked better than Octopath, really.
6720600	6731600	It looks a lot better than Octopath because the Octopath sprites, they look very much like Super NES style sprites, like the 16-bit era.
6731600	6737600	And this definitely goes to the PS1 where they're a little more detailed, less blocky.
6737600	6741600	And there's a lot of different features they're adding.
6741600	6747600	It sounds like they're pulling a lot from the original Suikoden games in terms of battle.
6747600	6751600	You get a castle that you upgrade.
6751600	6758600	Its subtitle is 100 Heroes, and so we assume there's going to be like 100 people you can recruit.
6758600	6764600	Suikoden is famous for having 108 characters in every game you can recruit.
6764600	6775600	But in this one, they said during battles, if you cast an earthquake spell, it will change the landscape of the battle.
6775600	6778600	Geomancer confirmed.
6778600	6784600	They said if you are in a forest and there's trees and you have a ninja character, they can hide behind the trees.
6784600	6787600	So I don't know what that's all about, but I'm excited.
6787600	6796600	I'm so pumped up, and the Kickstarter goes up tomorrow at 9 a.m. Pacific.
6796600	6803600	So even that quick, and SHO and Hunter Matt, for those of you that are live or watching the archive, just linked the YouTube there.
6803600	6809600	And it's like a six-second clip, but I'm not as huge on Suikoden as Shane is.
6809600	6817600	But I appreciate it, and I must admit, I've never beaten it, but I've played a lot of hours on Part 1 and 2.
6817600	6821600	And it looks gorgeous, and it just fits right into that mold.
6821600	6827600	And I feel like this is going to be, for Suikoden, what Bloodstained was for Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
6827600	6832600	Almost like these two games are kind of cut out of a very similar mold, right?
6832600	6840600	Well, yeah, and a couple things about that. First, I want to just address what SSJ100Matt says in the chat about it being two years away.
6840600	6848600	So they're targeting PC to start, and if they meet their goal of only $500,000, that is their goal.
6848600	6850600	They'll get that easy, yeah.
6850600	6860600	Yeah, they are going to have a stretch goal for PS5, Xbox Series X, and whatever the next Nintendo Switch is, if it's like a Switch 2.
6860600	6867600	But they did say that if there is no new Nintendo system, they will work to get this working on Nintendo Switch.
6867600	6871600	I guess it's too powerful for that.
6871600	6874600	Crap, I forgot what I was going to say.
6874600	6880600	Well, then let me read another comment from chat. Bobby Blackwell says, if it's only $500,000, then they have in their funding.
6880600	6885600	Yeah, so that gets me back on track.
6885600	6890600	With what you were saying, like how Bloodstained was like the new Castlevania.
6890600	6899600	Rumor has it is that, yes, they have other funding, and they are working with Igarashi to put this out.
6899600	6908600	So that's kind of cool. It's another former Capcom, or Capcom, Konami. I don't even know companies anymore.
6908600	6910600	Who did you work for?
6910600	6914600	Square Enix. I don't know at this point. I'm so dead from today.
6914600	6921600	But I'm so hyped for this Kickstarter, so I need to get it out there as much as possible.
6921600	6929600	I feel like we're going to have a lot of answers. I could do some more forecasting, but I feel like by the time many of our folks hear this on the podcast feed,
6929600	6934600	that Kickstarter will already be up, and we'll have some of these answers, so I don't want to speculate too much.
6934600	6940600	But I do expect you'll probably be back next week to tell us all why we should be donating to the Kickstarter.
6940600	6944600	Or I would love to hear if there was a shocking twist and you're like, ooh, I didn't donate.
6944600	6957600	Well, I was talking to one of my friends who's also a big fan. I was like, I think we need to remortgage the house so I can do the best backer tier I can get on this Kickstarter.
6958600	6968600	What if one of the tiers was like you get to be one of the hundred heroes? That would be so cool, and Dustin would be very mad, but I would do that.
6968600	6973600	Would you do you, or would you do Miklotov, who you were on VR feed?
6973600	6979600	I couldn't use him. He's a Sweetcoat N2 character. That's probably a big no-no.
6979600	6981600	Yeah, you're right.
6982600	6987600	There was one other thing I was going to say, and I keep getting distracted.
6987600	6992600	Haven't you thought of emailing and going, remember me? I worked on the fifth game?
6992600	7000600	No, because they're not with Konami, and these people that are part of the studio didn't work on five.
7000600	7008600	But there's already a story synopsis, which sounds a lot like Sweetcoat N2, so everybody's happy.
7008600	7017600	They have the main character out there, and they have six more supporting characters, and the art is really, really nice.
7017600	7028600	And the title art for what you would assume the cover would be looks just like a Sweetcoat N game, down to the cool, fancy frame around the characters in the background.
7028600	7031600	It just made me so happy when this got announced.
7031600	7035600	Well, I'm sure we'll be talking to you again next week about this.
7035600	7042600	I'm going to talk about it every day to anybody that will listen or won't listen. I don't care. I'll just talk at them.
7042600	7044600	Who follows you on Twitter, all right.
7044600	7045600	Yes.
7045600	7053600	All right, Shane, rest up. Remember, Aloe Vera's great for a sunburn, and maybe don't walk for two days after that.
7053600	7054600	Oh!
7054600	7055600	Go fast, you did.
7055600	7061600	We have two flights of stairs. It's so hard to get around in the house. I don't think I'm leaving my computer chair.
7061600	7065600	Oh, oh, oh, and one more question, because I'm sure all the listeners want to know.
7065600	7071600	Between day one and day two, total number of new shinies.
7071600	7073600	New shinies or shiny?
7073600	7076600	No, no, no. Total number of shinies caught. Total number of shinies caught.
7076600	7081600	Okay, so I actually took a picture, and so I can count these up real quick.
7081600	7096600	That's easier just to do math. That's 12, 13, 14, 15, 27, and then 33.
7096600	7099600	Wow. Did you get the shiny gibble?
7099600	7110600	No. So I got all the shinies I wanted, except for any gibble line. I didn't get a second tangela, and I did not get a survivor.
7110600	7119600	Everything else I wanted, I got G and O unknowns. I got the non-regionals that we don't, or the regionals we don't normally have.
7119600	7122600	So I'm pretty happy with my shiny haul.
7122600	7132600	Yes, I got the shiny gibble. I got something Shane doesn't have, and I even got two, so I have something to hold over his head for a favor when I need it, so we'll see.
7132600	7137600	And I have two shiny Heatmor. You can have one of those if I can have a gibble.
7137600	7142600	Yeah, Heatmor, yeah. All right, I'm gonna let you go, because we can continue on with the rest of the show.
7143600	7151600	For a change, I appreciate the text message telling me that we're doing it all wrong, because I did want to talk about that Kickstarter tonight, and I forgot.
7151600	7153600	You're welcome.
7153600	7155600	All right, take care, my friend.
7155600	7156600	All right, bye.
7156600	7164600	All right, going back. Let's get into some world release dates. We're gonna travel around the world and check out some games coming out real soon.
7164600	7166600	So, Loki, what's coming out in the US?
7167600	7176600	We have the remake of Destroy All Humans that's coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Stadia. I guess that's a remaster, not so much a remake.
7176600	7182600	Samurai Shodown, the Neo Geo collection on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
7182600	7187600	We have a game called Lost Wing on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7187600	7192600	Doraemon, Story of Seasons on PlayStation 4.
7192600	7200600	Looks like Hakuoki, Shinkai Gensei No Show on Nintendo Switch.

7239600	7245600	And last but not least, also Lost Wing coming out on PC and Nintendo Switch. That's it.
7245600	7251600	Alright, let's talk about Japan and the releases in Japan this week on the Nintendo Switch.
7251600	7254600	Some similar stuff actually to what I was hearing you talk about.
7254600	7257600	eSchool Life comes out in regular and limited edition.
7257600	7264600	That Hakuoki Shinkai Gensei No Show comes out in a regular and limited edition as well.
7264600	7267600	And there's also a game called Yoru Tomosu.
7267600	7273600	And then lastly, Bare Knuckle 4 gets a physical release, special edition and multi-language in Japan.
7273600	7277600	That is Streets of Rage 4, so it's Bare Knuckle 4 over there in Japan.
7277600	7279600	So that is all on the Nintendo Switch.
7279600	7282600	Looking at the PlayStation 4, I expect we'll have some overlap.
7282600	7288600	And yep, we have Fairy Tail, we have eSchool Life, Bare Knuckle 4, of course, Yoru Tomosu.
7288600	7293600	But we also have the ChemCo RPG Selection Volume 4.
7293600	7297600	So another classic collection of ChemCo RPGs coming out in Japan.
7297600	7299600	I'm trying to load to see what's in there.
7299600	7303600	Meanwhile, I'll mention also Doraemon Story of Seasons, also out in Japan.
7303600	7308600	And Root Film is also out on the PlayStation 4 this week.
7308600	7314600	So it looks like in this pack, the ChemCo RPG Selection Volume 4 on the PS4,
7314600	7321600	we have Cronus Arc for Legerior, something like that.
7321600	7323600	And let me see, I'm actually trying to find a list here.
7323600	7328600	Oh, Bonds of the Skies and Monochrome Order.
7328600	7334600	So some varied stuff there in Japan in a repackaged collection there.
7334600	7336600	How about Europe, Loki?
7336600	7341600	In Europe, we've got Skater XL coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7341600	7346600	Destroy All Humans coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
7346600	7350600	We've got Lovecraft's Untold Stories on Nintendo Switch.
7350600	7355600	Streets of Rage 4 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch.
7355600	7359600	Looks like The Persistence on Nintendo Switch.
7359600	7363600	Headmaster Extra Time Edition on PlayStation 4.
7363600	7368600	Deliver Us to the Moon on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
7368600	7372600	Fairy Tail on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.
7372600	7379600	Cat Quest plus Cat Quest 2 Possum Pack on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.
7379600	7381600	And that's it.
7381600	7384600	All right. Let's get to the mailbag.
7384600	7385600	Every week you guys email us.
7385600	7388600	Participate at orangelauntrader.com.
7388600	7391600	And we like to read some emails here on the show.
7391600	7393600	So we have two emails to read tonight.
7393600	7395600	And the first comes to us from Fifth Dream.
7395600	7401600	And this is a short email, but it's important because it's confessing to making a mistake that I made as well.
7401600	7404600	So Fifth Dream's email says,
7404600	7410600	Don't worry, Rob. I didn't know where the problematic Washington football team was from until you said it.
7410600	7413600	If you might remember on last week's show, I confessed.
7413600	7418600	I always thought that when we were talking about Washington's football team, because we had a story about how the name is,
7418600	7425600	because, you know, they had a name that, you know, is no longer really acceptable in 2020 state.
7425600	7429600	It probably wasn't for a long time. But anyway, I digress. You all know what I mean.
7429600	7433600	So I always thought this Washington team was in Washington state.
7433600	7436600	But it turns out it's a Washington. That's how much I follow football.
7436600	7444600	So Fifth Dream is confessing that Fifth Dream also thought that it was not a D.C. related team that was somewhere else.
7444600	7450600	And so the only sport I pay attention to is Sumo, closes that email from Fifth Dream.
7450600	7453600	And SHO 100 Matt says, Well, now they are the Washington football team.
7453600	7458600	And yeah, that is that's come out to not just for EA's, you know, patching it into Madden and all that stuff.
7458600	7462600	But I think they're going to be known as that probably for this whole season or whatever.
7462600	7468600	So until they figure out what the new name is going to be, which Bobby Blackwell is suggesting the Kraken,
7468600	7475600	just like the new the new hockey team, the Seattle Kraken, whose logo looks like Trogdor the Burninator.
7475600	7480600	I'm sure many of you saw this as well. Have you seen the Seattle Kraken logo?
7480600	7483600	It looks like fucking Trogdor. Yeah, it's it's just do that.
7483600	7490600	The Seattle it'll be the Seattle Trogdors. Anyway, burninating the competition.
7490600	7493600	I know that that name really polarizes people.
7493600	7498600	But I got to say, I'm kind of into it just because I want to I want to go to that arena in Seattle.
7498600	7503600	And I want to see obviously once we're past covid and all that stuff, we can go see games in person again.
7503600	7511600	And I want to be there when that big voice comes out, when they get Liam Neeson to come out and say, release the Kraken.
7511600	7515600	And then all the players come out. It'll be great. Anyway.
7516600	7521600	All right, moving on. We have another email tonight from Carl. Hello, Carl.
7521600	7525600	Thank you for the email. And it goes something like this. Hello, LR.
7525600	7529600	I've just started listening again for the first time in around 13 years.
7529600	7534600	Great to see you're still live and rocking and the format is still growing strong.
7534600	7537600	The three of you are a great fit. Well, thank you so much.
7537600	7543600	I love when we get the tweets or the emails like this that are like, I thought you guys stopped this years ago.
7543600	7551600	And I used to listen to this show 10, 15. I said it's a point. I said 20 years ago soon, soon.
7551600	7557600	But yeah, no. Well, welcome back, Carl. Have you considered going to other platforms also?
7557600	7565600	Discord, YouTube, Facebook or Instagram Live? You could definitely reach a bigger audience if it's something you're interested in.
7565600	7572600	That's a great question. And I appreciate that candid feedback. So I've kind of made my stance on Facebook known.
7572600	7581600	I just think Facebook has, there's a lot of negative things that have affected our entire society that Facebook perpetuates.
7581600	7588600	And that is clickbait headlines that aren't necessarily true. And I'm kind of like sick of that type of culture.
7588600	7593600	And that's why I don't even have a personal Facebook anymore. I deactivated it. So I can't say we're going to be on Facebook anytime soon.
7593600	7598600	I mean, we do have a Facebook page, but I'm no longer looking at it.
7598600	7604600	Maybe Loki and Dark Sakura are they're the admins now. But yeah. Oh, I might. Is that why am I getting notifications?
7604600	7610600	You might be. Yeah, I don't know. I did respond to someone earlier this week. They're asking when our show was on.
7610600	7614600	Good job. Take it all because I there to do it. So good. I'm glad. All right.
7614600	7621600	I wondered if we should put out like a YouTube video on Twitter or something like that. It says we've never stopped playing, which would actually be accurate.
7621600	7626600	Oh, my God. That's a great idea. We should when it's safe to do so.
7626600	7632600	We should do it on your DDR machine, because that would be very old school anyway.
7632600	7636600	But but some of these other things that you bring up, we actually do exist on.
7636600	7641600	So discord, we're actually recording over discord due to all the social distancing.
7641600	7647600	And you can join us on our discord. It's vog network dot com slash discord.
7647600	7652600	Again, that's vog network dot com slash discord. And actually, Orange Lounge Radio has a room in there.
7652600	7659600	And there's some great discussion that happens throughout the week. Sometimes we were having a discussion earlier this week on God.
7659600	7666600	Now, of course, I need to think about, oh, it's the G4 revival and all that stuff. And I kind of put my theory about the peacock and all that stuff was in there.
7666600	7672600	A lot of times on our Twitch channel, too, like when the Xbox event was going on, we host it on the vog network twitch.
7672600	7685600	And we'll post a thing about it on discord saying come join us, because that way you can like watch it with like minded chatters and not like a bunch of people trying to spam chat with whatever their dumb things they're saying.
7685600	7694600	So that's always kind of cool, too. So I'd actually encourage you to join us on discord where we do have a presence vog network dot com slash discord, as far as YouTube.
7694600	7705600	So here's the thing. Due to Twitch agreements, we can't because we are a Twitch partner. And there is a part of that agreement that our content has to be exclusive for 24 hours on Twitch.
7705600	7712600	And that's fine. We don't really mind that. So we don't really produce a lot of content right now for YouTube.
7712600	7723600	But I can say I've definitely been thinking about maybe some content that we can premiere on Twitch and trickle down to our YouTube in like, you know, two days after the fact or something like that.
7723600	7732600	So if you aren't following vog network on YouTube, I would get on that. If you want to go hunting as well, Orange Launch Radio does have an old vog network channel.
7732600	7740600	And there are some gems in there, such as there's like a tour of Dark Sakura's vault, and all of her pinball machines. I mean, that clip is probably it was in her old house.
7740600	7751600	So it's probably like seven years old at this point, but it's still it's still interesting to see the world famous news clip, where they showed Loki in his entire interview goes, oh, it's so much fun.
7751600	7758600	And that's the only thing they gave Loki in that entire thing. That is on YouTube as well. It's that clip is so old, too.
7758600	7765600	They talk about Governor Schwarzenegger's podcast. Do you know how fucking long ago that was? That's a long time ago.
7765600	7774600	So but that's all on the Orange Launch Radio YouTube. That's that's the old news. I would say if you're not following vog network on YouTube, get on that.
7774600	7782600	We can't put the whole show on there. But we'll probably use clips and some other stuff there later on.
7782600	7791600	Oh, did I say I'm sorry, Bobby said I said partner. Sorry, I meant affiliate. And there is a big difference between the two. Sorry, as we're a Twitch affiliate, not partner.
7792600	7803600	And then Instagram Live. I'm not sure how to use that appropriately. I'm open to that, like what we can do with that, but it can't be a simulcast of the show.
7803600	7817600	If you have ideas, I'm open to it. So let me know. But also Instagram is kind of tied to Facebook. And so I'm a little bit like, but I also know, you know, there's a whole different you're right, there's a whole different audience on IGTV and that stuff that isn't here.
7817600	7826600	And so it might be a little smarter to like try to do some advertising there or try to do some like a side project or something. But I haven't even really thought about what that would look like.
7826600	7840600	All right. Moving on with Carl's email. Being a UK listener, your live times are a bit late for me. Two a.m. Monday morning. Yeah, sorry. Time zones. But the podcasts are great. And we're going to continue to do them until the show is done.
7840600	7852600	I hope you guys are well and staying safe with COVID. Carl, thank you very much for that email, Carl, and some good ideas. Thank you. Thank you. Some multiple folks in chat suggesting an Instagram Live Mr. Smoosh cam.
7852600	7866600	Mr. Smoosh has his own Instagram account. Cheap plug. It's at Mr. spelled out. So it's M-I-S-T-E-R Smoosh. All one word on Instagram. So Mr. Smoosh actually has his own account. So you can check that out. Cheap plug.
7867600	7873600	All right. Let's move on. We have some more news to get to. Loki, why don't you bring us back to some gaming news.
7873600	7893600	All right. So we talked a little bit about some of the allegations with Ubisoft last week and all these people coming out and speaking about them and how some of the upper executives have been let go or have put on leave or whatever the case may be.
7893600	7905600	Well, that got, of course, the investors asking questions saying, so what did Yves Guimant know and when did he know it?
7905600	7911600	So one of the investors from the analyst firm Jefferies posted the question.
7911600	7917600	I wanted to ask the question of Yves as a founder and CEO of the company.
7917600	7926600	And more important people than me will ask. But in a sense, I could present the question regarding what's happened recently as a kind of three options.
7926600	7936600	Either as CEO, you did not know this was happening, which is not great, or perhaps you didn't know enough and should have asked more.
7936600	7940600	Maybe that's the answer. Or you knew, which, of course, would not be good.
7940600	7951600	Now, those are the possibilities. You may answer the questions differently, but I'd like to ask what would be your answer to the question about your responsibility as CEO?
7951600	7962600	Yeah, you have to remember the CEO at the end of the day for a publicly traded company or one that has investors, the CEO ultimately answers to the board, answers to the investors.
7962600	7971600	And so this is very interesting to see Yves Guimant be held accountable essentially for what's going on, which is a good thing.
7971600	7978600	And the way it's outlined there by the investors, either it was this, either you knew and you didn't do anything, which is horrible.
7978600	7984600	You knew, but you didn't know enough, which is also not a good look. Or you didn't know at all, also not a good look. Please explain.
7985600	7987600	Right. So he did respond.
7987600	7988600	Oh, okay.
7988600	7999600	So he responded basically saying that, he says, thank you for your question. In fact, each time we've been made aware of this context, we have made actually tough decisions.
7999600	8005600	And we made sure those decisions had a clear and positive impact. So that's very important.
8005600	8011600	It has now become clear that certain individuals betrayed the trust I placed in them and Ubisoft's shared values.
8011600	8020600	So I have never compromised on my core values and ethics and never will. I will continue to run and transform Ubisoft to face today's and tomorrow's challenge.
8020600	8028600	That's a non-answer. So he's just shifting blame away from him, but he really should be aware of this stuff.
8029600	8041600	SSJ100Matt puts this very succinctly in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network with this comment saying either he was oblivious, ignorant, or complacent, all of which are bad.
8041600	8043600	All of which are bad.
8043600	8051600	And I agree with that. But there's an upside, it's not necessarily about this scenario, is that we talked last week about how...
8051600	8057600	Oh yeah, completely different. An upside on a completely different topic.
8057600	8067600	How Take-Two was looking at charging $70 for their AAA games. Well Ubisoft is saying that they're going to be sticking with $60 as their price point.
8067600	8070600	So that is what it is.
8070600	8073600	And $40 worth of DLC day one.
8073600	8080600	Right. Completely separate, but at least there's something positive coming from Ubisoft right now.
8081600	8087600	Alright. Well and we know that there are some other changes they've committed to that sound promising.
8087600	8092600	Obviously actions speak louder than words and we'll have to see what the long term looks like for that.
8092600	8102600	But Ubisoft has a lot to, and especially Yves Guillemin, has a lot to kind of work on right now.
8102600	8104600	So get to work.
8104600	8106600	Alright.
8106600	8111600	Moving on, on a much lighter note, let's go back to talking about Pokémon GO.
8111600	8114600	That's certainly a light and frivolous topic.
8114600	8119600	So let's talk about some of the, because they were doing, with GO Fest having happened this weekend virtually,
8119600	8126600	they were doing some virtual online stuff with that, including some interviews and some panels and things like that.
8126600	8132600	So one of the new interviews was an interview with Matt Sleeman, who's the product lead for Pokémon GO,
8132600	8136600	talking about some of the new features coming to Pokémon GO in the near future.
8136600	8139600	In one quote talking about Mega Evolutions, he said,
8139600	8143600	Yeah, we're really excited for Mega Evolution.
8143600	8148600	It's been really important to us as developers and fans of the franchise to get this one right.
8148600	8150600	So it's something that we've been spending time on.
8150600	8156600	The one thing I can confirm is that your existing Pokémon today will be the ones that will be Mega Evolved.
8156600	8159600	Do you want to go in the Poké Ball, Mr. Smoosh?
8159600	8162600	I don't think you want to go in the Poké Ball. Hush.
8162600	8164600	Alright, sorry guys.
8164600	8166600	Although you love it and you know it.
8166600	8172600	Alright, so the Charizard you got at the very beginning of the game, your first Charmander or the one that you evolved,
8172600	8174600	those are all viable candidates.
8174600	8176600	They can all be Mega Evolved.
8176600	8179600	We're excited to get that feature out to you in more detail soon.
8179600	8181600	Yeah, I want to see what that's going to look like.
8181600	8184600	Because, you know, we might have assumptions based on the mainline games,
8184600	8190600	but Pokémon GO has also shown that it's going to do some things like the battle system very, very differently.
8190600	8193600	So I'm just kind of curious to see what that looks like long term.
8193600	8197600	Now another thing that people have been asking about is when is the level cap going to increase?
8197600	8199600	And they did address that.
8199600	8202600	In another quote from Matt Sleeman said,
8202600	8206600	This has been something that's been in discussion for a very long time.
8206600	8210600	The right way to do a level cap increase has been a topic of much debate internally.
8210600	8216600	For us, the most important piece that we wanted to land was we don't want the level cap to increase
8216600	8221600	and then all of a sudden people just sort of get set to their new level and that's sort of the end of it.
8221600	8227600	We do want the experience to feel a little bit different past level 40 than it has felt up to level 40.
8227600	8232600	So fundamentally getting to level 41 and beyond is still going to require effort.
8232600	8236600	That's really what levels are intended to display is how much effort you put into the game.
8236600	8239600	And so that effort economy is still very important to us.
8239600	8244600	But it's not going to be as simple as grinding XP through the ways that you might be used to.
8244600	8250600	So the experience should be a little bit different and we're excited to announce more of that later this year.
8250600	8251600	So we still don't know.
8251600	8258600	Oh I can't wait for them to announce that they're going to allow you to prestige and then give you no sort of benefits for that prestige like they did with Ingress.
8258600	8263600	Yeah I wonder if they're going to do recursion like Ingress has or prestiging if it'll be something like that.
8263600	8268600	Or you know a lot of people just theorizing because Ingress ties advance.
8268600	8274600	You know when Ingress first started there was only eight levels and they brought eight more levels into the game up to level 16 later on.
8274600	8279600	And you had to get badges in addition to their form of experience or AP in that game.
8279600	8283600	You had to get badges so could the system be tied to badges?
8283600	8285600	I kind of think you run into the same problem.
8285600	8288600	There's a lot of people that already have gold badges on a lot of stuff.
8288600	8294600	So is it going to be a quest? Is it going to be some type of prestiging system that forces everybody to start over at the same time?
8294600	8297600	I don't know. We have no idea what that's going to look like.
8297600	8303600	One more comment from Matt Sleeman who says there's a lot of cool stuff we're planning to do later this year.
8303600	8305600	There's more features, more Pokemon, more events.
8305600	8315600	We do want Pokemon Go that lasts a really long time and we think part of that real world appeal is building a game that doesn't just sort of you finish the game, you fizzle out and you feel like the game is done.
8315600	8320600	We really do want Pokemon Go to be a game that sort of feels like it's persistent, real, evolving just like the real world is.
8320600	8326600	So as we move past 2020 the team's going to be spending a little more time on some of the existing features we have today.
8326600	8330600	We've been launching a ton of new features over the last several years and we want to find that right balance.
8330600	8334600	So making sure the new stuff's coming out and the stuff that you already like is getting better.
8334600	8339600	So as we move forward there's still a lot to look forward to and you hope will stick with us on that journey.
8339600	8341600	So we'll see what that looks like.
8341600	8345600	But I like that they're talking about going back and making sure the old stuff is polished too.
8345600	8349600	Hell, the gym rework was one of the best things that game ever did.
8349600	8355600	So you know if they're going to examine some of the old systems and stuff maybe they'll make the Team Rocket stuff more interesting for me.
8355600	8358600	I don't know. So I'm excited to hear that.
8358600	8367600	On a somewhat related note, do you remember on last week's show when I talked about my new thing with portal scanning and scanning at graveyards and all that stuff?
8367600	8371600	So I didn't really scan at graveyards this week because I was trying to do Go Fest.
8371600	8381600	I went to the riverfront in West Sacramento because they have all those information boards and it was like there weren't a lot of kids out.
8382600	8387600	But I was doing portal scanning there and guess what happened? I ran out of scans.
8387600	8392600	Because the game limits you to 200 scans every 13 days, I ran out everybody.
8392600	8395600	I have no more scans available in Ingress.
8395600	8398600	So no graveyard trips for me for a little bit.
8398600	8400600	Hopefully I'll get those back soon.
8400600	8406600	Luckily, luckily I had Pokemon Go to distract me and so forth.
8406600	8408600	So I'm good for now.
8408600	8411600	Maybe I got some back today. I don't know.
8411600	8414600	I have to go keep checking my... because you can't just see how many scans you have.
8414600	8416600	You have to be in range of a portal.
8416600	8421600	So I need to go over to the closest portal to me and see like, oh, can I do scans?
8421600	8422600	But yeah.
8422600	8425600	Yeah, Azet says it's your meta game. It is.
8425600	8428600	Did you know Azet? Because I was telling Pesh this earlier.
8428600	8435600	Did you know that on agent stats right now I'm number two in the world for scout controller?
8435600	8440600	There's one person who got the jump on me who started sooner.
8440600	8445600	And it's a res agent, but kudos to them for getting on that early.
8445600	8450600	But hey, I'm proud to be good at something in this life.
8450600	8452600	All right.
8452600	8457600	Moving on. Let's get into another kind of serious topic.
8457600	8460600	An interesting thing that kind of happened on Twitch this week. Right, Logi?
8460600	8462600	Yeah, more follow up on more stories we talked about.
8462600	8477600	So last week we talked about how Twitch was banning the army from posting their fake giveaways and whatnot on Twitch.
8477600	8488600	So of course on Twitter, though, it was said that due to the recent media coverage of fake giveaways and potentially unconstitutional bans,
8488600	8501600	the U.S. Army Esports team has caused social activity streaming on Twitch and the official activations with Twitch, including participating in upcoming Twitch Rivals events.
8501600	8510600	So one of the other things that they were criticized for about is that they were banning people that were asking certain questions that they may have been uncomfortable with asking on Twitch.
8510600	8526600	And because the army is part of the government in the sense that they have First Amendment, I believe, protections where they cannot silence speakers, you know, based on their viewpoint.
8526600	8538600	Kind of like how, you know, like the president wouldn't necessarily or I don't believe the president's supposed to be banning people or at least there's been lawsuits for that.
8538600	8549600	Jason and I were chatting about this a little bit before the show and he drew that comparison to when folks sued our president because the president was blocking them on Twitter.
8549600	8563600	Because technically when you're working for the government and that's a government Twitter account, if I reply to one of the president's tweets and go, fuck you, you fucking fuck, like that's me extending my First Amendment rights.
8563600	8575600	So the president can't block me for that. Twitter can block me for that because Twitter is a private company and Twitter can say it's our house and in our house you don't say those things to those kind of people.
8575600	8584600	They can do that. Twitch, so you kind of apply this here, Twitch can remove people from the chat for saying things and Twitch can do those sorts of things.
8584600	8594600	But the army being a government agency isn't supposed to be banning people for exercising their First Amendment right, which is fascinating.
8594600	8604600	Right. And unfortunately, they had nothing to add to that. But I mean, really, what is there to add that they were sort of scamming people into joining the army?
8604600	8609600	I mean, like, how do you, how do you, whoops, we didn't think we'd get caught.
8609600	8619600	If you were told that you could have a Twitch channel and get lots of people to watch, but the catch is you could never ban people from your chat room.
8619600	8629600	You might think twice about starting on Twitch, you know what I mean? Like being able to ban people from chat is important. And hell yeah, we did it here last week.
8629600	8640600	You know, we got invaded by, you know, somebody's basement crew, and we had to do some bands and you know, but we, guess what, we're not the government, we're our own company.
8640600	8645600	If you piss us off, we'll ban you. So it's interesting. It's fascinating.
8645600	8650600	Yeah, maybe they can go back and make the America's Army a game again.
8650600	8656600	Hey, they could do America's Army Battle Royale game. There you go. That's, that's hip and trendy.
8656600	8672600	I think, isn't it also fascinating though, to hear Twitch and the government, like in the same breath, like it's always fascinating to me to hear about like video games in, you know, because as a, you know, as a kid and growing up again, video games weren't mainstream.
8672600	8689600	They were obscure. They were for nerds, you know, so it's like, and like probably one of the most fascinating things to me ever was when the Supreme Court did that ruling with the California law, how like one of the justices said, like, you know, well, my staff plays Mortal Kombat and they turned out okay.
8689600	8696600	I'm paraphrasing a lot because I obviously don't have it in front of me, but it was just so interesting to hear a Supreme Court justice talking about Mortal Kombat.
8697600	8712600	That's like something like 15 year old me never would have imagined. You know what I mean? So it's, you know, I seem to hear Twitch and you, you know, there's a lot of politicians that get onto and you obviously AOC is very well known for having got on some charity streams and so forth.
8712600	8718600	And there's, there's politicians that have to participate in video game stuff. This is interesting to me.
8718600	8729600	You know, I suggest if they're looking to get away with scams like this, that a good platform to do that on would be Facebook because they don't seem to want to, you know, monitor their stuff anyways. So they could probably get away with that.
8729600	8733600	Right. You're right. The army should just go to Facebook gaming. It'll be perfect.
8733600	8736600	They should. They're already, you know, why not?
8737600	8740600	All right, moving on.
8740600	8756600	One more story for you guys tonight and this has to do with some things that have leaked out from Nintendo and you may remember a couple months ago we were talking about that like Nintendo's like console source code was leaked.
8756600	8775600	Like somebody got into Nintendo servers and leaked information. Well, now there's even more that's out there leaking and on a very popular forum out there reset era, an anonymous posting started to I'm sorry, I guess maybe 4chan was involved too because, you know, all this kind of stuff usually involves them somehow.
8775600	8788600	But there's a lot of, I mean, you can approach this with some skepticism, right? Like you can fake screenshots. You can fake even videos. It's easy to make deep fakes and stuff.
8788600	8801600	But I don't know, there's some interesting stuff here where I'm like, if somebody faked this, it was really a wasted effort. And what I'm talking about is like a Super Mario Kart version that's a prototype where like the tracks are kind of missing.
8801600	8807600	Like they're in the bottom half of the screen, but not the top half, but the title screen music is completely different.
8807600	8826600	Or some early versions of Super Mario World Yoshi's Island, which in the earliest title screen was apparently called Super Mario Brothers 5, where a lot of the kind of layout of the screen looked very different and it almost like you could see some stuff looked very different.
8827600	8838600	ActDeftInChat says, Beta Yoshi and L is real. Fifth Dream says, all of this is the same leak, which is funny. I'd have no patience and could drop it all at once.
8838600	8852600	So, Dark Tetsuya says, you can't swing a broken joystick on Twitter without finding a ton of this stuff. And yeah, so there's a lot of Super Mario World prototype that had some very different looking Mario in it.
8852600	8860600	It looked very, very different, almost like it might have been a different game or a different property at some point. So yeah, there's all sorts of stuff out there on Twitter that's floating around.
8860600	8873600	A different character in Star Fox 2 at one point, who is human. And yeah, so it's kind of neat. Like, you know, it's one of the things we're like, huh, this is kind of interesting to imagine what these games could have been.
8873600	8883600	But at the same time, some of the people who worked on those games, not happy about this, because this kind of stuff was never meant for public consumption.
8883600	8896600	But you know something else I saw online recently that this kind of reminded me of? You ever follow the show Quantum Leap, which was like a great show in the 80s on NBC, right? It was awesome, right?
8896600	8909600	So Scott Bakula plays a guy who leaps from one home to another. Well, one body to another and ends up in these different stories of the week. The show didn't have a great ending because they didn't know that the show was going to be ending.
8909600	8923600	So it was like kind of one of those everything was summed up in two title cards at the end of the series. Well, people swore for years that there was like alternate footage that exists where they actually shot like a different ending that didn't make it to air.
8923600	8936600	And I think the director or one of the creative minds behind the show said and emphasized, this doesn't exist. You guys are making it up. Well, guess what popped up on Reddit a couple weeks ago? Somebody found the footage.
8936600	8950600	And the footage, I mean, it looks really bad because it's, you know, 30 year old, you know, video footage, but it's up there on Reddit. And sure enough, there's this alternate ending that was shot but just wasn't aired for, you know, whatever creative reason.
8950600	8958600	The fact that the show got canceled at the last minute and all this stuff. So the reason why I bring up that analogy is, you know, kind of bringing it back to where we started tonight.
8958600	8970600	There's a lot of commonplace between the film industry and the game industry. And even though the game industry kind of doesn't like that a lot of these demos and early products kind of get shown after the fact.
8970600	8981600	You know what, fans, they want to see it. They want to see those audition tapes for different actors that were supposed to be a Han Solo or stuff.
8981600	8996600	Didn't like one of those Star Wars releases show like different actors screen testing things? Or was it The Office had like different actors and actresses screen testing for different parts where it was like the girl from 24 reading for Pam.
8996600	8999600	And it just looks like completely different, you know, things like that.
8999600	9002600	They also did like the parody stuff on Saturday Night Live.
9002600	9004600	Well, that's different. That's different. But yeah.
9004600	9012600	SSJ 100 Matt says, so there is still hope for the Sinbad Genie movie being real.
9012600	9016600	That's a different thing. But maybe. I don't know.
9016600	9024600	DJ Rama S says, hey, Quantum Leap wasn't canceled. It became Star Trek Enterprise and now NCIS New Orleans.
9024600	9031600	Thank you. And Crystal Skies 80 says there is a documentary with all the screen tests for Star Wars. I thought that was a thing I saw.
9031600	9038600	Oh, a great comparison by Tiger Claw, the Snyder cut of the Justice League movie.
9038600	9042600	Right. Fans have been clamoring and wanting that for a long time.
9042600	9046600	And now they're going to get it on HBO Max because of all this pandemic stuff.
9046600	9053600	It's like we're having a hard time making new content. So let's give the old content people want. Fascinating.
9053600	9060600	Very, very interesting. So anyway, you just can't hide some of the stuff that people really want to see.
9060600	9066600	All right. I would say to those old developers, you know what? Make the most of it and give us interviews.
9066600	9071600	Tell us why things changed. Why did you go a different direction? What was the intent in things?
9071600	9075600	You know, like, let's hear more about it. I don't know. Anyway.
9075600	9082600	Yeah. Or like even like I like those the GDC talks and stuff where they talk about like game development, different things like that.
9082600	9086600	So it'd be cool to find out, like some of these things.
9086600	9092600	S21 Hunter Matt talks about Back to the Future shot a good chunk of the movie with someone else playing Marty McFly.
9092600	9099600	Yes, that's a big thing that's pretty well known in Hollywood. And of course, now in the moment, I can't remember for life, I mean, who the original actor was.
9099600	9105600	But I think it was one of those things where they kind of wanted Michael J. Fox and then he wasn't available.
9105600	9110600	And it really wasn't working out with the actor that they got. And then suddenly Michael J. Fox was available.
9110600	9114600	So they kind of thank you, Eric Stoltz. Thank you. Yeah, that was.
9114600	9119600	And I because I believe, again, Back to the Future came out on Blu-ray at some point.
9119600	9130600	And you can actually watch some of the scenes. Voyager Blu-ray, which is out there, has the screens test with Genevieve Bujold.
9130600	9137600	Is that her name? It has like the first day of shooting because Kate Mulgrew is not originally Janeway.
9137600	9142600	It was that that I think she's French Canadian or something. Genevieve Bujold. I might be messing up her name.
9142600	9149600	But you can actually see her on set as I think the character was Michelle Janeway in the beginning.
9149600	9156600	And you can actually see some scenes with her in it. And it it does read a little bit awkward. It reads pretty awkward.
9156600	9163600	I can see why they changed it. So anyway, Crystal Skies says he's still in the movie too in one scene.
9163600	9168600	I didn't know that. And Johnny Woofay says I loved Eric Stoltz in Caprica. So, you know, he got it.
9168600	9177600	He worked out at the end of the day. So anyway. Yeah, Bobby Blackwell says they wanted Fox, but the studio didn't think he could lead.
9177600	9181600	Huh. Interesting. Interesting. All right. Anyway, it's listener roundtable.
9181600	9188600	So that's why I keep looking at chat, because if you guys have anything you want us to talk about, by all means, please speak up in our chat room.
9188600	9192600	But otherwise, I'll look to Loki to see if there's any last minute stories for tonight. Yeah, there is one thing.
9192600	9199600	So a brand new modded Zelda game has come out. So The Legend of Zelda, The Missing Link.
9199600	9206600	And it is a mod that it's a brand new game that's been made in the Ocarina of Time engine.
9206600	9217600	So it's set between Ocarina and Majora's Mask. And it's supposed to be like kind of a brand new game with different characters and stuff.
9217600	9223600	But it's still pretty similar to those. But you can download it because, see, they did the proper thing.
9223600	9229600	If you're going to release a fan game for Nintendo, you release it when it's done so they can't do anything about it.
9229600	9235600	I mean, they can see it, but it's already out there.
9235600	9239600	That's it. Once it's out there, it's out there. That's all you got, huh?
9240600	9247600	DJ Rama S. OK, so I brought up in chat talking about the, you know, that show in the UK, the IT crowd.
9247600	9253600	It was pretty well. Yeah, it was. Have you tried to get it off and then on again? Like that whole thing comes from that, right?
9253600	9258600	They actually did an American version of that. They did like a pilot episode. It's on YouTube. Go look for it.
9258600	9263600	It's the IT crowd. Yes, because Joel McHale played a part in it. They had the same guy.
9263600	9269600	Richard Ayode, is that his name, who like hosted the Crystal Maze at one point?
9269600	9275600	I think that's his name. They had him in that pilot as well. So, yeah.
9275600	9282600	Yeah. And Crystal Skies says it's so bad. It really is. There's some very fascinating TV pilots on YouTube.
9282600	9289600	There was an Elvira TV show because, you know, I love Elvira. They did a pilot for an Elvira TV show.
9289600	9297600	And it's her and playing her mom is Mona from Who's the Boss? Catherine Hellman, I think, was her name.
9297600	9302600	She passed away a few years ago. But yeah, Mona from Who's the Boss played her mom.
9302600	9310600	And it's not a great pilot, but I would have lived for an Elvira TV show. Clarissa, the adult years.
9310600	9318600	I don't remember what they ended up calling it, but Melissa Joan Hart legit was in an ABC pilot where she was playing Clarissa taking a job in journalism.
9318600	9322600	And like there's a there's a whole pilot for that online somewhere, too.
9322600	9330600	Yeah, there's there's a show or a YouTube series I like watching, which I think is called Kill the Pilot or something like that.
9330600	9337600	And it's talking about these failed pilots that they did for different shows. You should go check it out.
9337600	9340600	It's actually pretty cool. I think that's what it's called.
9340600	9346600	The one I would have loved to see is they did a pilot for a Dark Shadows reboot.
9346600	9356600	Dark Shadows, of course, being the epic vampire soap opera from like the 1960s and 70s, which had a reboot on NBC in 1988.
9356600	9360600	I think it was early 90s. It was 91 maybe.
9360600	9365600	So they had like a reboot on NBC that was really good, but it was only like one season. So it got cut short.
9365600	9369600	So this was before the Tim Burton movie. So which is based on all that, too.
9369600	9376600	But it's like really compressed everything that apparently the WB did a pilot for a new Dark Shadows.
9376600	9380600	And I was really sad it didn't end up happening because I thought that could have been awesome.
9380600	9386600	So, yeah. Oh, you have that. Is that Dark Shadows reboot pilot on YouTube?
9386600	9389600	I haven't thought to look at it for a long time.
9389600	9395600	DJ Rama S in chat says, I know you love game shows, but do you follow Wink Martindale's YouTube channel?
9395600	9399600	He posts pilots of game shows on there. Yes, I have seen it before.
9399600	9409600	You can actually see Whammy, the Press Your Luck reboot that they did in the early 2000s that didn't end up being that great.
9409600	9416600	Like this new version they have with Elizabeth Banks hosting is much better because it keeps a lot of that cheese ball stuff from the 80s.
9416600	9418600	But they actually did a version of Whammy.
9418600	9425600	So the guy who ended up hosting it beat out Peter Tamarkin, who hosted the original.
9425600	9429600	So there's actually the pilot of Peter Tamarkin hosting Whammy is on YouTube.
9429600	9434600	And I think that's on Wink Martindale's channel, actually. So that's kind of fun to watch.
9434600	9436600	So, yeah.
9436600	9441600	DJ Rama S says, don't forget the reboot of the Munsters as 1313 Mockingbird Lane.
9441600	9444600	I thought they actually aired that as a TV movie.
9445600	9448600	Like they didn't order it to a series, but they aired it as a movie.
9448600	9454600	As I remember when I went, I went to Universal Studios like right around the time that was set to debut.
9454600	9461600	And because I remember they made it a point to say, and this is the house that's used in the upcoming Munsters reboot 1313 Mockingbird Lane.
9461600	9464600	And I was kind of like, they're rebooting the Munsters. That's interesting.
9464600	9466600	And then it like didn't happen.
9466600	9470600	The correct the series name. So it's on YouTube. It's called The Pilot is Dead.
9470600	9474600	And it's talking about a lot of these dead pilots that they shot.
9474600	9482600	And I know that there's one, I think, for the Clarissa adult series where she's a grown up person.
9482600	9488600	There was, I know I've watched that one too. Yeah, Clarissa Now. It's episode nine on there.
9488600	9490600	Oh, nice.
9490600	9496600	And there's another pilot. So sometimes pilots just become TV movies.
9496600	9498600	That happened with Cruel Intentions.
9498600	9503600	So the third direct to video Cruel Intentions movie was a Fox pilot.
9503600	9506600	They were going to turn Cruel Intentions into a series. It didn't happen.
9506600	9509600	One of my favorite movies ever, Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion.
9509600	9514600	There's a really terrible like movie that they put on Fox Family Channel.
9514600	9519600	That was actually a Romy and Michelle TV pilot with.
9519600	9525600	What's her name from Grey's Anatomy that has a reputation for not being very easy to work with.
9525600	9530600	She like did one or two movies. She left Grey's Anatomy to do a movie career that didn't really end up going anywhere.
9530600	9533600	Because she has a reputation for not being the nicest person. She was in that.
9533600	9539600	She played either Romy or Michelle and that pilot didn't end up getting picked up either.
9539600	9542600	So I can't remember her name.
9542600	9544600	That's it. Thank you.
9544600	9548600	Thank you, Riley Schuyler. Catherine Heigl. That's right. That's who it was.
9548600	9552600	Oh, Catherine Heigl. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
9552600	9559600	So sorry. I don't know her personally. I just I've heard she doesn't have a great or at least at that time didn't have a great reputation.
9559600	9562600	Maybe she's turned it around since then. I don't know. All right.
9562600	9567600	Well, if that's it for last minute stories, then I guess that's going to do it for tonight's show.
9567600	9571600	Hey, it was a great show tonight. We had a great discussion there at the beginning of the show.
9571600	9576600	And lots of great topics. Lots of exciting stuff going on in the industry and more to come.
9576600	9581600	You know, we haven't heard the last from Microsoft on Xbox Series X.
9581600	9588600	We know there's still going to be more from Sony on PlayStation five, such as, you know, date and price and all that good stuff.
9588600	9593600	And of course, more games. Nintendo. A lot of pressure to announce like what the hell's coming next.
9593600	9599600	Nintendo from you guys like first party. So in the coming weeks, I'm sure we're to get answers to all of this.
9599600	9606600	So it's going to be very interesting time in gaming as we move into the end of the year.
9606600	9610600	I'm sorry. I have to read this comment from Pixel Pacas in chat related to soap operas.
9610600	9616600	There's a Passions documentary coming. I fucking loved Passions.
9616600	9618600	Passions was like the dark shadow within.
9618600	9623600	We used to watch that shit in college because it's it was so bad, you guys.
9623600	9627600	But like so bad it was kind of good because like it used like what was it?
9627600	9632600	Like there was literally a plot line where like the gypsy woman or whatever.
9632600	9638600	She was supposed to be the mystic lady or whatever tied somebody to the railroad tracks.
9638600	9643600	And she had to like get off. Like it's really cheesy stuff. It was like so bad. It was good.
9643600	9648600	I loved Passions. It was it was great. Yeah. Tabitha, Tabitha and Timmy.
9648600	9653600	And then Timmy died. So they replaced Timmy with like a female character, I believe, if I remember right.
9653600	9659600	So I mean, there's some really problematic stuff in that show that wouldn't hold up all these years later.
9659600	9663600	But at the time, it was it was something else. It was it was a trip.
9663600	9666600	More soap operas should have been like that, to be quite honest.
9666600	9672600	But I guess at the same time, on Days of Our Lives, you did have that whole Marlene got possessed storyline.
9672600	9676600	Don't you follow soap operas, Loki?
9676600	9683600	The most I ever watched soap operas was either on the soup when they were recapping, which was always passions.
9683600	9688600	It was always passions. They were recapping. Yeah. Or it was like it was always on TV.
9688600	9693600	My grandparents or my sitter's house, like when I was a kid, all my children.
9693600	9698600	And so I picked up a lot of that stuff just from being in the rooms with that stuff.
9698600	9704600	But like, I don't know, there's way too many twins on that show.
9704600	9707600	So I don't get it.
9707600	9710600	All right. All right. Let's go around and get final thoughts.
9710600	9714600	Thanks to Delvin for being on the show tonight, kicking us off.

9756600	9762600	OK, let's get final thoughts. Running out of things to say. Loki, your final thought tonight.
9762600	9768600	My final thought is that I have to build a mansion now.
9768600	9776600	Good luck with that. My final thought is I look forward to just playing some more games this week.
9776600	9781600	And some more sandbox games I'm going to explore. Probably doing some No Man's Sky.
9781600	9786600	I did a live stream last night, which was my first gaming live stream in probably like six months.
9786600	9791600	I kind of missed it. So I need to do that more often. And thank you to those of you guys that came out for that as well.
9791600	9796600	I know it was kind of late night. So that's it. That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Ons Radio.
