Music

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:15,200
Government and private sector clashes are all but inevitable, and the difference between the physical and digital mediums blurred even further.

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,700
Where the army previously maintained an online game serving as an interactive means of evaluating individuals for military service,

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,500
this year saw the attempt at soliciting by the power of personality and mock giveaways.

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,500
This latest experiment was short-lived as people exercised their constitutional rights.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,700
It's another week in the wide world of gaming as your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki bring you this and the rest of the week's gaming news,

7
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,300
starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,600
Music

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:47,800
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:01:01,600
It is Orange Lounge Radio back yet again with episode number 829 of our program for this July the, what date are we on here?

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,300
I lost the 26th, thank you, July 26th of 2020.

12
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:14,300
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

13
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,200
Hey.

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,900
Hi, how are you?

15
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,500
I'm all new and all different and on pain meds.

16
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,400
Yes, you are, you are looking lovely over there.

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,900
Thank you very, thank you, thank you.

18
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:33,300
People seem to like my black wig from the other week, so I have a different black wig this week that I like better.

19
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,900
With the black flower, you can't really see it because it's black.

20
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,600
Uh-huh.

21
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:45,400
Sorry guys, if you're watching, sorry guys, if you're watching on Twitch because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern at The Voice Geeks Network,

22
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:55,400
twitch.tv slash vog network, and if you are watching, I'm changing some shots on the fly here because I thought I made, there we go, that's the shot I wanted.

23
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
There we go.

24
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,700
I made a new little layer there and it fell all the way to the bottom of my list and I was like, where did it go?

25
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,400
I can't find it.

26
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,400
Okay, now I can see the episode number and everything like I usually can.

27
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
Phew.

28
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,800
That's the fun of doing a live show is that sometimes you have technical difficulties and things that happen.

29
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,600
So come watch us be a train wreck live and you also get to see Dark Sockra's wig.

30
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,100
All right.

31
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,600
Uh, also say hello to, and expensive makeup, you know, I could do that.

32
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,300
Yes, of course.

33
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,100
Uh, also say, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

34
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,600
Hey, how's it going?

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,500
Hey, good.

36
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,000
How are you?

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Pretty good.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So I see tonight the selection for your virtual background is some, uh, Katamari Damacy?

39
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,200
Yeah, cause I couldn't think of anything else.

40
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,200
That's what, you know what?

41
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,400
There's no problem with Katamari.

42
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,800
Katamari is always a good thing, I think.

43
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:41,900
Yeah.

44
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,100
All right.

45
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,700
Now those of you that are watching on Twitch are probably like, wait a minute, things look a little different.

46
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,800
There's another person there.

47
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
What's going on?

48
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,500
Yes.

49
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:58,400
So the whole reason why I've got like new layers and shots on and things on Twitch is because I wanted to invite on a guest host to kind of join us at the beginning of tonight's show.

50
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,400
And, uh, he's been on the show before.

51
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,800
It's been a little while though.

52
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,800
So say hello everybody to Mr.

53
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
Video game realness or Delvin.

54
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,300
Hey everyone.

55
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,000
How's it going?

56
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,100
Hey, I'm great.

57
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,700
How are you doing?

58
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,200
Wonderful.

59
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,900
Fantastic.

60
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,900
Happy to be on the show again.

61
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,300
Yeah.

62
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,800
Virtually.

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,400
Yeah.

64
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,200
Uh, congrats on being, I guess our first like virtual host of sorts, uh, being here at the top of the show with us.

65
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:22,900
Woo.

66
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,300
Yeah.

67
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,000
Uh, and I see some, uh, comments in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,400
DJ Rama S says here comes a new podcaster.

69
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,300
Fifth dream says virtual guests.

70
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:33,600
Yes.

71
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Well, here's the thing.

72
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:41,200
So I want to get into tonight's show because of course we do talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle every week here on OLR.

73
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,200
And Delvin, you and I are in a chat with some other gamers, G A Y M E R S.

74
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,100
And, uh, you kind of brought up a topic that I thought was really, really interesting.

75
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:59,700
And I was like, well, I want to talk about that on OLR, but like, I'd be kind of a Dick if I stole my friend's topic and then didn't invite him on the show to like share his feelings.

76
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,700
So here we are.

77
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,900
So, well, I'm, I'm happy to share.

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,200
All right.

79
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,500
Yes.

80
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,200
So tell us, tell us a little bit about this thought that you had that you were sharing with others in a chat room.

81
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:31,400
Well, it's just that, um, you know, I've been reading comments in multiple, you know, videos, game, uh, groups and things like that, which of course one should never read comments, but you know, the general consensus of what's been shown for both Sony and been shown for Xbox.

82
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,400
Is that, you know, well, they didn't show anything that was next gen.

83
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,200
Right.

84
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,100
And, you know, it's really made me think of this conversation.

85
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:50,900
Well, what is next gen, you know, what is the next generation and it's not following the regular format of previous generations.

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,100
Um, you know, Nintendo's already essentially started its next generation with the switch.

87
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:03,700
Uh, you know, Sony's paving its traditional path of a new system, throw out the old one.

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:16,800
And then there's Microsoft here with this new blurring of the lines and creating a new space, uh, kind of a hybrid of console and PC.

89
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,500
Right.

90
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,500
And we're going to get into talking a little bit about the Xbox showcase in a little bit, and I hope you'll stay with us to talk about that.

91
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,100
Cause I know you probably have some feelings on that.

92
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:34,600
But, um, you're, I can say that one big takeaway I had from the Xbox game showcase was that dang, you guys game pass, that's a deal.

93
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,300
Like the whole thing really read to me.

94
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,900
It's like a giant infomercial for game pass.

95
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:49,500
I don't know how you guys felt, but I felt like it wasn't really selling us an Xbox series X as much as it was selling us on the notion of, Hey y'all Microsoft makes video games.

96
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,700
And if you subscribe to their subscription service, you can play all these games the day they launch and you don't have to pay like $60 per game anymore.

97
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,300
Like that's kind of what I took away from it.

98
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,200
And I don't think that, I don't think that's a bad thing.

99
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,600
And I don't necessarily think Microsoft thinks that's a bad thing because they set the stage several times.

100
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,700
We're showing games.

101
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,900
We're not showing Xbox series X.

102
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,900
We know we're going to be getting another thing in August or maybe later on.

103
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:23,100
That's probably going to set the stage better as to why do you need Xbox series X specifically now you also know the games.

104
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:29,400
So, so yeah, so I, it's a kind of follow your comment about like Microsoft's kind of blurring the lines.

105
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,200
You're right.

106
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,900
They didn't try to sell me a series X this week.

107
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,500
I feel like they tried to sell me game pass, which is a different way of thinking about it.

108
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,000
Yeah.

109
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:53,500
And, um, you know, some of the other comments that, um, Some people have had is like, you know, well, I don't, I don't need to get an, a series X because, um, well, there's nothing exclusive for the series X coming out for the first couple of years.

110
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,400
So I don't need a series X.

111
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,700
I'll just stick with my Xbox.

112
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:04,600
And, you know, a lot of people are saying it and not really even hearing themselves and what they're saying that, you know, they're saying it as like, it's a bad thing.

113
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,000
Like, I, I, I, I'm not going to buy the new console.

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,800
I'm just going to play the games on my old console.

115
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,400
And it's like, that's what Microsoft wants you to do.

116
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,200
Right.

117
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:26,000
They, you know, they want to create this, uh, new path where you don't throw away your old system just because the new one has come out and, you know, that's something that PC gaming has had.

118
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:32,400
You know, no, you know, just, just because a new game comes out, um, doesn't mean that you need a new PC.

119
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:41,100
Uh, you may not be able to play it at its full capability, but you're able to play it maybe on the lowest settings and maybe that's okay for some people.

120
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:50,200
And some people want, you know, uh, Nvidia 28, 2080 TI highest graphic capability video card.

121
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,500
Right.

122
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:01,200
Which, which is fine because this is what PC gaming, when I say PC, I mean, Mac as well, because also phone gaming, you know, this has been the, the way those things have worked forever.

123
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,500
Right.

124
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,100
Like obviously I'm a huge fan of Pokemon go.

125
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,400
Right.

126
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:13,600
I talked about that game an awful lot, and I think we all generally know, like Pokemon go works really, really well on the newest iPhone and the newest Android.

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,600
It'll run on an iPhone six or, you know, the, the Android equivalent from those years.

128
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,000
It'll run on those things.

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,100
Does it run as well?

130
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,000
Does it do the AR stuff?

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You know, but you still pretty much get the same experience.

132
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,500
For the most part, but it does work better on the newer technology.

133
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,500
And now we're seeing that with consoles, which is very disruptive because we're not used to that.

134
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:47,600
Like we're very used to thinking of the next generation of gaming as more teraflops, right?

135
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,100
More, more bites, more bits, right?

136
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,800
It's eight bit.

137
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
No, it's 16 bit.

138
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,800
No, it's 32 kind of bit.

139
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
32 X it's, it's 64 bit.

140
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,900
What do you call it?

141
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,400
Dreamcast?

142
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,300
Is that 128?

143
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,900
I don't know, but it's more, you know.

144
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:01,600
Yeah.

145
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:24,500
And I also think that in terms of, you know, console gaming as it is, we've kind of really, we're hitting a plateau in terms of what, you know, you know, when you think of the, the generational leap from PlayStation one to PlayStation two, more graphics, you know, and then PlayStation two to three more graphics, three to four more graphics.

146
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:32,500
We're kind of hitting a plateau in terms of how much further we can go graphically to wow people into buying games.

147
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,700
Well, look at the reception to the new halo game, right?

148
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:50,800
Not to get too ahead of ourselves, but I think we can generally talk about that, that halo game actually received some kind of negative critiques online for looking like an old generation game for looking like something that we could have played on an Xbox three 60.

149
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,200
I guess I didn't, I didn't walk away with those same feelings.

150
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:05,800
I wasn't quite as critical, you know, the YouTubers went in there and analyzed every frame and was like, well, you see here at eight minutes and 43 seconds on the 23rd frame, you can see some texture popping in here.

151
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
And this is proof that Microsoft is a fraud.

152
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,600
Watch my three hour YouTube analysis, breaking this down.

153
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,600
You're laughing cause it's fucking true.

154
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,300
Yeah.

155
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:17,800
Yes.

156
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,300
That's right.

157
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,900
That's a hundred percent why I'm laughing.

158
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,000
But, um, but yeah, I'd be like, I, to me.

159
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,500
I didn't walk away with such a negative feeling.

160
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,300
I kind of looked at that when, oh yeah, it looks, it looks pretty.

161
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,000
Um, yeah, I could probably play this on Xbox one.

162
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,600
Maybe it'll just not be quite as smooth, but it'll be fine.

163
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,800
But I like that.

164
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,500
It kind of looks like the old halo and you know, back when I was really into the series in the first couple of games and so forth, that's kind of what I took from it.

165
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,900
But I, and the reason why I bring all that up is because like Delvin, you're saying people are used to, it's gotta be bigger.

166
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,700
It's gotta be faster.

167
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,100
It's gotta be more powerful.

168
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,300
But some would say that Microsoft did not rise to that when they showed the new halo.

169
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,000
Does that mean they're a flop?

170
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,000
That's a hard no for me.

171
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I think they still did a very good job with that conference.

172
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,800
Well, I think again, I think it comes down to what people are traditionally accustomed to.

173
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:28,900
And I think we've, we, as console gamers have been accustomed to new system, better graphics, more flops, you know, Ray tracing, uh, four K 60 F like we've become accustomed to things are going to look visually better the next time around.

174
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,000
But I think what Microsoft really has done here and, and it's taken a page out of Nintendo's book.

175
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,700
That has shown, you know what?

176
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:43,000
You can make a console that isn't as graphically capable and it sells a ton.

177
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:56,500
Let's take a look at the, we let's take a look at the Nintendo 3DS versus the Vita and now the switch versus both consoles, you know, well, not that they're not that the switches outside the PS4, but it's selling really well.

178
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,100
So I think that, you know, again, Microsoft is.

179
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,900
In the, in the respect to halo.

180
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:11,500
Um, kind of taking that, that page where it's like, let's just make the game really good and, you know, market, um, game pass.

181
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:18,800
And, and have that option for people who want to have better graphics to get the series X to play on their PC and things like that.

182
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,300
Yeah.

183
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,700
I'm going to chat over at Twitch TV slash Vaga network.

184
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:30,800
Uh, she Hulk 10 says we are kind of at the end of technology game as end of technology game graphic wise, at least.

185
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,000
Yeah.

186
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,600
For now, you know, we, we've had a long running joke here on OLR that everything is one step closer to the holodeck, right?

187
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,500
Everything in gaming is one step closer to the holiday.

188
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,900
And I kind of think for now we've hit as far as we can go.

189
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,800
Where, yes, there is literal holographic technology and things out there.

190
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:52,000
And one could say, Oh, VR or HoloLens, but you know what, for whatever reason, gaming is not going there right now.

191
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,400
Maybe in 10 years as well.

192
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,400
I, I, I'm getting ahead of myself.

193
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,900
I don't necessarily mean that with VR because obviously the PlayStation VR has done very well.

194
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,500
Um, but I'm, my mind is going like HoloLens and the literal interpretation of like the holodeck.

195
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,200
Obviously I think we've kind of like hit a limit here.

196
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:15,500
So anyway, um, back to what we're like really talking about is that, yeah, we've kind of hit like this plateau with graphics and so forth.

197
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,900
So, and I guess this is a question for everybody, for the chat room, for you guys.

198
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,700
What is the next generation of gaming?

199
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:35,000
What do we expect from the next generation of gaming now that graphics and sound and all that we, we kind of reasonably believe we've hit our limits?

200
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,400
So what is the next generation of gaming?

201
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,100
And, and Delvin, I'll pick on you first.

202
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,500
Cause you brought this topic to us.

203
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:56,300
Well, I think, um, I think everyone is kind of paving their own path, um, in terms of the big three, so to speak, uh, Nintendo has already, you know, dipped out of the, you know, console generational race.

204
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:05,300
Uh, you know, they've just, they've shown that they can't compete in the same space in a Sony Microsoft world.

205
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,200
So they dipped out, they created their own space.

206
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:15,100
They've created now this hybrid home portable system, um, where they're more focused on just making good games.

207
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,600
So they've created their own space.

208
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,100
And I think that Sony and Microsoft, you know, previous generation were, you know, battling it out.

209
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,300
And I think Microsoft just realized, you know what?

210
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:36,700
This is pointless fighting for, you know, because I think we were getting to a point where it was just fighting for third party, um, games.

211
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:46,600
Getting windows of exclusivity, you know, and then, you know, trying to sell your, your first party games to lure people over to your console.

212
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,800
But at the end of the day, most people were going to three.

213
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,500
So I think Microsoft was just like, you know what?

214
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,900
This is just not working.

215
00:14:51,900 --> 00:15:02,900
And so, so now they're creating their own path there where, uh, quite frankly, I don't even think their next console, their next offering is a series X.

216
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,500
They're selling you game pass.

217
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,400
Game pass is their next, um, generational leap.

218
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,200
Um, they're offering you a service.

219
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,800
They're offering you a way to play next gen games, however you choose.

220
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,900
And I think X cloud will tie into that down the road and things like that.

221
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,000
And then Sony's just going the traditional route because they're like, you know what?

222
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,100
It works for us.

223
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,600
We get all the big third party games, so they're just going to continue that.

224
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:36,700
And I think this generation will really show which method works.

225
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:47,200
Uh, and let me, let me call on my, uh, other co-hosts because, um, you know, I'm, I'm curious what you guys think and that there is no right answer to this because it's, what is the next gen for you?

226
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,900
What is this next generation games for you?

227
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,700
Dark soccer.

228
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:55,200
I, I'm going to pick on you cause I'm dying to know your opinion, especially because you're kind of the retro queen here on OLR.

229
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,500
You know, you are a very knowledgeable on the retro and you come from.

230
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,000
Well, you know what, you know what I mean?

231
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,100
Like your, your mindset and a lot of the games that you play are in that, you know, when games were more bits and more things like that.

232
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,100
And we were, so I'm very curious for you.

233
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,700
What the next generation, no, I'm not calling you old.

234
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,600
I'm calling you well educated on your gaming history.

235
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:25,900
So, and a little old, so, seriously, but I can never tell because of your fierce makeup job.

236
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,600
No, but what, what's, what's the next gen of gaming for you?

237
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:36,500
Um, the next, what would truly be a next generation would have to be a true evolution.

238
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:43,900
It would have to go beyond the standard console, new console that does this, new console that does that.

239
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,000
You know, they need to do something.

240
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,500
I need to not elbow my mute button.

241
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,800
They need to do something that is a true innovation.

242
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:02,000
They need to take something that people will not expect and bring it into the modern age.

243
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:10,900
I don't think it's going to be anything like, like bringing a hologram, holograms into our home or anything crazy like that or another console.

244
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:17,400
That's just gonna, you know, like I said before, I do do, oh, it's got 50 bajillion teraflops of floppiness.

245
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:25,400
You know, I think that it's time to take number one, to get back to what makes games good.

246
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:34,200
And then number two, to find an innovative way to distribute them that is unexpected.

247
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,400
You have to, it's not just a matter of surprise.

248
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,100
It's a matter of delight.

249
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,300
You have to bring about this enthusiasm in people.

250
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:54,400
It's this, basically for all of us older gamers, especially, you need to bring back the joy of our childhood with this.

251
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:04,200
That first giddy thought we had when we opened our NES under the tree, you know, if you do that thing.

252
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,900
You know, the first feeling we had when we found Mortal Kombat 2, you know, being beta tested somewhere, that was great.

253
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,500
You know, they're missing that same joy that we had back in the day.

254
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,300
And I'm not saying, oh, it was better back then, meh, get off my lawn, meh.

255
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:30,600
But I'm saying that they need to bring the heart back into it and then innovate it.

256
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:39,100
It's those two things that are, I think, what should come back in the next generation.

257
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,100
I mean, Nintendo's been doing it, you know, forever.

258
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,500
Nintendo's got it right.

259
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,400
And, but no one else is willing to innovate.

260
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,900
They just want to stay on that same hard edge and don't want to bring the love into it.

261
00:18:52,900 --> 00:19:02,100
They're like, oh, well, we're just going to bring out the niche things to make a few people happy here and there, but we're going to keep pushing all of this triple A bullshit that we know is going to sell.

262
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,800
It's all the bottom line for them.

263
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,400
And for Nintendo, yeah, of course they got a bottom line to look at.

264
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,800
But for the most part, they're looking at what keeps the games fun.

265
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,900
What makes them fun?

266
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,000
What gives them heart?

267
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,800
You know, it's interesting, it's interesting you bring up the gaming's heart.

268
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:40,200
My answer is not that dissimilar from yours, but this particular point is really interesting to me because I do think one thing that has kind of defined the last couple of generations, probably starting with the like the Xbox 360, PS3, but really stepping up in this latest generation is the rise of independent gaming and the ability for more independent creators to get their artwork out there.

269
00:19:40,600 --> 00:20:05,700
And as we see, you know, it's no, well, it's a coincidence, but no coincidence that as we're moving into this next generation of gaming, we're also seeing gigantic social uprisings going on between the Black Lives Matter movement, between increased visibility for LGBTQIA, between the hashtag Me Too and how that's been impacting the games industry.

270
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,500
And I think you absolutely are going to see that reflect.

271
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:17,900
So you talk about like the heart, you're going to see that reflected in the actual games, the actual content of what we see in the next generation.

272
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:29,700
And I think what we've seen in some of these early reveals, such as, you know, some very varied protagonists and so forth within not just Microsoft's event, but the Sony event as well, I think kind of speaks to that.

273
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,200
Am I right, you think?

274
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,100
Or on the right track?

275
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,800
I think so.

276
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:43,100
But the other thing, too, is that along the same lines that you're saying, too, I think we've definitely seen video games now as a valid form of protest or art.

277
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:51,000
And I think that this is all something that maybe the big players want to shy away from.

278
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,500
But at the same time, they have to accept that it's an inevitability.

279
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,100
For example, we had the Hong Kong protesters in Animal Crossing.

280
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:09,000
We now have a slew of I mean, if you just go on those little code sites for the Able Sisters, you'll find plenty of Black Lives Matter.

281
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,200
You'll find trans apparel.

282
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,600
Our friend Marissa made quite a few things that I've got one of them hanging in my shop.

283
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,700
Or Loki.

284
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:28,200
Loki had a story last week about how they were protesting in Red Dead, dressing up in clown outfits to protest the fact that Red Dead wasn't being updated.

285
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:35,300
So it's like, there's that, and we might kind of laugh at, you know, oh, that's more of like a silly protest.

286
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:43,600
But at the same way, it's like that ability to protest is finding its way into gaming, which I find fascinating.

287
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Okay, Mass Ethnic 3.

288
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,400
I guess, yeah, there's that, too.

289
00:21:49,400 --> 00:22:11,600
But the other the other thing with this, too, though, is that with the pandemic going on now, this is also going to affect what's happening with the next generation, which is why we're seeing, I think, so much of a burst in online and cloud based gaming and, you know, things that aren't going to require you to leave your house to go venture into a store.

290
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:21,600
On top of that, though, this the next generation, the way everything goes, it's going to affect the way video game industry does their business.

291
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,600
We're going to see the big chain stores go.

292
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:32,400
We're going to I think we're really going to have a resurgence of mom and pops of the trading sites of different things like that.

293
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:39,100
So when I think of next generation for gaming, I am not necessarily thinking of a console or a company.

294
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,200
I'm trying to look at it holistically.

295
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:47,100
All of these factors are what's going to play in to what we get at home.

296
00:22:47,800 --> 00:23:00,700
And as much as this pandemic situation has absolutely sucked and there's not a lot of good things to say about it, you know, the art that will come from it, which includes video games, is going to be something, you know, not to not to be too silly.

297
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,000
But there's a lot of hype online on Twitter and stuff.

298
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,600
Oh, my gosh. Taylor Swift, surprise, put out an album.

299
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,500
Well, do you know why she had the time to make an entire album and surprise release it?

300
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,100
Because she was really fucking bored, right?

301
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,500
She was she ran out of access to write about.

302
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:23,900
I mean, but another another thing, too, and this is just going a little bit more into the social aspect of the next gen.

303
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:28,700
You were talking about, you know, about trolls and everything, I believe.

304
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:34,900
But I think that we're going to start seeing a lot more backlash from the marginalized within the gaming community.

305
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:45,000
And I think we're going to and whoever is going to be putting out the next consoles, no matter what they are, there's going to be the online element to it and they are going to be held accountable.

306
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:59,500
I mean, we've got all these people who are right now in the fire because they were misogynistic shits or had done all kinds of other atrocity, atrocious things as I was trying to get out.

307
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:09,500
But I think that all of this, I think we're going to have to see protections built in on the next generation, you know, again, to protect that heart.

308
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,100
It needs to be safe for everybody.

309
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:25,700
Everyone's going to need to have a good place to go and play and little do a lot of people realize that women are legitimately by the numbers 50% of the gaming market right now.

310
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,700
And there's no way to ostracize us.

311
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:43,500
It can't happen, you know, you've got people you have black people, brown people, people of all nationalities of all all color schemes of the rainbow, all sexualities, all genders just across the board.

312
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:57,700
And I think that in whatever is going to happen with the systems, whatever is going to happen with moderation online for any of that, they're going to have to be accepting that this world is changing without them and they better fucking change with it.

313
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,500
Games are for everyone.

314
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,000
Said it a lot here on the show, especially me.

315
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:02,700
All right.

316
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,800
I want to make sure we get everybody.

317
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,800
Loki, you know, you know, it was very well said.

318
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,500
Loki next.

319
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,700
What's the next gen for you?

320
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,600
It's going to be exactly the same as it has been this gen.

321
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,100
No, actually.

322
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,800
So they're going to I think that there's not really anything different.

323
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:25,200
You're going to have consoles pushing better graphics because they have, you know, more streamlined pathways.

324
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,100
They can do render more complex things because now they have more power.

325
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:33,200
Plus they don't have the latency from accessing physical drives.

326
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:40,500
You're going to see new ways to purchase content with, you know, the games pass kind of business model.

327
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,700
You have streaming services trying to kind of take up that aspect with Google Stadia, which is totally going to fail.

328
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:57,400
And then I don't know, like they have more of a traditional sense with like even Sony, but they're still trying to do their thing to with PlayStation now.

329
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,000
Honestly, I wasn't really disappointed in the graphics.

330
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:10,400
We're talking about like a showcase of stuff that's coming out several months away and you don't expect the graphics to be incredibly polished already.

331
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:16,200
I know everyone online was like, say, oh, well, Halo looked like it was kind of not looking as good.

332
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,400
But then they uploaded the trailer later that was running, I guess, in engine or something like that on the hardware and it looked a little bit better.

333
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,700
So I still think it's very early for that type of stuff.

334
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:32,600
And there are some games that, you know, not necessarily the art style has to push the game itself.

335
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:37,300
I think Halo's basically known for its good gameplay and that's what people are going to be coming in for.

336
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,200
Yeah, it's an Xbox system and they're expecting fancy graphics.

337
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,700
Well, you know, there's Forza Motorsports for that.

338
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,900
There's going to be a lot of other games that are going to be pushing graphics.

339
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,800
I don't know, I think people are making a big deal about it because there's not a lot of information to go off of right now.

340
00:26:53,800 --> 00:27:02,400
So everybody has to take their stance to keep it competitive in this video game system war or whatever you want to call it.

341
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,400
I don't know, I don't see like physical retail going away.

342
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,700
I certainly don't see mom and pops taking over because that business model is not profitable at all.

343
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:22,400
They have a hard enough time when the industry is working well and when it was more physical media versus digital and now that switching kind of towards digital.

344
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
It's not getting any easier for them.

345
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,000
So I don't know, I guess we'll have to wait and see what happens.

346
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,200
All I know is like there's games I'm excited for.

347
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:40,700
I saw more of those types of games on during the Xbox presentation this last time.

348
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:51,900
Maybe Sony will have more of the next presentation they have or Microsoft will have even more the next time they show off some more stuff because they still have more coming according to their tees.

349
00:27:51,900 --> 00:28:02,100
So I don't know and as far as Nintendo innovating there, they better be innovating because they're a little bit behind in a lot of things online being one of them.

350
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:07,000
Yet some of the game design stuff that they're doing and I understand you know where they're not behind sales.

351
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,800
So you know, and that's fine that they do have it's like the Apple market though.

352
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:19,500
They have a lot of people that are dedicated fans of their franchises and that's good for them and they'll keep them going for a while.

353
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:27,100
But eventually when the next shiny thing comes along that's able to take those fans away and that could be a very long time or impossible sometimes.

354
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,900
Then they're going to move to that.

355
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:36,400
But right now I know that they're not really being forced to innovate because they're kind of they're doing well as it is.

356
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:45,100
But there's a lot of flaws that could be fixed a lot of things that could be better and especially if like a model like games pass takes off.

357
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:57,300
They're going to have to look to adapt to that and fortunately being that they just kind of got into online and I got to say like having used like a lot of the online stuff now on their platform.

358
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,700
It's very clunky and it shouldn't be clunky in the year 2020.

359
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,500
I mean, they should be polished and ready to go not just getting into this.

360
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:13,500
I mean, I get it that that's the thing is if they're successful in their own right, then they're not going to push to innovate like this.

361
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:20,600
And I don't really consider the switch too innovative considering that yeah, it's a portable system that could dock to a TV.

362
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:21,900
Cool.

363
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,100
That itself is not really innovative as far as the way I play those games.

364
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:35,300
And the the we votes are not the we most the the switch joy cons are very similar to the we most but they're not even utilized to that.

365
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:40,100
Except they kind of force a lot of stuff in there with the motion controls, but I don't know.

366
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,700
There's games that are on it that are good.

367
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,700
But they're kind of in their own ecosystem right now.

368
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,700
So all right, so I'm just gonna keep staying the same.

369
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,400
I'm gonna I'm gonna try to keep my answer short, which might shock you but here it is.

370
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:05,700
And I'm not trying to be that guy on social media that quotes the movie The Matrix, but I'm gonna because I think for the next generation of games, there is no spoon.

371
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,700
And I think that's kind of where we're going is that there is no spoon.

372
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:19,600
And what I mean by that, like we talk a lot about how like the gaming industry follows a very similar path to the movie industry.

373
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:26,000
And I think we very often forget about that as a gaming and moving movies, excuse me, are more tied together than they are different.

374
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:31,300
In fact, to kind of follow up something I really wanted to say to Loki's comment about like Nintendo and Apple.

375
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,300
Well, you know, another name that gets thrown in with those guys all the time, Disney.

376
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,900
And when it comes to the film industry and entertainment, Disney kind of does their own thing.

377
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,700
They appeal to a family audience, but it touches a lot of adults too.

378
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,700
And they've been very successful with that model and they kind of exist.

379
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,500
They have their own little land and their own little world that you can go to.

380
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:57,900
Well, you know, when there's not a pandemic going on, but it's a very, you know, cute place for all that to exist.

381
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:04,000
So my point is, and when you look at movies, movies have gone through a lot of progression as well, right?

382
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,500
Like when we first started movies in the theater and then it started coming to VHS and Beta.

383
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,000
And I think before that really were the giant discs, the video discs.

384
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:20,300
And then it was DVD and then it was Blu-ray and then it was Netflix.

385
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:24,000
And now there were video discs and that turned into laser discs.

386
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,900
What were the gigantic freaking discs that were right around the time of the early tapes?

387
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,600
Laser discs.

388
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,200
No, before laser discs, they actually had video discs that came in what looked like a huge ass floppy.

389
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,000
Yes.

390
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,200
It looked like the size of an album.

391
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,000
Those were video discs, which was the concursion of laser discs.

392
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,300
Okay.

393
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:42,600
That's it.

394
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,000
Video discs.

395
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,900
That's what I was trying to think of.

396
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:44,600
Okay.

397
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,800
So, but, but anyway, y'all, y'all see what I'm saying.

398
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:52,800
And then for the, for the longest time, you know, the, the movie industry was like, oh my gosh, this is going to kill our industry.

399
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,500
We're going to, we're, nobody's going to go see a movie in the theater anymore.

400
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,300
And that hasn't happened.

401
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:03,400
And even with this pandemic, we're seeing more like things that are released on demand and in your home.

402
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,000
And is that going to kill theaters?

403
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,100
Probably not.

404
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,800
If anything kills theaters, it'll be this whole pandemic situation.

405
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,900
But fingers and toes crossed that we see the other side of this and have some sense of normalcy in the next couple of years.

406
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:19,400
I would bet that we're going to have a lot of things that are still at home and in the theater.

407
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:31,000
But anyway, now the movie industry and the TV industry is so like digital and on demand and services and things like Netflix and Disney Plus.

408
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,900
And that this, that's where a lot of that is going.

409
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:40,200
And so my answer for gaming is that I think, and this is what Microsoft, I think is really doing right, is that they see this coming.

410
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:48,400
And so that's why they're starting to sow the seeds with xCloud and, you know, the game, Game Pass is the way to get your games.

411
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,500
And the console is just one way to manifest it.

412
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,100
The console is one type of Netflix player, if that's what you want to do.

413
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,300
But at the end of the day, it's really going to be the games.

414
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,700
And to some extent, I think Google Stadia also has this.

415
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,100
The problem with Google Stadia is that it's Google's first foray really into games.

416
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:15,400
And they don't have the knowledge, experience or things behind it that are going to elevate it in the way that it needs.

417
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,200
And it feels very dated already before it's actually come out.

418
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,200
But the technology itself is actually really fascinating.

419
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:27,200
So I say there is no spoon because I think eventually there's not going to be a box anymore.

420
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,000
And I think Microsoft probably going to be the first to get there.

421
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,400
What do you think about hearing all that, Delvin, all of our answers?

422
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:43,700
Well, one thing I wanted to add is that one of the things I think Microsoft is trying to go for is install base.

423
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:54,500
And I think when we look at 360 versus PS3, you know, they were very neck and neck in terms of the numbers.

424
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:03,800
And then when we go to PS4 and Xbox One, they lost out on a lot of exclusives and third party games because they didn't have the install base.

425
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,100
It's the same thing that Nintendo goes through.

426
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:17,900
And I think this is Microsoft's way of kind of changing that narrative where, yes, we have the numbers and they're changing the way in which you achieve that.

427
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:22,700
Normally, it was just the more consoles you sell means the more people that can play your games.

428
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,300
But they've now changing that.

429
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:40,600
You know, they're growing that blue ocean strategy like Nintendo was where we're increasing our install base by your computer, by eventually xCloud, you know, on your Samsung Smart TV eventually and everything.

430
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:52,200
And then what they'll be able to go to third parties and say is, we have 200 million Xbox users via PC, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

431
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:58,900
Whereas Sony will only have PlayStation 5 or Nintendo will only have a Switch.

432
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:09,000
So that's kind of where I think Microsoft is trying to change the shift and their way to increase their foothold in the console gaming space.

433
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,500
I am very curious what you guys in our chat room think over twitch.tv slash vog network.

434
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,400
I'll try to get a few comments.

435
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,400
I see you guys have said many things.

436
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,700
It's scrolling so fast.

437
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,700
I almost can't get to get to the comments in time because we're having such a great discussion here on air.

438
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,900
But I am watching you guys.

439
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,100
You guys are having great discussion.

440
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:32,700
And I also, I have to acknowledge, I know we don't usually acknowledge the biddies and subs, but I have to acknowledge the hype train y'all got up to like level four or something.

441
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,500
That's pretty awesome.

442
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,900
So thank you guys very much for that.

443
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,400
But I want to point out also Bobby was kind of piggybacking on a comment.

444
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,800
I said about how like they'll still there.

445
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,100
There will always be a place for movie theaters.

446
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:50,400
A big thing that's starting to happen right now is pop up drive-through theaters or not drive-through drive-in theaters.

447
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:55,100
You know, I happen to live not far from an actual drive-in theater.

448
00:35:55,100 --> 00:36:01,600
That's that's thriving now in this day and age, but now we're seeing like Walmart parking lots turning into drive-in theaters.

449
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:14,800
Heck, there was a big deal this weekend over at the old miniature golf course, the mine shaft here locally, a bunch of the Burning Man crowd went out and turned it into a drive-through art festival.

450
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:22,500
So you actually got in your car and you kind of like drove from station to station and there were different art installations there, which I thought was a really cool idea.

451
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,500
Sadly, I was preoccupied and I didn't get to see it, but I thought it was a neat idea.

452
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,100
So it's really interesting to see how like society is kind of like adapting to that.

453
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:37,900
So so the reason why I bring all that up is that it also demonstrates for some people, there's always going to still be a need for a box.

454
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:48,200
I don't think the box necessarily always just totally goes away, but I think definitely the what goes into that box and all that is definitely a changing system.

455
00:36:48,700 --> 00:37:00,200
Um, St. 100 Matt in our chat says, on the theater point earlier, I think theaters were hurting before the pandemic, but they were starting to innovate nicer seats, serving alcohol and serving real food.

456
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,900
I think gaming needs to continue innovating.

457
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,800
Absolutely.

458
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,000
Yeah, they need to start serving alcohol and real food and gaming as well.

459
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,700
Where's my slash pizza?

460
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,400
Great minds think like us.

461
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:13,900
I love it.

462
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,900
That would be hilarious.

463
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,400
Let's see now.

464
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,900
Phoenix in chat says, at least in the USA, internet speeds will kneecap streaming based games for a while to come.

465
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:26,300
A 100 gigabyte connection is still not cheap and data caps will kill it too.

466
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,000
That's a very good point as well.

467
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,900
Um, so yeah.

468
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,900
Um, then some folks talking about where different drive-ins are being set up in their towns.

469
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Yeah, it's, uh, they're all starting to pop up everywhere.

470
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:37,900
It's fascinating.

471
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:44,800
So I was going to say they go back to, uh, what you were saying with, um, Disney and how the game industry kind of likes to copy.

472
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,700
They already are.

473
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:57,900
In fact, I would say Disney's copying the game industry and the fact that they keep, instead of innovating with brand new original films, they keep churning up, churning out sequel after sequel and remake after remake.

474
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,500
So it's a little bit of the movie industry now copying the games industry.

475
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:14,800
Um, I don't know what's nice though, to see it, as you mentioned with the indie games getting highlighted nowadays, um, as a good source of entertainment, um, look at the whole Xbox.

476
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:19,700
You know, game demos at home thing, but for their event, they did, it was all indie titles.

477
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:27,600
I mean, aside from the remake of, um, Destroy All Humans, but it's all indie titles that you can check out and play.

478
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,800
So that was pretty cool that that's being highlighted.

479
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,600
And we did not too long ago.

480
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:38,600
We even have the steam, uh, the steam indie expo thing that they did as well, a couple of times where you can play indie games as well.

481
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,600
And it's all being highlighted these brand new creators.

482
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:55,300
And even a lot of, um, you know, the stuff that's being shown at the Xbox games conference and not so much the Sony, but they had a lot of indie titles being focused on because yeah, people are kind of getting sick of this stuff.

483
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,700
And there's a lot of these AAA companies they're saying, Oh, this game types, not single player is dead.

484
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:05,800
It's all about this online, you know, persistent environment that is going to be popular, like destiny and stuff.

485
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,100
Whereas people were like, no, we disagree with you.

486
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,000
We're going to create single player games in there.

487
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:17,600
And that's extremely successful because some of these companies are really shortsighted and they'd go where the money is the easiest for them.

488
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:23,600
Uh, Sam Tiberian chat says, anyone have thoughts about on how it might parallel the new paradigm arising in TV?

489
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:29,600
Perhaps the services will become less hardware based, but would that also require a further variety of subscriptions?

490
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:38,600
And my answer to that is probably, I think it's guaranteed that by the end of this next generation, Sony has their own response to Microsoft game pass technically.

491
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:43,600
And I bet some of you are going to jump at this. They kind of already have something. They have PlayStation now.

492
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:50,600
The PlayStation now is also based on a lot of older products and it's different because you're streaming it and the technology isn't quite there.

493
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:55,600
But I think Sony is going to try to launch something that is going to kind of really try to compete with game pass.

494
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,600
I think that's a foregone conclusion. They're going to have to.

495
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,600
Yeah. And like a Phoenix 7, 7, 2, 6 says, you know, a lot of the major companies are already going that way.

496
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:20,600
Like EA, uh, Ubisoft, you know, there's a lot of companies are already piece failing their own like digital streaming stuff where, okay, you get our titles by paying us, you know, some money separate from that you would pay for games pass or PlayStation now or something like that.

497
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:28,600
I'm kind of wish Nintendo would jump on board with that, but I guess we've got some free Nintendo games.

498
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:40,600
I think Nintendo would be open to that idea, but I think in one of Nintendo's biggest struggles is not having the infrastructure means in which to properly set that up.

499
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:52,600
I think it's not that it's an excuse. There's obviously means in which they can go about doing that, but I think they like to keep things in house and not having the infrastructure to run their own servers.

500
00:40:52,600 --> 00:41:03,600
That's why they're online is still trash. Um, but, uh, the idea of a subscription service, I'm sure there want to be on board for it, but they just don't necessarily have the infrastructure means to do it.

501
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:09,600
Um, just team up with Microsoft, put their games on their platform. Microsoft can back the infrastructure and win, win everybody.

502
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,600
Hey, I'm all for that.

503
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:19,600
Delvin. This has been a phenomenal kickoff topic. It's been going on a while though. We were almost an hour into the show and technically I only have Jamie till 7 30 about.

504
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:30,600
I have to kind of move on for time, but thank you so much. This has been a great kickoff topic and discussion. Did you get what you wanted out of it? A good discussion about next gen.

505
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:41,600
Yes, I think it was great. No, it was great. Um, let's talk briefly because I did, I did want you to stick around and let's talk about. So what the next gen looks like in the more immediate term and the Xbox game showcase.

506
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:49,600
So look, if you wouldn't mind, you might have to step on the gas a little bit with what we, uh, saw at this event and just hit some of the highlights. But, uh, what happened at the Xbox game showcase?

507
00:41:49,600 --> 00:42:02,600
Uh, we saw halo infinite. So there is that and people were like, Hey, that's halo, but it doesn't look as good as I was hoping it would be. And so, you know, there's those people as well, but it looks, Hey, it looks like halo.

508
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:17,600
I thought it was fine. I'm into it. Yeah, I'm fine. Um, there's some cool other like indie trailers as well. Like, uh, this game called echo generation. That's a, it kind of has this earthbound type of feel to it and it's like box lace. So it looked pretty cool.

509
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:35,600
Um, hello neighbor too. I know my kids are excited about that one. Uh, this one, I know Jamie's probably pretty excited about Balan wonderland or wonder world. I'm sorry. It's, uh, the developers behind, um, Sonic and nights, uh, Yuji, Naka and Oshima.

510
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:51,600
So that looks happy. Sweet. Uh, can't wait about that. Uh, state of the K look, uh, three look pretty cool. Uh, of course, for some motor sports, we got, you know, the car porn stuff for that. Didn't really show much gameplay, but I mean, it looks pretty.

511
00:42:51,600 --> 00:43:01,600
There's always, there's always a racing game to show off the power of the console always. And you know, it, it looks nice. I'm not into the simulation stuff as much as I am the arcade stuff, but it looked nice. It looked pretty.

512
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:18,600
Yeah. Uh, we've got a new original game from rare called Everwild. They look kind of cool. Um, so to check that out a new game from dot nod, uh, which is tell me why so that the story on that looks kind of interesting as well.

513
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:33,600
Um, grounded was one that was, uh, they showed another trailer for, and, um, I like how obsidian coast poking fun at themselves with that. You know, if you're waiting for the biggest game in the industry, wait for cyberpunk, but the smallest game choose ours.

514
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:46,600
Um, so they have that they're going to have that's coming to Xbox preview on July 28. So right around the corner, honey, I shot the kids, the game. Although I think it's, it's, it's like a Minecraft type or it's like it's arc survival, but junior.

515
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:59,600
I got, yeah, it looked cool. So that was pretty neat. Um, the outer wilds, uh, or outer worlds, we're getting a new expansion. So the peril on Gorgon and it looks pretty awesome.

516
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:13,600
Um, and then of course the other thing that obsidian was teasing is their brand new, um, franchise that they're star or I'm hoping it's a franchise, but big open world RPG called avowed, which is basically, Hey, we're obsidian.

517
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:27,600
And we're going to create our own elder school Skyrim now. And I'm all for that. It looks great. Um, what else? So they announced that destiny twos coming to games pass because it's already everywhere else.

518
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:38,600
Um, stalker two was kind of unexpected. So they showed a trailer for that. Uh, talked a little bit about hell blade to, um, psycho knots to another trailer for that as well.

519
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:49,600
And including a song by Jack black, this game called the gunk that is supposed to be, um, kind of a next game in steam world.

520
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:58,600
Uh, Tetris effect is going to be getting an update and is also going to be coming to the Xbox one and series X with multiplayer as well.

521
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:16,600
Um, a new Warhammer game, dark tide, a fancy star online two is coming to the console 2021. So that's pretty sweet. We saw some more like gameplay of, uh, the medium, which looks exactly like silent Hill would be.

522
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:23,600
And last but not least, they tased us with a little bit with fable. So there's going to be a brand new fable game and I'm all for it.

523
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:38,600
Um, Bobby and chat says, I don't, I didn't think Tetris effect connected was an update. I thought it was a new game. I believe it's like an enhancement to the base game and I could be wrong, but I heard it is also coming to PlayStation and the Epic game store.

524
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,600
It's not going to be exclusive to Microsoft. It's just that it will be a part of game pass.

525
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:54,600
Yeah. It's, um, they're going to be adding multiplayer to the existing game and it's coming out. It's a free update, um, coming next summer. I don't know why so far away, but that's what they're doing.

526
00:45:54,600 --> 00:46:08,600
Uh, quest buster and chat says, can't wait for a vowed. It takes place in the same world as the pillars of eternity series. Yeah. Look, look pretty hot. So quickly, um, from, and just open the floor, what were your impressions overall, uh, on the Xbox event?

527
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:19,600
I thought it was a great infomercial for game pass, honestly, like I was watching this whole thing going, yep. You know what? I'm going to keep my game pass subscription. There's a lot of good stuff coming out that I'm going to want to play and, and stay up on.

528
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:26,600
And so if that was Microsoft's ultimate goal was to sell game pass. Cool. They got me, they got me gal.

529
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:35,600
I wish we had gotten that rumored announcement that games pass is going to replace Xbox live gold. I guess we'll have to wait for their next presentation.

530
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:41,600
Wait for the system presentation. Maybe we'll get that. Um, Delvin, what about you? What were your thoughts?

531
00:46:41,600 --> 00:47:04,600
Um, you know, when I looked at the offerings of what Microsoft showed versus what Sony showed, if, you know, in terms of games, um, Microsoft showed me more reasons to jump on board with them, whether that be by getting a series X or, you know, signing up for game pass.

532
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:21,600
And I think they just want people to sign up for game pass. Um, and, uh, ultimately one of the other things that I did notice and find interesting was the absence of a number after Halo, Forza and Fable.

533
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:39,600
Well, Fable, I mean, it's still kind of early and I don't know if they would necessarily throw a number there. They may just try to reboot the whole thing. Same with Forza. I mean, they'll probably have a number with that Halo Infinite. I mean, we already has kind of a, sort of a number.

534
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:56,600
I don't think Fable will get a number. I think, and a lot of people are misthinking it's a remake of the original Fable. I think the true subtitle is Molyneux Free Fable. Fable, Molyneux Free, but they can't say that. So this is, this is what it's going to be.

535
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,600
I think it's going to be a re-imagining.

536
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:14,600
Oh, absolutely. And Playground Games, they made Forza Horizon that like revolutionized racing games. So like, I don't want to set the bar too high, but oops, like it's, it's up there. I'm expecting big things from Fable.

537
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:29,600
And honestly, like the games pass, it is, it's like, that's the thing is when you're looking at, and I know what some of the news coming out of the Xbox conference thing is that a lot of these exclusive console launch exclusives or whatever, aren't necessarily exclusive.

538
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:42,600
Some of them are timed exclusive. Some of them are coming out on PC as well. There's a lot of things, but I mean, you know what, Sony does the same thing with their exclusives as well as a lot of the stuff that they had was timed exclusives.

539
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:51,600
But when you're looking to differentiate yourself, games pass is definitely a good way to do that because you're basically saying, Hey, you know, there's a lot of games coming out.

540
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:59,600
And if you want to play them, you could purchase each one piece of mail, or you can pay 15 bucks a month and you get them all.

541
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:08,600
I mean, that's not really a hard sell for folks that are probably paying for more than one streaming service at a time as it is.

542
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:13,600
I mean, it's, it's not, it's a real easy sell is what it is.

543
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:30,600
So I think that's definitely has an edge over Sony right now unless they kind of come out and really, you know, do some updates to PlayStation now, because right now I'm not all down with the constant streaming services with them.

544
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:38,600
I wish I had a way to download their titles and I wish there's more in there, but we'll have to see how they kind of flush that out.

545
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:47,600
Sg100Matt in chat says, I do feel a little sad that this means we won't be getting a new Forza Horizon for a while, but I get it. We're getting a new Forza Motorsport in its place.

546
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:56,600
Yeah. And there's also, I mean, there could be multiple teams within playground games that is, you know, a possibility, but also I do believe we heard that Forza Horizon 4.

547
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:02,600
I don't think it was in there, but like a supplemental press release or tweet Forza Horizon 4 is going to get like a series X boost.

548
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:11,600
So there will be like a version of that game that will play a little better. Yeah. So, um, anyway, we got to move on with the show and get to some of the other headlines for the week.

549
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:19,600
Delvin, you did such a good job. Thank you for your topic tonight and being our first guest host for the kickoff topic.

550
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,600
No problem at all. Feel free to have me on whenever you need.

551
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:27,600
I know you probably weren't planning on sitting here for an hour, but thank you so much for doing so anyway.

552
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,600
No problem. Do you have anything to plug? Are you still streaming these days or what are you up to?

553
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:40,600
I haven't been streaming much. So, I mean, you could definitely go follow my channel, which is twitch.tv slash VGrealness.

554
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:46,600
But no streaming has been happening there as of lately, but definitely go follow and I'll be back soon.

555
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:52,600
When that Phantasy Star 2 New Genesis thing comes out, that might be a thing.

556
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,600
She screamed when that happened.

557
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:00,600
I let out a little, a little like, as well. So it's pretty, yeah.

558
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:14,600
I will leave with this last point regarding Phantasy Star Online 2. When I saw it, it looked like Xenoblade Chronicles X was meant to be played.

559
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:25,600
Like, you know, the massive worlds, online, multi-players, people actually in your party going and, you know, exploring the world.

560
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,600
That's what it looked like to me, so it got me excited.

561
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:36,600
Alright. There's a lot to be excited about in gaming right now. You know, the next gen of games is exciting. There's a lot of good stuff coming out, that's for sure.

562
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,600
Absolutely.

563
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,600
Alright, Delvin, thank you so much for being here tonight. Take care.

564
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,600
Good night.

565
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,600
Alright, good night.

566
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,600
Good night.

567
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:55,600
We are going to talk quickly about our gaming weeks. So let's get into how was your gaming week. And we'll start with Dark Soccer. How was your gaming week?

568
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:04,600
I played Animal Crossing, Some Words with Friends. I played that weird word circle game that I'm kind of into right now.

569
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:12,600
Hold on, there's something else on here that I was playing. Actually, no, not really, because I've been kind of back into reading comics.

570
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:21,600
I've rediscovered my love of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and I am reading the entire IDW series now.

571
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:30,600
And so I'm like, oh yeah, I have games to play but comics. So, c'est la vie.

572
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,600
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

573
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:43,600
So I played a little bit of Paper Mario, The Origami King still, so I've been going through that quite a bit, really enjoying that game.

574
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:57,600
I played a little bit of Animal Crossing because everybody's been bugging me to play it, so I finally got my first expansion, well, the first bit of my house and just going through that.

575
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:06,600
And of course, Minecraft most of the week as well, just doing more things than that, building more automated farms.

576
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:13,600
My son now wants me to build him a modern mansion across the street, just one mansion, so it's fine.

577
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,600
Just a little mansion, yeah.

578
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,600
Just a little mansion, it's all good. So I've been gathering resources for that.

579
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:36,600
I built a really cool creeper head door yesterday, so that was kind of fun. It took several hours to get the redstone correct in the Bedrock Edition because it works very differently than, say, other, you know, the Java Edition stuff.

580
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:45,600
And then a little bit of Orna as well. I haven't been playing as much lately, but I've been making sure to get my wars in each day and doing the gauntlets and stuff like that.

581
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,600
So I've been playing a little bit of that.

582
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,600
That's pretty much it.

583
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:56,600
My gaming week has not been quite as varied as previous weeks. I didn't get to experiment with a lot of new games this week.

584
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:01,600
I spent most of the weekend doing Pokémon GO and the Pokémon GO Fest that happened.

585
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:14,600
I did an impromptu stream with Shane last night on my personal channel, so if you want to hear us talking for two hours about that, you can go over to my personal channel at Rob Roberts on Twitch and check out the archive there.

586
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:19,600
But I will say quickly, because obviously I don't want to just be like, and I'm not going to tell you my thoughts otherwise.

587
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:27,600
The Cliff Notes version, and having done Day 2 as well, the $15, the price tag was a little steep, I think, for what they offered.

588
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:37,600
And I think they did not make very clear what it was you were going to be paying for from the outset, and I think there's going to be an expectation of Niantic in the future.

589
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:44,600
What do free players get, what do everybody get, and what am I really getting for my $15 so people can make a more informed decision?

590
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:59,600
I don't want to be overly negative on it. They've been very challenged with having to change these games on the fly, because all their games, like Ingress and Pokémon GO and so forth, are about bringing people together.

591
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:08,600
And 2020 is the year not to do that with the pandemic going on. So I will give them some slack that they were really challenged to do that.

592
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:16,600
And I think they've made a lot of great quality of life upgrades to Pokémon GO to make that happen, and they've done some of that with Ingress as well.

593
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:26,600
But I just think at the end of the day, the price tag was too high, and it didn't really deliver enough, because it wasn't a new area. It didn't feel that new.

594
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:35,600
Sure, there were a couple new Pokémons, there was a quest chain, it got me to do that Team Rocket fighting stuff that I don't like doing, but it was so easy to do today.

595
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:42,600
Like, I had to go through it and get my Shadow Mewtwo, and what is it, the Victory L or whatever that thing, the mythical is that you get at the end of it.

596
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:49,600
I had to do all that, and so it got me to do that, so I was cool, I guess I was cool with that, but I think $15 was a little high.

597
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:56,600
I think maybe like $5 would have been awesome, $10 would have been like, okay, but I think $15 was just a little bit too high.

598
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:06,600
So, and some folks in chat, yeah, S.G.O. and Hermat says, I wasn't too crazy about day 2, and Act F says, but day 1 also had its really good stuff.

599
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:14,600
I did try one new game this week through Game Pass, and that was Ark Survival Evolved, which I'd never played before, I didn't know anything about it.

600
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:20,600
And it was kind of neat, but I had no idea what the hell I was doing, because this game doesn't have a tutorial.

601
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:26,600
Or there's a lot of screens that you can just read, read, read, read, but who has time to do that? You want to get in there and you want to play.

602
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:37,600
And so it took me a long time to figure out, like, oh, I can beat up a rock, it's basically Minecraft, but a little more realistic with this whole prehistoric kind of, you know,

603
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:45,600
you wake up and you're on this beach, naked by yourself, and you have to learn to eat, you have to learn to, you know, craft things and survive,

604
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:56,600
and eventually you get to tame the dinosaurs and make the world your own. And it's a cool concept, but like, I just, I felt really sloppy and stupid getting through the first hour or so.

605
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:04,600
And I guess maybe that's, some people like that, some people like that kind of challenge, I just want to make maybe like a little more hand-holding,

606
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:13,600
like Minecraft does this now and it does it very well, like it's like, it walks you through making like the base set of tools and understanding what those tools do and then it turns you loose.

607
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:21,600
And I would have just liked to see a little more of that from Ark, but I don't think it necessarily like ruins the entire game, I definitely have slept on this game otherwise,

608
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:28,600
and I like those kind of like crafting open world games right now, so I'll probably go back to it and try it again and see.

609
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:40,600
And as that says, I've been playing mobile, I love it, I had no idea that it was even like on mobile until you started sharing those screenshots in one of our chats, but yeah, with Xbox,

610
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:56,600
it's got a nice version on there and it's weird to play it with a controller though, like some of, I feel like this game was made for phones or PC slash Mac because it feels really clunky on a controller, that's the only problem.

611
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:09,600
So, no, my house didn't get burned down by somebody else, I didn't even build a house, I didn't get that far, I didn't know what I was doing, it took me forever just to like realize that like I could like mine a tree for wood, that whole type of thing.

612
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:22,600
Alright, anyway, let's move on, we got a lot of stories to get into tonight, and I know Dark Sakura sadly can only stay with us a little longer, though you said your schedule is changing real soon so we'll get to have you for full shows again, which will be awesome.

613
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:32,600
That will actually be next Sunday, where I go back to my normal schedule, so I'll be off on Sundays and going in later on Mondays, so I can do a full show again.

614
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:39,600
Alright, well, while we have you, let's make sure we get some news from you, so why don't you start us off tonight with our first story, Dark Sakura.

615
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:51,600
Well, we actually have, you know, everything old is new again right well there's been a very interesting little teaser that's come up.

616
00:58:52,600 --> 00:59:03,600
And it was on the official G4 TV Twitter, and the attack of the show Twitter and the X play Twitter, which were all reactivated to tweet this.

617
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:24,600
And it had responses from many people who are on the network before. And so now all of the, those accounts, the three accounts say we never stopped playing in their bio. So yeah, there is a teaser out there, teasing the return of G4.

618
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:33,600
There's also a funny thing is that it ends with Pong, which of course we know that that's how the channel went out.

619
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:44,600
And we're starting to see like I said the host, the old host are pretty much retweeting and getting in on it so we'll, we'll see what happens.

620
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,600
I don't know. I'm.

621
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:58,600
I don't know if it's going to be the network I think it might be just like some of the shows, but we'll see.

622
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:07,600
Phoenix 7726 in our chat room over twitch.tv slash fog network says this announcement gets a five out of five.

623
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:17,600
All right, I'm down for it for that as long as like, I mean I'm good with it, I hope it comes back and it does well.

624
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:32,600
I was out of nowhere. Yeah, I think I have this figured out, I think I Nancy drew this and figure this all out and I arrived at a very similar conclusion to what Bobby Blackwell was talking about before us here when he started tonight.

625
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:47,600
And I think what this is all about. I think if you look at who owns G4 still and who owns the rights. It's Comcast universal it's one of their products, and there's another thing that Comcast universal just recently launched they're putting a lot of stock into because

626
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:57,600
they want to be able to compete with everybody else that's launched one of these, and that's peacock their online streaming service. And I think there's a match there I think if you actually go into peacock the streaming service.

627
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:10,600
There's lots of nonstop all day channels you can watch in there, and CBS all access has this to you can watch your local CBS station and a couple, I think there's like an entertainment tonight channel and a CBS like sports channel, you can watch those all day.

628
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:19,600
There's free apps like Pluto and to be where you can watch like TV channels that are just you know like old school TV channels that's what they are.

629
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:34,600
But they're because now it's on the internet, you have these very niche, sort of channels that show very like niche types of programming. So on peacock we have like a channel that shows old Saturday Night Live bits all day, or old Jimmy Fallon and tonight show stuff.

630
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:46,600
So I think G4 is going to fit real nicely right into there, and they might be showing some of the old stuff, which is maybe why the hosts have suddenly started on Twitter again. I think y'all need to level set your expectations.

631
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:53,600
I would not expect Morgan Webb and Adam Sessler to be coming back to do new episodes as x play, they might do a cameo.

632
01:01:53,600 --> 01:02:00,600
They might hand the baton to somebody else, but I would be really surprised if they were to come back and do the show because they've moved on in their careers.

633
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:12,600
Morgan Webb is in the games industry. She's with some game company I think down in Southern California, and Adam Sessler I think went to some I think he's outside the games industry now, if I remember right I don't I can't profess to be their biggest

634
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:27,600
fans and follow their every move. So I just, I, but I know they've moved on in their careers, as has you know somebody we were working with many years ago and you know I still try to keep tabs on Scott Rubin, who is a big part of G4 TV and a big part of the foundation

635
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:40,600
of G4, you know he's moved on with stuff that he does, working with the ice cream stuff at Burning Man and some of the production company and stuff so like, you know, everybody's kind of like moved on in their careers, so I'm not so sure we should expect

636
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:53,600
all these old hosts to get back together again. I think we'll probably see some new stuff, but I think it might be mixed in with old stuff that they're going to show like on this G4 peacock thing, but I think G4 will be a branding for a couple of things.

637
01:02:53,600 --> 01:03:05,600
E-sports, don't take your eye off of that because I could totally see that peacock might want to cement itself as an E-sports streaming thing, and they could leverage the G4 brand to do that so there's that.

638
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:22,600
But then also they might try to create bingeable shows they might try to create 10 new episodes x play to binge and they'll be under like the G4 label, and it'll be a part of peacock, but I would, if I bet money on this type of stuff and I would, I would bet G4 and peacock are tied together.

639
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:28,600
But we'll see. It might not end up being that at all. It might end up being like a Twitch channel or something like that like a lot of people are thinking.

640
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:36,600
I hope it's not all just the old stuff. I hope that they do new content for it because it would be kind of disappointing if it's just reruns of the old things.

641
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:43,600
And also speaking of reruns, can we get some Starrcade in there please?

642
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:54,600
Can I host the new Starrcade? Everybody on Twitter, every personality on Twitter is like, I want to be on the new G4. I want to be on the new G4 when we don't even know what the fuck it is.

643
01:03:54,600 --> 01:04:05,600
So, you know, y'all can look me up if you need a host for Starrcade, but I'm not exactly going to hold my breath either. I'm sure they have their eye on plenty of other people, but I'd be the best.

644
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:12,600
Gaming has changed since G4 went off the air. Esports is more of a thing that everyone with a video service is fighting to get.

645
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:17,600
Gaming brings in a lot of money now. It feels like a perfect storm for G4 to come back.

646
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:24,600
Crystal Sykes 80 in chat says Morgan Web is working with a new company from Riot Refugees. I knew there was something there.

647
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:34,600
So, yeah. Tiger Claw says the G4 that's relaunching won't be the G4 you remember. I see this more as using an existing brand because of the recognition.

648
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:40,600
I agree with that, and don't forget the G4 you remember could be one of like three or four different things.

649
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:48,600
Do you mean the early G4 that many of you folks who got introduced to our show through All Games and Scott and all that, is that the G4 you remember?

650
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:55,600
Or do you remember G4 Tech TV? Or do you remember when they dropped Tech TV and they were G4 just with Attack of the Show?

651
01:04:55,600 --> 01:05:02,600
Or do you remember reruns of Cops? Which G4 are you looking for? Which G4 do you want?

652
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:12,600
So, anyhow, it'll be interesting to see what comes of it. It really will. I'm very curious, but we'll have to just kind of hold our breath.

653
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:18,600
Oh man, I would love for Tech TV to come back. Can they come back on the air too?

654
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:24,600
I know everybody's talking about it. Everybody's talking about Attack of the Show coming back. How about the screensavers?

655
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:27,600
Hello, that's the show I'd love to see come back.

656
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:31,600
They have their own screensavers. It's still on the air.

657
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:38,600
Leo Laporte is this week in tech and that's like if you want to follow him, that's where he's at.

658
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:46,600
Well no, he actually does a show called the screensaver. I think he does the new screensavers now. I think that's what it's called.

659
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:53,600
And it is a streaming video show now. I'm pretty sure. I don't think it's this week in tech still.

660
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:59,600
I know he does his podcast and everything. I'm pretty sure that's a live video show though.

661
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:04,600
Alright, well we'll see. We don't have a lot else to go off of on the G4 thing for now.

662
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:09,600
Let's move on with some more news. Loki, you were talking about a game a little bit earlier.

663
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:22,600
Yes, I did talk about a game a little bit earlier. So this is pretty cool. This is, I think, actually part of their pre-show that they did for the Xbox gaming event or press conference.

664
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:27,600
But they were showing off a brand new game. It's being published by Square Enix.

665
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:40,600
And of course, it combines the talents of Yuji Naka and co-creator of Nights Into Dreams, Naoto Oshima.

666
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:46,600
And it's this game called Balan Wonderland, which I am now playing in the background of my video stream.

667
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:55,600
And it is every, it just exudes the essence of Nights. It is a 3D platformer game.

668
01:06:55,600 --> 01:07:03,600
What's kind of cool though is you get these costumes which each have their own powers that sort of remind me a little bit of actually Mega Man as well.

669
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:10,600
And so it's going to be something that's going to be coming to Xbox One and the Series X in 2021.

670
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:23,600
But yeah, I'm down for a brand new game from these guys. And just, it was probably one of the more exciting announcements even before the show started, which is pretty sweet.

671
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:33,600
So yeah, I mean, I'm down. And this is one of these games that you don't need to push like really great graphics to have a really fun looking game.

672
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:39,600
But even seeing that for the graphics is pretty great. So bring it on. Let's do it.

673
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:49,600
Yeah, it looks cute. And Dark Sakura, I know you're a big Nights fan. You and your husband have a Nights tradition around Christmas time for Christmas Nights.

674
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,600
So is Balan Wonderland something that speaks to you?

675
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:59,600
Yeah, I'm interested in it. It's on the list. We'll see what happens. It looks really fun, really cute.

676
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:07,600
And it makes me think that Cappy has like a really crazy cousin who decided just to take over people's entire heads.

677
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:16,600
And it should be noted, though, that even though this was part of the Xbox event, it's also coming to other platforms, including Switch.

678
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:20,600
Yeah, I saw stuff about Switch. That's probably what I would want to play it on.

679
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,600
Yeah. All right.

680
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,600
Still exciting.

681
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:30,600
Yeah, it looks good. I can't wait to have a demo or see more info on it so I can get my hands on it and play it myself.

682
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:34,600
Jumping ahead to some Nintendo news, because Nintendo shared a little bit this week.

683
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:40,600
They also had a direct mini this week where they did like a showcase of some upcoming games from their partners.

684
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:47,600
Unfortunately, I think this is one of those things on social media where people set the bar really high, like OMG, Metroid Prime.

685
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:57,600
No, no, it wasn't any of that. And I thought Nintendo made that clear, but sometimes folks get their expectations set a little bit high.

686
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:05,600
So some folks were left disappointed. But if you more level set those expectations appropriately, then you got a few updates that maybe you liked.

687
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:12,600
For example, Shin Megami Tensei 5, I think that's going to be a big deal because that is coming out exclusively to the Nintendo Switch.

688
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:17,600
That is a role-playing series that's gone on forever. It has tons of spin-off types of things.

689
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:21,600
Like, isn't Persona kind of eventually a spin-off of Shin Megami Tensei, essentially?

690
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:31,600
So like, you know, this series is a mainstay in gaming, so the fact that Nintendo Switch is getting the exclusive on the actual number 5 is a pretty big deal.

691
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:40,600
Shin Megami Tensei 3 is getting a remaster, so that's pretty cool. That'll be coming out in Spring 2021 for the Nintendo Switch.

692
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:44,600
Rogue Company is a new shooter that they showed off as well.

693
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:49,600
I know y'all love wrestling, even though wrestling has been a little iffy in the gaming world in the past few years.

694
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:57,600
But WWE 2K Battlegrounds is coming, and it says that it's going to be all new, over-the-top, in-your-face, arcade action.

695
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:02,600
And what else do we expect from the WWE but over the top? That's why we watch it.

696
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:07,600
And then another big announcement, which is pretty cool, Cadence of Hyrule. Yeah?

697
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:12,600
One thing about that is I was hearing, I think that's the one that they're getting CM Punk to come back for.

698
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,600
Oh, that's not on my list, but that would be pretty cool.

699
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:20,600
Yeah, I saw something about that earlier. I think that might be the game.

700
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:25,600
It might be. I'm trying to bring up a story that's got more information on that.

701
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,600
Yeah, Phoenix7726 says WWE games have been really bad for the last five years.

702
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:35,600
That might explain why they're trying to do something different with it, though, for what it's worth. So, who knows?

703
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:42,600
Alright, anyway. And then the one other thing I want to mention, the Cadence of Hyrule, there's going to be three DLC packs for this.

704
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:47,600
And a lot of people are really into that game. It's the Crypt of the Necrodancer meets Zelda songs.

705
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:53,600
There's going to be a character pack with five new characters, a melody pack with 39 new songs,

706
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:59,600
and a third pack for additional story called Symphony of the Mask where you actually play as Skull Kid.

707
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:04,600
So I think it's pretty cool that that game has been so successful because that was really a partnership between

708
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:08,600
an established franchise and indie games and a lot of people are really into it.

709
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:15,600
I think people are going to be very pleased to hear Nintendo is pouring even more into that with the three DLC packs that are coming.

710
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,600
That's pretty frickin' cool. Alright, let's move on.

711
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:21,600
Yeah. By the way, it's a rumor.

712
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:22,600
Oh, it's a rumor.

713
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:28,600
Yeah, I saw it when going through just somebody looking at people, but it was a rumor.

714
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:34,600
Well, we'll see. Alright, Darsakra, maybe you have another rumor for us.

715
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:41,600
I do. And this one actually has, I think, a little bit more credence to it.

716
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:56,600
But one of my favorite mangaka as a comic artist in Japan, Ito Junji, is apparently in talks with Kojima to do another horror project.

717
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:03,600
Ito is supposed to be working on Silent Hills.

718
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:15,600
And I think also did contribute to the PT, so I'm not sure. But for anyone who doesn't recognize Ito's name, a lot of his manga became movies.

719
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:22,600
For anyone who's into Japanese horror, so Uzumaki, and actually there's going to be a new version of Uzumaki coming out.

720
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:33,600
There's the Tomie movies, there's The Groaning Drain, Grave Markertown, The Face Burglar, The Fearsome Melody.

721
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:38,600
I mean, those are some pretty well-known of his.

722
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:49,600
And then he also did a couple of cute comic series called Junji Ito's Cat Diary, Yon and Moon, which is about him and his wife and their two cats.

723
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,600
Cute.

724
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:59,600
But yeah, it looks like there's going to be a collaboration. And I really hope so, because the two of them together could really do amazing things.

725
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:05,600
Well, you know, this also kind of fans the flames of that rumor that Kojima's next game is a horror game.

726
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:11,600
And I know there's been talk, is it, that he got PT and Silent Hills back? Is it that, or is it something different?

727
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,600
I mean, we don't really know. We can speculate forever.

728
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:25,600
But it would seem like if he was trying to work with Ito in these other games, that he would, okay, now I've got a project that's not going to get cancelled because it's under this company.

729
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:31,600
I could come back and, you know, maybe we'll put some of those other ideas we were working on into this new idea, whatever it is.

730
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:37,600
So this definitely kind of fans the flames of Kojima's working on a horror game. We'll see.

731
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:45,600
Well, I do hope that this happens, and I do hope that they work together, because that would be absolutely amazing.

732
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:53,600
Like, I would love to see Uzumaki, but I have snail phobia, so I couldn't see it. Uzumaki is the spirals.

733
01:13:53,600 --> 01:14:04,600
Questbuster in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network says, another side note on Junji Ito, World of Horror on Steam is inspired by him.

734
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:10,600
I tried the free version a while back, and it's pretty great if you love Japanese horror or Lovecraftian stuff.

735
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:13,600
So a game recommendation there from Questbuster. Cool.

736
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,600
All right, well, let's move on with a few more stories. Loki.

737
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,600
Loki, you're muted, Justino.

738
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,600
Sorry, my cat kept...

739
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,600
Believe me, I understand.

740
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:29,600
It's like, I don't know, she wants attention or something.

741
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:38,600
Anyways, all right, so there's some interesting leaks or rumors regarding some updates they're going to be having to Fortnite.

742
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:47,600
So right now, some more teases that there's going to be drivable vehicles pretty soon in Fortnite, which makes sense because they had boats added in there.

743
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:56,600
So I could see that coming out in a new season or something, but they said, you know, fender bender, no sweat, run out of gas, that's not covered.

744
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:07,600
And they talk about the kind of stuff, you know, like fictional insurance company type thing, but that's, you know, from the actual Fortnite Twitter account as well.

745
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:19,600
And of course, you know, folks have been digging into the actual updates and everything, and there's just finding stuff that's been data mined, hints to vehicles coming.

746
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:27,600
So I'm guessing that's going to be coming pretty soon since apparently, you know, that's...

747
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:31,600
Looks like that's where it's pointing to, so I wouldn't be surprised.

748
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:35,600
Could be interesting to see how that impacts the game, like how protected would you be when you're in a vehicle?

749
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:40,600
You know, is there going to be weaponry that could take you right out of a vehicle or get you killed in the vehicle?

750
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,600
I'd be kind of curious how that sort of changes the dynamic of the game.

751
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:51,600
Now, I'm going to fess up, of course, I don't play a lot of Fortnite, but I'd be a fool not to acknowledge what a huge impact it has in the gaming industry.

752
01:15:52,600 --> 01:16:00,600
So any little thing that Fortnite does to change up the formula is something that people are going to be talking about, you know, and probably copying.

753
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,600
Yeah, definitely.

754
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:10,600
All right, well, moving on to other car-based games and one that I think set a lot of standards in the industry, let's talk about Rocket League.

755
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,600
And this is pretty exciting. Rocket League is going to be going free to play.

756
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,600
Rocket League will be getting an update later this summer that's going to make it free to play.

757
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:21,600
This was announced in a blog post that was made by Psyonix, who's the developer of the game.

758
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:27,600
This is also going to be bringing Rocket League to the Epic Games Store and will no longer be on Steam.

759
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,600
That's pretty interesting.

760
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:36,600
Now, I kind of think of this game, too, and I kind of go, most people, I feel like, got this game for free at some point.

761
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:45,600
Most notably through PlayStation Plus gave it away at one point because I feel like when everybody downloaded that game, that's when this game caught fire.

762
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:52,600
And like so many people got turned on to it and it just really ended up being a runaway success.

763
01:16:53,600 --> 01:17:01,600
Obviously, a lot of that is just the strength of the game itself and the fact that Rocket League plays like a familiar yet a very new type of sport where it's like,

764
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:07,600
it's soccer, but it's with cars, or it's all sorts of other games, but with cars.

765
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:12,600
Anyway, so now even more people are going to get to try this out thanks to a free to play update.

766
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:21,600
It will also support cross-platform progression, so your inventory and competitive rankings will be under a unified Epic Games account.

767
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:23,600
That's also very interesting to note.

768
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:28,600
So will you log into that account on the other platforms? It sounds like you might be.

769
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:33,600
Now, if you already own the game on Steam, you'll still be able to launch and play from Steam.

770
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:40,600
So you're not going to be robbed of your game or anything or of any of the updates, but they're just no longer going to actively sell it on Steam.

771
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:47,600
Also, the tournaments will change and the reward challenges will change and there'll be some bonus cosmetics.

772
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:52,600
I imagine if it's going free to play, they want to start to make a little more money off of those cosmetics.

773
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:56,600
Plus, it's probably one of those things where the game's been out for a little while now.

774
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:02,600
I feel like it's been out for three or four years, so it's probably just kind of run its course on how many units it's actually going to sell.

775
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,600
And maybe now if we go to free to play, we can still kind of get some money through some different outlets.

776
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,600
But you know what? Rocket League is still a strong game.

777
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:18,600
I believe it has its own convention because I know our voiceover guy, Jason, really into Rocket League and was that a thing last year,

778
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,600
which obviously I'm sure isn't happening this year because of all the COVID stuff.

779
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:30,600
But yeah, this game is a sport all of its own and this game is something that's probably going to be covered on the new G4.

780
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:36,600
It could probably have its own sports show, quite honestly, and we'll see where that ends up.

781
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,600
So now everybody can play it for free.

782
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:45,600
Alright, moving on. Dark Sakura, we had a game, I remember talking about this game a month ago,

783
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,600
but there's been a lot that's kind of happened with this, right?

784
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:56,600
Yeah, it looks like so. We talked before about a game that's supposed to help with ADHD,

785
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:03,600
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and they're looking at this game.

786
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:15,600
You know, it's being marketed as a way to help children focus and, you know, do little type of cognitive training to help.

787
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:23,600
So they can prescribe the game, a doctor scan, by giving the kids or giving their parents a code to download the app.

788
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,600
It's called EndeavorRx.

789
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:32,600
But there are some critics who are pretty much stepping out against this,

790
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:40,600
including one clinical psychologist named Russell Barkley, who has authored several ADHD books,

791
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:47,600
and he and three other experts reviewed Achilles, the company's research,

792
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:55,600
and said that they were over-promising by implying that they can provide meaningful help for the children struggling in school and at home.

793
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:01,600
And they're talking about on the level of near debilitating neurodevelopmental disorders.

794
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:12,600
And one of the people, Mark Rapport, who is the head of the Children's Learning Clinic at the University of Central Florida,

795
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,600
I'm just going to read the quote.

796
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:21,600
I'm a little shocked and more perplexed about why the FDA would approve this and allow it to be paid for by insurance.

797
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:25,600
I abhor seeing desperate parents spend money based on empty promises.

798
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:33,600
On moral grounds, I think it's wrong to tell people to get their doctors to prescribe this when it does nothing of real-world importance.

799
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:42,600
Yeah, and looking at the trailer for that, I mean, the game looks like the most generic of basic,

800
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,600
like an endless runner type of game.

801
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:52,600
I mean, I can't imagine how that would be any different from, say, anything that's on the App Store right now.

802
01:20:52,600 --> 01:21:02,600
I don't see how this would differentiate itself and be classified as like actual treatment when any of these other games could easily, it's exactly the same.

803
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:09,600
And the company's study was basically saying, and they published it in The Lancet, which is a peer-reviewed journal,

804
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:14,600
found that 36% of children who played the game for 25 minutes a day, five days a week for a month,

805
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:20,600
no longer had a deficit of attention that was measurable.

806
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:29,600
But to quote Barkley, again, the effects just don't generalize. You get better at playing the game and anything similar to playing the game.

807
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,600
So really, it's just repetition.

808
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:44,600
And it's, the studies that have gone out and one of them, there was software invented by Adam, I'm going to mispronounce it,

809
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:51,600
Gazali, who's a neuroscientist at UC San Francisco, he's a board member now for Achilles.

810
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:56,600
And they've done five studies and one of them is unpublished.

811
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:01,600
And they were all either wholly or partially funded by Achilles.

812
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:05,600
So we're starting, I think it is very suspect.

813
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:10,600
I mean, it would be great if a game could help kids with cognitive therapy.

814
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:21,600
But I don't really, I'm feeling more and more skeptical.

815
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:36,600
And another thing that when they did the studies, they were warned that their results were not sufficient enough to have the game listed as a replacement for more established treatments.

816
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:47,600
And they had excluded children taking ADHD medication or who had an additional quote, significant psychiatric problem.

817
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:57,600
The authors did disclose that they found a difference between parents' assessments of the children and the control group who played a computerized word game.

818
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:06,600
So it's really, I don't know, I'm really skeptical of it.

819
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:19,600
And of course, there's also now parents who have children with ADHD, though, who are finding that their children are becoming obsessed with the video games they're playing on a level of addiction.

820
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:25,600
And, you know, serotonin is a good thing, dopamine is a good thing, you know, playing those games affect that.

821
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:33,600
So I think that I'm really, really skeptical.

822
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:41,600
And I mean, it's the same reason I think that people are so quick to try naturopathic methods.

823
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,600
They don't want to think of their children being medicated.

824
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:52,600
But what they don't understand, and I can vouch for this personally as an autistic person, the medications are prescribed for a reason.

825
01:23:53,600 --> 01:24:01,600
Some of us need to have adjustments to our neurochemistry, plain and simple, or else we cannot function.

826
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,600
I cannot function off of my meds.

827
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:17,600
And I understand people don't want their kids to be on this, but at the same time, you know, putting a video game out there when there are better therapies for these children.

828
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:27,600
I mean, yeah, if the game will supplement what they're doing, then as a supplement, that's fine, you know, but not as a replacement.

829
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:31,600
Let me get to some comments from chat over at twitch.tv slash avog network.

830
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:37,600
Bobby Blackwolf says that the differentiation in the game is all the distractions that come in.

831
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:43,600
The things in the trailer to notice is that they have distraction elements all around specifically to distract.

832
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:50,600
So the treatment is to be able to focus on the endless runner portion and not always get distracted by the elements that are flying around.

833
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,600
Note, I'm not a doctor, I just read up on it.

834
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:59,600
And that it is intended to be played in a clinic with supervision from the doctor, not intended to be played at home.

835
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:01,600
It's to be a supplement.

836
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:09,600
Marissa in chat says, I did an ADHD test on a computer and I was worried I was going to ace it out of sheer gaming skills and misrepresent my test results.

837
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:11,600
Nope, still have ADD.

838
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:20,600
And continues, it's like those brain training apps that are popular, but repeatedly shown by studies to not be as effective as the claims.

839
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:24,600
Oh, very interesting comparison there with things like brain training.

840
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:34,600
I mean, those games sure are kind of fun and it feels like, you know, like, oh, I have this kind of like creative outlet and I'm unleashing this creative energy or what have you.

841
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:40,600
But is it really like, is it like a, is it really expanding your brain?

842
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,600
No, it's not doing any of that stuff.

843
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:51,600
It's just like, oh, it's, you know, a different way to kind of stimulate different parts of your brain that might not be getting it otherwise.

844
01:25:52,600 --> 01:26:02,600
Yeah, but it's not teaching any cognitive, any cognitive real therapy. It's just teaching you to play a game. It's a distraction.

845
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:11,600
Kronos Ode in our, Kronos Ode in chat says, I have ADHD gaming has been used for me as a supplement to other treatments.

846
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:17,600
So, um, and Marissa says, I'm being generous there. You learned to ace the game, not cognitive skills.

847
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:19,600
Yeah, I think Marissa and I were thinking along the same lines.

848
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:26,600
Yeah, I think so. All right. Well, um, it sounds like this is a very controversial thing, this game in the medicine world.

849
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,600
I think this is not the last time we're going to hear about this, so we'll keep our eye on it.

850
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:43,600
It, it also tried to do the same thing for, for autistic people. And for the record, I do not use person first language with that simply because you're not like, I'm not a person with autism.

851
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:49,600
I am autistic. It is a part of me and it is not separate from me. I don't like put it in my person, take it with me where I go.

852
01:26:49,600 --> 01:27:00,600
Um, but that being said, there's been, they tried to do some similar therapies like that for, uh, people on the spectrum and to, to very little effect.

853
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:07,600
Only some people really see any kind of benefit from it. Um, just saying, you know.

854
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:15,600
Well, let's move on you guys. We've got a lot more news to cover before we get to our classic game of the week. So Loki.

855
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:24,600
So one of the games, like I said, I was playing is a brand new Paper Mario, the Origami King. Well, apparently there is a game breaking bug in the game.

856
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:35,600
Um, kind of in the middle of the game in this area called the Shangri spa, you get this rainbow VIP pass, which allows you to get into a special area of the game, the spring of rainbows.

857
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:46,600
And apparently if, uh, you leave the area, uh, after visiting the bouncer who takes the pass, you can't get it back. And so you're stuck and can't finish the game.

858
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:51,600
So it's pretty bad that there's this bug that it could possibly break everything. Oh, I guess.

859
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:57,600
Although if you've been used to playing games like Skyrim, you know, there's lots of game requests in that as well.

860
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:09,600
Um, no word on when Intel is going to patch this, but I mean, they've, they're going to have to, obviously, since it's pretty massive bug that allows you to, um, actually have to restart the whole game to get through it. So.

861
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:14,600
Well, I just have to be careful then when I get to that point,

862
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:23,600
as you point out though, um, you know, they're not the first company to have, like, you know, if you align things a certain way, you're going to bork your whole game.

863
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:32,600
Like, I feel like, I feel like this was just recently out there with a recent release. Was it like final fantasy seven remake? I don't want to falsely accuse a game, but there was like another game that had recently come out.

864
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:41,600
It probably was a Bethesda game where like, again, if, if the stars aligned a certain way, you could screw yourself out of beating the game and you'd be stuck and have to start over.

865
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:49,600
So it's just not often we hear it coming out of Nintendo's camp because usually, you know, those games are tested so well and everything's really rock solid.

866
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:54,600
Yeah. So, well, I hope that doesn't happen to me. That would suck.

867
01:28:55,600 --> 01:29:05,600
Well, well now you know what not to do. All right. Hey, so more protection coming out for the PlayStation four, although there already is like a two factor authentication.

868
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:17,600
I know, cause I turned mine on. But you, you get like text messages through it. PlayStation and Sony are actually going to be expanding that as part of the 8.0 system update for PlayStation four.

869
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:28,600
Some of the users that are participating in it have noticed that you can actually use other authentication, authenticating apps from the app store through Apple or Google play.

870
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:36,600
I would imagine things like Authy, Google authenticator, and some of the big apps that are already out there. Like, you know, Twitch supports a lot of these as well.

871
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:42,600
Hell Nintendo, a lot of that runs through Google authenticator. So PlayStation is going to go this route as well.

872
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:51,600
And this actually seems to be for an 8.0 release. This is kind of the big deal about it. There's some other minor things they're saying, but this is another thing.

873
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:58,600
Hey, if it makes more people sign up for two factor authentication, then I think it's a great thing because something I learned over the weekend.

874
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:05,600
And just on a personal note, I had mentioned some of the things that were going on with my dad a couple weeks ago on this show that he had had a stroke.

875
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:12,600
And luckily I called the ambulance on him and he got taken in. He just finished up physical rehab and he was discharged on Thursday.

876
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:19,600
I went to visit him on Saturday and things are looking pretty good that he's going to make a pretty darn good recovery.

877
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:23,600
So I'm really, really thankful for that and really thankful for all the good vibes you all were sending.

878
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:32,600
But I do bring that up because I learned firsthand while I was over there visiting is that he got himself kind of like locked out of his Microsoft account.

879
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:39,600
And he couldn't get a text message to authenticate because he doesn't pay for a text messaging plan. He doesn't have any text messages.

880
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:48,600
But if he had an authenticator app, he could probably use it that way, although I would not expect him to necessarily know how to do all that.

881
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:53,600
He just wants to use his computer, do his genealogy projects. He doesn't want to do anything that fancy on there.

882
01:30:54,600 --> 01:31:01,600
So yeah, this will be another way for people to protect their accounts and I think that will be a very, very good thing.

883
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:09,600
SHO 100 Matt in Chat says, as a special reminder, always sign up for two-factor auth. Strong. Agree.

884
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:20,600
I mean, there may be reasons that are stopping you, such as limited text or whatever, but consider apps, consider, you know, physical key fobs even if you have to.

885
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:27,600
There's lots of other ways to two-factor auth. Please, please, if nothing else, secure your bank account and your email account.

886
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:34,600
Because your bank account is your money and everything else resets through your email. So at least, for the love of God, get those done.

887
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:43,600
Alright. CrystalSykes80 or Skye, excuse me, CrystalSykes. Sorry, I don't know why. Sometimes I read these names so fast, guys. Sorry.

888
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:50,600
And plus, I can't control the colors that are showing up and some of them are dark colors on a dark background and that doesn't help me. So sorry, guys.

889
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:58,600
So CrystalSykes80 in Chat says, I have a two-factor authenticator on my two-factor authenticator. Hey, that's the ultimate in production.

890
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:09,600
Alright, let's move on and let's go back to a classic time when we didn't have to worry about authentication because not everything was connected online.

891
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:14,600
It's a classic segment we like to call the Classic Game of the Week.

892
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:27,600
So DarkSakura is going to step into the gaming vault and she's going to find a game that, hey, forget all these newfangled next-gen things we were talking about at the top of the show. Play this classic instead.

893
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:30,600
So DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

894
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:39,600
The Classic Game of the Week is Red Earth, which I was actually surprised that I haven't done before because I've talked about characters from it.

895
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:48,600
And then I realized it was Cyberbots that I did. So yeah, Red Earth, also known in Japan as Warzord.

896
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:59,600
It is a fantasy sword and sorcery 2D fighting game developed by Capcom and was released in the arcades in 1996.

897
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:09,600
It was the first game for Capcom CP System 3 hardware, the same hardware that Street Fighter 3 and later versions came out on.

898
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:16,600
It is a fairly common game in Japan, but had very minimal distribution overseas.

899
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:29,600
It is the only, to date, CPS3 game that has never been officially ported to home platforms, though, like I said, characters appeared in other games and have been playable in other crossover games.

900
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:37,600
The artwork for it was done by some of the same people who worked on Darkstalkers, the Night Warriors.

901
01:33:37,600 --> 01:34:04,600
A couple of other little things about Red Earth is that it is one of those games that has this neat password feature in it so that you can play the game later on the same skill level that you reached on your one character in your quest mode.

902
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:20,600
So you actually do get experience points in battle. That's if you do either versus, or I think, what's the word I'm thinking of? The story mode, the quest mode.

903
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:37,600
And so with this one, you have your vitality gauge for each of the computer-controlled characters. You get that at the bottom of the screen and it's bigger than your own gauge.

904
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:51,600
So as you land hits on your appointments, coins and treasure chests come out and collecting the coins gives you experience points and then you can use the items in the treasure chest like the orbs for super moves or food to replenish your vitality.

905
01:34:51,600 --> 01:35:07,600
And it makes it work a little bit more like a side-scrolling game, but it's a fighter. On top of this, it is one of the few Capcom games that includes a fatality system.

906
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:22,600
I don't know if they were trying to compete with Mortal Kombat for this one, but Darkstalkers tries to make it more comedic, but Red Earth is more realistic.

907
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:34,600
So like splitting your opponent in half or decapitation or artery rupture or limb slicing or organ removal or all kinds of other gutting, but it is a really beautiful game.

908
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:47,600
It takes place in 1999, first of all, in the Japanese version, on an alternate earth that's stuck in a mythological, medieval, fantasy kind of state.

909
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:57,600
And there's a country that's being led by Blade who's sending out monsters to take over the world and you have four heroes who have to defend it.

910
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:10,600
In the Western version, it takes place in 13XX and shows an earth where there was no industrial revolution or renaissance that progressed the world forward.

911
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:22,600
So your main characters is that you have Leo, who is a giant lion man. He is a 35 year old king.

912
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:32,600
Then you have Kenji, as he was in the US. In Japan, he was called Mukuro, who is like our kind of ninja dude.

913
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:45,600
We have Tessa in the US or Tabasa, who we got in Pocket Fighter, remember? And also she's great because she has four cats who she fights with her cats.

914
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:46,600
My kind of girl.

915
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:51,600
And her cats are also cards in SNK vs Capcom Card Fighters Clash.

916
01:36:51,600 --> 01:37:00,600
And she has a bird named Hato and her frog, Kairu, which means frog, and a dragon spirit called Mano.

917
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:14,600
Also, the last character is called Myling, who's in Japan. She's called Tao, who is actually one of the few characters that hasn't made too much of an appearance in any other game.

918
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:25,600
So yeah, it's a very, very interesting fighting game. I would love to have some kind of home release on this. You hear me, Capcom? Do it!

919
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:36,600
And it's just pretty neat. It's beautiful, is what it is. I mean, it's not hard to see where Street Fighter 3 came from with this one.

920
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:52,600
And of course, for your bad guys, you've got a fossil character. You have a merchant who was changed into an oni, like a demon.

921
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:59,600
You know, you have a character that's half Kraken. I mean, it's pretty, pretty amazing fantasy.

922
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:11,600
And of course, the soundtrack was released, composed by EY Takayuki, with help from Yamamoto Ryoji and Hashisako Wataru.

923
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:16,600
Some of the tracks were reused in Capcom Fighting Evolution, although downgraded a little bit.

924
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:22,600
They did two books about the game in Japan. One was called All About Warzord, that looked into the creation of the game.

925
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:29,600
So that's concept art, screenshots, different details about the game, technically and musically.

926
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:38,600
And then the other one was Gamest number 65 Warzord, which is an unofficial book by Gamest and has a fan art section.

927
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:51,600
There is a Darkstalkers Red Earth crossover manga called Maleficarum. It was published in Japan in 1997 and had a release by Udon Comics in 2010.

928
01:38:51,600 --> 01:39:00,600
And then, of course, Capcom also released figurines from it. And I mean, so now we get on to the legacy of the game.

929
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:14,600
Tessa, also Tabasa, was in SNK vs. Capcom SBC Chaos Super Gem Fighter, and she had a cameo in Leo's ending in Capcom Fighting Jam.

930
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:20,600
She was also in Dr. Strange's ending for Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

931
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:28,600
Leo is a playable character in Capcom Fighting Jam, and he appeared in Hawkeye's ending in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

932
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:38,600
Kenji was also playable in Capcom Fighting Jam. He has a character called Heroes and Heralds in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

933
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:50,600
Myling hasn't appeared in anything like I said, although she did appear in Pyron and Leo's endings in Capcom Fighting Jam and is one of Tabasa's defenses in Pocket Fighter.

934
01:39:50,600 --> 01:40:00,600
So we've had all kinds of different other characters, like GG and other characters appeared in PTX-40A's ending in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.

935
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:04,600
So yeah, just keep your eyes open and they show up again.

936
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:12,600
And actually, another funny thing, if you've ever played Dragon's Dogma, there's a piece of armor called the Cursed King's Belt, with the description,

937
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:22,600
a belt worn by an eliminator, the relic of the king who is cursed to live as a lion. It boosts the wearer's ability to stagger his opponent, so it was a reference to Leo.

938
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:30,600
So yeah, it is a gloriously beautiful game. I sorely wish we would have a release of it.

939
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:40,600
So, for right now, there are ways of playing it, and then, um, yeah, I didn't tell you that.

940
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:44,600
So, isn't it pretty?

941
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:53,600
It is a very good looking game, and I have to admit it's one I haven't really played before, so I'm glad you brought it up. You're right, Capcom needs to put this out.

942
01:40:54,600 --> 01:41:12,600
Yeah, and the animation in it, I mean, you can really, and this is actually one of the things that I enjoy about just watching this game, is that the fluidity in the animation, you can absolutely see where it came in as going into the influence for Street Fighter.

943
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:19,600
So, I'm down for it. The game is pretty awesome, and Capcom needs to bring it to us at home.

944
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,600
Alright, I can agree with that.

945
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:26,600
For the record, I forgot to say that I did get another game this week.

946
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:27,600
Oh, what's that?

947
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:33,600
When I did my class. I got Sega Ages Fantasy Zone for the Sega Saturn.

948
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:40,600
Oh, I just went back to the main show shot, and there's Kitty licking Loki there. It's adorable.

949
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:43,600
But then I stopped killing him for like the last ten minutes, so.

950
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:45,600
She just wanted to come give you kisses.

951
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:48,600
I don't know where the Petittles is. She's fucked off somewhere.

952
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:51,600
I tried to get Smoosh. Smoosh was in here earlier when Delvin was here.

953
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:52,600
I heard him.

954
01:41:52,600 --> 01:42:01,600
Yeah, I tried to get him up on the couch, but he wouldn't do it. We did move his basket, so Smoosh's basket is in the hallway now, because he does use it. So, it's pretty crazy. Anyway, it's adorable.

955
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:03,600
So, Darth Sockra, thank you as always.

956
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:04,600
Kitty.

957
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:16,600
Thank you as always. I know you have to head out for the last time early. Well, for now. But thank you, of course, for being here. You looked marvelous, and good luck, and we'll see you in a week.

958
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:17,600
Do you have any last-

959
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,600
See y'all later.

960
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:20,600
Do you have any last thoughts for our listeners before you hang up?

961
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:25,600
Um, um, uh, words.

962
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:26,600
Okay, good enough.

963
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:33,600
Oh, also, congrats to Shay Cooley, just saying. Even though I was Team Cracker, congrats.

964
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:51,600
I agree. I was Team any of them. They're all wonderful, but it is nice to see Shay get, you know, like a prize after Season 9. Yeah, I'm trying to think of the right word, but like, you know, because I don't want to, you know, devalue Sasha's win, but at the same time, it's like-

965
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,600
Oh, Sasha did earn it.

966
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:57,600
Yeah, Shay really deserves something. So, all right. Anyway.

967
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:00,600
And also, Andina is adorable, and I want to carry her in my pocket.

968
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:03,600
All right. All right. Bye, Jamie.

969
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:04,600
Bye.

970
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:14,600
Thanks. Bye. All right. Let's get into some rapid fire news. So, Loki, if you're able to put the kitty down, let's go to some rapid fire news.

971
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:26,600
Yeah. So, one of the movies that I liked was actually a surprise to like, I mean, I guess I would have liked it anyways because Jim Carrey's in it, but Sonic the Hedgehog, and that came out earlier.

972
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:38,600
So, they have finally announced, because it was a pretty successful movie, that the sequel is coming in April 2022, or to be exact, April 8th, 2022.

973
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:45,600
So, yeah, I can't wait for that movie to finally come out and to check out what they do with it.

974
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:53,600
It's lots of exciting possibilities with that movie, especially with all the teases at the end. So, I'm very much looking forward to that.

975
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:55,600
All right.

976
01:43:55,600 --> 01:44:14,600
And then, since we talked about the whole protest last week with Red Dead and the clown costumes and whatnot, it's kind of funny, though, that right now we finally got the update that there is going to be a brand new update to Red Dead Online out July 28th.

977
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:20,600
So, it's going to be huge, and it's going to be coming out right around the corner.

978
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:26,600
And I guess maybe they heard the protests and are finally making some announcements about it or moving up their announcements.

979
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:34,600
But they didn't say exactly what they're going to be adding to that right now, but I guess we'll get the details coming pretty soon.

980
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:38,600
So, we'll just say that those protests work then.

981
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:43,600
I apologize to the podcast listeners who can't see the video.

982
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:47,600
Can we just take a minute to... No, no, no.

983
01:44:47,600 --> 01:45:03,600
It's an extra special treat for those that are either subscribed to our Twitch channel and able to access the video archive or here with us live just to see your cat licking your beard and grooming you as you're trying to do the news so professionally.

984
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:06,600
Let's just take a minute to appreciate cats.

985
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:13,600
I know some of y'all are allergic or have other reasons for maybe not caring for them, but I guess maybe pets in general, though.

986
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:16,600
Let's just take a moment to appreciate pets.

987
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:22,600
She does this all day. She knows when I'm on calls and everything with my work and everything.

988
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:27,600
She'll come and she'll just stand there and just like, meow, meow, meow, like the entire time.

989
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:28,600
Smoosh does the same thing.

990
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:29,600
Stop it.

991
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:34,600
But Smoosh doesn't do that. Smoosh doesn't do what Stella's doing to you right now, so he doesn't do that.

992
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:46,600
She's just happy because I trimmed the beard, so it's not as long before when she tried to cuddle or whatever, it would poke her in the ear and kind of tickle her or smash her in the face.

993
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:48,600
And so now that Shorts is like, oh, OK, cool.

994
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:53,600
All right. Well, while the cat grooms you, let me try to get a couple stories of my own here.

995
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:58,600
So let's talk about Overcooked. Overcooked, the all you can eat edition.

996
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:00,600
That's right. It's a repackaging of the Overcooked games.

997
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:06,600
It's the first two games and all the DLC, that's 200 kitchens for you to get mad at your friends about.

998
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:10,600
That's going to be coming out for PlayStation five and Xbox Series X.

999
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:14,600
And obviously, a lot of people are I've played the Overcooked games.

1000
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:24,600
J.D., who I haven't seen in chat for a while, but, you know, before all this social distancing stuff happened and I was visiting him once in a while, usually Overcooked would get launched at some point.

1001
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:27,600
And I had I had no idea what the hell I was doing in that game.

1002
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:33,600
So I was just like, I'll just sit here and wash dishes. I'm going to do one thing and I'm going to do it well.

1003
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:43,600
But that game is a lot of fun and getting to interact with people and also getting really mad at your friends when the stage starts like floating and splitting in two and knowing all this crazy stuff.

1004
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:48,600
4K resolution and 60 frames a second for the all you can eat edition. That's pretty cool.

1005
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:53,600
And if you weren't already aware, Mixer's last day was this week.

1006
01:46:53,600 --> 01:47:02,600
And what's kind of interesting is that a lot of the people that were streaming on on Mixer the last day were plugging their Twitch accounts.

1007
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:08,600
You may remember Mixer actually was creating a bridge to Facebook gaming.

1008
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:11,600
But I think a lot of the bridge known once across. Exactly right.

1009
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:18,600
Now, there are some to be fair, there are some people who have decided to take stock in Facebook gaming.

1010
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:23,600
And good luck. May the odds be ever in your favor and so forth.

1011
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:31,600
And I don't want I don't want to talk again. I really don't like Facebook gaming, but has nothing to do with the content creators.

1012
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:35,600
So if that's what you've chosen for you in the path for you, I wish you well. I do.

1013
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:39,600
I won't be watching because I don't support Facebook and I don't think they should be getting into this business.

1014
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:44,600
I'm not going to support them in this business. But, you know, again, I wish you well.

1015
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:48,600
I know it sounds like I'm being an ass. Maybe I am a little bit, but yeah.

1016
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:51,600
But for those that are making their way over to Twitch, welcome.

1017
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:56,600
I hope you're doing OK and getting establishing yourself here and all that good stuff.

1018
01:47:56,600 --> 01:48:01,600
So, you know, good luck. Some folks in comments, it's tough starting over.

1019
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:06,600
One Mixer broadcaster said in a farewell on Mixer, I had 42000 followers.

1020
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:08,600
All of a sudden you have to start over.

1021
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:13,600
And I think that's something we always kind of have to keep in the back of our minds with a lot of this stuff is that we never know

1022
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:17,600
when one day the plug might get pulled. And that goes for Twitch as well.

1023
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:23,600
Although Twitch has been doing pretty well thus far, even less people know who we are.

1024
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:28,600
Yeah. Right. All right. So, hey, a special guest wanted to come join us.

1025
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:31,600
Why not? We had a special guest earlier in the show.

1026
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:37,600
So why not bring another special guest on tonight? Because since we've been talking about, you know,

1027
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:42,600
the news and all this stuff, we're going to bring on a special guest here who does not have a webcam.

1028
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:48,600
So you get the picture of Smoosh instead. So I believe Shane is there on Discord.

1029
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:50,600
Yes, I should be. Hello.

1030
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:54,600
And they're saying, we see Mr. Smoosh. We don't see Shane. Well, Shane doesn't have a webcam anyway.

1031
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:56,600
And you'd probably rather look at Mr. Smoosh.

1032
01:48:56,600 --> 01:49:02,600
So, yeah, I was out in the sun all day and I walked like another eight miles today.

1033
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:08,600
So I am disgusting looking and everything hurts. So you don't want to put up with that anyway.

1034
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:12,600
Real quickly, how was Pokémon GO Fest day two for you?

1035
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:16,600
Better than yesterday. Still not worth $15.

1036
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:22,600
All right. Now, you texted me mid-show, as you sometimes do with your angry feedback about the show.

1037
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:30,600
But for once, I actually felt it was justified because there's a very important piece of news that we haven't talked about yet on the show.

1038
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:35,600
And it's actually not coming up in Part B either. And I know this is something very near and dear for you.

1039
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:39,600
And when you texted me, I was like, oh, shit, yeah, we really should talk about that.

1040
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:41,600
So, Shane, what do you want to talk about?

1041
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:56,600
I want to talk about the newly announced game slash Kickstarter for the spiritual successor to the Suikoden series called Eiuden Chronicle.

1042
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:01,600
And what would you... Tell us more about it.

1043
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:02,600
And that's it.

1044
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:04,600
And that's it. The end. Goodbye.

1045
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:14,600
That's it. So, everybody should know, that knows me, that I'm a huge rabid Suikoden fan.

1046
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:20,600
I have every game, even the dumb card game on Game Boy Advance.

1047
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:25,600
I worked on the fifth game, which was one of the best things I've ever done in my life.

1048
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:30,600
I was going to say, I'm pretty sure we're able to openly talk about the fact that you actually worked on the series.

1049
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:34,600
So, you kind of went literally as far as you can go as a fan.

1050
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:46,600
Yeah, basically. And there hasn't really been a... There hasn't been a new game in the proper series in, I think it's 14 years.

1051
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:52,600
And there was a couple spin-offs that one of them didn't even leave Japan. So, it's like, whatever.

1052
01:50:52,600 --> 01:51:04,600
And so, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, the story writer for the first, second, and third, even though he wasn't credited,

1053
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:12,600
the story writer for the first, second, and third Suikoden games, and a few other people that have been involved in the series,

1054
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:20,600
like the character designer for one and four, they got together and created their own video game studio

1055
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:27,600
and announced this, like I said, spiritual successor to the Suikoden series, Kickstarter goes live tomorrow.

1056
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:36,600
And it looks amazing. It's supposed to harken back to the PS1 JRPG era and what they've shown off so far.

1057
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:42,600
There's a trailer supposedly coming tomorrow as well, but they have a little clip of the battle system.

1058
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:52,600
And it looks like your standard six-person battle system that Suikoden uses, plus an Octopath traveler design.

1059
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:56,600
And it is gorgeous. And I am so excited.

1060
01:51:56,600 --> 01:52:00,600
But with less lens flare, I thought it actually looked better than Octopath, really.

1061
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:11,600
It looks a lot better than Octopath because the Octopath sprites, they look very much like Super NES style sprites, like the 16-bit era.

1062
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:17,600
And this definitely goes to the PS1 where they're a little more detailed, less blocky.

1063
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:21,600
And there's a lot of different features they're adding.

1064
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:27,600
It sounds like they're pulling a lot from the original Suikoden games in terms of battle.

1065
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:31,600
You get a castle that you upgrade.

1066
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:38,600
Its subtitle is 100 Heroes, and so we assume there's going to be like 100 people you can recruit.

1067
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:44,600
Suikoden is famous for having 108 characters in every game you can recruit.

1068
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:55,600
But in this one, they said during battles, if you cast an earthquake spell, it will change the landscape of the battle.

1069
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:58,600
Geomancer confirmed.

1070
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:04,600
They said if you are in a forest and there's trees and you have a ninja character, they can hide behind the trees.

1071
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:07,600
So I don't know what that's all about, but I'm excited.

1072
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:16,600
I'm so pumped up, and the Kickstarter goes up tomorrow at 9 a.m. Pacific.

1073
01:53:16,600 --> 01:53:23,600
So even that quick, and SHO and Hunter Matt, for those of you that are live or watching the archive, just linked the YouTube there.

1074
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:29,600
And it's like a six-second clip, but I'm not as huge on Suikoden as Shane is.

1075
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:37,600
But I appreciate it, and I must admit, I've never beaten it, but I've played a lot of hours on Part 1 and 2.

1076
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:41,600
And it looks gorgeous, and it just fits right into that mold.

1077
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:47,600
And I feel like this is going to be, for Suikoden, what Bloodstained was for Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

1078
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:52,600
Almost like these two games are kind of cut out of a very similar mold, right?

1079
01:53:52,600 --> 01:54:00,600
Well, yeah, and a couple things about that. First, I want to just address what SSJ100Matt says in the chat about it being two years away.

1080
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:08,600
So they're targeting PC to start, and if they meet their goal of only $500,000, that is their goal.

1081
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:10,600
They'll get that easy, yeah.

1082
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:20,600
Yeah, they are going to have a stretch goal for PS5, Xbox Series X, and whatever the next Nintendo Switch is, if it's like a Switch 2.

1083
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:27,600
But they did say that if there is no new Nintendo system, they will work to get this working on Nintendo Switch.

1084
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:31,600
I guess it's too powerful for that.

1085
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:34,600
Crap, I forgot what I was going to say.

1086
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:40,600
Well, then let me read another comment from chat. Bobby Blackwell says, if it's only $500,000, then they have in their funding.

1087
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:45,600
Yeah, so that gets me back on track.

1088
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:50,600
With what you were saying, like how Bloodstained was like the new Castlevania.

1089
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:59,600
Rumor has it is that, yes, they have other funding, and they are working with Igarashi to put this out.

1090
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:08,600
So that's kind of cool. It's another former Capcom, or Capcom, Konami. I don't even know companies anymore.

1091
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:10,600
Who did you work for?

1092
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:14,600
Square Enix. I don't know at this point. I'm so dead from today.

1093
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:21,600
But I'm so hyped for this Kickstarter, so I need to get it out there as much as possible.

1094
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:29,600
I feel like we're going to have a lot of answers. I could do some more forecasting, but I feel like by the time many of our folks hear this on the podcast feed,

1095
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:34,600
that Kickstarter will already be up, and we'll have some of these answers, so I don't want to speculate too much.

1096
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:40,600
But I do expect you'll probably be back next week to tell us all why we should be donating to the Kickstarter.

1097
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:44,600
Or I would love to hear if there was a shocking twist and you're like, ooh, I didn't donate.

1098
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:57,600
Well, I was talking to one of my friends who's also a big fan. I was like, I think we need to remortgage the house so I can do the best backer tier I can get on this Kickstarter.

1099
01:55:58,600 --> 01:56:08,600
What if one of the tiers was like you get to be one of the hundred heroes? That would be so cool, and Dustin would be very mad, but I would do that.

1100
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:13,600
Would you do you, or would you do Miklotov, who you were on VR feed?

1101
01:56:13,600 --> 01:56:19,600
I couldn't use him. He's a Sweetcoat N2 character. That's probably a big no-no.

1102
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:21,600
Yeah, you're right.

1103
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:27,600
There was one other thing I was going to say, and I keep getting distracted.

1104
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:32,600
Haven't you thought of emailing and going, remember me? I worked on the fifth game?

1105
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:40,600
No, because they're not with Konami, and these people that are part of the studio didn't work on five.

1106
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:48,600
But there's already a story synopsis, which sounds a lot like Sweetcoat N2, so everybody's happy.

1107
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:57,600
They have the main character out there, and they have six more supporting characters, and the art is really, really nice.

1108
01:56:57,600 --> 01:57:08,600
And the title art for what you would assume the cover would be looks just like a Sweetcoat N game, down to the cool, fancy frame around the characters in the background.

1109
01:57:08,600 --> 01:57:11,600
It just made me so happy when this got announced.

1110
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:15,600
Well, I'm sure we'll be talking to you again next week about this.

1111
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:22,600
I'm going to talk about it every day to anybody that will listen or won't listen. I don't care. I'll just talk at them.

1112
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:24,600
Who follows you on Twitter, all right.

1113
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:25,600
Yes.

1114
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:33,600
All right, Shane, rest up. Remember, Aloe Vera's great for a sunburn, and maybe don't walk for two days after that.

1115
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:34,600
Oh!

1116
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:35,600
Go fast, you did.

1117
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:41,600
We have two flights of stairs. It's so hard to get around in the house. I don't think I'm leaving my computer chair.

1118
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:45,600
Oh, oh, oh, and one more question, because I'm sure all the listeners want to know.

1119
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:51,600
Between day one and day two, total number of new shinies.

1120
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:53,600
New shinies or shiny?

1121
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:56,600
No, no, no. Total number of shinies caught. Total number of shinies caught.

1122
01:57:56,600 --> 01:58:01,600
Okay, so I actually took a picture, and so I can count these up real quick.

1123
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:16,600
That's easier just to do math. That's 12, 13, 14, 15, 27, and then 33.

1124
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:19,600
Wow. Did you get the shiny gibble?

1125
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:30,600
No. So I got all the shinies I wanted, except for any gibble line. I didn't get a second tangela, and I did not get a survivor.

1126
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:39,600
Everything else I wanted, I got G and O unknowns. I got the non-regionals that we don't, or the regionals we don't normally have.

1127
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:42,600
So I'm pretty happy with my shiny haul.

1128
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:52,600
Yes, I got the shiny gibble. I got something Shane doesn't have, and I even got two, so I have something to hold over his head for a favor when I need it, so we'll see.

1129
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:57,600
And I have two shiny Heatmor. You can have one of those if I can have a gibble.

1130
01:58:57,600 --> 01:59:02,600
Yeah, Heatmor, yeah. All right, I'm gonna let you go, because we can continue on with the rest of the show.

1131
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:11,600
For a change, I appreciate the text message telling me that we're doing it all wrong, because I did want to talk about that Kickstarter tonight, and I forgot.

1132
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:13,600
You're welcome.

1133
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:15,600
All right, take care, my friend.

1134
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:16,600
All right, bye.

1135
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:24,600
All right, going back. Let's get into some world release dates. We're gonna travel around the world and check out some games coming out real soon.

1136
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:26,600
So, Loki, what's coming out in the US?

1137
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:36,600
We have the remake of Destroy All Humans that's coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Stadia. I guess that's a remaster, not so much a remake.

1138
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:42,600
Samurai Shodown, the Neo Geo collection on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1139
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:47,600
We have a game called Lost Wing on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1140
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:52,600
Doraemon, Story of Seasons on PlayStation 4.

1141
01:59:52,600 --> 02:00:00,600
Looks like Hakuoki, Shinkai Gensei No Show on Nintendo Switch.

1142
02:00:00,600 --> 02:00:04,600
Hellpoint on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1143
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:11,600
Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme vs. Maxi Boost On on PlayStation 4.

1144
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:16,600
Root Film on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

1145
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:20,600
Yakuza Kiwami 2 on Xbox One.

1146
02:00:20,600 --> 02:00:27,600
Yoru and Tomosu, that's on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

1147
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:34,600
Cat Quest plus Cat Quest 2 Possum Pack on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

1148
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:39,600
Fairy Tail on PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4.

1149
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:45,600
And last but not least, also Lost Wing coming out on PC and Nintendo Switch. That's it.

1150
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:51,600
Alright, let's talk about Japan and the releases in Japan this week on the Nintendo Switch.

1151
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:54,600
Some similar stuff actually to what I was hearing you talk about.

1152
02:00:54,600 --> 02:00:57,600
eSchool Life comes out in regular and limited edition.

1153
02:00:57,600 --> 02:01:04,600
That Hakuoki Shinkai Gensei No Show comes out in a regular and limited edition as well.

1154
02:01:04,600 --> 02:01:07,600
And there's also a game called Yoru Tomosu.

1155
02:01:07,600 --> 02:01:13,600
And then lastly, Bare Knuckle 4 gets a physical release, special edition and multi-language in Japan.

1156
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:17,600
That is Streets of Rage 4, so it's Bare Knuckle 4 over there in Japan.

1157
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:19,600
So that is all on the Nintendo Switch.

1158
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:22,600
Looking at the PlayStation 4, I expect we'll have some overlap.

1159
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:28,600
And yep, we have Fairy Tail, we have eSchool Life, Bare Knuckle 4, of course, Yoru Tomosu.

1160
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:33,600
But we also have the ChemCo RPG Selection Volume 4.

1161
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:37,600
So another classic collection of ChemCo RPGs coming out in Japan.

1162
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:39,600
I'm trying to load to see what's in there.

1163
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:43,600
Meanwhile, I'll mention also Doraemon Story of Seasons, also out in Japan.

1164
02:01:43,600 --> 02:01:48,600
And Root Film is also out on the PlayStation 4 this week.

1165
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:54,600
So it looks like in this pack, the ChemCo RPG Selection Volume 4 on the PS4,

1166
02:01:54,600 --> 02:02:01,600
we have Cronus Arc for Legerior, something like that.

1167
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:03,600
And let me see, I'm actually trying to find a list here.

1168
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:08,600
Oh, Bonds of the Skies and Monochrome Order.

1169
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:14,600
So some varied stuff there in Japan in a repackaged collection there.

1170
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:16,600
How about Europe, Loki?

1171
02:02:16,600 --> 02:02:21,600
In Europe, we've got Skater XL coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1172
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:26,600
Destroy All Humans coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

1173
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:30,600
We've got Lovecraft's Untold Stories on Nintendo Switch.

1174
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:35,600
Streets of Rage 4 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch.

1175
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:39,600
Looks like The Persistence on Nintendo Switch.

1176
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:43,600
Headmaster Extra Time Edition on PlayStation 4.

1177
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:48,600
Deliver Us to the Moon on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

1178
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:52,600
Fairy Tail on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.

1179
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:59,600
Cat Quest plus Cat Quest 2 Possum Pack on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.

1180
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:01,600
And that's it.

1181
02:03:01,600 --> 02:03:04,600
All right. Let's get to the mailbag.

1182
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:05,600
Every week you guys email us.

1183
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:08,600
Participate at orangelauntrader.com.

1184
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:11,600
And we like to read some emails here on the show.

1185
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:13,600
So we have two emails to read tonight.

1186
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:15,600
And the first comes to us from Fifth Dream.

1187
02:03:15,600 --> 02:03:21,600
And this is a short email, but it's important because it's confessing to making a mistake that I made as well.

1188
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:24,600
So Fifth Dream's email says,

1189
02:03:24,600 --> 02:03:30,600
Don't worry, Rob. I didn't know where the problematic Washington football team was from until you said it.

1190
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:33,600
If you might remember on last week's show, I confessed.

1191
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:38,600
I always thought that when we were talking about Washington's football team, because we had a story about how the name is,

1192
02:03:38,600 --> 02:03:45,600
because, you know, they had a name that, you know, is no longer really acceptable in 2020 state.

1193
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:49,600
It probably wasn't for a long time. But anyway, I digress. You all know what I mean.

1194
02:03:49,600 --> 02:03:53,600
So I always thought this Washington team was in Washington state.

1195
02:03:53,600 --> 02:03:56,600
But it turns out it's a Washington. That's how much I follow football.

1196
02:03:56,600 --> 02:04:04,600
So Fifth Dream is confessing that Fifth Dream also thought that it was not a D.C. related team that was somewhere else.

1197
02:04:04,600 --> 02:04:10,600
And so the only sport I pay attention to is Sumo, closes that email from Fifth Dream.

1198
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:13,600
And SHO 100 Matt says, Well, now they are the Washington football team.

1199
02:04:13,600 --> 02:04:18,600
And yeah, that is that's come out to not just for EA's, you know, patching it into Madden and all that stuff.

1200
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:22,600
But I think they're going to be known as that probably for this whole season or whatever.

1201
02:04:22,600 --> 02:04:28,600
So until they figure out what the new name is going to be, which Bobby Blackwell is suggesting the Kraken,

1202
02:04:28,600 --> 02:04:35,600
just like the new the new hockey team, the Seattle Kraken, whose logo looks like Trogdor the Burninator.

1203
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:40,600
I'm sure many of you saw this as well. Have you seen the Seattle Kraken logo?

1204
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:43,600
It looks like fucking Trogdor. Yeah, it's it's just do that.

1205
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:50,600
The Seattle it'll be the Seattle Trogdors. Anyway, burninating the competition.

1206
02:04:50,600 --> 02:04:53,600
I know that that name really polarizes people.

1207
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:58,600
But I got to say, I'm kind of into it just because I want to I want to go to that arena in Seattle.

1208
02:04:58,600 --> 02:05:03,600
And I want to see obviously once we're past covid and all that stuff, we can go see games in person again.

1209
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:11,600
And I want to be there when that big voice comes out, when they get Liam Neeson to come out and say, release the Kraken.

1210
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:15,600
And then all the players come out. It'll be great. Anyway.

1211
02:05:16,600 --> 02:05:21,600
All right, moving on. We have another email tonight from Carl. Hello, Carl.

1212
02:05:21,600 --> 02:05:25,600
Thank you for the email. And it goes something like this. Hello, LR.

1213
02:05:25,600 --> 02:05:29,600
I've just started listening again for the first time in around 13 years.

1214
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:34,600
Great to see you're still live and rocking and the format is still growing strong.

1215
02:05:34,600 --> 02:05:37,600
The three of you are a great fit. Well, thank you so much.

1216
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:43,600
I love when we get the tweets or the emails like this that are like, I thought you guys stopped this years ago.

1217
02:05:43,600 --> 02:05:51,600
And I used to listen to this show 10, 15. I said it's a point. I said 20 years ago soon, soon.

1218
02:05:51,600 --> 02:05:57,600
But yeah, no. Well, welcome back, Carl. Have you considered going to other platforms also?

1219
02:05:57,600 --> 02:06:05,600
Discord, YouTube, Facebook or Instagram Live? You could definitely reach a bigger audience if it's something you're interested in.

1220
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:12,600
That's a great question. And I appreciate that candid feedback. So I've kind of made my stance on Facebook known.

1221
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:21,600
I just think Facebook has, there's a lot of negative things that have affected our entire society that Facebook perpetuates.

1222
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:28,600
And that is clickbait headlines that aren't necessarily true. And I'm kind of like sick of that type of culture.

1223
02:06:28,600 --> 02:06:33,600
And that's why I don't even have a personal Facebook anymore. I deactivated it. So I can't say we're going to be on Facebook anytime soon.

1224
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:38,600
I mean, we do have a Facebook page, but I'm no longer looking at it.

1225
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:44,600
Maybe Loki and Dark Sakura are they're the admins now. But yeah. Oh, I might. Is that why am I getting notifications?

1226
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:50,600
You might be. Yeah, I don't know. I did respond to someone earlier this week. They're asking when our show was on.

1227
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:54,600
Good job. Take it all because I there to do it. So good. I'm glad. All right.

1228
02:06:54,600 --> 02:07:01,600
I wondered if we should put out like a YouTube video on Twitter or something like that. It says we've never stopped playing, which would actually be accurate.

1229
02:07:01,600 --> 02:07:06,600
Oh, my God. That's a great idea. We should when it's safe to do so.

1230
02:07:06,600 --> 02:07:12,600
We should do it on your DDR machine, because that would be very old school anyway.

1231
02:07:12,600 --> 02:07:16,600
But but some of these other things that you bring up, we actually do exist on.

1232
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:21,600
So discord, we're actually recording over discord due to all the social distancing.

1233
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:27,600
And you can join us on our discord. It's vog network dot com slash discord.

1234
02:07:27,600 --> 02:07:32,600
Again, that's vog network dot com slash discord. And actually, Orange Lounge Radio has a room in there.

1235
02:07:32,600 --> 02:07:39,600
And there's some great discussion that happens throughout the week. Sometimes we were having a discussion earlier this week on God.

1236
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:46,600
Now, of course, I need to think about, oh, it's the G4 revival and all that stuff. And I kind of put my theory about the peacock and all that stuff was in there.

1237
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:52,600
A lot of times on our Twitch channel, too, like when the Xbox event was going on, we host it on the vog network twitch.

1238
02:07:52,600 --> 02:08:05,600
And we'll post a thing about it on discord saying come join us, because that way you can like watch it with like minded chatters and not like a bunch of people trying to spam chat with whatever their dumb things they're saying.

1239
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:14,600
So that's always kind of cool, too. So I'd actually encourage you to join us on discord where we do have a presence vog network dot com slash discord, as far as YouTube.

1240
02:08:14,600 --> 02:08:25,600
So here's the thing. Due to Twitch agreements, we can't because we are a Twitch partner. And there is a part of that agreement that our content has to be exclusive for 24 hours on Twitch.

1241
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:32,600
And that's fine. We don't really mind that. So we don't really produce a lot of content right now for YouTube.

1242
02:08:32,600 --> 02:08:43,600
But I can say I've definitely been thinking about maybe some content that we can premiere on Twitch and trickle down to our YouTube in like, you know, two days after the fact or something like that.

1243
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:52,600
So if you aren't following vog network on YouTube, I would get on that. If you want to go hunting as well, Orange Launch Radio does have an old vog network channel.

1244
02:08:52,600 --> 02:09:00,600
And there are some gems in there, such as there's like a tour of Dark Sakura's vault, and all of her pinball machines. I mean, that clip is probably it was in her old house.

1245
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:11,600
So it's probably like seven years old at this point, but it's still it's still interesting to see the world famous news clip, where they showed Loki in his entire interview goes, oh, it's so much fun.

1246
02:09:11,600 --> 02:09:18,600
And that's the only thing they gave Loki in that entire thing. That is on YouTube as well. It's that clip is so old, too.

1247
02:09:18,600 --> 02:09:25,600
They talk about Governor Schwarzenegger's podcast. Do you know how fucking long ago that was? That's a long time ago.

1248
02:09:25,600 --> 02:09:34,600
So but that's all on the Orange Launch Radio YouTube. That's that's the old news. I would say if you're not following vog network on YouTube, get on that.

1249
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:42,600
We can't put the whole show on there. But we'll probably use clips and some other stuff there later on.

1250
02:09:42,600 --> 02:09:51,600
Oh, did I say I'm sorry, Bobby said I said partner. Sorry, I meant affiliate. And there is a big difference between the two. Sorry, as we're a Twitch affiliate, not partner.

1251
02:09:52,600 --> 02:10:03,600
And then Instagram Live. I'm not sure how to use that appropriately. I'm open to that, like what we can do with that, but it can't be a simulcast of the show.

1252
02:10:03,600 --> 02:10:17,600
If you have ideas, I'm open to it. So let me know. But also Instagram is kind of tied to Facebook. And so I'm a little bit like, but I also know, you know, there's a whole different you're right, there's a whole different audience on IGTV and that stuff that isn't here.

1253
02:10:17,600 --> 02:10:26,600
And so it might be a little smarter to like try to do some advertising there or try to do some like a side project or something. But I haven't even really thought about what that would look like.

1254
02:10:26,600 --> 02:10:40,600
All right. Moving on with Carl's email. Being a UK listener, your live times are a bit late for me. Two a.m. Monday morning. Yeah, sorry. Time zones. But the podcasts are great. And we're going to continue to do them until the show is done.

1255
02:10:40,600 --> 02:10:52,600
I hope you guys are well and staying safe with COVID. Carl, thank you very much for that email, Carl, and some good ideas. Thank you. Thank you. Some multiple folks in chat suggesting an Instagram Live Mr. Smoosh cam.

1256
02:10:52,600 --> 02:11:06,600
Mr. Smoosh has his own Instagram account. Cheap plug. It's at Mr. spelled out. So it's M-I-S-T-E-R Smoosh. All one word on Instagram. So Mr. Smoosh actually has his own account. So you can check that out. Cheap plug.

1257
02:11:07,600 --> 02:11:13,600
All right. Let's move on. We have some more news to get to. Loki, why don't you bring us back to some gaming news.

1258
02:11:13,600 --> 02:11:33,600
All right. So we talked a little bit about some of the allegations with Ubisoft last week and all these people coming out and speaking about them and how some of the upper executives have been let go or have put on leave or whatever the case may be.

1259
02:11:33,600 --> 02:11:45,600
Well, that got, of course, the investors asking questions saying, so what did Yves Guimant know and when did he know it?

1260
02:11:45,600 --> 02:11:51,600
So one of the investors from the analyst firm Jefferies posted the question.

1261
02:11:51,600 --> 02:11:57,600
I wanted to ask the question of Yves as a founder and CEO of the company.

1262
02:11:57,600 --> 02:12:06,600
And more important people than me will ask. But in a sense, I could present the question regarding what's happened recently as a kind of three options.

1263
02:12:06,600 --> 02:12:16,600
Either as CEO, you did not know this was happening, which is not great, or perhaps you didn't know enough and should have asked more.

1264
02:12:16,600 --> 02:12:20,600
Maybe that's the answer. Or you knew, which, of course, would not be good.

1265
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:31,600
Now, those are the possibilities. You may answer the questions differently, but I'd like to ask what would be your answer to the question about your responsibility as CEO?

1266
02:12:31,600 --> 02:12:42,600
Yeah, you have to remember the CEO at the end of the day for a publicly traded company or one that has investors, the CEO ultimately answers to the board, answers to the investors.

1267
02:12:42,600 --> 02:12:51,600
And so this is very interesting to see Yves Guimant be held accountable essentially for what's going on, which is a good thing.

1268
02:12:51,600 --> 02:12:58,600
And the way it's outlined there by the investors, either it was this, either you knew and you didn't do anything, which is horrible.

1269
02:12:58,600 --> 02:13:04,600
You knew, but you didn't know enough, which is also not a good look. Or you didn't know at all, also not a good look. Please explain.

1270
02:13:05,600 --> 02:13:07,600
Right. So he did respond.

1271
02:13:07,600 --> 02:13:08,600
Oh, okay.

1272
02:13:08,600 --> 02:13:19,600
So he responded basically saying that, he says, thank you for your question. In fact, each time we've been made aware of this context, we have made actually tough decisions.

1273
02:13:19,600 --> 02:13:25,600
And we made sure those decisions had a clear and positive impact. So that's very important.

1274
02:13:25,600 --> 02:13:31,600
It has now become clear that certain individuals betrayed the trust I placed in them and Ubisoft's shared values.

1275
02:13:31,600 --> 02:13:40,600
So I have never compromised on my core values and ethics and never will. I will continue to run and transform Ubisoft to face today's and tomorrow's challenge.

1276
02:13:40,600 --> 02:13:48,600
That's a non-answer. So he's just shifting blame away from him, but he really should be aware of this stuff.

1277
02:13:49,600 --> 02:14:01,600
SSJ100Matt puts this very succinctly in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network with this comment saying either he was oblivious, ignorant, or complacent, all of which are bad.

1278
02:14:01,600 --> 02:14:03,600
All of which are bad.

1279
02:14:03,600 --> 02:14:11,600
And I agree with that. But there's an upside, it's not necessarily about this scenario, is that we talked last week about how...

1280
02:14:11,600 --> 02:14:17,600
Oh yeah, completely different. An upside on a completely different topic.

1281
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:27,600
How Take-Two was looking at charging $70 for their AAA games. Well Ubisoft is saying that they're going to be sticking with $60 as their price point.

1282
02:14:27,600 --> 02:14:30,600
So that is what it is.

1283
02:14:30,600 --> 02:14:33,600
And $40 worth of DLC day one.

1284
02:14:33,600 --> 02:14:40,600
Right. Completely separate, but at least there's something positive coming from Ubisoft right now.

1285
02:14:41,600 --> 02:14:47,600
Alright. Well and we know that there are some other changes they've committed to that sound promising.

1286
02:14:47,600 --> 02:14:52,600
Obviously actions speak louder than words and we'll have to see what the long term looks like for that.

1287
02:14:52,600 --> 02:15:02,600
But Ubisoft has a lot to, and especially Yves Guillemin, has a lot to kind of work on right now.

1288
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:04,600
So get to work.

1289
02:15:04,600 --> 02:15:06,600
Alright.

1290
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:11,600
Moving on, on a much lighter note, let's go back to talking about Pokémon GO.

1291
02:15:11,600 --> 02:15:14,600
That's certainly a light and frivolous topic.

1292
02:15:14,600 --> 02:15:19,600
So let's talk about some of the, because they were doing, with GO Fest having happened this weekend virtually,

1293
02:15:19,600 --> 02:15:26,600
they were doing some virtual online stuff with that, including some interviews and some panels and things like that.

1294
02:15:26,600 --> 02:15:32,600
So one of the new interviews was an interview with Matt Sleeman, who's the product lead for Pokémon GO,

1295
02:15:32,600 --> 02:15:36,600
talking about some of the new features coming to Pokémon GO in the near future.

1296
02:15:36,600 --> 02:15:39,600
In one quote talking about Mega Evolutions, he said,

1297
02:15:39,600 --> 02:15:43,600
Yeah, we're really excited for Mega Evolution.

1298
02:15:43,600 --> 02:15:48,600
It's been really important to us as developers and fans of the franchise to get this one right.

1299
02:15:48,600 --> 02:15:50,600
So it's something that we've been spending time on.

1300
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:56,600
The one thing I can confirm is that your existing Pokémon today will be the ones that will be Mega Evolved.

1301
02:15:56,600 --> 02:15:59,600
Do you want to go in the Poké Ball, Mr. Smoosh?

1302
02:15:59,600 --> 02:16:02,600
I don't think you want to go in the Poké Ball. Hush.

1303
02:16:02,600 --> 02:16:04,600
Alright, sorry guys.

1304
02:16:04,600 --> 02:16:06,600
Although you love it and you know it.

1305
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:12,600
Alright, so the Charizard you got at the very beginning of the game, your first Charmander or the one that you evolved,

1306
02:16:12,600 --> 02:16:14,600
those are all viable candidates.

1307
02:16:14,600 --> 02:16:16,600
They can all be Mega Evolved.

1308
02:16:16,600 --> 02:16:19,600
We're excited to get that feature out to you in more detail soon.

1309
02:16:19,600 --> 02:16:21,600
Yeah, I want to see what that's going to look like.

1310
02:16:21,600 --> 02:16:24,600
Because, you know, we might have assumptions based on the mainline games,

1311
02:16:24,600 --> 02:16:30,600
but Pokémon GO has also shown that it's going to do some things like the battle system very, very differently.

1312
02:16:30,600 --> 02:16:33,600
So I'm just kind of curious to see what that looks like long term.

1313
02:16:33,600 --> 02:16:37,600
Now another thing that people have been asking about is when is the level cap going to increase?

1314
02:16:37,600 --> 02:16:39,600
And they did address that.

1315
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:42,600
In another quote from Matt Sleeman said,

1316
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:46,600
This has been something that's been in discussion for a very long time.

1317
02:16:46,600 --> 02:16:50,600
The right way to do a level cap increase has been a topic of much debate internally.

1318
02:16:50,600 --> 02:16:56,600
For us, the most important piece that we wanted to land was we don't want the level cap to increase

1319
02:16:56,600 --> 02:17:01,600
and then all of a sudden people just sort of get set to their new level and that's sort of the end of it.

1320
02:17:01,600 --> 02:17:07,600
We do want the experience to feel a little bit different past level 40 than it has felt up to level 40.

1321
02:17:07,600 --> 02:17:12,600
So fundamentally getting to level 41 and beyond is still going to require effort.

1322
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:16,600
That's really what levels are intended to display is how much effort you put into the game.

1323
02:17:16,600 --> 02:17:19,600
And so that effort economy is still very important to us.

1324
02:17:19,600 --> 02:17:24,600
But it's not going to be as simple as grinding XP through the ways that you might be used to.

1325
02:17:24,600 --> 02:17:30,600
So the experience should be a little bit different and we're excited to announce more of that later this year.

1326
02:17:30,600 --> 02:17:31,600
So we still don't know.

1327
02:17:31,600 --> 02:17:38,600
Oh I can't wait for them to announce that they're going to allow you to prestige and then give you no sort of benefits for that prestige like they did with Ingress.

1328
02:17:38,600 --> 02:17:43,600
Yeah I wonder if they're going to do recursion like Ingress has or prestiging if it'll be something like that.

1329
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:48,600
Or you know a lot of people just theorizing because Ingress ties advance.

1330
02:17:48,600 --> 02:17:54,600
You know when Ingress first started there was only eight levels and they brought eight more levels into the game up to level 16 later on.

1331
02:17:54,600 --> 02:17:59,600
And you had to get badges in addition to their form of experience or AP in that game.

1332
02:17:59,600 --> 02:18:03,600
You had to get badges so could the system be tied to badges?

1333
02:18:03,600 --> 02:18:05,600
I kind of think you run into the same problem.

1334
02:18:05,600 --> 02:18:08,600
There's a lot of people that already have gold badges on a lot of stuff.

1335
02:18:08,600 --> 02:18:14,600
So is it going to be a quest? Is it going to be some type of prestiging system that forces everybody to start over at the same time?

1336
02:18:14,600 --> 02:18:17,600
I don't know. We have no idea what that's going to look like.

1337
02:18:17,600 --> 02:18:23,600
One more comment from Matt Sleeman who says there's a lot of cool stuff we're planning to do later this year.

1338
02:18:23,600 --> 02:18:25,600
There's more features, more Pokemon, more events.

1339
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:35,600
We do want Pokemon Go that lasts a really long time and we think part of that real world appeal is building a game that doesn't just sort of you finish the game, you fizzle out and you feel like the game is done.

1340
02:18:35,600 --> 02:18:40,600
We really do want Pokemon Go to be a game that sort of feels like it's persistent, real, evolving just like the real world is.

1341
02:18:40,600 --> 02:18:46,600
So as we move past 2020 the team's going to be spending a little more time on some of the existing features we have today.

1342
02:18:46,600 --> 02:18:50,600
We've been launching a ton of new features over the last several years and we want to find that right balance.

1343
02:18:50,600 --> 02:18:54,600
So making sure the new stuff's coming out and the stuff that you already like is getting better.

1344
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:59,600
So as we move forward there's still a lot to look forward to and you hope will stick with us on that journey.

1345
02:18:59,600 --> 02:19:01,600
So we'll see what that looks like.

1346
02:19:01,600 --> 02:19:05,600
But I like that they're talking about going back and making sure the old stuff is polished too.

1347
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:09,600
Hell, the gym rework was one of the best things that game ever did.

1348
02:19:09,600 --> 02:19:15,600
So you know if they're going to examine some of the old systems and stuff maybe they'll make the Team Rocket stuff more interesting for me.

1349
02:19:15,600 --> 02:19:18,600
I don't know. So I'm excited to hear that.

1350
02:19:18,600 --> 02:19:27,600
On a somewhat related note, do you remember on last week's show when I talked about my new thing with portal scanning and scanning at graveyards and all that stuff?

1351
02:19:27,600 --> 02:19:31,600
So I didn't really scan at graveyards this week because I was trying to do Go Fest.

1352
02:19:31,600 --> 02:19:41,600
I went to the riverfront in West Sacramento because they have all those information boards and it was like there weren't a lot of kids out.

1353
02:19:42,600 --> 02:19:47,600
But I was doing portal scanning there and guess what happened? I ran out of scans.

1354
02:19:47,600 --> 02:19:52,600
Because the game limits you to 200 scans every 13 days, I ran out everybody.

1355
02:19:52,600 --> 02:19:55,600
I have no more scans available in Ingress.

1356
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:58,600
So no graveyard trips for me for a little bit.

1357
02:19:58,600 --> 02:20:00,600
Hopefully I'll get those back soon.

1358
02:20:00,600 --> 02:20:06,600
Luckily, luckily I had Pokemon Go to distract me and so forth.

1359
02:20:06,600 --> 02:20:08,600
So I'm good for now.

1360
02:20:08,600 --> 02:20:11,600
Maybe I got some back today. I don't know.

1361
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:14,600
I have to go keep checking my... because you can't just see how many scans you have.

1362
02:20:14,600 --> 02:20:16,600
You have to be in range of a portal.

1363
02:20:16,600 --> 02:20:21,600
So I need to go over to the closest portal to me and see like, oh, can I do scans?

1364
02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:22,600
But yeah.

1365
02:20:22,600 --> 02:20:25,600
Yeah, Azet says it's your meta game. It is.

1366
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:28,600
Did you know Azet? Because I was telling Pesh this earlier.

1367
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:35,600
Did you know that on agent stats right now I'm number two in the world for scout controller?

1368
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:40,600
There's one person who got the jump on me who started sooner.

1369
02:20:40,600 --> 02:20:45,600
And it's a res agent, but kudos to them for getting on that early.

1370
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:50,600
But hey, I'm proud to be good at something in this life.

1371
02:20:50,600 --> 02:20:52,600
All right.

1372
02:20:52,600 --> 02:20:57,600
Moving on. Let's get into another kind of serious topic.

1373
02:20:57,600 --> 02:21:00,600
An interesting thing that kind of happened on Twitch this week. Right, Logi?

1374
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:02,600
Yeah, more follow up on more stories we talked about.

1375
02:21:02,600 --> 02:21:17,600
So last week we talked about how Twitch was banning the army from posting their fake giveaways and whatnot on Twitch.

1376
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:28,600
So of course on Twitter, though, it was said that due to the recent media coverage of fake giveaways and potentially unconstitutional bans,

1377
02:21:28,600 --> 02:21:41,600
the U.S. Army Esports team has caused social activity streaming on Twitch and the official activations with Twitch, including participating in upcoming Twitch Rivals events.

1378
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:50,600
So one of the other things that they were criticized for about is that they were banning people that were asking certain questions that they may have been uncomfortable with asking on Twitch.

1379
02:21:50,600 --> 02:22:06,600
And because the army is part of the government in the sense that they have First Amendment, I believe, protections where they cannot silence speakers, you know, based on their viewpoint.

1380
02:22:06,600 --> 02:22:18,600
Kind of like how, you know, like the president wouldn't necessarily or I don't believe the president's supposed to be banning people or at least there's been lawsuits for that.

1381
02:22:18,600 --> 02:22:29,600
Jason and I were chatting about this a little bit before the show and he drew that comparison to when folks sued our president because the president was blocking them on Twitter.

1382
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:43,600
Because technically when you're working for the government and that's a government Twitter account, if I reply to one of the president's tweets and go, fuck you, you fucking fuck, like that's me extending my First Amendment rights.

1383
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:55,600
So the president can't block me for that. Twitter can block me for that because Twitter is a private company and Twitter can say it's our house and in our house you don't say those things to those kind of people.

1384
02:22:55,600 --> 02:23:04,600
They can do that. Twitch, so you kind of apply this here, Twitch can remove people from the chat for saying things and Twitch can do those sorts of things.

1385
02:23:04,600 --> 02:23:14,600
But the army being a government agency isn't supposed to be banning people for exercising their First Amendment right, which is fascinating.

1386
02:23:14,600 --> 02:23:24,600
Right. And unfortunately, they had nothing to add to that. But I mean, really, what is there to add that they were sort of scamming people into joining the army?

1387
02:23:24,600 --> 02:23:29,600
I mean, like, how do you, how do you, whoops, we didn't think we'd get caught.

1388
02:23:29,600 --> 02:23:39,600
If you were told that you could have a Twitch channel and get lots of people to watch, but the catch is you could never ban people from your chat room.

1389
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:49,600
You might think twice about starting on Twitch, you know what I mean? Like being able to ban people from chat is important. And hell yeah, we did it here last week.

1390
02:23:49,600 --> 02:24:00,600
You know, we got invaded by, you know, somebody's basement crew, and we had to do some bands and you know, but we, guess what, we're not the government, we're our own company.

1391
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:05,600
If you piss us off, we'll ban you. So it's interesting. It's fascinating.

1392
02:24:05,600 --> 02:24:10,600
Yeah, maybe they can go back and make the America's Army a game again.

1393
02:24:10,600 --> 02:24:16,600
Hey, they could do America's Army Battle Royale game. There you go. That's, that's hip and trendy.

1394
02:24:16,600 --> 02:24:32,600
I think, isn't it also fascinating though, to hear Twitch and the government, like in the same breath, like it's always fascinating to me to hear about like video games in, you know, because as a, you know, as a kid and growing up again, video games weren't mainstream.

1395
02:24:32,600 --> 02:24:49,600
They were obscure. They were for nerds, you know, so it's like, and like probably one of the most fascinating things to me ever was when the Supreme Court did that ruling with the California law, how like one of the justices said, like, you know, well, my staff plays Mortal Kombat and they turned out okay.

1396
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:56,600
I'm paraphrasing a lot because I obviously don't have it in front of me, but it was just so interesting to hear a Supreme Court justice talking about Mortal Kombat.

1397
02:24:57,600 --> 02:25:12,600
That's like something like 15 year old me never would have imagined. You know what I mean? So it's, you know, I seem to hear Twitch and you, you know, there's a lot of politicians that get onto and you obviously AOC is very well known for having got on some charity streams and so forth.

1398
02:25:12,600 --> 02:25:18,600
And there's, there's politicians that have to participate in video game stuff. This is interesting to me.

1399
02:25:18,600 --> 02:25:29,600
You know, I suggest if they're looking to get away with scams like this, that a good platform to do that on would be Facebook because they don't seem to want to, you know, monitor their stuff anyways. So they could probably get away with that.

1400
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:33,600
Right. You're right. The army should just go to Facebook gaming. It'll be perfect.

1401
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:36,600
They should. They're already, you know, why not?

1402
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:40,600
All right, moving on.

1403
02:25:40,600 --> 02:25:56,600
One more story for you guys tonight and this has to do with some things that have leaked out from Nintendo and you may remember a couple months ago we were talking about that like Nintendo's like console source code was leaked.

1404
02:25:56,600 --> 02:26:15,600
Like somebody got into Nintendo servers and leaked information. Well, now there's even more that's out there leaking and on a very popular forum out there reset era, an anonymous posting started to I'm sorry, I guess maybe 4chan was involved too because, you know, all this kind of stuff usually involves them somehow.

1405
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:28,600
But there's a lot of, I mean, you can approach this with some skepticism, right? Like you can fake screenshots. You can fake even videos. It's easy to make deep fakes and stuff.

1406
02:26:28,600 --> 02:26:41,600
But I don't know, there's some interesting stuff here where I'm like, if somebody faked this, it was really a wasted effort. And what I'm talking about is like a Super Mario Kart version that's a prototype where like the tracks are kind of missing.

1407
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:47,600
Like they're in the bottom half of the screen, but not the top half, but the title screen music is completely different.

1408
02:26:47,600 --> 02:27:06,600
Or some early versions of Super Mario World Yoshi's Island, which in the earliest title screen was apparently called Super Mario Brothers 5, where a lot of the kind of layout of the screen looked very different and it almost like you could see some stuff looked very different.

1409
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:18,600
ActDeftInChat says, Beta Yoshi and L is real. Fifth Dream says, all of this is the same leak, which is funny. I'd have no patience and could drop it all at once.

1410
02:27:18,600 --> 02:27:32,600
So, Dark Tetsuya says, you can't swing a broken joystick on Twitter without finding a ton of this stuff. And yeah, so there's a lot of Super Mario World prototype that had some very different looking Mario in it.

1411
02:27:32,600 --> 02:27:40,600
It looked very, very different, almost like it might have been a different game or a different property at some point. So yeah, there's all sorts of stuff out there on Twitter that's floating around.

1412
02:27:40,600 --> 02:27:53,600
A different character in Star Fox 2 at one point, who is human. And yeah, so it's kind of neat. Like, you know, it's one of the things we're like, huh, this is kind of interesting to imagine what these games could have been.

1413
02:27:53,600 --> 02:28:03,600
But at the same time, some of the people who worked on those games, not happy about this, because this kind of stuff was never meant for public consumption.

1414
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:16,600
But you know something else I saw online recently that this kind of reminded me of? You ever follow the show Quantum Leap, which was like a great show in the 80s on NBC, right? It was awesome, right?

1415
02:28:16,600 --> 02:28:29,600
So Scott Bakula plays a guy who leaps from one home to another. Well, one body to another and ends up in these different stories of the week. The show didn't have a great ending because they didn't know that the show was going to be ending.

1416
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:43,600
So it was like kind of one of those everything was summed up in two title cards at the end of the series. Well, people swore for years that there was like alternate footage that exists where they actually shot like a different ending that didn't make it to air.

1417
02:28:43,600 --> 02:28:56,600
And I think the director or one of the creative minds behind the show said and emphasized, this doesn't exist. You guys are making it up. Well, guess what popped up on Reddit a couple weeks ago? Somebody found the footage.

1418
02:28:56,600 --> 02:29:10,600
And the footage, I mean, it looks really bad because it's, you know, 30 year old, you know, video footage, but it's up there on Reddit. And sure enough, there's this alternate ending that was shot but just wasn't aired for, you know, whatever creative reason.

1419
02:29:10,600 --> 02:29:18,600
The fact that the show got canceled at the last minute and all this stuff. So the reason why I bring up that analogy is, you know, kind of bringing it back to where we started tonight.

1420
02:29:18,600 --> 02:29:30,600
There's a lot of commonplace between the film industry and the game industry. And even though the game industry kind of doesn't like that a lot of these demos and early products kind of get shown after the fact.

1421
02:29:30,600 --> 02:29:41,600
You know what, fans, they want to see it. They want to see those audition tapes for different actors that were supposed to be a Han Solo or stuff.

1422
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:56,600
Didn't like one of those Star Wars releases show like different actors screen testing things? Or was it The Office had like different actors and actresses screen testing for different parts where it was like the girl from 24 reading for Pam.

1423
02:29:56,600 --> 02:29:59,600
And it just looks like completely different, you know, things like that.

1424
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:02,600
They also did like the parody stuff on Saturday Night Live.

1425
02:30:02,600 --> 02:30:04,600
Well, that's different. That's different. But yeah.

1426
02:30:04,600 --> 02:30:12,600
SSJ 100 Matt says, so there is still hope for the Sinbad Genie movie being real.

1427
02:30:12,600 --> 02:30:16,600
That's a different thing. But maybe. I don't know.

1428
02:30:16,600 --> 02:30:24,600
DJ Rama S says, hey, Quantum Leap wasn't canceled. It became Star Trek Enterprise and now NCIS New Orleans.

1429
02:30:24,600 --> 02:30:31,600
Thank you. And Crystal Skies 80 says there is a documentary with all the screen tests for Star Wars. I thought that was a thing I saw.

1430
02:30:31,600 --> 02:30:38,600
Oh, a great comparison by Tiger Claw, the Snyder cut of the Justice League movie.

1431
02:30:38,600 --> 02:30:42,600
Right. Fans have been clamoring and wanting that for a long time.

1432
02:30:42,600 --> 02:30:46,600
And now they're going to get it on HBO Max because of all this pandemic stuff.

1433
02:30:46,600 --> 02:30:53,600
It's like we're having a hard time making new content. So let's give the old content people want. Fascinating.

1434
02:30:53,600 --> 02:31:00,600
Very, very interesting. So anyway, you just can't hide some of the stuff that people really want to see.

1435
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:06,600
All right. I would say to those old developers, you know what? Make the most of it and give us interviews.

1436
02:31:06,600 --> 02:31:11,600
Tell us why things changed. Why did you go a different direction? What was the intent in things?

1437
02:31:11,600 --> 02:31:15,600
You know, like, let's hear more about it. I don't know. Anyway.

1438
02:31:15,600 --> 02:31:22,600
Yeah. Or like even like I like those the GDC talks and stuff where they talk about like game development, different things like that.

1439
02:31:22,600 --> 02:31:26,600
So it'd be cool to find out, like some of these things.

1440
02:31:26,600 --> 02:31:32,600
S21 Hunter Matt talks about Back to the Future shot a good chunk of the movie with someone else playing Marty McFly.

1441
02:31:32,600 --> 02:31:39,600
Yes, that's a big thing that's pretty well known in Hollywood. And of course, now in the moment, I can't remember for life, I mean, who the original actor was.

1442
02:31:39,600 --> 02:31:45,600
But I think it was one of those things where they kind of wanted Michael J. Fox and then he wasn't available.

1443
02:31:45,600 --> 02:31:50,600
And it really wasn't working out with the actor that they got. And then suddenly Michael J. Fox was available.

1444
02:31:50,600 --> 02:31:54,600
So they kind of thank you, Eric Stoltz. Thank you. Yeah, that was.

1445
02:31:54,600 --> 02:31:59,600
And I because I believe, again, Back to the Future came out on Blu-ray at some point.

1446
02:31:59,600 --> 02:32:10,600
And you can actually watch some of the scenes. Voyager Blu-ray, which is out there, has the screens test with Genevieve Bujold.

1447
02:32:10,600 --> 02:32:17,600
Is that her name? It has like the first day of shooting because Kate Mulgrew is not originally Janeway.

1448
02:32:17,600 --> 02:32:22,600
It was that that I think she's French Canadian or something. Genevieve Bujold. I might be messing up her name.

1449
02:32:22,600 --> 02:32:29,600
But you can actually see her on set as I think the character was Michelle Janeway in the beginning.

1450
02:32:29,600 --> 02:32:36,600
And you can actually see some scenes with her in it. And it it does read a little bit awkward. It reads pretty awkward.

1451
02:32:36,600 --> 02:32:43,600
I can see why they changed it. So anyway, Crystal Skies says he's still in the movie too in one scene.

1452
02:32:43,600 --> 02:32:48,600
I didn't know that. And Johnny Woofay says I loved Eric Stoltz in Caprica. So, you know, he got it.

1453
02:32:48,600 --> 02:32:57,600
He worked out at the end of the day. So anyway. Yeah, Bobby Blackwell says they wanted Fox, but the studio didn't think he could lead.

1454
02:32:57,600 --> 02:33:01,600
Huh. Interesting. Interesting. All right. Anyway, it's listener roundtable.

1455
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:08,600
So that's why I keep looking at chat, because if you guys have anything you want us to talk about, by all means, please speak up in our chat room.

1456
02:33:08,600 --> 02:33:12,600
But otherwise, I'll look to Loki to see if there's any last minute stories for tonight. Yeah, there is one thing.

1457
02:33:12,600 --> 02:33:19,600
So a brand new modded Zelda game has come out. So The Legend of Zelda, The Missing Link.

1458
02:33:19,600 --> 02:33:26,600
And it is a mod that it's a brand new game that's been made in the Ocarina of Time engine.

1459
02:33:26,600 --> 02:33:37,600
So it's set between Ocarina and Majora's Mask. And it's supposed to be like kind of a brand new game with different characters and stuff.

1460
02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:43,600
But it's still pretty similar to those. But you can download it because, see, they did the proper thing.

1461
02:33:43,600 --> 02:33:49,600
If you're going to release a fan game for Nintendo, you release it when it's done so they can't do anything about it.

1462
02:33:49,600 --> 02:33:55,600
I mean, they can see it, but it's already out there.

1463
02:33:55,600 --> 02:33:59,600
That's it. Once it's out there, it's out there. That's all you got, huh?

1464
02:34:00,600 --> 02:34:07,600
DJ Rama S. OK, so I brought up in chat talking about the, you know, that show in the UK, the IT crowd.

1465
02:34:07,600 --> 02:34:13,600
It was pretty well. Yeah, it was. Have you tried to get it off and then on again? Like that whole thing comes from that, right?

1466
02:34:13,600 --> 02:34:18,600
They actually did an American version of that. They did like a pilot episode. It's on YouTube. Go look for it.

1467
02:34:18,600 --> 02:34:23,600
It's the IT crowd. Yes, because Joel McHale played a part in it. They had the same guy.

1468
02:34:23,600 --> 02:34:29,600
Richard Ayode, is that his name, who like hosted the Crystal Maze at one point?

1469
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:35,600
I think that's his name. They had him in that pilot as well. So, yeah.

1470
02:34:35,600 --> 02:34:42,600
Yeah. And Crystal Skies says it's so bad. It really is. There's some very fascinating TV pilots on YouTube.

1471
02:34:42,600 --> 02:34:49,600
There was an Elvira TV show because, you know, I love Elvira. They did a pilot for an Elvira TV show.

1472
02:34:49,600 --> 02:34:57,600
And it's her and playing her mom is Mona from Who's the Boss? Catherine Hellman, I think, was her name.

1473
02:34:57,600 --> 02:35:02,600
She passed away a few years ago. But yeah, Mona from Who's the Boss played her mom.

1474
02:35:02,600 --> 02:35:10,600
And it's not a great pilot, but I would have lived for an Elvira TV show. Clarissa, the adult years.

1475
02:35:10,600 --> 02:35:18,600
I don't remember what they ended up calling it, but Melissa Joan Hart legit was in an ABC pilot where she was playing Clarissa taking a job in journalism.

1476
02:35:18,600 --> 02:35:22,600
And like there's a there's a whole pilot for that online somewhere, too.

1477
02:35:22,600 --> 02:35:30,600
Yeah, there's there's a show or a YouTube series I like watching, which I think is called Kill the Pilot or something like that.

1478
02:35:30,600 --> 02:35:37,600
And it's talking about these failed pilots that they did for different shows. You should go check it out.

1479
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:40,600
It's actually pretty cool. I think that's what it's called.

1480
02:35:40,600 --> 02:35:46,600
The one I would have loved to see is they did a pilot for a Dark Shadows reboot.

1481
02:35:46,600 --> 02:35:56,600
Dark Shadows, of course, being the epic vampire soap opera from like the 1960s and 70s, which had a reboot on NBC in 1988.

1482
02:35:56,600 --> 02:36:00,600
I think it was early 90s. It was 91 maybe.

1483
02:36:00,600 --> 02:36:05,600
So they had like a reboot on NBC that was really good, but it was only like one season. So it got cut short.

1484
02:36:05,600 --> 02:36:09,600
So this was before the Tim Burton movie. So which is based on all that, too.

1485
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:16,600
But it's like really compressed everything that apparently the WB did a pilot for a new Dark Shadows.

1486
02:36:16,600 --> 02:36:20,600
And I was really sad it didn't end up happening because I thought that could have been awesome.

1487
02:36:20,600 --> 02:36:26,600
So, yeah. Oh, you have that. Is that Dark Shadows reboot pilot on YouTube?

1488
02:36:26,600 --> 02:36:29,600
I haven't thought to look at it for a long time.

1489
02:36:29,600 --> 02:36:35,600
DJ Rama S in chat says, I know you love game shows, but do you follow Wink Martindale's YouTube channel?

1490
02:36:35,600 --> 02:36:39,600
He posts pilots of game shows on there. Yes, I have seen it before.

1491
02:36:39,600 --> 02:36:49,600
You can actually see Whammy, the Press Your Luck reboot that they did in the early 2000s that didn't end up being that great.

1492
02:36:49,600 --> 02:36:56,600
Like this new version they have with Elizabeth Banks hosting is much better because it keeps a lot of that cheese ball stuff from the 80s.

1493
02:36:56,600 --> 02:36:58,600
But they actually did a version of Whammy.

1494
02:36:58,600 --> 02:37:05,600
So the guy who ended up hosting it beat out Peter Tamarkin, who hosted the original.

1495
02:37:05,600 --> 02:37:09,600
So there's actually the pilot of Peter Tamarkin hosting Whammy is on YouTube.

1496
02:37:09,600 --> 02:37:14,600
And I think that's on Wink Martindale's channel, actually. So that's kind of fun to watch.

1497
02:37:14,600 --> 02:37:16,600
So, yeah.

1498
02:37:16,600 --> 02:37:21,600
DJ Rama S says, don't forget the reboot of the Munsters as 1313 Mockingbird Lane.

1499
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:24,600
I thought they actually aired that as a TV movie.

1500
02:37:25,600 --> 02:37:28,600
Like they didn't order it to a series, but they aired it as a movie.

1501
02:37:28,600 --> 02:37:34,600
As I remember when I went, I went to Universal Studios like right around the time that was set to debut.

1502
02:37:34,600 --> 02:37:41,600
And because I remember they made it a point to say, and this is the house that's used in the upcoming Munsters reboot 1313 Mockingbird Lane.

1503
02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:44,600
And I was kind of like, they're rebooting the Munsters. That's interesting.

1504
02:37:44,600 --> 02:37:46,600
And then it like didn't happen.

1505
02:37:46,600 --> 02:37:50,600
The correct the series name. So it's on YouTube. It's called The Pilot is Dead.

1506
02:37:50,600 --> 02:37:54,600
And it's talking about a lot of these dead pilots that they shot.

1507
02:37:54,600 --> 02:38:02,600
And I know that there's one, I think, for the Clarissa adult series where she's a grown up person.

1508
02:38:02,600 --> 02:38:08,600
There was, I know I've watched that one too. Yeah, Clarissa Now. It's episode nine on there.

1509
02:38:08,600 --> 02:38:10,600
Oh, nice.

1510
02:38:10,600 --> 02:38:16,600
And there's another pilot. So sometimes pilots just become TV movies.

1511
02:38:16,600 --> 02:38:18,600
That happened with Cruel Intentions.

1512
02:38:18,600 --> 02:38:23,600
So the third direct to video Cruel Intentions movie was a Fox pilot.

1513
02:38:23,600 --> 02:38:26,600
They were going to turn Cruel Intentions into a series. It didn't happen.

1514
02:38:26,600 --> 02:38:29,600
One of my favorite movies ever, Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion.

1515
02:38:29,600 --> 02:38:34,600
There's a really terrible like movie that they put on Fox Family Channel.

1516
02:38:34,600 --> 02:38:39,600
That was actually a Romy and Michelle TV pilot with.

1517
02:38:39,600 --> 02:38:45,600
What's her name from Grey's Anatomy that has a reputation for not being very easy to work with.

1518
02:38:45,600 --> 02:38:50,600
She like did one or two movies. She left Grey's Anatomy to do a movie career that didn't really end up going anywhere.

1519
02:38:50,600 --> 02:38:53,600
Because she has a reputation for not being the nicest person. She was in that.

1520
02:38:53,600 --> 02:38:59,600
She played either Romy or Michelle and that pilot didn't end up getting picked up either.

1521
02:38:59,600 --> 02:39:02,600
So I can't remember her name.

1522
02:39:02,600 --> 02:39:04,600
That's it. Thank you.

1523
02:39:04,600 --> 02:39:08,600
Thank you, Riley Schuyler. Catherine Heigl. That's right. That's who it was.

1524
02:39:08,600 --> 02:39:12,600
Oh, Catherine Heigl. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1525
02:39:12,600 --> 02:39:19,600
So sorry. I don't know her personally. I just I've heard she doesn't have a great or at least at that time didn't have a great reputation.

1526
02:39:19,600 --> 02:39:22,600
Maybe she's turned it around since then. I don't know. All right.

1527
02:39:22,600 --> 02:39:27,600
Well, if that's it for last minute stories, then I guess that's going to do it for tonight's show.

1528
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:31,600
Hey, it was a great show tonight. We had a great discussion there at the beginning of the show.

1529
02:39:31,600 --> 02:39:36,600
And lots of great topics. Lots of exciting stuff going on in the industry and more to come.

1530
02:39:36,600 --> 02:39:41,600
You know, we haven't heard the last from Microsoft on Xbox Series X.

1531
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:48,600
We know there's still going to be more from Sony on PlayStation five, such as, you know, date and price and all that good stuff.

1532
02:39:48,600 --> 02:39:53,600
And of course, more games. Nintendo. A lot of pressure to announce like what the hell's coming next.

1533
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:59,600
Nintendo from you guys like first party. So in the coming weeks, I'm sure we're to get answers to all of this.

1534
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:06,600
So it's going to be very interesting time in gaming as we move into the end of the year.

1535
02:40:06,600 --> 02:40:10,600
I'm sorry. I have to read this comment from Pixel Pacas in chat related to soap operas.

1536
02:40:10,600 --> 02:40:16,600
There's a Passions documentary coming. I fucking loved Passions.

1537
02:40:16,600 --> 02:40:18,600
Passions was like the dark shadow within.

1538
02:40:18,600 --> 02:40:23,600
We used to watch that shit in college because it's it was so bad, you guys.

1539
02:40:23,600 --> 02:40:27,600
But like so bad it was kind of good because like it used like what was it?

1540
02:40:27,600 --> 02:40:32,600
Like there was literally a plot line where like the gypsy woman or whatever.

1541
02:40:32,600 --> 02:40:38,600
She was supposed to be the mystic lady or whatever tied somebody to the railroad tracks.

1542
02:40:38,600 --> 02:40:43,600
And she had to like get off. Like it's really cheesy stuff. It was like so bad. It was good.

1543
02:40:43,600 --> 02:40:48,600
I loved Passions. It was it was great. Yeah. Tabitha, Tabitha and Timmy.

1544
02:40:48,600 --> 02:40:53,600
And then Timmy died. So they replaced Timmy with like a female character, I believe, if I remember right.

1545
02:40:53,600 --> 02:40:59,600
So I mean, there's some really problematic stuff in that show that wouldn't hold up all these years later.

1546
02:40:59,600 --> 02:41:03,600
But at the time, it was it was something else. It was it was a trip.

1547
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:06,600
More soap operas should have been like that, to be quite honest.

1548
02:41:06,600 --> 02:41:12,600
But I guess at the same time, on Days of Our Lives, you did have that whole Marlene got possessed storyline.

1549
02:41:12,600 --> 02:41:16,600
Don't you follow soap operas, Loki?

1550
02:41:16,600 --> 02:41:23,600
The most I ever watched soap operas was either on the soup when they were recapping, which was always passions.

1551
02:41:23,600 --> 02:41:28,600
It was always passions. They were recapping. Yeah. Or it was like it was always on TV.

1552
02:41:28,600 --> 02:41:33,600
My grandparents or my sitter's house, like when I was a kid, all my children.

1553
02:41:33,600 --> 02:41:38,600
And so I picked up a lot of that stuff just from being in the rooms with that stuff.

1554
02:41:38,600 --> 02:41:44,600
But like, I don't know, there's way too many twins on that show.

1555
02:41:44,600 --> 02:41:47,600
So I don't get it.

1556
02:41:47,600 --> 02:41:50,600
All right. All right. Let's go around and get final thoughts.

1557
02:41:50,600 --> 02:41:54,600
Thanks to Delvin for being on the show tonight, kicking us off.

1558
02:41:54,600 --> 02:42:01,600
And thanks, of course, to Shane for jumping in there in the middle as well to catch us up on Sweet Code and Spiritual Successor.

1559
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:07,600
And thanks to all you guys for listening tonight, whether it was live or whether you listen on the podcast feed,

1563
02:42:17,600 --> 02:42:21,600
But we need the voices here participating with the show so we can get them out on air.

1564
02:42:21,600 --> 02:42:27,600
Tell a friend or two about the show. An auto host on Twitch goes a real long way.

1565
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:30,600
Love those. Even just a tweet or a social media shout out.

1566
02:42:30,600 --> 02:42:36,600
We love those two. A five star review on iTunes. Sharing the Spotify link. All that stuff is great.

1567
02:42:36,600 --> 02:42:42,600
OK, let's get final thoughts. Running out of things to say. Loki, your final thought tonight.

1568
02:42:42,600 --> 02:42:48,600
My final thought is that I have to build a mansion now.

1569
02:42:48,600 --> 02:42:56,600
Good luck with that. My final thought is I look forward to just playing some more games this week.

1570
02:42:56,600 --> 02:43:01,600
And some more sandbox games I'm going to explore. Probably doing some No Man's Sky.

1571
02:43:01,600 --> 02:43:06,600
I did a live stream last night, which was my first gaming live stream in probably like six months.

1572
02:43:06,600 --> 02:43:11,600
I kind of missed it. So I need to do that more often. And thank you to those of you guys that came out for that as well.

1573
02:43:11,600 --> 02:43:16,600
I know it was kind of late night. So that's it. That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Ons Radio.

1574
02:43:16,600 --> 02:43:21,600
We will see you again in seven days. Thanks so much for being here and supporting the show.

1575
02:43:21,600 --> 02:43:25,600
Your support really does mean the world and has kept us going for 18 years and then some.

1576
02:43:25,600 --> 02:43:28,600
So we'll see you again in seven days. Good night, everybody.
