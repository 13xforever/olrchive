00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,320
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,760

9
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,920
821 of our show for May 24th of 2020.

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,600
Happy Memorial Day weekend by the way to everybody out there.

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,040
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joining you here from Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento,

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,040
California.

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,920
Sadly, with everything going on in the world as you guys know for the last few weeks I've

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,280
been by myself here in studio, but I am joined via Discord.

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,600
That's why you hear some of the shifting noises in the background because they're getting

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,480
set up by my co-hosts.

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,160
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,160
Hello.

19
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,160
Hello.

20
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,880
And also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,880
Hello.

22
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,880
Hello.

23
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,080
Now here's the thing.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,160
So over the past few weeks that we've been doing this, you've only really been able to

25
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,880
hear their voices here as we're on Twitch, whereas we used to all record in the same

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,040
room.

27
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,240
But we've made a few changes because this has ended up being a more long term thing

28
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,720
than we might have thought originally.

29
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,880
And I have some good news everybody tonight.

30
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,880
Ta-da.

31
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,740
You can actually see my co-hosts as we are taping live here on Twitch.

32
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,120
So hello Loki and DarkSakura is actually on cam.

33
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,120
You look great.

34
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,440
Well, it costs a lot of money to look this good.

35
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,720
We should just say, duh.

36
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,240
How have you been DarkSakura?

37
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,800
How's your week been?

38
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:07,680
Oh, gosh, it's been, I've been off work all week for my bereavement leave.

39
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:16,000
It's been thought provoking, quiet, a lot of animal crossing, a lot of another thing

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,080
that arrived last night.

41
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,080
Which we'll get into.

42
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
Yes.

43
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,080
Touch on.

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,080
Yes.

45
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,840
It's been very, very touched by Dan, mostly.

46
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,840
And Loki, have you been?

47
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,840
Oh, sorry.

48
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,840
Go ahead.

49
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,040
I'm just saying that's really, definitely it.

50
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,040
Cool.

51
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
And Loki, how have you been?

52
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,040
Things going well for you?

53
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,360
Yeah, it's been fine.

54
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,980
I cleaned out the garage today and then playing Minecraft.

55
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,220
Looking at our chat room, because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at six

56
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:51,240
o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog

57
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,480
network right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

58
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,800
And you guys in chat seem to really be loving the fact that you can actually see everybody.

59
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Pixel Pocket saying, yay, nice to see everyone together again.

60
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:08,080
Pod Culture is saying, Loki is like, shit, I can't sneak away and make bacon anymore.

61
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,920
I guess he could if he wanted to.

62
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,040
Fifth Dream Today says, I don't think I've seen Jamie talk.

63
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,040
I've seen her.

64
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,680
I've heard her talk, but not at the same time.

65
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,680
So there you go.

66
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
It's a first.

67
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,680
There you go.

68
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,680
I exist.

69
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,680
I'm a real person.

70
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,120
I'm not an A.I.

71
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,640
And in chat, I see that we get to see a view of looks like, yes, you get to see it because

72
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,400
I'm not using it.

73
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,400
So because it's too short and I can't it.

74
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,020
It does me no good when it's way, way down here.

75
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:47,440
My biggest problem is that I keep looking at the TV to see you guys and not the camera

76
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,820
where I'm supposed to be looking.

77
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,220
So this is a new thing for us, obviously.

78
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,940
At some point, I'm going to probably use the sidecar so I can have you guys on the iPad

79
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,820
down here and then it'll be like I'm looking at you guys.

80
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,420
But that will be a future improvement at a later date.

81
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,140
Anyway, so let's get into some gaming news.

82
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,780
The folks that are listening on the podcast feed, because of course, we love you guys

83
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,360
on the podcast feed as well, and it's free and you can listen on all your favorite podcasts

84
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,780
pushing platforms, iTunes, Google Podcasts, Spotify, whatever.

85
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,020
We're on all those things.

86
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,740
And I know many of you listen there and you're like, nothing's different for me, except some

87
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,200
of the audio levels, maybe as things are changing with the webcam, but hopefully everything

88
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
sounds good.

89
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,100
We're at a good level and yeah, let's get into some gaming discussion is what you're

90
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,100
here for.

91
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,900
Let's get into our kickoff topic for tonight.

92
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,460
Loki, I don't know if you want to cover this, but we have a big, we have a birthday in the

93
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,460
house.

94
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,460
Yeah.

95
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,440
Pac-Man is celebrating 40 years.

96
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,320
That's been a long time.

97
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,380
One of the biggest arcade games of all time as well.

98
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:53,880
Definitely famous for a lot of reasons, but yeah, it's 40 years old.

99
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,000
And to kind of commemorate that as well, they were announcing that of course they're doing

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,200
some sort of Pac-Man live studio, which allow you to play multiplayer and upload custom

101
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,840
maps that you can create for Pac-Man.

102
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,120
So it's almost like Pac-Man level editor.

103
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,320
It sounds awesome.

104
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,280
I'm so into that.

105
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,680
And there's, there's just like Pac-Man, they're kind of like licensing him out left and right.

106
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,000
It seems like, I mean, I know we don't get into a lot of that stuff on this show, but

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,740
I feel like there's like more toys and more like, like other like Pac-Man related things

108
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,740
out there.

109
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,000
Like it's the eighties all over again.

110
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah.

111
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,440
Well, I mean, like I said, if I was playing Minecraft this week, so the first thing that

112
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,040
you see advertisement for their marketplace is a little Pac-Man graphic because they have

113
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:47,840
an actual skin pack and like level thing that they've put together for Pac-Man as well.

114
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
That's that's cool.

115
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
I want to check that out.

116
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
Minecraft.

117
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,840
I bet that's fun.

118
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,040
And I'm sure all these people out there are making these fake Minecraft mazes, right?

119
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,760
But they're like creepers instead of ghosts.

120
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,760
I don't know.

121
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,760
Or can you put the ghosts in there?

122
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,760
That'd be kind of fun.

123
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:06,420
They, they, well, it's an add on pack, so you can basically change the you can change

124
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,560
some of the attributes for different things.

125
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,820
You can change how they look.

126
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,760
You can change how things act.

127
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,760
You can do all sorts of fun things with that.

128
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,740
Now going to our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.

129
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,480
Fifth dream today says Pac-Man maker sounds amazing.

130
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,480
OMG.

131
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,720
There was so much Pac-Man merch when it came out.

132
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,680
It was like a giant fucking thing.

133
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,860
Oh, absolutely.

134
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,920
And I don't I don't know how much you guys remember.

135
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,440
Like Loki, I know you're just under 40 years old.

136
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,280
Dark Soccer and I were in our forties, but not not that far into it.

137
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:42,320
Like we were, we were toddlers when Pac-Man was brand new, but I know in the early eighties,

138
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,040
I mean, probably not right when Pac-Man first came out, it probably took a few years, but

139
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:51,680
I remember being about four or five years old, so this would have been like 83 or 84

140
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,640
and Pac-Man really was like everywhere in pop culture.

141
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,120
I don't do you have, do you have memories of like Pac-Man in the eighties, Dark Soccer?

142
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,120
I know I do.

143
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,960
Some of the memories that I have, and we actually still have a little Pac-Man plushie that's

144
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:12,040
got the ghost in his mouth, but I remember I was pretty good on roller skates of playing

145
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:18,640
Pac-Man because my place I would skate at, oh let me move this away, it had Frogger and

146
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:24,320
Pac-Man and a couple other games.

147
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:32,660
I remember being creeped out by the 2600 version and rightly so because it's terra bad.

148
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:38,220
I really though, out of all of the Pac-Man games, I got the most excited when Super Pac-Man

149
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,220
came out.

150
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:44,300
That was kind of my jam and I loved the cartoon.

151
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,780
I watched the cartoon religiously.

152
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,460
I remember the cartoon as well.

153
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:53,180
Like that was, that was a big, big thing when it was first out.

154
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:58,380
And there was, yeah, that was really, I thought it was kind of weird and then of course they

155
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,220
based Pac-Land kind of off of it, or the two were based off of each other.

156
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:10,140
I don't remember the exact order, but it was just, it was really all over the place.

157
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,900
And then there was of course Pac-Man Fever, who was that?

158
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,900
Was that Rick Dees?

159
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,900
Yes.

160
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,900
No, Garcia and Bunkner.

161
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,420
I don't know why I thought Rick Dees.

162
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,860
Oh, I'm such a jerk for not knowing the name off the top of my head because one of them

163
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,980
died like a few years ago.

164
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,780
I remember that was on the show.

165
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,500
Bunkner and Garcia, something like that.

166
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Yeah.

167
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Yeah.

168
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
They're kidding.

169
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,780
I'm looking at our chat.

170
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,580
I also see it in Garcia.

171
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,580
That was it.

172
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,580
Yeah.

173
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,580
Yeah.

174
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,580
Um, I see in chat and this is worth talking about.

175
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,580
We talked about Pac-Man.

176
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,580
Uh, they're talking about the Atari 2,600 version of Pac-Man because that was, you know, there

177
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:50,460
was this whole thing about, uh, how like the Atari 2,600 version of Pac-Man was really,

178
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,500
really bad.

179
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,700
And Oh, by the way, guys, I have another little trick this week.

180
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:00,820
I've been working hard on this long distance OLR thing because there, Oh no, I got, I got

181
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,820
bamboozled.

182
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,820
I thought I had the thing.

183
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,820
All right.

184
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,940
I was, thought I was so cool and had the window up and ready to go, but I guess it didn't

185
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,940
work that way.

186
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,060
I was supposed to be able to show the window.

187
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,060
Oh, well.

188
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,180
Um, now I want to know why that isn't working.

189
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,180
All right.

190
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,180
Anyway.

191
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:23,460
Um, but, uh, we actually have Pac-Man on the Atari 2,600 and, um, it was really like as

192
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,340
bad as it was, it was kind of technologically impressive.

193
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,180
Uh, and, uh, Bobby Blackwell was saying some things in chat about it.

194
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,560
Pac-Man on Atari played badly, but it was a miracle.

195
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,560
It worked at all.

196
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,900
The coder was a genius.

197
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,220
I read a whole deep dive on the Atari 2,600 Pac-Man source code.

198
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,780
It was pretty much the most complex 2,600 game made during the early eighties.

199
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:49,820
Um, tiger call on chat says, and in a rush, yeah, it was, it was made pretty quick.

200
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,220
If I remember right too.

201
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,220
So yeah.

202
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,480
Um, there we go.

203
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,200
I'm trying to see why I can't, now I'm irritated that my, my other little fancy thing doesn't

204
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
work right.

205
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
What does it show?

206
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,260
It was showing me the Twitch window.

207
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,260
Let's try this.

208
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,260
I'm doing it live.

209
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,260
Why not?

210
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,260
There we go.

211
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,260
How about that?

212
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:16,500
So there, there's your, uh, Pac-Man on the Atari 2,600 and it was pretty impressive how,

213
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,900
I mean, it doesn't look right at all.

214
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:25,900
Like Pac-Man looks funky in this whole thing and he eats like a wafer instead of the fruit.

215
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,820
Like it just, it doesn't quite work right.

216
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,020
But I mean, again, it's Catholic Pac-Man doing penance.

217
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,980
It's technologically very impressive.

218
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,700
He's, he's eating communion wafers.

219
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,700
Yeah.

220
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,700
So, all right.

221
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,860
Apparently that did something to my audio, so I guess I won't be doing that again anytime

222
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,860
soon.

223
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,860
Sorry guys.

224
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,860
I don't know what happened with that.

225
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,860
So, all right.

226
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,860
Sorry guys.

227
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,860
There's magic.

228
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,780
I'm, I'm trying some new things tonight.

229
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,780
What can I say?

230
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,780
All right.

231
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:56,900
Uh, anyhow, so, um, other things, other like memories with Pac-Man, anything, Loki, what

232
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,900
about you?

233
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,820
I know, you know, again, you're a little younger, but Pac-Man was everywhere when you were a

234
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,820
kid.

235
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,820
Right?

236
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,820
Right.

237
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:11,060
So basically, I don't remember too many, I remember playing the Atari 2,600 version as

238
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,060
well.

239
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,300
Um, I know I had Pac-Man bedsheets.

240
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,440
You had Pac-Man bedsheets?

241
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
I did.

242
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,720
I do remember those.

243
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,920
Um, so yeah, um, that's as far as I remember because we had a ColecoVision with the Atari

244
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,440
adapter for it so you could play the 2,600 games on there.

245
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,440
And that's how I used to play the, uh, Pac, uh, for the 2,600.

246
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,840
Um, that's all I knew.

247
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,320
And I was like, eh, this is fine, this is Pac-Man.

248
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,840
I didn't know that it was jank.

249
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
That's true.

250
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,200
When I was really young, like the Atari 2,600 version of Pac-Man didn't really bother me

251
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,600
because it was still like, Ooh, it's like the maze game on my TV.

252
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,760
And you kind of knew that all the video games were a little bit messy back in the day.

253
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,760
Yeah.

254
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,240
It's like, you never like, I mean, you just think it's different except for E.T.

255
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,480
Of course, E.T. was garbage and it's like, that's like, I love E.T.

256
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,480
Why don't I?

257
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,480
This game is horrible.

258
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,480
I can't get out of this pit.

259
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,600
I remember playing a lot of kangaroo.

260
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,080
Uh, was kangaroo a better translation of the arcade game?

261
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,080
Yeah.

262
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,080
Yeah, it was.

263
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,080
Yeah.

264
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
Fair enough.

265
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,080
Fair enough.

266
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
Um, so I mean, where, where does Pac-Man go from here?

267
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:30,320
So we have Pac-Man maker is coming out and what other, what are, are there any, does

268
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,920
Pac-Man need to show up in any other games?

269
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,560
I feel like he's been in everything.

270
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:40,440
He's been in Smash Brothers, uh, the championship edition was an amazing, um, in the arcade.

271
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:47,000
He was in the arcade Mario Kart, because, uh, that was the whole Namco, uh, Alliance

272
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
thing.

273
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah.

274
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And F-Zero, right, Rob?

275
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Mmm.

276
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I don't think Pac-Man was in F-Zero.

277
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It was definitely Mario Kart.

278
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Sorry, I am thinking of Mario Kart.

279
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Nevermind.

280
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,600
You're thinking of the Mario Kart arcade because it was a very similar hardware to

281
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,000
what F-Zero ran on and that whole thing.

282
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,680
Uh, fifth dream today in chat suggests Pac-Man and Persona 5.

283
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,560
No, I guess anything's possible, right?

284
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,840
I need the Pac-Man cinematic universe now.

285
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,800
The Namco cinematic universe.

286
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,880
Let me ask one more question on this topic for our chat room, as well as my co-hosts

287
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,160
and on Pac-Man and all this.

288
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:25,120
And that would be, why do you think of all these eighties games we had, for example,

289
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,000
Dark Sakura brought up Kangaroo was a pretty great translation, but Kangaroo didn't exactly

290
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,880
break through the same way with all the merchandise, with all the songs and everything that Pac-Man

291
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
did.

292
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,280
Did Pac-Man last in the cultural icon for this long, do you think?

293
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,880
Pac-Man had the novelty of being out before all of those, number one.

294
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
Fair.

295
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,000
It was also one of the, um, you know, keep in mind for a long time after we had all of

296
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,080
our Pong clones, the big thing was the shooter games.

297
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,080
Like that was when Galaxian, you know, was a thing.

298
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,760
And then having this new maze game was, well, it was something different and something new.

299
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,160
And it spawned how many clones of it?

300
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,000
I mean, we had KC, KC Crazy Chase.

301
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,440
We had, uh, Mouse Trap, which I have on Cliccovision and honestly, it's more fun.

302
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,520
Um, there, there's all kinds of games are really crazy auto, you know, was supposed

303
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,120
to be an improvement on Pac-Man and it was such an improvement that it became Ms. Pac-Man.

304
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,040
So I mean, and on top of that, it's a game that practically anyone can get up and just

305
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,560
start playing.

306
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,240
Kangaroo as an example, since we were using that one, it had a little bit more complexity

307
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,240
to playing it.

308
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,280
It required a lot more, well, a lot different kind of timing.

309
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,040
Pac-Man is just, you don't even need to hit a freaking button.

310
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,040
You just move the joystick.

311
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,120
I think that's an actually, that's actually a really great point, Jamie, because I think

312
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,100
it's that ease of like how to explain it and how to jump into it that makes it so easy.

313
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:02,060
And I think a lot of games, um, before we got to the cell phone game era, and even in

314
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,780
the cell phone game era in many ways, um, things like Tetris, things like Pac-Man and

315
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:11,960
those really easy to grasp games really caught on because you're right.

316
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,700
It's like, it's, it's very intuitive.

317
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,260
Oh, I, I'm this guy and I dodged this guy and I eat these, like, it's very, very easy.

318
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,260
You know what I mean?

319
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:25,360
Um, and then in the cell phone era, I think a lot of cell phone games have done very well

320
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,120
because it's just swiping.

321
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,120
It's just touching.

322
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,900
Uh, Wii Sports did very well because it's like, you play like it's actually a tennis

323
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,520
racket and you swing it like it's a tennis racket.

324
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,560
There's no complicated buttons or anything like that.

325
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,320
Like that stuff does go a long way.

326
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,800
You know, if you try to teach somebody, I don't want to say a non-gamer cause I feel

327
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,620
like in this day and age, everybody's a gamer a little bit, but like if you try to teach

328
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,480
somebody who doesn't play a lot of games, how to play something on Xbox One or PlayStation

329
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,320
4, it's like, Oh my, how many triggers do I, how do I, how do I hold this?

330
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Right?

331
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,880
Like it, it isn't the easiest thing to explain sometimes.

332
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:05,520
I mean, again, I think as we get into different generations and you know, as, as gen X is

333
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,620
getting older and all this stuff, it's like, we all kind of grew up on games, so I don't

334
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,120
think it's quite the same struggle, but it's there a little bit.

335
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,560
Well, and if you take people who go, well, I'm not really a gamer.

336
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,960
I was like, do you like playing Pac-Man?

337
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,120
Oh yeah, I was playing it just the other day.

338
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,120
Even you're a gamer.

339
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,120
Sorry.

340
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,120
Hate to break it to you.

341
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,120
You're not cool.

342
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
Are you a gamer?

343
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,760
Oh no, not really.

344
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,760
Well, do you play Tetris?

345
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,760
Yeah.

346
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,760
Or do you play Pokemon go?

347
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,760
Yeah.

348
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
Well guess what?

349
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
Those are games.

350
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,760
It's you a gamer.

351
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,760
That's right.

352
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,760
Do you play words with friends?

353
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,760
Guess what?

354
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,760
That's a game.

355
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,680
Uh, Mel Chan 13 in chat says Pac-Man is simple to learn and it got hard, but a lot of people

356
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,840
could progress decently enough to not just get discouraged.

357
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,620
I think that's an important point too, is that, you know, it's pretty easy to clear

358
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,160
the first board in Pac-Man.

359
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,840
I mean, granted the dip switches on the arcade machine and things, you know, you could set

360
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,600
all these different crazy difficulty levels and things of that sort.

361
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,200
So, you know, maybe some machines are harder than others, but it's relatively easy to clear

362
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,880
the first board in Pac-Man.

363
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,080
It does not get so easy to clear, like even the second board, I don't know, just depends

364
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,080
on how much you play.

365
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,920
And he's especially like, he's getting a third, fourth board, and then you start to watch

366
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,480
these people to do these crazy, perfect long runs.

367
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,440
It's like the game does get very hard.

368
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,280
It has a pattern though.

369
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:22,560
And it's like people who've played it, think, here's another relation on this one.

370
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,160
The dude who won all those games on Press Your Luck, he memorized the pattern.

371
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,160
That's what a lot of the gamers that are getting those high scores on Pac-Man are doing, is

372
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,560
that they are memorizing the patterns and know when the patterns switch.

373
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,600
And it's easy for them because they're just repeating the pattern, they're playing it

374
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,440
exactly the same way.

375
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:48,040
Like another thing, playing that, the dragon, doing the dragon fight in Mega Man 2 blindfolded

376
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,240
that it used to be able to do.

377
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,320
I was just going to say, patterns are huge in video games.

378
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,320
Look at Mega Man.

379
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,460
Mega Man is the perfect example.

380
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,280
It's, Mega Man is patterns, period.

381
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,040
You have like almost no real RNG in something like Pac-Man.

382
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,680
It was all based on a pattern, based on your movement, and it was predictable because it

383
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,120
was early programming, you know?

384
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,920
So you followed your path, the ghosts would automatically follow their set path based

385
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,920
on where you were.

386
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,800
And as long as you knew where you had to be at one time, you knew what was going to happen.

387
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,880
Can we talk about one other thing with Pac-Man too, that I think you cannot talk about Pac-Man

388
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:29,840
turning 40 and not talk a little bit, at least, about Ms. Pac-Man, the extremely successful

389
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,840
sequel, right?

390
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,840
I brought it up.

391
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,200
Yeah, Pac-Man with a bow in the hair, right?

392
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
So yeah, you did.

393
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
I want to dive a little deeper.

394
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,200
There was more than that.

395
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
Of course, yeah.

396
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,280
Of course, there's more to it than that.

397
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,200
You actually had multiple mazes and things of that sort.

398
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
More than that.

399
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,840
Well, I was just about to ask why, because I think for some people, Ms. Pac-Man probably

400
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,320
caught on even more.

401
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,060
And I was going to suggest it was those cut scenes, those very simple little cut scenes

402
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,340
you get when you, like every other board, right?

403
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,780
Like the chase, it goes to act one, the chase and they chase each other.

404
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,200
Like that was so cool.

405
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,320
And you didn't see that in games, but that was essentially like the first cut scene in

406
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,720
the game in a way.

407
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:16,240
Well, it was originally Crazy Otto, which Crazy Otto was, it was supposed to be like

408
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,480
a spiritual successor to Pac-Man.

409
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:29,600
I actually attended a, what about the word I'm thinking of, a panel about Crazy Otto.

410
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,160
And they've even recreated the original Crazy Otto based on just viewing the animations.

411
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:41,360
And it actually had much more in the way of animation and graphic, what was the word

412
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,280
I'm thinking of, different sprites.

413
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,840
It had more sprites in general than I think Ms. Pac-Man had running.

414
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:54,840
But at the very beginning of it, it was an enhancement kit for Pac-Man that was called

415
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,920
Crazy Otto.

416
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:07,920
And it was being developed and there was a big, hold on, it was General Computer Corporation

417
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,540
that was involved in a lawsuit with Atari because they also did a missile command conversion

418
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,880
called Super Missile Attack.

419
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:23,140
And they were banned from doing future conversions without the consent of Atari or Namco.

420
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:32,100
So what they did is that they actually presented their game to Midway, who distributed for

421
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,380
Namco in the US and, well, at least for Pac-Man.

422
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:42,580
And they were really actually enthusiastic about having it.

423
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,140
And so they all, they bought the rights to it.

424
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:50,880
They worked with GCC and with Namco to get the game ready for development.

425
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,800
They changed a few different things.

426
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:59,240
And of course the cut scenes were already in Crazy Otto.

427
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:05,020
And so all that they did was convert those cut scenes because it had to do with Crazy

428
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:09,000
Otto and his girlfriend or something.

429
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,360
And they were going to rename it to Pac-Woman and then they changed it to Ms. Pac-Man and

430
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,880
then they made her the main character.

431
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,240
And originally this was supposed to be called Super Pac-Man.

432
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,140
And on top of that, all of those changes happened within 72 hours of production.

433
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,840
I knew that it had started as Crazy Otto.

434
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,280
I knew that part, but I didn't realize that they got as far as doing the cut scenes with

435
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,960
like Crazy Otto and they were that far along when they decided to change it and do everything

436
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
as Ms. Pac-Man.

437
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,960
That's pretty cool.

438
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,560
And one of the other things that they did create as Ms. Pac-Man is because more women

439
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,640
in general were playing Pac-Man that they could see, at least through all the polling

440
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,440
and whatever they did to gather the data on it.

441
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,080
And so that was another factor in changing the lead character to female.

442
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,080
Yeah.

443
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,460
And I was going to ask, was part of the reason why Ms. Pac-Man was also such a large game

444
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,680
was maybe that sense that, I don't want to say it catered towards women, but it definitely

445
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,760
empowered women.

446
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,200
And if you guys think in this day and age, in the year 2020, women get a lot of crap

447
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,600
like, oh, women don't play games.

448
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,960
I mean, I like to think that's less in this day and age, although I am not a woman, so

449
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,360
I don't get the brunt of that.

450
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:27,200
But I mean, in the eighties, it was really like, oh, women don't play video games, but

451
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,600
like Ms. Pac-Man kind of was like, but women are the star of video games.

452
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:40,200
I kind of, there was one reason why I didn't mind that stereotype and I'll tell you why.

453
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
Money.

454
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
How so?

455
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,200
Um, you know, like people hustle for pool.

456
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,200
I have a little bit of a habit of hustling in video games.

457
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,200
Oh, this goes back to your, your reign on Tekken back in the day of the arcade.

458
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
No, this goes way before my reign on Tekken.

459
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
Really?

460
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
I did that just to create a point.

461
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,200
Um, I don't know.

462
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,200
I would, I would, uh, hustle for lunch money.

463
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,200
You'd whoop the boy's ass at Pac-Man for money?

464
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,200
Lunch money?

465
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Well, Pac-Man, a few other games, it was like just net stuff or a game boy stuff.

466
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,200
I love it.

467
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Um, you know, I, I, Tetris was kind of my big one for that one, but I could also do

468
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,200
a rate like we would have like little mini races and things, you know, it didn't last

469
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
very long.

470
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,200
Cause once it got out that, yeah, I could actually play stuff and that ended it's like

471
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
a month.

472
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,200
And I think it's also important to note, uh, if we're talking about Ms. Pac-Man, the Atari

473
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,200
2600 version of Ms. Pac-Man is much better.

474
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
Right?

475
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
Yeah.

476
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
Is much better.

477
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,200
And I think it's because they had more space to develop with it.

478
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,200
Like they had an eight kilobyte cartridge as opposed to a four kilobyte cartridge.

479
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,200
So the ghost draw was able to work a little better.

480
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,200
It actually looked a little like Ms. Pac-Man looked a little better just overall.

481
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,200
It was a better translation, but I don't think as many people played Ms. Pac-Man on Atari

482
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
2600.

483
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,200
Actually about the Atari 2600 version in 1984, it won video game of the video game of the

484
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,200
year award.

485
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
Oh wow.

486
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,200
And well for Atari 2600 and in 83, it tied for the arcade awards with ladybug.

487
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
Huh?

488
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Interesting.

489
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
Just saying people were playing it.

490
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,200
People were significantly playing it.

491
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,200
I would, I would just see people when I was, you know, again, I was really young, but as

492
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,200
little older than you and I would see people crowding around it at the, at, you know, what

493
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:40,200
the arcade Aladdin's castle back in the day was my arcade with its carpeted ass walls.

494
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,200
I have gotten carpet burn on my arm from running into those walls.

495
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,200
Just saying.

496
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,200
Um, I remember playing Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, especially Ms. Pac-Man on the cocktail machine

497
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,200
at the yogurt shop.

498
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,200
I remember that totally because they had that machine forever, but like a little more of

499
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,200
my arcade memory, excuse me, a little more of my arcade memory.

500
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,200
Like I actually remember playing things like the star Wars cabinet that you actually would

501
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,200
get inside.

502
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,200
Uh, and, um, there was that, that was a bad-ass machine.

503
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
Uh, the star Wars went crystal castle.

504
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,200
So it was an early favorite of mine too.

505
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,200
Yeah.

506
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,200
So, but obviously there was plenty of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man cause those machines were

507
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,200
everywhere.

508
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Right.

509
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,200
Yeah.

510
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
All right.

511
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
Uh, one of the thing, one of the thing is I love this comment from chat cause I want

512
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
to bring this up too.

513
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,200
And then we've got to move on and talk about our gaming weeks, but a vid powers five 73

514
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,200
and chat says Pac-Man's original name was indeed puck man, but they realized most kids

515
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,200
would probably change the P to an F. Yeah.

516
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,200
I'm sure many of you have heard that before.

517
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,200
I know we all saw Scott Pilgrim too.

518
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Yeah.

519
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
So the whole man.

520
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,200
Right.

521
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,200
Um, but, uh, yeah, it's kind of interesting how that did change.

522
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:49,200
So it is a little different here, uh, in the States than it is in Japan.

523
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,200
Um, but of course in Japan, I would say space invaders was more that arcade game that really,

524
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
really broke through.

525
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,200
Not to say it wasn't a big deal here.

526
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,200
It was, but I feel like Pac-Man was everywhere here.

527
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,200
Space invaders was everywhere there.

528
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,200
So anyway, I don't know.

529
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Cause I get, not to say like the other wasn't there at all, but I just feel like, you know,

530
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,200
we had the, we had the cartoon, we had the board game, we had like all this stuff with Pac-Man.

531
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
I'm not even sure they really had in Japan.

532
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
Whereas like space invaders was so fricking popular.

533
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,200
It was everywhere.

534
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,200
W weren't they like running low on coins because they were going into space invaders machine.

535
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,200
It was just kind of like a different, like cultural thing.

536
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
I think.

537
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:36,200
I want to say it was, uh, yeah, they had to admit like more, um, more yen, I think more

538
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
yen coins because of that.

539
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,200
But I want to say, I don't know if it was space invaders.

540
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
It might've been space invaders that did it.

541
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,200
I'd have to look up my trivia again.

542
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,200
Yeah.

543
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,200
All right.

544
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
Well anyway, let's get into a little more current gaming.

545
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,200
Happy birthday Pac-Man.

546
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,200
But, uh, let's talk about some more current video games that we have been playing as we

547
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,200
talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this

548
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,200
week.

549
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
So, uh, dark soccer, we'll start with you.

550
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
How was your gaming week?

551
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,200
Um, it was mostly animal crossing all up until a certain thing arrived on our doorstep on

552
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
yesterday.

553
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
And what's that?

554
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,200
A turbo graphics 16 mini.

555
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,200
So yeah, uh, everybody started getting those this weekend.

556
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,200
Mine came in on Friday, uh, and then yours came in Saturday.

557
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,200
Right.

558
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,200
And then I know Bobby Black Wolf got his, one of those days too, because he was doing

559
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,200
a stream.

560
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,200
So I feel like a lot of those who like pre-ordered that started getting them this weekend.

561
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,200
So the shipping date kind of changed a little bit on that, but that's good.

562
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Yeah.

563
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,200
Needless to say, Dan has been playing the super graphics version of, uh, uh, ghosts

564
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
and goblins.

565
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,200
Like I woke up and he was still playing it and he actually did the full cycle of it with

566
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,200
a little assistance, but he was, he was working up a storm playing it.

567
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:54,200
Um, anyway, though, uh, we also did get in a little bit of, uh, East just to listen to

568
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,200
the music, you know, cause the intro to East was so beautiful.

569
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,200
Um, and then, um, and it's not wise, it's East.

570
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,200
Anyway.

571
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,200
Um, we, yeah, no.

572
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,200
Um, uh, yeah, she says, Dan, ghosts and goblins.

573
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,200
No.

574
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
Anyway.

575
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:23,200
Um, we also, um, got a little bit in of Lords of Thunder and, um, trying to think what else

576
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,200
cause, uh, Oh, um, Star Parodia, which makes me ridiculously happy that that game was on

577
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,200
there.

578
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,200
Cause I freaking love Star Parodia.

579
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
Um, Star Soldier is on there too.

580
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,200
Um, trying to think what else we touched on.

581
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Um, I was going to ask because, you know, I, I didn't really ever import games until

582
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:47,200
I discovered Dance Dance Revolution and met you guys and, you know, kind of got like introduced

583
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,200
to like, Oh yes, you can buy games from Japan over here.

584
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,200
It's just very expensive and all this, but you were the one that really introduced me

585
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,200
to, cause you know, the turbo graphics, it was out here, but obviously it was the PC

586
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,200
engine in Japan and you know, it's just very different.

587
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
Like they had all this different stuff and different games and all that.

588
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
And I got introduced to what?

589
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,200
There's a whole Castlevania game that never came out here.

590
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,200
That's, that's, that's on, you know, that was all because of you.

591
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,200
Yeah.

592
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,200
So I found out about a lot of these games because of our friendship.

593
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,200
And so I know you've been a turbo, you know, fan for years.

594
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Is there anything on this device that you didn't own before that it's like, woo, who

595
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,200
I get to play this finally.

596
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,200
Yeah.

597
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,200
There's some things that we didn't own a couple of times because we actually, they would have

598
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
been too language intensive.

599
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,200
Some definitely prohibit prohibitively expensive.

600
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:46,200
We have, I'm not going to say my source, but like Sapphire, I mean, there you go right

601
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
there.

602
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:53,200
There was some of the arcade card games.

603
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:59,200
You know, we can't play, although we own them, but we, and then getting a super graphics

604
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,200
that damn near, Oh my gosh, it would have been way expensive, expensive to have that.

605
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,200
That's what, um, that's what, uh, ghouls and ghosts was on.

606
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
It's, it's a beautiful one.

607
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,200
Music's a little bit off and timing is kind of weird on the machine.

608
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,200
Um, and I remember what else we said we played was, uh, twin B, but it was more like a kind

609
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:24,200
of a weak little version of twin B. Um, but if you go to salamander and you tap on it

610
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,200
three times, it'll do twin B for you.

611
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,200
Um, which of course salamander, I mean, there's another fantastic game that we don't have

612
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,200
on a turbo.

613
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:39,200
Um, trying to think there was Keith courage, which we've got that everyone has that.

614
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,200
That was a packing game in the U S when it was, um, but blazing lasers by itself is just

615
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,200
an amazing game.

616
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,200
Well, so, so as somebody who's followed, you know, turbo PC engine, all this for, for so

617
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,200
long, um, how, how do you like the device?

618
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,200
Like, is it, is it worthy?

619
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
Oh yeah, it's great.

620
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,200
It's really good for people who, I mean, cause trying to get your hands on a turbo graphics

621
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,200
now, isn't super easy.

622
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,200
Getting your hands on the duo is even harder.

623
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,200
And then, um, just trying to think what else would be super graphics, like I said, would

624
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,200
be damn near impossible.

625
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
It only came out in Japan.

626
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:22,200
Um, I do have a friend who has a duo LT, the PC engine duo LT it's like the laptop version

627
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,200
of it.

628
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,200
Um, the same friend also left one of his in a movie theater.

629
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,200
And we, we all know who this person is.

630
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
I'm not going to say his name online.

631
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,200
I'll tell you afterwards, but we all know him.

632
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,200
Okay.

633
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:43,200
Um, at any rate, um, PC engines, actually, I think that like a PC engine core is actually

634
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,200
a little easier to get your hands on than a, uh, a turbo graphics.

635
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:54,200
Um, one of the things though, is that what really goes for bucks, depending on, you know,

636
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,200
which one you've got are going to be those conversion cartridges.

637
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Um, like everyone wants the purple one.

638
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,200
The purple one has the best, uh, well, the best support for multiple games.

639
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:10,200
Um, and it was the converter to have, if you wanted to say, if you only had a U S turbo

640
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:17,200
duo, but you had, um, super CD games, like, uh, for, for instance, uh, we have, uh, fatal

641
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:23,200
fury and we have a Strider, uh, but they are super CD only and require the arcade card

642
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,200
to play the turbo duo in the U S had built into it.

643
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:34,200
The first two arcade cards, but you needed the, the, uh, not, not arcade cards, but just

644
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,200
the two, uh, extra cards that came with them.

645
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,200
And the final one was the arcade card that you need for your super CD games.

646
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:46,200
Um, so of course we can play all bunch of Japanese games on our, on our, uh, U S duo,

647
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,200
but we couldn't play our super CD games.

648
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,200
So arcade cards still go for bucks.

649
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:58,200
Um, there's also, there was that PC engine emulator, but you have to magic engine, but

650
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,200
you have to pay for it.

651
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:06,200
Um, I'm going way off topic, but just to say that the, the turbo graphics stuff is gonna

652
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
be a little bit harder to find.

653
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:15,200
I will tell people though, you can probably get a duo RX, which is one of the re-released

654
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,200
PC engine duos as a, as a whole set.

655
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,200
Um, about 200 to 250.

656
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:28,200
So not, not too prohibitive, but this is a, this is a like pretty cost effective way to

657
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,200
get your foot in the door with turbo graphics because like I remember like my friend had

658
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,200
one growing up, so I remember playing it at his house.

659
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,200
I never had one, but there's so many of these games I feel like I missed out on.

660
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,200
So like, I feel like me owning this is kind of part to catch up on like this little tiny

661
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,200
little era of gaming that I just like missed completely.

662
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
And so that's why I was worth it.

663
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,200
Yeah.

664
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,200
So like for the a hundred bucks, as opposed to all these collectors and things.

665
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
Yeah.

666
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,200
I feel like it's a, it's a steal.

667
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,200
What are they going to do when they hack them?

668
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,200
Uh, yeah, that's a very interesting question, right?

669
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,200
Cause obviously like the, the idiot question that's about to fall out of my mouth is you

670
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,200
think they're going to hack them?

671
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,200
That's an idiot question.

672
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,200
I know I'm saying it's an idiot question.

673
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,200
Of course the hackers going to hack, right?

674
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,200
So it's just a matter of time.

675
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,200
You're right.

676
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,200
I don't, I don't know.

677
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,200
I don't know what I'll do when they hack them.

678
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:23,200
I guess one of, one of our most quoted games, misquoted games, a psychic storm where whenever

679
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,200
they power up, they say psychic storm, but it used to sound like I get pissed off.

680
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:34,200
And so we would just say that anytime we power up, I get pissed off, but it's got Sapphire.

681
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,200
I mean, having Sapphire on there is reason enough.

682
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:43,200
That game is like, you know, I'm going to look and look it up and see how much it is

683
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,200
while y'all chat about it.

684
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,200
Cause Sapphire ain't cheap.

685
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,200
Well, I think I've covered it for classic game.

686
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,200
I was just saying, I don't know if there's a lot left cause Loki, you, you didn't buy

687
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,200
one of these yet, right?

688
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
No, no.

689
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,200
And I did buy one, but I haven't played it yet.

690
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,200
And I'll talk about why, but it's like on my list of things to do tomorrow with tomorrow

691
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,200
being a holiday where we can't really go out and have a barbecue or anything.

692
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,200
It's on my list of things to do tomorrow.

693
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,200
So, um, Oh, go ahead.

694
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,200
Crazy.

695
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,200
Um, one seller on, on eBay has it for $94.

696
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,200
Another one has it for 1500.

697
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
Oh my God.

698
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,200
Another one, 1530.

699
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,200
Um, wow.

700
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,200
No, no, no.

701
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,200
Okay.

702
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,200
That's a 500 and one everdrive.

703
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,200
We've got an everdrive.

704
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,200
The arcade card.

705
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:33,200
Like I was talking about, Rob, play Asia Silvers for 400 bucks.

706
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,200
Wow.

707
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,200
No, thank you.

708
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:42,200
That's the arcade card pro the arcade card duo is 110 and just this one copy of Sapphire

709
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,200
out of the box is going for 1200.

710
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,200
It is ridiculous.

711
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,200
Let me, um, get this question in chat here or comment.

712
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,200
Phoenix 77 26 says, I wonder if the same sort of thing will happen with Xbox three sixties

713
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,200
in 20 years.

714
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
You know, that's a great question.

715
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,200
It's very easy to kind of say like, Oh yeah, there'll probably be many Xbox three sixties

716
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,200
and so forth.

717
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:08,200
But, and especially with that particular device, you see more and more of an inch towards these

718
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,200
subscription platforms, right?

719
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,200
Where you're going to pay a subscription fee and you know, Xbox game pass, right?

720
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,200
And you get a lot of the games through that.

721
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,200
Heck, even Nintendo is doing something like that now.

722
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,200
I mean, yes, they released the Nintendo mini and the super Nintendo mini, but they have

723
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,200
their subscription Nintendo online.

724
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,200
You get those libraries as well.

725
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:34,200
So it, I almost wonder if, uh, you're going to see more of the contemporary games, uh,

726
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,200
end up being on these subscription services.

727
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,200
I don't know.

728
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,200
Like, I don't know if there would end up being a market for something like an Xbox 360 mini,

729
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,200
but we're, we're, we've gotten about as far as the PlayStation, cause there was a PlayStation

730
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,200
mini for better or for worse, but it existed.

731
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
Right.

732
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
So, um, I, it's hard to say.

733
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,200
I agree with pod culture.

734
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,200
I want to Dreamcast mini.

735
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,200
Heck yes to that.

736
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,200
I'd be all about that.

737
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,200
I can totally see them double dipping though, because I mean, they did that already with

738
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,200
the Nintendo online with super Nintendo games and stuff.

739
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:07,200
I believe that's pretty much all the games that were on those two standalone mini devices.

740
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,200
There are some slight differences with third parties, but for the, but yes, for the most

741
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,200
part.

742
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,200
Well, to also piggyback on what SSJ 100 Matt says, he says, I kind of want a Saturn mini

743
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,200
as well.

744
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,200
I would want a Saturn if it had a lot more of the games that came out in Japan on it.

745
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:29,200
Like the great fighting games, like the, the X-Men versus, and you know, all of those

746
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:35,200
series, they were so good or, or their KOF games, the KOF games on Saturn were top notch.

747
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,200
There is no pain like playing a KOF game on Neo Geo CD.

748
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,200
It has loading time out in the ass.

749
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:49,200
I want to say that is one thing I do want to give massive kudos to Konami and you know,

750
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,200
the turbo look at me, I'm giving kudos to Konami on this show, but it's where it's deserved

751
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,200
because I think this device is well done.

752
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:01,200
And I think where the kudos is really deserved is the fact that, you know, it's very agnostic

753
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,200
on the regions.

754
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:09,200
You can flip to Japanese and you can play Japanese games, including things like snatcher,

755
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,200
which you're really not going to be able to play without an, unless you understand Japanese

756
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,200
without an FAQ or a walkthrough or something.

757
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,200
But I love that that option is there.

758
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,200
It does have different games though than in Japan.

759
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,200
The PC engine version.

760
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,200
True.

761
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,200
But the, but the fact that like the Japanese games are still even there in the American

762
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,200
release is pretty awesome.

763
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,200
I love that.

764
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,200
I would, I would really like a PC engine mini.

765
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:39,200
Just, um, I mean, and that's the reason why I wasn't all hyper about getting one is because

766
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:45,200
I'm not super hyper on, um, uh, Tokimeki Memorial.

767
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,200
And I know that that's one of the games and although Tokimeki had another hidden game

768
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,200
that you could access.

769
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,200
But man, snatcher.

770
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,200
Oh my gosh.

771
00:38:53,200 --> 00:39:00,200
And you know, though, when they start doing the hacks and stuff on it, the, the, um, the

772
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:05,200
ROM hack snatcher is going to be out because there's a full translation of snatcher out

773
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,200
there.

774
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,200
Yeah, that's true.

775
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,200
It's probably because I was, I was going to say like, it is my, my one, if I wanted to

776
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,200
be that gamer that asked for everything, which most gamers do, I would say like, Hey man,

777
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,200
why didn't they just go back and translate snatcher as if there's infinite amount of

778
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,200
resources.

779
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,200
So I'm, I'm setting my expectations reasonably and I'm recognizing that, Hey, it's cool that

780
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,200
we got even what we got.

781
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,200
Um, and, but you're right.

782
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,200
ROM hackers have already kind of taken care of that.

783
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,200
Now, obviously Konami can't release that in any official capacity.

784
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,200
Uh, I guess they could, but it would get into dicey territory.

785
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,200
Um, so, but you're right.

786
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,200
Hackers will have to take care of that.

787
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,200
So it'll be, it'll be interesting.

788
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,200
You're right.

789
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,200
So, um,

790
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,200
But anyway, we've had, and I'll, I'll go over something else too.

791
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:53,200
It does have some differences from the PC engine release because the controllers and

792
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,200
PC engine, it didn't have this turbo buttons on it.

793
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:02,200
Um, the, uh, us one does because the turbo graphics came out with them on it and it does

794
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,200
have two, uh, two ports, even though it only comes with one controller.

795
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,200
So no turbo tap is needed unless y'all is going to play some bomber man.

796
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,200
I don't know if you've played around with this mode, Jamie, but Bobby Blackwolf and

797
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:17,200
Chad is asking, so how long will you play games in the last display setting of the turbo

798
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,200
engine handheld?

799
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,200
Is that super duper hard modes?

800
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,200
I don't know if you've gone into the display settings, but the last one in there is like

801
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,200
playing it on a turbo.

802
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,200
It's, it's, it's really nauseating to look at.

803
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,200
I freaking have a turbo express.

804
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,200
You can get your headaches there.

805
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,200
Oh, Dan said something from the other room, but I couldn't hear what he said.

806
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,200
All right.

807
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,200
All right.

808
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,200
Well, uh, anything else with your gaming week, dark soccer before we move on to Loki?

809
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,200
Um, nah.

810
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,200
All right.

811
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,200
So Loki, how was your gaming week?

812
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,200
And I'm going to change this camera thing on the fly.

813
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,200
Sorry guys.

814
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,200
It's a new, new stuff tonight, but I'm going to make my co-host a little bigger while Loki

815
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,200
talks about his gaming week.

816
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,200
All right.

817
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:03,200
So, um, this week I mainly played, uh, Orna, so I'm up to 175 now.

818
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,200
Um, so that was kind of cool.

819
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,200
And they have this brand new thing that they added in, which is a raid bosses or, well,

820
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:16,200
raid bosses are new, but basically spawnable raid bosses that are appearing for anybody

821
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,200
that's in the area.

822
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,200
So I had one that unfortunately no one helped to kill.

823
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,200
So it took me like a few days to do that, but it gives you a lot of experience, which

824
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
is kind of cool.

825
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,200
Um, I just did the same thing.

826
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
So there's one right by me right now.

827
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,200
And that thing kicks my ass.

828
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,200
I don't know.

829
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,200
It's going to take me like a month to kill it.

830
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,200
Yeah.

831
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,200
Yeah.

832
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,200
So I've still got two more scrolls to the spawn.

833
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,200
I'm like, I don't want to spawn another one cause it's just, it's such a hassle.

834
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,200
Like I don't want to do it, but I probably will.

835
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,200
When it gets a little easier to hang out in groups.

836
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,200
I mean, I guess to some extent you can still like social distance at a park and things

837
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,200
like that.

838
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,200
It just kind of depends on what you're comfortable with and you know how your body is with, with

839
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,200
uh, uh, being susceptible and all that.

840
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,200
But um, an idea had come up to, we could all kind of agree to meet at the same park and

841
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,200
spawn all the bosses and then take them down as a group.

842
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,200
So that might be a way to do it.

843
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:18,200
So yeah, I mean obviously it'll kind of depend on this whole situation and when that's really

844
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,200
safe to do and all that.

845
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,200
Yeah, we can see.

846
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:26,200
Um, so I did that and then the other thing I did was I restarted the realm that I have.

847
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:32,200
So my kids had already beaten the Ender Dragon and everything in Minecraft and the Wither

848
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,200
Dragon and all that stuff.

849
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,200
And so I decided that I wanted to go ahead and restart the whole thing from scratch because

850
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,200
we kind of cheated our way through it a little bit.

851
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:45,200
Um, so now we're playing it legit and um, so we just did that.

852
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,200
But I do have an add on that I added in there.

853
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:55,200
So because the snow golems are kind of garbage, so I replaced them with a turret minigun because

854
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,200
that's fun.

855
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,200
Um, so that was one of the things you can do with Bedrock Minecraft is you can actually

856
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,200
edit it with some of the add ons and those persist to the other players across other

857
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,200
platforms.

858
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,200
Like my, my other son plays on the switch and so he can actually use as well.

859
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:16,200
You're kind of limited what you can do in realms with those add ons because they limit

860
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:21,200
like for example, I wanted to make new crafting recipes to be able to craft some of the things

861
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,200
that you can't craft in the game right now.

862
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:29,200
Um, they can only get from chests and stuff and it won't let me do that without enabling

863
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:36,200
experimental gameplay and you can't have experimental gameplay on realms right now

864
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,200
because I think some systems don't support it.

865
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:44,200
So I, um, didn't do that.

866
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,200
Uh, at least that's my understanding at least.

867
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,200
So I just didn't bother to do that.

868
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,200
But we, we started out and it's pretty cool.

869
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,200
We got this, I built this giant mansion, stayed up pretty late last night doing that.

870
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:59,200
Um, and uh, yeah, they finally went to another today, but it's been fun.

871
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,200
Kids are having a good time.

872
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,200
Good.

873
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,200
All right.

874
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,200
Um, is that it for your gaming week?

875
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,200
Uh, yeah, I think that's it.

876
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,200
Yeah.

877
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,200
I haven't, haven't played anything else.

878
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,200
All right.

879
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,200
Then I'll talk about my gaming week.

880
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:19,200
So, uh, for my gaming week, uh, was, um, a lot of the same old stuff still playing Final

881
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:25,200
Fantasy 14 with friends and, uh, getting ready for a fantasy star on line two on PC.

882
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,200
I'm really excited to play that on PC so I can kind of do that on my, you know, I just

883
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,200
like playing with keyboard and mouse and all that.

884
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,200
So, uh, really excited to go through that again, although I don't know, PSO might be

885
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,200
better with controller, but I can still do that on the PC and you know, then discord

886
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,200
will be right there and I'm in my zone.

887
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,200
I'm in my setup.

888
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,200
I think it'll be really, really good to have.

889
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,200
So that's coming up this coming week.

890
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:50,200
Um, I did not get around to playing the turbo graphics, uh, mini because, so y'all remember

891
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,200
last summer I was talking about the survivor LARP and I've talked about it a couple of

892
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,200
times since then.

893
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:59,200
I'm not playing again, but I'm helping to host, uh, this current version that they're

894
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,200
doing right now.

895
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,200
They're on like their 11th season.

896
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,200
So the one I won was the ninth, they're on their 11th season and I'm helping to host

897
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,200
it.

898
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,200
And so this weekend they did a challenge that I designed.

899
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,200
And so it was the like first challenge that I designed for the game and they did it.

900
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,200
And, uh, if you want like a little peek at what it looked like now that I have this fancy

901
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,200
little safari button, I can hit that.

902
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,200
So like they had to do these little puzzles that they put together and it may look pretty

903
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,200
easy.

904
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,200
Um, but it's, you know, it took them a little time.

905
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,200
I would say, uh, there's, there's a few of these.

906
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,200
This isn't the old one.

907
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,200
So it leads them to these different like URLs and things like that.

908
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:38,200
And, um, there's like four of them all together and it took them about like 35, 40 minutes.

909
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,200
So my point is I'm a game designer now.

910
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,200
So how about that Loki?

911
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,200
I had people play my game.

912
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:50,200
Rob, you get the pizza.

913
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,200
Congrats.

914
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,200
It's a little different.

915
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:57,200
It's kind of, it's, it's almost the equivalent of when you would draw the RPG on graph paper.

916
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,200
How many of you guys did this on your lunch break in elementary school?

917
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,200
You drew the RPG on graph paper and like all that stuff.

918
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,200
It's kind of the equivalent of that, but Hey, a game is a game.

919
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,200
I'll take it.

920
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,200
And it seemed to be well received.

921
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,200
So I was happy with that.

922
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,200
So that's why I didn't get around to the turbo graphics.

923
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,200
Cause that I was cramming and finishing last night and then they all played it this morning.

924
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,200
So I was very busy watching all that.

925
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,200
Um, I did get to play a little bit of Pokemon go community day.

926
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,200
Um, I caught seven shinies without really trying.

927
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,200
Alan and I just went to the local park.

928
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:33,200
You know, there was not, there was a couple other people walking around, but it wasn't like, it wasn't, it didn't look like the fricking like boardwalk on the, what was that ocean city or whatever.

929
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,200
No, no, the park was very low key.

930
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,200
So we were there, walked around.

931
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,200
I just used my little Poke ball to catch while walking.

932
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,200
And I was playing a little ingress as well.

933
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,200
Uh, and I caught seven shinies without really trying.

934
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,200
So that felt really good.

935
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,200
Um, so yeah, Pokemon go.

936
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,200
That was fine.

937
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,200
I wish it was a better Pokemon, but I guess they're pretty, it's, it's nice to have at least the three.

938
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,200
And I guess it is pretty good for PVP.

939
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,200
I hear.

940
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,200
Um, and I caught a couple that were three stars.

941
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,200
So that's, that's nice.

942
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,200
That's good.

943
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:08,200
Um, and then, uh, yeah, otherwise like with between Orna and other stuff, that's, that's pretty much how my gaming week went.

944
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:14,200
So, uh, again, looking forward to next week cause there's some, uh, new releases I'm looking forward to trying like a PSL.

945
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,200
So, yep.

946
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,200
All right.

947
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,200
So, uh, with that, let's move on to some gaming news.

948
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,200
Uh, real quick though, a little bit of housekeeping.

949
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,200
Um, I do want to mention a couple of things here.

950
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,200
Um, number one, uh, I mentioned this last week, but, uh, I'll mention it again tonight.

951
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:37,200
The Southern Fried Game Room Expo, uh, which is, uh, it's out in the Atlanta area.

952
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:44,200
And so we don't usually get to attend, um, because I usually go to Atlanta for DragonCon, but they had to cancel, uh, this year.

953
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:53,200
Or they did cancel obviously with everything going on in the world, except they didn't do for, you know, you know, George is kind of taking the situation a little differently right now.

954
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,200
And so they didn't have force majeure when they canceled.

955
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,200
So they are taking a little bit of a financial hit on this whole thing.

956
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:06,200
Um, so if you want to show Southern Fried Game Expo, a little Game Room Expo, a little love, I would encourage you to go visit their website.

957
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,200
They have some merchandise there, which Loki, you actually bought a shirt, didn't you?

958
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,200
Yes, I did.

959
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,200
Yeah. So you actually bought a shirt on there.

960
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,200
The shirts are pretty bad ass with the power glove and everything.

961
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,200
So it did, it did look really cool.

962
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,200
And that's just to help make sure it'll happen next year.

963
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:26,200
Yeah. The one, the one I looked at was the, uh, the black and, um, yellowish green one.

964
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:31,200
But then I was like, eh, maybe I should get blue and pink. I don't know, but that's what I ended up getting.

965
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:38,200
Yeah. Um, and then, uh, in other, one other housekeeping thing I wanted to mention, we just talked about this on Bobby's show.

966
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:44,200
So those that are listening live are going to hear this twice. Sorry, but I just wanted it for the benefit of the podcast listeners and, and just put a little love out there.

967
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:50,200
Um, we did announce earlier today that, um, girls gone wow has, uh, left the voice of geeks network.

968
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:58,200
Um, as they are signing up with Warcraft radio, which is a relaunching, I think it's a, an older radio network that's kind of coming back because of Twitch.

969
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:07,200
And so they are going to be, um, streaming and broadcasting with other Warcraft podcasters and, you know, and, and it's absolutely no hard feelings.

970
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,200
Love those girls over there.

971
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:15,200
Uh, no, I shouldn't say girl. I know there's shows called girls gone wild, but they're women. I love those women, uh, over at girls gone wow.

972
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:25,200
And, uh, thank you for, uh, many, many years here at the voice geeks network and really, really wishing you guys nothing but the best, uh, in the future and hoping that I'm getting together with all the other Warcraft folks.

973
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:31,200
Uh, means great things when it comes to like BlizzCon and getting to interview people at Blizzard and all that good stuff.

974
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:38,200
So, um, yeah, so, um, we're, we're, we're all still friends just, you know, on different networks now. So that's, it's all good.

975
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:43,200
I just want to wish them the best and thank them for the years that they spent on the voice geeks network.

976
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:51,200
So, uh, on a somewhat related note, I suppose, uh, the voice geeks network is looking for more podcasts and broadcasts.

977
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:57,200
Um, I know a lot of people might be using this whole quarantine and weird world times to be getting into that sort of hobby.

978
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:07,200
Um, so if you have like a geeky related show and it can even be about gaming, uh, or, or what have you, we are looking to recruit more dedicated people for the network.

979
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:16,200
Um, so reach out, uh, we're very easy to find on Twitter. Uh, I'm at mr Rob Roberts, or of course you can always email me rob at vog network.com.

980
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:20,200
That's VOG network.com, uh, or look at the website. We're very easy to find there.

981
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:30,200
Um, definitely looking to recruit some more shows because, um, obviously girls got, wow, I just talked about with them, but we have a lot of other shows that have just pod faded, um, over the past couple of years.

982
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:35,200
We have a lot of shows that just for various reasons, they're just not recording anymore. These things happen.

983
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:40,200
Um, believe it or not shows going over 10 years doesn't happen a lot.

984
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:50,200
So, uh, we've, we've been very fortunate, uh, to still have, you know, Bobby and British invaders. I know pod culture is still, uh, taping here and there and may jam session us.

985
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:56,200
So we do still have a few shows that have been going a very long time, but unfortunately some of the other shows I have pod faded for various reasons.

986
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:04,200
So, uh, if you're interested, uh, please don't hesitate to reach out. All right, let's get into some gaming news. Uh, Loki, we'll start with you.

987
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:15,200
Yeah, so this is kind of funny. Um, so we've talked about G2A for awhile. They're the kind of gray market seller of, uh, steam keys and I think other keys as well.

988
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:33,200
So they've always been adamant that they don't sell stolen keys on their site and they are so confident that that was the case that they even offered up that, Hey, if you're an independent developer and you find proof that our keys or the keys that we're selling for your games are stolen,

989
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:48,200
we will refund you, uh, 10 times the amount of those purchases. Well, that leads us to their, uh, blog posts that they put up called keeping our promise.

990
00:51:48,200 --> 00:52:04,200
Uh, basically saying that they found that a 321 keys of, uh, I believe it was, uh, what was that? Factorio. And they found that those were sold, um, illegitimately as well.

991
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:21,200
So they're now paying, um, them $39,600, uh, which is 10 times the value of any bank initiated refund costs that Factorio paid in relation to each of the 198 illegitimate keys sold via its marketplace.

992
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:36,200
Um, so it's kind of funny because that basically catches them saying, no, we don't sell those keys except that we do sell illegal keys. And of course they're trying to spin it as basically saying that, Oh, well we were duped.

993
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:50,200
Um, you know, basically saying that what we lost launched this offer. We wanted to send a clear message to the gaming community that fraud hurts all parties. As we spell out in this blog, fraud directly hurts individuals who buy illegitimate keys.

994
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:59,200
It hurts game developers and it ultimately hurts G2A because we are forced as a transaction facilitator to cover the costs related to the sale.

995
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:18,200
Except I think they're well aware of what goes on on their site. And this is probably just a small price for them to pay to do their business. And they probably make way more money from this, but it's just basically them admitting to what everybody's been saying that they've done for a long time. And that's kind of funny.

996
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,200
They're only sorry they got caught.

997
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:28,200
I feel like, yeah, I feel like that whole congrats you played yourself meme is very appropriate here. Uh, if, if nothing else.

998
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,200
Right. Yeah. Pretty much.

999
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:39,200
So how is this company kind of still in business even though they got caught? I mean, I know they're, they're kind of talking their way out of it and I don't know.

1000
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:52,200
There's that part of me that wants to go, maybe they're not all bad after all. Maybe there is some lit, but it's, it's just hard when time and time again you see them kind of tripping and falling down the stairs. You know what I mean?

1001
00:53:53,200 --> 00:54:01,200
Yeah. It's just, I don't know. It's ridiculous. So just don't buy through G2A.

1002
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:06,200
I mean, even some of the developers have come out and said, Hey, we'd rather you pirate our game to buy through G2A.

1003
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:24,200
So, I mean, that, that's, that's saying a lot because really when you think about it, because if you're buying these keys and then there's, you know, someone's doing a, uh, you know, credit card reversal on them and the developers actually losing money aside from getting no money whatsoever.

1004
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,200
They're losing additional money.

1005
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:36,200
No, I totally get it. When somebody pirates the game, which I don't endorse piracy on the show, but when somebody pirates the game, uh, they're getting, uh, they're, they're getting something stolen from them.

1006
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:49,200
When somebody buys from one of these shady key seller recites, they're getting something stolen from them and someone else is getting money. It's like, it's double bad. It makes a really bad thing even worse, but yeah.

1007
00:54:50,200 --> 00:55:00,200
All right. Uh, well, let's move on to things that should be a little bit happier news and talk a little bit about the Olympics. Um, so the Olympics in 2020, of course they've been postponed.

1008
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:09,200
They're not going to be happening this year that, or I should say the 2020 Olympics will be happening in 2021. We all know it's crazy times right now and things are going to be happening a little bit differently, but, um,

1009
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,200
We'll see about that.

1010
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:23,200
Well, yeah, yeah. Who knows if this thing keeps going to 2021, who knows? But anyway, as of now, that's how things are, but for 2020 this year, uh, there's going to be a team up happening for a special virtual event.

1011
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:39,200
So Xbox and special Olympics are going to be teaming up for a virtual event. Um, now of course, a lot of, we always kind of talk about the Olympics, the Olympics, but of course the special Olympics also happen in the same host city in the same year.

1012
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:57,200
Uh, that the Olympics do. So Tokyo was also going to be hosting the special Olympics. Uh, but obviously that has all shifted as well to 2021. So anyhow, um, Forza Motorsport 7, which of course is Microsoft title is going to be getting a special event on May 30th

1013
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:11,200
for, from 35 athletes representing 11 countries, uh, for some competition. And this is also interesting. They're going to do the award ceremony in Minecraft, which is another Microsoft product at this point.

1014
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:23,200
So it is, it's kind of interesting how, um, you know, that that's all coming together, which, you know, we've heard Minecraft be used for a lot of virtual things, but I don't think we've ever put the name the Olympics behind it.

1015
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:30,200
And that's, I think there's a lot of people out there that have been wondering, are video games ever going to become an Olympic sport? Well, that's not what's happening here.

1016
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:44,200
But the fact that, and it's not the first time the Olympics has had an event around video games either, but the fact that it's going to be happening and it's one of the only 2020 Olympic events that's going to happen in 2020, I think is what kind of makes this notable

1017
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:59,200
because video games have also been bridging the gap of, you know, missing sports right now, right? We've talked plenty on previous episodes about these virtual events for charity or the simulators being used in racing events and so forth.

1018
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:08,200
So, um, pretty cool. Uh, so anyway, uh, you can check out the live stream at three o'clock Eastern, or that would be noon. And again, that is on May 30th.

1019
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:21,200
So that's coming up in the next couple days. And, uh, the whole thing is also going to be, uh, you can get more information, how to volunteer with the Special Olympics, uh, and actually taking donations through the Microsoft rewards program.

1020
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:33,200
So if you're racking up rewards points from either like using Bing or using Game Pass, you get a lot of points to that too. If you've never looked like look at that Microsoft rewards app, because if you collect like a thousand points, which isn't that hard to do,

1021
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:45,200
that's like a dollar you can donate to Special Olympics. And then Microsoft actually matches that. So that's pretty cool. So you might have been wondering like, why the Special Olympics? Because this whole thing is to help raise money, bring attention.

1022
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:54,200
And so, uh, all that good stuff. And yeah, I think that sounds awesome. What do you guys think about this kind of team up event in lieu of an actual Olympics?

1023
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:58,200
It's neat, but like, I don't use Bing.

1024
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,200
No one uses Bing.

1025
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:09,200
No, a lot, a lot of people use Bing. Bing's good for one thing. Um, but yeah, I don't use it normally for, um, internet searches.

1026
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:13,200
Wait, wait, what's the thing it's good for?

1027
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:18,200
It is incredibly great from what I hear for searching for pornography.

1028
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:22,200
I was, I was hoping that would be the answer. Thank you.

1029
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:27,200
I'm not sure why, but that's apparently what it is.

1030
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:32,200
I legit didn't know. You know what else is great for searching for pornography? Pornhub.

1031
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:40,200
So I legit did not know that that Bing was like a thing that people search for porn on. That's interesting.

1032
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:48,200
Yeah, I don't know if they do like video searches or what the case may be, but I just don't touch Bing at all because it's Bing and it's garbage.

1033
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,200
No, thanks.

1034
00:58:51,200 --> 00:59:02,200
No. Yeah. If I'm going to use anything other than, uh, uh, I'd say a Google search, you know, as search engines go, it's probably going to be DuckDuckGo.

1035
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:08,200
Um, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I guess you can search for porn on Bing and Google won't track it.

1036
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:17,200
Well, what about an incognito window or, or is, is that all like tinfoil-y? It's a lie and Google's tracking you anyway.

1037
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:22,200
You can, it's supposed to be completely private.

1038
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:28,200
Hmm. Hmm. Anyway, bonds, double 06 says, why not go back to ask Jeeves?

1039
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:34,200
Oh God, fifth dream brought up hot bot. That was the thing to use for awhile.

1040
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:40,200
Jeeves. How big them titties?

1041
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:47,200
I can't believe people use search engines for that. It's just, it just seems like you'd see the same thing. All right, forget it. Forget it.

1042
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:52,200
We're not having this discussion on this show, although we just did. Let's move on.

1043
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:56,200
Dark soccer. Bring a little class and dignity to this show with your next article, please.

1044
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:00,200
Class? Are you, are you serious? I am a classy bitch.

1045
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:10,200
And again, I got to stress, I mean, you always look great, but you are, you are especially well lit tonight. Your face is beat for the gods.

1046
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:21,200
Can you see I have a ring light on and I am, I am not that, I actually, I have, I put on a bare minimum just because I didn't want to look like, you know, a corpse with as pale as I am.

1047
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,200
But I do have my ring light. I got it working.

1048
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:28,200
Your lighting, chef's kiss. It looks fantastic.

1049
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,200
And my crew behind me.

1050
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:45,200
Again, again, you, I want to stress, you always look good, but I know you have not always been the most like camera, you know, loving person, but like, you went all out tonight. You look great.

1051
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,200
No.

1052
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:50,200
If only your webcam wasn't a potato, but that's okay.

1053
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,200
Okay. My webcam.

1054
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,200
Okay.

1055
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,200
Baby steps. Baby steps.

1056
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,200
I got it on Wish out of desperation.

1057
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,200
I understand.

1058
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,200
Cause.

1059
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,200
I understand.

1060
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:02,200
I'm not ready to drop that 150 on the Logitech one I want yet. Not yet.

1061
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:07,200
A lot of people who use Bing buy on Wish out of desperation.

1062
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:19,200
No, some wishes had good cosplay stuff. And I had gotten, I bought the webcam when I was getting the stuff together for Eastern Dolores Park for sister stuff.

1063
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:26,200
I've got all this like feathery crap behind me that was going to be part of my, my look.

1064
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:32,200
Uh, and Bobby has a great point in chat saying, uh, webcams are hard to find right now.

1065
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:37,200
Anyway, with everyone working from home. Yeah. A lot of computer parts got crazy harder to find in this day and age.

1066
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:42,200
I can switch to my Mac. The only reason the stuff's in front of my Mac was just to have a little bit more background stuff.

1067
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,200
You're fine.

1068
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,200
You don't know it has a great cam on it.

1069
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,200
You don't owe anyone an explanation.

1070
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,200
But it's funny. I got it on Wish.

1071
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,200
All right.

1072
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,200
Hilarious.

1073
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,200
All right. Anyway, story.

1074
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,200
All right.

1075
01:01:56,200 --> 01:02:07,200
So, um, for peeps like us who have the Twitch primes, we're getting 20 SNK games for free.

1076
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:12,200
I think it's actually some of the same ones that were in that, uh, that humble bundle a while back.

1077
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:17,200
But, um, starting on May 26th, which for us is in two days.

1078
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,200
So that's going to be two years a day.

1079
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:26,200
Um, you get games like King of Fighters 2002, Samurai Shodown 2, um, just a bunch of others.

1080
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:33,200
So, um, the list, uh, some of them on the list is Blazing Star, which I fucking love Blazing Star.

1081
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,200
Oh my God.

1082
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:38,200
Um, Last Blade 2, Garo, Mark of the Wolves.

1083
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:42,200
Um, there's a Polestar again that was a prequel to Blazing Star.

1084
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:48,200
Sengoku 3, King of the Monsters, Metal Slug 2, King of Fighters 98 Ultimate Match Final Edition.

1085
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,200
Oh, those names.

1086
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:53,200
Those are going to be some good things to have on, uh, on that group.

1087
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:58,200
So I would definitely, if you've got the prime, get it, get it good.

1088
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:02,200
And, uh, if you have prime, drop that sub at VOG Network.

1089
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,200
I got to put a cheap plug in there somewhere, please.

1090
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,200
Do the thing.

1091
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,200
Appreciate those.

1092
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,200
Give us the subby subs.

1093
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,200
Appreciate those of you that do.

1094
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:13,200
But other, um, uh, loot that's going to be involved in Twitch Prime.

1095
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:19,200
Um, there's a few things right now, but there's going to be, um, some, uh, uh, giveaways like

1096
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,200
in game.

1097
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:24,200
Like there's one for like, I think a skin for, uh, Doom Eternal right now.

1098
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,200
There's just a few other things in there.

1099
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:32,200
So if you've got the, um, the Twitch Prime, then dig in and see what you can find.

1100
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,200
You might find a treat.

1101
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:38,200
Um, and, uh, I, I did, I do want to say, and you, you kind of mentioned this as like, you

1102
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,200
know, we've seen these SNK games other places before.

1103
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:46,200
I think Twitch actually gave some of these away before, because I know Fatal Fury Special.

1104
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:50,200
I know I picked that up in a Twitch giveaway at one point because that's my favorite Fatal

1105
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,200
Fury game is Fatal Fury Special.

1106
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:55,200
And it was, it was on Twitch Prime at some point because it's already on my computer

1107
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,200
and I didn't pay for it.

1108
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,200
It was free.

1109
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,200
So I guess it could have been a humble bundle, but I'm almost positive it was a Twitch giveaway.

1110
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:05,200
Um, but it is, you know, Hey, not everybody got it the first time.

1111
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,200
There's definitely some stuff here now that wasn't there before.

1112
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,200
So it's, it's cool that they're giving away a lot.

1113
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:14,200
Maybe I'll have to stream how much I suck at Blazing Star now.

1114
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,200
Why not?

1115
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,200
Good times.

1116
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,200
All right.

1117
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,200
I love, I love Samurai Shodown too.

1118
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:23,200
That's one that Dan and I actually have on Neo Geo.

1119
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,200
We imported it so it's Samurai Spirits too.

1120
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:31,200
But if you switch the language options in the game, um, if you put it to English, the blood turns wet.

1121
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,200
Oh, how funny.

1122
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:38,200
And back to Japanese, you know, so you actually have both language modes on each of those cartridges.

1123
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:42,200
And I'm wondering if, uh, these iterations of the game are going to do the same.

1124
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,200
Huh?

1125
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,200
I didn't know that.

1126
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,200
That's interesting.

1127
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,200
All right.

1128
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,200
Well, let's move on.

1129
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,200
Next story.

1130
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,200
Loki.

1131
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,200
Yeah.

1132
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:56,200
So, um, there's this project that's going on, uh, called Insignia that's looking to

1133
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:00,200
bring back Xbox Live for the original Xbox.

1134
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:03,200
Um, so you may think, well, wait a second.

1135
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,200
Don't they already have something like that?

1136
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,200
Um, where you can play online with the Xbox?

1137
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,200
Well, technically yes.

1138
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,200
With tunneling with system link.

1139
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,200
So they have that X links.

1140
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:19,200
But this is actually looking to enable Xbox Live using a third party.

1141
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:27,200
Um, I can only imagine that's going to cause some issues at some point when Microsoft catches notice of it.

1142
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:31,200
But apparently they have some proof of concept stuff that they're showing right now where

1143
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:37,200
they go and actually create an Xbox Live account, um, or at least go through all the screens

1144
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,200
to do so, um, using the service.

1145
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:46,200
And it's going to be neat if they actually get it going, um, to basically allow folks

1146
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:52,200
to be able to play those games before that, um, had Xbox Live multiplayer, but now they

1147
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,200
haven't been able to with system links.

1148
01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:01,200
I will be interested to see if it happens, but I'm more on the fence saying that it's

1149
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,200
probably going to get shut down before they ever get to that point.

1150
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:08,200
Um, apparently they're in Duda also without console modding as well.

1151
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:13,200
Apparently all you need to do is just actually dump your keys for your console using some

1152
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:17,200
soft mod process and then you're good to go.

1153
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:22,200
Um, and they're even looking to enable like the voice chat messaging and all that stuff.

1154
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:27,200
So, um, be interesting to see how that works out.

1155
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:32,200
Yeah, I'm not sure it's going to be long for, um, Microsoft not wanting to shut it down

1156
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,200
either.

1157
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,200
I mean, I don't know.

1158
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:39,200
There's a part of me that's like, but you know, to be able to preserve the functionality

1159
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,200
of the original console for historical type of reasons and so forth, it's something they

1160
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,200
ought to consider just backing off on.

1161
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,200
Like, is it really going to cut into their current business?

1162
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,200
I don't think so.

1163
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:53,200
But at the same time, Microsoft has made a very big deal about this whole, you know,

1164
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:58,200
oh, well it's going to play everything, you know, so even on Xbox Series X, you'll be

1165
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:03,200
able to play original Xbox games and you know, Xbox Live will work because it's using your

1166
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,200
Series X to do it.

1167
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:10,200
But, and this is an important but, uh, is a limited selection Xbox games.

1168
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,200
Not every Xbox game works.

1169
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:17,200
You know, you guys know we're big fans of Dance Dance Revolution and the music games

1170
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,200
that we all met playing.

1171
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,200
Those games to this day don't work.

1172
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:26,200
And I truly think, and I will die on this hill, dammit.

1173
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:31,200
I think DDR UltraMix 2 on the original Xbox is the best home version of DDR they ever

1174
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,200
made.

1175
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,200
And you can't play it on backwards compatibility right now.

1176
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:39,200
Now, it would be kind of, you know, it would be a little weird anyway because you couldn't

1177
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,200
exactly use a dance mat with it.

1178
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:48,200
But, I mean, if you can play DDR on the web right now, why can't I at least button button

1179
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,200
revolution?

1180
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:53,200
And if Xbox Series X, because it's going to take USB devices, because the Xbox One does,

1181
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:57,200
maybe there could be a way to bring dance pads back for those that really, really want

1182
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,200
to do it.

1183
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:05,200
They could just, I don't know if they could, maybe not even necessarily put out new dance

1184
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:09,200
pads, but like say, hey, if you've got one of those older ones, you can use that.

1185
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:15,200
And I mean, there's plenty of those floating around out there and use store, you know,

1186
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:19,200
use like thrift shops and whatnot.

1187
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:27,200
Hell, I was digging through the garage today and I have two brand new Xbox 360 dance mats.

1188
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,200
Oh, nice.

1189
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:31,200
I've never been used because I had my own.

1190
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:34,200
So I have never bothered to actually use those.

1191
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:38,200
I have a PlayStation 2 one that's never been used.

1192
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:45,200
So, yeah, I mean, I suppose they could, you know, support it.

1193
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:51,200
I mean, it's basically just like a, it's, it's such a niche thing that I understand

1194
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:54,200
why it's like, oh, we're just going to like come right out and support it.

1195
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:58,200
But it would be really cool if they could at least get it added to the backwards compatibility

1196
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,200
list so we can at least play it with buttons or not.

1197
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:04,200
And I'll tell you, the hardware modifiers will take care of the rest.

1198
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:08,200
Somebody will get a dance pad working through USB so you can play DDR with a dance pad.

1199
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:12,200
Again, it might not work where the game recognizes it as such and all of that,

1200
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,200
but it'll be close enough.

1201
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:17,200
Darn it to satisfy, you know, those of us that would like to do that.

1202
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,200
Right.

1203
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:22,200
I mean, there's plenty of things already that you can plug into your Xbox that emulate,

1204
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:25,200
you know, pushing in the buttons on the controller.

1205
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:29,200
So it makes sense that they would be able to do that pretty easy.

1206
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:36,200
See, and then not only do the original UltraMix games not work on later X, you know, past the original Xbox,

1207
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:41,200
but then Dance Dance Revolution Universe on the Xbox 360 doesn't work on the Xbox One or anything after that.

1208
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:48,200
So like those DDR games, but yet, yet, yet, do you know what game is playable on Xbox One

1209
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:52,200
that is backwards compatible that does show up?

1210
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,200
Is it Beaten Groovy?

1211
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,200
Beaten Groovy is backwards compatible.

1212
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:58,200
Give me a fucking break.

1213
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:04,200
Now, and we've talked about this before when we talk about Xbox emulation,

1214
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:11,200
because remember when they got a lot of shit because like Barbie's horse party or whatever was on the emulation list.

1215
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:15,200
And it's like, I don't think Microsoft went out of their way to make that one,

1216
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:20,200
but it's like when they get a certain engine working or they get a certain type of game working,

1217
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,200
then that one just gets brought in as well.

1218
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:29,200
And I would imagine for Konami, Beaten Groovy is probably just running through some type of PlayStation 1 emulator,

1219
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:32,200
just like Symphony of the Night.

1220
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:39,200
So when they got Symphony of the Night working, well, Beaten Groovy, hooray, it works too.

1221
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:44,200
So, which by the way is the most terrible thing Konami's ever done to music game fans.

1222
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:49,200
You know, I'm surprised that they don't try to put those out again because you have stuff like,

1223
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:54,200
God, there's like lots of different music games now that are coming out.

1224
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:59,200
They're just specifically using like keys and stuff like the DJ Maxx stuff.

1225
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:04,200
And I'm surprised that they don't try to put out like pop music or something.

1226
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:07,200
I know where the controller wouldn't be the best thing.

1227
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:10,200
But I mean, somebody is going to buy it.

1228
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:13,200
Do you know what I totally forgot to mention during my gaming week?

1229
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,200
I played DJ Maxx on PC.

1230
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,200
I can't remember the subtitle.

1231
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,200
It's fun to play on a keyboard.

1232
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:23,200
I think it's five. It's the one that was free this weekend.

1233
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,200
Yeah, it had a free weekend on Steam.

1234
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,200
So I checked it out.

1235
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,200
I don't want to double dip from the PlayStation 4 version,

1236
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,200
especially for the amount they're asking for it.

1237
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:36,200
But it does have a few songs, like the Porter Robinson song is new.

1238
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:41,200
And they have that song from Beat Saber, Pop Stars.

1239
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,200
Yeah.

1240
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,200
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

1241
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:49,200
That song that I will sing it all.

1242
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,200
Thank you.

1243
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:53,200
That song is in DJ Maxx as well.

1244
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,200
And so I was like, oh, this song again.

1245
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:59,200
So but I think doesn't that all come from like a League of Legends thing?

1246
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,200
I think it does.

1247
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,200
So I think that's why it shows up in like gaming stuff everywhere.

1248
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,200
But anyway.

1249
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,200
All right.

1250
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,200
So, yeah, I left that on my gaming week.

1251
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:10,200
But when music games got brought up, there you go.

1252
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,200
So anyway, we've deviated a bit from the Insignia project.

1253
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:17,200
So maybe Microsoft will shut it down, but maybe they won't.

1254
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,200
We'll see.

1255
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,200
I think that they will.

1256
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,200
Yeah.

1257
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:22,200
All right.

1258
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,200
But we'll see.

1259
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,200
All right.

1260
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,200
It won't be as fast as Nintendo.

1261
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,200
Nintendo would have shut that down yesterday.

1262
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,200
So there is that.

1263
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,200
All right.

1264
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,200
Let's talk about New Game Plus Expo.

1265
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:37,200
And one of the biggest companies involved with this is Sega.

1266
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,200
So what is it?

1267
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,200
It is going to be a new video game showcase.

1268
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:47,200
Obviously, this year with E3 not happening, you have a lot of people scurrying to do something else.

1269
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:50,200
Of course, a lot of that in a virtual environment.

1270
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:54,200
And we've heard that, you know, some of the publishers that would usually do these big press conferences,

1271
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:57,200
such as Microsoft and Ubisoft, they're planning their own thing.

1272
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,200
They're going to do their own type of press conference.

1273
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:02,200
Well, what about some of the smaller companies?

1274
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:05,200
It's weird to me to think of Sega as a smaller company.

1275
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:06,200
I don't think they are.

1276
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,200
But Sega never did a main stage show.

1277
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,200
You know what I mean?

1278
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:16,200
So what happens to these smaller groups that maybe would have booths at E3, but there is no E3 this year.

1279
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:19,200
So a lot of these guys have banded together for the New Game Plus Expo.

1280
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:23,200
It will be kicking off on the 23rd of June.

1281
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:26,200
That's the same day as our anniversary, I'll have you know.

1282
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,200
OLR started on June 23rd.

1283
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:31,200
So Tuesday, June 23rd is the day it will kick off.

1284
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:35,200
Fourteen publishers are going to be a part of this digital event.

1285
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:38,200
There will be publishers in North America and Japan.

1286
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:41,200
It will be an hour-long event on Twitch.

1287
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,200
That's a lot of publishers for one hour.

1288
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:47,200
8 a.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. in BST.

1289
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,200
Is that British Standard Time?

1290
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,200
I know that's over there.

1291
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:54,200
And then there will be first looks and Q&A sessions.

1292
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,200
Oh, so they're kind of doing the treehouse thing.

1293
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:00,200
They're doing like an hour-long presentation and then deeper dive after that.

1294
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,200
So who all is involved?

1295
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:05,200
Sega, Atlas West is part of that as well.

1296
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:14,200
Axis Games, Arc System Works, Inti Creates, Koei Tecmo, Natsume, Playism, WayForward, SNK, and more.

1297
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:17,200
I didn't even name them all, but there's lots of companies that are involved with that.

1298
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,200
So pretty cool.

1299
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:24,200
That's a pretty early hour to be up and watching, but I'll be working anyway.

1300
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:30,200
So maybe it'll be that thing where it's like I've got one monitor over here while I get my work done over here

1301
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,200
to see if anything kind of catches my eye.

1302
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,200
Sounds neat.

1303
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:40,200
I feel like if Kensha Hall got an expo, this would be the closest thing to that.

1304
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,200
That's how I feel.

1305
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:45,200
Anyway, moving on. DarkSakura.

1306
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:49,200
So how about some happy, feely good kind of news, right?

1307
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,200
We need it.

1308
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:58,200
Well, Guinness has recognized the oldest gaming YouTuber.

1309
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:04,200
This is a 90-year-old woman named Mori Hamako.

1310
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:09,200
She was born on February 18th, 1930.

1311
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:14,200
So that puts it into perspective right in the Depression.

1312
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:20,200
And she started playing video games about 39 years ago and became interested in it when she saw children playing with it.

1313
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:25,200
And she said that it looked so much fun that it wasn't fair that only children could play it.

1314
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:28,200
So she started playing when no one was watching.

1315
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:32,200
Her first gaming console was called the Cassette Vision.

1316
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:35,200
She has kept most of the consoles and software that she bought over the years.

1317
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:39,200
And she says they treasure them because it brings her memories.

1318
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:42,200
Currently, she likes to play PS4. She's into action games.

1319
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:47,200
And her current favorite is Grand Theft Auto 5.

1320
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,200
She says it's like watching a film.

1321
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:54,200
I like it the best because it has age restrictions so children can't play it.

1322
01:15:54,200 --> 01:16:00,200
And then she started uploading her gaming videos on YouTube because she wanted to share her experiences with other people.

1323
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:05,200
And her quote says it's such a waste if I'm the only one enjoying it.

1324
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:09,200
So she tries to post like three to four videos a month and she loves her fans.

1325
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:15,200
She says that they're very caring and concerned for her and that she thinks that playing video games rejuvenates her spirit.

1326
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,200
And here's the last quote from her.

1327
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:22,200
After living for this long, I feel more than ever that playing games for this long was the right choice.

1328
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:26,200
I am truly enjoying my life. It's Rosie.

1329
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:30,200
I love that.

1330
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:37,200
And so, and she just, the pictures of her, you can just see absolute joy on her face while she's playing it.

1331
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:41,200
So I linked the Guinness article in chat.

1332
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:48,200
I've got one of her videos up, but I can only see her fingers playing Days Gone in this video.

1333
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,200
So I don't actually see her face. That's unfortunate.

1334
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:53,200
We're like watching her play, but she's not really there.

1335
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:58,200
So I put a link to her to the pictures that are to the Guinness article.

1336
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:06,200
OK, you can see her her just the smile on her face while she's playing in her interview.

1337
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:10,200
It's really cute. Yeah. Well, then you can see there's a lot of different videos on her channel.

1338
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:13,200
You can see in some of them, you can actually see like I have big news.

1339
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:18,200
And oh, this over, she's unboxing her PlayStation four. This is probably a good one from a few years ago.

1340
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:23,200
So here we go. She's very excited to be opening your PlayStation four. That's awesome.

1341
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:29,200
Yeah, she just it just she just looks like she authentically enjoys it.

1342
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:36,200
And I we need more people who will be happy to play games and play them as they get older,

1343
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:42,200
because they say that that you get older because you stop playing.

1344
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,200
I bet it keeps her healthy, too, like, you know, just keeping.

1345
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:51,200
I know we always that was the big thing when we were kids is that I'm working on my hand eye coordination.

1346
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:54,200
Right. And we all know, like, but there there is something to that.

1347
01:17:54,200 --> 01:18:00,200
Those motor skills and things that might not be tested in older age specifically.

1348
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:07,200
I think that kind of does help. I mean, I'm no scientist or doctor, but it would make a lot of sense that like keeping those things alert.

1349
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:12,200
That's why they had Wii Sports and all the retirement homes. Right. It was a big part of that.

1350
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:21,200
So the other the other thing about this, too, is just I would, you know, be a little bit more worried about repetitive motion injury.

1351
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:29,200
But other than that, I mean, as long as she loves it and has the joy for it, keep doing it, keep encouraging her to do it.

1352
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:37,200
And and, you know, I want to be her one day. I want to be a cute old Japanese lady.

1353
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:42,200
Well, maybe if you ask very nicely, no.

1354
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:47,200
But well, heck, we might still be doing a well are when we're 90 at this rate.

1355
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:51,200
Great. I know I still know about it.

1356
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:56,200
I know one will be listening to get us to get us to be like, it's the longest running podcast.

1357
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:59,200
They're like, who? Oh, yeah. Who cares?

1358
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:05,200
Well, we'll actually wear the clown makeup.

1359
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:08,200
Well, I do that anyway as a sister.

1360
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:16,200
He who is Steve in our chat says about the gamer grandma, that's too sweet.

1361
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:20,200
She's seen far scarier things in her 90 years than some zombies.

1362
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:25,200
Lol. That's true. Days, days gone. That's nothing for gamer grandma.

1363
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:30,200
Well, yeah, but I mean, you think about it. Hold on. Where does where in Japan does she live?

1364
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:36,200
But I mean, she would have been a teenager, maybe not a teenager,

1365
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:43,200
maybe a younger child when Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed and she would have lived through that.

1366
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:47,200
And that's nothing to joke about. But that's very that's very like, you know, yeah, you're right.

1367
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:53,200
Very low, low points. Just like the kids today are, you know, well, I'd say some of the kids are having to deal with,

1368
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:58,200
you know, being young when the World Trade Center was bombed or kids now living through a pandemic.

1369
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:05,200
Yeah. Oh, yeah. I liked it. But she she was a witness to the history in Japan.

1370
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:11,200
So just saying. All right. And to see her just finding such joy in this, it just, you know,

1371
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:17,200
it makes me think that there's a moral to be taken out of this and that moral to me should be to always look for fun.

1372
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:25,200
And don't you know, don't let I'd say the worst of humanity make you judge all of humanity.

1373
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:31,200
Although maybe I'm a little judgmental. Well, rock on, Gamer Grandma, you're an inspiration, to be quite honest.

1374
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:37,200
So, yeah, but we're we're coming for you. We're going to keep our going into our 90s.

1375
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:41,200
So we're going to continue our legacy. That's right. That's right. All right.

1376
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:45,200
Let's see the world's oldest podcasters. Let's move on.

1377
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:52,200
Loki, some folks in chat were concerned when they saw this on the sidebar about the private club Penguin Servers.

1378
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:57,200
Kind of like that can't be good. What's going on, Loki? It's not.

1379
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:01,200
It's a spoiler alert. It's not. It's not.

1380
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:10,200
So, yes, apparently people are clamoring to play Club Penguin, even though it's been shut down for a while now.

1381
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:17,200
And of course, now they're coming under fire because Club Penguin,

1382
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:23,200
these private servers that are out there are just full of all sorts of bad things.

1383
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:29,200
So, for example, you know, you've got people filling it full of hate speech and sexual content.

1384
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:37,200
So foul language. There's people engaging in what they call penguin sex and just all sorts of weird stuff.

1385
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:42,200
A bunch of people. It's a bunch of people with no accountability having no accountability.

1386
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:50,200
Right. Exactly. And because it's not on brand with Disney, they have filed DMCA complaints against all of these different things.

1387
01:21:50,200 --> 01:22:00,200
So they have a, you know, club Club Penguin re-written, I guess, is one of those in the complaint.

1388
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:07,200
Yeah, they basically are just saying, hey, you guys don't have the right to run these private servers, so stop it.

1389
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:14,200
I would imagine maybe they would have let it go if it was just, you know, family friendly fun.

1390
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:21,200
But because it's just all sorts of dirty filth and garbage. Yeah.

1391
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,200
It's got to go.

1392
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:30,200
He who is Steven Chat says, well, that's nothing new. It's been a long running challenge to see how fast you could get banned from Club Penguin.

1393
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,200
But on these private servers, people aren't getting banned.

1394
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:38,200
And so it's putting I mean, technically the trademark for Club Penguin and all of that still does belong to Disney.

1395
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:46,200
So if Disney wanted to do a Club Penguin movie or a Disney plus thing, which I think didn't I hear the Club Penguin was going to be a Disney plus thing at some point?

1396
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:51,200
Like they don't want this shit tarnishing their brand. That's a big problem.

1397
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:58,200
Right. Exactly. Because folks don't know, like if there is articles about this coming out, they may not know that Disney is not running this.

1398
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:04,200
They're just like, well, it's a Disney game and I'm seeing screenshots of all this filth. I don't want my kids playing that Disney.

1399
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:11,200
What are you doing? Why are you allowing this? So, of course, they have to come after it.

1400
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:16,200
Yeah. And it's, you know, it's that whole protecting their intellectual property and all that they have to do that.

1401
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:22,200
So, yeah. Heaven forbid, Animal Crossing New Horizons, that server ever goes down.

1402
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:26,200
That's I mean, people are already doing seedy things in that game.

1403
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:32,200
But I guess there's only so much you can do right for now.

1404
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:36,200
Anyway. All right. Let's move on. Let's talk a little bit about this.

1405
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:41,200
I think this is really cool. A Twitch extension coming out for a game, which Jamie, you've talked about.

1406
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:46,200
I really want to play this game. I haven't yet. It's like on my list of I'll get to it eventually.

1407
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:49,200
But it's Detroit by Quantic Dream.

1408
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:57,200
And Quantic Dream is actually putting out an official Twitch add on that will allow viewers to influence the key decisions in the game.

1409
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:02,200
That's pretty cool. That sounds crazy. Yeah. Yeah. It's called Detroit Community Play.

1410
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:10,200
And it will allow polls to start automatically in your chat for up to one hundred and fifty different plot points that are in the game.

1411
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:15,200
And so your viewers essentially will vote on what should the streamer do next.

1412
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:19,200
So you could let your viewers control the whole game if you wanted to.

1413
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:23,200
There's going to be a preview of this. I think it's happening tomorrow. Yeah.

1414
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:30,200
Tomorrow at 11 a.m. and Quantic Dream is going to do an event on their own Twitch channel, which is twitch.tv slash Quantic Dream.

1415
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:36,200
And they're going to show this off. They're actually going to have Brian Deschart and Amelia Rose Blair.

1416
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:41,200
Those names may not be married. They may not sound like familiar names, but they are Connor and Tracy.

1417
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:46,200
They play characters in the game. So they're going to be demonstrating the extension during the opening scene of the game.

1418
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:51,200
So that's pretty cool. And yeah, what they also cost their characters.

1419
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:56,200
I love that. That's like what's her name that does.

1420
01:24:56,200 --> 01:25:02,200
Oh, my gosh. Why can't I remember Samara in Mass Effect? Oh, yeah. She cosplays her all the time.

1421
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:06,200
Rana. Mm hmm. I can't remember the rest of her name, but Rana something.

1422
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:13,200
Yeah. And somebody got the guy who is Caden's like they got him to cosplay as Kate.

1423
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:17,200
And even though he doesn't do the voice, he's just the likeness. It's like a model. Yeah.

1424
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:20,200
They got him to cosplay as Caden, too. It's pretty it's pretty fun.

1425
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:24,200
And of course, Mark Mears definitely cosplay as Shepard. But Mark Mears doesn't look like Shepard.

1426
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:29,200
But it's always fun to see the people, you know, kind of cosplay their characters.

1427
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:34,200
Shepard looks how you want Shepard to look. That's true, too. Thanks to Mott.

1428
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:44,200
But no, those two together, they actually both stream and they streamed Detroit in costume as well.

1429
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:48,200
It was pretty amazing. They're just fun to look at on Instagram and Twitter.

1430
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:54,200
You know who else has been streaming a lot on Twitch lately that's been getting a lot of visibility is and I forget her name.

1431
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:58,200
I'm sorry, but she's the gal who voices Aerith in the Final Fantasy seven remake.

1432
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:06,200
She's and there was a very popular viral clip of her seeing her character and hearing the lines for the first time in the game.

1433
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:11,200
Like because, you know, she she doesn't get like a special preview or anything like she went in to do a job.

1434
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:14,200
She did the acting job. Thank you. Here's your paycheck. Goodbye.

1435
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:20,200
You know, I'm not trying to belittle what is a very difficult career, but that's just you know, you you think in your mind.

1436
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:23,200
Oh, and there's lavish red carpet premieres and she gets free copies of the game.

1437
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:27,200
Well, she might get a free copy of the game, but she doesn't get to necessarily play it before anybody else.

1438
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:35,200
So there's actually a clip of her seeing herself essentially in the game for the first time and she kind of cries and it's it's very touching.

1439
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:39,200
And so that's a very popular clip around Twitter right now, too. And I know she's doing a lot.

1440
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:48,200
So pretty cool. All right. Well, let's take a step back to classic times when we weren't streaming games.

1441
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:53,200
We weren't we weren't running the games online and playing them for other people.

1442
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:58,200
We were playing them in the privacy of our own homes for us and maybe whoever else is on the couch.

1443
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:05,200
It's the classic game of the week. And every week, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking this game out.

1444
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:15,200
And Dark Sakura, you picked something this week that like I have 30 seconds of video for literally.

1445
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:19,200
And I I don't hear you for some reason because the listeners here, Dark Sakura.

1446
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:22,200
There we go. Sorry, Adam. I was muted. That's all right.

1447
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:28,200
I thought I picked like a good long play, but I guess I guess not. Maybe I linked the wrong thing. That's OK. We'll make it work.

1448
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:38,200
OK. Well, at any rate, the game in question is actually a series that I'm going over because with the advent of the Turbo Graphics 16 mini slash PC Engine Mini,

1449
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:46,200
there are probably people who are seeing this Super Momotaro Densetsu and like, the fuck is this?

1450
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:55,200
I can't read any of this, so I'm going to go over some of the some of what this series is.

1451
01:27:55,200 --> 01:28:07,200
So Momotaro Densetsu is a board game style game where you travel by rail or ship or airplane to acquire wealth through business transactions.

1452
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:14,200
You buy properties, you deal with rival entrepreneurs and your nemesis, such as the god of poverty.

1453
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:23,200
And it's been complaint compared to Monopoly or Sogoro, which is a game I haven't played, but whatever.

1454
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:31,200
At any rate, it was first the series started in 1988, produced by Hudson Soft.

1455
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:36,200
And then the rights are now owned, of course, by Konami after they absorbed Hudson in 2012.

1456
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:48,200
But the game is is kind of some people think it's a play on a title for another Hudson game, which is another

1457
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:58,200
Momotaro Densetsu. So it's a role playing game based on the you know, the the from the tale of the bamboo cutter and other Japanese folklore.

1458
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:11,200
But that's not what I'm talking about. So the project supervisor for the series is Sakuma Akira illustration done by Doi Takayuki and the music done by Sekiguchi Kazuyuki.

1459
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:20,200
It's been super popular in Japan for an age. It has exceeded 12 million units for this series.

1460
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:33,200
And for the 20th anniversary of the series, Hudson collaborated with a company called Choshi Electric Railway Line to create a rail train dedicated to a Momotaro Densetsu.

1461
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:37,200
And the train ran until its third anniversary.

1462
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:51,200
And then there are two Momotaro themed restaurants in Japan at different rail stations, one at Hijima and the other at Kami Nagaya.

1463
01:29:51,200 --> 01:30:10,200
So at any rate, it also from 2004, it also had some famous Japanese comedians involved in their marketing, Junai Tomonori and Wakatsuki Chinatsu.

1464
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,200
So there we go.

1465
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:23,200
But sadly, in 2015, the creator of the series, Sakuma, said, I'm announcing here that Momotaro Densetsu is officially done. Ishikawa at Konami squelched everything.

1466
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:30,200
However, in 2015, Konami loaned the license to Nintendo for an unspecified amount of money.

1467
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:38,200
Seven years, no game until a game was released exclusive to the Nintendo 3DS.

1468
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:50,200
And of course, that one on 3DS was Momotaro Densetsu 2017, Taegare Nippon.

1469
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:54,200
There was another one before that called Momotaro Densetsu World.

1470
01:30:54,200 --> 01:31:00,200
And there's also one this year, Momotaro Densetsu Shouwa Heisei Reiwa Motaidon.

1471
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:03,200
So there we go. There's a bunch of mobile games.

1472
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:07,200
There's an iOS game that came out in 2017.

1473
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:15,200
But now this is going to wind me back around to the one on Turbo graphics, or sorry, PC Engine.

1474
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,200
It was a HuCard game.

1475
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:20,200
And it's called Super Momotaro Densetsu 2.

1476
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:23,200
It is the second of the Super games in the series.

1477
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:28,200
And the third game overall, it was first released on Super Famicom.

1478
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:33,200
Both Momotaro Densetsu and Super Momotaro Densetsu were Famicom games.

1479
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:41,200
But the games were also released on PC Engine and there's a Game Boy one.

1480
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:49,200
And so with this year, again, you're taking turns moving your train around a board to buy properties and trade resources.

1481
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:59,200
So you are quite the little business person in this game with a good bit of cuteness and a lot of classic Japanese imagery going on.

1482
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:05,200
Of course, trains are very much more popular in Japan, of course, than they are here.

1483
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:08,200
It has a big theme in the series.

1484
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:10,200
So there you go.

1485
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,200
You can get games.

1486
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:16,200
I'll just go through a list of what the series has been on.

1487
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:29,200
So it's been on Famicom, PC Engine, Game Boy, Super Famicom, Sega Game Gear, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, GameCube, GBA.

1488
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,200
There's Game Boy Advance, of course.

1489
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:33,200
We've had Xbox 360.

1490
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:42,200
That was Momotaro Densetsu 16 Gold, which is another version of Momotaro Densetsu 16 moving in Hokkaido.

1491
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,200
We've had DS versions.

1492
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:50,200
We have Wii, PSP, Nintendo DS, 3DS, Switch, that new one coming out.

1493
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:54,200
There's also been several mobile games for i-Mode.

1494
01:32:54,200 --> 01:33:00,200
Even when... trying to see what else they are.

1495
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:02,200
Yeah, they're all the Yahoo!

1496
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:06,200
Keitai, EasyWeb, so Japanese mobiles.

1497
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:17,200
And then iOS was Momotaro Densetsu Japan Plus, which came out for iPod Touch in November 27th.

1498
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:24,200
So yeah, classic ongoing series and one that maybe not a lot of Western gamers are familiar with.

1499
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:30,200
So since for all of us who've ordered our TurboGrafx-16 Mini and are saying,

1500
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:33,200
what the hell is this craziness, that's what it is.

1501
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:36,200
And I hope your Japanese reading skills are up to par.

1502
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:46,200
But I do believe that there are FAQs and translated ROMs out there for those who want to get their hands dirty.

1503
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:48,200
Well, thank you very much for that very timely pick.

1504
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:50,200
But not any official localized version, by the way.

1505
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:54,200
Right, it's an underground one, kind of like the Snatcher one.

1506
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:55,200
For sure.

1507
01:33:55,200 --> 01:34:02,200
Thank you for that very timely pick with the TurboGrafx Mini finally making its way to the US this week after a little bit of the delay.

1508
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:05,200
Due to everything else going on in the world. So cool.

1509
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:07,200
Everything else going on. That's great.

1510
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:14,200
Or there's that visual, all of this. But it doesn't translate well to the podcast.

1511
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:16,200
Hands everywhere is craziness.

1512
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:22,200
Yes. All right. Okay, let's move on. We got some more stories. We got some fast stories.

1513
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:27,200
Actually, at this point, I will be saying adieu for the evening.

1514
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:28,200
Not a problem.

1515
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:30,200
I missed a few on it, but you might not have seen it.

1516
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:37,200
Oh, yeah, I have to. I have do not disturb on right now because my phone has been blowing up. So sorry if I missed your messages, but yeah.

1517
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:40,200
So I will say bye everybody.

1518
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:42,200
Bye. It was great to see you.

1519
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:45,200
Say bye. Cuphead says bye.

1520
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:49,200
All right. Bye. We'll see you again next week.

1521
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:50,200
One more.

1522
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:53,200
Vegeta says bye.

1523
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:56,200
All right.

1524
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:58,200
Take care, everybody.

1525
01:34:58,200 --> 01:34:59,200
Bye bye.

1526
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:00,200
Stupid. Wear your mask.

1527
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:03,200
All right. Bye, Jamie. Thanks for being here.

1528
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:07,200
It was great to see Jamie tonight. So. All right. Awesome.

1529
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:11,200
All right. Well, let's get back. We've got some more news to get to.

1530
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:15,200
We're going to get into some rapid fire news. So, Loki, do you want to start us off?

1531
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:20,200
Yeah, sure. So you had another week and yet another con that's been canceled.

1532
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:26,200
So Gen Con 2020, the America's biggest board game show, has been canceled.

1533
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:29,200
Why? I guess they just didn't want to run it this time.

1534
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:32,200
No, of course, it's COVID-19.

1535
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:35,200
So they just didn't feel like it anymore.

1536
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:38,200
They didn't feel like it.

1537
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:43,200
Yeah. So unfortunately, no board game con this year.

1538
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:47,200
That is a bummer. I hate hearing about all these cons getting canceled.

1539
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:50,200
I know it's inevitable. It's probably going to happen to Dragon Con 2.

1540
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:57,200
And, you know, it's it's one of those where it's like, well, it makes sense, but it still sucks.

1541
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:03,200
Yeah. So along with that, we've got a delay of something as well.

1542
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:13,200
So Kerbal Space Program 2 has been delayed now to fall 2021 because of the unique challenges of developing during COVID-19.

1543
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:17,200
I bet. To put it lightly, yes.

1544
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:26,200
All right. Phoenix 7729 or excuse me, Phoenix 7726 in chat says, hell, PAX West might get axed this year.

1545
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:29,200
I don't want to sound negative, but honestly, count on it.

1546
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:35,200
Like, you know, it's it's I would be I would be shocked if it does happen.

1547
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:44,200
Obviously, I want to be optimistic. I want to cross my fingers and my toes that we will have a cure and or effective treatment.

1548
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:57,200
But prepare for the worst hope for the best, because I kind of feel like if you had a fun big convention or concert or mass gathering plan in 2020, it's probably best to look forward to next year instead.

1549
01:36:57,200 --> 01:37:03,200
I love the kitty that you get to show off. Oh, Mr. Smoosh, hugging all the attention all this time.

1550
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:09,200
Who's this? Who's this precious baby on? This is Stella. Hi, Stella. Sorry, podcast folks.

1551
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:14,200
You'll have imagine a very pretty kitty on cam right now. Still, I'm going to say you're going to say anything.

1552
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:18,200
No, no, no. Stella's shy. All right. Anyhow.

1553
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:24,200
Oops. And of course, with Dark Sakura having left, we just I'm off camera.

1554
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:30,200
I know this is one of those things I'll need to fix in a future week. Sorry, guys. We're we're doing it live.

1555
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:35,200
No one can see the cat. I know. Hold on. I'll fix this. We can see the cat again. It's just going to take me a second here.

1556
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:41,200
You think being full screen readjusting? Well, I was supposed to be doing some rapid fire stories here, but that's fine.

1557
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:47,200
You just adjust everything and we want to see the cat. All right. How about now?

1558
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:51,200
There we go. I apologize to the podcast, folks, but we're just going crazy on the video tonight.

1559
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:55,200
All right. Anyhow, let's get into some other rapid fire news.

1560
01:37:55,200 --> 01:38:01,200
So first off, the various soundtracks for Castlevania games now on Spotify.

1561
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:06,200
We're talking games like Aria of Sorrow, Symphony of the Night. This is.

1562
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:10,200
Yeah, this is awesome. So Konami unleashed their collection on Spotify.

1563
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:15,200
They announced this on Twitter. There are different playlists that they linked.

1564
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:19,200
So, yeah, I think that's really cool. If you want to know the full rundown,

1565
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:25,200
we have Symphony of the Night, the original soundtrack, Castlevania Chronicles, Circle of the Moon and Harmony of Dissonance,

1566
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:29,200
Lament of Innocence, Curse of Darkness, Aria of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin,

1567
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:34,200
the Dracula Chronicles, Order of Ecclesia, Castlevania Judgment, Castlevania Harmony of Despair.

1568
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:39,200
How dare they leave out Castlevania 64? How could they? Just kidding.

1569
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:45,200
All right. Well, we just all like to forget that along with the Wii fighting game that they had.

1570
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:51,200
Oh, God, I forgot about that. I wish I could stay forgetting about that.

1571
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:56,200
All right. The Epic Game Store is giving away Civilization 6.

1572
01:38:56,200 --> 01:39:02,200
If you are not already aware, you should really get on that unless you're like morally opposed to the Epic Game Store,

1573
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:07,200
which I understand people have their reservations. But if you are like Epic Games or you're playing Fortnite

1574
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:11,200
and you have it on your computer anyway, you really should grab Civ 6 while it's free.

1575
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:17,200
You only have a few more days to do it. So it is free until 11 a.m. Eastern on May 28th.

1576
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:22,200
So just like they gave away Grand Theft Auto 5 last week, they're giving away Civ 6 this week.

1577
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:26,200
And it's honestly like a must have, especially at the price of free.

1578
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:28,200
I wonder what next week's going to be.

1579
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:33,200
Yeah, there are some leaks out there that called these two.

1580
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:37,200
So now it's kind of like, all right, well, since they got both these right, they probably got the rest right, too.

1581
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:43,200
And so if you want to believe the leaks, the next game will be the Borderlands Handsome Collection.

1582
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:45,200
That'll be a pretty good one, too.

1583
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:49,200
Yeah, it's good for people that don't have it.

1584
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:53,200
How do you think I feel about Civ 6? All right.

1585
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:56,200
Yeah, that's true. I'll just pick it up on the other platform.

1586
01:39:56,200 --> 01:40:02,200
My problem is I have all the expansions and stuff on the Steam version.

1587
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:05,200
All right.

1588
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:10,200
Phantasy Star Online 2 is going to be launching on the PC this coming week.

1589
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:15,200
It launches on May 27th. I am very excited about that.

1590
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:19,200
I've played it a little bit on Xbox One. I'm going to play it even more on PC.

1591
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:23,200
So that is very, very, very cool. So I'm hoping some live streams with that.

1592
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:27,200
I know Delvin over at VG Realness and I were talking about doing some team-ups.

1593
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:30,200
And when we played PSO Blue Burst, we had a shit ton of fun.

1594
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:33,200
So I'm really hoping that carries over into PSO 2.

1595
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:37,200
I'll probably be starting over, to be quite honest, on PSO 2.

1596
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:44,200
Just because I got overwhelmed by everything there is to do in the game.

1597
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:47,200
All right. I need to go back.

1598
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:51,200
All right. Moving on. The PlayStation 5.

1599
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:56,200
Maybe not being revealed in June, they say.

1600
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:59,200
We don't know.

1601
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:02,200
You know what? That's kind of why I put this in rapid-fire news.

1602
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:04,200
Because the extent of this is we've had all these rumors.

1603
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:06,200
We've had all these talk about dates and so forth.

1604
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:09,200
But at the end of the day, we don't freaking know.

1605
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:11,200
And we're going to leave it at that.

1606
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:14,200
You got, like, Microsoft's not even doing theirs until July.

1607
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:19,200
So I wouldn't expect, I mean, I guess PlayStation could jump out ahead.

1608
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:21,200
You know, release the information first.

1609
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:24,200
But everyone's in no hurry.

1610
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:26,200
Yeah.

1611
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:29,200
Real quick aside, I lost my connection to Twitch altogether.

1612
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:31,200
Like, I can't see chat anymore.

1613
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:34,200
But I show we're still pushing out data to Twitch.

1614
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:36,200
But I lost the chat room.

1615
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:40,200
So if you guys are there, maybe I can connect on my phone app and find it that way.

1616
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:42,200
Yeah, we're so good.

1617
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:44,200
God, there's a lot of stuff going on.

1618
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:46,200
Oh, you can see them fine?

1619
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:47,200
Yep.

1620
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:48,200
That's weird. That's just my computer then.

1621
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:49,200
All right.

1622
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:52,200
Help me relay any good chat comments then while we do these next few things.

1623
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:54,200
While I figure out what the hell's going on over here.

1624
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:56,200
Yeah, like the dashboard site has gone.

1625
01:41:56,200 --> 01:42:00,200
If the Mass Effect games come out in Epic, will you get them there, Rob?

1626
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:04,200
I already have them on PC through Origin.

1627
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:11,200
And as much as I love to triple dip, I don't think I can justify literally two separate releases on PC.

1628
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:15,200
However, if they gave it away for free, I might.

1629
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:17,200
I mean, free's free.

1630
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:18,200
Yeah.

1631
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:24,200
And I mean, I don't think EA would ever do that because they have their own platform that they're trying to push with Origin.

1632
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:26,200
And they were giving away games on that for a while.

1633
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:28,200
So, yeah.

1634
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:29,200
All right.

1635
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:30,200
All right.

1636
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:34,200
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

1637
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:36,200
So, Loki, if you want to start us off there.

1638
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:38,200
And again, sorry, chat.

1639
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:39,200
I can't see you guys right now.

1640
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:41,200
I'll try to get back in there as soon as I can.

1641
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:43,200
But Loki will have to cover for me until I get back.

1642
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,200
Yeah.

1643
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:49,200
My desktop over here, I think, has completely thought the Internet has died.

1644
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:51,200
That's the problem I'm having right now.

1645
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:52,200
That is fantastic.

1646
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:53,200
All right.

1647
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:54,200
OK.

1648
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:56,200
So we've got a few things this week.

1649
01:42:56,200 --> 01:43:03,200
So first off, Minecraft Dungeons on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1650
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:09,200
We have Uta, Waru, Mono, Prelude to the Fallen.

1651
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:12,200
That's PlayStation 4 and Vita.

1652
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:14,200
Wildfire on PC.

1653
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:17,200
Phantasy Star Online 2 on PC.

1654
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:25,200
Shantae and the Seven Sirens on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1655
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:26,200
Let's see.

1656
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:30,200
Umehara Kawase Bazuka.

1657
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:34,200
That's on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

1658
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:39,200
And then Umehara Kawase Fresh on PC.

1659
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:42,200
Bioshock, the collection on Switch.

1660
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:46,200
Borderlands is a legendary collection on Nintendo Switch.

1661
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:49,200
XCOM 2, the collection on Nintendo Switch.

1662
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:54,200
And last but not least, Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition on Nintendo Switch.

1663
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:55,200
Oh, God, that's right.

1664
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:56,200
That's this week, too.

1665
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:57,200
That's a huge one.

1666
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:59,200
I can't wait to check that out.

1667
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:00,200
Yeah.

1668
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:01,200
Oh, boy.

1669
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:02,200
Oh, boy.

1670
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:03,200
All right.

1671
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:04,200
Well, let's talk about Japan a little bit.

1672
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:07,200
And you guys are going to have to excuse me because I'm reduced to having to work off

1673
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:11,200
my phone right now because I'm doing the good old turn it off and on again over on this machine.

1674
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:13,200
So bear with me for a little bit here.

1675
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:18,200
But I think we can cover some of the release dates on the Nintendo Switch over in Japan.

1676
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:23,200
So in Japan, I'm seeing on the Switch, it looks like a lot of peripherals and stuff.

1677
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:25,200
Oh, we do get into some games.

1678
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:30,200
We have Dairoku Aya Kashimori in a regular and limited edition is coming out,

1679
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:36,200
as well as Uta no Prince Sama, Amazing Aria and Sweet Serenade Love is coming out as well.

1680
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:38,200
From a company called Broccoli.

1681
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:39,200
I did not make that up.

1682
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:41,200
That is that is the name of the company.

1683
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:45,200
And then Synaptic Drive, also out on the switch this week.

1684
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:49,200
And the Zombie Army Trilogy is coming out as well.

1685
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:52,200
Taking a quick look at the PlayStation four.

1686
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:54,200
We have some similar stories there.

1687
01:44:54,200 --> 01:45:01,200
We have the Legend of Heroes, Aonokisuke, Umehara Kawase Bazuka is out on the PlayStation four as well.

1688
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:03,200
And oh, the Bayonetta and Vanquish collection.

1689
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:06,200
I didn't realize that was delayed a little bit in Japan compared to here.

1690
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:08,200
But that is coming out in Japan this week.

1691
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:11,200
That whole like 10th anniversary remaster that they did.

1692
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:13,200
So that's pretty cool.

1693
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:15,200
Awesome. All right.

1694
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:18,200
Well, how about the UK, Loki? Would you mind taking that over for a minute?

1695
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:24,200
So the UK, we've got also Minecraft Dungeons on PC and Xbox one.

1696
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:29,200
Slime Rancher Deluxe Edition on PlayStation four and Xbox one.

And last but not least, the Zeta League Chronicles Definitive Edition on Nintendo Switch.

1705
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:03,200
Great.

1706
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:06,200
All right. This is the part of the show where we would do emails.

1707
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:12,200
And I think I'm going to get probably just back into it here just in time.

1708
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:17,200
Sorry, guys. We have any interesting chat comments to get out while I try to get our our mail up here.

1709
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:19,200
I think turning it off and on again helped.

1710
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:22,200
But it's going to take me a minute to get everything launched again.

1711
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:28,200
Phoenix 7 7 2 6 is the last of us to launches in four days.

1712
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:32,200
I don't think so. No, I think I bumped it to June, didn't they?

1713
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:37,200
I think it was going to be at some point, but I bumped it to June.

1714
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:43,200
So because that was that whole release date update when all the spoilers happened and all that crap.

1715
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:50,200
So, yeah, it's not coming out for a while now, I think.

1716
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:57,200
Just trying to take a peek and see. I thought it was in the gym.

1717
01:46:57,200 --> 01:47:03,200
I don't remember. I could look it up, but but you know, it is coming out, though, on the fourth.

1718
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:08,200
What's that? We've we've got clubhouse games on the switch.

1719
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:13,200
Is that that soon? I'm excited about that. I heard that has like Wii bowling in it.

1720
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:18,200
Does it? Yeah. Isn't that crazy? I know.

1721
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:26,200
I think that's awesome, though. They should put out like a new Wii sports type thing for the switch.

1722
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:30,200
I mean, I know that's not as easy to do.

1723
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:34,200
I mean, you can't really play that portable, but. Well, maybe you could.

1724
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:41,200
You could play in handled mode or not handheld, but like in that non docked mode,

1725
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:45,200
we're just sitting there on this crappy kickstand. Yeah, that's true. You can.

1726
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:50,200
All right. I have Internet back on this machine. Yay. All right. Let's move on.

1727
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:54,200
Unplugging it and plugging it back in fixes it. Go figure. All right. Moving on.

1728
01:47:54,200 --> 01:48:01,200
I think my chair got so close it like knocked out the USB for the Internet or knocked it out just enough.

1729
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:05,200
Anyway, isn't that ridiculous? All right. Let's get to our e-mails.

1730
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:10,200
You guys e-mail us. Participate at orangesontrader.com and we read your e-mails here on the show.

1731
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:15,200
As long as they're not like downright mean or offensive or we have like a lot because like there have been some e-mails.

1732
01:48:15,200 --> 01:48:18,200
I haven't read, but it's because we get a lot of e-mails in a certain week or something.

1733
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:21,200
We do have one e-mail this week and I certainly will read it because it's from our power.

1734
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:25,200
Why? Why are so let's get to it. It's a long e-mail, but that's OK.

1735
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:28,200
It's one e-mail. So we'll do a long one. Hello, L.R.

1736
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:33,200
I actually would have preferred to call in at the end of the show about this and was planning to do that.

1737
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:37,200
But then I remembered you're not taking calls at the moment. So we'll have to settle for an e-mail.

1738
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:43,200
And, yeah, for the for the next little bit, we're not going to be doing the discord part.

1739
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:45,200
And that's nothing to do with you guys. You guys are amazing.

1740
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:51,200
But now, especially because I'm having to adjust everything on the fly, we have video and all those other elements that are going on.

1741
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:58,200
We're just going to kind of encourage you guys to use chat, Twitter and some of these other methods.

1742
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:01,200
Obviously, we would hope this world situation does end up being temporary.

1743
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:09,200
And maybe in a few more months we can talk about not having to do the shelter in place and we can mix a little bit, just a little bit safely.

1744
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:15,200
But right now, yeah, we can't do that. So we have to do things a little bit differently.

1745
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:20,200
All right. Anyway, moving to the rest of the e-mail here.

1746
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:27,200
During last week's discussion about DDRV, Loki asked why Konami doesn't just port their current Bawani games to PC.

1747
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:31,200
Actually, some of their current games have already received or will soon be receiving home versions.

1748
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:35,200
However, most of them are very difficult for North American players to access thus far,

1749
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:42,200
despite the fact that current arcade versions of DDR2DX and even Ghidodora now feature full English language support.

1750
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:46,200
I'll mention briefly, we need to keep in mind that Japan is still their primary market.

1751
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:51,200
I can't speak for what would happen if everyone in America had easy access to arcades containing Bawani games.

1752
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:55,200
But at this current time, there are many more Bawani players in Japan than in America.

1753
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:59,200
So all the products I'm about to mention have only been released in Japan thus far.

1754
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:03,200
It's possible to play them in other countries if you're willing to jump through some hoops,

1755
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:05,200
but it's not a click click done kind of thing.

1756
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:10,200
Currently, there are PC versions of BeatMania 2DX and SoundVoltex that are playable at home.

1757
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:15,200
However, because they play very similarly to the arcade game and Konami doesn't want to compete with themselves,

1758
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:17,200
neither one is paid to own.

1759
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:21,200
2DX requires a monthly subscription that costs about $15.

1760
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:25,200
SoundVoltex can be played on an unlimited basis for about $20 per month,

1761
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:27,200
though some songs will be inaccessible.

1762
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:32,200
You also have the option to pay per play, similarly to how the game works in arcades,

1763
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:36,200
with almost the same song list as the current arcade version.

1764
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:41,200
As a quick aside, isn't that kind of how Neon FM works on mobile?

1765
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:44,200
If I remember right, it's been a hot minute since I've played that,

1766
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:51,200
but I remember playing it in the arcade would give you credits to play the phone game one,

1767
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:56,200
and the phone game one you either had to buy credits or you could get like one or two a day.

1768
01:50:56,200 --> 01:51:01,200
Again, I haven't played in quite some time, so I hope I'm not misrepresenting,

1769
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:05,200
but that is very interesting about the whole they don't want to compete against themselves,

1770
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:07,200
and it does raise an interesting point.

1771
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:13,200
But I'm also kind of like you can't really control something like Neon FM the same way on a mobile phone that you do in the arcade,

1772
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:20,200
so for me nothing replicates the arcade experience, but I realize I'm changing the argument a little bit there.

1773
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:23,200
Speaking of mobile though, let me get back to YYR's email.

1774
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:29,200
Also, a mobile version of BeatMania 2DX released last December, called BeatMania 2DX Ultimate Mobile,

1775
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:33,200
it actually features the same song list as the current arcade version.

1776
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:39,200
You can play using your touchscreen or by plugging in a controller that is very similar to the old official controller for PS2.

1777
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:43,200
For free, you can choose from about 100 songs, though like many other free-to-play games,

1778
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:48,200
playing songs will drain a stamina meter that takes time to replenish unless you pay to fill it up.

1779
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:55,200
You can also subscribe for $4.50 or $9 per month to ditch the stamina meter and gain access to the full song list.

1780
01:51:55,200 --> 01:52:01,200
The lower tier subscription includes 2 out of 3 difficulties, the higher tier adds the hardest difficulty.

1781
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:07,200
Both tiers also give you access to a music player that contains almost every Bamani soundtrack ever released

1782
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:11,200
from currently supported games outside of DDR and SoundVoltex.

1783
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:17,200
The lower tier only gives you access to 2DX soundtracks, but the higher tier gives you access to all of them.

1784
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:23,200
Once again, the game is only available in Japan, but if you're able to access apps from other countries, you're good.

1785
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:28,200
Planned for release during 2020 are similar mobile versions of both SoundVoltex and DDR.

1786
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:33,200
So, we now have an idea as to what new Konami versions of Bamani games look like.

1787
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:38,200
I now ask, are you still jonesing for these, or do these sound like hot garbage to you?

1788
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:42,200
Would you be interested in subscribing to one of these if it did make its way to America,

1789
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:47,200
or are you turned off by a subscription or pay-to-play model? What say you?

1790
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:52,200
Yes, I am turned off by a pay-to-play model.

1791
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:53,200
I'm not.

1792
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:54,200
I'd rather just...

1793
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:55,200
I'm not.

1794
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:56,200
I don't know.

1795
01:52:56,200 --> 01:53:02,200
Because of Neon FM, the way they're doing it doesn't offend me.

1796
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:05,200
And it doesn't sound that dissimilar from what you're talking about here.

1797
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:10,200
Now, granted, one key thing that's missing that I think would be really cool if Konami did it

1798
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:15,200
was that when you play in the arcade, you get coins to play the phone version.

1799
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:19,200
Because it's like, you're supporting the arcade version, you're kind of paying there,

1800
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:21,200
so you get some plays in the home version.

1801
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:24,200
And, you know, we have enough round ones and things like that.

1802
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:25,200
I know it's not everywhere.

1803
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:31,200
And the current world situation aside, and can you even play it round one anymore?

1804
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:32,200
Let's put that on the back burner for now.

1805
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:36,200
But I think that's a pretty neat way to do it.

1806
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:40,200
Something else to consider, because it didn't come up in the email,

1807
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:45,200
Konami has released some of their games on mobile in the US, especially on iPad.

1808
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:48,200
U-Beat and Reflect Beat come to mind.

1809
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:51,200
And now that I'm saying those, you probably knew that and remember that.

1810
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:57,200
Granted, those did not do pay-to-play, but I seem to remember U-Beat only had like two songs.

1811
01:53:57,200 --> 01:54:01,200
Unless you started buying song packs, then you got a lot more with it.

1812
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:03,200
So it wasn't really free-to-play.

1813
01:54:03,200 --> 01:54:06,200
And then Reflect Beat I think was a similar thing.

1814
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:10,200
But I'm not, I don't completely hate this.

1815
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:14,200
I'm not sure I would subscribe to the super difficult $9 tier.

1816
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:18,200
But I might give it a little bit of money now and then,

1817
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:23,200
or especially if it linked up with the arcade version, I would love that.

1818
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:26,200
So yeah, maybe that answer surprises you.

1819
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:30,200
But I think, again, like Neon FM, I don't hate it.

1820
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:33,200
And I think it does something very similar.

1821
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:35,200
So sure, why not?

1822
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:39,200
Anyway, back to more YYREmail.

1823
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:45,200
I'll end by saying that I have no plans to port Super Multitasking to Unreal Engine 5.

1824
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:52,200
Sorry if this disappoints you, but the thing I'm using now costs me zero in royalties, even if I make over a million dollars.

1825
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:54,200
Sorry if this...

1826
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:55,200
Go ahead.

1827
01:54:55,200 --> 01:55:00,200
Yeah, I was gonna say, you would still, you know, not have to pay royalties anyways with Unreal 5.

1828
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:03,200
And I mean, ray tracing.

1829
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:07,200
We need it in all the things. I want all of those pixels super shiny.

1830
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:15,200
I support YYRE using whatever paper, what do you want to say, paper method, method he wants to use.

1831
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:18,200
Engine, he can do whatever he wants.

1832
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:22,200
Sorry if this email was forever long. Have a great week, everyone.

1833
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:24,200
No, I enjoy the long emails.

1834
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:27,200
And you're right, we don't have the calls right now, so we're gonna get some longer emails.

1835
01:55:27,200 --> 01:55:30,200
And that is all good by me.

1836
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:34,200
Alright, if you want to send an email for a future week, please do so.

1837
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:38,200
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com is the place to send those emails.

1838
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:44,200
We do have a few more stories for you guys before we take your questions from chat, so let's get to it.

1839
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:46,200
Loki.

1840
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:59,200
So it's like this very short-lived saga that we were talking just literally last week about Doom Eternal getting some controversial anti-cheat update and adding de novo to it.

1841
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:03,200
And then just like that, they're taking it out again.

1842
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:06,200
So apparently there's gonna be an update.

1843
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:14,200
It says, despite our best intentions, feedback from players has made it clear that we must re-evaluate our approach to anti-cheat integration.

1844
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:19,200
And with that, we will be removing anti-cheat technology from the game in our next PC update.

1845
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:30,200
I think this is a good thing, but at the same time, I always shudder a little bit to think that complaining on the internet actually worked in a scenario.

1846
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:35,200
But points were made, you know.

1847
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:40,200
It's just de novo. Maybe if they had another brand of...

1848
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:45,200
And it super didn't make sense in a single-player environment either.

1849
01:56:45,200 --> 01:56:51,200
And I think that was the biggest, like, you know, for me, I'm kinda like, well, why is this on there if we don't need the single-player environment?

1850
01:56:51,200 --> 01:57:04,200
But don't forget the Discord comment from last week that I still think is very good, and that is about, you know, everyone got pissed off at this, but how much other bullshit do you have on your computer running in the background that, you know, you're not getting as angry about?

1851
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:08,200
And I think that was a damn good point that was raised, to be honest.

1852
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:12,200
So something to consider for the internet mob.

1853
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:24,200
Definitely. I mean, there's lots of other games that have shady things to them, or even just, not necessarily games themselves, but just, like, middleware for different things.

1854
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:28,200
Yeah. So, alright.

1855
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:35,200
We'll see what they end up... I wonder if they're gonna replace it with a different anti-cheat thing, or they're just gonna let, you know, if people want to hack, then screw it, we tried.

1856
01:57:35,200 --> 01:57:38,200
I'm very curious to see what it kind of looks like.

1857
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:45,200
They're just never gonna win. They're gonna have people complaining, like, there's to be hackers in here, and then when they try to fix it, we don't like the anti-cheat.

1858
01:57:45,200 --> 01:57:47,200
It is a no-win scenario.

1859
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:49,200
What do you want me to do?

1860
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:58,200
Sometimes what also feels like a no-win scenario is when you buy a game on, say, Steam or Epic Games Store or something, and then it goes on sale the very next day, and it's like, damn it.

1861
01:57:58,200 --> 01:58:06,200
Even though the same thing can happen in the real world, right? You go and you buy, like, a shirt or something, and then you see the ad, oh, it's going on sale next week.

1862
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:13,200
You know, and some stores in the real world will offer you, like, the difference. Like, you can take your receipt in and get the difference up to a certain amount of time.

1863
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:18,200
And now we have word of online retailers offering to do the same thing, and that's Epic Games Store.

1864
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:24,200
So Epic Games Store is supposed to be streamlining the process of returning and repurchasing a game.

1865
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:31,200
So basically what happens is an automated system that basically you return the game, you rebuy it, so you're kind of getting that difference back.

1866
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:45,200
So there's actually some emails and things going out about this because what happened, a tweet went out where a guy from a studio actually got a partial refund from a game where the price dropped after he bought it.

1867
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:54,200
And it said, you recently placed orders from the Epic Games Store. The price of the game you purchased was recently lowered, so we are issuing partial refunds for the difference.

1868
01:58:54,200 --> 01:59:06,200
That's a pretty big deal. I got to admit, one reason I've been very hesitant to buy Tetris Effect on Epic Games Store, well, number one, I'm not giving them my credit card information, but I heard you can use PayPal or Amazon Pay or something.

1869
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:14,200
You can, and did you happen to claim the free, well, it wasn't granted, you claimed something on there.

1870
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:23,200
The $10 coupon, yes. Yes, I did get that, and so I'm really thinking of getting Tetris Effect, but one thing that was kind of holding me back was,

1871
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:30,200
well, what if they give that game away next? But then, of course, the leak came out and it's not on the leak list, but what if it goes on sale, but it's on sale now.

1872
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:40,200
So I feel like my hesitation there, oh, I feel a little better about it. I think I probably will, probably before the next time we record, I will have successfully double dipped on Tetris Effect and bought that on PC.

1873
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:49,200
So, you know, but honestly, those of you that have played Tetris Effect can probably relate, right? It's a great game.

1874
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:56,200
So, yeah. Anyway, so that's pretty cool. I hope it doesn't hurt the developers too bad.

1875
01:59:56,200 --> 02:00:07,200
I hope that Epic is eating a good chunk of the cost there, but I also kind of think if it does add up to the goodwill and it puts more faith in people purchasing,

1876
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:16,200
that probably actually will help developers in the long run because people won't be doing what I just admitted to doing with Tetris Effect, being hesitant to buy it because you know it's going to go on sale soon.

1877
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:20,200
So now you can buy it with a little bit more confidence, and that's pretty cool.

1878
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:26,200
So, alright. Bobby Blackwolf is pointing out Tetris Effect could release on Steam on July 23rd.

1879
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:35,200
That is true, but when it does release on Steam, it's probably going to be full price for some time, whereas it's on sale on the Epic Games Store right now.

1880
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:46,200
And I'm like, do I need it on Steam that bad? I don't know. Like, it's kind of the same thing to me. I don't really care about the trading cards and the badges and all that stuff anymore.

1881
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:54,200
It was the credit card thing that was bothering me, but PayPal, I'm okay with that. So, anyway.

1882
02:00:54,200 --> 02:01:04,200
vidpower573 says, Alternatively, buy games on the last day of the sale to make sure the game isn't given out for free before you buy it.

1883
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:11,200
Although the leak, I'm willing to believe the leak, and it's not on the leak. It seems a little early to be giving that away anyway. We'll see.

1884
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:14,200
Alright, a few more stories for you. Loki.

1885
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:22,200
Alright, so this is kind of cool. So we've talked about different companies releasing the source code for their games.

1886
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:28,200
Now we have EA releasing the source code for Command & Conquer and Red Alert.

1887
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:38,200
And this is in the efforts to allow folks to design mods, I guess a little bit easier.

1888
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:47,200
So it's basically releasing the Tiberian Dawn DLL and Red Alert DLL and their corresponding source code under GPL version 3.0.

1889
02:01:47,200 --> 02:01:54,200
I'm curious to see what comes out of this. I love the old Red Alert games.

1890
02:01:54,200 --> 02:02:06,200
But with the EA and stuff, I'm worried. I'm assuming though with the license that they have, they're not going to necessarily own all of the mods that you make.

1891
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:18,200
To me, the gut feeling is that Bethesda, the thing that they were doing with their paid mod marketplace, where something's like, okay, make some cool mods.

1892
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:22,200
Now we own all of that stuff. Maybe I'm thinking Blizzard.

1893
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:25,200
That was the thing with Warcraft 3 Reforged, yes.

1894
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:31,200
So maybe I'm thinking more of a Blizzard on this, but I don't know. It's a good idea.

1895
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:40,200
I guess if you're trying to get some more interest into your older games, perhaps maybe we'll see a new Red Alert or Command & Conquer game come out.

1896
02:02:40,200 --> 02:02:45,200
And this is to kind of get people interested in that. I'm down.

1897
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:49,200
Are you actually going to do anything with the source code?

1898
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:50,200
Oh God, no.

1899
02:02:50,200 --> 02:02:52,200
I don't have time for that.

1900
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:58,200
This is kind of like, you know, we had that story about the Wii source code got leaked last week and it was kind of like, but what does that really mean?

1901
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:05,200
Because there was more this week. I glossed over a story for this week that the same thing happened to the original Xbox and so forth.

1902
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:09,200
And it's like, I guess I brought it up anyway, but it's like, really, what good does it do?

1903
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:21,200
Now, maybe Command & Conquer, I will say this, Command & Conquer is a different situation because I don't want to get bitched at by those that do have more programming prowess and knowledge and so forth.

1904
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:30,200
And probably can make better use of this because of the fact that EA is giving it out openly, then it's a little different than these stolen one situations.

1905
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:38,200
The Command & Conquer one, you know, you're in the legal clear to be in there messing with it and doing your own thing and learning from it and so forth.

1906
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:42,200
Whereas when we talk about the Wii, the original Xbox, you're not in the legal clear, right?

1907
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:47,200
Like the emulator folks have to stay away from that stuff or their emulators get shut down and all that, right?

1908
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:50,200
But with Command & Conquer, it is a little bit of a different story.

1909
02:03:50,200 --> 02:04:01,200
So I'll leave it at, I will say that, but yeah, like for the most part, like most people that read these stories and talk about these stories and tweet about these stories, probably you're never going to look at the source code or make any sense of it.

1910
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:07,200
But I suppose for the few people that can and maybe will learn something from it, it is pretty cool.

1911
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:10,200
And it is great for an archival type of purpose too.

1912
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:11,200
I think that is really cool.

1913
02:04:11,200 --> 02:04:18,200
It's like, you know, this is a part, you know, so it's like with the source code, there will always be a version of Command & Conquer able to play somewhere.

1914
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:20,200
And that's pretty cool.

1915
02:04:20,200 --> 02:04:39,200
Yeah, it'd be cool like if we'd see, you know, because not so much with Doom per se, but like there's a lot of these games that when they do release like the source code out or release, you know, some remastered version or something for free that they'll also start developing more content for it.

1916
02:04:39,200 --> 02:04:45,200
Like we've been seeing a lot of these WADs coming out from the creators of Doom and stuff, and that's pretty awesome.

1917
02:04:45,200 --> 02:04:48,200
I would like to see like more mission maps or something like that.

1918
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:56,200
That in turn has helped the PlayStation 4 release of Doom, like the Doom classic, because remember how Bethesda started like integrating the WAD support?

1919
02:04:56,200 --> 02:05:00,200
Like they're still releasing stuff, which is kind of neat for the classic Doom.

1920
02:05:00,200 --> 02:05:09,200
And yeah, so you're right, maybe it brings some type of general knowledge to Command & Conquer, or it means in a couple of weeks somebody is going to get Command & Conquer running on a refrigerator.

1921
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:12,200
That's okay too. Those are always fun to see too.

1922
02:05:12,200 --> 02:05:22,200
So yeah, like I remember like I used to mess with the rules I and I file all the time, and that was my, you know, fun with that is because you'd be able to customize units and make them way overpowered and stuff.

1923
02:05:22,200 --> 02:05:26,200
Just messing with that rules I and I file, I could change all the attributes of all the units.

1924
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:29,200
That was good enough for me to cheat my way through.

1925
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:34,200
I used to play a lot of skirmish maps, so it wouldn't necessarily be playing through the campaign.

1926
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:49,200
But it was a lot of fun though, just like setting up a skirmish map and like having like four or three or four computer opponents and just like dominating a two hour match, even though it's kind of unfair.

1927
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:55,200
It's funny you talk about editing the I and I files because even I remember doing that back in the day.

1928
02:05:55,200 --> 02:06:02,200
I want to say it was for Civilization, the original one, but it might have been another game, but I remember editing the I and I file to get people to say nasty things.

1929
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:11,200
You know, like just use four letter words and just swear and do these horrible, horrible things because, you know, I was, you know, 14 years old and super mature and that's what we do.

1930
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:19,200
But yeah, I remember even I've done the I and I editing, so for completely no artistic value whatsoever.

1931
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:35,200
Yeah, it was always just like, you know, hey, we're going to make Einstein shoot lightning out of his hands or we're going to make, you know, we're going to make the Tesla coils generate electricity and you can place them 20 spaces away from other things.

1932
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:42,200
And basically just keep building across the map until you can place one right in the middle of the enemy's headquarters and it just destroys all of them.

1933
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:44,200
Yeah, all sorts of fun stuff.

1934
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:54,200
All right. Well, last story here has to do with Nintendo rumors and, you know, everybody's kind of expecting Nintendo to do a direct in June.

1935
02:06:54,200 --> 02:07:01,200
And if you are to believe rumors and things of that nature, Nintendo may not be doing it.

1936
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:07,200
Nintendo is saying to third party developers, you don't have to wait for a direct. You can announce your games like usual.

1937
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:14,200
Nintendo may be looking at a system to what they just did with Paper Mario for the interim, where they basically announced it.

1938
02:07:14,200 --> 02:07:19,200
It's coming out in a few weeks and this could be something that we're going to be looking at.

1939
02:07:19,200 --> 02:07:21,200
Again, this is all coming from rumors.

1940
02:07:23,200 --> 02:07:29,200
If you want to go far enough, what they're saying out there is Pikmin 3 Deluxe, 3D Mario remasters.

1941
02:07:29,200 --> 02:07:33,200
We've heard that before and Super Mario 3D World Deluxe.

1942
02:07:33,200 --> 02:07:42,200
I'm on board for all of that, but again, I'm not exactly going to expect those things, but okay.

1943
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:47,200
But you may not get a lot of warning, it sounds like, before this stuff comes out.

1944
02:07:49,200 --> 02:07:57,200
What do you think, Loki? Do they need to announce things way in advance or do we live in a day and age now, especially with digital distribution, where it's like, okay, it's coming out in six weeks. Enjoy.

1945
02:07:57,200 --> 02:08:07,200
I just think people are getting kind of hungry for game announcements because it is kind of getting towards that time of year where we would expect to have a lot of those.

1946
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:12,200
I like a lot of the announcements and seeing some of this gameplay and in-depth stuff.

1947
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:13,200
Sure.

1948
02:08:13,200 --> 02:08:16,200
Yeah, I'm a little disappointed that they're not doing a direct.

1949
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:18,200
We don't know. Rumors.

1950
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:20,200
Allegedly a direct, yeah.

1951
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:29,200
I would love to see some announcements like that, just to hear about more things rather than just a Twitter video announcement or something like that.

1952
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:34,200
It would be cool, but I get it if they're not going to do that.

1953
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:42,200
You know, I have to be honest. I feel like they could do it the way they did it with Paper Mario and they would completely get away with it because at the end of the day, the Switch is still selling like hotcakes.

1954
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:45,200
Animal Crossing is the world's favorite game right now.

1955
02:08:45,200 --> 02:08:56,200
Every, you know, I feel like Nintendo is in a great position. They can kind of do what they want and it doesn't matter, except one key thing that I think kind of screws this whole thing up, investors.

1956
02:08:56,200 --> 02:09:07,200
And I feel like they're the ones that are putting on a little bit of the pressure where it's like, okay, Nintendo, Animal Crossing is the shit. It's doing great.

1957
02:09:07,200 --> 02:09:11,200
What's going to come out next? And we just don't know.

1958
02:09:11,200 --> 02:09:23,200
And so for that reason, I'm a little bit like, I don't know if Nintendo can really do this long term. It might be kind of like the thing they do during this COVID situation, depending on how long that plays out.

1959
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:33,200
But I just don't see Nintendo doing this as long term strategy because I feel like investors are going to hate it. But at the same time, investors have to be loving the profits that are being made right now.

1960
02:09:33,200 --> 02:09:45,200
So, can Nintendo rewrite the rules in that department? I suppose so. I don't know. Anyway, one other thing that should be mentioned, Bayonetta 3, it is not canceled.

1961
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:49,200
So it was reaffirmed this week. Yes, Bayonetta 3 is still being worked on.

1962
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:50,200
Who thought it was canceled?

1963
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:53,200
I don't know who thought it was canceled, but you know how Twitter is.

1964
02:09:54,200 --> 02:10:06,200
Are we going to, with that assumption, are we going to think that Metroid Prime 4 is canceled too? Because, yeah, they announced it super early, but I didn't think it was coming out this year. I mean, I don't know.

1965
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:18,200
So, good point from Mr. Shio100Matt in chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network who says we were supposed to get an announcement on that ARMS character in Smash Brothers Ultimate. Then again, that was talked about in a pre-COVID world.

1966
02:10:18,200 --> 02:10:26,200
So you're right, we were supposed to get some other further announcement on an ARMS character, but who knows how everything has been changed because of what's going on in the world.

1967
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:30,200
And that ARMS character is Waluigi.

1968
02:10:32,200 --> 02:10:34,200
I wish. I so wish.

1969
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:43,200
They should add him to ARMS for just no reason whatsoever. And then that's what the announcement is going to be is that, you know, he's coming to ARMS and therefore he's coming to Smash Brothers.

1970
02:10:44,200 --> 02:10:54,200
I love it. It's time for our listener round table. If you have any questions in chat or comments, we would really love to hear them over at Twitch.TV slash VOG Network.

1971
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:58,200
In the meantime, I will turn to Loki and ask if he has any last minute stories for us tonight.

1972
02:10:58,200 --> 02:11:11,200
I do have a couple of things. So because Pac-Man's 40th anniversary is happening now, it makes sense that there's going to be a Pac-Man 40th anniversary edition micro player.

1973
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:20,200
So My Arcade is doing their little 40th anniversary cabinet that they're putting up for $40.

1974
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:27,200
Interesting. I already have one of those My Arcades for Pac-Man. It's over. It's off screen, but it's over in my collection.

1975
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:30,200
They're good. They're good little, you know, devices.

1976
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:33,200
40 bucks seems like kind of a lot of money though for that little thing.

1977
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:43,200
They're 35 for the others usually. The My Arcade, those machines are a little bulkier than the arcade classics and those are the ones that go over 20.

1978
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:47,200
Maybe it's 30 they usually go for. Anyway, I want to get some quick comments from chat.

1979
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:54,200
Sia Tabiri says, sorry for sounding like a broken record, but have you seen any interesting Twitch collaborations recently?

1980
02:11:54,200 --> 02:12:02,200
I watched a set of six drag queens with Twitch channels playing Deceit, a mix of Dead by Daylight and Werewolf last night and it was super interesting.

1981
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:09,200
Seeing them support each other so much, really promoting each other's channel and interacting in the ways they did was such a fun time.

1982
02:12:10,200 --> 02:12:18,200
I personally didn't see that. I have heard about those types of collaborations. I want to collaborate with my friends and do some cross promotion and fun things.

1983
02:12:18,200 --> 02:12:27,200
That's when Twitch works great. That's when Twitch works right. I think it is great. And I love like streamers uplifting each other and so forth.

1984
02:12:28,200 --> 02:12:38,200
And it is interesting how drag is more and more showing up on Twitch, not just because I think, you know, folks are finding it's a great way for expression and show forth on Twitch.

1985
02:12:39,200 --> 02:12:47,200
But with all the bars and so forth being closed, there's so much of these like virtual performances and things that are being done online right now.

1986
02:12:48,200 --> 02:12:56,200
Think how hard it is for, you know, you name it, you're whatever RuPaul's Drag Race queen, they can't tour bars right now.

1987
02:12:57,200 --> 02:13:02,200
You know, especially these queens that are on season 12 and All Stars 5, because I know that's all the rage on TV right now.

1988
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:11,200
And I'm sorry to dive into RuPaul's Drag Race chat, but it is take your favorite whatever that relies on in person stuff.

1989
02:13:11,200 --> 02:13:19,200
Like it's, it's hurting right now. Like these season 12 queens should be able to tour the country and make money off their television appearance.

1990
02:13:20,200 --> 02:13:29,200
They can't. These All Stars 5 queens, same thing. They're going to be in the limelight again, especially queens we haven't seen in a long time like Anjaina and Jujubee can tour, but now they can't do that touring.

1991
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:39,200
And so that really sucks. But the virtual streams is a way to do it. I would be curious if they're making nearly as much money on a virtual stream as they were doing in tips.

1992
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:50,200
But something's better than nothing, I suppose. So anyway, sorry to deviate a little much there, but I thought that was a good question.

1993
02:13:51,200 --> 02:14:00,200
Hype Mayhem says, do we need a Bayonetta 3 at this point? Hell yes, we do. Of course we do. I love Bayonetta. I really want to see a third game. That'd be awesome.

1994
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:02,200
Any other stories, Loki?

1995
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:15,200
Um, yeah, so I was going to mention also that we also got a video this week of some more stuff for Lego Super Mario. So they showed that they're going to have different power ups for it as well. So they have the cat Mario.

1996
02:14:16,200 --> 02:14:28,200
Um, they have that hammer brother Mario and then the fire flower Mario as well. So they're going to sell those add ons as well. August 1st when that comes out. So that was kind of neat.

1997
02:14:29,200 --> 02:14:36,200
Uh, yeah, it looks awesome. The other thing I saw too, was that the announcement that a Final Fantasy 14 starter edition went free on PlayStation 4.

1998
02:14:37,200 --> 02:14:39,200
I heard about that. What a great time to jump in.

1999
02:14:41,200 --> 02:14:45,200
Yeah, that's only for a few more days, right?

2000
02:14:45,200 --> 02:14:53,200
Um, yes, I believe it's, uh, let's see here. It is going to be ending, um, May 26th. So yeah, I got a couple more days.

2001
02:14:54,200 --> 02:15:01,200
Yeah. And that is the base Realm Reborn game. So it's none of the expansions because that's where they're going to get your money is if they get you hooked and then you get the expansions.

2002
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:11,200
Uh, and 30 days of time to play for free. So if you've been curious or you want to dip your toe in the water, I mean, now's a great fricking time, but there, there's a reason for it.

2003
02:15:11,200 --> 02:15:20,200
They have a plan to get money out of you, but I, you know, I talk about Final Fantasy 14 a lot on this show. I love it as an MMO. It's, it's, it's worth a look in my opinion.

2004
02:15:21,200 --> 02:15:28,200
Um, but I, I understand the cost can put people off, but here's a way to, to take, take a look in the door free for 30 days at least.

2005
02:15:29,200 --> 02:15:42,200
Mm hmm. Um, what do you, I forgot to mention that's coming out this week in the U S is pong quest. That was something else that's coming out. Remember that, that pong game that was, uh, like an, like an adventure type stuff.

2006
02:15:43,200 --> 02:15:52,200
And they have all the callbacks to different classic Atari games in there. So that's, I totally forgot. That was the thing I, now that you're mentioning, I'm like, yeah, I think there was a story on that a while back. Well, that's cool.

2007
02:15:53,200 --> 02:15:54,200
See, see if that is fun.

2008
02:15:55,200 --> 02:16:09,200
So yeah, that's pretty much it. All right. Well, uh, I guess that's going to do it for another. Oh really? Oh, sorry. Late breaking news. And this is important. SSJ 100. Matt says, uh, it sounds like team ketchup may have won splat fest.

2009
02:16:09,200 --> 02:16:23,200
I'm so glad splatoon did a do over on that whole thing. So that the right team could win in that scenario, because I believe mayonnaise won the first time. So I'm very, I'm very glad a justice prevailed on the redo.

2010
02:16:26,200 --> 02:16:36,200
All right. Anyhow, uh, that's going to do it for another, uh, episode of orange launch radio. Thank you guys so much for tuning in and participating with our show, whether it was live here or not.

2011
02:16:36,200 --> 02:16:47,200
Twitch TV slash vog network. Or even if you were listening on the podcast feed, we love you all the same. All we ask here at orange launch radio, tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2012
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:59,200
But if the voices aren't here to put out over the arrow and can't, can't put your voices up. So, uh, tell a friend or two about the show auto hosts on Twitch. Even if you don't like to stream yourself, they still go a very long way.

2013
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:10,200
It's a great way to like, tell your friends. So host vog network, uh, super appreciate that. And, um, yeah, a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever you found this show goes an awful long way. So thank you again to everybody.

2014
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:18,200
And, uh, hope you guys, especially on the Twitch side, I know the podcast didn't see a lot of changes this week, but on the Twitch side, I hope you guys enjoyed the webcams.

2015
02:17:18,200 --> 02:17:47,200
Well, this week was about getting them added next week. It will look better. I'll have more time to play with it and set up the different shots. Now that I know like what the limitations are. Uh, so next week we'll hopefully look a little better on that front and we can get used to this for, cause it's going to be at least, I mean, I don't know. I, yeah, I don't know. I, I, I, I feel uncomfortable even putting a date out there. We'll be back together when we can be back together. But until then we'll do this.

2016
02:17:48,200 --> 02:17:55,200
So, all right. Um, that's it. I think it's about time to get a final thoughts. Uh, Loki, you want to start your final thoughts tonight?

2017
02:17:56,200 --> 02:18:07,200
Uh, yeah. My final thought is I'm glad that we've got tomorrow off for Memorial day. And also we, we have to wish, uh, Rama a happy birthday. His birthday's today.

2018
02:18:08,200 --> 02:18:21,200
I forgot it was today. Happy birthday, Rama. Oh my gosh. I know so many like late may babies. Yeah. Happy birthday, Rama. Uh, Shane from the who's on the show all the time. His was yesterday. So happy late birthday.

2019
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:34,200
Yeah. So lots of, lots of late May. And then my friend Amanda's right around this time too. My old roommate. Yeah. Lots of late May people. I know. So yeah. Happy birthday to all you late May's folks out there. Um, that's it. That's going to do it for us this week.

2020
02:18:34,200 --> 02:18:51,200
We'll be back. Oh, my, my final thought quickly. Um, I need to play my turbo graphics mini already. Now that I'm done with LARP stuff, I can do it. And, um, I downloaded and played the tutorial and I'm going to play a little more immortal combat Excel.

2021
02:18:52,200 --> 02:19:03,200
I did do that this week and I didn't talk about it in my gaming week cause I only did the tutorial, but so we played that. Um, we, we, we're going to do some co-op on a Minecraft dungeons later this week.

2022
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:19,200
Hell yeah. I can't wait to play Minecraft dungeons. Hell yeah. I want to play that for sure. I hear it's short. There's so much stuff this week. There's Minecraft dungeons, PSO2, uh, Xenoblade Chronicles. Like this is a great week for gaming despite this crappy world situation.

2023
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:29,200
So, um, enjoy it guys. Have a great time gaming this week. So, all right, we'll see you in seven days to talk all about it. All right. Have a great week, everybody. Good night.
