0	18240	This week, the Internet is outraged on behalf of a talented 9-year-old Fortnite player.
18240	21200	Also this week, the Internet learns about the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
21200	23140	and more importantly, its exceptions.
23140	25800	This is just one headline in the week's news, stay tuned for the rest, starting right now
25800	32800	on the show where every gamer has a voice.
32800	36440	Hello my friends out there on the Internet, welcome back to another week of the show where
36440	37920	every gamer has a voice.
37920	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 819 for this May 10th, 2020.
45000	49280	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm all alone here in the studio, although we would usually all
49280	51240	be here in the same room taping.
51240	54440	As you know, there's a lot of things going on in the world right now that are preventing
54440	55440	that.
55440	56880	A big thanks to the Magic of Discord.
56880	58160	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
58160	59160	Hello.
59160	60160	Hi, Loki.
60160	61360	How are you doing?
61360	62360	I'm fine.
62360	63360	Good, good.
63360	68560	Did you do anything special for Mother's Day for like your wife or your own mom or anything
68560	69560	like that?
69560	73120	I bought her a cake yesterday and then I cooked dinner today.
73120	74560	Oh, well, there you go.
74560	75560	That's very good of you.
75560	77400	I think I saw the picture on Facebook.
77400	78400	Was that today or yesterday?
78400	79400	It was today.
79400	80400	Oh, that looked good.
80400	84680	It was like you did like fried chicken or something, but in the air fryer, right?
84920	89400	Yeah, it's air fryer, honey butter wings.
89400	92040	Oh, you're infamous honey butter, right?
92040	93040	Yes.
93040	94040	Yes.
94040	95040	All right.
95040	96040	Awesome.
96040	98400	I'll come back and talk more about food with you in just a minute.
98400	101880	Not joining us tonight, unfortunately, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
101880	105280	I do want to quickly let you guys know what's going on.
105280	109840	So last week's show got a little bit weird because Jamie had to leave partway through
109840	111360	the show.
111360	115560	What happened, guys, is that Dark Sakura got word halfway, or not even halfway, probably
115560	122960	like a quarter pounder of the way into the show last week, Dark Sakura got a phone call
122960	129360	that her dad had been admitted into the hospital and was in the emergency area being tested
129360	130360	and so forth.
130360	133480	Unfortunately, I don't have great news to report.
133480	139000	Her father passed away this week and so as you can imagine, she's taking some time off
139000	144720	tonight to handle things and decompress with everything going on.
144720	148980	So obviously we're sending our best wishes and so forth to Dark Sakura.
148980	153120	It's definitely not an easy thing to be going through, especially with everything else that's
153120	155480	going on in the world.
155480	159200	So yeah, I did get her permission to tell you all that, that that had happened.
159200	163120	I think it would be okay for me to as well tell you it was not COVID related because
163120	164120	I think that's good.
164120	168440	I think just in this day and age, that is going to be a curiosity that happens, although
168440	170820	that was a scare.
170820	176260	Anytime you're in the hospital and you're showing certain symptoms, that is something
176260	181880	that they're looking at, but I felt it appropriate to say it's not that, but I will let Dark
181880	183240	Sakura give more details.
183240	188000	If she wants to, which she's under no obligation to do, when she returns to the show, be it
188000	192220	next week, the week after, however much time she needs.
192220	198020	So I know it's a tremendously difficult thing to go through with losing a parent.
198020	203980	So yeah, I'm just thinking of her and I'm sure we all are in chat and so forth right
203980	204980	now.
204980	210140	So yeah, I just wanted to let you know why last week's show got a little weird there
210140	217260	in the middle and why Jamie's not here tonight and we'll come back whenever she pleases.
217260	222980	So moving on, because we do try to do this show to take our minds off of all the craziness
222980	228940	going on in the real world, be it personal tragedy or the tragedy that is seemingly surrounding
228940	232300	us in the globe every day with what's going on in the world.
232300	238460	I know a lot of us run to our Animal Crossing towns to escape what's going on.
238460	239460	I don't blame you.
239460	241260	I'm very similar in this day and age.
241260	246040	So with that being said, let's use video games as an escape for a little bit.
246040	250040	Let's talk about some big gaming news and some things to look forward to amongst all
250040	255720	this this year, starting with our kickoff tonight, talking about the Xbox Series X event.
255720	262160	So Loki, last week on the show, we set some, I guess, not so great expectations for the
262160	263160	event.
263160	264160	Yeah.
264160	269560	So, well, you know, and why the summer of gaming is stretched out for four months because
269560	271640	they're stretching out the news for four months.
271640	272980	Well, here's the thing, too.
272980	277400	And I don't know if it was said before we had taped last week or after that it was going
277400	279660	to be all third party.
279660	283420	Sorry, we missed the memo and didn't get to relay that during the show.
283420	285660	So, you know, if that was before the show, then our bad.
285660	286660	We missed it.
286660	289340	There's a lot of information about the event going around.
289340	294660	And so but I do think we'd also said, you know, set your expectations at a reasonable
294660	295660	level.
295660	296660	It's May.
296660	299440	So like, you know, I'm going to be completely honest.
299440	304800	I kind of clicked through the event because I forgot it was at 8 a.m.
304800	308480	Usually these types of things are at like noon my time because being on the West Coast,
308480	312980	I can usually, you know, I don't have to worry about like sleeping right through it or something.
312980	319600	So I was distracted with day job work stuff and I had no idea, none, that it had even
319600	321780	happened until it was already over.
321780	324120	So I kind of ended up going like clicking through it.
324120	325120	And that that was the point.
325120	331080	I kind of heard, well, it was kind of just a bunch of third party trailers.
331080	332080	Did you watch it, Loki?
332080	333760	Was that what you walked away with?
333760	335300	I did watch it.
335300	337660	And there was some interesting things there.
337660	342000	But like the I mean, they came out first.
342000	346840	They said, OK, you know, we've heard the Internet, you guys giving us a hard time about gameplay
346840	347840	trailers.
347840	350960	Well, we tell we're telling you now they're gameplay trailers.
350960	352940	And then they show what your trailers are gameplay.
352940	357620	So it's like, guys, what are you doing?
357620	360100	So they had some interesting things.
360100	366200	I mean, I really enjoyed like some of the trailers they had for what was it?
366200	370140	That one medium that looked pretty awesome.
370140	375020	The game, the medium, which basically looked like a spiritual successor to Silent Hill
375020	378320	by the folks that I was like, is that even the one that the kiriyama is like actually
378320	379320	involved with?
379320	380320	Yes, he is.
380320	386520	Silent Hill, like I hear a kiriyama is the silent hill.
386520	390980	So that one is by the makers of the Blair Witch and the Observer.
390980	393520	So Blair Witch is pretty good.
393520	399700	And then there was Scorn, which I have no idea what that was.
399700	403720	Some horror game looks like, you know, was H.R.
403720	405680	Geiger or something like that.
405680	406920	And that looked kind of weird.
406920	407920	Maybe that's chorus.
407920	408920	I don't know.
408920	414100	There's a lot of these games that were kind of similar overall.
414100	417580	I thought it was pretty good.
417580	422260	Didn't really care so much about Madden stuff, but whatever.
422260	426420	And then, of course, Assassin's Creed, I was really hoping to see some actual gameplay,
426420	431100	but of course not.
431100	433300	I don't know the new Yakuza game.
433300	437280	I guess I got to get into the Yakuza series because it looked pretty awesome.
437280	438280	Like a dragon.
438280	439280	Yeah.
439280	442420	And just quickly about the gameplay, because that seemed to be the recurring theme from
442420	443420	a lot of people.
443420	446240	And you kind of hit on that, you know, with what you said earlier, that most people were
446240	450100	hoping like this is going to be the chance to see some gameplay.
450100	453000	And it really like wasn't gameplay like, OK, sure.
453000	456620	There might have been like three seconds of gameplay in engine footage, whatever.
456620	457620	OK, like.
457620	458620	Yeah.
458620	459620	Right.
459620	463100	And it was really it was funny because Bobby went into this on his show tonight because
463100	465140	I haven't given this line out yet during the show.
465140	468700	We do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the
468700	473400	voice of Geeks Network, Twitch dot excuse me, have the hiccups, twitch dot TV slash
473400	477460	Vogue Network at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black
477460	478460	Wolf show.
478460	480560	And Bobby on his show tonight was talking about this.
480560	482720	And I thought it was funny because he kind of went through some of the footage and he
482720	486140	actually like blew up the little disclaimer that was at the bottom of the screen that
486140	489800	kind of talks about how, you know, it's very typical, you know, what you see in trailers.
489800	491640	Like, you know, the game footage is not final.
491640	496420	It's, you know, all, you know, prior what they expect it to look like and all this stuff.
496420	501280	So it's it was kind of rendered preview things.
501280	505480	It just didn't look like people were actually playing these games.
505480	508740	You know, it just looked like, oh, they're they're either rendering these cinematics
508740	512340	and in engine or there's a lot of shooty shooty bang bang.
512340	516100	But it's very scripted and reacting a lot faster than a person actually playing it would
516100	518620	be doing and so forth.
518620	524400	But, you know, considering that the line is getting more and more blurred and there was
524400	525400	an interesting take.
525400	530260	I was reading online about this, about how, you know, part of the reason why maybe we're
530260	534940	not feeling it so much with, you know, what we saw this week is that, you know, when the
534940	540220	graphics went up from Nintendo to Super Nintendo, huge jump when they went up from Super Nintendo
540220	544260	to the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation era, the first 3D era.
544260	545260	That was huge.
545260	547080	It was a huge jump in graphics, right?
547080	548900	Like, oh, my God, 3D, right?
548900	552880	And then going from the PlayStation one of the PlayStation two, that was a huge upgrade,
552880	556360	you know, DVD and all the extra stuff that could be stored with that PlayStation two
556360	557400	to PlayStation three.
557400	563400	That was a pretty big jump, three to four, a minor jump, not as big of a jump, but still
563400	564400	a noticeable jump.
564400	565400	Right.
565400	571080	You know, more HD stuff and more is 60 frames a second and things like that.
571080	573580	OK, so you notice every now they're going from four to five.
573580	577980	It's almost like we're pushing the limits of what our eyes can actually see, that it's
577980	581500	just like that graphical improvement isn't there.
581500	587100	So it's almost like we need to know what are the other bells and whistles.
587100	589440	Because the graphics aren't doing it anymore.
589440	595060	And I think that's why this particular reveal event was a struggle, because it's harder
595060	596540	to ooh and aah at the graphics.
596540	598180	I mean, yes, it looks good.
598180	603100	I thought it was, yeah, the graphics were fine, but like there's I just wanted to see
603100	608140	more like gameplay, like what these games are, because there's some like I don't even
608140	611260	know what what this game is like.
611260	614660	It's hard for me to understand what exactly it is that I'm going to be playing, whereas
614660	618720	like some of them, like the Yakuza stuff, at least that I have a pretty good idea.
618720	621900	And I know that like, OK, those cutscenes are actually in game and stuff.
621900	623620	But like, I don't know.
623620	628340	And just the fact that, you know, OK, I don't think this was a bomb or, you know, horrible.
628340	630580	Like it was not like the Xbox one reveal.
630580	632740	OK, that was a disaster.
632740	634700	This was this wasn't a disaster.
634700	641700	This was just kind of like, OK, or maybe or like maybe an overall meh, but with a couple
641700	643220	minutes of oh, neat.
643220	646700	For example, the Xbox is getting a new Yakuza game.
646700	647700	Oh, neat.
647700	648900	You know, that was OK.
648900	653300	So that's kind of neat, you know, or oh, the Silent Hill folks are working on a new game
653300	654300	for Xbox.
654300	655300	Oh, OK, neat.
655300	658560	You know, but we just didn't really get to see the gameplay, but at least it did have
658560	662520	those few moments of, oh, neat, right?
662520	668040	But I think when the first party reveal happens and we start to do the real deep dive into
668040	671840	this new Xbox Series X, I think that's when it's going to have to be a little more than
671840	673040	just, oh, neat.
673040	675320	It's going to have to be, oh, I want that.
675320	676320	I'm going to preorder that.
676320	678320	You know what I mean?
678320	679320	Yeah, definitely.
679320	683520	I mean, there's some games, you know, that were like, oh, that's pretty cool.
683520	687840	So far, like then, of course, they said, OK, well, we're going to have another event later
687840	688840	on in July.
688840	695880	And it's like, fine, I guess, just wait for all that stuff in July.
695880	700720	I'm trying to find some comments from our chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.
700720	707960	Bonds 006 says HDR 2 and 4K, bleeding edge graphics is OK, but gameplay is better.
707960	711640	Something else to consider with 4K, too, is just how many games are we actually going
711640	712640	to see with it?
712640	716800	Because 4K is going to be a beast for those artists to make those types of textures.
716800	718480	Like there's there's a limit.
718520	721960	I think that that's pretty typical nowadays in the PC space.
721960	724560	So I think everyone's kind of used to it already.
724560	728160	And one of the things I did like, though, was they were talking about that smart delivery.
728160	735280	So that's that thing where if you buy, say, you know, Census Creed Valhalla on Xbox One,
735280	738400	you also get the free upgrade to the Series X.
738400	739760	And vice versa.
739760	741580	Honestly, that's exciting.
741580	745920	And I think it's one of those things where now like backwards compatibility becomes almost
745920	748960	more important when trying to sell your new console.
748960	751960	And I think that's why Sony is much more on board with it this time.
751960	755480	And, you know, Microsoft's definitely making it a piece of what they're saying, too.
755480	759880	But there's also a lot of people out there that are like, I don't think I really need
759880	764560	an Xbox Series X because I'm going to play all these games on PC.
764560	768120	Is that really a loss for Microsoft?
768120	769240	I don't think so.
769240	771800	I don't know if all these games will be on PC.
771800	775480	I mean, a lot of them will be, but well, it's hard to everything is going to be the third
775480	776480	party stuff.
776480	777480	It's hard to say.
777480	778480	Fair.
778480	781640	But we know the first party Microsoft stuff all will be like they've said that as much
781640	783120	like Halo is going to be on PC.
783120	784720	They're all going to be on PC.
784720	790960	So you know, I think it just depends on what the specs are to get in the run the way that
790960	796000	they do, because like, I mean, I have a pretty new laptop, so I'm hoping that that stuff
796000	797480	should run really well.
797480	800200	But I mean, eventually at some point it's not.
800200	807560	So I need to see what I need to have it run at the speed that they know it should run
807560	808560	or whatever.
808560	809560	Just.
809560	812200	But yeah, I mean, that that was the thing is like, well, I don't know if I really need
812200	817240	to necessarily buy an Xbox because I can just have a PC.
817240	818240	I don't know.
818240	822200	Maybe the games pass and stuff, you know, the ad.
822200	825160	I mean, that's just that's going to be a big part of it as well.
825160	828840	So you're going to have three generations of systems where they have games for it.
829480	831800	I do think I do think games pass is great.
831800	833000	And I've said that on the show before.
833000	837400	I think the one place the game pass could improve is that they do have such a robust
837400	842520	library of Xbox 360 and original Xbox games that could be on that service, but for whatever
842520	847720	reason aren't and especially first party Microsoft titles, you know, so maybe they're just drip
847720	848200	feeding it.
848200	849320	Maybe we'll see more.
849320	849800	I don't know.
849800	852840	But, you know, Xbox game pass, I think I'm a big fan of that.
852840	857560	And to see what how that's going to impact, you know, the next generation of Xbox, I want
857560	859240	to get some more comments from chat.
859240	865000	Bonds 006 says graphic porn does not make up for a lackluster game design, bland gameplay,
865000	866040	shoddy AI.
866040	870840	And yeah, this this trailer binge that we got, we couldn't really see any of that other
870840	871240	stuff.
871240	875480	Not that, you know, events are really going to clue you in if the game has shoddy AI or
875480	875880	not.
875880	879080	But still, I think a lot of us like to see the gameplay to see what's it really going
879080	880520	to look like when we get our hands on it.
881160	885800	Fifth Dream Today says the fast loading, the smaller download sizes, the 3D sound chip.
885800	887240	I'm already sold.
887320	888840	So very true.
890600	891080	Let's see.
891640	893480	Johnny Woofay talking about ray tracing.
893480	897160	New killer instinct with ray tracing would be amazing.
897160	901480	So yeah, ray tracing, obviously a big part of the next generation of gaming.
901480	904680	And I know my current PC, my current video card can't really handle it.
904680	907400	So, you know, that may be something I'll have to go to.
907400	911800	Either I got to improve my video card or I'll have to go to an Xbox Series X to experience
911800	912200	that.
912200	913160	We'll see what happens.
914920	917000	You know, something else this event kind of made me think of, you know,
917000	923240	again, guys, it's May, you know, and usually this type of binge doesn't start till June.
923240	927080	And with everything going on in the world, I don't think many of us would be surprised
927080	929160	if it's delayed a little bit past early June.
929160	934120	The E3, I'm using my quoting fingers, time frame that we would usually see these events
934120	934600	in.
934600	940680	But, you know, let's imagine, as I'm sure many of you have been doing these past few
940680	944280	months, let's imagine COVID, Corona had never happened.
944280	946680	Let's imagine this whole pandemic never happened.
947000	948840	I know, it's hard to do.
950200	952200	And then we had E3 like usual.
952840	957640	I think you would see Microsoft coming out on stage and, you know, talking about their
957640	958040	new system.
958040	962200	They're only going to have an hour and a half or two hours and they've got to fit in, you
962200	966280	know, their system and all the reasons why you should upgrade to the new system as well
966280	969800	as announcing their own games and games you should be looking forward to.
970360	976040	I think a lot of this stuff we saw in the inside Xbox would have been relegated to that
976040	978440	third party sizzle wheel, right?
978440	979880	Y'all know what I'm talking about, right?
979880	981560	Yeah, the sizzle reel.
981560	985320	I mean, a lot of them like see a lot of the games are like, oh, is this this?
985320	986600	Because I thought it was something else.
986600	990360	Like, for example, Vampire the Masquerade originally when they were showing that I was
990360	993960	like, oh, is this Bioshock in a new Bioshock?
993960	996040	And it's like, oh, no, it's Vampire, which is fine.
996040	997480	I mean, I guess that game is pretty good.
997480	1003000	And that's not to say they won't show third party games still at the big event, whatever,
1003000	1004440	you know, the virtual event they end up doing.
1004520	1006920	That's not to say they won't, like, if there is a new Bioshock, that's not to say they
1006920	1007800	won't show that.
1007800	1011720	But I think these particular games that got shown were probably the things that would
1011720	1013800	have been relegated to the sizzle reel.
1013800	1019080	And now it's a little bit of a win-win situation when that they get that time back that would
1019080	1020760	have gone to the sizzle reel, right?
1020760	1022920	So we can see something else at the show.
1022920	1025880	And B, you didn't just get a sizzle reel.
1025880	1031000	You got much more content from these third parties and you got, you know, to see more
1031000	1035000	of, you know, these games for better or for worse with the rendered trailers and so forth.
1035000	1039160	So I just I think this was the supersized sizzle trailer.
1039160	1043240	I just think that they should be really careful with what they're calling gameplay.
1043240	1049480	Like if it's in engine footage or something like that, that's fine, because especially
1049480	1055240	Ubisoft, I mean, we're talking about not just a few years ago, we had the whole debacle
1055240	1061320	over Watch Dogs where they showed stuff that ended up being, you know, downgraded when
1061320	1065960	the full retail version came out or Aliens Colonial Marines, you know, remember that
1065960	1070600	whole thing where none of the footage even resembled the final game when it came out.
1070600	1074440	So it's it's we need to be very careful with that.
1074440	1078200	A lot of people in chat and I know it came up on Bobby show as well, not to rehash things
1078200	1083800	too much, but the Killzone PS3 debacle and how the target rendered footage that they
1083800	1086840	showed at the event didn't even match what ended up happening.
1086840	1089000	That's been talked about quite a bit tonight.
1089000	1094680	And I get it. It's still early, but don't don't one, call it a gameplay trailer and
1094680	1100120	two, don't have another like a brief moment before all the trailers say, hey, we get it,
1100120	1103720	you guys, you know, you come down on us when we call this stuff gameplay and it's not.
1103720	1107960	But we promise you it's gameplay like don't have that before all of this.
1107960	1112440	If it's not going to be that like, I don't understand why you set yourself up even more.
1112440	1114040	Yeah, that was a weird, weird setup.
1115880	1119640	I mean, I don't know. It's just it's weird. Like without the UI and stuff on there,
1119640	1123800	it's just it doesn't look right. And I get it like there's like cut scenes and stuff like that.
1123800	1131080	They're rendered in game, but. I don't know if it's all cut scenes is kind of ridiculous.
1131080	1135800	OK, this comment is too good. I have to read it. This is about you and that vampire trailer.
1136440	1140600	Bobby Black Wolf says, Q up the is this anime butterfly meme?
1140600	1144360	Loki is the anime boy. Vampire is the butterfly. Is this Bioshock?
1146600	1150600	It's good. It's like it's like when he had like the guy like stringing up the people
1150600	1154600	in the house and stuff like that, I was like, oh, OK, that kind of looks like a splicer or
1154600	1159640	something like that. You've all done it. We've all done it. I'm I'm I'm positive because, you know,
1159640	1165320	if you if you can go back to last year's E3, if you happen to be a subscriber of Vogue Network
1165320	1169400	here at Twitch, Wink, Wink, Nudge, Nudge, you can go back into the video footage and look at
1169400	1173480	everything. And I don't I don't remember if Bobby and I were commentating on like a Microsoft event
1173480	1178040	or it was the Square event. But I know that there was like a trailer that came up and I'm like,
1178040	1180600	oh, this looks like such and such. And it totally wasn't.
1181720	1186520	You know, and that or and then I was like, thought that was a Forza Horizon game. I'm like,
1187320	1193160	I mean, it's heavily inspired by it. You know, it looks it. I don't know.
1193880	1200200	You know, and look, look, I can openly admit it because you all do it with video games, too.
1200200	1204280	And it happens with movie trailers. So it's not it's not just games where this happens.
1204280	1207640	You've totally seen movie trailers and a person will show up and you'll be like,
1207640	1210680	is this the trailer for a new Marvel thing? Oh, no, it's not.
1212680	1216840	It's it's a rip off or something like that. Or is this the new Pixar movie? Oh, no, no,
1216840	1221320	it's not Pixar. It's something like that. Is this the new Iron Man? Oh, that's Dr. Doolittle.
1223720	1230200	Exactly. You've all done it in the movie theater. Come on. So, yeah. But anyway, I again,
1230200	1237320	the event wasn't bad. It just was kind of like, oh, that wasn't really gameplay. All right.
1237320	1244680	So we're really looking forward to your I guess now July event instead. So now it'll be just
1244680	1249400	what's interesting to see through all this, of course, is how is Sony going to play this?
1249400	1253960	Because we still don't know. Does Sony plan to do something in June when E3 would have been?
1253960	1257320	Is Sony going to wait for July? Because as we've talked about on the show before,
1258200	1265080	Microsoft pulled out the switch two months before it released. So hypothetically, if consoles aren't
1265080	1271880	releasing until November, we may not hear anything until September. Nintendo pulled out the switch.
1272600	1279480	They did. They said Microsoft. Oh, God. All right. Sorry. It's been a long, long seven weeks.
1280280	1283960	So, yes, Nintendo pulled out the switch. Sorry. With only like two months to go,
1283960	1287160	because it was like early January. And granted, the holidays come into that and everything.
1287160	1291800	But still, and the switch sold like cuckoo bananas because they had all the right games for it and
1291800	1298680	the right things to say. So you don't need five or six months of lead time. Unless maybe you're
1298680	1305080	trying to collect all those preorders. I don't know. But Nintendo kind of changed the games in
1305080	1309480	many ways with the switch's launch. You don't have to launch a console for the holidays. You
1309480	1314120	don't have to launch a console with six months lead time and you can still be successful. So
1315400	1322280	we'll see. Anyway, I'm still excited for Xbox Series X. I'm sure the July event is going to
1322280	1327960	be great. I'm excited for Sony's event as well. And I'm excited for Nintendo to announce what
1327960	1332680	their plan looks like for the rest of the year. I just really like games. So I just...
1333560	1337640	You ever go on Twitter and look like... And I'm telling you, actually, don't do this.
1338280	1342360	But have you ever made the mistake of going on Twitter and looking at an Xbox tweet and looking
1342360	1348600	at the reply and it's all Sony fanboys saying really mean things? Or you go to a Sony tweet
1348600	1353960	and you look at all the replies and it's Microsoft fanboys saying very mean things. I'm so tired.
1354600	1360120	Y'all, it's 2020 and I'm tired. Like, just stop. Stop fighting.
1360120	1363400	We don't have sports teams to root for right now, so we have to root for the console wars.
1363400	1369640	It's so disturbing. And I know, Rob, don't read the comments. You're right. I should know better.
1369640	1378120	I can't help it. Sometimes you click and... God, I saw it. So anyway. Yeah. And then Bobby says,
1378120	1382600	and you go to a Nintendo tweet and it's all Nintendo fanboys saying mean things.
1382600	1388280	Where is our direct, et cetera? Yeah, no. Tea. It's true. Nintendo kind of fights themselves,
1388280	1393080	don't they? It's been 26 days since a Nintendo Direct. I'm dying.
1395240	1398680	Orange right in chat says, have you ever made the mistake of going on Twitter?
1400120	1406120	You know, there's a lot of good and bad on Twitter. I've had a pretty darn good experience
1406120	1411560	on Twitter. I've met a lot of great people on Twitter. I heavily curate my Twitter experience
1412120	1417560	and I heavily choose who I follow. I have two different layers of followers. I do. Yes,
1417560	1422920	I follow like 1600 people on Twitter. I do. Not nearly that many of them are active. I've also
1422920	1426920	been on Twitter for 10 years and there's a lot of accounts that ain't tweeting anymore. Sure.
1427960	1432600	Here's the thing. I'm going to tell you my steps to how to stay on top of a 1600 follower list.
1432600	1438040	Number one, the minute I follow you, I disable your retweets. Number one,
1438680	1441640	that's just been a policy. Like I'm not interested in retweets.
1441640	1447800	I'm interested. Yeah, we can do that. Oh yeah. You go follow and you click on the dots on a
1447800	1452200	person's profile and you can disable their retweets. And if I see any retweets come in
1452200	1455880	my timeline where it's like, I forgot, because sometimes if somebody has a protected account,
1456600	1459960	you can't do that right away. So if I see a retweet come in my timeline,
1459960	1463560	especially if it's something I really don't care about, I go to your profile and I hide retweets.
1463560	1468760	No, retweets I'm fine with. That's right. It's the likes that I want to stop getting in my team.
1468760	1472120	Yeah, those don't... Well, when you follow as many people as I do...
1472120	1480040	Everybody be thirsty out there and like... It's true. Don't go to the curated timeline
1480040	1483880	because you see a lot more of it there. You have to go to the actual chronological timeline.
1484680	1492760	And then the other Twitter trick is, well, quote tweets you can't really do anything about. And
1492760	1496280	that's the one that's starting to become a pain. But a lot of times the things people say are
1496280	1502440	funny, so okay. But the other very, very important thing is lists. And that's the other thing.
1502440	1509000	So I have an invisible list and you don't know if you're on it or not of about 40-ish people.
1509000	1513000	And that's the one I actually read with regularity and kind of stay current on.
1513800	1518120	And then it's like one of those, if I'm bored or I'm not doing anything right now,
1518120	1521800	I'm doing that whole lying in bed and I really shouldn't be on my phone, but I am.
1521800	1528840	Then I scroll through the big timeline and read all the 1600 thing crap. And then if you're
1528840	1534440	tweeting a bunch of bullshit, I don't want to see, I just mute you. Sorry. But especially...
1534440	1541800	Oh my God, the automated stuff. That's a mute. I feel like Grandpa Simpson. That's a paddling.
1543240	1546920	Every sponsored tweet I see, I blocked the account.
1547880	1552600	You have a robot that says how many people followed you today. That's a mute. You tweet
1552600	1559880	too damn much about politics. That's a mute. You just, the automated tweets are the things that
1559880	1568840	really bother me. That's a mutant. So that's how I see it. That's a mutant. And that's how I stay
1568840	1575400	on top of things. Bobby Blackwell says Rob mutes VOG network confirmed. No, I don't mute our own
1575400	1581960	stuff. And here's the thing with that. At least it's like, and I actually don't mute the people
1581960	1585560	that say I'm going live on Twitch and all that. I don't mute that. That's not what I'm talking
1585560	1591560	about. I'm talking about the one that says I have five new followers today and three people
1591560	1597800	unfollowed me. Thank you so much to dah, dah, dah for whatever website for the stats or thanks
1597800	1603960	at so-and-so for the follow. Thanks at so-and-so like they have a robot thing that tweets every
1603960	1609240	time somebody follows them. That's a mutant. But if somebody, like I follow a lot of other
1609240	1612280	Twitch streamers, let's be real. And if they tweet, hi, I'm going live on Twitch and I'm
1612280	1616680	going to be playing something such and such tonight. Like our, like our pal, Jeff.
1618360	1623080	I follow him. I don't, I don't mute him. He tweets a lot of funny shit too. And I actually really
1623080	1628040	enjoy his clips from Twitch. So I don't mute that, you know? So I don't, no, I do not mute VOG
1628040	1635080	network, but I do mute, especially when like you have no other content. Anyway, one other
1635080	1639320	Twitter trick, I know you're getting burned out on this, but now I'm on a roll. I don't follow
1639320	1646600	everyone back automatically. Most people I do, but here's my trick because there's so many robots
1646600	1652440	out there on Twitter nowadays. I assess your account in five minutes or five seconds to try
1652440	1657160	to figure out if you're a real person or not. And here's my criteria. I go to your page and I click
1657160	1665160	on your media tab. If I see, and I scroll for three seconds. If I see a selfie of you, I know
1665160	1669560	you're a real person and I'll follow you back or some other type of picture that obviously came
1669560	1676200	from a cell phone camera. I follow back. If I see a lot of interaction with accounts and gifts,
1676200	1680600	then I kind of try to feel out, okay, is this content that I'm going to like? Then I'll probably
1680600	1688040	follow back. If it's empty, there's nothing there in your media tab, I don't follow back
1689240	1696520	because that is almost a sure sign of a bot account. So that's, anyway, I'm not perfect
1696520	1700840	a hundred percent of the time. So please don't walk away from this. If you followed me on Twitter
1700840	1704920	and I never followed you back with a tear, why won't Rob Roberts follow me on Twitter?
1705960	1710280	It's not a perfect system and Twitter doesn't always alert me when people follow me. So I
1710280	1715640	miss it sometimes. But anytime somebody asks me or responds to something or likes something
1715640	1718520	and I'm not following them, I usually go and I see they're following me. I'm like,
1718520	1722520	why am I not following this person? And so just like one of my tweets and I'll usually catch it.
1722520	1729480	So anyway, a Tiger Clawed Chat says, good thing Rob at least follows members of the community
1729480	1734760	because we post good content. Yes, I follow people. Quest Buster says, these Twitter tips
1734760	1738840	are gold. You're welcome, I guess. I've been on Twitter a long, long time and I've just kind of
1738840	1744920	picked up that stuff. Tiger Clawed says, I think Travis Donovan's Twitter does that sometimes.
1745960	1751320	There's certain people I will let slide and Grandpa Donovan is one of them. Don't tell him.
1751320	1757720	But even if he uses a robot, I don't have it in my heart to unfollow him. Yeah, Bonds006 says,
1757720	1763880	or too much about 5G, new ways to make money and why you're an expert on blah blah or slimming
1763880	1769320	teas, promotion, Herbalife. Oh yeah, all that shit in your bio especially. Like if it's like,
1769320	1774760	follow my Twitch channel. That's in my bio. I'm not going to disqualify somebody for having that.
1774760	1781160	But if it's kind of like, make more followers, I'll tell you, that's a mutant. All right, anyway,
1782360	1786920	there are Twitter tips with me that you didn't ask for that I went off for 10 minutes about. Sorry,
1786920	1792360	Logie, do you have any hot Twitter tips? No, I apparently need to start doing more things.
1792360	1796520	I don't know. Really, the only thing I do nowadays is I just use the like button to
1797320	1802520	bookmark stuff they go back to later on. That's fair. Usually like, I follow a lot of developers
1802520	1806200	and they post like tutorials on how to do different things. Like, oh, hey, that's interesting.
1806200	1811160	I want to do that. That's interesting. So I'll put it so I can, it pulls up in my likes feed.
1811160	1815800	You know what, though? Like, here's the thing, Logie, is that like, you are so right, though,
1815800	1819960	about the likes and that there's some very thirsty people on Twitter and the type of stuff that goes
1819960	1824760	in the feed. And it actually makes me self conscious about the types of things that I like
1824760	1834520	on Twitter. Because I don't want y'all knowing like, that I that I like some of those thirst
1834520	1840600	stress. I like some of those thoughts. Okay. And I had I had to like, block those people
1840600	1845400	that were appearing to my feed, not necessarily people that are liking those things. I like I like
1845400	1850040	it's like, you just don't want to block a certain type of account. You don't want somebody's,
1850600	1858040	you know, like ass pic showing up in your feed. I understand. Exactly. Because trust me, I follow
1858040	1864600	some very good looking people. And I wish I could like more of your tweets. Please don't take it as
1864600	1870200	a it's just I, I don't want to show the world. What a pervert I am. Okay, so that's why I don't
1870200	1874280	like as many. But once in a while, I can't help it. And I still like a few or it's like, it's a
1874280	1881000	nice selfie. And it's not. It's not actually like thirst content. I like the G rated stuff. That's
1881000	1889240	fine. So anyway, bonds 006 says thank you, Rob. I do not tell Facebook or Instagram my likes and
1889240	1896120	such music food places I've lived school, etc. Oh, for sure. Um, like all that stuff. When you
1896120	1900200	check in at locations, you're just opening yourself to getting ads for similar things.
1900840	1907320	For sure. Absolutely. And like, I don't I don't know what it is. Loki, do you get this problem
1907320	1916440	on on Facebook? Every other ad I see on Facebook is some new startup men's underwear company
1916440	1922200	of some sort. And I'm like, Hey, listen to you. I swear to God I do because we'll say things
1922200	1927320	that like all of a sudden they'll start, you know, showing that I haven't searched any of this.
1927320	1932440	Not a topic I often talk about out loud or anything like that. I'm like, did it? Did I
1932440	1936760	did it track an Amazon purchase I made before I went on that cruise or something? Like,
1936760	1943800	why am I seeing it could have nothing once like that. I like view like there was an ad I saw for
1943800	1948040	this. I don't even know. It looks like this wearable subwoofer thing or something that
1948040	1951960	they're talking about, like for immersion for like VR or something like that. And I watched the ad
1951960	1956920	and I'm like, man, that looks stupid. And now almost like every time I watch a video on my phone,
1957400	1961960	it's that same ad over and over and over. I'm like, dude, I don't want to look at this. I'm
1961960	1967640	not interested in it. I looked at the ad and it's like, whatever. Or I'll get recommendations all
1967640	1975240	the time. Like if, you know, I buy something that they're like, hey, do you want that again? Hey,
1975240	1979480	do you want this thing that's exactly the same thing that you did? Like, it's like,
1979480	1985880	I don't need another laptop. I don't need a tablet. I don't need this pixel. You're just
1985880	1990040	advertising wrong. Pixel pockets. And Chad is asking underwear startups. I meaning like
1990040	1993480	companies you've never heard of. Like everybody knows like Calvin Klein or Fruit of the Loom or
1993480	1997400	things like that. Everybody knows that these are companies like that. I never heard of except on
1997400	2002600	Facebook ads. Uh, and SSJ, Matt and 100. Matt says, I will say redacted because I'm not given
2002600	2007320	a free exposure, um, are fantastic. Well, thank you as to show on her map by typing that name
2007320	2012600	and chat where now I'll damn to see their ads for the next year. I'm just, I'm just giving you
2012600	2019640	our time, but I think that's kind of like how they pick it up. That stuff and pixel pockets
2019640	2026520	just said the same thing. Y'all are giving free ads. Now, tiger claw, uh, says I see stuff like
2026520	2030840	that all the time and I can deal with it. It's nothing for me to get mad about. I just let it
2030840	2035080	fly because I'm good at concentrating on what I want to see. You're right. Like it doesn't
2035080	2040920	bother me. I'm just, I'm more the type where I'm like, what did I do to generate this algorithm?
2041480	2045720	That's what I want to know. Like, is it just, is it just showing it to me? Cause I'm a gay man.
2045720	2049480	Cause that's, that's my primary theory, but I guess, I guess not cause that's what you want
2049480	2055960	under Matt. I know is not, and is seeing those ads too. So maybe a lot of these companies advertise
2055960	2059720	on podcasts and stuff too. So I think they just, they just go everywhere. I'm sure. So
2060360	2065560	anyway, all right. Enough tangents. I'm sorry. Dark soccer is not here tonight to keep me in
2065560	2070680	line. All right. Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks. Take it back to video games. Loki,
2071320	2076280	how was your game week? So I play a few things this week. I went ahead and played through
2077000	2083080	earth defense force, iron rain. So I finished the campaign on that, which unlocked like
2083080	2090280	nightmare mode and I'm like, no, no, I'm not going to play that because then I had to play the whole
2090280	2094840	thing again. And the last mission like took like 30 minutes just to kill the stupid boss. And
2095480	2102840	no, that's it. We got through the story and it was okay. So yeah, so I finished that game.
2103720	2107960	Guts and glory, that game. That's kind of like happy wheels. So I finished that as well
2107960	2115400	and played through all the tracks on that and didn't really feel interested enough to play
2115400	2122760	the user made tracks because those looked like hot garbage. And so I'm just not going to do that.
2122760	2130760	Um, I played a bit of a step mania today. Uh, and that was pretty fun. Hey, quick side note. Sorry.
2130760	2134360	I'm a tangent. But since you brought up step mania, that makes me think of step maniacs,
2134360	2138440	right? The Kyle, the Kyle ward and his company, the dance game. Have you been kind of keeping
2138440	2143160	track on like, um, like their monthly releases? Like they keep injecting new songs every month
2143160	2148680	into the game. Have you seen that? It's pretty cool. My Twitter feed. Yeah, I saw that a lot.
2149480	2155160	I've only played the game once the past couple months. It's been like half songs that many of
2155160	2160920	us knew through dance, dance revolution. Like, um, yeah, things like, uh, and I'm sorry, things like,
2160920	2164360	and I'm sorry, cause I don't, I don't have the list in front of me, but I think I saw like bumblebee
2164360	2169640	by papaya was in there. Uh, walk a lock. I want to say it was in one of them. Uh, and it's,
2169640	2174920	it's songs that you, you probably found through DDR first are now in this game. And it's interesting
2174920	2178520	cause they're mixing. It's not just those games. It's like, you'll see one of those songs. You'll
2178520	2181880	see, Oh, a new song from that maybe you hadn't heard before. And then another one. And then
2181880	2187240	another one that kind of sounds like that Euro DDR sound, but it's not an actual song that was
2187240	2191000	in the game before, but it's like from that same family. So it's an interesting mix. I'm sorry. I
2191000	2194280	just, I wanted to give that a shout out and acknowledgement. Cause I thought it was like,
2194280	2198040	that's kind of neat that they're supporting it every month. And it's kind of like a little
2198040	2204440	mix of old and new. That's pretty interesting. Yeah. It was, it was like I said, I played it
2204440	2209720	one time when we went to check out, there was a, a bowling alley in Rockland that has a pretty
2209720	2213000	decent size arcade with all these different music games in there. They have that game.
2213560	2219240	They do have that game. I want to go check it out, except everything's closed. Yeah. Unfortunately.
2219240	2227160	So, um, uh, I could not, my brain could not handle, uh, doing DDR with a center, um,
2227160	2236440	a center arrow or centers, uh, step place. Uh, I can do pump it up. Okay. But DDR, just my brain's
2236440	2242040	not wired to do that. You have to tune down the difficulty to allow yourself to get accustomed to
2242040	2245400	it. Like you just, you're not going to be able to jump right in and do an expert level song
2245960	2249880	until you get accustomed to it. They want you to play it a little bit like pump to where you have
2249880	2255720	to hit like, like three steps at a time, which you can do by like putting your foot in between them.
2255720	2259800	Um, and so I'm just not really accustomed to that, which is why it was hard for me to do it.
2259800	2263320	And I couldn't find out how to turn it off and options, or at least I didn't, couldn't figure
2263320	2268440	out how to get to options, maybe. Yeah. Plus a lot of the hardest level songs are designed for
2268440	2274440	people to hold the bar and do the foot flying thing, which is not, you know, and I'm not here
2274440	2279960	to start that debate. Okay. I'm not here to start the debate, but all I'm going to say is in my time
2280040	2286600	playing DDR, that was something we really just never did. Like, and I, I, again, I'm not trying
2286600	2292920	to start a war here. Okay. I respect everybody's opinion. I'm too old to dance anymore period.
2292920	2299480	So I don't have an opinion on this topic anymore, but, um, because of that, like, I, I cannot get
2299480	2306120	used to trying to hold the bar to do these harder songs. Like it's just, it's really awkward. Yeah.
2306120	2311080	And you know, getting older doesn't help. So, yeah. So yeah, it's really awkward. I've tried
2311080	2317400	doing that before, like on max 300 or something like that. And I just, I can't do it that way.
2317400	2321320	It doesn't, I can't play that way or like seeing people play doubles and stuff like that. I,
2321320	2327080	I just can't do it. My fear long enough, I guess. Um, and then the last thing I think I played,
2327080	2333720	Oh, uh, Orna played more Orna. Um, so like up to one 70, I'm still trying to grind through stuff
2333720	2341880	there. And let's see what else. Um, I did play this one game called one dreamer, uh, prologue.
2341880	2349640	So it's, they put out a kind of a little demo taste of the game. And so one dreamer is this
2349640	2355800	like pixel art point and click game, uh, where you hack things. So it takes place in this like
2355800	2362760	virtual VR world or whatever. And you have to kind of pack stuff to progress through the game,
2362760	2367800	which is pretty cool. So there's like, almost like coding, but it's not exactly coding or
2367800	2374120	anything. It's just kind of replacing values. And it's about this, these two kids that are,
2375240	2381640	um, inspired by one, like this developer of this big, massive VR game, almost like kind of like,
2381640	2388760	uh, the whole Oasis stuff and, uh, ready player one. So they're inspired by him to,
2389640	2396600	uh, create their own game. And then it's, there's some story along with the developer on why he
2396600	2401240	quit and got burnt out and like some other stuff. So it's, it kind of hints at some things,
2401240	2406840	but it's a beautiful game. Like really worth checking out. The prologue is free on steam to
2406840	2412120	play the, the full game is not out yet, but yeah, go check it out. One dream or prologue, um, is the
2412120	2416520	game you want to look for. And it's just great. It's, it's very short, probably about, you know,
2417080	2424760	an hour, but it's definitely worth playing. All right. That it, that it. All right. Then
2424760	2429560	let me talk about my gaming week. Um, so since Jamie's not here, I will talk about animal
2429560	2435640	crossing, which I am still playing. Uh, got my turnips today. Um, and, uh, all that good stuff,
2435640	2441320	but the big development in animal crossing world is Alan got his switch on. He got it a little
2441320	2445000	early. He was supposed to get it on Saturday, but I think Best Buy had it on like Thursday.
2445000	2450440	So he got his coral switch light. And so he just started playing animal crossing. And so maybe it
2450440	2455640	was Friday because he's, he hasn't even unlocked. His museum is under construction today. So I think
2455640	2460520	that's like day three. I don't know. I lost count, but anyway, he is starting animal crossing. So
2460520	2465000	it's all, it's kind of interesting because Bobby on his show tonight talked about, he kind of like
2465000	2470040	has hit a wall with animal crossing a little bit for me. I think I was getting close to that wall,
2470040	2474680	but now that Alan has just started animal crossing, it's almost like, Oh, I feel
2474680	2479320	reinvigorated because I want to help Alan and I want to see his town grow and all this stuff.
2479320	2483960	But what's really funny about it is that because Alan is like the new kid on the block with his
2483960	2489800	new switch. And, um, you know, we, we have several friends, including like Jamie, including,
2489800	2493000	you know, some of our gaming friends in Chicago and other people on Twitter and stuff.
2493560	2500680	Everybody wants to help Alan. So like the first day he opened his Island, everybody was taking
2500680	2507160	their duplicate patterns, their hybrid, hybrid flowers, their extra furniture. And like Alan
2507160	2513000	is at a point where he looks like a hoarder's house because there is just furniture strewn
2513000	2517720	all over the lawn and DIY patterns surrounding the store because he can't, he doesn't have the
2517720	2522680	storage for everything. Cause he can't upgrade his house fast enough to get the storage.
2522760	2528120	Yeah. I, I need to play that game. I, so I would technically be loud than you kill. I'm not even
2528120	2534920	on the block yet. So I would need to play that. So just giving up on it. Just be careful. Tiger
2534920	2539080	class said he should post the friend court on the discord. It is on his social media.
2539080	2543320	If you know his Twitter account, which isn't too hard to find, he did post it on there for what
2543320	2548680	it's worth. Um, yeah, I need to add him. I haven't got a chance to actually get possession of my
2548680	2553000	switch to be able to do that. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. So, uh, yeah, that's just kind of
2553000	2556840	the funny thing I've kind of been watching him go through is that everybody is just dumping their
2556840	2560520	shit on his lawn and everybody's trying to be helpful. Like nobody's doing anything wrong,
2560520	2564440	but it's just funny. It's almost like, I feel like he's almost overwhelmed with having to sort
2564440	2569480	through everything because now he has these random patches of, well, I have some orange flowers over
2569480	2573640	there that are just all kind of mixed together. I have some purple and pink ones over there that
2573640	2579160	are just kind of all mixed together. And I have three villagers on my Island. He hasn't even
2579160	2585160	picked all his weeds yet. He's like, I kind of liked the way the weeds look and I'm like, no,
2585160	2591080	you need to get rid of them or you're never going to get a three star rating. So it's, but it's,
2591080	2596680	it's kind of been fun and reinvigorating to experience the game from day one all over again
2596680	2602360	through him. And like, you know, like Alan doesn't usually get into console gaming.
2602360	2606200	So the fact that he bought a switch and he's playing animal crossing is kind of a big deal.
2606200	2613160	Like he's like exclusively been PC gaming a long time. Like I can't even think of the last time,
2613160	2617560	like I watched him sit down and play a console game. So this is kind of a big deal. And of
2617560	2621400	course now I showed him more art, you know, cause even though some things I own digitally,
2621400	2625800	so he can't play them like super Mario maker too. Like I can't like loan that to him.
2625800	2630040	Some things I have on cartridge that he has expressed interest. He wants to get into like
2630040	2635400	Zelda breath of the wild. So it, it will be kind of fun to revisit a lot of those games for the
2635400	2642760	first time through him. That'll be pretty cool. So, all right. Bonds 006 says a lot of my Facebook
2642760	2648200	friends are begging others to come to their Island. I like reading their pitches to get visitors
2649560	2655960	without getting too deep into the psychology of it all. I think a lot of that is the time and age
2655960	2661720	that we live in with all of this. My hands floating around here, going on in the world
2661720	2667560	is that you can't really go out and visit people in person. So animal crossing is kind of the way
2667560	2672280	for some people to kind of get that contact with other people. So I think that's why you have a
2672280	2677000	lot of people that are really open to like, please come visit my village, even though I don't have
2677000	2681720	anything that exciting going on today. Water my flowers, you know, or something. And I'm happy to
2681720	2685320	go to other people's town and water their flowers. You never know what's in nooks and
2685320	2689720	I usually will keep a stash of oranges from my town or my islands, especially on me and go sell
2689720	2695320	them in other people's towns. So it's kind of like a point for me to go there. So yeah. It's,
2695320	2698360	it's, it's an interesting side effect of everything that's going on in the world.
2698360	2703400	Anyway, it wasn't all animal crossing, but I wanted to update you on Alan getting his switch
2703400	2709400	this week. Some other games I've been playing. So I got sucked into another sale on the PlayStation
2709480	2715160	store. They had a big in Japan sale. So there was a couple games I got on discount. One of them is
2715160	2721000	Taiko no Tatujin on PlayStation 4. I think it's called, maybe somebody in chat can correct me.
2721000	2725960	I think it's Taiko no Tatujin Drum Master is the subtitle of it, but it's like, it's the PlayStation
2725960	2731000	4 release of Taiko no Tatujin. So speaking of music games, you know, this is one that goes
2731000	2735640	way back, right? Like Taiko no Tatujin, when was the first round of those games? Probably in the
2735640	2741480	PS2 era. And if you don't know, like there's a, there's a tiny little drum or in the arcade,
2741480	2746360	it's a big drum and you can kind of, you either hit it in the middle, the left or the right side
2746360	2751400	on the red notches, or you hit it on the rim with the blue notches on the left or the right side.
2751400	2755400	And I was always kind of like, I don't know how that's really going to translate well to controller,
2755400	2758600	but since it was on sale for like 14 bucks, I was like, eh, screw it. I'll pick it up.
2759320	2763560	And so I did, and it's kind of fun to play on controller. They did it in a way where
2764520	2771240	right and down or X and O, I think if I'm remembering my symbols right, are the inside,
2771240	2777160	the reds. So it's like the inside of the controller is where you hit for the red and then
2777160	2783880	the outside or the L1, R1 or L2, R2 are the blue ones. And you can hit those for the blue ones.
2783880	2789000	So it actually, it makes it easy to kind of like do a drum roll, like you would with the sticks.
2789000	2793160	So it's actually, it's not too terribly laid out. And I've been playing a variety,
2793160	2797880	it's got a huge song list. No songs you would really know probably unless there are some
2797880	2802280	classical songs in it. And there's a lot of anime songs in it. I don't follow anime so closely,
2802280	2805800	but like the theme of Doraemon is in it. And so some of you that follow anime a little better
2805800	2812120	than I do will probably recognize stuff in it. And there's a lot of J-pop in it. And so I don't know
2812120	2817320	if these songs are huge or not, cause I haven't really listened to them before, but they were
2817320	2821000	catchy. There was a song in there called Linda Linda, I thought was really, really catchy.
2821000	2828280	So, cause like, it's like a rock song. It goes, what? Any Katamari track? No, there's no Katamari
2828280	2833000	track, but they do have other game soundtrack songs, including it was weird. It's the Pac-Man
2833000	2839000	song, but when it was in Ridge Racer. So it's the Ridge Racer Pac-Man song. That is one of
2839000	2843720	the songs in the game. And there's like a Soul Calibur 6 song and things like that. So, yeah.
2843720	2851240	Oh, Bonds 006 says, what was the ripoff? This or Donkey Kong? I think Donkey Kong was after
2851240	2858600	Taika. They were about the same time. It was, I think it was after. Was it? Was it technically,
2858600	2864120	did Namco have input on that game? Was it their version of it? I don't remember. And it's been
2864120	2871080	so long. I don't remember. Oh, I didn't know that. Jason, our voiceover guy in chat saying Linda
2871080	2876040	Linda wasn't owned on. I didn't know that. Okay. Thank you, Bobby. Namco made Donkey Kong. Okay.
2876040	2879880	I figured there had to be some questions. So that's why. So it was, it was one of those.
2880680	2886840	It's like Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine or the Yoshi's forest or whatever it was.
2888040	2895880	It's there. It's Puyo Puyo, but with the characters in it. Okay. Let's see. Let's see.
2895880	2899480	S2100 Matt says Taiko is such a fun arcade experience. I was always hesitant to see if
2899480	2904280	that would translate to the console versions. And it totally does translate well. Act F says
2904280	2910600	there's also Taiko no Tatsujin drum and fun on the Switch. Yeah. And I thought, I think it's
2911320	2918440	fun because they put a lot of things to do in it. They have the little gotcha reward boxes things,
2919080	2924120	but you don't pay for the boxes. Instead you fill out these little mini bingo cards. So every song
2924120	2928120	in the game, and there's gotta be at least 50 of them, if not more. And there's a ton of DLC. You
2928120	2932120	could probably buy like 30 or 40 more songs, but they want like two bucks a song. So I haven't
2932120	2936840	bought any of them. Um, but every song has a little bingo card that goes with it. And it's
2936840	2940680	a three by three bingo card. And as you do little certain accomplishments, you fill out the bingo
2940680	2944920	card. And then when you get a bingo three across or down, it's more like Tic Tac Toes. I don't know
2944920	2948680	why they call it bingo, but when you get a bingo, you get a little coin and you can use the coins in
2948680	2954440	the shop to open like loot boxes. But luckily they don't have like, or at least I didn't see it,
2954440	2959800	a DLC that's like pay $20 and get all these loot boxes. I didn't see that. So I'm okay with the
2959800	2963560	loot box thing when it's like self-contained like that. And I actually thought the little,
2963560	2967800	because once you finish a bingo card, spoiler alert, if you get all nine on a bingo card,
2968360	2974040	you get a special bingo card that's even harder. So it kind of gets some replayability value.
2974040	2978920	And I thought the online component is kind of neat. You can do ranked matches online,
2978920	2983480	but you're not playing live against people. You're playing against people's ghosts.
2984200	2988760	So it has a recording of somebody else playing a song and you're playing against that. And I
2988760	2993240	thought that was a pretty clever way to do it. So that way there's always somebody online to fight.
2993240	2996200	Cause you know how, like sometimes in these games, once they've been out a year or two,
2996200	3000840	nobody's playing them anymore. Well, nice with this thing being on sale, I can still go in and
3000840	3005480	do ranked matches and you do placement matches and then you're given a certain rank and you,
3005480	3009320	you know, can level up or you can even go down if you're not beating enough people.
3009320	3015160	And I'm finding that, you know, I'm winning two out of three. So, so far I haven't played a lot
3015160	3020600	of them, but it was kind of neat. I liked it. So yeah, I thought, I thought the, let's see,
3020600	3024600	active says the bingo cards are only obtainable within game currency and you can't buy that with
3024600	3030200	real money. Good to know. Very good to know. Bobby Blackwell says I have the PS2 Tycho versions.
3030200	3034840	I have four of the games and the controller. Yeah. So, I mean, yeah, this is the first one
3034840	3039400	I remember buying in a long time. So, it's a lot of fun and I'm enjoying playing it.
3040360	3046280	The other game I bought on the PlayStation 4 sale, I'm going to stop for a minute here because this
3046280	3051400	is very important. I'm about to say a very controversial gaming opinion. That's probably
3051400	3056600	going to make some of you very upset. So, I'm just going to beg you. Let me have my shitty opinion.
3056600	3060760	Please don't rage unsubscribe or anything from the show because of my shitty opinion. Okay.
3061400	3066600	But I'm entitled to my shitty opinion. Here it is. The other game I bought on the file, on the,
3067480	3073800	the, uh, uh, sale is the Final Fantasy 8 remake because it was $10. And I was like, you know what?
3074920	3079160	It's high time. You know what? I need to give this game another chance. I always pick on this
3079160	3084360	Final Fantasy game. It's always like the one I say is the worst because I can't stand the junction
3084360	3089800	drawing and all that stuff. I, I've never really cared for Final Fantasy 8. Let me give it another
3089800	3095880	try. And so I started it up. I let it play. I got through the opening sequence and I was like,
3096760	3101720	this CD video hasn't aged very well, but okay. It's, you know, they didn't have time to go redo
3101720	3110040	it, whatever. And then the game starts. Loki. I have to be honest, Loki. It looks like garbage.
3110040	3118440	I'm sorry. It looks so bad. Like, and here's the thing. This is the reason why. Let me justify my
3118440	3123560	shitty opinion. Okay. Cause I already know some of you are like, Steven, look, look, we all have
3123560	3130840	our problematic gaming opinions. This is mine. It's that juxtaposition of this really high
3130840	3137640	definition, really good looking model of like Squall or Kestis and these characters,
3137640	3143480	but then they didn't do anything to the backgrounds, which have not aged well since
3143480	3151400	the PlayStation 1 era. They look very like, it looks like you're putting on a pair of bad glasses
3151400	3156040	and everything's very blurred. And like, here's the thing. When I play the Final Fantasy 7,
3157000	3161080	not the remake, but the Final Fantasy 7 version that they put on PlayStation 4,
3161640	3167000	it all looks kind of bad and grainy and you go, Oh, retro experience, but something about
3167000	3175640	Final Fantasy 8, where it's like HD clashing with like non HD at the same time. Like I could
3175640	3182120	not get past it. Loki. I could not get past it. I'm sorry. So there it is. One of those games that
3182120	3189400	would benefit from like that, uh, AI upscaled stuff where they do that on PC or something.
3189960	3195400	All right. I I'm finally taking a look at trash to see, or sorry, take a look at chat to see if
3195400	3203480	they're calling me trash. Oh, and let's see. Bobby Black Wolf says, I'm not angry. I'm just
3203480	3209080	disappointed. DJ Rama S says the redheaded stepchild of the Final Fantasy games. Quest
3209080	3213480	Buster says, I'm not mad. I'm laughing. You stop playing where you want to Rob.
3214120	3219400	Bonds006 says, we all have our moment of let me give X title a try. And Repcycled says,
3219400	3224360	Oh yeah, it wasn't what I expected. Repcycled says the backgrounds are CGI renders. Can't
3224360	3229400	they just rerender it in high res? Like, I feel like if it was that the original files or
3229400	3238440	something. Yeah. And if it was that easy, they would have like, you know, was it 12 for one of
3238440	3243240	them they had, like they found the old, maybe it's even eight or they found the older files
3243240	3250760	and upscaled at the seven 20. But that may have been eight actually. Now they think of it. So
3251400	3256200	I'm going to be like brutally honest. I turned the game off before I even got out of the
3256200	3262040	balam garden. Like I didn't even get into a battle. I was like, I literally just had a,
3262040	3267480	I was playing it and I'm like, and like I access one of the computer terminals and like my eyes
3267480	3272120	are hurting. It's so blurry and bad. And I'm like, I, and then I'm like walking through and
3272120	3276200	I run into selfie and I'm like, okay, let's take her on a little tour. And I just, I hit a point
3276200	3283080	where I just put the controller on the table and I said, I can't. And I turned it off. I will
3283800	3288840	now before you final fantasy eight fans, send me your hate tweets and cyber bullying and hate
3288840	3293720	email. I will try again this week because I owe it at least to get to a battle. Okay.
3294360	3300920	But so you play on PC because someone did release a pack that they did the AI gigapixel
3301720	3305480	upscaling to four K and it actually looks pretty good.
3305480	3309000	Bobby black Wolf and Chad says the original source code was lost or destroyed or both
3309000	3316280	final fantasy 13. They found the original files and upscaled to seven 20. Yes. And that's the one
3316280	3320200	I really want to play right now. And I wish game pass would hurry up and add it. So I don't get
3320200	3324520	tempted into buying that whole trilogy again, but I'm game pass did announce they're adding
3324520	3329480	final fantasy nine, like within days, like it's the early first half of this month. So it's,
3329480	3333080	if they didn't add it, like now it's, uh, within the next couple of days,
3333080	3337560	file fancy nine is getting at it. So that's pretty cool. And there's no HD. So I think
3337560	3341720	file fancy nine will be a little easier to stomach because you're not going to have the clash going
3341720	3348440	on of HD on top of not HD. It's all going to be non HD. And I think it will be a little more
3348440	3353960	palatable. May have to check it out on PC. I wonder if I, I know I have seven,
3353960	3357960	I think Alan owns it. So I need to do that whole library lending thing. I don't know. Anyway,
3357960	3363320	there it is. There was my gaming week. Oh boy. I just asked you 100. Matt just clipped. Oh boy,
3363320	3367560	I'm going to be in so much trouble. Sorry. Again, please don't hate unsubscribe. We love you. We
3367560	3372440	value, we value all the opinions. I see you final fantasy eight fans. And again, I I'm going to give
3372440	3378280	you this cookie. I recognize that the story in final fantasy eight is pretty good. And like my
3378280	3383960	problem has always been with just the game part of the game. Like I hated the drawing junctioning.
3383960	3388360	I hated that everything leveled up with you that those were all the things that like bothered me
3388360	3393480	about the game. Uh, originally like it's not the story. So let's just make that clear. All right.
3394360	3398360	I find people are willing to let it slide a little more when I give that little disclaimer.
3399960	3403800	All right, let's get into some gaming news and what's been going on in the world this week.
3403800	3410280	Loki help change the topic. Okay. So, uh, let's talk a little bit about leaks.
3411000	3416120	So apparently there is this giant Nintendo leak that happened. So
3417320	3424600	lots of different things leaked out and a lot of it was surrounding the Nintendo Wii. And so
3425400	3432440	they had stuff like with old Pokemon debug roms and source code, uh, 3ds debug roms, uh,
3432440	3438200	the keys for all the consoles. Uh, so those are all the encrypted keys to get access to some of
3438200	3444760	the, um, you know, to be able to sign your own code almost on, uh, everything up through the DSI.
3445960	3452040	Then of course, full source code design files, documentation, and everything basically used
3452040	3457960	to create the Wii. So full source code for the operating system, which I thought was weird.
3457960	3464520	It's actually called iOS. So, um, with that, I mean, this thing is going to be hacked. I mean,
3464520	3468440	or he has hacked the pieces, but now, I mean, they could do some really crazy stuff with that.
3469240	3473480	Um, I want to read some, can I read something from the discord? So we have a discord, of course,
3473480	3477800	and we encourage you to join over at vog network.com slash discord. And sometimes you guys post
3477800	3480920	stories throughout the week and we use some of those stories in, in planning, or you leave a
3480920	3485640	comment that sticks in my mind of, Oh, I need to mention that on the show. So we had a comment on
3485640	3491800	this from 13 forever in chat, um, or excuse me on discord who sent us a tweet. So the first
3491800	3497400	thing was a tweet that says, uh, and the tweet is from an account Mark and 42 that says people
3497400	3503320	love to get all excited about leaks of official SDKs or code, but really rarely are they all that
3503320	3507960	amazing early on in development of homebrew for a console, they can help make things move much
3507960	3513800	faster, but the expense of legally tainting everything they touch. And then, uh, 13 leaves
3513800	3521560	the comment delete that leak is overblown and misreported. Yes. So like for example, um, the,
3522280	3525640	there was, you know, folks were thinking, well with this, you know, you could have better
3525640	3530600	emulation or whatever, but not necessarily because if you use the exact code or whatever
3530600	3536280	that's in that for emulation, then they can shut you down because you're basically using pirated
3536280	3541080	code, but not to say that you couldn't like gleam some information. Like if you're having trouble
3541080	3546840	with a certain thing or rendering a certain, you know, part of a game or maybe like sound design or
3546840	3552120	whatever the case may be where you tried and tried and tried with the emulator, but just can't seem
3552120	3556120	to crack what it is or how it runs or something. You might be able to look at that code and
3556120	3562280	understand what you're doing wrong, um, without actually using the direct code. Not to say that
3562280	3567000	there wouldn't be some unscrupulous folks that may be able to like clone the Wii system, or I
3567000	3571000	don't even know what they could be done with it, but it's still very interesting to see, you know,
3571000	3577720	some of this data that's come out and some of the cool, uh, like little tech demos and whatnot that
3577720	3583800	they had put together with that from like the GameCube and everything. And by the way, there's
3583800	3588520	echoing comments in the chat about what basically what you just said is that, you know, and as, as
3588520	3593160	much as it sounds like this is really exciting stuff for emulators, uh, it could, it would actually
3593160	3598120	damage them to use this code. Yeah, like even the folks, I think with, um, Dolphin or whatever, they
3598120	3602680	said that, yeah, we're not even gonna look at that. We can't look at that. We're not even gonna, you
3602680	3607160	know, we're gonna pretend it doesn't exist type of thing. I think the reason why a story like this
3607160	3613800	catches fire is that for one, the Wii was, remember, just remember how like crazy popular the Wii was,
3613800	3619400	right? And I think it's just that element of TEEHEE, I'm seeing something I'm not supposed to see,
3619400	3625240	heehee. I think that's the reason why this stuff spreads like wildfire is like, don't look at that.
3625240	3630040	What? Right? Like everybody wants to see it. What's this like, you know,
3630040	3633560	assuming that they have like all this stuff out there, obviously like, you're not going to see
3633560	3639640	emulator of teams or whatever using this data or they, they probably wouldn't be using this data,
3639640	3644840	but who's to say that you couldn't like someone couldn't fork one of those emulators or whatever
3644840	3649480	and start incorporating that code or some, somehow to do it, you know, under the radar or whatever,
3649480	3654440	or, you know, you have some unscrupulous folks developing, you know, mod chips or something
3654520	3659320	into these where they could bypass something or learn how to sign code a certain way. And you
3659320	3665560	could, I don't know what you could do with it. Not for me to, to really say, because I don't know
3665560	3670200	how to do any of this stuff. So we'll have to see what happens with it. And the thought is that there
3670200	3674040	may actually be more data that's out there that hasn't been leaked yet, that this is only a
3674040	3681480	portion of it. So I'm curious to see what happens. Uh, bonds 006 asks, will we get an explosion of
3681480	3687960	home brew from this? And I'm kind of, I'm kind of like, I don't, I don't see it being more or
3687960	3692920	less than what's already being made. Right. We already had a lot of home brew because remember
3692920	3696520	there was that whole installing the home brew channel on your Wii. Remember the whole thing.
3696520	3701880	So you could run like home brew software. Like that was all still big when the Wii was still
3701880	3707960	like a current piece of hardware. So I don't see it exploding now. Well, like, here's my thought
3708520	3713240	with this, like, could it be possible for somebody to like, say, you know how we have right now where
3713240	3718200	folks can create their own NES cartridges or something like that. They're able to build it.
3718200	3723720	So it can actually run on the real hardware could maybe someone home brew a Wii game and build it so
3723720	3728200	that it can run on the actual hardware and be able to sign it correctly so that the system thinks
3728200	3734120	it's, you know, an actual legit copy of a, you know, disc or something like that. Or I don't
3734120	3739080	know what you could really do with it. In theory. Yes. Although you're going to hit that same
3739080	3745240	problem where Nintendo is going to pursue it and shut it down. However, this does be, I mean,
3745240	3749800	we're all quick to kind of say, Nintendo will sue it. Nintendo will shut it down. What if it comes
3749800	3756200	from a country where they don't give a shit about copyright? No, that's a serious question. What
3756200	3760680	happens if it comes from a country that doesn't give a shit about copyright? Then it's a little
3760680	3767160	harder. That argument becomes a little more complex. Yeah. I mean, if they try to sell it
3767160	3773560	here that then it's not, well, now it's happening here, but could this open up things in other
3773560	3778360	countries? I don't know. It's really hard question to take on. I also kind of think it maybe is a lot
3778360	3783720	of work. It's kind of one of those like lots of work, maybe. I don't know. I, again, I feel like
3783720	3789640	most things that would be exist for home brew development emulation on the Wii have probably
3789640	3793560	happened. Although, sure, the emulation can always get better and it can get stronger,
3793560	3798360	but the reputable, respectable teams are not going to be diving into this because they know they
3798360	3804120	can't. Yeah. No. One of the things that was interesting that was also leaked out of it was
3804120	3810120	the official Game Boy emulator. So I'm assuming this is what was running on like a DS or something
3810120	3815400	like that to run, or maybe, I don't know if it was necessarily a DS. I can't remember where they
3815400	3822280	had like game. No, the original DS ran color. Well, it ran advantage games. Did it run the,
3822280	3829240	well, the advantage ran Game Boy color game. Did it have Game Boy hardware in it? Like it had like
3829240	3833240	the same chip on there or I don't know. Was that actually emulated? Can you look at the documents
3833240	3840680	and tell me, okay, let's find the documents that download all three gigs of that from wherever it
3840680	3846680	is somewhere out there. Oh, Oh yeah. You'll find it easily on 4chan. Oh, that's going to be a fun
3846680	3853880	journey. Yeah. I don't think I'll be doing that. Yeah. The needle is in the haystack,
3853880	3859560	but just so you know, the haystack is full of bees. Yeah. So anyways, so where this actually
3859560	3864440	came from, since, you know, we didn't really discuss that is it was coming from Broadon,
3864440	3870200	which is, or at least that's where the thought is where they came from. So Broadon was a company
3870280	3877160	that was in, I believe China that was developed. They developed the IQ system, which I think that
3877160	3885720	was that a GameCube, the Panasonic player, the Panasonic Q that one. No, it was the IQ. No,
3885720	3889320	you're right. I think Jamie's highlighted that on the show like a long time ago, but yes, I know
3889320	3894360	what you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, apparently the thought is that's where this is
3894360	3899800	from. Although why would the source code for like Pokemon games be in there or the Wii operating
3899800	3904520	system and stuff? I wouldn't think this would be something that would be a part of that, but
3905160	3909640	I don't know. Maybe they were working on a Wii device or something. Who knows? Who knows?
3909640	3915320	Maybe. Who knows? All right. Well, can we see what Smarter Minds will do with it?
3915320	3919880	Well, or, or not. Cause they can't. It's just one of those. That's interesting. Okay. Yeah.
3919880	3923960	So I totally get the perspective of the comment and discord. That's kind of like,
3923960	3928120	people are making this a much bigger deal than it is. And I think it's, it's just one of those
3928120	3931960	we're seeing something we're not supposed to see it's insider information, but there's going
3931960	3935720	to be people that download it that have no idea like what to even do with it. You know what I
3935720	3938840	mean? They're going to download it just because they're told they're not supposed to have it.
3940360	3944920	And that's, that's why this story is catching everywhere here. Something you're not supposed
3944920	3949560	to have is on the parts of the internet. You rarely visit. All right. Anyway,
3951160	3956040	let's move on and talk about some other news. Uh, this is one of those, this is a bummer,
3956040	3962040	but is anyone really surprised? The 2020 Tokyo game show has been canceled this year. And of
3962040	3967240	course, as you can imagine, it's because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Uh, so it will not be happening
3967240	3971800	this year and it will be replaced with an online showcase. Uh, an official statement from Tokyo
3971800	3977080	game show says due to the outbreak of novel coronavirus or COVID-19 on a global scale.
3977080	3982040	And the situation remains unpredictable in Japan as well. The organizer and the co-organizers have
3982040	3986680	reached this decision after a long consideration to place the utmost priority on the health and
3986680	3992200	safety of visitors, exhibitors, and stakeholders. We ask for your kind understanding and cooperation.
3992200	3996680	Um, and again, I don't think anyone's really surprised by this. Some people may be surprised,
3996680	4002200	like, isn't it a little early for this to cancel? Like we still have things like, you know, the,
4002200	4006440	the talk has been going on about things around labor day weekend, like dragon con, you know,
4006440	4010760	still haven't canceled and we've already gotten into those reasons and so forth and the legal
4010760	4015400	stuff behind it. And, you know, Bobby took a deep dive on that if you want to hear all that.
4015400	4019720	But I think also the reality is with something like Tokyo game show, you know, you have all these
4019720	4024920	exhibitors and they've got to prepare things. They've got to plan their booths. They've got
4024920	4029320	a plan, you know, all these things that go into it. And if they kind of know like, all right,
4030520	4033640	big events are not going to be happening for the rest of the year. Like, you know,
4033640	4036760	all of the scientists are telling us this and everything's kind of pointing to that.
4036760	4042520	Then why have people waste their energy this far out in planning their demos, planning their
4042520	4046440	boosts, planning all of that stuff to something that they just know is not going to happen.
4047240	4053720	And I think that's why it cancels this far out. So pretty much, I would just expect at this point
4053720	4058680	that any 2020 convention just ain't happening. Um, I'm going to cross my fingers and tell,
4058680	4062680	I'm still hoping for a miracle. I'm still, I'm still hoping dragon con can happen. I'm,
4062680	4067560	I'm an idiot. And the reason why, you know, I'm like, well, you know, it took us a couple months,
4067560	4072600	like go, uh, go two months ago to, uh, where we were at then. That was right when this whole
4072600	4076680	thing was starting. So two months from now is going to be July and who knows where we're going
4076680	4081800	to be by then. You know? Yes. Yes. I listened to science. Yes. I know a lot of the news isn't good.
4081800	4086760	So sue me if I want to be a little bit optimistic. All right. Give me, give me something. Cause I'm
4086760	4090360	getting fucking sick of being at home too. Just like everybody else. And yes, I'll do it. Yes.
4090360	4094280	I understand the importance of it. No, I'm not going to be down there protesting that I want my
4094280	4098520	haircut because I understand that something, you know, I have a dad who's 80 years old.
4098520	4103480	I need to make sure he's okay. So I'm doing my part in everything. But, um, you know,
4103480	4108600	it's just one of those, like, I wish it would happen, but I'm accepting the reality. It's
4108600	4113080	probably not. And so that goes with pretty much any of the big game shows, any of the big
4113080	4118200	conventions and so forth. So we have to start seeing now, if some of this starts to dip into
4118200	4124600	2021, what happens with stuff in January, like magfest and so forth? Who knows? Who knows? Yeah,
4124600	4128520	it's just, I think it really is too early to say at this point, but maybe some of that will start
4128520	4135080	getting evaluated over the summer and things like that. So, uh, anyway, um, you know, it's, um,
4136920	4140920	it's not particularly surprising here. It gets canceled. It'll be interesting to see what they
4140920	4145320	do in the virtual space. Now we know it's going to be a virtual convention. So what is that going
4145320	4149560	to look like? Is it something you're going to have to pay to access, to see trailers and
4149560	4153720	maybe pay, play some demos online or something? I don't know. Uh, or, or what is it going to be?
4153720	4157640	Or is it just going to be a drip feeding of trailers or something like that? Who knows
4157640	4161240	more to come, I suppose. So let's move on to our next story. Loki.
4162600	4172840	All right. So, uh, Roblox has had a user breach. Basically what happened was, is there was this,
4172840	4180200	a hacker that bribed, uh, one of the Roblox, I guess, employees to gain access to their backend
4180200	4187880	customer support panel. And apparently using that, they were able to take a hold and gain
4187880	4194040	access to some of the more prominent Roblox players that are out there. Um, if there's
4194040	4199480	such a thing and they were able to do things as, you know, see the user's email addresses,
4199480	4205560	change passwords, remove two factor authentication from the accounts, ban users and more.
4206360	4213080	Apparently there was some folks on there that, you know, some of these, you know, high, more popular,
4213080	4218120	like streamers or whatever that had private emails that were tied to that. And they were getting
4218120	4223640	contacted by this guy as well to, you know, basically he was bragging that he had their
4223640	4231320	account or something. So it's, it's interesting, um, that they let this happen. Apparently it was
4231320	4240280	a small set of users that had this happen to them, but still kind of ridiculous that it was somebody
4240280	4247160	that basically fished their way into the system. But apparently those folks that did have their
4247160	4254840	accounts compromised were contacted, um, by the hacker. Yeah. And I think it's kind of funny
4254840	4259880	cause I don't know if you kind of brushed Roblox off there at the beginning, but Roblox is huge
4259880	4266680	online. I understand it is my kids play it all the time. Yeah. It's more of a tween audience,
4266680	4273160	I suppose. Mostly it's one of the, it's one of the games that's coming to the Xbox series X.
4273800	4281560	So I see, um, it's going to fully, I've seen the thing is with Roblox is a lot of it,
4281560	4287960	it's all user generated content. And so a lot of it's just plain trash. There's some things that
4287960	4295080	are popular. Like my son keeps talking about this horror game series that he plays, that's called
4295080	4300920	piggy and that there's like 21 chapters of or something. And he says it's very much like granny.
4300920	4307960	I'm like, none of this means anything to me right now. Um, I'm like, is this what I
4307960	4312440	sounded like when I was his age and talking about Nickelodeon shows to my mom? Like, is that what
4312440	4318360	this is all about? Well, no, no, no. I like, I would be, you know, able to like keep up with all
4318360	4323800	that stuff. It's not like I'm getting old. It's just, it's, it's, it's a stupid, um, I get it.
4323800	4329880	He's into the, but like, I'm not going to pay attention to every single like obstacle course
4329880	4334600	game that he plays or something, but he's very interested in like the streamers that he watches
4334600	4338600	that play. And then he goes and plays with them or something like that. Like they'll do a live
4338600	4345400	stream. And so I don't know, but like, yeah, I know it's a very popular game. It's also full of
4345400	4353080	just all sorts of copyright IP theft, trademark infringement. It's all over the place. That's
4353080	4358680	absolute not user generated content. What do you expect? Yeah, but they just don't see the police,
4358680	4365240	any of that. All right. Uh, let's move on and talk about, uh, another announcement this week,
4365240	4370040	which I guess was supposed to be like one of the first, uh, summer game. I even forgot the name
4370040	4374360	of that thing already. Summer game Fest. So they're calling it the format. Yeah. Yeah. I
4374360	4379160	think this was supposed to be one of those announcements, but it was all over the Twitter
4379160	4383640	by within five seconds of it being announced. And that has to do with mortal combat 11,
4383640	4389000	getting an expansion pack called aftermath. It is going to add to the story and it's going to add
4389000	4393480	some new characters to the game, including fusion, uh, who I believe was originally in mortal combat
4393480	4398840	four. Right. He's like the air God. Right. Right. Uh, and then you have a Shiva. That's pretty cool.
4398840	4403160	Shiva was the like Goro, the female Goro and mortal combat three. Remember that? So, uh,
4403160	4410280	she's in that too. And then Robocop because, uh, mortal combat 11 has become this very interesting,
4410280	4416520	like Hollywood versus video games type of thing. Uh, and, and, uh, Robocop is going to be in it.
4416520	4423560	And at Boone in a tweet confirmed, Peter Weller is voicing Robocop. That's pretty awesome. Yes,
4423560	4427320	that is, that is pretty cool. Like, don't get me wrong. It's just, it's just like random,
4427320	4431320	like, well, cause what we have the terminator, right. Isn't one of the, it was in 11. I'm trying
4431320	4437640	to remember who's in 10 and who's in 11. Cause it's different. Um, well I know 11 has like spawn
4437640	4443320	and there's a terminator, uh, the joker. Oh, right. The joker. See, and then like some of them
4443320	4447960	like had like Freddie and Jason and, but that was like, I think that was 10. Those are even
4447960	4453080	all the way back to nine. I think Freddie was in her. Those weren't, no, those weren't injustice.
4453080	4460280	Yeah. Yeah. It was a predator in this one. I don't remember. Predator was in the last one.
4460280	4464680	I was in the last one. Yeah. All right. Uh, thank you. SU 100, Matt, laying it out for me. Thank
4464680	4470840	you. I needed something very plain text there. Leatherface Freddie, Jason alien predator were
4470840	4476920	in the last games. Thank you. Uh, and Freddie was also in nine, uh, and, uh, tiger class saying we
4476920	4481800	now have a Robo cop versus terminator in a fighting game. Yes, we do. Uh, those comments
4481800	4488040	from our Twitch channel, twitch.tv slash vog network. This is all coming out on may 26th.
4488040	4493080	Um, so the expansion will have the cinematic story, the new characters and new skins,
4493080	4499960	three new skins for 39 99. There is too expensive. There is also an aftermath collection,
4499960	4505880	which includes the base game, the combat pack, downloadable content. And now the aftermath
4505880	4513160	expansion will be available digitally and also, uh, physically in June for the 59 99 kind of more
4513160	4517880	traditional price tag. Yeah. Well, I always wait for the game of the year edition, but, um, yeah.
4517960	4524120	So I think that should be like 29 99 at most, like that's ridiculous. Cause you're basically
4524120	4531400	saying that you have folks that paid $60 and they paid for that expansion pack to get the, um, the
4531400	4538280	extra characters or whatever. And now you have them pain again, like another $140 or whatever
4538280	4541640	was like honor 20 bucks for that game. I mean, come on. I'm going to, I'm going to give two
4541640	4546200	sides. I'm going to give two sides. Yeah. I do agree. $30 is a little expensive for me,
4546200	4551400	but for the more like hardcore mortal combat fans, I know the story in that game has typically
4551400	4557320	been very well done. So I think for a story expansion, some people may see the value in that,
4557320	4563240	but I'm also of the mindset, like for me personally, I'm like, it'll be by the holidays.
4563240	4569160	This is cheaper. But like, I'm, I'm even saying like 29 99, that's including the story. I would
4569160	4575000	say like, if we're going to just forgo the story thing, maybe 1999, like I still think that's
4575800	4581880	ridiculous for the three characters. I mean, come on. Um, I did like that they added the friendships
4581880	4586520	in the arena fatalities, which are pretty cool. I was going to say that part is free. So there's
4586520	4591240	a free update coming at the same time and it will add new stages, including the classic Deadpool,
4591240	4596600	of course has a K, uh, the soul chamber. There will be new stage fatalities. If you're putting
4596600	4600840	the classic Deadpool in there, of course you gotta have the stage fatality and friendships are coming
4600840	4604840	back. And that's exciting. Like, uh, there was the one of scorpion. He goes, get over here. And
4604840	4610840	it's a big Teddy bear that he hugs. Uh, and then Kano had one where he was starting a barbecue with
4610840	4618520	his, um, eye laser and he's barbecuing. Uh, and then I saw one for sub zero where, um, it was,
4618520	4624440	uh, an ice cream cart or something like that, or no, it was, it was, um, it was the night,
4624440	4630440	the nitro nitro nitrogen frozen thing. Cause that's all the rage, right? It was that.
4631480	4637800	So, and it's funny cause it's sub zero. So yeah. Anyway, I thought that was all pretty funny. So,
4637800	4642520	uh, yeah. And that actually, the funny thing is that kind of stuff makes me want to play these
4642520	4647880	newer mortal combat games. Cause I, you know, I don't care for like these fatalities are getting
4647880	4653160	to be a little much like it was funny when it was comical, when it was like itchy and scratchy level
4653160	4659400	stuff like mortal combat two on the super Nintendo, that was fine. Now I'm like, this is a little too
4659400	4666200	real for me, but if I can just friendship everybody, I'm fine with that. So I might
4666200	4670280	actually be okay with this now that I can friendship everybody. Oh yes. That was that's
4670280	4674360	right. Thank you. Johnny. We'll say points out another one. New, but was playing jump rope with
4674360	4678680	his shadows. Yeah. That was really funny too. So I'm all about the friendships. I think they're
4678680	4687240	great. So, all right, let's move on. Uh, Loki, what do you got for us? All right. Um, so we
4687320	4695320	have a few companies swapping their IPs. Uh, basically we've got a THQ Nordic and Koch media,
4695960	4700520	um, kind of shuffling around. So that's up according to, I believe what Bobby was saying
4700520	4706760	earlier that it's because the developer behind those games actually as a move companies or as
4706760	4713400	owned, I guess it says they're both owned by the same parent company and bracer group. Um, so
4714120	4716840	some of the stuff that's shifted around and I really don't know what this means
4716840	4723320	necessarily for games coming out, but you've got, uh, red faction and painkiller going to,
4723320	4734840	um, I guess, uh, THQ Nordic. And then you've got, uh, looks like sacred risen rush for Berlin,
4734840	4744200	second site and singles, flirt up your life. So those are, um, going, I'm sorry. Yeah. THQ
4744200	4748680	Newark is getting those last four and apparently Koch media is getting red faction and painkiller.
4749640	4754600	All these games we have not seen games for in a while. So, yeah. Yeah. Kind of interesting
4754600	4759240	that these games might kind of get a new life through it. And also do we, I mean like THQ Nordic,
4759240	4764040	like another, and I can't remember how this has all been passed down, but it was another company
4764040	4769320	completely that then bought the THQ name and is now like getting the THQ licenses back that were
4769320	4773800	with this other company. Right. Isn't that like a whole element to this? Yeah. So, yeah. So the,
4773800	4779080	basically one of the cool parts about it is apparently action is now back in control games.
4779080	4785160	I've had this like thing, this USB thing from an E3 with like demos from like the last E3 I went
4785160	4790920	to, which was years ago. It's Nordic games. It's THQ. Yeah. So, um, yeah, but now red
4791000	4795480	factions basically with volition now. So, you know, the original developers. So
4797160	4803560	I'm all for a new, uh, new red faction game. Yeah. Uh, Questbuster in chat says I want a
4803560	4810760	new red faction along the lines of gorilla. So, uh, SGL 100, Matt says, I still have not played
4810760	4815160	any of them. It's that player that gets put in the trade to be waived afterwards. They're not going
4815160	4819800	to make that game, which I imagine is the, the, whatever that crazy title was you said there at
4819800	4824600	the end. So it's just, it's the throwaway one they put in there to just make it a little more value.
4826040	4830600	Oh yeah. The singles flirting up your life. That sounds like a mobile game for me.
4830600	4836760	But yeah, maybe that's where it ends up. It's a shitty mobile title. Maybe makes a few bucks.
4836760	4841720	Fine. Whatever. But they probably won't do much with it otherwise. So, yeah. All right.
4841720	4847080	Well, moving on to something that's been getting some kind of like bigger headlines than just in
4847080	4853400	gaming blogs. And that has to do with the absence of Nintendo games. And the reason why I think, um,
4853400	4858120	it's picked up a lot of steam on other news blogs and you're seeing more mainstream coverage of it
4858120	4863480	is because animal crossing is such a cuckoo bananas meme game right now at this point, like,
4863480	4869320	you know, so many people are playing it, um, that a lot of people are asking, well, what's next for
4869320	4874200	Nintendo? How is Nintendo going to follow up animal crossing? And the answer is we don't
4874200	4878680	really know. Like we know they're working on a breath of the wild too. We don't know when it's
4878680	4883080	coming out. We know that Xenoblade Chronicles, the remaster, and that's going to be awesome.
4883080	4886520	I'm excited about that. That's something that's going to happen by the end of the month,
4886520	4893320	but we don't know like exactly, um, when thank you. Alan's putting coffee down. He knows I need it.
4893880	4899000	Thank you. All right. Um, so we, we, uh, we don't know like when this is happening. So what is
4899000	4905640	Nintendo's plan over the next, you know, a little while. So, um, there was a Nintendo investor Q and
4905640	4912200	a session and, uh, some tweets that relay what a CEO Shuntura Furukawa said, uh, during this
4912200	4917160	event says that there are other undisclosed titles set to be released this year. Hello.
4917160	4920760	We all kind of knew that, right? They usually announce things for the holidays in June. I
4920760	4927240	don't think this is a huge surprise, but the Corona virus pandemic could impact development
4927240	4932360	as developers are currently working from home. Here's a series of tweets from the account
4932360	4938520	Cephason talking about, uh, the relaying from the Nintendo, uh, Q and a session
4939080	4944840	Nintendo president and CEO Shuntura Furukawa says that although the Chinese factory suspended
4944840	4950520	shipments of Nintendo switches in February, Japan faced delays in putting new units on shelves.
4950520	4956200	However, the impact on overall business has been minor so far. He mentions there are other titles
4956200	4960680	they plan to release this year in addition to those already announced. However, it may
4960680	4965640	be difficult to finish development during the current situation as employees are working from
4965640	4973880	home. Their forecast assumes they will release as planned. So that could make the E3 direct or
4973880	4980920	whatever you want to call it. It could make it very interesting, right? Because they may announce
4980920	4985560	games and not tell us when they're coming. And I think that should be something we're fully ready
4986280	4991080	for. Like they're going to announce games, but they're not going to say, Oh, holiday this year
4991080	4995560	or, Oh, it's not happening. Or it's a, you know, quarter one next year. I think they're just going
4995560	5002040	to say coming soon, coming soon, soon, unless it's a game that like already is like, damn,
5002040	5006440	you're done. Like maybe they had some games that are in like, it's going to be out today
5006440	5012760	type of status. Then maybe those games will come out. But I, uh, I don't know. We'll see.
5012760	5018840	So anyway, there you go. Nintendo. Yes, they're working on new games. Of course they are. They
5018840	5023160	were probably going to announce them in June, but this whole situation has screwed everything up.
5023160	5026600	So there you go. In the meantime, please look forward to more Animal Crossing.
5027320	5033320	All right. Let's go back to a classic time and take a step back a little bit. Let's go back to
5033320	5039160	a time when there was no pandemic. Let's go back 10 years or more and visit a classic game of the
5039160	5043400	week. Every week, typically dark soccer will step into the gaming vault and find a game that she
5043400	5047720	thinks, Hey, you guys should check this game out this week. Obviously, as we know, dark soccer is
5047720	5051640	dealing with some more important things this week, so she can't be here to pick the game. Uh,
5051640	5056680	and last week we had Alan pick the game for us, which was really cool this week. Uh, Loki,
5056680	5060360	it's been a while since we've heard from you and had you pick a game in Jamie's absence.
5060360	5063560	I think it's your turn to pick the classic game of the week. So what are you gonna pick for us
5063560	5071880	tonight? So my pick this week is Duke Nukem 3D. Good pick. I, I'm kind of surprised we haven't
5071880	5080360	picked this before. I'm so shocked. All right. Well, there it is. So Duke Nukem 3D was released
5080360	5089480	in on PC, January 29th, 1996, uh, as shareware. And then of course the full version of the game
5089480	5097880	came out later on April 19th. Um, yes. Share were love that stuff. Um, of course there was
5097880	5103160	three campaigns that were included with that, but later on they released a plutonium pack,
5103160	5108280	which is an expansion to the game. They added a fourth campaign as well and some additional
5108280	5114360	things to that. So of course the shareware version of the game, um, you had the first original
5114360	5123400	episode, which was episode one, uh, LA meltdown. And then of course episode two, a lunar apocalypse
5123400	5129560	that was, uh, in the full version. And then episode three shrapnel city. And then in the
5129560	5136040	atomic edition they had episode four, uh, birth. And then one of the things about Duke Nukem was
5136040	5143080	it was pretty cutting edge for the, the game engine. So it was built off of this build 3d
5143080	5149480	engine, which was, um, developed from 3d realms and it could do a lot of things that like doom
5149480	5156520	couldn't do necessarily. Um, so it added a lot of new gameplay features to it. One of the things
5156520	5162520	though with Duke Nukem cause originally Duke Nukem was this old side scrolling, uh, kind of
5162520	5169000	action game, a side scrolling platform game. So they of course, you know, brought it out
5169000	5176520	kind of this ultraviolet crass, uh, game. And so of course it got in trouble with some of the
5176520	5182920	retailers out there for, you know, having pixelated strippers in there or just, you know,
5182920	5190040	poop jokes and bad language and all that kind of stuff. Um, of course one of the main, um,
5190040	5198680	selling points of Duke Nukem is John St. John who voices Duke Nukem himself. And, um, really,
5198680	5207000	I mean, I played a ton of this just, I remember I actually, I own the game, the full version of it.
5207000	5212200	Then I was building levels for it because you could actually use, there was a level editor that
5212200	5217560	was, I think included with the game and you could go in there and like build your own levels out
5217560	5222840	and actually play them in game and play them even in multiplayer. Uh, which it was one of the first
5222840	5227080	games to offer a multiplayer over the internet, which is pretty cool. Of course we always just
5227080	5234600	do it through LAN and, um, yeah, so lots of cool stuff. Uh, some of the other fun things about
5234600	5239400	Duke Nukem was all the different expansion packs you could buy. So this was the kind of thing you
5239400	5243560	would see, you know, in your Babbage's or software, et cetera, or whatever, they would have all these
5243560	5250120	expansion packs where folks would create brand new campaigns that would either, uh, total conversion
5250200	5258040	the game or just add to it. Uh, so they had Duke's Caribbean life's a beach, uh, Duke nuclear winter.
5258040	5265480	I think I had Duke it out in DC and there was a Duke Nukem's penthouse paradise, stuff like that.
5265480	5271800	Um, of course each campaign of the actual game had a lot of parodies of different, uh, pop culture
5271800	5277640	things. So of course, you know, with, uh, the atomic edition, I remember there was a level in
5277640	5283480	there that was very much it's, uh, babe land, which is just like Disneyland. So they even
5283480	5288360	had like a pirates of the Caribbean ride and stuff like that. Of course, you know, there's pig cops
5288360	5293720	everywhere. Um, there's lots of different lines in the game that were drawn from like aliens,
5293720	5300040	dirty Harry evil dead to full metal jacket, jaws, pulp fiction, and they live. Um,
5301080	5306600	there's all sorts of parodies for like Shawshank redemption, uh, 2001 space Odyssey,
5307640	5311560	I mean, it was just full of pop culture references and even some that are kind of
5311560	5318840	dated nowadays, like they have the Exxon Valdez in there, which no one remembers that. Um, but yeah.
5318840	5324680	And then of course, um, even more recently, we just got an episode five alien world order,
5324680	5330360	and that was with the 20th anniversary world tour, uh, that was just released. And of course,
5330360	5336040	Duke Nukem has been released so many times, uh, different console ports. Of course you had it on
5336040	5345560	the Sega Saturn, a total meltdown on PlayStation Duke Nukem 64. There was, um, Duke Nukem on three
5345560	5353400	on the Xbox. It's been on mobile phones and the Nokia, um, PlayStation, you know, it's been
5353400	5357560	everywhere. And then of course they even had some source ports that came out later on. So
5357560	5364440	that's where you get the E Duke, um, and then some other enhancements with that. So it's,
5364440	5368920	it's still pretty, uh, I think there's still quite a bit of content being put out for there
5368920	5373960	and thank God it's, it's actually a pretty great game. I'm like Duke Nukem forever, but
5375640	5381080	I don't know. That's why it's my classic game of the week and definitely well deserved. I think,
5381080	5387400	no, this is, this is a very good pick and, um, I, yeah, it is, it is deserved. I played a shitload
5387400	5390600	of this in college. I know I've told this story on the show before humor me. I'm gonna tell it
5390600	5398280	one more time. Um, of many, uh, I, I played this game in the college dorms a lot in, um, college
5398280	5403320	and we, because we were all in the dorms, every room had their own phone line and everything was
5403320	5407640	connected on the internet via phone back then. So I remember I would play this game and then
5407640	5411640	my neighbor who was also a bit of a computer nerd would sign on and play this game. We would call
5411640	5415880	each other on the dial up and we would play versus, and the other guys in the dorm used to
5415880	5419960	love to like, they would run into one room and see where I'm at and then go run in there and tell
5419960	5425080	them where I'm at and then they do the same thing like vice versa. So it was kind of like a land
5425080	5429480	thing actually in a way, in a weird way, but in the dorm setting, which as you know, is like very,
5429480	5434520	you know, compact and tight. Those dorm rooms are very small. So, uh, yeah, like I have a lot of fond
5434520	5438120	memories of playing this game as a result. And then of course with all the level editors,
5438120	5443720	you know, this was the first Mario maker of sorts, if you will, for some people was kind of like
5443720	5449480	making their own Duke Nukem levels. Um, which Wolf Wolfenstein and Doom kind of went through
5449560	5452040	a similar thing. So it's kind of like all these games around the same time, you know?
5452920	5457480	Yeah. And I, I had actually made some, like I said, some levels in it as well. One of the levels
5457480	5463800	that I made that was kind of ridiculous was this whole, I think I made like this like flooded city
5463800	5468680	thing. And I remember there was one that I made also that was like a big water slide that just
5468680	5474600	looped around. And so one of the things you could do in the game is a raise and lower floors with
5474600	5480280	like the page up, page down keys. There's no limit to how long you can lower that floor.
5480280	5486040	Yeah. So I put a paperweight on the page down and I went and had lunch for an hour and came back
5486040	5490760	and it had like a 15 minute drop in the game, which is hilarious. That's amazing. Um,
5491480	5495720	so yeah, good times. There you go. Uh, there it is your classic of the week, Duke Nukem, which,
5495720	5501480	um, you can easily check out on like steam, like, you know, there's a, or even a Google games has
5501480	5506200	it as well. I mean, there's all sorts of additions that are out there. It's always on sale. Um,
5506200	5510520	there's, I think there's still a lot of people even making modded levels and stuff today. And
5510520	5515560	I am pretty sure there's probably some more fancier versions of Duke Nukem that people
5515560	5523240	are modded in. Like I, I won't, won't be surprised when I see Ray tracing and Duke Nukem three.
5523240	5530120	So, uh, bonds to bonds, double six and chat says, LOL. So Rob invented land in college. No,
5530120	5533960	I didn't invent. I'm not like trying to say I invented the internet. I said it was like
5533960	5541240	land. Uh, and VG realness says, well, she is that old. So it's possible. Rude. Rude as hell.
5541240	5545560	You didn't have to do that. Uh, let's see. Uh, as she went under, Matt says someone made a
5545560	5551400	Duke Nukem level of the dorm floors at school that became a local Fox news, angry parents segment.
5551400	5559000	Oh no, I can, I see it though. I, I, I feel like I tried to recreate a building. I knew in one of
5559720	5563800	the, yeah, we tried to recreate our neighborhood too at one point, but it's, it's hard to,
5563800	5570440	it's hard to, one of the limitations that you had with, um, or the build engine is you can't have,
5570440	5575720	and this may have been just an initial like build stuff. So Duke Nukem era, not necessarily in,
5575720	5581000	um, some of the other games that they made with that, but you couldn't have floors above floors.
5581000	5585000	And so you couldn't really create like a two story house or something like that. You have to have it
5585000	5589560	just solid floors and there's like tricks you could do to kind of like get around some of that
5589560	5595720	stuff. But it, it's still, it was kind of limiting what you could do with it. Now there's further
5595720	5601320	games that made a use of the build engine and enhanced it. So like, I remember redneck rampage
5601320	5608120	was one that I played a lot of and, um, Oh gosh, there was some other games that they use that as
5608120	5613640	well that added more features to it. That's why you have these newer versions of like Duke Nukem
5613640	5619960	or whatever that utilize these more updated, uh, build engines to add a whole lot of features
5619960	5625960	that weren't in the original game in the first place. All right. Lots of, yeah, it's just the
5625960	5630200	way people have expanded on this game over the years and it's still kind of relevant in many
5630200	5634840	ways. It's just, yeah, it's, it's a true classic. I'm glad you picked it. Good job. All right. And
5634840	5638360	even if dark soccer isn't a big fan of first person shooters, I feel like she, she, she,
5638360	5642280	even she can recognize that this is, this is something that is deserving. Hey, at least it's
5642280	5648280	not halo. There's that. All right. Uh, let's move on. We have some rapid fire news, some other
5648280	5653160	things to talk about quickly. Um, and then we'll get back into some more news, lots more news to
5653160	5657960	talk about and, uh, get your, uh, comments in our, uh, just, uh, get your comments on in our chat
5657960	5663720	room over at twitch.tv slash vog network before the night is over. Uh, let's get to the rapid
5663720	5671080	fire news. Loki. So whereas we had, um, Elijah would visiting folks in animal crossing last week.
5671080	5677960	Now we have representative Alexandria, um, Ocasio-Cortez visiting folks in animal crossing
5677960	5683160	as well. Lots of people are getting around in animal crossing. So, uh, that was something
5683160	5688600	that she had posted on Twitter and there's some screenshots of people, you know, having her visit
5688600	5692920	their town and stuff like that. So that's kind of fun. Uh, lots of creative stuff I've been seeing
5692920	5698040	with, uh, animal crossing as well. Just, um, you know, folks even like, uh, we had like,
5698600	5704280	you know, sports teams, like advertising things, um, that were using animal crossing for like,
5704280	5708760	almost like little skits and stuff. So I saw something with like our local Sacramento Kings
5708760	5715480	team and there was one for, um, I can't remember which baseball team it was, but, uh, yeah,
5715480	5719560	good stuff that they have lots of, uh, folks out there. Something else to consider, something else
5719560	5725880	to consider about, um, AOC and, you know, I, I realized she's a very polarizing political figure,
5725880	5730040	whatever, but the thing to remember about politicians, they really are just like us.
5730040	5735400	And, you know, with AOC, she, she likes drag race. She likes video games like animal crossing.
5735400	5740120	She's not that different from a lot of people her age that, you know, I think we know. And I know,
5740120	5743480	again, I've told this story on the show before and I probably don't need to tell it again,
5743480	5747800	but I used to date a politician that ran for office. And trust me, if there's one thing I
5747800	5754680	learned from that relationship, any idiot can run for office. Okay. So, you know, uh, it's,
5754680	5758360	even though it's kind of one of those things was like, Ooh, a politician is playing animal
5758360	5762680	crossing. They're real people. You know, same thing with the celebrities with like Elijah,
5762680	5767640	what they're real people. They're all locked up at home too. So here's something that's pretty great
5767640	5772280	that I saw that, um, someone had offered her to do on there. And I don't know if she took them
5772280	5779800	up on that, but apparently someone has talk show that they set up in animal crossing called animal
5779880	5785960	talking, like a talk show set and stuff like that. And they do like interviews or whatever over,
5786920	5790440	you know, whatever voice chat that they have in there. But I thought that was kind of cute.
5790440	5791560	That's a cute idea. Yeah.
5794760	5799880	Anyway. And then, um, let's see. So aside from animal crossing news, of course, you know,
5799880	5807720	I'm big into the Lego games. And so it leaked out that the Lego star Wars, the Skywalker saga will
5807720	5815240	be coming out October 20th. And that was thanks to a, uh, Disney YouTube channel video that they
5815240	5823080	had for the game. Although it did get pulled. So I don't know if they were jumping the gun on
5823080	5829000	announcing that, but apparently, you know, it is coming out this year. So I wouldn't be surprised
5829000	5837960	to see it, uh, sometime this fall. All right. Well, but there's no star Wars movie this year,
5837960	5843080	right? No, no, no. And this is basically kind of a culmination of like all of the,
5843080	5848280	the whole nine movies. Oh, okay. I gotcha. All right. All right. All right. Well,
5848280	5853640	moving on to some other, uh, news, we have some new modes for bloodstained ritual of the night,
5853640	5858040	the game that is not Castlevania symphony of the night, but it does have some similarities,
5858040	5862840	doesn't it? Uh, there's going to be a big update for bloodstain to coming to the switch in may or
5862840	5867320	June. And I imagine it's coming to other platforms around the same time as well. Uh, the dev team has
5867320	5871640	said, they're looking into locking a release date for this update. And once it's confirmed,
5871640	5877080	they'll have it out there. The details for what's in the update, Zangetsu will become a playable
5877080	5881480	character. And that's going to be a little bit different, uh, because it's, you know, Zangetsu
5881480	5885400	will not have the same type of movement and combat abilities that Miriam has. So it'll be using a
5885400	5889560	sword. So it'll play a little differently. Uh, but then this other mode sounds pretty cool,
5889560	5894040	a randomizer mode. So they're actually going to build an official randomizer into the game
5894040	5897960	where you can adjust eight different parameters of the game to mix up the experience.
5897960	5903800	Uh, you can mix up, save and warp rooms, shops, key items, enemy drops. Uh, that's going to be
5903800	5909480	very interesting. And, uh, I think we'll make for all sorts of fun speed runs for that. So very
5909480	5916360	cool. Uh, and speaking of switch things coming to other consoles, uh, a PlayStation four version of
5916360	5922200	blaster master zero two has apparently been looked at and, or has apparently been spotted
5922200	5926840	on the PlayStation store, like a placeholder for it. So, uh, that has not officially been
5926840	5932920	announced by the developer. Um, but it's been about a year. Again, this is blaster master zero
5932920	5937960	two. So remember they like redid blaster master on the switch and then they did a blast. They
5937960	5946040	did a sequel to the remake basically. And it's pretty good. They did a very good job of those
5946040	5952440	games. Like I, I, I, I hope more people get to play them. So, uh, they came out on PC in steam
5952440	5957800	in November. Uh, it was on the switch in March and now apparently going to be on its way to,
5957800	5963000	um, PlayStation four as well. I wonder if the original will come with it. Cause I don't think
5963000	5967800	the original, the original is on PC and the original was on 3DS as well. Uh, I don't think
5967800	5972680	the original was on, but I could be wrong. I don't think the original was on PlayStation store.
5972680	5976280	So it'd be interesting to see if it's kind of comes in like a combo pack or something. We'll see.
5976840	5981080	So there you go. Some rapid fire news. Let's travel around the world and look at some world
5981080	5988520	release dates or lack thereof. Um, now I have quite a few actually. So let's see. We've got
5988520	5996840	star Wars one, um, racer and that's coming out on Nintendo switch. Um, we have deep rock galactic
5996840	6004360	on PC and Xbox one, two per mega baseball three on PC, Nintendo switch PlayStation four and Xbox one.
6004360	6008600	And I swear to God, I didn't even plan the classic game of the week to go along with this,
6008600	6014840	but I guess the timing is great. So coming from 3d realms, ion theory on Nintendo switch,
6014840	6020120	PlayStation four and Xbox one. This game also uses the build engine that was used in Duke
6020120	6025400	Nukem 3d. Of course, now 20 years later and even more enhanced, but still in that same style of
6025400	6032360	Duke Nukem three, uh, we have Hatsune Miku project, Eva mega mix on Nintendo switch. And that's it.
6033160	6037720	What timing on that? Very good. All right. Uh, going to Japan, which by the way, uh,
6037720	6042440	interesting comment on discord that, um, sheds a lot of light. Cause last week I was kind of like
6042440	6046440	the Japanese releases have kind of dried up. There's not a lot coming out. It was pointed out
6046440	6050520	that the Japanese rating board, remember we talked about a couple of weeks ago on the show. I think
6050520	6055560	it was like the ESRB was working from home or something, but the Japanese one, the CRO,
6055560	6060520	they closed down for a little bit. So that's why we haven't had as many Japanese. They can't rate
6060520	6064760	the games. So that's why we haven't seen as many things. And I would have thought, Oh, well maybe
6064760	6069240	they rated them way out in advance, but it doesn't always happen that way. Um, so thank you. That
6069240	6074840	was a very good call out on discord, but we do have a few things that snuck through, um, this
6074840	6078840	one probably because it's a repackaging maybe they didn't have to re rate it. I don't know,
6078840	6085080	but it's the dragon quest X or dragon quest 10 all in one package versions one through five will
6085080	6090520	come out on the switch this week on may 14th. So that's kinda like a re repackaging. And of course
6090520	6096200	that is also coming out, um, on the PlayStation four, uh, one other minor release this week,
6096200	6102680	AO tennis two on the PlayStation four. Uh, the AO does not mean adults only. Sorry. Uh,
6102680	6108200	that's just the name of it. Uh, and I'm not sure the company behind this, um, but it is like,
6108200	6113320	it's a real, it's like a realistic tennis simulator game is very disappointed. Yeah,
6113320	6117800	no, it is not adults only. Uh, sorry about that, but it does, it looks very realistic,
6117800	6122120	you know, as far as like tennis Sims go. Um, so that's pretty cool there. That's it for
6122120	6125720	Japanese releases and an explanation why we're probably seeing a lot less of them.
6125720	6131320	How about the UK low key? Anything? Not much. Uh, we've got budget cuts coming out on PlayStation
6131320	6139320	VR. Um, the persistence on PlayStation four and also, I'm sorry, we have persistence on
6139320	6147400	X-Box one and intended switch as well. And that's it. All righty. Well, let's get to the mailbag
6147400	6152760	because every week we read your guys's emails participate at orange lounge radio.com is the
6152760	6157160	place to send those emails and we will read them on the show. Of course, usually
6158520	6164680	I should have these emails up in advance, but I didn't do that tonight because I'm an idiot. Um,
6164680	6167880	Oh boy. Now it's telling me the password is invalid. Hold on.
6170600	6172600	Oh fuck. I know I'm getting it right.
6175080	6180200	Oh, help me buy time. Loki. All right. What are you looking forward to an iron maiden?
6180200	6185240	Uh, well, I w I'm just curious to see what the game looks like. There was,
6185240	6189480	I I'm getting confused. There's another one that's also kind of like a retro shooter.
6189480	6194520	That's basically the symbolized or simple pixelized sprites and everything, but they have
6194520	6198120	like advanced lighting with it. And I can't remember if that was iron maiden or another one.
6198120	6203960	I think that's a different one. Um, I'm just, I want to kind of check it out. I need to go back
6203960	6209640	and just play like Duke Nukem and stuff like that. Um, I think when I used to play those
6209640	6214680	originally, I used like the old gravis pads. I never really got into like keyword mouse with
6214680	6220840	that stuff, but I don't know. I'll have to check out and see how that game is. And hopefully it's
6220840	6225720	not too expensive, but great job buying time. Loki. Uh, I got it. All right. Good. Thank you.
6225720	6230920	All right, here we go. Uh, first email tonight from Robert M who emailed us at participate
6230920	6235880	at orangeandrea.com to say little disappointed, but understand the circumstances that we didn't
6235880	6241960	get to hear Jamie reacting to the release of the Neo Geo pocket color game SNK gals fighters on the
6241960	6247640	switch got me to dig out my old unit and change the batteries for the first time in over 15 years.
6247640	6252120	Here's hoping for match of the millennium. Well, unfortunately, you know, with what I said earlier
6252120	6256360	in the show, it probably will be a little bit before dark soccer gets to it. Um, but we will
6256360	6259640	make sure to pass along the message and ask her if she's even, she may not even be aware that it
6259640	6263880	came out on switch, but she would probably also go, well, I could just go play the real thing.
6263880	6268520	So maybe she did this week. You did remind me though, my Neo Geo mini. Yeah. I didn't get
6268520	6271480	around to even using it yet because now I want to order one of the controllers
6272840	6276120	because I don't want to have to play with a tiny little joystick that it came with.
6276120	6280040	It doesn't work. I don't think gals fighters is on it though. Sadly,
6281640	6284120	but thank you for the reminder that it came out on the switch.
6285480	6292680	All right. One more email tonight from Y Y R our power. Y Y R hello. L R when Rob mentioned
6292680	6297240	trying streets of rage four on last week's show, he mentioned that the game had an online co-op
6297240	6304200	for the first time in the series. Well, actually I'm just going to mention the excellent Sega
6304200	6311160	vintage collection streets of rage that released on X-Box three 60 back in 2012. Yeah, I forgot
6311160	6316280	about it. Sorry. Developed by M2. It features both the international and Japanese releases of
6316280	6321400	all three games in the original trilogy, and also features online co-op in all three games.
6321400	6325880	Plus it has a music player, a challenge mode, leaderboards, and all the trimmings you'd find
6325880	6331880	in similar collections. Best of all, it's backwards compatible on X-Box one and only cost $10. So you
6331880	6336040	can enjoy it right now and there's no need to wait for a sale. Anyways, thanks for the show issue. And
6336840	6342200	it's fine. Even though I'm, I'm rolling my eyes a little bit at this. Well, actually that I'm,
6342200	6348120	I'm being explained to right now. Uh, it's, it's fine. I did forget about the release and the
6348120	6352200	minute you kind of like said it, I'm like, Oh yeah, I even played that fucking game.
6352200	6359560	And I totally forgot. So it's fine. Um, I never did online in it. So that's what caused me to forget
6359560	6364680	anyway. Uh, but good call out. Thanks for the show as usual. I'm sure that I can speak for
6364680	6369320	many of the listeners. When I say that we're looking for distractions nowadays, thank you
6369320	6374600	for helping provide a diversion for a few hours every week from the near constant stream of bad
6374600	6379960	news. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Warm regards and well, well wishes Y Y R. Well,
6379960	6384280	thank you for that very kind comment there at the end. Um, we're happy to do so. It gives,
6384280	6388440	it gives me something to look forward to do as well. So it's like, and it's nice because like,
6388440	6392920	since I know I'm going to be on camera, it's like, all right, I'm going to have to put on pants
6392920	6398200	today. I'm going to have to take a shower. I'm going to have to find nice hat to wear to hide
6398200	6403240	all this mess of hair that I have going on right now. So it's, uh, it, it helps me go through the
6403240	6408520	motions, even on a weekend and try to keep some sense of a normal routine. So thank you guys for
6408520	6413480	showing up here and giving a crap and motivating us to do it. We really appreciate it. So
6413480	6419960	participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send your emails in a future week. If
6419960	6425800	you would like to have them read on the show. All right. Uh, bonds double six says, well,
6425800	6431240	actually, Rob, you're wrong. Let me tell you how Rob got mansplained. Yes, I sure did. But you know
6431240	6436920	what? Luckily I know why YR is, is a well-intentioned guy and he's, he's very polite
6436920	6443080	and how he does it. So I, I will allow it to happen this one time. All right, let's move on.
6443080	6449160	Uh, let's get to some more news. Loki, not surprised about this next one, how fast it came and went
6449160	6455960	right. Uh, yeah, not too surprised. So apparently there's been this, uh, project that's been going
6455960	6463720	on for awhile. So it's a recompilation, um, project for Mario 64. So basically they were,
6463720	6468760	um, taking the raw source code for Mario 64. And I don't know, I believe that they were
6468760	6473560	reverse engineering all of that. And then once they got it down to the raw source code, they then
6473560	6482440	use modern compilers to compile the game for other systems, including mainly the PC. So allowing them
6482440	6490440	to basically use, um, you know, DirectX 12 or OpenGL to port the game over to PC where it runs
6490440	6499800	natively with, you know, controller support and widescreen and 4k and stuff like that. So pretty,
6499800	6505160	pretty cool. Unfortunately, like something like that, that would get so much attention.
6505160	6511400	It has been, um, it's being yanked off the internet, uh, thanks to Nintendo and they are
6511400	6516520	seeking their lawyers on these sites that are hosting these files. And apparently they're
6516520	6520920	shutting down YouTube and that kind of stuff as well. Yeah. They're, they're showing folks that
6520920	6527240	are, um, displaying gameplay from it. And so I have a theory, I have a theory on that. I have
6527240	6530200	a theory that goes a little deeper on that, but, but is there something else to this too? You want
6530200	6537480	to mention or, um, no, that's pretty much it really. Um, yeah, that they, they basically had
6537480	6543000	these versions or whatever that were out there. Um, but you know, now you can't do that. Um,
6543720	6549080	I did also find around the same time though, that there was also a web version of Mario 64 that you
6549080	6552600	can play as well, which I thought was pretty cool. And it ran great. I was messing around with that
6552600	6558440	with my, uh, Xbox controller, but that's, that's the one that I looked at. And I thought, I thought
6558440	6562920	at first it was like the same thing, um, which I'm not going to give you the URL, but it's very
6562920	6568680	easily Googleable. So have fun. Um, but, uh, yeah, I was playing that and it was interesting because
6568680	6572120	it suffered a little bit, like it was nice and all, but it suffered a little bit from that same
6572120	6576120	criticism. I had a final fantasy eight earlier where it's like, look at these very lovely
6576120	6581800	textures, like very weirdly put together. That's the same one. Or if that's just like an emulator,
6581800	6586840	that may just be an emulator. I think it is. I think it is. I think it is, but it's so fun and
6586840	6593000	it has saves. And so you can do that, but, um, so let's, sorry, let's talk about Nintendo taking
6593000	6597880	down the YouTubes because I think there's a lot of people going, that's too far. That's stupid. Why
6597880	6604440	are they doing that? Um, go back to those rumors from a couple of weeks ago that Nintendo is
6604440	6610440	planning a Mario onslaught for later this year or next year at this rate. Um, and one of those games
6610440	6616760	that they are talking about is their own HD remaster. Now, certainly, um, if Nintendo is
6616760	6621080	working on their own HD remaster, you can completely understand why they would yank this
6621080	6625400	other version that's being done. They were going to do that anyway, because we know how Nintendo
6625400	6631080	always goes with IP, but why would they go after the YouTubes as well? Because if Nintendo is about
6631080	6636680	to announce their own product, they don't want footage of that other thing getting mistaken for
6636680	6641960	what they're doing. Well, that's my, that's my bet on why they're doing it. They just doing it
6641960	6646440	because they can, I mean, there's no repercussions for them doing that because they've done that in
6646440	6650520	the past about like, remember they used to have the whole thing where you had to sign up with
6650520	6655480	them in order to have YouTube content for any of their games to be, otherwise you just flag it and
6655480	6661080	kick it off the internet. Um, yeah, it very well could be low key, but I feel like it's one of
6661080	6667240	those, they've got their own plans for Mario 64 and they want to control the message and they do
6667240	6670920	not, like, I think that's why they're going a little further with this where I feel like there's
6670920	6677560	other Nintendo projects and weird Nintendo fan things. Like for example, that YouTube of the guy
6677560	6682680	that, God, what was it? He put the Mario cartoon into a Mario game. You remember that from about
6682680	6688840	six months ago? Nintendo didn't shut that down. Yeah. That wasn't something he released.
6689240	6694920	Right. Right. But they didn't yank the YouTube Loki. That's my point. I there's a difference
6694920	6698520	here and like how fast that's just, you know, and again, it might just, you're right. Loki.
6698520	6703960	It might just be Nintendo is just totally controlling their IP. They don't want people
6703960	6708920	to be making money on YouTube off this because they don't have a right to it's a, it's a pirate
6708920	6713000	piece of software. You're right. Loki. That may completely be it. But I just, I can't shake this
6713000	6717880	feeling that the reason why they're doing this so fast and they're doing it so much and stuff on
6717880	6723000	YouTube is because they're about to put their own YouTubes out there of an HD Mario. And they do not
6723000	6729240	want this. Sorry to the developers, but what Nintendo views as a second rate version of the
6729240	6735000	game to get confused with it. And that's why they're yanking the YouTubes. Maybe walk. See,
6735000	6740040	I guess, uh, Bobby Blackwell says if they don't take it down, then a different company can
6740040	6744360	actually do it and make money on it because, well, you didn't shut down that fan's version.
6744360	6749480	Well, for, for the, the actual game itself. Yes. But we've, we've again, I just cited a YouTube
6749480	6755160	project. They never took down. So there's like, I feel like things kind of exist in the YouTube
6755160	6761080	form and these other places that Nintendo doesn't shut down so quickly. If that makes sense.
6761800	6766680	So I don't know. Anyway, uh, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, Disney does the same thing with their
6766680	6771400	IPs. Uh, Rip Cycle says you got to slap down people using your IP or it becomes slippery to
6771400	6776520	defend. Uh, Johnny Wu-Fei says just like the Mario removal in dreams, but there's still Mario
6776520	6783240	stuff in Roblox, right? I'm pretty sure that there there's Mario's there. Roblox has all sorts of IP
6783240	6789720	theft in there. It's it's I don't play Roblox, so I couldn't tell you offhand. I mean, I could boot
6789720	6794680	it up and take a look, I guess, but no, I don't. I'm sure it's there. I'm sure it's there. All
6794680	6801160	right. You know, when anybody is presented with a creator of some sort, someone is going to recreate
6801640	6807080	World 1-1. It's just an iconic piece of level design. It's always going to be copied. So,
6807880	6812760	all right. Anyhow, moving on. Let's, uh, talk about some other stories. Oh,
6812760	6819320	yeah. Y'all want some more rumors? Cause I got some more rumors for you. Uh, rumors outside of EA
6819320	6826040	as to what is happening over there. And, uh, apparently, uh, this is a resource that comes
6826040	6829160	from, actually, I'm just going to go to the original source here. Um, I hate it when I go
6829160	6833560	to a news article and it's just like, here's, we're just rewriting what VentureBeat said about
6833560	6837960	this whole thing or whatever the website is. In this case, it is VentureBeat. Um, so VentureBeat
6837960	6843160	is saying that, uh, EA gave investors an overview of what's coming up for the next fiscal year.
6843160	6848200	So the fiscal year runs from, you know, March to, or April to the end of March. So this is
6848200	6853160	everything through March, 2021. 14 games are apparently in the works, but they are still
6853160	6856360	going to be working on, of course, like apex legends and games that have done very well for
6856360	6861160	them. Those kinds of like always giving types of games. They start to name some of the games,
6861720	6866920	Burnout Paradise Remastered on Nintendo Switch, Command and Conquer Remastered PC,
6866920	6872840	Medal of Honor VR. We know all these games, right? Madden 21, duh, NHL 21, of course,
6872840	6880600	unannounced sports game, an HD remake of an EA game. And then 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 are all
6880600	6886360	EA. Oh, excuse me. 9, 10, 11, 12, our EA partner game, 13, 14, our EA mobile game.
6886360	6892840	And what is really funny about this article, the very last paragraph. Oh, and that HD remaster of
6892840	6897560	an EA game is the Mass Effect trilogy. Just don't expect that to also launch on Switch,
6897560	6901240	just not at first. Oh yeah. And some of these games are coming out for Switch. Like they're
6901240	6905880	saying apex legends, uh, possibly on the Switch and so forth. But it's very funny how they kind
6905880	6909800	of dropped that little bombshell right at the end. By the way, it's totally the Mass Effect
6909800	6918600	trilogy that is the, uh, uh, remastered thing. Um, I have heard this same thing from people I
6918600	6924360	know that know people. So, you know, take, take it what you will. It obviously would also make a lot
6924360	6929800	of sense. I think a lot of fans have been begging for it. Take us back. I'm one of them. Take us
6929800	6933480	back to the Mass Effect we all know and love. I think there's a lot of people that would really
6933480	6938840	love if this came out on the Switch, who knows if it will. Um, for me, I kind of like, well,
6938840	6944920	at this point, I'd like to see it on PlayStation 5 and Xbox One Series X, but if these consoles
6944920	6948600	are going to play the older stuff anyway, then fine, whatever. And it's going to be a very
6948600	6954360	interesting chance to maybe, uh, remake some of the things that were a problem in one.
6954360	6959080	Not that I'm expecting like a full H. I'm just expecting like, you know, kind of like the general,
6959080	6964200	like, uh, zhuzhing up of some of the textures. Like I'm not expecting the game to get completely
6964200	6968680	overhauled. I imagine all the DLC will be included and all that good stuff, but I'm not expecting,
6968680	6974280	like, a huge, huge overhaul, but maybe with the first game, they might have an opportunity to do
6974280	6980440	things like, um, well, they can really clean that one up. Um, that's for sure. It's official HD mods.
6980440	6984680	Basically those of you that have been playing on PC probably already using HD mods. This will just
6984680	6990440	be official HD mods, um, and master, but they can also fix like the, the driving sequences, the
6990440	6995000	Mako. They can fix a lot of that stuff. And a really good one that came up on Twitter that I
6995000	7001320	was like, oh, that's a really good one. They could restore the Kayden romance in one, uh,
7001320	7005720	the same sex romance that they originally cut and all the dialogue is still in the game and
7005720	7010280	people like unpatched it and unlocked it. They could restore that. And I think that would be
7010280	7015320	very interesting, um, to restore that. And maybe, maybe there's some other, um, things that they cut
7015320	7020200	that they could kind of put back in the game like that. So again, I don't know how much time or how
7020200	7025640	much effort they're putting into this, that I don't know. Um, but Mass Effect trilogy, it's
7026200	7031880	almost certain to be announced, um, throughout this summer events with what's going on. So,
7033960	7039800	um, let's see bonds, double six says no Sims news. Uh, they remain committed to the Sims.
7039800	7043960	What is it? The Sims four, right? Is the current one. Uh, and kind of like those always, they,
7043960	7048680	there'll be more Sims expansions. I'm sure, uh, tiger class says knowing Rob, he'll buy this
7048680	7053000	remaster. Like he buys every version of the Mass Effect trilogy. This is like Star Wars all over
7053000	7059480	again with the rereleases. You bet your ass. Uh, as she went on her, Matt says Mass Effect one does
7059480	7064760	need some cleaning up some parts of that don't age well, graphically. It is on an Xbox, Xbox game pass
7064760	7069960	if you want to check it out, but yeah, it, it just, it needs, it just needs a little like the
7069960	7074920	first game is where they could make the most improvements to bring it in line with the second
7074920	7079400	and third games. And I think that would be a very solid trilogy package. And I really hope they keep
7079400	7084360	the multiplayer from three in there. And I would love it if they would, you know, enhance that a
7084360	7088360	little, give us some new enemies to fight in there. Maybe I know this is going to be controversial,
7088360	7092680	but bring in some of the stuff from Andromeda, which I know makes no lore sense whatsoever,
7092680	7096280	but whatever it's multiplayer, bring in some of the stuff from Andromeda to have us fight in the
7096280	7100520	Mass Effect three multiplayer. I think that'd be really fun. So, um, let's see, we'll see,
7100520	7105400	we'll see some of the details. Um, when this inevitably gets announced over the summer
7105400	7110280	and I'm very excited about it. All right. So, uh, Loki, what do you have next for us?
7111400	7119080	Um, okay. So let's see, we've got some information about a Fortnite player who's been banned from
7119080	7124600	playing competitively. Now this Fortnite player was only nine years old and was playing a guest
7125240	7131160	in, uh, was playing arena, which I guess isn't a tournament, but he got banned for being under,
7131160	7137640	I guess the minimum age, which is 13. And he gets, you can think, uh, Coppa for that as well.
7138680	7144040	So I don't know. I know that there's a lot of those like agreements online that especially
7144040	7147080	like if you have social media accounts and stuff like that, you have to sign and says,
7147080	7151880	Oh yeah, you're at age 13 or whatever, because they have rules about advertising to children
7152520	7159240	in there. And so I suppose if you violate that rule, then you could be banned from that stuff.
7159240	7165320	They did ban him for four years, which, uh, based on his age would actually make him 13.
7165320	7170760	So he'd be eligible to enter competitions at the time. Now, um, I just want to say quickly,
7170760	7173720	like, cause that was the first thing that came to my mind too, is that like, okay,
7173720	7177640	even though these headlines are going around, going nine year old gets banned from Fortnite
7177640	7182760	and you know, those are the big flashy headlines and so forth. Um, it kind of made you kind of go,
7182760	7186440	okay, well considering kids are not supposed to do things online until they're 13 anyway,
7186440	7190120	or companies aren't supposed to have that because of the CCOPA law, it makes sense.
7190120	7193240	And it's not as sensationalist as a lot of blogs are making it out to seem,
7193240	7197000	but Jason and I were texting a little bit before the show and Jason kind of brought up the point
7197000	7203160	that like, actually you can go around it with parental permission. And it sounds like the
7203160	7208440	parents want him to be a part of that, but I could, I could see a place where maybe
7208440	7212920	Epic has a company policy where like they just, they don't want to deal with permission slips.
7213480	7219000	So they just have a policy of 13 or older and that's it. And that's part of what you agree to
7219000	7224360	when you sign up for the game. I don't, again, I'm, I'm admittedly, I'm not an expert on Fortnite
7224360	7229400	and I certainly didn't read the end user license agreement in it. Um, so, but that's just a theory,
7229400	7235480	I guess, that I would have. Yeah, possibly. I mean, I don't know. I would imagine that
7235480	7241640	there's probably similar guidelines for like other games out there, like, uh, Roblox and stuff,
7241640	7248200	but that doesn't stop my kids from playing it. So I don't know. I was trying to see, uh,
7248200	7253720	considering how providers have to treat COPPA, uh, allowed users data as special, Epic could also
7253720	7258200	decide that they just won't bother and not allow the user due to not being able or willing to
7258200	7261560	fulfill the requirements of the terms. Yeah. I imagine the vast majority of everyone not
7261560	7265960	specifically expecting children under the age of 13 as users do this. Yeah. That's kind of,
7265960	7270200	that's kind of where my brain is at is that they just don't, again, that was a text from Jason.
7270920	7275080	That, um, that's kind of where I think Epic is at with this is that they just, they just don't want
7275080	7280840	to bother with it. So they're not going to let you play till you're 13. Yeah. Yeah. And considering
7280840	7285800	it is kind of a shooty, shooty, bang, bang game of sorts, maybe they just don't want to get into,
7285800	7289160	I mean, they probably are well aware that kids are playing it, but it's not something they want
7289160	7294200	to officially acknowledge. You know, even if it's cartoony, it might just be a little bit, you know,
7294200	7300360	but puts them in a bad light, I suppose. I don't know. So yeah. All right. Too bad, but I guess
7300360	7306280	they'll have to go play something else. All right. Well, meanwhile, uh, let's talk about cyberpunk
7306280	7310760	updates. So cyberpunk 2077, of course, that's going to be a huge release this summer. We all
7310760	7314760	know that, right? Uh, what are the big headlines for this? Well, there's a couple of things.
7314760	7318600	Number one, it's going to get its own event in June, which isn't very surprising.
7318600	7322840	We knew it was going to be an all star game at the E3 that would have hypothetically happened
7322840	7327640	this year. Although now, obviously with that all getting, uh, tabled because of everything else
7327640	7332360	going on in the world, cyberpunk is going to do their own online event. Uh, that's going to happen
7332360	7337880	in June and they're calling it night city wire, and it's going to happen on June 11th. So that is
7337880	7343240	just, I guess the teaser that's happening. Uh, I imagine that it's going to be the gameplay trailer
7343240	7348040	that we probably would have seen at E3, right? That's yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's going to be
7348040	7352520	probably some more gameplay. Like, I mean, they've already shown quite a bit of gameplay
7352520	7357640	and that scene. Now that stuff was actual gameplay. Like you watched them playing the
7357640	7364680	actual game. Like that is a gameplay trailer. What we saw, not a gameplay trailer that is an
7364680	7371000	engine trailer. Now, um, I'm surprised. I'm sure no one is surprised that cyberpunk 2077 has been
7371000	7379480	rated M for mature. Okay. Yeah. Let's talk about why. Um, because of all the nudity and the extreme
7379480	7385640	violence. Here's the summary. Some locations depict mutilated corpses with open chest cavities
7385640	7390680	and or exposed organs and entrails. During one quest, players assist a character by hammering
7390680	7394760	nails through his hands and feet, screaming sounds and blood effects accompany the scene.
7395320	7401960	Wow. Uh, that is something very interesting. And also players can select a gender and customize
7401960	7408600	their character. Customization can include depictions of breasts, buttocks, and genitalia,
7408600	7415160	as well as various sizes and combinations of genitals. So we will leave it to your imagination,
7415160	7421480	just how free the character customization will be. Did it first? Yes.
7421480	7425480	Yes. Did you just Simpsons did it this whole thing?
7428680	7435720	But I have a sexy sexiness meter in saints row. Like if, if you slide at the female or whatever,
7435720	7439480	it just made your boobs bigger. If you slide the male and made your package bigger. Yeah. So
7439480	7443720	anyway, it's I, and again, we don't know the specifics. We just know what's coming from the
7443720	7449880	ESRB. So it does sound like things are going to be highly customizable in the game, which you know
7449880	7457240	what? Cool. You know, uh, people lose hours and hours in character creation mode. Me I'm at the
7457240	7461400	point where I'm just like, I'm going to select a pre-selected character and then pick the hair I
7461400	7467320	want and just go from there. That's, that's how I make my characters in game now in games. Now I
7467320	7471880	just find the pre-selected character. Then I change it to, uh, the hair I like. That's it.
7472520	7476120	But other people are going to spend hours and hours and the customizer doing
7476120	7482680	every possible combination they can think of. So have fun. All right. Let's get to the listener
7482680	7487320	round table. So you guys can ask us some questions in our chat room. If you'd like over at twitch.tv
7487320	7492200	slash vog network, VOG network. Uh, if there's anything you'd like us to bring up or discuss
7492200	7496760	here on the program, we can do that. Otherwise I'll look to Loki to buy us a little time with
7496760	7502840	some last minute stories. Yes. And I do have a few things. So, um, apparently there's some
7502840	7512520	old phone games that you can play for free. So Gameloft classics 20 years is a collection of
7512520	7521320	30 old phone games. Some from back in 2007 that are now playable on Android devices.
7522600	7530120	What old ass games are there besides snake? Uh, gang star, modern combat. Um,
7530120	7537640	I don't know. These old ass games. I remember on my old ass sprint flip phone that I had that
7537640	7542600	like had the color screen. You remember that guy? Um, it like had a really shitty camera in it too.
7542600	7546120	And you could take selfies on it. Cause I had like that front screen that was really bad.
7546120	7551800	Um, so, okay, here we go. It had games like color games on it. Like there was like a Castlevania
7551800	7557320	port on that thing. It was really bad. Not sure if you would know most of these titles here,
7558280	7563800	but, um, these are, they have them broken up by genre puzzle fun, run and gun life and love
7563800	7569800	arcade action and sports and cards. So some of the titles we have here, we have, um,
7570360	7577560	date or ditch to high school hookups, modern combat to black Pegasus gang star to Kings of LA
7578120	7583320	zombie would alien quarantine. Uh, I don't know any of this shit. I don't, I don't know any of this
7584280	7593560	generic stuff. Um, yeah, so neat that that's out there and you can play it for free. So
7594280	7597480	go check it out. If you have an Android phone, I guess, I don't know if it's on iOS, but
7598680	7603800	it's on Android at least. I probably will not get on that anytime soon,
7603800	7605960	especially cause I don't recognize any of those games you mentioned.
7605960	7615160	Um, anything else? Uh, yeah, well there is a video that I guess, um, was in a video that
7615160	7620200	was published regarding some technology that's showing like hand tracking. That's going to be
7620200	7626360	used in Sony's new VR controllers. And they were showing off, uh, apparently there's a paper that
7626360	7633000	was uploaded to upload VR as well. Uh, talking about how that's working. It says evaluation
7633000	7638360	of machine learning techniques for hand pose estimation on handheld device with proximity
7638360	7644920	sensor. Yes. Those, those research papers that have such, you know, fancy titles and the video
7644920	7650840	shows like some pretty awesome hand tracking on what looks like a really old school looking
7650840	7656200	controller, but obviously it's meant for just the hand tracking and stuff, but it's very, um,
7657400	7661480	very accurate to pretty much any pose you can make with your hands. So
7662040	7666360	pretty neat via interesting to see how that is incorporated into a new VR controller.
7667800	7675560	Anything's better than the move. All right. Anything else? Our chats being pretty quiet
7675560	7679480	when it comes to questions or comments, which is fine. I know there's a lot of other stuff going
7679480	7682920	on in the world, by the way, cause I forgot to mention at the top of the show, cause I had some
7682920	7687720	other housekeeping I needed to get, um, uh, talk about, but I do want to wish all of our mothers
7687720	7692200	out there a happy mother's day. Uh, whether, um, you're a mom yourself or you want to go
7692200	7696600	wish your mom a happy mother's day or, you know, motherly figure, you know, uh, pet,
7696600	7700600	pet moms and so forth. You know, if, if you believe this day applies to you, then happy
7700600	7709480	mother's day to you. Yeah. I got, I got nothing really else to talk about, I guess.
7709480	7716840	All right. Straight up out of news, I guess. Okay. Some questions here. Uh,
7716840	7720280	Sia Tabiri in chat says, okay, so I've been enjoying murder by numbers,
7720280	7725320	the P cross investigation game, any fun crossover genre games you enjoy?
7726120	7731000	Ooh, wow. Crossover genre games. I'm stumped in the moment trying to think of anything.
7731720	7735880	I don't really play it anymore, but puzzle quest is pretty cool.
7735880	7740200	Oh yeah. Puzzle quest is awesome. They have a free version of that on steam.
7740200	7743960	And I don't remember the name of it, but like that, that whole model kind of went free to play
7743960	7748680	sometime ago. Cause like there was, there was the Marvel puzzle quest. That was the first free to
7748680	7752440	play one I could think of. And now there's a more traditional one. That's all, uh, it's all free to
7752440	7758280	play now. I used to like back in the Android and this is a pretty old game, but, uh, swords and
7758280	7766760	poker, which is pretty fun. Um, um, trying to think of what else is kind of cool.
7766760	7769800	I always, I don't know if this is considered like John, but I always liked when they did
7769800	7774920	like the puzzle game that the platformer folks would show up in like Yoshi's cookie.
7775480	7781080	And we were talking earlier about like Puyo Puyo, but with Sonic and with Yoshi and some of those
7781080	7785480	like crossover. I don't know if that really is the genre bending that you're looking for, but
7785480	7789400	that's that comes to my mind where it's like platformers crossed with puzzler.
7790600	7795880	Actually, yeah, actually Yoshi's cookie was like a way better, um, puzzle game than that for me
7795880	7800520	than I think most people gave it credit for. Um, I also really enjoyed Pokemon puzzle league,
7801320	7805960	which is another one of those, which was Tetris attack, but with Pokemon. So there's that.
7805960	7813880	Yeah. Um, I think what else? Uh, we've got some other questions here and these are some good,
7813880	7818280	good ones here. Um, as Joe and Hunter, Matt says thoughts on the final fantasy seven remake part
7818280	7823400	two being in the early stages. Do you think it will get fast tracked because of the big success
7823400	7830680	of the first part? I can't believe it's only in the early stages. Come on. Like what what's taken.
7830680	7835320	So like I cannot, but this game should already be like, I guess maybe they didn't, they, they knew
7835320	7839960	it was a risk and they were worried that the game wasn't going to do well or something. I just
7839960	7845000	worry that this game is going to take forever now, but maybe now that the engine is done and they
7845000	7850200	have a process, maybe it won't take that long. Cause the final fantasy 13, two was only what,
7850200	7857000	like two years after the first one. So fingers and toes crossed, but I'm, I am a little shocked. Like
7857000	7864840	they're just now starting it like, yeah, I would have thought it was, yeah. Well, it, like I said
7864840	7870600	before, I think it's, um, less development time for this one because they've already got the
7870600	7874440	engine built now for everything and they've got it kind of working the way they want it to. And
7874440	7880280	it's now basically developing the content for it. Um, so some of that's going to be kind of,
7880280	7884120	I mean, they've got the characters modeled and everything and some of the environments already.
7884120	7889960	So I would imagine that the turnaround time for developments can be much smaller, but yeah,
7889960	7894600	I would think that. I hope they've already, I would hope so too. Cause I think final fantasy
7894600	7899480	13 was challenged in development a lot. Like they, they, I know they changed the platform
7899480	7903720	they were using to develop it partway through. So I'm hoping that like now it's all kind of set
7903720	7908920	that, that they can kind of turn around a part to a faster cause like, obviously if they, if they
7908920	7913080	wait five or seven years or however long it took us to get found messy seven remake, like that's
7913080	7917480	just not going to work. So hopefully they can get it turned out in two to three. Um, but then,
7917480	7921480	you know, you start to look at, well, how many parts is final fantasy seven going to be?
7921480	7926600	And honestly, the answer is we don't know. There's too many people that are quick to assume,
7926600	7931080	Oh, well, because there's, it's only takes you like a third of the way through the first disc.
7931080	7937880	There's going to be like six different games to which I say, that's not how it works.
7938760	7945080	That's all I can say. So we don't know how many parts it could be. It could be just two parts.
7945080	7949880	It could be three parts. It could be seven parts. We just don't know. Anyway. Um,
7949880	7954040	I was going to say, kind of go back to that first question. A crypto necro dancer would be,
7954040	7957160	Oh, that's a good one for genre bending game. Yeah. That's a good one. I like that.
7958040	7962280	Good. Good. Yeah. That's good. Those types of games that are like they're rogue likes,
7962280	7967160	but they're this too. What was the trailer for? Like somebody passes on Twitter. It was like a
7967160	7974120	shooter slash music game slash rogue like. Yeah. So I've got a few of those in my wishlist. So
7975080	7980520	there's gun jam is one of those in BPM bullets per minute is another one. That was it bullets
7980520	7987320	per minute. So anyway, yeah. I think gun jam is one where you have to like shoot in rhythm with,
7987320	7992200	um, there's like a thing that comes up the screen and almost like guitar heroes, something like
7992200	7997640	that. Um, and then same with, uh, one of them is just shooting. The other one is like shooting
7997640	8003480	and movement and everything is all done in time. So I don't know. It's pretty cool. Um,
8004360	8010120	Ziba in our chats asks, did you guys talk about the final fantasy 11 mobile rumors screenshots?
8011080	8015880	Excuse me. I don't want to talk about it. Mobile rumors, screenshots, disappointed that it's
8016520	8023720	not coming out. Ziba. I did see the pictures and it does look really good. Like in HD. Um,
8023720	8028680	at least the few screenshots we saw. And when I see that stuff, I can't help but feel overwhelming
8028680	8033800	disappointment that it's going to be on mobile. And that's just the, like, I'm just like, I,
8033800	8038920	I still do not understand how this game is going to translate to mobile. And that's like that key
8038920	8043320	missing piece for me. And until I understand that it's so hard for me to get excited.
8043320	8048760	Cause honestly I see those screenshots and I'm like, why can't you just make a new PC client
8048760	8055960	with that? Why does they want you to go to 14? I don't know. So that's, that's the part where
8055960	8060360	I'm struggling. I guess it's all a rumor anyway. Maybe we were supposed to find out more at E3
8060360	8065320	this year. Maybe we still find out, we'll find out more in the summer. I did see that screenshot
8065320	8070840	that they had of Winhurst or whatever, where I thought that was a fan, like that they were up
8071480	8076040	grading the game, like the client for the game or something like that. I thought that was a fan
8076040	8080120	mod or something like that when I saw it originally, but I didn't realize that was a
8080120	8084760	screenshot from the actual mobile game. Act-deft in chat says maybe it'll get ported over to the
8084760	8089800	switch. Um, you know, that's some mobile games do end up on the switch like that. So I guess
8090600	8096120	even if we're talking about a mobile game, it isn't impossible that it ends up on consoles.
8096120	8100600	For example, the, um, you know, that game I really liked last year, that Sayonara wild hearts,
8101400	8105240	that game that's very artistic and flair and the music's very good. That's a mobile game,
8105800	8110360	but it, they put it on consoles too. It's just a very simple control scheme, right? It's just one
8110360	8116360	button instead of tapping the screen. So, um, I suppose anything's possible with that, but all we
8116360	8120200	have right now are rumors. All we have is what they've told us. And that is that they plan to
8120200	8126040	do 11 on mobile. We don't know anything beyond that yet, but honestly switch would make a lot
8126040	8136360	of sense. So you joke, but dot, dot, dot anyway. Uh, let's see one more here. Um, cheeseburger
8136360	8143480	94 in chat says what's this newfangled twatch chat. And what happened to the gold old IRC chat?
8143480	8147160	Oh, you must've, you, you clearly haven't been here in about a year and a half. Yes.
8147160	8155400	We moved to Twitch, um, in December of 2018. And a big part of that was that, um, well, number one,
8155400	8160680	more and more shows are moving to Twitch. Um, because Twitch has more discoverability,
8160680	8165720	Twitch is very easy to have, um, uh, like the mobile app, the PlayStation four app,
8165720	8168920	uh, a lot of gamers know what you're talking about when you talk about Twitch. And so it's
8168920	8175400	very easy to find us and discover us on Twitch. And the reality was as much as we loved shoutcast
8175400	8181000	and being like MP3 radio and all that number one, we were paying quite a bit of money to
8181000	8187000	run that feed and host that feed. Number two, people aren't discovering shoutcast feeds and
8187000	8191240	all that the same way they're discovering Twitch. And honestly, and I know, you know,
8191240	8195960	anytime you maybe make a big change with the show, people are going to say, but I like the old way.
8195960	8201880	But the reality is like our number, our listening numbers would still decline, decline, decline.
8201880	8206200	And it's not all about the listener numbers, but at the same time, it's like, if we're only,
8206200	8210360	you know, there's going to come a point where like, if literally nobody's listening, then
8210360	8215960	we're going to be like, all right, well, I don't know. You know, so moving to Twitch has
8215960	8221080	helped our audience grow a little bit. And some new people have found us because of that. And
8221080	8227880	that's been a great thing. And we get to broadcast this show for free. If you miss the audio thing,
8228840	8232920	two things you can always listen to the podcast feed that hasn't changed. And number two,
8232920	8236200	the Twitch client, and this is another thing I really like about it on the mobile phone,
8236200	8240520	Twitch has an audio only mode. A lot of people don't know that it's there, but if you go into
8240520	8243640	your settings, you can make it audio only. So if you don't want to look at my ugly mug,
8243640	8247400	you don't have to. You can switch it into audio only mode. And that's, that's totally fine.
8247400	8251560	And if you don't want to look at my ugly mug, well, you're in luck for the next few months.
8251560	8256680	Yeah. Pod Culture says, I missed the Skype line. Well, again, things have to change.
8256680	8262120	We were paying for Skype. More gamers know what Discord is in this day and age. Skype was having
8262120	8269320	a lot of conflicts and errors and issues. And you know, there's, I missed the old Skype. I'm going
8269320	8277800	to leave. That's my retort. I miss Skype too, the old Skype. So anyway, let's see. Pixel Paca says,
8277800	8282360	the only problem with Twitch is that my Australian friend cannot watch live very well. Almost all
8282360	8287320	Twitch streams constantly buffer for her, but you can do audio only or get the podcast later. Yes,
8287320	8292920	that's very true. And I imagine if the shout cast probably would have buffered a little bit as well,
8293480	8297720	that far away. Who knows? But yeah, audio only will help cut back a lot and make it a little
8297720	8302040	more, especially if you're in, you know, I don't know where in Australia your friend lives,
8302040	8305720	but if it's somewhere where the internet connection isn't as strong, then the audio only
8305720	8310680	will probably help a little bit of that. Yeah. SG100Matt says, they don't miss the constant
8310680	8315560	battle every time Skype had an update that would bork something else. It's that, unfortunately,
8315560	8321080	it is very much that. And we know that a lot of gamers have embraced Discord right now. I'm not
8321080	8326280	saying Discord is going to be the only way to do it forever. I remain open to other ideas,
8326280	8331400	but we'll see. All right. Anyway, thank you. Great questions tonight for the round table.
8332040	8335320	Any other last minute stories we didn't get to, Loki, that you want to mention before we wrap up?
8335320	8339160	No, that's it. All right. Then I guess that means we wrap up. So that's going to do it for another
8339160	8343240	episode of Orange Lounge Radio tonight. Thank you. Of course, everybody here, whether you were live
8343240	8347800	on glorious video or whether you were here for the pod or for just the audio only on Twitch,
8347800	8351400	or whether you're here on the podcast feed, no matter how you consume Orange Lounge Radio,
8351400	8356120	we thank you for being a part of it. And you could help us out a lot by spreading the word
8357080	8360600	because we are the show where every gamer has a voice. But if the voices aren't here to put out
8360600	8367800	on air, then we don't get them. Also, an auto host here on Twitch on your own channel for
8367800	8373480	VOG Network. So helpful. I can't even tell you. The power of hosting and rating is really great
8373480	8378120	on Twitch. So we really appreciate all of that. And of course, a big thanks to anybody who followed,
8378120	8382360	subscribed or rated or anything like that tonight. I will acknowledge all you guys after
8382600	8388200	we're done recording the podcast for tonight. Just thank you for showing up and being here. And
8388200	8393320	thanks again to all the gamer moms out there. And hope you had a great Mother's Day today.
8394360	8398200	Let's get to final thoughts. Final, final thought. Loki, your final thought tonight.
8398840	8405640	So my final thought is I was told by my work that we're not going back. They're not even
8405640	8410680	considering us the conversation about going back until at least September 1st.
8411480	8414280	So I'm going to be working from home for a long time.
8415080	8419800	Yeah. And I don't know how long OLR is going to do the distance thing as well. I miss being in
8419800	8425560	studio with everybody. But it's really, it's one of those when the scientists say it's safe,
8425560	8431160	then we'll do it. Until then, we will follow the rules. And that's that. And even then,
8431160	8437720	I kind of don't want to force Loki or Jamie to have to be here in person for a good period
8437720	8441880	after that while we kind of like make sure everything is good, if that makes sense. I'm
8441880	8450760	sure you can all understand that. So yeah. With that, my final thought is it was a shorter show
8450760	8455960	than usual tonight. But that leaves me more time to go play games. Maybe I can sell stuff at Nook's
8455960	8460360	before they close for the night. That'll be good. All right. Have a great week, everybody. Happy
8460360	8464360	gaming. We will see you here in seven days. Again, we're sending a lot of love to DarkSakra
8465320	8470280	and her friends and family. We'll see you next week to talk more about games.
8470280	8471640	Have a good week, everybody. Good night.
8490360	8494680	The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those
8494680	8500680	of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.
8503720	8505720	See you next week.
