00:00.000 --> 00:19.000
This week Xbox Game Pass, the Netflix of Xbox and PC games crosses 10 million subscribers.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.240
On the cusp of a new gaming generation, PS Now and Game Pass seem to be settling in to

00:22.240 --> 00:23.240
change game purchasing.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.960
This is just one headline from the week's news, stay tuned for more, starting right

00:25.960 --> 00:32.320
now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:32.320 --> 00:35.760
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.760 --> 00:40.920
where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number

00:40.920 --> 00:45.240
818 for this May the 3rd of 2020.

00:45.240 --> 00:50.220
My name is Rob Roberts and I am all alone here in Studio N7 because like many folks

00:50.220 --> 00:54.080
in the world, we're doing the social distance thing right now so I'm here to talk about

00:54.080 --> 00:59.760
video games and on Discord are my pals DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.720
I'm emotionally distant.

01:01.720 --> 01:06.920
Emotionally distant, well glad you're able to get close enough to do the show tonight

01:06.920 --> 01:07.920
with us.

01:07.920 --> 01:11.440
How's your week been?

01:11.440 --> 01:22.080
It's been, I'm back at work, mostly able to finish a day so not too bad, I got a rotation

01:22.080 --> 01:29.240
that will hopefully lead to a full promotion so I start training on tomorrow and I'm nervous

01:29.240 --> 01:32.040
sighted about it.

01:32.040 --> 01:35.400
It's progress at least, glad to hear that things have been improving since I know you

01:35.400 --> 01:38.720
were really sick and congratulations once again on the promotion.

01:38.720 --> 01:41.560
I think we talked a little bit about that last week but congrats again.

01:41.560 --> 01:42.560
All the same.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.560
Thanks.

01:43.560 --> 01:47.360
Hey, I know one thing I wanted to ask you about was, because you talked about it weeks

01:47.360 --> 01:51.720
ago on the show, your apocalypse garden that you've decided to start amongst this whole

01:51.760 --> 01:56.680
thing because I have to admit, I don't know if it's Animal Crossing or what, but all of

01:56.680 --> 02:01.800
a sudden I've been like, I need to try to grow more flowers and all this stuff and I'm

02:01.800 --> 02:03.400
just like, ooh, gardening.

02:03.400 --> 02:06.220
So how's that going for you?

02:06.220 --> 02:07.680
It's going pretty well.

02:07.680 --> 02:13.980
Of course, some of my seedlings died, my tomatoes all died because I need a shadier place to

02:13.980 --> 02:14.980
put them in.

02:14.980 --> 02:17.720
Oh, I hit the wrong button.

02:17.720 --> 02:21.360
Anyway, I have a spinach that survived.

02:21.520 --> 02:25.440
I have two rainbow carrots that survived.

02:25.440 --> 02:28.960
I have four cucumbers.

02:28.960 --> 02:32.780
One of them isn't doing so well.

02:32.780 --> 02:36.460
I have some chives.

02:36.460 --> 02:39.080
I have my shiso finally died.

02:39.080 --> 02:41.280
I feel bad about it because it was delicious.

02:41.280 --> 02:50.520
And actually, I have basil that's now potted and I would gladly leave one or two on your

02:50.560 --> 02:51.560
doorstep.

02:51.560 --> 02:54.560
Oh, that's a long trip, though, for that.

02:54.560 --> 02:56.560
No, we'll see.

02:56.560 --> 03:00.760
Quickly, just going to our chat room, because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night

03:00.760 --> 03:04.240
at the voice geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network.

03:04.240 --> 03:07.600
We're on live Sundays at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby

03:07.600 --> 03:09.120
Black Wolf show.

03:09.120 --> 03:11.380
And fifth dream today in our chat is saying, I'm like, what?

03:11.380 --> 03:12.840
There aren't tomatoes in Animal Crossing.

03:12.840 --> 03:16.740
No, believe it or not, we're talking about like real gardening, because what's interesting

03:16.740 --> 03:21.220
how sometimes it may take a video game to kind of make you think about, oh, I should

03:21.220 --> 03:22.700
like do this IRL.

03:22.700 --> 03:26.540
And I'm not saying necessarily dark soccer was inspired by well, I shouldn't speak for

03:26.540 --> 03:27.540
you.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.980
Were you inspired in part by Animal Crossing for gardening?

03:29.980 --> 03:31.100
Really?

03:31.100 --> 03:36.220
I had wanted to try my hand at vegetables and I've grown tomatoes and cucumbers before.

03:36.220 --> 03:39.100
And Dan was kind of on a pickle kick for a little bit.

03:39.100 --> 03:45.620
So I decided just to start growing things I had already ordered the seeds before Animal

03:45.620 --> 03:47.740
Crossing was out.

03:47.740 --> 03:53.980
And I had I actually had them in the sprouting container.

03:53.980 --> 03:58.700
I want to say like, I put them in to sprout them like a day before Animal Crossing came

03:58.700 --> 04:00.260
out.

04:00.260 --> 04:03.900
And Bobby Black Wolf is going to take that back before that it was well before that Bobby

04:03.900 --> 04:07.100
Black Wolf is reminding us that the tomato update is next month in Animal Crossing.

04:07.100 --> 04:12.420
Well, I mean, if leaks are to be believed, which leaks so far here, right, but a bump

04:12.420 --> 04:18.140
pun, if the leaks are to be believed, we will be getting vegetables in Animal Crossing.

04:18.140 --> 04:20.380
We don't know when we're waiting for Nintendo to confirm it.

04:20.380 --> 04:23.940
And everything should be considered a rumor until Nintendo confirms it.

04:23.940 --> 04:26.500
But it would seem it would seem likely.

04:26.500 --> 04:30.540
And I think we had a story last week on the show that Animal Crossing has a path for regular

04:30.540 --> 04:32.480
updates for some time.

04:32.480 --> 04:35.200
And it would make a lot of sense for sure for that game.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.460
So why not bring on the vegetables?

04:37.460 --> 04:39.660
The coding hasn't lied so far.

04:39.660 --> 04:40.660
Yeah.

04:40.700 --> 04:45.420
I'm completely correct about Red being on a ship.

04:45.420 --> 04:48.860
Yeah, which isn't something you might be able to guess otherwise, because that was new.

04:48.860 --> 04:50.940
He wasn't on a ship before.

04:50.940 --> 04:51.940
Exactly.

04:51.940 --> 04:56.260
And the little bit of coding about Rover, we saw how that worked out this week.

04:56.260 --> 04:57.260
Mm hmm.

04:57.260 --> 04:58.860
So, so you're saying.

04:58.860 --> 04:59.860
All right.

04:59.860 --> 05:02.780
Well, also joining us, of course, right now via Discord.

05:02.780 --> 05:04.180
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

05:04.180 --> 05:05.180
Hello.

05:05.180 --> 05:06.180
Hi, Loki.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.180
How are you doing?

05:07.180 --> 05:08.180
I'm fine.

05:08.180 --> 05:09.180
Yeah.

05:09.700 --> 05:10.700
Go ahead.

05:10.700 --> 05:12.700
I was going to say, you feel tired.

05:12.700 --> 05:17.700
Oh, you know, like it's it's I've been reading up on this because it's been doing a number.

05:17.700 --> 05:19.980
This whole quarantine thing has been doing a number on me as well.

05:19.980 --> 05:23.340
And I've I've been trying to go out and like be more active and stuff and actually make

05:23.340 --> 05:25.100
sure I'm walking every day and that sort of thing.

05:25.100 --> 05:28.340
But I still like I just I'm so freaking tired.

05:28.340 --> 05:31.500
But there is there is a science to it.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.580
There's reasons why, like, you know, some of the things that your body's kind of going

05:34.580 --> 05:40.700
through is you are in general just kind of not being as active if for some reason just

05:40.700 --> 05:42.220
kind of like makes you tired.

05:42.220 --> 05:43.980
So like, I feel you.

05:43.980 --> 05:44.980
I'm right there.

05:44.980 --> 05:51.820
I take I had I had a day a couple of weeks ago where I took three naps like it.

05:51.820 --> 05:52.820
It's crazy.

05:52.820 --> 05:53.820
Right.

05:53.820 --> 05:54.820
I remember those times.

05:54.820 --> 05:55.820
All right.

05:55.820 --> 05:56.820
Yeah.

05:56.820 --> 05:57.820
That's true.

05:57.820 --> 05:59.860
I don't have kids, but I do have Mr. Smoosh.

05:59.860 --> 06:03.060
And believe me, he will wake you up as well.

06:03.060 --> 06:06.940
Any projects you've been working on in this, you know, quarantine time?

06:06.940 --> 06:08.500
No, not really.

06:08.500 --> 06:09.500
Yeah.

06:09.500 --> 06:10.500
Yeah.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.140
I didn't really work on my game this week too much.

06:13.140 --> 06:16.940
Just by the time I get, you know, after that day, like working and everything, it's just

06:16.940 --> 06:17.940
like I'm just drained.

06:17.940 --> 06:21.020
I can't concentrate enough to like actually do programing and stuff.

06:21.020 --> 06:27.020
And normally I would leave that to like one of the weekends, weekend days, I guess.

06:27.020 --> 06:32.100
So I had done everything that I normally would spread out across two days yesterday.

06:32.140 --> 06:36.060
And I was hoping to get that done today, but then it just didn't happen because I ended

06:36.060 --> 06:39.820
up having to help me some with his like school project.

06:39.820 --> 06:44.940
And then I cooked meatball subs.

06:44.940 --> 06:47.420
So I had to make garlic bread and stuff like that.

06:47.420 --> 06:48.900
So I don't know.

06:48.900 --> 06:49.900
OK.

06:49.900 --> 06:52.380
So Chef Loki is still a thing because it's actually being asked in chat.

06:52.380 --> 06:56.820
Gripper 02 in chat is asking, so is Loki making his own pizzas now?

06:56.820 --> 06:59.700
But, you know, cooking with Loki is still a thing.

06:59.700 --> 07:05.620
I could, but like I just haven't been doing anything like that.

07:05.620 --> 07:10.180
We ordered out this week a little bit, so we did that a few times.

07:10.180 --> 07:15.660
But no, I haven't been able to make pizzas, but I've been like cooking a lot of things

07:15.660 --> 07:17.100
like a few things each week.

07:17.100 --> 07:18.100
Yeah.

07:18.100 --> 07:19.100
Yeah.

07:19.100 --> 07:21.860
We have to eat out here and there too, just to kind of break the monotony of cooking at

07:21.860 --> 07:22.860
home.

07:22.860 --> 07:24.900
And it's a fine line to get.

07:24.900 --> 07:27.840
Like we have to do like a little bit of everything because I'm kind of like it's so much cheaper

07:27.840 --> 07:29.580
if you just go to the restaurant and pick it up.

07:29.580 --> 07:32.540
But then it's like, well, you still want to be able to help the drivers that are trying

07:32.540 --> 07:33.540
to get by.

07:33.540 --> 07:35.980
But those companies take such a huge share.

07:35.980 --> 07:37.820
So it's like, what's the you know.

07:37.820 --> 07:41.660
So we just we tried to do a little bit of everything, but not too much of one thing.

07:41.660 --> 07:43.500
I think that's all you can do.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.500
Exactly.

07:44.500 --> 07:45.500
All right.

07:45.500 --> 07:46.500
Let's see.

07:46.500 --> 07:51.500
S2100 Matt says Loki is not at the stage where he is rolling white bread into stick form

07:51.500 --> 07:54.100
and dipping it in spaghetti sauce to make breadsticks.

07:54.100 --> 07:55.260
No, we're not there yet.

07:55.260 --> 07:58.140
I mean, the pizza place you always go to isn't closed.

07:58.700 --> 07:59.700
So you can still go there.

07:59.700 --> 08:00.700
No, it's not.

08:00.700 --> 08:03.620
And they keep bugging me every single day that they want me to order something.

08:03.620 --> 08:08.740
I'm like, no, no, I'm not going to do that every day.

08:08.740 --> 08:13.340
Some places are opening up all of a sudden, like some places during, you know, when the

08:13.340 --> 08:21.000
shutdowns all started, not every restaurant necessarily opened for for takeout and delivery.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.940
Some just stayed closed, but just on May 1st, some have been opening back up.

08:24.940 --> 08:29.580
For example, you know, I don't want to I don't want to give him a free ad, but we ordered

08:29.580 --> 08:40.980
from an ancient pasta factory that had stopped that they weren't open for the last month

08:40.980 --> 08:41.980
or so.

08:41.980 --> 08:45.020
But they just started again, I guess, on on May 1st.

08:45.020 --> 08:46.380
And there's a more local chain.

08:46.380 --> 08:48.780
I'll shout them out because they're local, the Moss Taco Bar.

08:48.780 --> 08:50.940
They just started again on May 1st.

08:50.940 --> 08:55.580
So it's it's interesting how some places kind of have just had to accept, like, you know,

08:55.580 --> 08:57.300
maybe they were going to be able to be closed for a month.

08:57.300 --> 09:01.260
But now it's like, oh, we we kind of have to do this for a little bit or whatever.

09:01.260 --> 09:03.140
We had new stores even opening up over here.

09:03.140 --> 09:05.780
So like we just got a five guys down the street.

09:05.780 --> 09:08.280
So that's another option.

09:08.280 --> 09:13.340
And there's a gym boys opening up over there, too, right next door.

09:13.340 --> 09:18.160
So I was like almost went over there today, but then I made the garlic bread stuff.

09:18.160 --> 09:20.340
So I didn't end up doing that.

09:20.740 --> 09:22.740
And Bobby Blackwell says people got rent to pay.

09:22.740 --> 09:27.180
Yeah, that's true. I mean, some people may not have foreseen this lasting as long as

09:27.180 --> 09:28.180
it has.

09:28.180 --> 09:31.860
And, you know, it's well, I keep saying it's going to go on longer.

09:31.860 --> 09:36.900
But, you know, if you've listened to the whole, like, staged reopening thing, restaurants,

09:36.900 --> 09:40.380
I believe in one of the recent governor because we're all in California, so one of the recent

09:40.380 --> 09:41.380
governor knew some updates.

09:41.380 --> 09:45.540
He said restaurants in some form should be a few days away, although it'll be, you know,

09:45.540 --> 09:46.540
reduced occupancy.

09:46.740 --> 09:51.260
And, you know, our work has already said, like, basically, even if if they were to lift

09:51.260 --> 09:56.100
the restrictions tomorrow when this was on Friday, so they're going to lift the restrictions

09:56.100 --> 09:57.100
tomorrow.

09:57.100 --> 10:01.460
We wouldn't go back to work until the very earliest the end of June.

10:01.460 --> 10:04.820
So right now it's looking like at least the end of June.

10:04.820 --> 10:05.820
Yeah.

10:05.820 --> 10:06.820
We're probably much later.

10:06.820 --> 10:10.260
My work has been asking people if they were ready to go back and fully accepting if they

10:10.260 --> 10:11.260
said no.

10:11.260 --> 10:12.260
Yeah.

10:12.260 --> 10:17.220
My work has basically said we're not going to mandate anyone goes back until there's

10:17.220 --> 10:19.300
a cure or a vaccine.

10:19.300 --> 10:23.260
So I mean, knock on plastic is what I have here in the studio.

10:23.260 --> 10:24.260
We're all very fortunate.

10:24.260 --> 10:28.340
I know a lot of people out there, you know, do not have as flexible work scenario.

10:28.340 --> 10:32.160
So believe me, I know I'm very, very lucky in this whole scenario.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.980
And that's why I'm trying to support every little thing.

10:34.980 --> 10:38.820
I get a little driver over here, arrest a local restaurant over here and so forth.

10:38.820 --> 10:44.340
But you know, just staying home at the end of the day is the most important thing.

10:44.340 --> 10:46.340
Because we do live in the capital of California.

10:46.340 --> 10:49.100
I'm sure you've seen what's been going on downtown in the news.

10:49.100 --> 10:51.740
I want no shape or part of that.

10:51.740 --> 10:56.180
So I am going to stay right here in my nice little part of suburbia where I am.

10:56.180 --> 10:58.380
And I think that's the best we can do for right now.

10:58.380 --> 10:59.380
All right.

10:59.380 --> 11:03.520
Anyway, obviously, one thing we do when we're inside is we play a lot of video games.

11:03.520 --> 11:07.500
And so of course, here on this program, we sit and talk about video games for a few hours

11:07.500 --> 11:12.660
every week with all of you guys in our chat room who care to join us live Sunday nights

11:12.660 --> 11:14.580
at the Voice of Geeks network.

11:14.580 --> 11:20.080
But of course, our show is free in an audio only podcast forum as well as our podcast

11:20.080 --> 11:21.080
has existed.

11:21.080 --> 11:24.660
You know, the audio show has existed for like 18 years now, just about.

11:24.660 --> 11:27.300
So we don't plan on that going away anytime soon.

11:27.300 --> 11:31.300
If you want to participate that way, send us feedback throughout the week either at

11:31.300 --> 11:32.300
vog network.com.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.580
You can leave comments on prior episodes.

11:34.580 --> 11:38.160
You can always email us participate at orange launch radio.com.

11:38.160 --> 11:41.660
Or you can send us a tweet at OLR many different ways to interact with us throughout the week,

11:41.660 --> 11:45.660
even if you aren't able to make it here live on Sunday night, because I know even with

11:45.660 --> 11:48.620
people locked down at home, but there's still a lot of other Yeah, there's other things

11:48.620 --> 11:50.580
you might have a regular zoom call that you're doing.

11:50.580 --> 11:54.100
Maybe you got a usual meeting or a church thing you used to do on Sundays.

11:54.100 --> 11:55.300
Now that's kind of virtual.

11:55.300 --> 11:57.620
So I know you can't always be here live.

11:57.620 --> 12:00.540
Although I have heard now some people and this has kind of been happening to me too.

12:00.540 --> 12:05.840
Some people are falling way behind on their podcasts, because commuting was a place that

12:05.840 --> 12:10.540
they and that was me like I used to listen to the podcast I would listen to when I would

12:10.540 --> 12:11.580
commute to work.

12:11.580 --> 12:13.460
And now that's kind of like not a thing.

12:13.460 --> 12:19.300
So I've fallen behind a little bit, although I've, I try to listen to some while I play

12:19.300 --> 12:20.300
MMOs.

12:20.300 --> 12:25.100
I will do like crafting gathering in an MMO, which is very mindless and listen to podcasts.

12:25.100 --> 12:29.660
So you know, if you're able to join us great, if not, I understand these are crazy times

12:29.660 --> 12:30.660
right now.

12:30.660 --> 12:32.420
But we're gonna talk about the news with you guys.

12:32.420 --> 12:35.340
We are not here to report the news.

12:35.340 --> 12:40.460
Because I think you guys, you know, if you're, if you're perceptive enough to find a gaming

12:40.460 --> 12:44.500
podcast, you probably already have your finger on the pulse of games a little bit.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.260
But we're here to talk about it.

12:46.260 --> 12:50.500
I'm giving this longer spiel because it's been a few months since I've introduced OLR.

12:50.500 --> 12:55.200
So just to remind people, this show was formed.

12:55.200 --> 12:59.300
Because the three of us, we all met playing a little arcade game called Dance Dance Revolution

12:59.300 --> 13:00.520
at the arcade.

13:00.520 --> 13:04.180
And we used to go to a local restaurant and eat dinner.

13:04.180 --> 13:07.260
We would eat very healthy mozzarella sticks, but it's okay because we burn off the calories

13:07.260 --> 13:08.560
playing DDR.

13:08.560 --> 13:12.220
And then we would just talk smack, but like in a good way, not always like a negative

13:12.220 --> 13:17.020
way, about our constructive way, about one of our favorite hobbies, which is video games.

13:17.020 --> 13:18.760
And so we kind of took that to the virtual world.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.700
So welcome to our dinner table.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.540
I'm sorry, I'm out of food.

13:22.540 --> 13:27.340
Anyhow, let's get into our kickoff topic for tonight, which has to do with a big upcoming

13:27.340 --> 13:28.340
video game.

13:28.380 --> 13:32.020
I don't know if you want to take this one, Loki, but there's been a lot of news on this

13:32.020 --> 13:33.020
game this week.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.020
That's for sure.

13:34.020 --> 13:35.020
Yeah.

13:35.020 --> 13:41.420
So there's, of course, there's large big name games coming out, especially those from Sony,

13:41.420 --> 13:46.060
which we've seen for a few E3s now, and we've been patiently waiting for them to actually

13:46.060 --> 13:47.300
release it.

13:47.300 --> 13:54.060
And unfortunately, because of things being the way they are, people just can't leave

13:54.060 --> 13:57.560
spoilers out there or can't leave them to themselves.

13:57.560 --> 14:06.160
So of course, allegedly, someone hacked Sony possibly to get some information about The

14:06.160 --> 14:12.080
Last of Us 2 and have leaked that information out onto the Internet.

14:12.080 --> 14:15.320
So it is widely out there now.

14:15.320 --> 14:21.420
Thankfully, it seems to be that the people that are responsible for it are not affiliated

14:21.420 --> 14:24.720
with Naughty Dog or Sony Interactive Entertainment.

14:24.880 --> 14:30.240
However, they have an ongoing investigation to figure out what's going on with it, but

14:30.240 --> 14:31.680
they do know who did it.

14:33.560 --> 14:35.080
So that's kind of interesting.

14:35.080 --> 14:38.040
And Bobby's clarifying in our chat that it was not a hack.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.560
It was an NDA being broken by an outsourced company.

14:40.560 --> 14:46.760
And to be fair on this whole situation, the narrative behind it has been changing a lot

14:46.760 --> 14:48.200
as the week's been going on.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.480
And I think social media is probably playing into that a little bit.

14:50.480 --> 14:53.880
And you got the game of telephone going on because I know when this originally hit, it

14:53.920 --> 15:01.960
was scorned Naughty Dog employee due to the conditions at Naughty Dog, which is a fair

15:01.960 --> 15:03.760
issue and a separate issue.

15:03.760 --> 15:08.600
I'll just say that. But it leaked this whole thing to get back at their employer and all

15:08.600 --> 15:13.200
this stuff. And so the narrative has really been shifting as the week has been going on.

15:13.200 --> 15:18.520
But it sounds like now it's this whole, well, it didn't happen from within Sony and it

15:18.520 --> 15:22.320
didn't happen from within Naughty Dog, but it was definitely obviously it was somebody

15:22.320 --> 15:23.320
they were working with.

15:24.040 --> 15:28.680
Because like what I saw online, I mean, just recently there was another article posted

15:28.680 --> 15:34.080
about how someone had gotten access to the Amazon cloud servers, I guess, Amazon servers

15:34.080 --> 15:41.160
for Naughty Dog Games, which had development code for Uncharted 3, The Last of Us and

15:41.160 --> 15:43.880
access to servers for multiplayer functionality.

15:43.880 --> 15:49.520
And apparently they were able to use that to fetch files from The Last of Us 2.

15:50.000 --> 15:56.760
So I don't know, maybe that was part of it, but whatever the case may be, we don't need

15:56.760 --> 15:59.760
to know how it happened, but it just has happened.

15:59.760 --> 16:04.280
And so, you know, that does suck that that's out there, especially for those folks who

16:04.280 --> 16:05.680
are really interested in playing the game.

16:05.680 --> 16:12.400
I haven't played The Last of Us, so I mean, it'd be unfortunate if I found out spoilers,

16:12.400 --> 16:14.640
but like I wouldn't have any context to it.

16:15.040 --> 16:21.440
Yeah, I did see the spoilers because I made, and I will not say them here, that would be

16:21.440 --> 16:27.000
a dick thing to do, but I made the mistake of going to Twitter and looking at the replies

16:27.000 --> 16:27.920
to one of the threads.

16:27.920 --> 16:32.000
And of course, you know, people are in there and they're shouting out the spoilers because

16:32.000 --> 16:35.840
some people are just the worst, trademark, at Twitter.

16:36.640 --> 16:40.840
Although I did notice, I mean, it wasn't happening instantly, but I did notice that Naughty

16:40.840 --> 16:44.600
Dog and Sony were using that new Twitter functionality, which I didn't even, I kind

16:44.600 --> 16:47.360
of forgot it was a thing because I never saw it being used, but they were using that new

16:47.360 --> 16:50.400
functionality where you can hide certain replies.

16:50.400 --> 16:54.040
So they were using it to suppress some of the people that were posting spoilers, but

16:54.040 --> 16:58.040
you know, tweets fly so fast that so many people were posting them.

16:58.040 --> 17:00.120
And you know how shitty people are.

17:00.120 --> 17:03.860
Like unfortunately, there are shitty people out there that were just searching for anybody

17:03.860 --> 17:09.000
talking about The Last of Us on Twitter and would just reply saying, hey, bet you can't

17:09.000 --> 17:12.400
wait for a blah, blah, blah, blah, you know, and that whole thing.

17:12.400 --> 17:16.120
So I mean, it's, it's, it's shitty.

17:16.120 --> 17:22.480
I would hope now, like Loki, I don't play the, I never got really invested in that series.

17:22.480 --> 17:24.560
I know people do.

17:24.560 --> 17:28.680
I would hope that even if I were to see the ultimate spoiler, you know, even if I were

17:28.680 --> 17:33.960
to see Darth Vader is Luke's father, which, okay, I know you're all going to go, oh my

17:33.960 --> 17:34.960
God.

17:34.960 --> 17:35.960
1977?

17:35.960 --> 17:36.960
I know, I know.

17:36.960 --> 17:40.120
I know you all are going to feign shock, but give me a break.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.120
Okay.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.120
The movie is how old?

17:42.120 --> 17:43.440
May the fourth is tomorrow.

17:43.440 --> 17:46.960
If y'all didn't know, y'all didn't, y'all were never going to care.

17:46.960 --> 17:51.440
So is that, but anyway, if, if, um, now where was I going with all that?

17:51.440 --> 17:52.440
Oh yeah.

17:52.440 --> 17:56.480
Even if you know that like Darth Vader is Luke's father, well, I think, okay, many kids

17:56.480 --> 17:59.440
have grown up just knowing that as a way of life, right?

17:59.440 --> 18:03.940
That yes, Darth Vader is Luke, Luke's father, but that doesn't ruin Star Wars.

18:03.940 --> 18:07.100
Like you can still enjoy at least the first three movies.

18:07.100 --> 18:12.160
I realize people may have varying opinions on the movies after that, but I think in general,

18:12.160 --> 18:16.340
most people at least enjoy some people straight up fan boy.

18:16.340 --> 18:18.220
Some people are like, it's all right.

18:18.220 --> 18:20.460
You know, everybody's got their varying opinions.

18:20.460 --> 18:21.460
Fine.

18:21.460 --> 18:26.060
But I think for the most nowadays, the equivalent of that would be like Ray's lineage, I guess,

18:26.060 --> 18:30.460
since you know, everybody knows who, uh, what Luke's lineage is.

18:30.460 --> 18:33.740
Well, actually, actually I never saw the later movies, so don't spoil that one.

18:33.740 --> 18:34.740
Right.

18:34.740 --> 18:35.740
I remember his name.

18:35.740 --> 18:36.740
Yeah.

18:36.740 --> 18:42.220
But although that was a very forced twist and it was, here's the thing, here's the thing.

18:42.220 --> 18:46.060
Even it was force.

18:46.060 --> 18:47.060
I'm sorry.

18:47.060 --> 18:49.320
Am I hosting with dark Sakura or the 23rd Magus?

18:49.320 --> 18:53.580
Who is this on the line right now?

18:53.580 --> 18:54.580
Old OLR joke.

18:54.580 --> 18:55.580
Old OLR joke.

18:55.580 --> 18:56.580
Okay.

18:56.580 --> 18:58.100
So, um, I wasn't gonna say, Oh yes.

18:58.100 --> 19:02.900
Even if, even if I did have it spoiled, whatever those movies still ought to be good.

19:03.340 --> 19:05.420
While you still know that, right?

19:05.420 --> 19:07.980
Like you can still watch those movies and relatively enjoy them, even though you know

19:07.980 --> 19:09.300
the big spoiler at the end.

19:09.300 --> 19:10.300
Right.

19:10.300 --> 19:14.220
So I would hope, and I'm not forgiving the spoilers.

19:14.220 --> 19:15.220
Don't get me wrong.

19:15.220 --> 19:19.060
If you're out there and I doubt anybody listening to this show is one of those people, but who

19:19.060 --> 19:23.180
knows who stumbles upon us randomly on Twitter or Twitch.

19:23.180 --> 19:28.140
If you're one of those people that's out there, like randomly posting spoilers, I'm not excusing

19:28.140 --> 19:29.140
you.

19:29.140 --> 19:30.900
You're a Dick like straight up.

19:30.900 --> 19:36.860
But, um, I, I would think that the experience can still be a good one for people.

19:36.860 --> 19:41.740
I hope people don't get too, too distraught if they have been spoiled and who knows, you

19:41.740 --> 19:48.020
know, um, they're now trying to say pre-release maybe something, maybe delays happen because

19:48.020 --> 19:49.020
there was a change.

19:49.020 --> 19:52.880
I mean, I think they're trying to maybe, you know, missed people a little bit with what's

19:52.880 --> 19:58.140
going on, but there could be a change or could be something that happens, who knows?

19:58.140 --> 20:01.580
So, um, the game should still be enjoyable, I would think.

20:01.580 --> 20:05.860
So I'm hoping if you did get accidentally spoiled on Twitter or whatever, that it doesn't

20:05.860 --> 20:07.540
ruin the whole damn thing for you.

20:07.540 --> 20:12.620
Don't, don't let those people have that kind of power over you, I guess.

20:12.620 --> 20:20.380
So let's see, um, I'm looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

20:20.380 --> 20:25.220
Bobby says, my friend was so excited to show star Wars to his six year old son and the

20:25.220 --> 20:28.540
kid was like, Oh, he's Luke's father because he heard it at school.

20:28.540 --> 20:35.180
My friend was crushed because he was excited to see the reaction, ah, other kids, man,

20:35.180 --> 20:36.180
other people's kids.

20:36.180 --> 20:37.180
All right.

20:37.180 --> 20:38.180
What can you do?

20:38.180 --> 20:39.180
Um, let's see.

20:39.180 --> 20:41.140
I know what I can do.

20:41.140 --> 20:46.900
What's that have any not have, Oh, not, not, I don't contribute to the other people's kids

20:46.900 --> 20:47.900
when I'm the other people.

20:47.900 --> 20:48.900
There you go.

20:48.900 --> 20:49.900
There you go.

20:49.900 --> 20:50.900
Um, let's see.

20:50.900 --> 20:56.940
I would, I would rather be that crazy uncle, uh, that shows the kid, the movie that his

20:56.940 --> 21:03.220
parents don't want him to see my uncle, he took me to see poltergeist when I was little

21:03.220 --> 21:09.820
hope, hopefully melody is not watching, but I will tell you what, why, by the way, happy

21:09.820 --> 21:10.820
birthday Charlotte.

21:10.820 --> 21:12.860
Cause her birthday was just like yesterday.

21:12.860 --> 21:19.260
Um, but when that child is older, I probably will take her to her first star rated movie,

21:19.300 --> 21:20.300
but hopefully melody.

21:20.300 --> 21:21.300
Didn't hear that.

21:21.300 --> 21:22.300
All right.

21:22.300 --> 21:23.300
Anyway.

21:23.300 --> 21:24.300
Yeah.

21:24.300 --> 21:25.300
That's and that's, that's the life for me.

21:25.300 --> 21:26.300
So anyway.

21:26.300 --> 21:29.300
Uh, last of us to those spoilers suck, but the game is still coming out, right?

21:29.300 --> 21:31.300
And you know, I'm sure it'll still sell very well.

21:31.300 --> 21:32.300
Right?

21:34.300 --> 21:35.300
Loki.

21:35.300 --> 21:37.300
I would assume so.

21:37.300 --> 21:39.300
I would assume so as well.

21:39.300 --> 21:43.340
Um, so what do you think is ultimately going to happen with this?

21:43.340 --> 21:48.140
Cause I th I think the obvious answer is that a huge lawsuit is going to happen.

21:48.140 --> 21:52.420
We're going to see, I mean, it's funny cause when Bobby was covering this topic on his

21:52.420 --> 21:54.540
show, some people were saying, are they going to go to jail?

21:54.540 --> 21:59.460
You know, which I understand not everybody necessarily, you know, gamer jail, gamer jail.

21:59.460 --> 22:03.340
It's going to get tricky because well, their careers are going to go to jail.

22:03.340 --> 22:05.740
That's how it was, how it was leaked out.

22:05.740 --> 22:10.340
If it was a violation of an NDA, then they might get fired from the company that they

22:10.340 --> 22:13.020
worked for might have some sort of repercussions there.

22:13.020 --> 22:18.300
If it was God, you know, from like hacking or something like that, then there's the whole

22:18.300 --> 22:20.340
cyber intrusion stuff.

22:20.340 --> 22:24.460
I think no matter, I think no matter what, you're going to see a lawsuit come of this

22:24.460 --> 22:26.580
because I'm assuming an NDA was broken.

22:26.580 --> 22:32.020
Let's go, let's go with the whole, um, eighth of a vendor that was working maybe for localization

22:32.020 --> 22:36.700
or QA or something in another country, uh, was the one that ultimately leaked this.

22:36.700 --> 22:37.700
Let's say it was that.

22:37.700 --> 22:42.100
Um, then I think yours for certainly going to see a breach of contract lawsuit and I

22:42.100 --> 22:45.940
think you're going to see one so big that it's probably going to shut down whatever

22:45.940 --> 22:49.980
company it was because no, no, nobody else is going to want to work with that company

22:49.980 --> 22:50.980
in the future.

22:50.980 --> 22:56.220
And it kind of sucks like how much one person's actions have like screwed other people.

22:56.220 --> 22:59.020
Um, and I think you're certainly going to see a huge lawsuit come of that.

22:59.020 --> 23:03.380
But the interesting thing is, let's say it is this foreign issue where the companies

23:03.380 --> 23:07.500
in Germany or what have you, and you know, the, uh, nod dog is in the States.

23:07.500 --> 23:10.900
Then you're going to have that whole like weird international law stuff come into play,

23:10.900 --> 23:12.380
which is a whole other mess.

23:12.380 --> 23:13.380
Right.

23:13.380 --> 23:17.940
So I don't know what happens in that case because I don't know if we've had a lot of

23:17.940 --> 23:19.980
precedent for that type of thing.

23:19.980 --> 23:22.980
Um, it's still a universal thing.

23:22.980 --> 23:23.980
It is.

23:23.980 --> 23:25.940
I mean, and they could sue them in a German court, I guess ultimately, I guess it would

23:25.940 --> 23:28.860
depend on where that contract was executed.

23:28.860 --> 23:29.860
Ultimately.

23:29.860 --> 23:34.400
Um, I would think that even if it's a German country, it probably has hold or it has some

23:34.400 --> 23:37.860
type of presence in the U S but you know, again, I don't, I don't really know and I'm

23:37.860 --> 23:39.420
not going to pretend to know that stuff.

23:39.420 --> 23:40.660
I just think it's for sure.

23:40.660 --> 23:43.900
We're going to see a lawsuit and I don't know if we've seen something like that in the gaming

23:43.900 --> 23:44.900
industry before.

23:44.900 --> 23:49.740
I'm trying to think if we've ever had, like, I think we've had threats of it and I can't

23:49.740 --> 23:50.900
think of a time.

23:50.900 --> 23:52.380
Maybe this is where I need chats help.

23:52.380 --> 23:55.960
I can't think of a time where one of these like breach of contract issues actually went

23:55.960 --> 24:00.460
to court, but I think we're going to see it here and this is going to be a very interesting

24:00.460 --> 24:02.820
new ish kind of thing.

24:02.820 --> 24:08.820
So um, see a Tiberian chat says if someone from top chef breaks the law, would they go

24:08.820 --> 24:09.820
to jail?

24:09.820 --> 24:10.820
Simmons?

24:10.820 --> 24:14.820
Um, you know, uh, speaking of reality shows though, there was, you know, you guys all

24:14.820 --> 24:19.900
know I, I enjoy survivor and those types of shows and uh, it's kind of like a known fact

24:19.900 --> 24:27.480
that, uh, well, you know, fat fact in quotes, allegedly protect myself here, allegedly a

24:27.480 --> 24:33.260
former contestant, uh, who was kind of a no notorious villain on the show who got to the

24:33.260 --> 24:37.900
finals twice and still never won, uh, and who continues to bully Sandra D S twine on

24:37.900 --> 24:42.540
Twitter to this day, uh, because he's so butthurt about it, uh, apparently spoiled like three

24:42.540 --> 24:48.020
seasons of the show, uh, and has yet to really face any repercussions from it.

24:48.020 --> 24:53.380
Um, even though in those reality show contracts, if you break the survivor contract, you're

24:53.380 --> 24:55.660
on the hook for like $5 million or something like that.

24:55.660 --> 24:56.660
It's a lot of money.

24:56.660 --> 25:01.080
You know, those shows are not cheap to produce and you know, spoilers can ruin everything.

25:01.080 --> 25:05.700
So anyway, um, I'll be seeing that this is for Mark and Boone.

25:05.700 --> 25:06.700
They were robbed.

25:06.700 --> 25:07.700
Yeah.

25:07.700 --> 25:08.700
Speaking of reality shows.

25:08.700 --> 25:09.700
Yeah.

25:09.700 --> 25:10.940
People very invested in Lego masters in these times.

25:10.940 --> 25:11.940
Yes, yes, yes.

25:11.940 --> 25:16.460
I've watched actually talking about catching up on, uh, uh, podcasting and stuff like that.

25:16.460 --> 25:22.780
I've been watching a lot of the, uh, different, uh, behind the brick in like different podcasts

25:22.780 --> 25:25.340
and YouTube shows with, uh, Mark and Boone and stuff.

25:25.340 --> 25:29.300
And actually funny enough, uh, Mark and Boone, uh, I think it was Boone actually.

25:29.300 --> 25:34.680
He does a YouTube show about Legos and I mean, a lot of these guys that are on the show have

25:34.680 --> 25:35.680
their own YouTube stuff.

25:36.120 --> 25:37.120
They're all like really cool with it.

25:37.120 --> 25:41.360
I mean, like as far as who won and stuff, I think a lot of it, they said that the judging

25:41.360 --> 25:42.360
was fair.

25:42.360 --> 25:46.840
Um, that I think a lot of it is just how they kind of cut and edit the show.

25:46.840 --> 25:54.760
Um, because like, I know one of the guys, um, Oh God, it was, uh, the guy, the one of

25:54.760 --> 26:00.240
the finalists with Amy or, uh, I can't remember them, but there's one dude that like, I would

26:00.240 --> 26:05.920
annoy the hell out of me at first and like, I hated him and then like it got better throughout

26:05.920 --> 26:06.920
the rest of the show.

26:06.920 --> 26:10.320
And then you see like after the fact and it's like, okay, yeah, he's pretty cool.

26:10.320 --> 26:14.360
Um, but the way that they kind of edit it and in a way that made it look like he was

26:14.360 --> 26:16.120
just like a complete douchebag.

26:16.120 --> 26:18.120
So I don't know.

26:18.120 --> 26:21.400
It's creative editing, the manufactured drama.

26:21.400 --> 26:26.960
Um, you know, and, and, and this is an important lesson about reality TV, which I'm not sure

26:26.960 --> 26:29.840
if this really directly ties to games, but we'll talk about it anyway.

26:29.840 --> 26:33.520
Um, and this is especially true on drag race.

26:33.520 --> 26:34.520
Whoops.

26:34.520 --> 26:35.520
I'm sorry.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.840
I'm bringing up drag race at the top of the show, but it's important because I bet the

26:37.840 --> 26:42.080
same thing will apply to Lego masters or any of your favorite reality TV shows.

26:42.080 --> 26:47.800
Um, winning American idol being another huge one, winning doesn't necessarily mean winning.

26:47.800 --> 26:48.800
Okay.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.520
It's not whether you win or lose.

26:50.520 --> 26:54.080
It's what you do with the opportunity that's been presented to you.

26:54.080 --> 26:58.760
Uh, if you want to go to drag race, ask Tyra Sanchez who won season two, what she's doing

26:58.760 --> 26:59.760
these days.

26:59.760 --> 27:04.920
And then look at some of her peers like Raven, uh, Juju B Pandora box and where they're at,

27:04.920 --> 27:07.040
uh, or season seven is another great example.

27:07.040 --> 27:08.040
Look at Violet Chachki.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.040
Although don't get me wrong.

27:09.040 --> 27:12.400
Violet Chachki is actually really cool and I love her looks, but where you look at where

27:12.400 --> 27:17.760
her needle is at versus Trixie Mattel and Katya who are also on that season and where

27:17.760 --> 27:19.560
their needles are at.

27:19.560 --> 27:25.320
For the record, um, Violet Chachki is doing a lot of work with, um, uh, the actual fashion

27:25.320 --> 27:32.400
world, uh, working as a model and doing, uh, uh, a lot of, uh, design work.

27:32.400 --> 27:33.400
Totally get that.

27:33.400 --> 27:36.400
But, and I'm not trying to shade her and I'm sorry if it made it, if I made it sound like

27:36.400 --> 27:41.280
I'm putting her on the same level as Tyra, however, if I were to compare her bank account

27:41.280 --> 27:44.720
to Trixie and Katya, she's doing very well.

27:44.720 --> 27:47.280
She's doing well, but is she doing as good as Trixie and Katya?

27:47.280 --> 27:50.840
Yeah, actually I highly doubt that, but I guess we'll never know.

27:50.840 --> 27:53.760
I think, uh, you might be a little contrarian there, but that's all right.

27:54.200 --> 27:57.360
No, no, I've actually been, been following her for some time.

27:57.360 --> 27:58.360
She's actually doing quite well.

27:58.360 --> 27:59.880
I'm doing some work for Gotye.

27:59.880 --> 28:00.880
Okay.

28:00.880 --> 28:04.200
I'd be, I'd be curious about her YouTube views next to Trixie and Katya and what they do,

28:04.200 --> 28:05.200
but yeah, it's all right.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.680
Well, YouTube isn't a measure of fame and success.

28:07.680 --> 28:11.840
Well, um, yeah, of course there's those, uh, concerts and the ticket sales and so forth.

28:11.840 --> 28:16.080
Um, but you know, it's a different, it's a different path that, uh, they're walking.

28:16.080 --> 28:17.080
That's for sure.

28:17.080 --> 28:18.480
Um, or American Idol.

28:18.480 --> 28:23.360
Uh, I think, uh, again, a huge example from that would be, um, Oh my God, why can't I

28:23.360 --> 28:24.360
hear me?

28:24.360 --> 28:26.360
Just, uh, Hudson, Jennifer Hudson.

28:26.360 --> 28:29.360
Uh, and she won a freaking Oscar.

28:29.360 --> 28:31.200
Uh, she didn't win that show.

28:31.200 --> 28:33.780
Uh, and who won her season quick?

28:33.780 --> 28:34.780
Who won the season?

28:34.780 --> 28:40.280
Jennifer Hudson was on, it was Fantasia Fantasia did Fantasia did okay.

28:40.280 --> 28:43.360
Uh, and you know, she, well, I shouldn't say, okay, she did very well, but she didn't win

28:43.360 --> 28:45.000
an Oscar like Jennifer Hudson did.

28:45.000 --> 28:51.660
So again, it doesn't matter like what you like do with the win.

28:51.660 --> 28:53.720
It's what you do with the exposure.

28:53.720 --> 28:55.100
And some winners do very well.

28:55.100 --> 29:01.000
Look at Kelly Clarkson, look at, um, Carrie Underwood, you know, some winners sometimes

29:01.000 --> 29:10.100
do very well anyway, but back to back to the subject at hand about the last of us to hopefully

29:10.100 --> 29:15.140
all these spoilers and these things do not cut into sales tremendously.

29:15.140 --> 29:18.500
Uh, that would be a very, very, very sad thing.

29:18.500 --> 29:20.780
Um, and I, I don't think that'll happen.

29:20.780 --> 29:23.900
I think there's enough fans of the last of us where this is still going to sell very

29:23.900 --> 29:24.900
well.

29:24.900 --> 29:31.200
Uh, we'll have to see how the like COVID and all that situation kind of plays into it.

29:31.200 --> 29:35.220
But seeing as it's boosted, um, which is as much as the situation sucks, it's boosted

29:35.220 --> 29:40.660
things like animal crossing and it's boosted things like, um, Final Fantasy seven remake

29:40.660 --> 29:44.000
and some of those figures we talked about last week, the last of us to only stands to

29:44.000 --> 29:45.740
do pretty well.

29:45.740 --> 29:46.980
All right.

29:46.980 --> 29:52.300
So let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we

29:52.300 --> 29:54.540
have been playing this week.

29:54.540 --> 29:56.260
And we'll start with, okay.

29:56.260 --> 29:58.100
So it looks like dark soccer stepped away for a second.

29:58.100 --> 30:00.500
So actually, uh, Loki, I'm going to start with you.

30:00.500 --> 30:01.780
All right.

30:01.780 --> 30:04.660
So, um, I didn't play a whole ton of things this week.

30:04.660 --> 30:06.340
Uh, well actually maybe we did.

30:06.340 --> 30:11.200
So I played a little bit of, uh, earth defense force, iron rain again.

30:11.200 --> 30:12.200
So I've been playing through that.

30:12.200 --> 30:14.900
I think I'm a little bit more than halfway through that now.

30:14.900 --> 30:20.220
Um, I picked up a few games on the steam well, it's not really a sale, but they had like

30:20.220 --> 30:25.740
stuff marked down, um, so I've been playing guts and glory.

30:25.740 --> 30:31.700
And if you're not familiar with guts and glory, guts and glory is like a 3d version of, uh,

30:31.700 --> 30:32.980
happy wheels.

30:32.980 --> 30:41.220
So it's an incredibly violent, um, physics based kind of obstacle course vehicle game.

30:41.220 --> 30:45.140
And uh, so I, and it's, it's pretty violent.

30:45.140 --> 30:47.820
Um, so, uh, that's been fun.

30:47.820 --> 30:52.660
And then of course, uh, when playing a little bit of step mania as well, um, even more songs

30:52.660 --> 30:58.320
on the cabin actually started building my own songs, but it's been so long since I've

30:58.320 --> 31:03.360
used the step mania, like, uh, editor to actually make stuff that I'm so kind of ran

31:03.360 --> 31:06.720
into a little bit of a learning curve with it, just trying to get songs synced up and

31:06.720 --> 31:07.720
everything correctly.

31:07.720 --> 31:12.200
Cause I was trying to get it like extremely like perfect right on.

31:12.200 --> 31:17.580
But then again, you know, I don't, I'm not exactly going to be scoring any triple A's

31:17.580 --> 31:18.580
on anything.

31:18.580 --> 31:22.080
So I don't know how well I can sync stuff up, but I'm gonna just do my best on that.

31:22.080 --> 31:27.040
Um, so I have a few songs picked out for that and been working on, um, you know, that sort

31:27.040 --> 31:29.040
of thing.

31:29.040 --> 31:36.320
And uh, that's, uh, Orna, lots of Orna, um, still playing that and almost, I don't know.

31:36.320 --> 31:38.960
I think I'm almost to 170 now on that.

31:38.960 --> 31:45.600
Um, so just try and make it up to 175 so I can get some, uh, Oh no, still 169.

31:45.600 --> 31:48.440
Are you holding onto a ton of orange to unlock a new class at 175?

31:48.440 --> 31:53.400
I'm still trying to get the class at 150, even though my character's like 164, 165.

31:53.400 --> 31:58.680
I'm uh, I've only got like 746,000 orange right now.

31:58.680 --> 32:03.120
So I don't have enough to like even close to getting the next class cause I think it's

32:03.120 --> 32:06.240
at 2 million, but I don't know.

32:06.240 --> 32:07.240
I don't really care.

32:07.240 --> 32:09.160
I mean the next class doesn't look all that great anyways.

32:09.160 --> 32:12.720
There's just more attack power and more HP I guess.

32:12.720 --> 32:14.520
That stuff goes a long way though.

32:14.520 --> 32:17.840
Like my God, when I finally upped from a, what was it, sword master or whatever it was

32:17.840 --> 32:18.840
to druid.

32:18.840 --> 32:22.240
No, the other way around druid to like sort of whatever, whatever the hell I am now.

32:22.280 --> 32:25.880
Uh, it's, it was a huge, like I'm actually able to take things out now.

32:25.880 --> 32:27.880
Like I was really struggling before.

32:27.880 --> 32:31.880
I've got my, my brand new bad ass weapon that I'm leveling up.

32:31.880 --> 32:38.400
So my current weapon that I was using is like an attack of like 550 or something like that.

32:38.400 --> 32:41.120
And the new one is like 700 something.

32:41.120 --> 32:46.480
So I mean, just that alone is like way more than the class as it is.

32:46.480 --> 32:50.040
Um, although damage wise, it doesn't really seem to make much of a difference, which is

32:50.040 --> 32:51.040
kind of funny.

32:51.160 --> 32:54.920
Um, so I just have to wait for that to be done.

32:54.920 --> 32:58.960
It's up, well it's been leveled up to level 10 and still got about a day and a half left

32:58.960 --> 32:59.960
on that.

32:59.960 --> 33:05.200
Um, and then everything else has been kind of being leveled up as it goes.

33:05.200 --> 33:08.520
And I don't know, I've been just trying to get as much as I can.

33:08.520 --> 33:13.520
I've got like, I've got to start doing more arenas because I have like 500 arena tokens

33:13.520 --> 33:16.880
because I buy them every time that they come into the store.

33:16.880 --> 33:18.480
Um, so I don't know.

33:18.520 --> 33:22.000
I've been just trying to play a lot, doing the daily quests.

33:23.720 --> 33:24.720
All right.

33:24.720 --> 33:25.720
Is that it for your gaming week?

33:25.720 --> 33:26.720
That's it.

33:26.720 --> 33:27.720
All right.

33:27.720 --> 33:29.680
I will go to my gaming week.

33:29.680 --> 33:32.400
So I've been continuing to play Animal Crossing.

33:32.400 --> 33:35.240
Of course, a lot, a lot of Animal Crossing.

33:35.240 --> 33:38.240
Bummer Jamie had to walk away for a minute cause I'm sure we could geek out about Animal

33:38.240 --> 33:39.240
Crossing.

33:39.240 --> 33:40.240
We'll do that a little later.

33:40.240 --> 33:44.680
I've been working on my gardens, um, uh, in Animal Crossing and trying to set up, I think

33:44.680 --> 33:49.960
I only have one more like a flower I really need to work on crossbreeding and growing

33:49.960 --> 33:50.960
and all that stuff.

33:50.960 --> 33:52.920
Uh, and I'll get around to that at some point.

33:52.920 --> 33:56.160
Um, I've actually been trying to work a little more with terraforming.

33:56.160 --> 34:00.720
I'm not trying to go too crazy, but like, I didn't want to like redo my island completely

34:00.720 --> 34:01.720
or any of that.

34:01.720 --> 34:04.840
I'm very much like, I'll just kind of work with what I got, but like I wanted to make

34:04.840 --> 34:08.680
one of my cliff areas where my garden is just a little bit bigger.

34:08.680 --> 34:12.640
So I like added a couple more squares around the side and I kind of did that whole thing

34:12.640 --> 34:13.640
with the terraforming.

34:13.800 --> 34:17.240
So I was working with that a little bit and otherwise just, um, you know, just signing

34:17.240 --> 34:22.260
in visiting my friends towns to pick up do it yourself patterns or the various visitors

34:22.260 --> 34:24.860
that are there and see what's going on and so forth.

34:24.860 --> 34:27.520
It's still a fun social game.

34:27.520 --> 34:32.000
Um, speaking of social stuff, I'm still playing Final Fantasy 14 even though, you know, it's

34:32.000 --> 34:36.200
kind of a lull between patches right now, but just trying to grind out the tomes and

34:36.200 --> 34:39.340
make sure I can buy the highest level gear that's available with the tomes that you get

34:39.340 --> 34:40.340
every week.

34:40.340 --> 34:41.340
So there's that.

34:41.660 --> 34:46.220
And then continuing on with things like Orna, we just talked about and Pokemon Go, which

34:46.220 --> 34:49.260
just launched the remote rating right and Pokemon Go.

34:49.260 --> 34:51.900
So I actually finally got to do one of those remote raids.

34:51.900 --> 34:56.900
So in the little chat group, which I haven't been very good at checking in on a lot lately,

34:56.900 --> 34:58.820
they were like, oh, we're going to do this park.

34:58.820 --> 35:03.660
And it's a park that like, it's it's far enough away where it is on my radar, but it's like

35:03.660 --> 35:04.760
so far away.

35:04.760 --> 35:08.820
It's like that grayish color that like it's fading into the horizon.

35:08.820 --> 35:10.700
It's so far away.

35:10.740 --> 35:14.540
So yeah, I'm able to get it barely.

35:14.540 --> 35:15.540
So we raided at that gym.

35:15.540 --> 35:19.420
And that was kind of nice to just see that whole remote thing in action.

35:19.420 --> 35:23.620
And then what we did, we walked over to the park that's like right near me, that has a

35:23.620 --> 35:24.620
gym.

35:24.620 --> 35:27.420
Alan and I walked over there and we were the only ones there.

35:27.420 --> 35:31.140
And there were like 15 accounts in the gym, all fighting.

35:31.140 --> 35:36.360
And usually you'd be like, spoofer, boo, spoofer, but obviously it's a very different world

35:36.360 --> 35:37.360
we're in now.

35:37.520 --> 35:41.280
You have sanctioned spoofing essentially within the game.

35:41.280 --> 35:43.360
So that's been kind of interesting.

35:43.360 --> 35:47.460
Otherwise, I'm trying to do those Kanto quests that are going on right now and I'm stuck

35:47.460 --> 35:49.520
on one of them, which ironically I think is raiding.

35:49.520 --> 35:54.800
I just need to wait for like a one star to pop up as a remote raid and do it.

35:54.800 --> 35:59.640
And then to finish the location game talk, I spent a little time yesterday with Ingress

35:59.640 --> 36:02.200
because they did a virtual event.

36:02.200 --> 36:06.680
So, you know, Ingress is very much a game that is played out in the real world.

36:06.680 --> 36:10.280
And back in October, I was talking about a live event that happened here in Sacramento

36:10.280 --> 36:15.480
that had like 300, 400 people all playing the game downtown and having a good time and

36:15.480 --> 36:16.480
all that stuff.

36:16.480 --> 36:19.880
Obviously, our world is not built for that right now.

36:19.880 --> 36:23.880
They pretty regularly will do these events called First Saturday, where like a small

36:23.880 --> 36:27.960
group of maybe 50 people will get together and play the game on the first Saturday of

36:27.960 --> 36:32.080
the month, explore a new town, do some missions, just kind of have fun in the sun.

36:32.080 --> 36:35.560
Obviously, our current world state doesn't lend well to that model.

36:35.560 --> 36:39.940
So they did the first virtual First Saturday this past weekend.

36:39.940 --> 36:40.940
And that was kind of neat.

36:40.940 --> 36:42.680
It was different.

36:42.680 --> 36:46.740
We hung out on a Zoom call and we all recharged portals.

36:46.740 --> 36:52.520
But then we did like a group OPR or Niantic Wayfarer, right?

36:52.520 --> 36:55.640
So we all went in there and reviewed things together as a group.

36:55.640 --> 36:58.920
And that was actually kind of fun to talk about that with people from the other faction

36:58.920 --> 37:01.200
to kind of get a sense of where their head is at.

37:01.200 --> 37:04.380
And some of the things we agree on and we don't agree on always when it comes to and

37:04.380 --> 37:05.380
everybody was cordial.

37:05.380 --> 37:08.460
Nobody was like, you're wrong, you know, but we kind of talked about, oh, I don't know

37:08.460 --> 37:09.620
if I would view it that way.

37:09.620 --> 37:13.300
I might have one starred that because this or whatever it is.

37:13.300 --> 37:15.020
So it was nice to be able to talk about that.

37:15.020 --> 37:19.620
And it was really funny because some of the same submissions would come up.

37:19.620 --> 37:25.660
Like three of us got this submission called Dad's Computer that was showing up.

37:25.660 --> 37:30.260
And it was legit, probably a nine year old who took a screenshot of a computer screen

37:30.260 --> 37:33.860
on Google and was trying to submit that as a pokey stop.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.500
Oh, I forgot to mention.

37:35.500 --> 37:41.820
So remember how I had submitted that, like the pokey stop request for like or Ingress,

37:41.820 --> 37:45.660
I guess it was back a long time ago for that code Ninja's place.

37:45.660 --> 37:50.440
Finally, almost a year later, they finally rejected it.

37:50.440 --> 37:53.180
It took a whole year.

37:53.180 --> 37:54.180
Can you talk about something for a minute?

37:54.180 --> 37:55.580
I need to handle something.

37:55.580 --> 37:56.580
Yeah.

37:56.580 --> 37:59.580
So it was ridiculous, because I was like, you know, what is going on?

37:59.580 --> 38:03.820
And trying to get a response to at least say, OK, is this going to pass or not, which

38:03.820 --> 38:11.860
I really should have, but because they gave a mural that was to a yogurt place next kind

38:11.860 --> 38:14.900
of across the way, they gave that as a pokey stop.

38:14.900 --> 38:19.300
But I thought, you know, let's put a mural in this one and then I can hit it from where

38:19.300 --> 38:20.300
I'm sitting.

38:20.300 --> 38:25.300
Although, to be fair, I can also hit the yogurt shop as well because it's close enough.

38:25.300 --> 38:26.500
But I don't know.

38:26.500 --> 38:32.340
I thought I would have made a good pokey stop, but I guess whatever.

38:32.340 --> 38:34.940
So that Ingress event was pretty fun.

38:34.940 --> 38:39.500
And they actually I didn't realize this, but Niantic rewarded those of us that participated

38:39.500 --> 38:41.060
a free upgrade.

38:41.060 --> 38:42.660
So one of our portals got upgraded.

38:42.660 --> 38:45.400
That's cool, except all my submissions are in Puerto Rico because I submitted them all

38:45.400 --> 38:46.700
when I was on the cruise.

38:46.700 --> 38:49.480
So you're welcome if you live in Puerto Rico.

38:49.480 --> 38:52.180
I added some pokey stops in Old Town.

38:52.180 --> 38:55.260
So anyway, what else have I been playing?

38:55.260 --> 38:56.620
Oh, a new game.

38:56.620 --> 38:59.140
I'll talk quickly about Streets of Rage 4.

38:59.140 --> 39:04.960
So I was able to play Streets of Rage 4 because it's on Xbox Game Pass, actually.

39:04.960 --> 39:06.620
That was a really pleasant surprise.

39:06.620 --> 39:08.660
I guess they probably did announce that.

39:08.660 --> 39:09.780
I forgot.

39:09.780 --> 39:12.820
I just looked at the Game Pass app on Friday or something.

39:12.820 --> 39:14.380
I was like, oh, Streets of Rage 4 is here.

39:14.380 --> 39:15.620
I want to check that out.

39:15.620 --> 39:17.940
So I did download that and check it out.

39:17.940 --> 39:21.660
And as you know, of course, Streets of Rage 1, 2, and 3 were Genesis games.

39:21.660 --> 39:26.420
It was an old school beat-em-up like Final Fight or a lot of those games you played at

39:26.420 --> 39:30.020
a pizza parlor in the 90s, those beat-em-up hell, the Ninja Turtles game, one of the most

39:30.020 --> 39:32.860
popular in that genre of beat-em-ups.

39:32.860 --> 39:39.220
And so Streets of Rage, now that we're years and years later on the Xbox One, and I know

39:39.220 --> 39:44.420
this is on Nintendo Switch and all the platforms, is really kind of that same formula, except

39:44.420 --> 39:45.980
it's not pixelated.

39:45.980 --> 39:49.200
It's more hand-drawn, although I believe there's a retro mode in it, but you don't have it

39:49.200 --> 39:50.500
right away.

39:50.500 --> 39:54.220
The only thing that was weird for me at first is that they actually changed the controls

39:54.220 --> 40:02.340
a little bit, but you can go back and change to a different layout if you need to.

40:02.340 --> 40:05.600
So I didn't do that.

40:05.600 --> 40:11.020
So I played with the default, which is this new one, where they add a button for you to

40:11.020 --> 40:12.560
be able to pick things up.

40:12.560 --> 40:14.800
So you can actually pick up food and pick up what...

40:14.800 --> 40:18.900
So it's a little weird because you don't use the attack button to do that, you use a separate

40:18.900 --> 40:19.900
button.

40:20.300 --> 40:21.300
So I'm real getting used to it.

40:21.300 --> 40:25.860
But again, you can change it back, I just kind of played with what the default was,

40:25.860 --> 40:28.060
which was this very weird kind of thing.

40:28.060 --> 40:29.780
So yeah.

40:29.780 --> 40:31.740
But otherwise, it's fun.

40:31.740 --> 40:32.740
The music's...

40:32.740 --> 40:35.080
Of course, I was curious what the music would be like.

40:35.080 --> 40:39.420
And even though the music is more like the old Streets of Rage game, which is good, Yuzo

40:39.420 --> 40:45.740
Koshiro's involved, I like Yuzo Koshiro from the stuff he did with the driving games and

40:45.740 --> 40:48.260
Actraiser and some of the other stuff.

40:48.260 --> 40:52.080
So the Streets of Rage music, I like enough.

40:52.080 --> 40:56.540
This is more like that, obviously, and not his other stuff, which I enjoy a lot more.

40:56.540 --> 40:58.100
But it's still fun.

40:58.100 --> 41:01.580
And I think if you do have Game Pass, you need to get on this.

41:01.580 --> 41:06.220
Otherwise, I think they're asking like 30 bucks for it, which may sound a little steep,

41:06.220 --> 41:11.540
but I feel like there's a lot of features that you kind of unlock as you go that are

41:11.540 --> 41:15.260
gonna make that price tag a lot easier.

41:15.260 --> 41:18.860
And this is one that you can play online, unlike those first three games.

41:18.860 --> 41:22.940
So I think that's gonna make it a lot easier for people to be able to like play online

41:22.940 --> 41:25.160
with friends, especially in this day and age, right?

41:25.160 --> 41:27.680
You can't go over to people's houses to play the game.

41:27.680 --> 41:30.800
So playing online is going to end up being a great thing.

41:30.800 --> 41:31.800
So yeah.

41:31.800 --> 41:32.800
There you go.

41:32.800 --> 41:36.740
Yeah, that kind of made me wonder too, because now that you mentioned the whole playing the

41:36.740 --> 41:42.580
same room thing, I'm not sure how long this whole COVID thing is going to go on, but that's

41:42.580 --> 41:48.740
going to be interesting once the Amico comes out, because they're all local multiplayer

41:48.740 --> 41:49.940
for that stuff.

41:49.940 --> 41:50.940
For sure.

41:50.940 --> 41:51.940
I'm sorry.

41:51.940 --> 41:53.940
Give me just another minute here, Loki.

41:53.940 --> 41:54.940
Sorry.

41:54.940 --> 41:55.940
This is live, folks.

41:55.940 --> 41:57.460
What can you do?

41:57.460 --> 42:00.620
So yeah, it'd be interesting to see how that's going to affect things.

42:00.620 --> 42:05.460
I am hoping by the time that comes out in October that, you know, things will be a little

42:05.460 --> 42:06.460
bit calmed down.

42:06.460 --> 42:10.280
But you know, that is a kind of a weird scenario.

42:10.280 --> 42:14.120
No one could have predicted that when you're going to release a brand new console at the

42:14.120 --> 42:15.120
end of the year.

42:15.120 --> 42:17.900
So what are you going to do, I guess?

42:17.900 --> 42:19.600
So I don't know.

42:19.600 --> 42:20.880
It'll be interesting to see.

42:20.880 --> 42:27.360
I hopefully will see some more stuff for that, especially with, you know, when E3 was supposed

42:27.360 --> 42:32.280
to have been happening in about a month or so away.

42:32.280 --> 42:38.400
Surprised to see that we haven't heard too much from like Sony or I know Nintendo's even

42:38.400 --> 42:42.640
talked about maybe not doing a digital event, but like even Sony just hearing some more

42:42.640 --> 42:46.960
information about what they've got in the pipeline coming out and stuff and I don't

42:46.960 --> 42:47.960
know.

42:47.960 --> 42:48.960
I just want to know more information.

42:48.960 --> 42:53.640
I feel like now with all these companies, you know, obviously E3 not happening and stuff

42:53.640 --> 42:57.360
and a lot of these companies say, no, we're not even going to do digital events that it's

42:57.360 --> 42:59.640
like, when am I going to find out my information?

42:59.640 --> 43:01.640
Okay, I'm back.

43:01.640 --> 43:02.640
Sorry.

43:02.640 --> 43:04.840
So I'm going to have to address this at some point.

43:04.840 --> 43:06.120
Dark soccer had to go.

43:06.120 --> 43:08.240
She had a family emergency.

43:08.240 --> 43:11.040
Something's come up that's extremely urgent.

43:11.040 --> 43:17.120
So she's needed to go sending thoughts and well wishes to her and her family right now

43:17.120 --> 43:18.120
for sure.

43:18.120 --> 43:20.840
It's not my place to give specifics right now.

43:20.840 --> 43:24.640
I will let her do so when she feels up to returning.

43:24.640 --> 43:28.680
For now, sorry to be blunt, but it is what it is.

43:28.680 --> 43:29.680
It's life.

43:29.680 --> 43:33.160
Anyway, Loki, we're going to carry on with the show.

43:33.160 --> 43:35.800
You were talking about retro consoles.

43:35.800 --> 43:39.560
And that actually reminded me because I have it sitting right here next to me.

43:39.560 --> 43:41.900
I ordered this little guy online this week.

43:41.900 --> 43:48.960
This Neo Geo Mini is something I picked up because it was on like a super sale on Amazon.

43:48.960 --> 43:49.960
Really?

43:49.960 --> 43:50.960
Yeah.

43:50.960 --> 43:56.000
Is that the one that looks like a little like a desktop cabinet or yes, it's like a tiny

43:56.000 --> 43:58.120
it's like those other it's a tiny little cat.

43:58.120 --> 43:59.680
It might be hard to see on the tour.

44:00.560 --> 44:05.800
It looks like my other little arcade machines that I collect and it's got 40 games in it,

44:05.800 --> 44:09.640
including like five different Metal Slug games, King of the Monsters, Magician Lord, King

44:09.640 --> 44:12.720
of Fighter, you know, all the stuff you'd expect to see here.

44:12.720 --> 44:15.980
I'm sure you'll have a great time seeing that on Twitch, but there's a list of all the games

44:15.980 --> 44:16.980
from the back.

44:16.980 --> 44:20.680
Why don't they just make like a arcade one up size cabinet for one of those?

44:20.680 --> 44:21.680
I'm kind of surprised.

44:21.680 --> 44:22.680
That would be awesome.

44:22.680 --> 44:24.000
I'm kind of surprised that too.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.040
But here's here's the thing that sold me on it.

44:26.040 --> 44:29.560
I wasn't necessarily going to get it at first because I was like that cabinet kind of looks

44:29.560 --> 44:31.620
like garbage to play on.

44:31.620 --> 44:32.880
But here's the thing.

44:32.880 --> 44:35.880
It has an HDMI out on it.

44:35.880 --> 44:40.520
So you can actually hook this baby up to a TV and play the Neo Geo games that way.

44:40.520 --> 44:42.720
I'm not sure if you can hook up a controller.

44:42.720 --> 44:44.440
I think that is a thing.

44:44.440 --> 44:47.680
I don't want to get quoted on that, though, but I believe I'm going to have to open this

44:47.680 --> 44:48.680
up and see.

44:48.680 --> 44:53.080
I might have it because I think some of the other minis that they've done, they can you

44:53.080 --> 44:55.560
could hook up Neo Geo controllers as well.

44:55.560 --> 44:56.560
Yeah.

44:56.560 --> 44:57.560
So that's pretty cool.

44:57.560 --> 44:58.560
Maybe somebody in chat actually.

44:58.560 --> 45:02.120
Adrian today says, yes, they have controllers, so I could actually probably order those separately

45:02.120 --> 45:07.500
if I wanted to play the Neo Geo games on the TV.

45:07.500 --> 45:09.240
So that's ultimately what sold me on it.

45:09.240 --> 45:12.240
I was like, oh, I don't have to play on the tiny little screen.

45:12.240 --> 45:13.440
I can actually play on the television.

45:13.440 --> 45:14.440
And that's pretty cool.

45:14.440 --> 45:15.440
Yeah, it was awesome.

45:15.440 --> 45:21.560
Like I said, I when I first got my candy cab, I had a multi cart for a Neo Geo thing for

45:21.560 --> 45:22.560
that.

45:22.560 --> 45:25.600
But then then I mailed that to Bobby for his super gun.

45:25.600 --> 45:29.240
So he has that now.

45:29.240 --> 45:31.280
Bobby says, when's the Twitch stream of it?

45:31.280 --> 45:34.520
When I get one of those controllers that I'm going to have to buy, because I don't I don't

45:34.520 --> 45:37.520
know how I would play with the tiny little thing.

45:37.520 --> 45:41.400
I mean, you know, I but I collect these types of things anyway.

45:41.400 --> 45:43.480
So like, you know, and for the price, what was it?

45:43.480 --> 45:44.480
I think it was only 30 bucks.

45:44.480 --> 45:45.480
It was like 20.

45:45.480 --> 45:47.160
I think normally it's about 50 and it was down to 30.

45:47.160 --> 45:48.640
And I was like, what the heck?

45:48.640 --> 45:49.640
That's a good price.

45:49.640 --> 45:53.260
So that'll be something I can talk about next week is the Neo Geo mini.

45:53.260 --> 45:54.260
So cool.

45:54.260 --> 45:55.260
Cool.

45:55.420 --> 45:58.580
Well, let's move on and we'll get into this week's news.

45:58.580 --> 46:00.420
So, Loki, why don't you start us off?

46:00.420 --> 46:05.340
Well, they alluded to talking about other companies announcing their events and that

46:05.340 --> 46:09.500
being kind of up in the air as far as we even have like cancellations with Nintendo and

46:09.500 --> 46:10.500
stuff like that.

46:10.500 --> 46:14.600
But at least there is one that we can count on and it's right around the corner.

46:14.600 --> 46:21.540
So coming up later this week on May 7th, we will see Xbox Series X gameplay for the first

46:21.540 --> 46:22.540
time.

46:22.540 --> 46:27.380
Probably not the first time because we've had some demos, but more of it.

46:27.380 --> 46:30.780
That's going to be coming May 7th.

46:30.780 --> 46:38.340
They're going to show new gameplay, including a gameplay trailer for Assassin's Creed Valhalla,

46:38.340 --> 46:43.940
which they had a cinematic trailer for that earlier this week.

46:43.940 --> 46:47.480
So that was something.

46:47.480 --> 46:54.280
No idea what other games are going to be out there during that time, but I'm very curious

46:54.280 --> 46:58.600
to see what spec, well, they already talked about specs, but more details.

46:58.600 --> 47:02.840
I want to know more details about it and just trying to get excited about that kind of stuff.

47:02.840 --> 47:05.760
So I'm looking forward to that.

47:05.760 --> 47:06.760
That's going to be streaming.

47:06.760 --> 47:11.720
It looks like 11 a.m. Eastern time on Thursday.

47:11.720 --> 47:14.240
She Hulk 10 in our chat says, hopefully a new fable.

47:14.240 --> 47:15.240
I am with you.

47:15.240 --> 47:16.240
She Hulk.

47:16.240 --> 47:21.240
I was like to see it will be very interesting, though, without the involvement of Molyneux.

47:21.240 --> 47:22.800
But I'm OK with that.

47:22.800 --> 47:23.800
Let's see.

47:23.800 --> 47:24.800
Let's see what else does with it.

47:24.800 --> 47:25.800
Don't think I'll be a problem.

47:25.800 --> 47:28.080
Yeah, I think at the end of the day, it won't be a huge issue.

47:28.080 --> 47:29.080
It'll be interesting.

47:29.080 --> 47:33.720
It'll be I'm curious what creative direction the game takes and like what kind of elements

47:33.720 --> 47:35.920
it holds on to, like some of the choice things.

47:35.920 --> 47:37.160
I'd be very curious about that.

47:37.160 --> 47:38.920
I feel like it's going to happen.

47:38.920 --> 47:41.520
I feel that the rumbles and the rumors, but we'll see.

47:41.520 --> 47:43.560
I don't want to we won't necessarily see it this week.

47:43.560 --> 47:44.560
I don't know.

47:44.560 --> 47:48.440
Well, it sounds to me because you've got your you know, we've already kind of seen lately

47:48.440 --> 47:53.680
with just different games how these, you know, sort of Final Fantasy seven remake.

47:53.680 --> 47:58.240
But I mean, obviously the stuff would have been planned long in advance.

47:58.240 --> 48:03.120
You know, I really think like having a core RPG game on the platform would be very essential,

48:03.120 --> 48:08.180
especially since we're not going to have like an Elder Scrolls six for a long time or a

48:08.180 --> 48:10.920
new fallout or something like that.

48:10.920 --> 48:15.880
I would think that a fable will do very well for that as well, because you got the Halo

48:15.880 --> 48:19.620
to kind of take care of like the action stuff as well in the FPS.

48:19.620 --> 48:22.800
So I would I would hope that we'd see that sort of things.

48:22.800 --> 48:27.200
I'm just more curious to see what's coming from all these studios that they, you know,

48:27.200 --> 48:32.340
picked up a year or so ago to see what they're working on.

48:32.340 --> 48:34.280
That's what I'm really interested to see.

48:34.280 --> 48:37.340
S.H.A. 100 Matt in chat says, I'm ready to see this damn thing in action.

48:37.340 --> 48:40.900
This drip feed is getting a little irritating.

48:40.900 --> 48:46.520
And you know, yeah, I feel like this this cycle especially has really been drawn out

48:46.520 --> 48:47.520
for a bit.

48:47.520 --> 48:48.520
Right.

48:48.520 --> 48:51.020
Hasn't it kind of felt like the PlayStation four and the Xbox one have been kind of like

48:51.020 --> 48:54.700
lame ducks for a little bit while we're like waiting for the PlayStation five and what's

48:54.700 --> 48:58.740
new with Microsoft and everything like yes, I know we've had at least still the Final

48:58.740 --> 49:01.380
Fantasy seven remake and we're getting Last of Us two.

49:01.380 --> 49:04.500
There are still games from this generation for us to get excited about.

49:04.500 --> 49:08.280
But I can't help but feel that because we know backwards compatibility is going to play

49:08.280 --> 49:09.280
into this next generation.

49:09.280 --> 49:12.200
It's kind of like, OK, well, all these games are putting out they're going to work on the

49:12.200 --> 49:13.480
new ones, too.

49:13.480 --> 49:15.220
So let's get to that hardware.

49:15.220 --> 49:16.220
So it does.

49:16.220 --> 49:19.480
It does feel like this lead up, even though it probably honestly has been the same amount

49:19.480 --> 49:21.160
of time as has been any other generation.

49:21.160 --> 49:22.160
Fine.

49:22.160 --> 49:24.720
It just feels like this lead up has been an awful long time.

49:24.720 --> 49:26.320
Maybe that's something about the Internet age we live in.

49:26.320 --> 49:27.720
I don't know.

49:27.720 --> 49:36.200
But on this on the same side, we the first week of May is probably earlier than I think

49:36.200 --> 49:40.040
we most of us would have been expecting to hear this information, which I think would

49:40.040 --> 49:41.600
have been the first week of June.

49:41.600 --> 49:46.000
It's hard to say what they wanted to do a pre event before E3, kind of like what happened

49:46.000 --> 49:50.200
with Xbox one, although that didn't go so well for Microsoft that time.

49:50.200 --> 49:51.200
You know, I don't know.

49:51.200 --> 49:58.080
But this this regardless of why or what this is, this is this is what's going to happen.

49:58.080 --> 50:00.920
So we'll get to see this week.

50:00.920 --> 50:02.680
Yeah.

50:02.680 --> 50:07.400
Gripper O2 says, are there any new games to sway us into buying the new consoles?

50:07.400 --> 50:08.960
Well, that's what we're going to find out.

50:08.960 --> 50:13.200
Keep in mind, Microsoft has scooped up oodles and oodles of companies over the past couple

50:13.200 --> 50:14.200
of years.

50:14.200 --> 50:16.340
That's some of the biggest news to come out of Microsoft.

50:16.340 --> 50:20.520
So they've really been laying out the pieces and making strategical moves to really come

50:20.520 --> 50:22.440
out swinging this generation.

50:22.440 --> 50:27.000
So I think Microsoft stands to answer some of those questions on Thursday.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.980
Will they show us everything?

50:28.980 --> 50:29.980
I doubt it.

50:30.900 --> 50:34.020
I would taper your expectations a little bit.

50:34.020 --> 50:39.940
We'll probably get one or two new games that'll show off the hardware.

50:39.940 --> 50:46.820
My guess, we will absolutely have a sports game of some type, but that will include racing.

50:46.820 --> 50:51.740
That could include a Forza, whether it's Horizon or mainline or something new.

50:51.740 --> 50:55.620
I would absolutely bet like Forza is somehow one of the games we're going to see.

50:55.620 --> 50:58.620
The other game could be literally anything.

50:58.620 --> 51:02.900
And I would guess it's really going to be, and one reason why I specifically peg racing

51:02.900 --> 51:07.800
and sports, those are the games that really, and especially Forza, and that's why I really

51:07.800 --> 51:09.540
think it's going to be Forza, something.

51:09.540 --> 51:10.540
Forza is something.

51:10.540 --> 51:17.140
And yes, I know it's the right year for Horizon, but I think all bets are off when it comes

51:17.140 --> 51:18.780
to the regular schedule of Forza.

51:18.780 --> 51:20.620
I think it could be Forza anything.

51:20.620 --> 51:22.220
I'd love for it to be Horizon.

51:22.220 --> 51:27.260
But racing games are going to really show off the power of the system and things like

51:27.260 --> 51:32.620
ray tracing and all the things that these games are going to bring to the tables.

51:32.620 --> 51:37.420
That's why I fully expect it'll be a Forza universe type of game that we're going to

51:37.420 --> 51:39.420
see this week.

51:39.420 --> 51:42.340
Bobby Blackwell says it'll be Forza Motorsport 8.

51:42.340 --> 51:43.340
Yeah.

51:43.340 --> 51:49.020
And Bobby says all Xbox consoles have released with a racing game outside the first one.

51:49.020 --> 51:50.020
And I'll-

51:50.020 --> 51:51.020
Oh, yeah.

51:51.020 --> 51:52.020
Oh, yeah.

51:52.020 --> 51:53.020
What?

51:53.020 --> 51:54.020
What?

51:54.020 --> 51:55.020
What?

51:55.020 --> 51:56.020
Let's see a new bridge racer game.

51:56.020 --> 51:57.020
Come on.

51:57.780 --> 51:59.500
Maybe on the PlayStation 5 reveal, but we're not there yet.

51:59.500 --> 52:00.500
We're not there yet.

52:00.500 --> 52:03.820
Come on, they're not console specific anymore.

52:03.820 --> 52:04.820
Come on.

52:04.820 --> 52:05.820
Come on.

52:05.820 --> 52:06.820
Come on.

52:06.820 --> 52:07.820
It's been like, how many years now?

52:07.820 --> 52:08.820
Like in the PETA one.

52:08.820 --> 52:12.780
I'm not counting that because that was garbage, but like, let's, let's, let's get a new, new

52:12.780 --> 52:13.780
Ridge Racer game.

52:13.780 --> 52:14.780
Come on.

52:14.780 --> 52:18.180
Frodo Swaggins asked a great question in chat saying, what do you think about the power

52:18.180 --> 52:25.500
difference between PlayStation 5 and Series X?

52:25.500 --> 52:29.580
I don't think we'll know until we actually see what, how the games use everything because

52:29.580 --> 52:32.260
like it's just all specs right now.

52:32.260 --> 52:35.060
It doesn't mean anything until we actually see them in action.

52:35.060 --> 52:41.380
Um, yeah, it, it, it doesn't really matter without the games and the proof is the Nintendo

52:41.380 --> 52:42.540
Switch.

52:42.540 --> 52:43.540
That's my answer.

52:43.540 --> 52:48.580
Nintendo Switch, because Nintendo Switch is not bringing that same technology to the table

52:48.580 --> 52:51.900
that these, I mean, it's a different thing with the whole games on the go and all that,

52:51.900 --> 52:57.140
but Nintendo Switch still look at the sales figure of Animal Crossing, the Nintendo Switch

52:57.140 --> 53:02.780
does very well holding its place in gaming while not being the most technologically superior

53:02.780 --> 53:03.780
console.

53:03.780 --> 53:07.380
I do think price is going to be important.

53:07.380 --> 53:14.580
Um, and I don't think Sony or Microsoft wants to find themselves as launching the more expensive

53:14.580 --> 53:15.580
console.

53:15.580 --> 53:21.020
Um, but we'll see at the end of the day, it's going to be the games that are the most important

53:21.020 --> 53:22.420
period.

53:22.420 --> 53:23.920
So we'll see.

53:23.920 --> 53:26.580
And She-Hulk 10 says you won't notice without a new TV.

53:26.580 --> 53:30.580
And that could be very, that's a very good point as well is that I still don't have a

53:30.580 --> 53:32.580
4k TV.

53:32.580 --> 53:36.100
You may not know this, you can get one like sub 500 now.

53:36.100 --> 53:41.020
I mean, it's like, it just, well, for one, I'm just so irritated because of how much

53:41.020 --> 53:46.900
I paid for the TV I currently have, but also I'm just kind of like in this day and age,

53:46.900 --> 53:49.180
I'm like, it's just not been a priority for me.

53:49.180 --> 53:56.140
I do have a 4k computer monitor and that's put the console in there.

53:56.140 --> 53:57.140
Here's the crazy thing.

53:57.140 --> 53:59.420
I actually bought a new graphics card.

53:59.420 --> 54:03.760
We've been waiting to install the new graphics card because we need a new power supply, but

54:03.760 --> 54:06.140
get this, did you know there's like some freak power supply?

54:06.140 --> 54:09.100
Well, I should say free cause it's probably because of COVID and all that.

54:09.100 --> 54:12.020
There's like a power supply shortage going on right now.

54:12.020 --> 54:13.020
Try to go get one.

54:13.020 --> 54:21.300
What kind of power, how, how much of a power, oh, uh, eight, one of those are like impossible

54:21.300 --> 54:22.300
to find.

54:22.300 --> 54:24.060
Uh, and seven fifties aren't easy either.

54:24.060 --> 54:27.820
Uh, and I feel like when I was on Best Buy site, uh, it was like, you could find things

54:27.820 --> 54:33.740
in the cheat, like the 300, 400 range or the 1200 range, but like everything in the middle

54:33.740 --> 54:34.740
ain't there.

54:34.740 --> 54:36.620
And Newegg didn't have anything?

54:36.620 --> 54:37.620
No.

54:37.620 --> 54:40.580
Or it was all like not in stock till the end of may and things like that.

54:40.580 --> 54:42.140
I would check eBay or something.

54:42.140 --> 54:44.380
eBay has been pretty fast to ship stuff.

54:44.380 --> 54:45.380
It's weird.

54:45.380 --> 54:50.940
No, I actually ordered a power supply on Amazon and it said, uh, we ordered it the first week

54:50.940 --> 54:56.180
of April and it said it'll be there April 28th, April 28th comes and goes.

54:56.180 --> 54:59.820
And the next day I get an email that's like, can you confirm you still want this because

54:59.820 --> 55:01.980
we don't know when we're going to have it in stock.

55:01.980 --> 55:03.620
And I was a little irritated.

55:03.620 --> 55:08.880
I thought it was because they weren't shipping anything other than essential, you know, things

55:08.880 --> 55:09.880
until later.

55:10.120 --> 55:13.720
No, cause I got, I wouldn't call this Neo Geo mini essential.

55:13.720 --> 55:18.080
I think I had to wait an extra day or two than I normally would, but no big deal.

55:18.080 --> 55:21.440
I'm not going to be all like, can I speak to the manager about it?

55:21.440 --> 55:26.040
But I was a little irked that like, I kind of felt like if they didn't have it and they

55:26.040 --> 55:29.320
didn't know when they were going to, I kind of wasn't getting a realistic, but I'm trying

55:29.320 --> 55:33.840
not to, you know, soccer mom manager about it.

55:33.840 --> 55:38.160
You know, I'm trying to just be like, all right, maybe they were expecting it, but because

55:38.200 --> 55:42.280
the factories are closed to the world situation, they didn't make them in time, whatever.

55:42.280 --> 55:43.280
I'm just trying to keep my cool.

55:44.400 --> 55:48.080
But yeah, it's trying to find a power supply right now is a little weird.

55:48.080 --> 55:49.360
So I don't know what's up with that.

55:49.880 --> 55:51.280
So, OK, yeah.

55:52.320 --> 55:56.920
Anyway, yeah, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, yeah, I really want to build a new computer,

55:56.920 --> 55:58.360
but right now is the hardest time.

55:58.560 --> 56:02.400
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Because everybody's trying to work from home or spending the stimulus

56:02.400 --> 56:05.560
money and all that stuff is factoring into that.

56:05.720 --> 56:11.920
So anyhow, back to the Xbox, we'll see more stuff this week.

56:11.920 --> 56:14.760
I'm very excited to see it in motion.

56:14.760 --> 56:19.320
I think a lot of us are. So we will definitely talk about that next week on the show.

56:19.680 --> 56:24.680
All right. In the meantime, let's talk about Google Stadia.

56:25.280 --> 56:28.080
Remember, there was a Stadia Connect that happened this past week.

56:28.080 --> 56:29.080
Did you all remember that?

56:29.560 --> 56:32.920
Yeah. Yeah. Because social media was like dead silent on it.

56:32.920 --> 56:36.840
And I kind of like forgot until I was looking for stories.

56:38.240 --> 56:41.280
Yeah, right. Well, here's what you missed at the Google Stadia Connect.

56:41.440 --> 56:43.880
I don't know. Like some of this news is kind of like, oh, yeah.

56:44.600 --> 56:47.760
Player Unknown Battlegrounds is now on Stadia.

56:47.760 --> 56:50.400
I mean, that is kind of a big game.

56:50.600 --> 56:54.840
And it's something that you can actually get for free if you are a Google Stadia pro

56:54.840 --> 56:58.240
subscriber, which remember, they gave that away for two months.

56:58.240 --> 57:01.080
So they have a lot of people who are pro subscribers right now.

57:01.800 --> 57:03.560
So that's a pretty big land.

57:03.560 --> 57:06.520
And, you know, first person shooter game, that's something that might look a little

57:06.520 --> 57:10.040
better on something like Stadia, depending on your Internet connection and all that

57:10.640 --> 57:14.360
versus, you know, how it might look on your computer without something like that.

57:14.360 --> 57:15.760
I don't know. It depends on your situation.

57:16.560 --> 57:20.600
But then, you know, the fact that they've also announced that they're partnering with

57:20.600 --> 57:23.360
Electronic Arts. So that's pretty big.

57:23.360 --> 57:27.840
They're going to bring things like Madden, FIFA and Star Wars Jedi Order.

57:28.000 --> 57:29.240
Now, say what you will.

57:29.240 --> 57:33.200
But let's not forget that Madden is like the biggest selling game in this country.

57:33.520 --> 57:37.560
So that being on Stadia now is an option.

57:37.840 --> 57:39.960
That could be interesting to see how that plays out.

57:39.960 --> 57:45.400
Again, I'm not sure Stadia has really proven itself as hardware to the masses, to

57:45.400 --> 57:47.920
the dirty casuals, if you will.

57:48.200 --> 57:52.760
But if Google can kind of push that, it would be interesting to see how many people

57:52.760 --> 57:55.040
might buy into that. I don't know.

57:55.040 --> 57:59.600
I think their positioning, the EA partnership is very interesting, I will say.

57:59.600 --> 58:02.720
You know, you can talk all the smack you want about Stadia, but I think that's

58:02.720 --> 58:06.640
important. And I think it's important to get people on board who might not otherwise

58:06.640 --> 58:11.040
be on board with Stadia because of sports, sports, sports, sports, you know, things I

58:11.040 --> 58:13.240
know we don't get into as much here on Orange Launch Radio.

58:13.440 --> 58:16.880
But I'm certainly not going to deny those games are fucking huge and that there are

58:16.880 --> 58:19.280
people that only buy sports, sports, sports, sports.

58:19.360 --> 58:21.880
And that's, you know, that they are gamers, too, for sure.

58:22.200 --> 58:23.280
So, all right.

58:24.080 --> 58:30.400
Anyhow, other things, Octopath Traveler, Square Enix just released on Stadia as well.

58:30.400 --> 58:31.400
That's a pretty big deal.

58:31.520 --> 58:35.360
And then they also talked about some games that will be first on Stadia.

58:35.360 --> 58:38.520
So they're not saying exclusive, but they're saying first on Stadia.

58:38.760 --> 58:44.480
One of the games was Crayta, which is a platform to build games and play games.

58:45.120 --> 58:49.480
It is very similar looking to Fortnite because it's also built in Unreal Engine.

58:50.080 --> 58:52.480
So it's a way to build and play your own games.

58:52.480 --> 58:55.000
I guess you could say like Little Big Planet or Dreams type of thing.

58:55.440 --> 58:56.520
But it'll be on Stadia.

58:56.520 --> 58:59.520
That's kind of interesting because I don't usually think of like create your own thing

58:59.520 --> 59:02.640
on a Stadia device because it's in the cloud, but that's kind of neat.

59:02.640 --> 59:09.320
Also, Ember is another game, which you play a firefighter, but it sounds like not a very

59:09.320 --> 59:09.680
good one.

59:09.680 --> 59:11.040
You might actually be setting fires.

59:11.040 --> 59:13.920
I don't remember what the gag was with this whole thing, but that is another game that

59:13.920 --> 59:14.720
is coming out as well.

59:14.720 --> 59:20.240
So they are showing us at least a few other games for Stadia.

59:20.240 --> 59:24.000
And if you haven't turned on your Stadia, well, I keep saying turn on your Stadia, even

59:24.000 --> 59:29.680
though it's not an actual device, but let's say fired up your Stadia account on the web

59:29.680 --> 59:33.760
or on your Chromecast, it might be a good reason to go back and check things out.

59:33.760 --> 59:34.160
I don't know.

59:34.480 --> 59:36.240
Player Unknown Battlegrounds might be kind of neat.

59:36.240 --> 59:36.720
I don't know.

59:37.240 --> 59:39.160
But I know a lot of people aren't into first person shooters either.

59:39.160 --> 59:41.880
So, so what do you think, Loki?

59:41.880 --> 59:44.560
Like, do you think Google, do you think the EA thinks a big deal?

59:44.560 --> 59:48.800
Or do you think Stadia is like, you know what, Stadia really needed to get moving by now

59:48.800 --> 59:49.680
and it still hasn't.

59:49.680 --> 59:50.560
And that's bad.

59:50.560 --> 59:51.840
I think it's the latter.

59:51.840 --> 59:56.000
I think it needs to have EA to be able to compete out there.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.080
I just, I don't see the draw.

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:00.880
I really don't.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:07.760
I mean, aside from the potential where I don't have to buy a console to play games, it's

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:10.240
just, I don't know.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.560
It's not something I would invest in.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:14.240
Yep.

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:14.960
So we'll see.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:15.680
I mean, we'll see.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.440
It's an interesting maneuver.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:21.600
I don't, I don't think this week's worth of news was enough.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:27.440
I really think they needed to start to clue in how more people can get on Stadia.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:30.080
Like, I need to see like exclusive games.

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.240
Like this is only something you can get on Stadia.

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.880
Cause that's the thing is that it's like, yeah, it's cool.

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.800
You have Madden, so does everybody else.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:40.000
And they've had it for a long time now and now you're just getting it.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:47.680
And it's like, I need to see like why I want to choose your platform because there's the

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:49.840
fact that it's, it's strictly digital.

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.920
It's, it's a Google service.

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.280
So you're not sure it's like, is this going to be around for a long time?

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.080
I mean, I just, I don't know.

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:02.080
I really have a hard time trusting that this would be a good thing.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:06.640
Like nowadays, if, if everything's stayed the way it was, where bandwidth is unlimited

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:13.760
and everything, maybe, uh, after everything goes back to normal, it's going to be a hard sell.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.440
And I just don't see it.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:24.240
Um, I really think Google needs to be a little more, um, like they need to reach out to a more

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:28.800
casual audience a lot more aggressively, and maybe they're not ready for that for whatever reason,

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:35.360
but I really think they should be running ads right now that are akin to go to stadia.google.com

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:38.720
to play Madden right now, you know, which obviously they're not ready for that yet,

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.400
but that needs to kind of be the message.

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:43.600
They need to drop this whole, like you get a pro account.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:46.800
That stuff is confusing to a non gamer audience.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:50.960
It's not confusing to you or me, but to a non gamer audience, the message needs to be

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.320
very fucking simple.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.400
It needs to be, Hey, do you want to play Madden, but you don't have a game console.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:00.400
Go to stadia.google.com right now to play Madden online with your friends.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:01.600
That should be the message.

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.760
And it needs to be just that simple.

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:07.120
If you have to jump through all these fucking hoops about, you know, signing up for this

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:10.400
account and that account and tying it to your Google account, all this stuff, they're never

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.720
going to tap the base that they need to be tapping.

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:15.600
And I think it's just that simple.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.200
I think the messaging needs to be better.

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:21.920
And I also want to see like the examples of that integration they were talking about with

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:26.160
like YouTube and stuff, or if I'm streaming a game and someone can come join me in my

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.280
game or something like that.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:32.000
Like I want to see more of that sort of thing is showing up on here, but like doesn't really

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:32.960
seem like there's anything like that.

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:36.240
Like if for some reason, I mean, Microsoft would never put it on their service since

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:39.920
they have their own streaming service, but let's assume like, Hey, Minecraft is on there.

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:42.800
And then you have someone streaming Minecraft and they're like, Hey, you want to come play

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:43.760
with us on our server?

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:48.560
You know, click this link, go and immediately connect, play Minecraft without having to

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:49.920
have it installed or anything like that.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:52.640
Google could do that with YouTube if they wanted to.

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:55.840
If they want to leverage their muscle with YouTube, they could do it because I'm sitting

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:59.280
here about to make a comment about, well, one thing I don't think made our show world

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:04.560
tonight, but Amazon games, um, I think talked a little more about new world.

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:05.920
Um, I'm going to be quite honest.

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:09.200
I really understand it and I'm not going to until I actually get to play the game.

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.360
So that's about all I have to say about new world.

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:15.360
Um, but I would imagine it would be very likely that Amazon could integrate something like

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.240
that into Twitch.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.800
Hey, do you want to come play this MMO with me right now?

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:22.480
Use this extension or whatever to just tap here and come play with me.

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.880
Google could leverage YouTube to do the same thing.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.080
Well, right.

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:28.960
They have it built in for Stadia stuff, but there's not really any games.

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:31.920
I've seen that they're going to be using that first day.

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:32.560
I don't know.

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.040
I don't know.

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:37.040
And I don't know if it's due to the world, you know, COVID Corona situation or what.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:40.960
Um, but I feel like Google isn't moving as fast enough as we all expected them to.

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.320
This is like the best time.

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:45.200
Like this is the ideal situation for them.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:50.320
And if it can't take off in the ideal situation for them, where everybody has this available

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:54.880
space and a lot of people are stuck at home, it's like, I mean, it's not going to take

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.640
off if this is not going to happen now.

01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:00.480
Now is the time for Google to do this.

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:05.280
Because if they wait like literally one more month there, it's too late.

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:09.440
And I, that's why I'm kind of like this, what happened this week needed to be it.

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:13.280
And it wasn't like, I'm not saying what they announced was crap or anything like that.

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.600
I don't think it was, but it wasn't enough.

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:21.600
It needed to be the next phase of Stadia because now what's going to happen is now, you know,

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:25.360
E3 and I'm using my quotey fingers is going to end up happening in June.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:29.280
When I'm using my quotey fingers, it's E3 replacement stuff and things we would have

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.960
seen at E3 are going to start happening.

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:32.880
And then it's like, oh, Madden's on PlayStation.

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:33.840
I know PlayStation.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:35.040
I know Xbox.

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:36.080
I know those things.

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.960
I'm going to end up getting my game on those consoles.

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:39.280
Yeah.

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:39.440
Yeah.

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:44.960
We're going to have Madden and we're going to have EA games on this platform.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:49.200
And then next week, you know, we're going to have all the Microsoft exclusives like,

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.120
oh yeah, I want to get it on my platform.

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:51.600
Well, guess what?

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.720
They have their own streaming platform.

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:56.160
They'll need your Google Stadia to stream those games.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:02.560
So it's like, I just don't I don't see it happening because they don't have enough

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:05.280
draw to bring people to that platform.

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:09.200
They need some exclusive games that are out now.

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:16.000
And I'm sorry, Destiny 2 and Madden is not really going to be a draw when it's on all

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.320
the other platforms already that people have had probably years already.

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:21.920
I just I don't see it.

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:22.160
Yeah.

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:27.600
And something like, you know, the firefighting game, like as Ember, as cute as that sounds,

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:30.720
as neat as that sounds, that's not going to pull the fucking muscle.

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:34.880
Like Google, use your muscle to get that exclusive that you need.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:40.160
You know, hey, get EA to give you Madden first for a week.

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:45.600
That's the kind of like big dick energy we're going to need from Google Stadia for people

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.720
to be talking about it.

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:50.640
Oh, and EA is only on that platform until they come up with their own streaming platform.

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.720
I think they've already said they want to do their own thing.

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:58.080
So well, there's that there's that whole EA access that kind of ties into Xbox.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:58.800
I mean, you're right.

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:01.440
It's probably only a matter of time before Origin becomes that.

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:01.920
Who knows?

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:02.640
Yeah.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.520
As soon as they don't need Google anymore, they're gone.

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:08.160
I mean, just look at like the Nvidia sharing and stuff like that.

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:12.960
I mean, I'm sure all these companies will drop them as soon as they have their own solutions

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:15.120
because they don't want to pay anybody to have their own platform.

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:15.840
They want their own.

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:16.960
They want to control all of it.

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.480
They want their own ecosystem.

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:19.680
All right.

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:22.880
Well, let's move on to the next story because this will tie this tie into this a little

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:23.280
bit.

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:26.320
We're having to produce on the fly a little bit because Jamie was going to talk about

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:26.400
this.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.920
Do you want to do this or you want me to do it?

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:28.240
Sure.

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:29.600
Let's talk about Summer Games Fest.

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:30.000
OK.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:36.480
Summer Games Fest is going to be going on from now to the end of August or during summer.

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:45.520
So it's basically going to be a very long like kind of industry wide celebration of

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:45.920
games.

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:53.200
And it's going to be like I guess this digital event that's going to include different shows

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:59.760
including lives from like Bethesda, Blizzard, CD Projekt Red, EA, Microsoft, Riot, Sony

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:00.720
and Square Enix.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:07.920
They said the event's going to take or they're going to stream on all major platforms.

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:12.400
So Facebook, Mixer, Twitch, Twitter and YouTube.

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:18.240
And they're going to have different details, I guess, for those events are going to come

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:20.720
I guess later on as soon as they announce those.

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:26.240
I don't know if the Xbox thing is necessarily considered one of those, but I don't know.

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:30.560
But Steam and Xbox are going to offer demos and trials for some games limited time.

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:35.920
Steam's games festival summer edition supposed to be taking place June 9th through the 14th.

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:40.160
And this is all being hosted, I guess, by Jeff Keeley's putting this on.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.400
So it's pretty cool.

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:47.040
I want this is where I was just saying I want to learn more about the stuff that's coming

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:47.440
up.

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:51.920
I just wish there was more of a timeline to kind of tell me, you know, when all this is

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:56.160
going to happen, because it doesn't really specify.

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:01.280
And like, I don't know, but it's cool.

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:05.600
So that's kind of like their game awards thing.

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:09.120
Yeah, I mean, the whole thing is kind of like interesting, but it's weird that it's like

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:09.920
four months.

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.440
Like, that's not that's not a festival.

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.160
That's not a highlight.

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:16.160
That's like a that's the general gaming news flow.

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:20.960
It's like it's almost like I'm launching a website where I'm going to get all these exclusives

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:21.440
first.

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:23.040
And it's called Summer Game Fest.

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:27.760
You know, I just like and maybe it's just because also it's this whole nature of the

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.600
virtual world we're living in right now.

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:34.240
But I don't think I really, really, truly believe and I believe me.

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:38.720
I understand the narrative of things are not going to go back to the way they were for

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:40.320
a very long time.

01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:46.560
Like, I understand that things like sporting events, travel, you know, there are things

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:52.480
where many, many Dragon Con where many, many people gather that there's still a big question

01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:54.560
mark that hangs over a lot of that.

01:08:54.560 --> 01:09:00.160
But for the most part, like I, I feel like we'll be able to kind of like gather in like

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:01.360
small groups.

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:07.040
You'll still be able to like go to restaurant on a Saturday night in a few months as opposed

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.520
to, you know, a year and a half.

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:12.160
I don't think we go back to normal normal like life.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.720
Well, I don't think we ever go back to that 100%.

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:19.760
I think, for example, seeing masks in public, whereas maybe in some countries that was a

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:23.120
very common thing you would see when people are sick and we didn't really have that here.

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:25.200
I think I think that'll be a permanent fixture.

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:27.040
I think when people are sick, they're going to wear masks.

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:30.320
You know, I think that's something you're going to see more and more common.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.720
But anyway, I don't want to digress too much.

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:38.640
My point is, is that, you know, maybe my mindset is this because I think of festival as we

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:41.920
gather for a week at South by Southwest and we talk about these types of things.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.200
We do these types of things.

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:48.400
And I understand that, like, you know, maybe we can't have a festival in person anymore

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:49.120
or what have you.

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:59.360
But like four months of this online gathering, it's long and I don't think online culture

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:02.240
like it is in the quarantine scenario.

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.240
Exists in four months.

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:12.080
I don't think we're living our lives on Zoom 100% in four months, maybe 20%, but not 100%

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:12.800
like we are now.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:13.300
You know what I mean?

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:15.680
Yeah, so.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:23.040
But anyway, yeah, so the four month thing is a little weird to me.

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:27.440
I think that's just because maybe and maybe he has a series of exclusives that are going

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.920
to take him up through the Game Awards or something like that.

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:30.720
But it's just I don't know.

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:32.560
It's very it's very interesting.

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:39.600
But I could also see how maybe companies that were pushing to get things done for E3 week

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:44.640
are not able to make that happen because they've had to deal with the very real situation of

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:50.960
transitioning employees to working from home and not it doesn't necessarily end up in 100%

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:51.520
productivity.

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:54.640
In fact, it rarely does when it starts.

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:57.840
You know, like you can have some people are hell, they're more productive at home.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.120
But like there's hurdles.

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.320
There's just all sorts of technological hurdles people have to get through before you're

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:06.800
able to, you know, kind of adjust to being at home all the time.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:13.520
And so maybe companies that were going to do this thing for E3 week have kind of had

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:16.880
to push back their announces to all sorts of different times.

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:21.120
So now it's like, hey, that thing we were going to E3 week, it's like four months out

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.200
from when we were going to do it or another company like two months.

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:27.040
I guess they're counting the Xbox thing as part of this.

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.800
OK, I don't know.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:31.680
Interesting.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:33.200
But I don't know why.

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:38.720
What makes this special designation important?

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:40.080
That's what I'm missing.

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:44.080
Because honestly, when you say, oh, we're going to trickle down big gaming news for

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:48.800
four months, I'm just like, that's just normal.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.720
Yeah, that's just the summer in games.

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:57.360
You know, OK, it's not all going to be in one week like it was in years past.

01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:58.080
We knew that.

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:03.280
But like what's going to make Summerfest because the minute something is announced

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:07.440
on this Summerfest site, you know, Kotaku is going to have it.

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:08.960
Eurogamer is going to have it.

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.160
Twitter is going to have it.

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.120
Facebook is going to have it.

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.600
Like the news will just be there.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:14.160
You know what I mean?

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:19.040
So I don't know that that's and I'm not I'm not trying to dog on it.

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:21.040
You know, Jeff Keighley is a smart dude.

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.280
Like there's obviously a piece of this I'm missing.

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:26.400
And maybe it's one of those things I just don't see until it happens.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.520
Four months of advertisers.

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:30.320
I don't know.

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:33.440
But yeah, I'm just I'm just kind of confused on a few things.

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:36.400
I don't know.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:38.160
All right.

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.600
I just am glad to see some some information whatsoever.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:42.240
Yeah.

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:43.040
So all right.

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:45.840
So let's move on to the next story that you had, Loki.

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:46.720
Yes.

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:50.880
Unfortunately, Jamie would have loved this as well, but I thought this was kind of interesting.

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:56.160
So everybody's stuck at home and a lot of people are playing Animal Crossing.

01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:03.440
There was a social media post by the Queer Eye Twitter user that was saying, hey,

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:09.040
if you go ahead and show a share your designs in your house,

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:13.680
Bobby Burke is going to actually take a look at that stuff and give you tips about

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:18.160
home decorating since he's the interior designer on the show.

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.560
So I thought that was funny.

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:24.720
So there is folks like showing off some of the different things that they're making.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.040
And he's giving comments about them.

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:29.120
Pretty neat.

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:30.480
Yeah.

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:34.320
It's a very it's a nice little modern twist on things, isn't it?

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:36.240
Yeah, it's funny.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:41.760
It's like it's what was the isn't it like the happy home designers or something like

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:44.960
that or happy home, something or other that's in the game itself.

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:47.760
And then it's like, you know, he's almost like a member of that now.

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:52.880
I remember where they evaluate like your home and how it how it is.

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:53.840
Yeah, you're right.

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:55.280
The happy home designer thing.

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:55.920
All right, cool.

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.880
I remember the happy home designer was like a game.

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:00.880
But like I remember it's happy home something.

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:03.840
But yeah, it's been a while since I played Animal Crossing.

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:06.000
Still haven't gotten to touch my switch version yet.

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:09.360
What's the holdup?

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:13.440
The kids are monopolizing the switch.

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:16.560
And after that, it's like watching TV and stuff.

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.400
So I just haven't got a chance to.

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:20.260
All right.

01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:26.820
I'm waiting for is Jonathan Van Ness involved in this, though, or is it just Bobby, the

01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:28.100
the home guy that's doing this?

01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:30.340
I think it's just Bobby.

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:36.260
Oh, see, I I like Jonathan the best because he calls everything fierce and gorgeous.

01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:38.420
And it's you look so gorgeous in that.

01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:44.340
So maybe he'll start to address some of the attire that you wear in the in the game,

01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:50.100
which, by the way, I don't know if you notice, but on stream, I'm wearing my meme shirt.

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:54.820
I said on a previous episode that like that meme shirt that's an Animal Crossing.

01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:56.420
I fucking have that in a different color.

01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:56.980
Here it is.

01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:00.740
It's a little different because the cat has glasses.

01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:04.020
But like I that's why I laughed my ass off when I saw that shirt.

01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:05.700
I'm like, I fucking own that shirt.

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:08.500
So that's why I always wear it in Animal Crossing.

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:11.860
So it's funny.

01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:14.260
So all right, let's move on.

01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:17.460
And I'm going to talk a little bit about esports drama.

01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:19.780
This one involving Overwatch.

01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:25.300
So the Overwatch League, you know, it's still going moved over to YouTube.

01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:28.420
And that's why I kind of lost track of it because I was following it on Twitch.

01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:31.460
But it's on YouTube now and they're still going.

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:36.420
Obviously not right this second, but they had a season and they named an MVP.

01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:41.540
The MVP was I hope I'm pronouncing this right, but it's Sinatra.

01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:44.100
Like like Frank Sinatra, but with an extra A.

01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:45.460
So Sinatra.

01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:46.500
Hopefully I'm pronouncing that right.

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:46.980
Sorry, guys.

01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:49.220
You can tell how much I've been following Overwatch League lately.

01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:52.020
But I mean, this guy is so popular.

01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:56.660
Not only is he the MVP of the entire league, he was actually on late night with Jimmy Fallon,

01:15:56.660 --> 01:15:59.700
like talking about Overwatch League last October.

01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:02.660
You know, when people were still going on late night talk shows in person.

01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:04.580
So this guy's a pretty big deal.

01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:09.220
It was announced this week that he's going to be leaving the Overwatch League.

01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:14.420
And as if it couldn't get any worse, he's going to go.

01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:17.220
I mean, worse for, I guess, Blizzard or whatever, worse for the league.

01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:21.460
He's going to leave to go play Valorant instead.

01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:24.660
So maybe he's just getting bored with Overwatch.

01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:27.300
Well, he actually has commented a little bit on that.

01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:31.940
He basically said the game is just not for me anymore.

01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:36.820
I'm very happy with my life, but I just wasn't having fun with Overwatch anymore.

01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:38.660
So, Loki, that's it.

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:40.020
You're not having fun playing the game.

01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:40.740
Don't play it.

01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:42.260
He's talked about he is.

01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:45.860
But what was interesting is that specifically he calls out

01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:48.580
the 2-2-2 role locking format.

01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:49.300
You know what that is?

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:53.700
That's where they made it so that every match is 2 DPS, 2 heals, 2 tanks.

01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:58.180
He cites that as a problem and the hero bans.

01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:01.300
Yeah, I don't learn somebody to do that stuff.

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:04.980
I mean, it seems like you would have more creativity with your teams unless,

01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:09.220
I guess, they're trying to get it so that not everybody hogs like a certain type of

01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:10.020
class or something.

01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:10.660
I don't know.

01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:10.900
Yeah.

01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:13.300
But that should be an option where you can turn that on or off.

01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:16.980
Frodo Swagons in chat says Valorant is so boring to watch.

01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:17.780
My God.

01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:20.980
Quest Buster says Valorant isn't even out of closed beta yet.

01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:24.420
So, kind of some ping ponging opinions there.

01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:27.540
But I think we can give Riot the benefit of the doubt.

01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:29.620
The game isn't out of beta yet.

01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:34.500
But still, this is a huge development for a game that isn't out of beta.

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:37.460
I mean, talk about like throwing your weight behind something.

01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:44.500
Again, it's not just like this guy was not just like a mostly sidelined player on one

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:45.460
of the teams like this.

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:49.620
This guy was the fucking MVP and he's saying, yeah, I'm gonna go play this instead because

01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:52.420
the game I'm making money off of and getting notoriety for.

01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:53.380
It's just not fun anymore.

01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:59.220
Like, you have to wonder if Riot slipped a 20 in his pocket, a 20 million dollar bill

01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:01.220
or like what's going on there.

01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:03.220
It's kind of interesting.

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:04.420
I mean, but I'm willing to give.

01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:06.260
I haven't played Valorant myself.

01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:08.660
Maybe it is really fucking fun.

01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:09.140
I don't know.

01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:10.100
I haven't played it yet.

01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:13.780
But I imagine it's one of those things, like most video games, we're all going to have

01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:15.780
an opinion on it and some are going to love it and some aren't.

01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:18.580
And this guy is just one of the lovers.

01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:21.300
Yeah.

01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:25.540
Quest Buster says he's not the only pro thinking of moving over to Valorant either.

01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:30.340
Overwatch League lost some talent earlier this year, too, such as a few popular announcers.

01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:36.020
So, it sounds like the Overwatch League might just be kind of, I don't know.

01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:37.860
There's a part of me that says it's, oh boy.

01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:39.300
Oh, girl, it's drama.

01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:40.420
Oh, they're in trouble.

01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:41.940
But then I'm also like, you know what?

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:49.620
As esports is getting bigger, it's like we don't just have football anymore.

01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:53.060
It's like for years and years, we've only ever had football.

01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:54.660
Football is the only thing we see.

01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:55.780
Football is the only game we play.

01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:56.580
That's all we have.

01:18:56.580 --> 01:19:00.020
But now it's like all of a sudden, oh, they got baseball.

01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:04.260
Oh, and basketball and hockey like all these other.

01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:07.060
And I think this is what's going to continue to happen with Overwatch League.

01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:10.340
And so suddenly, you know, Michael Jordan might be like, you know what?

01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:13.860
Instead of playing basketball, I'm going to go try this for a little while.

01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:15.860
Golf or whatever.

01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:16.580
You know what I mean?

01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:18.740
Like, I'm going to go try to be a pro in something else.

01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:23.060
And I think, you know, obviously you're going to see that a lot more probably in esports

01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:23.540
than you will.

01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:28.340
Obviously, I'm giving a very like, you know, it's not that common that you hear the pro sports

01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:30.740
people going from one sport to another, but it does happen.

01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:34.820
But I think you're going to see it happen here more as there's just as esports game

01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:37.220
popularity and there are more sports to choose from.

01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:38.500
Quest Buster.

01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:39.860
Oh, go ahead.

01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:43.060
No, I said, yeah, you're probably going to see more of that stuff.

01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:46.980
I mean, it's like after a while, like you got to move on to like other things, I would

01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:47.380
think.

01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:53.140
And maybe maybe this person thinks that, you know, Overwatch has kind of lost its luster

01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:56.100
and now, you know, Valiant's where it's at.

01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:56.740
So I don't know.

01:19:58.820 --> 01:19:59.140
Yeah.

01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:02.900
So reading some comments from chat, Quest Buster says, one of the arguments I've seen

01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:06.500
is that the core Phantom will always love Overwatch, but the broader numbers just aren't

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:08.580
there to make it esports great.

01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:12.500
Could Overwatch be slow?

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:12.820
I don't know.

01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:15.700
I feel like it's too early to doom and gloom, that type of stuff.

01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:19.140
But a lot will depend on the strength of Overwatch 2, I suppose.

01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:20.500
Yes.

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:21.000
Yeah.

01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:22.280
All right.

01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:23.860
All right.

01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:30.020
Well, let's move on to our next story, which is did you want to do this?

01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:31.060
You want me to do this?

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:31.540
China?

01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:32.020
Yes.

01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:32.340
Yes.

01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:34.820
Talk about China banning games.

01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:35.320
Yep.

01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:39.060
So China has banned a video game called Coronavirus Attack.

01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:42.580
It was a game that came out on Steam about a week or so ago.

01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:49.780
The game Coronavirus Attack is about a virus that can turn people in the selfish zombies

01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:51.380
as spread throughout your country.

01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:57.300
And your purpose is to prevent the selfish zombie virus carries from escaping and infecting

01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:58.260
other peoples.

01:20:58.260 --> 01:21:02.420
And to do that, you have to basically kill these people before they leave the country.

01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:08.180
So of course, I felt that that game was kind of offensive.

01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:15.380
And since also it was talking a little bit about where you win badges, like say, liberate

01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:20.900
Hong Kong and whatnot, obviously they had to ban that from China.

01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:22.840
Hmm.

01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:29.700
Well, I mean, the whole like killing people before they that's kind of in poor taste as

01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:30.200
it is.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:36.500
You know, we've been talking a lot about how there's going to be games as art that come

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:43.700
out of this and not all art is, you know, some art provokes some art is offensive and

01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:44.500
it gets you thinking.

01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:49.940
And so this is just one of those examples, I think, is that it's art that is a little

01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:50.340
offensive.

01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:53.620
I don't know if it's necessarily like, you know, you're like shooting people or anything.

01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:57.860
You're actually playing a yellow coronavirus pathogen.

01:21:58.660 --> 01:21:59.460
I'm not really sure what.

01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:05.300
Obviously, this is one of these games that people have made that is just trying to stir

01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:06.180
outrage, I think.

01:22:07.220 --> 01:22:08.020
Well, they got it.

01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:09.560
Yeah.

01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:11.700
So I don't know.

01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:14.900
Neat, I guess.

01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:16.820
All right.

01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:20.020
Everyone will immediately forget about this game in a week or so.

01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:20.520
Probably.

01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:21.780
All right.

01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:26.500
Then let's move on to the next story, which is a little bit of a follow up to something

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:27.380
we've been talking about.

01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:27.880
Right.

01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:28.980
Right.

01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:34.100
So we were talking a little bit about these Valorant beta keys that they were doing these

01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:39.060
24 hour streams where if you watch them for a certain amount of time, you would get a

01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:40.980
drop for one of these beta keys.

01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:46.180
Well, Twitch announced that they are going to be stopping this practice.

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:51.220
They said, basically, we've heard your concerns about creators continuously streaming VODs

01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:54.820
while tagging the channels live to farm Valorant drops.

01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:58.500
This harms the integrity of the drops program.

01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:03.060
So we've updated our community guidelines to clarify that cheating any Twitch reward

01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:04.740
system is prohibited.

01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:08.340
No cheating, because cheating is against the rules.

01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:14.100
So now they're basically not going to allow them to run these 24 hour streams.

01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:17.620
They're going to prevent this type of thing.

01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:24.180
So they said cheating a Twitch reward system such as drops or channel point systems is

01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:24.820
not allowed.

01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:33.540
And I'm not sure what exactly they're going to be doing to kind of combat that aside from

01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:36.340
just trying to prevent these 24 hour streams.

01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:45.860
I don't know, but I mean, yeah, if you don't drop these keys on the streams in the first

01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:46.420
place.

01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:50.020
Yeah, I feel like a conversation is going to happen there as well.

01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:55.780
But yeah, I mean, I guess maybe I'm a little pleasantly surprised Twitch took action in

01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:56.420
that regard.

01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:57.940
I didn't really expect them to.

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:02.420
But now that they did, I'm kind of like, oh, okay, yeah, I guess that is the thing that

01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:04.260
should have happened and good on Twitch for doing it.

01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:04.500
Right?

01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:06.420
Like, you know, they saw that there was a problem there.

01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:07.780
People are exploiting it.

01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:10.420
And so they've kind of, you know, cut that off.

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:13.860
And maybe that will make some of the people that are, you know, maybe like Riot and so

01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:14.020
forth.

01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:15.700
Maybe they didn't expect that this would happen.

01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:19.140
You know, sometimes you can't foresee how internet people are going to take to certain

01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:19.640
things.

01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:27.540
So they, you know, did this and that'll be something for future key drop giveaway things

01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:28.900
to consider, you know?

01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:29.940
Yeah.

01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:34.420
And well, at least it's nice to see that they're doing something.

01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:36.100
So I don't know.

01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:36.600
Yep.

01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:37.720
All right.

01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:42.260
Well, moving on to talking about Oculus sales.

01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:47.540
So Oculus sales, they've actually been improving a little bit, which is notable to talk about

01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:51.780
because, you know, we wonder, like, you know, is VR going to take over?

01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:53.700
VR going to be the next big thing?

01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:55.700
PlayStation VR has been doing pretty well.

01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:59.060
And now we have, you know, improving numbers for Oculus.

01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:02.020
And there's several reasons why this is happening.

01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:05.300
It's not just like, oh, finally, you know, there's reasons for it.

01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:08.580
And one of the big ones, of course, is the Oculus Quest.

01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:11.060
The Oculus Quest just came out in last May.

01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:16.180
And this has been pointed out as the biggest contributor to Facebook's other because,

01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:17.620
remember, Facebook owns Oculus.

01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:22.260
So the other revenue category has been very bolstered by the Oculus Quest.

01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:29.380
In fact, the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, you may know, actually kind of said something

01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:34.580
akin to wish we could have made more of them faster because these things were selling so well.

01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:37.060
Oh, I actually have the quote from the investor call.

01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:38.580
I wish we could have made more of them.

01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:38.980
I'm sorry.

01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:41.700
I wish we could make more of them faster during this period.

01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:47.780
It's possible that the COVID corona situation accelerates some of the trends around virtual

01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:51.620
or augmented reality, but I'm not sure what will happen in the long term.

01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:55.780
And that's something important to consider as well is that you may have people that are

01:25:55.780 --> 01:26:03.860
looking to VR as not just necessarily a new thing to do while at home or a thing to keep us home.

01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:07.780
But think about how this is also something kind of I get you could probably do a whole

01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:09.940
other show on this and I know they're out there.

01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:19.620
Is that how could VR now in this pandemic world we're in kind of shine by how it can

01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:24.580
bring us together by being in these fake worlds?

01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:30.100
I guess I don't know how else to put it, but like or even like I can now travel these places

01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:33.620
that I would have liked to have gone in person, but maybe I can't right now.

01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:36.100
But VR can kind of take me there.

01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:40.100
Or I would think if you're Facebook, it's a pay-per-view, a pay-per-view,

01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:44.420
a kin event that I can attend in VR even though I can't be there in person.

01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:47.860
Well, they have like, was it the Google Earth VR stuff that you can go like,

01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:49.940
look at Street View stuff in VR, I think.

01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:54.820
Phoenix 7726 says, so ready player one?

01:26:55.700 --> 01:27:00.820
I'm not sure I'd go that far, but think especially because VR technology isn't quite that.

01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:03.300
But what about the fact that, you know what,

01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:06.900
sporting events and concerts we keep talking about,

01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:09.300
those are going to be the last things to come back, right?

01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:14.020
Like those are those are, you know, those don't come back until we have

01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:20.500
treatment is one thing or a cure or a vaccine.

01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:24.020
You know, we're getting some hopeful things on the treatment front.

01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:26.260
But we don't, you know, we got to let the scientists do their work.

01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:27.300
These things take time.

01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:31.220
So, you know, we can wish on a star all we want, but we don't have anything where, you know,

01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:37.140
the government has felt strong enough to say, yes, we can treat this now and it won't be as fatal.

01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:38.820
Go forth and go back to normal.

01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:42.580
You know, yes, now it is like the flu because we can treat it.

01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:44.100
They can't do that yet.

01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:48.340
So my point is, the concert industry, the live entertainers,

01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:54.660
it's going to be challenging to figure out how do they make money in these types of times.

01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:59.540
But what if they could do a concert in VR and sell tickets?

01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:04.980
And I've always kind of thought this was going to be why Facebook because

01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:07.060
remember when Facebook bought Oculus?

01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:10.020
Everybody was like, why the fuck is Facebook buying Oculus?

01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:12.580
Why didn't Microsoft buy a gaming company?

01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:14.100
VR is for gaming.

01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:16.900
And it's like, oh, wait, maybe not.

01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:19.540
Maybe it's not just for gaming, actually.

01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:21.460
They haven't really done much with it, though.

01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:22.500
So I don't know.

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:23.700
They haven't yet.

01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:31.700
But like, this is again, not that I advocate for this pandemic is a great time to be capitalist.

01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:36.660
But I think the reality is there's going to be a lot of people that do try to seize the

01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:41.460
opportunity, you know, and Facebook would honestly be stupid not to.

01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:45.700
And I've said this since the beginning when they bought Oculus.

01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:50.420
Look at the things that Facebook has been doing, like live streaming and 3D photos.

01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:55.540
They keep inching closer and closer to streaming VR events.

01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:58.020
That will fucking happen.

01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:01.300
It do you think Loki is streaming VR events?

01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:03.220
Is that going to happen at some point?

01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:04.900
Is the technology going to be there for that?

01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:06.660
Eventually, it will.

01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:09.060
He went away.

01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:10.420
So I'm going to answer for him.

01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:11.860
Oh, wait, I think it's because my Skype.

01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:13.140
Sorry, my Skype is blowing up.

01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:15.460
And so it causes I'm sorry, Loki, were you talking?

01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:16.740
I am still here.

01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:17.540
Do you hear me?

01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:18.260
Yeah, sorry.

01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:19.540
I have the Skype.

01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:21.780
God, Skype's going on.

01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:24.820
And so you were probably talking to listeners and I couldn't hear you.

01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:27.540
So the question I was asking was an answer for my benefit.

01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:28.040
Sorry.

01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:32.740
Will VR be streaming live events anytime soon?

01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:38.260
I don't know about soon, but it eventually depends on what we're looking at soon.

01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:39.860
I mean, maybe in the next 10 years.

01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:43.380
I kind of think it'll be a lot sooner than that.

01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:45.940
I think the technology exists to be able to do it.

01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:49.060
I just don't think it exists on a wide scale, but I think they're going to go that way.

01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:53.860
So anyway, my point is, is that I see Facebook streaming these types of events in VR

01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:56.260
that we're not able to attend in person right now.

01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:59.380
And I think there will be people that will be into it and buy into it.

01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:03.220
It's probably not going to make as much money as live tours do.

01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:07.300
But if Taylor Swift wants to do a concert on Facebook in VR,

01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:09.220
I bet there will be people that would pay money for that.

01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:10.500
Okay, thank you.

01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:12.580
Bobby says the Olympics streamed in VR.

01:30:12.580 --> 01:30:15.300
I was like, surely something has happened with this already.

01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:18.100
And I was like, I know you can download videos in VR.

01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:21.220
There's plenty of stuff on PlayStation VR, like videos.

01:30:21.220 --> 01:30:24.260
I remember there was an Utada Hikaru concert you could watch and things like that.

01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:26.180
But the streaming, I wasn't sure.

01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:28.260
Okay, so the streaming is there.

01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:33.060
So Bonds006 says Facebook can own that market.

01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:35.940
They have the sub, just offer it to the masses.

01:30:35.940 --> 01:30:37.540
$4.99 a VR show.

01:30:37.540 --> 01:30:38.100
Exactly.

01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:39.380
I think that's where this goes.

01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:44.420
SSG100Matt says the NBA has been working with showing live games in VR for a while.

01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:47.460
The biggest obstacle is that the customer base isn't there yet.

01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:50.020
Well, now it's starting to grow a little bit.

01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:53.060
And maybe this is going to be the time when it grows a little more.

01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:56.900
I do need to point out VRChat is popular Zoom, that's all.

01:30:57.860 --> 01:31:02.100
I do need to point out Half-Life Alex has also released in this time frame.

01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:04.340
And I think we'd be idiots to not call out.

01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:06.740
You know, that probably had somewhat of an impact.

01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:08.180
Maybe not a huge one.

01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:14.020
But I know at least one person that finally jumped ship into AR to play Half-Life Alex.

01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:15.060
I'm sorry, VR.

01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:18.820
I was going to say, yeah, there was an article I saw.

01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:20.260
ARAlexR, sorry.

01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:22.260
Regarding the VR stuff.

01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:30.260
And even with Alex coming out, it's only about 1.9% of Steam users actually own VR headsets.

01:31:32.020 --> 01:31:34.740
That's still higher than I would have thought, to be honest.

01:31:35.380 --> 01:31:36.500
So, all right.

01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:38.020
Well, anyway, we'll see what develops.

01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:42.020
But I think it's interesting to note that Oculus has been growing.

01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:43.300
So, I'm going to...

01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:45.300
I think if he's ready, I'm going to actually call over to the show.

01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:47.780
So, you guys know we've had to change a little bit on the fly tonight.

01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:50.260
Because DarkSakura had a family emergency and she had to go.

01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:56.100
So, if you've seen me frantically texting on the stream, I was actually texting Alan

01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:58.820
to see if he'd be willing to cover the classic game tonight.

01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:01.300
And thank gosh, he was.

01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:03.140
So, I'm just going to do a little microphone change here.

01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:03.780
So, I'm going to give...

01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:04.260
Hi, Alan.

01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:04.660
How are you?

01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:05.460
Here's the yellow mic.

01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:06.900
And I'm going to take the noisy mic.

01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:07.620
So, sorry, guys.

01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:08.660
It's going to make a little noise.

01:32:08.660 --> 01:32:09.540
But I have to.

01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:13.700
The Venmo payment hasn't come through yet for this.

01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:14.660
No, it hasn't.

01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:15.780
And hopefully this one works.

01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:16.020
Yes.

01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:16.340
Okay.

01:32:16.340 --> 01:32:17.620
So, hi, how are you?

01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:18.100
I'm very...

01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:19.460
My time is very expensive.

01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:23.380
Well, I appreciate you gracing us with your presence.

01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:25.300
Is this a Twitch appropriate thing you're wearing?

01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:25.860
Cover up.

01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:26.180
Jesus.

01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:27.060
All right.

01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:28.420
It's nice outside.

01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:29.860
It's hotter in here than it is outside.

01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:32.820
How's gaming been for you?

01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:34.180
We didn't talk about this on the show.

01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:36.100
You bought something this week.

01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:36.580
Oh, yes.

01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:39.060
I got a Switch Lite.

01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:43.860
It's on its way to Best Buy.

01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:48.260
I pick it up on Saturday because I got the coral color.

01:32:48.260 --> 01:32:48.980
I'm not pink.

01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:50.100
Coral.

01:32:52.260 --> 01:32:53.940
So yeah, that and Animal Crossing.

01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:57.460
And why did you finally jump ship on getting this?

01:32:57.460 --> 01:32:58.660
Because you wanted your own...

01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:00.900
I was like, you can build an Animal Crossing house on my island.

01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:01.140
No.

01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:04.660
Just the fact that you have...

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:07.540
I don't like playing in the living room.

01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:09.940
I don't like playing on a big TV.

01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:13.380
I like things that are intimate, where it's either in my lap or right in front of me at

01:33:13.380 --> 01:33:14.580
a computer desk.

01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:16.820
So yeah.

01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:18.020
And then I can...

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:23.140
If I was doing something and you wanted it, you're like, someone's coming over to give

01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:23.540
me something.

01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:23.940
Get off.

01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:29.780
It's just like if you have kids that fight too much, you just got to get them their own

01:33:29.780 --> 01:33:31.460
stuff, even if it spoils them.

01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:32.180
I understand.

01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:36.420
So well, and it's interesting is we were talking about this on prior shows is that the Switches

01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:39.620
have been kind of hard to come by, but I guess not because you got...

01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:42.180
Well, you weren't able to just buy one today.

01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:44.020
You had to wait a little bit, but you were able to get one.

01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:50.260
I saw over your shoulder, Alan got a Switch without having to deal with scalpers.

01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:57.060
Yes, because this past week, and you may be SOL, a lot of the major retailers got...

01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:03.060
I have no idea how big the shipment is or when the next one is going to be in relation

01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:03.460
to...

01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:07.140
Because Nintendo stopped production with all the COVID-19 stuff going on.

01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:15.060
But Costco, Best Buy, and Amazon got a pretty significant bunch of different colors of the

01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:15.540
lights.

01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:23.700
I don't know about the main Switch, but I originally placed my order on Amazon because

01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:29.380
they were sold out of Coral, saw that Best Buy had Coral, canceled the Amazon order,

01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:30.340
switched to Best Buy.

01:34:31.220 --> 01:34:36.100
And by the way, if you were to check, Best Buy, I think, is already sold out.

01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:37.300
There might be some on Amazon.

01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:40.580
If you see Amazon 199, that's Amazon.

01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:43.220
They're the only people selling it for MSRP.

01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:46.180
So yeah, I was able...

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:49.380
There were so many Switches in stock, I was able to cancel the order in one place and

01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:52.900
confidently place it with another retailer, which two weeks ago you couldn't do.

01:34:54.180 --> 01:34:59.220
So without getting too much of a tangent, I'm on this app called Slick Deals, which

01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:06.100
I use to track if there's something that I want, whether it's workout clothes or...

01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:08.420
I don't know.

01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:10.340
I'm into fitness stuff.

01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:12.180
So protein bar stuff that's expensive.

01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:15.220
But if I want to know if there's a really great deal on it, you can put stuff on there

01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:18.340
and your phone will alert you when it's in stock.

01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:20.340
Can you all tell Alan's been working out?

01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:21.860
I'm very skinny.

01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:22.580
Thank you.

01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:26.500
I haven't been working out, but Alan has.

01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:34.580
I put a Switch notification in Slick Deals and it basically popped up and said,

01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:40.660
this isn't technically a deal because it is MSRP, but Costco, Best Buy, Amazon have them

01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:42.740
this week for MSRP.

01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:44.980
And some people downloaded it because it's not a sale.

01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:48.900
Deal is a discount, but that was my way in.

01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:55.220
So today says, oh, Alan is one of those people that has an app and steals all the stuff people

01:35:55.220 --> 01:35:56.900
want before they see it's in stock.

01:35:56.900 --> 01:35:58.500
Okay, but to be fair, he's not scalping.

01:35:58.500 --> 01:35:59.940
He bought it for himself.

01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:00.340
Yes.

01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:06.900
And a lot of the people who vote down those tips when something is in stock that's hard

01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:09.220
to find are the resellers.

01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:13.460
So the fact that this thing on Slick Deals had like minus 50 downvoted, those are the

01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:18.660
scalpers downvoting it because they want to buy out Amazon at $1.99 and then flip it on

01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:19.460
eBay for $300.

01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:22.260
I just want one and I don't want to pay $400 for it.

01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:26.340
And Fifth Dream today says, I know.

01:36:26.340 --> 01:36:28.180
And by the way, SJ100 Matt can actually hear.

01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:33.300
So Smoosh is all the way in the hallway and they can hear that Smoosh is pissed because

01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:37.780
how dare we both be here and not by his side right now.

01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:38.660
I don't have mine.

01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:39.940
I don't have the squirt bottle.

01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:41.380
It's fine.

01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:41.880
Yeah.

01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:43.860
So anyway, I'm getting a Switch.

01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:45.140
I'm getting a Coral one.

01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:48.100
I've already got the SD card with a little micro thing.

01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:50.260
I have it set aside.

01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:58.820
So yeah, I'll be posting my Switch code probably on Twitter Saturday evening and then I'll

01:36:58.820 --> 01:37:02.900
probably hop on OLR on Sunday and read it there.

01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:07.300
All I'm going to have is Animal Crossing because Switch games are $60 a pop and I'm probably

01:37:07.300 --> 01:37:07.940
not going to go.

01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:09.940
Well, you have all my games that I have on.

01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:10.580
Well, true.

01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:14.660
And if I knew this was going to happen, I would have done what Bobby Blackwolf did and

01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:17.460
bought the physical one so we could like share the cartridge.

01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:18.980
But here we go.

01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:19.540
LOL.

01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:20.740
Bobby's sitting there laughing.

01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:22.020
Ha ha ha.

01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:23.540
I'm smarter than Rob is.

01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:25.540
This is pretty spontaneous.

01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:28.180
I never guessed that he would finally join the Switch bandwagon.

01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:28.660
This is like...

01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:33.540
And I didn't think Animal Crossing would be the game to break you either, so to speak.

01:37:33.540 --> 01:37:35.620
I think it's the circumstances that we're in.

01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:37.780
We live in strange times.

01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:39.300
We do live in strange times.

01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:42.580
But why couldn't we like...

01:37:42.580 --> 01:37:43.620
What do you mean swap games?

01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:44.020
How?

01:37:44.020 --> 01:37:46.740
Like the light isn't digital only.

01:37:47.860 --> 01:37:50.100
No, no, it's not digital only.

01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:50.260
Yeah.

01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:52.180
Then all these cartridges I have in the other room.

01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:53.140
Yeah, so we can still do that.

01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:54.340
Yeah, you can take any of those games.

01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:54.740
Yeah.

01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:59.060
But like Animal Crossing or Mario Maker 2 or the things I bought digitally, I don't

01:37:59.060 --> 01:37:59.780
have those.

01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:00.740
But there's plenty.

01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:02.180
You want to play Diablo 3 or something like that?

01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:02.900
Yeah, well, okay.

01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:04.340
I get your point there.

01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:05.700
But like, yeah, I mean, if I want...

01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:07.220
The only other game that I want...

01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:13.220
Bobby says, to be fair, my wife bought Animal Crossing digitally because she was playing

01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:16.020
it too much, I'd only get about 30 minutes a day.

01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:17.300
Yeah.

01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:18.260
Okay, there it is.

01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:18.500
Yeah.

01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:20.660
So Bobby is actually not laughing.

01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:22.100
He's nodding in agreement.

01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:22.420
Yes.

01:38:22.420 --> 01:38:23.060
I understand.

01:38:23.780 --> 01:38:28.420
I'm gonna take over your Breath of the Wild because I played that for like a dozen hours

01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:29.540
and I hope...

01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:30.260
Longer than that.

01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:32.020
But I haven't played it in a while.

01:38:32.020 --> 01:38:32.520
Yeah.

01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:38.180
The only other one where I'd want to get, regardless of whether or not you have a copy

01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:39.700
of it, would probably be Mario Kart.

01:38:39.700 --> 01:38:40.200
I have it.

01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:45.060
But like if we wanted to play together, like on our respective switches.

01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:45.940
Then that's a little harder.

01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:46.180
Yeah.

01:38:46.180 --> 01:38:46.680
Yeah.

01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:48.020
Smash Brothers.

01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:53.860
I love Smash Brothers for GameCube, but because I'm on the light and I don't like the controller

01:38:53.860 --> 01:38:56.740
thing, whatever, I'm not worried about Smash Brothers.

01:38:57.700 --> 01:38:58.200
All right.

01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:00.740
What else am I wanting to ask you about?

01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:04.100
First off, a lot of the folks on Twitch...

01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:05.540
Sorry to the podcast who can't see.

01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:08.900
And also, if Matt or Loki is saying anything, I can't hear him.

01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:09.940
So hi, Matt.

01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:10.900
No, he's quiet right now.

01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:12.100
I'm not being quiet.

01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:12.420
All right.

01:39:12.420 --> 01:39:15.060
Yeah, Loki's being quiet, but he says hi back.

01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:17.160
All right.

01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:21.700
Now, a lot of the Twitch people are commenting on...

01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:23.940
They're saying, where did Alan get his haircut?

01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:25.860
Or how did Alan get a haircut?

01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:28.580
And just to be clear, Alan did not go out.

01:39:28.580 --> 01:39:30.420
Alan's been very good at the shelter in place.

01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:31.380
He just shaved his head.

01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:35.220
It's the quarantine desperation.

01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:36.900
I can't take this anymore.

01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:38.440
Target.

01:39:39.380 --> 01:39:40.340
DIY.

01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:41.060
You just...

01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:41.540
That's right.

01:39:41.540 --> 01:39:43.140
Loki's saying it verbally.

01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:44.740
You just do this with the guard.

01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:47.620
And the guard keeps you from making any severe mistakes.

01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:51.620
And then you get your spouse or roommate or significant other.

01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:53.380
And you say, get the back.

01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:54.420
I can't get the back.

01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:55.540
It's fucked up in the back.

01:39:56.260 --> 01:39:58.180
And then Rob comes out and he's like, fine.

01:39:58.180 --> 01:39:59.540
And then he goes, nah.

01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:00.040
So yeah.

01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:04.820
But see, you're lucky, though, that you still have everything in the middle.

01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:08.340
So the problem for me is that I don't have all this in the middle.

01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:09.700
You're going to have to cave at some point.

01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:12.580
Or you're going to have the full fur rim, like Friar Tuck.

01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:14.420
See, I don't want that.

01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:17.540
So I'm just like, luckily, I really love hats.

01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:18.100
Yeah.

01:40:18.100 --> 01:40:19.300
Or I just have to go down.

01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:22.100
Like I have to do like the extra thing and just go like completely.

01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:23.860
But I'm like, my head is shaped funny.

01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:24.660
I don't like it.

01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:27.780
But like, you know, like the back, the back is starting to grow out.

01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:28.660
It's like, oh, God.

01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:29.780
Yeah.

01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:30.500
So I don't know.

01:40:31.220 --> 01:40:33.300
When you finally crack, just let me know.

01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:36.420
And we'll go outside in the lawn so the hair can go wherever.

01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:40.260
And I will happily, the hair that you have, I will happily buzz.

01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:42.740
But yeah, no, it's just it's quarantine desperation.

01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:43.700
It is.

01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:44.200
It is.

01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:44.980
All right.

01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:47.700
So the reason why you're here, of course, Dark Soccer,

01:40:47.700 --> 01:40:50.820
I had to step away for a family emergency, which which fucking sucks.

01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:54.660
But I really appreciate you, you know, because I'm like, OK, how do we do this?

01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:57.300
I could just have Loki pick something on the fly or I could be something on the fly.

01:40:57.300 --> 01:40:59.060
Oh, Alan's got about 15 minutes.

01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:00.180
Maybe he can pick something.

01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:02.660
So I said, could you pick a classic game of the week?

01:41:02.660 --> 01:41:06.820
So because we've done this on the fly, we had to switch out what we were going to do.

01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:09.140
Jamie was going to do a pinball table tonight.

01:41:09.140 --> 01:41:11.220
I'm sure you all can understand she's not going to do that.

01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:13.220
We're going to roll that over to a later week,

01:41:13.220 --> 01:41:16.660
whether that be next week, two weeks from now, whenever she she comes back.

01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:20.260
But I said, Alan, hey, could you pick something on the fly?

01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:21.060
So he did.

01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:22.740
I don't have footage of it tonight.

01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:24.340
I'm sure you all understand why.

01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:25.860
So we're just going to do this on the fly.

01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:27.940
But Alan is going to pick the classic game tonight.

01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:29.620
So, Alan, what do you want to talk about?

01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:31.060
What game do you want to pick tonight?

01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:35.380
I want to talk about let me get my and I have played this game multiple times and beat it

01:41:35.380 --> 01:41:36.980
multiple times, but it was a long time ago.

01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:38.580
So I need to get my sure.

01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:39.060
Go for it.

01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:40.900
My nodes, a.k.a. Wikipedia.

01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:44.900
Meanwhile, I'll read comments from chat.

01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:48.900
Miss DOLR says, Alan, why do you think one of the first things I'm doing when the salons

01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:50.820
actually reopen is getting my hair cut?

01:41:50.820 --> 01:41:51.780
With precautions.

01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:57.060
But I don't even have the other house person help me make my back even option now.

01:41:57.060 --> 01:41:58.580
Yeah, but let me tell you what.

01:41:58.580 --> 01:42:04.420
Those haircut places are going to be swamped when it's safe to do so.

01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:06.180
So just make an appointment.

01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:10.420
I'm not too proud to admit this, but for about two years now, I have been getting my

01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:17.380
when you're a man of a certain age, like in your late 30s, early 40s, the hair on your

01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:21.060
nose, in your nose, your ears and your eyebrows, we're just going to do whatever the fuck we

01:42:21.060 --> 01:42:21.460
want.

01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:22.420
You can figure it out.

01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:24.500
So I would get wax.

01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:27.140
I would get my eyebrows and ears and nose waxed.

01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:30.340
And you can't tell right now, but there's a lot of chaos here.

01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:34.580
This the fact that I have two eyebrows, that's my doing with the razor blade.

01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:37.220
So I miss the wax salon.

01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:37.860
I want to get...

01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:39.860
You want your Brazilian?

01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:42.980
Yes, my face Brazilian, whatever.

01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:45.140
Just yoink.

01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:45.860
Absolutely.

01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:54.420
And this is like, I got like some Abe Vigoda type, you know, the guy with the eyebrows

01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:55.460
that's going on in my ears.

01:42:55.460 --> 01:42:56.020
It's not cute.

01:42:56.020 --> 01:42:56.580
Oh my God, you died.

01:42:56.580 --> 01:42:57.220
Have some class.

01:42:57.220 --> 01:42:57.720
Oh God.

01:42:58.740 --> 01:42:59.460
I'm just kidding.

01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:03.060
Once you turn 35, it truly is downhill.

01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:04.820
That's not true.

01:43:04.820 --> 01:43:07.380
I've loved my 30s and my 40s are okay.

01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:12.180
I mean, this COVID shit ain't helping, but until that happened, it was all right.

01:43:12.180 --> 01:43:12.660
All right.

01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:13.860
Classic game of the week.

01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:14.420
What is it?

01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:20.020
Okay, so this game, I want to see if the chat room can guess.

01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:21.940
It's for the PS2.

01:43:22.900 --> 01:43:31.940
It came out in America in October of 2001.

01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:35.540
Came out in August in Japan, same year, 2001, PS2 title.

01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:44.580
It was directed by Hideki Kamiya, who was the director of Resident Evil 2.

01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:53.780
And it was a genre breaking, genre inventing edgelord, beat him up, mega gothic extravaganza.

01:43:53.780 --> 01:43:55.060
And that is Devil May Cry.

01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:58.100
Props to Orange Riot hit it first.

01:43:58.900 --> 01:44:06.180
Devil May Cry, cause I got a PS2 on launch, which I think came out March of 2000.

01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:11.540
So by the time Devil May Cry came out, PS2 was out for about 15 months.

01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:17.380
And for me personally, DMC, which not referring to the DMC remake that came out like six years

01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:27.140
ago that everyone hated, but as an abbreviation, the first Devil May Cry for me was PS2's killer app.

01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:30.900
Like this is why I have this console.

01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:32.340
This is new, this is fun.

01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:34.100
I've never seen anything like this before.

01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:35.540
Shit's wild.

01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:38.820
I want to bring friends over to show them this.

01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:44.660
That was that game for me, because I had like tech and tag tournament and SSX snowboarding

01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:46.580
and some of the other launch titles.

01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:48.100
A few things had trickled in.

01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:52.900
PS2, of course, the 3D compared to the original PlayStation was quite incredible, but Devil

01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:59.060
May Cry was it for me, where I was like, I've now justified the price of the, I don't

01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:00.740
know, $400 that thing cost.

01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:07.380
It is a 3D action hack and slash.

01:45:08.580 --> 01:45:10.260
It counted up your combos.

01:45:10.260 --> 01:45:14.820
There were very ridiculous moves where you're flipping, you're juggling enemies in the air.

01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:17.620
You're flipping weapons in the middle of combos.

01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:18.660
You're shooting lasers.

01:45:18.660 --> 01:45:19.940
You have a demon form.

01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:29.860
It is very self-aware, edgelord, hot topic, like, my name's Dementia Raven, Gerald Darkway,

01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:32.420
Black Parade way, like, goth.

01:45:32.420 --> 01:45:40.100
And in the intro, Dante is at his private detective's office, and a blonde chick drives

01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:46.340
a motorcycle through his door and lands the motorcycle on him, and it's very cuckoo bananas.

01:45:47.220 --> 01:45:50.180
Devil May Cry is the precursor to Bayonetta.

01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:54.820
If you've played Bayonetta, then you know what Devil May Cry is like, because that's

01:45:54.820 --> 01:45:59.860
sort of the, Dante is Bayonetta's father, in no sense.

01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:00.740
Not daddy, though.

01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:01.940
That's between the two of them.

01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:02.500
I don't know what they do.

01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:03.220
That's their business.

01:46:05.060 --> 01:46:09.700
Hideki Kamiya, like I said, he was the director of Resident Evil 2.

01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:14.180
He then went on to Platinum Games, where he also did, of course, Bayonetta and Bayonetta

01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:14.740
2.

01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:16.660
Wonderful 101, I think, was his.

01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:20.660
He wrote the story for Viewtiful Joe 1 and 2.

01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:23.060
He blocked me on Twitter.

01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:24.740
What did you say to him?

01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:26.420
No, but he's blocked a lot of people.

01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:26.900
Okay, yeah.

01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:34.340
Yeah, I think he is a preemptive, he's a good internet troll, but he's an internet troll

01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:39.620
that kind of has not the thickest skin, so he is good at riling up his fans and irritating

01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:42.660
the shit out of them, but then if you kind of say something snotty back, I think he will

01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:44.340
block you, which isn't the best mix.

01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:58.580
So, the style with the tight, challenging gameplay was what made Devil May Cry such

01:46:58.580 --> 01:46:59.220
a success.

01:47:00.100 --> 01:47:06.580
It had a very, it was easy to learn, impossible, quote unquote, to master.

01:47:06.580 --> 01:47:10.100
It had a very sharp learning curve if you wanted to, or a very steep learning curve

01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:15.060
if you wanted to get an S or SS class on all the missions, all the levels, you had

01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:16.180
to play them over and over again.

01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:21.940
There was easy, normal, hard, nightmare mode, are you stupid mode, all that stuff.

01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:27.780
If you were a masochist before Dark Souls, you beat Devil May Cry and you put on Nightmare

01:47:27.780 --> 01:47:29.300
and then you had yourself a great old time.

01:47:30.100 --> 01:47:31.380
Definitely was replayable.

01:47:32.020 --> 01:47:36.420
Once you got good at it in normal mode, you could probably play it again from start to

01:47:36.420 --> 01:47:38.980
finish and realize, oh, you shaved two hours off your time.

01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:45.300
So, yeah, action, arcade, very violent, demons and monsters.

01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:49.860
I had very little time to put this together, but you get the idea.

01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:50.820
You're doing great, sweetie.

01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:55.620
Go on YouTube, look up Devil May Cry 2001 if you've never played it.

01:47:57.300 --> 01:48:00.500
Also, really good soundtrack, don't really know who did the music, though.

01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:05.380
But you can get it now pretty much anything relevant current day.

01:48:05.380 --> 01:48:09.460
You can get it on PS4 or Xbox One as a digital download.

01:48:09.460 --> 01:48:11.380
It's on the Switch because everything's on the Switch now.

01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:12.660
Came out June 2019.

01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:14.340
You can get it on PC.

01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:20.420
Devil May Cry had a sequel, Devil May Cry 2.

01:48:20.420 --> 01:48:25.860
They did not ask Hideki Kamiya if he wanted to be a part of it.

01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:28.260
They just greenlit it and put people on it that weren't him.

01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:31.540
And he still, at the time when they interviewed him about it, he's like, I don't know why

01:48:31.540 --> 01:48:32.580
they made the sequel without me.

01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:34.660
Capcom just did their own thing.

01:48:34.660 --> 01:48:39.140
Devil May Cry 2 is considered the worst of the series.

01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:44.020
DMC3, which is about him, Dante, and his brother, Virgil.

01:48:44.020 --> 01:48:49.860
The game is very, very loosely based off of Milton's Paradise Lost.

01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:54.580
I think there was that one Edgelord game for the PS3 that came out that was also based

01:48:54.580 --> 01:48:54.900
on that.

01:48:54.900 --> 01:48:57.620
So yeah, Trish, Virgil, Dante.

01:48:58.260 --> 01:49:04.660
DMC3 was a prequel, which was very successful and very fun to play.

01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:11.540
Then there was DMC4 and DMC5 after the series was put on hiatus because I'm not sure what

01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:13.540
year it was, 2012, 2013.

01:49:13.540 --> 01:49:18.580
They sort of remade Dante as this very Twinkie type.

01:49:18.580 --> 01:49:23.540
It was too Hot Topic, Edgelord, Grim Dark, Raven, Dementia Way.

01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:24.660
It was too much.

01:49:25.460 --> 01:49:30.740
You know, Kamiya knew how to keep it at like a 7 and they went a full 10 and it did not

01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:30.980
work.

01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:38.180
So because that game kind of flopped, they were like, oh, Capcom didn't really know what

01:49:38.180 --> 01:49:39.300
they wanted to do with it.

01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:44.500
Finally, they greenlit and made Devil May Cry 5, which came out last year.

01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:47.940
And my understanding is that was successful and that was a lot of fun to play.

01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:48.420
I have it.

01:49:48.420 --> 01:49:50.580
I haven't played past the tutorial stage.

01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:51.140
And why not?

01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:54.980
Girl, how many games do we have on Steam that we haven't played?

01:49:56.100 --> 01:49:57.700
Are you going to ask me that question?

01:49:57.700 --> 01:49:58.820
Drag me, expose me.

01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:07.380
So yeah, you can get DMC1, 2, and 3 on Steam.

01:50:07.380 --> 01:50:08.260
It's a trilogy.

01:50:09.140 --> 01:50:14.420
For some reason, DMC3 standalone 4 and 5 are on sale right now on Steam, but the original

01:50:14.420 --> 01:50:16.660
1, 2, and 3 trilogy is like a package.

01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:17.540
It's full retail.

01:50:17.540 --> 01:50:18.900
I think it's 39 or 49.

01:50:18.980 --> 01:50:22.580
Maybe put that on your Steam wish list and wait for one of the bigger sales to come up.

01:50:22.580 --> 01:50:25.940
But if you want to play it, you have half a dozen ways to do so, is what I'm trying

01:50:25.940 --> 01:50:26.740
to say.

01:50:26.740 --> 01:50:29.460
So yeah, that's the classic game of the week.

01:50:30.340 --> 01:50:34.260
Came out in 2001, which is 19 years ago.

01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:37.700
Thank you for the reminder that we're all getting older.

01:50:37.700 --> 01:50:38.660
Appreciate that.

01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:39.380
Disgusting.

01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:40.500
All right.

01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:41.220
All right.

01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:42.340
Well, Alan, you did great.

01:50:42.900 --> 01:50:45.620
You guys have to know again, I gave him like 10 minutes notice.

01:50:45.620 --> 01:50:47.220
Hi, can you jump in and do this segment?

01:50:47.220 --> 01:50:47.860
And he did it.

01:50:48.500 --> 01:50:51.780
I checked the Wiki and I was like, all right, there's got to be, because there's always

01:50:51.780 --> 01:50:54.260
the game that's like, how have we not done this before?

01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:55.300
Devil May Cry was it?

01:50:55.860 --> 01:50:56.420
All right.

01:50:56.420 --> 01:50:56.820
Yeah.

01:50:56.820 --> 01:50:58.260
That's why I put a ring on it.

01:50:58.260 --> 01:50:58.820
Yep.

01:50:58.820 --> 01:50:59.140
All right.

01:50:59.140 --> 01:50:59.780
Thanks, Alan.

01:51:00.340 --> 01:51:00.740
Bye.

01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:00.980
All right.

01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:01.380
Take care.

01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:02.740
All right.

01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:05.940
And I'm going to switch back to my less noisy mic, you guys.

01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:10.340
Thank you for dealing with some of our life changes.

01:51:10.340 --> 01:51:16.820
Again, Dark Sakura had to step away early due to an emergency and hoping everything's

01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:19.140
okay in our soccer Ville.

01:51:19.140 --> 01:51:19.780
Okay.

01:51:19.780 --> 01:51:23.300
Moving on, though, we still have some news to cover and some things to get to before

01:51:23.300 --> 01:51:25.140
we wrap up tonight's show.

01:51:25.140 --> 01:51:26.900
So we got some rapid fire news.

01:51:26.900 --> 01:51:28.180
We're going to try to get into here.

01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:29.460
So, Loki, do you want to start?

01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:30.340
Yeah.

01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:35.460
Let's talk about what's coming out for free games with your online subscriptions for Xbox

01:51:35.460 --> 01:51:37.860
slide game with golden PlayStation network.

01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:41.780
So starting with games of gold, you have the rally four, which is going to be made first

01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:47.780
through the three verse and then Warhammer 40,000 Inquisitor Martyr that's going to be

01:51:47.780 --> 01:51:51.060
coming out May 16th through June 15th.

01:51:51.060 --> 01:51:56.420
And then the Xbox 360 compatible games Sensible World of Soccer for the first half of May

01:51:56.420 --> 01:51:58.420
and Overlord two for the second half of May.

01:51:58.980 --> 01:52:01.620
That is a game I have not played in a long time.

01:52:01.620 --> 01:52:02.260
Overlord.

01:52:04.900 --> 01:52:09.700
Then let's see, although it's weird, though, because in their screenshot, they show Overlord,

01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:11.300
not Overlord two.

01:52:11.300 --> 01:52:14.340
So I wonder if that's not accurate or not.

01:52:14.340 --> 01:52:15.060
Let's see here.

01:52:16.260 --> 01:52:23.700
But anyways, we've got for the PlayStation side of the house, the city skylines and farming

01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:26.900
simulator 19 are going to be the two games you get.

01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:28.420
Those are some choices.

01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:29.460
Well, city skylines.

01:52:29.460 --> 01:52:34.020
I mean, I keep forgetting like that's a console game, you know, like that to me, like that

01:52:34.020 --> 01:52:35.860
is like a SimCity type of successor.

01:52:35.860 --> 01:52:40.660
Like that's the game that showed up when the SimCity reboot like stunk.

01:52:40.660 --> 01:52:43.780
So I keep associating that as PC.

01:52:43.780 --> 01:52:48.020
I never think of that as a PS4 game, but I guess, you know, maybe this release is going

01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:49.620
to change some of those notions.

01:52:49.620 --> 01:52:50.580
Farming Simulator.

01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:53.620
I'm not trying to dog on that game, but I feel like that's shown up as the free game

01:52:53.620 --> 01:52:54.820
multiple places right now.

01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:58.660
So it's kind of like because that was that was a Stadia Pro game not that long ago.

01:52:58.660 --> 01:52:59.940
So I mean, yeah.

01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:04.180
And it's you know, I don't know a lot of people that are going to get that excited about farming

01:53:04.180 --> 01:53:06.340
simulator, but it's different.

01:53:07.300 --> 01:53:12.020
It could be a fun game to stream if you haven't, you know, you don't know what you're doing.

01:53:12.020 --> 01:53:12.580
It's true.

01:53:12.580 --> 01:53:13.060
I don't know.

01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:13.620
It's true.

01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:14.260
Hey, you know what?

01:53:14.260 --> 01:53:18.100
Those like those truck driving simulator things with the Eurotruck simulator, whatever.

01:53:18.100 --> 01:53:19.220
Those games are fucking fun.

01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:21.460
So you know what?

01:53:22.900 --> 01:53:24.100
Anyway, I shouldn't talk shit.

01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:25.140
Yeah, do some farming.

01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:27.780
If you're ready to do some farming.

01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:28.280
Sure.

01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:29.400
All right.

01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:31.460
And this is kind of cool.

01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:35.220
So we have always been talking about a lot of different things you can make with Dreams

01:53:35.220 --> 01:53:36.420
and all these cool creations.

01:53:36.420 --> 01:53:41.140
So somebody took the whole concept of Lego Super Mario.

01:53:41.140 --> 01:53:44.820
You know, the actual sets are coming out here within a matter of months.

01:53:45.860 --> 01:53:52.180
They took that and they've made a Lego Super Mario game in Dreams using the character model

01:53:52.180 --> 01:53:54.020
and everything completely from scratch.

01:53:54.740 --> 01:53:59.140
Pretty amazing, though, the little gameplay that they did it and it was 60 plus hours

01:53:59.140 --> 01:54:01.540
so far being put into the game to make that.

01:54:01.620 --> 01:54:06.340
And they even had like a behind the scenes video showing how they modeled everything

01:54:06.340 --> 01:54:08.100
and just an amazing job.

01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:09.300
No copyright takedown yet?

01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:14.100
Not yet, because wasn't that a thing just like two weeks ago we had like Mario games

01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:15.300
getting taken down in Dreams?

01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:17.220
Like, how does this not happen here?

01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:19.220
Mario and Lego this time.

01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:22.020
Oh, but you're fringing on two IPs.

01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:22.660
Great job.

01:54:23.540 --> 01:54:24.580
Multiple IPs.

01:54:24.580 --> 01:54:26.260
Multiple, why not?

01:54:26.260 --> 01:54:27.700
You're going to fridge on IPs.

01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:28.660
Let's do multiples.

01:54:29.620 --> 01:54:34.500
Um, but yeah, that's like, that's like when what's his name posts the video with all the

01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:37.220
copyright stuff so that they all infringe on each other.

01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:39.780
They all file infringement stuffs on each other.

01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:42.340
You know what I'm talking about?

01:54:42.340 --> 01:54:44.020
Yeah, copyright deadlock or whatever it is.

01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:45.400
Yeah.

01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:46.580
All right.

01:54:46.580 --> 01:54:51.300
So if you want to check it out, just look for Lego Super Mario, the video game.

01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:55.460
And it's by the game designer, barely regal.

01:54:55.700 --> 01:55:02.580
So which classy, which by the way, um, there is a free demo of Dreams.

01:55:02.580 --> 01:55:03.140
It just came out.

01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:06.420
I was reading about, I haven't grabbed it myself yet, but I don't know if it's something

01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:10.340
where you can like, just play the creations or if it's timed or what the restrictions

01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:11.620
on the demo are.

01:55:11.620 --> 01:55:15.220
But, um, if you're curious about this game, which Dreams is one of those things where

01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:17.300
I'm always like, Oh yeah, I need to get on that.

01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:18.340
I need to get on that.

01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:18.740
You know what?

01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:19.860
I really need to get on that.

01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:22.500
And then it's like, you know, but animal crossing.

01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:26.980
And so I never like get to it, but maybe a demo would be a nice little shove in the

01:55:26.980 --> 01:55:27.700
right direction.

01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:28.020
Right.

01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:29.220
So you have a chance.

01:55:29.220 --> 01:55:30.260
So, all right.

01:55:31.220 --> 01:55:36.500
Moving on, let's talk about some changes coming up to Final Fantasy 14 and its next

01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:37.220
patch.

01:55:37.220 --> 01:55:41.060
You may not be aware, but some of the things that people don't like about Final Fantasy

01:55:41.060 --> 01:55:46.660
14 is that the story from the original expansion, a realm reborn, the first 50 levels of the

01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:47.700
game you have to play.

01:55:47.700 --> 01:55:50.500
Some people feel it is too fucking long.

01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:54.500
And, um, yeah, yeah, it's, it's, it's a little long.

01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:56.660
So this is an interesting thing they're doing in the patch.

01:55:56.660 --> 01:56:02.020
They are cutting out some of the con you never, you never think about celebrating the removal

01:56:02.020 --> 01:56:06.580
of content as good news, but in the case of Final Fantasy 14, people are relatively happy

01:56:06.580 --> 01:56:10.900
that, uh, they're going to be scaling back the content in a realm reborn.

01:56:10.900 --> 01:56:12.580
I believe they're saying about 13%.

01:56:13.380 --> 01:56:18.340
So some of the, uh, stuff you have to get through to get to the expansions, it's going

01:56:18.340 --> 01:56:20.180
to be rebalanced, changed.

01:56:20.180 --> 01:56:25.620
Uh, you won't have to worry about consistently hitting this block where you can't progress

01:56:25.620 --> 01:56:27.380
with the story because they're going to balance it.

01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:30.900
So the story gives you enough experience to just keep going through the story.

01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:32.180
So that's pretty cool.

01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:37.060
And they're adding new stuff as well, including the next section of the Nier Automata inspired

01:56:37.060 --> 01:56:38.980
raid called the Puppets Bunker.

01:56:39.540 --> 01:56:44.740
And I'm looking forward to playing that because I, I was very late to the party on Nier and

01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:45.540
it's really cool.

01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:47.700
And I like the look and especially the music.

01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:48.900
I love the music in that game.

01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:52.900
So, uh, very looking forward to what the music is going to be like in that, uh, particular

01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:53.140
raid.

01:56:53.140 --> 01:56:54.260
That'll be really cool.

01:56:54.260 --> 01:56:58.660
And they're also going to continue the storyline around the Ruby weapon, uh, which was something

01:56:58.660 --> 01:57:00.100
you fought already.

01:57:00.100 --> 01:57:03.780
And they're going to be increasing the difficulty of, uh, past raids.

01:57:03.780 --> 01:57:08.100
So some of the old level 50 raids will be coming back, uh, and getting a lot harder.

01:57:08.980 --> 01:57:13.300
Uh, Ziba is asking over in our chat room, Rob, what server do you play on?

01:57:13.300 --> 01:57:14.260
Cactuar.

01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:15.540
I've been bouncing around.

01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:17.220
I started on Midgar Summer.

01:57:17.300 --> 01:57:20.100
I was on, um, Hyperion during the last expansion.

01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:21.620
Now I'm on Cactuar.

01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:25.060
And, um, I finally changed my character.

01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:26.740
I'm no longer Lil Poundcake.

01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:28.180
That was my old character.

01:57:28.180 --> 01:57:29.300
I've changed.

01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:31.300
I should, should I say my new character?

01:57:31.940 --> 01:57:34.100
Am I going to get trolled if I give away my new character?

01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:35.380
Do you want to know my new character name?

01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:36.740
Loki, do you want to know my new character?

01:57:36.740 --> 01:57:37.300
You might like it.

01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:38.420
Sure.

01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:39.060
What is it?

01:57:39.060 --> 01:57:41.860
My new character's name is Jeremy Bearimy.

01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:45.780
So there you go.

01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:46.100
All right.

01:57:46.980 --> 01:57:51.620
Uh, moving on, uh, also talking about Apex Legends.

01:57:52.820 --> 01:57:57.540
Apex Legends is introducing a new hero, a thief named Loba.

01:57:57.540 --> 01:58:01.380
And if you've been following the game, you may have seen Loba before.

01:58:01.380 --> 01:58:05.780
She has a connection to Revenant, uh, that joined the game in season four.

01:58:06.820 --> 01:58:10.420
In this new update for Apex Legends, there's going to be a new,

01:58:10.420 --> 01:58:14.100
a hundred new items for people to unlock, including legendary skins,

01:58:14.100 --> 01:58:18.260
Apex packs, uh, a new quest mechanic apparently is going to be in the game.

01:58:18.260 --> 01:58:19.060
That's pretty cool.

01:58:19.060 --> 01:58:21.140
I haven't checked out Apex since it first launched.

01:58:21.140 --> 01:58:23.220
I didn't read, really need to get back into it.

01:58:23.220 --> 01:58:26.100
Um, because I think there there's like duos mode in that now.

01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:27.620
And they've added some other fun stuff to that.

01:58:27.620 --> 01:58:28.660
So, okay.

01:58:28.660 --> 01:58:30.420
Hey, anybody out there play Apex?

01:58:30.420 --> 01:58:33.220
Like, do they, did they ever put in like a solo type mode?

01:58:33.860 --> 01:58:37.060
Like where, or something where you can play against AI to get better

01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:40.100
at the game before you just go back to the game?

01:58:40.100 --> 01:58:40.260
Yeah.

01:58:40.260 --> 01:58:42.580
When they had the Titanfall into the game.

01:58:42.580 --> 01:58:42.740
Yeah.

01:58:42.740 --> 01:58:43.540
I'd be looking for that too.

01:58:43.540 --> 01:58:44.260
That'd be pretty cool.

01:58:44.900 --> 01:58:45.540
All right.

01:58:45.540 --> 01:58:49.940
Um, let me try to tackle the headlines Jamie had, and then you can fill in any gaps.

01:58:49.940 --> 01:58:50.180
Okay.

01:58:50.180 --> 01:58:50.900
Loki.

01:58:50.900 --> 01:58:54.980
Um, so number one, uh, Evo 2020 got canceled.

01:58:54.980 --> 01:58:57.460
Uh, so they're not going to be doing Evo 2020.

01:58:57.460 --> 01:58:58.900
Does that really surprise anyone?

01:58:58.900 --> 01:58:59.460
Not really.

01:58:59.460 --> 01:59:01.540
Sadly, uh, everything is getting canceled.

01:59:01.540 --> 01:59:04.340
Um, but they're going to be doing an online event in its place.

01:59:04.340 --> 01:59:07.140
Um, I know, uh, this was brought up on Bobby's show.

01:59:07.140 --> 01:59:11.380
He had a caller tonight that was talking on his show a little bit about it and how it's

01:59:11.380 --> 01:59:16.260
going to be interesting to see how it plays out because like disconnects happen and the

01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:19.140
internet isn't always the greatest on some of these games.

01:59:19.140 --> 01:59:20.740
There's lag and yeah.

01:59:20.740 --> 01:59:25.220
So, um, I don't know if it's going to be the best solution, but right now there isn't a

01:59:25.220 --> 01:59:26.500
lot of other solutions.

01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:29.460
So yeah, it's what they might have to do.

01:59:29.460 --> 01:59:34.500
So, uh, we'll see, uh, what, how Evo goes, but I'm sure they want to get back to Vegas

01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:35.620
as soon as possible.

01:59:36.180 --> 01:59:38.980
Uh, and then the other big story, and this is actually a big, big deal.

01:59:38.980 --> 01:59:40.900
We just don't have a lot, a lot of information.

01:59:40.980 --> 01:59:43.380
Um, Assassin's Creed Valhalla was announced.

01:59:43.380 --> 01:59:46.980
It's going to be like a Vikings, a Norse mythology kind of themed Assassin's Creed

01:59:46.980 --> 01:59:47.380
game, right?

01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:51.380
It's, uh, going to make a God of War game where they just aren't making the God of War

01:59:51.380 --> 01:59:55.620
game, but yeah, they did the, um, whole cinematic trailer this week.

01:59:55.620 --> 02:00:00.180
And then part of the Xbox thing that they're doing next week, they're going to show gameplay.

02:00:00.900 --> 02:00:02.020
Oh, okay.

02:00:02.020 --> 02:00:02.900
Oh, that might be one.

02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:03.140
Okay.

02:00:03.140 --> 02:00:06.900
So that's one of the games that, uh, Microsoft's going to show them at that event.

02:00:06.900 --> 02:00:07.700
Good to know.

02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:13.380
Um, so yeah, but, uh, I I'm curious if it'll have like a rich history mode, like Odyssey

02:00:13.380 --> 02:00:16.900
had, you know how, like they, they really tried to make Assassin's Creed more than just

02:00:16.900 --> 02:00:18.260
like the single player campaign.

02:00:18.260 --> 02:00:19.460
I think it could be very interesting.

02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:23.220
So we'll see more details to come.

02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:25.060
We just know the basic, basic stuff right now.

02:00:25.620 --> 02:00:26.020
All right.

02:00:26.020 --> 02:00:28.980
Let's travel around the world and check out release dates.

02:00:28.980 --> 02:00:32.980
Uh, Loki, we'll start with the U S I don't even know if we have any games coming out,

02:00:32.980 --> 02:00:37.460
but, um, well, we, we have a few things, so not a whole lot.

02:00:38.420 --> 02:00:46.900
We've got John Wick hacks on PlayStation four and void bastards on Nintendo switch and PlayStation

02:00:46.900 --> 02:00:47.400
four.

02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:49.140
And that's it.

02:00:50.340 --> 02:00:50.580
Yeah.

02:00:50.580 --> 02:00:52.260
A little bit of a slower week right now.

02:00:52.260 --> 02:00:54.980
Um, especially when most of the game stores are closed.

02:00:54.980 --> 02:00:57.860
Well, I guess in some, some States are starting to open that type of stuff back up.

02:00:57.860 --> 02:00:58.180
Huh?

02:00:58.180 --> 02:01:02.180
So I keep, you know, my, my perspective is very California and we're probably going to

02:01:02.180 --> 02:01:03.780
be the last state to reopen.

02:01:03.860 --> 02:01:04.340
And I'm okay.

02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:07.620
Hmm.

02:01:07.620 --> 02:01:08.260
All right.

02:01:08.260 --> 02:01:09.780
Well, anyhow, moving on to Japan.

02:01:09.780 --> 02:01:13.540
Honestly, when I look at Japanese releases, I don't see anything on the Nintendo switch

02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:16.260
and that's probably just, you know, again, do the situation.

02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:18.580
And this is empty on PlayStation four as well.

02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:22.980
You know, I'm looking at an importer website, so I don't know if, um, the imports are just

02:01:22.980 --> 02:01:25.380
slowing down because of what's going on, which should be understandable.

02:01:25.380 --> 02:01:29.220
But according to my list, as it currently stands, we don't have any releases in Japan

02:01:29.220 --> 02:01:29.780
right now.

02:01:29.780 --> 02:01:32.180
And that just could be because of the world situation.

02:01:32.180 --> 02:01:33.460
Um, so that's all I got.

02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:34.180
How about the UK?

02:01:35.220 --> 02:01:36.980
Nothing in the UK either.

02:01:36.980 --> 02:01:37.940
All right.

02:01:37.940 --> 02:01:41.620
It's going to be going to be a slow month until we get to the other end of this stuff.

02:01:41.620 --> 02:01:41.940
All right.

02:01:41.940 --> 02:01:45.540
Uh, this would be the part of the show where we would usually read emails, which actually

02:01:45.540 --> 02:01:49.940
I'm going to check again, cause I checked before the show and we didn't have any emails.

02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:52.900
Um, but somebody actually asked for the address at the top of the show.

02:01:52.900 --> 02:01:55.540
So I'm wondering if they didn't write in during the show.

02:01:55.540 --> 02:02:00.260
And since we don't have Jamie with us tonight, we're going to have a little less content.

02:02:00.260 --> 02:02:03.060
Uh, Loki, can you buy me time while I put, pull up the emails?

02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:06.420
Cause I wasn't originally planning to, but I think somebody emailed.

02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:08.180
Yes.

02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:15.220
So as you may know, um, we, I think we may have even been last week, uh, Rick may, who,

02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:21.540
uh, voice the soldier in team fortress two passed away, um, a few weeks ago, actually

02:02:21.540 --> 02:02:22.420
on April 13th.

02:02:22.980 --> 02:02:30.740
And, um, because of this to memorialize or tribute Rick may, um, now in team fortress

02:02:30.740 --> 02:02:35.140
two valve has updated Memorial statues featuring a soldier as a tribute.

02:02:35.780 --> 02:02:41.780
Um, so those are going to be in game, I guess, at least through the month of may in honor

02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:43.620
of the passing of the voice actor.

02:02:44.740 --> 02:02:45.940
That's a very nice gesture.

02:02:46.580 --> 02:02:46.900
All right.

02:02:46.900 --> 02:02:47.460
We do this.

02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:48.820
Well, actually we do have a lot of emails.

02:02:48.820 --> 02:02:51.380
I'm glad I went back and looked because before the show, we didn't have anything.

02:02:51.380 --> 02:02:54.020
Now we have like three, so we've got a lot of emails to get through.

02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:55.780
Let's get to it and you can email us as well.

02:02:55.780 --> 02:02:58.100
Participate at orange laundry.com.

02:02:58.100 --> 02:02:59.380
We love getting emails.

02:02:59.380 --> 02:03:00.020
Here we go.

02:03:00.020 --> 02:03:01.940
First email from Frodo swagons.

02:03:01.940 --> 02:03:05.700
Hey all, there are a couple of games coming up that look pretty interesting to me.

02:03:05.700 --> 02:03:09.060
Was wondering if you've heard of them and or what you think of them.

02:03:09.060 --> 02:03:11.540
Minecraft dungeons is the first one.

02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:13.700
Uh, I'm going to just jump in and answer this right now.

02:03:13.700 --> 02:03:17.380
I already have that downloaded via Xbox game pass to my Xbox one.

02:03:17.380 --> 02:03:21.620
I'm, I'm pretty hyped for my craft dungeon because it speaks to two of my interests.

02:03:21.620 --> 02:03:24.500
I'm, I'm kind of a casual on Minecraft.

02:03:24.500 --> 02:03:28.260
I don't, but I think it's cool, but I love Diablo.

02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:32.500
And so I'm all about like a new, like triple a dungeon explore.

02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:35.060
I've been trying to fill the gap with some of the other,

02:03:35.060 --> 02:03:38.020
like there's plenty of roguelikes and dungeon explorers out there.

02:03:38.020 --> 02:03:43.220
Things like dead cells, wizard of legend, and all those games are great, but I'm,

02:03:43.220 --> 02:03:46.980
I'm looking to see what a big name like Minecraft kind of brings to the table.

02:03:46.980 --> 02:03:50.580
So yes, um, usually when we get the emails, I'm always kind of like, no,

02:03:50.580 --> 02:03:51.860
I haven't heard a lot about, no, this one.

02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:52.580
Yes, I have.

02:03:52.580 --> 02:03:53.620
Uh, Loki, what about you?

02:03:54.660 --> 02:03:55.780
I'm interested in it.

02:03:55.780 --> 02:03:57.460
I haven't purchased it at all.

02:03:57.460 --> 02:03:59.220
Do you know if there's a cross play on that at all?

02:04:00.100 --> 02:04:00.980
Good question.

02:04:00.980 --> 02:04:02.420
I'm not sure off the top of my head.

02:04:02.420 --> 02:04:03.860
I think I don't see why not.

02:04:05.060 --> 02:04:06.580
It's got to have PC and Xbox.

02:04:06.580 --> 02:04:08.740
It's a Microsoft game essentially at the end of the day.

02:04:09.540 --> 02:04:11.940
Oh, um, yeah, I'll probably pick it up on PC.

02:04:11.940 --> 02:04:15.060
Uh, and I know Frodo, you didn't ask, but our chat room is popping in too.

02:04:15.060 --> 02:04:16.580
And every gamer gets a voice here.

02:04:16.580 --> 02:04:19.220
So SGA 100 Matt says Minecraft dungeons looks great.

02:04:19.220 --> 02:04:20.660
Diablo with Minecraft.

02:04:20.660 --> 02:04:20.980
Yeah.

02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:23.060
I thought, I thought it looked cool too.

02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:26.420
Um, Loki, I know you and your family play Minecraft sometimes.

02:04:26.420 --> 02:04:28.340
So I thought maybe dungeons might interest you.

02:04:28.340 --> 02:04:29.300
So there you go.

02:04:29.300 --> 02:04:33.060
The other game we played this week, I did play Minecraft a little bit.

02:04:33.060 --> 02:04:33.560
Oh, did you?

02:04:34.260 --> 02:04:34.900
That's right.

02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:36.420
You have a server up now, don't you?

02:04:36.420 --> 02:04:37.300
Or is that not public?

02:04:37.300 --> 02:04:39.140
Yeah, it's realms.

02:04:39.140 --> 02:04:42.900
So it's like, uh, it's like a server, but smaller scale.

02:04:42.900 --> 02:04:46.500
It's up to 10 or 15 people.

02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:49.700
I can't remember what the, I think it's 10 that you pay.

02:04:49.700 --> 02:04:52.820
And it's like, like eight bucks a month or something like that.

02:04:52.820 --> 02:04:57.540
And it's officially sanctioned like through the actual, uh, Minecraft stuff.

02:04:57.540 --> 02:05:00.180
But yeah, we only do it because it's up to you of us.

02:05:00.180 --> 02:05:00.500
Okay.

02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:02.420
Is it just your family or like?

02:05:02.420 --> 02:05:04.100
Yeah, just myself and the kids.

02:05:04.100 --> 02:05:04.340
Okay.

02:05:04.340 --> 02:05:05.460
Cause I was gonna say, I'll come crash.

02:05:05.460 --> 02:05:06.900
If it's a family thing, I won't come crash.

02:05:06.900 --> 02:05:07.860
No, you can come crash.

02:05:08.420 --> 02:05:08.900
Yeah.

02:05:08.900 --> 02:05:09.700
I don't know what I do.

02:05:09.700 --> 02:05:13.220
I dig, I dig a big hole in the ground and live, live in it.

02:05:13.220 --> 02:05:14.180
Like I play Minecraft.

02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:15.620
Like I'm a fucking ant.

02:05:15.620 --> 02:05:17.540
Like, no.

02:05:17.540 --> 02:05:20.740
And here I said, you know, I didn't really play much in Minecraft.

02:05:20.740 --> 02:05:21.780
We actually, no, we did.

02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:24.180
We did take on the Ender Dragon this week.

02:05:24.180 --> 02:05:25.860
So, um, that was fun.

02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:30.660
So we did that as a family and now, um, the kids want to build the wither to

02:05:30.660 --> 02:05:31.460
fight the wither.

02:05:31.460 --> 02:05:34.420
So, um, I was helping them with that.

02:05:35.140 --> 02:05:35.460
All right.

02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:39.140
Um, now the chat room is pulling through by doing live fact checking for us.

02:05:39.140 --> 02:05:39.700
Thank you, chat.

02:05:39.700 --> 02:05:40.340
Love you.

02:05:40.340 --> 02:05:45.220
Uh, Questbuster says cross play, not at launch, but Mojang said they will be

02:05:45.220 --> 02:05:46.340
working on it post.

02:05:46.980 --> 02:05:48.500
So, all right.

02:05:48.500 --> 02:05:49.460
There's that.

02:05:49.460 --> 02:05:49.700
All right.

02:05:49.700 --> 02:05:52.740
Anyhow, the other game, I'm moving back to Frodo's Wagon's email.

02:05:52.740 --> 02:05:55.060
The other game is Assassin's Creed Valhalla.

02:05:55.060 --> 02:05:56.100
Have you heard of this one?

02:05:56.660 --> 02:05:58.100
Funny you should bring this up now.

02:05:58.100 --> 02:05:59.300
Uh, we just talked about it.

02:05:59.300 --> 02:06:02.420
I never got to be a big fan of the assassin games, but this game looks pretty

02:06:02.420 --> 02:06:03.140
damn good.

02:06:03.140 --> 02:06:07.140
I was a big fan of the Vikings series and this looks to be right up that alley.

02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:10.020
I'm not a hundred percent sure on this, but I heard when you buy a copy of the

02:06:10.020 --> 02:06:12.420
game on Xbox that you get two different versions.

02:06:12.420 --> 02:06:16.740
One version for all Xbox consoles up to the Xbox one X and one version that is

02:06:16.740 --> 02:06:19.620
only for the series X with all of the extra power.

02:06:19.700 --> 02:06:23.380
If that is true, it's kind of cool how Microsoft is going about that, including

02:06:23.380 --> 02:06:24.180
all of that.

02:06:24.180 --> 02:06:26.500
Anyway, hope all is well Frodo's wagons.

02:06:26.500 --> 02:06:29.780
Actually, I believe it's actually kind of the opposite.

02:06:29.780 --> 02:06:33.940
It's that you buy one copy of the game and it's automatically upgraded to the

02:06:33.940 --> 02:06:39.220
Xbox series X version when you upgrade your console, because that's what

02:06:39.220 --> 02:06:41.780
Microsoft's been flexing on some of their games, right?

02:06:41.780 --> 02:06:44.740
Like, like Halo is going to or Halo six, whatever they're calling it.

02:06:45.700 --> 02:06:47.300
Infinite is going to be the same thing, right?

02:06:47.300 --> 02:06:48.980
Like you can play it on an Xbox one X.

02:06:49.060 --> 02:06:53.380
And when you buy it there, it automatically transfers to series X.

02:06:53.380 --> 02:06:58.020
And the reality is Microsoft really wants you to play that stuff on game pass

02:06:58.020 --> 02:06:59.700
so they can get money from you every month.

02:06:59.700 --> 02:07:03.700
And it obviously those will be upgraded depending on whatever console you're on.

02:07:04.340 --> 02:07:07.940
But I believe Assassin's Creed is actually, you just buy it once and now

02:07:07.940 --> 02:07:09.140
you'll have it on all consoles.

02:07:09.140 --> 02:07:09.940
Am I wrong on that?

02:07:10.900 --> 02:07:11.300
Thank you.

02:07:11.300 --> 02:07:12.260
I don't remember.

02:07:12.260 --> 02:07:13.780
DJ Rama S says correct.

02:07:13.780 --> 02:07:13.940
Okay.

02:07:13.940 --> 02:07:14.740
That's what I thought.

02:07:14.740 --> 02:07:14.980
Yeah.

02:07:14.980 --> 02:07:18.580
And because that's, that's supposed to be a big draw about the game for

02:07:18.580 --> 02:07:22.980
Microsoft and one that Sony kind of hasn't answered yet.

02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:28.260
Although we know that unlike this last time, Sony fully intends to have

02:07:28.260 --> 02:07:31.300
PlayStation four games be playable on PlayStation five.

02:07:31.300 --> 02:07:35.220
Remember there was that whole kind of awkward top 100 games comment that

02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:37.060
they had to kind of go back and clarify.

02:07:37.060 --> 02:07:40.180
No, they're trying to get everything, but you know, they're just, they have

02:07:40.180 --> 02:07:41.860
their priorities, you know, that whole thing.

02:07:41.860 --> 02:07:45.780
So we know things like last of us to Final Fantasy seven remake, the

02:07:45.780 --> 02:07:49.940
recent shit it's going to play on PlayStation five, will it, will it be.

02:07:50.900 --> 02:07:51.220
I'm sorry.

02:07:52.260 --> 02:07:52.980
Read into it.

02:07:52.980 --> 02:07:55.300
Like, uh, that they were going to ignore all that stuff.

02:07:55.300 --> 02:07:58.580
It's just that, you know, like Microsoft, they have so much that they've

02:07:58.580 --> 02:08:02.260
started with, you know, making backwards compatible and then they're rolling

02:08:02.260 --> 02:08:04.180
other stuff out as they get through it.

02:08:04.180 --> 02:08:05.780
But, you know, obviously they have their priorities.

02:08:06.420 --> 02:08:06.980
Yeah.

02:08:06.980 --> 02:08:08.420
So awesome.

02:08:08.420 --> 02:08:10.900
I just closed the mailbag before I got to the next email.

02:08:11.620 --> 02:08:15.220
Uh, do you, have you been given any thought Loki too, if you're going to

02:08:15.220 --> 02:08:18.740
pick up PlayStation five, Xbox one X, like, do you think any of that is in

02:08:18.740 --> 02:08:19.780
your future this year?

02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:22.820
Uh, I don't know.

02:08:22.820 --> 02:08:26.900
Maybe Xbox that's kind of, I don't know on the fence of that.

02:08:26.900 --> 02:08:29.620
Cause I do have a PC, so I can just pick up stuff on there.

02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:29.940
True.

02:08:29.940 --> 02:08:33.940
Um, but, uh, PlayStation, maybe, I don't know.

02:08:33.940 --> 02:08:35.140
Have to see what they actually have.

02:08:36.020 --> 02:08:36.500
Okay.

02:08:36.500 --> 02:08:37.380
Sounds good.

02:08:37.380 --> 02:08:38.980
Um, come on.

02:08:38.980 --> 02:08:41.460
Now, of course, now that I need to get it back into the mailbag, I'm

02:08:41.460 --> 02:08:42.820
getting the whole spinning thing.

02:08:42.820 --> 02:08:43.060
All right.

02:08:43.060 --> 02:08:43.620
There we go.

02:08:43.620 --> 02:08:44.100
Finally.

02:08:44.100 --> 02:08:45.060
Good heavens.

02:08:45.060 --> 02:08:45.380
Okay.

02:08:45.940 --> 02:08:52.340
Our next email comes to us from Pixel Pacas who says, hi, OLR.

02:08:52.900 --> 02:08:55.940
I wanted to let y'all know about a really great game that came out

02:08:55.940 --> 02:08:56.500
recently.

02:08:56.500 --> 02:09:01.060
It's a visual novel called A Summer's End and focuses on the budding

02:09:01.060 --> 02:09:06.020
romance between two women living in Hong Kong during the 1980s.

02:09:06.020 --> 02:09:08.740
Well, that is a very kind of niche sort of thing.

02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:12.660
I can't think of a lot of games that have taken on, uh, same sex female

02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:14.900
relationships in Hong Kong in the 1980s.

02:09:14.900 --> 02:09:17.620
Uh, are there other video games that cover that, that you can think of

02:09:17.620 --> 02:09:18.020
Logie?

02:09:19.380 --> 02:09:19.620
No.

02:09:19.620 --> 02:09:20.660
So this may be a first.

02:09:20.660 --> 02:09:20.980
I don't know.

02:09:20.980 --> 02:09:22.420
No, that, but you know what?

02:09:22.420 --> 02:09:25.460
I also like, it might, you might think I'm making fun of it.

02:09:25.460 --> 02:09:26.740
I'm really not.

02:09:26.740 --> 02:09:32.900
Like I really fucking love games that make you consider differently or

02:09:32.900 --> 02:09:36.260
tell a different story that you might not have thought of otherwise.

02:09:36.260 --> 02:09:39.460
So already in this first paragraph, you have my attention.

02:09:40.660 --> 02:09:44.580
Visual novels are a genre pretty close to my heart and I play them all

02:09:44.580 --> 02:09:45.380
the time.

02:09:45.380 --> 02:09:48.420
For those who have never played the genre, there are a surprising

02:09:48.420 --> 02:09:51.300
amount of titles focused on LGBTQ themes.

02:09:51.300 --> 02:09:55.380
With that being said, most of these visual novels depict absolutely no

02:09:55.380 --> 02:09:57.060
conflict around being gay.

02:09:57.060 --> 02:10:00.020
This is a wonderful fantasy, but certainly doesn't reflect many

02:10:00.020 --> 02:10:01.540
people's actual experiences.

02:10:02.260 --> 02:10:07.220
A Summer's End uses both the timeframe and setting to make the storyline

02:10:07.220 --> 02:10:10.100
more realistic than most visual novels.

02:10:10.100 --> 02:10:14.100
The protagonist must come to terms with her sexuality and decide whether

02:10:14.100 --> 02:10:18.420
to live her own truth or live with her mother's traditional expectations.

02:10:18.420 --> 02:10:21.860
Her struggles really echoed my own, which is something I've never felt

02:10:21.860 --> 02:10:23.380
reflected in a game before.

02:10:23.380 --> 02:10:24.420
Oh, okay.

02:10:24.420 --> 02:10:26.900
So interesting that you call that out because you're right.

02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:30.580
A lot of games, like, let's say like Dream Daddy.

02:10:30.580 --> 02:10:30.820
Okay.

02:10:31.220 --> 02:10:34.820
That's an extremely well-known visual novel game that takes on LGBT

02:10:34.820 --> 02:10:35.220
themes.

02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:41.060
And it's never like, okay, these dudes are gay.

02:10:41.060 --> 02:10:41.620
Cool.

02:10:41.620 --> 02:10:44.420
You know, it's accepted by everybody.

02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:47.140
It's just the way it is in the game.

02:10:47.140 --> 02:10:51.860
So we don't often really get to explore the reality for many of us that

02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:56.020
are in the LGBT community where it's not always accepted by everyone

02:10:56.020 --> 02:10:56.900
right away.

02:10:56.900 --> 02:10:59.620
This game might make you experience that a little bit.

02:10:59.620 --> 02:11:02.820
So where I said just a minute ago, you know, I like exploring these

02:11:02.820 --> 02:11:06.260
types of things that I might not otherwise understand.

02:11:06.260 --> 02:11:08.500
You know, I certainly don't know what it's like to be a woman in Hong

02:11:08.500 --> 02:11:09.620
Kong in 1980s.

02:11:10.500 --> 02:11:15.540
I may have some experience with, you know, being gay and coming out and

02:11:15.540 --> 02:11:20.020
all that, but like, this is a game that a lot of people could maybe,

02:11:20.020 --> 02:11:22.260
like, learn something from in a way.

02:11:22.260 --> 02:11:23.780
And I think that's really cool about novels.

02:11:23.780 --> 02:11:27.300
And I bet there's, I know there's all types of these games out there.

02:11:27.300 --> 02:11:27.940
You know, I know that.

02:11:28.740 --> 02:11:32.180
Steam just had like a freaking expo they were doing.

02:11:32.180 --> 02:11:39.380
They were doing like a, it was like, it was a play on Ludum Dare was the

02:11:39.380 --> 02:11:39.780
name of it.

02:11:39.780 --> 02:11:40.900
Somebody in chat is going to yell it.

02:11:40.900 --> 02:11:42.740
I know I should bring my chat window back up.

02:11:42.740 --> 02:11:47.700
And Steam was having this big exhibition of all these visual novel games

02:11:47.700 --> 02:11:48.500
recently.

02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:49.220
And you know what?

02:11:49.220 --> 02:11:52.500
I'm sure there's all sorts of themes that are explored in these games.

02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:54.900
And it honestly, it's probably something I need to be a little more

02:11:54.900 --> 02:11:55.620
familiar with.

02:11:55.620 --> 02:11:59.460
But sometimes, like, seriously, if you went to Steam during this and saw

02:11:59.460 --> 02:12:03.300
the list of games, it can almost be overwhelming.

02:12:04.100 --> 02:12:07.620
It's like there's 500 visual novel games to choose from.

02:12:07.620 --> 02:12:12.580
And it is overwhelming, but you know, it's very akin to walking into a

02:12:12.580 --> 02:12:13.700
library.

02:12:13.700 --> 02:12:16.580
Every book has some sort of story to tell.

02:12:16.580 --> 02:12:19.940
And every game, even though I'm overwhelmed, like, Oh my God, 500

02:12:19.940 --> 02:12:22.260
games, you know, to pick from, what do I do?

02:12:22.820 --> 02:12:24.500
Every one of them has a story to tell.

02:12:25.140 --> 02:12:28.100
And some of them may be things you've never experienced before.

02:12:28.100 --> 02:12:28.500
Thank you.

02:12:28.500 --> 02:12:30.020
PixelPakas is in chat right now.

02:12:30.020 --> 02:12:33.300
It's Ludo Narakon, narrator, Narakon.

02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:33.860
So thank you.

02:12:33.860 --> 02:12:34.500
That was what I knew.

02:12:34.500 --> 02:12:37.220
It was like a play on, like, I thought, like, Ludum Dare or something.

02:12:37.220 --> 02:12:37.860
Okay.

02:12:37.860 --> 02:12:40.180
Anyway, moving on with the rest of the email.

02:12:41.140 --> 02:12:43.940
Just wanted to share this beautiful game with the OLR audience.

02:12:43.940 --> 02:12:47.300
It's currently available on Steam for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

02:12:47.300 --> 02:12:50.900
The developers want to bring it to consoles, but nothing is confirmed

02:12:50.900 --> 02:12:51.300
yet.

02:12:51.300 --> 02:12:54.260
That again from PixelPakas and the game one more time.

02:12:54.260 --> 02:12:55.780
A Summer's End.

02:12:55.780 --> 02:12:56.580
So cool.

02:12:56.580 --> 02:12:57.700
I'm going to put that on my list.

02:12:57.700 --> 02:13:00.500
So next time I get presented with a list of these 500 titles, I'll know

02:13:00.500 --> 02:13:01.380
which one to look for.

02:13:01.380 --> 02:13:02.020
So thank you.

02:13:02.660 --> 02:13:03.300
You know what?

02:13:03.300 --> 02:13:08.740
And sometimes these, like, I want to say, like, these, these lower stress

02:13:08.740 --> 02:13:12.340
games, I don't know, maybe a novel can be very stressful.

02:13:12.340 --> 02:13:13.300
Certainly they can.

02:13:13.300 --> 02:13:14.580
But you guys know what I mean.

02:13:14.580 --> 02:13:18.260
The games that always get dogged as walking simulators, like Edith Finch,

02:13:19.060 --> 02:13:22.020
Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, Dear Esther, all those types of games

02:13:22.020 --> 02:13:24.180
usually get, I know those aren't visual novels, but I think

02:13:24.180 --> 02:13:26.820
what they have similarly is that those types of games always get

02:13:26.820 --> 02:13:29.220
dogged on for not having much of a game behind it.

02:13:29.220 --> 02:13:33.220
But the stories behind it and what you go through in the game is very

02:13:33.220 --> 02:13:33.700
impressive.

02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:36.820
And I think that's something that probably is a common thread between

02:13:36.820 --> 02:13:39.540
this and visual novel games, is that visual novel games aren't

02:13:39.540 --> 02:13:41.300
necessarily hard per se.

02:13:41.300 --> 02:13:44.260
Although, I mean, if you think about it, games like King's Quest and that

02:13:44.260 --> 02:13:46.340
shit back in the day was a visual novel, sort of, sort of.

02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:50.020
And, you know, there's definitely stories to tell there.

02:13:50.020 --> 02:13:52.420
Anyway, I could go on and on, but thank you for the recommendation.

02:13:53.140 --> 02:13:53.460
All right.

02:13:53.460 --> 02:13:57.620
And our last email tonight, last but not least, from YYR.

02:13:58.660 --> 02:13:59.700
Hello, LR.

02:14:00.660 --> 02:14:03.860
I cannot begin to tell you how excited I was that Kirby's Dream Land

02:14:03.860 --> 02:14:05.780
was last week's classic game of the week.

02:14:05.780 --> 02:14:08.420
It's one of my all-time favorite games on any platforms.

02:14:09.140 --> 02:14:12.260
One of my favorite things about it, well, apart from the fantastic music,

02:14:12.260 --> 02:14:15.060
some of the best graphics on the original Game Boy and the sheer joy

02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:17.780
that comes from controlling that squishy puff ball is how the

02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:20.100
developers made the game so customizable.

02:14:20.100 --> 02:14:22.260
It can be as challenging or as easy as you want.

02:14:22.260 --> 02:14:23.940
The base game is very easy.

02:14:23.940 --> 02:14:27.380
An average Joe, who is even slightly competent at platforming and action

02:14:27.380 --> 02:14:29.700
games, can complete it without much trouble.

02:14:29.700 --> 02:14:32.900
But as was mentioned on last week's segment, when you complete the game,

02:14:32.900 --> 02:14:35.460
you receive a code to unlock a much more difficult level.

02:14:36.100 --> 02:14:39.380
Extra game, as this was called, was not simply a lazy tacked on mode

02:14:39.380 --> 02:14:42.100
where enemies do more damage, although this is also true.

02:14:42.740 --> 02:14:46.020
Most of the enemies either had entirely different behaviors or

02:14:46.020 --> 02:14:48.180
completely replaced by new enemies.

02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:51.700
All of the game's bosses had totally new patterns and attacks.

02:14:51.700 --> 02:14:54.420
If anyone was disappointed by the default difficulty,

02:14:54.420 --> 02:14:56.820
they'd generally be happy with this one.

02:14:56.820 --> 02:15:01.700
But once you manage to complete extra game, you receive a second secret code.

02:15:01.700 --> 02:15:05.300
This not only unlocks an awesome sound test feature, but also allows you

02:15:05.300 --> 02:15:08.500
to customize the life bar and the number of lives you start with.

02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:11.220
You can even combine this with extra game code if you want,

02:15:11.220 --> 02:15:14.020
making the game's difficulty 100% customizable.

02:15:14.020 --> 02:15:17.780
This was and still is a rarity in video gaming and serves to make the

02:15:17.780 --> 02:15:21.060
game even more awesome than it otherwise was.

02:15:21.060 --> 02:15:24.340
One of my favorite challenges is to play the easy difficulty,

02:15:24.340 --> 02:15:26.660
but with only a single hit point.

02:15:26.660 --> 02:15:27.620
Can you do it?

02:15:27.620 --> 02:15:28.340
You ought to try.

02:15:28.980 --> 02:15:30.900
Anyway, I'll end with an apology.

02:15:30.900 --> 02:15:34.180
Sorry, but I have no plans to add the Super Scope support to

02:15:34.180 --> 02:15:35.860
Sharpshooter Plus, darn.

02:15:35.860 --> 02:15:38.180
But I hope that you'll continue to enjoy the game without it.

02:15:38.180 --> 02:15:38.680
We will.

02:15:39.140 --> 02:15:43.300
Actually, I do have a plan to add support for some other devices eventually,

02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:46.820
possibly later this year, but, well, stay tuned.

02:15:46.820 --> 02:15:48.820
Hope you're all staying happy and healthy.

02:15:48.820 --> 02:15:50.180
Have a great week.

02:15:50.180 --> 02:15:53.060
Sucking and spitting, Aaron, yyr.

02:15:53.060 --> 02:15:54.180
Thanks for the note, yyr.

02:15:54.180 --> 02:15:54.980
Appreciate it.

02:15:54.980 --> 02:15:58.420
And yeah, go pick up Sharpshooter Plus if you haven't picked that up already.

02:15:58.420 --> 02:16:00.020
And it's always great to hear from yyr.

02:16:01.540 --> 02:16:05.220
You know what that kind of reminds me of when you talk about like a mode

02:16:05.220 --> 02:16:08.020
that you run through it the second time and the enemies change?

02:16:09.860 --> 02:16:13.060
Remember when you beat Super Mario Brothers for the first time?

02:16:13.060 --> 02:16:15.220
You kind of got like the second quest.

02:16:15.220 --> 02:16:19.620
You'd run through it again, but now the goombas are the little beetle dudes

02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:22.420
and some things are faster and some things have changed.

02:16:22.420 --> 02:16:27.140
I feel like the roots of that mode in Kirby are kind of rooted in what you

02:16:27.140 --> 02:16:29.860
saw there in like Super Mario Brothers and earlier games like that.

02:16:30.900 --> 02:16:34.180
And it's kind of, yeah, it's kind of something that was really unique to that

02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:37.460
era, the 8-bit games, and I'm looping Game Boy in with 8-bit games,

02:16:38.100 --> 02:16:40.900
kind of unique to that era we don't see as much of anymore.

02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:44.900
I mean, we see like harder modes and things that get unlocked and so forth,

02:16:45.060 --> 02:16:48.340
like, you know, replacing monsters, changing their behavior,

02:16:48.340 --> 02:16:49.940
allowing you to customize things.

02:16:50.500 --> 02:16:53.140
You didn't see that or you saw that more back in the day.

02:16:53.140 --> 02:16:56.420
You don't see it as much now, but pretty cool.

02:16:56.420 --> 02:16:58.500
Thanks. Thank you for the trip down memory lane.

02:16:58.500 --> 02:17:00.740
I appreciate that. And I will share that with Jamie when I can.

02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:02.980
All right. That is it for the email back.

02:17:02.980 --> 02:17:05.780
So we had a lot of emails considering I looked before the show and there was none.

02:17:05.780 --> 02:17:07.300
We got like three right at the buzzer there.

02:17:07.300 --> 02:17:08.660
So I appreciate that, guys. Awesome.

02:17:08.660 --> 02:17:09.780
Yeah. Awesome. All right.

02:17:09.780 --> 02:17:12.820
Well, let's get back into a few more stories here before we wrap up for the night.

02:17:12.820 --> 02:17:14.260
So, Loki, why don't you start us off?

02:17:14.980 --> 02:17:17.380
So I've been wondering for a while, it's like,

02:17:17.380 --> 02:17:19.620
when are we going to start using these amiibos again?

02:17:19.620 --> 02:17:24.980
Because, you know, obviously, since we didn't really have much amiibo support,

02:17:24.980 --> 02:17:27.220
or I don't think any. I don't know about you,

02:17:27.220 --> 02:17:31.140
but I've finally been using those Animal Crossing ones I collected to get,

02:17:31.140 --> 02:17:34.020
I guess, for Animal Crossing. All those posters. Yeah.

02:17:34.020 --> 02:17:37.060
But I'm talking about like, you know, for like Mario Maker 2 and stuff.

02:17:37.060 --> 02:17:39.700
So I was wondering, when's this going to happen?

02:17:39.700 --> 02:17:41.780
Well, apparently that may be happening soon.

02:17:41.780 --> 02:17:46.260
So thanks to a new patent filed by Nintendo,

02:17:46.260 --> 02:17:49.940
it appears that amiibos are going to be back in a brand new game.

02:17:52.260 --> 02:17:56.180
So the functionality, I can't really tell what they're doing with this.

02:17:56.180 --> 02:18:00.100
For example, it looks like some sort of RPG or something like that.

02:18:00.980 --> 02:18:05.620
They show like a picture of like playing as the squid kid or something like that.

02:18:05.620 --> 02:18:08.900
So I'm wondering if this is going to somehow allow you to play as

02:18:08.900 --> 02:18:11.540
different amiibo characters in certain games.

02:18:12.180 --> 02:18:18.740
Um, pretty neat though. I'm not really sure what exactly it's supposed to be

02:18:18.740 --> 02:18:21.540
that they're developing, but maybe we'll hear about that soon.

02:18:22.740 --> 02:18:26.980
That could be really cool if that's like a Nintendo online thing,

02:18:26.980 --> 02:18:30.340
that like you could download a free, you know, simple,

02:18:30.340 --> 02:18:34.180
simple-ish RPG where your amiibo are the characters.

02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:36.100
It makes me think there's this Disney game

02:18:36.660 --> 02:18:39.140
they've been pushing on a lot of ad platforms lately.

02:18:39.140 --> 02:18:41.300
That's essentially like an RPG with different characters.

02:18:41.380 --> 02:18:44.260
It's all like a gacha mechanic, but you unlock different,

02:18:44.260 --> 02:18:46.260
it's like Disney sorcery or something like that.

02:18:46.260 --> 02:18:48.340
I don't know. I'm not going to, they're not paying me.

02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:50.420
I'm not going to plug it, but they have something like that.

02:18:50.420 --> 02:18:53.620
So I'm thinking like, what if like, okay, well, instead of like gacha,

02:18:53.620 --> 02:18:58.820
what if Nintendo use like amiibo to kind of have their own type of like RPG game

02:18:58.820 --> 02:19:02.260
that you could build your team and fight against other teams and things like that.

02:19:02.260 --> 02:19:04.180
And maybe it's something they tied in Nintendo online.

02:19:04.180 --> 02:19:07.060
It's like, here's another perk of being a Nintendo online subscriber.

02:19:07.060 --> 02:19:10.820
Cause you know, we're going to have that year is about to come up again.

02:19:10.820 --> 02:19:14.020
Many people got another year free thanks to Twitch prime,

02:19:14.020 --> 02:19:15.700
but I'm going to guess that doesn't happen again.

02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:19.140
So people are going to have to, you know, pay the money for another year

02:19:19.140 --> 02:19:21.620
and people will probably do it just for animal crossing.

02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:25.860
But you know, what, what other value are they going to bring to that Tetris 99?

02:19:25.860 --> 02:19:27.380
That was a great one, but what else?

02:19:27.380 --> 02:19:31.060
You know, cause the, the classic library, those wells have been drying up.

02:19:32.580 --> 02:19:33.080
Yeah.

02:19:33.620 --> 02:19:38.020
I don't know with all the Nintendo and super Nintendo games on there, man.

02:19:38.580 --> 02:19:41.300
So it's a NES remix or super NES remix.

02:19:42.260 --> 02:19:45.780
I know, but I take a amiibo based RPG.

02:19:45.780 --> 02:19:50.340
Why not give me more value to all those little suckers that I spent all that money on?

02:19:50.340 --> 02:19:51.220
I'd love it.

02:19:51.220 --> 02:19:55.220
If they had like an amiibo RPG game, I'd already have like 200 characters.

02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:57.860
It might not that many, but I'd have a lot.

02:19:57.860 --> 02:20:01.060
I would have a lot considering all the characters that I have.

02:20:01.060 --> 02:20:03.220
It might not support everything though.

02:20:03.220 --> 02:20:06.660
Like they might not have the rights to use something like cloud.

02:20:07.460 --> 02:20:11.780
Um, but they could probably use, I mean, the third party stuff.

02:20:11.780 --> 02:20:13.380
There aren't a lot of those.

02:20:13.380 --> 02:20:16.660
Most of them are based around Nintendo first party franchises and they can do whatever

02:20:16.660 --> 02:20:17.380
they want with those.

02:20:17.380 --> 02:20:20.020
So it'd be interesting to see if that actually happens.

02:20:20.580 --> 02:20:21.300
All right.

02:20:21.300 --> 02:20:25.540
Well, moving on to talk about Xbox game pass and how well it's been doing, uh, as of late,

02:20:25.540 --> 02:20:27.060
you know, I, I was talking about game pass.

02:20:27.060 --> 02:20:28.740
I was using it to play streets of rage four.

02:20:29.380 --> 02:20:30.580
I think it's pretty neat.

02:20:30.580 --> 02:20:32.900
And a lot of other people apparently tuning onto it as well.

02:20:33.460 --> 02:20:34.260
Excuse me.

02:20:34.260 --> 02:20:36.500
Game pass has over 10 million subscribers.

02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:39.460
That's a pretty big landmark, 10 million people on game pass.

02:20:39.460 --> 02:20:43.700
Uh, Phil Spencer, head of Xbox noted this recently in a new blog post talking about

02:20:43.700 --> 02:20:45.700
how the service is continuing to grow.

02:20:45.700 --> 02:20:48.580
That was up from 9.5 million last year.

02:20:48.580 --> 02:20:53.780
Uh, and, uh, also in the blog post, it was noted subscribers are playing games twice

02:20:53.780 --> 02:20:57.220
as much since the COVID 19 pandemic started.

02:20:57.220 --> 02:20:58.820
And I'm kind of one of those people.

02:20:59.700 --> 02:21:03.620
I wasn't really dipping into like deeply into the library.

02:21:03.620 --> 02:21:06.180
I might check out a first party Microsoft title when it's released,

02:21:06.180 --> 02:21:08.740
but I wasn't playing a lot of other stuff now.

02:21:08.740 --> 02:21:12.820
I've been like, I've been going deep in that library and playing everything.

02:21:12.820 --> 02:21:16.740
So, um, yeah, I think game pass has been great for me.

02:21:16.740 --> 02:21:20.100
So, um, congrats to them on 10 million.

02:21:20.100 --> 02:21:22.420
That means I think this is going to be around for awhile.

02:21:22.420 --> 02:21:28.260
I'm very curious to see how they build this into the Xbox series X economy and

02:21:28.260 --> 02:21:33.380
essentially if video games don't generally just go a Netflix direction like movies have.

02:21:34.100 --> 02:21:34.580
We'll see.

02:21:35.220 --> 02:21:35.860
We'll see.

02:21:35.860 --> 02:21:36.100
Yeah.

02:21:36.100 --> 02:21:40.980
I mean, definitely it would be a more appealing offer for me if they had more games on the

02:21:40.980 --> 02:21:42.100
PC side of things.

02:21:42.100 --> 02:21:45.700
Um, that may be why I may need to get one of the series X's.

02:21:45.700 --> 02:21:48.420
Um, well that a 4k monitor, I would assume.

02:21:49.060 --> 02:21:50.420
So, um, we'll see.

02:21:50.420 --> 02:21:53.220
S2 and her mountain chat says I still don't have game pass.

02:21:53.220 --> 02:21:55.060
I should probably get it at this rate.

02:21:55.060 --> 02:21:58.900
My issue is that I'm trying to finish the game I already have before getting more.

02:21:58.900 --> 02:21:59.460
Yeah.

02:21:59.460 --> 02:22:04.420
Um, if you're worried about your backlog expanding, Xbox game pass isn't really going to help

02:22:04.420 --> 02:22:05.220
with that.

02:22:05.220 --> 02:22:07.300
Um, but it's still pretty impressive.

02:22:07.300 --> 02:22:12.500
I also want my one other thing about game pass is that it's got a decent selection.

02:22:12.500 --> 02:22:20.980
I wish it were a little larger because I feel like there's a very rich Xbox 360 and original

02:22:20.980 --> 02:22:25.860
Xbox library that they haven't fully tapped into as much as they could.

02:22:26.580 --> 02:22:32.420
Um, and maybe that's probably has to do with rights licenses and so forth, but even first

02:22:32.420 --> 02:22:37.780
party Microsoft titles, we don't have enough of those on game pass.

02:22:37.780 --> 02:22:42.260
And so that's maybe where I'd like to see game pass really round out because I'm telling,

02:22:42.260 --> 02:22:45.220
you know, and I understand it's probably a little harder to get the current stuff it's

02:22:45.220 --> 02:22:50.660
over, but like these Xbox 360 games that, you know, they probably don't make money anymore.

02:22:50.660 --> 02:22:52.020
They're not selling them new.

02:22:52.020 --> 02:22:56.100
They're probably only moving around on the third party market, maybe a few digital copies

02:22:56.100 --> 02:23:00.020
here and there, but think about how much, you know, you might be able to make on a subscription

02:23:00.020 --> 02:23:03.940
based thing where it's like, Oh, you know, all these games that I haven't touched in

02:23:03.940 --> 02:23:09.540
like 10 years, I can go back and check out, you know, so it'd be cool.

02:23:09.540 --> 02:23:10.580
So we'll see.

02:23:10.580 --> 02:23:11.140
I do.

02:23:11.140 --> 02:23:13.700
I still would recommend game pass as it is.

02:23:13.700 --> 02:23:14.100
It's fine.

02:23:14.100 --> 02:23:18.980
But I think, Ooh, if we could just like round out that library even more with like a stronger,

02:23:18.980 --> 02:23:20.340
like retro ish.

02:23:20.340 --> 02:23:23.060
It's weird to talk about Xbox 360 as retro, but that's what it is.

02:23:24.100 --> 02:23:24.820
What was that again?

02:23:24.820 --> 02:23:30.740
It was, uh, um, what the hell was the, uh, the Xbox arcade thing?

02:23:30.740 --> 02:23:31.700
Oh, game room.

02:23:31.700 --> 02:23:32.900
Oh, don't get me started.

02:23:32.900 --> 02:23:33.940
Game room.

02:23:33.940 --> 02:23:34.420
Come on.

02:23:35.060 --> 02:23:35.700
I'd love it.

02:23:35.700 --> 02:23:40.020
But the rights get complicated because of all the Atari games and all that stuff.

02:23:40.020 --> 02:23:41.620
But yeah, we'll see.

02:23:41.620 --> 02:23:42.820
We'll see what comes of that.

02:23:42.820 --> 02:23:43.060
All right.

02:23:43.060 --> 02:23:43.700
Moving on.

02:23:43.700 --> 02:23:44.580
Do you want to do this Loki?

02:23:44.580 --> 02:23:47.540
You want me to take it or the next story that Jamie had?

02:23:47.540 --> 02:23:48.100
Okay.

02:23:48.100 --> 02:23:49.540
Yeah, I can talk about it.

02:23:49.540 --> 02:23:57.700
So, um, we've got the university of Utah, obviously not going to be able to hold their

02:23:57.700 --> 02:24:04.260
graduation, um, live, um, at least outside when the world there, but apparently they're

02:24:04.260 --> 02:24:08.660
going to be holding it digitally in a video game that they designed.

02:24:09.380 --> 02:24:14.500
So, um, they're going to be able to join in, in that video game as different avatars and

02:24:14.500 --> 02:24:17.060
be able to walk down the aisle.

02:24:17.060 --> 02:24:19.620
And I don't know, this whole game looks like Roblox.

02:24:19.620 --> 02:24:20.260
I swear to God.

02:24:20.260 --> 02:24:26.900
But, uh, anyways, um, so yeah, they're going to be doing this digital ceremony and being

02:24:26.900 --> 02:24:30.900
allowed, I guess also streaming on Twitch so that your family and friends can watch.

02:24:32.340 --> 02:24:32.740
Cool.

02:24:32.740 --> 02:24:33.380
Pretty neat.

02:24:33.940 --> 02:24:39.220
Hey, it's making the best of a not so great situation, but you know, I know a lot of people

02:24:39.220 --> 02:24:42.580
have been doing the zoom stuff to keep in touch and yeah, it's, it's cool.

02:24:42.580 --> 02:24:46.500
So, you know, it's, it's something it's what we got to do in these times.

02:24:46.500 --> 02:24:51.060
Just think I kind of like the, the lobbies and everything that they made, like, I don't

02:24:51.060 --> 02:24:54.260
know, it looks like it's almost like unreal four or something, but yeah, it just looks

02:24:54.260 --> 02:24:58.260
like people dressed up like in cosplay on most people, avatar things over their head.

02:24:58.260 --> 02:24:59.860
But I don't know.

02:24:59.860 --> 02:25:00.500
It's pretty cool.

02:25:01.060 --> 02:25:04.660
Uh, Bobby Blackwolf and chat points out, I had a Facebook friend post about playing

02:25:04.660 --> 02:25:07.780
retro classic games with their kid during shelter in place.

02:25:07.780 --> 02:25:09.300
They were playing Wii bowling,

02:25:09.300 --> 02:25:15.140
which I mean, we, what we bowling was 2006.

02:25:15.140 --> 02:25:16.660
That's a 14 year old game.

02:25:16.660 --> 02:25:16.980
Sorry.

02:25:17.860 --> 02:25:18.740
Play what you got.

02:25:18.740 --> 02:25:22.100
It's just funny to call it retro, but it is right.

02:25:22.100 --> 02:25:23.780
It would qualify as classic game of the week.

02:25:23.780 --> 02:25:24.340
Wouldn't it?

02:25:24.340 --> 02:25:25.700
It's over 10 years old.

02:25:26.340 --> 02:25:26.580
All right.

02:25:26.580 --> 02:25:30.100
Which I'm actually, no, we say that I'm kind of surprised that hasn't come up maybe in

02:25:30.100 --> 02:25:30.900
the future.

02:25:30.900 --> 02:25:31.300
All right.

02:25:31.300 --> 02:25:35.220
It may have, I'm surprised it hasn't been.

02:25:35.220 --> 02:25:36.100
I don't think so.

02:25:36.100 --> 02:25:36.580
I don't know.

02:25:37.300 --> 02:25:39.140
There's always games that come up.

02:25:39.140 --> 02:25:40.260
Just like, just like dark soccer.

02:25:40.260 --> 02:25:42.900
Like a couple of weeks ago, she picked a game where it's like, how have I never picked this

02:25:42.900 --> 02:25:43.400
game?

02:25:43.780 --> 02:25:44.500
It just happens.

02:25:44.500 --> 02:25:46.100
There's, there's a lot of games out there.

02:25:46.100 --> 02:25:46.660
All right.

02:25:46.660 --> 02:25:48.660
Uh, moving on just a couple more stories for you guys.

02:25:48.660 --> 02:25:49.160
Loki.

02:25:50.100 --> 02:25:50.900
All right.

02:25:50.900 --> 02:25:53.780
So let's talk a little bit about Nintendo again.

02:25:53.780 --> 02:26:00.980
And unfortunately, since you may not be using, um, the Wii U very much, their eShop is of

02:26:00.980 --> 02:26:03.060
course closing July 31st.

02:26:03.060 --> 02:26:08.020
Same with Nintendo 3DS, uh, July 31st in some countries.

02:26:08.020 --> 02:26:09.300
So not everywhere.

02:26:09.300 --> 02:26:17.700
Um, several countries in the Caribbean and Latin America are closing shop there.

02:26:17.700 --> 02:26:23.300
Um, there's too many to list fortunately, but it is unfortunate those are closing.

02:26:24.020 --> 02:26:26.420
I guess you just got to move on to the new platforms.

02:26:27.300 --> 02:26:32.900
Um, yeah, both shops in Mexico and Brazil will be exempt from these closures.

02:26:34.020 --> 02:26:34.500
Yeah.

02:26:34.500 --> 02:26:39.140
So I'm not terribly surprised to hear about Wii U and again, this is other countries,

02:26:39.140 --> 02:26:40.180
not the US.

02:26:40.180 --> 02:26:45.060
I'm not terribly surprised to hear about Wii U going away because I think Nintendo is ready

02:26:45.060 --> 02:26:46.740
to let that shit go.

02:26:46.740 --> 02:26:47.940
Um, which it does.

02:26:48.500 --> 02:26:51.140
Wii U still has a great virtual console library.

02:26:51.140 --> 02:26:54.900
Wii U still has some good, you know, especially the fact that Wii U kind of emulates Wii.

02:26:54.900 --> 02:26:59.460
There's still a lot of things to like about it, but, um, you know, I, I it's kind of one

02:26:59.460 --> 02:27:00.260
of those, I get it.

02:27:00.260 --> 02:27:03.860
Nintendo is ready to be rid of the ghost of the Wii U.

02:27:03.860 --> 02:27:08.900
I'm a little more surprised about 3DS because I feel like Nintendo is still kind of been

02:27:08.900 --> 02:27:10.260
pushing that device.

02:27:10.820 --> 02:27:15.540
And again, we have to stress it's other countries right now, but I still feel, I feel like the

02:27:15.540 --> 02:27:21.620
last time this happened with the Wii shop, the US and Europe and Japan were not far behind.

02:27:23.060 --> 02:27:24.260
Am I, am I just crazy?

02:27:24.260 --> 02:27:25.380
Am I remembering this a different way?

02:27:25.380 --> 02:27:27.700
But I feel like this is very similar to what happened before.

02:27:29.460 --> 02:27:29.780
Right.

02:27:29.780 --> 02:27:30.260
Yeah.

02:27:30.260 --> 02:27:34.420
It wasn't that far long after that the days ended up shutting that stuff down.

02:27:34.420 --> 02:27:35.380
I think so.

02:27:35.380 --> 02:27:38.340
So, I mean, even though it's not the US and Europe, it might be.

02:27:38.340 --> 02:27:43.540
So I'm just saying if you have points, you got gift cards, you might want to just go

02:27:43.540 --> 02:27:44.660
find something to buy.

02:27:44.660 --> 02:27:48.020
There's still, there's still a lot of good stuff on Wii U and so forth and 3DS.

02:27:48.020 --> 02:27:49.300
Go find it, go buy it.

02:27:49.300 --> 02:27:53.780
Cause can't guarantee it's going to be there much longer and show those developers a little

02:27:53.780 --> 02:27:56.260
love who probably haven't had their games sell in a while.

02:27:56.260 --> 02:27:57.060
So, all right.

02:27:57.940 --> 02:28:01.460
Uh, one systems games, you're not going to be able to find on virtual console though,

02:28:01.460 --> 02:28:04.500
which is a shame is the Atari 2600.

02:28:04.500 --> 02:28:06.820
Well, I guess they do have those flashback games.

02:28:06.820 --> 02:28:07.540
Right.

02:28:07.540 --> 02:28:10.580
But, um, I haven't played the latest flashback series.

02:28:10.580 --> 02:28:15.380
There's like a three volume flashback series, but I've been a little on the, I, I feel

02:28:15.380 --> 02:28:17.700
like they might, I don't know.

02:28:17.700 --> 02:28:20.580
I feel like the breaking it up into three volumes isn't the way to do it.

02:28:20.580 --> 02:28:20.980
We'll see.

02:28:20.980 --> 02:28:21.700
I don't know.

02:28:21.700 --> 02:28:23.700
Anyway, but that's not what this is about.

02:28:23.700 --> 02:28:27.780
This is about using the Atari 2600 to teach AI.

02:28:28.580 --> 02:28:34.820
So a team of Uber AI researchers developed a system called go explore.

02:28:35.860 --> 02:28:39.540
It will beat any Atari 2600 game.

02:28:39.540 --> 02:28:41.140
I don't know what they mean by any though.

02:28:41.140 --> 02:28:44.660
Cause there was, there was a lot of bullshit Atari 2600 games.

02:28:44.660 --> 02:28:50.500
So I, does it really mean any, I guess we'll see, uh, with super, you can see the receipts.

02:28:50.500 --> 02:28:50.660
Yeah.

02:28:50.660 --> 02:28:53.620
I want to see the receipts with superhuman scores.

02:28:53.700 --> 02:28:59.060
Including ones where the AI previously could not beat real players.

02:28:59.940 --> 02:29:04.580
It's a system that remembers promising States and return to those States before it goes

02:29:04.580 --> 02:29:05.460
out exploring.

02:29:07.380 --> 02:29:13.700
It's been improved over older AI, like deep mind, uh, on games like Monzuma's revenge

02:29:13.700 --> 02:29:16.660
and got a near perfect pitfall score.

02:29:16.660 --> 02:29:21.620
Uh, so it's, it's interesting to see there's a full series of tweets on this.

02:29:21.700 --> 02:29:25.940
And if you want to see the user's account, Jeff Klune, uh, is obviously one of the people

02:29:25.940 --> 02:29:26.420
working on it.

02:29:26.420 --> 02:29:28.420
Cause it's his, uh, Twitter account.

02:29:28.420 --> 02:29:33.300
Uh, and he puts in a tweet, go explore now solves all unsolved Atari games.

02:29:33.300 --> 02:29:37.060
Here's a little asterisk with it because it probably won't do beat him and eat him.

02:29:37.060 --> 02:29:38.180
It's just not going to do that.

02:29:38.180 --> 02:29:38.500
Okay.

02:29:38.500 --> 02:29:45.300
It's good, but it might play other games, uh, handles, uh, sto stochastic training throughout

02:29:45.300 --> 02:29:50.660
via goal condition policies, reuses skills to intelligently explore after returning and

02:29:50.660 --> 02:29:54.180
solves hard exploration, simulated robot tasks.

02:29:54.180 --> 02:30:00.260
And so there's a whole bunch of tweets on this and videos that you can see this AI getting

02:30:00.260 --> 02:30:02.500
better and better with Atari 2,600.

02:30:02.500 --> 02:30:06.740
And you know, a lot of those Atari 2,600 games were fairly simple.

02:30:06.740 --> 02:30:12.260
And I think that's what makes this notable is that it's not just doing one thing.

02:30:12.260 --> 02:30:14.740
Well, chess is pretty simple, right?

02:30:14.740 --> 02:30:19.940
And we know there's great chess AI out there, but now AI is evolving into this.

02:30:19.940 --> 02:30:21.940
It can do a variety of things.

02:30:21.940 --> 02:30:26.980
Well, there's still simple relatively, but it has a pattern that it learns from and it

02:30:26.980 --> 02:30:27.780
builds on that.

02:30:28.500 --> 02:30:33.300
And so it's almost one of those things where you have to wonder how much further behind

02:30:33.300 --> 02:30:35.780
are going to be more complicated games.

02:30:35.780 --> 02:30:38.180
How many are going to play eat and hate humanity, right?

02:30:40.580 --> 02:30:45.300
It's going to go, it's going to play ET and then grow sentient and try to destroy humans.

02:30:45.300 --> 02:30:46.180
Why, why not?

02:30:46.180 --> 02:30:46.740
Why not?

02:30:46.740 --> 02:30:48.980
Just, why don't you throw that on 2020 as well?

02:30:48.980 --> 02:30:49.860
How about, how about it?

02:30:49.860 --> 02:30:50.500
Come on.

02:30:50.500 --> 02:30:51.460
Cylon attack.

02:30:51.460 --> 02:30:51.860
Why not?

02:30:55.380 --> 02:30:55.940
There you go.

02:30:55.940 --> 02:30:57.540
I think, I think that's a neat story though.

02:30:58.660 --> 02:31:03.300
The AI stuff is very fascinating and it kind of makes my head hurt, but it's cool stuff.

02:31:04.020 --> 02:31:07.220
So that is it for the news that we had scheduled tonight.

02:31:07.220 --> 02:31:10.820
If you guys have any questions for us, I will open up the listener roundtable for a moment

02:31:10.820 --> 02:31:14.740
in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

02:31:14.740 --> 02:31:17.460
If you have anything you want to ask or any statements you want to make, we'll have a

02:31:17.460 --> 02:31:18.820
quick round table.

02:31:18.820 --> 02:31:21.940
Otherwise I'll check in with Loki to see if there's any last minute stories.

02:31:21.940 --> 02:31:24.340
I kind of feel like I haven't already covered.

02:31:25.220 --> 02:31:28.340
I've got to feel like we covered a lot of the big, it was kind of a, I don't want to

02:31:28.340 --> 02:31:32.420
say it was a slow news week, but it's, it's slowing down because I think people aren't

02:31:32.420 --> 02:31:34.260
working as much or as fast.

02:31:34.260 --> 02:31:40.660
And now, well, I mean the gaming industry in general, in the summer of games festival

02:31:40.660 --> 02:31:46.260
time now, I expect things might pick up in that timeframe where E3 would have been.

02:31:46.260 --> 02:31:50.420
And certainly, you know, for this four month period or whatever, uh, but we're very much

02:31:50.420 --> 02:31:53.540
in a quiet period right now, but I guess things are going to pick up with this week.

02:31:53.540 --> 02:31:54.500
We get the Xbox stuff.

02:31:54.500 --> 02:31:55.780
That's going to be a pretty big deal.

02:31:55.780 --> 02:31:56.260
Yeah.

02:31:56.260 --> 02:31:57.620
So I'm excited to see that.

02:31:57.620 --> 02:31:58.340
Yeah.

02:31:58.340 --> 02:32:01.540
Uh, any, any wishlist game on the new Xbox for you?

02:32:02.900 --> 02:32:04.660
I talk, I keep talking about fable.

02:32:04.660 --> 02:32:05.300
What about for you?

02:32:05.300 --> 02:32:06.660
What would be cool like that?

02:32:06.660 --> 02:32:09.700
I mean, that's really kind of, I'd be interested in fable.

02:32:09.700 --> 02:32:15.300
I don't really know what else I would, maybe they'll bring back cameo.

02:32:15.940 --> 02:32:16.500
I don't know.

02:32:16.500 --> 02:32:20.020
Hey, maybe, maybe, uh, for some motorsport for me.

02:32:20.020 --> 02:32:20.500
Oh yeah.

02:32:20.500 --> 02:32:20.820
I'm sorry.

02:32:20.820 --> 02:32:21.940
Not sorry.

02:32:21.940 --> 02:32:27.140
Forza Horizon for me, not so much motorsport because I don't do the sim games as well as

02:32:27.140 --> 02:32:29.380
I do the arcade games, but I do.

02:32:29.380 --> 02:32:34.420
I realize motorsport is probably going to be first, but that doesn't mean I don't want

02:32:34.420 --> 02:32:38.740
a Forza Horizon game at some point, or at least an arcade eraser type of game.

02:32:39.380 --> 02:32:40.020
That's for sure.

02:32:40.020 --> 02:32:40.580
Yeah.

02:32:40.580 --> 02:32:40.820
Yeah.

02:32:41.620 --> 02:32:45.620
But I, I, I would think fable would be a great thing to come out of the gate with if that

02:32:45.620 --> 02:32:47.220
is something in their sleeve.

02:32:47.220 --> 02:32:49.940
So I would love to see like Forza and fable.

02:32:50.660 --> 02:32:53.940
And I guess Assassin's Creed Valhalla will be a game that they're going to show.

02:32:53.940 --> 02:32:55.060
We already kind of know that.

02:32:55.060 --> 02:32:56.260
So we'll see.

02:32:56.260 --> 02:33:00.180
Oh, the only little bit I did see here real quick as I was browsing through things.

02:33:00.180 --> 02:33:00.420
Yeah.

02:33:00.420 --> 02:33:03.460
Burnout paradise remastereds coming on the switch on June 19th.

02:33:04.340 --> 02:33:05.540
They were 50 bucks for it.

02:33:06.340 --> 02:33:06.580
Yeah.

02:33:06.580 --> 02:33:07.460
I'm not worth it.

02:33:07.460 --> 02:33:08.740
Just buy it on PC for that.

02:33:08.740 --> 02:33:09.780
Like 20 bucks.

02:33:09.780 --> 02:33:10.260
You might want it.

02:33:10.260 --> 02:33:10.660
Well, I don't know.

02:33:10.660 --> 02:33:12.820
Maybe the portability is that important to some people.

02:33:12.820 --> 02:33:15.700
I might, I'm going to, I'm going to wait for a discount.

02:33:15.700 --> 02:33:20.900
I hope, I hope this doesn't cause EA to go see Nintendo sucks.

02:33:20.900 --> 02:33:23.140
Cause our game didn't sell well on there.

02:33:23.140 --> 02:33:23.780
Fuck off.

02:33:25.780 --> 02:33:30.740
To where they think, why isn't there a game from like, I don't even know how old that

02:33:30.740 --> 02:33:33.540
is that like super old already.

02:33:33.540 --> 02:33:38.820
Like was it selling, you know, it's been a few years since the remastered came out and

02:33:39.460 --> 02:33:40.660
now it's coming out on the switch.

02:33:40.660 --> 02:33:41.940
Oh, well, sorry.

02:33:41.940 --> 02:33:43.780
You know, maybe you should have put it out sooner.

02:33:43.780 --> 02:33:44.100
Yeah.

02:33:44.100 --> 02:33:46.740
They need to not set themselves up for disaster.

02:33:46.740 --> 02:33:50.020
Maybe they want to milk the hardest of the hardcore or something.

02:33:50.020 --> 02:33:54.260
I don't know what their logic is first, but if that game doesn't come down in price pretty

02:33:54.260 --> 02:33:56.580
fast, they're, they're not being smart about it.

02:33:56.580 --> 02:33:57.620
So yeah.

02:33:57.620 --> 02:34:00.820
And SGL 100, Matt says, I'm more worried about them saying burnout is dead.

02:34:00.820 --> 02:34:02.340
Why should we make a new one?

02:34:02.340 --> 02:34:05.220
Like look at your idiot launch strategy.

02:34:05.220 --> 02:34:07.140
Maybe go to that first.

02:34:07.140 --> 02:34:07.540
Jeez.

02:34:08.980 --> 02:34:09.620
We'll see.

02:34:09.620 --> 02:34:09.940
All right.

02:34:09.940 --> 02:34:10.500
Anything else?

02:34:11.300 --> 02:34:11.940
That's it.

02:34:11.940 --> 02:34:12.180
All right.

02:34:12.180 --> 02:34:16.020
Well, I think we're going to go ahead and wrap up and call it a night here at orange

02:34:16.020 --> 02:34:16.820
launch radio.

02:34:16.820 --> 02:34:20.180
Hey, thank you guys for tuning into our show, whether you were here live or whether you

02:34:20.180 --> 02:34:21.860
joined us on the podcast feed.

02:34:21.860 --> 02:34:23.140
Really appreciate you being here.

02:34:23.140 --> 02:34:26.980
I know the show felt a little bit off tonight and hopefully I'll be able to tell you more

02:34:27.620 --> 02:34:31.860
later on, but, um, you know, just definitely thinking of a dark soccer and the family right

02:34:31.860 --> 02:34:32.420
now.

02:34:32.420 --> 02:34:35.220
Um, and, uh, hopefully she's back next week.

02:34:35.220 --> 02:34:35.860
I don't know.

02:34:35.860 --> 02:34:36.740
Hard to say.

02:34:36.740 --> 02:34:40.500
Um, but we'll, we'll keep providing a show for you guys to get us through these tough

02:34:40.500 --> 02:34:42.980
times, uh, one way or the other.

02:34:42.980 --> 02:34:46.420
Um, in the meantime, thanks again for tuning in and listening.

02:34:46.420 --> 02:34:49.540
If you liked what you heard here at orange Ontario, please tell a friend about the show.

02:34:49.540 --> 02:34:52.740
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we

02:34:52.740 --> 02:34:54.740
have to have the voices here to hear them.

02:34:54.740 --> 02:34:59.780
Um, so a nice five star review wherever you found this show goes a long way on auto host

02:34:59.780 --> 02:35:00.900
on Twitch or raid.

02:35:00.900 --> 02:35:01.940
I saw raid come in tonight.

02:35:01.940 --> 02:35:02.820
Thank you so much for that.

02:35:02.820 --> 02:35:04.820
Uh, all that type of stuff goes a long way.

02:35:04.980 --> 02:35:06.100
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

02:35:06.100 --> 02:35:10.180
Um, for those of you that go the extra mile to support orange on radio, we really appreciate

02:35:10.180 --> 02:35:10.900
you.

02:35:10.900 --> 02:35:14.020
Um, otherwise, Loki, do you have a final thought for us tonight?

02:35:14.980 --> 02:35:16.660
No, that's pretty much it.

02:35:16.660 --> 02:35:20.340
I'm going to try to, uh, try to work on my game this week.

02:35:20.340 --> 02:35:22.260
Cross my fingers, then we'll do it.

02:35:22.900 --> 02:35:25.140
If not, I'll just work on some step mania songs.

02:35:26.180 --> 02:35:30.020
Um, and then my final thought is, um, I know it's almost nine o'clock, but I hope I can

02:35:30.020 --> 02:35:34.500
find a one star raid somewhere nearby, uh, so I can move on in my Pokemon go quests.

02:35:34.900 --> 02:35:38.500
Because the research is limited time, you know, so I got to make sure I finished that

02:35:38.500 --> 02:35:39.540
before wet, like Friday.

02:35:39.540 --> 02:35:44.660
So try to get on that, but I'm glad they're not just doing a gen one event and we get

02:35:44.660 --> 02:35:46.660
gen two next week and gen three the week out.

02:35:46.660 --> 02:35:49.140
Thank gosh for a little diversity of my Pokemans.

02:35:49.140 --> 02:35:50.100
I appreciate that.

02:35:50.740 --> 02:35:54.100
All right, that's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio until next

02:35:54.100 --> 02:35:54.340
week.

02:35:54.900 --> 02:35:57.940
Take care, have fun gaming online.

02:35:57.940 --> 02:36:03.460
Um, stay safe everybody, uh, as more and more States and things start to open up.

02:36:03.460 --> 02:36:10.100
Um, just, you know, listen to doctors, listen to science, be safe, protect yourself, wash

02:36:10.100 --> 02:36:11.620
your hands, all that good stuff.

02:36:12.260 --> 02:36:13.060
Take care of yourself.

02:36:13.060 --> 02:36:14.020
That's the most important thing.

02:36:14.020 --> 02:36:14.980
We'll see you in seven days.

02:36:14.980 --> 02:36:15.300
Goodbye.

02:36:16.260 --> 02:36:18.900
