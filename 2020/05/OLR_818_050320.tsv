0	19000	This week Xbox Game Pass, the Netflix of Xbox and PC games crosses 10 million subscribers.
19000	22240	On the cusp of a new gaming generation, PS Now and Game Pass seem to be settling in to
22240	23240	change game purchasing.
23240	25960	This is just one headline from the week's news, stay tuned for more, starting right
25960	32320	now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
32320	35760	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35760	40920	where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number
40920	45240	818 for this May the 3rd of 2020.
45240	50220	My name is Rob Roberts and I am all alone here in Studio N7 because like many folks
50220	54080	in the world, we're doing the social distance thing right now so I'm here to talk about
54080	59760	video games and on Discord are my pals DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
59760	61720	I'm emotionally distant.
61720	66920	Emotionally distant, well glad you're able to get close enough to do the show tonight
66920	67920	with us.
67920	71440	How's your week been?
71440	82080	It's been, I'm back at work, mostly able to finish a day so not too bad, I got a rotation
82080	89240	that will hopefully lead to a full promotion so I start training on tomorrow and I'm nervous
89240	92040	sighted about it.
92040	95400	It's progress at least, glad to hear that things have been improving since I know you
95400	98720	were really sick and congratulations once again on the promotion.
98720	101560	I think we talked a little bit about that last week but congrats again.
101560	102560	All the same.
102560	103560	Thanks.
103560	107360	Hey, I know one thing I wanted to ask you about was, because you talked about it weeks
107360	111720	ago on the show, your apocalypse garden that you've decided to start amongst this whole
111760	116680	thing because I have to admit, I don't know if it's Animal Crossing or what, but all of
116680	121800	a sudden I've been like, I need to try to grow more flowers and all this stuff and I'm
121800	123400	just like, ooh, gardening.
123400	126220	So how's that going for you?
126220	127680	It's going pretty well.
127680	133980	Of course, some of my seedlings died, my tomatoes all died because I need a shadier place to
133980	134980	put them in.
134980	137720	Oh, I hit the wrong button.
137720	141360	Anyway, I have a spinach that survived.
141520	145440	I have two rainbow carrots that survived.
145440	148960	I have four cucumbers.
148960	152780	One of them isn't doing so well.
152780	156460	I have some chives.
156460	159080	I have my shiso finally died.
159080	161280	I feel bad about it because it was delicious.
161280	170520	And actually, I have basil that's now potted and I would gladly leave one or two on your
170560	171560	doorstep.
171560	174560	Oh, that's a long trip, though, for that.
174560	176560	No, we'll see.
176560	180760	Quickly, just going to our chat room, because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night
180760	184240	at the voice geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network.
184240	187600	We're on live Sundays at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby
187600	189120	Black Wolf show.
189120	191380	And fifth dream today in our chat is saying, I'm like, what?
191380	192840	There aren't tomatoes in Animal Crossing.
192840	196740	No, believe it or not, we're talking about like real gardening, because what's interesting
196740	201220	how sometimes it may take a video game to kind of make you think about, oh, I should
201220	202700	like do this IRL.
202700	206540	And I'm not saying necessarily dark soccer was inspired by well, I shouldn't speak for
206540	207540	you.
207540	209980	Were you inspired in part by Animal Crossing for gardening?
209980	211100	Really?
211100	216220	I had wanted to try my hand at vegetables and I've grown tomatoes and cucumbers before.
216220	219100	And Dan was kind of on a pickle kick for a little bit.
219100	225620	So I decided just to start growing things I had already ordered the seeds before Animal
225620	227740	Crossing was out.
227740	233980	And I had I actually had them in the sprouting container.
233980	238700	I want to say like, I put them in to sprout them like a day before Animal Crossing came
238700	240260	out.
240260	243900	And Bobby Black Wolf is going to take that back before that it was well before that Bobby
243900	247100	Black Wolf is reminding us that the tomato update is next month in Animal Crossing.
247100	252420	Well, I mean, if leaks are to be believed, which leaks so far here, right, but a bump
252420	258140	pun, if the leaks are to be believed, we will be getting vegetables in Animal Crossing.
258140	260380	We don't know when we're waiting for Nintendo to confirm it.
260380	263940	And everything should be considered a rumor until Nintendo confirms it.
263940	266500	But it would seem it would seem likely.
266500	270540	And I think we had a story last week on the show that Animal Crossing has a path for regular
270540	272480	updates for some time.
272480	275200	And it would make a lot of sense for sure for that game.
275200	277460	So why not bring on the vegetables?
277460	279660	The coding hasn't lied so far.
279660	280660	Yeah.
280700	285420	I'm completely correct about Red being on a ship.
285420	288860	Yeah, which isn't something you might be able to guess otherwise, because that was new.
288860	290940	He wasn't on a ship before.
290940	291940	Exactly.
291940	296260	And the little bit of coding about Rover, we saw how that worked out this week.
296260	297260	Mm hmm.
297260	298860	So, so you're saying.
298860	299860	All right.
299860	302780	Well, also joining us, of course, right now via Discord.
302780	304180	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
304180	305180	Hello.
305180	306180	Hi, Loki.
306180	307180	How are you doing?
307180	308180	I'm fine.
308180	309180	Yeah.
309700	310700	Go ahead.
310700	312700	I was going to say, you feel tired.
312700	317700	Oh, you know, like it's it's I've been reading up on this because it's been doing a number.
317700	319980	This whole quarantine thing has been doing a number on me as well.
319980	323340	And I've I've been trying to go out and like be more active and stuff and actually make
323340	325100	sure I'm walking every day and that sort of thing.
325100	328340	But I still like I just I'm so freaking tired.
328340	331500	But there is there is a science to it.
331500	334580	There's reasons why, like, you know, some of the things that your body's kind of going
334580	340700	through is you are in general just kind of not being as active if for some reason just
340700	342220	kind of like makes you tired.
342220	343980	So like, I feel you.
343980	344980	I'm right there.
344980	351820	I take I had I had a day a couple of weeks ago where I took three naps like it.
351820	352820	It's crazy.
352820	353820	Right.
353820	354820	I remember those times.
354820	355820	All right.
355820	356820	Yeah.
356820	357820	That's true.
357820	359860	I don't have kids, but I do have Mr. Smoosh.
359860	363060	And believe me, he will wake you up as well.
363060	366940	Any projects you've been working on in this, you know, quarantine time?
366940	368500	No, not really.
368500	369500	Yeah.
369500	370500	Yeah.
370500	373140	I didn't really work on my game this week too much.
373140	376940	Just by the time I get, you know, after that day, like working and everything, it's just
376940	377940	like I'm just drained.
377940	381020	I can't concentrate enough to like actually do programing and stuff.
381020	387020	And normally I would leave that to like one of the weekends, weekend days, I guess.
387020	392100	So I had done everything that I normally would spread out across two days yesterday.
392140	396060	And I was hoping to get that done today, but then it just didn't happen because I ended
396060	399820	up having to help me some with his like school project.
399820	404940	And then I cooked meatball subs.
404940	407420	So I had to make garlic bread and stuff like that.
407420	408900	So I don't know.
408900	409900	OK.
409900	412380	So Chef Loki is still a thing because it's actually being asked in chat.
412380	416820	Gripper 02 in chat is asking, so is Loki making his own pizzas now?
416820	419700	But, you know, cooking with Loki is still a thing.
419700	425620	I could, but like I just haven't been doing anything like that.
425620	430180	We ordered out this week a little bit, so we did that a few times.
430180	435660	But no, I haven't been able to make pizzas, but I've been like cooking a lot of things
435660	437100	like a few things each week.
437100	438100	Yeah.
438100	439100	Yeah.
439100	441860	We have to eat out here and there too, just to kind of break the monotony of cooking at
441860	442860	home.
442860	444900	And it's a fine line to get.
444900	447840	Like we have to do like a little bit of everything because I'm kind of like it's so much cheaper
447840	449580	if you just go to the restaurant and pick it up.
449580	452540	But then it's like, well, you still want to be able to help the drivers that are trying
452540	453540	to get by.
453540	455980	But those companies take such a huge share.
455980	457820	So it's like, what's the you know.
457820	461660	So we just we tried to do a little bit of everything, but not too much of one thing.
461660	463500	I think that's all you can do.
463500	464500	Exactly.
464500	465500	All right.
465500	466500	Let's see.
466500	471500	S2100 Matt says Loki is not at the stage where he is rolling white bread into stick form
471500	474100	and dipping it in spaghetti sauce to make breadsticks.
474100	475260	No, we're not there yet.
475260	478140	I mean, the pizza place you always go to isn't closed.
478700	479700	So you can still go there.
479700	480700	No, it's not.
480700	483620	And they keep bugging me every single day that they want me to order something.
483620	488740	I'm like, no, no, I'm not going to do that every day.
488740	493340	Some places are opening up all of a sudden, like some places during, you know, when the
493340	501000	shutdowns all started, not every restaurant necessarily opened for for takeout and delivery.
501000	504940	Some just stayed closed, but just on May 1st, some have been opening back up.
504940	509580	For example, you know, I don't want to I don't want to give him a free ad, but we ordered
509580	520980	from an ancient pasta factory that had stopped that they weren't open for the last month
520980	521980	or so.
521980	525020	But they just started again, I guess, on on May 1st.
525020	526380	And there's a more local chain.
526380	528780	I'll shout them out because they're local, the Moss Taco Bar.
528780	530940	They just started again on May 1st.
530940	535580	So it's it's interesting how some places kind of have just had to accept, like, you know,
535580	537300	maybe they were going to be able to be closed for a month.
537300	541260	But now it's like, oh, we we kind of have to do this for a little bit or whatever.
541260	543140	We had new stores even opening up over here.
543140	545780	So like we just got a five guys down the street.
545780	548280	So that's another option.
548280	553340	And there's a gym boys opening up over there, too, right next door.
553340	558160	So I was like almost went over there today, but then I made the garlic bread stuff.
558160	560340	So I didn't end up doing that.
560740	562740	And Bobby Blackwell says people got rent to pay.
562740	567180	Yeah, that's true. I mean, some people may not have foreseen this lasting as long as
567180	568180	it has.
568180	571860	And, you know, it's well, I keep saying it's going to go on longer.
571860	576900	But, you know, if you've listened to the whole, like, staged reopening thing, restaurants,
576900	580380	I believe in one of the recent governor because we're all in California, so one of the recent
580380	581380	governor knew some updates.
581380	585540	He said restaurants in some form should be a few days away, although it'll be, you know,
585540	586540	reduced occupancy.
586740	591260	And, you know, our work has already said, like, basically, even if if they were to lift
591260	596100	the restrictions tomorrow when this was on Friday, so they're going to lift the restrictions
596100	597100	tomorrow.
597100	601460	We wouldn't go back to work until the very earliest the end of June.
601460	604820	So right now it's looking like at least the end of June.
604820	605820	Yeah.
605820	606820	We're probably much later.
606820	610260	My work has been asking people if they were ready to go back and fully accepting if they
610260	611260	said no.
611260	612260	Yeah.
612260	617220	My work has basically said we're not going to mandate anyone goes back until there's
617220	619300	a cure or a vaccine.
619300	623260	So I mean, knock on plastic is what I have here in the studio.
623260	624260	We're all very fortunate.
624260	628340	I know a lot of people out there, you know, do not have as flexible work scenario.
628340	632160	So believe me, I know I'm very, very lucky in this whole scenario.
632160	634980	And that's why I'm trying to support every little thing.
634980	638820	I get a little driver over here, arrest a local restaurant over here and so forth.
638820	644340	But you know, just staying home at the end of the day is the most important thing.
644340	646340	Because we do live in the capital of California.
646340	649100	I'm sure you've seen what's been going on downtown in the news.
649100	651740	I want no shape or part of that.
651740	656180	So I am going to stay right here in my nice little part of suburbia where I am.
656180	658380	And I think that's the best we can do for right now.
658380	659380	All right.
659380	663520	Anyway, obviously, one thing we do when we're inside is we play a lot of video games.
663520	667500	And so of course, here on this program, we sit and talk about video games for a few hours
667500	672660	every week with all of you guys in our chat room who care to join us live Sunday nights
672660	674580	at the Voice of Geeks network.
674580	680080	But of course, our show is free in an audio only podcast forum as well as our podcast
680080	681080	has existed.
681080	684660	You know, the audio show has existed for like 18 years now, just about.
684660	687300	So we don't plan on that going away anytime soon.
687300	691300	If you want to participate that way, send us feedback throughout the week either at
691300	692300	vog network.com.
692300	694580	You can leave comments on prior episodes.
694580	698160	You can always email us participate at orange launch radio.com.
698160	701660	Or you can send us a tweet at OLR many different ways to interact with us throughout the week,
701660	705660	even if you aren't able to make it here live on Sunday night, because I know even with
705660	708620	people locked down at home, but there's still a lot of other Yeah, there's other things
708620	710580	you might have a regular zoom call that you're doing.
710580	714100	Maybe you got a usual meeting or a church thing you used to do on Sundays.
714100	715300	Now that's kind of virtual.
715300	717620	So I know you can't always be here live.
717620	720540	Although I have heard now some people and this has kind of been happening to me too.
720540	725840	Some people are falling way behind on their podcasts, because commuting was a place that
725840	730540	they and that was me like I used to listen to the podcast I would listen to when I would
730540	731580	commute to work.
731580	733460	And now that's kind of like not a thing.
733460	739300	So I've fallen behind a little bit, although I've, I try to listen to some while I play
739300	740300	MMOs.
740300	745100	I will do like crafting gathering in an MMO, which is very mindless and listen to podcasts.
745100	749660	So you know, if you're able to join us great, if not, I understand these are crazy times
749660	750660	right now.
750660	752420	But we're gonna talk about the news with you guys.
752420	755340	We are not here to report the news.
755340	760460	Because I think you guys, you know, if you're, if you're perceptive enough to find a gaming
760460	764500	podcast, you probably already have your finger on the pulse of games a little bit.
764500	766260	But we're here to talk about it.
766260	770500	I'm giving this longer spiel because it's been a few months since I've introduced OLR.
770500	775200	So just to remind people, this show was formed.
775200	779300	Because the three of us, we all met playing a little arcade game called Dance Dance Revolution
779300	780520	at the arcade.
780520	784180	And we used to go to a local restaurant and eat dinner.
784180	787260	We would eat very healthy mozzarella sticks, but it's okay because we burn off the calories
787260	788560	playing DDR.
788560	792220	And then we would just talk smack, but like in a good way, not always like a negative
792220	797020	way, about our constructive way, about one of our favorite hobbies, which is video games.
797020	798760	And so we kind of took that to the virtual world.
798760	800700	So welcome to our dinner table.
800700	802540	I'm sorry, I'm out of food.
802540	807340	Anyhow, let's get into our kickoff topic for tonight, which has to do with a big upcoming
807340	808340	video game.
808380	812020	I don't know if you want to take this one, Loki, but there's been a lot of news on this
812020	813020	game this week.
813020	814020	That's for sure.
814020	815020	Yeah.
815020	821420	So there's, of course, there's large big name games coming out, especially those from Sony,
821420	826060	which we've seen for a few E3s now, and we've been patiently waiting for them to actually
826060	827300	release it.
827300	834060	And unfortunately, because of things being the way they are, people just can't leave
834060	837560	spoilers out there or can't leave them to themselves.
837560	846160	So of course, allegedly, someone hacked Sony possibly to get some information about The
846160	852080	Last of Us 2 and have leaked that information out onto the Internet.
852080	855320	So it is widely out there now.
855320	861420	Thankfully, it seems to be that the people that are responsible for it are not affiliated
861420	864720	with Naughty Dog or Sony Interactive Entertainment.
864880	870240	However, they have an ongoing investigation to figure out what's going on with it, but
870240	871680	they do know who did it.
873560	875080	So that's kind of interesting.
875080	878040	And Bobby's clarifying in our chat that it was not a hack.
878040	880560	It was an NDA being broken by an outsourced company.
880560	886760	And to be fair on this whole situation, the narrative behind it has been changing a lot
886760	888200	as the week's been going on.
888200	890480	And I think social media is probably playing into that a little bit.
890480	893880	And you got the game of telephone going on because I know when this originally hit, it
893920	901960	was scorned Naughty Dog employee due to the conditions at Naughty Dog, which is a fair
901960	903760	issue and a separate issue.
903760	908600	I'll just say that. But it leaked this whole thing to get back at their employer and all
908600	913200	this stuff. And so the narrative has really been shifting as the week has been going on.
913200	918520	But it sounds like now it's this whole, well, it didn't happen from within Sony and it
918520	922320	didn't happen from within Naughty Dog, but it was definitely obviously it was somebody
922320	923320	they were working with.
924040	928680	Because like what I saw online, I mean, just recently there was another article posted
928680	934080	about how someone had gotten access to the Amazon cloud servers, I guess, Amazon servers
934080	941160	for Naughty Dog Games, which had development code for Uncharted 3, The Last of Us and
941160	943880	access to servers for multiplayer functionality.
943880	949520	And apparently they were able to use that to fetch files from The Last of Us 2.
950000	956760	So I don't know, maybe that was part of it, but whatever the case may be, we don't need
956760	959760	to know how it happened, but it just has happened.
959760	964280	And so, you know, that does suck that that's out there, especially for those folks who
964280	965680	are really interested in playing the game.
965680	972400	I haven't played The Last of Us, so I mean, it'd be unfortunate if I found out spoilers,
972400	974640	but like I wouldn't have any context to it.
975040	981440	Yeah, I did see the spoilers because I made, and I will not say them here, that would be
981440	987000	a dick thing to do, but I made the mistake of going to Twitter and looking at the replies
987000	987920	to one of the threads.
987920	992000	And of course, you know, people are in there and they're shouting out the spoilers because
992000	995840	some people are just the worst, trademark, at Twitter.
996640	1000840	Although I did notice, I mean, it wasn't happening instantly, but I did notice that Naughty
1000840	1004600	Dog and Sony were using that new Twitter functionality, which I didn't even, I kind
1004600	1007360	of forgot it was a thing because I never saw it being used, but they were using that new
1007360	1010400	functionality where you can hide certain replies.
1010400	1014040	So they were using it to suppress some of the people that were posting spoilers, but
1014040	1018040	you know, tweets fly so fast that so many people were posting them.
1018040	1020120	And you know how shitty people are.
1020120	1023860	Like unfortunately, there are shitty people out there that were just searching for anybody
1023860	1029000	talking about The Last of Us on Twitter and would just reply saying, hey, bet you can't
1029000	1032400	wait for a blah, blah, blah, blah, you know, and that whole thing.
1032400	1036120	So I mean, it's, it's, it's shitty.
1036120	1042480	I would hope now, like Loki, I don't play the, I never got really invested in that series.
1042480	1044560	I know people do.
1044560	1048680	I would hope that even if I were to see the ultimate spoiler, you know, even if I were
1048680	1053960	to see Darth Vader is Luke's father, which, okay, I know you're all going to go, oh my
1053960	1054960	God.
1054960	1055960	1977?
1055960	1056960	I know, I know.
1056960	1060120	I know you all are going to feign shock, but give me a break.
1060120	1061120	Okay.
1061120	1062120	The movie is how old?
1062120	1063440	May the fourth is tomorrow.
1063440	1066960	If y'all didn't know, y'all didn't, y'all were never going to care.
1066960	1071440	So is that, but anyway, if, if, um, now where was I going with all that?
1071440	1072440	Oh yeah.
1072440	1076480	Even if you know that like Darth Vader is Luke's father, well, I think, okay, many kids
1076480	1079440	have grown up just knowing that as a way of life, right?
1079440	1083940	That yes, Darth Vader is Luke, Luke's father, but that doesn't ruin Star Wars.
1083940	1087100	Like you can still enjoy at least the first three movies.
1087100	1092160	I realize people may have varying opinions on the movies after that, but I think in general,
1092160	1096340	most people at least enjoy some people straight up fan boy.
1096340	1098220	Some people are like, it's all right.
1098220	1100460	You know, everybody's got their varying opinions.
1100460	1101460	Fine.
1101460	1106060	But I think for the most nowadays, the equivalent of that would be like Ray's lineage, I guess,
1106060	1110460	since you know, everybody knows who, uh, what Luke's lineage is.
1110460	1113740	Well, actually, actually I never saw the later movies, so don't spoil that one.
1113740	1114740	Right.
1114740	1115740	I remember his name.
1115740	1116740	Yeah.
1116740	1122220	But although that was a very forced twist and it was, here's the thing, here's the thing.
1122220	1126060	Even it was force.
1126060	1127060	I'm sorry.
1127060	1129320	Am I hosting with dark Sakura or the 23rd Magus?
1129320	1133580	Who is this on the line right now?
1133580	1134580	Old OLR joke.
1134580	1135580	Old OLR joke.
1135580	1136580	Okay.
1136580	1138100	So, um, I wasn't gonna say, Oh yes.
1138100	1142900	Even if, even if I did have it spoiled, whatever those movies still ought to be good.
1143340	1145420	While you still know that, right?
1145420	1147980	Like you can still watch those movies and relatively enjoy them, even though you know
1147980	1149300	the big spoiler at the end.
1149300	1150300	Right.
1150300	1154220	So I would hope, and I'm not forgiving the spoilers.
1154220	1155220	Don't get me wrong.
1155220	1159060	If you're out there and I doubt anybody listening to this show is one of those people, but who
1159060	1163180	knows who stumbles upon us randomly on Twitter or Twitch.
1163180	1168140	If you're one of those people that's out there, like randomly posting spoilers, I'm not excusing
1168140	1169140	you.
1169140	1170900	You're a Dick like straight up.
1170900	1176860	But, um, I, I would think that the experience can still be a good one for people.
1176860	1181740	I hope people don't get too, too distraught if they have been spoiled and who knows, you
1181740	1188020	know, um, they're now trying to say pre-release maybe something, maybe delays happen because
1188020	1189020	there was a change.
1189020	1192880	I mean, I think they're trying to maybe, you know, missed people a little bit with what's
1192880	1198140	going on, but there could be a change or could be something that happens, who knows?
1198140	1201580	So, um, the game should still be enjoyable, I would think.
1201580	1205860	So I'm hoping if you did get accidentally spoiled on Twitter or whatever, that it doesn't
1205860	1207540	ruin the whole damn thing for you.
1207540	1212620	Don't, don't let those people have that kind of power over you, I guess.
1212620	1220380	So let's see, um, I'm looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
1220380	1225220	Bobby says, my friend was so excited to show star Wars to his six year old son and the
1225220	1228540	kid was like, Oh, he's Luke's father because he heard it at school.
1228540	1235180	My friend was crushed because he was excited to see the reaction, ah, other kids, man,
1235180	1236180	other people's kids.
1236180	1237180	All right.
1237180	1238180	What can you do?
1238180	1239180	Um, let's see.
1239180	1241140	I know what I can do.
1241140	1246900	What's that have any not have, Oh, not, not, I don't contribute to the other people's kids
1246900	1247900	when I'm the other people.
1247900	1248900	There you go.
1248900	1249900	There you go.
1249900	1250900	Um, let's see.
1250900	1256940	I would, I would rather be that crazy uncle, uh, that shows the kid, the movie that his
1256940	1263220	parents don't want him to see my uncle, he took me to see poltergeist when I was little
1263220	1269820	hope, hopefully melody is not watching, but I will tell you what, why, by the way, happy
1269820	1270820	birthday Charlotte.
1270820	1272860	Cause her birthday was just like yesterday.
1272860	1279260	Um, but when that child is older, I probably will take her to her first star rated movie,
1279300	1280300	but hopefully melody.
1280300	1281300	Didn't hear that.
1281300	1282300	All right.
1282300	1283300	Anyway.
1283300	1284300	Yeah.
1284300	1285300	That's and that's, that's the life for me.
1285300	1286300	So anyway.
1286300	1289300	Uh, last of us to those spoilers suck, but the game is still coming out, right?
1289300	1291300	And you know, I'm sure it'll still sell very well.
1291300	1292300	Right?
1294300	1295300	Loki.
1295300	1297300	I would assume so.
1297300	1299300	I would assume so as well.
1299300	1303340	Um, so what do you think is ultimately going to happen with this?
1303340	1308140	Cause I th I think the obvious answer is that a huge lawsuit is going to happen.
1308140	1312420	We're going to see, I mean, it's funny cause when Bobby was covering this topic on his
1312420	1314540	show, some people were saying, are they going to go to jail?
1314540	1319460	You know, which I understand not everybody necessarily, you know, gamer jail, gamer jail.
1319460	1323340	It's going to get tricky because well, their careers are going to go to jail.
1323340	1325740	That's how it was, how it was leaked out.
1325740	1330340	If it was a violation of an NDA, then they might get fired from the company that they
1330340	1333020	worked for might have some sort of repercussions there.
1333020	1338300	If it was God, you know, from like hacking or something like that, then there's the whole
1338300	1340340	cyber intrusion stuff.
1340340	1344460	I think no matter, I think no matter what, you're going to see a lawsuit come of this
1344460	1346580	because I'm assuming an NDA was broken.
1346580	1352020	Let's go, let's go with the whole, um, eighth of a vendor that was working maybe for localization
1352020	1356700	or QA or something in another country, uh, was the one that ultimately leaked this.
1356700	1357700	Let's say it was that.
1357700	1362100	Um, then I think yours for certainly going to see a breach of contract lawsuit and I
1362100	1365940	think you're going to see one so big that it's probably going to shut down whatever
1365940	1369980	company it was because no, no, nobody else is going to want to work with that company
1369980	1370980	in the future.
1370980	1376220	And it kind of sucks like how much one person's actions have like screwed other people.
1376220	1379020	Um, and I think you're certainly going to see a huge lawsuit come of that.
1379020	1383380	But the interesting thing is, let's say it is this foreign issue where the companies
1383380	1387500	in Germany or what have you, and you know, the, uh, nod dog is in the States.
1387500	1390900	Then you're going to have that whole like weird international law stuff come into play,
1390900	1392380	which is a whole other mess.
1392380	1393380	Right.
1393380	1397940	So I don't know what happens in that case because I don't know if we've had a lot of
1397940	1399980	precedent for that type of thing.
1399980	1402980	Um, it's still a universal thing.
1402980	1403980	It is.
1403980	1405940	I mean, and they could sue them in a German court, I guess ultimately, I guess it would
1405940	1408860	depend on where that contract was executed.
1408860	1409860	Ultimately.
1409860	1414400	Um, I would think that even if it's a German country, it probably has hold or it has some
1414400	1417860	type of presence in the U S but you know, again, I don't, I don't really know and I'm
1417860	1419420	not going to pretend to know that stuff.
1419420	1420660	I just think it's for sure.
1420660	1423900	We're going to see a lawsuit and I don't know if we've seen something like that in the gaming
1423900	1424900	industry before.
1424900	1429740	I'm trying to think if we've ever had, like, I think we've had threats of it and I can't
1429740	1430900	think of a time.
1430900	1432380	Maybe this is where I need chats help.
1432380	1435960	I can't think of a time where one of these like breach of contract issues actually went
1435960	1440460	to court, but I think we're going to see it here and this is going to be a very interesting
1440460	1442820	new ish kind of thing.
1442820	1448820	So um, see a Tiberian chat says if someone from top chef breaks the law, would they go
1448820	1449820	to jail?
1449820	1450820	Simmons?
1450820	1454820	Um, you know, uh, speaking of reality shows though, there was, you know, you guys all
1454820	1459900	know I, I enjoy survivor and those types of shows and uh, it's kind of like a known fact
1459900	1467480	that, uh, well, you know, fat fact in quotes, allegedly protect myself here, allegedly a
1467480	1473260	former contestant, uh, who was kind of a no notorious villain on the show who got to the
1473260	1477900	finals twice and still never won, uh, and who continues to bully Sandra D S twine on
1477900	1482540	Twitter to this day, uh, because he's so butthurt about it, uh, apparently spoiled like three
1482540	1488020	seasons of the show, uh, and has yet to really face any repercussions from it.
1488020	1493380	Um, even though in those reality show contracts, if you break the survivor contract, you're
1493380	1495660	on the hook for like $5 million or something like that.
1495660	1496660	It's a lot of money.
1496660	1501080	You know, those shows are not cheap to produce and you know, spoilers can ruin everything.
1501080	1505700	So anyway, um, I'll be seeing that this is for Mark and Boone.
1505700	1506700	They were robbed.
1506700	1507700	Yeah.
1507700	1508700	Speaking of reality shows.
1508700	1509700	Yeah.
1509700	1510940	People very invested in Lego masters in these times.
1510940	1511940	Yes, yes, yes.
1511940	1516460	I've watched actually talking about catching up on, uh, uh, podcasting and stuff like that.
1516460	1522780	I've been watching a lot of the, uh, different, uh, behind the brick in like different podcasts
1522780	1525340	and YouTube shows with, uh, Mark and Boone and stuff.
1525340	1529300	And actually funny enough, uh, Mark and Boone, uh, I think it was Boone actually.
1529300	1534680	He does a YouTube show about Legos and I mean, a lot of these guys that are on the show have
1534680	1535680	their own YouTube stuff.
1536120	1537120	They're all like really cool with it.
1537120	1541360	I mean, like as far as who won and stuff, I think a lot of it, they said that the judging
1541360	1542360	was fair.
1542360	1546840	Um, that I think a lot of it is just how they kind of cut and edit the show.
1546840	1554760	Um, because like, I know one of the guys, um, Oh God, it was, uh, the guy, the one of
1554760	1560240	the finalists with Amy or, uh, I can't remember them, but there's one dude that like, I would
1560240	1565920	annoy the hell out of me at first and like, I hated him and then like it got better throughout
1565920	1566920	the rest of the show.
1566920	1570320	And then you see like after the fact and it's like, okay, yeah, he's pretty cool.
1570320	1574360	Um, but the way that they kind of edit it and in a way that made it look like he was
1574360	1576120	just like a complete douchebag.
1576120	1578120	So I don't know.
1578120	1581400	It's creative editing, the manufactured drama.
1581400	1586960	Um, you know, and, and, and this is an important lesson about reality TV, which I'm not sure
1586960	1589840	if this really directly ties to games, but we'll talk about it anyway.
1589840	1593520	Um, and this is especially true on drag race.
1593520	1594520	Whoops.
1594520	1595520	I'm sorry.
1595520	1597840	I'm bringing up drag race at the top of the show, but it's important because I bet the
1597840	1602080	same thing will apply to Lego masters or any of your favorite reality TV shows.
1602080	1607800	Um, winning American idol being another huge one, winning doesn't necessarily mean winning.
1607800	1608800	Okay.
1608800	1610520	It's not whether you win or lose.
1610520	1614080	It's what you do with the opportunity that's been presented to you.
1614080	1618760	Uh, if you want to go to drag race, ask Tyra Sanchez who won season two, what she's doing
1618760	1619760	these days.
1619760	1624920	And then look at some of her peers like Raven, uh, Juju B Pandora box and where they're at,
1624920	1627040	uh, or season seven is another great example.
1627040	1628040	Look at Violet Chachki.
1628040	1629040	Although don't get me wrong.
1629040	1632400	Violet Chachki is actually really cool and I love her looks, but where you look at where
1632400	1637760	her needle is at versus Trixie Mattel and Katya who are also on that season and where
1637760	1639560	their needles are at.
1639560	1645320	For the record, um, Violet Chachki is doing a lot of work with, um, uh, the actual fashion
1645320	1652400	world, uh, working as a model and doing, uh, uh, a lot of, uh, design work.
1652400	1653400	Totally get that.
1653400	1656400	But, and I'm not trying to shade her and I'm sorry if it made it, if I made it sound like
1656400	1661280	I'm putting her on the same level as Tyra, however, if I were to compare her bank account
1661280	1664720	to Trixie and Katya, she's doing very well.
1664720	1667280	She's doing well, but is she doing as good as Trixie and Katya?
1667280	1670840	Yeah, actually I highly doubt that, but I guess we'll never know.
1670840	1673760	I think, uh, you might be a little contrarian there, but that's all right.
1674200	1677360	No, no, I've actually been, been following her for some time.
1677360	1678360	She's actually doing quite well.
1678360	1679880	I'm doing some work for Gotye.
1679880	1680880	Okay.
1680880	1684200	I'd be, I'd be curious about her YouTube views next to Trixie and Katya and what they do,
1684200	1685200	but yeah, it's all right.
1685200	1687680	Well, YouTube isn't a measure of fame and success.
1687680	1691840	Well, um, yeah, of course there's those, uh, concerts and the ticket sales and so forth.
1691840	1696080	Um, but you know, it's a different, it's a different path that, uh, they're walking.
1696080	1697080	That's for sure.
1697080	1698480	Um, or American Idol.
1698480	1703360	Uh, I think, uh, again, a huge example from that would be, um, Oh my God, why can't I
1703360	1704360	hear me?
1704360	1706360	Just, uh, Hudson, Jennifer Hudson.
1706360	1709360	Uh, and she won a freaking Oscar.
1709360	1711200	Uh, she didn't win that show.
1711200	1713780	Uh, and who won her season quick?
1713780	1714780	Who won the season?
1714780	1720280	Jennifer Hudson was on, it was Fantasia Fantasia did Fantasia did okay.
1720280	1723360	Uh, and you know, she, well, I shouldn't say, okay, she did very well, but she didn't win
1723360	1725000	an Oscar like Jennifer Hudson did.
1725000	1731660	So again, it doesn't matter like what you like do with the win.
1731660	1733720	It's what you do with the exposure.
1733720	1735100	And some winners do very well.
1735100	1741000	Look at Kelly Clarkson, look at, um, Carrie Underwood, you know, some winners sometimes
1741000	1750100	do very well anyway, but back to back to the subject at hand about the last of us to hopefully
1750100	1755140	all these spoilers and these things do not cut into sales tremendously.
1755140	1758500	Uh, that would be a very, very, very sad thing.
1758500	1760780	Um, and I, I don't think that'll happen.
1760780	1763900	I think there's enough fans of the last of us where this is still going to sell very
1763900	1764900	well.
1764900	1771200	Uh, we'll have to see how the like COVID and all that situation kind of plays into it.
1771200	1775220	But seeing as it's boosted, um, which is as much as the situation sucks, it's boosted
1775220	1780660	things like animal crossing and it's boosted things like, um, Final Fantasy seven remake
1780660	1784000	and some of those figures we talked about last week, the last of us to only stands to
1784000	1785740	do pretty well.
1785740	1786980	All right.
1786980	1792300	So let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we
1792300	1794540	have been playing this week.
1794540	1796260	And we'll start with, okay.
1796260	1798100	So it looks like dark soccer stepped away for a second.
1798100	1800500	So actually, uh, Loki, I'm going to start with you.
1800500	1801780	All right.
1801780	1804660	So, um, I didn't play a whole ton of things this week.
1804660	1806340	Uh, well actually maybe we did.
1806340	1811200	So I played a little bit of, uh, earth defense force, iron rain again.
1811200	1812200	So I've been playing through that.
1812200	1814900	I think I'm a little bit more than halfway through that now.
1814900	1820220	Um, I picked up a few games on the steam well, it's not really a sale, but they had like
1820220	1825740	stuff marked down, um, so I've been playing guts and glory.
1825740	1831700	And if you're not familiar with guts and glory, guts and glory is like a 3d version of, uh,
1831700	1832980	happy wheels.
1832980	1841220	So it's an incredibly violent, um, physics based kind of obstacle course vehicle game.
1841220	1845140	And uh, so I, and it's, it's pretty violent.
1845140	1847820	Um, so, uh, that's been fun.
1847820	1852660	And then of course, uh, when playing a little bit of step mania as well, um, even more songs
1852660	1858320	on the cabin actually started building my own songs, but it's been so long since I've
1858320	1863360	used the step mania, like, uh, editor to actually make stuff that I'm so kind of ran
1863360	1866720	into a little bit of a learning curve with it, just trying to get songs synced up and
1866720	1867720	everything correctly.
1867720	1872200	Cause I was trying to get it like extremely like perfect right on.
1872200	1877580	But then again, you know, I don't, I'm not exactly going to be scoring any triple A's
1877580	1878580	on anything.
1878580	1882080	So I don't know how well I can sync stuff up, but I'm gonna just do my best on that.
1882080	1887040	Um, so I have a few songs picked out for that and been working on, um, you know, that sort
1887040	1889040	of thing.
1889040	1896320	And uh, that's, uh, Orna, lots of Orna, um, still playing that and almost, I don't know.
1896320	1898960	I think I'm almost to 170 now on that.
1898960	1905600	Um, so just try and make it up to 175 so I can get some, uh, Oh no, still 169.
1905600	1908440	Are you holding onto a ton of orange to unlock a new class at 175?
1908440	1913400	I'm still trying to get the class at 150, even though my character's like 164, 165.
1913400	1918680	I'm uh, I've only got like 746,000 orange right now.
1918680	1923120	So I don't have enough to like even close to getting the next class cause I think it's
1923120	1926240	at 2 million, but I don't know.
1926240	1927240	I don't really care.
1927240	1929160	I mean the next class doesn't look all that great anyways.
1929160	1932720	There's just more attack power and more HP I guess.
1932720	1934520	That stuff goes a long way though.
1934520	1937840	Like my God, when I finally upped from a, what was it, sword master or whatever it was
1937840	1938840	to druid.
1938840	1942240	No, the other way around druid to like sort of whatever, whatever the hell I am now.
1942280	1945880	Uh, it's, it was a huge, like I'm actually able to take things out now.
1945880	1947880	Like I was really struggling before.
1947880	1951880	I've got my, my brand new bad ass weapon that I'm leveling up.
1951880	1958400	So my current weapon that I was using is like an attack of like 550 or something like that.
1958400	1961120	And the new one is like 700 something.
1961120	1966480	So I mean, just that alone is like way more than the class as it is.
1966480	1970040	Um, although damage wise, it doesn't really seem to make much of a difference, which is
1970040	1971040	kind of funny.
1971160	1974920	Um, so I just have to wait for that to be done.
1974920	1978960	It's up, well it's been leveled up to level 10 and still got about a day and a half left
1978960	1979960	on that.
1979960	1985200	Um, and then everything else has been kind of being leveled up as it goes.
1985200	1988520	And I don't know, I've been just trying to get as much as I can.
1988520	1993520	I've got like, I've got to start doing more arenas because I have like 500 arena tokens
1993520	1996880	because I buy them every time that they come into the store.
1996880	1998480	Um, so I don't know.
1998520	2002000	I've been just trying to play a lot, doing the daily quests.
2003720	2004720	All right.
2004720	2005720	Is that it for your gaming week?
2005720	2006720	That's it.
2006720	2007720	All right.
2007720	2009680	I will go to my gaming week.
2009680	2012400	So I've been continuing to play Animal Crossing.
2012400	2015240	Of course, a lot, a lot of Animal Crossing.
2015240	2018240	Bummer Jamie had to walk away for a minute cause I'm sure we could geek out about Animal
2018240	2019240	Crossing.
2019240	2020240	We'll do that a little later.
2020240	2024680	I've been working on my gardens, um, uh, in Animal Crossing and trying to set up, I think
2024680	2029960	I only have one more like a flower I really need to work on crossbreeding and growing
2029960	2030960	and all that stuff.
2030960	2032920	Uh, and I'll get around to that at some point.
2032920	2036160	Um, I've actually been trying to work a little more with terraforming.
2036160	2040720	I'm not trying to go too crazy, but like, I didn't want to like redo my island completely
2040720	2041720	or any of that.
2041720	2044840	I'm very much like, I'll just kind of work with what I got, but like I wanted to make
2044840	2048680	one of my cliff areas where my garden is just a little bit bigger.
2048680	2052640	So I like added a couple more squares around the side and I kind of did that whole thing
2052640	2053640	with the terraforming.
2053800	2057240	So I was working with that a little bit and otherwise just, um, you know, just signing
2057240	2062260	in visiting my friends towns to pick up do it yourself patterns or the various visitors
2062260	2064860	that are there and see what's going on and so forth.
2064860	2067520	It's still a fun social game.
2067520	2072000	Um, speaking of social stuff, I'm still playing Final Fantasy 14 even though, you know, it's
2072000	2076200	kind of a lull between patches right now, but just trying to grind out the tomes and
2076200	2079340	make sure I can buy the highest level gear that's available with the tomes that you get
2079340	2080340	every week.
2080340	2081340	So there's that.
2081660	2086220	And then continuing on with things like Orna, we just talked about and Pokemon Go, which
2086220	2089260	just launched the remote rating right and Pokemon Go.
2089260	2091900	So I actually finally got to do one of those remote raids.
2091900	2096900	So in the little chat group, which I haven't been very good at checking in on a lot lately,
2096900	2098820	they were like, oh, we're going to do this park.
2098820	2103660	And it's a park that like, it's it's far enough away where it is on my radar, but it's like
2103660	2104760	so far away.
2104760	2108820	It's like that grayish color that like it's fading into the horizon.
2108820	2110700	It's so far away.
2110740	2114540	So yeah, I'm able to get it barely.
2114540	2115540	So we raided at that gym.
2115540	2119420	And that was kind of nice to just see that whole remote thing in action.
2119420	2123620	And then what we did, we walked over to the park that's like right near me, that has a
2123620	2124620	gym.
2124620	2127420	Alan and I walked over there and we were the only ones there.
2127420	2131140	And there were like 15 accounts in the gym, all fighting.
2131140	2136360	And usually you'd be like, spoofer, boo, spoofer, but obviously it's a very different world
2136360	2137360	we're in now.
2137520	2141280	You have sanctioned spoofing essentially within the game.
2141280	2143360	So that's been kind of interesting.
2143360	2147460	Otherwise, I'm trying to do those Kanto quests that are going on right now and I'm stuck
2147460	2149520	on one of them, which ironically I think is raiding.
2149520	2154800	I just need to wait for like a one star to pop up as a remote raid and do it.
2154800	2159640	And then to finish the location game talk, I spent a little time yesterday with Ingress
2159640	2162200	because they did a virtual event.
2162200	2166680	So, you know, Ingress is very much a game that is played out in the real world.
2166680	2170280	And back in October, I was talking about a live event that happened here in Sacramento
2170280	2175480	that had like 300, 400 people all playing the game downtown and having a good time and
2175480	2176480	all that stuff.
2176480	2179880	Obviously, our world is not built for that right now.
2179880	2183880	They pretty regularly will do these events called First Saturday, where like a small
2183880	2187960	group of maybe 50 people will get together and play the game on the first Saturday of
2187960	2192080	the month, explore a new town, do some missions, just kind of have fun in the sun.
2192080	2195560	Obviously, our current world state doesn't lend well to that model.
2195560	2199940	So they did the first virtual First Saturday this past weekend.
2199940	2200940	And that was kind of neat.
2200940	2202680	It was different.
2202680	2206740	We hung out on a Zoom call and we all recharged portals.
2206740	2212520	But then we did like a group OPR or Niantic Wayfarer, right?
2212520	2215640	So we all went in there and reviewed things together as a group.
2215640	2218920	And that was actually kind of fun to talk about that with people from the other faction
2218920	2221200	to kind of get a sense of where their head is at.
2221200	2224380	And some of the things we agree on and we don't agree on always when it comes to and
2224380	2225380	everybody was cordial.
2225380	2228460	Nobody was like, you're wrong, you know, but we kind of talked about, oh, I don't know
2228460	2229620	if I would view it that way.
2229620	2233300	I might have one starred that because this or whatever it is.
2233300	2235020	So it was nice to be able to talk about that.
2235020	2239620	And it was really funny because some of the same submissions would come up.
2239620	2245660	Like three of us got this submission called Dad's Computer that was showing up.
2245660	2250260	And it was legit, probably a nine year old who took a screenshot of a computer screen
2250260	2253860	on Google and was trying to submit that as a pokey stop.
2253860	2255500	Oh, I forgot to mention.
2255500	2261820	So remember how I had submitted that, like the pokey stop request for like or Ingress,
2261820	2265660	I guess it was back a long time ago for that code Ninja's place.
2265660	2270440	Finally, almost a year later, they finally rejected it.
2270440	2273180	It took a whole year.
2273180	2274180	Can you talk about something for a minute?
2274180	2275580	I need to handle something.
2275580	2276580	Yeah.
2276580	2279580	So it was ridiculous, because I was like, you know, what is going on?
2279580	2283820	And trying to get a response to at least say, OK, is this going to pass or not, which
2283820	2291860	I really should have, but because they gave a mural that was to a yogurt place next kind
2291860	2294900	of across the way, they gave that as a pokey stop.
2294900	2299300	But I thought, you know, let's put a mural in this one and then I can hit it from where
2299300	2300300	I'm sitting.
2300300	2305300	Although, to be fair, I can also hit the yogurt shop as well because it's close enough.
2305300	2306500	But I don't know.
2306500	2312340	I thought I would have made a good pokey stop, but I guess whatever.
2312340	2314940	So that Ingress event was pretty fun.
2314940	2319500	And they actually I didn't realize this, but Niantic rewarded those of us that participated
2319500	2321060	a free upgrade.
2321060	2322660	So one of our portals got upgraded.
2322660	2325400	That's cool, except all my submissions are in Puerto Rico because I submitted them all
2325400	2326700	when I was on the cruise.
2326700	2329480	So you're welcome if you live in Puerto Rico.
2329480	2332180	I added some pokey stops in Old Town.
2332180	2335260	So anyway, what else have I been playing?
2335260	2336620	Oh, a new game.
2336620	2339140	I'll talk quickly about Streets of Rage 4.
2339140	2344960	So I was able to play Streets of Rage 4 because it's on Xbox Game Pass, actually.
2344960	2346620	That was a really pleasant surprise.
2346620	2348660	I guess they probably did announce that.
2348660	2349780	I forgot.
2349780	2352820	I just looked at the Game Pass app on Friday or something.
2352820	2354380	I was like, oh, Streets of Rage 4 is here.
2354380	2355620	I want to check that out.
2355620	2357940	So I did download that and check it out.
2357940	2361660	And as you know, of course, Streets of Rage 1, 2, and 3 were Genesis games.
2361660	2366420	It was an old school beat-em-up like Final Fight or a lot of those games you played at
2366420	2370020	a pizza parlor in the 90s, those beat-em-up hell, the Ninja Turtles game, one of the most
2370020	2372860	popular in that genre of beat-em-ups.
2372860	2379220	And so Streets of Rage, now that we're years and years later on the Xbox One, and I know
2379220	2384420	this is on Nintendo Switch and all the platforms, is really kind of that same formula, except
2384420	2385980	it's not pixelated.
2385980	2389200	It's more hand-drawn, although I believe there's a retro mode in it, but you don't have it
2389200	2390500	right away.
2390500	2394220	The only thing that was weird for me at first is that they actually changed the controls
2394220	2402340	a little bit, but you can go back and change to a different layout if you need to.
2402340	2405600	So I didn't do that.
2405600	2411020	So I played with the default, which is this new one, where they add a button for you to
2411020	2412560	be able to pick things up.
2412560	2414800	So you can actually pick up food and pick up what...
2414800	2418900	So it's a little weird because you don't use the attack button to do that, you use a separate
2418900	2419900	button.
2420300	2421300	So I'm real getting used to it.
2421300	2425860	But again, you can change it back, I just kind of played with what the default was,
2425860	2428060	which was this very weird kind of thing.
2428060	2429780	So yeah.
2429780	2431740	But otherwise, it's fun.
2431740	2432740	The music's...
2432740	2435080	Of course, I was curious what the music would be like.
2435080	2439420	And even though the music is more like the old Streets of Rage game, which is good, Yuzo
2439420	2445740	Koshiro's involved, I like Yuzo Koshiro from the stuff he did with the driving games and
2445740	2448260	Actraiser and some of the other stuff.
2448260	2452080	So the Streets of Rage music, I like enough.
2452080	2456540	This is more like that, obviously, and not his other stuff, which I enjoy a lot more.
2456540	2458100	But it's still fun.
2458100	2461580	And I think if you do have Game Pass, you need to get on this.
2461580	2466220	Otherwise, I think they're asking like 30 bucks for it, which may sound a little steep,
2466220	2471540	but I feel like there's a lot of features that you kind of unlock as you go that are
2471540	2475260	gonna make that price tag a lot easier.
2475260	2478860	And this is one that you can play online, unlike those first three games.
2478860	2482940	So I think that's gonna make it a lot easier for people to be able to like play online
2482940	2485160	with friends, especially in this day and age, right?
2485160	2487680	You can't go over to people's houses to play the game.
2487680	2490800	So playing online is going to end up being a great thing.
2490800	2491800	So yeah.
2491800	2492800	There you go.
2492800	2496740	Yeah, that kind of made me wonder too, because now that you mentioned the whole playing the
2496740	2502580	same room thing, I'm not sure how long this whole COVID thing is going to go on, but that's
2502580	2508740	going to be interesting once the Amico comes out, because they're all local multiplayer
2508740	2509940	for that stuff.
2509940	2510940	For sure.
2510940	2511940	I'm sorry.
2511940	2513940	Give me just another minute here, Loki.
2513940	2514940	Sorry.
2514940	2515940	This is live, folks.
2515940	2517460	What can you do?
2517460	2520620	So yeah, it'd be interesting to see how that's going to affect things.
2520620	2525460	I am hoping by the time that comes out in October that, you know, things will be a little
2525460	2526460	bit calmed down.
2526460	2530280	But you know, that is a kind of a weird scenario.
2530280	2534120	No one could have predicted that when you're going to release a brand new console at the
2534120	2535120	end of the year.
2535120	2537900	So what are you going to do, I guess?
2537900	2539600	So I don't know.
2539600	2540880	It'll be interesting to see.
2540880	2547360	I hopefully will see some more stuff for that, especially with, you know, when E3 was supposed
2547360	2552280	to have been happening in about a month or so away.
2552280	2558400	Surprised to see that we haven't heard too much from like Sony or I know Nintendo's even
2558400	2562640	talked about maybe not doing a digital event, but like even Sony just hearing some more
2562640	2566960	information about what they've got in the pipeline coming out and stuff and I don't
2566960	2567960	know.
2567960	2568960	I just want to know more information.
2568960	2573640	I feel like now with all these companies, you know, obviously E3 not happening and stuff
2573640	2577360	and a lot of these companies say, no, we're not even going to do digital events that it's
2577360	2579640	like, when am I going to find out my information?
2579640	2581640	Okay, I'm back.
2581640	2582640	Sorry.
2582640	2584840	So I'm going to have to address this at some point.
2584840	2586120	Dark soccer had to go.
2586120	2588240	She had a family emergency.
2588240	2591040	Something's come up that's extremely urgent.
2591040	2597120	So she's needed to go sending thoughts and well wishes to her and her family right now
2597120	2598120	for sure.
2598120	2600840	It's not my place to give specifics right now.
2600840	2604640	I will let her do so when she feels up to returning.
2604640	2608680	For now, sorry to be blunt, but it is what it is.
2608680	2609680	It's life.
2609680	2613160	Anyway, Loki, we're going to carry on with the show.
2613160	2615800	You were talking about retro consoles.
2615800	2619560	And that actually reminded me because I have it sitting right here next to me.
2619560	2621900	I ordered this little guy online this week.
2621900	2628960	This Neo Geo Mini is something I picked up because it was on like a super sale on Amazon.
2628960	2629960	Really?
2629960	2630960	Yeah.
2630960	2636000	Is that the one that looks like a little like a desktop cabinet or yes, it's like a tiny
2636000	2638120	it's like those other it's a tiny little cat.
2638120	2639680	It might be hard to see on the tour.
2640560	2645800	It looks like my other little arcade machines that I collect and it's got 40 games in it,
2645800	2649640	including like five different Metal Slug games, King of the Monsters, Magician Lord, King
2649640	2652720	of Fighter, you know, all the stuff you'd expect to see here.
2652720	2655980	I'm sure you'll have a great time seeing that on Twitch, but there's a list of all the games
2655980	2656980	from the back.
2656980	2660680	Why don't they just make like a arcade one up size cabinet for one of those?
2660680	2661680	I'm kind of surprised.
2661680	2662680	That would be awesome.
2662680	2664000	I'm kind of surprised that too.
2664000	2666040	But here's here's the thing that sold me on it.
2666040	2669560	I wasn't necessarily going to get it at first because I was like that cabinet kind of looks
2669560	2671620	like garbage to play on.
2671620	2672880	But here's the thing.
2672880	2675880	It has an HDMI out on it.
2675880	2680520	So you can actually hook this baby up to a TV and play the Neo Geo games that way.
2680520	2682720	I'm not sure if you can hook up a controller.
2682720	2684440	I think that is a thing.
2684440	2687680	I don't want to get quoted on that, though, but I believe I'm going to have to open this
2687680	2688680	up and see.
2688680	2693080	I might have it because I think some of the other minis that they've done, they can you
2693080	2695560	could hook up Neo Geo controllers as well.
2695560	2696560	Yeah.
2696560	2697560	So that's pretty cool.
2697560	2698560	Maybe somebody in chat actually.
2698560	2702120	Adrian today says, yes, they have controllers, so I could actually probably order those separately
2702120	2707500	if I wanted to play the Neo Geo games on the TV.
2707500	2709240	So that's ultimately what sold me on it.
2709240	2712240	I was like, oh, I don't have to play on the tiny little screen.
2712240	2713440	I can actually play on the television.
2713440	2714440	And that's pretty cool.
2714440	2715440	Yeah, it was awesome.
2715440	2721560	Like I said, I when I first got my candy cab, I had a multi cart for a Neo Geo thing for
2721560	2722560	that.
2722560	2725600	But then then I mailed that to Bobby for his super gun.
2725600	2729240	So he has that now.
2729240	2731280	Bobby says, when's the Twitch stream of it?
2731280	2734520	When I get one of those controllers that I'm going to have to buy, because I don't I don't
2734520	2737520	know how I would play with the tiny little thing.
2737520	2741400	I mean, you know, I but I collect these types of things anyway.
2741400	2743480	So like, you know, and for the price, what was it?
2743480	2744480	I think it was only 30 bucks.
2744480	2745480	It was like 20.
2745480	2747160	I think normally it's about 50 and it was down to 30.
2747160	2748640	And I was like, what the heck?
2748640	2749640	That's a good price.
2749640	2753260	So that'll be something I can talk about next week is the Neo Geo mini.
2753260	2754260	So cool.
2754260	2755260	Cool.
2755420	2758580	Well, let's move on and we'll get into this week's news.
2758580	2760420	So, Loki, why don't you start us off?
2760420	2765340	Well, they alluded to talking about other companies announcing their events and that
2765340	2769500	being kind of up in the air as far as we even have like cancellations with Nintendo and
2769500	2770500	stuff like that.
2770500	2774600	But at least there is one that we can count on and it's right around the corner.
2774600	2781540	So coming up later this week on May 7th, we will see Xbox Series X gameplay for the first
2781540	2782540	time.
2782540	2787380	Probably not the first time because we've had some demos, but more of it.
2787380	2790780	That's going to be coming May 7th.
2790780	2798340	They're going to show new gameplay, including a gameplay trailer for Assassin's Creed Valhalla,
2798340	2803940	which they had a cinematic trailer for that earlier this week.
2803940	2807480	So that was something.
2807480	2814280	No idea what other games are going to be out there during that time, but I'm very curious
2814280	2818600	to see what spec, well, they already talked about specs, but more details.
2818600	2822840	I want to know more details about it and just trying to get excited about that kind of stuff.
2822840	2825760	So I'm looking forward to that.
2825760	2826760	That's going to be streaming.
2826760	2831720	It looks like 11 a.m. Eastern time on Thursday.
2831720	2834240	She Hulk 10 in our chat says, hopefully a new fable.
2834240	2835240	I am with you.
2835240	2836240	She Hulk.
2836240	2841240	I was like to see it will be very interesting, though, without the involvement of Molyneux.
2841240	2842800	But I'm OK with that.
2842800	2843800	Let's see.
2843800	2844800	Let's see what else does with it.
2844800	2845800	Don't think I'll be a problem.
2845800	2848080	Yeah, I think at the end of the day, it won't be a huge issue.
2848080	2849080	It'll be interesting.
2849080	2853720	It'll be I'm curious what creative direction the game takes and like what kind of elements
2853720	2855920	it holds on to, like some of the choice things.
2855920	2857160	I'd be very curious about that.
2857160	2858920	I feel like it's going to happen.
2858920	2861520	I feel that the rumbles and the rumors, but we'll see.
2861520	2863560	I don't want to we won't necessarily see it this week.
2863560	2864560	I don't know.
2864560	2868440	Well, it sounds to me because you've got your you know, we've already kind of seen lately
2868440	2873680	with just different games how these, you know, sort of Final Fantasy seven remake.
2873680	2878240	But I mean, obviously the stuff would have been planned long in advance.
2878240	2883120	You know, I really think like having a core RPG game on the platform would be very essential,
2883120	2888180	especially since we're not going to have like an Elder Scrolls six for a long time or a
2888180	2890920	new fallout or something like that.
2890920	2895880	I would think that a fable will do very well for that as well, because you got the Halo
2895880	2899620	to kind of take care of like the action stuff as well in the FPS.
2899620	2902800	So I would I would hope that we'd see that sort of things.
2902800	2907200	I'm just more curious to see what's coming from all these studios that they, you know,
2907200	2912340	picked up a year or so ago to see what they're working on.
2912340	2914280	That's what I'm really interested to see.
2914280	2917340	S.H.A. 100 Matt in chat says, I'm ready to see this damn thing in action.
2917340	2920900	This drip feed is getting a little irritating.
2920900	2926520	And you know, yeah, I feel like this this cycle especially has really been drawn out
2926520	2927520	for a bit.
2927520	2928520	Right.
2928520	2931020	Hasn't it kind of felt like the PlayStation four and the Xbox one have been kind of like
2931020	2934700	lame ducks for a little bit while we're like waiting for the PlayStation five and what's
2934700	2938740	new with Microsoft and everything like yes, I know we've had at least still the Final
2938740	2941380	Fantasy seven remake and we're getting Last of Us two.
2941380	2944500	There are still games from this generation for us to get excited about.
2944500	2948280	But I can't help but feel that because we know backwards compatibility is going to play
2948280	2949280	into this next generation.
2949280	2952200	It's kind of like, OK, well, all these games are putting out they're going to work on the
2952200	2953480	new ones, too.
2953480	2955220	So let's get to that hardware.
2955220	2956220	So it does.
2956220	2959480	It does feel like this lead up, even though it probably honestly has been the same amount
2959480	2961160	of time as has been any other generation.
2961160	2962160	Fine.
2962160	2964720	It just feels like this lead up has been an awful long time.
2964720	2966320	Maybe that's something about the Internet age we live in.
2966320	2967720	I don't know.
2967720	2976200	But on this on the same side, we the first week of May is probably earlier than I think
2976200	2980040	we most of us would have been expecting to hear this information, which I think would
2980040	2981600	have been the first week of June.
2981600	2986000	It's hard to say what they wanted to do a pre event before E3, kind of like what happened
2986000	2990200	with Xbox one, although that didn't go so well for Microsoft that time.
2990200	2991200	You know, I don't know.
2991200	2998080	But this this regardless of why or what this is, this is this is what's going to happen.
2998080	3000920	So we'll get to see this week.
3000920	3002680	Yeah.
3002680	3007400	Gripper O2 says, are there any new games to sway us into buying the new consoles?
3007400	3008960	Well, that's what we're going to find out.
3008960	3013200	Keep in mind, Microsoft has scooped up oodles and oodles of companies over the past couple
3013200	3014200	of years.
3014200	3016340	That's some of the biggest news to come out of Microsoft.
3016340	3020520	So they've really been laying out the pieces and making strategical moves to really come
3020520	3022440	out swinging this generation.
3022440	3027000	So I think Microsoft stands to answer some of those questions on Thursday.
3027000	3028980	Will they show us everything?
3028980	3029980	I doubt it.
3030900	3034020	I would taper your expectations a little bit.
3034020	3039940	We'll probably get one or two new games that'll show off the hardware.
3039940	3046820	My guess, we will absolutely have a sports game of some type, but that will include racing.
3046820	3051740	That could include a Forza, whether it's Horizon or mainline or something new.
3051740	3055620	I would absolutely bet like Forza is somehow one of the games we're going to see.
3055620	3058620	The other game could be literally anything.
3058620	3062900	And I would guess it's really going to be, and one reason why I specifically peg racing
3062900	3067800	and sports, those are the games that really, and especially Forza, and that's why I really
3067800	3069540	think it's going to be Forza, something.
3069540	3070540	Forza is something.
3070540	3077140	And yes, I know it's the right year for Horizon, but I think all bets are off when it comes
3077140	3078780	to the regular schedule of Forza.
3078780	3080620	I think it could be Forza anything.
3080620	3082220	I'd love for it to be Horizon.
3082220	3087260	But racing games are going to really show off the power of the system and things like
3087260	3092620	ray tracing and all the things that these games are going to bring to the tables.
3092620	3097420	That's why I fully expect it'll be a Forza universe type of game that we're going to
3097420	3099420	see this week.
3099420	3102340	Bobby Blackwell says it'll be Forza Motorsport 8.
3102340	3103340	Yeah.
3103340	3109020	And Bobby says all Xbox consoles have released with a racing game outside the first one.
3109020	3110020	And I'll-
3110020	3111020	Oh, yeah.
3111020	3112020	Oh, yeah.
3112020	3113020	What?
3113020	3114020	What?
3114020	3115020	What?
3115020	3116020	Let's see a new bridge racer game.
3116020	3117020	Come on.
3117780	3119500	Maybe on the PlayStation 5 reveal, but we're not there yet.
3119500	3120500	We're not there yet.
3120500	3123820	Come on, they're not console specific anymore.
3123820	3124820	Come on.
3124820	3125820	Come on.
3125820	3126820	Come on.
3126820	3127820	It's been like, how many years now?
3127820	3128820	Like in the PETA one.
3128820	3132780	I'm not counting that because that was garbage, but like, let's, let's, let's get a new, new
3132780	3133780	Ridge Racer game.
3133780	3134780	Come on.
3134780	3138180	Frodo Swaggins asked a great question in chat saying, what do you think about the power
3138180	3145500	difference between PlayStation 5 and Series X?
3145500	3149580	I don't think we'll know until we actually see what, how the games use everything because
3149580	3152260	like it's just all specs right now.
3152260	3155060	It doesn't mean anything until we actually see them in action.
3155060	3161380	Um, yeah, it, it, it doesn't really matter without the games and the proof is the Nintendo
3161380	3162540	Switch.
3162540	3163540	That's my answer.
3163540	3168580	Nintendo Switch, because Nintendo Switch is not bringing that same technology to the table
3168580	3171900	that these, I mean, it's a different thing with the whole games on the go and all that,
3171900	3177140	but Nintendo Switch still look at the sales figure of Animal Crossing, the Nintendo Switch
3177140	3182780	does very well holding its place in gaming while not being the most technologically superior
3182780	3183780	console.
3183780	3187380	I do think price is going to be important.
3187380	3194580	Um, and I don't think Sony or Microsoft wants to find themselves as launching the more expensive
3194580	3195580	console.
3195580	3201020	Um, but we'll see at the end of the day, it's going to be the games that are the most important
3201020	3202420	period.
3202420	3203920	So we'll see.
3203920	3206580	And She-Hulk 10 says you won't notice without a new TV.
3206580	3210580	And that could be very, that's a very good point as well is that I still don't have a
3210580	3212580	4k TV.
3212580	3216100	You may not know this, you can get one like sub 500 now.
3216100	3221020	I mean, it's like, it just, well, for one, I'm just so irritated because of how much
3221020	3226900	I paid for the TV I currently have, but also I'm just kind of like in this day and age,
3226900	3229180	I'm like, it's just not been a priority for me.
3229180	3236140	I do have a 4k computer monitor and that's put the console in there.
3236140	3237140	Here's the crazy thing.
3237140	3239420	I actually bought a new graphics card.
3239420	3243760	We've been waiting to install the new graphics card because we need a new power supply, but
3243760	3246140	get this, did you know there's like some freak power supply?
3246140	3249100	Well, I should say free cause it's probably because of COVID and all that.
3249100	3252020	There's like a power supply shortage going on right now.
3252020	3253020	Try to go get one.
3253020	3261300	What kind of power, how, how much of a power, oh, uh, eight, one of those are like impossible
3261300	3262300	to find.
3262300	3264060	Uh, and seven fifties aren't easy either.
3264060	3267820	Uh, and I feel like when I was on Best Buy site, uh, it was like, you could find things
3267820	3273740	in the cheat, like the 300, 400 range or the 1200 range, but like everything in the middle
3273740	3274740	ain't there.
3274740	3276620	And Newegg didn't have anything?
3276620	3277620	No.
3277620	3280580	Or it was all like not in stock till the end of may and things like that.
3280580	3282140	I would check eBay or something.
3282140	3284380	eBay has been pretty fast to ship stuff.
3284380	3285380	It's weird.
3285380	3290940	No, I actually ordered a power supply on Amazon and it said, uh, we ordered it the first week
3290940	3296180	of April and it said it'll be there April 28th, April 28th comes and goes.
3296180	3299820	And the next day I get an email that's like, can you confirm you still want this because
3299820	3301980	we don't know when we're going to have it in stock.
3301980	3303620	And I was a little irritated.
3303620	3308880	I thought it was because they weren't shipping anything other than essential, you know, things
3308880	3309880	until later.
3310120	3313720	No, cause I got, I wouldn't call this Neo Geo mini essential.
3313720	3318080	I think I had to wait an extra day or two than I normally would, but no big deal.
3318080	3321440	I'm not going to be all like, can I speak to the manager about it?
3321440	3326040	But I was a little irked that like, I kind of felt like if they didn't have it and they
3326040	3329320	didn't know when they were going to, I kind of wasn't getting a realistic, but I'm trying
3329320	3333840	not to, you know, soccer mom manager about it.
3333840	3338160	You know, I'm trying to just be like, all right, maybe they were expecting it, but because
3338200	3342280	the factories are closed to the world situation, they didn't make them in time, whatever.
3342280	3343280	I'm just trying to keep my cool.
3344400	3348080	But yeah, it's trying to find a power supply right now is a little weird.
3348080	3349360	So I don't know what's up with that.
3349880	3351280	So, OK, yeah.
3352320	3356920	Anyway, yeah, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, yeah, I really want to build a new computer,
3356920	3358360	but right now is the hardest time.
3358560	3362400	Yeah. Oh, yeah. Because everybody's trying to work from home or spending the stimulus
3362400	3365560	money and all that stuff is factoring into that.
3365720	3371920	So anyhow, back to the Xbox, we'll see more stuff this week.
3371920	3374760	I'm very excited to see it in motion.
3374760	3379320	I think a lot of us are. So we will definitely talk about that next week on the show.
3379680	3384680	All right. In the meantime, let's talk about Google Stadia.
3385280	3388080	Remember, there was a Stadia Connect that happened this past week.
3388080	3389080	Did you all remember that?
3389560	3392920	Yeah. Yeah. Because social media was like dead silent on it.
3392920	3396840	And I kind of like forgot until I was looking for stories.
3398240	3401280	Yeah, right. Well, here's what you missed at the Google Stadia Connect.
3401440	3403880	I don't know. Like some of this news is kind of like, oh, yeah.
3404600	3407760	Player Unknown Battlegrounds is now on Stadia.
3407760	3410400	I mean, that is kind of a big game.
3410600	3414840	And it's something that you can actually get for free if you are a Google Stadia pro
3414840	3418240	subscriber, which remember, they gave that away for two months.
3418240	3421080	So they have a lot of people who are pro subscribers right now.
3421800	3423560	So that's a pretty big land.
3423560	3426520	And, you know, first person shooter game, that's something that might look a little
3426520	3430040	better on something like Stadia, depending on your Internet connection and all that
3430640	3434360	versus, you know, how it might look on your computer without something like that.
3434360	3435760	I don't know. It depends on your situation.
3436560	3440600	But then, you know, the fact that they've also announced that they're partnering with
3440600	3443360	Electronic Arts. So that's pretty big.
3443360	3447840	They're going to bring things like Madden, FIFA and Star Wars Jedi Order.
3448000	3449240	Now, say what you will.
3449240	3453200	But let's not forget that Madden is like the biggest selling game in this country.
3453520	3457560	So that being on Stadia now is an option.
3457840	3459960	That could be interesting to see how that plays out.
3459960	3465400	Again, I'm not sure Stadia has really proven itself as hardware to the masses, to
3465400	3467920	the dirty casuals, if you will.
3468200	3472760	But if Google can kind of push that, it would be interesting to see how many people
3472760	3475040	might buy into that. I don't know.
3475040	3479600	I think their positioning, the EA partnership is very interesting, I will say.
3479600	3482720	You know, you can talk all the smack you want about Stadia, but I think that's
3482720	3486640	important. And I think it's important to get people on board who might not otherwise
3486640	3491040	be on board with Stadia because of sports, sports, sports, sports, you know, things I
3491040	3493240	know we don't get into as much here on Orange Launch Radio.
3493440	3496880	But I'm certainly not going to deny those games are fucking huge and that there are
3496880	3499280	people that only buy sports, sports, sports, sports.
3499360	3501880	And that's, you know, that they are gamers, too, for sure.
3502200	3503280	So, all right.
3504080	3510400	Anyhow, other things, Octopath Traveler, Square Enix just released on Stadia as well.
3510400	3511400	That's a pretty big deal.
3511520	3515360	And then they also talked about some games that will be first on Stadia.
3515360	3518520	So they're not saying exclusive, but they're saying first on Stadia.
3518760	3524480	One of the games was Crayta, which is a platform to build games and play games.
3525120	3529480	It is very similar looking to Fortnite because it's also built in Unreal Engine.
3530080	3532480	So it's a way to build and play your own games.
3532480	3535000	I guess you could say like Little Big Planet or Dreams type of thing.
3535440	3536520	But it'll be on Stadia.
3536520	3539520	That's kind of interesting because I don't usually think of like create your own thing
3539520	3542640	on a Stadia device because it's in the cloud, but that's kind of neat.
3542640	3549320	Also, Ember is another game, which you play a firefighter, but it sounds like not a very
3549320	3549680	good one.
3549680	3551040	You might actually be setting fires.
3551040	3553920	I don't remember what the gag was with this whole thing, but that is another game that
3553920	3554720	is coming out as well.
3554720	3560240	So they are showing us at least a few other games for Stadia.
3560240	3564000	And if you haven't turned on your Stadia, well, I keep saying turn on your Stadia, even
3564000	3569680	though it's not an actual device, but let's say fired up your Stadia account on the web
3569680	3573760	or on your Chromecast, it might be a good reason to go back and check things out.
3573760	3574160	I don't know.
3574480	3576240	Player Unknown Battlegrounds might be kind of neat.
3576240	3576720	I don't know.
3577240	3579160	But I know a lot of people aren't into first person shooters either.
3579160	3581880	So, so what do you think, Loki?
3581880	3584560	Like, do you think Google, do you think the EA thinks a big deal?
3584560	3588800	Or do you think Stadia is like, you know what, Stadia really needed to get moving by now
3588800	3589680	and it still hasn't.
3589680	3590560	And that's bad.
3590560	3591840	I think it's the latter.
3591840	3596000	I think it needs to have EA to be able to compete out there.
3598000	3600080	I just, I don't see the draw.
3600080	3600880	I really don't.
3601520	3607760	I mean, aside from the potential where I don't have to buy a console to play games, it's
3607760	3610240	just, I don't know.
3610960	3612560	It's not something I would invest in.
3613600	3614240	Yep.
3614240	3614960	So we'll see.
3614960	3615680	I mean, we'll see.
3616240	3617440	It's an interesting maneuver.
3617440	3621600	I don't, I don't think this week's worth of news was enough.
3621600	3627440	I really think they needed to start to clue in how more people can get on Stadia.
3627440	3630080	Like, I need to see like exclusive games.
3630080	3632240	Like this is only something you can get on Stadia.
3632240	3634880	Cause that's the thing is that it's like, yeah, it's cool.
3634880	3636800	You have Madden, so does everybody else.
3636800	3640000	And they've had it for a long time now and now you're just getting it.
3640000	3647680	And it's like, I need to see like why I want to choose your platform because there's the
3647680	3649840	fact that it's, it's strictly digital.
3649840	3651920	It's, it's a Google service.
3651920	3655280	So you're not sure it's like, is this going to be around for a long time?
3655280	3658080	I mean, I just, I don't know.
3658080	3662080	I really have a hard time trusting that this would be a good thing.
3662080	3666640	Like nowadays, if, if everything's stayed the way it was, where bandwidth is unlimited
3666640	3673760	and everything, maybe, uh, after everything goes back to normal, it's going to be a hard sell.
3673760	3675440	And I just don't see it.
3675440	3684240	Um, I really think Google needs to be a little more, um, like they need to reach out to a more
3684240	3688800	casual audience a lot more aggressively, and maybe they're not ready for that for whatever reason,
3688800	3695360	but I really think they should be running ads right now that are akin to go to stadia.google.com
3695360	3698720	to play Madden right now, you know, which obviously they're not ready for that yet,
3698720	3700400	but that needs to kind of be the message.
3700400	3703600	They need to drop this whole, like you get a pro account.
3703600	3706800	That stuff is confusing to a non gamer audience.
3706800	3710960	It's not confusing to you or me, but to a non gamer audience, the message needs to be
3710960	3712320	very fucking simple.
3712320	3716400	It needs to be, Hey, do you want to play Madden, but you don't have a game console.
3716400	3720400	Go to stadia.google.com right now to play Madden online with your friends.
3720400	3721600	That should be the message.
3721600	3723760	And it needs to be just that simple.
3723760	3727120	If you have to jump through all these fucking hoops about, you know, signing up for this
3727120	3730400	account and that account and tying it to your Google account, all this stuff, they're never
3730400	3732720	going to tap the base that they need to be tapping.
3733680	3735600	And I think it's just that simple.
3735600	3737200	I think the messaging needs to be better.
3738080	3741920	And I also want to see like the examples of that integration they were talking about with
3741920	3746160	like YouTube and stuff, or if I'm streaming a game and someone can come join me in my
3746160	3747280	game or something like that.
3747280	3752000	Like I want to see more of that sort of thing is showing up on here, but like doesn't really
3752000	3752960	seem like there's anything like that.
3752960	3756240	Like if for some reason, I mean, Microsoft would never put it on their service since
3756240	3759920	they have their own streaming service, but let's assume like, Hey, Minecraft is on there.
3759920	3762800	And then you have someone streaming Minecraft and they're like, Hey, you want to come play
3762800	3763760	with us on our server?
3763760	3768560	You know, click this link, go and immediately connect, play Minecraft without having to
3768560	3769920	have it installed or anything like that.
3769920	3772640	Google could do that with YouTube if they wanted to.
3772640	3775840	If they want to leverage their muscle with YouTube, they could do it because I'm sitting
3775840	3779280	here about to make a comment about, well, one thing I don't think made our show world
3779280	3784560	tonight, but Amazon games, um, I think talked a little more about new world.
3784560	3785920	Um, I'm going to be quite honest.
3785920	3789200	I really understand it and I'm not going to until I actually get to play the game.
3789200	3791360	So that's about all I have to say about new world.
3791360	3795360	Um, but I would imagine it would be very likely that Amazon could integrate something like
3795360	3796240	that into Twitch.
3796240	3798800	Hey, do you want to come play this MMO with me right now?
3798800	3802480	Use this extension or whatever to just tap here and come play with me.
3802480	3804880	Google could leverage YouTube to do the same thing.
3804880	3806080	Well, right.
3806080	3808960	They have it built in for Stadia stuff, but there's not really any games.
3808960	3811920	I've seen that they're going to be using that first day.
3811920	3812560	I don't know.
3812560	3813040	I don't know.
3813040	3817040	And I don't know if it's due to the world, you know, COVID Corona situation or what.
3817040	3820960	Um, but I feel like Google isn't moving as fast enough as we all expected them to.
3820960	3822320	This is like the best time.
3822320	3825200	Like this is the ideal situation for them.
3825200	3830320	And if it can't take off in the ideal situation for them, where everybody has this available
3830320	3834880	space and a lot of people are stuck at home, it's like, I mean, it's not going to take
3834880	3836640	off if this is not going to happen now.
3837360	3840480	Now is the time for Google to do this.
3840480	3845280	Because if they wait like literally one more month there, it's too late.
3845280	3849440	And I, that's why I'm kind of like this, what happened this week needed to be it.
3849440	3853280	And it wasn't like, I'm not saying what they announced was crap or anything like that.
3853280	3855600	I don't think it was, but it wasn't enough.
3855600	3861600	It needed to be the next phase of Stadia because now what's going to happen is now, you know,
3861600	3865360	E3 and I'm using my quotey fingers is going to end up happening in June.
3865760	3869280	When I'm using my quotey fingers, it's E3 replacement stuff and things we would have
3869280	3870960	seen at E3 are going to start happening.
3870960	3872880	And then it's like, oh, Madden's on PlayStation.
3872880	3873840	I know PlayStation.
3873840	3875040	I know Xbox.
3875040	3876080	I know those things.
3876080	3878960	I'm going to end up getting my game on those consoles.
3878960	3879280	Yeah.
3879280	3879440	Yeah.
3881440	3884960	We're going to have Madden and we're going to have EA games on this platform.
3884960	3889200	And then next week, you know, we're going to have all the Microsoft exclusives like,
3889200	3891120	oh yeah, I want to get it on my platform.
3891120	3891600	Well, guess what?
3891600	3892720	They have their own streaming platform.
3892720	3896160	They'll need your Google Stadia to stream those games.
3896160	3902560	So it's like, I just don't I don't see it happening because they don't have enough
3902560	3905280	draw to bring people to that platform.
3905280	3909200	They need some exclusive games that are out now.
3909760	3916000	And I'm sorry, Destiny 2 and Madden is not really going to be a draw when it's on all
3916000	3920320	the other platforms already that people have had probably years already.
3920320	3921920	I just I don't see it.
3921920	3922160	Yeah.
3922240	3927600	And something like, you know, the firefighting game, like as Ember, as cute as that sounds,
3927600	3930720	as neat as that sounds, that's not going to pull the fucking muscle.
3930720	3934880	Like Google, use your muscle to get that exclusive that you need.
3934880	3940160	You know, hey, get EA to give you Madden first for a week.
3940800	3945600	That's the kind of like big dick energy we're going to need from Google Stadia for people
3945600	3946720	to be talking about it.
3947280	3950640	Oh, and EA is only on that platform until they come up with their own streaming platform.
3950640	3952720	I think they've already said they want to do their own thing.
3952720	3958080	So well, there's that there's that whole EA access that kind of ties into Xbox.
3958080	3958800	I mean, you're right.
3958800	3961440	It's probably only a matter of time before Origin becomes that.
3961440	3961920	Who knows?
3962480	3962640	Yeah.
3963200	3965520	As soon as they don't need Google anymore, they're gone.
3965520	3968160	I mean, just look at like the Nvidia sharing and stuff like that.
3968160	3972960	I mean, I'm sure all these companies will drop them as soon as they have their own solutions
3972960	3975120	because they don't want to pay anybody to have their own platform.
3975120	3975840	They want their own.
3975840	3976960	They want to control all of it.
3976960	3978480	They want their own ecosystem.
3979440	3979680	All right.
3979680	3982880	Well, let's move on to the next story because this will tie this tie into this a little
3982880	3983280	bit.
3983280	3986320	We're having to produce on the fly a little bit because Jamie was going to talk about
3986320	3986400	this.
3986400	3987920	Do you want to do this or you want me to do it?
3987920	3988240	Sure.
3988240	3989600	Let's talk about Summer Games Fest.
3989600	3990000	OK.
3990000	3996480	Summer Games Fest is going to be going on from now to the end of August or during summer.
3997520	4005520	So it's basically going to be a very long like kind of industry wide celebration of
4005520	4005920	games.
4006720	4013200	And it's going to be like I guess this digital event that's going to include different shows
4013200	4019760	including lives from like Bethesda, Blizzard, CD Projekt Red, EA, Microsoft, Riot, Sony
4019760	4020720	and Square Enix.
4023520	4027920	They said the event's going to take or they're going to stream on all major platforms.
4027920	4032400	So Facebook, Mixer, Twitch, Twitter and YouTube.
4032400	4038240	And they're going to have different details, I guess, for those events are going to come
4038240	4040720	I guess later on as soon as they announce those.
4040720	4046240	I don't know if the Xbox thing is necessarily considered one of those, but I don't know.
4046240	4050560	But Steam and Xbox are going to offer demos and trials for some games limited time.
4050560	4055920	Steam's games festival summer edition supposed to be taking place June 9th through the 14th.
4055920	4060160	And this is all being hosted, I guess, by Jeff Keeley's putting this on.
4060160	4062400	So it's pretty cool.
4062400	4067040	I want this is where I was just saying I want to learn more about the stuff that's coming
4067040	4067440	up.
4067440	4071920	I just wish there was more of a timeline to kind of tell me, you know, when all this is
4071920	4076160	going to happen, because it doesn't really specify.
4078160	4081280	And like, I don't know, but it's cool.
4083120	4085600	So that's kind of like their game awards thing.
4085600	4089120	Yeah, I mean, the whole thing is kind of like interesting, but it's weird that it's like
4089120	4089920	four months.
4089920	4091440	Like, that's not that's not a festival.
4091440	4092160	That's not a highlight.
4092160	4096160	That's like a that's the general gaming news flow.
4096160	4100960	It's like it's almost like I'm launching a website where I'm going to get all these exclusives
4100960	4101440	first.
4101440	4103040	And it's called Summer Game Fest.
4103040	4107760	You know, I just like and maybe it's just because also it's this whole nature of the
4107760	4109600	virtual world we're living in right now.
4109600	4114240	But I don't think I really, really, truly believe and I believe me.
4114240	4118720	I understand the narrative of things are not going to go back to the way they were for
4118800	4120320	a very long time.
4120320	4126560	Like, I understand that things like sporting events, travel, you know, there are things
4126560	4132480	where many, many Dragon Con where many, many people gather that there's still a big question
4132480	4134560	mark that hangs over a lot of that.
4134560	4140160	But for the most part, like I, I feel like we'll be able to kind of like gather in like
4140160	4141360	small groups.
4141360	4147040	You'll still be able to like go to restaurant on a Saturday night in a few months as opposed
4147040	4149520	to, you know, a year and a half.
4149520	4152160	I don't think we go back to normal normal like life.
4152160	4154720	Well, I don't think we ever go back to that 100%.
4154720	4159760	I think, for example, seeing masks in public, whereas maybe in some countries that was a
4159760	4163120	very common thing you would see when people are sick and we didn't really have that here.
4163120	4165200	I think I think that'll be a permanent fixture.
4165200	4167040	I think when people are sick, they're going to wear masks.
4167040	4170320	You know, I think that's something you're going to see more and more common.
4171040	4172720	But anyway, I don't want to digress too much.
4172720	4178640	My point is, is that, you know, maybe my mindset is this because I think of festival as we
4178640	4181920	gather for a week at South by Southwest and we talk about these types of things.
4181920	4183200	We do these types of things.
4183200	4188400	And I understand that, like, you know, maybe we can't have a festival in person anymore
4188400	4189120	or what have you.
4189120	4199360	But like four months of this online gathering, it's long and I don't think online culture
4199360	4202240	like it is in the quarantine scenario.
4202880	4204240	Exists in four months.
4204240	4212080	I don't think we're living our lives on Zoom 100% in four months, maybe 20%, but not 100%
4212080	4212800	like we are now.
4212800	4213300	You know what I mean?
4214160	4215680	Yeah, so.
4217680	4223040	But anyway, yeah, so the four month thing is a little weird to me.
4223040	4227440	I think that's just because maybe and maybe he has a series of exclusives that are going
4227440	4229920	to take him up through the Game Awards or something like that.
4229920	4230720	But it's just I don't know.
4230720	4232560	It's very it's very interesting.
4232960	4239600	But I could also see how maybe companies that were pushing to get things done for E3 week
4239600	4244640	are not able to make that happen because they've had to deal with the very real situation of
4244640	4250960	transitioning employees to working from home and not it doesn't necessarily end up in 100%
4250960	4251520	productivity.
4251520	4254640	In fact, it rarely does when it starts.
4254640	4257840	You know, like you can have some people are hell, they're more productive at home.
4257840	4259120	But like there's hurdles.
4259120	4262320	There's just all sorts of technological hurdles people have to get through before you're
4262320	4266800	able to, you know, kind of adjust to being at home all the time.
4268640	4273520	And so maybe companies that were going to do this thing for E3 week have kind of had
4273520	4276880	to push back their announces to all sorts of different times.
4276880	4281120	So now it's like, hey, that thing we were going to E3 week, it's like four months out
4281120	4283200	from when we were going to do it or another company like two months.
4283200	4287040	I guess they're counting the Xbox thing as part of this.
4288320	4290800	OK, I don't know.
4290800	4291680	Interesting.
4291680	4293200	But I don't know why.
4294720	4298720	What makes this special designation important?
4298720	4300080	That's what I'm missing.
4300080	4304080	Because honestly, when you say, oh, we're going to trickle down big gaming news for
4304080	4308800	four months, I'm just like, that's just normal.
4310000	4312720	Yeah, that's just the summer in games.
4312720	4317360	You know, OK, it's not all going to be in one week like it was in years past.
4317360	4318080	We knew that.
4318080	4323280	But like what's going to make Summerfest because the minute something is announced
4323280	4327440	on this Summerfest site, you know, Kotaku is going to have it.
4327440	4328960	Eurogamer is going to have it.
4328960	4330160	Twitter is going to have it.
4330160	4331120	Facebook is going to have it.
4331120	4333600	Like the news will just be there.
4333600	4334160	You know what I mean?
4335200	4339040	So I don't know that that's and I'm not I'm not trying to dog on it.
4339040	4341040	You know, Jeff Keighley is a smart dude.
4341040	4343280	Like there's obviously a piece of this I'm missing.
4343280	4346400	And maybe it's one of those things I just don't see until it happens.
4347200	4349520	Four months of advertisers.
4349520	4350320	I don't know.
4350320	4353440	But yeah, I'm just I'm just kind of confused on a few things.
4355920	4356400	I don't know.
4357840	4358160	All right.
4358160	4361600	I just am glad to see some some information whatsoever.
4361600	4362240	Yeah.
4362240	4363040	So all right.
4363040	4365840	So let's move on to the next story that you had, Loki.
4366400	4366720	Yes.
4366720	4370880	Unfortunately, Jamie would have loved this as well, but I thought this was kind of interesting.
4370880	4376160	So everybody's stuck at home and a lot of people are playing Animal Crossing.
4376880	4383440	There was a social media post by the Queer Eye Twitter user that was saying, hey,
4384320	4389040	if you go ahead and show a share your designs in your house,
4389040	4393680	Bobby Burke is going to actually take a look at that stuff and give you tips about
4394880	4398160	home decorating since he's the interior designer on the show.
4399360	4400560	So I thought that was funny.
4401840	4404720	So there is folks like showing off some of the different things that they're making.
4404800	4407040	And he's giving comments about them.
4408640	4409120	Pretty neat.
4410240	4410480	Yeah.
4410480	4414320	It's a very it's a nice little modern twist on things, isn't it?
4415440	4416240	Yeah, it's funny.
4416240	4421760	It's like it's what was the isn't it like the happy home designers or something like
4421760	4424960	that or happy home, something or other that's in the game itself.
4424960	4427760	And then it's like, you know, he's almost like a member of that now.
4428960	4432880	I remember where they evaluate like your home and how it how it is.
4432880	4433840	Yeah, you're right.
4433840	4435280	The happy home designer thing.
4435280	4435920	All right, cool.
4436480	4438880	I remember the happy home designer was like a game.
4438880	4440880	But like I remember it's happy home something.
4441600	4443840	But yeah, it's been a while since I played Animal Crossing.
4443840	4446000	Still haven't gotten to touch my switch version yet.
4448640	4449360	What's the holdup?
4451040	4453440	The kids are monopolizing the switch.
4453440	4456560	And after that, it's like watching TV and stuff.
4456560	4458400	So I just haven't got a chance to.
4459760	4460260	All right.
4461220	4466820	I'm waiting for is Jonathan Van Ness involved in this, though, or is it just Bobby, the
4466820	4468100	the home guy that's doing this?
4468660	4470340	I think it's just Bobby.
4470340	4476260	Oh, see, I I like Jonathan the best because he calls everything fierce and gorgeous.
4476260	4478420	And it's you look so gorgeous in that.
4478420	4484340	So maybe he'll start to address some of the attire that you wear in the in the game,
4484340	4490100	which, by the way, I don't know if you notice, but on stream, I'm wearing my meme shirt.
4490820	4494820	I said on a previous episode that like that meme shirt that's an Animal Crossing.
4494820	4496420	I fucking have that in a different color.
4496420	4496980	Here it is.
4498580	4500740	It's a little different because the cat has glasses.
4500740	4504020	But like I that's why I laughed my ass off when I saw that shirt.
4504020	4505700	I'm like, I fucking own that shirt.
4505700	4508500	So that's why I always wear it in Animal Crossing.
4510740	4511860	So it's funny.
4511860	4514260	So all right, let's move on.
4514260	4517460	And I'm going to talk a little bit about esports drama.
4517460	4519780	This one involving Overwatch.
4519780	4525300	So the Overwatch League, you know, it's still going moved over to YouTube.
4525300	4528420	And that's why I kind of lost track of it because I was following it on Twitch.
4528420	4531460	But it's on YouTube now and they're still going.
4531460	4536420	Obviously not right this second, but they had a season and they named an MVP.
4536420	4541540	The MVP was I hope I'm pronouncing this right, but it's Sinatra.
4541540	4544100	Like like Frank Sinatra, but with an extra A.
4544100	4545460	So Sinatra.
4545460	4546500	Hopefully I'm pronouncing that right.
4546500	4546980	Sorry, guys.
4546980	4549220	You can tell how much I've been following Overwatch League lately.
4549940	4552020	But I mean, this guy is so popular.
4552020	4556660	Not only is he the MVP of the entire league, he was actually on late night with Jimmy Fallon,
4556660	4559700	like talking about Overwatch League last October.
4559700	4562660	You know, when people were still going on late night talk shows in person.
4562660	4564580	So this guy's a pretty big deal.
4565380	4569220	It was announced this week that he's going to be leaving the Overwatch League.
4569780	4574420	And as if it couldn't get any worse, he's going to go.
4574420	4577220	I mean, worse for, I guess, Blizzard or whatever, worse for the league.
4578180	4581460	He's going to leave to go play Valorant instead.
4582260	4584660	So maybe he's just getting bored with Overwatch.
4584660	4587300	Well, he actually has commented a little bit on that.
4587940	4591940	He basically said the game is just not for me anymore.
4591940	4596820	I'm very happy with my life, but I just wasn't having fun with Overwatch anymore.
4596820	4598660	So, Loki, that's it.
4598660	4600020	You're not having fun playing the game.
4600020	4600740	Don't play it.
4600740	4602260	He's talked about he is.
4602260	4605860	But what was interesting is that specifically he calls out
4605860	4608580	the 2-2-2 role locking format.
4608580	4609300	You know what that is?
4609300	4613700	That's where they made it so that every match is 2 DPS, 2 heals, 2 tanks.
4614740	4618180	He cites that as a problem and the hero bans.
4619540	4621300	Yeah, I don't learn somebody to do that stuff.
4621300	4624980	I mean, it seems like you would have more creativity with your teams unless,
4624980	4629220	I guess, they're trying to get it so that not everybody hogs like a certain type of
4629220	4630020	class or something.
4630020	4630660	I don't know.
4630660	4630900	Yeah.
4630900	4633300	But that should be an option where you can turn that on or off.
4634180	4636980	Frodo Swagons in chat says Valorant is so boring to watch.
4636980	4637780	My God.
4637780	4640980	Quest Buster says Valorant isn't even out of closed beta yet.
4640980	4644420	So, kind of some ping ponging opinions there.
4644420	4647540	But I think we can give Riot the benefit of the doubt.
4647540	4649620	The game isn't out of beta yet.
4649620	4654500	But still, this is a huge development for a game that isn't out of beta.
4654500	4657460	I mean, talk about like throwing your weight behind something.
4657460	4664500	Again, it's not just like this guy was not just like a mostly sidelined player on one
4664500	4665460	of the teams like this.
4665460	4669620	This guy was the fucking MVP and he's saying, yeah, I'm gonna go play this instead because
4669620	4672420	the game I'm making money off of and getting notoriety for.
4672420	4673380	It's just not fun anymore.
4675060	4679220	Like, you have to wonder if Riot slipped a 20 in his pocket, a 20 million dollar bill
4679220	4681220	or like what's going on there.
4681220	4683220	It's kind of interesting.
4683220	4684420	I mean, but I'm willing to give.
4684420	4686260	I haven't played Valorant myself.
4686980	4688660	Maybe it is really fucking fun.
4688660	4689140	I don't know.
4689140	4690100	I haven't played it yet.
4690100	4693780	But I imagine it's one of those things, like most video games, we're all going to have
4693780	4695780	an opinion on it and some are going to love it and some aren't.
4696420	4698580	And this guy is just one of the lovers.
4700740	4701300	Yeah.
4701300	4705540	Quest Buster says he's not the only pro thinking of moving over to Valorant either.
4705540	4710340	Overwatch League lost some talent earlier this year, too, such as a few popular announcers.
4710900	4716020	So, it sounds like the Overwatch League might just be kind of, I don't know.
4716020	4717860	There's a part of me that says it's, oh boy.
4717860	4719300	Oh, girl, it's drama.
4719300	4720420	Oh, they're in trouble.
4720420	4721940	But then I'm also like, you know what?
4722500	4729620	As esports is getting bigger, it's like we don't just have football anymore.
4729620	4733060	It's like for years and years, we've only ever had football.
4733060	4734660	Football is the only thing we see.
4734660	4735780	Football is the only game we play.
4735780	4736580	That's all we have.
4736580	4740020	But now it's like all of a sudden, oh, they got baseball.
4740020	4744260	Oh, and basketball and hockey like all these other.
4744260	4747060	And I think this is what's going to continue to happen with Overwatch League.
4747060	4750340	And so suddenly, you know, Michael Jordan might be like, you know what?
4750340	4753860	Instead of playing basketball, I'm going to go try this for a little while.
4753860	4755860	Golf or whatever.
4755860	4756580	You know what I mean?
4756580	4758740	Like, I'm going to go try to be a pro in something else.
4758740	4763060	And I think, you know, obviously you're going to see that a lot more probably in esports
4763060	4763540	than you will.
4763540	4768340	Obviously, I'm giving a very like, you know, it's not that common that you hear the pro sports
4768340	4770740	people going from one sport to another, but it does happen.
4770740	4774820	But I think you're going to see it happen here more as there's just as esports game
4774820	4777220	popularity and there are more sports to choose from.
4778020	4778500	Quest Buster.
4779300	4779860	Oh, go ahead.
4780900	4783060	No, I said, yeah, you're probably going to see more of that stuff.
4783060	4786980	I mean, it's like after a while, like you got to move on to like other things, I would
4786980	4787380	think.
4787380	4793140	And maybe maybe this person thinks that, you know, Overwatch has kind of lost its luster
4793140	4796100	and now, you know, Valiant's where it's at.
4796100	4796740	So I don't know.
4798820	4799140	Yeah.
4799140	4802900	So reading some comments from chat, Quest Buster says, one of the arguments I've seen
4802900	4806500	is that the core Phantom will always love Overwatch, but the broader numbers just aren't
4806500	4808580	there to make it esports great.
4810980	4812500	Could Overwatch be slow?
4812500	4812820	I don't know.
4812820	4815700	I feel like it's too early to doom and gloom, that type of stuff.
4815700	4819140	But a lot will depend on the strength of Overwatch 2, I suppose.
4819860	4820500	Yes.
4820500	4821000	Yeah.
4821780	4822280	All right.
4823540	4823860	All right.
4823860	4830020	Well, let's move on to our next story, which is did you want to do this?
4830020	4831060	You want me to do this?
4831060	4831540	China?
4831540	4832020	Yes.
4832020	4832340	Yes.
4832340	4834820	Talk about China banning games.
4834820	4835320	Yep.
4835700	4839060	So China has banned a video game called Coronavirus Attack.
4839060	4842580	It was a game that came out on Steam about a week or so ago.
4843540	4849780	The game Coronavirus Attack is about a virus that can turn people in the selfish zombies
4849780	4851380	as spread throughout your country.
4851380	4857300	And your purpose is to prevent the selfish zombie virus carries from escaping and infecting
4857300	4858260	other peoples.
4858260	4862420	And to do that, you have to basically kill these people before they leave the country.
4863220	4868180	So of course, I felt that that game was kind of offensive.
4868820	4875380	And since also it was talking a little bit about where you win badges, like say, liberate
4875380	4880900	Hong Kong and whatnot, obviously they had to ban that from China.
4882340	4882840	Hmm.
4884420	4889700	Well, I mean, the whole like killing people before they that's kind of in poor taste as
4889700	4890200	it is.
4891220	4896500	You know, we've been talking a lot about how there's going to be games as art that come
4896500	4903700	out of this and not all art is, you know, some art provokes some art is offensive and
4903700	4904500	it gets you thinking.
4905540	4909940	And so this is just one of those examples, I think, is that it's art that is a little
4909940	4910340	offensive.
4910340	4913620	I don't know if it's necessarily like, you know, you're like shooting people or anything.
4913620	4917860	You're actually playing a yellow coronavirus pathogen.
4918660	4919460	I'm not really sure what.
4920420	4925300	Obviously, this is one of these games that people have made that is just trying to stir
4925300	4926180	outrage, I think.
4927220	4928020	Well, they got it.
4929060	4929560	Yeah.
4930740	4931700	So I don't know.
4934020	4934900	Neat, I guess.
4936020	4936820	All right.
4936820	4940020	Everyone will immediately forget about this game in a week or so.
4940020	4940520	Probably.
4941060	4941780	All right.
4941780	4946500	Then let's move on to the next story, which is a little bit of a follow up to something
4946500	4947380	we've been talking about.
4947380	4947880	Right.
4948580	4948980	Right.
4948980	4954100	So we were talking a little bit about these Valorant beta keys that they were doing these
4954100	4959060	24 hour streams where if you watch them for a certain amount of time, you would get a
4959060	4960980	drop for one of these beta keys.
4960980	4966180	Well, Twitch announced that they are going to be stopping this practice.
4966500	4971220	They said, basically, we've heard your concerns about creators continuously streaming VODs
4971220	4974820	while tagging the channels live to farm Valorant drops.
4976340	4978500	This harms the integrity of the drops program.
4978500	4983060	So we've updated our community guidelines to clarify that cheating any Twitch reward
4983060	4984740	system is prohibited.
4985300	4988340	No cheating, because cheating is against the rules.
4990100	4994100	So now they're basically not going to allow them to run these 24 hour streams.
4996340	4997620	They're going to prevent this type of thing.
4998340	5004180	So they said cheating a Twitch reward system such as drops or channel point systems is
5004180	5004820	not allowed.
5007060	5013540	And I'm not sure what exactly they're going to be doing to kind of combat that aside from
5013540	5016340	just trying to prevent these 24 hour streams.
5018260	5025860	I don't know, but I mean, yeah, if you don't drop these keys on the streams in the first
5025860	5026420	place.
5026420	5030020	Yeah, I feel like a conversation is going to happen there as well.
5030020	5035780	But yeah, I mean, I guess maybe I'm a little pleasantly surprised Twitch took action in
5035780	5036420	that regard.
5036420	5037940	I didn't really expect them to.
5038500	5042420	But now that they did, I'm kind of like, oh, okay, yeah, I guess that is the thing that
5042420	5044260	should have happened and good on Twitch for doing it.
5044260	5044500	Right?
5044500	5046420	Like, you know, they saw that there was a problem there.
5046420	5047780	People are exploiting it.
5047780	5050420	And so they've kind of, you know, cut that off.
5050420	5053860	And maybe that will make some of the people that are, you know, maybe like Riot and so
5053860	5054020	forth.
5054020	5055700	Maybe they didn't expect that this would happen.
5055700	5059140	You know, sometimes you can't foresee how internet people are going to take to certain
5059140	5059640	things.
5060340	5067540	So they, you know, did this and that'll be something for future key drop giveaway things
5067540	5068900	to consider, you know?
5069620	5069940	Yeah.
5069940	5074420	And well, at least it's nice to see that they're doing something.
5074420	5076100	So I don't know.
5076100	5076600	Yep.
5077220	5077720	All right.
5078580	5082260	Well, moving on to talking about Oculus sales.
5082260	5087540	So Oculus sales, they've actually been improving a little bit, which is notable to talk about
5087540	5091780	because, you know, we wonder, like, you know, is VR going to take over?
5091780	5093700	VR going to be the next big thing?
5093700	5095700	PlayStation VR has been doing pretty well.
5095700	5099060	And now we have, you know, improving numbers for Oculus.
5099060	5102020	And there's several reasons why this is happening.
5102020	5105300	It's not just like, oh, finally, you know, there's reasons for it.
5105300	5108580	And one of the big ones, of course, is the Oculus Quest.
5108580	5111060	The Oculus Quest just came out in last May.
5111060	5116180	And this has been pointed out as the biggest contributor to Facebook's other because,
5116180	5117620	remember, Facebook owns Oculus.
5117620	5122260	So the other revenue category has been very bolstered by the Oculus Quest.
5122980	5129380	In fact, the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, you may know, actually kind of said something
5129380	5134580	akin to wish we could have made more of them faster because these things were selling so well.
5135140	5137060	Oh, I actually have the quote from the investor call.
5137060	5138580	I wish we could have made more of them.
5138580	5138980	I'm sorry.
5138980	5141700	I wish we could make more of them faster during this period.
5141700	5147780	It's possible that the COVID corona situation accelerates some of the trends around virtual
5147780	5151620	or augmented reality, but I'm not sure what will happen in the long term.
5151620	5155780	And that's something important to consider as well is that you may have people that are
5155780	5163860	looking to VR as not just necessarily a new thing to do while at home or a thing to keep us home.
5163860	5167780	But think about how this is also something kind of I get you could probably do a whole
5167780	5169940	other show on this and I know they're out there.
5170660	5179620	Is that how could VR now in this pandemic world we're in kind of shine by how it can
5179620	5184580	bring us together by being in these fake worlds?
5184580	5190100	I guess I don't know how else to put it, but like or even like I can now travel these places
5190100	5193620	that I would have liked to have gone in person, but maybe I can't right now.
5193620	5196100	But VR can kind of take me there.
5196100	5200100	Or I would think if you're Facebook, it's a pay-per-view, a pay-per-view,
5200100	5204420	a kin event that I can attend in VR even though I can't be there in person.
5204420	5207860	Well, they have like, was it the Google Earth VR stuff that you can go like,
5207860	5209940	look at Street View stuff in VR, I think.
5211700	5214820	Phoenix 7726 says, so ready player one?
5215700	5220820	I'm not sure I'd go that far, but think especially because VR technology isn't quite that.
5220820	5223300	But what about the fact that, you know what,
5223300	5226900	sporting events and concerts we keep talking about,
5226900	5229300	those are going to be the last things to come back, right?
5229300	5234020	Like those are those are, you know, those don't come back until we have
5235140	5240500	treatment is one thing or a cure or a vaccine.
5240500	5244020	You know, we're getting some hopeful things on the treatment front.
5244020	5246260	But we don't, you know, we got to let the scientists do their work.
5246260	5247300	These things take time.
5247300	5251220	So, you know, we can wish on a star all we want, but we don't have anything where, you know,
5251220	5257140	the government has felt strong enough to say, yes, we can treat this now and it won't be as fatal.
5257140	5258820	Go forth and go back to normal.
5258820	5262580	You know, yes, now it is like the flu because we can treat it.
5262580	5264100	They can't do that yet.
5264100	5268340	So my point is, the concert industry, the live entertainers,
5269140	5274660	it's going to be challenging to figure out how do they make money in these types of times.
5274660	5279540	But what if they could do a concert in VR and sell tickets?
5279540	5284980	And I've always kind of thought this was going to be why Facebook because
5284980	5287060	remember when Facebook bought Oculus?
5287060	5290020	Everybody was like, why the fuck is Facebook buying Oculus?
5290020	5292580	Why didn't Microsoft buy a gaming company?
5292580	5294100	VR is for gaming.
5294100	5296900	And it's like, oh, wait, maybe not.
5297620	5299540	Maybe it's not just for gaming, actually.
5299540	5301460	They haven't really done much with it, though.
5301460	5302500	So I don't know.
5302500	5303700	They haven't yet.
5303700	5311700	But like, this is again, not that I advocate for this pandemic is a great time to be capitalist.
5312260	5316660	But I think the reality is there's going to be a lot of people that do try to seize the
5316660	5321460	opportunity, you know, and Facebook would honestly be stupid not to.
5323620	5325700	And I've said this since the beginning when they bought Oculus.
5325700	5330420	Look at the things that Facebook has been doing, like live streaming and 3D photos.
5331140	5335540	They keep inching closer and closer to streaming VR events.
5336580	5338020	That will fucking happen.
5338020	5341300	It do you think Loki is streaming VR events?
5341300	5343220	Is that going to happen at some point?
5343220	5344900	Is the technology going to be there for that?
5345780	5346660	Eventually, it will.
5348500	5349060	He went away.
5349060	5350420	So I'm going to answer for him.
5350420	5351860	Oh, wait, I think it's because my Skype.
5351860	5353140	Sorry, my Skype is blowing up.
5353140	5355460	And so it causes I'm sorry, Loki, were you talking?
5355460	5356740	I am still here.
5356740	5357540	Do you hear me?
5357540	5358260	Yeah, sorry.
5358260	5359540	I have the Skype.
5359540	5361780	God, Skype's going on.
5361780	5364820	And so you were probably talking to listeners and I couldn't hear you.
5364820	5367540	So the question I was asking was an answer for my benefit.
5367540	5368040	Sorry.
5369140	5372740	Will VR be streaming live events anytime soon?
5373940	5378260	I don't know about soon, but it eventually depends on what we're looking at soon.
5378260	5379860	I mean, maybe in the next 10 years.
5381700	5383380	I kind of think it'll be a lot sooner than that.
5383380	5385940	I think the technology exists to be able to do it.
5385940	5389060	I just don't think it exists on a wide scale, but I think they're going to go that way.
5389060	5393860	So anyway, my point is, is that I see Facebook streaming these types of events in VR
5393860	5396260	that we're not able to attend in person right now.
5396260	5399380	And I think there will be people that will be into it and buy into it.
5399940	5403220	It's probably not going to make as much money as live tours do.
5403220	5407300	But if Taylor Swift wants to do a concert on Facebook in VR,
5407300	5409220	I bet there will be people that would pay money for that.
5409940	5410500	Okay, thank you.
5410500	5412580	Bobby says the Olympics streamed in VR.
5412580	5415300	I was like, surely something has happened with this already.
5415300	5418100	And I was like, I know you can download videos in VR.
5418660	5421220	There's plenty of stuff on PlayStation VR, like videos.
5421220	5424260	I remember there was an Utada Hikaru concert you could watch and things like that.
5424820	5426180	But the streaming, I wasn't sure.
5426180	5428260	Okay, so the streaming is there.
5428260	5433060	So Bonds006 says Facebook can own that market.
5433060	5435940	They have the sub, just offer it to the masses.
5435940	5437540	$4.99 a VR show.
5437540	5438100	Exactly.
5438100	5439380	I think that's where this goes.
5439380	5444420	SSG100Matt says the NBA has been working with showing live games in VR for a while.
5444420	5447460	The biggest obstacle is that the customer base isn't there yet.
5447460	5450020	Well, now it's starting to grow a little bit.
5450020	5453060	And maybe this is going to be the time when it grows a little more.
5453060	5456900	I do need to point out VRChat is popular Zoom, that's all.
5457860	5462100	I do need to point out Half-Life Alex has also released in this time frame.
5462100	5464340	And I think we'd be idiots to not call out.
5464340	5466740	You know, that probably had somewhat of an impact.
5466740	5468180	Maybe not a huge one.
5468180	5474020	But I know at least one person that finally jumped ship into AR to play Half-Life Alex.
5474020	5475060	I'm sorry, VR.
5475620	5478820	I was going to say, yeah, there was an article I saw.
5478820	5480260	ARAlexR, sorry.
5480980	5482260	Regarding the VR stuff.
5482260	5490260	And even with Alex coming out, it's only about 1.9% of Steam users actually own VR headsets.
5492020	5494740	That's still higher than I would have thought, to be honest.
5495380	5496500	So, all right.
5496500	5498020	Well, anyway, we'll see what develops.
5498020	5502020	But I think it's interesting to note that Oculus has been growing.
5502020	5503300	So, I'm going to...
5503300	5505300	I think if he's ready, I'm going to actually call over to the show.
5505300	5507780	So, you guys know we've had to change a little bit on the fly tonight.
5507780	5510260	Because DarkSakura had a family emergency and she had to go.
5511300	5516100	So, if you've seen me frantically texting on the stream, I was actually texting Alan
5516100	5518820	to see if he'd be willing to cover the classic game tonight.
5518820	5521300	And thank gosh, he was.
5521300	5523140	So, I'm just going to do a little microphone change here.
5523140	5523780	So, I'm going to give...
5523780	5524260	Hi, Alan.
5524260	5524660	How are you?
5524660	5525460	Here's the yellow mic.
5525460	5526900	And I'm going to take the noisy mic.
5526900	5527620	So, sorry, guys.
5527620	5528660	It's going to make a little noise.
5528660	5529540	But I have to.
5529540	5533700	The Venmo payment hasn't come through yet for this.
5533700	5534660	No, it hasn't.
5534660	5535780	And hopefully this one works.
5535780	5536020	Yes.
5536020	5536340	Okay.
5536340	5537620	So, hi, how are you?
5537620	5538100	I'm very...
5538100	5539460	My time is very expensive.
5540100	5543380	Well, I appreciate you gracing us with your presence.
5543380	5545300	Is this a Twitch appropriate thing you're wearing?
5545300	5545860	Cover up.
5545860	5546180	Jesus.
5546740	5547060	All right.
5547540	5548420	It's nice outside.
5548420	5549860	It's hotter in here than it is outside.
5551540	5552820	How's gaming been for you?
5552820	5554180	We didn't talk about this on the show.
5554180	5556100	You bought something this week.
5556100	5556580	Oh, yes.
5557460	5559060	I got a Switch Lite.
5560980	5563860	It's on its way to Best Buy.
5563860	5568260	I pick it up on Saturday because I got the coral color.
5568260	5568980	I'm not pink.
5569700	5570100	Coral.
5572260	5573940	So yeah, that and Animal Crossing.
5574580	5577460	And why did you finally jump ship on getting this?
5577460	5578660	Because you wanted your own...
5578660	5580900	I was like, you can build an Animal Crossing house on my island.
5580900	5581140	No.
5582100	5584660	Just the fact that you have...
5586180	5587540	I don't like playing in the living room.
5588420	5589940	I don't like playing on a big TV.
5589940	5593380	I like things that are intimate, where it's either in my lap or right in front of me at
5593380	5594580	a computer desk.
5594580	5596820	So yeah.
5597460	5598020	And then I can...
5599060	5603140	If I was doing something and you wanted it, you're like, someone's coming over to give
5603140	5603540	me something.
5603540	5603940	Get off.
5606100	5609780	It's just like if you have kids that fight too much, you just got to get them their own
5609780	5611460	stuff, even if it spoils them.
5611460	5612180	I understand.
5612180	5616420	So well, and it's interesting is we were talking about this on prior shows is that the Switches
5616420	5619620	have been kind of hard to come by, but I guess not because you got...
5619620	5622180	Well, you weren't able to just buy one today.
5622180	5624020	You had to wait a little bit, but you were able to get one.
5625140	5630260	I saw over your shoulder, Alan got a Switch without having to deal with scalpers.
5630260	5637060	Yes, because this past week, and you may be SOL, a lot of the major retailers got...
5637780	5643060	I have no idea how big the shipment is or when the next one is going to be in relation
5643060	5643460	to...
5643460	5647140	Because Nintendo stopped production with all the COVID-19 stuff going on.
5647140	5655060	But Costco, Best Buy, and Amazon got a pretty significant bunch of different colors of the
5655060	5655540	lights.
5655540	5663700	I don't know about the main Switch, but I originally placed my order on Amazon because
5663700	5669380	they were sold out of Coral, saw that Best Buy had Coral, canceled the Amazon order,
5669380	5670340	switched to Best Buy.
5671220	5676100	And by the way, if you were to check, Best Buy, I think, is already sold out.
5676100	5677300	There might be some on Amazon.
5677300	5680580	If you see Amazon 199, that's Amazon.
5681140	5683220	They're the only people selling it for MSRP.
5684900	5686180	So yeah, I was able...
5686180	5689380	There were so many Switches in stock, I was able to cancel the order in one place and
5689380	5692900	confidently place it with another retailer, which two weeks ago you couldn't do.
5694180	5699220	So without getting too much of a tangent, I'm on this app called Slick Deals, which
5699220	5706100	I use to track if there's something that I want, whether it's workout clothes or...
5707940	5708420	I don't know.
5709380	5710340	I'm into fitness stuff.
5710340	5712180	So protein bar stuff that's expensive.
5712180	5715220	But if I want to know if there's a really great deal on it, you can put stuff on there
5715220	5718340	and your phone will alert you when it's in stock.
5718340	5720340	Can you all tell Alan's been working out?
5720340	5721860	I'm very skinny.
5721860	5722580	Thank you.
5722580	5726500	I haven't been working out, but Alan has.
5726500	5734580	I put a Switch notification in Slick Deals and it basically popped up and said,
5734580	5740660	this isn't technically a deal because it is MSRP, but Costco, Best Buy, Amazon have them
5740660	5742740	this week for MSRP.
5742740	5744980	And some people downloaded it because it's not a sale.
5745940	5748900	Deal is a discount, but that was my way in.
5749620	5755220	So today says, oh, Alan is one of those people that has an app and steals all the stuff people
5755220	5756900	want before they see it's in stock.
5756900	5758500	Okay, but to be fair, he's not scalping.
5758500	5759940	He bought it for himself.
5759940	5760340	Yes.
5760340	5766900	And a lot of the people who vote down those tips when something is in stock that's hard
5766900	5769220	to find are the resellers.
5769220	5773460	So the fact that this thing on Slick Deals had like minus 50 downvoted, those are the
5773460	5778660	scalpers downvoting it because they want to buy out Amazon at $1.99 and then flip it on
5778660	5779460	eBay for $300.
5779460	5782260	I just want one and I don't want to pay $400 for it.
5784100	5786340	And Fifth Dream today says, I know.
5786340	5788180	And by the way, SJ100 Matt can actually hear.
5788180	5793300	So Smoosh is all the way in the hallway and they can hear that Smoosh is pissed because
5793300	5797780	how dare we both be here and not by his side right now.
5797780	5798660	I don't have mine.
5798660	5799940	I don't have the squirt bottle.
5799940	5801380	It's fine.
5801380	5801880	Yeah.
5802580	5803860	So anyway, I'm getting a Switch.
5803860	5805140	I'm getting a Coral one.
5805140	5808100	I've already got the SD card with a little micro thing.
5808260	5810260	I have it set aside.
5811940	5818820	So yeah, I'll be posting my Switch code probably on Twitter Saturday evening and then I'll
5818820	5822900	probably hop on OLR on Sunday and read it there.
5822900	5827300	All I'm going to have is Animal Crossing because Switch games are $60 a pop and I'm probably
5827300	5827940	not going to go.
5827940	5829940	Well, you have all my games that I have on.
5829940	5830580	Well, true.
5830580	5834660	And if I knew this was going to happen, I would have done what Bobby Blackwolf did and
5834660	5837460	bought the physical one so we could like share the cartridge.
5837460	5838980	But here we go.
5838980	5839540	LOL.
5839540	5840740	Bobby's sitting there laughing.
5840740	5842020	Ha ha ha.
5842020	5843540	I'm smarter than Rob is.
5843540	5845540	This is pretty spontaneous.
5845540	5848180	I never guessed that he would finally join the Switch bandwagon.
5848180	5848660	This is like...
5848660	5853540	And I didn't think Animal Crossing would be the game to break you either, so to speak.
5853540	5855620	I think it's the circumstances that we're in.
5855620	5857780	We live in strange times.
5857780	5859300	We do live in strange times.
5861220	5862580	But why couldn't we like...
5862580	5863620	What do you mean swap games?
5863620	5864020	How?
5864020	5866740	Like the light isn't digital only.
5867860	5870100	No, no, it's not digital only.
5870100	5870260	Yeah.
5870260	5872180	Then all these cartridges I have in the other room.
5872180	5873140	Yeah, so we can still do that.
5873140	5874340	Yeah, you can take any of those games.
5874340	5874740	Yeah.
5874740	5879060	But like Animal Crossing or Mario Maker 2 or the things I bought digitally, I don't
5879060	5879780	have those.
5879780	5880740	But there's plenty.
5880740	5882180	You want to play Diablo 3 or something like that?
5882180	5882900	Yeah, well, okay.
5882900	5884340	I get your point there.
5884340	5885700	But like, yeah, I mean, if I want...
5885700	5887220	The only other game that I want...
5888020	5893220	Bobby says, to be fair, my wife bought Animal Crossing digitally because she was playing
5893220	5896020	it too much, I'd only get about 30 minutes a day.
5896740	5897300	Yeah.
5897300	5898260	Okay, there it is.
5898260	5898500	Yeah.
5898500	5900660	So Bobby is actually not laughing.
5900660	5902100	He's nodding in agreement.
5902100	5902420	Yes.
5902420	5903060	I understand.
5903780	5908420	I'm gonna take over your Breath of the Wild because I played that for like a dozen hours
5908420	5909540	and I hope...
5909540	5910260	Longer than that.
5910260	5912020	But I haven't played it in a while.
5912020	5912520	Yeah.
5913300	5918180	The only other one where I'd want to get, regardless of whether or not you have a copy
5918180	5919700	of it, would probably be Mario Kart.
5919700	5920200	I have it.
5922100	5925060	But like if we wanted to play together, like on our respective switches.
5925060	5925940	Then that's a little harder.
5925940	5926180	Yeah.
5926180	5926680	Yeah.
5926980	5928020	Smash Brothers.
5928020	5933860	I love Smash Brothers for GameCube, but because I'm on the light and I don't like the controller
5933860	5936740	thing, whatever, I'm not worried about Smash Brothers.
5937700	5938200	All right.
5938740	5940740	What else am I wanting to ask you about?
5941780	5944100	First off, a lot of the folks on Twitch...
5944100	5945540	Sorry to the podcast who can't see.
5945540	5948900	And also, if Matt or Loki is saying anything, I can't hear him.
5948900	5949940	So hi, Matt.
5949940	5950900	No, he's quiet right now.
5950900	5952100	I'm not being quiet.
5952100	5952420	All right.
5952420	5955060	Yeah, Loki's being quiet, but he says hi back.
5956660	5957160	All right.
5958740	5961700	Now, a lot of the Twitch people are commenting on...
5961700	5963940	They're saying, where did Alan get his haircut?
5963940	5965860	Or how did Alan get a haircut?
5965860	5968580	And just to be clear, Alan did not go out.
5968580	5970420	Alan's been very good at the shelter in place.
5970420	5971380	He just shaved his head.
5972180	5975220	It's the quarantine desperation.
5975220	5976900	I can't take this anymore.
5977940	5978440	Target.
5979380	5980340	DIY.
5980340	5981060	You just...
5981060	5981540	That's right.
5981540	5983140	Loki's saying it verbally.
5983140	5984740	You just do this with the guard.
5984740	5987620	And the guard keeps you from making any severe mistakes.
5987620	5991620	And then you get your spouse or roommate or significant other.
5991620	5993380	And you say, get the back.
5993380	5994420	I can't get the back.
5994420	5995540	It's fucked up in the back.
5996260	5998180	And then Rob comes out and he's like, fine.
5998180	5999540	And then he goes, nah.
5999540	6000040	So yeah.
6000900	6004820	But see, you're lucky, though, that you still have everything in the middle.
6004820	6008340	So the problem for me is that I don't have all this in the middle.
6008340	6009700	You're going to have to cave at some point.
6009700	6012580	Or you're going to have the full fur rim, like Friar Tuck.
6013540	6014420	See, I don't want that.
6014420	6017540	So I'm just like, luckily, I really love hats.
6017540	6018100	Yeah.
6018100	6019300	Or I just have to go down.
6019300	6022100	Like I have to do like the extra thing and just go like completely.
6022100	6023860	But I'm like, my head is shaped funny.
6023860	6024660	I don't like it.
6024660	6027780	But like, you know, like the back, the back is starting to grow out.
6027780	6028660	It's like, oh, God.
6029460	6029780	Yeah.
6029780	6030500	So I don't know.
6031220	6033300	When you finally crack, just let me know.
6033300	6036420	And we'll go outside in the lawn so the hair can go wherever.
6036420	6040260	And I will happily, the hair that you have, I will happily buzz.
6040260	6042740	But yeah, no, it's just it's quarantine desperation.
6043140	6043700	It is.
6043700	6044200	It is.
6044660	6044980	All right.
6045540	6047700	So the reason why you're here, of course, Dark Soccer,
6047700	6050820	I had to step away for a family emergency, which which fucking sucks.
6051460	6054660	But I really appreciate you, you know, because I'm like, OK, how do we do this?
6054660	6057300	I could just have Loki pick something on the fly or I could be something on the fly.
6057300	6059060	Oh, Alan's got about 15 minutes.
6059060	6060180	Maybe he can pick something.
6060180	6062660	So I said, could you pick a classic game of the week?
6062660	6066820	So because we've done this on the fly, we had to switch out what we were going to do.
6066820	6069140	Jamie was going to do a pinball table tonight.
6069140	6071220	I'm sure you all can understand she's not going to do that.
6071220	6073220	We're going to roll that over to a later week,
6073220	6076660	whether that be next week, two weeks from now, whenever she she comes back.
6077620	6080260	But I said, Alan, hey, could you pick something on the fly?
6080260	6081060	So he did.
6081060	6082740	I don't have footage of it tonight.
6082740	6084340	I'm sure you all understand why.
6084340	6085860	So we're just going to do this on the fly.
6085860	6087940	But Alan is going to pick the classic game tonight.
6087940	6089620	So, Alan, what do you want to talk about?
6089620	6091060	What game do you want to pick tonight?
6091060	6095380	I want to talk about let me get my and I have played this game multiple times and beat it
6095380	6096980	multiple times, but it was a long time ago.
6096980	6098580	So I need to get my sure.
6098580	6099060	Go for it.
6099060	6100900	My nodes, a.k.a. Wikipedia.
6103220	6104900	Meanwhile, I'll read comments from chat.
6104900	6108900	Miss DOLR says, Alan, why do you think one of the first things I'm doing when the salons
6108900	6110820	actually reopen is getting my hair cut?
6110820	6111780	With precautions.
6111780	6117060	But I don't even have the other house person help me make my back even option now.
6117060	6118580	Yeah, but let me tell you what.
6118580	6124420	Those haircut places are going to be swamped when it's safe to do so.
6124420	6126180	So just make an appointment.
6126180	6130420	I'm not too proud to admit this, but for about two years now, I have been getting my
6131620	6137380	when you're a man of a certain age, like in your late 30s, early 40s, the hair on your
6137380	6141060	nose, in your nose, your ears and your eyebrows, we're just going to do whatever the fuck we
6141060	6141460	want.
6141460	6142420	You can figure it out.
6143220	6144500	So I would get wax.
6144500	6147140	I would get my eyebrows and ears and nose waxed.
6147140	6150340	And you can't tell right now, but there's a lot of chaos here.
6150340	6154580	This the fact that I have two eyebrows, that's my doing with the razor blade.
6154580	6157220	So I miss the wax salon.
6157220	6157860	I want to get...
6158820	6159860	You want your Brazilian?
6160660	6162980	Yes, my face Brazilian, whatever.
6162980	6165140	Just yoink.
6165140	6165860	Absolutely.
6167460	6174420	And this is like, I got like some Abe Vigoda type, you know, the guy with the eyebrows
6174420	6175460	that's going on in my ears.
6175460	6176020	It's not cute.
6176020	6176580	Oh my God, you died.
6176580	6177220	Have some class.
6177220	6177720	Oh God.
6178740	6179460	I'm just kidding.
6180340	6183060	Once you turn 35, it truly is downhill.
6184020	6184820	That's not true.
6184820	6187380	I've loved my 30s and my 40s are okay.
6187940	6192180	I mean, this COVID shit ain't helping, but until that happened, it was all right.
6192180	6192660	All right.
6192660	6193860	Classic game of the week.
6193860	6194420	What is it?
6194420	6200020	Okay, so this game, I want to see if the chat room can guess.
6200900	6201940	It's for the PS2.
6202900	6211940	It came out in America in October of 2001.
6211940	6215540	Came out in August in Japan, same year, 2001, PS2 title.
6215540	6224580	It was directed by Hideki Kamiya, who was the director of Resident Evil 2.
6225140	6233780	And it was a genre breaking, genre inventing edgelord, beat him up, mega gothic extravaganza.
6233780	6235060	And that is Devil May Cry.
6236660	6238100	Props to Orange Riot hit it first.
6238900	6246180	Devil May Cry, cause I got a PS2 on launch, which I think came out March of 2000.
6246180	6251540	So by the time Devil May Cry came out, PS2 was out for about 15 months.
6251540	6257380	And for me personally, DMC, which not referring to the DMC remake that came out like six years
6257380	6267140	ago that everyone hated, but as an abbreviation, the first Devil May Cry for me was PS2's killer app.
6268580	6270900	Like this is why I have this console.
6270900	6272340	This is new, this is fun.
6272340	6274100	I've never seen anything like this before.
6274660	6275540	Shit's wild.
6275540	6278820	I want to bring friends over to show them this.
6280180	6284660	That was that game for me, because I had like tech and tag tournament and SSX snowboarding
6284660	6286580	and some of the other launch titles.
6286580	6288100	A few things had trickled in.
6288100	6292900	PS2, of course, the 3D compared to the original PlayStation was quite incredible, but Devil
6292900	6299060	May Cry was it for me, where I was like, I've now justified the price of the, I don't
6299060	6300740	know, $400 that thing cost.
6301940	6307380	It is a 3D action hack and slash.
6308580	6310260	It counted up your combos.
6310260	6314820	There were very ridiculous moves where you're flipping, you're juggling enemies in the air.
6314820	6317620	You're flipping weapons in the middle of combos.
6317620	6318660	You're shooting lasers.
6318660	6319940	You have a demon form.
6319940	6329860	It is very self-aware, edgelord, hot topic, like, my name's Dementia Raven, Gerald Darkway,
6329860	6332420	Black Parade way, like, goth.
6332420	6340100	And in the intro, Dante is at his private detective's office, and a blonde chick drives
6340100	6346340	a motorcycle through his door and lands the motorcycle on him, and it's very cuckoo bananas.
6347220	6350180	Devil May Cry is the precursor to Bayonetta.
6350180	6354820	If you've played Bayonetta, then you know what Devil May Cry is like, because that's
6354820	6359860	sort of the, Dante is Bayonetta's father, in no sense.
6359860	6360740	Not daddy, though.
6360740	6361940	That's between the two of them.
6361940	6362500	I don't know what they do.
6362500	6363220	That's their business.
6365060	6369700	Hideki Kamiya, like I said, he was the director of Resident Evil 2.
6369700	6374180	He then went on to Platinum Games, where he also did, of course, Bayonetta and Bayonetta
6374180	6374740	2.
6374740	6376660	Wonderful 101, I think, was his.
6377300	6380660	He wrote the story for Viewtiful Joe 1 and 2.
6381860	6383060	He blocked me on Twitter.
6383860	6384740	What did you say to him?
6384740	6386420	No, but he's blocked a lot of people.
6386420	6386900	Okay, yeah.
6388500	6394340	Yeah, I think he is a preemptive, he's a good internet troll, but he's an internet troll
6394340	6399620	that kind of has not the thickest skin, so he is good at riling up his fans and irritating
6399620	6402660	the shit out of them, but then if you kind of say something snotty back, I think he will
6402660	6404340	block you, which isn't the best mix.
6404740	6418580	So, the style with the tight, challenging gameplay was what made Devil May Cry such
6418580	6419220	a success.
6420100	6426580	It had a very, it was easy to learn, impossible, quote unquote, to master.
6426580	6430100	It had a very sharp learning curve if you wanted to, or a very steep learning curve
6430100	6435060	if you wanted to get an S or SS class on all the missions, all the levels, you had
6435060	6436180	to play them over and over again.
6436180	6441940	There was easy, normal, hard, nightmare mode, are you stupid mode, all that stuff.
6441940	6447780	If you were a masochist before Dark Souls, you beat Devil May Cry and you put on Nightmare
6447780	6449300	and then you had yourself a great old time.
6450100	6451380	Definitely was replayable.
6452020	6456420	Once you got good at it in normal mode, you could probably play it again from start to
6456420	6458980	finish and realize, oh, you shaved two hours off your time.
6459780	6465300	So, yeah, action, arcade, very violent, demons and monsters.
6466580	6469860	I had very little time to put this together, but you get the idea.
6469860	6470820	You're doing great, sweetie.
6470820	6475620	Go on YouTube, look up Devil May Cry 2001 if you've never played it.
6477300	6480500	Also, really good soundtrack, don't really know who did the music, though.
6480500	6485380	But you can get it now pretty much anything relevant current day.
6485380	6489460	You can get it on PS4 or Xbox One as a digital download.
6489460	6491380	It's on the Switch because everything's on the Switch now.
6491380	6492660	Came out June 2019.
6493220	6494340	You can get it on PC.
6497220	6500420	Devil May Cry had a sequel, Devil May Cry 2.
6500420	6505860	They did not ask Hideki Kamiya if he wanted to be a part of it.
6505860	6508260	They just greenlit it and put people on it that weren't him.
6508260	6511540	And he still, at the time when they interviewed him about it, he's like, I don't know why
6511540	6512580	they made the sequel without me.
6513220	6514660	Capcom just did their own thing.
6514660	6519140	Devil May Cry 2 is considered the worst of the series.
6519940	6524020	DMC3, which is about him, Dante, and his brother, Virgil.
6524020	6529860	The game is very, very loosely based off of Milton's Paradise Lost.
6530420	6534580	I think there was that one Edgelord game for the PS3 that came out that was also based
6534580	6534900	on that.
6534900	6537620	So yeah, Trish, Virgil, Dante.
6538260	6544660	DMC3 was a prequel, which was very successful and very fun to play.
6544660	6551540	Then there was DMC4 and DMC5 after the series was put on hiatus because I'm not sure what
6551540	6553540	year it was, 2012, 2013.
6553540	6558580	They sort of remade Dante as this very Twinkie type.
6558580	6563540	It was too Hot Topic, Edgelord, Grim Dark, Raven, Dementia Way.
6563540	6564660	It was too much.
6565460	6570740	You know, Kamiya knew how to keep it at like a 7 and they went a full 10 and it did not
6570740	6570980	work.
6571700	6578180	So because that game kind of flopped, they were like, oh, Capcom didn't really know what
6578180	6579300	they wanted to do with it.
6579300	6584500	Finally, they greenlit and made Devil May Cry 5, which came out last year.
6584500	6587940	And my understanding is that was successful and that was a lot of fun to play.
6587940	6588420	I have it.
6588420	6590580	I haven't played past the tutorial stage.
6590580	6591140	And why not?
6591860	6594980	Girl, how many games do we have on Steam that we haven't played?
6596100	6597700	Are you going to ask me that question?
6597700	6598820	Drag me, expose me.
6600820	6607380	So yeah, you can get DMC1, 2, and 3 on Steam.
6607380	6608260	It's a trilogy.
6609140	6614420	For some reason, DMC3 standalone 4 and 5 are on sale right now on Steam, but the original
6614420	6616660	1, 2, and 3 trilogy is like a package.
6616660	6617540	It's full retail.
6617540	6618900	I think it's 39 or 49.
6618980	6622580	Maybe put that on your Steam wish list and wait for one of the bigger sales to come up.
6622580	6625940	But if you want to play it, you have half a dozen ways to do so, is what I'm trying
6625940	6626740	to say.
6626740	6629460	So yeah, that's the classic game of the week.
6630340	6634260	Came out in 2001, which is 19 years ago.
6635140	6637700	Thank you for the reminder that we're all getting older.
6637700	6638660	Appreciate that.
6638660	6639380	Disgusting.
6639940	6640500	All right.
6640500	6641220	All right.
6641220	6642340	Well, Alan, you did great.
6642900	6645620	You guys have to know again, I gave him like 10 minutes notice.
6645620	6647220	Hi, can you jump in and do this segment?
6647220	6647860	And he did it.
6648500	6651780	I checked the Wiki and I was like, all right, there's got to be, because there's always
6651780	6654260	the game that's like, how have we not done this before?
6654260	6655300	Devil May Cry was it?
6655860	6656420	All right.
6656420	6656820	Yeah.
6656820	6658260	That's why I put a ring on it.
6658260	6658820	Yep.
6658820	6659140	All right.
6659140	6659780	Thanks, Alan.
6660340	6660740	Bye.
6660740	6660980	All right.
6660980	6661380	Take care.
6661940	6662740	All right.
6662740	6665940	And I'm going to switch back to my less noisy mic, you guys.
6665940	6670340	Thank you for dealing with some of our life changes.
6670340	6676820	Again, Dark Sakura had to step away early due to an emergency and hoping everything's
6676820	6679140	okay in our soccer Ville.
6679140	6679780	Okay.
6679780	6683300	Moving on, though, we still have some news to cover and some things to get to before
6683300	6685140	we wrap up tonight's show.
6685140	6686900	So we got some rapid fire news.
6686900	6688180	We're going to try to get into here.
6688180	6689460	So, Loki, do you want to start?
6690100	6690340	Yeah.
6690340	6695460	Let's talk about what's coming out for free games with your online subscriptions for Xbox
6695460	6697860	slide game with golden PlayStation network.
6697860	6701780	So starting with games of gold, you have the rally four, which is going to be made first
6701780	6707780	through the three verse and then Warhammer 40,000 Inquisitor Martyr that's going to be
6707780	6711060	coming out May 16th through June 15th.
6711060	6716420	And then the Xbox 360 compatible games Sensible World of Soccer for the first half of May
6716420	6718420	and Overlord two for the second half of May.
6718980	6721620	That is a game I have not played in a long time.
6721620	6722260	Overlord.
6724900	6729700	Then let's see, although it's weird, though, because in their screenshot, they show Overlord,
6729700	6731300	not Overlord two.
6731300	6734340	So I wonder if that's not accurate or not.
6734340	6735060	Let's see here.
6736260	6743700	But anyways, we've got for the PlayStation side of the house, the city skylines and farming
6743700	6746900	simulator 19 are going to be the two games you get.
6747460	6748420	Those are some choices.
6748420	6749460	Well, city skylines.
6749460	6754020	I mean, I keep forgetting like that's a console game, you know, like that to me, like that
6754020	6755860	is like a SimCity type of successor.
6755860	6760660	Like that's the game that showed up when the SimCity reboot like stunk.
6760660	6763780	So I keep associating that as PC.
6763780	6768020	I never think of that as a PS4 game, but I guess, you know, maybe this release is going
6768020	6769620	to change some of those notions.
6769620	6770580	Farming Simulator.
6770580	6773620	I'm not trying to dog on that game, but I feel like that's shown up as the free game
6773620	6774820	multiple places right now.
6774820	6778660	So it's kind of like because that was that was a Stadia Pro game not that long ago.
6778660	6779940	So I mean, yeah.
6779940	6784180	And it's you know, I don't know a lot of people that are going to get that excited about farming
6784180	6786340	simulator, but it's different.
6787300	6792020	It could be a fun game to stream if you haven't, you know, you don't know what you're doing.
6792020	6792580	It's true.
6792580	6793060	I don't know.
6793060	6793620	It's true.
6793620	6794260	Hey, you know what?
6794260	6798100	Those like those truck driving simulator things with the Eurotruck simulator, whatever.
6798100	6799220	Those games are fucking fun.
6800180	6801460	So you know what?
6802900	6804100	Anyway, I shouldn't talk shit.
6804100	6805140	Yeah, do some farming.
6806420	6807780	If you're ready to do some farming.
6807780	6808280	Sure.
6808900	6809400	All right.
6810500	6811460	And this is kind of cool.
6811460	6815220	So we have always been talking about a lot of different things you can make with Dreams
6815220	6816420	and all these cool creations.
6816420	6821140	So somebody took the whole concept of Lego Super Mario.
6821140	6824820	You know, the actual sets are coming out here within a matter of months.
6825860	6832180	They took that and they've made a Lego Super Mario game in Dreams using the character model
6832180	6834020	and everything completely from scratch.
6834740	6839140	Pretty amazing, though, the little gameplay that they did it and it was 60 plus hours
6839140	6841540	so far being put into the game to make that.
6841620	6846340	And they even had like a behind the scenes video showing how they modeled everything
6846340	6848100	and just an amazing job.
6848100	6849300	No copyright takedown yet?
6850500	6854100	Not yet, because wasn't that a thing just like two weeks ago we had like Mario games
6854100	6855300	getting taken down in Dreams?
6855300	6857220	Like, how does this not happen here?
6857940	6859220	Mario and Lego this time.
6859220	6862020	Oh, but you're fringing on two IPs.
6862020	6862660	Great job.
6863540	6864580	Multiple IPs.
6864580	6866260	Multiple, why not?
6866260	6867700	You're going to fridge on IPs.
6867700	6868660	Let's do multiples.
6869620	6874500	Um, but yeah, that's like, that's like when what's his name posts the video with all the
6874500	6877220	copyright stuff so that they all infringe on each other.
6877220	6879780	They all file infringement stuffs on each other.
6880500	6882340	You know what I'm talking about?
6882340	6884020	Yeah, copyright deadlock or whatever it is.
6884900	6885400	Yeah.
6886100	6886580	All right.
6886580	6891300	So if you want to check it out, just look for Lego Super Mario, the video game.
6891300	6895460	And it's by the game designer, barely regal.
6895700	6902580	So which classy, which by the way, um, there is a free demo of Dreams.
6902580	6903140	It just came out.
6903140	6906420	I was reading about, I haven't grabbed it myself yet, but I don't know if it's something
6906420	6910340	where you can like, just play the creations or if it's timed or what the restrictions
6910340	6911620	on the demo are.
6911620	6915220	But, um, if you're curious about this game, which Dreams is one of those things where
6915220	6917300	I'm always like, Oh yeah, I need to get on that.
6917300	6918340	I need to get on that.
6918340	6918740	You know what?
6918740	6919860	I really need to get on that.
6919860	6922500	And then it's like, you know, but animal crossing.
6922500	6926980	And so I never like get to it, but maybe a demo would be a nice little shove in the
6926980	6927700	right direction.
6927700	6928020	Right.
6928020	6929220	So you have a chance.
6929220	6930260	So, all right.
6931220	6936500	Moving on, let's talk about some changes coming up to Final Fantasy 14 and its next
6936500	6937220	patch.
6937220	6941060	You may not be aware, but some of the things that people don't like about Final Fantasy
6941060	6946660	14 is that the story from the original expansion, a realm reborn, the first 50 levels of the
6946660	6947700	game you have to play.
6947700	6950500	Some people feel it is too fucking long.
6950500	6954500	And, um, yeah, yeah, it's, it's, it's a little long.
6954500	6956660	So this is an interesting thing they're doing in the patch.
6956660	6962020	They are cutting out some of the con you never, you never think about celebrating the removal
6962020	6966580	of content as good news, but in the case of Final Fantasy 14, people are relatively happy
6966580	6970900	that, uh, they're going to be scaling back the content in a realm reborn.
6970900	6972580	I believe they're saying about 13%.
6973380	6978340	So some of the, uh, stuff you have to get through to get to the expansions, it's going
6978340	6980180	to be rebalanced, changed.
6980180	6985620	Uh, you won't have to worry about consistently hitting this block where you can't progress
6985620	6987380	with the story because they're going to balance it.
6987380	6990900	So the story gives you enough experience to just keep going through the story.
6990900	6992180	So that's pretty cool.
6992180	6997060	And they're adding new stuff as well, including the next section of the Nier Automata inspired
6997060	6998980	raid called the Puppets Bunker.
6999540	7004740	And I'm looking forward to playing that because I, I was very late to the party on Nier and
7004740	7005540	it's really cool.
7005540	7007700	And I like the look and especially the music.
7007700	7008900	I love the music in that game.
7008900	7012900	So, uh, very looking forward to what the music is going to be like in that, uh, particular
7012900	7013140	raid.
7013140	7014260	That'll be really cool.
7014260	7018660	And they're also going to continue the storyline around the Ruby weapon, uh, which was something
7018660	7020100	you fought already.
7020100	7023780	And they're going to be increasing the difficulty of, uh, past raids.
7023780	7028100	So some of the old level 50 raids will be coming back, uh, and getting a lot harder.
7028980	7033300	Uh, Ziba is asking over in our chat room, Rob, what server do you play on?
7033300	7034260	Cactuar.
7034260	7035540	I've been bouncing around.
7035540	7037220	I started on Midgar Summer.
7037300	7040100	I was on, um, Hyperion during the last expansion.
7040100	7041620	Now I'm on Cactuar.
7041620	7045060	And, um, I finally changed my character.
7045060	7046740	I'm no longer Lil Poundcake.
7046740	7048180	That was my old character.
7048180	7049300	I've changed.
7049300	7051300	I should, should I say my new character?
7051940	7054100	Am I going to get trolled if I give away my new character?
7054100	7055380	Do you want to know my new character name?
7055380	7056740	Loki, do you want to know my new character?
7056740	7057300	You might like it.
7058180	7058420	Sure.
7058420	7059060	What is it?
7059060	7061860	My new character's name is Jeremy Bearimy.
7064820	7065780	So there you go.
7065780	7066100	All right.
7066980	7071620	Uh, moving on, uh, also talking about Apex Legends.
7072820	7077540	Apex Legends is introducing a new hero, a thief named Loba.
7077540	7081380	And if you've been following the game, you may have seen Loba before.
7081380	7085780	She has a connection to Revenant, uh, that joined the game in season four.
7086820	7090420	In this new update for Apex Legends, there's going to be a new,
7090420	7094100	a hundred new items for people to unlock, including legendary skins,
7094100	7098260	Apex packs, uh, a new quest mechanic apparently is going to be in the game.
7098260	7099060	That's pretty cool.
7099060	7101140	I haven't checked out Apex since it first launched.
7101140	7103220	I didn't read, really need to get back into it.
7103220	7106100	Um, because I think there there's like duos mode in that now.
7106100	7107620	And they've added some other fun stuff to that.
7107620	7108660	So, okay.
7108660	7110420	Hey, anybody out there play Apex?
7110420	7113220	Like, do they, did they ever put in like a solo type mode?
7113860	7117060	Like where, or something where you can play against AI to get better
7117060	7120100	at the game before you just go back to the game?
7120100	7120260	Yeah.
7120260	7122580	When they had the Titanfall into the game.
7122580	7122740	Yeah.
7122740	7123540	I'd be looking for that too.
7123540	7124260	That'd be pretty cool.
7124900	7125540	All right.
7125540	7129940	Um, let me try to tackle the headlines Jamie had, and then you can fill in any gaps.
7129940	7130180	Okay.
7130180	7130900	Loki.
7130900	7134980	Um, so number one, uh, Evo 2020 got canceled.
7134980	7137460	Uh, so they're not going to be doing Evo 2020.
7137460	7138900	Does that really surprise anyone?
7138900	7139460	Not really.
7139460	7141540	Sadly, uh, everything is getting canceled.
7141540	7144340	Um, but they're going to be doing an online event in its place.
7144340	7147140	Um, I know, uh, this was brought up on Bobby's show.
7147140	7151380	He had a caller tonight that was talking on his show a little bit about it and how it's
7151380	7156260	going to be interesting to see how it plays out because like disconnects happen and the
7156260	7159140	internet isn't always the greatest on some of these games.
7159140	7160740	There's lag and yeah.
7160740	7165220	So, um, I don't know if it's going to be the best solution, but right now there isn't a
7165220	7166500	lot of other solutions.
7166500	7169460	So yeah, it's what they might have to do.
7169460	7174500	So, uh, we'll see, uh, what, how Evo goes, but I'm sure they want to get back to Vegas
7174500	7175620	as soon as possible.
7176180	7178980	Uh, and then the other big story, and this is actually a big, big deal.
7178980	7180900	We just don't have a lot, a lot of information.
7180980	7183380	Um, Assassin's Creed Valhalla was announced.
7183380	7186980	It's going to be like a Vikings, a Norse mythology kind of themed Assassin's Creed
7186980	7187380	game, right?
7187380	7191380	It's, uh, going to make a God of War game where they just aren't making the God of War
7191380	7195620	game, but yeah, they did the, um, whole cinematic trailer this week.
7195620	7200180	And then part of the Xbox thing that they're doing next week, they're going to show gameplay.
7200900	7202020	Oh, okay.
7202020	7202900	Oh, that might be one.
7202900	7203140	Okay.
7203140	7206900	So that's one of the games that, uh, Microsoft's going to show them at that event.
7206900	7207700	Good to know.
7207700	7213380	Um, so yeah, but, uh, I I'm curious if it'll have like a rich history mode, like Odyssey
7213380	7216900	had, you know how, like they, they really tried to make Assassin's Creed more than just
7216900	7218260	like the single player campaign.
7218260	7219460	I think it could be very interesting.
7220420	7223220	So we'll see more details to come.
7223220	7225060	We just know the basic, basic stuff right now.
7225620	7226020	All right.
7226020	7228980	Let's travel around the world and check out release dates.
7228980	7232980	Uh, Loki, we'll start with the U S I don't even know if we have any games coming out,
7232980	7237460	but, um, well, we, we have a few things, so not a whole lot.
7238420	7246900	We've got John Wick hacks on PlayStation four and void bastards on Nintendo switch and PlayStation
7246900	7247400	four.
7248580	7249140	And that's it.
7250340	7250580	Yeah.
7250580	7252260	A little bit of a slower week right now.
7252260	7254980	Um, especially when most of the game stores are closed.
7254980	7257860	Well, I guess in some, some States are starting to open that type of stuff back up.
7257860	7258180	Huh?
7258180	7262180	So I keep, you know, my, my perspective is very California and we're probably going to
7262180	7263780	be the last state to reopen.
7263860	7264340	And I'm okay.
7267460	7267620	Hmm.
7267620	7268260	All right.
7268260	7269780	Well, anyhow, moving on to Japan.
7269780	7273540	Honestly, when I look at Japanese releases, I don't see anything on the Nintendo switch
7273540	7276260	and that's probably just, you know, again, do the situation.
7276260	7278580	And this is empty on PlayStation four as well.
7278580	7282980	You know, I'm looking at an importer website, so I don't know if, um, the imports are just
7282980	7285380	slowing down because of what's going on, which should be understandable.
7285380	7289220	But according to my list, as it currently stands, we don't have any releases in Japan
7289220	7289780	right now.
7289780	7292180	And that just could be because of the world situation.
7292180	7293460	Um, so that's all I got.
7293460	7294180	How about the UK?
7295220	7296980	Nothing in the UK either.
7296980	7297940	All right.
7297940	7301620	It's going to be going to be a slow month until we get to the other end of this stuff.
7301620	7301940	All right.
7301940	7305540	Uh, this would be the part of the show where we would usually read emails, which actually
7305540	7309940	I'm going to check again, cause I checked before the show and we didn't have any emails.
7309940	7312900	Um, but somebody actually asked for the address at the top of the show.
7312900	7315540	So I'm wondering if they didn't write in during the show.
7315540	7320260	And since we don't have Jamie with us tonight, we're going to have a little less content.
7320260	7323060	Uh, Loki, can you buy me time while I put, pull up the emails?
7323220	7326420	Cause I wasn't originally planning to, but I think somebody emailed.
7327620	7328180	Yes.
7328180	7335220	So as you may know, um, we, I think we may have even been last week, uh, Rick may, who,
7335220	7341540	uh, voice the soldier in team fortress two passed away, um, a few weeks ago, actually
7341540	7342420	on April 13th.
7342980	7350740	And, um, because of this to memorialize or tribute Rick may, um, now in team fortress
7350740	7355140	two valve has updated Memorial statues featuring a soldier as a tribute.
7355780	7361780	Um, so those are going to be in game, I guess, at least through the month of may in honor
7361780	7363620	of the passing of the voice actor.
7364740	7365940	That's a very nice gesture.
7366580	7366900	All right.
7366900	7367460	We do this.
7367460	7368820	Well, actually we do have a lot of emails.
7368820	7371380	I'm glad I went back and looked because before the show, we didn't have anything.
7371380	7374020	Now we have like three, so we've got a lot of emails to get through.
7374020	7375780	Let's get to it and you can email us as well.
7375780	7378100	Participate at orange laundry.com.
7378100	7379380	We love getting emails.
7379380	7380020	Here we go.
7380020	7381940	First email from Frodo swagons.
7381940	7385700	Hey all, there are a couple of games coming up that look pretty interesting to me.
7385700	7389060	Was wondering if you've heard of them and or what you think of them.
7389060	7391540	Minecraft dungeons is the first one.
7391540	7393700	Uh, I'm going to just jump in and answer this right now.
7393700	7397380	I already have that downloaded via Xbox game pass to my Xbox one.
7397380	7401620	I'm, I'm pretty hyped for my craft dungeon because it speaks to two of my interests.
7401620	7404500	I'm, I'm kind of a casual on Minecraft.
7404500	7408260	I don't, but I think it's cool, but I love Diablo.
7408260	7412500	And so I'm all about like a new, like triple a dungeon explore.
7412500	7415060	I've been trying to fill the gap with some of the other,
7415060	7418020	like there's plenty of roguelikes and dungeon explorers out there.
7418020	7423220	Things like dead cells, wizard of legend, and all those games are great, but I'm,
7423220	7426980	I'm looking to see what a big name like Minecraft kind of brings to the table.
7426980	7430580	So yes, um, usually when we get the emails, I'm always kind of like, no,
7430580	7431860	I haven't heard a lot about, no, this one.
7431860	7432580	Yes, I have.
7432580	7433620	Uh, Loki, what about you?
7434660	7435780	I'm interested in it.
7435780	7437460	I haven't purchased it at all.
7437460	7439220	Do you know if there's a cross play on that at all?
7440100	7440980	Good question.
7440980	7442420	I'm not sure off the top of my head.
7442420	7443860	I think I don't see why not.
7445060	7446580	It's got to have PC and Xbox.
7446580	7448740	It's a Microsoft game essentially at the end of the day.
7449540	7451940	Oh, um, yeah, I'll probably pick it up on PC.
7451940	7455060	Uh, and I know Frodo, you didn't ask, but our chat room is popping in too.
7455060	7456580	And every gamer gets a voice here.
7456580	7459220	So SGA 100 Matt says Minecraft dungeons looks great.
7459220	7460660	Diablo with Minecraft.
7460660	7460980	Yeah.
7460980	7463060	I thought, I thought it looked cool too.
7463060	7466420	Um, Loki, I know you and your family play Minecraft sometimes.
7466420	7468340	So I thought maybe dungeons might interest you.
7468340	7469300	So there you go.
7469300	7473060	The other game we played this week, I did play Minecraft a little bit.
7473060	7473560	Oh, did you?
7474260	7474900	That's right.
7474900	7476420	You have a server up now, don't you?
7476420	7477300	Or is that not public?
7477300	7479140	Yeah, it's realms.
7479140	7482900	So it's like, uh, it's like a server, but smaller scale.
7482900	7486500	It's up to 10 or 15 people.
7486500	7489700	I can't remember what the, I think it's 10 that you pay.
7489700	7492820	And it's like, like eight bucks a month or something like that.
7492820	7497540	And it's officially sanctioned like through the actual, uh, Minecraft stuff.
7497540	7500180	But yeah, we only do it because it's up to you of us.
7500180	7500500	Okay.
7500500	7502420	Is it just your family or like?
7502420	7504100	Yeah, just myself and the kids.
7504100	7504340	Okay.
7504340	7505460	Cause I was gonna say, I'll come crash.
7505460	7506900	If it's a family thing, I won't come crash.
7506900	7507860	No, you can come crash.
7508420	7508900	Yeah.
7508900	7509700	I don't know what I do.
7509700	7513220	I dig, I dig a big hole in the ground and live, live in it.
7513220	7514180	Like I play Minecraft.
7514180	7515620	Like I'm a fucking ant.
7515620	7517540	Like, no.
7517540	7520740	And here I said, you know, I didn't really play much in Minecraft.
7520740	7521780	We actually, no, we did.
7521780	7524180	We did take on the Ender Dragon this week.
7524180	7525860	So, um, that was fun.
7525860	7530660	So we did that as a family and now, um, the kids want to build the wither to
7530660	7531460	fight the wither.
7531460	7534420	So, um, I was helping them with that.
7535140	7535460	All right.
7535460	7539140	Um, now the chat room is pulling through by doing live fact checking for us.
7539140	7539700	Thank you, chat.
7539700	7540340	Love you.
7540340	7545220	Uh, Questbuster says cross play, not at launch, but Mojang said they will be
7545220	7546340	working on it post.
7546980	7548500	So, all right.
7548500	7549460	There's that.
7549460	7549700	All right.
7549700	7552740	Anyhow, the other game, I'm moving back to Frodo's Wagon's email.
7552740	7555060	The other game is Assassin's Creed Valhalla.
7555060	7556100	Have you heard of this one?
7556660	7558100	Funny you should bring this up now.
7558100	7559300	Uh, we just talked about it.
7559300	7562420	I never got to be a big fan of the assassin games, but this game looks pretty
7562420	7563140	damn good.
7563140	7567140	I was a big fan of the Vikings series and this looks to be right up that alley.
7567140	7570020	I'm not a hundred percent sure on this, but I heard when you buy a copy of the
7570020	7572420	game on Xbox that you get two different versions.
7572420	7576740	One version for all Xbox consoles up to the Xbox one X and one version that is
7576740	7579620	only for the series X with all of the extra power.
7579700	7583380	If that is true, it's kind of cool how Microsoft is going about that, including
7583380	7584180	all of that.
7584180	7586500	Anyway, hope all is well Frodo's wagons.
7586500	7589780	Actually, I believe it's actually kind of the opposite.
7589780	7593940	It's that you buy one copy of the game and it's automatically upgraded to the
7593940	7599220	Xbox series X version when you upgrade your console, because that's what
7599220	7601780	Microsoft's been flexing on some of their games, right?
7601780	7604740	Like, like Halo is going to or Halo six, whatever they're calling it.
7605700	7607300	Infinite is going to be the same thing, right?
7607300	7608980	Like you can play it on an Xbox one X.
7609060	7613380	And when you buy it there, it automatically transfers to series X.
7613380	7618020	And the reality is Microsoft really wants you to play that stuff on game pass
7618020	7619700	so they can get money from you every month.
7619700	7623700	And it obviously those will be upgraded depending on whatever console you're on.
7624340	7627940	But I believe Assassin's Creed is actually, you just buy it once and now
7627940	7629140	you'll have it on all consoles.
7629140	7629940	Am I wrong on that?
7630900	7631300	Thank you.
7631300	7632260	I don't remember.
7632260	7633780	DJ Rama S says correct.
7633780	7633940	Okay.
7633940	7634740	That's what I thought.
7634740	7634980	Yeah.
7634980	7638580	And because that's, that's supposed to be a big draw about the game for
7638580	7642980	Microsoft and one that Sony kind of hasn't answered yet.
7642980	7648260	Although we know that unlike this last time, Sony fully intends to have
7648260	7651300	PlayStation four games be playable on PlayStation five.
7651300	7655220	Remember there was that whole kind of awkward top 100 games comment that
7655220	7657060	they had to kind of go back and clarify.
7657060	7660180	No, they're trying to get everything, but you know, they're just, they have
7660180	7661860	their priorities, you know, that whole thing.
7661860	7665780	So we know things like last of us to Final Fantasy seven remake, the
7665780	7669940	recent shit it's going to play on PlayStation five, will it, will it be.
7670900	7671220	I'm sorry.
7672260	7672980	Read into it.
7672980	7675300	Like, uh, that they were going to ignore all that stuff.
7675300	7678580	It's just that, you know, like Microsoft, they have so much that they've
7678580	7682260	started with, you know, making backwards compatible and then they're rolling
7682260	7684180	other stuff out as they get through it.
7684180	7685780	But, you know, obviously they have their priorities.
7686420	7686980	Yeah.
7686980	7688420	So awesome.
7688420	7690900	I just closed the mailbag before I got to the next email.
7691620	7695220	Uh, do you, have you been given any thought Loki too, if you're going to
7695220	7698740	pick up PlayStation five, Xbox one X, like, do you think any of that is in
7698740	7699780	your future this year?
7700580	7702820	Uh, I don't know.
7702820	7706900	Maybe Xbox that's kind of, I don't know on the fence of that.
7706900	7709620	Cause I do have a PC, so I can just pick up stuff on there.
7709620	7709940	True.
7709940	7713940	Um, but, uh, PlayStation, maybe, I don't know.
7713940	7715140	Have to see what they actually have.
7716020	7716500	Okay.
7716500	7717380	Sounds good.
7717380	7718980	Um, come on.
7718980	7721460	Now, of course, now that I need to get it back into the mailbag, I'm
7721460	7722820	getting the whole spinning thing.
7722820	7723060	All right.
7723060	7723620	There we go.
7723620	7724100	Finally.
7724100	7725060	Good heavens.
7725060	7725380	Okay.
7725940	7732340	Our next email comes to us from Pixel Pacas who says, hi, OLR.
7732900	7735940	I wanted to let y'all know about a really great game that came out
7735940	7736500	recently.
7736500	7741060	It's a visual novel called A Summer's End and focuses on the budding
7741060	7746020	romance between two women living in Hong Kong during the 1980s.
7746020	7748740	Well, that is a very kind of niche sort of thing.
7748740	7752660	I can't think of a lot of games that have taken on, uh, same sex female
7752660	7754900	relationships in Hong Kong in the 1980s.
7754900	7757620	Uh, are there other video games that cover that, that you can think of
7757620	7758020	Logie?
7759380	7759620	No.
7759620	7760660	So this may be a first.
7760660	7760980	I don't know.
7760980	7762420	No, that, but you know what?
7762420	7765460	I also like, it might, you might think I'm making fun of it.
7765460	7766740	I'm really not.
7766740	7772900	Like I really fucking love games that make you consider differently or
7772900	7776260	tell a different story that you might not have thought of otherwise.
7776260	7779460	So already in this first paragraph, you have my attention.
7780660	7784580	Visual novels are a genre pretty close to my heart and I play them all
7784580	7785380	the time.
7785380	7788420	For those who have never played the genre, there are a surprising
7788420	7791300	amount of titles focused on LGBTQ themes.
7791300	7795380	With that being said, most of these visual novels depict absolutely no
7795380	7797060	conflict around being gay.
7797060	7800020	This is a wonderful fantasy, but certainly doesn't reflect many
7800020	7801540	people's actual experiences.
7802260	7807220	A Summer's End uses both the timeframe and setting to make the storyline
7807220	7810100	more realistic than most visual novels.
7810100	7814100	The protagonist must come to terms with her sexuality and decide whether
7814100	7818420	to live her own truth or live with her mother's traditional expectations.
7818420	7821860	Her struggles really echoed my own, which is something I've never felt
7821860	7823380	reflected in a game before.
7823380	7824420	Oh, okay.
7824420	7826900	So interesting that you call that out because you're right.
7827540	7830580	A lot of games, like, let's say like Dream Daddy.
7830580	7830820	Okay.
7831220	7834820	That's an extremely well-known visual novel game that takes on LGBT
7834820	7835220	themes.
7836260	7841060	And it's never like, okay, these dudes are gay.
7841060	7841620	Cool.
7841620	7844420	You know, it's accepted by everybody.
7844420	7847140	It's just the way it is in the game.
7847140	7851860	So we don't often really get to explore the reality for many of us that
7851860	7856020	are in the LGBT community where it's not always accepted by everyone
7856020	7856900	right away.
7856900	7859620	This game might make you experience that a little bit.
7859620	7862820	So where I said just a minute ago, you know, I like exploring these
7862820	7866260	types of things that I might not otherwise understand.
7866260	7868500	You know, I certainly don't know what it's like to be a woman in Hong
7868500	7869620	Kong in 1980s.
7870500	7875540	I may have some experience with, you know, being gay and coming out and
7875540	7880020	all that, but like, this is a game that a lot of people could maybe,
7880020	7882260	like, learn something from in a way.
7882260	7883780	And I think that's really cool about novels.
7883780	7887300	And I bet there's, I know there's all types of these games out there.
7887300	7887940	You know, I know that.
7888740	7892180	Steam just had like a freaking expo they were doing.
7892180	7899380	They were doing like a, it was like, it was a play on Ludum Dare was the
7899380	7899780	name of it.
7899780	7900900	Somebody in chat is going to yell it.
7900900	7902740	I know I should bring my chat window back up.
7902740	7907700	And Steam was having this big exhibition of all these visual novel games
7907700	7908500	recently.
7908500	7909220	And you know what?
7909220	7912500	I'm sure there's all sorts of themes that are explored in these games.
7912500	7914900	And it honestly, it's probably something I need to be a little more
7914900	7915620	familiar with.
7915620	7919460	But sometimes, like, seriously, if you went to Steam during this and saw
7919460	7923300	the list of games, it can almost be overwhelming.
7924100	7927620	It's like there's 500 visual novel games to choose from.
7927620	7932580	And it is overwhelming, but you know, it's very akin to walking into a
7932580	7933700	library.
7933700	7936580	Every book has some sort of story to tell.
7936580	7939940	And every game, even though I'm overwhelmed, like, Oh my God, 500
7939940	7942260	games, you know, to pick from, what do I do?
7942820	7944500	Every one of them has a story to tell.
7945140	7948100	And some of them may be things you've never experienced before.
7948100	7948500	Thank you.
7948500	7950020	PixelPakas is in chat right now.
7950020	7953300	It's Ludo Narakon, narrator, Narakon.
7953300	7953860	So thank you.
7953860	7954500	That was what I knew.
7954500	7957220	It was like a play on, like, I thought, like, Ludum Dare or something.
7957220	7957860	Okay.
7957860	7960180	Anyway, moving on with the rest of the email.
7961140	7963940	Just wanted to share this beautiful game with the OLR audience.
7963940	7967300	It's currently available on Steam for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
7967300	7970900	The developers want to bring it to consoles, but nothing is confirmed
7970900	7971300	yet.
7971300	7974260	That again from PixelPakas and the game one more time.
7974260	7975780	A Summer's End.
7975780	7976580	So cool.
7976580	7977700	I'm going to put that on my list.
7977700	7980500	So next time I get presented with a list of these 500 titles, I'll know
7980500	7981380	which one to look for.
7981380	7982020	So thank you.
7982660	7983300	You know what?
7983300	7988740	And sometimes these, like, I want to say, like, these, these lower stress
7988740	7992340	games, I don't know, maybe a novel can be very stressful.
7992340	7993300	Certainly they can.
7993300	7994580	But you guys know what I mean.
7994580	7998260	The games that always get dogged as walking simulators, like Edith Finch,
7999060	8002020	Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, Dear Esther, all those types of games
8002020	8004180	usually get, I know those aren't visual novels, but I think
8004180	8006820	what they have similarly is that those types of games always get
8006820	8009220	dogged on for not having much of a game behind it.
8009220	8013220	But the stories behind it and what you go through in the game is very
8013220	8013700	impressive.
8013700	8016820	And I think that's something that probably is a common thread between
8016820	8019540	this and visual novel games, is that visual novel games aren't
8019540	8021300	necessarily hard per se.
8021300	8024260	Although, I mean, if you think about it, games like King's Quest and that
8024260	8026340	shit back in the day was a visual novel, sort of, sort of.
8027460	8030020	And, you know, there's definitely stories to tell there.
8030020	8032420	Anyway, I could go on and on, but thank you for the recommendation.
8033140	8033460	All right.
8033460	8037620	And our last email tonight, last but not least, from YYR.
8038660	8039700	Hello, LR.
8040660	8043860	I cannot begin to tell you how excited I was that Kirby's Dream Land
8043860	8045780	was last week's classic game of the week.
8045780	8048420	It's one of my all-time favorite games on any platforms.
8049140	8052260	One of my favorite things about it, well, apart from the fantastic music,
8052260	8055060	some of the best graphics on the original Game Boy and the sheer joy
8055060	8057780	that comes from controlling that squishy puff ball is how the
8057780	8060100	developers made the game so customizable.
8060100	8062260	It can be as challenging or as easy as you want.
8062260	8063940	The base game is very easy.
8063940	8067380	An average Joe, who is even slightly competent at platforming and action
8067380	8069700	games, can complete it without much trouble.
8069700	8072900	But as was mentioned on last week's segment, when you complete the game,
8072900	8075460	you receive a code to unlock a much more difficult level.
8076100	8079380	Extra game, as this was called, was not simply a lazy tacked on mode
8079380	8082100	where enemies do more damage, although this is also true.
8082740	8086020	Most of the enemies either had entirely different behaviors or
8086020	8088180	completely replaced by new enemies.
8088180	8091700	All of the game's bosses had totally new patterns and attacks.
8091700	8094420	If anyone was disappointed by the default difficulty,
8094420	8096820	they'd generally be happy with this one.
8096820	8101700	But once you manage to complete extra game, you receive a second secret code.
8101700	8105300	This not only unlocks an awesome sound test feature, but also allows you
8105300	8108500	to customize the life bar and the number of lives you start with.
8108500	8111220	You can even combine this with extra game code if you want,
8111220	8114020	making the game's difficulty 100% customizable.
8114020	8117780	This was and still is a rarity in video gaming and serves to make the
8117780	8121060	game even more awesome than it otherwise was.
8121060	8124340	One of my favorite challenges is to play the easy difficulty,
8124340	8126660	but with only a single hit point.
8126660	8127620	Can you do it?
8127620	8128340	You ought to try.
8128980	8130900	Anyway, I'll end with an apology.
8130900	8134180	Sorry, but I have no plans to add the Super Scope support to
8134180	8135860	Sharpshooter Plus, darn.
8135860	8138180	But I hope that you'll continue to enjoy the game without it.
8138180	8138680	We will.
8139140	8143300	Actually, I do have a plan to add support for some other devices eventually,
8143300	8146820	possibly later this year, but, well, stay tuned.
8146820	8148820	Hope you're all staying happy and healthy.
8148820	8150180	Have a great week.
8150180	8153060	Sucking and spitting, Aaron, yyr.
8153060	8154180	Thanks for the note, yyr.
8154180	8154980	Appreciate it.
8154980	8158420	And yeah, go pick up Sharpshooter Plus if you haven't picked that up already.
8158420	8160020	And it's always great to hear from yyr.
8161540	8165220	You know what that kind of reminds me of when you talk about like a mode
8165220	8168020	that you run through it the second time and the enemies change?
8169860	8173060	Remember when you beat Super Mario Brothers for the first time?
8173060	8175220	You kind of got like the second quest.
8175220	8179620	You'd run through it again, but now the goombas are the little beetle dudes
8179620	8182420	and some things are faster and some things have changed.
8182420	8187140	I feel like the roots of that mode in Kirby are kind of rooted in what you
8187140	8189860	saw there in like Super Mario Brothers and earlier games like that.
8190900	8194180	And it's kind of, yeah, it's kind of something that was really unique to that
8194180	8197460	era, the 8-bit games, and I'm looping Game Boy in with 8-bit games,
8198100	8200900	kind of unique to that era we don't see as much of anymore.
8200900	8204900	I mean, we see like harder modes and things that get unlocked and so forth,
8205060	8208340	like, you know, replacing monsters, changing their behavior,
8208340	8209940	allowing you to customize things.
8210500	8213140	You didn't see that or you saw that more back in the day.
8213140	8216420	You don't see it as much now, but pretty cool.
8216420	8218500	Thanks. Thank you for the trip down memory lane.
8218500	8220740	I appreciate that. And I will share that with Jamie when I can.
8221540	8222980	All right. That is it for the email back.
8222980	8225780	So we had a lot of emails considering I looked before the show and there was none.
8225780	8227300	We got like three right at the buzzer there.
8227300	8228660	So I appreciate that, guys. Awesome.
8228660	8229780	Yeah. Awesome. All right.
8229780	8232820	Well, let's get back into a few more stories here before we wrap up for the night.
8232820	8234260	So, Loki, why don't you start us off?
8234980	8237380	So I've been wondering for a while, it's like,
8237380	8239620	when are we going to start using these amiibos again?
8239620	8244980	Because, you know, obviously, since we didn't really have much amiibo support,
8244980	8247220	or I don't think any. I don't know about you,
8247220	8251140	but I've finally been using those Animal Crossing ones I collected to get,
8251140	8254020	I guess, for Animal Crossing. All those posters. Yeah.
8254020	8257060	But I'm talking about like, you know, for like Mario Maker 2 and stuff.
8257060	8259700	So I was wondering, when's this going to happen?
8259700	8261780	Well, apparently that may be happening soon.
8261780	8266260	So thanks to a new patent filed by Nintendo,
8266260	8269940	it appears that amiibos are going to be back in a brand new game.
8272260	8276180	So the functionality, I can't really tell what they're doing with this.
8276180	8280100	For example, it looks like some sort of RPG or something like that.
8280980	8285620	They show like a picture of like playing as the squid kid or something like that.
8285620	8288900	So I'm wondering if this is going to somehow allow you to play as
8288900	8291540	different amiibo characters in certain games.
8292180	8298740	Um, pretty neat though. I'm not really sure what exactly it's supposed to be
8298740	8301540	that they're developing, but maybe we'll hear about that soon.
8302740	8306980	That could be really cool if that's like a Nintendo online thing,
8306980	8310340	that like you could download a free, you know, simple,
8310340	8314180	simple-ish RPG where your amiibo are the characters.
8314180	8316100	It makes me think there's this Disney game
8316660	8319140	they've been pushing on a lot of ad platforms lately.
8319140	8321300	That's essentially like an RPG with different characters.
8321380	8324260	It's all like a gacha mechanic, but you unlock different,
8324260	8326260	it's like Disney sorcery or something like that.
8326260	8328340	I don't know. I'm not going to, they're not paying me.
8328340	8330420	I'm not going to plug it, but they have something like that.
8330420	8333620	So I'm thinking like, what if like, okay, well, instead of like gacha,
8333620	8338820	what if Nintendo use like amiibo to kind of have their own type of like RPG game
8338820	8342260	that you could build your team and fight against other teams and things like that.
8342260	8344180	And maybe it's something they tied in Nintendo online.
8344180	8347060	It's like, here's another perk of being a Nintendo online subscriber.
8347060	8350820	Cause you know, we're going to have that year is about to come up again.
8350820	8354020	Many people got another year free thanks to Twitch prime,
8354020	8355700	but I'm going to guess that doesn't happen again.
8355700	8359140	So people are going to have to, you know, pay the money for another year
8359140	8361620	and people will probably do it just for animal crossing.
8362420	8365860	But you know, what, what other value are they going to bring to that Tetris 99?
8365860	8367380	That was a great one, but what else?
8367380	8371060	You know, cause the, the classic library, those wells have been drying up.
8372580	8373080	Yeah.
8373620	8378020	I don't know with all the Nintendo and super Nintendo games on there, man.
8378580	8381300	So it's a NES remix or super NES remix.
8382260	8385780	I know, but I take a amiibo based RPG.
8385780	8390340	Why not give me more value to all those little suckers that I spent all that money on?
8390340	8391220	I'd love it.
8391220	8395220	If they had like an amiibo RPG game, I'd already have like 200 characters.
8395220	8397860	It might not that many, but I'd have a lot.
8397860	8401060	I would have a lot considering all the characters that I have.
8401060	8403220	It might not support everything though.
8403220	8406660	Like they might not have the rights to use something like cloud.
8407460	8411780	Um, but they could probably use, I mean, the third party stuff.
8411780	8413380	There aren't a lot of those.
8413380	8416660	Most of them are based around Nintendo first party franchises and they can do whatever
8416660	8417380	they want with those.
8417380	8420020	So it'd be interesting to see if that actually happens.
8420580	8421300	All right.
8421300	8425540	Well, moving on to talk about Xbox game pass and how well it's been doing, uh, as of late,
8425540	8427060	you know, I, I was talking about game pass.
8427060	8428740	I was using it to play streets of rage four.
8429380	8430580	I think it's pretty neat.
8430580	8432900	And a lot of other people apparently tuning onto it as well.
8433460	8434260	Excuse me.
8434260	8436500	Game pass has over 10 million subscribers.
8436500	8439460	That's a pretty big landmark, 10 million people on game pass.
8439460	8443700	Uh, Phil Spencer, head of Xbox noted this recently in a new blog post talking about
8443700	8445700	how the service is continuing to grow.
8445700	8448580	That was up from 9.5 million last year.
8448580	8453780	Uh, and, uh, also in the blog post, it was noted subscribers are playing games twice
8453780	8457220	as much since the COVID 19 pandemic started.
8457220	8458820	And I'm kind of one of those people.
8459700	8463620	I wasn't really dipping into like deeply into the library.
8463620	8466180	I might check out a first party Microsoft title when it's released,
8466180	8468740	but I wasn't playing a lot of other stuff now.
8468740	8472820	I've been like, I've been going deep in that library and playing everything.
8472820	8476740	So, um, yeah, I think game pass has been great for me.
8476740	8480100	So, um, congrats to them on 10 million.
8480100	8482420	That means I think this is going to be around for awhile.
8482420	8488260	I'm very curious to see how they build this into the Xbox series X economy and
8488260	8493380	essentially if video games don't generally just go a Netflix direction like movies have.
8494100	8494580	We'll see.
8495220	8495860	We'll see.
8495860	8496100	Yeah.
8496100	8500980	I mean, definitely it would be a more appealing offer for me if they had more games on the
8500980	8502100	PC side of things.
8502100	8505700	Um, that may be why I may need to get one of the series X's.
8505700	8508420	Um, well that a 4k monitor, I would assume.
8509060	8510420	So, um, we'll see.
8510420	8513220	S2 and her mountain chat says I still don't have game pass.
8513220	8515060	I should probably get it at this rate.
8515060	8518900	My issue is that I'm trying to finish the game I already have before getting more.
8518900	8519460	Yeah.
8519460	8524420	Um, if you're worried about your backlog expanding, Xbox game pass isn't really going to help
8524420	8525220	with that.
8525220	8527300	Um, but it's still pretty impressive.
8527300	8532500	I also want my one other thing about game pass is that it's got a decent selection.
8532500	8540980	I wish it were a little larger because I feel like there's a very rich Xbox 360 and original
8540980	8545860	Xbox library that they haven't fully tapped into as much as they could.
8546580	8552420	Um, and maybe that's probably has to do with rights licenses and so forth, but even first
8552420	8557780	party Microsoft titles, we don't have enough of those on game pass.
8557780	8562260	And so that's maybe where I'd like to see game pass really round out because I'm telling,
8562260	8565220	you know, and I understand it's probably a little harder to get the current stuff it's
8565220	8570660	over, but like these Xbox 360 games that, you know, they probably don't make money anymore.
8570660	8572020	They're not selling them new.
8572020	8576100	They're probably only moving around on the third party market, maybe a few digital copies
8576100	8580020	here and there, but think about how much, you know, you might be able to make on a subscription
8580020	8583940	based thing where it's like, Oh, you know, all these games that I haven't touched in
8583940	8589540	like 10 years, I can go back and check out, you know, so it'd be cool.
8589540	8590580	So we'll see.
8590580	8591140	I do.
8591140	8593700	I still would recommend game pass as it is.
8593700	8594100	It's fine.
8594100	8598980	But I think, Ooh, if we could just like round out that library even more with like a stronger,
8598980	8600340	like retro ish.
8600340	8603060	It's weird to talk about Xbox 360 as retro, but that's what it is.
8604100	8604820	What was that again?
8604820	8610740	It was, uh, um, what the hell was the, uh, the Xbox arcade thing?
8610740	8611700	Oh, game room.
8611700	8612900	Oh, don't get me started.
8612900	8613940	Game room.
8613940	8614420	Come on.
8615060	8615700	I'd love it.
8615700	8620020	But the rights get complicated because of all the Atari games and all that stuff.
8620020	8621620	But yeah, we'll see.
8621620	8622820	We'll see what comes of that.
8622820	8623060	All right.
8623060	8623700	Moving on.
8623700	8624580	Do you want to do this Loki?
8624580	8627540	You want me to take it or the next story that Jamie had?
8627540	8628100	Okay.
8628100	8629540	Yeah, I can talk about it.
8629540	8637700	So, um, we've got the university of Utah, obviously not going to be able to hold their
8637700	8644260	graduation, um, live, um, at least outside when the world there, but apparently they're
8644260	8648660	going to be holding it digitally in a video game that they designed.
8649380	8654500	So, um, they're going to be able to join in, in that video game as different avatars and
8654500	8657060	be able to walk down the aisle.
8657060	8659620	And I don't know, this whole game looks like Roblox.
8659620	8660260	I swear to God.
8660260	8666900	But, uh, anyways, um, so yeah, they're going to be doing this digital ceremony and being
8666900	8670900	allowed, I guess also streaming on Twitch so that your family and friends can watch.
8672340	8672740	Cool.
8672740	8673380	Pretty neat.
8673940	8679220	Hey, it's making the best of a not so great situation, but you know, I know a lot of people
8679220	8682580	have been doing the zoom stuff to keep in touch and yeah, it's, it's cool.
8682580	8686500	So, you know, it's, it's something it's what we got to do in these times.
8686500	8691060	Just think I kind of like the, the lobbies and everything that they made, like, I don't
8691060	8694260	know, it looks like it's almost like unreal four or something, but yeah, it just looks
8694260	8698260	like people dressed up like in cosplay on most people, avatar things over their head.
8698260	8699860	But I don't know.
8699860	8700500	It's pretty cool.
8701060	8704660	Uh, Bobby Blackwolf and chat points out, I had a Facebook friend post about playing
8704660	8707780	retro classic games with their kid during shelter in place.
8707780	8709300	They were playing Wii bowling,
8709300	8715140	which I mean, we, what we bowling was 2006.
8715140	8716660	That's a 14 year old game.
8716660	8716980	Sorry.
8717860	8718740	Play what you got.
8718740	8722100	It's just funny to call it retro, but it is right.
8722100	8723780	It would qualify as classic game of the week.
8723780	8724340	Wouldn't it?
8724340	8725700	It's over 10 years old.
8726340	8726580	All right.
8726580	8730100	Which I'm actually, no, we say that I'm kind of surprised that hasn't come up maybe in
8730100	8730900	the future.
8730900	8731300	All right.
8731300	8735220	It may have, I'm surprised it hasn't been.
8735220	8736100	I don't think so.
8736100	8736580	I don't know.
8737300	8739140	There's always games that come up.
8739140	8740260	Just like, just like dark soccer.
8740260	8742900	Like a couple of weeks ago, she picked a game where it's like, how have I never picked this
8742900	8743400	game?
8743780	8744500	It just happens.
8744500	8746100	There's, there's a lot of games out there.
8746100	8746660	All right.
8746660	8748660	Uh, moving on just a couple more stories for you guys.
8748660	8749160	Loki.
8750100	8750900	All right.
8750900	8753780	So let's talk a little bit about Nintendo again.
8753780	8760980	And unfortunately, since you may not be using, um, the Wii U very much, their eShop is of
8760980	8763060	course closing July 31st.
8763060	8768020	Same with Nintendo 3DS, uh, July 31st in some countries.
8768020	8769300	So not everywhere.
8769300	8777700	Um, several countries in the Caribbean and Latin America are closing shop there.
8777700	8783300	Um, there's too many to list fortunately, but it is unfortunate those are closing.
8784020	8786420	I guess you just got to move on to the new platforms.
8787300	8792900	Um, yeah, both shops in Mexico and Brazil will be exempt from these closures.
8794020	8794500	Yeah.
8794500	8799140	So I'm not terribly surprised to hear about Wii U and again, this is other countries,
8799140	8800180	not the US.
8800180	8805060	I'm not terribly surprised to hear about Wii U going away because I think Nintendo is ready
8805060	8806740	to let that shit go.
8806740	8807940	Um, which it does.
8808500	8811140	Wii U still has a great virtual console library.
8811140	8814900	Wii U still has some good, you know, especially the fact that Wii U kind of emulates Wii.
8814900	8819460	There's still a lot of things to like about it, but, um, you know, I, I it's kind of one
8819460	8820260	of those, I get it.
8820260	8823860	Nintendo is ready to be rid of the ghost of the Wii U.
8823860	8828900	I'm a little more surprised about 3DS because I feel like Nintendo is still kind of been
8828900	8830260	pushing that device.
8830820	8835540	And again, we have to stress it's other countries right now, but I still feel, I feel like the
8835540	8841620	last time this happened with the Wii shop, the US and Europe and Japan were not far behind.
8843060	8844260	Am I, am I just crazy?
8844260	8845380	Am I remembering this a different way?
8845380	8847700	But I feel like this is very similar to what happened before.
8849460	8849780	Right.
8849780	8850260	Yeah.
8850260	8854420	It wasn't that far long after that the days ended up shutting that stuff down.
8854420	8855380	I think so.
8855380	8858340	So, I mean, even though it's not the US and Europe, it might be.
8858340	8863540	So I'm just saying if you have points, you got gift cards, you might want to just go
8863540	8864660	find something to buy.
8864660	8868020	There's still, there's still a lot of good stuff on Wii U and so forth and 3DS.
8868020	8869300	Go find it, go buy it.
8869300	8873780	Cause can't guarantee it's going to be there much longer and show those developers a little
8873780	8876260	love who probably haven't had their games sell in a while.
8876260	8877060	So, all right.
8877940	8881460	Uh, one systems games, you're not going to be able to find on virtual console though,
8881460	8884500	which is a shame is the Atari 2600.
8884500	8886820	Well, I guess they do have those flashback games.
8886820	8887540	Right.
8887540	8890580	But, um, I haven't played the latest flashback series.
8890580	8895380	There's like a three volume flashback series, but I've been a little on the, I, I feel
8895380	8897700	like they might, I don't know.
8897700	8900580	I feel like the breaking it up into three volumes isn't the way to do it.
8900580	8900980	We'll see.
8900980	8901700	I don't know.
8901700	8903700	Anyway, but that's not what this is about.
8903700	8907780	This is about using the Atari 2600 to teach AI.
8908580	8914820	So a team of Uber AI researchers developed a system called go explore.
8915860	8919540	It will beat any Atari 2600 game.
8919540	8921140	I don't know what they mean by any though.
8921140	8924660	Cause there was, there was a lot of bullshit Atari 2600 games.
8924660	8930500	So I, does it really mean any, I guess we'll see, uh, with super, you can see the receipts.
8930500	8930660	Yeah.
8930660	8933620	I want to see the receipts with superhuman scores.
8933700	8939060	Including ones where the AI previously could not beat real players.
8939940	8944580	It's a system that remembers promising States and return to those States before it goes
8944580	8945460	out exploring.
8947380	8953700	It's been improved over older AI, like deep mind, uh, on games like Monzuma's revenge
8953700	8956660	and got a near perfect pitfall score.
8956660	8961620	Uh, so it's, it's interesting to see there's a full series of tweets on this.
8961700	8965940	And if you want to see the user's account, Jeff Klune, uh, is obviously one of the people
8965940	8966420	working on it.
8966420	8968420	Cause it's his, uh, Twitter account.
8968420	8973300	Uh, and he puts in a tweet, go explore now solves all unsolved Atari games.
8973300	8977060	Here's a little asterisk with it because it probably won't do beat him and eat him.
8977060	8978180	It's just not going to do that.
8978180	8978500	Okay.
8978500	8985300	It's good, but it might play other games, uh, handles, uh, sto stochastic training throughout
8985300	8990660	via goal condition policies, reuses skills to intelligently explore after returning and
8990660	8994180	solves hard exploration, simulated robot tasks.
8994180	9000260	And so there's a whole bunch of tweets on this and videos that you can see this AI getting
9000260	9002500	better and better with Atari 2,600.
9002500	9006740	And you know, a lot of those Atari 2,600 games were fairly simple.
9006740	9012260	And I think that's what makes this notable is that it's not just doing one thing.
9012260	9014740	Well, chess is pretty simple, right?
9014740	9019940	And we know there's great chess AI out there, but now AI is evolving into this.
9019940	9021940	It can do a variety of things.
9021940	9026980	Well, there's still simple relatively, but it has a pattern that it learns from and it
9026980	9027780	builds on that.
9028500	9033300	And so it's almost one of those things where you have to wonder how much further behind
9033300	9035780	are going to be more complicated games.
9035780	9038180	How many are going to play eat and hate humanity, right?
9040580	9045300	It's going to go, it's going to play ET and then grow sentient and try to destroy humans.
9045300	9046180	Why, why not?
9046180	9046740	Why not?
9046740	9048980	Just, why don't you throw that on 2020 as well?
9048980	9049860	How about, how about it?
9049860	9050500	Come on.
9050500	9051460	Cylon attack.
9051460	9051860	Why not?
9055380	9055940	There you go.
9055940	9057540	I think, I think that's a neat story though.
9058660	9063300	The AI stuff is very fascinating and it kind of makes my head hurt, but it's cool stuff.
9064020	9067220	So that is it for the news that we had scheduled tonight.
9067220	9070820	If you guys have any questions for us, I will open up the listener roundtable for a moment
9070820	9074740	in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
9074740	9077460	If you have anything you want to ask or any statements you want to make, we'll have a
9077460	9078820	quick round table.
9078820	9081940	Otherwise I'll check in with Loki to see if there's any last minute stories.
9081940	9084340	I kind of feel like I haven't already covered.
9085220	9088340	I've got to feel like we covered a lot of the big, it was kind of a, I don't want to
9088340	9092420	say it was a slow news week, but it's, it's slowing down because I think people aren't
9092420	9094260	working as much or as fast.
9094260	9100660	And now, well, I mean the gaming industry in general, in the summer of games festival
9100660	9106260	time now, I expect things might pick up in that timeframe where E3 would have been.
9106260	9110420	And certainly, you know, for this four month period or whatever, uh, but we're very much
9110420	9113540	in a quiet period right now, but I guess things are going to pick up with this week.
9113540	9114500	We get the Xbox stuff.
9114500	9115780	That's going to be a pretty big deal.
9115780	9116260	Yeah.
9116260	9117620	So I'm excited to see that.
9117620	9118340	Yeah.
9118340	9121540	Uh, any, any wishlist game on the new Xbox for you?
9122900	9124660	I talk, I keep talking about fable.
9124660	9125300	What about for you?
9125300	9126660	What would be cool like that?
9126660	9129700	I mean, that's really kind of, I'd be interested in fable.
9129700	9135300	I don't really know what else I would, maybe they'll bring back cameo.
9135940	9136500	I don't know.
9136500	9140020	Hey, maybe, maybe, uh, for some motorsport for me.
9140020	9140500	Oh yeah.
9140500	9140820	I'm sorry.
9140820	9141940	Not sorry.
9141940	9147140	Forza Horizon for me, not so much motorsport because I don't do the sim games as well as
9147140	9149380	I do the arcade games, but I do.
9149380	9154420	I realize motorsport is probably going to be first, but that doesn't mean I don't want
9154420	9158740	a Forza Horizon game at some point, or at least an arcade eraser type of game.
9159380	9160020	That's for sure.
9160020	9160580	Yeah.
9160580	9160820	Yeah.
9161620	9165620	But I, I, I would think fable would be a great thing to come out of the gate with if that
9165620	9167220	is something in their sleeve.
9167220	9169940	So I would love to see like Forza and fable.
9170660	9173940	And I guess Assassin's Creed Valhalla will be a game that they're going to show.
9173940	9175060	We already kind of know that.
9175060	9176260	So we'll see.
9176260	9180180	Oh, the only little bit I did see here real quick as I was browsing through things.
9180180	9180420	Yeah.
9180420	9183460	Burnout paradise remastereds coming on the switch on June 19th.
9184340	9185540	They were 50 bucks for it.
9186340	9186580	Yeah.
9186580	9187460	I'm not worth it.
9187460	9188740	Just buy it on PC for that.
9188740	9189780	Like 20 bucks.
9189780	9190260	You might want it.
9190260	9190660	Well, I don't know.
9190660	9192820	Maybe the portability is that important to some people.
9192820	9195700	I might, I'm going to, I'm going to wait for a discount.
9195700	9200900	I hope, I hope this doesn't cause EA to go see Nintendo sucks.
9200900	9203140	Cause our game didn't sell well on there.
9203140	9203780	Fuck off.
9205780	9210740	To where they think, why isn't there a game from like, I don't even know how old that
9210740	9213540	is that like super old already.
9213540	9218820	Like was it selling, you know, it's been a few years since the remastered came out and
9219460	9220660	now it's coming out on the switch.
9220660	9221940	Oh, well, sorry.
9221940	9223780	You know, maybe you should have put it out sooner.
9223780	9224100	Yeah.
9224100	9226740	They need to not set themselves up for disaster.
9226740	9230020	Maybe they want to milk the hardest of the hardcore or something.
9230020	9234260	I don't know what their logic is first, but if that game doesn't come down in price pretty
9234260	9236580	fast, they're, they're not being smart about it.
9236580	9237620	So yeah.
9237620	9240820	And SGL 100, Matt says, I'm more worried about them saying burnout is dead.
9240820	9242340	Why should we make a new one?
9242340	9245220	Like look at your idiot launch strategy.
9245220	9247140	Maybe go to that first.
9247140	9247540	Jeez.
9248980	9249620	We'll see.
9249620	9249940	All right.
9249940	9250500	Anything else?
9251300	9251940	That's it.
9251940	9252180	All right.
9252180	9256020	Well, I think we're going to go ahead and wrap up and call it a night here at orange
9256020	9256820	launch radio.
9256820	9260180	Hey, thank you guys for tuning into our show, whether you were here live or whether you
9260180	9261860	joined us on the podcast feed.
9261860	9263140	Really appreciate you being here.
9263140	9266980	I know the show felt a little bit off tonight and hopefully I'll be able to tell you more
9267620	9271860	later on, but, um, you know, just definitely thinking of a dark soccer and the family right
9271860	9272420	now.
9272420	9275220	Um, and, uh, hopefully she's back next week.
9275220	9275860	I don't know.
9275860	9276740	Hard to say.
9276740	9280500	Um, but we'll, we'll keep providing a show for you guys to get us through these tough
9280500	9282980	times, uh, one way or the other.
9282980	9286420	Um, in the meantime, thanks again for tuning in and listening.
9286420	9289540	If you liked what you heard here at orange Ontario, please tell a friend about the show.
9289540	9292740	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we
9292740	9294740	have to have the voices here to hear them.
9294740	9299780	Um, so a nice five star review wherever you found this show goes a long way on auto host
9299780	9300900	on Twitch or raid.
9300900	9301940	I saw raid come in tonight.
9301940	9302820	Thank you so much for that.
9302820	9304820	Uh, all that type of stuff goes a long way.
9304980	9306100	Thank you, thank you, thank you.
9306100	9310180	Um, for those of you that go the extra mile to support orange on radio, we really appreciate
9310180	9310900	you.
9310900	9314020	Um, otherwise, Loki, do you have a final thought for us tonight?
9314980	9316660	No, that's pretty much it.
9316660	9320340	I'm going to try to, uh, try to work on my game this week.
9320340	9322260	Cross my fingers, then we'll do it.
9322900	9325140	If not, I'll just work on some step mania songs.
9326180	9330020	Um, and then my final thought is, um, I know it's almost nine o'clock, but I hope I can
9330020	9334500	find a one star raid somewhere nearby, uh, so I can move on in my Pokemon go quests.
9334900	9338500	Because the research is limited time, you know, so I got to make sure I finished that
9338500	9339540	before wet, like Friday.
9339540	9344660	So try to get on that, but I'm glad they're not just doing a gen one event and we get
9344660	9346660	gen two next week and gen three the week out.
9346660	9349140	Thank gosh for a little diversity of my Pokemans.
9349140	9350100	I appreciate that.
9350740	9354100	All right, that's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio until next
9354100	9354340	week.
9354900	9357940	Take care, have fun gaming online.
9357940	9363460	Um, stay safe everybody, uh, as more and more States and things start to open up.
9363460	9370100	Um, just, you know, listen to doctors, listen to science, be safe, protect yourself, wash
9370100	9371620	your hands, all that good stuff.
9372260	9373060	Take care of yourself.
9373060	9374020	That's the most important thing.
9374020	9374980	We'll see you in seven days.
9374980	9375300	Goodbye.
