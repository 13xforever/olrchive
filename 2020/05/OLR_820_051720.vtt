Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight. Episode number 820 for this May 17th of 2020.

00:45.000 --> 00:58.000
My name is Rob Roberts joining you from the studio where over the last 18 or so years, we've gathered over the last 18 or so years to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:58.000 --> 01:08.000
Of course, with the way things are in the world today, we are practicing social distancing. Therefore, my co-hosts are joining me on Skype. So say hello of course to Techmaster Loki.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Hello.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Hi Loki, how are you doing?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
I'm doing good.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Alright, hanging in there throughout all this?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Yeah, doing my best.

01:16.000 --> 01:26.000
Yeah, did you take the kids anywhere exciting? A park or I guess there's just not a lot to, I'm like, what are you going to say? I took them to a trampoline park? I don't know. I'm just hoping there's some exciting story.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
No, they're over at their grandparents house right now.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
Oh, that's good. That's good. Quality, quality, quality time and all that is good. So, alright.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Yeah.

01:35.000 --> 01:42.000
I also want to welcome back to the show this week. Say hello, everybody. Give a warm welcome to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Hi.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Hello, welcome back.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Thank you.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
We missed you.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Happy to be back. What did you throw?

01:49.000 --> 02:04.000
Hot pot of coffee. No, I'm just kidding. So I told the listeners what was going on. I don't know if there's anything you want to say about it, but obviously the floor is yours if you wanted to say anything or say nothing at all. I can go to the next topic.

02:04.000 --> 02:20.000
Well, I, I felt it would be good just to give some background and bear it a little bit, you know, because it's been, I haven't really been too super up and up on the whole scenario because my dad is in Alabama and I'm not here in California.

02:20.000 --> 02:28.000
So I will, I'll go a little bit into not too much detail, but enough detail. How's that sound?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Sure, whatever you're comfortable with.

02:30.000 --> 02:41.000
Well, um, about, had it been right before I got my current jobs maybe five or six years ago, my dad had a stroke in his 50s.

02:41.000 --> 02:52.000
He had done a lot of drugs, it was the 70s and he likes drugs capital D drugs to quote, Dennis Leary. I'm sorry, Dr. Dennis Leary.

02:52.000 --> 03:00.000
And so, as it stands, you know, lots of hard living can catch up to you chain smoking.

03:00.000 --> 03:09.000
I mean my dad cheated death, a lot when he was a teenager and early adult I mean he crashed his motorcycle so many times, I'm sure he's hit his head more than a few times.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
So, he had a stroke.

03:13.000 --> 03:21.000
He nearly died. My, my youngest sister gave the resuscitation order for him, and he was never the same after that.

03:21.000 --> 03:37.000
He was paralyzed on one side, he was doing better for a while and then he just, because he, some of his brain function had been decreased because of the stroke and a consequent, you know, you know you have another, you can have another stroke after you've had the stroke

03:37.000 --> 03:49.000
so, so he wasn't getting, he had clogged arteries his heart was a mess. I mean, my dad was, I don't know he was being held together with duct tape and chicken wire, as we like to say back in the south.

03:49.000 --> 03:59.000
Like some computers I've used. So, like the OLR studio computer Yes. Yeah, no that one's shiny and new. I'm proud of that little.

04:00.000 --> 04:07.000
Well, remember there's two, there's there's the new one that powers the video and the old one still powers me and my stories so yes.

04:07.000 --> 04:21.000
Yeah, oh girl we need to get you upgraded. It's the most well and it's all I mean folks have been kind enough to send upgrades but it's the most Voltron PC you'll ever see in your life of old shit and new shit, like duct tape together.

04:21.000 --> 04:31.000
Anyway, I'm sorry, I don't mean to do right now. I'm sorry, you've now inspired me to, to write like a fan story of like duct tape Gundam. So, filing that away.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Done.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
All right, so anyway.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
So my dad.

04:37.000 --> 04:56.000
He and I never did see eye to eye he was you know, Southern pretty, you know, to him it was normal for everybody else who has a conscience, it's racist, homophobic, you name it and by the way, hype mayhem vehicle Voltron is my favorite don't listen to.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
So, and necessary 100 miles says the show PC is now called duct tape Gundam, I approve.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
Yeah, I second motion passes. Anyway, back to topic.

05:08.000 --> 05:23.000
The way that you know things when is it my dad eventually is his attitude got worse and worse he was moved from, you know, one place to the other, he had to have a total hip replacement last year, and then you know my granny died, five years ago.

05:23.000 --> 05:36.000
She got well not five years ago, gosh, three and a half years ago because she died right after grandmama did you remember I was a mess up for that, I remember this all happening because obviously this show has been around and you know, again, I want to remind

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
people, it is a video game podcast but because you know the family that we've built up here on Sunday nights.

05:43.000 --> 05:56.000
You know, we've all gone through a lot of deep stuff in our lives so sometimes this podcast is a way to kind of share that with you which is what Jamie's doing now, but I, I remember because of this show, when all that was happening because it was, I feel like you

05:56.000 --> 06:04.000
had you had to deal with a lot like back to back to back relatively. Oh yeah, I was in some hardcore therapy after that.

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
And just for anyone who's wondering I have an appointment with my shrink scheduled for next week. Thank you.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
Anyway, um, but you know after granny died.

06:13.000 --> 06:21.000
Dad got significantly worse and my sister Shelley was taking care of dad's needs and in mobile.

06:21.000 --> 06:29.000
And she was having to drive in from Foley which was, you know, like an hour or so drive into mobile to take care of dad but she did it every day and she's a high school teacher.

06:29.000 --> 06:36.000
So kudos to my sister Shelley you are amazing and I know she's not listening because she doesn't do video games.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
But as things go.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
The show that I was last on being the week before last.

06:45.000 --> 06:57.000
I'm sure as people notice during the show I vanished. I was like, I all because I got a call from my sister, saying that dad was in the hospital with respiratory issues.

06:57.000 --> 07:04.000
And of course the first thing that everyone thinks is the code. Does he have the, you know, the ronas.

07:04.000 --> 07:21.000
And so she couldn't even go in to see him after he was in the hospital, and dad had a very strict DNR do not resuscitate order, so that he couldn't be intubated they there was going to be no ventilation form or anything if he was going to die he was going

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
to die.

07:23.000 --> 07:41.000
And as it turned out, he didn't have coded and one of the nurses, very graciously pulled some strings to get him in a private room, so that we so that my sister could have an hour visit with them, they basically she got two visits, one with him for an hour

07:41.000 --> 07:51.000
visit and then the other one when it was about time, and my mother went with her mom my dad had been divorced for, you know, since I was nine months old.

07:51.000 --> 08:06.000
So, yeah, divorced for a very long time, but, you know, my dad, I'd say that losing mom was dad's biggest regret and mom knew it and you know she and my daddy were best friends until they got married.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
So anyway.

08:09.000 --> 08:24.000
It turned out to be a bowel blockage and and kidney failure, and he did the surgery they didn't think he was going to live through it and my sister made the decision.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
After consulting me she didn't just say oh nope, bye.

08:28.000 --> 08:41.000
She and I decided that we were just gonna take daddy off of the, the heart medication that he was on the blood pressure medicine to keep his blood pressure up.

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
And so they expected him to die on Monday.

08:47.000 --> 09:00.000
And then when Shelly went in my mom went in I videoed with my dad, and he woke up off of the morphine that they had him on long enough to try to open his eyes and wave at me.

09:00.000 --> 09:14.000
And something was something very similar happened with my mom, for what it's worth. Yeah, yeah, it was very significant. And then, but him being the stubborn jerk that he was.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
I can say this because he's my dad, and he was a stubborn jerk.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Hold on.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
He did not die that morning, as he was expected to.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
And he did not die the next day, as he was expected to.

09:28.000 --> 09:38.000
He held on. And so my sister went in one more time with my mom and and dad, he didn't wake up for any of that he was already on his way down.

09:39.000 --> 09:47.000
They weren't making fun of his feet to try to get them to wake up because dad was sensitive about his feet and sent me the worst picture of his tone I was like I don't need to see that.

09:47.000 --> 09:57.000
But anyway, I digress because I'm now just remembering everything that went down with it. But anyway,

09:57.000 --> 10:14.000
I said to Shelly, you know, hey, call me whatever time it is and keep in mind, I was in training now for my, my position at work for the rotation that I'm doing that you know could be a pretty big promotion for me so I was already nervous.

10:14.000 --> 10:30.000
Yeah, she was already had a lot on her plate and getting still recovering from the pneumonia that I had. So I get a call around two in the morning for me for central time where dad was, and he, he died.

10:30.000 --> 10:40.000
So, I was, I think I'm pretty grateful that I was so exhausted because I was still on my sleeping pills at the time.

10:40.000 --> 10:46.000
And I passed right back out so I think that sleep was a good buffer for me.

10:46.000 --> 11:00.000
But then I had to, you know, go to work, I could have taken my, my bereavement time, then, but I'd worked so hard for that and I could just think that my dad would be like, nah, nah, nah.

11:00.000 --> 11:09.000
And the funny thing too is that when I got my senior position at my previous position that I was in Rob, not saying where I work.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
That was when granny died and I didn't get to take any bereavement for that.

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
And you know, like I can't get a promotion because then family will die.

11:18.000 --> 11:30.000
But with the, with the state of the world being what it is, you know, you can't eat, you really go back to Alabama, either to, you know, see people and, and, you know, have that grieving together so.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
And while I could technically fly.

11:35.000 --> 11:49.000
Mobile County has the highest infection rate in, in Alabama. And I think it's exceeded, like, one of the Mississippi counties, although Mississippi is pretty terrible, because you know the state motto of Alabama is right.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
We ain't Mississippi.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Okay.

11:55.000 --> 12:08.000
So at any rate, um, yeah I, and on top of that I'm still on like that level one to two quarantine where I'm not exactly safe to go out because they don't know if I had COVID-19.

12:08.000 --> 12:22.000
And if I did, I could be susceptible to reinfection or carrier. And if I think it would be worse if your body was still recovering from another thing and then you get COVID it would be, that would be a very bad thing.

12:22.000 --> 12:31.000
You know how sick I was with that pneumonia I was, I mean, well I'm sure all of our listeners remember me like, I've got to go.

12:31.000 --> 12:39.000
But at any rate, um, yeah I wouldn't be safe to fly because if I haven't had it then I'm, I'm in susceptible list because I recently had pneumonia.

12:39.000 --> 12:51.000
And now I have asthma that I haven't had you since I lost all that weight so go fig. But yeah, so we're going to do something later on, I mean, you know how I feel about everything.

12:51.000 --> 13:05.000
History has taught us there's going to be a second worst wave. But I'm going to leave that where it is. I'm probably sure I'm not going to go be able to get out to Alabama to have any kind of memorial until next year.

13:05.000 --> 13:16.000
And I'm pretty sure that I am not going to DerpyCon if they have it this year. I'm not doing any traveling. I'm gonna, I'm gonna stay put.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
You gotta take care of you. Nobody's gonna fault you for that.

13:19.000 --> 13:32.000
Oh yeah and Shelley and I talked about it and she's like, you know, I'm not really, I think ready to do anything to she's still teaching school through all of this, and my youngest sister is a hot mess.

13:32.000 --> 13:45.000
We won't talk about her, not as bad as my brother who is unrelated to her. My brothers are not related to my sisters. So, let me, let me ask you about this, because this is something we were kind of having a text message exchange about and you know

13:45.000 --> 14:00.000
bringing this story I mean obviously this this OLR and everybody here that listens week after week, whether it's live or whether it's on the podcast feed you know we're a family and so we're here for you if you need, especially when you've been robbed

14:00.000 --> 14:14.000
of getting to do some other type of memorial because of this whole situation like you know, ain't nobody gonna fault you for venting, but, yeah, you and I had an interesting text message exchange, where you've kind of talked a little bit about

14:14.000 --> 14:25.000
the grieving process and how your love of Animal Crossing, which is no secret around here, has helped you through that. Can you, can you elaborate on that a little bit like what we were talking about.

14:25.000 --> 14:41.000
Absolutely, absolutely because I knew, I knew we were going to get there. So, this actually goes back a little bit before dad went into hospital is, I've been playing Animal Crossing the whole time I had pneumonia like religiously like I'm talking nine hours

14:41.000 --> 14:55.000
I'm talking nine hours of play a day. And my, my really good friend who is in chat and I she's, she's been a little public about it I'm going to go to into detail but hi Gwen finara and chat.

14:55.000 --> 15:11.000
I, well I made a little cemetery in my in my town. I put one, because the Zen stone honestly I like it better the, you know, it's a Japanese gravestone. And I put one up for for grandma and granny.

15:11.000 --> 15:27.000
I put one up for Dan's mom who, you know, I said she she died at the beginning of the year so I'm sure you can already think about how things have been. And I put one up for Gwen's mom, because I have fond memories of her mother, and I loved her to bits

15:27.000 --> 15:42.000
and she was really kind to us when we had to evacuate during a hurricane when we were all in college Gwen was my college roommate. And so I wanted to do something for her mom, because I know that the anniversary was coming up.

15:42.000 --> 15:53.000
And then, when, when dad died, I was just like, I didn't even think about it, I took one of those, I went and got the mats for a gravestone.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
And, yeah, she said she built a huge garden for her mother.

15:58.000 --> 16:16.000
But I, I had a stone set up for daddy, I put, I put a black lily in front of it and I was like, that dad wouldn't have liked black lily so I've got incense in front of all of my, my stones I'm actually kind of using instance a little bit as, as my

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
as my in game yard site candle, although I think I'm gonna put.

16:20.000 --> 16:26.000
I've been putting a candle out by by that grave I set for my dad.

16:26.000 --> 16:33.000
Every Friday for for Shabbat, as my, my art site candle I mean, there's been one Friday.

16:33.000 --> 16:49.000
But, but I put one out when he died, and I have, but it's, it's still the fact I'm sorry I don't mean to catch up but it's still the fact that Animal Crossing is like that, like that you, you go through the motion in a game is just it's it's fascinating

16:49.000 --> 17:02.000
and you're definitely not alone like I assure you girl you are not alone because we have our chat room over it of course, and I got to plug this some point twitch.tv slash vog network voice gigs network, where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific

17:02.000 --> 17:08.000
nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby black will show and you guys chat along. And we've got a lot of, you know, obviously support in there for you.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
Our dear Marissa, my therapist knows all about Animal Crossing.

17:14.000 --> 17:24.000
Probably not just from you on Bobby black will says, Animal Crossing is great for a lot of this stuff pod culture saying Animal Crossing has been great for my depression.

17:24.000 --> 17:33.000
I've got something related to their interest next to the stones in the Memorial Garden I set up and I was going to tell you, I, I set something up for my mom in my town.

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
And you know that was she passed in 2017 so this is a while gone.

17:38.000 --> 17:45.000
Yeah, I've been struggling in Animal Crossing in the creativity department like I go to some people's towns like dang I mean like your town.

17:45.000 --> 17:59.000
Everything is laid out you got your town square it's it's beautiful you got all these things, my town I'm kind of like, I'm just adding. I'm, I'm taking the the painting that was already given to me and just adding my own little flourishes.

17:59.000 --> 18:13.000
I'm taking the village layout and just, oh, I want to do this here. Oh, it is here. And one place I did, I, it, the spark hit me when I saw that Nook shopping had the Mother's Day mug available for time.

18:13.000 --> 18:23.000
I was like, I have to do something with that. And so I did and I set up behind my house. There's a little stone wall and there's a little I have the Zen stone because I don't have the other one but I kind of like the Zen stone at this point, and I have

18:23.000 --> 18:37.000
When I get a DIY I'll save it for you. I have the little mug right next to it and then I have pink and black roses, and the black roses are kind of for me, the pink roses are kind of for my mom because I, we had rose bushes when I was younger so I always remember

18:37.000 --> 18:44.000
attending the roses anyway, not to make it about me but just to kind of share with you like, me too.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
We're all doing it. We're all doing it.

18:46.000 --> 18:58.000
And I linked, actually I was talking to one of my newer friends, Annie who is one of the amazing co hosts of Stuff Mom Never Told You and Saver.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
You know, and I've mentioned this podcast plenty of times on the show.

19:03.000 --> 19:13.000
But, you know, just talking about a little bit and there's an article that's from the order of good death.com called exploring grief and Animal Crossing, it's really a good read I'm going to link it.

19:13.000 --> 19:25.000
But you know, I think that because we are all distance like this and we can't be with our families, and we can't, I mean there's people that did die of COVID.

19:25.000 --> 19:31.000
They're not, they're not allowed to have any family around them they can't see the body.

19:31.000 --> 19:48.000
You know, and if they're having very small surfaces. And so, this is the way that you can do something quote tangible, right, something that you can look at and interact with in some way or another.

19:48.000 --> 20:03.000
And, you know, I'll put it this way I do have my art site candle in real life for my dad, you know, and for those who don't know, you know, got a few a little bit of my Jew crew here in a chat, but the yard site candle is a candle that burns for 26 hours,

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
and you light it on the anniversary of someone's death their yard site.

20:09.000 --> 20:22.000
But I've been lighting one, I've lit one quite a bit often for just to remember the victims of COVID-19 and our governmental stupidity.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
And now I've got got them for my dad.

20:26.000 --> 20:42.000
And, you know, I'll, you know, have a little swig of the manage habits and and say, say, cottage for my dad even though my dad would probably, I don't know I never told him that I converted to Judy.

20:42.000 --> 20:58.000
So, he probably would be, I wouldn't say, you know, spending in his grave, he'd be breakdancing in his grave. Again, hashtag relatable because my mom was very adamant, I don't want a funeral, I don't want a headstone I don't want a memorial.

20:58.000 --> 21:14.000
I want, you know, she she wants her ashes scattered in a very particular place. And it was cremated. Yeah. And so, so it's kind of one of those Oh my going against my mom's wishes but I'm like, my mom hated video games and she's not going to find out about this, and this is

21:14.000 --> 21:21.000
sometimes you do something. This is more for me. And I think she'd understand that.

21:21.000 --> 21:27.000
I think she would but yeah, but you but you would hear that Rob you're playing that game.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Absolutely hope I did your mom justice with that.

21:30.000 --> 21:36.000
Let me, let me read some other hashtag relatable comments.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
I got my therapist playing Animal Crossing.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
Crystal skies and chat says my therapist also knows all about Animal Crossing.

21:45.000 --> 21:53.000
My office has been coming together and Animal Crossing as well. Marissa says my therapist is going to get an Animal Crossing and a switch for kids now so they can socialize.

21:53.000 --> 22:03.000
Well you know we've already talked on previous episodes about just what a huge like you know cultural milestone this game has been, and certainly not for the reasons that it wanted to be.

22:03.000 --> 22:10.000
You know, it's just the right game that released at the right time, you know, and yeah, it's weird.

22:10.000 --> 22:23.000
It's weird to think, would it be like this, if it had released in a normal world I don't know it's it's, we don't know we'll never know, still pretty sure Animal Crossing would have been big, but it was.

22:23.000 --> 22:31.000
It was timely, not not on purpose I mean people like Oh conspiracy theory blah blah blah tinfoil hat would have.

22:31.000 --> 22:39.000
But I think that interest that it was the therapy we needed when it came out. Oh, for sure.

22:39.000 --> 22:50.000
A very interesting observation by Bobby Blackwolf and chat that's worth calling out here. Nintendo keeps putting out these cultural milestones. Remember everyone going out and being together for Pokemon Go.

22:50.000 --> 22:59.000
If you want to get technical I mean Pokemon Go is a Niantic game that they just kind of lifted Nintendo's IP for but, but technically Game Freak right.

22:59.000 --> 23:11.000
You're right you're right the Pokemon Company which is, you know, but anyway, but, and I'm going to give you this. It's because it was Pokemon that that game was so popular so yes I mean if it hadn't been Nintendo slash Game Freak Pokemon

23:11.000 --> 23:22.000
Companies. If it hadn't been those particular characters I don't think it would have caught on the fire that it did, even though technically it's Niantic game so sure, we'll still give Nintendo credit for that, because you know that observation yeah

23:22.000 --> 23:34.000
Nintendo, Nintendo really does seem to hit a lot of these cultural milestones of sorts, you know, and with Animal Crossing and how we all dealt with it during coven we're gonna remember that for a long time.

23:34.000 --> 23:46.000
Well, and to add in other things with that too. When Pokemon Go came out, it actually has helped several friends of mine with social anxiety and full blown agoraphobia.

23:46.000 --> 23:57.000
You know, because it was kind of like you had your centered little bubble but you were still out, and it got people out and involved and, and, and that.

23:57.000 --> 24:14.000
And another thing too, as I was talking, actually looking through some information for reference, you know, we have a good number of other online games that are really playing into the social distancing.

24:14.000 --> 24:31.000
People in, you know, because people still play Sims 4 in Animal Crossing and even like Second Life are using those games to celebrate Ramadan, which, for, for those who observe Ramadan with Iraq, I hope I said that right.

24:31.000 --> 24:36.000
And I was gonna say Jack, Jack box is the huge one too.

24:36.000 --> 24:49.000
Yeah, even though that's not like a simulation game like the everything goes to name like certainly jackbox in the Oh, here's the thing we can play online virtually and it's like when it's, it's very easy for everybody to like not everybody has to have a PlayStation

24:49.000 --> 24:59.000
not everybody has to have a copy of the game because it's very easily streamable, and this whole Oh you just play through your mobile phone over the internet makes it like super easy like I would imagine.

24:59.000 --> 25:08.000
Like I'm not I'm not going to pry into jackbox financials and again, I don't think any of these companies, you can talk about evil corporate greed all you want.

25:08.000 --> 25:19.000
I don't think Nintendo or jackbox games ever wanted to be in this position. But, but they are. And so I bet jackbox is making noodles noodles off of this situation.

25:20.000 --> 25:31.000
Nintendo to be rather an ethical company because I mean think about what I think it was you want to who did it that he took a pay cut when Nintendo was suffering so that his employees could be paid fairly.

25:31.000 --> 25:48.000
I remember that during the Wii U, I remember that during the Wii U era Yeah, exactly. So, but you know, there's also, I think, and I'm really hoping that this isn't you know just becoming a breeding pit for the worst of.

25:48.000 --> 25:56.000
I'm just going to throw it out there, toxic masculinity, that we've got more online matches in multiplayer games.

25:56.000 --> 26:01.000
You know, I'm hoping that the more.

26:01.000 --> 26:20.000
I'll say non cisgender men are able to go in and play their favorite online games and those environments as well without having to suffer. You know, the EP for lack of a better description, you know, and you know what I'm talking about it's it's not a good place for women.

26:20.000 --> 26:44.000
It's interesting because I think since Nintendo often gets written off by the masses as the kitty product, the little kid product that toxic audience tends to stray from and again I fully recognize I am painting broad strokes here okay and nothing is easily sort of won't call me or call me, but that audience tends to stay out of the Nintendo games because it gets written off as a kitty product.

26:44.000 --> 26:56.000
And so, in some ways I think that kind of helps lend it to why it is part of all these cultural phenomenons because it feels a little safer because that toxicness has these other has these other places to go.

26:56.000 --> 27:11.000
And again, it's not to say Nintendo is free of toxicity and all this other stuff I'm not that ignorant, but smash again in in broad strokes, like, Nintendo tends to be that safer place for a broader audience.

27:11.000 --> 27:21.000
Well, you know, I remember I was playing a crap ton of Mass Effect three multiplayer, but I would only play with people I knew.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
And I would not play.

27:23.000 --> 27:29.000
If I, if we like joined in on any matches, I would not play with my speaker on. Yeah.

27:29.000 --> 27:41.000
I just, it's like the moment when a non cisgender male joins in, in a game like that the moment they find out that there could be a vagina involved.

27:41.000 --> 27:57.000
You know the the hammer comes down and we shouldn't have to put up with it it's absolutely disgusting and especially in this day and age with everything going on and just the general, I'd say social trauma that we as an overall society are experiencing.

27:57.000 --> 28:08.000
We need to have this outlet and people need to be less shitty about it. Yeah, that's all I'm gonna say there, you have to wonder if something in the world situation isn't going to challenge, some of that.

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
But anyway, that's, that's a much deeper topic we've gotten a lot of topic I'm sorry.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
But, but going back, let's do the car.

28:16.000 --> 28:30.000
People are using their games as a means of communication as a means of getting out their stress, and in my case, your case, Gwen here, we're we're working through our grief in Animal Crossing.

28:30.000 --> 28:50.000
You know we're working through our grief in a very, I would say healthy way there and there is and this is the last, I'm really going to go too much into the grief thing there is a TED Talk that it gave me a lot of help when, when Grandmom and Granny died I know I linked it to you Rob to watch.

28:50.000 --> 29:08.000
And I'm gonna, I'm going to put it in chat, but I'm going to try to find out who it was that did it because I always forget her name, but it podcast folks won't see the chat so right that's why I'm gonna say, you know, look for it, but it's a TED Talk about closure.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
And it talks about.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
It's by Nancy Burns brns.

29:14.000 --> 29:26.000
But it's a really good conversation about keeping your grief grief with you as a part of you so that you don't separate it from the memories. And I think that's what we're doing with Animal Crossing, you know what I mean.

29:26.000 --> 29:44.000
We are, we are putting our grief out there in a way that others can share it with us we're keeping it fresh in our hearts, but it's also helping us to reconcile that sadness with the joy it could bring us you know what I mean.

29:44.000 --> 29:49.000
Absolutely. So, and we tie it into the things that we love to keep that close to us.

29:49.000 --> 29:56.000
So, I've had some time to think on this. No, you're fine you're fine you know and just as you know Animal Crossing has helped us through a lot of that.

29:56.000 --> 30:09.000
This show has helped us through a lot of these difficult moments in our lives so it's, it's, it's good to have you back to our soccer I'm glad you were feeling up to coming back tonight so a hearty welcome back to you.

30:09.000 --> 30:29.000
18 years almost. Yeah, been a lot. Unbelievable, unbelievable. And I was hoping, I was hoping by the time our 18th birthday rolled around, because we're sitting, we're sitting on new art and new intro and like a whole like makeover for the show, we're just sitting on it, because the idea was, oh, that would be a great way to come out of this

30:29.000 --> 30:41.000
COVID situation the social distance recording is like, we're back again and here's all new coat of paint and all this stuff but now it's like as the time goes on it's like well, maybe we'll just have to roll that out on the 18th anniversary because we just we don't know

30:41.000 --> 30:52.000
when this is going to be passed I mean I don't know it seems like things are getting I get I guess I shouldn't go too far into the topic we don't know.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
So we have to play it week by week.

30:56.000 --> 31:10.000
And, you know, I think that. And now I'm going to get all like ridiculously sappy and everything. Okay, that you guys have been just a delight, a joy in my life.

31:10.000 --> 31:23.000
And I think without the show I probably would have been a lot more lost yeah I mean yeah I had to take the week off of it because I mean and I'm even still doing it, I just don't trust my voice when I was in training I hardly said anything publicly,

31:23.000 --> 31:30.000
you know, you know, in our, in our training chat which I'm all doing this online, you know, that.

31:30.000 --> 31:49.000
But coming back to the show is, I think, one of my big steps in in facing it and dealing with it and trying to trying to, I'm not gonna say muscle through, but trying just to bring that into a part of the person that it makes me well and get some

31:49.000 --> 31:54.000
sort of normalcy back in a completely abnormal world.

31:54.000 --> 32:01.000
Well, I don't believe normal is always in flux. The only constant is change, right, fair.

32:01.000 --> 32:06.000
This is our normal. But when you've been doing something 18 years it's kind of normal.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
You know what I know it. No, I know what you mean.

32:09.000 --> 32:14.000
Yeah, so I mean I'm gonna say look at us. Look at our other fellow podcasts.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
Look at her.

32:17.000 --> 32:22.000
But look at how we've all adapted.

32:22.000 --> 32:34.000
We've got discord now for doing our show other folks are using Skype. I've seen some on zoom or their, you know, videos streaming you know with the crazy backgrounds and everything.

32:34.000 --> 32:39.000
I think it's absolutely amazing that we have the, you know, could we have done this 10 years ago.

32:39.000 --> 32:45.000
Would we have paid out the nose for life through life 365 to do it.

32:45.000 --> 32:59.000
Could we have done it 10 years ago, maybe through Skype, but is that the way well and and here's the thing and I, as, as convenient as like discord is for doing this show and it's great because it allows us to still get together we can get that creative

32:59.000 --> 33:13.000
energy out we can still do this show and it kind of gives us what we need. I am going to be honest, I still don't like it as much as I liked us all being here, but I realize that just can't be the case right now.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
It will be the case again someday.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
We'll get we'll get there, week by week.

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
Oh great now I've got that song stuck in my head.

33:23.000 --> 33:28.000
Some day, somewhere, nevermind.

33:29.000 --> 33:36.000
It's Bob rush he's like butter. Yeah, Bobby says the majority of podcasts actually were done over Skype for the past 15 years very, very few were done in the same room.

33:36.000 --> 33:48.000
I think you meant like over 10 because when you invoke life 365 see in that era when we were doing dialect radio. I'm not sure Skype would have done as well but yeah most podcasts are done over Skype, but I think what kind of has made or zoom whatever

33:48.000 --> 34:01.000
you want to insert there. I think part of what's made this show special is the fact that we're all in the same room. And I can also say, I don't like doing the distance recording, but we're going to do the distance recording, so we can still have this show

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
because something's better than nothing.

34:03.000 --> 34:18.000
Absolutely, absolutely. And, and you know, with all of this, you know, I, and any fellow podcaster listening to this show live or recorded.

34:18.000 --> 34:29.000
Kudos to you keep doing it keep your voice out there we need, especially our into you know our independent podcasters and the people who are out there saying important things that people need to hear.

34:29.000 --> 34:40.000
Don't, don't let a virus stop you keep using you know doing it this way do it however you need to. It could be really difficult, it could be super easy for you but the fact that you're doing it is what's important.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Absolutely.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Keep on keeping on.

34:44.000 --> 34:53.000
Yeah, put that art out there because in this really crappy situation and podcasting is a type of art. I know a lot of people like to, you know, speak negatively of it.

34:53.000 --> 34:58.000
I'm not going to stand by and let that happen. It is a type of art, it's a type of expression.

34:58.000 --> 35:13.000
And as crappy as these times are the best thing that's going to come out of it is the art is the Animal Crossing creativity, the the things that help us to grieve and all of that that's going to be so don't, you know, keep podcasting and keep keep making art, whatever

35:13.000 --> 35:26.000
it is, if you paint, if you, you know, keep it, keep one of my favorite movies ever is pump up the volume. Mm hmm. And just the fact that I mean it was you know the 90s with shortwave radio, right.

35:26.000 --> 35:42.000
But I always think that that might have been one of my biggest inspirations that led me to love doing the live radio, and then going into. That was why when I had the chance to you know do under sedation with y'all and fill in for for Jessica and be like the constant guest.

35:43.000 --> 35:56.000
I jumped on it. And then when we did our show, I knew I had found the thing that I mean, if I could get paid for doing all our hell yeah, but I know no don't talk crazy now.

35:56.000 --> 36:07.000
We got paid yet so I don't think we will so whatevs. But at any rate, that's that's my whole my whole thing. Everyone out there keep using your voice. Please keep using your voice.

36:07.000 --> 36:17.000
Also PS. I played with Gail Simone and Animal Crossing so I feel like I've had my, my ultimate nerd moment, the end. Congrats. All right, Loki is still with us.

36:17.000 --> 36:29.000
Sorry. It's been a right it's been it's been like you totally ran to the other rumors I know it's like, it's, it's been a good 30 minutes of venting and chatting but it's it was needed.

36:29.000 --> 36:41.000
It was child wrangling. This is group therapy. All right, we are going to get into some gaming news though because video games are the way that some of us you know cope it's a, it's an art form as well.

36:41.000 --> 36:50.000
And some of us cope through Animal Crossing. Others of us like to play games where we shoot demons in the face right Loki.

36:50.000 --> 37:00.000
Sure. So, Doom eternal courses, you know, one of the big games that came out and march around this wall exactly at the same time as Animal Crossing.

37:00.000 --> 37:10.000
And it was met with pretty good reception you know that pretty positive reviews and everything and there weren't really any issues with it.

37:10.000 --> 37:23.000
That is until they decided to update it and insert de nouveau anti cheat, because everybody loves de nouveau I mean the copy protection scheme that doesn't really work that well.

37:23.000 --> 37:34.000
And on top of that, they had actually with this now being put in there and I guess to stop cheating but there really isn't a whole lot of like online multiplayer.

37:34.000 --> 37:51.000
It's really just the battle mode that they have where it's basically to one player versus to two players playing as like some sort of demons, which I don't know if there's been a lot of cheating in that per se but it is something that they put in there

37:51.000 --> 38:00.000
and now folks aren't really happy about de nouveau anti cheat being in there because it gives kernel access to this program.

38:00.000 --> 38:19.000
And it's basically leaving it open to be exploited in some way to gain access to your system now, of course, it's come out saying that Listen, this is only running when the game is running and it's, you know, not going to stay persistent in your computer.

38:19.000 --> 38:48.000
But, you know, so folks don't really like that. However, apparently de nouveau is working with the team with, you know, the behind Doom eternal to see if there's a way to get like some sort of separate launcher for the single player offline play, so that it would allow you to play the offline portion single player, which a lot of people are doing is just playing single player, and being able to do that without the de nouveau anti cheat and only enabling it if you're playing some sort of online portion of that.

38:48.000 --> 39:02.000
Which I think it's a decent compromise, it still kind of sucks. And then of course, along with that, as folks tend to do, I got review bombs pretty bad on steam. So now it's mixed instead of very positive.

39:04.000 --> 39:09.000
Oh, good old review bombing, you know, a way to way to take a stand internet.

39:09.000 --> 39:22.000
Show them. Yeah, well, they're making their voices heard. I mean, it sounds like that they hear them. So I don't know some interesting commentary because this topic came up in our discord server this week.

39:22.000 --> 39:32.000
So of course, we have a discord server like a lot of your favorite podcasters and broadcasters. And you can find it over at vog network.com. That's vog network.com slash discord will get you the invite you need to get in there.

39:32.000 --> 39:49.000
And there was some really interesting comments, I want to relay some of those comments on the situation. metal mayhem on discord said, here's my take. On one hand, I can understand wanting anti cheating measures. Over the past 17 years of playing games online, I've seen all too many cheaters and that annoyed the fuck out of me.

39:49.000 --> 40:05.000
TF. At the same time, I can't stand intrusive programs being installed on my PC. That's one major reason why I like buying games on GOG versus steam when I have the option to do so. And let's be real here, anti cheating software and DRM doesn't stop folks from doing what they're going to do.

40:05.000 --> 40:27.000
All it'll do it all it'll do is slowly delay it. And in the process, annoy everyone else. Here's a comment from 13 x forever 30 forever who said, Why exactly is this bad? Besides the general FUD about the F, I think F us maybe about the potential of exploit by a third party.

40:27.000 --> 40:44.000
You have 10s of drivers running with the same privileges, for far more dubious reasons or needs. iTunes installs 10 year old driver to be able to rip audio CDs and no one bats an eye. Some game company installs the drivers is being constantly developed under a high pressure to fix any issues ASAP, and the internet's losing their mind.

40:44.000 --> 41:09.000
There are valid reasons to reject the notion of such updates, but people are focusing on all the wrong aspects of this. One more here from Tiger Claw. I just want to say, though, I like that comment because it does shine a spotlight on why is it always the games that get all the press about this when there are so many other products on your computer and he he named an audio software, but there's all other types.

41:09.000 --> 41:26.000
But I think that in those situations where people find exploits like that, they are brought up. It's just it's not necessarily something that, you know, you might be paying attention to. I don't think that people are silent on that when there is an exploit like that. They're just as up in arms about it.

41:26.000 --> 41:49.000
It's just this tends to be like, do you know, do you know, but doesn't tend to work correctly and it sends to get defeated pretty quick and causes all sorts of issues, I think, with the game. I don't know necessarily specifics, but I know that, like, even with this launching, I want to say that I thought they were supposed to be putting Denuvo anti piracy in there and they accidentally shipped it with basically a

41:49.000 --> 42:14.000
DRM free executable for some stupid reason, because probably because Bethesda. But I know like other companies that have used, you know, I believe have been the it's been defeated pretty fast. So I don't know. I think the overall consensus is that the negatives outweigh the positives of it.

42:15.000 --> 42:30.000
But I mean, you'll see, I don't think there's really a strong online to it. Maybe this is just kind of a precursor before they launch like a legitimate multiplayer deathmatch type thing or something that I can see.

42:30.000 --> 42:43.000
Maybe they're just getting the kinks out with this one online mode first, because then I can see that the need for this. But for just like the simple one versus two mode, I mean, I guess there would be.

42:43.000 --> 42:49.000
I mean, I assume there's gonna be cheaters everywhere, but I can't imagine that it's gonna be that rampant.

42:50.000 --> 42:59.000
Let me read one more comment from Tiger Claw here from Discord. I don't really like the stuff that's being installed in the background. One of the issues might be that it would slow down your PC if it's constantly running in the background.

42:59.000 --> 43:10.000
There would be cases where having such things could affect system performance when you're gaming on a PC. For example, it could potentially eat too much of your system resources and use up a lot of memory. This is basically a form of DRM.

43:10.000 --> 43:26.000
So yeah, lots of negative feelings about this software. I think for me, I understand why companies kind of have to do the anti-cheat thing. To an extent, I understand it because people are gonna cheat.

43:27.000 --> 43:35.000
And you see it run rampant in almost any online game, especially ones that don't have these sorts of protocols in place.

43:36.000 --> 43:46.000
But on the other side, I also completely understand that Doom Eternal also has a one-player mode, and some people just want to play the one-player mode, and have no interest in playing online with other people.

43:46.000 --> 44:00.000
So why are they being subjected to this as well? In that aspect, I understand why this is very annoying, because it's for a part of the game that I don't really have an interest in.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
But, I don't know.

44:05.000 --> 44:21.000
I mean, we'll have to see. According to you, I think it may be just kind of a knee-jerk reaction to anti-cheats in the past. Basically, a lot of them used to hook into the file systems, start up with your OS and that kind of stuff.

44:21.000 --> 44:28.000
Whereas, maybe this isn't as intrusive, but I don't know. I don't have Doom.

44:28.000 --> 44:40.000
And I'm gonna just totally throw something kind of lame-brain out there and fully admit it, but my gut says, you know, this is America. We love to sue people in America.

44:40.000 --> 44:56.000
Could it be that these things getting installed on a computer when people don't want them to, let's say it gets exploited or whatever, let's say there is an exploit and somebody gets into your computer because of this anti-cheat system, could there be a legal ramification with that?

44:56.000 --> 45:05.000
Or, I mean, I know, hold on, because I know what people are going to say is up, but you accepted that end-user license agreement, and when you accepted the license agreement, you agreed all that stuff.

45:05.000 --> 45:12.000
And I kind of figure, like, sure, I understand that. Is that really going to stop a lawyer from a class action lawsuit? I don't know.

45:12.000 --> 45:20.000
I've also seen those types of license agreements challenged when it's like, nah, nah, you don't get to get out of it by doing that. You know what I mean?

45:20.000 --> 45:24.000
Like, when Sony and the PlayStation issues they had and all that stuff. Anyway, go ahead, Loki.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
But the company...

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Oh, sorry, Jamie. Sorry.

45:27.000 --> 45:44.000
Yeah, one thing that the company does have the right to protect the experience that they sold to people, you know, they advertise the game a certain way, that certain things would happen, that certain protections would be there, and this could indeed be their way of enforcing it, right?

45:44.000 --> 45:58.000
Yeah, it's like, it's why I'm not, like, completely against the anti-cheat thing, but I do feel to some extent the company needs to own it if that software is what is used to exploit your computer.

45:58.000 --> 46:06.000
But then again, we have the Discord comment that makes an excellent point. You have a ton of shit on your PC that could probably be used to exploit your computer. So...

46:07.000 --> 46:16.000
How are you going to pinpoint it to, you know, what exactly it is? I don't know. Yeah, I'm sure people will calm down after a while.

46:16.000 --> 46:27.000
All right. All right, well, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week, whether we were using mods or anti-cheat systems or what.

46:27.000 --> 46:36.000
Darsaka. Real quick, I was going to say, that's the thing that would actually concern me is sometimes I like to cheat my own single player experiences.

46:36.000 --> 46:42.000
So is this going to prevent me from doing that? That kind of takes away some of the fun.

46:42.000 --> 46:52.000
Excellent question. And Bethesda in some ways has embraced the mods, like in the old Doom, right? Like, that's the big reason why they have these new...

46:53.000 --> 47:03.000
Yeah, I'm like, it is interesting. Like, you know, I think there's definitely assets and positives to modding and so forth. So you ask an excellent question.

47:03.000 --> 47:14.000
Like, if this disables the ability to mod your PC version of Doom Eternal, then that's kind of a bummer. You know, if you want to do that, as long as your modding isn't distracting from the experiences of others.

47:14.000 --> 47:22.000
I think that it's sort of like the bad apple scenario where they're saying, well, one could be used negatively, we're going to ban them all.

47:22.000 --> 47:32.000
Where like with what BioWare did with Mass Effect is like, if it's not affecting the multiplayer experience, do your high res mods, make Shepard wear whatever you want her to wear, you know?

47:32.000 --> 47:39.000
All right. Anyway, good point, Logie. Let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week, Doom or otherwise.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Darsaka, how was your gaming week?

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
Animal Crossing.

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
I guess we kind of got into that earlier in the show. Anything?

47:45.000 --> 47:57.000
Yeah, I really haven't played anything else. Oh yeah, I was going to say, and I've told you all about this game a bunch of times because I have Apple Arcade and I have been super into playing Patterned.

47:57.000 --> 48:03.000
And they released a bunch of puzzles and some of them are what I call hell puzzles.

48:03.000 --> 48:12.000
But basically, in a nutshell, what Patterned is, and it's set to like, if you want the music, it's like really gentle background piano music.

48:12.000 --> 48:27.000
Just really gentle in background and kind of relaxing and calming like you're by a stream, you know, but you get different, your entire picture is a tiled picture with different, you know, patterns and designs on it.

48:27.000 --> 48:41.000
And you have different blocks of a different size that you have to bring in to match over a piece of the artwork. And it starts off as line art and fills in more gradually as you fill in more of the pieces until you have the complete puzzle.

48:41.000 --> 48:50.000
And they let you download it as wallpaper. If you're playing on on one of your mobile devices or playing on a computer.

48:50.000 --> 48:55.000
I've even used one of these wallpapers for, you know, one of my own little projects.

48:55.000 --> 49:08.000
But at any rate, I have been playing a good bit of that it's been just really good for for kind of having like a distraction for my brain because I need to be doing a couple of things at once.

49:08.000 --> 49:23.000
And if I if I stopped in this was last week of course if I stopped to think about anything that I was going to go crazy so it's been really good for just, you know, keeping, keeping me steady it's nice and chill you can play it on your phone you play on your tablet

49:23.000 --> 49:29.000
you can play it on your computer I'm playing it of course on Mac because it's Apple arcade.

49:29.000 --> 49:40.000
But it's a game that I super love, um, I really haven't opened anything else I haven't touched Pokemon I haven't touched the Harry Potter game.

49:40.000 --> 49:50.000
It's just really, I've just been so stuck in Animal Crossing land because it's been, it's been like my, my, my blanket my blankie.

49:50.000 --> 50:03.000
Although I am finally considering if my other if my gaming computer will keep up with it, I'm finally going to take the plunge on Detroit become human, because I love that game.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
It's beautiful.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
So, yeah, that's my gaming week.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
Excellent.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Loki, how was your gaming week.

50:10.000 --> 50:15.000
So I played a little bit of Minecraft with my kids.

50:15.000 --> 50:27.000
I played more step mania stuff, I was loading on some new songs and I finally found the eight 20 songs so put those in there and played some of that today.

50:27.000 --> 50:38.000
So that's fun. And of course lots of Orna. And I think that was it. Yeah, I think that's all I played this week.

50:38.000 --> 50:51.000
Okay. Um, so for my gaming week I'm still going on the regulars like Animal Crossing and Final Fantasy 14 and the mobile stuff like you know Ingress Pokemon Go and let's say the Orna and all that stuff.

50:51.000 --> 51:06.000
Let's see, uh, new stuff though. I probably the biggest thing that I checked out that was new on the Nintendo switch they released the mobile game Elder Scrolls blades, but now they're reporting it to consoles originally it was supposed to be out on like

51:06.000 --> 51:13.000
every console and mobile. It's taken a while for them to do that and I don't even know if that's still the plan anymore, but the switch version came out.

51:13.000 --> 51:26.000
So I was like, what the hell it's free. What do I have to lose, so I jumped in and played it a little bit. There's a lot of people out there I noticed on Twitter and stuff that don't like this game, and it's buggy because it's a Bethesda game, it hasn't been like super

51:26.000 --> 51:33.000
buggy for me like I might get a frame skip issue here and there, but Bobby was talking about on his show tonight and it's on his Twitter over at Bobby black wolf.

51:33.000 --> 51:44.000
He had this like, like he can't even use his right joystick. It's so damn choppy like I didn't have any of those issues but it's interesting how buggy the game can be from one system to another.

51:44.000 --> 51:53.000
His theory is that it has to do with running the game off an SD card. I don't think mine is doing that but I don't know that it's not either but anyway I'm, whatever.

51:53.000 --> 52:03.000
Um, I don't hate it like I read all that they hate that people have for this game out there and I'm like this is a little strong. I don't love it either. I'm not going to die on the hill for this game.

52:03.000 --> 52:18.000
It's a really like dumbed down version of Elder Scrolls, and I mean dumb down like it's really simplified but sometimes it's kind of like what you need, like Elder Scrolls, there's a lot when you can touch every book and every piece of fruit and pick every flower

52:18.000 --> 52:27.000
and all that stuff so like in some ways like not having all of that overload my senses with like, I need to collect everything is actually kind of nice.

52:27.000 --> 52:41.000
Um, so it's kind of like a dungeon crawler sort of thing you're basically like going through these like pre rendered dungeons and killing a couple mobs and you know that the battle systems very simple it's kind of like slash with the left hand slash

52:41.000 --> 52:54.000
with the right hand slash with the left hand cast a spell it's kind of it's very, again, it's very simplified. And then the whole point is that you're like restoring this city, so it's basically a city builder game with some dungeon crawling built into it.

52:54.000 --> 53:02.000
Again, I don't hate it, it was a, it was a fair use of a couple hours, maybe not probably not even that long maybe an hour and a half that I was playing it.

53:02.000 --> 53:12.000
I just wish the damn thing had a map. I can't believe here we are in the year 2020, and I'm playing a video game without a stinking map, like, what what is up with that.

53:12.000 --> 53:24.000
And don't throw the whole well video games didn't used to have maps. They've been doing maps and video games since like the original Legend of Zelda probably before that, quite honestly, Elder Scrolls has maps in their game.

53:24.000 --> 53:36.000
Yes, exactly. So like the what the fact that it's missing from this one is really irritating. But otherwise, it's, it's okay. Like, I don't hate it. I think I don't understand why people like really hate it.

53:36.000 --> 53:53.000
I do hear though that they've changed a lot since it originally released for mobile that they've done some changes and now here we are releasing on switch. This is the first time I've experienced it so some people might be basing their perceptions off the original version of the game and that that could explain why maybe sometimes

53:53.000 --> 54:07.000
some people hate it and I'm like, I mean, I get that it's buggy and it's really simple and it is a free to play game but I don't think it's like the worst thing I've ever played in my life I've played far worse games that I paid money for.

54:07.000 --> 54:26.000
So there's that. But yeah, Elder Scrolls Blades. It's, it's okay. Put that on the back of the box. All right. We're gonna get into some gaming news here. I do want to mention some quick stuff during housekeeping because Bobby was mentioning this on his show tonight and I think this is an important thing to bring up.

54:26.000 --> 54:49.000
So every year. Well, I shouldn't say every year but for the past couple years. The voice geeks network has sponsored a show out in Atlanta, that is similar to like our California extreme out here you know where they do all like the, the old, old school machines pinball machines and arcade machines they kind of rent a hotel ballroom and the whole things on free play for a weekend.

54:49.000 --> 55:14.000
There's a thing like that out in Atlanta, the Atlanta area is not actually not in the city of Atlanta, but it's called the southern fried game gaming Expo, I must say game room but I think now it's gaming Expo because they try to incorporate some other stuff into that as well but southern F FGE, they have canceled for the year 2020, which I'm sure won't surprise anyone with everything that's going on in the world a lot of big conventions are canceling.

55:14.000 --> 55:28.000
But here's the thing. We've talked about this a little bit with why is dragon con still happening. Why is packs still happening Why are these companies saying that these things are going to happen, and long story short, it has to do with contracts.

55:28.000 --> 55:57.000
They could be in a breach of contract essentially, if they just cancel because unfortunately pandemics for whatever ridiculous reason is not one of the like acceptable reasons to cancel a contract. However, if the city or the state government steps steps in and says, Oh no, you're not having this gatherings of 500 plus people are banned here, then you can enact a clause in the contract known as force majority.

55:57.000 --> 56:14.000
And you basically get to cancel but you get to recoup the money invested because now it's not your fault the canceled basically. So most conventions This is why dragon con hasn't canceled yet. This is why packs hasn't canceled yet, because that type of stuff is not going to happen until two three months out before this all happens.

56:14.000 --> 56:39.000
So for everybody that's on dragon cons page posting, I can't believe you'd put the public at risk. Wait, wait, if you want to blame something, blame the legal process. Okay. But here's the thing. Southern fried game room Expo, they they have canceled because they're in a part of Georgia where there is no legal clause to have such big gatherings.

56:40.000 --> 56:54.000
So they are caving in to that pressure and doing the right thing per se, by not having a mass gathering of people at their own discretion. And unfortunately, that means they are going to be financially liable.

56:55.000 --> 57:13.000
So if you're able to if you're in the south east area, if you are the type of person that would usually go to these types of things, please consider supporting for getting your 2021 ticket, or they're going to have some shirts online and some of the merch that they probably would have sold this year will be available online instead.

57:13.000 --> 57:27.000
If that is the type of thing up your alley, I would encourage you to get on there and support that because, you know, they did do the right thing for public safety, even though technically, there was no government mandate for them to shut down on that.

57:28.000 --> 57:45.000
So I just want to give them a shout out of sorts. The interesting silver lining to that, that whole thing, for me is that, you know, with all this time off, I'm saving, and all this flight credit, I'm going to have if Dragon Kong ends up getting canceled, I'm going to have more flight credit.

57:45.000 --> 57:54.000
It's one of those weird things where it's like, well, I might be able to go to this in 2021. Usually I'm like, oh, no, I can't do two trips to Atlanta over the summer. That's too much. I don't have that kind of time.

57:54.000 --> 58:04.000
Well, with everything that's happened this year, I guess the silver lining is I'm going to have everything banked for next year. So no promises yet because we don't know what the world's really going to look like in 2021.

58:04.000 --> 58:16.000
We don't even know if it's going to be okay then, we hope, but, you know, but the interesting silver lining is that maybe I can go in 2021, but I hope you all will support them and do the right thing and all that.

58:16.000 --> 58:25.000
So, okay, let's move on and get into some gaming news and the headlines of the week. Loki, you want to start us off?

58:25.000 --> 58:41.000
Yes. So one of the news bits that was part of the summer of gaming or whatever the hell we're calling it now, they had an announcement with Tony Hawk talking about the remaster of Tony Hawk one and two.

58:41.000 --> 58:52.000
So that's pretty sweet to see them basically going to be remastering those two games. They're trying to get the same tracks from the original soundtrack.

58:52.000 --> 58:59.000
Not sure if they're going to be able to get all of them, but they're going to have the original skaters and looks pretty awesome.

58:59.000 --> 59:07.000
So that would be coming out September 1st, I believe, or September 4th. And yeah, so what to look forward to that.

59:07.000 --> 59:17.000
And then, of course, along with that, because obviously it's been a long time since these games have come out and, you know, Tony Hawk isn't as young as he used to be.

59:17.000 --> 59:24.000
So what's kind of fun is they're actually going to have the pros that are in the game are actually going to be aged as well.

59:24.000 --> 59:29.000
So he's going to tell you, Hawk will look like he does now and as will the other pros in there.

59:29.000 --> 59:39.000
So I think that's pretty cool. Dad's going skateboarding. Yeah. I wonder if they'll get like other does Tony Hawk have kids?

59:39.000 --> 59:47.000
I imagine he does. Yeah, you got it. You got to wonder if those kids sometimes are like, Dad, you're embarrassing me.

59:47.000 --> 59:51.000
Do you think everybody thinks that about their dad?

59:51.000 --> 59:57.000
I guess that's true. And then at the same time, it's like, child, that skateboarding is paying for your college.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:03.000
These three masters are going to pay for that. So I guess you can't be too critical. Did you hear his record got broken?

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Oh, no, I didn't. Yeah. Like an 11 year old kid finally pulled off a 1080.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000
OK, well, but does but does that cheapen the Tony Hawk brand?

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:18.000
No, but I'm just saying that like the thing he like was kicking his ass to try to do a kid beat him finally.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:27.000
But it kind of brings things back to that legacy that he's kind of done to true, you know, and it's like, you know, I realize skateboarding is not in the Olympics,

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:38.000
but I think people in Generation X and especially subsequent generations, we kind of start to look at skateboarding and those types of things that were like the X Games when we were like in our early 20s.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Right. Like those are kind of like Olympic sports to us. So and the reason why I say that is because, like, you know, if an Olympian has a record beaten, you still kind of remember like the heyday of that Olympian.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Right. You know, like, yeah, like Mary Lou Retton in the 80s or something like that, you know, like that was that was crazy how she was everywhere.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000
And I don't even know how I wanted her legs or what. Who's I wanted legs like that.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Who's more modern? Who's the swimmer guy? Michael. Michael Phelps. Michael Phelps. Yeah.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Or there's. I can't remember her name now. Who is the runner? Jackie Joyner-Kersee is on the tip of my tongue. No, no, no. Oh, but I can't remember showing my age.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Oh, and then there was also like for, you know, the the figure skating world, Bonaly, who, you know, just to piss off the judges, did a backflip.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Oh, yeah. Isn't there some documentary about her? It's fascinating. I think so. I remember watching all that figure skating stuff growing up because, you know, hello.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:47.000
And I remember I was totally into it. I think her name was like Sophia or so something. Sonia. Sonia. Yeah. Sorry. Sonia. Sonia. Yeah.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Sonia Bonaly. So. So anyway, sorry to interrupt. No, you're fine. Only here at O.L.R. can we relate Tony Hawk Pro skateboarding to figure skate discussion.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:07.000
So there was. So what's kind of cool, though, is this is being done by various visions. So they're the ones behind the Crash Bandicoot remakes.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:15.000
So one of their goals was basically to have the game still feel like the original game.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:21.000
So all of the not necessarily bugs, but like kind of quirks of the original game and everything.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:29.000
What's kind of cool, though, too, is apparently if you did like, of course, they're trying to push pre-orders and stuff. If you wanted to do that, you get to actually play.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:36.000
They have like a kind of a demo release thing that they're going to put out. That's the I can't remember the stage is called.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:43.000
It's the warehouse, I believe, that you can actually check out and stuff. I don't know. It's pretty fun.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Yeah, like I'm kind of into it, too. Like, you know, I don't think I really got into the Tony Hawk games.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Like I remember games like Skate or Die and 720 in California games and those like I'm going really old school there, but I didn't really get into the Tony Hawk games.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:08.000
But I think I think they'd be kind of fun to revisit. I kind of be down. Yeah. Dad, you're embarrassing me.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I'm just picturing dads across the nation picking up these Tony Hawk remasters and playing them all over again. All right. Cool. All right.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Well, moving on, let's talk about some big gaming news from this week. That is the unveiling of the unreal five engine.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:30.000
That's right. A PlayStation five tech demo was shown off for the unreal five engine, which was announced in one of those streams that they're doing for the summer game fest.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:38.000
So this was like they did an interview with Jeff Keighley, because you remember how I was being a little bit like isn't summer game fest like just news announcements?

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:44.000
But this was actually something produced by them because Jeff Keighley was involved to sit down interview and they really hyped it up.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
And, you know, they hyped up this interview. It was a mystery thing. And then they did it.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:56.000
And of course, some Twitter people were like, that's it. And I'm thinking in the back of my mind, I'm like, do you know how many of your games are powered by unreal engine?

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Like this might not seem like a big deal, but it's a very big deal because this is what the future of gaming is going to look like.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000
And they showed a little video and I'm sorry, I don't have it here for our Twitch viewers, but I'm sure plenty of you have seen it.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:19.000
It's a it's a don't call it Tomb Raider, but it sure looks awfully similar of this, you know, gal who's running through tombs, I guess, and, you know, running cliffs and jumping.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:26.000
And it's very smooth. It's 30 frames a second, but 1440p, it looks very good and, you know, kind of has me hyped.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I'm like, OK, all right, this looks really cool. You know, this is how they're pushing, you know, graphics and so forth.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:41.000
So, yeah, they did that whole unveil that game, that demo that they showed, though, even though they say it is playable, it is it is not at this time a game.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Sometimes tech demos turn into games like we play.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Was that what it was on the weed that was just basically like all their tech demos?

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Yes. E3 demos or the three, two, one, one, two, three switch.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.000
That's like all their tech demos thrown into a game to switch and whatever that one to do this game.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000
One, two. Why aren't you ever on sale? Yeah.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
I still want $40 for this game. One, two, bundle it in already. All right.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Anyway, but so that's not to say it couldn't ever be a game, at least that's not the plan at this point anyway.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000
And that's you know, that there's a lot of stuff that never becomes a game.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:25.000
The Final Fantasy six, when they did it in 3D back in the day, like that whole demo in Nintendo 64, like that never became an actual thing.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
So not everything becomes a thing anyway.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000
So they showed this off, this demo, and it's got some oohs and aahs.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000
And yeah, the Unreal Engine 5, it's coming out next year.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000
So that's interesting because that means the games that are going to launch on PlayStation 5,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Xbox Series X are not going to be in this, which it's not like that's the only engine out there.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Many companies have their own in-house engines that they build.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:55.000
So that's fine. But it's interesting this is going to be there at first.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
That is going to be something that they're working on.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.000
It should be pointed out that there is Unreal Engine 4.25.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
So the current Unreal Engine does support next generation hardware.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
So that's not to say there won't be anything in Unreal.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:11.000
It just won't be in Unreal 5 until after this is out, as you can imagine.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.000
The other big news about Unreal, and I think this is a big deal,

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:21.000
the royalties are now waived on your first million dollars in game revenue.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000
That's right, you can build games for free in Unreal Engine,

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000
and royalties are waived on your first million dollars.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
And these are retroactive terms to January 1, 2020.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I mean, how many indie developers out there never see that kind of money,

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
you know, and are already having a cut to get out?

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.000
This is a great, great thing for small developers, indie developers.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.000
That's amazing news that, you know, that's going to be royalty free for the first million.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:57.000
I am expecting great things of the Unreal 5 version of Super Multitasking, I just have to say.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Now, one of the things...

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Those pixels better be razor sharp.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Now, one other thing to talk about with Unreal Engine 5,

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
because sometimes when we've talked about brand new cutting edge engines,

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
the question is, what about Switch, though?

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Real quick, there's one more piece to that as well.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:20.000
So the other thing that they did was they opened up the framework that they use for Fortnite

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:26.000
for their multiplayer servers and matchmaking and all that stuff.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
And now that's available for free as well.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.000
It's platform agnostic, so you can use it in Unreal, Unity, whatever you want to use it in.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Now, when it comes to the Switch, the question is, is it going to be there, is it going to run on it?

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.000
And the short answer is, yes, obviously it's not going to have the same power,

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.000
but the engine that you build the game in, it can still work on Switch as well.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
And Unreal Engine 4 fully works on Switch right now,

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
and Unreal 5, they will continue to have that Switch report.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000
It may not have every feature, it may not run the same,

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.000
but it's going to be available for Switch development, so that, I believe, is a good thing.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Now, sorry, I've been ignoring chat while I've been getting to all this,

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
but I want to get to some of the comments in chat.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Let's see, VGRealness says,

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
maybe the Summer Games thing is what's going to take the place of E3,

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.000
as there doesn't seem to be much hype around the IGN E3 replacement.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Wait until a little closer to that second week in June,

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
or whenever they ultimately schedule that for.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.000
You know, Twitter and social media is very much a live in the now kind of place.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000
And so, I think the fact that there's, what is there to get hyped about?

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Turn on my computer and look at the latest thing on IGN, right?

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Like, E3 you get hype about because you get up, you go,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
you might make plans to watch press conferences with friends,

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
or even Sony did that movie theater thing, right?

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
But obviously that's all different right now.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
And you drink heavily after all the social anxiety gets you.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Yes, yes. So, that's not really happening this year.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000
So, I don't know if it's to say that the buzz won't be there.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I think it's just, once the news is out there, it will spread like wildfire,

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
no matter where it comes from.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Anyway, actdeftinchat says,

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
though like I said earlier, it's cool that the tech is going to be amazing,

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
but what does this all mean to us, the general consumer?

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Especially this being shown for the PlayStation 5.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
All hype, no substance.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Well, wait until that IGN thing or when E3 would have been.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Keep in mind, what we saw out of this was,

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000
I think they even said was going to be the game developers conference.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000
And obviously that got put on hold and didn't happen.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Wait for those, you know, Sony.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000
At least it was more entertaining than Mark Cerny's talk.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Well, for you, but if you're a developer,

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000
you might have found Mark Cerny's talk very fascinating.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.000
No, that new material or like, you know, material aside,

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
and the material was both very interesting.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
It's just the presentation of it.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
One is certainly more interesting than the other one.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Don't even remotely slander the man who made Marble Madness, okay?

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Don't. All right, anyway.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Unreal 5, Marble Madness?

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000
But here. But, you know, let's see where we are in June or I guess July,

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
because Microsoft has basically said,

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000
we're going to show Halo in July and the other games too, right?

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000
So, you know, wait until there,

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
and I think you're going to find that hype level you're looking for

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
when we start to get to the stuff that is really targeted at the game.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
to get to the stuff that is really targeted at the consumer.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
So I wouldn't feel lack of hype right now,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
because we are still May, this is early,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000
we don't usually get to find out the good stuff, not until June,

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000
and then you're going to have to assume with everything that's going on with the pandemic,

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000
it may be like July, August, it's going to be like summer long,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
so when the companies are ready to unveil that stuff.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000
So, you know, I think the hype will still be there,

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
you're just going to have to give it a little longer, that's all.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:59.000
So, alright, let's move on and get into some other news.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Darsakra.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Well, and this actually kind of goes back to where we were starting

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000
right at the beginning of the show with all the people using their online games

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:16.000
for, you know, more often and for staying in contact with people,

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:23.000
but the video game industry in the US has set a sales record for the first quarter.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000
They're attributing it mostly to people staying at home,

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.000
for people having nothing to do but stay home and play video games.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000
So they have set a record of 10.86 billion,

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:42.000
which is 9% higher compared to the same spending in the same quarter of 2019,

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
so it's up 9% from last year.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:55.000
And of that total, 9.58 billion was spent on video game content with an 11% increase.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000
They did mention big sellers, of course, being Animal Crossing New Horizon,

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare, Doom Eternal, Dragon Ball Z, Kakaroto,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Fortnite, Grand Theft Auto 5, Minecraft, MLB The Show 20,

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
and NBA 2K20 as the best performing games.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000
And of course, the Switch sold its absolute best.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:25.000
It led the market with a 2% increase, so the sales went to $773 million,

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:30.000
and with their accessories, that went up 1% to $503 million.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.000
So taking all those numbers away from it, because I can say numbers all day,

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
but what does that mean to us?

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000
It means that we are seeing more people gaming.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:48.000
We're seeing people who are using gaming as their therapy,

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
as we mentioned earlier, right?

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:59.000
And the people who are, in general, just looking to their games

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:05.000
as their big replacement, I think, for all of the other external things they used to do.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.000
So in that respect, this surprises no one really, or it should surprise nobody.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Nana, what do you think?

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Yeah, with the current state of the world, you're right.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000
It doesn't really surprise me.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000
The Switch going cuckoo bananas with everything Animal Crossing doing the same.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I like that, cuckoo bananas.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Doesn't really surprise me either.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.000
I'm sure Jackbox Games probably is doing very well, and as I mentioned earlier,

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000
as well, again, not that this is how you want to profit, but it is what it is.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000
And so, yeah, with more people being at home,

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000
and I know some folks are still working and all that, but you have a lot of unemployed.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Unemployment is really high, really high right now with all the service industry and everything.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
It's very high.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:58.000
So there's a lot of people that are playing video games to give them peace of mind.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
They didn't have video games in the Great Depression.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Of course, they also didn't have remotely the social programs we have now.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Thank you, FDR, except, you know, again, not going to comment and ruined.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:14.000
But I'm saying, you know, this is the perfect distraction,

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000
the perfect thing for people who are looking for an outlet.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000
So, of course, they're going to be going into, you know, buying more systems.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000
I mean, well, how long were Switches unavailable?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000
They're just now coming back in office.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Why am I saying office? It's like I'm going to work.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.000
They're just now coming back into stores for availability.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Yeah, Alan got one a week ago, but it was, you know, he had to get the text message alert when they were in stock.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Did he have to kill for it?

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Yeah, it was that whole thing. He had to really, like, work for it, basically.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Yeah, and I'm quite happy to have him as my AC buddy and to give him all my unneeded DIYs.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Yeah, his town's really coming along, actually.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
I need to just do a live stream of Animal Crossing already, but, you know.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
I did one when I first started playing.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.000
I should probably do another, but my audio goes kind of funky going through my MacBook.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000
So, actually, and I didn't talk about this during my gaming week, but it is important.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:20.000
I've been using my office for work and still my gaming and everything, and that's why I'm like,

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000
I don't know if I want to sit in there for even longer and do streaming, but I probably will at some point.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000
But I did some minor upgrades in my computer this week.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:34.000
I finally got that power supply, and I want to thank everybody for those very lovely offers that you all made,

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.000
but it finally came through. I got the power supply, and Alan put it in the computer today, actually,

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000
and the new graphics card, which isn't a huge step up in the graphics department,

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.000
but also more fans to try to prevent some of the other issues I was having.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.000
So, yeah, so the good news is that computer's all up and running now,

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
so I didn't want to, like, set up the capture card and everything,

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
just because I knew the thing was going to get torn apart and put back together.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000
But maybe that's something I can look at doing now, because there's just a little more oomph in there now.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.000
So, I actually was looking at my streaming setup earlier this week because I was watching somebody,

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000
and I was like, I need to figure out how to do certain things in there.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:16.000
It's such an OBS noob, but, like, I finally figured out that you can actually organize your scenes,

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:21.000
where you have multiple different sets of scenes, because before I just had it all dumped in the one.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.000
And I remember telling you, I was like, well, this is annoying, because, like, I have my DDR setup here,

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
and it's mixed in with my Skyrim setup.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Oh, you mean, like, having the profiles, switching between the different profiles.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Yeah, you can switch between, like, different profiles in there, and I was like, I just figured that out this week.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:42.000
God, you know, like, it just takes me so long to figure this stuff out.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000
But, you know, you're not going to know until you dive in there.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Jump in there and try it, that's for sure.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000
All right, anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about some other gaming news. Loki.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000
All right, so this is pretty exciting.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:02.000
So, this week, Konami released a new DDR game that you can actually play in your browser.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:09.000
So, Dance Dance Revolution V, which, it's technically in alpha right now, but it is available to play.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:14.000
There's 15 songs available on there from Dance Dance Revolution A and A20.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:21.000
And right now, you can play with your keyboard, although I assume if you have, you know, a mat or something like that,

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:27.000
that you want to hook up, that you can map it out to the keys and everything and be just fine.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:33.000
It's kind of basic right now. I mean, they don't have any modifications.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.000
You can do the songs, no speed mods or anything. They do have, you know, the four difficulties per song.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:42.000
It's only single player. And yeah, but it is pretty cool.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:46.000
You do need an EMUs account to set up, you know, that.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:52.000
So, if you have that, you can log in. I can check it out. And it's running in Unity.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000
God, I don't even know if I were to remember my login, but if I have the car.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Oh my God, in Unity?

01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.000
It's in Unity.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Wow.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.000
If I had my card somewhere, maybe I could figure it out. Did you actually play it, Logie?

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000
I did play it.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000
What'd you think?

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:12.000
A little bit. It's all right. I mean, it looks just like, you know, DDR.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
They've got, you know, everything in the backgrounds and everything.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:19.000
And, you know, I try to take it apart, you know, because that's me.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
So, I took a-

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
I may have or may have not done that.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:29.000
So, I took a pass on it. I haven't played it yet. And I'm just kind of like, I heard the news and I was like, oh, okay.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:36.000
And I kind of took some shit on Discord for my opinion because, you know, I basically said, well, here we are again.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
And, you know, again, we've been doing this show a very long time.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000
And I feel like in the early years of the show, especially, there was a very common theme.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000
And that was that Konami never wanted to take risks in America.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Like, DDR was released here kicking and screaming and subparly. Remember?

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000
DDR USA mix, not as strong as what they have had over there.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:02.000
And then when the DDR stuff. So, it was like, you know, and finally, maybe around the time Supernova finally came out.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Like, finally, somebody at Konami figured out, oh, yeah, like, I guess there is, you know, a whole market for DDR there in the US.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
And they've done this with a lot of other products too.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:16.000
So, my point is, is I'm like, here we are again. It's another product. It's just for Japan.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:24.000
So, it's just one of those, I have a very, and I didn't say this on Discord, and I think this would explain my position a lot more eloquently.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:31.000
I have a very similar approach to this that I do, Phantasy Star Universe, I'm sorry, Phantasy Star Online 2 or PSO2.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Yes, I'm aware it's been out in Japan for eight years.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Yes, I'm aware I could have downloaded a translation patch and played it.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.000
I'm not going to because Sega didn't want me to.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000
And that's how I feel about this. End of story.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Yeah, and this is, it's okay. I mean, the timing windows are extremely forgiving.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:00.000
I mean, it's just like, it was super easy for me to AAA a song and like, I clearly wasn't hitting it at the right time.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:10.000
So, I don't know. And there's some things that they do that are pretty dumb, like the scoring and everything sent by plain text.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.000
And I mean, that could be totally exploited if you wanted to.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:20.000
But in fairness, it's all like an early alpha, like it's a first release, like it's a preview, I guess.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.000
So all of these things could be addressed. Like maybe they do have plans for international rollout.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Maybe they do have plans for this, but I'll just, I can wait. I can wait.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Yeah, I mean, I don't know why they couldn't just put Ace or A20 or whatever on PC because it runs on PC in the arcade anyways.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:43.000
So like it runs on Windows XP. I mean, come on. I think I think you can handle it can handle this.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:49.000
I don't know why we need to port it over the unity aside from, you know, doing the streaming assets and stuff like that.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:54.000
It makes it a little bit easier that way. Maybe they can build a monetization for new song packs and stuff like that.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:02.000
But I don't know. Like, I wish it was. I like to see where this goes.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Like, because it would be cool, like if we could get like an official PC version of Dance Mania running or not Dance Mania, Dance Dance Revolution.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:18.000
I'll load that up on my cabinet as an option to play, like if I could do that. But like, I don't know.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Let me get to some comments from Discord, because we did have there was a discussion about it earlier in the week, and then there was a little more today.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:31.000
And I don't even know this is going on, but I see a comment from Dark Tetsuya responding to a YYR comment, which we'll read in a minute.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Dark Tetsuya says, I heard a certain someone got death threats, hate mail in his inbox, since he works at Konami in their Japanese offices.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Like, what the fuck, seriously? Okay, yeah, that is fucking gross and extreme.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:52.000
And like, even if I'm sitting here going, meh, like, I would never condone, you guys know, I would never condone that level of, and I don't even, what the fuck is prompting people to go that far with it?

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Entitlement.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Who cares?

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
I guess.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:04.000
It's the same thing, that's why those idiots are protesting it, you know, wherever their capitals are. It's entitlement, it's people wanting what they want when they want, little Veruca salts.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Is it that or is it, oh, we're mad because it's only 15 songs and it doesn't have DDR, third mix, fourth mix?

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
It's an alpha, who cares?

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
That's, that, that is a bit extreme.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:19.000
YYR's comment says, as far as DDRV goes, I think it goes to show that gamers will complain about anything.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Yes, it feels very early and rough around the edges, but I can't believe they released something for free that works with dance pads and contains current songs.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Hell, it's got Golden League stuff in it that's a royal bitch to unlock in the actual game.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.000
If anything, it's a token of goodwill above all, and yet we're giving them shit about it. Not a good look.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:44.000
So I don't know if that's a comment for me, because it says we're giving them shit about it, or it's a comment for the extreme, like, crazy people, like Dark Tetsuya was referring to.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
So I don't know.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
I hope so.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:55.000
But, you know, it could be me, it's fine because I was talking negatively about it in Discord, but I'm going to stand by what I said with the whole PSU too.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:10.000
And again, the thing that just kind of irks me about it is that I see this very familiar pattern from the past that I hated in the past, and I'm not exactly, and yes, I'm well aware.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:18.000
I could just, you know, go on and get through a little Japanese and do it and play. You know what? I don't want to.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:25.000
You know what? It's fine. I think we have the right to criticize it because, dude, we've supported them from the beginning.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Exactly.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Through all of their games, and even DDRPC and all that, like, garbage.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Tell you what, you bought that one, was it Beaten Groovy or whatever?

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Yes. I mean, I bought Beaten Groovy.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000
It's just a reminder.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:43.000
I have the right to be critical, I think, of Konami products.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000
I mean, like, you know.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000
There's a difference between being critical and then just being a complainer.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Exactly.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000
You know what I mean?

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Yeah. So, and again, and if that comment is that the crazy people that Dartis is referring to, then I'm with you.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Like, just in general, that kind of cyberbullying that goes on around games and stuff is dumb.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:08.000
And even from my own perspective, when Konami finally decides to invite me to the table, just like in the past, when they did have a subpar USA mix,

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:14.000
the three of us were there every fucking Wednesday night putting dollars in that machine playing it, even if it was USA mix.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000
And when they were-

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000
But it did kind of pay off for us.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Yeah. And when they released the PlayStation USA version, we all fucking bought it.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
I bought that fucking Disney.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.000
I bought that Konami.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I'll be here to consume it when, you know, they put it out.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000
So we imported all that stuff too.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
So, I mean, like, we bought it twice.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000
But I like-

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000
And we also didn't buy it.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
But I like the theory.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I like the theory that because it's early, maybe international versions are in the plan for a later rollout.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Cool. I'll see you then.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:54.000
So, all right, let's move on with some more stories, which I think the next one is mine, actually.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000
So let's talk about the PlayStation Studios brand.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:06.000
So, yeah, there's not like a new company launched within PlayStation, but I guess you could say like a new branding, if you will.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000
A first party game is under the PlayStation Studios brand.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:15.000
So the internal studios, meaning Naughty Dog, Insomniac Games, Santa Monica Studios.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000
So what are we looking at there?

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Like, Last of Us, God of War.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Those big PlayStation exclusives that, you know, people are waiting for, right?

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.000
They're now all under a PlayStation Studios brand.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:34.000
This was announced alongside an opening cinematic that is going to be with new PlayStation Studios games on the console.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.000
I'm guessing that's like a throwback to the PS boot up that we used to have, right?

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Well, I mean, and also a lot of games and studios of worth have their own little, you know, boot up screen, right?

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Like I reminded me like of a movie logo, like, you know, like 20th Century Fox.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Everybody knows that one, right?

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000
That whole thing, right?

01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:00.000
And or I think even with video games like the PlayStation era of Konami, if we want to talk about that.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000
There was that whole weird CGI thing where the Konami logo comes out of the rocks.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Now, you remember that?

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
I can see it in my head.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
I'm trying to think of like modern game.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000
I know what you mean.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
And I play the doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Yes. I'm trying to think of modern game studio like splash screens that are kind of iconic.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Anyway, I was looking in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
If you guys think of any, let me know.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:31.000
But anyway, yeah, so they're going to file it all under this brand for PlayStation Studios.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:37.000
And, you know, head of global marketing, Eric Lempel, said over the last few years, even last decade,

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.000
the strength of the titles coming out from our studios has been stronger than ever.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000
We've been thinking about how we unite all of these great games under one brand.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.000
And really the purpose of that is to make the consumer understand that when they see this brand,

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:53.000
they're getting ready for a robust, innovative, deep experience that they've come to expect from games coming from PlayStation.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
So we came up with PlayStation Studios.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.000
And it is noted, Microsoft did something very similar about a year ago.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.000
When they started acquiring like Ninja Theory and Obsidian Entertainment, it's Xbox Game Studios.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:10.000
And I do think the branding there is to reinforce the exclusiveness.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:15.000
I think is what it really comes down to is that, oh, if I want to play a PlayStation Studios game,

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000
I better get a PlayStation and an Xbox Studios game.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000
I better get an Xbox or a PC that's strong enough to run it.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:27.000
So, well, and then we could get into the whole, hey, PlayStation stuff is starting to show up on PC.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:33.000
But that's a whole another chain of events that we'll get into at another time when it's more appropriate.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000
We can talk about that.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Yeah, but I think it's an interesting branding.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.000
I don't think it really like changes anything, but I think it is just to drive home.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:46.000
These are the PlayStation exclusives because we have the PlayStation 5 coming out and we want people to understand that.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
And I think that's really what it boils down to.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000
So, all right, I'm looking at some of the comments in chat.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000
S.G.O. and Hunter Matt says, the classic HBO title credits are still the best.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Bobby Blackwell says, I only really remember the turn 10 and playground game splash screens because of all the fours of playing I do.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Well, they have the neat little like looks like you're turning on a car type of thing.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
It's pretty cool. So, all right.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:16.000
For the record, there is on YouTube for the people who like the old HBO thing, there's a making of.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Of that whole opening set and how they built a real set for it.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000
It was so long and that was the best.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.000
So good.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
It was like 30 seconds long.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.000
And it was always like, oh, my God, we got the HBO preview.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Mama, you'll never hear from me again.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Sneak it up at 2 a.m. to watch.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Oh, no, that was Showtime to watch Rock and Rule, which is to this day one of my favorite movies.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Well, you know what?

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000
If we're going to throw it back, Dark Sakura, then let's throw it back with our next story.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Are we going way back?

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Are we not?

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000
I think we're going to go.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Yes, let's go back.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:59.000
We're going to get in our way back machine that you can also see next to a DeLorean on the rock and ball table.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Just saying.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Microsoft Solitaire is 30 freakin years old.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:10.000
How much of that game did we all play when we were bored?

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:15.000
A lot, because it was like that default thing everybody had, you know?

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Well, it was, you know, the the built in kind of bloatware, but at least had had some use, you know?

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.000
But at any rate, it it's it's been out.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:34.000
I mean, it's hard to think of having a computer that doesn't have, you know, some kind of solitaire.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:41.000
And, you know, and now it's got like a collection, a solitaire collection where you have, you know, the old fashioned Klondike.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.000
You have your scenes and they're bringing it in with Xbox integration now.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.000
I mean, just seeing how I remember the cards with the fishies on the back.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Yeah.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:55.000
And remember, remember your reward for beating it was the bouncing card.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Oh, and to see is funny if you.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Gosh, what was it that I did?

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Yeah, we had an old it was a friend of mine who had a computer running three windows three one one emulated on her computer and just watching the cards go all over the place.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.000
You know, is it what it is?

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:26.000
We can do that noise again, Jamie, because it was one of the Stooges, the the windows three point one one Stooges.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:32.000
V.G. realness says now it has ads and you have to pay for it to get rid of it.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Trash. No, I'm actually I've played the newer Microsoft solitaire.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:43.000
It's it's fine. It's it's it it has evolved the way many games have many free games have across the last 30 years.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
They have achievements in it, too.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:52.000
That's just you know, it's funny is that for me, it was always like, you know what?

01:30:52.000 --> 01:31:01.000
I I don't like minesweeper, which is funny because one of the first things I did with my Mac is download minesweeper.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.000
But I mean, it's it's just like that.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:10.000
It's like it's like imagining.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Not having vanilla ice cream, you know, it's just a staple, it's something that you just always expect to be there.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:22.000
I love I loved Microsoft Solitaire, but what I really loved was that pinball game on Windows 95.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Was it? Oh, yeah. Space cadet or something like that.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:31.000
I remember the name of it was like that. Wasn't there like a skiing game for a hot minute?

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Or am I thinking back to thinking ski free and that that's that wasn't part of the normal suite of games.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000
That was the other thing that they had with chips challenge and stuff.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:45.000
I remember that was called. But they also had hover.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Where's my hover remake? Mm hmm.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I I just was like.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.000
With with with that.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:02.000
It's like when I said when I when I got even when I got on to my when I remember when I put together my Linux machine,

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:07.000
one of the first things I did was find the version of solitary that ran in Debian.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:12.000
So now it's it's a staple. I mean, this game is now older than some of our listeners.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Oh, God. Well, and it's a thing where it's like, you know, my mom is not a gamer,

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:27.000
but she'd play Microsoft Solitaire. So, you know, I think it was entry level gaming for a lot of people.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000
This is this is the mobile gaming of 30 years ago, in a way. Yeah.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Indeed, it is. So. All right. But lovely throwback.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Yeah. A little bit. Not our classic game of the week, though, just to be clear.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Maybe in a later week for now.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.000
But that's that's a stretch. I did. Hey, I did Halo for y'all.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:51.000
And you also did Minesweeper at one point. So it would make sense that you would do the other Windows games.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Maybe, maybe. Anyway, maybe we'll get to the game of the week this week or maybe it's a table.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.000
We'll get to that. But we have a couple more stories for you first. Loki.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:08.000
So out of nowhere, Nintendo announces a brand new game that's coming out in a couple months and it's a Paper Mario game.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:13.000
So they have announced Paper Mario, the origami king, which is going to be coming out on the switch.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:17.000
July 17th. Looks pretty cool.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:23.000
And they had it looks like all these new folding abilities and different enemies that are all origami stuff.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Hope there's some instructions on how to actually make some of these, because that would be pretty awesome.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:35.000
And then wait, can I tinfoil had something on this? Because, yeah, here's the thing you say came out of nowhere.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:41.000
I actually don't think it came out of nowhere because just last week there was a lot of like pressure in the media about,

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.000
wow, Nintendo's going crazy with Animal Crossing and they're selling all these things.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Let's look at what's coming up next for Nintendo. Tumbleweed rolls by.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.000
There is the Xbox Chronicles Definitive Edition, and many people are hype about that.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.000
But I mean, beyond that, Tumbleweed, there's nothing really on the horizon for Nintendo,

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:00.000
because as we know, they probably would have announced this during the 3.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.000
It means the Xenoblade Chronicles.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
So what?

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
You said Xbox Chronicles.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Did I really? Jesus Christ, I'm getting old.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Xenoblade Chronicles.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:13.000
So so that, of course, is all coming at the end of this month.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Actually, it's in a couple of weeks. But beyond that, we don't have a lot of games announced.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.000
We don't know what's coming. So I kind of think they were under pressure to unveil something.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:28.000
And I think it's because, too, this probably was going to be in their E3 Nintendo Direct.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:37.000
I think this coming out now is proof that the E3 Direct is not going to happen when you think it is.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:42.000
It's going to happen end of June or early July. So they had to get this one out now.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
That's my tinfoil hat theory.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
I guess that makes sense, yeah.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:52.000
It looks cool. I haven't played a Paper Mario game since Super Paper Mario, so I don't know.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
I'll have to check it out.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Yeah, it looks cute.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Yeah. And there was someone saying online, like it says that someone had datamined, I guess, the eShop,

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:11.000
where they said that there is a version of it that's been uploaded on May 4th.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:18.000
And it looks like almost seven gigs in size. So maybe the game's already done.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Maybe. Maybe it's a strategical release thing. You know, it's like it's their summer title. Who knows?

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Cheeseburger in our chat room. Cheeseburger94 says, I'm stoked for New Paper Mario.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000
I really hope it will be more like the original two games.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:36.000
And bonds006 says, Nintendo, show them something to keep the money coming in.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:40.000
I still think Animal Crossing is doing plenty good for them for a little while.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Animal Crossing is printing money.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:48.000
It is. But okay, I get the investors need something because the market is a crazy place right now.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.000
So the investors need something to see in the future. So here's something for them.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.000
But this wasn't it, right? Look, there was something a little something else, too, right?

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Speaking of something for people that have invested money into like Nintendo's online service,

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:09.000
there's some more games that you can play in your Super NES and NES channel stuff.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:17.000
So they've got on the NES side of the house, Rygar and Puzzle de Pon or Panel de Pon.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:24.000
And then on the Super Nintendo, we have I'm sorry.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.000
So actually, no, it looks like that would be a super Nintendo.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Yeah, I was like, Panel de Pon was Super Nintendo, I believe. Yeah. Sorry.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Yeah, it's it's the the Super Famicom box art that's throwing me.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
So on the NES side, we just have Rygar.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:42.000
And then on the Super Nintendo side, we have Wild Guns, Panel de Pon and Operation Logic Bomb.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Well, and to be to be fair, you can't be expected to know everything about Panel de Pon,

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:52.000
because it's a rare release where this never was released in the U.S. Tetris Attack.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Yes, I know. We got it in other type of branded situations.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000
But the actual Panel de Pon game was only ever released in Japan.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
So this is another one of those.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:07.000
And this kind of happened to us when we got like Mario 2 loss levels in the library.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000
We didn't get it in All-Stars.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:13.000
We got the actual like Super Mario 2 Famicom ROM in the U.S. library.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:16.000
So this is kind of something like that. So that's that's kind of neat.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Yeah. But Rygar with save states will be awesome.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Absolutely. God, I mean, Rygar is only going to benefit from everything in that emulator.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000
And Rygar is a great choice. I love that game.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Yeah. All those are going to be available on May 20th.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
So look forward to those this week.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I mean, it would be nice if those types of releases were a little more frequent,

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:39.000
but all things said and done, it's not a terrible lineup for a month.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.000
So I'll take it.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
That's not too bad. Yeah.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I'm actually hyped for Rygar.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
I got it on NES recently,

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:51.000
but having it on Nintendo Switch Online would be nice since you can save state.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Absolutely. Bobby Black Wolf says they can't use the Tetris name.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:58.000
So that's why it's paneled upon and not Tetris Attack.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Tetris company won't allow them to use the Tetris name since it's not Tetris.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000
And VG Realness says it's totally Tetris Attack. LOL.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Yes. I mean, it is. It is the equivalent.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Like paneled upon and Tetris Attack is like Puyo Puyo and Kirby's Avalanche

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
or Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
It is exactly like it is the same damn game,

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:20.000
but they just splash the familiar characters in it.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:25.000
So in paneled upon, are there any recognizable characters in paneled upon?

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.000
I think there's like a smash move from that game or something,

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000
but that's like it.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:32.000
That's like it. It's a very otherwise kind of obscure Nintendo title

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
and more people will remember Tetris Attack

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.000
or it's Pokemon Puzzle League is the same game, isn't it?

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000
I think it is.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Planet Puzzle League?

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:44.000
No, Pokemon Puzzle League and then later Planet Puzzle League.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
I think they're all paneled upon.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Yeah.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.000
So you kind of get the old school, the first version of that.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.000
All right. Bobby Black Wolf says paneled upon has original characters.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
The US localization made it Yoshi characters.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Well, that was Tetris Attack had the Yoshi characters, right?

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
If I remember right.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Yeah.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Yep. Thank you.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Bobby says Pokemon Puzzle League on N64 is paneled upon.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
That's what I thought.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
So all right.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Well, I'm glad we have that all cleared up.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000
That's a fun puzzle game, though.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.000
I love Pokemon Puzzle League because that was the game I kind of found first

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.000
and then I heard, oh, it was based off all these other games

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000
and I kind of discovered them.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Let's talk a little bit about Discord.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.000
You know, video chat and all that is very popular right now

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
with all the social distancing going on

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
and people not able to really hang out in person.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:33.000
So there's a lot of virtual things that are being used.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
And video chat is one of them.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Obviously, Zoom, if we want to talk about Cuckoo Banana sales,

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Zoom is one of those companies that's been doing very well in this situation.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
And I think you're seeing a lot of other, you know,

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000
conferencing competitors taking steps to be in that space.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000
I know Skype's been doing a lot of upgrades for better or for worse,

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
and I would say for worse.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.000
I had another, and this is what, again,

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.000
if you want to know why this show isn't using Skype anymore.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
So you know I do my survivor LARPs, right?

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.000
So I'm like on the production team for, I'm not playing it,

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.000
but I'm just kind of like helping to oversee it and all that stuff this week

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
and have for the past couple of weeks.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:13.000
And so the newest version of Skype on PC broke my recording

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.000
because for whatever reason, it doesn't integrate through the desktop audio anymore.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000
It decides to use its own audio thing with no warning or change or whatever.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000
So those are the types of things that Skype just does to make things better

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
that have me very irritated with it.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Anyway, on the other side, Discord doing some things to improve itself a little bit,

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.000
especially when more and more people are using video conferencing.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
And now Discord already had video chat,

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.000
but now it has server video chat for desktop, web, and iOS.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000
So again, Discord has had this since 2017,

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.000
and obviously Bobby and the studio here,

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.000
we've been using video chat to talk to each other for a while.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
So this is a little something new.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:59.000
What this is, is now it's more like drop in and drop out conversation.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:03.000
So you can hang out in a video call with people or just be by yourself

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:06.000
and people can see that you're there and drop in and talk to you.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:10.000
So it's almost kind of like that Zoom line that's open or a Zoom meeting that's open

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.000
and people just kind of drop in and drop out as opposed to making a call,

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
which is a little more like what Skype does.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
You have to actually call to initiate a conversation.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
That's what Discord was doing before.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
So that's kind of neat.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.000
And it is interesting how Discord is kind of positioning themselves

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
in that video chat marketplace,

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:32.000
especially when it's video chat for gamers,

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:38.000
but I see a lot of people that don't consider themselves hardcore gamers

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:43.000
more and more that are starting to use it for chats and games,

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
like D&D type of games.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:49.000
I think Discord is getting very popular with the D&D scene as far as I know.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
So kind of interesting.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Anyway, there you go.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Let's go back.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Let's go back in time to a time when we didn't have video chat online.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
It's the classic game of the week.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
And every week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.000
and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking this game out.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.000
But once a month, instead of picking a game, she likes to pick a pinball table.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
And I believe that's what we've got this week.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:20.000
So Dark Soccer is going to give us the classic pinball table of the month.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
So what did you pick for this month?

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:29.000
So I picked the machine Bride of Pinbot.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:34.000
So, yay, Bride of Pinbot, which is by itself an amazing table.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:40.000
But beyond just being an amazing table, it's actually had an update.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000
So we'll get into that just a little bit.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
So Bride of Pinbot.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Now, I will go ahead and say it was done by Jon Trudeau.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:52.000
So we know what kind of a creeper he was.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.000
But it was also done by Python.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:58.000
I'm going to mispronounce that last name, Angelou.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
And it was released by Williams.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:05.000
The table itself came out in 1991, and it is a follow-up to Pinbot,

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:12.000
which, going back into video games, Pinbot was a NES game, remember?

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.000
I do?

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Yep.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:22.000
So anyway, with Bride of Pinbot, it took that theme from Pinbot,

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:27.000
and it took it in a somewhat different direction.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Instead of the platform like you had, you had to put her eyes in.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:38.000
It kind of had this pachinko-style playfield similar to how Pinbot had.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.000
But you had other things going on with it.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:47.000
It had a rotating box with the machine's face states on the sides.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:51.000
It had raised eyes and holes, depending on which face that you were on.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Your left ramp had a saucer with a small wheel.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Single ball, that saucer would give you a random award,

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
including sometimes a timed jackpot.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:04.000
You have multi-ball, which comes after the metamorphosis,

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
where you lock the eyes and everything.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
You have the heartbeat ramp.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
I mean, it was really great.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.000
And there is, with that center ramp,

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.000
there is an interval for a shot that's worth a billion points.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:23.000
And actually getting that shot at least once

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:28.000
will let it be recorded in the special Billionaire's Club on the high score list,

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
that's separate from the main high score.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:33.000
And then once, of course, you activate all of her circuits,

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.000
then you get, I guess, kind of the wizard mode in the game.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.000
It's kind of like pre-wizard modey stuff, but, you know, a lot of those lines.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:46.000
And the voice of the machine was actually done by a singer named Stephanie Rogers.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:51.000
And it's one of the earlier games that had a modesty mode,

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
because her voice was so sultry.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:58.000
I mean, I can tell you another game that had a modesty mode,

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:04.000
that was, gosh, Big Bang Bar,

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:13.000
which was a prototype until someone was able to get the licensing for it.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:18.000
So anyway, it is one of my absolute favorite tables.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:25.000
And as you knew, you know, I had one for, I'd say, for a hot minute, right?

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
I played it long enough for me to play it at least once.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Yeah, for sure.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
So, sorry.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:36.000
So at any rate, it got an update not long ago,

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
but let me rewind a little bit back,

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:45.000
because there is actually one game that had some glitching going on in it earlier too,

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:52.000
because there was, the ROM version L7 had a multiplayer bug,

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:58.000
so they would actually have people wind back to the L6 build of the game.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:02.000
So back to that, anyway, as I was saying, there was,

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
sorry, my voice is being stupid right now.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:10.000
There was an update that's called Bride of Pinbot 2.0 that has,

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:13.000
you can get a color D&D for it.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:16.000
It has new animations, new music.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.000
The music to me, like, sounds almost like it's something out of Space Mountain.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.000
I love it.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:26.000
You know, it's just, it's beautiful.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
It has new roads in it.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:35.000
It uses the assets and then builds on it to where you're really getting a new experience with this.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
I think it's absolutely a thing of beauty.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:43.000
And you'll often see, you know, people will bring them out now for various,

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:48.000
let's say, pinball expos and classic gaming things.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:53.000
And I think, yeah, Dark Touch, I think they did do one for high speed,

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
but I hadn't played it.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:01.000
But at any rate, you can also get new translates for Bride of Pinbot 2.0.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Absolutely beautiful.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:07.000
New cabinet decals, really nice artwork.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.000
I should probably put up the footage of 2.0, shouldn't I?

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Yeah, you might want to.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Let's do that. Here we go.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:21.000
And by the way, the player in that footage is, well, it's from the channel 85VETTT.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:26.000
And, well, it was put up in 2015.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
I know it's been out for a hot minute.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:34.000
But it's really, if you can get your hands on what to play,

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.000
if you can get one to own, that would also be pretty nice.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:45.000
But it really is absolutely an amazing table, the Bride of Pinbot 2.0,

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:51.000
which, you know, we've had other fan updates and unofficial updates,

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:55.000
because you remember we were borrowing someone's Cactus Canyon continued,

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:58.000
which updates that little drama.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:03.000
I think they finally released the full ruleset for Cactus Canyon.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Of course, it doesn't have the bonus modes like continued had

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:13.000
because Skrillex is licensed for the Cowboys vs. Aliens segment.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:19.000
I should find that video and put it up again of Dan scoring that multiplayer,

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
the Cowboys vs. Aliens.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
I'm going to go back to the 1.0 footage now that you've seen 2.0.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Cool.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:30.000
But at any rate, you know, it's on my list of ones that I love.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:31.000
I've definitely owned one.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:34.000
I've had them in various states of repair.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:39.000
And it really is a worthwhile table to play, absolutely gorgeous, so much fun.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:43.000
And it's classic, which, of course, this one was followed by one

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.000
I'm not going to be discussing in the segment,

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:52.000
well, in the segment ongoing called Jackpot, which, you know, we had that too.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Jackpot's really a fun one.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.000
But of the three, I'm going to say that Bride of Pinbot,

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:01.000
and especially the Bride of Pinbot 2.0, is my favorite of that series.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
All right.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Anything else to say about the classic pinball table of the month?

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
I see.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
I think that's what she said.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Yeah, no, I see you or something like that, I think.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:14.000
I can see.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Yeah, that's what the old pinbot would do.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Now I see you.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
Now I see you.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
All right, cool.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Good pick, good pick.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
And because I've played this one at your house,

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
so I particularly remember this one.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:34.000
You played it in my garage back when I lived in Citrus Frights.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Oh, that's right.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Oh, that's right.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
It wasn't even in your new place.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Yeah, oh my gosh, it was that long ago.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:43.000
It was among our first ones, because we had Whodunnit,

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
and had Rocky and Bullinkle.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.000
At the time, yeah.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.000
And we had the rotating Judge Dredd.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:55.000
I say rotating because we've had multiple Judge Dredd's thanks to Will.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
All right.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Oh, go ahead.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
One last thing, to be a little sad,

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:04.000
I also want to give a shout out to Will, who had to put one too to sleep.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.000
That's sad.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Spitbull.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Sorry to hear that.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Midna and 1-2 got along really well.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Dark Soccer, are you hanging out to do rapid fire news?

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Are you going to cut out?

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Yeah.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Okay.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:17.000
I'll do a rapid fire.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:18.000
All right, let's get to rapid fire news.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Will you want to start us off then?

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Yeah, I guess.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Sure, like, sure, I'll do one.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:29.000
But anyway, there, you know, this goes back again to saying

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.000
that we've had to do a lot of our memorializing and events

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
in online games.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:40.000
UC Berkeley seniors are graduating in Minecraft through a Minecraft ceremony.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
I think that's cool.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:47.000
And they've actually done a recreation of the football field and everything

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:51.000
so that their little avatars can go walking across of it

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:57.000
and they put it all together and to kind of give them, you know,

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:00.000
maybe it's not the graduation that everyone wanted,

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:04.000
but it's still a really nice gesture for them to do so.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000
And then they're doing a virtual music festival with 90 performers

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000
taking part over several days.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.000
So pretty cool.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:17.000
And then last but not least, and this is happy news for all of us,

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.000
I might have done a little dance,

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:29.000
but May 22nd is the revised release date for the Turbografx 16 mini.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Yay!

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Is Konami doing something right?

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Yeah, I don't know if you got the shipping thing from Amazon.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Mine's on the 26th, but whatever.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
I'm like, I've been waiting this long.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
It'll get here when it gets here.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Well, and you know, they had a mess of them in Japan.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Oh, yeah, and I heard you could have bought it this whole time

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
if you wanted to just buy one of the ones from Japan.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:56.000
But again, I'll just wait for the one that's meant for me.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Yeah, indeed.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.000
But I'm excited for it.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
No, no, me too.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:03.000
I am absolutely just thrilled as I can be.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
I mean, we've all waited for one.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.000
I really would like...

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:09.000
I was thinking that I really wanted a Japanese one,

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:14.000
but I don't care about Tokimeki Memorial that much.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Well, then they're also putting many of the Japanese versions of the games

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
in the U.S. ones, so...

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:22.000
They are, so I get to annoy people with chowainiki again.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Well, hey, that'll give you something to talk about next week

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
on the show that's not just Animal Crossing.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.000
If it arrives.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:29.000
If it arrives, yeah.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
But yeah, but I mean, among the other games on there,

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.000
we've got Newtopia, which I love Newtopia.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
It's kind of a little Zelda-like game.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Splatterhouse, and that would be the other reason

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:42.000
I'd want the Japanese version, is for the unedited Splatterhouse.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Although, maybe you can switch your region?

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.000
But Snatcher!

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Snatcher.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:49.000
I know, there's some good stuff on there.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.000
I don't think it's translated, though.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.000
No, I don't think it is.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
You have to use a guide or something to get through it.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Y'all can finally play a real rondo of blood.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Hooray.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:59.000
That's on the PlayStation.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Hooray.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000
R-Type.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Though, R-Type.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:03.000
That makes me happy, too, because I love R-Type.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:06.000
And Extifer will get to play Alien Crush.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Oh, yeah.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Oh my god, he used to play that all day on the Wii.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
He was so into it.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.000
It was crazy.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Because the Wii had the turbo graphics stuff

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
and the backwards compatibility.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:17.000
All right.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Anyway.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.000
You know what I mean.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.000
What the hell am I saying?

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.000
The eShop.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.000
What the hell did they call it?

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Virtual...

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Or console.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Virtual console.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Virtual console.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.000
I already forgot.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:28.000
All right.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Anyway.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Dark Zara, thank you.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.000
It was lovely to have you back tonight.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
I hope you're feeling a lot better.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:34.000
I hope the show helped.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Why don't I do releases?

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:36.000
You want to?

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.000
All right.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000
All right.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Well, then.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Well, can we do the rest of it?

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:41.000
I don't have to do any more after that,

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
but I would really like to just hang around

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
and participate a little bit.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:46.000
I'm still kind of...

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Eh.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.000
All right.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Up to you.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Well, let's get through the...

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:51.000
You let me know when you're done.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Let's do the rest of the rapid fire news first.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000
So, Loki, why don't you go?

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Go show.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Okay.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:58.000
So, let's talk about free stuff.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:02.000
So, Lego Ninjago, the movie, the video game,

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:07.000
is now free on PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
until May 21st.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
So, go download it on your platform of choice

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
or all three like I did,

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:16.000
because you never know where you need free games.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.000
And it was actually pretty good.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
I actually purchased this one on the Switch

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000
a while back for my kids,

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
so I did play a little bit of it.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
And the Lego games are pretty good.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:25.000
I love the movie.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.000
And then, let's see.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
So, we're kind of wondering, you know,

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
what are these other companies going to be doing,

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.000
you know, for upcoming events and game announcements

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:39.000
since we don't really have like a formalized E3?

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Well, we now know at least what Ubisoft's doing.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:44.000
So, they have a Ubisoft Forward event

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:47.000
that's coming out on July 12th

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:50.000
that they're going to talk about their game reveals

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.000
and news and whatnot.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
So, that's going to be happening.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:58.000
It looks like 12 p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. UK,

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:01.000
on the 12th of July.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
So, neat.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
I always look forward to those.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.000
They're usually, out of the third-party companies,

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
they seem to be kind of the more,

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
the best one out of the group.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
They get some interesting hosts sometimes.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
I wonder if that'll be the case this year, too.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Yeah, I'll be curious to see how they're going to do that.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000
So, yeah.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Because they had like Joel McHale one year.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Aisha Tyler did it for a little bit.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:25.000
So, yeah.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Yeah.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:27.000
All right.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Interesting trademark spotted in Europe by Capcom.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.000
And the trademark is for Capcom Arcade Stadium.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.000
No idea what this is,

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:38.000
although the trademark indicates it could be a Nintendo Switch thing.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Capcom did do an arcade compilation

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
on the PlayStation 3, I want to say,

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
and that probably was on the 360 as well.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:46.000
So, there is that.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:49.000
I don't know if this is some type of port or update to that

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
that's going to be on the Nintendo Switch.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
It definitely sounds like a compilation of some sort.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Doesn't it?

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Yeah, it sounds like they're old school games.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
I wouldn't expect things like Street Fighter

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:01.000
and things that they've been selling in other packages to be in there,

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
but I guess anything is certainly possible.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.000
And Capcom has a lot of like old classics.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:09.000
I'm still holding up for an official release of Quiz and Dragons.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Yes, I realize all the quiz questions are dated as hell at this point,

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
because all the questions are from like 1994

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
or wherever that game came out, but...

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Let's get a new one then.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Yeah, right.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Can we have a new Quiz and Dragons?

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Yeah, why not?

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Let's get a new one.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:24.000
That would be awesome.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:28.000
I thought they did like a Quiz and Dragons for like...

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Maybe I'm thinking of something else,

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
but I thought there was a game like that

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
that was for like 3DS or something like that.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Oh shit, maybe.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.000
I don't know.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.000
I missed it if there was.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Maybe Jack can help.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Also, one of those releases that came out on the Switch,

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:41.000
you might have forgotten that this happened,

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:42.000
but it was a pretty big deal.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:45.000
The Panzer Dragoon remake was released on the Switch.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
That was a little while ago,

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:50.000
and some people had some complaints that it wasn't very good

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:53.000
and it didn't live up to the trailer and all that stuff.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Well, they did do a big update this week.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:58.000
It's up to version 1.3 now with some new options,

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
cheat codes, and other improvements.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Episode 0, a performance mode for 60 frames a second,

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.000
multi-button fire, Blue Dragon motion rework.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:10.000
They've really gone back and tried to tweak the game based on feedback.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:13.000
I have not played it myself yet to see what I think,

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:16.000
but I've heard that it's still not perfect,

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
but it's way better shaped than it was.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:22.000
That was the general consensus of what I was hearing about that remake.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
All right, let's travel around the world

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
and check out some release dates,

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:30.000
as small as they may be for this date and time in this era.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
Loki, what's coming out in the US?

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Not a whole lot.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:37.000
We've got this week, it looks like Golf With Your Friends.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
That's going to be on PC and Nintendo Switch,

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:44.000
But, Loki, what if I don't have friends?

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Well, then you can golf with nobody.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Golf with yourself.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Go golf yourself, Loki.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Go golf yourself.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
That needs to be a name of a game. That's awesome.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Go golf yourself?

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Can we put that on the list of dream games?

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Go golf yourself.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:05.000
There's been a lot of really good funny, like, what the golf and stuff like that.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:08.000
That's true. Funny golf games.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.000
They've had a few.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:10.000
All right.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
God, there's one.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
This, man, tangent time.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
So there was a golf game, actually,

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:19.000
that was on one of these PC gamer discs a while back

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
that I had gotten.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:24.000
It was like a Halloween themed golf thing.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:27.000
I used to love mini golf games.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Big fan of that.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Growing up near mini golf places.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
But, yeah, man, I need to find that.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Anyways, other games.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:36.000
They're coming out.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.000
So the wonderful 101 remastered on PC,

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
So that's coming out this week.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Cannibal Cuisine on PC,

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Nintendo Switch.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Sounds interesting.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Biped on Nintendo Switch.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
The Persistence on PC,

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
and Xbox One.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Spirit Hunter NG on Nintendo Switch.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:04.000
We've got Maneater on PC,

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Monstrum on Nintendo Switch,

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
And last but not least, Saints Row,

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
the third remaster on PC,

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.000
PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:20.000
We have a few games trickling through in Japan.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:21.000
That game you mentioned,

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:24.000
the Spirit Hunter NG in Japan,

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
is just called NG in Japan.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.000
But it looks like a scary game on the Switch,

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
where it's like spirits killing people.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
It seems like the type of thing Jamie would be into.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
She likes those Japanese horror spirits

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
or killing everybody type of things.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Oh, yeah, totally.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
So this is a Jamie game.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
That releases in Japan this week as well

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
on May the 21st.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:45.000
The other big release on the Switch

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
is a Phantasy Star Online 2,

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:48.000
ironically enough.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Because you know it's on the Switch in Japan.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.000
And this is an Episode 6 deluxe package

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:55.000
called Cloud.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
So I think it's just some type of rebundling of it

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
to celebrate like a new episode

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
that's out in Japan anyway.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
And then on the PlayStation 4,

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
I'm trying to see if we have anything this week.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
That same NG game is out as well as Phantasy Star.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
So the same game is out on the PlayStation 4.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
And that's really it for this week.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
How about the UK, DarkSakura?

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Only a couple.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:18.000
We have Saints Row 3 Remastered and Maneater.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
That would be it.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
That is it. All right.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:25.000
This is the part of the show where we get into the emails.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Do you want me to do it, or you want to do it, or what?

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
I'm not even logged in.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Okay, well, neither am I.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Is there anything important?

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
I saw an email from YYR come in at the last second.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
I'm logging in.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Oh, okay, good.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Because I am apparently the only one

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
who cleans out the inbox.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
Yes, you are.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Yes, I am.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Okay, it's loading up the email for me,

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
and I will be happy to do that.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Okay, it's loading up the email for me,

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:55.000
and I will be happy to read it as soon as it freaking co-operates.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Oh, you know what?

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:57.000
I refresh it the moment it pops.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Okay, ready?

02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Yes.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Hello, LR.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Just a quick comment on last week's discussion

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
regarding the Xbox Series X event.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:07.000
It's very easy to say, well, the games are still in development.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Maybe they're kind of early.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Maybe there isn't much to show yet.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:14.000
There should be more to show in a few months, et cetera.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:15.000
But here's the thing.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Microsoft and Sony seem like they're still planning

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:21.000
to launch their new plastic and metal boxes this holiday season.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
If that means November,

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:26.000
that's about six months from this very moment,

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.000
and it seems like some of the games

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:30.000
announced we're targeting the launch window.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Now, let's get one thing straight.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Six months is plenty of time for me

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
to add new challenges to super multitasking.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:39.000
But considering the size and scope of most AAA productions,

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:43.000
those games had damn better be within sight of their finish lines.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:44.000
If we're six months away,

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
and they barely got anything to show,

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:49.000
then either the devs have a real problem on their hands,

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
or the games need to be delayed.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.000
Anywho.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
I don't want to well actually this too much,

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
but maybe a little bit.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
But just something to keep in mind,

02:01:58.000 --> 02:01:59.000
just something to keep in mind,

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:02.000
is that a lot of times the builds for E3

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:05.000
and the types of things that are shown at these presentations

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.000
are done quite a bit in advance.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
So I don't want to deflate the point too much,

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:11.000
but it may be a little more in six months,

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
it may be like eight months, nine months,

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:17.000
just because these things are usually compiled and so forth,

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
like way more in advance.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
But I get your point.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:24.000
I'm not trying to detract from the point too much.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Moving forward.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Anywho, I hope you're all enjoying the show.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
I'll post a link in the VoG Discord

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
to something fun on Friday night.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:37.000
Eleven gamers have never heard of super multitasking before,

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:41.000
did a blind race to clear 30 challenges out of 42 in the game.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:42.000
It was pretty entertaining to watch,

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:45.000
so if you've got some time to kill, head on over and check it out.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Best wishes to all, including the listeners.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Have a great week.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Warm regards, Aaron, YYR.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Yeah, Bobby talked about that speedrun a little bit at the end of his show,

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
and so now we've talked about it on our show.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
But yeah, it is there in the Discord.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
I didn't watch it myself, but when I heard Bobby,

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.000
I guess Bobby saw it and he was talking about it a little bit,

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
and so I was like, oh, that's really cool

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:07.000
that it showed up there in a speedrun and all that stuff,

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:10.000
and I think that's a great way to get the word out.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:14.000
Again, the internet is sleeping on super multitasking.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:15.000
That game is great.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:20.000
It's just a fun little time waster but challenging thing.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:24.000
It's such a good product, and this thing should be wildfire.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
I hope it was well received by the speedrunners.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
I'm sure it was.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:31.000
So, excellent.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Oh, it was just linked in our chat room too.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:34.000
Thanks, Matt.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Cool.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Wonderful.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
All right, so if you want to email us in a future week,

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:42.000
participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to do so.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
In the meantime, we have a few more stories for you

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
before we wrap up the show.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Loki, why don't you get to it?

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:55.000
All right, so we've got the news that PUBG is adding bots on PC.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:00.000
So they're introducing, I guess, a ranked mode

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:06.000
where players can play against the best players in the world,

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:09.000
but every mode that's not necessarily ranked

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:16.000
is going to get bots to fill up the space where actual players aren't.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:21.000
So they said that they're introducing the bots

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:24.000
due to the widening skill gap among the player base.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:30.000
So it's going to allow new or bad players something easier to shoot at.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:35.000
So me, me and Bobby Blackwolf get to fight bots.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:38.000
I'm similar back with Titanfall as well,

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.000
because Titanfall used to have the main characters

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:44.000
were kind of like the Titan pilots and stuff like that,

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:48.000
and then you'd have these fodder characters that were around

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:52.000
that you would be able to easily kill to build up your experience bar

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
to call down your Titan and stuff.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:59.000
So I don't know. It's not a big deal, I think.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
See, I thought the punchline to this was going to be

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
they have to put bots in it to make sure that there's actually

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
a hundred people playing it on Stadia.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:11.000
No, that's not necessarily the reason,

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:15.000
but they said, of course, this is just the first iteration of their bots.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:19.000
In the coming months, they'll be implementing machine learning techniques

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:22.000
to monitor how humans play to improve them.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Of course, because it is a new thing that's being added to the game,

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:28.000
everybody hates it.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
What? Change? We hate that.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Yes, apparently folks are not enjoying that.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:38.000
But yeah, it's a thing that's happening.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:41.000
I thought it would have been just because maybe

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
PUBG since it's been out for a while,

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
maybe they're not filling up their matches.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
That's what I was thinking too, not to be shady,

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:50.000
but the reality is they used to be the only kid on the block,

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:53.000
and now there's tons of these types of games.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Yeah, so some of the other games,

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
like one we'll probably mention here in just a minute,

02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:01.000
could probably utilize some of these AI bots

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:07.000
to help fill out their games when it's not necessarily doing all that great.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Well, it's doing fine, but they're not filling up as quickly as they used to.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Now, I'll give it this, the AI integration

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:19.000
and the whole how it's going to learn from actual human behavior.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
That part's kind of cool.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:24.000
I'm also not super upset about it,

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:28.000
although it does kind of take the thrill out of it

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
when it's like, oh, it's a one versus 100 match,

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:33.000
but they're not really all people.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:39.000
But I always secretly wondered if Tetris 99 wasn't doing the same thing.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
They'll never tell you.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
Yeah, they'll never tell you.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
They'll never tell you.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
They'll never tell you.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
They'll never tell you.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
Yeah, they'll never tell you.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:55.000
But there's a part of me that has always wondered,

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:59.000
like, well, they could be doing it and just not saying anything.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
I don't know.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
There's a lot they could be doing, yeah.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Yeah, they don't exactly show them.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Well, no, I guess they do put a leaderboard at the end,

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
and they show all the names.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
So I guess there's that.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
It could be procedurally generated names.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
It's just like everyone is playing Overwatch and like...

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
You couldn't put conspiracy theories out there

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
without the receipts to back it up.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
There's plenty of that going on in the world already.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
It's just like Overwatch, you know,

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
when I was playing in some of those games,

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
like unranked or whatever,

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
and you're playing there,

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
and then all of a sudden the bots at the end are like,

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
yeah, good job, good game, good game, and stuff like that.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:36.000
It's like, I can't tell if these are real people or not.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
It's like, I think they're bots.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
It might be.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
All right.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Let's move on and talk a little bit about...

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:47.000
I can't believe I have the Grand Theft Auto 5 story,

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
but it's a busy week. What can I say?

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:52.000
And this is more for me than it is for Loki,

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:55.000
because I'm sure Loki bought Grand Theft Auto 5 on PC

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:58.000
a long time ago when it was first out.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
But now I have it too,

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:03.000
because the Epic Games Store has been giving it away.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:06.000
That's right. Grand Theft Auto 5 is the free game of the moment,

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
or free game of the week, I suppose,

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
on the Epic Games Store.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:13.000
Actually, I'm glad we put the show together today,

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:17.000
because it reminded me today to go in there and get it,

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
because when this was first announced,

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
the Epic Games Store, of course, crashed,

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
because everybody was like,

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
Zomagod, free Grand Theft Auto 5,

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
were stampeding into the store,

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
and of course brought it to its knees.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:33.000
So now that it's Sunday, it's very easy to get back in there and grab the game.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
So that's pretty cool.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Grand Theft Auto 5, free until May 21st.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Go get it. Go get it.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:44.000
Something I noticed when I did grab it today,

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:48.000
usually they tease what game is coming next for free.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:53.000
For this one, they put, like, a bank vault that says to be announced, basically.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
And that's what they did with Grand Theft Auto 5 as well.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Yeah. No, that's what I mean. That's what they did with Grand Theft Auto 5.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:02.000
And it's doing it again for something else next week.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
So we may, and I want to...

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
We may have another big title next week.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:12.000
I think there's a reason they made everybody turn on the two-factor authentication all of a sudden for these.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
I think we've got some big giveaways,

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
and they didn't want bots collecting them all.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
So that's kind of interesting.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
So, we'll see.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Anyway, yeah, so what else can I say?

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
It's free, Grand Theft Auto 5.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:28.000
If you're, I mean, if you're, nothing's ever truly free.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:31.000
So if you're willing to install and use the Epic Games Store,

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
which maybe you're not,

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
I'll use the store. I just won't give them my money.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
I haven't, and I haven't like...

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
Well, I've actually given them my pay for things.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
I won't give them my credit card.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:44.000
But if they ever roll out the prepaid cards,

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:47.000
then I'll finally be able to buy Tetris Effect.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
I tend to use PayPal on there, but like,

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
you know, I've got two-factor on that.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
Oh, I didn't know they took PayPal.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
I might not be opposed to using PayPal,

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
because then it's going through them.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
I'll have to think about it.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:01.000
But yeah.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
I purchased, was it the last thing I just purchased on there,

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
just because I watch this channel,

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Let's Game It Out all the time,

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:09.000
and he really likes to break satisfactory a bunch.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:12.000
And so I got that, because it looked kind of interesting.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
So I'll, you know, have to play it at some point.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
But I did, yeah, I downloaded it again,

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:20.000
or I added to my library, Grand Theft Auto 5.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Although I have it on PC already,

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:25.000
and trying to get all my PC accounts,

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
or all my accounts for Grand Theft Auto 5,

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
because I got on like every platform,

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:32.000
is really hard to get those all merged together.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
I don't play Grand Theft Auto Online,

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
so it's not, I mean, that's really what it's for,

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:39.000
but I'm wondering how this is going to work.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
I guess I could just log into my Rockstar Games account,

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.000
and they'll be fine.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:43.000
All right.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Well, let's move on with another story, Loki.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:48.000
All right.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:52.000
And then we talked a little bit about some issues with Valorant,

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:58.000
and their whole controversial anti-cheat system as well.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:03.000
Well, apparently it's working somewhat well,

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:09.000
because they have banned 8,873 cheaters because of it.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:14.000
So, I mean, that's something, I guess.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
But yeah, I don't know.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Still, people don't like it.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Bye, cheaters.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Bye.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
Yeah, because there's folks saying,

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
you know, I spent so much money on this crap,

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:25.000
and then I get banned.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:28.000
What the hell, you know?

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:32.000
But it was a person that was on a cheating forum.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:33.000
I don't know.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:36.000
Like, don't cheat in games, or don't cheat in online games.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Yeah, don't cheat in online multiplayer games.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Cheat in single-player games all you want.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Yeah, just don't cheat in online games.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Exactly.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:46.000
All right.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:47.000
Well, one more story for you guys,

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
and I think this might have been a game

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
that Loki was referring to earlier.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:54.000
It's another one of those battle royale type of games.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:58.000
This may have actually, was the Culling one of the first ones

02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:59.000
that actually did it?

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.000
It was, yeah.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:01.000
So they have the Culling,

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:04.000
and then there was the Culling 2 that came out not too long ago,

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
and the Culling 2 is hot garbage

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
that literally no one was playing.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
It was, like, completely empty.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:13.000
Well, and then now we have the Culling Origins, right?

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:16.000
Yeah, the Culling Origins is basically the first game again,

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
but they kind of remastered it,

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:21.000
but they've re-released it with a new,

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
it's free to play now.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Well...

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:25.000
Sort of.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:26.000
No.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:27.000
Not exactly.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:28.000
It was free to play.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
You have to buy the game for $5.99 now,

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
so you buy the game for $5.99,

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
and then the developers, Aviant,

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
is going to be charging players a fee

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:39.000
if you want to play more than one match in a day.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:42.000
You have to buy token packs or weekly, monthly passes

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
just to play the game.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Yeah, so what it was before,

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:49.000
so it was $5.99 before for the base game,

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
and then they sold skins in there,

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:54.000
and apparently no one was buying the skins,

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:58.000
and then now they're charging $5.99 for the game

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:01.000
and then charging for folks to play the game,

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
but, like...

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
That's not smart.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:06.000
Like...

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:07.000
No.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
If you, like, what you need to do,

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
like, if you believe your game,

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:14.000
like, honestly, this pricing model just says

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
your game isn't worth it.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:19.000
This pricing model just says this game isn't worth it.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Because if it was worth it,

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
you would just charge $19.99,

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
which is what PUBG's been charging for a long time.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
They charge more than that, right? $24.99?

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Just charge $19.99 and get rid of the stupid thing.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:35.000
Yeah, I don't think they can charge $19.99 for this game

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
because if it's anything like the calling 2 was,

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
it is garbage.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
Then it's not worth it. Your game's not worth it.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:44.000
So, yeah, I mean...

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
It's unfortunate.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
You know, it's just coming back,

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
you get it that you did it first,

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
or you were one of the first people to do it,

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
but just because you did it first doesn't mean you're the best.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:57.000
It certainly doesn't mean that if you were the best at one time

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
that you're the best now.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:06.000
Let me have a very frank discussion with the creators of the culling

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:09.000
because I can relate to you on a certain level.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:13.000
If doing it first meant you were gonna be the biggest and richest,

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:14.000
guess what?

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:17.000
We'd have people listening to this podcast.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:22.000
So, take it from me, culling.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
You're fucked.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:27.000
You're just gonna have to enjoy your nice...

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:31.000
Enjoy the fans you do have, because that's what we do.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
Enjoy the fans you do have,

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:36.000
because nickel and diming them like this and all,

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:39.000
that's just... It ain't gonna fly.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
It's not gonna work. Take it from us.

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:44.000
Just because you're the oldest doesn't mean you're the most well-received.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:48.000
So, it's just not a very good solution to the problem

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:53.000
which was that they couldn't get people interested in buying their skin packs and stuff

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:56.000
and so they weren't making enough money to run the servers.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:00.000
Fine, I get that, but this isn't the way to do it either

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:06.000
because what you needed to do was instead make some more interesting items for people to buy

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:09.000
and do it that way.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
You have to do free-to-play, especially in this space

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:15.000
because you have very good competition doing free-to-play

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:18.000
and then you have folks doing the pay-to-play stuff

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
but they're not charging per game.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Honestly, maybe, and I don't mean to sound like a bitch,

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:28.000
but maybe you should ask yourself,

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:35.000
is this product good enough to be taking up space on the server in the first place?

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:42.000
Yeah, it's just, I don't know. I don't know why anyone would try to do this

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:46.000
and we've seen bigger companies fail at this as well.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.000
I mean, so, you know, Radical Heights, anyone?

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:53.000
I just, I don't see them succeeding.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:56.000
We're gonna send our thoughts and prayers.

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
That's what we'll do.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
All right.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:03.000
Anyhow, let's move on.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
Anyhow, let's move on.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:08.000
If you guys have some comments or some topics that we didn't address yet

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:11.000
that you'd like us to, we open up the listener roundtable via the chat room

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
if you guys have any questions or further comment

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:16.000
as we interact live with you guys live on Sunday night

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:19.000
here at twitch.tv slash vog network

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:23.000
for here, our 820th episode for May the 17th.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
VG Realness in Chat says,

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:29.000
LOL, I don't mean to sound like a bitch, but love you Rob.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:33.000
Well, look, I'm just calling it like it is.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:37.000
We all read this story about the culling and rolled our collective eyes.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
Like it's just, it's not a good idea.

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:43.000
And I'm just, I'm trying to be as nice as possible about it.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:46.000
But sometimes you have to show a little tough love.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Okay.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:51.000
It's just, it's such a crowded space nowadays.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:55.000
There's so many like light podcasting.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Remember when there were only like 15 gaming podcasts on iTunes?

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:02.000
Remember you've got like fricking call of duty in that space.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:06.000
Now you've got, you know, not Overwatch, you've got, um,

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Fortnite and you've got, um,

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:12.000
I would say things like Overwatch.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
And I mean, I know they're not one versus a hundred.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:15.000
I would still say they take,

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
they take the player base and those types of games.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:21.000
Yeah. I mean, you've, you've got a lot of people competing in that space

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
and I'm sorry, but like if your game,

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:27.000
you're coming off a game that was just hot garbage and no one was playing it.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:30.000
And now you're bringing back the old game and all you're doing is putting a

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
really stupid payment model on it.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
I don't think anyone cares.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:37.000
No one's going to come back now to be fair.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:41.000
And the only credit I'm ever giving them on this is just that the eight ninety

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:45.000
nine that you have to pay for the game or whatever is only if you didn't know

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:46.000
in the original.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:50.000
But still, it's just it's a stupid payment model.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:51.000
I mean, you're going to,

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:54.000
you're going to have people trying that out once a day or whatever.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:59.000
And you and granted, you could possibly earn additional credits if you come in

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
first with these shit.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:07.000
So if you actually play a game and you find out,

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:10.000
hey, look, there's no one online playing this.

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:13.000
I mean, what's to say? Like if you get disconnected because their servers are

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:16.000
trash, what's to say that there's no one in the game?

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:19.000
I mean, I just have a feeling that people are going to check it out and they're

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:22.000
like, nope, I'm gonna go play something else or they're just not even going to

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
give it any time of day. And it's just gonna be dead.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:27.000
It's just gonna be dead extremely quickly.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:32.000
They're happy to backtrack or do something different.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:35.000
All right. Well, do we have any last minute stories?

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:39.000
OK. Or Jamie, if either of you have any last minute stories.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:42.000
I don't really have anything last minute.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:47.000
Things kind of go a little bit back and forth, don't they?

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:50.000
Well, I was didn't really have a last minute story,

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:53.000
but this was brought to my attention just before I started the show.

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:59.000
So I was watching one of my game dev YouTubers and stuff talking about game jams and stuff like that.

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:04.000
So there's one of the things that was sponsored by that video is this thing called core,

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:08.000
which is this like a platform that you can build games.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:11.000
And then there's like a dozen or dozens of them out there.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:19.000
This one, though, I'm not it's built off of the unreal engine and all the art assets look like it's straight out of Fortnite.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:24.000
I mean, it's very similar character models and very similar art assets and stuff.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:29.000
But it's kind of cool, though, because they have that where you can cater to actually building multiplayer games and everything.

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:36.000
And it looks pretty smooth. So something I was thinking about checking out just to kind of see if my kids want to play there or something like that.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:40.000
But I've heard that this like asset dumping thing is a problem, though.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:47.000
Like didn't do we have a story on it last week or did I just I just read it somewhere about how like on the Nintendo Switch, people are like.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is not this is not like that.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:58.000
So, OK, this is more of like this is a platform kind of think of like like a Roblox or something like that where you build stuff.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:01.000
Oh, OK. OK. On that platform. Yeah.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:09.000
And it's also since it's using the epic game engine or whatever or not epic games, unreal engine,

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:14.000
I'm starting to think maybe it's somehow affiliated with epic somehow.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:20.000
I mean, the art assets look very similar. Like if you you saw a screenshot of this, you'd be like.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:26.000
Is that Fortnite? Because it looks like Fortnite. So if you're interested in checking out, it's core games dot com.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:33.000
And it's just you can create a free account and you play games that people made or make your own things or just play around with it and stuff like that.

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Not really sure how they make money with it, but it looks neat. I don't know.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:44.000
So, yeah, it's all basically like unreal engine. You can expand it with Lua or you don't want to program anything.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:50.000
You can just I think they have I'm guessing maybe it's like blueprints or something, but it looked kind of cool.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:57.000
You know, something mess around with. So that was something I was going to bring up because I know I will check it out.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:00.000
I love the idea of using that as like a family bonding time thing. That's cool.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Well, yeah, because they like they want to like they always play.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:14.000
Well, not Fortnite, but they've been playing a lot of roadblocks and doing stuff like that or playing Minecraft, skyblock and stuff like that.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:20.000
So. But if they can make their own games, it's sort of like, you know, Fortnite or something like that.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:26.000
I mean, the graphics look great. And I don't know exactly how it works and what you can build with it.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:31.000
But like, I mean, it looks pretty. So there's at least that. All right.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Well, I think we're going to go ahead and wrap things up here at Orange Launch Radio for the night.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Thank you guys so much, though, for tuning in to our show.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:41.000
If you like what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend about the show.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:48.000
And when the voices are but without the voices here to put out on the air, you know.

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:51.000
So we've got to get more people here to join our little family here.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Orange Launch Radio and the Voice of Geeks Network.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:57.000
We put the fun and dysfunction. That's right.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:01.000
So, again, thank you, everybody who did tune to turn out tonight.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
We really appreciate a five star review.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Just a simple recommendation, a link to, you know, our show on whatever podcast platform you use.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:14.000
iTunes, Spotify, Google Podcasts, whatever it is you're using.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
Help us spread the word.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:22.000
An auto host on iTunes. An auto host on Twitch goes an awful long way as well.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:25.000
So we really appreciate those for those of you that auto host the Voice of Geeks Network.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
Really, really appreciate that as well.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
Quick plug for something I'm doing on the side.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:32.000
We talked about this on Bobby's show a little bit, but I want to mention it here.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:36.000
On my personal Twitch channel at Rob Roberts, on Wednesday night,

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:40.000
myself and my buddy Arya Snark from Shaking and Crying,

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:43.000
we are going to have a watch party of the Birdcage.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
And you're all invited.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:48.000
If you do want to watch the movie with it, like we can't broadcast the movie,

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
but we're using Twitch watch parties to do it.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:54.000
So if you have an Amazon Prime account, you can watch the movie along with us.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:57.000
Otherwise, if you have like a DVD copy or you have the movie another way,

02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:00.000
we will say start the movie now.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
We'll do that whole type of thing.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:07.000
I have it on Apple TV myself, so maybe I'll do it with you.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:08.000
Perfect. Perfect.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:11.000
So yeah, if you want to watch along with technology, you can use Amazon Prime.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:15.000
If you want to do it by hitting play at the same time, that's fine too.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Like if you're like a second out of sync, it's not going to be a big deal.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Come on. It's the Birdcage.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:22.000
We're going to watch camp movies because that's what's fun.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
Can you believe I've never seen it?

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:25.000
Oh my gosh.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Right?

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Yeah. Well, you know what's funny?

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:31.000
We're starting to already plot out like if we have fun doing it and it goes as well.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:34.000
So we think it's going to do and we turn this into a weekly thing.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
We're plotting out what movies we want to do next.

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:40.000
And we're finding like there's stuff where like Victoria hasn't seen it.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:41.000
And I'm like, girl.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
And there's only anti meme is on your list.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
There's I don't think it is yet.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:46.000
But what was that?

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Is that on prime?

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:49.000
Because I don't know.

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:52.000
Yeah, we're restricted to the meme should be required to watch.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:53.000
I know. I know.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:58.000
But like if Paris is burning was there, we'd be doing that in a heartbeat.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
You know, there's just not everything is on Amazon Prime.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:05.000
But and I said this, too, if it does well enough and we're like, you know,

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:08.000
maybe we need to do this for not just movies that are on Amazon Prime.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:13.000
We will record podcast commentary tracks that you can use for.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
And then we can do things like any name.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Paris is burning and things like that.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
So we'll see, though. We'll see.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
All right.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:25.000
As you wonder, Matt says, here is the real question is sleepaway camp on it.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
No. And I checked.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
But there are some cheesy horror movies.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:32.000
And the rotation on Prime is always changing.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
So you never know. Anyway, you know what?

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:39.000
If you ever do a serious movie and I am so obsessed right now with Midsommar,

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
I would love to see you guys react to it.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:44.000
But it would be really, really hard to do, I think, for a live stream.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
I haven't seen that movie yet.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:49.000
And I'm a little afraid because I've heard things.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:53.000
Is the Nicolas Cage version of the Wicker Man on there?

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
Because that would be awesome.

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:59.000
I don't believe it is. Nifty 805 says showgirls, showgirls, showgirls.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:02.000
We would be there in a heartbeat again if it was on Amazon.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
You don't know shit.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:08.000
But my favorite movie of all time is on Amazon Prime.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:11.000
And so that will definitely be in the rotation in the next couple of weeks.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:14.000
We'll leave it at that. Anyhow, let's wrap up the show.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:15.000
I know what it is.

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:18.000
Enough about me. Let's talk to my other hosts and wrap things up.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:21.000
So that'll count as my final thought because I give a nice big plug there.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
So, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:30.000
I was actually planning on doing a live tweet of me watching Hereditary for the first time

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:31.000
because I haven't seen it.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
That is on Prime as well, I think.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:39.000
Is it? I mean, I've got Prime, but I already bought it on Apple TV+.

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:44.000
So I did it when I watched Midsommar.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:47.000
And of course, I've seen Midsommar now like a bunch of times since then

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:50.000
because it's like the best movie if I want to cry or something.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:57.000
But I would love to have people there to see me kind of freak out a little bit

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:01.000
over really weird, mentally disturbing stuff.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Fun!

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:03.000
Alright.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:06.000
Well, you know what I like. I play Silent Hill for fun.

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:09.000
I know. It was good to have you back tonight, Jamie.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:10.000
It was good to be back.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:11.000
Good. I'm glad to hear it.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:15.000
And last, but certainly not least, Loki, what's your final thought tonight?

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:22.000
My final thought is, has Jamie seen the trailer for Medium yet? Or The Medium?

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:23.000
No.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
You need to go watch the trailer for The Medium.

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:31.000
It's a new game that's coming out by the folks that did the Blair Witch project game on Xbox.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:38.000
And it's a very Silent Hill-esque type game and it has music by Kiryamaoka in it.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
You know what? I did hear of that.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Gosh, what's it on?

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:45.000
Xbox, but that means Windows 10 too.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
Okay. Well then, yeah, I can do it here.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Okay, cool. Yeah, thanks for letting me know.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Alright.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:55.000

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Stay safe.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:01.000
I know things are crazy right now, but enjoy a game.

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Be well.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:03.000
We're wishing you all the best.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
I know it's just like crazy times.

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:10.000
I'm glad we could at least have these few hours together every Sunday night throughout all of it.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:11.000
So, that's really all I've got.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
We'll see you next time in seven days.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:14.000
Good night, everybody.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:15.000
Until next time.
