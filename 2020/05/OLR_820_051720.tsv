69000	71000	Hi Loki, how are you doing?
71000	72000	I'm doing good.
72000	74000	Alright, hanging in there throughout all this?
74000	76000	Yeah, doing my best.
76000	86000	Yeah, did you take the kids anywhere exciting? A park or I guess there's just not a lot to, I'm like, what are you going to say? I took them to a trampoline park? I don't know. I'm just hoping there's some exciting story.
86000	89000	No, they're over at their grandparents house right now.
89000	94000	Oh, that's good. That's good. Quality, quality, quality time and all that is good. So, alright.

95000	102000	I also want to welcome back to the show this week. Say hello, everybody. Give a warm welcome to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
102000	103000	Hi.
103000	105000	Hello, welcome back.
105000	106000	Thank you.
106000	107000	We missed you.
107000	109000	Happy to be back. What did you throw?
109000	124000	Hot pot of coffee. No, I'm just kidding. So I told the listeners what was going on. I don't know if there's anything you want to say about it, but obviously the floor is yours if you wanted to say anything or say nothing at all. I can go to the next topic.
124000	140000	Well, I, I felt it would be good just to give some background and bear it a little bit, you know, because it's been, I haven't really been too super up and up on the whole scenario because my dad is in Alabama and I'm not here in California.
140000	148000	So I will, I'll go a little bit into not too much detail, but enough detail. How's that sound?
148000	150000	Sure, whatever you're comfortable with.
150000	161000	Well, um, about, had it been right before I got my current jobs maybe five or six years ago, my dad had a stroke in his 50s.
161000	172000	He had done a lot of drugs, it was the 70s and he likes drugs capital D drugs to quote, Dennis Leary. I'm sorry, Dr. Dennis Leary.
172000	180000	And so, as it stands, you know, lots of hard living can catch up to you chain smoking.
180000	189000	I mean my dad cheated death, a lot when he was a teenager and early adult I mean he crashed his motorcycle so many times, I'm sure he's hit his head more than a few times.
189000	193000	So, he had a stroke.
193000	201000	He nearly died. My, my youngest sister gave the resuscitation order for him, and he was never the same after that.
201000	217000	He was paralyzed on one side, he was doing better for a while and then he just, because he, some of his brain function had been decreased because of the stroke and a consequent, you know, you know you have another, you can have another stroke after you've had the stroke
217000	229000	so, so he wasn't getting, he had clogged arteries his heart was a mess. I mean, my dad was, I don't know he was being held together with duct tape and chicken wire, as we like to say back in the south.
229000	239000	Like some computers I've used. So, like the OLR studio computer Yes. Yeah, no that one's shiny and new. I'm proud of that little.
240000	247000	Well, remember there's two, there's there's the new one that powers the video and the old one still powers me and my stories so yes.
247000	261000	Yeah, oh girl we need to get you upgraded. It's the most well and it's all I mean folks have been kind enough to send upgrades but it's the most Voltron PC you'll ever see in your life of old shit and new shit, like duct tape together.
261000	271000	Anyway, I'm sorry, I don't mean to do right now. I'm sorry, you've now inspired me to, to write like a fan story of like duct tape Gundam. So, filing that away.
271000	272000	Done.
272000	275000	All right, so anyway.
275000	277000	So my dad.
277000	296000	He and I never did see eye to eye he was you know, Southern pretty, you know, to him it was normal for everybody else who has a conscience, it's racist, homophobic, you name it and by the way, hype mayhem vehicle Voltron is my favorite don't listen to.
296000	302000	So, and necessary 100 miles says the show PC is now called duct tape Gundam, I approve.
302000	308000	Yeah, I second motion passes. Anyway, back to topic.
308000	323000	The way that you know things when is it my dad eventually is his attitude got worse and worse he was moved from, you know, one place to the other, he had to have a total hip replacement last year, and then you know my granny died, five years ago.
323000	336000	She got well not five years ago, gosh, three and a half years ago because she died right after grandmama did you remember I was a mess up for that, I remember this all happening because obviously this show has been around and you know, again, I want to remind
336000	342000	people, it is a video game podcast but because you know the family that we've built up here on Sunday nights.
343000	356000	You know, we've all gone through a lot of deep stuff in our lives so sometimes this podcast is a way to kind of share that with you which is what Jamie's doing now, but I, I remember because of this show, when all that was happening because it was, I feel like you
356000	364000	had you had to deal with a lot like back to back to back relatively. Oh yeah, I was in some hardcore therapy after that.
364000	370000	And just for anyone who's wondering I have an appointment with my shrink scheduled for next week. Thank you.
370000	373000	Anyway, um, but you know after granny died.
373000	381000	Dad got significantly worse and my sister Shelley was taking care of dad's needs and in mobile.
381000	389000	And she was having to drive in from Foley which was, you know, like an hour or so drive into mobile to take care of dad but she did it every day and she's a high school teacher.
389000	396000	So kudos to my sister Shelley you are amazing and I know she's not listening because she doesn't do video games.
396000	400000	But as things go.
400000	405000	The show that I was last on being the week before last.
405000	417000	I'm sure as people notice during the show I vanished. I was like, I all because I got a call from my sister, saying that dad was in the hospital with respiratory issues.
417000	424000	And of course the first thing that everyone thinks is the code. Does he have the, you know, the ronas.
424000	441000	And so she couldn't even go in to see him after he was in the hospital, and dad had a very strict DNR do not resuscitate order, so that he couldn't be intubated they there was going to be no ventilation form or anything if he was going to die he was going
441000	443000	to die.
443000	461000	And as it turned out, he didn't have coded and one of the nurses, very graciously pulled some strings to get him in a private room, so that we so that my sister could have an hour visit with them, they basically she got two visits, one with him for an hour
461000	471000	visit and then the other one when it was about time, and my mother went with her mom my dad had been divorced for, you know, since I was nine months old.
471000	486000	So, yeah, divorced for a very long time, but, you know, my dad, I'd say that losing mom was dad's biggest regret and mom knew it and you know she and my daddy were best friends until they got married.
486000	489000	So anyway.
489000	504000	It turned out to be a bowel blockage and and kidney failure, and he did the surgery they didn't think he was going to live through it and my sister made the decision.
504000	508000	After consulting me she didn't just say oh nope, bye.
508000	521000	She and I decided that we were just gonna take daddy off of the, the heart medication that he was on the blood pressure medicine to keep his blood pressure up.
521000	527000	And so they expected him to die on Monday.
527000	540000	And then when Shelly went in my mom went in I videoed with my dad, and he woke up off of the morphine that they had him on long enough to try to open his eyes and wave at me.
540000	554000	And something was something very similar happened with my mom, for what it's worth. Yeah, yeah, it was very significant. And then, but him being the stubborn jerk that he was.
554000	557000	I can say this because he's my dad, and he was a stubborn jerk.
557000	559000	Hold on.
559000	563000	He did not die that morning, as he was expected to.
563000	568000	And he did not die the next day, as he was expected to.
568000	578000	He held on. And so my sister went in one more time with my mom and and dad, he didn't wake up for any of that he was already on his way down.
579000	587000	They weren't making fun of his feet to try to get them to wake up because dad was sensitive about his feet and sent me the worst picture of his tone I was like I don't need to see that.
587000	597000	But anyway, I digress because I'm now just remembering everything that went down with it. But anyway,
597000	614000	I said to Shelly, you know, hey, call me whatever time it is and keep in mind, I was in training now for my, my position at work for the rotation that I'm doing that you know could be a pretty big promotion for me so I was already nervous.
614000	630000	Yeah, she was already had a lot on her plate and getting still recovering from the pneumonia that I had. So I get a call around two in the morning for me for central time where dad was, and he, he died.
630000	640000	So, I was, I think I'm pretty grateful that I was so exhausted because I was still on my sleeping pills at the time.
640000	646000	And I passed right back out so I think that sleep was a good buffer for me.
646000	660000	But then I had to, you know, go to work, I could have taken my, my bereavement time, then, but I'd worked so hard for that and I could just think that my dad would be like, nah, nah, nah.
660000	669000	And the funny thing too is that when I got my senior position at my previous position that I was in Rob, not saying where I work.
669000	673000	That was when granny died and I didn't get to take any bereavement for that.
673000	678000	And you know, like I can't get a promotion because then family will die.
678000	690000	But with the, with the state of the world being what it is, you know, you can't eat, you really go back to Alabama, either to, you know, see people and, and, you know, have that grieving together so.
690000	694000	And while I could technically fly.
695000	709000	Mobile County has the highest infection rate in, in Alabama. And I think it's exceeded, like, one of the Mississippi counties, although Mississippi is pretty terrible, because you know the state motto of Alabama is right.
709000	713000	We ain't Mississippi.
713000	715000	Okay.
715000	728000	So at any rate, um, yeah I, and on top of that I'm still on like that level one to two quarantine where I'm not exactly safe to go out because they don't know if I had COVID-19.
728000	742000	And if I did, I could be susceptible to reinfection or carrier. And if I think it would be worse if your body was still recovering from another thing and then you get COVID it would be, that would be a very bad thing.
742000	751000	You know how sick I was with that pneumonia I was, I mean, well I'm sure all of our listeners remember me like, I've got to go.
751000	759000	But at any rate, um, yeah I wouldn't be safe to fly because if I haven't had it then I'm, I'm in susceptible list because I recently had pneumonia.
759000	771000	And now I have asthma that I haven't had you since I lost all that weight so go fig. But yeah, so we're going to do something later on, I mean, you know how I feel about everything.
771000	785000	History has taught us there's going to be a second worst wave. But I'm going to leave that where it is. I'm probably sure I'm not going to go be able to get out to Alabama to have any kind of memorial until next year.
785000	796000	And I'm pretty sure that I am not going to DerpyCon if they have it this year. I'm not doing any traveling. I'm gonna, I'm gonna stay put.
796000	799000	You gotta take care of you. Nobody's gonna fault you for that.
799000	812000	Oh yeah and Shelley and I talked about it and she's like, you know, I'm not really, I think ready to do anything to she's still teaching school through all of this, and my youngest sister is a hot mess.
812000	825000	We won't talk about her, not as bad as my brother who is unrelated to her. My brothers are not related to my sisters. So, let me, let me ask you about this, because this is something we were kind of having a text message exchange about and you know
825000	840000	bringing this story I mean obviously this this OLR and everybody here that listens week after week, whether it's live or whether it's on the podcast feed you know we're a family and so we're here for you if you need, especially when you've been robbed
840000	854000	of getting to do some other type of memorial because of this whole situation like you know, ain't nobody gonna fault you for venting, but, yeah, you and I had an interesting text message exchange, where you've kind of talked a little bit about
854000	865000	the grieving process and how your love of Animal Crossing, which is no secret around here, has helped you through that. Can you, can you elaborate on that a little bit like what we were talking about.
865000	881000	Absolutely, absolutely because I knew, I knew we were going to get there. So, this actually goes back a little bit before dad went into hospital is, I've been playing Animal Crossing the whole time I had pneumonia like religiously like I'm talking nine hours
881000	895000	I'm talking nine hours of play a day. And my, my really good friend who is in chat and I she's, she's been a little public about it I'm going to go to into detail but hi Gwen finara and chat.
895000	911000	I, well I made a little cemetery in my in my town. I put one, because the Zen stone honestly I like it better the, you know, it's a Japanese gravestone. And I put one up for for grandma and granny.
911000	927000	I put one up for Dan's mom who, you know, I said she she died at the beginning of the year so I'm sure you can already think about how things have been. And I put one up for Gwen's mom, because I have fond memories of her mother, and I loved her to bits
927000	942000	and she was really kind to us when we had to evacuate during a hurricane when we were all in college Gwen was my college roommate. And so I wanted to do something for her mom, because I know that the anniversary was coming up.
942000	953000	And then, when, when dad died, I was just like, I didn't even think about it, I took one of those, I went and got the mats for a gravestone.
953000	958000	And, yeah, she said she built a huge garden for her mother.
958000	976000	But I, I had a stone set up for daddy, I put, I put a black lily in front of it and I was like, that dad wouldn't have liked black lily so I've got incense in front of all of my, my stones I'm actually kind of using instance a little bit as, as my
976000	980000	as my in game yard site candle, although I think I'm gonna put.
980000	986000	I've been putting a candle out by by that grave I set for my dad.
986000	993000	Every Friday for for Shabbat, as my, my art site candle I mean, there's been one Friday.
993000	1009000	But, but I put one out when he died, and I have, but it's, it's still the fact I'm sorry I don't mean to catch up but it's still the fact that Animal Crossing is like that, like that you, you go through the motion in a game is just it's it's fascinating
1009000	1022000	and you're definitely not alone like I assure you girl you are not alone because we have our chat room over it of course, and I got to plug this some point twitch.tv slash vog network voice gigs network, where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific
1022000	1028000	nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby black will show and you guys chat along. And we've got a lot of, you know, obviously support in there for you.
1029000	1034000	Our dear Marissa, my therapist knows all about Animal Crossing.
1034000	1044000	Probably not just from you on Bobby black will says, Animal Crossing is great for a lot of this stuff pod culture saying Animal Crossing has been great for my depression.
1044000	1053000	I've got something related to their interest next to the stones in the Memorial Garden I set up and I was going to tell you, I, I set something up for my mom in my town.
1053000	1058000	And you know that was she passed in 2017 so this is a while gone.
1058000	1065000	Yeah, I've been struggling in Animal Crossing in the creativity department like I go to some people's towns like dang I mean like your town.
1065000	1079000	Everything is laid out you got your town square it's it's beautiful you got all these things, my town I'm kind of like, I'm just adding. I'm, I'm taking the the painting that was already given to me and just adding my own little flourishes.
1079000	1093000	I'm taking the village layout and just, oh, I want to do this here. Oh, it is here. And one place I did, I, it, the spark hit me when I saw that Nook shopping had the Mother's Day mug available for time.
1093000	1103000	I was like, I have to do something with that. And so I did and I set up behind my house. There's a little stone wall and there's a little I have the Zen stone because I don't have the other one but I kind of like the Zen stone at this point, and I have
1103000	1117000	When I get a DIY I'll save it for you. I have the little mug right next to it and then I have pink and black roses, and the black roses are kind of for me, the pink roses are kind of for my mom because I, we had rose bushes when I was younger so I always remember
1117000	1124000	attending the roses anyway, not to make it about me but just to kind of share with you like, me too.
1124000	1126000	We're all doing it. We're all doing it.
1126000	1138000	And I linked, actually I was talking to one of my newer friends, Annie who is one of the amazing co hosts of Stuff Mom Never Told You and Saver.
1138000	1143000	You know, and I've mentioned this podcast plenty of times on the show.
1143000	1153000	But, you know, just talking about a little bit and there's an article that's from the order of good death.com called exploring grief and Animal Crossing, it's really a good read I'm going to link it.
1153000	1165000	But you know, I think that because we are all distance like this and we can't be with our families, and we can't, I mean there's people that did die of COVID.
1165000	1171000	They're not, they're not allowed to have any family around them they can't see the body.
1171000	1188000	You know, and if they're having very small surfaces. And so, this is the way that you can do something quote tangible, right, something that you can look at and interact with in some way or another.
1188000	1203000	And, you know, I'll put it this way I do have my art site candle in real life for my dad, you know, and for those who don't know, you know, got a few a little bit of my Jew crew here in a chat, but the yard site candle is a candle that burns for 26 hours,
1203000	1208000	and you light it on the anniversary of someone's death their yard site.
1209000	1222000	But I've been lighting one, I've lit one quite a bit often for just to remember the victims of COVID-19 and our governmental stupidity.
1222000	1226000	And now I've got got them for my dad.
1226000	1242000	And, you know, I'll, you know, have a little swig of the manage habits and and say, say, cottage for my dad even though my dad would probably, I don't know I never told him that I converted to Judy.
1242000	1258000	So, he probably would be, I wouldn't say, you know, spending in his grave, he'd be breakdancing in his grave. Again, hashtag relatable because my mom was very adamant, I don't want a funeral, I don't want a headstone I don't want a memorial.
1258000	1274000	I want, you know, she she wants her ashes scattered in a very particular place. And it was cremated. Yeah. And so, so it's kind of one of those Oh my going against my mom's wishes but I'm like, my mom hated video games and she's not going to find out about this, and this is
1274000	1281000	sometimes you do something. This is more for me. And I think she'd understand that.
1281000	1287000	I think she would but yeah, but you but you would hear that Rob you're playing that game.
1287000	1290000	Absolutely hope I did your mom justice with that.
1290000	1296000	Let me, let me read some other hashtag relatable comments.
1297000	1300000	I got my therapist playing Animal Crossing.
1300000	1305000	Crystal skies and chat says my therapist also knows all about Animal Crossing.
1305000	1313000	My office has been coming together and Animal Crossing as well. Marissa says my therapist is going to get an Animal Crossing and a switch for kids now so they can socialize.
1313000	1323000	Well you know we've already talked on previous episodes about just what a huge like you know cultural milestone this game has been, and certainly not for the reasons that it wanted to be.
1323000	1330000	You know, it's just the right game that released at the right time, you know, and yeah, it's weird.
1330000	1343000	It's weird to think, would it be like this, if it had released in a normal world I don't know it's it's, we don't know we'll never know, still pretty sure Animal Crossing would have been big, but it was.
1343000	1351000	It was timely, not not on purpose I mean people like Oh conspiracy theory blah blah blah tinfoil hat would have.
1351000	1359000	But I think that interest that it was the therapy we needed when it came out. Oh, for sure.
1359000	1370000	A very interesting observation by Bobby Blackwolf and chat that's worth calling out here. Nintendo keeps putting out these cultural milestones. Remember everyone going out and being together for Pokemon Go.
1370000	1379000	If you want to get technical I mean Pokemon Go is a Niantic game that they just kind of lifted Nintendo's IP for but, but technically Game Freak right.
1379000	1391000	You're right you're right the Pokemon Company which is, you know, but anyway, but, and I'm going to give you this. It's because it was Pokemon that that game was so popular so yes I mean if it hadn't been Nintendo slash Game Freak Pokemon
1391000	1402000	Companies. If it hadn't been those particular characters I don't think it would have caught on the fire that it did, even though technically it's Niantic game so sure, we'll still give Nintendo credit for that, because you know that observation yeah
1402000	1414000	Nintendo, Nintendo really does seem to hit a lot of these cultural milestones of sorts, you know, and with Animal Crossing and how we all dealt with it during coven we're gonna remember that for a long time.
1414000	1426000	Well, and to add in other things with that too. When Pokemon Go came out, it actually has helped several friends of mine with social anxiety and full blown agoraphobia.
1426000	1437000	You know, because it was kind of like you had your centered little bubble but you were still out, and it got people out and involved and, and, and that.
1437000	1454000	And another thing too, as I was talking, actually looking through some information for reference, you know, we have a good number of other online games that are really playing into the social distancing.
1454000	1471000	People in, you know, because people still play Sims 4 in Animal Crossing and even like Second Life are using those games to celebrate Ramadan, which, for, for those who observe Ramadan with Iraq, I hope I said that right.
1471000	1476000	And I was gonna say Jack, Jack box is the huge one too.
1476000	1489000	Yeah, even though that's not like a simulation game like the everything goes to name like certainly jackbox in the Oh, here's the thing we can play online virtually and it's like when it's, it's very easy for everybody to like not everybody has to have a PlayStation
1489000	1499000	not everybody has to have a copy of the game because it's very easily streamable, and this whole Oh you just play through your mobile phone over the internet makes it like super easy like I would imagine.
1499000	1508000	Like I'm not I'm not going to pry into jackbox financials and again, I don't think any of these companies, you can talk about evil corporate greed all you want.
1508000	1519000	I don't think Nintendo or jackbox games ever wanted to be in this position. But, but they are. And so I bet jackbox is making noodles noodles off of this situation.
1520000	1531000	Nintendo to be rather an ethical company because I mean think about what I think it was you want to who did it that he took a pay cut when Nintendo was suffering so that his employees could be paid fairly.
1531000	1548000	I remember that during the Wii U, I remember that during the Wii U era Yeah, exactly. So, but you know, there's also, I think, and I'm really hoping that this isn't you know just becoming a breeding pit for the worst of.
1548000	1556000	I'm just going to throw it out there, toxic masculinity, that we've got more online matches in multiplayer games.
1556000	1561000	You know, I'm hoping that the more.
1561000	1580000	I'll say non cisgender men are able to go in and play their favorite online games and those environments as well without having to suffer. You know, the EP for lack of a better description, you know, and you know what I'm talking about it's it's not a good place for women.
1580000	1604000	It's interesting because I think since Nintendo often gets written off by the masses as the kitty product, the little kid product that toxic audience tends to stray from and again I fully recognize I am painting broad strokes here okay and nothing is easily sort of won't call me or call me, but that audience tends to stay out of the Nintendo games because it gets written off as a kitty product.
1604000	1616000	And so, in some ways I think that kind of helps lend it to why it is part of all these cultural phenomenons because it feels a little safer because that toxicness has these other has these other places to go.
1616000	1631000	And again, it's not to say Nintendo is free of toxicity and all this other stuff I'm not that ignorant, but smash again in in broad strokes, like, Nintendo tends to be that safer place for a broader audience.
1631000	1641000	Well, you know, I remember I was playing a crap ton of Mass Effect three multiplayer, but I would only play with people I knew.
1641000	1643000	And I would not play.
1643000	1649000	If I, if we like joined in on any matches, I would not play with my speaker on. Yeah.
1649000	1661000	I just, it's like the moment when a non cisgender male joins in, in a game like that the moment they find out that there could be a vagina involved.
1661000	1677000	You know the the hammer comes down and we shouldn't have to put up with it it's absolutely disgusting and especially in this day and age with everything going on and just the general, I'd say social trauma that we as an overall society are experiencing.
1677000	1688000	We need to have this outlet and people need to be less shitty about it. Yeah, that's all I'm gonna say there, you have to wonder if something in the world situation isn't going to challenge, some of that.
1688000	1693000	But anyway, that's, that's a much deeper topic we've gotten a lot of topic I'm sorry.
1693000	1696000	But, but going back, let's do the car.
1696000	1710000	People are using their games as a means of communication as a means of getting out their stress, and in my case, your case, Gwen here, we're we're working through our grief in Animal Crossing.
1710000	1730000	You know we're working through our grief in a very, I would say healthy way there and there is and this is the last, I'm really going to go too much into the grief thing there is a TED Talk that it gave me a lot of help when, when Grandmom and Granny died I know I linked it to you Rob to watch.
1730000	1748000	And I'm gonna, I'm going to put it in chat, but I'm going to try to find out who it was that did it because I always forget her name, but it podcast folks won't see the chat so right that's why I'm gonna say, you know, look for it, but it's a TED Talk about closure.
1748000	1750000	And it talks about.
1750000	1754000	It's by Nancy Burns brns.
1754000	1766000	But it's a really good conversation about keeping your grief grief with you as a part of you so that you don't separate it from the memories. And I think that's what we're doing with Animal Crossing, you know what I mean.
1766000	1784000	We are, we are putting our grief out there in a way that others can share it with us we're keeping it fresh in our hearts, but it's also helping us to reconcile that sadness with the joy it could bring us you know what I mean.
1784000	1789000	Absolutely. So, and we tie it into the things that we love to keep that close to us.
1789000	1796000	So, I've had some time to think on this. No, you're fine you're fine you know and just as you know Animal Crossing has helped us through a lot of that.
1796000	1809000	This show has helped us through a lot of these difficult moments in our lives so it's, it's, it's good to have you back to our soccer I'm glad you were feeling up to coming back tonight so a hearty welcome back to you.
1809000	1829000	18 years almost. Yeah, been a lot. Unbelievable, unbelievable. And I was hoping, I was hoping by the time our 18th birthday rolled around, because we're sitting, we're sitting on new art and new intro and like a whole like makeover for the show, we're just sitting on it, because the idea was, oh, that would be a great way to come out of this
1829000	1841000	COVID situation the social distance recording is like, we're back again and here's all new coat of paint and all this stuff but now it's like as the time goes on it's like well, maybe we'll just have to roll that out on the 18th anniversary because we just we don't know
1841000	1852000	when this is going to be passed I mean I don't know it seems like things are getting I get I guess I shouldn't go too far into the topic we don't know.
1852000	1856000	So we have to play it week by week.
1856000	1870000	And, you know, I think that. And now I'm going to get all like ridiculously sappy and everything. Okay, that you guys have been just a delight, a joy in my life.
1870000	1883000	And I think without the show I probably would have been a lot more lost yeah I mean yeah I had to take the week off of it because I mean and I'm even still doing it, I just don't trust my voice when I was in training I hardly said anything publicly,
1883000	1890000	you know, you know, in our, in our training chat which I'm all doing this online, you know, that.
1890000	1909000	But coming back to the show is, I think, one of my big steps in in facing it and dealing with it and trying to trying to, I'm not gonna say muscle through, but trying just to bring that into a part of the person that it makes me well and get some
1909000	1914000	sort of normalcy back in a completely abnormal world.
1914000	1921000	Well, I don't believe normal is always in flux. The only constant is change, right, fair.
1921000	1926000	This is our normal. But when you've been doing something 18 years it's kind of normal.
1926000	1929000	You know what I know it. No, I know what you mean.
1929000	1934000	Yeah, so I mean I'm gonna say look at us. Look at our other fellow podcasts.
1934000	1937000	Look at her.
1937000	1942000	But look at how we've all adapted.
1942000	1954000	We've got discord now for doing our show other folks are using Skype. I've seen some on zoom or their, you know, videos streaming you know with the crazy backgrounds and everything.
1954000	1959000	I think it's absolutely amazing that we have the, you know, could we have done this 10 years ago.
1959000	1965000	Would we have paid out the nose for life through life 365 to do it.
1965000	1979000	Could we have done it 10 years ago, maybe through Skype, but is that the way well and and here's the thing and I, as, as convenient as like discord is for doing this show and it's great because it allows us to still get together we can get that creative
1979000	1993000	energy out we can still do this show and it kind of gives us what we need. I am going to be honest, I still don't like it as much as I liked us all being here, but I realize that just can't be the case right now.
1993000	1996000	It will be the case again someday.
1996000	1999000	We'll get we'll get there, week by week.
1999000	2003000	Oh great now I've got that song stuck in my head.
2003000	2008000	Some day, somewhere, nevermind.
2009000	2016000	It's Bob rush he's like butter. Yeah, Bobby says the majority of podcasts actually were done over Skype for the past 15 years very, very few were done in the same room.
2016000	2028000	I think you meant like over 10 because when you invoke life 365 see in that era when we were doing dialect radio. I'm not sure Skype would have done as well but yeah most podcasts are done over Skype, but I think what kind of has made or zoom whatever
2028000	2041000	you want to insert there. I think part of what's made this show special is the fact that we're all in the same room. And I can also say, I don't like doing the distance recording, but we're going to do the distance recording, so we can still have this show
2041000	2043000	because something's better than nothing.
2043000	2058000	Absolutely, absolutely. And, and you know, with all of this, you know, I, and any fellow podcaster listening to this show live or recorded.
2058000	2069000	Kudos to you keep doing it keep your voice out there we need, especially our into you know our independent podcasters and the people who are out there saying important things that people need to hear.
2069000	2080000	Don't, don't let a virus stop you keep using you know doing it this way do it however you need to. It could be really difficult, it could be super easy for you but the fact that you're doing it is what's important.
2080000	2082000	Absolutely.
2082000	2084000	Keep on keeping on.
2084000	2093000	Yeah, put that art out there because in this really crappy situation and podcasting is a type of art. I know a lot of people like to, you know, speak negatively of it.
2093000	2098000	I'm not going to stand by and let that happen. It is a type of art, it's a type of expression.
2098000	2113000	And as crappy as these times are the best thing that's going to come out of it is the art is the Animal Crossing creativity, the the things that help us to grieve and all of that that's going to be so don't, you know, keep podcasting and keep keep making art, whatever
2113000	2126000	it is, if you paint, if you, you know, keep it, keep one of my favorite movies ever is pump up the volume. Mm hmm. And just the fact that I mean it was you know the 90s with shortwave radio, right.
2126000	2142000	But I always think that that might have been one of my biggest inspirations that led me to love doing the live radio, and then going into. That was why when I had the chance to you know do under sedation with y'all and fill in for for Jessica and be like the constant guest.
2143000	2156000	I jumped on it. And then when we did our show, I knew I had found the thing that I mean, if I could get paid for doing all our hell yeah, but I know no don't talk crazy now.
2156000	2167000	We got paid yet so I don't think we will so whatevs. But at any rate, that's that's my whole my whole thing. Everyone out there keep using your voice. Please keep using your voice.
2167000	2177000	Also PS. I played with Gail Simone and Animal Crossing so I feel like I've had my, my ultimate nerd moment, the end. Congrats. All right, Loki is still with us.
2177000	2189000	Sorry. It's been a right it's been it's been like you totally ran to the other rumors I know it's like, it's, it's been a good 30 minutes of venting and chatting but it's it was needed.
2189000	2201000	It was child wrangling. This is group therapy. All right, we are going to get into some gaming news though because video games are the way that some of us you know cope it's a, it's an art form as well.
2201000	2210000	And some of us cope through Animal Crossing. Others of us like to play games where we shoot demons in the face right Loki.
2210000	2220000	Sure. So, Doom eternal courses, you know, one of the big games that came out and march around this wall exactly at the same time as Animal Crossing.
2220000	2230000	And it was met with pretty good reception you know that pretty positive reviews and everything and there weren't really any issues with it.
2230000	2243000	That is until they decided to update it and insert de nouveau anti cheat, because everybody loves de nouveau I mean the copy protection scheme that doesn't really work that well.
2243000	2254000	And on top of that, they had actually with this now being put in there and I guess to stop cheating but there really isn't a whole lot of like online multiplayer.
2254000	2271000	It's really just the battle mode that they have where it's basically to one player versus to two players playing as like some sort of demons, which I don't know if there's been a lot of cheating in that per se but it is something that they put in there
2271000	2280000	and now folks aren't really happy about de nouveau anti cheat being in there because it gives kernel access to this program.
2280000	2299000	And it's basically leaving it open to be exploited in some way to gain access to your system now, of course, it's come out saying that Listen, this is only running when the game is running and it's, you know, not going to stay persistent in your computer.
2299000	2328000	But, you know, so folks don't really like that. However, apparently de nouveau is working with the team with, you know, the behind Doom eternal to see if there's a way to get like some sort of separate launcher for the single player offline play, so that it would allow you to play the offline portion single player, which a lot of people are doing is just playing single player, and being able to do that without the de nouveau anti cheat and only enabling it if you're playing some sort of online portion of that.
2328000	2342000	Which I think it's a decent compromise, it still kind of sucks. And then of course, along with that, as folks tend to do, I got review bombs pretty bad on steam. So now it's mixed instead of very positive.
2344000	2349000	Oh, good old review bombing, you know, a way to way to take a stand internet.
2349000	2362000	Show them. Yeah, well, they're making their voices heard. I mean, it sounds like that they hear them. So I don't know some interesting commentary because this topic came up in our discord server this week.
2362000	2372000	So of course, we have a discord server like a lot of your favorite podcasters and broadcasters. And you can find it over at vog network.com. That's vog network.com slash discord will get you the invite you need to get in there.
2372000	2389000	And there was some really interesting comments, I want to relay some of those comments on the situation. metal mayhem on discord said, here's my take. On one hand, I can understand wanting anti cheating measures. Over the past 17 years of playing games online, I've seen all too many cheaters and that annoyed the fuck out of me.
2389000	2405000	TF. At the same time, I can't stand intrusive programs being installed on my PC. That's one major reason why I like buying games on GOG versus steam when I have the option to do so. And let's be real here, anti cheating software and DRM doesn't stop folks from doing what they're going to do.
2405000	2427000	All it'll do it all it'll do is slowly delay it. And in the process, annoy everyone else. Here's a comment from 13 x forever 30 forever who said, Why exactly is this bad? Besides the general FUD about the F, I think F us maybe about the potential of exploit by a third party.
2427000	2444000	You have 10s of drivers running with the same privileges, for far more dubious reasons or needs. iTunes installs 10 year old driver to be able to rip audio CDs and no one bats an eye. Some game company installs the drivers is being constantly developed under a high pressure to fix any issues ASAP, and the internet's losing their mind.
2444000	2469000	There are valid reasons to reject the notion of such updates, but people are focusing on all the wrong aspects of this. One more here from Tiger Claw. I just want to say, though, I like that comment because it does shine a spotlight on why is it always the games that get all the press about this when there are so many other products on your computer and he he named an audio software, but there's all other types.
2469000	2486000	But I think that in those situations where people find exploits like that, they are brought up. It's just it's not necessarily something that, you know, you might be paying attention to. I don't think that people are silent on that when there is an exploit like that. They're just as up in arms about it.
2486000	2509000	It's just this tends to be like, do you know, do you know, but doesn't tend to work correctly and it sends to get defeated pretty quick and causes all sorts of issues, I think, with the game. I don't know necessarily specifics, but I know that, like, even with this launching, I want to say that I thought they were supposed to be putting Denuvo anti piracy in there and they accidentally shipped it with basically a
2509000	2534000	DRM free executable for some stupid reason, because probably because Bethesda. But I know like other companies that have used, you know, I believe have been the it's been defeated pretty fast. So I don't know. I think the overall consensus is that the negatives outweigh the positives of it.
2535000	2550000	But I mean, you'll see, I don't think there's really a strong online to it. Maybe this is just kind of a precursor before they launch like a legitimate multiplayer deathmatch type thing or something that I can see.
2550000	2563000	Maybe they're just getting the kinks out with this one online mode first, because then I can see that the need for this. But for just like the simple one versus two mode, I mean, I guess there would be.
2563000	2569000	I mean, I assume there's gonna be cheaters everywhere, but I can't imagine that it's gonna be that rampant.
2570000	2579000	Let me read one more comment from Tiger Claw here from Discord. I don't really like the stuff that's being installed in the background. One of the issues might be that it would slow down your PC if it's constantly running in the background.
2579000	2590000	There would be cases where having such things could affect system performance when you're gaming on a PC. For example, it could potentially eat too much of your system resources and use up a lot of memory. This is basically a form of DRM.
2590000	2606000	So yeah, lots of negative feelings about this software. I think for me, I understand why companies kind of have to do the anti-cheat thing. To an extent, I understand it because people are gonna cheat.
2607000	2615000	And you see it run rampant in almost any online game, especially ones that don't have these sorts of protocols in place.
2616000	2626000	But on the other side, I also completely understand that Doom Eternal also has a one-player mode, and some people just want to play the one-player mode, and have no interest in playing online with other people.
2626000	2640000	So why are they being subjected to this as well? In that aspect, I understand why this is very annoying, because it's for a part of the game that I don't really have an interest in.
2641000	2644000	But, I don't know.
2645000	2661000	I mean, we'll have to see. According to you, I think it may be just kind of a knee-jerk reaction to anti-cheats in the past. Basically, a lot of them used to hook into the file systems, start up with your OS and that kind of stuff.
2661000	2668000	Whereas, maybe this isn't as intrusive, but I don't know. I don't have Doom.
2668000	2680000	And I'm gonna just totally throw something kind of lame-brain out there and fully admit it, but my gut says, you know, this is America. We love to sue people in America.
2680000	2696000	Could it be that these things getting installed on a computer when people don't want them to, let's say it gets exploited or whatever, let's say there is an exploit and somebody gets into your computer because of this anti-cheat system, could there be a legal ramification with that?
2696000	2705000	Or, I mean, I know, hold on, because I know what people are going to say is up, but you accepted that end-user license agreement, and when you accepted the license agreement, you agreed all that stuff.
2705000	2712000	And I kind of figure, like, sure, I understand that. Is that really going to stop a lawyer from a class action lawsuit? I don't know.
2712000	2720000	I've also seen those types of license agreements challenged when it's like, nah, nah, you don't get to get out of it by doing that. You know what I mean?
2720000	2724000	Like, when Sony and the PlayStation issues they had and all that stuff. Anyway, go ahead, Loki.
2724000	2725000	But the company...
2725000	2727000	Oh, sorry, Jamie. Sorry.
2727000	2744000	Yeah, one thing that the company does have the right to protect the experience that they sold to people, you know, they advertise the game a certain way, that certain things would happen, that certain protections would be there, and this could indeed be their way of enforcing it, right?
2744000	2758000	Yeah, it's like, it's why I'm not, like, completely against the anti-cheat thing, but I do feel to some extent the company needs to own it if that software is what is used to exploit your computer.
2758000	2766000	But then again, we have the Discord comment that makes an excellent point. You have a ton of shit on your PC that could probably be used to exploit your computer. So...
2767000	2776000	How are you going to pinpoint it to, you know, what exactly it is? I don't know. Yeah, I'm sure people will calm down after a while.
2776000	2787000	All right. All right, well, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week, whether we were using mods or anti-cheat systems or what.
2787000	2796000	Darsaka. Real quick, I was going to say, that's the thing that would actually concern me is sometimes I like to cheat my own single player experiences.
2796000	2802000	So is this going to prevent me from doing that? That kind of takes away some of the fun.
2802000	2812000	Excellent question. And Bethesda in some ways has embraced the mods, like in the old Doom, right? Like, that's the big reason why they have these new...
2813000	2823000	Yeah, I'm like, it is interesting. Like, you know, I think there's definitely assets and positives to modding and so forth. So you ask an excellent question.
2823000	2834000	Like, if this disables the ability to mod your PC version of Doom Eternal, then that's kind of a bummer. You know, if you want to do that, as long as your modding isn't distracting from the experiences of others.
2834000	2842000	I think that it's sort of like the bad apple scenario where they're saying, well, one could be used negatively, we're going to ban them all.
2842000	2852000	Where like with what BioWare did with Mass Effect is like, if it's not affecting the multiplayer experience, do your high res mods, make Shepard wear whatever you want her to wear, you know?
2852000	2859000	All right. Anyway, good point, Logie. Let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week, Doom or otherwise.
2859000	2861000	Darsaka, how was your gaming week?
2861000	2862000	Animal Crossing.
2862000	2865000	I guess we kind of got into that earlier in the show. Anything?
2865000	2877000	Yeah, I really haven't played anything else. Oh yeah, I was going to say, and I've told you all about this game a bunch of times because I have Apple Arcade and I have been super into playing Patterned.
2877000	2883000	And they released a bunch of puzzles and some of them are what I call hell puzzles.
2883000	2892000	But basically, in a nutshell, what Patterned is, and it's set to like, if you want the music, it's like really gentle background piano music.
2892000	2907000	Just really gentle in background and kind of relaxing and calming like you're by a stream, you know, but you get different, your entire picture is a tiled picture with different, you know, patterns and designs on it.
2907000	2921000	And you have different blocks of a different size that you have to bring in to match over a piece of the artwork. And it starts off as line art and fills in more gradually as you fill in more of the pieces until you have the complete puzzle.
2921000	2930000	And they let you download it as wallpaper. If you're playing on on one of your mobile devices or playing on a computer.
2930000	2935000	I've even used one of these wallpapers for, you know, one of my own little projects.
2935000	2948000	But at any rate, I have been playing a good bit of that it's been just really good for for kind of having like a distraction for my brain because I need to be doing a couple of things at once.
2948000	2963000	And if I if I stopped in this was last week of course if I stopped to think about anything that I was going to go crazy so it's been really good for just, you know, keeping, keeping me steady it's nice and chill you can play it on your phone you play on your tablet
2963000	2969000	you can play it on your computer I'm playing it of course on Mac because it's Apple arcade.
2969000	2980000	But it's a game that I super love, um, I really haven't opened anything else I haven't touched Pokemon I haven't touched the Harry Potter game.
2980000	2990000	It's just really, I've just been so stuck in Animal Crossing land because it's been, it's been like my, my, my blanket my blankie.
2990000	3003000	Although I am finally considering if my other if my gaming computer will keep up with it, I'm finally going to take the plunge on Detroit become human, because I love that game.
3003000	3005000	It's beautiful.
3005000	3007000	So, yeah, that's my gaming week.
3007000	3008000	Excellent.
3008000	3010000	Loki, how was your gaming week.
3010000	3015000	So I played a little bit of Minecraft with my kids.
3015000	3027000	I played more step mania stuff, I was loading on some new songs and I finally found the eight 20 songs so put those in there and played some of that today.
3027000	3038000	So that's fun. And of course lots of Orna. And I think that was it. Yeah, I think that's all I played this week.
3038000	3051000	Okay. Um, so for my gaming week I'm still going on the regulars like Animal Crossing and Final Fantasy 14 and the mobile stuff like you know Ingress Pokemon Go and let's say the Orna and all that stuff.
3051000	3066000	Let's see, uh, new stuff though. I probably the biggest thing that I checked out that was new on the Nintendo switch they released the mobile game Elder Scrolls blades, but now they're reporting it to consoles originally it was supposed to be out on like
3066000	3073000	every console and mobile. It's taken a while for them to do that and I don't even know if that's still the plan anymore, but the switch version came out.
3073000	3086000	So I was like, what the hell it's free. What do I have to lose, so I jumped in and played it a little bit. There's a lot of people out there I noticed on Twitter and stuff that don't like this game, and it's buggy because it's a Bethesda game, it hasn't been like super
3086000	3093000	buggy for me like I might get a frame skip issue here and there, but Bobby was talking about on his show tonight and it's on his Twitter over at Bobby black wolf.
3093000	3104000	He had this like, like he can't even use his right joystick. It's so damn choppy like I didn't have any of those issues but it's interesting how buggy the game can be from one system to another.
3104000	3113000	His theory is that it has to do with running the game off an SD card. I don't think mine is doing that but I don't know that it's not either but anyway I'm, whatever.
3113000	3123000	Um, I don't hate it like I read all that they hate that people have for this game out there and I'm like this is a little strong. I don't love it either. I'm not going to die on the hill for this game.
3123000	3138000	It's a really like dumbed down version of Elder Scrolls, and I mean dumb down like it's really simplified but sometimes it's kind of like what you need, like Elder Scrolls, there's a lot when you can touch every book and every piece of fruit and pick every flower
3138000	3147000	and all that stuff so like in some ways like not having all of that overload my senses with like, I need to collect everything is actually kind of nice.
3147000	3161000	Um, so it's kind of like a dungeon crawler sort of thing you're basically like going through these like pre rendered dungeons and killing a couple mobs and you know that the battle systems very simple it's kind of like slash with the left hand slash
3161000	3174000	with the right hand slash with the left hand cast a spell it's kind of it's very, again, it's very simplified. And then the whole point is that you're like restoring this city, so it's basically a city builder game with some dungeon crawling built into it.
3174000	3182000	Again, I don't hate it, it was a, it was a fair use of a couple hours, maybe not probably not even that long maybe an hour and a half that I was playing it.
3182000	3192000	I just wish the damn thing had a map. I can't believe here we are in the year 2020, and I'm playing a video game without a stinking map, like, what what is up with that.
3192000	3204000	And don't throw the whole well video games didn't used to have maps. They've been doing maps and video games since like the original Legend of Zelda probably before that, quite honestly, Elder Scrolls has maps in their game.
3204000	3216000	Yes, exactly. So like the what the fact that it's missing from this one is really irritating. But otherwise, it's, it's okay. Like, I don't hate it. I think I don't understand why people like really hate it.
3216000	3233000	I do hear though that they've changed a lot since it originally released for mobile that they've done some changes and now here we are releasing on switch. This is the first time I've experienced it so some people might be basing their perceptions off the original version of the game and that that could explain why maybe sometimes
3233000	3247000	some people hate it and I'm like, I mean, I get that it's buggy and it's really simple and it is a free to play game but I don't think it's like the worst thing I've ever played in my life I've played far worse games that I paid money for.
3247000	3266000	So there's that. But yeah, Elder Scrolls Blades. It's, it's okay. Put that on the back of the box. All right. We're gonna get into some gaming news here. I do want to mention some quick stuff during housekeeping because Bobby was mentioning this on his show tonight and I think this is an important thing to bring up.
3266000	3289000	So every year. Well, I shouldn't say every year but for the past couple years. The voice geeks network has sponsored a show out in Atlanta, that is similar to like our California extreme out here you know where they do all like the, the old, old school machines pinball machines and arcade machines they kind of rent a hotel ballroom and the whole things on free play for a weekend.
3289000	3314000	There's a thing like that out in Atlanta, the Atlanta area is not actually not in the city of Atlanta, but it's called the southern fried game gaming Expo, I must say game room but I think now it's gaming Expo because they try to incorporate some other stuff into that as well but southern F FGE, they have canceled for the year 2020, which I'm sure won't surprise anyone with everything that's going on in the world a lot of big conventions are canceling.
3314000	3328000	But here's the thing. We've talked about this a little bit with why is dragon con still happening. Why is packs still happening Why are these companies saying that these things are going to happen, and long story short, it has to do with contracts.
3328000	3357000	They could be in a breach of contract essentially, if they just cancel because unfortunately pandemics for whatever ridiculous reason is not one of the like acceptable reasons to cancel a contract. However, if the city or the state government steps steps in and says, Oh no, you're not having this gatherings of 500 plus people are banned here, then you can enact a clause in the contract known as force majority.
3357000	3374000	And you basically get to cancel but you get to recoup the money invested because now it's not your fault the canceled basically. So most conventions This is why dragon con hasn't canceled yet. This is why packs hasn't canceled yet, because that type of stuff is not going to happen until two three months out before this all happens.
3374000	3399000	So for everybody that's on dragon cons page posting, I can't believe you'd put the public at risk. Wait, wait, if you want to blame something, blame the legal process. Okay. But here's the thing. Southern fried game room Expo, they they have canceled because they're in a part of Georgia where there is no legal clause to have such big gatherings.
3400000	3414000	So they are caving in to that pressure and doing the right thing per se, by not having a mass gathering of people at their own discretion. And unfortunately, that means they are going to be financially liable.
3415000	3433000	So if you're able to if you're in the south east area, if you are the type of person that would usually go to these types of things, please consider supporting for getting your 2021 ticket, or they're going to have some shirts online and some of the merch that they probably would have sold this year will be available online instead.
3433000	3447000	If that is the type of thing up your alley, I would encourage you to get on there and support that because, you know, they did do the right thing for public safety, even though technically, there was no government mandate for them to shut down on that.
3448000	3465000	So I just want to give them a shout out of sorts. The interesting silver lining to that, that whole thing, for me is that, you know, with all this time off, I'm saving, and all this flight credit, I'm going to have if Dragon Kong ends up getting canceled, I'm going to have more flight credit.
3465000	3474000	It's one of those weird things where it's like, well, I might be able to go to this in 2021. Usually I'm like, oh, no, I can't do two trips to Atlanta over the summer. That's too much. I don't have that kind of time.
3474000	3484000	Well, with everything that's happened this year, I guess the silver lining is I'm going to have everything banked for next year. So no promises yet because we don't know what the world's really going to look like in 2021.
3484000	3496000	We don't even know if it's going to be okay then, we hope, but, you know, but the interesting silver lining is that maybe I can go in 2021, but I hope you all will support them and do the right thing and all that.
3496000	3505000	So, okay, let's move on and get into some gaming news and the headlines of the week. Loki, you want to start us off?
3505000	3521000	Yes. So one of the news bits that was part of the summer of gaming or whatever the hell we're calling it now, they had an announcement with Tony Hawk talking about the remaster of Tony Hawk one and two.
3521000	3532000	So that's pretty sweet to see them basically going to be remastering those two games. They're trying to get the same tracks from the original soundtrack.
3532000	3539000	Not sure if they're going to be able to get all of them, but they're going to have the original skaters and looks pretty awesome.
3539000	3547000	So that would be coming out September 1st, I believe, or September 4th. And yeah, so what to look forward to that.
3547000	3557000	And then, of course, along with that, because obviously it's been a long time since these games have come out and, you know, Tony Hawk isn't as young as he used to be.
3557000	3564000	So what's kind of fun is they're actually going to have the pros that are in the game are actually going to be aged as well.
3564000	3569000	So he's going to tell you, Hawk will look like he does now and as will the other pros in there.
3569000	3579000	So I think that's pretty cool. Dad's going skateboarding. Yeah. I wonder if they'll get like other does Tony Hawk have kids?
3579000	3587000	I imagine he does. Yeah, you got it. You got to wonder if those kids sometimes are like, Dad, you're embarrassing me.
3587000	3591000	Do you think everybody thinks that about their dad?
3591000	3597000	I guess that's true. And then at the same time, it's like, child, that skateboarding is paying for your college.
3597000	3603000	These three masters are going to pay for that. So I guess you can't be too critical. Did you hear his record got broken?
3603000	3608000	Oh, no, I didn't. Yeah. Like an 11 year old kid finally pulled off a 1080.
3608000	3612000	OK, well, but does but does that cheapen the Tony Hawk brand?
3612000	3618000	No, but I'm just saying that like the thing he like was kicking his ass to try to do a kid beat him finally.
3618000	3627000	But it kind of brings things back to that legacy that he's kind of done to true, you know, and it's like, you know, I realize skateboarding is not in the Olympics,
3627000	3638000	but I think people in Generation X and especially subsequent generations, we kind of start to look at skateboarding and those types of things that were like the X Games when we were like in our early 20s.
3638000	3650000	Right. Like those are kind of like Olympic sports to us. So and the reason why I say that is because, like, you know, if an Olympian has a record beaten, you still kind of remember like the heyday of that Olympian.
3650000	3657000	Right. You know, like, yeah, like Mary Lou Retton in the 80s or something like that, you know, like that was that was crazy how she was everywhere.
3657000	3662000	And I don't even know how I wanted her legs or what. Who's I wanted legs like that.
3662000	3667000	Who's more modern? Who's the swimmer guy? Michael. Michael Phelps. Michael Phelps. Yeah.
3667000	3682000	Or there's. I can't remember her name now. Who is the runner? Jackie Joyner-Kersee is on the tip of my tongue. No, no, no. Oh, but I can't remember showing my age.
3682000	3692000	Oh, and then there was also like for, you know, the the figure skating world, Bonaly, who, you know, just to piss off the judges, did a backflip.
3692000	3699000	Oh, yeah. Isn't there some documentary about her? It's fascinating. I think so. I remember watching all that figure skating stuff growing up because, you know, hello.
3699000	3707000	And I remember I was totally into it. I think her name was like Sophia or so something. Sonia. Sonia. Yeah. Sorry. Sonia. Sonia. Yeah.
3707000	3719000	Sonia Bonaly. So. So anyway, sorry to interrupt. No, you're fine. Only here at O.L.R. can we relate Tony Hawk Pro skateboarding to figure skate discussion.
3719000	3727000	So there was. So what's kind of cool, though, is this is being done by various visions. So they're the ones behind the Crash Bandicoot remakes.
3727000	3735000	So one of their goals was basically to have the game still feel like the original game.
3735000	3741000	So all of the not necessarily bugs, but like kind of quirks of the original game and everything.
3741000	3749000	What's kind of cool, though, too, is apparently if you did like, of course, they're trying to push pre-orders and stuff. If you wanted to do that, you get to actually play.
3749000	3756000	They have like a kind of a demo release thing that they're going to put out. That's the I can't remember the stage is called.
3756000	3763000	It's the warehouse, I believe, that you can actually check out and stuff. I don't know. It's pretty fun.
3763000	3768000	Yeah, like I'm kind of into it, too. Like, you know, I don't think I really got into the Tony Hawk games.
3768000	3778000	Like I remember games like Skate or Die and 720 in California games and those like I'm going really old school there, but I didn't really get into the Tony Hawk games.
3778000	3788000	But I think I think they'd be kind of fun to revisit. I kind of be down. Yeah. Dad, you're embarrassing me.
3788000	3795000	I'm just picturing dads across the nation picking up these Tony Hawk remasters and playing them all over again. All right. Cool. All right.
3795000	3802000	Well, moving on, let's talk about some big gaming news from this week. That is the unveiling of the unreal five engine.
3802000	3810000	That's right. A PlayStation five tech demo was shown off for the unreal five engine, which was announced in one of those streams that they're doing for the summer game fest.
3810000	3818000	So this was like they did an interview with Jeff Keighley, because you remember how I was being a little bit like isn't summer game fest like just news announcements?
3818000	3824000	But this was actually something produced by them because Jeff Keighley was involved to sit down interview and they really hyped it up.
3824000	3828000	And, you know, they hyped up this interview. It was a mystery thing. And then they did it.
3828000	3836000	And of course, some Twitter people were like, that's it. And I'm thinking in the back of my mind, I'm like, do you know how many of your games are powered by unreal engine?
3836000	3843000	Like this might not seem like a big deal, but it's a very big deal because this is what the future of gaming is going to look like.
3843000	3848000	And they showed a little video and I'm sorry, I don't have it here for our Twitch viewers, but I'm sure plenty of you have seen it.
3848000	3859000	It's a it's a don't call it Tomb Raider, but it sure looks awfully similar of this, you know, gal who's running through tombs, I guess, and, you know, running cliffs and jumping.
3859000	3866000	And it's very smooth. It's 30 frames a second, but 1440p, it looks very good and, you know, kind of has me hyped.
3866000	3871000	I'm like, OK, all right, this looks really cool. You know, this is how they're pushing, you know, graphics and so forth.
3871000	3881000	So, yeah, they did that whole unveil that game, that demo that they showed, though, even though they say it is playable, it is it is not at this time a game.
3881000	3886000	Sometimes tech demos turn into games like we play.
3886000	3890000	Was that what it was on the weed that was just basically like all their tech demos?
3890000	3895000	Yes. E3 demos or the three, two, one, one, two, three switch.
3895000	3899000	That's like all their tech demos thrown into a game to switch and whatever that one to do this game.
3899000	3903000	One, two. Why aren't you ever on sale? Yeah.
3904000	3908000	I still want $40 for this game. One, two, bundle it in already. All right.
3908000	3913000	Anyway, but so that's not to say it couldn't ever be a game, at least that's not the plan at this point anyway.
3913000	3917000	And that's you know, that there's a lot of stuff that never becomes a game.
3917000	3925000	The Final Fantasy six, when they did it in 3D back in the day, like that whole demo in Nintendo 64, like that never became an actual thing.
3925000	3927000	So not everything becomes a thing anyway.
3927000	3931000	So they showed this off, this demo, and it's got some oohs and aahs.
3931000	3935000	And yeah, the Unreal Engine 5, it's coming out next year.
3935000	3940000	So that's interesting because that means the games that are going to launch on PlayStation 5,
3940000	3946000	Xbox Series X are not going to be in this, which it's not like that's the only engine out there.
3946000	3949000	Many companies have their own in-house engines that they build.
3949000	3955000	So that's fine. But it's interesting this is going to be there at first.
3955000	3957000	That is going to be something that they're working on.
3957000	3961000	It should be pointed out that there is Unreal Engine 4.25.
3961000	3964000	So the current Unreal Engine does support next generation hardware.
3964000	3966000	So that's not to say there won't be anything in Unreal.
3966000	3971000	It just won't be in Unreal 5 until after this is out, as you can imagine.
3971000	3975000	The other big news about Unreal, and I think this is a big deal,
3975000	3981000	the royalties are now waived on your first million dollars in game revenue.
3981000	3985000	That's right, you can build games for free in Unreal Engine,
3985000	3989000	and royalties are waived on your first million dollars.
3989000	3992000	And these are retroactive terms to January 1, 2020.
3992000	3997000	I mean, how many indie developers out there never see that kind of money,
3997000	4000000	you know, and are already having a cut to get out?
4000000	4005000	This is a great, great thing for small developers, indie developers.
4006000	4011000	That's amazing news that, you know, that's going to be royalty free for the first million.
4011000	4017000	I am expecting great things of the Unreal 5 version of Super Multitasking, I just have to say.
4017000	4019000	Now, one of the things...
4019000	4021000	Those pixels better be razor sharp.
4021000	4024000	Now, one other thing to talk about with Unreal Engine 5,
4024000	4027000	because sometimes when we've talked about brand new cutting edge engines,
4027000	4030000	the question is, what about Switch, though?
4031000	4035000	Real quick, there's one more piece to that as well.
4035000	4040000	So the other thing that they did was they opened up the framework that they use for Fortnite
4040000	4046000	for their multiplayer servers and matchmaking and all that stuff.
4046000	4049000	And now that's available for free as well.
4049000	4054000	It's platform agnostic, so you can use it in Unreal, Unity, whatever you want to use it in.
4055000	4060000	Now, when it comes to the Switch, the question is, is it going to be there, is it going to run on it?
4060000	4065000	And the short answer is, yes, obviously it's not going to have the same power,
4065000	4070000	but the engine that you build the game in, it can still work on Switch as well.
4070000	4073000	And Unreal Engine 4 fully works on Switch right now,
4073000	4076000	and Unreal 5, they will continue to have that Switch report.
4076000	4079000	It may not have every feature, it may not run the same,
4079000	4083000	but it's going to be available for Switch development, so that, I believe, is a good thing.
4083000	4087000	Now, sorry, I've been ignoring chat while I've been getting to all this,
4087000	4089000	but I want to get to some of the comments in chat.
4089000	4092000	Let's see, VGRealness says,
4092000	4095000	maybe the Summer Games thing is what's going to take the place of E3,
4095000	4099000	as there doesn't seem to be much hype around the IGN E3 replacement.
4099000	4103000	Wait until a little closer to that second week in June,
4103000	4105000	or whenever they ultimately schedule that for.
4105000	4111000	You know, Twitter and social media is very much a live in the now kind of place.
4111000	4115000	And so, I think the fact that there's, what is there to get hyped about?
4115000	4118000	Turn on my computer and look at the latest thing on IGN, right?
4118000	4122000	Like, E3 you get hype about because you get up, you go,
4122000	4125000	you might make plans to watch press conferences with friends,
4125000	4127000	or even Sony did that movie theater thing, right?
4127000	4129000	But obviously that's all different right now.
4129000	4131000	And you drink heavily after all the social anxiety gets you.
4131000	4135000	Yes, yes. So, that's not really happening this year.
4135000	4139000	So, I don't know if it's to say that the buzz won't be there.
4139000	4143000	I think it's just, once the news is out there, it will spread like wildfire,
4143000	4144000	no matter where it comes from.
4144000	4148000	Anyway, actdeftinchat says,
4148000	4151000	though like I said earlier, it's cool that the tech is going to be amazing,
4151000	4153000	but what does this all mean to us, the general consumer?
4153000	4155000	Especially this being shown for the PlayStation 5.
4155000	4157000	All hype, no substance.
4157000	4162000	Well, wait until that IGN thing or when E3 would have been.
4162000	4165000	Keep in mind, what we saw out of this was,
4165000	4168000	I think they even said was going to be the game developers conference.
4168000	4171000	And obviously that got put on hold and didn't happen.
4171000	4173000	Wait for those, you know, Sony.
4173000	4177000	At least it was more entertaining than Mark Cerny's talk.
4177000	4181000	Well, for you, but if you're a developer,
4181000	4184000	you might have found Mark Cerny's talk very fascinating.
4184000	4189000	No, that new material or like, you know, material aside,
4189000	4191000	and the material was both very interesting.
4191000	4193000	It's just the presentation of it.
4193000	4196000	One is certainly more interesting than the other one.
4196000	4200000	Don't even remotely slander the man who made Marble Madness, okay?
4200000	4202000	Don't. All right, anyway.
4202000	4205000	Unreal 5, Marble Madness?
4205000	4209000	But here. But, you know, let's see where we are in June or I guess July,
4209000	4212000	because Microsoft has basically said,
4212000	4215000	we're going to show Halo in July and the other games too, right?
4215000	4218000	So, you know, wait until there,
4218000	4221000	and I think you're going to find that hype level you're looking for
4221000	4224000	when we start to get to the stuff that is really targeted at the game.
4224000	4227000	to get to the stuff that is really targeted at the consumer.
4227000	4230000	So I wouldn't feel lack of hype right now,
4230000	4233000	because we are still May, this is early,
4233000	4237000	we don't usually get to find out the good stuff, not until June,
4237000	4240000	and then you're going to have to assume with everything that's going on with the pandemic,
4240000	4244000	it may be like July, August, it's going to be like summer long,
4244000	4246000	so when the companies are ready to unveil that stuff.
4246000	4251000	So, you know, I think the hype will still be there,
4251000	4253000	you're just going to have to give it a little longer, that's all.
4253000	4259000	So, alright, let's move on and get into some other news.
4259000	4261000	Darsakra.
4261000	4266000	Well, and this actually kind of goes back to where we were starting
4266000	4270000	right at the beginning of the show with all the people using their online games
4270000	4276000	for, you know, more often and for staying in contact with people,
4276000	4283000	but the video game industry in the US has set a sales record for the first quarter.
4283000	4287000	They're attributing it mostly to people staying at home,
4287000	4291000	for people having nothing to do but stay home and play video games.
4291000	4295000	So they have set a record of 10.86 billion,
4295000	4302000	which is 9% higher compared to the same spending in the same quarter of 2019,
4302000	4305000	so it's up 9% from last year.
4305000	4315000	And of that total, 9.58 billion was spent on video game content with an 11% increase.
4315000	4319000	They did mention big sellers, of course, being Animal Crossing New Horizon,
4319000	4324000	Call of Duty Modern Warfare, Doom Eternal, Dragon Ball Z, Kakaroto,
4324000	4329000	Fortnite, Grand Theft Auto 5, Minecraft, MLB The Show 20,
4329000	4333000	and NBA 2K20 as the best performing games.
4333000	4338000	And of course, the Switch sold its absolute best.
4338000	4345000	It led the market with a 2% increase, so the sales went to $773 million,
4345000	4350000	and with their accessories, that went up 1% to $503 million.
4350000	4355000	So taking all those numbers away from it, because I can say numbers all day,
4355000	4357000	but what does that mean to us?
4357000	4361000	It means that we are seeing more people gaming.
4361000	4368000	We're seeing people who are using gaming as their therapy,
4368000	4371000	as we mentioned earlier, right?
4371000	4379000	And the people who are, in general, just looking to their games
4379000	4385000	as their big replacement, I think, for all of the other external things they used to do.
4385000	4390000	So in that respect, this surprises no one really, or it should surprise nobody.
4390000	4393000	Nana, what do you think?
4393000	4396000	Yeah, with the current state of the world, you're right.
4396000	4397000	It doesn't really surprise me.
4397000	4401000	The Switch going cuckoo bananas with everything Animal Crossing doing the same.
4401000	4403000	I like that, cuckoo bananas.
4403000	4406000	Doesn't really surprise me either.
4406000	4411000	I'm sure Jackbox Games probably is doing very well, and as I mentioned earlier,
4411000	4415000	as well, again, not that this is how you want to profit, but it is what it is.
4415000	4419000	And so, yeah, with more people being at home,
4419000	4424000	and I know some folks are still working and all that, but you have a lot of unemployed.
4424000	4429000	Unemployment is really high, really high right now with all the service industry and everything.
4429000	4431000	It's very high.
4431000	4438000	So there's a lot of people that are playing video games to give them peace of mind.
4438000	4440000	They didn't have video games in the Great Depression.
4440000	4443000	Of course, they also didn't have remotely the social programs we have now.
4443000	4448000	Thank you, FDR, except, you know, again, not going to comment and ruined.
4448000	4454000	But I'm saying, you know, this is the perfect distraction,
4454000	4458000	the perfect thing for people who are looking for an outlet.
4458000	4462000	So, of course, they're going to be going into, you know, buying more systems.
4462000	4466000	I mean, well, how long were Switches unavailable?
4466000	4469000	They're just now coming back in office.
4469000	4471000	Why am I saying office? It's like I'm going to work.
4471000	4476000	They're just now coming back into stores for availability.
4476000	4482000	Yeah, Alan got one a week ago, but it was, you know, he had to get the text message alert when they were in stock.
4482000	4483000	Did he have to kill for it?
4483000	4488000	Yeah, it was that whole thing. He had to really, like, work for it, basically.
4488000	4497000	Yeah, and I'm quite happy to have him as my AC buddy and to give him all my unneeded DIYs.
4497000	4499000	Yeah, his town's really coming along, actually.
4499000	4502000	I need to just do a live stream of Animal Crossing already, but, you know.
4502000	4504000	I did one when I first started playing.
4504000	4509000	I should probably do another, but my audio goes kind of funky going through my MacBook.
4509000	4513000	So, actually, and I didn't talk about this during my gaming week, but it is important.
4513000	4520000	I've been using my office for work and still my gaming and everything, and that's why I'm like,
4520000	4524000	I don't know if I want to sit in there for even longer and do streaming, but I probably will at some point.
4524000	4528000	But I did some minor upgrades in my computer this week.
4528000	4534000	I finally got that power supply, and I want to thank everybody for those very lovely offers that you all made,
4534000	4539000	but it finally came through. I got the power supply, and Alan put it in the computer today, actually,
4539000	4543000	and the new graphics card, which isn't a huge step up in the graphics department,
4543000	4547000	but also more fans to try to prevent some of the other issues I was having.
4547000	4551000	So, yeah, so the good news is that computer's all up and running now,
4551000	4554000	so I didn't want to, like, set up the capture card and everything,
4554000	4557000	just because I knew the thing was going to get torn apart and put back together.
4557000	4561000	But maybe that's something I can look at doing now, because there's just a little more oomph in there now.
4561000	4565000	So, I actually was looking at my streaming setup earlier this week because I was watching somebody,
4565000	4568000	and I was like, I need to figure out how to do certain things in there.
4568000	4576000	It's such an OBS noob, but, like, I finally figured out that you can actually organize your scenes,
4576000	4581000	where you have multiple different sets of scenes, because before I just had it all dumped in the one.
4581000	4586000	And I remember telling you, I was like, well, this is annoying, because, like, I have my DDR setup here,
4586000	4588000	and it's mixed in with my Skyrim setup.
4588000	4591000	Oh, you mean, like, having the profiles, switching between the different profiles.
4591000	4597000	Yeah, you can switch between, like, different profiles in there, and I was like, I just figured that out this week.
4597000	4602000	God, you know, like, it just takes me so long to figure this stuff out.
4602000	4606000	But, you know, you're not going to know until you dive in there.
4606000	4608000	Jump in there and try it, that's for sure.
4608000	4612000	All right, anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about some other gaming news. Loki.
4612000	4615000	All right, so this is pretty exciting.
4615000	4622000	So, this week, Konami released a new DDR game that you can actually play in your browser.
4622000	4629000	So, Dance Dance Revolution V, which, it's technically in alpha right now, but it is available to play.
4629000	4634000	There's 15 songs available on there from Dance Dance Revolution A and A20.
4634000	4641000	And right now, you can play with your keyboard, although I assume if you have, you know, a mat or something like that,
4641000	4647000	that you want to hook up, that you can map it out to the keys and everything and be just fine.
4648000	4653000	It's kind of basic right now. I mean, they don't have any modifications.
4653000	4657000	You can do the songs, no speed mods or anything. They do have, you know, the four difficulties per song.
4657000	4662000	It's only single player. And yeah, but it is pretty cool.
4662000	4666000	You do need an EMUs account to set up, you know, that.
4666000	4672000	So, if you have that, you can log in. I can check it out. And it's running in Unity.
4672000	4675000	God, I don't even know if I were to remember my login, but if I have the car.
4675000	4678000	Oh my God, in Unity?
4678000	4679000	It's in Unity.
4679000	4680000	Wow.
4680000	4685000	If I had my card somewhere, maybe I could figure it out. Did you actually play it, Logie?
4685000	4686000	I did play it.
4686000	4687000	What'd you think?
4687000	4692000	A little bit. It's all right. I mean, it looks just like, you know, DDR.
4692000	4694000	They've got, you know, everything in the backgrounds and everything.
4694000	4699000	And, you know, I try to take it apart, you know, because that's me.
4699000	4701000	So, I took a-
4701000	4703000	I may have or may have not done that.
4703000	4709000	So, I took a pass on it. I haven't played it yet. And I'm just kind of like, I heard the news and I was like, oh, okay.
4709000	4716000	And I kind of took some shit on Discord for my opinion because, you know, I basically said, well, here we are again.
4716000	4718000	And, you know, again, we've been doing this show a very long time.
4718000	4722000	And I feel like in the early years of the show, especially, there was a very common theme.
4722000	4726000	And that was that Konami never wanted to take risks in America.
4726000	4732000	Like, DDR was released here kicking and screaming and subparly. Remember?
4732000	4736000	DDR USA mix, not as strong as what they have had over there.
4736000	4742000	And then when the DDR stuff. So, it was like, you know, and finally, maybe around the time Supernova finally came out.
4742000	4749000	Like, finally, somebody at Konami figured out, oh, yeah, like, I guess there is, you know, a whole market for DDR there in the US.
4749000	4751000	And they've done this with a lot of other products too.
4751000	4756000	So, my point is, is I'm like, here we are again. It's another product. It's just for Japan.
4756000	4764000	So, it's just one of those, I have a very, and I didn't say this on Discord, and I think this would explain my position a lot more eloquently.
4764000	4771000	I have a very similar approach to this that I do, Phantasy Star Universe, I'm sorry, Phantasy Star Online 2 or PSO2.
4771000	4774000	Yes, I'm aware it's been out in Japan for eight years.
4774000	4779000	Yes, I'm aware I could have downloaded a translation patch and played it.
4779000	4782000	I'm not going to because Sega didn't want me to.
4783000	4786000	And that's how I feel about this. End of story.
4786000	4792000	Yeah, and this is, it's okay. I mean, the timing windows are extremely forgiving.
4792000	4800000	I mean, it's just like, it was super easy for me to AAA a song and like, I clearly wasn't hitting it at the right time.
4800000	4810000	So, I don't know. And there's some things that they do that are pretty dumb, like the scoring and everything sent by plain text.
4810000	4814000	And I mean, that could be totally exploited if you wanted to.
4814000	4820000	But in fairness, it's all like an early alpha, like it's a first release, like it's a preview, I guess.
4820000	4824000	So all of these things could be addressed. Like maybe they do have plans for international rollout.
4824000	4828000	Maybe they do have plans for this, but I'll just, I can wait. I can wait.
4828000	4836000	Yeah, I mean, I don't know why they couldn't just put Ace or A20 or whatever on PC because it runs on PC in the arcade anyways.
4836000	4843000	So like it runs on Windows XP. I mean, come on. I think I think you can handle it can handle this.
4843000	4849000	I don't know why we need to port it over the unity aside from, you know, doing the streaming assets and stuff like that.
4849000	4854000	It makes it a little bit easier that way. Maybe they can build a monetization for new song packs and stuff like that.
4854000	4862000	But I don't know. Like, I wish it was. I like to see where this goes.
4862000	4872000	Like, because it would be cool, like if we could get like an official PC version of Dance Mania running or not Dance Mania, Dance Dance Revolution.
4872000	4878000	I'll load that up on my cabinet as an option to play, like if I could do that. But like, I don't know.
4878000	4886000	Let me get to some comments from Discord, because we did have there was a discussion about it earlier in the week, and then there was a little more today.
4886000	4891000	And I don't even know this is going on, but I see a comment from Dark Tetsuya responding to a YYR comment, which we'll read in a minute.
4891000	4897000	Dark Tetsuya says, I heard a certain someone got death threats, hate mail in his inbox, since he works at Konami in their Japanese offices.
4897000	4901000	Like, what the fuck, seriously? Okay, yeah, that is fucking gross and extreme.
4901000	4912000	And like, even if I'm sitting here going, meh, like, I would never condone, you guys know, I would never condone that level of, and I don't even, what the fuck is prompting people to go that far with it?
4913000	4914000	Entitlement.
4914000	4915000	Who cares?
4915000	4916000	I guess.
4916000	4924000	It's the same thing, that's why those idiots are protesting it, you know, wherever their capitals are. It's entitlement, it's people wanting what they want when they want, little Veruca salts.
4924000	4929000	Is it that or is it, oh, we're mad because it's only 15 songs and it doesn't have DDR, third mix, fourth mix?
4929000	4931000	It's an alpha, who cares?
4931000	4933000	That's, that, that is a bit extreme.
4934000	4939000	YYR's comment says, as far as DDRV goes, I think it goes to show that gamers will complain about anything.
4939000	4946000	Yes, it feels very early and rough around the edges, but I can't believe they released something for free that works with dance pads and contains current songs.
4946000	4950000	Hell, it's got Golden League stuff in it that's a royal bitch to unlock in the actual game.
4950000	4955000	If anything, it's a token of goodwill above all, and yet we're giving them shit about it. Not a good look.
4955000	4964000	So I don't know if that's a comment for me, because it says we're giving them shit about it, or it's a comment for the extreme, like, crazy people, like Dark Tetsuya was referring to.
4964000	4966000	So I don't know.
4966000	4967000	I hope so.
4967000	4975000	But, you know, it could be me, it's fine because I was talking negatively about it in Discord, but I'm going to stand by what I said with the whole PSU too.
4975000	4990000	And again, the thing that just kind of irks me about it is that I see this very familiar pattern from the past that I hated in the past, and I'm not exactly, and yes, I'm well aware.
4990000	4998000	I could just, you know, go on and get through a little Japanese and do it and play. You know what? I don't want to.
4999000	5005000	You know what? It's fine. I think we have the right to criticize it because, dude, we've supported them from the beginning.
5005000	5006000	Exactly.
5006000	5011000	Through all of their games, and even DDRPC and all that, like, garbage.
5011000	5015000	Tell you what, you bought that one, was it Beaten Groovy or whatever?
5015000	5017000	Yes. I mean, I bought Beaten Groovy.
5017000	5018000	It's just a reminder.
5018000	5023000	I have the right to be critical, I think, of Konami products.
5023000	5024000	I mean, like, you know.
5024000	5027000	There's a difference between being critical and then just being a complainer.
5027000	5028000	Exactly.
5028000	5029000	You know what I mean?
5029000	5034000	Yeah. So, and again, and if that comment is that the crazy people that Dartis is referring to, then I'm with you.
5034000	5039000	Like, just in general, that kind of cyberbullying that goes on around games and stuff is dumb.
5039000	5048000	And even from my own perspective, when Konami finally decides to invite me to the table, just like in the past, when they did have a subpar USA mix,
5048000	5054000	the three of us were there every fucking Wednesday night putting dollars in that machine playing it, even if it was USA mix.
5054000	5055000	And when they were-
5055000	5056000	But it did kind of pay off for us.
5056000	5061000	Yeah. And when they released the PlayStation USA version, we all fucking bought it.
5061000	5063000	I bought that fucking Disney.
5063000	5064000	I bought that Konami.
5064000	5068000	I'll be here to consume it when, you know, they put it out.
5068000	5071000	So we imported all that stuff too.
5071000	5073000	So, I mean, like, we bought it twice.
5073000	5074000	But I like-
5074000	5077000	And we also didn't buy it.
5077000	5078000	But I like the theory.
5079000	5087000	I like the theory that because it's early, maybe international versions are in the plan for a later rollout.
5087000	5089000	Cool. I'll see you then.
5089000	5094000	So, all right, let's move on with some more stories, which I think the next one is mine, actually.
5094000	5098000	So let's talk about the PlayStation Studios brand.
5098000	5106000	So, yeah, there's not like a new company launched within PlayStation, but I guess you could say like a new branding, if you will.
5106000	5110000	A first party game is under the PlayStation Studios brand.
5110000	5115000	So the internal studios, meaning Naughty Dog, Insomniac Games, Santa Monica Studios.
5115000	5116000	So what are we looking at there?
5116000	5119000	Like, Last of Us, God of War.
5119000	5123000	Those big PlayStation exclusives that, you know, people are waiting for, right?
5123000	5126000	They're now all under a PlayStation Studios brand.
5126000	5134000	This was announced alongside an opening cinematic that is going to be with new PlayStation Studios games on the console.
5134000	5139000	I'm guessing that's like a throwback to the PS boot up that we used to have, right?
5139000	5145000	Well, I mean, and also a lot of games and studios of worth have their own little, you know, boot up screen, right?
5145000	5150000	Like I reminded me like of a movie logo, like, you know, like 20th Century Fox.
5150000	5151000	Everybody knows that one, right?
5151000	5154000	That whole thing, right?
5154000	5160000	And or I think even with video games like the PlayStation era of Konami, if we want to talk about that.
5160000	5164000	There was that whole weird CGI thing where the Konami logo comes out of the rocks.
5164000	5165000	Now, you remember that?
5165000	5167000	I can see it in my head.
5167000	5169000	I'm trying to think of like modern game.
5169000	5170000	I know what you mean.
5170000	5172000	And I play the doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
5172000	5179000	Yes. I'm trying to think of modern game studio like splash screens that are kind of iconic.
5179000	5184000	Anyway, I was looking in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.
5184000	5186000	If you guys think of any, let me know.
5186000	5191000	But anyway, yeah, so they're going to file it all under this brand for PlayStation Studios.
5191000	5197000	And, you know, head of global marketing, Eric Lempel, said over the last few years, even last decade,
5197000	5200000	the strength of the titles coming out from our studios has been stronger than ever.
5200000	5204000	We've been thinking about how we unite all of these great games under one brand.
5204000	5208000	And really the purpose of that is to make the consumer understand that when they see this brand,
5208000	5213000	they're getting ready for a robust, innovative, deep experience that they've come to expect from games coming from PlayStation.
5213000	5215000	So we came up with PlayStation Studios.
5215000	5220000	And it is noted, Microsoft did something very similar about a year ago.
5220000	5225000	When they started acquiring like Ninja Theory and Obsidian Entertainment, it's Xbox Game Studios.
5225000	5230000	And I do think the branding there is to reinforce the exclusiveness.
5230000	5235000	I think is what it really comes down to is that, oh, if I want to play a PlayStation Studios game,
5235000	5238000	I better get a PlayStation and an Xbox Studios game.
5238000	5241000	I better get an Xbox or a PC that's strong enough to run it.
5241000	5247000	So, well, and then we could get into the whole, hey, PlayStation stuff is starting to show up on PC.
5247000	5253000	But that's a whole another chain of events that we'll get into at another time when it's more appropriate.
5253000	5254000	We can talk about that.
5254000	5257000	Yeah, but I think it's an interesting branding.
5257000	5261000	I don't think it really like changes anything, but I think it is just to drive home.
5261000	5266000	These are the PlayStation exclusives because we have the PlayStation 5 coming out and we want people to understand that.
5266000	5268000	And I think that's really what it boils down to.
5268000	5272000	So, all right, I'm looking at some of the comments in chat.
5272000	5276000	S.G.O. and Hunter Matt says, the classic HBO title credits are still the best.
5276000	5283000	Bobby Blackwell says, I only really remember the turn 10 and playground game splash screens because of all the fours of playing I do.
5283000	5286000	Well, they have the neat little like looks like you're turning on a car type of thing.
5286000	5288000	It's pretty cool. So, all right.
5288000	5296000	For the record, there is on YouTube for the people who like the old HBO thing, there's a making of.
5297000	5302000	Of that whole opening set and how they built a real set for it.
5302000	5305000	It was so long and that was the best.
5305000	5306000	So good.
5306000	5308000	It was like 30 seconds long.
5308000	5311000	And it was always like, oh, my God, we got the HBO preview.
5311000	5313000	Mama, you'll never hear from me again.
5314000	5315000	Sneak it up at 2 a.m. to watch.
5315000	5319000	Oh, no, that was Showtime to watch Rock and Rule, which is to this day one of my favorite movies.
5319000	5320000	Well, you know what?
5320000	5324000	If we're going to throw it back, Dark Sakura, then let's throw it back with our next story.
5324000	5327000	Are we going way back?
5327000	5329000	Are we not?
5329000	5330000	I think we're going to go.
5330000	5332000	Yes, let's go back.
5332000	5339000	We're going to get in our way back machine that you can also see next to a DeLorean on the rock and ball table.
5339000	5340000	Just saying.
5340000	5345000	Microsoft Solitaire is 30 freakin years old.
5345000	5350000	How much of that game did we all play when we were bored?
5351000	5355000	A lot, because it was like that default thing everybody had, you know?
5355000	5362000	Well, it was, you know, the the built in kind of bloatware, but at least had had some use, you know?
5363000	5367000	But at any rate, it it's it's been out.
5367000	5374000	I mean, it's hard to think of having a computer that doesn't have, you know, some kind of solitaire.
5374000	5381000	And, you know, and now it's got like a collection, a solitaire collection where you have, you know, the old fashioned Klondike.
5381000	5385000	You have your scenes and they're bringing it in with Xbox integration now.
5385000	5389000	I mean, just seeing how I remember the cards with the fishies on the back.
5389000	5390000	Yeah.
5390000	5395000	And remember, remember your reward for beating it was the bouncing card.
5395000	5399000	Oh, and to see is funny if you.
5399000	5401000	Gosh, what was it that I did?
5401000	5415000	Yeah, we had an old it was a friend of mine who had a computer running three windows three one one emulated on her computer and just watching the cards go all over the place.
5415000	5418000	You know, is it what it is?
5418000	5426000	We can do that noise again, Jamie, because it was one of the Stooges, the the windows three point one one Stooges.
5427000	5432000	V.G. realness says now it has ads and you have to pay for it to get rid of it.
5432000	5435000	Trash. No, I'm actually I've played the newer Microsoft solitaire.
5435000	5443000	It's it's fine. It's it's it it has evolved the way many games have many free games have across the last 30 years.
5443000	5445000	They have achievements in it, too.
5445000	5452000	That's just you know, it's funny is that for me, it was always like, you know what?
5452000	5461000	I I don't like minesweeper, which is funny because one of the first things I did with my Mac is download minesweeper.
5461000	5464000	But I mean, it's it's just like that.
5464000	5470000	It's like it's like imagining.
5470000	5476000	Not having vanilla ice cream, you know, it's just a staple, it's something that you just always expect to be there.
5476000	5482000	I love I loved Microsoft Solitaire, but what I really loved was that pinball game on Windows 95.
5482000	5486000	Was it? Oh, yeah. Space cadet or something like that.
5486000	5491000	I remember the name of it was like that. Wasn't there like a skiing game for a hot minute?
5491000	5497000	Or am I thinking back to thinking ski free and that that's that wasn't part of the normal suite of games.
5497000	5501000	That was the other thing that they had with chips challenge and stuff.
5501000	5505000	I remember that was called. But they also had hover.
5505000	5508000	Where's my hover remake? Mm hmm.
5508000	5513000	I I just was like.
5513000	5516000	With with with that.
5516000	5522000	It's like when I said when I when I got even when I got on to my when I remember when I put together my Linux machine,
5522000	5527000	one of the first things I did was find the version of solitary that ran in Debian.
5527000	5532000	So now it's it's a staple. I mean, this game is now older than some of our listeners.
5532000	5539000	Oh, God. Well, and it's a thing where it's like, you know, my mom is not a gamer,
5539000	5547000	but she'd play Microsoft Solitaire. So, you know, I think it was entry level gaming for a lot of people.
5547000	5551000	This is this is the mobile gaming of 30 years ago, in a way. Yeah.
5551000	5555000	Indeed, it is. So. All right. But lovely throwback.
5555000	5559000	Yeah. A little bit. Not our classic game of the week, though, just to be clear.
5559000	5562000	Maybe in a later week for now.
5562000	5566000	But that's that's a stretch. I did. Hey, I did Halo for y'all.
5566000	5571000	And you also did Minesweeper at one point. So it would make sense that you would do the other Windows games.
5571000	5576000	Maybe, maybe. Anyway, maybe we'll get to the game of the week this week or maybe it's a table.
5576000	5580000	We'll get to that. But we have a couple more stories for you first. Loki.
5580000	5588000	So out of nowhere, Nintendo announces a brand new game that's coming out in a couple months and it's a Paper Mario game.
5588000	5593000	So they have announced Paper Mario, the origami king, which is going to be coming out on the switch.
5593000	5597000	July 17th. Looks pretty cool.
5597000	5603000	And they had it looks like all these new folding abilities and different enemies that are all origami stuff.
5603000	5609000	Hope there's some instructions on how to actually make some of these, because that would be pretty awesome.
5609000	5615000	And then wait, can I tinfoil had something on this? Because, yeah, here's the thing you say came out of nowhere.
5615000	5621000	I actually don't think it came out of nowhere because just last week there was a lot of like pressure in the media about,
5621000	5625000	wow, Nintendo's going crazy with Animal Crossing and they're selling all these things.
5625000	5629000	Let's look at what's coming up next for Nintendo. Tumbleweed rolls by.
5629000	5633000	There is the Xbox Chronicles Definitive Edition, and many people are hype about that.
5633000	5637000	But I mean, beyond that, Tumbleweed, there's nothing really on the horizon for Nintendo,
5637000	5640000	because as we know, they probably would have announced this during the 3.
5640000	5641000	It means the Xenoblade Chronicles.
5641000	5643000	So what?
5643000	5645000	You said Xbox Chronicles.
5645000	5647000	Did I really? Jesus Christ, I'm getting old.
5647000	5649000	Xenoblade Chronicles.
5649000	5653000	So so that, of course, is all coming at the end of this month.
5653000	5658000	Actually, it's in a couple of weeks. But beyond that, we don't have a lot of games announced.
5658000	5662000	We don't know what's coming. So I kind of think they were under pressure to unveil something.
5662000	5668000	And I think it's because, too, this probably was going to be in their E3 Nintendo Direct.
5668000	5677000	I think this coming out now is proof that the E3 Direct is not going to happen when you think it is.
5677000	5682000	It's going to happen end of June or early July. So they had to get this one out now.
5682000	5684000	That's my tinfoil hat theory.
5684000	5686000	I guess that makes sense, yeah.
5686000	5692000	It looks cool. I haven't played a Paper Mario game since Super Paper Mario, so I don't know.
5692000	5694000	I'll have to check it out.
5694000	5696000	Yeah, it looks cute.
5697000	5705000	Yeah. And there was someone saying online, like it says that someone had datamined, I guess, the eShop,
5705000	5711000	where they said that there is a version of it that's been uploaded on May 4th.
5711000	5718000	And it looks like almost seven gigs in size. So maybe the game's already done.
5718000	5724000	Maybe. Maybe it's a strategical release thing. You know, it's like it's their summer title. Who knows?
5724000	5729000	Cheeseburger in our chat room. Cheeseburger94 says, I'm stoked for New Paper Mario.
5729000	5732000	I really hope it will be more like the original two games.
5732000	5736000	And bonds006 says, Nintendo, show them something to keep the money coming in.
5736000	5740000	I still think Animal Crossing is doing plenty good for them for a little while.
5740000	5742000	Animal Crossing is printing money.
5742000	5748000	It is. But okay, I get the investors need something because the market is a crazy place right now.
5748000	5752000	So the investors need something to see in the future. So here's something for them.
5752000	5755000	But this wasn't it, right? Look, there was something a little something else, too, right?
5755000	5763000	Speaking of something for people that have invested money into like Nintendo's online service,
5763000	5769000	there's some more games that you can play in your Super NES and NES channel stuff.
5769000	5777000	So they've got on the NES side of the house, Rygar and Puzzle de Pon or Panel de Pon.
5778000	5784000	And then on the Super Nintendo, we have I'm sorry.
5784000	5787000	So actually, no, it looks like that would be a super Nintendo.
5787000	5790000	Yeah, I was like, Panel de Pon was Super Nintendo, I believe. Yeah. Sorry.
5790000	5794000	Yeah, it's it's the the Super Famicom box art that's throwing me.
5794000	5796000	So on the NES side, we just have Rygar.
5796000	5802000	And then on the Super Nintendo side, we have Wild Guns, Panel de Pon and Operation Logic Bomb.
5802000	5806000	Well, and to be to be fair, you can't be expected to know everything about Panel de Pon,
5806000	5812000	because it's a rare release where this never was released in the U.S. Tetris Attack.
5812000	5816000	Yes, I know. We got it in other type of branded situations.
5816000	5819000	But the actual Panel de Pon game was only ever released in Japan.
5819000	5821000	So this is another one of those.
5821000	5827000	And this kind of happened to us when we got like Mario 2 loss levels in the library.
5827000	5828000	We didn't get it in All-Stars.
5828000	5833000	We got the actual like Super Mario 2 Famicom ROM in the U.S. library.
5833000	5836000	So this is kind of something like that. So that's that's kind of neat.
5836000	5839000	Yeah. But Rygar with save states will be awesome.
5839000	5843000	Absolutely. God, I mean, Rygar is only going to benefit from everything in that emulator.
5843000	5846000	And Rygar is a great choice. I love that game.
5846000	5848000	Yeah. All those are going to be available on May 20th.
5848000	5850000	So look forward to those this week.
5850000	5854000	I mean, it would be nice if those types of releases were a little more frequent,
5854000	5859000	but all things said and done, it's not a terrible lineup for a month.
5859000	5860000	So I'll take it.
5860000	5862000	That's not too bad. Yeah.
5862000	5865000	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I'm actually hyped for Rygar.
5865000	5867000	I got it on NES recently,
5867000	5871000	but having it on Nintendo Switch Online would be nice since you can save state.
5871000	5875000	Absolutely. Bobby Black Wolf says they can't use the Tetris name.
5875000	5878000	So that's why it's paneled upon and not Tetris Attack.
5878000	5882000	Tetris company won't allow them to use the Tetris name since it's not Tetris.
5882000	5885000	And VG Realness says it's totally Tetris Attack. LOL.
5885000	5887000	Yes. I mean, it is. It is the equivalent.
5887000	5893000	Like paneled upon and Tetris Attack is like Puyo Puyo and Kirby's Avalanche
5893000	5895000	or Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.
5895000	5897000	It is exactly like it is the same damn game,
5897000	5900000	but they just splash the familiar characters in it.
5900000	5905000	So in paneled upon, are there any recognizable characters in paneled upon?
5905000	5908000	I think there's like a smash move from that game or something,
5908000	5909000	but that's like it.
5909000	5912000	That's like it. It's a very otherwise kind of obscure Nintendo title
5912000	5914000	and more people will remember Tetris Attack
5914000	5917000	or it's Pokemon Puzzle League is the same game, isn't it?
5919000	5920000	I think it is.
5920000	5921000	Planet Puzzle League?
5921000	5924000	No, Pokemon Puzzle League and then later Planet Puzzle League.
5924000	5926000	I think they're all paneled upon.
5926000	5927000	Yeah.
5927000	5930000	So you kind of get the old school, the first version of that.
5932000	5936000	All right. Bobby Black Wolf says paneled upon has original characters.
5936000	5938000	The US localization made it Yoshi characters.
5938000	5941000	Well, that was Tetris Attack had the Yoshi characters, right?
5941000	5943000	If I remember right.
5943000	5944000	Yeah.
5944000	5945000	Yep. Thank you.
5945000	5947000	Bobby says Pokemon Puzzle League on N64 is paneled upon.
5947000	5948000	That's what I thought.
5948000	5950000	So all right.
5950000	5952000	Well, I'm glad we have that all cleared up.
5952000	5953000	That's a fun puzzle game, though.
5953000	5956000	I love Pokemon Puzzle League because that was the game I kind of found first
5956000	5959000	and then I heard, oh, it was based off all these other games
5959000	5960000	and I kind of discovered them.
5960000	5962000	Let's talk a little bit about Discord.
5962000	5965000	You know, video chat and all that is very popular right now
5965000	5967000	with all the social distancing going on
5967000	5969000	and people not able to really hang out in person.
5969000	5973000	So there's a lot of virtual things that are being used.
5973000	5975000	And video chat is one of them.
5975000	5979000	Obviously, Zoom, if we want to talk about Cuckoo Banana sales,
5979000	5982000	Zoom is one of those companies that's been doing very well in this situation.
5982000	5984000	And I think you're seeing a lot of other, you know,
5984000	5987000	conferencing competitors taking steps to be in that space.
5987000	5990000	I know Skype's been doing a lot of upgrades for better or for worse,
5990000	5992000	and I would say for worse.
5992000	5993000	I had another, and this is what, again,
5993000	5996000	if you want to know why this show isn't using Skype anymore.
5996000	5998000	So you know I do my survivor LARPs, right?
5998000	6001000	So I'm like on the production team for, I'm not playing it,
6001000	6005000	but I'm just kind of like helping to oversee it and all that stuff this week
6005000	6007000	and have for the past couple of weeks.
6007000	6013000	And so the newest version of Skype on PC broke my recording
6013000	6017000	because for whatever reason, it doesn't integrate through the desktop audio anymore.
6017000	6021000	It decides to use its own audio thing with no warning or change or whatever.
6021000	6024000	So those are the types of things that Skype just does to make things better
6024000	6026000	that have me very irritated with it.
6026000	6032000	Anyway, on the other side, Discord doing some things to improve itself a little bit,
6032000	6036000	especially when more and more people are using video conferencing.
6036000	6038000	And now Discord already had video chat,
6038000	6043000	but now it has server video chat for desktop, web, and iOS.
6043000	6046000	So again, Discord has had this since 2017,
6046000	6049000	and obviously Bobby and the studio here,
6049000	6053000	we've been using video chat to talk to each other for a while.
6053000	6055000	So this is a little something new.
6055000	6059000	What this is, is now it's more like drop in and drop out conversation.
6059000	6063000	So you can hang out in a video call with people or just be by yourself
6063000	6066000	and people can see that you're there and drop in and talk to you.
6066000	6070000	So it's almost kind of like that Zoom line that's open or a Zoom meeting that's open
6070000	6074000	and people just kind of drop in and drop out as opposed to making a call,
6074000	6076000	which is a little more like what Skype does.
6076000	6078000	You have to actually call to initiate a conversation.
6078000	6080000	That's what Discord was doing before.
6080000	6082000	So that's kind of neat.
6082000	6085000	And it is interesting how Discord is kind of positioning themselves
6085000	6087000	in that video chat marketplace,
6087000	6092000	especially when it's video chat for gamers,
6092000	6098000	but I see a lot of people that don't consider themselves hardcore gamers
6098000	6103000	more and more that are starting to use it for chats and games,
6103000	6105000	like D&D type of games.
6105000	6109000	I think Discord is getting very popular with the D&D scene as far as I know.
6109000	6111000	So kind of interesting.
6112000	6113000	Anyway, there you go.
6113000	6115000	Let's go back.
6115000	6120000	Let's go back in time to a time when we didn't have video chat online.
6120000	6122000	It's the classic game of the week.
6122000	6124000	And every week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault
6124000	6128000	and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking this game out.
6128000	6132000	But once a month, instead of picking a game, she likes to pick a pinball table.
6132000	6134000	And I believe that's what we've got this week.
6134000	6140000	So Dark Soccer is going to give us the classic pinball table of the month.
6140000	6142000	So what did you pick for this month?
6142000	6149000	So I picked the machine Bride of Pinbot.
6149000	6154000	So, yay, Bride of Pinbot, which is by itself an amazing table.
6154000	6160000	But beyond just being an amazing table, it's actually had an update.
6160000	6164000	So we'll get into that just a little bit.
6164000	6166000	So Bride of Pinbot.
6166000	6169000	Now, I will go ahead and say it was done by Jon Trudeau.
6169000	6172000	So we know what kind of a creeper he was.
6172000	6175000	But it was also done by Python.
6175000	6178000	I'm going to mispronounce that last name, Angelou.
6178000	6180000	And it was released by Williams.
6180000	6185000	The table itself came out in 1991, and it is a follow-up to Pinbot,
6185000	6192000	which, going back into video games, Pinbot was a NES game, remember?
6192000	6193000	I do?
6193000	6194000	Yep.
6194000	6202000	So anyway, with Bride of Pinbot, it took that theme from Pinbot,
6202000	6207000	and it took it in a somewhat different direction.
6207000	6213000	Instead of the platform like you had, you had to put her eyes in.
6213000	6218000	It kind of had this pachinko-style playfield similar to how Pinbot had.
6218000	6221000	But you had other things going on with it.
6221000	6227000	It had a rotating box with the machine's face states on the sides.
6227000	6231000	It had raised eyes and holes, depending on which face that you were on.
6231000	6234000	Your left ramp had a saucer with a small wheel.
6234000	6238000	Single ball, that saucer would give you a random award,
6238000	6240000	including sometimes a timed jackpot.
6240000	6244000	You have multi-ball, which comes after the metamorphosis,
6244000	6246000	where you lock the eyes and everything.
6246000	6248000	You have the heartbeat ramp.
6248000	6250000	I mean, it was really great.
6250000	6254000	And there is, with that center ramp,
6254000	6258000	there is an interval for a shot that's worth a billion points.
6258000	6263000	And actually getting that shot at least once
6263000	6268000	will let it be recorded in the special Billionaire's Club on the high score list,
6268000	6270000	that's separate from the main high score.
6270000	6273000	And then once, of course, you activate all of her circuits,
6273000	6277000	then you get, I guess, kind of the wizard mode in the game.
6277000	6280000	It's kind of like pre-wizard modey stuff, but, you know, a lot of those lines.
6280000	6286000	And the voice of the machine was actually done by a singer named Stephanie Rogers.
6286000	6291000	And it's one of the earlier games that had a modesty mode,
6291000	6293000	because her voice was so sultry.
6293000	6298000	I mean, I can tell you another game that had a modesty mode,
6298000	6304000	that was, gosh, Big Bang Bar,
6305000	6313000	which was a prototype until someone was able to get the licensing for it.
6313000	6318000	So anyway, it is one of my absolute favorite tables.
6318000	6325000	And as you knew, you know, I had one for, I'd say, for a hot minute, right?
6325000	6327000	I played it long enough for me to play it at least once.
6327000	6329000	Yeah, for sure.
6329000	6331000	So, sorry.
6331000	6336000	So at any rate, it got an update not long ago,
6336000	6338000	but let me rewind a little bit back,
6338000	6345000	because there is actually one game that had some glitching going on in it earlier too,
6345000	6352000	because there was, the ROM version L7 had a multiplayer bug,
6352000	6358000	so they would actually have people wind back to the L6 build of the game.
6358000	6362000	So back to that, anyway, as I was saying, there was,
6362000	6364000	sorry, my voice is being stupid right now.
6364000	6370000	There was an update that's called Bride of Pinbot 2.0 that has,
6370000	6373000	you can get a color D&D for it.
6373000	6376000	It has new animations, new music.
6376000	6380000	The music to me, like, sounds almost like it's something out of Space Mountain.
6380000	6381000	I love it.
6381000	6386000	You know, it's just, it's beautiful.
6386000	6388000	It has new roads in it.
6388000	6395000	It uses the assets and then builds on it to where you're really getting a new experience with this.
6395000	6397000	I think it's absolutely a thing of beauty.
6397000	6403000	And you'll often see, you know, people will bring them out now for various,
6403000	6408000	let's say, pinball expos and classic gaming things.
6408000	6413000	And I think, yeah, Dark Touch, I think they did do one for high speed,
6413000	6415000	but I hadn't played it.
6415000	6421000	But at any rate, you can also get new translates for Bride of Pinbot 2.0.
6421000	6423000	Absolutely beautiful.
6423000	6427000	New cabinet decals, really nice artwork.
6427000	6431000	I should probably put up the footage of 2.0, shouldn't I?
6431000	6432000	Yeah, you might want to.
6432000	6433000	Let's do that. Here we go.
6433000	6441000	And by the way, the player in that footage is, well, it's from the channel 85VETTT.
6441000	6446000	And, well, it was put up in 2015.
6446000	6448000	I know it's been out for a hot minute.
6448000	6454000	But it's really, if you can get your hands on what to play,
6454000	6457000	if you can get one to own, that would also be pretty nice.
6457000	6465000	But it really is absolutely an amazing table, the Bride of Pinbot 2.0,
6465000	6471000	which, you know, we've had other fan updates and unofficial updates,
6471000	6475000	because you remember we were borrowing someone's Cactus Canyon continued,
6475000	6478000	which updates that little drama.
6478000	6483000	I think they finally released the full ruleset for Cactus Canyon.
6483000	6488000	Of course, it doesn't have the bonus modes like continued had
6488000	6493000	because Skrillex is licensed for the Cowboys vs. Aliens segment.
6493000	6499000	I should find that video and put it up again of Dan scoring that multiplayer,
6499000	6501000	the Cowboys vs. Aliens.
6501000	6503000	I'm going to go back to the 1.0 footage now that you've seen 2.0.
6503000	6504000	Cool.
6504000	6510000	But at any rate, you know, it's on my list of ones that I love.
6510000	6511000	I've definitely owned one.
6511000	6514000	I've had them in various states of repair.
6514000	6519000	And it really is a worthwhile table to play, absolutely gorgeous, so much fun.
6519000	6523000	And it's classic, which, of course, this one was followed by one
6523000	6526000	I'm not going to be discussing in the segment,
6526000	6532000	well, in the segment ongoing called Jackpot, which, you know, we had that too.
6532000	6534000	Jackpot's really a fun one.
6534000	6537000	But of the three, I'm going to say that Bride of Pinbot,
6537000	6541000	and especially the Bride of Pinbot 2.0, is my favorite of that series.
6541000	6543000	All right.
6543000	6546000	Anything else to say about the classic pinball table of the month?
6546000	6548000	I see.
6549000	6551000	I think that's what she said.
6551000	6553000	Yeah, no, I see you or something like that, I think.
6553000	6554000	I can see.
6554000	6556000	Yeah, that's what the old pinbot would do.
6556000	6558000	Now I see you.
6558000	6560000	Now I see you.
6560000	6562000	All right, cool.
6562000	6564000	Good pick, good pick.
6564000	6566000	And because I've played this one at your house,
6566000	6568000	so I particularly remember this one.
6568000	6574000	You played it in my garage back when I lived in Citrus Frights.
6574000	6575000	Oh, that's right.
6575000	6576000	Oh, that's right.
6576000	6578000	It wasn't even in your new place.
6578000	6580000	Yeah, oh my gosh, it was that long ago.
6580000	6583000	It was among our first ones, because we had Whodunnit,
6583000	6585000	and had Rocky and Bullinkle.
6585000	6586000	Yeah, yeah.
6586000	6587000	At the time, yeah.
6587000	6590000	And we had the rotating Judge Dredd.
6590000	6595000	I say rotating because we've had multiple Judge Dredd's thanks to Will.
6595000	6597000	All right.
6597000	6598000	Oh, go ahead.
6598000	6600000	One last thing, to be a little sad,
6600000	6604000	I also want to give a shout out to Will, who had to put one too to sleep.
6604000	6605000	That's sad.
6605000	6606000	Spitbull.
6606000	6608000	Sorry to hear that.
6608000	6610000	Midna and 1-2 got along really well.
6610000	6613000	Dark Soccer, are you hanging out to do rapid fire news?
6613000	6614000	Are you going to cut out?
6614000	6615000	Yeah.
6615000	6616000	Okay.
6616000	6617000	I'll do a rapid fire.
6617000	6618000	All right, let's get to rapid fire news.
6618000	6619000	Will you want to start us off then?
6619000	6621000	Yeah, I guess.
6621000	6624000	Sure, like, sure, I'll do one.
6624000	6629000	But anyway, there, you know, this goes back again to saying
6629000	6632000	that we've had to do a lot of our memorializing and events
6632000	6634000	in online games.
6634000	6640000	UC Berkeley seniors are graduating in Minecraft through a Minecraft ceremony.
6640000	6642000	I think that's cool.
6642000	6647000	And they've actually done a recreation of the football field and everything
6647000	6651000	so that their little avatars can go walking across of it
6651000	6657000	and they put it all together and to kind of give them, you know,
6657000	6660000	maybe it's not the graduation that everyone wanted,
6660000	6664000	but it's still a really nice gesture for them to do so.
6664000	6667000	And then they're doing a virtual music festival with 90 performers
6667000	6670000	taking part over several days.
6670000	6673000	So pretty cool.
6673000	6677000	And then last but not least, and this is happy news for all of us,
6677000	6680000	I might have done a little dance,
6680000	6689000	but May 22nd is the revised release date for the Turbografx 16 mini.
6689000	6691000	Yay!
6691000	6693000	Is Konami doing something right?
6693000	6695000	Yeah, I don't know if you got the shipping thing from Amazon.
6695000	6699000	Mine's on the 26th, but whatever.
6699000	6701000	I'm like, I've been waiting this long.
6701000	6703000	It'll get here when it gets here.
6703000	6708000	Well, and you know, they had a mess of them in Japan.
6708000	6710000	Oh, yeah, and I heard you could have bought it this whole time
6710000	6712000	if you wanted to just buy one of the ones from Japan.
6712000	6716000	But again, I'll just wait for the one that's meant for me.
6716000	6717000	Yeah, indeed.
6717000	6718000	But I'm excited for it.
6718000	6720000	No, no, me too.
6720000	6723000	I am absolutely just thrilled as I can be.
6723000	6725000	I mean, we've all waited for one.
6725000	6726000	I really would like...
6726000	6729000	I was thinking that I really wanted a Japanese one,
6729000	6734000	but I don't care about Tokimeki Memorial that much.
6734000	6737000	Well, then they're also putting many of the Japanese versions of the games
6737000	6739000	in the U.S. ones, so...
6739000	6742000	They are, so I get to annoy people with chowainiki again.
6742000	6745000	Well, hey, that'll give you something to talk about next week
6745000	6747000	on the show that's not just Animal Crossing.
6747000	6748000	If it arrives.
6748000	6749000	If it arrives, yeah.
6749000	6751000	But yeah, but I mean, among the other games on there,
6751000	6754000	we've got Newtopia, which I love Newtopia.
6754000	6756000	It's kind of a little Zelda-like game.
6756000	6758000	Splatterhouse, and that would be the other reason
6758000	6762000	I'd want the Japanese version, is for the unedited Splatterhouse.
6762000	6764000	Although, maybe you can switch your region?
6764000	6767000	But Snatcher!
6767000	6768000	Snatcher.
6768000	6769000	I know, there's some good stuff on there.
6769000	6770000	I don't think it's translated, though.
6770000	6771000	No, I don't think it is.
6771000	6773000	You have to use a guide or something to get through it.
6773000	6777000	Y'all can finally play a real rondo of blood.
6777000	6778000	Hooray.
6778000	6779000	That's on the PlayStation.
6779000	6780000	Hooray.
6780000	6781000	R-Type.
6781000	6782000	Though, R-Type.
6782000	6783000	That makes me happy, too, because I love R-Type.
6783000	6786000	And Extifer will get to play Alien Crush.
6786000	6787000	Oh, yeah.
6787000	6789000	Oh my god, he used to play that all day on the Wii.
6789000	6791000	He was so into it.
6791000	6792000	It was crazy.
6792000	6794000	Because the Wii had the turbo graphics stuff
6794000	6796000	and the backwards compatibility.
6796000	6797000	All right.
6797000	6798000	Anyway.
6798000	6799000	You know what I mean.
6799000	6800000	What the hell am I saying?
6800000	6801000	The eShop.
6801000	6802000	What the hell did they call it?
6802000	6803000	Virtual...
6803000	6804000	Or console.
6804000	6805000	Virtual console.
6805000	6806000	Virtual console.
6806000	6807000	I already forgot.
6807000	6808000	All right.
6808000	6809000	Anyway.
6809000	6810000	Dark Zara, thank you.
6810000	6811000	It was lovely to have you back tonight.
6811000	6813000	I hope you're feeling a lot better.
6813000	6814000	I hope the show helped.
6814000	6815000	Why don't I do releases?
6815000	6816000	You want to?
6816000	6817000	All right.
6817000	6818000	All right.
6818000	6819000	Well, then.
6819000	6820000	Well, can we do the rest of it?
6820000	6821000	I don't have to do any more after that,
6821000	6823000	but I would really like to just hang around
6823000	6825000	and participate a little bit.
6825000	6826000	I'm still kind of...
6826000	6827000	Eh.
6827000	6828000	All right.
6828000	6829000	Up to you.
6829000	6830000	Well, let's get through the...
6830000	6831000	You let me know when you're done.
6831000	6832000	Let's do the rest of the rapid fire news first.
6832000	6833000	So, Loki, why don't you go?
6833000	6834000	Go show.
6834000	6835000	Okay.
6835000	6838000	So, let's talk about free stuff.
6838000	6842000	So, Lego Ninjago, the movie, the video game,
6842000	6847000	is now free on PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4
6847000	6849000	until May 21st.
6849000	6851000	So, go download it on your platform of choice
6851000	6853000	or all three like I did,
6853000	6856000	because you never know where you need free games.
6856000	6857000	And it was actually pretty good.
6857000	6859000	I actually purchased this one on the Switch
6859000	6860000	a while back for my kids,
6860000	6862000	so I did play a little bit of it.
6862000	6864000	And the Lego games are pretty good.
6864000	6865000	I love the movie.
6865000	6868000	And then, let's see.
6868000	6870000	So, we're kind of wondering, you know,
6870000	6872000	what are these other companies going to be doing,
6872000	6876000	you know, for upcoming events and game announcements
6876000	6879000	since we don't really have like a formalized E3?
6879000	6881000	Well, we now know at least what Ubisoft's doing.
6881000	6884000	So, they have a Ubisoft Forward event
6884000	6887000	that's coming out on July 12th
6887000	6890000	that they're going to talk about their game reveals
6890000	6891000	and news and whatnot.
6891000	6893000	So, that's going to be happening.
6893000	6898000	It looks like 12 p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. UK,
6898000	6901000	on the 12th of July.
6901000	6903000	So, neat.
6903000	6905000	I always look forward to those.
6905000	6908000	They're usually, out of the third-party companies,
6908000	6910000	they seem to be kind of the more,
6910000	6912000	the best one out of the group.
6912000	6914000	They get some interesting hosts sometimes.
6914000	6916000	I wonder if that'll be the case this year, too.
6916000	6919000	Yeah, I'll be curious to see how they're going to do that.
6919000	6920000	So, yeah.
6920000	6922000	Because they had like Joel McHale one year.
6922000	6924000	Aisha Tyler did it for a little bit.
6924000	6925000	So, yeah.
6925000	6926000	Yeah.
6926000	6927000	All right.
6927000	6930000	Interesting trademark spotted in Europe by Capcom.
6930000	6934000	And the trademark is for Capcom Arcade Stadium.
6934000	6935000	No idea what this is,
6935000	6938000	although the trademark indicates it could be a Nintendo Switch thing.
6938000	6941000	Capcom did do an arcade compilation
6941000	6943000	on the PlayStation 3, I want to say,
6943000	6945000	and that probably was on the 360 as well.
6945000	6946000	So, there is that.
6946000	6949000	I don't know if this is some type of port or update to that
6949000	6951000	that's going to be on the Nintendo Switch.
6951000	6953000	It definitely sounds like a compilation of some sort.
6953000	6954000	Doesn't it?
6954000	6956000	Yeah, it sounds like they're old school games.
6956000	6958000	I wouldn't expect things like Street Fighter
6958000	6961000	and things that they've been selling in other packages to be in there,
6961000	6963000	but I guess anything is certainly possible.
6963000	6966000	And Capcom has a lot of like old classics.
6966000	6969000	I'm still holding up for an official release of Quiz and Dragons.
6969000	6973000	Yes, I realize all the quiz questions are dated as hell at this point,
6973000	6975000	because all the questions are from like 1994
6975000	6977000	or wherever that game came out, but...
6977000	6978000	Let's get a new one then.
6978000	6979000	Yeah, right.
6979000	6981000	Can we have a new Quiz and Dragons?
6981000	6982000	Yeah, why not?
6982000	6983000	Let's get a new one.
6983000	6984000	That would be awesome.
6984000	6988000	I thought they did like a Quiz and Dragons for like...
6988000	6989000	Maybe I'm thinking of something else,
6989000	6991000	but I thought there was a game like that
6991000	6993000	that was for like 3DS or something like that.
6993000	6994000	Oh shit, maybe.
6994000	6995000	I don't know.
6995000	6996000	I missed it if there was.
6996000	6997000	Maybe Jack can help.
6997000	7000000	Also, one of those releases that came out on the Switch,
7000000	7001000	you might have forgotten that this happened,
7001000	7002000	but it was a pretty big deal.
7002000	7005000	The Panzer Dragoon remake was released on the Switch.
7005000	7007000	That was a little while ago,
7007000	7010000	and some people had some complaints that it wasn't very good
7010000	7013000	and it didn't live up to the trailer and all that stuff.
7013000	7015000	Well, they did do a big update this week.
7015000	7018000	It's up to version 1.3 now with some new options,
7018000	7020000	cheat codes, and other improvements.
7020000	7024000	Episode 0, a performance mode for 60 frames a second,
7024000	7027000	multi-button fire, Blue Dragon motion rework.
7027000	7030000	They've really gone back and tried to tweak the game based on feedback.
7030000	7033000	I have not played it myself yet to see what I think,
7033000	7036000	but I've heard that it's still not perfect,
7036000	7038000	but it's way better shaped than it was.
7038000	7042000	That was the general consensus of what I was hearing about that remake.
7042000	7044000	All right, let's travel around the world
7044000	7046000	and check out some release dates,
7046000	7050000	as small as they may be for this date and time in this era.
7050000	7052000	Loki, what's coming out in the US?
7052000	7053000	Not a whole lot.
7053000	7057000	We've got this week, it looks like Golf With Your Friends.
7057000	7059000	That's going to be on PC and Nintendo Switch,
7059000	7061000	PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
7061000	7064000	But, Loki, what if I don't have friends?
7064000	7067000	Well, then you can golf with nobody.
7067000	7069000	Golf with yourself.
7069000	7071000	Go golf yourself, Loki.
7071000	7073000	Go golf yourself.
7073000	7075000	That needs to be a name of a game. That's awesome.
7075000	7077000	Go golf yourself?
7077000	7079000	Can we put that on the list of dream games?
7079000	7081000	Go golf yourself.
7081000	7085000	There's been a lot of really good funny, like, what the golf and stuff like that.
7085000	7088000	That's true. Funny golf games.
7088000	7089000	They've had a few.
7089000	7090000	All right.
7090000	7092000	God, there's one.
7092000	7094000	This, man, tangent time.
7094000	7096000	So there was a golf game, actually,
7096000	7099000	that was on one of these PC gamer discs a while back
7099000	7101000	that I had gotten.
7101000	7104000	It was like a Halloween themed golf thing.
7104000	7107000	I used to love mini golf games.
7107000	7109000	Big fan of that.
7109000	7111000	Growing up near mini golf places.
7111000	7113000	But, yeah, man, I need to find that.
7113000	7115000	Anyways, other games.
7115000	7116000	They're coming out.
7116000	7119000	So the wonderful 101 remastered on PC,
7119000	7121000	Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4.
7121000	7123000	So that's coming out this week.
7123000	7125000	Cannibal Cuisine on PC,
7125000	7127000	Nintendo Switch.
7127000	7129000	Sounds interesting.
7129000	7131000	Biped on Nintendo Switch.
7131000	7133000	The Persistence on PC,
7133000	7135000	Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,
7135000	7137000	and Xbox One.
7137000	7141000	Spirit Hunter NG on Nintendo Switch.
7141000	7144000	We've got Maneater on PC,
7144000	7146000	PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
7146000	7148000	Monstrum on Nintendo Switch,
7148000	7150000	PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
7150000	7152000	And last but not least, Saints Row,
7152000	7154000	the third remaster on PC,
7154000	7157000	PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
7157000	7160000	We have a few games trickling through in Japan.
7160000	7161000	That game you mentioned,
7161000	7164000	the Spirit Hunter NG in Japan,
7164000	7166000	is just called NG in Japan.
7166000	7169000	But it looks like a scary game on the Switch,
7169000	7171000	where it's like spirits killing people.
7171000	7173000	It seems like the type of thing Jamie would be into.
7173000	7175000	She likes those Japanese horror spirits
7175000	7177000	or killing everybody type of things.
7177000	7178000	Oh, yeah, totally.
7178000	7180000	So this is a Jamie game.
7180000	7182000	That releases in Japan this week as well
7182000	7184000	on May the 21st.
7184000	7185000	The other big release on the Switch
7185000	7187000	is a Phantasy Star Online 2,
7187000	7188000	ironically enough.
7188000	7191000	Because you know it's on the Switch in Japan.
7191000	7194000	And this is an Episode 6 deluxe package
7194000	7195000	called Cloud.
7195000	7197000	So I think it's just some type of rebundling of it
7197000	7199000	to celebrate like a new episode
7199000	7201000	that's out in Japan anyway.
7201000	7203000	And then on the PlayStation 4,
7203000	7205000	I'm trying to see if we have anything this week.
7205000	7207000	That same NG game is out as well as Phantasy Star.
7207000	7209000	So the same game is out on the PlayStation 4.
7209000	7211000	And that's really it for this week.
7211000	7213000	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
7213000	7214000	Only a couple.
7214000	7218000	We have Saints Row 3 Remastered and Maneater.
7218000	7220000	That would be it.
7220000	7222000	That is it. All right.
7222000	7225000	This is the part of the show where we get into the emails.
7225000	7227000	Do you want me to do it, or you want to do it, or what?
7227000	7229000	I'm not even logged in.
7229000	7231000	Okay, well, neither am I.
7231000	7233000	Is there anything important?
7233000	7235000	I saw an email from YYR come in at the last second.
7235000	7237000	I'm logging in.
7237000	7238000	Oh, okay, good.
7238000	7239000	Because I am apparently the only one
7239000	7241000	who cleans out the inbox.
7241000	7243000	Yes, you are.
7243000	7245000	Yes, I am.
7245000	7247000	Okay, it's loading up the email for me,
7247000	7249000	and I will be happy to do that.
7249000	7251000	Okay, it's loading up the email for me,
7251000	7255000	and I will be happy to read it as soon as it freaking co-operates.
7255000	7256000	Oh, you know what?
7256000	7257000	I refresh it the moment it pops.
7257000	7258000	Okay, ready?
7258000	7259000	Yes.
7259000	7260000	Hello, LR.
7260000	7262000	Just a quick comment on last week's discussion
7262000	7264000	regarding the Xbox Series X event.
7264000	7267000	It's very easy to say, well, the games are still in development.
7267000	7269000	Maybe they're kind of early.
7269000	7271000	Maybe there isn't much to show yet.
7271000	7274000	There should be more to show in a few months, et cetera.
7274000	7275000	But here's the thing.
7275000	7277000	Microsoft and Sony seem like they're still planning
7277000	7281000	to launch their new plastic and metal boxes this holiday season.
7281000	7283000	If that means November,
7283000	7286000	that's about six months from this very moment,
7286000	7287000	and it seems like some of the games
7287000	7290000	announced we're targeting the launch window.
7290000	7291000	Now, let's get one thing straight.
7291000	7293000	Six months is plenty of time for me
7293000	7295000	to add new challenges to super multitasking.
7295000	7299000	But considering the size and scope of most AAA productions,
7299000	7303000	those games had damn better be within sight of their finish lines.
7303000	7304000	If we're six months away,
7304000	7306000	and they barely got anything to show,
7306000	7309000	then either the devs have a real problem on their hands,
7309000	7311000	or the games need to be delayed.
7311000	7312000	Anywho.
7312000	7314000	I don't want to well actually this too much,
7314000	7316000	but maybe a little bit.
7316000	7318000	But just something to keep in mind,
7318000	7319000	just something to keep in mind,
7319000	7322000	is that a lot of times the builds for E3
7322000	7325000	and the types of things that are shown at these presentations
7325000	7328000	are done quite a bit in advance.
7328000	7330000	So I don't want to deflate the point too much,
7330000	7331000	but it may be a little more in six months,
7331000	7333000	it may be like eight months, nine months,
7333000	7337000	just because these things are usually compiled and so forth,
7337000	7339000	like way more in advance.
7339000	7341000	But I get your point.
7341000	7344000	I'm not trying to detract from the point too much.
7346000	7347000	Moving forward.
7347000	7350000	Anywho, I hope you're all enjoying the show.
7350000	7352000	I'll post a link in the VoG Discord
7352000	7354000	to something fun on Friday night.
7354000	7357000	Eleven gamers have never heard of super multitasking before,
7357000	7361000	did a blind race to clear 30 challenges out of 42 in the game.
7361000	7362000	It was pretty entertaining to watch,
7362000	7365000	so if you've got some time to kill, head on over and check it out.
7365000	7367000	Best wishes to all, including the listeners.
7367000	7368000	Have a great week.
7368000	7370000	Warm regards, Aaron, YYR.
7370000	7373000	Yeah, Bobby talked about that speedrun a little bit at the end of his show,
7373000	7375000	and so now we've talked about it on our show.
7375000	7377000	But yeah, it is there in the Discord.
7377000	7379000	I didn't watch it myself, but when I heard Bobby,
7379000	7382000	I guess Bobby saw it and he was talking about it a little bit,
7382000	7384000	and so I was like, oh, that's really cool
7384000	7387000	that it showed up there in a speedrun and all that stuff,
7387000	7390000	and I think that's a great way to get the word out.
7390000	7394000	Again, the internet is sleeping on super multitasking.
7394000	7395000	That game is great.
7395000	7400000	It's just a fun little time waster but challenging thing.
7400000	7404000	It's such a good product, and this thing should be wildfire.
7404000	7406000	I hope it was well received by the speedrunners.
7406000	7408000	I'm sure it was.
7408000	7411000	So, excellent.
7411000	7413000	Oh, it was just linked in our chat room too.
7413000	7414000	Thanks, Matt.
7414000	7415000	Cool.
7415000	7416000	Wonderful.
7416000	7418000	All right, so if you want to email us in a future week,
7418000	7422000	participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to do so.
7422000	7424000	In the meantime, we have a few more stories for you
7424000	7426000	before we wrap up the show.
7426000	7428000	Loki, why don't you get to it?
7428000	7435000	All right, so we've got the news that PUBG is adding bots on PC.
7435000	7440000	So they're introducing, I guess, a ranked mode
7440000	7446000	where players can play against the best players in the world,
7446000	7449000	but every mode that's not necessarily ranked
7449000	7456000	is going to get bots to fill up the space where actual players aren't.
7456000	7461000	So they said that they're introducing the bots
7461000	7464000	due to the widening skill gap among the player base.
7464000	7470000	So it's going to allow new or bad players something easier to shoot at.
7470000	7475000	So me, me and Bobby Blackwolf get to fight bots.
7475000	7478000	I'm similar back with Titanfall as well,
7478000	7481000	because Titanfall used to have the main characters
7481000	7484000	were kind of like the Titan pilots and stuff like that,
7484000	7488000	and then you'd have these fodder characters that were around
7488000	7492000	that you would be able to easily kill to build up your experience bar
7492000	7494000	to call down your Titan and stuff.
7494000	7499000	So I don't know. It's not a big deal, I think.
7499000	7501000	See, I thought the punchline to this was going to be
7501000	7503000	they have to put bots in it to make sure that there's actually
7503000	7505000	a hundred people playing it on Stadia.
7505000	7511000	No, that's not necessarily the reason,
7511000	7515000	but they said, of course, this is just the first iteration of their bots.
7515000	7519000	In the coming months, they'll be implementing machine learning techniques
7519000	7522000	to monitor how humans play to improve them.
7522000	7527000	Of course, because it is a new thing that's being added to the game,
7527000	7528000	everybody hates it.
7528000	7530000	What? Change? We hate that.
7530000	7534000	Yes, apparently folks are not enjoying that.
7534000	7538000	But yeah, it's a thing that's happening.
7538000	7541000	I thought it would have been just because maybe
7541000	7543000	PUBG since it's been out for a while,
7543000	7545000	maybe they're not filling up their matches.
7545000	7547000	That's what I was thinking too, not to be shady,
7547000	7550000	but the reality is they used to be the only kid on the block,
7550000	7553000	and now there's tons of these types of games.
7553000	7555000	Yeah, so some of the other games,
7555000	7557000	like one we'll probably mention here in just a minute,
7557000	7561000	could probably utilize some of these AI bots
7561000	7567000	to help fill out their games when it's not necessarily doing all that great.
7567000	7572000	Well, it's doing fine, but they're not filling up as quickly as they used to.
7572000	7575000	Now, I'll give it this, the AI integration
7575000	7579000	and the whole how it's going to learn from actual human behavior.
7579000	7581000	That part's kind of cool.
7581000	7584000	I'm also not super upset about it,
7584000	7588000	although it does kind of take the thrill out of it
7588000	7590000	when it's like, oh, it's a one versus 100 match,
7590000	7593000	but they're not really all people.
7593000	7599000	But I always secretly wondered if Tetris 99 wasn't doing the same thing.
7599000	7601000	They'll never tell you.
7601000	7603000	Yeah, they'll never tell you.
7603000	7605000	They'll never tell you.
7605000	7607000	They'll never tell you.
7608000	7610000	They'll never tell you.
7610000	7612000	Yeah, they'll never tell you.
7612000	7615000	But there's a part of me that has always wondered,
7615000	7619000	like, well, they could be doing it and just not saying anything.
7619000	7621000	I don't know.
7621000	7623000	There's a lot they could be doing, yeah.
7623000	7625000	Yeah, they don't exactly show them.
7625000	7627000	Well, no, I guess they do put a leaderboard at the end,
7627000	7629000	and they show all the names.
7629000	7631000	So I guess there's that.
7631000	7633000	It could be procedurally generated names.
7633000	7635000	It's just like everyone is playing Overwatch and like...
7635000	7637000	You couldn't put conspiracy theories out there
7637000	7639000	without the receipts to back it up.
7639000	7641000	There's plenty of that going on in the world already.
7641000	7643000	It's just like Overwatch, you know,
7643000	7645000	when I was playing in some of those games,
7645000	7647000	like unranked or whatever,
7647000	7649000	and you're playing there,
7649000	7651000	and then all of a sudden the bots at the end are like,
7651000	7653000	yeah, good job, good game, good game, and stuff like that.
7653000	7656000	It's like, I can't tell if these are real people or not.
7656000	7658000	It's like, I think they're bots.
7658000	7660000	It might be.
7660000	7662000	All right.
7662000	7664000	Let's move on and talk a little bit about...
7664000	7667000	I can't believe I have the Grand Theft Auto 5 story,
7667000	7669000	but it's a busy week. What can I say?
7669000	7672000	And this is more for me than it is for Loki,
7672000	7675000	because I'm sure Loki bought Grand Theft Auto 5 on PC
7675000	7678000	a long time ago when it was first out.
7678000	7680000	But now I have it too,
7680000	7683000	because the Epic Games Store has been giving it away.
7683000	7686000	That's right. Grand Theft Auto 5 is the free game of the moment,
7686000	7688000	or free game of the week, I suppose,
7688000	7690000	on the Epic Games Store.
7690000	7693000	Actually, I'm glad we put the show together today,
7693000	7697000	because it reminded me today to go in there and get it,
7697000	7699000	because when this was first announced,
7699000	7701000	the Epic Games Store, of course, crashed,
7701000	7703000	because everybody was like,
7703000	7705000	Zomagod, free Grand Theft Auto 5,
7705000	7707000	were stampeding into the store,
7707000	7709000	and of course brought it to its knees.
7709000	7713000	So now that it's Sunday, it's very easy to get back in there and grab the game.
7713000	7715000	So that's pretty cool.
7715000	7718000	Grand Theft Auto 5, free until May 21st.
7719000	7721000	Go get it. Go get it.
7721000	7724000	Something I noticed when I did grab it today,
7724000	7728000	usually they tease what game is coming next for free.
7728000	7733000	For this one, they put, like, a bank vault that says to be announced, basically.
7733000	7735000	And that's what they did with Grand Theft Auto 5 as well.
7735000	7738000	Yeah. No, that's what I mean. That's what they did with Grand Theft Auto 5.
7738000	7742000	And it's doing it again for something else next week.
7742000	7744000	So we may, and I want to...
7744000	7746000	We may have another big title next week.
7747000	7752000	I think there's a reason they made everybody turn on the two-factor authentication all of a sudden for these.
7752000	7754000	I think we've got some big giveaways,
7754000	7756000	and they didn't want bots collecting them all.
7756000	7758000	So that's kind of interesting.
7758000	7760000	So, we'll see.
7760000	7763000	Anyway, yeah, so what else can I say?
7763000	7765000	It's free, Grand Theft Auto 5.
7765000	7768000	If you're, I mean, if you're, nothing's ever truly free.
7768000	7771000	So if you're willing to install and use the Epic Games Store,
7771000	7773000	which maybe you're not,
7773000	7775000	I'll use the store. I just won't give them my money.
7775000	7777000	I haven't, and I haven't like...
7777000	7779000	Well, I've actually given them my pay for things.
7779000	7781000	I won't give them my credit card.
7781000	7784000	But if they ever roll out the prepaid cards,
7784000	7787000	then I'll finally be able to buy Tetris Effect.
7787000	7789000	I tend to use PayPal on there, but like,
7789000	7791000	you know, I've got two-factor on that.
7791000	7793000	Oh, I didn't know they took PayPal.
7793000	7795000	I might not be opposed to using PayPal,
7795000	7797000	because then it's going through them.
7797000	7799000	I'll have to think about it.
7800000	7801000	But yeah.
7801000	7803000	I purchased, was it the last thing I just purchased on there,
7803000	7805000	just because I watch this channel,
7805000	7806000	Let's Game It Out all the time,
7806000	7809000	and he really likes to break satisfactory a bunch.
7809000	7812000	And so I got that, because it looked kind of interesting.
7812000	7814000	So I'll, you know, have to play it at some point.
7814000	7816000	But I did, yeah, I downloaded it again,
7816000	7820000	or I added to my library, Grand Theft Auto 5.
7820000	7822000	Although I have it on PC already,
7822000	7825000	and trying to get all my PC accounts,
7825000	7827000	or all my accounts for Grand Theft Auto 5,
7827000	7829000	because I got on like every platform,
7829000	7832000	is really hard to get those all merged together.
7832000	7834000	I don't play Grand Theft Auto Online,
7834000	7836000	so it's not, I mean, that's really what it's for,
7836000	7839000	but I'm wondering how this is going to work.
7839000	7841000	I guess I could just log into my Rockstar Games account,
7841000	7842000	and they'll be fine.
7842000	7843000	All right.
7843000	7847000	Well, let's move on with another story, Loki.
7847000	7848000	All right.
7848000	7852000	And then we talked a little bit about some issues with Valorant,
7852000	7858000	and their whole controversial anti-cheat system as well.
7858000	7863000	Well, apparently it's working somewhat well,
7863000	7869000	because they have banned 8,873 cheaters because of it.
7869000	7874000	So, I mean, that's something, I guess.
7874000	7876000	But yeah, I don't know.
7876000	7878000	Still, people don't like it.
7878000	7879000	Bye, cheaters.
7879000	7880000	Bye.
7880000	7882000	Yeah, because there's folks saying,
7882000	7884000	you know, I spent so much money on this crap,
7884000	7885000	and then I get banned.
7885000	7888000	What the hell, you know?
7888000	7892000	But it was a person that was on a cheating forum.
7892000	7893000	I don't know.
7893000	7896000	Like, don't cheat in games, or don't cheat in online games.
7896000	7898000	Yeah, don't cheat in online multiplayer games.
7898000	7900000	Cheat in single-player games all you want.
7900000	7903000	Yeah, just don't cheat in online games.
7903000	7905000	Exactly.
7905000	7906000	All right.
7906000	7907000	Well, one more story for you guys,
7907000	7909000	and I think this might have been a game
7909000	7911000	that Loki was referring to earlier.
7911000	7914000	It's another one of those battle royale type of games.
7914000	7918000	This may have actually, was the Culling one of the first ones
7918000	7919000	that actually did it?
7919000	7920000	It was, yeah.
7920000	7921000	So they have the Culling,
7921000	7924000	and then there was the Culling 2 that came out not too long ago,
7924000	7926000	and the Culling 2 is hot garbage
7926000	7928000	that literally no one was playing.
7928000	7930000	It was, like, completely empty.
7930000	7933000	Well, and then now we have the Culling Origins, right?
7933000	7936000	Yeah, the Culling Origins is basically the first game again,
7936000	7938000	but they kind of remastered it,
7938000	7941000	but they've re-released it with a new,
7941000	7943000	it's free to play now.
7943000	7944000	Well...
7944000	7945000	Sort of.
7945000	7946000	No.
7946000	7947000	Not exactly.
7947000	7948000	It was free to play.
7948000	7950000	You have to buy the game for $5.99 now,
7950000	7952000	so you buy the game for $5.99,
7952000	7954000	and then the developers, Aviant,
7954000	7956000	is going to be charging players a fee
7956000	7959000	if you want to play more than one match in a day.
7959000	7962000	You have to buy token packs or weekly, monthly passes
7962000	7964000	just to play the game.
7964000	7966000	Yeah, so what it was before,
7966000	7969000	so it was $5.99 before for the base game,
7969000	7971000	and then they sold skins in there,
7971000	7974000	and apparently no one was buying the skins,
7974000	7978000	and then now they're charging $5.99 for the game
7978000	7981000	and then charging for folks to play the game,
7981000	7983000	but, like...
7983000	7985000	That's not smart.
7985000	7986000	Like...
7986000	7987000	No.
7987000	7989000	If you, like, what you need to do,
7989000	7991000	like, if you believe your game,
7991000	7994000	like, honestly, this pricing model just says
7994000	7996000	your game isn't worth it.
7996000	7999000	This pricing model just says this game isn't worth it.
7999000	8002000	Because if it was worth it,
8002000	8004000	you would just charge $19.99,
8004000	8006000	which is what PUBG's been charging for a long time.
8006000	8008000	They charge more than that, right? $24.99?
8008000	8012000	Just charge $19.99 and get rid of the stupid thing.
8012000	8015000	Yeah, I don't think they can charge $19.99 for this game
8015000	8017000	because if it's anything like the calling 2 was,
8017000	8019000	it is garbage.
8019000	8021000	Then it's not worth it. Your game's not worth it.
8021000	8024000	So, yeah, I mean...
8024000	8026000	It's unfortunate.
8026000	8028000	You know, it's just coming back,
8028000	8030000	you get it that you did it first,
8030000	8032000	or you were one of the first people to do it,
8032000	8034000	but just because you did it first doesn't mean you're the best.
8034000	8037000	It certainly doesn't mean that if you were the best at one time
8037000	8039000	that you're the best now.
8042000	8046000	Let me have a very frank discussion with the creators of the culling
8046000	8049000	because I can relate to you on a certain level.
8049000	8053000	If doing it first meant you were gonna be the biggest and richest,
8053000	8054000	guess what?
8054000	8057000	We'd have people listening to this podcast.
8059000	8062000	So, take it from me, culling.
8062000	8064000	You're fucked.
8064000	8067000	You're just gonna have to enjoy your nice...
8067000	8071000	Enjoy the fans you do have, because that's what we do.
8071000	8073000	Enjoy the fans you do have,
8073000	8076000	because nickel and diming them like this and all,
8076000	8079000	that's just... It ain't gonna fly.
8079000	8081000	It's not gonna work. Take it from us.
8081000	8084000	Just because you're the oldest doesn't mean you're the most well-received.
8085000	8088000	So, it's just not a very good solution to the problem
8088000	8093000	which was that they couldn't get people interested in buying their skin packs and stuff
8093000	8096000	and so they weren't making enough money to run the servers.
8096000	8100000	Fine, I get that, but this isn't the way to do it either
8100000	8106000	because what you needed to do was instead make some more interesting items for people to buy
8106000	8109000	and do it that way.
8109000	8111000	You have to do free-to-play, especially in this space
8111000	8115000	because you have very good competition doing free-to-play
8115000	8118000	and then you have folks doing the pay-to-play stuff
8118000	8120000	but they're not charging per game.
8120000	8124000	Honestly, maybe, and I don't mean to sound like a bitch,
8124000	8128000	but maybe you should ask yourself,
8128000	8135000	is this product good enough to be taking up space on the server in the first place?
8136000	8142000	Yeah, it's just, I don't know. I don't know why anyone would try to do this
8142000	8146000	and we've seen bigger companies fail at this as well.
8146000	8150000	I mean, so, you know, Radical Heights, anyone?
8150000	8153000	I just, I don't see them succeeding.
8153000	8156000	We're gonna send our thoughts and prayers.
8156000	8158000	That's what we'll do.
8158000	8160000	All right.
8160000	8163000	Anyhow, let's move on.
8163000	8165000	Anyhow, let's move on.
8165000	8168000	If you guys have some comments or some topics that we didn't address yet
8168000	8171000	that you'd like us to, we open up the listener roundtable via the chat room
8171000	8173000	if you guys have any questions or further comment
8173000	8176000	as we interact live with you guys live on Sunday night
8176000	8179000	here at twitch.tv slash vog network
8179000	8183000	for here, our 820th episode for May the 17th.
8183000	8185000	VG Realness in Chat says,
8185000	8189000	LOL, I don't mean to sound like a bitch, but love you Rob.
8189000	8193000	Well, look, I'm just calling it like it is.
8193000	8197000	We all read this story about the culling and rolled our collective eyes.
8197000	8199000	Like it's just, it's not a good idea.
8199000	8203000	And I'm just, I'm trying to be as nice as possible about it.
8203000	8206000	But sometimes you have to show a little tough love.
8206000	8208000	Okay.
8208000	8211000	It's just, it's such a crowded space nowadays.
8211000	8215000	There's so many like light podcasting.
8215000	8218000	Remember when there were only like 15 gaming podcasts on iTunes?
8218000	8222000	Remember you've got like fricking call of duty in that space.
8222000	8226000	Now you've got, you know, not Overwatch, you've got, um,
8226000	8229000	Fortnite and you've got, um,
8229000	8232000	I would say things like Overwatch.
8232000	8234000	And I mean, I know they're not one versus a hundred.
8234000	8235000	I would still say they take,
8235000	8237000	they take the player base and those types of games.
8237000	8241000	Yeah. I mean, you've, you've got a lot of people competing in that space
8241000	8243000	and I'm sorry, but like if your game,
8243000	8247000	you're coming off a game that was just hot garbage and no one was playing it.
8247000	8250000	And now you're bringing back the old game and all you're doing is putting a
8250000	8252000	really stupid payment model on it.
8252000	8254000	I don't think anyone cares.
8254000	8257000	No one's going to come back now to be fair.
8257000	8261000	And the only credit I'm ever giving them on this is just that the eight ninety
8261000	8265000	nine that you have to pay for the game or whatever is only if you didn't know
8265000	8266000	in the original.
8266000	8270000	But still, it's just it's a stupid payment model.
8270000	8271000	I mean, you're going to,
8271000	8274000	you're going to have people trying that out once a day or whatever.
8274000	8279000	And you and granted, you could possibly earn additional credits if you come in
8279000	8281000	first with these shit.
8281000	8287000	So if you actually play a game and you find out,
8287000	8290000	hey, look, there's no one online playing this.
8290000	8293000	I mean, what's to say? Like if you get disconnected because their servers are
8293000	8296000	trash, what's to say that there's no one in the game?
8296000	8299000	I mean, I just have a feeling that people are going to check it out and they're
8299000	8302000	like, nope, I'm gonna go play something else or they're just not even going to
8302000	8304000	give it any time of day. And it's just gonna be dead.
8304000	8307000	It's just gonna be dead extremely quickly.
8307000	8312000	They're happy to backtrack or do something different.
8312000	8315000	All right. Well, do we have any last minute stories?
8315000	8319000	OK. Or Jamie, if either of you have any last minute stories.
8319000	8322000	I don't really have anything last minute.
8322000	8327000	Things kind of go a little bit back and forth, don't they?
8327000	8330000	Well, I was didn't really have a last minute story,
8330000	8333000	but this was brought to my attention just before I started the show.
8333000	8339000	So I was watching one of my game dev YouTubers and stuff talking about game jams and stuff like that.
8339000	8344000	So there's one of the things that was sponsored by that video is this thing called core,
8344000	8348000	which is this like a platform that you can build games.
8348000	8351000	And then there's like a dozen or dozens of them out there.
8351000	8359000	This one, though, I'm not it's built off of the unreal engine and all the art assets look like it's straight out of Fortnite.
8359000	8364000	I mean, it's very similar character models and very similar art assets and stuff.
8364000	8369000	But it's kind of cool, though, because they have that where you can cater to actually building multiplayer games and everything.
8369000	8376000	And it looks pretty smooth. So something I was thinking about checking out just to kind of see if my kids want to play there or something like that.
8376000	8380000	But I've heard that this like asset dumping thing is a problem, though.
8380000	8387000	Like didn't do we have a story on it last week or did I just I just read it somewhere about how like on the Nintendo Switch, people are like.
8387000	8390000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is not this is not like that.
8390000	8398000	So, OK, this is more of like this is a platform kind of think of like like a Roblox or something like that where you build stuff.
8398000	8401000	Oh, OK. OK. On that platform. Yeah.
8401000	8409000	And it's also since it's using the epic game engine or whatever or not epic games, unreal engine,
8409000	8414000	I'm starting to think maybe it's somehow affiliated with epic somehow.
8414000	8420000	I mean, the art assets look very similar. Like if you you saw a screenshot of this, you'd be like.
8420000	8426000	Is that Fortnite? Because it looks like Fortnite. So if you're interested in checking out, it's core games dot com.
8426000	8433000	And it's just you can create a free account and you play games that people made or make your own things or just play around with it and stuff like that.
8433000	8438000	Not really sure how they make money with it, but it looks neat. I don't know.
8438000	8444000	So, yeah, it's all basically like unreal engine. You can expand it with Lua or you don't want to program anything.
8444000	8450000	You can just I think they have I'm guessing maybe it's like blueprints or something, but it looked kind of cool.
8450000	8457000	You know, something mess around with. So that was something I was going to bring up because I know I will check it out.
8457000	8460000	I love the idea of using that as like a family bonding time thing. That's cool.
8460000	8463000	Well, yeah, because they like they want to like they always play.
8463000	8474000	Well, not Fortnite, but they've been playing a lot of roadblocks and doing stuff like that or playing Minecraft, skyblock and stuff like that.
8474000	8480000	So. But if they can make their own games, it's sort of like, you know, Fortnite or something like that.
8480000	8486000	I mean, the graphics look great. And I don't know exactly how it works and what you can build with it.
8486000	8491000	But like, I mean, it looks pretty. So there's at least that. All right.
8491000	8496000	Well, I think we're going to go ahead and wrap things up here at Orange Launch Radio for the night.
8496000	8498000	Thank you guys so much, though, for tuning in to our show.
8498000	8501000	If you like what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend about the show.
8501000	8504000	Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
8504000	8508000	And when the voices are but without the voices here to put out on the air, you know.
8508000	8511000	So we've got to get more people here to join our little family here.
8511000	8514000	Orange Launch Radio and the Voice of Geeks Network.
8514000	8517000	We put the fun and dysfunction. That's right.
8517000	8521000	So, again, thank you, everybody who did tune to turn out tonight.
8521000	8523000	We really appreciate a five star review.
8523000	8530000	Just a simple recommendation, a link to, you know, our show on whatever podcast platform you use.
8530000	8534000	iTunes, Spotify, Google Podcasts, whatever it is you're using.
8534000	8536000	Help us spread the word.
8536000	8542000	An auto host on iTunes. An auto host on Twitch goes an awful long way as well.
8542000	8545000	So we really appreciate those for those of you that auto host the Voice of Geeks Network.
8545000	8547000	Really, really appreciate that as well.
8547000	8549000	Quick plug for something I'm doing on the side.
8549000	8552000	We talked about this on Bobby's show a little bit, but I want to mention it here.
8552000	8556000	On my personal Twitch channel at Rob Roberts, on Wednesday night,
8556000	8560000	myself and my buddy Arya Snark from Shaking and Crying,
8560000	8563000	we are going to have a watch party of the Birdcage.
8563000	8565000	And you're all invited.
8565000	8568000	If you do want to watch the movie with it, like we can't broadcast the movie,
8568000	8570000	but we're using Twitch watch parties to do it.
8570000	8574000	So if you have an Amazon Prime account, you can watch the movie along with us.
8574000	8577000	Otherwise, if you have like a DVD copy or you have the movie another way,
8577000	8580000	we will say start the movie now.
8580000	8582000	We'll do that whole type of thing.
8582000	8587000	I have it on Apple TV myself, so maybe I'll do it with you.
8587000	8588000	Perfect. Perfect.
8588000	8591000	So yeah, if you want to watch along with technology, you can use Amazon Prime.
8591000	8595000	If you want to do it by hitting play at the same time, that's fine too.
8595000	8597000	Like if you're like a second out of sync, it's not going to be a big deal.
8597000	8599000	Come on. It's the Birdcage.
8599000	8602000	We're going to watch camp movies because that's what's fun.
8602000	8604000	Can you believe I've never seen it?
8604000	8605000	Oh my gosh.
8605000	8606000	Right?
8606000	8607000	Yeah. Well, you know what's funny?
8607000	8611000	We're starting to already plot out like if we have fun doing it and it goes as well.
8611000	8614000	So we think it's going to do and we turn this into a weekly thing.
8614000	8616000	We're plotting out what movies we want to do next.
8616000	8620000	And we're finding like there's stuff where like Victoria hasn't seen it.
8620000	8621000	And I'm like, girl.
8621000	8623000	And there's only anti meme is on your list.
8623000	8625000	There's I don't think it is yet.
8625000	8626000	But what was that?
8626000	8628000	Is that on prime?
8628000	8629000	Because I don't know.
8629000	8632000	Yeah, we're restricted to the meme should be required to watch.
8632000	8633000	I know. I know.
8633000	8638000	But like if Paris is burning was there, we'd be doing that in a heartbeat.
8638000	8640000	You know, there's just not everything is on Amazon Prime.
8640000	8645000	But and I said this, too, if it does well enough and we're like, you know,
8645000	8648000	maybe we need to do this for not just movies that are on Amazon Prime.
8648000	8653000	We will record podcast commentary tracks that you can use for.
8653000	8655000	And then we can do things like any name.
8655000	8656000	Paris is burning and things like that.
8656000	8658000	So we'll see, though. We'll see.
8658000	8660000	All right.
8660000	8665000	As you wonder, Matt says, here is the real question is sleepaway camp on it.
8665000	8667000	No. And I checked.
8667000	8669000	But there are some cheesy horror movies.
8669000	8672000	And the rotation on Prime is always changing.
8672000	8674000	So you never know. Anyway, you know what?
8674000	8679000	If you ever do a serious movie and I am so obsessed right now with Midsommar,
8679000	8681000	I would love to see you guys react to it.
8681000	8684000	But it would be really, really hard to do, I think, for a live stream.
8684000	8686000	I haven't seen that movie yet.
8686000	8689000	And I'm a little afraid because I've heard things.
8689000	8693000	Is the Nicolas Cage version of the Wicker Man on there?
8693000	8695000	Because that would be awesome.
8695000	8699000	I don't believe it is. Nifty 805 says showgirls, showgirls, showgirls.
8699000	8702000	We would be there in a heartbeat again if it was on Amazon.
8702000	8704000	You don't know shit.
8704000	8708000	But my favorite movie of all time is on Amazon Prime.
8708000	8711000	And so that will definitely be in the rotation in the next couple of weeks.
8711000	8714000	We'll leave it at that. Anyhow, let's wrap up the show.
8714000	8715000	I know what it is.
8715000	8718000	Enough about me. Let's talk to my other hosts and wrap things up.
8718000	8721000	So that'll count as my final thought because I give a nice big plug there.
8721000	8723000	So, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?
8723000	8730000	I was actually planning on doing a live tweet of me watching Hereditary for the first time
8730000	8731000	because I haven't seen it.
8731000	8733000	That is on Prime as well, I think.
8733000	8739000	Is it? I mean, I've got Prime, but I already bought it on Apple TV+.
8739000	8744000	So I did it when I watched Midsommar.
8744000	8747000	And of course, I've seen Midsommar now like a bunch of times since then
8747000	8750000	because it's like the best movie if I want to cry or something.
8750000	8757000	But I would love to have people there to see me kind of freak out a little bit
8757000	8761000	over really weird, mentally disturbing stuff.
8761000	8762000	Fun!
8762000	8763000	Alright.
8763000	8766000	Well, you know what I like. I play Silent Hill for fun.
8766000	8769000	I know. It was good to have you back tonight, Jamie.
8769000	8770000	It was good to be back.
8770000	8771000	Good. I'm glad to hear it.
8771000	8775000	And last, but certainly not least, Loki, what's your final thought tonight?
8775000	8782000	My final thought is, has Jamie seen the trailer for Medium yet? Or The Medium?
8782000	8783000	No.
8784000	8786000	You need to go watch the trailer for The Medium.
8786000	8791000	It's a new game that's coming out by the folks that did the Blair Witch project game on Xbox.
8791000	8798000	And it's a very Silent Hill-esque type game and it has music by Kiryamaoka in it.
8798000	8800000	You know what? I did hear of that.
8800000	8802000	Gosh, what's it on?
8802000	8805000	Xbox, but that means Windows 10 too.
8805000	8807000	Okay. Well then, yeah, I can do it here.
8807000	8809000	Okay, cool. Yeah, thanks for letting me know.
8809000	8810000	Alright.
8810000	8812000	Well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
8812000	8815000	Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting the show.

8822000	8823000	We're wishing you all the best.
8823000	8825000	I know it's just like crazy times.
8825000	8830000	I'm glad we could at least have these few hours together every Sunday night throughout all of it.
8830000	8831000	So, that's really all I've got.
8831000	8833000	We'll see you next time in seven days.
