22420	23420	your days.
23420	26160	This is just one piece of media in this week's news, stay tuned for the rest starting right
26160	33840	now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
33840	37320	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
37320	42760	where every gamer has a voice it is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number
42760	47920	821 of our show for May 24th of 2020.
47920	51600	Happy Memorial Day weekend by the way to everybody out there.
51600	56040	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joining you here from Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento,
56040	57040	California.
57040	60920	Sadly, with everything going on in the world as you guys know for the last few weeks I've
60920	65280	been by myself here in studio, but I am joined via Discord.
65280	67600	That's why you hear some of the shifting noises in the background because they're getting
67600	69480	set up by my co-hosts.
69480	72160	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
72160	73160	Hello.
73160	74160	Hello.
74160	76880	And also say hello to Techmaster Loki.
76880	77880	Hello.
77880	78880	Hello.
78880	80080	Now here's the thing.
80080	85160	So over the past few weeks that we've been doing this, you've only really been able to
85160	89880	hear their voices here as we're on Twitch, whereas we used to all record in the same
89880	91040	room.
91040	95240	But we've made a few changes because this has ended up being a more long term thing
95240	96720	than we might have thought originally.
96720	98880	And I have some good news everybody tonight.
98880	99880	Ta-da.
99880	104740	You can actually see my co-hosts as we are taping live here on Twitch.
104740	107120	So hello Loki and DarkSakura is actually on cam.
107120	108120	You look great.
108120	113440	Well, it costs a lot of money to look this good.
113440	117720	We should just say, duh.
117720	119240	How have you been DarkSakura?
119240	120800	How's your week been?
120800	127680	Oh, gosh, it's been, I've been off work all week for my bereavement leave.
127680	136000	It's been thought provoking, quiet, a lot of animal crossing, a lot of another thing
136000	139080	that arrived last night.
139080	140080	Which we'll get into.
140080	141080	Yes.
141080	142080	Touch on.
142080	143080	Yes.
143720	147840	It's been very, very touched by Dan, mostly.
147840	148840	And Loki, have you been?
148840	149840	Oh, sorry.
149840	150840	Go ahead.
150840	153040	I'm just saying that's really, definitely it.
153040	154040	Cool.
154040	155040	And Loki, how have you been?
155040	156040	Things going well for you?
156040	157360	Yeah, it's been fine.
157360	162980	I cleaned out the garage today and then playing Minecraft.
162980	166220	Looking at our chat room, because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at six
166220	171240	o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog
171240	173480	network right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
173480	177800	And you guys in chat seem to really be loving the fact that you can actually see everybody.
177800	181800	Pixel Pocket saying, yay, nice to see everyone together again.
181800	188080	Pod Culture is saying, Loki is like, shit, I can't sneak away and make bacon anymore.
188080	189920	I guess he could if he wanted to.
189920	196040	Fifth Dream Today says, I don't think I've seen Jamie talk.
196040	197040	I've seen her.
197040	200680	I've heard her talk, but not at the same time.
200680	201680	So there you go.
201680	202680	It's a first.
202680	203680	There you go.
203680	204680	I exist.
204680	205680	I'm a real person.
205680	208120	I'm not an A.I.
208120	212640	And in chat, I see that we get to see a view of looks like, yes, you get to see it because
212640	215400	I'm not using it.
215400	220400	So because it's too short and I can't it.
220400	223020	It does me no good when it's way, way down here.
223020	227440	My biggest problem is that I keep looking at the TV to see you guys and not the camera
227440	228820	where I'm supposed to be looking.
228820	232220	So this is a new thing for us, obviously.
232220	235940	At some point, I'm going to probably use the sidecar so I can have you guys on the iPad
235940	237820	down here and then it'll be like I'm looking at you guys.
237820	242420	But that will be a future improvement at a later date.
242420	245140	Anyway, so let's get into some gaming news.
245140	247780	The folks that are listening on the podcast feed, because of course, we love you guys
247780	251360	on the podcast feed as well, and it's free and you can listen on all your favorite podcasts
251360	255780	pushing platforms, iTunes, Google Podcasts, Spotify, whatever.
255780	257020	We're on all those things.
257020	261740	And I know many of you listen there and you're like, nothing's different for me, except some
261740	265200	of the audio levels, maybe as things are changing with the webcam, but hopefully everything
265200	266200	sounds good.
266200	270100	We're at a good level and yeah, let's get into some gaming discussion is what you're
270100	271100	here for.
271100	272900	Let's get into our kickoff topic for tonight.
272900	276460	Loki, I don't know if you want to cover this, but we have a big, we have a birthday in the
276460	277460	house.
277460	278460	Yeah.
278460	282440	Pac-Man is celebrating 40 years.
282440	284320	That's been a long time.
284320	287380	One of the biggest arcade games of all time as well.
287380	293880	Definitely famous for a lot of reasons, but yeah, it's 40 years old.
293880	299000	And to kind of commemorate that as well, they were announcing that of course they're doing
299000	306200	some sort of Pac-Man live studio, which allow you to play multiplayer and upload custom
306200	308840	maps that you can create for Pac-Man.
308840	314120	So it's almost like Pac-Man level editor.
314120	315320	It sounds awesome.
315320	317280	I'm so into that.
317280	321680	And there's, there's just like Pac-Man, they're kind of like licensing him out left and right.
321680	325000	It seems like, I mean, I know we don't get into a lot of that stuff on this show, but
325000	328740	I feel like there's like more toys and more like, like other like Pac-Man related things
328740	329740	out there.
329740	331000	Like it's the eighties all over again.
331000	332000	Yeah.
332000	335440	Well, I mean, like I said, if I was playing Minecraft this week, so the first thing that
335440	340040	you see advertisement for their marketplace is a little Pac-Man graphic because they have
340040	347840	an actual skin pack and like level thing that they've put together for Pac-Man as well.
347840	348840	That's that's cool.
348840	349840	I want to check that out.
349840	350840	Minecraft.
350840	351840	I bet that's fun.
351840	355040	And I'm sure all these people out there are making these fake Minecraft mazes, right?
355040	356760	But they're like creepers instead of ghosts.
356760	357760	I don't know.
357760	358760	Or can you put the ghosts in there?
358760	359760	That'd be kind of fun.
359760	366420	They, they, well, it's an add on pack, so you can basically change the you can change
366420	369560	some of the attributes for different things.
369560	370820	You can change how they look.
370820	372760	You can change how things act.
372760	376760	You can do all sorts of fun things with that.
376760	379740	Now going to our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.
379740	382480	Fifth dream today says Pac-Man maker sounds amazing.
382480	383480	OMG.
383480	385720	There was so much Pac-Man merch when it came out.
385720	387680	It was like a giant fucking thing.
387680	388860	Oh, absolutely.
388860	390920	And I don't I don't know how much you guys remember.
390920	393440	Like Loki, I know you're just under 40 years old.
393440	396280	Dark Soccer and I were in our forties, but not not that far into it.
396280	402320	Like we were, we were toddlers when Pac-Man was brand new, but I know in the early eighties,
402320	406040	I mean, probably not right when Pac-Man first came out, it probably took a few years, but
406040	411680	I remember being about four or five years old, so this would have been like 83 or 84
411680	415640	and Pac-Man really was like everywhere in pop culture.
415640	419120	I don't do you have, do you have memories of like Pac-Man in the eighties, Dark Soccer?
419120	420120	I know I do.
420120	425960	Some of the memories that I have, and we actually still have a little Pac-Man plushie that's
425960	432040	got the ghost in his mouth, but I remember I was pretty good on roller skates of playing
432040	438640	Pac-Man because my place I would skate at, oh let me move this away, it had Frogger and
438640	444320	Pac-Man and a couple other games.
444320	452660	I remember being creeped out by the 2600 version and rightly so because it's terra bad.
452660	458220	I really though, out of all of the Pac-Man games, I got the most excited when Super Pac-Man
458220	459220	came out.
459220	464300	That was kind of my jam and I loved the cartoon.
464300	466780	I watched the cartoon religiously.
466780	468460	I remember the cartoon as well.
468460	473180	Like that was, that was a big, big thing when it was first out.
473180	478380	And there was, yeah, that was really, I thought it was kind of weird and then of course they
478380	483220	based Pac-Land kind of off of it, or the two were based off of each other.
483220	490140	I don't remember the exact order, but it was just, it was really all over the place.
490140	492900	And then there was of course Pac-Man Fever, who was that?
492900	493900	Was that Rick Dees?
493900	494900	Yes.
494900	495900	No, Garcia and Bunkner.
495900	499420	I don't know why I thought Rick Dees.
499420	503860	Oh, I'm such a jerk for not knowing the name off the top of my head because one of them
503860	504980	died like a few years ago.
504980	506780	I remember that was on the show.
506780	510500	Bunkner and Garcia, something like that.
510500	511500	Yeah.
511500	512500	Yeah.
512500	513500	They're kidding.
513500	514780	I'm looking at our chat.
514780	516580	I also see it in Garcia.
516580	517580	That was it.
517580	518580	Yeah.
518580	519580	Yeah.
519580	520580	Um, I see in chat and this is worth talking about.
520580	521580	We talked about Pac-Man.
521580	525580	Uh, they're talking about the Atari 2,600 version of Pac-Man because that was, you know, there
525580	530460	was this whole thing about, uh, how like the Atari 2,600 version of Pac-Man was really,
530460	531500	really bad.
531500	534700	And Oh, by the way, guys, I have another little trick this week.
534700	540820	I've been working hard on this long distance OLR thing because there, Oh no, I got, I got
540820	541820	bamboozled.
541820	542820	I thought I had the thing.
542820	543820	All right.
543820	546940	I was, thought I was so cool and had the window up and ready to go, but I guess it didn't
546940	547940	work that way.
547940	550060	I was supposed to be able to show the window.
550060	551060	Oh, well.
551060	554180	Um, now I want to know why that isn't working.
554180	555180	All right.
555180	556180	Anyway.
556180	563460	Um, but, uh, we actually have Pac-Man on the Atari 2,600 and, um, it was really like as
563460	567340	bad as it was, it was kind of technologically impressive.
567340	571180	Uh, and, uh, Bobby Blackwell was saying some things in chat about it.
571180	573560	Pac-Man on Atari played badly, but it was a miracle.
573560	574560	It worked at all.
574560	575900	The coder was a genius.
575900	579220	I read a whole deep dive on the Atari 2,600 Pac-Man source code.
579220	583780	It was pretty much the most complex 2,600 game made during the early eighties.
583780	589820	Um, tiger call on chat says, and in a rush, yeah, it was, it was made pretty quick.
589820	594220	If I remember right too.
594220	595220	So yeah.
595220	597480	Um, there we go.
597480	603200	I'm trying to see why I can't, now I'm irritated that my, my other little fancy thing doesn't
603200	604200	work right.
604200	605200	What does it show?
605200	606260	It was showing me the Twitch window.
606260	608260	Let's try this.
608260	609260	I'm doing it live.
609260	610260	Why not?
610260	611260	There we go.
611260	612260	How about that?
612260	616500	So there, there's your, uh, Pac-Man on the Atari 2,600 and it was pretty impressive how,
616500	618900	I mean, it doesn't look right at all.
618900	625900	Like Pac-Man looks funky in this whole thing and he eats like a wafer instead of the fruit.
625900	628820	Like it just, it doesn't quite work right.
628820	632020	But I mean, again, it's Catholic Pac-Man doing penance.
632020	633980	It's technologically very impressive.
633980	636700	He's, he's eating communion wafers.
636700	637700	Yeah.
637700	638700	So, all right.
638700	641860	Apparently that did something to my audio, so I guess I won't be doing that again anytime
641860	642860	soon.
642860	643860	Sorry guys.
643860	644860	I don't know what happened with that.
644860	645860	So, all right.
645860	646860	Sorry guys.
646860	647860	There's magic.
647860	649780	I'm, I'm trying some new things tonight.
649780	650780	What can I say?
650780	651780	All right.
651780	656900	Uh, anyhow, so, um, other things, other like memories with Pac-Man, anything, Loki, what
656900	657900	about you?
657900	660820	I know, you know, again, you're a little younger, but Pac-Man was everywhere when you were a
660820	661820	kid.
661820	662820	Right?
662820	663820	Right.
663820	671060	So basically, I don't remember too many, I remember playing the Atari 2,600 version as
671060	672060	well.
672060	674300	Um, I know I had Pac-Man bedsheets.
674300	677440	You had Pac-Man bedsheets?
677440	678440	I did.
678440	680720	I do remember those.
680720	686920	Um, so yeah, um, that's as far as I remember because we had a ColecoVision with the Atari
686920	690440	adapter for it so you could play the 2,600 games on there.
690440	696440	And that's how I used to play the, uh, Pac, uh, for the 2,600.
696440	698840	Um, that's all I knew.
698840	701320	And I was like, eh, this is fine, this is Pac-Man.
701320	703840	I didn't know that it was jank.
703840	704840	That's true.
704840	709200	When I was really young, like the Atari 2,600 version of Pac-Man didn't really bother me
709200	712600	because it was still like, Ooh, it's like the maze game on my TV.
712600	717760	And you kind of knew that all the video games were a little bit messy back in the day.
717760	718760	Yeah.
718760	723240	It's like, you never like, I mean, you just think it's different except for E.T.
723240	727480	Of course, E.T. was garbage and it's like, that's like, I love E.T.
727480	728480	Why don't I?
728480	729480	This game is horrible.
729480	730480	I can't get out of this pit.
731120	733600	I remember playing a lot of kangaroo.
733600	738080	Uh, was kangaroo a better translation of the arcade game?
738080	739080	Yeah.
739080	740080	Yeah, it was.
740080	741080	Yeah.
741080	742080	Fair enough.
742080	743080	Fair enough.
743080	745080	Um, so I mean, where, where does Pac-Man go from here?
745080	750320	So we have Pac-Man maker is coming out and what other, what are, are there any, does
750320	751920	Pac-Man need to show up in any other games?
751920	753560	I feel like he's been in everything.
753560	760440	He's been in Smash Brothers, uh, the championship edition was an amazing, um, in the arcade.
761400	767000	He was in the arcade Mario Kart, because, uh, that was the whole Namco, uh, Alliance
767000	768000	thing.
768000	769000	Yeah.
769000	770000	And F-Zero, right, Rob?
770000	771000	Mmm.
771000	772000	I don't think Pac-Man was in F-Zero.
772000	773000	It was definitely Mario Kart.
773000	774000	Sorry, I am thinking of Mario Kart.
774000	775000	Nevermind.
775000	777600	You're thinking of the Mario Kart arcade because it was a very similar hardware to
777600	780000	what F-Zero ran on and that whole thing.
780000	783680	Uh, fifth dream today in chat suggests Pac-Man and Persona 5.
783680	786560	No, I guess anything's possible, right?
787560	790840	I need the Pac-Man cinematic universe now.
790840	792800	The Namco cinematic universe.
792800	796880	Let me ask one more question on this topic for our chat room, as well as my co-hosts
796880	799160	and on Pac-Man and all this.
799160	805120	And that would be, why do you think of all these eighties games we had, for example,
805120	810000	Dark Sakura brought up Kangaroo was a pretty great translation, but Kangaroo didn't exactly
810000	814880	break through the same way with all the merchandise, with all the songs and everything that Pac-Man
814880	815880	did.
816200	820280	Did Pac-Man last in the cultural icon for this long, do you think?
820280	823880	Pac-Man had the novelty of being out before all of those, number one.
823880	824880	Fair.
824880	829000	It was also one of the, um, you know, keep in mind for a long time after we had all of
829000	833080	our Pong clones, the big thing was the shooter games.
833080	836080	Like that was when Galaxian, you know, was a thing.
836080	840760	And then having this new maze game was, well, it was something different and something new.
840760	843160	And it spawned how many clones of it?
843160	847000	I mean, we had KC, KC Crazy Chase.
847000	854440	We had, uh, Mouse Trap, which I have on Cliccovision and honestly, it's more fun.
854440	859520	Um, there, there's all kinds of games are really crazy auto, you know, was supposed
859520	864120	to be an improvement on Pac-Man and it was such an improvement that it became Ms. Pac-Man.
864120	870040	So I mean, and on top of that, it's a game that practically anyone can get up and just
870040	871560	start playing.
871560	876240	Kangaroo as an example, since we were using that one, it had a little bit more complexity
876240	877240	to playing it.
877240	881280	It required a lot more, well, a lot different kind of timing.
881280	885040	Pac-Man is just, you don't even need to hit a freaking button.
885040	887040	You just move the joystick.
887040	891120	I think that's an actually, that's actually a really great point, Jamie, because I think
891120	897100	it's that ease of like how to explain it and how to jump into it that makes it so easy.
897100	902060	And I think a lot of games, um, before we got to the cell phone game era, and even in
902060	906780	the cell phone game era in many ways, um, things like Tetris, things like Pac-Man and
906780	911960	those really easy to grasp games really caught on because you're right.
911960	913700	It's like, it's, it's very intuitive.
913700	918260	Oh, I, I'm this guy and I dodged this guy and I eat these, like, it's very, very easy.
918260	920260	You know what I mean?
920260	925360	Um, and then in the cell phone era, I think a lot of cell phone games have done very well
925360	927120	because it's just swiping.
927120	928120	It's just touching.
928120	932900	Uh, Wii Sports did very well because it's like, you play like it's actually a tennis
932900	935520	racket and you swing it like it's a tennis racket.
935520	937560	There's no complicated buttons or anything like that.
937560	940320	Like that stuff does go a long way.
940320	943800	You know, if you try to teach somebody, I don't want to say a non-gamer cause I feel
943800	947620	like in this day and age, everybody's a gamer a little bit, but like if you try to teach
947620	952480	somebody who doesn't play a lot of games, how to play something on Xbox One or PlayStation
952480	956320	4, it's like, Oh my, how many triggers do I, how do I, how do I hold this?
956320	957320	Right?
957320	959880	Like it, it isn't the easiest thing to explain sometimes.
959880	965520	I mean, again, I think as we get into different generations and you know, as, as gen X is
965520	968620	getting older and all this stuff, it's like, we all kind of grew up on games, so I don't
968620	971120	think it's quite the same struggle, but it's there a little bit.
971120	974560	Well, and if you take people who go, well, I'm not really a gamer.
974560	975960	I was like, do you like playing Pac-Man?
975960	978120	Oh yeah, I was playing it just the other day.
978120	979120	Even you're a gamer.
979120	980120	Sorry.
980120	981120	Hate to break it to you.
981120	982120	You're not cool.
982760	983760	Are you a gamer?
983760	984760	Oh no, not really.
984760	985760	Well, do you play Tetris?
985760	986760	Yeah.
986760	987760	Or do you play Pokemon go?
987760	988760	Yeah.
988760	989760	Well guess what?
989760	990760	Those are games.
990760	991760	It's you a gamer.
991760	992760	That's right.
992760	993760	Do you play words with friends?
993760	994760	Guess what?
994760	995760	That's a game.
995760	1000680	Uh, Mel Chan 13 in chat says Pac-Man is simple to learn and it got hard, but a lot of people
1000680	1004840	could progress decently enough to not just get discouraged.
1004840	1008620	I think that's an important point too, is that, you know, it's pretty easy to clear
1008620	1010160	the first board in Pac-Man.
1010200	1013840	I mean, granted the dip switches on the arcade machine and things, you know, you could set
1013840	1016600	all these different crazy difficulty levels and things of that sort.
1016600	1020200	So, you know, maybe some machines are harder than others, but it's relatively easy to clear
1020200	1021880	the first board in Pac-Man.
1021880	1026080	It does not get so easy to clear, like even the second board, I don't know, just depends
1026080	1027080	on how much you play.
1027080	1029920	And he's especially like, he's getting a third, fourth board, and then you start to watch
1029920	1032480	these people to do these crazy, perfect long runs.
1032480	1034440	It's like the game does get very hard.
1034440	1036280	It has a pattern though.
1036960	1042560	And it's like people who've played it, think, here's another relation on this one.
1042560	1047160	The dude who won all those games on Press Your Luck, he memorized the pattern.
1047160	1051160	That's what a lot of the gamers that are getting those high scores on Pac-Man are doing, is
1051160	1055560	that they are memorizing the patterns and know when the patterns switch.
1055560	1058600	And it's easy for them because they're just repeating the pattern, they're playing it
1058600	1060440	exactly the same way.
1060440	1068040	Like another thing, playing that, the dragon, doing the dragon fight in Mega Man 2 blindfolded
1068040	1069240	that it used to be able to do.
1069240	1072320	I was just going to say, patterns are huge in video games.
1072320	1073320	Look at Mega Man.
1073320	1074460	Mega Man is the perfect example.
1074460	1077280	It's, Mega Man is patterns, period.
1077280	1081040	You have like almost no real RNG in something like Pac-Man.
1081040	1085680	It was all based on a pattern, based on your movement, and it was predictable because it
1085680	1088120	was early programming, you know?
1088120	1092920	So you followed your path, the ghosts would automatically follow their set path based
1092920	1093920	on where you were.
1093920	1097800	And as long as you knew where you had to be at one time, you knew what was going to happen.
1097800	1102880	Can we talk about one other thing with Pac-Man too, that I think you cannot talk about Pac-Man
1102880	1109840	turning 40 and not talk a little bit, at least, about Ms. Pac-Man, the extremely successful
1109840	1110840	sequel, right?
1110840	1111840	I brought it up.
1111840	1114200	Yeah, Pac-Man with a bow in the hair, right?
1114200	1115200	So yeah, you did.
1115200	1116200	I want to dive a little deeper.
1116200	1117200	There was more than that.
1117280	1118280	Of course, yeah.
1118280	1119280	Of course, there's more to it than that.
1119280	1122200	You actually had multiple mazes and things of that sort.
1122200	1123200	More than that.
1123200	1126840	Well, I was just about to ask why, because I think for some people, Ms. Pac-Man probably
1126840	1128320	caught on even more.
1128320	1133060	And I was going to suggest it was those cut scenes, those very simple little cut scenes
1133060	1135340	you get when you, like every other board, right?
1135340	1138780	Like the chase, it goes to act one, the chase and they chase each other.
1138780	1140200	Like that was so cool.
1140200	1144320	And you didn't see that in games, but that was essentially like the first cut scene in
1144320	1145720	the game in a way.
1146240	1156240	Well, it was originally Crazy Otto, which Crazy Otto was, it was supposed to be like
1156240	1159480	a spiritual successor to Pac-Man.
1159480	1169600	I actually attended a, what about the word I'm thinking of, a panel about Crazy Otto.
1169600	1174160	And they've even recreated the original Crazy Otto based on just viewing the animations.
1174160	1181360	And it actually had much more in the way of animation and graphic, what was the word
1181360	1183280	I'm thinking of, different sprites.
1183280	1187840	It had more sprites in general than I think Ms. Pac-Man had running.
1187840	1194840	But at the very beginning of it, it was an enhancement kit for Pac-Man that was called
1194840	1196920	Crazy Otto.
1196920	1207920	And it was being developed and there was a big, hold on, it was General Computer Corporation
1207920	1212540	that was involved in a lawsuit with Atari because they also did a missile command conversion
1212540	1214880	called Super Missile Attack.
1214880	1223140	And they were banned from doing future conversions without the consent of Atari or Namco.
1223140	1232100	So what they did is that they actually presented their game to Midway, who distributed for
1232100	1236380	Namco in the US and, well, at least for Pac-Man.
1236380	1242580	And they were really actually enthusiastic about having it.
1242580	1245140	And so they all, they bought the rights to it.
1245140	1250880	They worked with GCC and with Namco to get the game ready for development.
1250880	1253800	They changed a few different things.
1253800	1259240	And of course the cut scenes were already in Crazy Otto.
1259240	1265020	And so all that they did was convert those cut scenes because it had to do with Crazy
1265020	1269000	Otto and his girlfriend or something.
1269000	1274360	And they were going to rename it to Pac-Woman and then they changed it to Ms. Pac-Man and
1274360	1277880	then they made her the main character.
1277880	1282240	And originally this was supposed to be called Super Pac-Man.
1282240	1287140	And on top of that, all of those changes happened within 72 hours of production.
1287140	1289840	I knew that it had started as Crazy Otto.
1289840	1293280	I knew that part, but I didn't realize that they got as far as doing the cut scenes with
1293280	1297960	like Crazy Otto and they were that far along when they decided to change it and do everything
1297960	1298960	as Ms. Pac-Man.
1298960	1299960	That's pretty cool.
1299960	1304560	And one of the other things that they did create as Ms. Pac-Man is because more women
1304560	1309640	in general were playing Pac-Man that they could see, at least through all the polling
1309640	1313440	and whatever they did to gather the data on it.
1313440	1317080	And so that was another factor in changing the lead character to female.
1317080	1318080	Yeah.
1318080	1323460	And I was going to ask, was part of the reason why Ms. Pac-Man was also such a large game
1323460	1327680	was maybe that sense that, I don't want to say it catered towards women, but it definitely
1327680	1328760	empowered women.
1328760	1333200	And if you guys think in this day and age, in the year 2020, women get a lot of crap
1333200	1334600	like, oh, women don't play games.
1334600	1338960	I mean, I like to think that's less in this day and age, although I am not a woman, so
1338960	1341360	I don't get the brunt of that.
1341360	1347200	But I mean, in the eighties, it was really like, oh, women don't play video games, but
1347200	1353600	like Ms. Pac-Man kind of was like, but women are the star of video games.
1353600	1360200	I kind of, there was one reason why I didn't mind that stereotype and I'll tell you why.
1360200	1361200	Money.
1362200	1363200	How so?
1364200	1367200	Um, you know, like people hustle for pool.
1368200	1371200	I have a little bit of a habit of hustling in video games.
1371200	1375200	Oh, this goes back to your, your reign on Tekken back in the day of the arcade.
1375200	1377200	No, this goes way before my reign on Tekken.
1377200	1378200	Really?
1378200	1380200	I did that just to create a point.
1380200	1381200	Um, I don't know.
1381200	1386200	I would, I would, uh, hustle for lunch money.
1386200	1388200	You'd whoop the boy's ass at Pac-Man for money?
1388200	1389200	Lunch money?
1389200	1394200	Well, Pac-Man, a few other games, it was like just net stuff or a game boy stuff.
1394200	1395200	I love it.
1395200	1401200	Um, you know, I, I, Tetris was kind of my big one for that one, but I could also do
1401200	1405200	a rate like we would have like little mini races and things, you know, it didn't last
1405200	1406200	very long.
1406200	1410200	Cause once it got out that, yeah, I could actually play stuff and that ended it's like
1410200	1411200	a month.
1411200	1415200	And I think it's also important to note, uh, if we're talking about Ms. Pac-Man, the Atari
1415200	1419200	2600 version of Ms. Pac-Man is much better.
1419200	1420200	Right?
1420200	1421200	Yeah.
1421200	1422200	Is much better.
1422200	1426200	And I think it's because they had more space to develop with it.
1426200	1430200	Like they had an eight kilobyte cartridge as opposed to a four kilobyte cartridge.
1430200	1433200	So the ghost draw was able to work a little better.
1433200	1437200	It actually looked a little like Ms. Pac-Man looked a little better just overall.
1437200	1441200	It was a better translation, but I don't think as many people played Ms. Pac-Man on Atari
1441200	1442200	2600.
1443200	1449200	Actually about the Atari 2600 version in 1984, it won video game of the video game of the
1449200	1450200	year award.
1450200	1451200	Oh wow.
1451200	1457200	And well for Atari 2600 and in 83, it tied for the arcade awards with ladybug.
1457200	1458200	Huh?
1458200	1459200	Interesting.
1459200	1461200	Just saying people were playing it.
1461200	1463200	People were significantly playing it.
1463200	1469200	I would, I would just see people when I was, you know, again, I was really young, but as
1470200	1474200	little older than you and I would see people crowding around it at the, at, you know, what
1474200	1480200	the arcade Aladdin's castle back in the day was my arcade with its carpeted ass walls.
1480200	1485200	I have gotten carpet burn on my arm from running into those walls.
1485200	1486200	Just saying.
1486200	1491200	Um, I remember playing Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, especially Ms. Pac-Man on the cocktail machine
1491200	1492200	at the yogurt shop.
1492200	1496200	I remember that totally because they had that machine forever, but like a little more of
1496200	1499200	my arcade memory, excuse me, a little more of my arcade memory.
1499200	1503200	Like I actually remember playing things like the star Wars cabinet that you actually would
1503200	1504200	get inside.
1504200	1507200	Uh, and, um, there was that, that was a bad-ass machine.
1507200	1509200	Uh, the star Wars went crystal castle.
1509200	1510200	So it was an early favorite of mine too.
1510200	1511200	Yeah.
1511200	1515200	So, but obviously there was plenty of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man cause those machines were
1515200	1516200	everywhere.
1516200	1517200	Right.
1517200	1518200	Yeah.
1518200	1519200	All right.
1519200	1521200	Uh, one of the thing, one of the thing is I love this comment from chat cause I want
1521200	1522200	to bring this up too.
1522200	1525200	And then we've got to move on and talk about our gaming weeks, but a vid powers five 73
1525200	1531200	and chat says Pac-Man's original name was indeed puck man, but they realized most kids
1531200	1534200	would probably change the P to an F. Yeah.
1534200	1536200	I'm sure many of you have heard that before.
1536200	1538200	I know we all saw Scott Pilgrim too.
1538200	1539200	Yeah.
1539200	1540200	So the whole man.
1540200	1541200	Right.
1541200	1544200	Um, but, uh, yeah, it's kind of interesting how that did change.
1544200	1549200	So it is a little different here, uh, in the States than it is in Japan.
1549200	1554200	Um, but of course in Japan, I would say space invaders was more that arcade game that really,
1554200	1555200	really broke through.
1555200	1557200	Not to say it wasn't a big deal here.
1557200	1560200	It was, but I feel like Pac-Man was everywhere here.
1560200	1562200	Space invaders was everywhere there.
1562200	1565200	So anyway, I don't know.
1565200	1570200	Cause I get, not to say like the other wasn't there at all, but I just feel like, you know,
1570200	1575200	we had the, we had the cartoon, we had the board game, we had like all this stuff with Pac-Man.
1575200	1577200	I'm not even sure they really had in Japan.
1577200	1579200	Whereas like space invaders was so fricking popular.
1579200	1580200	It was everywhere.
1580200	1584200	W weren't they like running low on coins because they were going into space invaders machine.
1584200	1586200	It was just kind of like a different, like cultural thing.
1586200	1587200	I think.
1587200	1596200	I want to say it was, uh, yeah, they had to admit like more, um, more yen, I think more
1596200	1597200	yen coins because of that.
1597200	1600200	But I want to say, I don't know if it was space invaders.
1600200	1602200	It might've been space invaders that did it.
1602200	1604200	I'd have to look up my trivia again.
1604200	1605200	Yeah.
1605200	1606200	All right.
1606200	1608200	Well anyway, let's get into a little more current gaming.
1608200	1609200	Happy birthday Pac-Man.
1609200	1613200	But, uh, let's talk about some more current video games that we have been playing as we
1613200	1617200	talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this
1617200	1618200	week.
1618200	1619200	So, uh, dark soccer, we'll start with you.
1619200	1621200	How was your gaming week?
1621200	1626200	Um, it was mostly animal crossing all up until a certain thing arrived on our doorstep on
1626200	1627200	yesterday.
1627200	1629200	And what's that?
1629200	1632200	A turbo graphics 16 mini.
1632200	1635200	So yeah, uh, everybody started getting those this weekend.
1636200	1639200	Mine came in on Friday, uh, and then yours came in Saturday.
1639200	1640200	Right.
1640200	1643200	And then I know Bobby Black Wolf got his, one of those days too, because he was doing
1643200	1644200	a stream.
1644200	1647200	So I feel like a lot of those who like pre-ordered that started getting them this weekend.
1647200	1651200	So the shipping date kind of changed a little bit on that, but that's good.
1651200	1652200	Yeah.
1652200	1657200	Needless to say, Dan has been playing the super graphics version of, uh, uh, ghosts
1657200	1658200	and goblins.
1658200	1663200	Like I woke up and he was still playing it and he actually did the full cycle of it with
1663200	1668200	a little assistance, but he was, he was working up a storm playing it.
1668200	1674200	Um, anyway, though, uh, we also did get in a little bit of, uh, East just to listen to
1674200	1678200	the music, you know, cause the intro to East was so beautiful.
1678200	1683200	Um, and then, um, and it's not wise, it's East.
1683200	1684200	Anyway.
1684200	1687200	Um, we, yeah, no.
1688200	1693200	Um, uh, yeah, she says, Dan, ghosts and goblins.
1693200	1694200	No.
1694200	1695200	Anyway.
1695200	1703200	Um, we also, um, got a little bit in of Lords of Thunder and, um, trying to think what else
1703200	1708200	cause, uh, Oh, um, Star Parodia, which makes me ridiculously happy that that game was on
1708200	1709200	there.
1709200	1710200	Cause I freaking love Star Parodia.
1710200	1712200	Um, Star Soldier is on there too.
1712200	1716200	Um, trying to think what else we touched on.
1716200	1722200	Um, I was going to ask because, you know, I, I didn't really ever import games until
1722200	1727200	I discovered Dance Dance Revolution and met you guys and, you know, kind of got like introduced
1727200	1730200	to like, Oh yes, you can buy games from Japan over here.
1730200	1733200	It's just very expensive and all this, but you were the one that really introduced me
1733200	1738200	to, cause you know, the turbo graphics, it was out here, but obviously it was the PC
1738200	1741200	engine in Japan and you know, it's just very different.
1741200	1743200	Like they had all this different stuff and different games and all that.
1743200	1745200	And I got introduced to what?
1745200	1748200	There's a whole Castlevania game that never came out here.
1748200	1752200	That's, that's, that's on, you know, that was all because of you.
1752200	1753200	Yeah.
1753200	1757200	So I found out about a lot of these games because of our friendship.
1757200	1761200	And so I know you've been a turbo, you know, fan for years.
1761200	1767200	Is there anything on this device that you didn't own before that it's like, woo, who
1767200	1768200	I get to play this finally.
1768200	1769200	Yeah.
1769200	1773200	There's some things that we didn't own a couple of times because we actually, they would have
1773200	1775200	been too language intensive.
1775200	1780200	Some definitely prohibit prohibitively expensive.
1780200	1786200	We have, I'm not going to say my source, but like Sapphire, I mean, there you go right
1786200	1787200	there.
1787200	1793200	There was some of the arcade card games.
1793200	1799200	You know, we can't play, although we own them, but we, and then getting a super graphics
1799200	1805200	that damn near, Oh my gosh, it would have been way expensive, expensive to have that.
1805200	1809200	That's what, um, that's what, uh, ghouls and ghosts was on.
1809200	1810200	It's, it's a beautiful one.
1810200	1813200	Music's a little bit off and timing is kind of weird on the machine.
1813200	1818200	Um, and I remember what else we said we played was, uh, twin B, but it was more like a kind
1818200	1824200	of a weak little version of twin B. Um, but if you go to salamander and you tap on it
1824200	1827200	three times, it'll do twin B for you.
1827200	1832200	Um, which of course salamander, I mean, there's another fantastic game that we don't have
1832200	1833200	on a turbo.
1833200	1839200	Um, trying to think there was Keith courage, which we've got that everyone has that.
1839200	1845200	That was a packing game in the U S when it was, um, but blazing lasers by itself is just
1845200	1846200	an amazing game.
1846200	1851200	Well, so, so as somebody who's followed, you know, turbo PC engine, all this for, for so
1851200	1854200	long, um, how, how do you like the device?
1854200	1856200	Like, is it, is it worthy?
1856200	1858200	Oh yeah, it's great.
1858200	1863200	It's really good for people who, I mean, cause trying to get your hands on a turbo graphics
1863200	1865200	now, isn't super easy.
1865200	1868200	Getting your hands on the duo is even harder.
1868200	1873200	And then, um, just trying to think what else would be super graphics, like I said, would
1873200	1874200	be damn near impossible.
1874200	1876200	It only came out in Japan.
1876200	1882200	Um, I do have a friend who has a duo LT, the PC engine duo LT it's like the laptop version
1882200	1883200	of it.
1883200	1887200	Um, the same friend also left one of his in a movie theater.
1887200	1889200	And we, we all know who this person is.
1889200	1891200	I'm not going to say his name online.
1891200	1894200	I'll tell you afterwards, but we all know him.
1894200	1895200	Okay.
1895200	1903200	Um, at any rate, um, PC engines, actually, I think that like a PC engine core is actually
1903200	1908200	a little easier to get your hands on than a, uh, a turbo graphics.
1908200	1914200	Um, one of the things though, is that what really goes for bucks, depending on, you know,
1914200	1917200	which one you've got are going to be those conversion cartridges.
1917200	1919200	Um, like everyone wants the purple one.
1919200	1924200	The purple one has the best, uh, well, the best support for multiple games.
1924200	1930200	Um, and it was the converter to have, if you wanted to say, if you only had a U S turbo
1930200	1937200	duo, but you had, um, super CD games, like, uh, for, for instance, uh, we have, uh, fatal
1937200	1943200	fury and we have a Strider, uh, but they are super CD only and require the arcade card
1943200	1948200	to play the turbo duo in the U S had built into it.
1948200	1954200	The first two arcade cards, but you needed the, the, uh, not, not arcade cards, but just
1954200	1957200	the two, uh, extra cards that came with them.
1957200	1960200	And the final one was the arcade card that you need for your super CD games.
1960200	1966200	Um, so of course we can play all bunch of Japanese games on our, on our, uh, U S duo,
1966200	1969200	but we couldn't play our super CD games.
1969200	1972200	So arcade cards still go for bucks.
1972200	1978200	Um, there's also, there was that PC engine emulator, but you have to magic engine, but
1978200	1979200	you have to pay for it.
1979200	1986200	Um, I'm going way off topic, but just to say that the, the turbo graphics stuff is gonna
1986200	1988200	be a little bit harder to find.
1988200	1995200	I will tell people though, you can probably get a duo RX, which is one of the re-released
1995200	1998200	PC engine duos as a, as a whole set.
1998200	2001200	Um, about 200 to 250.
2001200	2008200	So not, not too prohibitive, but this is a, this is a like pretty cost effective way to
2008200	2012200	get your foot in the door with turbo graphics because like I remember like my friend had
2012200	2015200	one growing up, so I remember playing it at his house.
2015200	2019200	I never had one, but there's so many of these games I feel like I missed out on.
2019200	2024200	So like, I feel like me owning this is kind of part to catch up on like this little tiny
2024200	2027200	little era of gaming that I just like missed completely.
2027200	2029200	And so that's why I was worth it.
2029200	2030200	Yeah.
2030200	2032200	So like for the a hundred bucks, as opposed to all these collectors and things.
2032200	2033200	Yeah.
2033200	2034200	I feel like it's a, it's a steal.
2034200	2037200	What are they going to do when they hack them?
2037200	2040200	Uh, yeah, that's a very interesting question, right?
2040200	2045200	Cause obviously like the, the idiot question that's about to fall out of my mouth is you
2045200	2046200	think they're going to hack them?
2046200	2047200	That's an idiot question.
2047200	2050200	I know I'm saying it's an idiot question.
2050200	2052200	Of course the hackers going to hack, right?
2052200	2054200	So it's just a matter of time.
2054200	2055200	You're right.
2055200	2056200	I don't, I don't know.
2056200	2057200	I don't know what I'll do when they hack them.
2057200	2063200	I guess one of, one of our most quoted games, misquoted games, a psychic storm where whenever
2063200	2068200	they power up, they say psychic storm, but it used to sound like I get pissed off.
2068200	2074200	And so we would just say that anytime we power up, I get pissed off, but it's got Sapphire.
2074200	2078200	I mean, having Sapphire on there is reason enough.
2078200	2083200	That game is like, you know, I'm going to look and look it up and see how much it is
2083200	2084200	while y'all chat about it.
2084200	2086200	Cause Sapphire ain't cheap.
2086200	2089200	Well, I think I've covered it for classic game.
2089200	2092200	I was just saying, I don't know if there's a lot left cause Loki, you, you didn't buy
2092200	2094200	one of these yet, right?
2094200	2095200	No, no.
2095200	2099200	And I did buy one, but I haven't played it yet.
2099200	2102200	And I'll talk about why, but it's like on my list of things to do tomorrow with tomorrow
2102200	2106200	being a holiday where we can't really go out and have a barbecue or anything.
2106200	2108200	It's on my list of things to do tomorrow.
2108200	2110200	So, um, Oh, go ahead.
2110200	2111200	Crazy.
2111200	2115200	Um, one seller on, on eBay has it for $94.
2115200	2117200	Another one has it for 1500.
2117200	2118200	Oh my God.
2118200	2120200	Another one, 1530.
2120200	2122200	Um, wow.
2122200	2124200	No, no, no.
2124200	2125200	Okay.
2125200	2126200	That's a 500 and one everdrive.
2126200	2127200	We've got an everdrive.
2127200	2128200	The arcade card.
2128200	2133200	Like I was talking about, Rob, play Asia Silvers for 400 bucks.
2133200	2134200	Wow.
2134200	2135200	No, thank you.
2135200	2142200	That's the arcade card pro the arcade card duo is 110 and just this one copy of Sapphire
2142200	2144200	out of the box is going for 1200.
2144200	2146200	It is ridiculous.
2146200	2149200	Let me, um, get this question in chat here or comment.
2149200	2154200	Phoenix 77 26 says, I wonder if the same sort of thing will happen with Xbox three sixties
2154200	2155200	in 20 years.
2155200	2156200	You know, that's a great question.
2156200	2160200	It's very easy to kind of say like, Oh yeah, there'll probably be many Xbox three sixties
2160200	2161200	and so forth.
2161200	2168200	But, and especially with that particular device, you see more and more of an inch towards these
2168200	2170200	subscription platforms, right?
2170200	2174200	Where you're going to pay a subscription fee and you know, Xbox game pass, right?
2174200	2176200	And you get a lot of the games through that.
2176200	2179200	Heck, even Nintendo is doing something like that now.
2179200	2183200	I mean, yes, they released the Nintendo mini and the super Nintendo mini, but they have
2183200	2184200	their subscription Nintendo online.
2184200	2186200	You get those libraries as well.
2187200	2194200	So it, I almost wonder if, uh, you're going to see more of the contemporary games, uh,
2194200	2196200	end up being on these subscription services.
2196200	2197200	I don't know.
2197200	2201200	Like, I don't know if there would end up being a market for something like an Xbox 360 mini,
2201200	2205200	but we're, we're, we've gotten about as far as the PlayStation, cause there was a PlayStation
2205200	2208200	mini for better or for worse, but it existed.
2208200	2209200	Right.
2209200	2211200	So, um, I, it's hard to say.
2211200	2212200	I agree with pod culture.
2212200	2213200	I want to Dreamcast mini.
2213200	2215200	Heck yes to that.
2215200	2216200	I'd be all about that.
2216200	2219200	I can totally see them double dipping though, because I mean, they did that already with
2219200	2222200	the Nintendo online with super Nintendo games and stuff.
2222200	2227200	I believe that's pretty much all the games that were on those two standalone mini devices.
2227200	2232200	There are some slight differences with third parties, but for the, but yes, for the most
2232200	2233200	part.
2233200	2238200	Well, to also piggyback on what SSJ 100 Matt says, he says, I kind of want a Saturn mini
2238200	2239200	as well.
2239200	2244200	I would want a Saturn if it had a lot more of the games that came out in Japan on it.
2244200	2249200	Like the great fighting games, like the, the X-Men versus, and you know, all of those
2249200	2255200	series, they were so good or, or their KOF games, the KOF games on Saturn were top notch.
2255200	2260200	There is no pain like playing a KOF game on Neo Geo CD.
2260200	2263200	It has loading time out in the ass.
2263200	2269200	I want to say that is one thing I do want to give massive kudos to Konami and you know,
2269200	2273200	the turbo look at me, I'm giving kudos to Konami on this show, but it's where it's deserved
2273200	2275200	because I think this device is well done.
2275200	2281200	And I think where the kudos is really deserved is the fact that, you know, it's very agnostic
2281200	2282200	on the regions.
2282200	2289200	You can flip to Japanese and you can play Japanese games, including things like snatcher,
2289200	2292200	which you're really not going to be able to play without an, unless you understand Japanese
2292200	2294200	without an FAQ or a walkthrough or something.
2294200	2297200	But I love that that option is there.
2297200	2300200	It does have different games though than in Japan.
2300200	2302200	The PC engine version.
2302200	2303200	True.
2303200	2307200	But the, but the fact that like the Japanese games are still even there in the American
2307200	2310200	release is pretty awesome.
2310200	2311200	I love that.
2311200	2313200	I would, I would really like a PC engine mini.
2313200	2319200	Just, um, I mean, and that's the reason why I wasn't all hyper about getting one is because
2319200	2325200	I'm not super hyper on, um, uh, Tokimeki Memorial.
2325200	2329200	And I know that that's one of the games and although Tokimeki had another hidden game
2329200	2331200	that you could access.
2331200	2332200	But man, snatcher.
2332200	2333200	Oh my gosh.
2333200	2340200	And you know, though, when they start doing the hacks and stuff on it, the, the, um, the
2340200	2345200	ROM hack snatcher is going to be out because there's a full translation of snatcher out
2345200	2346200	there.
2346200	2347200	Yeah, that's true.
2347200	2351200	It's probably because I was, I was going to say like, it is my, my one, if I wanted to
2351200	2355200	be that gamer that asked for everything, which most gamers do, I would say like, Hey man,
2355200	2359200	why didn't they just go back and translate snatcher as if there's infinite amount of
2359200	2360200	resources.
2360200	2365200	So I'm, I'm setting my expectations reasonably and I'm recognizing that, Hey, it's cool that
2365200	2367200	we got even what we got.
2367200	2369200	Um, and, but you're right.
2369200	2371200	ROM hackers have already kind of taken care of that.
2371200	2374200	Now, obviously Konami can't release that in any official capacity.
2374200	2378200	Uh, I guess they could, but it would get into dicey territory.
2378200	2379200	Um, so, but you're right.
2379200	2382200	Hackers will have to take care of that.
2382200	2383200	So it'll be, it'll be interesting.
2383200	2384200	You're right.
2384200	2385200	So, um,
2385200	2388200	But anyway, we've had, and I'll, I'll go over something else too.
2388200	2393200	It does have some differences from the PC engine release because the controllers and
2393200	2396200	PC engine, it didn't have this turbo buttons on it.
2396200	2402200	Um, the, uh, us one does because the turbo graphics came out with them on it and it does
2402200	2406200	have two, uh, two ports, even though it only comes with one controller.
2406200	2409200	So no turbo tap is needed unless y'all is going to play some bomber man.
2409200	2412200	I don't know if you've played around with this mode, Jamie, but Bobby Blackwolf and
2412200	2417200	Chad is asking, so how long will you play games in the last display setting of the turbo
2417200	2418200	engine handheld?
2418200	2420200	Is that super duper hard modes?
2420200	2423200	I don't know if you've gone into the display settings, but the last one in there is like
2423200	2425200	playing it on a turbo.
2425200	2428200	It's, it's, it's really nauseating to look at.
2428200	2431200	I freaking have a turbo express.
2431200	2434200	You can get your headaches there.
2434200	2437200	Oh, Dan said something from the other room, but I couldn't hear what he said.
2437200	2438200	All right.
2438200	2439200	All right.
2439200	2443200	Well, uh, anything else with your gaming week, dark soccer before we move on to Loki?
2443200	2444200	Um, nah.
2444200	2445200	All right.
2445200	2446200	So Loki, how was your gaming week?
2446200	2448200	And I'm going to change this camera thing on the fly.
2448200	2449200	Sorry guys.
2449200	2453200	It's a new, new stuff tonight, but I'm going to make my co-host a little bigger while Loki
2453200	2455200	talks about his gaming week.
2455200	2456200	All right.
2456200	2463200	So, um, this week I mainly played, uh, Orna, so I'm up to 175 now.
2463200	2465200	Um, so that was kind of cool.
2465200	2470200	And they have this brand new thing that they added in, which is a raid bosses or, well,
2470200	2476200	raid bosses are new, but basically spawnable raid bosses that are appearing for anybody
2476200	2477200	that's in the area.
2477200	2481200	So I had one that unfortunately no one helped to kill.
2481200	2486200	So it took me like a few days to do that, but it gives you a lot of experience, which
2486200	2487200	is kind of cool.
2487200	2489200	Um, I just did the same thing.
2489200	2491200	So there's one right by me right now.
2491200	2493200	And that thing kicks my ass.
2493200	2494200	I don't know.
2494200	2497200	It's going to take me like a month to kill it.
2497200	2498200	Yeah.
2498200	2499200	Yeah.
2499200	2502200	So I've still got two more scrolls to the spawn.
2502200	2506200	I'm like, I don't want to spawn another one cause it's just, it's such a hassle.
2506200	2509200	Like I don't want to do it, but I probably will.
2509200	2512200	When it gets a little easier to hang out in groups.
2512200	2516200	I mean, I guess to some extent you can still like social distance at a park and things
2516200	2517200	like that.
2517200	2521200	It just kind of depends on what you're comfortable with and you know how your body is with, with
2521200	2523200	uh, uh, being susceptible and all that.
2523200	2528200	But um, an idea had come up to, we could all kind of agree to meet at the same park and
2528200	2531200	spawn all the bosses and then take them down as a group.
2531200	2532200	So that might be a way to do it.
2532200	2538200	So yeah, I mean obviously it'll kind of depend on this whole situation and when that's really
2538200	2540200	safe to do and all that.
2540200	2541200	Yeah, we can see.
2541200	2546200	Um, so I did that and then the other thing I did was I restarted the realm that I have.
2546200	2552200	So my kids had already beaten the Ender Dragon and everything in Minecraft and the Wither
2552200	2553200	Dragon and all that stuff.
2553200	2557200	And so I decided that I wanted to go ahead and restart the whole thing from scratch because
2557200	2560200	we kind of cheated our way through it a little bit.
2560200	2565200	Um, so now we're playing it legit and um, so we just did that.
2565200	2568200	But I do have an add on that I added in there.
2568200	2575200	So because the snow golems are kind of garbage, so I replaced them with a turret minigun because
2575200	2576200	that's fun.
2576200	2580200	Um, so that was one of the things you can do with Bedrock Minecraft is you can actually
2580200	2585200	edit it with some of the add ons and those persist to the other players across other
2585200	2586200	platforms.
2586200	2590200	Like my, my other son plays on the switch and so he can actually use as well.
2590200	2596200	You're kind of limited what you can do in realms with those add ons because they limit
2596200	2601200	like for example, I wanted to make new crafting recipes to be able to craft some of the things
2601200	2603200	that you can't craft in the game right now.
2603200	2609200	Um, they can only get from chests and stuff and it won't let me do that without enabling
2609200	2616200	experimental gameplay and you can't have experimental gameplay on realms right now
2616200	2619200	because I think some systems don't support it.
2619200	2624200	So I, um, didn't do that.
2624200	2626200	Uh, at least that's my understanding at least.
2626200	2628200	So I just didn't bother to do that.
2628200	2630200	But we, we started out and it's pretty cool.
2630200	2634200	We got this, I built this giant mansion, stayed up pretty late last night doing that.
2634200	2639200	Um, and uh, yeah, they finally went to another today, but it's been fun.
2639200	2641200	Kids are having a good time.
2641200	2642200	Good.
2642200	2643200	All right.
2643200	2646200	Um, is that it for your gaming week?
2646200	2650200	Uh, yeah, I think that's it.
2650200	2651200	Yeah.
2651200	2652200	I haven't, haven't played anything else.
2652200	2653200	All right.
2653200	2654200	Then I'll talk about my gaming week.
2654200	2659200	So, uh, for my gaming week, uh, was, um, a lot of the same old stuff still playing Final
2659200	2665200	Fantasy 14 with friends and, uh, getting ready for a fantasy star on line two on PC.
2665200	2669200	I'm really excited to play that on PC so I can kind of do that on my, you know, I just
2669200	2671200	like playing with keyboard and mouse and all that.
2671200	2674200	So, uh, really excited to go through that again, although I don't know, PSO might be
2674200	2677200	better with controller, but I can still do that on the PC and you know, then discord
2677200	2679200	will be right there and I'm in my zone.
2679200	2680200	I'm in my setup.
2680200	2681200	I think it'll be really, really good to have.
2681200	2683200	So that's coming up this coming week.
2683200	2690200	Um, I did not get around to playing the turbo graphics, uh, mini because, so y'all remember
2690200	2693200	last summer I was talking about the survivor LARP and I've talked about it a couple of
2693200	2694200	times since then.
2694200	2699200	I'm not playing again, but I'm helping to host, uh, this current version that they're
2699200	2700200	doing right now.
2700200	2701200	They're on like their 11th season.
2701200	2705200	So the one I won was the ninth, they're on their 11th season and I'm helping to host
2705200	2706200	it.
2706200	2709200	And so this weekend they did a challenge that I designed.
2709200	2713200	And so it was the like first challenge that I designed for the game and they did it.
2713200	2717200	And, uh, if you want like a little peek at what it looked like now that I have this fancy
2717200	2719200	little safari button, I can hit that.
2719200	2723200	So like they had to do these little puzzles that they put together and it may look pretty
2723200	2724200	easy.
2724200	2727200	Um, but it's, you know, it took them a little time.
2727200	2729200	I would say, uh, there's, there's a few of these.
2729200	2730200	This isn't the old one.
2730200	2732200	So it leads them to these different like URLs and things like that.
2732200	2738200	And, um, there's like four of them all together and it took them about like 35, 40 minutes.
2738200	2741200	So my point is I'm a game designer now.
2741200	2744200	So how about that Loki?
2744200	2746200	I had people play my game.
2746200	2750200	Rob, you get the pizza.
2750200	2751200	Congrats.
2751200	2752200	It's a little different.
2752200	2757200	It's kind of, it's, it's almost the equivalent of when you would draw the RPG on graph paper.
2757200	2759200	How many of you guys did this on your lunch break in elementary school?
2759200	2762200	You drew the RPG on graph paper and like all that stuff.
2762200	2765200	It's kind of the equivalent of that, but Hey, a game is a game.
2765200	2766200	I'll take it.
2766200	2767200	And it seemed to be well received.
2767200	2768200	So I was happy with that.
2768200	2770200	So that's why I didn't get around to the turbo graphics.
2770200	2774200	Cause that I was cramming and finishing last night and then they all played it this morning.
2774200	2775200	So I was very busy watching all that.
2775200	2779200	Um, I did get to play a little bit of Pokemon go community day.
2779200	2782200	Um, I caught seven shinies without really trying.
2782200	2784200	Alan and I just went to the local park.
2784200	2793200	You know, there was not, there was a couple other people walking around, but it wasn't like, it wasn't, it didn't look like the fricking like boardwalk on the, what was that ocean city or whatever.
2793200	2795200	No, no, the park was very low key.
2795200	2797200	So we were there, walked around.
2797200	2800200	I just used my little Poke ball to catch while walking.
2800200	2802200	And I was playing a little ingress as well.
2802200	2804200	Uh, and I caught seven shinies without really trying.
2804200	2806200	So that felt really good.
2806200	2808200	Um, so yeah, Pokemon go.
2808200	2809200	That was fine.
2809200	2813200	I wish it was a better Pokemon, but I guess they're pretty, it's, it's nice to have at least the three.
2813200	2815200	And I guess it is pretty good for PVP.
2815200	2816200	I hear.
2816200	2818200	Um, and I caught a couple that were three stars.
2818200	2819200	So that's, that's nice.
2819200	2820200	That's good.
2820200	2828200	Um, and then, uh, yeah, otherwise like with between Orna and other stuff, that's, that's pretty much how my gaming week went.
2828200	2834200	So, uh, again, looking forward to next week cause there's some, uh, new releases I'm looking forward to trying like a PSL.
2834200	2836200	So, yep.
2836200	2837200	All right.
2837200	2841200	So, uh, with that, let's move on to some gaming news.
2841200	2845200	Uh, real quick though, a little bit of housekeeping.
2845200	2847200	Um, I do want to mention a couple of things here.
2847200	2852200	Um, number one, uh, I mentioned this last week, but, uh, I'll mention it again tonight.
2852200	2857200	The Southern Fried Game Room Expo, uh, which is, uh, it's out in the Atlanta area.
2857200	2864200	And so we don't usually get to attend, um, because I usually go to Atlanta for DragonCon, but they had to cancel, uh, this year.
2864200	2873200	Or they did cancel obviously with everything going on in the world, except they didn't do for, you know, you know, George is kind of taking the situation a little differently right now.
2873200	2876200	And so they didn't have force majeure when they canceled.
2876200	2879200	So they are taking a little bit of a financial hit on this whole thing.
2879200	2886200	Um, so if you want to show Southern Fried Game Expo, a little Game Room Expo, a little love, I would encourage you to go visit their website.
2886200	2889200	They have some merchandise there, which Loki, you actually bought a shirt, didn't you?
2889200	2890200	Yes, I did.
2890200	2891200	Yeah. So you actually bought a shirt on there.
2891200	2894200	The shirts are pretty bad ass with the power glove and everything.
2894200	2895200	So it did, it did look really cool.
2895200	2898200	And that's just to help make sure it'll happen next year.
2899200	2906200	Yeah. The one, the one I looked at was the, uh, the black and, um, yellowish green one.
2906200	2911200	But then I was like, eh, maybe I should get blue and pink. I don't know, but that's what I ended up getting.
2911200	2918200	Yeah. Um, and then, uh, in other, one other housekeeping thing I wanted to mention, we just talked about this on Bobby's show.
2918200	2924200	So those that are listening live are going to hear this twice. Sorry, but I just wanted it for the benefit of the podcast listeners and, and just put a little love out there.
2924200	2930200	Um, we did announce earlier today that, um, girls gone wow has, uh, left the voice of geeks network.
2930200	2938200	Um, as they are signing up with Warcraft radio, which is a relaunching, I think it's a, an older radio network that's kind of coming back because of Twitch.
2938200	2947200	And so they are going to be, um, streaming and broadcasting with other Warcraft podcasters and, you know, and, and it's absolutely no hard feelings.
2947200	2948200	Love those girls over there.
2948200	2955200	Uh, no, I shouldn't say girl. I know there's shows called girls gone wild, but they're women. I love those women, uh, over at girls gone wow.
2955200	2965200	And, uh, thank you for, uh, many, many years here at the voice geeks network and really, really wishing you guys nothing but the best, uh, in the future and hoping that I'm getting together with all the other Warcraft folks.
2965200	2971200	Uh, means great things when it comes to like BlizzCon and getting to interview people at Blizzard and all that good stuff.
2971200	2978200	So, um, yeah, so, um, we're, we're, we're all still friends just, you know, on different networks now. So that's, it's all good.
2978200	2983200	I just want to wish them the best and thank them for the years that they spent on the voice geeks network.
2983200	2991200	So, uh, on a somewhat related note, I suppose, uh, the voice geeks network is looking for more podcasts and broadcasts.
2991200	2997200	Um, I know a lot of people might be using this whole quarantine and weird world times to be getting into that sort of hobby.
2997200	3007200	Um, so if you have like a geeky related show and it can even be about gaming, uh, or, or what have you, we are looking to recruit more dedicated people for the network.
3007200	3016200	Um, so reach out, uh, we're very easy to find on Twitter. Uh, I'm at mr Rob Roberts, or of course you can always email me rob at vog network.com.
3016200	3020200	That's VOG network.com, uh, or look at the website. We're very easy to find there.
3020200	3030200	Um, definitely looking to recruit some more shows because, um, obviously girls got, wow, I just talked about with them, but we have a lot of other shows that have just pod faded, um, over the past couple of years.
3030200	3035200	We have a lot of shows that just for various reasons, they're just not recording anymore. These things happen.
3035200	3040200	Um, believe it or not shows going over 10 years doesn't happen a lot.
3040200	3050200	So, uh, we've, we've been very fortunate, uh, to still have, you know, Bobby and British invaders. I know pod culture is still, uh, taping here and there and may jam session us.
3050200	3056200	So we do still have a few shows that have been going a very long time, but unfortunately some of the other shows I have pod faded for various reasons.
3056200	3064200	So, uh, if you're interested, uh, please don't hesitate to reach out. All right, let's get into some gaming news. Uh, Loki, we'll start with you.
3064200	3075200	Yeah, so this is kind of funny. Um, so we've talked about G2A for awhile. They're the kind of gray market seller of, uh, steam keys and I think other keys as well.
3075200	3093200	So they've always been adamant that they don't sell stolen keys on their site and they are so confident that that was the case that they even offered up that, Hey, if you're an independent developer and you find proof that our keys or the keys that we're selling for your games are stolen,
3093200	3108200	we will refund you, uh, 10 times the amount of those purchases. Well, that leads us to their, uh, blog posts that they put up called keeping our promise.
3108200	3124200	Uh, basically saying that they found that a 321 keys of, uh, I believe it was, uh, what was that? Factorio. And they found that those were sold, um, illegitimately as well.
3124200	3141200	So they're now paying, um, them $39,600, uh, which is 10 times the value of any bank initiated refund costs that Factorio paid in relation to each of the 198 illegitimate keys sold via its marketplace.
3141200	3156200	Um, so it's kind of funny because that basically catches them saying, no, we don't sell those keys except that we do sell illegal keys. And of course they're trying to spin it as basically saying that, Oh, well we were duped.
3156200	3170200	Um, you know, basically saying that what we lost launched this offer. We wanted to send a clear message to the gaming community that fraud hurts all parties. As we spell out in this blog, fraud directly hurts individuals who buy illegitimate keys.
3170200	3179200	It hurts game developers and it ultimately hurts G2A because we are forced as a transaction facilitator to cover the costs related to the sale.
3180200	3198200	Except I think they're well aware of what goes on on their site. And this is probably just a small price for them to pay to do their business. And they probably make way more money from this, but it's just basically them admitting to what everybody's been saying that they've done for a long time. And that's kind of funny.
3198200	3200200	They're only sorry they got caught.
3200200	3208200	I feel like, yeah, I feel like that whole congrats you played yourself meme is very appropriate here. Uh, if, if nothing else.
3209200	3211200	Right. Yeah. Pretty much.
3211200	3219200	So how is this company kind of still in business even though they got caught? I mean, I know they're, they're kind of talking their way out of it and I don't know.
3220200	3232200	There's that part of me that wants to go, maybe they're not all bad after all. Maybe there is some lit, but it's, it's just hard when time and time again you see them kind of tripping and falling down the stairs. You know what I mean?
3233200	3241200	Yeah. It's just, I don't know. It's ridiculous. So just don't buy through G2A.
3241200	3246200	I mean, even some of the developers have come out and said, Hey, we'd rather you pirate our game to buy through G2A.
3246200	3264200	So, I mean, that, that's, that's saying a lot because really when you think about it, because if you're buying these keys and then there's, you know, someone's doing a, uh, you know, credit card reversal on them and the developers actually losing money aside from getting no money whatsoever.
3264200	3266200	They're losing additional money.
3266200	3276200	No, I totally get it. When somebody pirates the game, which I don't endorse piracy on the show, but when somebody pirates the game, uh, they're getting, uh, they're, they're getting something stolen from them.
3276200	3289200	When somebody buys from one of these shady key seller recites, they're getting something stolen from them and someone else is getting money. It's like, it's double bad. It makes a really bad thing even worse, but yeah.
3290200	3300200	All right. Uh, well, let's move on to things that should be a little bit happier news and talk a little bit about the Olympics. Um, so the Olympics in 2020, of course they've been postponed.
3300200	3309200	They're not going to be happening this year that, or I should say the 2020 Olympics will be happening in 2021. We all know it's crazy times right now and things are going to be happening a little bit differently, but, um,
3309200	3310200	We'll see about that.
3310200	3323200	Well, yeah, yeah. Who knows if this thing keeps going to 2021, who knows? But anyway, as of now, that's how things are, but for 2020 this year, uh, there's going to be a team up happening for a special virtual event.
3323200	3339200	So Xbox and special Olympics are going to be teaming up for a virtual event. Um, now of course, a lot of, we always kind of talk about the Olympics, the Olympics, but of course the special Olympics also happen in the same host city in the same year.
3339200	3357200	Uh, that the Olympics do. So Tokyo was also going to be hosting the special Olympics. Uh, but obviously that has all shifted as well to 2021. So anyhow, um, Forza Motorsport 7, which of course is Microsoft title is going to be getting a special event on May 30th
3358200	3371200	for, from 35 athletes representing 11 countries, uh, for some competition. And this is also interesting. They're going to do the award ceremony in Minecraft, which is another Microsoft product at this point.
3371200	3383200	So it is, it's kind of interesting how, um, you know, that that's all coming together, which, you know, we've heard Minecraft be used for a lot of virtual things, but I don't think we've ever put the name the Olympics behind it.
3383200	3390200	And that's, I think there's a lot of people out there that have been wondering, are video games ever going to become an Olympic sport? Well, that's not what's happening here.
3390200	3404200	But the fact that, and it's not the first time the Olympics has had an event around video games either, but the fact that it's going to be happening and it's one of the only 2020 Olympic events that's going to happen in 2020, I think is what kind of makes this notable
3404200	3419200	because video games have also been bridging the gap of, you know, missing sports right now, right? We've talked plenty on previous episodes about these virtual events for charity or the simulators being used in racing events and so forth.
3419200	3428200	So, um, pretty cool. Uh, so anyway, uh, you can check out the live stream at three o'clock Eastern, or that would be noon. And again, that is on May 30th.
3428200	3441200	So that's coming up in the next couple days. And, uh, the whole thing is also going to be, uh, you can get more information, how to volunteer with the Special Olympics, uh, and actually taking donations through the Microsoft rewards program.
3441200	3453200	So if you're racking up rewards points from either like using Bing or using Game Pass, you get a lot of points to that too. If you've never looked like look at that Microsoft rewards app, because if you collect like a thousand points, which isn't that hard to do,
3453200	3465200	that's like a dollar you can donate to Special Olympics. And then Microsoft actually matches that. So that's pretty cool. So you might have been wondering like, why the Special Olympics? Because this whole thing is to help raise money, bring attention.
3465200	3474200	And so, uh, all that good stuff. And yeah, I think that sounds awesome. What do you guys think about this kind of team up event in lieu of an actual Olympics?
3474200	3478200	It's neat, but like, I don't use Bing.
3478200	3481200	No one uses Bing.
3481200	3489200	No, a lot, a lot of people use Bing. Bing's good for one thing. Um, but yeah, I don't use it normally for, um, internet searches.
3489200	3493200	Wait, wait, what's the thing it's good for?
3493200	3498200	It is incredibly great from what I hear for searching for pornography.
3498200	3502200	I was, I was hoping that would be the answer. Thank you.
3502200	3507200	I'm not sure why, but that's apparently what it is.
3507200	3512200	I legit didn't know. You know what else is great for searching for pornography? Pornhub.
3512200	3520200	So I legit did not know that that Bing was like a thing that people search for porn on. That's interesting.
3520200	3528200	Yeah, I don't know if they do like video searches or what the case may be, but I just don't touch Bing at all because it's Bing and it's garbage.
3528200	3531200	No, thanks.
3531200	3542200	No. Yeah. If I'm going to use anything other than, uh, uh, I'd say a Google search, you know, as search engines go, it's probably going to be DuckDuckGo.
3542200	3548200	Um, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I guess you can search for porn on Bing and Google won't track it.
3548200	3557200	Well, what about an incognito window or, or is, is that all like tinfoil-y? It's a lie and Google's tracking you anyway.
3557200	3562200	You can, it's supposed to be completely private.
3562200	3568200	Hmm. Hmm. Anyway, bonds, double 06 says, why not go back to ask Jeeves?
3568200	3574200	Oh God, fifth dream brought up hot bot. That was the thing to use for awhile.
3574200	3580200	Jeeves. How big them titties?
3580200	3587200	I can't believe people use search engines for that. It's just, it just seems like you'd see the same thing. All right, forget it. Forget it.
3587200	3592200	We're not having this discussion on this show, although we just did. Let's move on.
3592200	3596200	Dark soccer. Bring a little class and dignity to this show with your next article, please.
3596200	3600200	Class? Are you, are you serious? I am a classy bitch.
3601200	3610200	And again, I got to stress, I mean, you always look great, but you are, you are especially well lit tonight. Your face is beat for the gods.
3610200	3621200	Can you see I have a ring light on and I am, I am not that, I actually, I have, I put on a bare minimum just because I didn't want to look like, you know, a corpse with as pale as I am.
3621200	3624200	But I do have my ring light. I got it working.
3624200	3628200	Your lighting, chef's kiss. It looks fantastic.
3628200	3630200	And my crew behind me.
3630200	3645200	Again, again, you, I want to stress, you always look good, but I know you have not always been the most like camera, you know, loving person, but like, you went all out tonight. You look great.
3645200	3646200	No.
3646200	3650200	If only your webcam wasn't a potato, but that's okay.
3650200	3652200	Okay. My webcam.
3652200	3653200	Okay.
3653200	3654200	Baby steps. Baby steps.
3654200	3655200	I got it on Wish out of desperation.
3655200	3656200	I understand.
3656200	3657200	Cause.
3657200	3658200	I understand.
3658200	3662200	I'm not ready to drop that 150 on the Logitech one I want yet. Not yet.
3662200	3667200	A lot of people who use Bing buy on Wish out of desperation.
3668200	3679200	No, some wishes had good cosplay stuff. And I had gotten, I bought the webcam when I was getting the stuff together for Eastern Dolores Park for sister stuff.
3679200	3686200	I've got all this like feathery crap behind me that was going to be part of my, my look.
3686200	3692200	Uh, and Bobby has a great point in chat saying, uh, webcams are hard to find right now.
3692200	3697200	Anyway, with everyone working from home. Yeah. A lot of computer parts got crazy harder to find in this day and age.
3697200	3702200	I can switch to my Mac. The only reason the stuff's in front of my Mac was just to have a little bit more background stuff.
3702200	3704200	You're fine.
3704200	3706200	You don't know it has a great cam on it.
3706200	3709200	You don't owe anyone an explanation.
3709200	3712200	But it's funny. I got it on Wish.
3712200	3713200	All right.
3713200	3714200	Hilarious.
3714200	3715200	All right. Anyway, story.
3715200	3716200	All right.
3716200	3727200	So, um, for peeps like us who have the Twitch primes, we're getting 20 SNK games for free.
3727200	3732200	I think it's actually some of the same ones that were in that, uh, that humble bundle a while back.
3732200	3737200	But, um, starting on May 26th, which for us is in two days.
3737200	3739200	So that's going to be two years a day.
3739200	3746200	Um, you get games like King of Fighters 2002, Samurai Shodown 2, um, just a bunch of others.
3746200	3753200	So, um, the list, uh, some of them on the list is Blazing Star, which I fucking love Blazing Star.
3753200	3754200	Oh my God.
3754200	3758200	Um, Last Blade 2, Garo, Mark of the Wolves.
3758200	3762200	Um, there's a Polestar again that was a prequel to Blazing Star.
3762200	3768200	Sengoku 3, King of the Monsters, Metal Slug 2, King of Fighters 98 Ultimate Match Final Edition.
3768200	3769200	Oh, those names.
3769200	3773200	Those are going to be some good things to have on, uh, on that group.
3773200	3778200	So I would definitely, if you've got the prime, get it, get it good.
3778200	3782200	And, uh, if you have prime, drop that sub at VOG Network.
3782200	3784200	I got to put a cheap plug in there somewhere, please.
3784200	3785200	Do the thing.
3785200	3786200	Appreciate those.
3786200	3787200	Give us the subby subs.
3787200	3788200	Appreciate those of you that do.
3788200	3793200	But other, um, uh, loot that's going to be involved in Twitch Prime.
3793200	3799200	Um, there's a few things right now, but there's going to be, um, some, uh, uh, giveaways like
3799200	3800200	in game.
3800200	3804200	Like there's one for like, I think a skin for, uh, Doom Eternal right now.
3804200	3806200	There's just a few other things in there.
3806200	3812200	So if you've got the, um, the Twitch Prime, then dig in and see what you can find.
3812200	3814200	You might find a treat.
3814200	3818200	Um, and, uh, I, I did, I do want to say, and you, you kind of mentioned this as like, you
3818200	3820200	know, we've seen these SNK games other places before.
3820200	3826200	I think Twitch actually gave some of these away before, because I know Fatal Fury Special.
3826200	3830200	I know I picked that up in a Twitch giveaway at one point because that's my favorite Fatal
3830200	3831200	Fury game is Fatal Fury Special.
3831200	3835200	And it was, it was on Twitch Prime at some point because it's already on my computer
3835200	3836200	and I didn't pay for it.
3836200	3837200	It was free.
3837200	3841200	So I guess it could have been a humble bundle, but I'm almost positive it was a Twitch giveaway.
3841200	3845200	Um, but it is, you know, Hey, not everybody got it the first time.
3845200	3847200	There's definitely some stuff here now that wasn't there before.
3847200	3850200	So it's, it's cool that they're giving away a lot.
3850200	3854200	Maybe I'll have to stream how much I suck at Blazing Star now.
3854200	3856200	Why not?
3856200	3857200	Good times.
3857200	3858200	All right.
3858200	3860200	I love, I love Samurai Shodown too.
3860200	3863200	That's one that Dan and I actually have on Neo Geo.
3863200	3865200	We imported it so it's Samurai Spirits too.
3865200	3871200	But if you switch the language options in the game, um, if you put it to English, the blood turns wet.
3871200	3873200	Oh, how funny.
3873200	3878200	And back to Japanese, you know, so you actually have both language modes on each of those cartridges.
3878200	3882200	And I'm wondering if, uh, these iterations of the game are going to do the same.
3882200	3883200	Huh?
3883200	3884200	I didn't know that.
3884200	3885200	That's interesting.
3885200	3886200	All right.
3886200	3887200	Well, let's move on.
3887200	3888200	Next story.
3888200	3889200	Loki.
3889200	3890200	Yeah.
3890200	3896200	So, um, there's this project that's going on, uh, called Insignia that's looking to
3896200	3900200	bring back Xbox Live for the original Xbox.
3900200	3903200	Um, so you may think, well, wait a second.
3903200	3905200	Don't they already have something like that?
3905200	3907200	Um, where you can play online with the Xbox?
3907200	3909200	Well, technically yes.
3909200	3911200	With tunneling with system link.
3911200	3913200	So they have that X links.
3913200	3919200	But this is actually looking to enable Xbox Live using a third party.
3919200	3927200	Um, I can only imagine that's going to cause some issues at some point when Microsoft catches notice of it.
3927200	3931200	But apparently they have some proof of concept stuff that they're showing right now where
3931200	3937200	they go and actually create an Xbox Live account, um, or at least go through all the screens
3937200	3940200	to do so, um, using the service.
3940200	3946200	And it's going to be neat if they actually get it going, um, to basically allow folks
3946200	3952200	to be able to play those games before that, um, had Xbox Live multiplayer, but now they
3952200	3954200	haven't been able to with system links.
3955200	3961200	I will be interested to see if it happens, but I'm more on the fence saying that it's
3961200	3964200	probably going to get shut down before they ever get to that point.
3964200	3968200	Um, apparently they're in Duda also without console modding as well.
3968200	3973200	Apparently all you need to do is just actually dump your keys for your console using some
3973200	3977200	soft mod process and then you're good to go.
3977200	3982200	Um, and they're even looking to enable like the voice chat messaging and all that stuff.
3982200	3987200	So, um, be interesting to see how that works out.
3987200	3992200	Yeah, I'm not sure it's going to be long for, um, Microsoft not wanting to shut it down
3992200	3993200	either.
3993200	3994200	I mean, I don't know.
3994200	3999200	There's a part of me that's like, but you know, to be able to preserve the functionality
3999200	4003200	of the original console for historical type of reasons and so forth, it's something they
4003200	4005200	ought to consider just backing off on.
4005200	4007200	Like, is it really going to cut into their current business?
4007200	4008200	I don't think so.
4008200	4013200	But at the same time, Microsoft has made a very big deal about this whole, you know,
4013200	4018200	oh, well it's going to play everything, you know, so even on Xbox Series X, you'll be
4018200	4023200	able to play original Xbox games and you know, Xbox Live will work because it's using your
4023200	4025200	Series X to do it.
4025200	4030200	But, and this is an important but, uh, is a limited selection Xbox games.
4030200	4032200	Not every Xbox game works.
4032200	4037200	You know, you guys know we're big fans of Dance Dance Revolution and the music games
4037200	4039200	that we all met playing.
4039200	4042200	Those games to this day don't work.
4042200	4046200	And I truly think, and I will die on this hill, dammit.
4046200	4051200	I think DDR UltraMix 2 on the original Xbox is the best home version of DDR they ever
4051200	4052200	made.
4052200	4054200	And you can't play it on backwards compatibility right now.
4054200	4059200	Now, it would be kind of, you know, it would be a little weird anyway because you couldn't
4059200	4061200	exactly use a dance mat with it.
4061200	4068200	But, I mean, if you can play DDR on the web right now, why can't I at least button button
4068200	4069200	revolution?
4069200	4073200	And if Xbox Series X, because it's going to take USB devices, because the Xbox One does,
4073200	4077200	maybe there could be a way to bring dance pads back for those that really, really want
4077200	4078200	to do it.
4078200	4085200	They could just, I don't know if they could, maybe not even necessarily put out new dance
4085200	4089200	pads, but like say, hey, if you've got one of those older ones, you can use that.
4089200	4095200	And I mean, there's plenty of those floating around out there and use store, you know,
4095200	4099200	use like thrift shops and whatnot.
4099200	4107200	Hell, I was digging through the garage today and I have two brand new Xbox 360 dance mats.
4107200	4108200	Oh, nice.
4108200	4111200	I've never been used because I had my own.
4111200	4114200	So I have never bothered to actually use those.
4114200	4118200	I have a PlayStation 2 one that's never been used.
4118200	4125200	So, yeah, I mean, I suppose they could, you know, support it.
4125200	4131200	I mean, it's basically just like a, it's, it's such a niche thing that I understand
4131200	4134200	why it's like, oh, we're just going to like come right out and support it.
4134200	4138200	But it would be really cool if they could at least get it added to the backwards compatibility
4138200	4140200	list so we can at least play it with buttons or not.
4140200	4144200	And I'll tell you, the hardware modifiers will take care of the rest.
4144200	4148200	Somebody will get a dance pad working through USB so you can play DDR with a dance pad.
4148200	4152200	Again, it might not work where the game recognizes it as such and all of that,
4152200	4153200	but it'll be close enough.
4153200	4157200	Darn it to satisfy, you know, those of us that would like to do that.
4157200	4158200	Right.
4158200	4162200	I mean, there's plenty of things already that you can plug into your Xbox that emulate,
4162200	4165200	you know, pushing in the buttons on the controller.
4165200	4169200	So it makes sense that they would be able to do that pretty easy.
4169200	4176200	See, and then not only do the original UltraMix games not work on later X, you know, past the original Xbox,
4176200	4181200	but then Dance Dance Revolution Universe on the Xbox 360 doesn't work on the Xbox One or anything after that.
4181200	4188200	So like those DDR games, but yet, yet, yet, do you know what game is playable on Xbox One
4188200	4192200	that is backwards compatible that does show up?
4192200	4193200	Is it Beaten Groovy?
4193200	4195200	Beaten Groovy is backwards compatible.
4195200	4198200	Give me a fucking break.
4198200	4204200	Now, and we've talked about this before when we talk about Xbox emulation,
4204200	4211200	because remember when they got a lot of shit because like Barbie's horse party or whatever was on the emulation list.
4211200	4215200	And it's like, I don't think Microsoft went out of their way to make that one,
4215200	4220200	but it's like when they get a certain engine working or they get a certain type of game working,
4220200	4222200	then that one just gets brought in as well.
4222200	4229200	And I would imagine for Konami, Beaten Groovy is probably just running through some type of PlayStation 1 emulator,
4229200	4232200	just like Symphony of the Night.
4232200	4239200	So when they got Symphony of the Night working, well, Beaten Groovy, hooray, it works too.
4239200	4244200	So, which by the way is the most terrible thing Konami's ever done to music game fans.
4244200	4249200	You know, I'm surprised that they don't try to put those out again because you have stuff like,
4250200	4254200	God, there's like lots of different music games now that are coming out.
4254200	4259200	They're just specifically using like keys and stuff like the DJ Maxx stuff.
4259200	4264200	And I'm surprised that they don't try to put out like pop music or something.
4264200	4267200	I know where the controller wouldn't be the best thing.
4267200	4270200	But I mean, somebody is going to buy it.
4270200	4273200	Do you know what I totally forgot to mention during my gaming week?
4273200	4276200	I played DJ Maxx on PC.
4276200	4278200	I can't remember the subtitle.
4278200	4280200	It's fun to play on a keyboard.
4280200	4283200	I think it's five. It's the one that was free this weekend.
4283200	4285200	Yeah, it had a free weekend on Steam.
4285200	4287200	So I checked it out.
4287200	4290200	I don't want to double dip from the PlayStation 4 version,
4290200	4292200	especially for the amount they're asking for it.
4292200	4296200	But it does have a few songs, like the Porter Robinson song is new.
4296200	4301200	And they have that song from Beat Saber, Pop Stars.
4302200	4303200	Yeah.
4304200	4306200	Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.
4306200	4309200	That song that I will sing it all.
4309200	4310200	Thank you.
4310200	4313200	That song is in DJ Maxx as well.
4313200	4315200	And so I was like, oh, this song again.
4315200	4319200	So but I think doesn't that all come from like a League of Legends thing?
4319200	4320200	I think it does.
4320200	4322200	So I think that's why it shows up in like gaming stuff everywhere.
4322200	4323200	But anyway.
4323200	4325200	All right.
4325200	4327200	So, yeah, I left that on my gaming week.
4327200	4330200	But when music games got brought up, there you go.
4330200	4333200	So anyway, we've deviated a bit from the Insignia project.
4333200	4337200	So maybe Microsoft will shut it down, but maybe they won't.
4337200	4338200	We'll see.
4339200	4340200	I think that they will.
4340200	4341200	Yeah.
4341200	4342200	All right.
4342200	4344200	But we'll see.
4344200	4345200	All right.
4345200	4347200	It won't be as fast as Nintendo.
4347200	4349200	Nintendo would have shut that down yesterday.
4349200	4350200	So there is that.
4350200	4351200	All right.
4351200	4354200	Let's talk about New Game Plus Expo.
4354200	4357200	And one of the biggest companies involved with this is Sega.
4357200	4358200	So what is it?
4358200	4360200	It is going to be a new video game showcase.
4360200	4367200	Obviously, this year with E3 not happening, you have a lot of people scurrying to do something else.
4367200	4370200	Of course, a lot of that in a virtual environment.
4370200	4374200	And we've heard that, you know, some of the publishers that would usually do these big press conferences,
4374200	4377200	such as Microsoft and Ubisoft, they're planning their own thing.
4377200	4379200	They're going to do their own type of press conference.
4379200	4382200	Well, what about some of the smaller companies?
4382200	4385200	It's weird to me to think of Sega as a smaller company.
4385200	4386200	I don't think they are.
4386200	4388200	But Sega never did a main stage show.
4388200	4389200	You know what I mean?
4389200	4396200	So what happens to these smaller groups that maybe would have booths at E3, but there is no E3 this year.
4396200	4399200	So a lot of these guys have banded together for the New Game Plus Expo.
4399200	4403200	It will be kicking off on the 23rd of June.
4403200	4406200	That's the same day as our anniversary, I'll have you know.
4406200	4408200	OLR started on June 23rd.
4408200	4411200	So Tuesday, June 23rd is the day it will kick off.
4411200	4415200	Fourteen publishers are going to be a part of this digital event.
4415200	4418200	There will be publishers in North America and Japan.
4418200	4421200	It will be an hour-long event on Twitch.
4421200	4423200	That's a lot of publishers for one hour.
4423200	4427200	8 a.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. in BST.
4427200	4429200	Is that British Standard Time?
4429200	4431200	I know that's over there.
4431200	4434200	And then there will be first looks and Q&A sessions.
4434200	4436200	Oh, so they're kind of doing the treehouse thing.
4436200	4440200	They're doing like an hour-long presentation and then deeper dive after that.
4440200	4442200	So who all is involved?
4442200	4445200	Sega, Atlas West is part of that as well.
4445200	4454200	Axis Games, Arc System Works, Inti Creates, Koei Tecmo, Natsume, Playism, WayForward, SNK, and more.
4454200	4457200	I didn't even name them all, but there's lots of companies that are involved with that.
4457200	4459200	So pretty cool.
4459200	4464200	That's a pretty early hour to be up and watching, but I'll be working anyway.
4464200	4470200	So maybe it'll be that thing where it's like I've got one monitor over here while I get my work done over here
4470200	4473200	to see if anything kind of catches my eye.
4473200	4475200	Sounds neat.
4475200	4480200	I feel like if Kensha Hall got an expo, this would be the closest thing to that.
4480200	4482200	That's how I feel.
4482200	4485200	Anyway, moving on. DarkSakura.
4485200	4489200	So how about some happy, feely good kind of news, right?
4489200	4491200	We need it.
4491200	4498200	Well, Guinness has recognized the oldest gaming YouTuber.
4498200	4504200	This is a 90-year-old woman named Mori Hamako.
4504200	4509200	She was born on February 18th, 1930.
4509200	4514200	So that puts it into perspective right in the Depression.
4514200	4520200	And she started playing video games about 39 years ago and became interested in it when she saw children playing with it.
4520200	4525200	And she said that it looked so much fun that it wasn't fair that only children could play it.
4525200	4528200	So she started playing when no one was watching.
4528200	4532200	Her first gaming console was called the Cassette Vision.
4532200	4535200	She has kept most of the consoles and software that she bought over the years.
4535200	4539200	And she says they treasure them because it brings her memories.
4539200	4542200	Currently, she likes to play PS4. She's into action games.
4542200	4547200	And her current favorite is Grand Theft Auto 5.
4547200	4549200	She says it's like watching a film.
4549200	4554200	I like it the best because it has age restrictions so children can't play it.
4554200	4560200	And then she started uploading her gaming videos on YouTube because she wanted to share her experiences with other people.
4560200	4565200	And her quote says it's such a waste if I'm the only one enjoying it.
4565200	4569200	So she tries to post like three to four videos a month and she loves her fans.
4569200	4575200	She says that they're very caring and concerned for her and that she thinks that playing video games rejuvenates her spirit.
4575200	4577200	And here's the last quote from her.
4577200	4582200	After living for this long, I feel more than ever that playing games for this long was the right choice.
4582200	4586200	I am truly enjoying my life. It's Rosie.
4586200	4590200	I love that.
4590200	4597200	And so, and she just, the pictures of her, you can just see absolute joy on her face while she's playing it.
4597200	4601200	So I linked the Guinness article in chat.
4601200	4608200	I've got one of her videos up, but I can only see her fingers playing Days Gone in this video.
4608200	4610200	So I don't actually see her face. That's unfortunate.
4610200	4613200	We're like watching her play, but she's not really there.
4613200	4618200	So I put a link to her to the pictures that are to the Guinness article.
4618200	4626200	OK, you can see her her just the smile on her face while she's playing in her interview.
4626200	4630200	It's really cute. Yeah. Well, then you can see there's a lot of different videos on her channel.
4630200	4633200	You can see in some of them, you can actually see like I have big news.
4633200	4638200	And oh, this over, she's unboxing her PlayStation four. This is probably a good one from a few years ago.
4638200	4643200	So here we go. She's very excited to be opening your PlayStation four. That's awesome.
4643200	4649200	Yeah, she just it just she just looks like she authentically enjoys it.
4649200	4656200	And I we need more people who will be happy to play games and play them as they get older,
4656200	4662200	because they say that that you get older because you stop playing.
4662200	4665200	I bet it keeps her healthy, too, like, you know, just keeping.
4665200	4671200	I know we always that was the big thing when we were kids is that I'm working on my hand eye coordination.
4671200	4674200	Right. And we all know, like, but there there is something to that.
4674200	4680200	Those motor skills and things that might not be tested in older age specifically.
4680200	4687200	I think that kind of does help. I mean, I'm no scientist or doctor, but it would make a lot of sense that like keeping those things alert.
4687200	4692200	That's why they had Wii Sports and all the retirement homes. Right. It was a big part of that.
4692200	4701200	So the other the other thing about this, too, is just I would, you know, be a little bit more worried about repetitive motion injury.
4701200	4709200	But other than that, I mean, as long as she loves it and has the joy for it, keep doing it, keep encouraging her to do it.
4709200	4717200	And and, you know, I want to be her one day. I want to be a cute old Japanese lady.
4718200	4722200	Well, maybe if you ask very nicely, no.
4722200	4727200	But well, heck, we might still be doing a well are when we're 90 at this rate.
4727200	4731200	Great. I know I still know about it.
4731200	4736200	I know one will be listening to get us to get us to be like, it's the longest running podcast.
4736200	4739200	They're like, who? Oh, yeah. Who cares?
4742200	4745200	Well, we'll actually wear the clown makeup.
4745200	4748200	Well, I do that anyway as a sister.
4751200	4756200	He who is Steve in our chat says about the gamer grandma, that's too sweet.
4756200	4760200	She's seen far scarier things in her 90 years than some zombies.
4760200	4765200	Lol. That's true. Days, days gone. That's nothing for gamer grandma.
4765200	4770200	Well, yeah, but I mean, you think about it. Hold on. Where does where in Japan does she live?
4770200	4776200	But I mean, she would have been a teenager, maybe not a teenager,
4776200	4783200	maybe a younger child when Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed and she would have lived through that.
4783200	4787200	And that's nothing to joke about. But that's very that's very like, you know, yeah, you're right.
4787200	4793200	Very low, low points. Just like the kids today are, you know, well, I'd say some of the kids are having to deal with,
4793200	4798200	you know, being young when the World Trade Center was bombed or kids now living through a pandemic.
4798200	4805200	Yeah. Oh, yeah. I liked it. But she she was a witness to the history in Japan.
4805200	4811200	So just saying. All right. And to see her just finding such joy in this, it just, you know,
4811200	4817200	it makes me think that there's a moral to be taken out of this and that moral to me should be to always look for fun.
4817200	4825200	And don't you know, don't let I'd say the worst of humanity make you judge all of humanity.
4825200	4831200	Although maybe I'm a little judgmental. Well, rock on, Gamer Grandma, you're an inspiration, to be quite honest.
4831200	4837200	So, yeah, but we're we're coming for you. We're going to keep our going into our 90s.
4837200	4841200	So we're going to continue our legacy. That's right. That's right. All right.
4841200	4845200	Let's see the world's oldest podcasters. Let's move on.
4845200	4852200	Loki, some folks in chat were concerned when they saw this on the sidebar about the private club Penguin Servers.
4852200	4857200	Kind of like that can't be good. What's going on, Loki? It's not.
4857200	4861200	It's a spoiler alert. It's not. It's not.
4861200	4870200	So, yes, apparently people are clamoring to play Club Penguin, even though it's been shut down for a while now.
4870200	4877200	And of course, now they're coming under fire because Club Penguin,
4878200	4883200	these private servers that are out there are just full of all sorts of bad things.
4883200	4889200	So, for example, you know, you've got people filling it full of hate speech and sexual content.
4889200	4897200	So foul language. There's people engaging in what they call penguin sex and just all sorts of weird stuff.
4897200	4902200	A bunch of people. It's a bunch of people with no accountability having no accountability.
4902200	4910200	Right. Exactly. And because it's not on brand with Disney, they have filed DMCA complaints against all of these different things.
4910200	4920200	So they have a, you know, club Club Penguin re-written, I guess, is one of those in the complaint.
4920200	4927200	Yeah, they basically are just saying, hey, you guys don't have the right to run these private servers, so stop it.
4927200	4934200	I would imagine maybe they would have let it go if it was just, you know, family friendly fun.
4934200	4941200	But because it's just all sorts of dirty filth and garbage. Yeah.
4941200	4943200	It's got to go.
4943200	4950200	He who is Steven Chat says, well, that's nothing new. It's been a long running challenge to see how fast you could get banned from Club Penguin.
4950200	4952200	But on these private servers, people aren't getting banned.
4952200	4958200	And so it's putting I mean, technically the trademark for Club Penguin and all of that still does belong to Disney.
4958200	4966200	So if Disney wanted to do a Club Penguin movie or a Disney plus thing, which I think didn't I hear the Club Penguin was going to be a Disney plus thing at some point?
4966200	4971200	Like they don't want this shit tarnishing their brand. That's a big problem.
4971200	4978200	Right. Exactly. Because folks don't know, like if there is articles about this coming out, they may not know that Disney is not running this.
4978200	4984200	They're just like, well, it's a Disney game and I'm seeing screenshots of all this filth. I don't want my kids playing that Disney.
4984200	4991200	What are you doing? Why are you allowing this? So, of course, they have to come after it.
4991200	4996200	Yeah. And it's, you know, it's that whole protecting their intellectual property and all that they have to do that.
4996200	5002200	So, yeah. Heaven forbid, Animal Crossing New Horizons, that server ever goes down.
5002200	5006200	That's I mean, people are already doing seedy things in that game.
5006200	5012200	But I guess there's only so much you can do right for now.
5012200	5016200	Anyway. All right. Let's move on. Let's talk a little bit about this.
5016200	5021200	I think this is really cool. A Twitch extension coming out for a game, which Jamie, you've talked about.
5021200	5026200	I really want to play this game. I haven't yet. It's like on my list of I'll get to it eventually.
5026200	5029200	But it's Detroit by Quantic Dream.
5029200	5037200	And Quantic Dream is actually putting out an official Twitch add on that will allow viewers to influence the key decisions in the game.
5037200	5042200	That's pretty cool. That sounds crazy. Yeah. Yeah. It's called Detroit Community Play.
5042200	5050200	And it will allow polls to start automatically in your chat for up to one hundred and fifty different plot points that are in the game.
5050200	5055200	And so your viewers essentially will vote on what should the streamer do next.
5055200	5059200	So you could let your viewers control the whole game if you wanted to.
5059200	5063200	There's going to be a preview of this. I think it's happening tomorrow. Yeah.
5063200	5070200	Tomorrow at 11 a.m. and Quantic Dream is going to do an event on their own Twitch channel, which is twitch.tv slash Quantic Dream.
5070200	5076200	And they're going to show this off. They're actually going to have Brian Deschart and Amelia Rose Blair.
5076200	5081200	Those names may not be married. They may not sound like familiar names, but they are Connor and Tracy.
5081200	5086200	They play characters in the game. So they're going to be demonstrating the extension during the opening scene of the game.
5086200	5091200	So that's pretty cool. And yeah, what they also cost their characters.
5091200	5096200	I love that. That's like what's her name that does.
5096200	5102200	Oh, my gosh. Why can't I remember Samara in Mass Effect? Oh, yeah. She cosplays her all the time.
5102200	5106200	Rana. Mm hmm. I can't remember the rest of her name, but Rana something.
5106200	5113200	Yeah. And somebody got the guy who is Caden's like they got him to cosplay as Kate.
5113200	5117200	And even though he doesn't do the voice, he's just the likeness. It's like a model. Yeah.
5117200	5120200	They got him to cosplay as Caden, too. It's pretty it's pretty fun.
5120200	5124200	And of course, Mark Mears definitely cosplay as Shepard. But Mark Mears doesn't look like Shepard.
5124200	5129200	But it's always fun to see the people, you know, kind of cosplay their characters.
5129200	5134200	Shepard looks how you want Shepard to look. That's true, too. Thanks to Mott.
5134200	5144200	But no, those two together, they actually both stream and they streamed Detroit in costume as well.
5144200	5148200	It was pretty amazing. They're just fun to look at on Instagram and Twitter.
5148200	5154200	You know who else has been streaming a lot on Twitch lately that's been getting a lot of visibility is and I forget her name.
5154200	5158200	I'm sorry, but she's the gal who voices Aerith in the Final Fantasy seven remake.
5158200	5166200	She's and there was a very popular viral clip of her seeing her character and hearing the lines for the first time in the game.
5166200	5171200	Like because, you know, she she doesn't get like a special preview or anything like she went in to do a job.
5171200	5174200	She did the acting job. Thank you. Here's your paycheck. Goodbye.
5174200	5180200	You know, I'm not trying to belittle what is a very difficult career, but that's just you know, you you think in your mind.
5180200	5183200	Oh, and there's lavish red carpet premieres and she gets free copies of the game.
5183200	5187200	Well, she might get a free copy of the game, but she doesn't get to necessarily play it before anybody else.
5187200	5195200	So there's actually a clip of her seeing herself essentially in the game for the first time and she kind of cries and it's it's very touching.
5195200	5199200	And so that's a very popular clip around Twitter right now, too. And I know she's doing a lot.
5199200	5208200	So pretty cool. All right. Well, let's take a step back to classic times when we weren't streaming games.
5208200	5213200	We weren't we weren't running the games online and playing them for other people.
5213200	5218200	We were playing them in the privacy of our own homes for us and maybe whoever else is on the couch.
5218200	5225200	It's the classic game of the week. And every week, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking this game out.
5225200	5235200	And Dark Sakura, you picked something this week that like I have 30 seconds of video for literally.
5235200	5239200	And I I don't hear you for some reason because the listeners here, Dark Sakura.
5239200	5242200	There we go. Sorry, Adam. I was muted. That's all right.
5242200	5248200	I thought I picked like a good long play, but I guess I guess not. Maybe I linked the wrong thing. That's OK. We'll make it work.
5248200	5258200	OK. Well, at any rate, the game in question is actually a series that I'm going over because with the advent of the Turbo Graphics 16 mini slash PC Engine Mini,
5258200	5266200	there are probably people who are seeing this Super Momotaro Densetsu and like, the fuck is this?
5266200	5275200	I can't read any of this, so I'm going to go over some of the some of what this series is.
5275200	5287200	So Momotaro Densetsu is a board game style game where you travel by rail or ship or airplane to acquire wealth through business transactions.
5287200	5294200	You buy properties, you deal with rival entrepreneurs and your nemesis, such as the god of poverty.
5294200	5303200	And it's been complaint compared to Monopoly or Sogoro, which is a game I haven't played, but whatever.
5303200	5311200	At any rate, it was first the series started in 1988, produced by Hudson Soft.
5311200	5316200	And then the rights are now owned, of course, by Konami after they absorbed Hudson in 2012.
5316200	5328200	But the game is is kind of some people think it's a play on a title for another Hudson game, which is another
5328200	5338200	Momotaro Densetsu. So it's a role playing game based on the you know, the the from the tale of the bamboo cutter and other Japanese folklore.
5338200	5351200	But that's not what I'm talking about. So the project supervisor for the series is Sakuma Akira illustration done by Doi Takayuki and the music done by Sekiguchi Kazuyuki.
5351200	5360200	It's been super popular in Japan for an age. It has exceeded 12 million units for this series.
5360200	5373200	And for the 20th anniversary of the series, Hudson collaborated with a company called Choshi Electric Railway Line to create a rail train dedicated to a Momotaro Densetsu.
5373200	5377200	And the train ran until its third anniversary.
5377200	5391200	And then there are two Momotaro themed restaurants in Japan at different rail stations, one at Hijima and the other at Kami Nagaya.
5391200	5410200	So at any rate, it also from 2004, it also had some famous Japanese comedians involved in their marketing, Junai Tomonori and Wakatsuki Chinatsu.
5410200	5412200	So there we go.
5412200	5423200	But sadly, in 2015, the creator of the series, Sakuma, said, I'm announcing here that Momotaro Densetsu is officially done. Ishikawa at Konami squelched everything.
5423200	5430200	However, in 2015, Konami loaned the license to Nintendo for an unspecified amount of money.
5430200	5438200	Seven years, no game until a game was released exclusive to the Nintendo 3DS.
5439200	5450200	And of course, that one on 3DS was Momotaro Densetsu 2017, Taegare Nippon.
5450200	5454200	There was another one before that called Momotaro Densetsu World.
5454200	5460200	And there's also one this year, Momotaro Densetsu Shouwa Heisei Reiwa Motaidon.
5460200	5463200	So there we go. There's a bunch of mobile games.
5463200	5467200	There's an iOS game that came out in 2017.
5467200	5475200	But now this is going to wind me back around to the one on Turbo graphics, or sorry, PC Engine.
5475200	5477200	It was a HuCard game.
5477200	5480200	And it's called Super Momotaro Densetsu 2.
5480200	5483200	It is the second of the Super games in the series.
5483200	5488200	And the third game overall, it was first released on Super Famicom.
5488200	5493200	Both Momotaro Densetsu and Super Momotaro Densetsu were Famicom games.
5494200	5501200	But the games were also released on PC Engine and there's a Game Boy one.
5501200	5509200	And so with this year, again, you're taking turns moving your train around a board to buy properties and trade resources.
5509200	5519200	So you are quite the little business person in this game with a good bit of cuteness and a lot of classic Japanese imagery going on.
5519200	5525200	Of course, trains are very much more popular in Japan, of course, than they are here.
5525200	5528200	It has a big theme in the series.
5528200	5530200	So there you go.
5530200	5532200	You can get games.
5532200	5536200	I'll just go through a list of what the series has been on.
5536200	5549200	So it's been on Famicom, PC Engine, Game Boy, Super Famicom, Sega Game Gear, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, GameCube, GBA.
5549200	5551200	There's Game Boy Advance, of course.
5551200	5553200	We've had Xbox 360.
5553200	5562200	That was Momotaro Densetsu 16 Gold, which is another version of Momotaro Densetsu 16 moving in Hokkaido.
5563200	5564200	We've had DS versions.
5564200	5570200	We have Wii, PSP, Nintendo DS, 3DS, Switch, that new one coming out.
5570200	5574200	There's also been several mobile games for i-Mode.
5574200	5580200	Even when... trying to see what else they are.
5580200	5582200	Yeah, they're all the Yahoo!
5582200	5586200	Keitai, EasyWeb, so Japanese mobiles.
5586200	5597200	And then iOS was Momotaro Densetsu Japan Plus, which came out for iPod Touch in November 27th.
5597200	5604200	So yeah, classic ongoing series and one that maybe not a lot of Western gamers are familiar with.
5604200	5610200	So since for all of us who've ordered our TurboGrafx-16 Mini and are saying,
5610200	5613200	what the hell is this craziness, that's what it is.
5613200	5616200	And I hope your Japanese reading skills are up to par.
5616200	5626200	But I do believe that there are FAQs and translated ROMs out there for those who want to get their hands dirty.
5626200	5628200	Well, thank you very much for that very timely pick.
5628200	5630200	But not any official localized version, by the way.
5630200	5634200	Right, it's an underground one, kind of like the Snatcher one.
5634200	5635200	For sure.
5635200	5642200	Thank you for that very timely pick with the TurboGrafx Mini finally making its way to the US this week after a little bit of the delay.
5642200	5645200	Due to everything else going on in the world. So cool.
5645200	5647200	Everything else going on. That's great.
5647200	5654200	Or there's that visual, all of this. But it doesn't translate well to the podcast.
5654200	5656200	Hands everywhere is craziness.
5656200	5662200	Yes. All right. Okay, let's move on. We got some more stories. We got some fast stories.
5662200	5667200	Actually, at this point, I will be saying adieu for the evening.
5667200	5668200	Not a problem.
5668200	5670200	I missed a few on it, but you might not have seen it.
5670200	5677200	Oh, yeah, I have to. I have do not disturb on right now because my phone has been blowing up. So sorry if I missed your messages, but yeah.
5677200	5680200	So I will say bye everybody.
5680200	5682200	Bye. It was great to see you.
5682200	5685200	Say bye. Cuphead says bye.
5685200	5689200	All right. Bye. We'll see you again next week.
5689200	5690200	One more.
5690200	5693200	Vegeta says bye.
5693200	5696200	All right.
5696200	5698200	Take care, everybody.
5698200	5699200	Bye bye.
5699200	5700200	Stupid. Wear your mask.
5700200	5703200	All right. Bye, Jamie. Thanks for being here.
5703200	5707200	It was great to see Jamie tonight. So. All right. Awesome.
5707200	5711200	All right. Well, let's get back. We've got some more news to get to.
5711200	5715200	We're going to get into some rapid fire news. So, Loki, do you want to start us off?
5715200	5720200	Yeah, sure. So you had another week and yet another con that's been canceled.
5720200	5726200	So Gen Con 2020, the America's biggest board game show, has been canceled.
5726200	5729200	Why? I guess they just didn't want to run it this time.
5729200	5732200	No, of course, it's COVID-19.
5732200	5735200	So they just didn't feel like it anymore.
5735200	5738200	They didn't feel like it.
5738200	5743200	Yeah. So unfortunately, no board game con this year.
5743200	5747200	That is a bummer. I hate hearing about all these cons getting canceled.
5747200	5750200	I know it's inevitable. It's probably going to happen to Dragon Con 2.
5750200	5757200	And, you know, it's it's one of those where it's like, well, it makes sense, but it still sucks.
5757200	5763200	Yeah. So along with that, we've got a delay of something as well.
5763200	5773200	So Kerbal Space Program 2 has been delayed now to fall 2021 because of the unique challenges of developing during COVID-19.
5773200	5777200	I bet. To put it lightly, yes.
5777200	5786200	All right. Phoenix 7729 or excuse me, Phoenix 7726 in chat says, hell, PAX West might get axed this year.
5786200	5789200	I don't want to sound negative, but honestly, count on it.
5789200	5795200	Like, you know, it's it's I would be I would be shocked if it does happen.
5795200	5804200	Obviously, I want to be optimistic. I want to cross my fingers and my toes that we will have a cure and or effective treatment.
5804200	5817200	But prepare for the worst hope for the best, because I kind of feel like if you had a fun big convention or concert or mass gathering plan in 2020, it's probably best to look forward to next year instead.
5817200	5823200	I love the kitty that you get to show off. Oh, Mr. Smoosh, hugging all the attention all this time.
5823200	5829200	Who's this? Who's this precious baby on? This is Stella. Hi, Stella. Sorry, podcast folks.
5829200	5834200	You'll have imagine a very pretty kitty on cam right now. Still, I'm going to say you're going to say anything.
5834200	5838200	No, no, no. Stella's shy. All right. Anyhow.
5838200	5844200	Oops. And of course, with Dark Sakura having left, we just I'm off camera.
5844200	5850200	I know this is one of those things I'll need to fix in a future week. Sorry, guys. We're we're doing it live.
5850200	5855200	No one can see the cat. I know. Hold on. I'll fix this. We can see the cat again. It's just going to take me a second here.
5855200	5861200	You think being full screen readjusting? Well, I was supposed to be doing some rapid fire stories here, but that's fine.
5861200	5867200	You just adjust everything and we want to see the cat. All right. How about now?
5867200	5871200	There we go. I apologize to the podcast, folks, but we're just going crazy on the video tonight.
5871200	5875200	All right. Anyhow, let's get into some other rapid fire news.
5875200	5881200	So first off, the various soundtracks for Castlevania games now on Spotify.
5881200	5886200	We're talking games like Aria of Sorrow, Symphony of the Night. This is.
5886200	5890200	Yeah, this is awesome. So Konami unleashed their collection on Spotify.
5890200	5895200	They announced this on Twitter. There are different playlists that they linked.
5895200	5899200	So, yeah, I think that's really cool. If you want to know the full rundown,
5899200	5905200	we have Symphony of the Night, the original soundtrack, Castlevania Chronicles, Circle of the Moon and Harmony of Dissonance,
5905200	5909200	Lament of Innocence, Curse of Darkness, Aria of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin,
5909200	5914200	the Dracula Chronicles, Order of Ecclesia, Castlevania Judgment, Castlevania Harmony of Despair.
5914200	5919200	How dare they leave out Castlevania 64? How could they? Just kidding.
5919200	5925200	All right. Well, we just all like to forget that along with the Wii fighting game that they had.
5925200	5931200	Oh, God, I forgot about that. I wish I could stay forgetting about that.
5931200	5936200	All right. The Epic Game Store is giving away Civilization 6.
5936200	5942200	If you are not already aware, you should really get on that unless you're like morally opposed to the Epic Game Store,
5942200	5947200	which I understand people have their reservations. But if you are like Epic Games or you're playing Fortnite
5947200	5951200	and you have it on your computer anyway, you really should grab Civ 6 while it's free.
5951200	5957200	You only have a few more days to do it. So it is free until 11 a.m. Eastern on May 28th.
5957200	5962200	So just like they gave away Grand Theft Auto 5 last week, they're giving away Civ 6 this week.
5962200	5966200	And it's honestly like a must have, especially at the price of free.
5966200	5968200	I wonder what next week's going to be.
5968200	5973200	Yeah, there are some leaks out there that called these two.
5973200	5977200	So now it's kind of like, all right, well, since they got both these right, they probably got the rest right, too.
5977200	5983200	And so if you want to believe the leaks, the next game will be the Borderlands Handsome Collection.
5983200	5985200	That'll be a pretty good one, too.
5985200	5989200	Yeah, it's good for people that don't have it.
5989200	5993200	How do you think I feel about Civ 6? All right.
5993200	5996200	Yeah, that's true. I'll just pick it up on the other platform.
5996200	6002200	My problem is I have all the expansions and stuff on the Steam version.
6002200	6005200	All right.
6005200	6010200	Phantasy Star Online 2 is going to be launching on the PC this coming week.
6010200	6015200	It launches on May 27th. I am very excited about that.
6015200	6019200	I've played it a little bit on Xbox One. I'm going to play it even more on PC.
6019200	6023200	So that is very, very, very cool. So I'm hoping some live streams with that.
6023200	6027200	I know Delvin over at VG Realness and I were talking about doing some team-ups.
6027200	6030200	And when we played PSO Blue Burst, we had a shit ton of fun.
6030200	6033200	So I'm really hoping that carries over into PSO 2.
6033200	6037200	I'll probably be starting over, to be quite honest, on PSO 2.
6037200	6044200	Just because I got overwhelmed by everything there is to do in the game.
6044200	6047200	All right. I need to go back.
6047200	6051200	All right. Moving on. The PlayStation 5.
6052200	6056200	Maybe not being revealed in June, they say.
6056200	6059200	We don't know.
6059200	6062200	You know what? That's kind of why I put this in rapid-fire news.
6062200	6064200	Because the extent of this is we've had all these rumors.
6064200	6066200	We've had all these talk about dates and so forth.
6066200	6069200	But at the end of the day, we don't freaking know.
6069200	6071200	And we're going to leave it at that.
6071200	6074200	You got, like, Microsoft's not even doing theirs until July.
6074200	6079200	So I wouldn't expect, I mean, I guess PlayStation could jump out ahead.
6079200	6081200	You know, release the information first.
6081200	6084200	But everyone's in no hurry.
6084200	6086200	Yeah.
6086200	6089200	Real quick aside, I lost my connection to Twitch altogether.
6089200	6091200	Like, I can't see chat anymore.
6091200	6094200	But I show we're still pushing out data to Twitch.
6094200	6096200	But I lost the chat room.
6096200	6100200	So if you guys are there, maybe I can connect on my phone app and find it that way.
6100200	6102200	Yeah, we're so good.
6102200	6104200	God, there's a lot of stuff going on.
6104200	6106200	Oh, you can see them fine?
6106200	6107200	Yep.
6107200	6108200	That's weird. That's just my computer then.
6108200	6109200	All right.
6109200	6112200	Help me relay any good chat comments then while we do these next few things.
6112200	6114200	While I figure out what the hell's going on over here.
6114200	6116200	Yeah, like the dashboard site has gone.
6116200	6120200	If the Mass Effect games come out in Epic, will you get them there, Rob?
6120200	6124200	I already have them on PC through Origin.
6124200	6131200	And as much as I love to triple dip, I don't think I can justify literally two separate releases on PC.
6131200	6135200	However, if they gave it away for free, I might.
6135200	6137200	I mean, free's free.
6137200	6138200	Yeah.
6138200	6144200	And I mean, I don't think EA would ever do that because they have their own platform that they're trying to push with Origin.
6144200	6146200	And they were giving away games on that for a while.
6146200	6148200	So, yeah.
6148200	6149200	All right.
6149200	6150200	All right.
6150200	6154200	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
6154200	6156200	So, Loki, if you want to start us off there.
6156200	6158200	And again, sorry, chat.
6158200	6159200	I can't see you guys right now.
6159200	6161200	I'll try to get back in there as soon as I can.
6161200	6163200	But Loki will have to cover for me until I get back.
6163200	6164200	Yeah.
6164200	6169200	My desktop over here, I think, has completely thought the Internet has died.
6169200	6171200	That's the problem I'm having right now.
6171200	6172200	That is fantastic.
6172200	6173200	All right.
6173200	6174200	OK.
6174200	6176200	So we've got a few things this week.
6176200	6183200	So first off, Minecraft Dungeons on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6183200	6189200	We have Uta, Waru, Mono, Prelude to the Fallen.
6189200	6192200	That's PlayStation 4 and Vita.
6192200	6194200	Wildfire on PC.
6194200	6197200	Phantasy Star Online 2 on PC.
6197200	6205200	Shantae and the Seven Sirens on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6205200	6206200	Let's see.
6206200	6210200	Umehara Kawase Bazuka.
6210200	6214200	That's on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
6214200	6219200	And then Umehara Kawase Fresh on PC.
6219200	6222200	Bioshock, the collection on Switch.
6222200	6226200	Borderlands is a legendary collection on Nintendo Switch.
6226200	6229200	XCOM 2, the collection on Nintendo Switch.
6229200	6234200	And last but not least, Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition on Nintendo Switch.
6234200	6235200	Oh, God, that's right.
6235200	6236200	That's this week, too.
6236200	6237200	That's a huge one.
6237200	6239200	I can't wait to check that out.
6239200	6240200	Yeah.
6240200	6241200	Oh, boy.
6241200	6242200	Oh, boy.
6242200	6243200	All right.
6243200	6244200	Well, let's talk about Japan a little bit.
6244200	6247200	And you guys are going to have to excuse me because I'm reduced to having to work off
6247200	6251200	my phone right now because I'm doing the good old turn it off and on again over on this machine.
6251200	6253200	So bear with me for a little bit here.
6253200	6258200	But I think we can cover some of the release dates on the Nintendo Switch over in Japan.
6258200	6263200	So in Japan, I'm seeing on the Switch, it looks like a lot of peripherals and stuff.
6263200	6265200	Oh, we do get into some games.
6265200	6270200	We have Dairoku Aya Kashimori in a regular and limited edition is coming out,
6270200	6276200	as well as Uta no Prince Sama, Amazing Aria and Sweet Serenade Love is coming out as well.
6276200	6278200	From a company called Broccoli.
6278200	6279200	I did not make that up.
6279200	6281200	That is that is the name of the company.
6281200	6285200	And then Synaptic Drive, also out on the switch this week.
6285200	6289200	And the Zombie Army Trilogy is coming out as well.
6289200	6292200	Taking a quick look at the PlayStation four.
6292200	6294200	We have some similar stories there.
6294200	6301200	We have the Legend of Heroes, Aonokisuke, Umehara Kawase Bazuka is out on the PlayStation four as well.
6301200	6303200	And oh, the Bayonetta and Vanquish collection.
6303200	6306200	I didn't realize that was delayed a little bit in Japan compared to here.
6306200	6308200	But that is coming out in Japan this week.
6308200	6311200	That whole like 10th anniversary remaster that they did.
6311200	6313200	So that's pretty cool.
6313200	6315200	Awesome. All right.
6315200	6318200	Well, how about the UK, Loki? Would you mind taking that over for a minute?
6318200	6324200	So the UK, we've got also Minecraft Dungeons on PC and Xbox one.
6324200	6329200	Slime Rancher Deluxe Edition on PlayStation four and Xbox one.
6329200	6332200	We have the expansion for the Elder Scrolls Online.
6332200	6337200	Graymoor that's coming out on PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC.
6337200	6341200	Ion Fury on PlayStation four and Nintendo Switch.
6341200	6345200	Lovecraft's Untold Stories on Nintendo Switch.
6345200	6348200	We have the Bioshock collection on Nintendo Switch.
6348200	6352200	The Borderlands legendary collection also on Switch.
6352200	6355200	Hard West Collector's Edition on Nintendo Switch.
6355200	6361200	And last but not least, the Zeta League Chronicles Definitive Edition on Nintendo Switch.
6361200	6363200	Great.
6363200	6366200	All right. This is the part of the show where we would do emails.
6366200	6372200	And I think I'm going to get probably just back into it here just in time.
6372200	6377200	Sorry, guys. We have any interesting chat comments to get out while I try to get our our mail up here.
6377200	6379200	I think turning it off and on again helped.
6379200	6382200	But it's going to take me a minute to get everything launched again.
6383200	6388200	Phoenix 7 7 2 6 is the last of us to launches in four days.
6388200	6392200	I don't think so. No, I think I bumped it to June, didn't they?
6392200	6397200	I think it was going to be at some point, but I bumped it to June.
6397200	6403200	So because that was that whole release date update when all the spoilers happened and all that crap.
6403200	6410200	So, yeah, it's not coming out for a while now, I think.
6410200	6417200	Just trying to take a peek and see. I thought it was in the gym.
6417200	6423200	I don't remember. I could look it up, but but you know, it is coming out, though, on the fourth.
6423200	6428200	What's that? We've we've got clubhouse games on the switch.
6428200	6433200	Is that that soon? I'm excited about that. I heard that has like Wii bowling in it.
6433200	6438200	Does it? Yeah. Isn't that crazy? I know.
6438200	6446200	I think that's awesome, though. They should put out like a new Wii sports type thing for the switch.
6446200	6450200	I mean, I know that's not as easy to do.
6450200	6454200	I mean, you can't really play that portable, but. Well, maybe you could.
6454200	6461200	You could play in handled mode or not handheld, but like in that non docked mode,
6461200	6465200	we're just sitting there on this crappy kickstand. Yeah, that's true. You can.
6465200	6470200	All right. I have Internet back on this machine. Yay. All right. Let's move on.
6470200	6474200	Unplugging it and plugging it back in fixes it. Go figure. All right. Moving on.
6474200	6481200	I think my chair got so close it like knocked out the USB for the Internet or knocked it out just enough.
6481200	6485200	Anyway, isn't that ridiculous? All right. Let's get to our e-mails.
6485200	6490200	You guys e-mail us. Participate at orangesontrader.com and we read your e-mails here on the show.
6490200	6495200	As long as they're not like downright mean or offensive or we have like a lot because like there have been some e-mails.
6495200	6498200	I haven't read, but it's because we get a lot of e-mails in a certain week or something.
6498200	6501200	We do have one e-mail this week and I certainly will read it because it's from our power.
6501200	6505200	Why? Why are so let's get to it. It's a long e-mail, but that's OK.
6505200	6508200	It's one e-mail. So we'll do a long one. Hello, L.R.
6508200	6513200	I actually would have preferred to call in at the end of the show about this and was planning to do that.
6513200	6517200	But then I remembered you're not taking calls at the moment. So we'll have to settle for an e-mail.
6517200	6523200	And, yeah, for the for the next little bit, we're not going to be doing the discord part.
6523200	6525200	And that's nothing to do with you guys. You guys are amazing.
6525200	6531200	But now, especially because I'm having to adjust everything on the fly, we have video and all those other elements that are going on.
6531200	6538200	We're just going to kind of encourage you guys to use chat, Twitter and some of these other methods.
6538200	6541200	Obviously, we would hope this world situation does end up being temporary.
6542200	6549200	And maybe in a few more months we can talk about not having to do the shelter in place and we can mix a little bit, just a little bit safely.
6549200	6555200	But right now, yeah, we can't do that. So we have to do things a little bit differently.
6555200	6560200	All right. Anyway, moving to the rest of the e-mail here.
6560200	6567200	During last week's discussion about DDRV, Loki asked why Konami doesn't just port their current Bawani games to PC.
6567200	6571200	Actually, some of their current games have already received or will soon be receiving home versions.
6571200	6575200	However, most of them are very difficult for North American players to access thus far,
6575200	6582200	despite the fact that current arcade versions of DDR2DX and even Ghidodora now feature full English language support.
6582200	6586200	I'll mention briefly, we need to keep in mind that Japan is still their primary market.
6586200	6591200	I can't speak for what would happen if everyone in America had easy access to arcades containing Bawani games.
6591200	6595200	But at this current time, there are many more Bawani players in Japan than in America.
6595200	6599200	So all the products I'm about to mention have only been released in Japan thus far.
6599200	6603200	It's possible to play them in other countries if you're willing to jump through some hoops,
6603200	6605200	but it's not a click click done kind of thing.
6605200	6610200	Currently, there are PC versions of BeatMania 2DX and SoundVoltex that are playable at home.
6610200	6615200	However, because they play very similarly to the arcade game and Konami doesn't want to compete with themselves,
6615200	6617200	neither one is paid to own.
6617200	6621200	2DX requires a monthly subscription that costs about $15.
6621200	6625200	SoundVoltex can be played on an unlimited basis for about $20 per month,
6625200	6627200	though some songs will be inaccessible.
6627200	6632200	You also have the option to pay per play, similarly to how the game works in arcades,
6632200	6636200	with almost the same song list as the current arcade version.
6636200	6641200	As a quick aside, isn't that kind of how Neon FM works on mobile?
6641200	6644200	If I remember right, it's been a hot minute since I've played that,
6644200	6651200	but I remember playing it in the arcade would give you credits to play the phone game one,
6651200	6656200	and the phone game one you either had to buy credits or you could get like one or two a day.
6656200	6661200	Again, I haven't played in quite some time, so I hope I'm not misrepresenting,
6661200	6665200	but that is very interesting about the whole they don't want to compete against themselves,
6665200	6667200	and it does raise an interesting point.
6667200	6673200	But I'm also kind of like you can't really control something like Neon FM the same way on a mobile phone that you do in the arcade,
6673200	6680200	so for me nothing replicates the arcade experience, but I realize I'm changing the argument a little bit there.
6680200	6683200	Speaking of mobile though, let me get back to YYR's email.
6683200	6689200	Also, a mobile version of BeatMania 2DX released last December, called BeatMania 2DX Ultimate Mobile,
6689200	6693200	it actually features the same song list as the current arcade version.
6693200	6699200	You can play using your touchscreen or by plugging in a controller that is very similar to the old official controller for PS2.
6699200	6703200	For free, you can choose from about 100 songs, though like many other free-to-play games,
6703200	6708200	playing songs will drain a stamina meter that takes time to replenish unless you pay to fill it up.
6708200	6715200	You can also subscribe for $4.50 or $9 per month to ditch the stamina meter and gain access to the full song list.
6715200	6721200	The lower tier subscription includes 2 out of 3 difficulties, the higher tier adds the hardest difficulty.
6721200	6727200	Both tiers also give you access to a music player that contains almost every Bamani soundtrack ever released
6727200	6731200	from currently supported games outside of DDR and SoundVoltex.
6731200	6737200	The lower tier only gives you access to 2DX soundtracks, but the higher tier gives you access to all of them.
6737200	6743200	Once again, the game is only available in Japan, but if you're able to access apps from other countries, you're good.
6743200	6748200	Planned for release during 2020 are similar mobile versions of both SoundVoltex and DDR.
6748200	6753200	So, we now have an idea as to what new Konami versions of Bamani games look like.
6753200	6758200	I now ask, are you still jonesing for these, or do these sound like hot garbage to you?
6758200	6762200	Would you be interested in subscribing to one of these if it did make its way to America,
6762200	6767200	or are you turned off by a subscription or pay-to-play model? What say you?
6767200	6772200	Yes, I am turned off by a pay-to-play model.
6772200	6773200	I'm not.
6773200	6774200	I'd rather just...
6774200	6775200	I'm not.
6775200	6776200	I don't know.
6776200	6782200	Because of Neon FM, the way they're doing it doesn't offend me.
6782200	6785200	And it doesn't sound that dissimilar from what you're talking about here.
6785200	6790200	Now, granted, one key thing that's missing that I think would be really cool if Konami did it
6790200	6795200	was that when you play in the arcade, you get coins to play the phone version.
6795200	6799200	Because it's like, you're supporting the arcade version, you're kind of paying there,
6799200	6801200	so you get some plays in the home version.
6801200	6804200	And, you know, we have enough round ones and things like that.
6804200	6805200	I know it's not everywhere.
6805200	6811200	And the current world situation aside, and can you even play it round one anymore?
6811200	6812200	Let's put that on the back burner for now.
6812200	6816200	But I think that's a pretty neat way to do it.
6816200	6820200	Something else to consider, because it didn't come up in the email,
6820200	6825200	Konami has released some of their games on mobile in the US, especially on iPad.
6825200	6828200	U-Beat and Reflect Beat come to mind.
6828200	6831200	And now that I'm saying those, you probably knew that and remember that.
6831200	6837200	Granted, those did not do pay-to-play, but I seem to remember U-Beat only had like two songs.
6837200	6841200	Unless you started buying song packs, then you got a lot more with it.
6841200	6843200	So it wasn't really free-to-play.
6843200	6846200	And then Reflect Beat I think was a similar thing.
6846200	6850200	But I'm not, I don't completely hate this.
6850200	6854200	I'm not sure I would subscribe to the super difficult $9 tier.
6854200	6858200	But I might give it a little bit of money now and then,
6858200	6863200	or especially if it linked up with the arcade version, I would love that.
6863200	6866200	So yeah, maybe that answer surprises you.
6866200	6870200	But I think, again, like Neon FM, I don't hate it.
6870200	6873200	And I think it does something very similar.
6873200	6875200	So sure, why not?
6875200	6879200	Anyway, back to more YYREmail.
6879200	6885200	I'll end by saying that I have no plans to port Super Multitasking to Unreal Engine 5.
6885200	6892200	Sorry if this disappoints you, but the thing I'm using now costs me zero in royalties, even if I make over a million dollars.
6892200	6894200	Sorry if this...
6894200	6895200	Go ahead.
6895200	6900200	Yeah, I was gonna say, you would still, you know, not have to pay royalties anyways with Unreal 5.
6900200	6903200	And I mean, ray tracing.
6903200	6907200	We need it in all the things. I want all of those pixels super shiny.
6908200	6915200	I support YYRE using whatever paper, what do you want to say, paper method, method he wants to use.
6915200	6918200	Engine, he can do whatever he wants.
6918200	6922200	Sorry if this email was forever long. Have a great week, everyone.
6922200	6924200	No, I enjoy the long emails.
6924200	6927200	And you're right, we don't have the calls right now, so we're gonna get some longer emails.
6927200	6930200	And that is all good by me.
6930200	6934200	Alright, if you want to send an email for a future week, please do so.
6934200	6938200	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com is the place to send those emails.
6938200	6944200	We do have a few more stories for you guys before we take your questions from chat, so let's get to it.
6944200	6946200	Loki.
6946200	6959200	So it's like this very short-lived saga that we were talking just literally last week about Doom Eternal getting some controversial anti-cheat update and adding de novo to it.
6959200	6963200	And then just like that, they're taking it out again.
6963200	6966200	So apparently there's gonna be an update.
6966200	6974200	It says, despite our best intentions, feedback from players has made it clear that we must re-evaluate our approach to anti-cheat integration.
6974200	6979200	And with that, we will be removing anti-cheat technology from the game in our next PC update.
6980200	6990200	I think this is a good thing, but at the same time, I always shudder a little bit to think that complaining on the internet actually worked in a scenario.
6990200	6995200	But points were made, you know.
6995200	7000200	It's just de novo. Maybe if they had another brand of...
7000200	7005200	And it super didn't make sense in a single-player environment either.
7005200	7011200	And I think that was the biggest, like, you know, for me, I'm kinda like, well, why is this on there if we don't need the single-player environment?
7011200	7024200	But don't forget the Discord comment from last week that I still think is very good, and that is about, you know, everyone got pissed off at this, but how much other bullshit do you have on your computer running in the background that, you know, you're not getting as angry about?
7024200	7028200	And I think that was a damn good point that was raised, to be honest.
7028200	7032200	So something to consider for the internet mob.
7033200	7044200	Definitely. I mean, there's lots of other games that have shady things to them, or even just, not necessarily games themselves, but just, like, middleware for different things.
7044200	7048200	Yeah. So, alright.
7048200	7055200	We'll see what they end up... I wonder if they're gonna replace it with a different anti-cheat thing, or they're just gonna let, you know, if people want to hack, then screw it, we tried.
7055200	7058200	I'm very curious to see what it kind of looks like.
7058200	7065200	They're just never gonna win. They're gonna have people complaining, like, there's to be hackers in here, and then when they try to fix it, we don't like the anti-cheat.
7065200	7067200	It is a no-win scenario.
7067200	7069200	What do you want me to do?
7069200	7078200	Sometimes what also feels like a no-win scenario is when you buy a game on, say, Steam or Epic Games Store or something, and then it goes on sale the very next day, and it's like, damn it.
7078200	7086200	Even though the same thing can happen in the real world, right? You go and you buy, like, a shirt or something, and then you see the ad, oh, it's going on sale next week.
7086200	7093200	You know, and some stores in the real world will offer you, like, the difference. Like, you can take your receipt in and get the difference up to a certain amount of time.
7093200	7098200	And now we have word of online retailers offering to do the same thing, and that's Epic Games Store.
7098200	7104200	So Epic Games Store is supposed to be streamlining the process of returning and repurchasing a game.
7104200	7111200	So basically what happens is an automated system that basically you return the game, you rebuy it, so you're kind of getting that difference back.
7112200	7125200	So there's actually some emails and things going out about this because what happened, a tweet went out where a guy from a studio actually got a partial refund from a game where the price dropped after he bought it.
7125200	7134200	And it said, you recently placed orders from the Epic Games Store. The price of the game you purchased was recently lowered, so we are issuing partial refunds for the difference.
7134200	7146200	That's a pretty big deal. I got to admit, one reason I've been very hesitant to buy Tetris Effect on Epic Games Store, well, number one, I'm not giving them my credit card information, but I heard you can use PayPal or Amazon Pay or something.
7146200	7154200	You can, and did you happen to claim the free, well, it wasn't granted, you claimed something on there.
7154200	7163200	The $10 coupon, yes. Yes, I did get that, and so I'm really thinking of getting Tetris Effect, but one thing that was kind of holding me back was,
7163200	7170200	well, what if they give that game away next? But then, of course, the leak came out and it's not on the leak list, but what if it goes on sale, but it's on sale now.
7170200	7180200	So I feel like my hesitation there, oh, I feel a little better about it. I think I probably will, probably before the next time we record, I will have successfully double dipped on Tetris Effect and bought that on PC.
7180200	7189200	So, you know, but honestly, those of you that have played Tetris Effect can probably relate, right? It's a great game.
7189200	7196200	So, yeah. Anyway, so that's pretty cool. I hope it doesn't hurt the developers too bad.
7196200	7207200	I hope that Epic is eating a good chunk of the cost there, but I also kind of think if it does add up to the goodwill and it puts more faith in people purchasing,
7207200	7216200	that probably actually will help developers in the long run because people won't be doing what I just admitted to doing with Tetris Effect, being hesitant to buy it because you know it's going to go on sale soon.
7216200	7220200	So now you can buy it with a little bit more confidence, and that's pretty cool.
7220200	7226200	So, alright. Bobby Blackwolf is pointing out Tetris Effect could release on Steam on July 23rd.
7226200	7235200	That is true, but when it does release on Steam, it's probably going to be full price for some time, whereas it's on sale on the Epic Games Store right now.
7235200	7246200	And I'm like, do I need it on Steam that bad? I don't know. Like, it's kind of the same thing to me. I don't really care about the trading cards and the badges and all that stuff anymore.
7246200	7254200	It was the credit card thing that was bothering me, but PayPal, I'm okay with that. So, anyway.
7254200	7264200	vidpower573 says, Alternatively, buy games on the last day of the sale to make sure the game isn't given out for free before you buy it.
7264200	7271200	Although the leak, I'm willing to believe the leak, and it's not on the leak. It seems a little early to be giving that away anyway. We'll see.
7271200	7274200	Alright, a few more stories for you. Loki.
7274200	7282200	Alright, so this is kind of cool. So we've talked about different companies releasing the source code for their games.
7282200	7288200	Now we have EA releasing the source code for Command & Conquer and Red Alert.
7288200	7298200	And this is in the efforts to allow folks to design mods, I guess a little bit easier.
7298200	7307200	So it's basically releasing the Tiberian Dawn DLL and Red Alert DLL and their corresponding source code under GPL version 3.0.
7307200	7314200	I'm curious to see what comes out of this. I love the old Red Alert games.
7314200	7326200	But with the EA and stuff, I'm worried. I'm assuming though with the license that they have, they're not going to necessarily own all of the mods that you make.
7327200	7338200	To me, the gut feeling is that Bethesda, the thing that they were doing with their paid mod marketplace, where something's like, okay, make some cool mods.
7338200	7342200	Now we own all of that stuff. Maybe I'm thinking Blizzard.
7342200	7345200	That was the thing with Warcraft 3 Reforged, yes.
7346200	7351200	So maybe I'm thinking more of a Blizzard on this, but I don't know. It's a good idea.
7351200	7360200	I guess if you're trying to get some more interest into your older games, perhaps maybe we'll see a new Red Alert or Command & Conquer game come out.
7360200	7365200	And this is to kind of get people interested in that. I'm down.
7367200	7369200	Are you actually going to do anything with the source code?
7369200	7370200	Oh God, no.
7370200	7372200	I don't have time for that.
7372200	7378200	This is kind of like, you know, we had that story about the Wii source code got leaked last week and it was kind of like, but what does that really mean?
7378200	7385200	Because there was more this week. I glossed over a story for this week that the same thing happened to the original Xbox and so forth.
7385200	7389200	And it's like, I guess I brought it up anyway, but it's like, really, what good does it do?
7389200	7401200	Now, maybe Command & Conquer, I will say this, Command & Conquer is a different situation because I don't want to get bitched at by those that do have more programming prowess and knowledge and so forth.
7401200	7410200	And probably can make better use of this because of the fact that EA is giving it out openly, then it's a little different than these stolen one situations.
7410200	7418200	The Command & Conquer one, you know, you're in the legal clear to be in there messing with it and doing your own thing and learning from it and so forth.
7418200	7422200	Whereas when we talk about the Wii, the original Xbox, you're not in the legal clear, right?
7422200	7427200	Like the emulator folks have to stay away from that stuff or their emulators get shut down and all that, right?
7427200	7430200	But with Command & Conquer, it is a little bit of a different story.
7430200	7441200	So I'll leave it at, I will say that, but yeah, like for the most part, like most people that read these stories and talk about these stories and tweet about these stories, probably you're never going to look at the source code or make any sense of it.
7441200	7447200	But I suppose for the few people that can and maybe will learn something from it, it is pretty cool.
7447200	7450200	And it is great for an archival type of purpose too.
7450200	7451200	I think that is really cool.
7451200	7458200	It's like, you know, this is a part, you know, so it's like with the source code, there will always be a version of Command & Conquer able to play somewhere.
7458200	7460200	And that's pretty cool.
7460200	7479200	Yeah, it'd be cool like if we'd see, you know, because not so much with Doom per se, but like there's a lot of these games that when they do release like the source code out or release, you know, some remastered version or something for free that they'll also start developing more content for it.
7479200	7485200	Like we've been seeing a lot of these WADs coming out from the creators of Doom and stuff, and that's pretty awesome.
7485200	7488200	I would like to see like more mission maps or something like that.
7488200	7496200	That in turn has helped the PlayStation 4 release of Doom, like the Doom classic, because remember how Bethesda started like integrating the WAD support?
7496200	7500200	Like they're still releasing stuff, which is kind of neat for the classic Doom.
7500200	7509200	And yeah, so you're right, maybe it brings some type of general knowledge to Command & Conquer, or it means in a couple of weeks somebody is going to get Command & Conquer running on a refrigerator.
7509200	7512200	That's okay too. Those are always fun to see too.
7512200	7522200	So yeah, like I remember like I used to mess with the rules I and I file all the time, and that was my, you know, fun with that is because you'd be able to customize units and make them way overpowered and stuff.
7522200	7526200	Just messing with that rules I and I file, I could change all the attributes of all the units.
7526200	7529200	That was good enough for me to cheat my way through.
7529200	7534200	I used to play a lot of skirmish maps, so it wouldn't necessarily be playing through the campaign.
7535200	7549200	But it was a lot of fun though, just like setting up a skirmish map and like having like four or three or four computer opponents and just like dominating a two hour match, even though it's kind of unfair.
7549200	7555200	It's funny you talk about editing the I and I files because even I remember doing that back in the day.
7555200	7562200	I want to say it was for Civilization, the original one, but it might have been another game, but I remember editing the I and I file to get people to say nasty things.
7562200	7571200	You know, like just use four letter words and just swear and do these horrible, horrible things because, you know, I was, you know, 14 years old and super mature and that's what we do.
7571200	7579200	But yeah, I remember even I've done the I and I editing, so for completely no artistic value whatsoever.
7580200	7595200	Yeah, it was always just like, you know, hey, we're going to make Einstein shoot lightning out of his hands or we're going to make, you know, we're going to make the Tesla coils generate electricity and you can place them 20 spaces away from other things.
7595200	7602200	And basically just keep building across the map until you can place one right in the middle of the enemy's headquarters and it just destroys all of them.
7602200	7604200	Yeah, all sorts of fun stuff.
7605200	7614200	All right. Well, last story here has to do with Nintendo rumors and, you know, everybody's kind of expecting Nintendo to do a direct in June.
7614200	7621200	And if you are to believe rumors and things of that nature, Nintendo may not be doing it.
7621200	7627200	Nintendo is saying to third party developers, you don't have to wait for a direct. You can announce your games like usual.
7627200	7634200	Nintendo may be looking at a system to what they just did with Paper Mario for the interim, where they basically announced it.
7634200	7639200	It's coming out in a few weeks and this could be something that we're going to be looking at.
7639200	7641200	Again, this is all coming from rumors.
7643200	7649200	If you want to go far enough, what they're saying out there is Pikmin 3 Deluxe, 3D Mario remasters.
7649200	7653200	We've heard that before and Super Mario 3D World Deluxe.
7653200	7662200	I'm on board for all of that, but again, I'm not exactly going to expect those things, but okay.
7662200	7667200	But you may not get a lot of warning, it sounds like, before this stuff comes out.
7669200	7677200	What do you think, Loki? Do they need to announce things way in advance or do we live in a day and age now, especially with digital distribution, where it's like, okay, it's coming out in six weeks. Enjoy.
7677200	7687200	I just think people are getting kind of hungry for game announcements because it is kind of getting towards that time of year where we would expect to have a lot of those.
7687200	7692200	I like a lot of the announcements and seeing some of this gameplay and in-depth stuff.
7692200	7693200	Sure.
7693200	7696200	Yeah, I'm a little disappointed that they're not doing a direct.
7696200	7698200	We don't know. Rumors.
7698200	7700200	Allegedly a direct, yeah.
7700200	7709200	I would love to see some announcements like that, just to hear about more things rather than just a Twitter video announcement or something like that.
7709200	7714200	It would be cool, but I get it if they're not going to do that.
7714200	7722200	You know, I have to be honest. I feel like they could do it the way they did it with Paper Mario and they would completely get away with it because at the end of the day, the Switch is still selling like hotcakes.
7722200	7725200	Animal Crossing is the world's favorite game right now.
7725200	7736200	Every, you know, I feel like Nintendo is in a great position. They can kind of do what they want and it doesn't matter, except one key thing that I think kind of screws this whole thing up, investors.
7736200	7747200	And I feel like they're the ones that are putting on a little bit of the pressure where it's like, okay, Nintendo, Animal Crossing is the shit. It's doing great.
7747200	7751200	What's going to come out next? And we just don't know.
7751200	7763200	And so for that reason, I'm a little bit like, I don't know if Nintendo can really do this long term. It might be kind of like the thing they do during this COVID situation, depending on how long that plays out.
7763200	7773200	But I just don't see Nintendo doing this as long term strategy because I feel like investors are going to hate it. But at the same time, investors have to be loving the profits that are being made right now.
7773200	7785200	So, can Nintendo rewrite the rules in that department? I suppose so. I don't know. Anyway, one other thing that should be mentioned, Bayonetta 3, it is not canceled.
7785200	7789200	So it was reaffirmed this week. Yes, Bayonetta 3 is still being worked on.
7789200	7790200	Who thought it was canceled?
7790200	7793200	I don't know who thought it was canceled, but you know how Twitter is.
7794200	7806200	Are we going to, with that assumption, are we going to think that Metroid Prime 4 is canceled too? Because, yeah, they announced it super early, but I didn't think it was coming out this year. I mean, I don't know.
7806200	7818200	So, good point from Mr. Shio100Matt in chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network who says we were supposed to get an announcement on that ARMS character in Smash Brothers Ultimate. Then again, that was talked about in a pre-COVID world.
7818200	7826200	So you're right, we were supposed to get some other further announcement on an ARMS character, but who knows how everything has been changed because of what's going on in the world.
7828200	7830200	And that ARMS character is Waluigi.
7832200	7834200	I wish. I so wish.
7834200	7843200	They should add him to ARMS for just no reason whatsoever. And then that's what the announcement is going to be is that, you know, he's coming to ARMS and therefore he's coming to Smash Brothers.
7844200	7854200	I love it. It's time for our listener round table. If you have any questions in chat or comments, we would really love to hear them over at Twitch.TV slash VOG Network.
7854200	7858200	In the meantime, I will turn to Loki and ask if he has any last minute stories for us tonight.
7858200	7871200	I do have a couple of things. So because Pac-Man's 40th anniversary is happening now, it makes sense that there's going to be a Pac-Man 40th anniversary edition micro player.
7871200	7880200	So My Arcade is doing their little 40th anniversary cabinet that they're putting up for $40.
7881200	7887200	Interesting. I already have one of those My Arcades for Pac-Man. It's over. It's off screen, but it's over in my collection.
7887200	7890200	They're good. They're good little, you know, devices.
7891200	7893200	40 bucks seems like kind of a lot of money though for that little thing.
7894200	7903200	They're 35 for the others usually. The My Arcade, those machines are a little bulkier than the arcade classics and those are the ones that go over 20.
7904200	7907200	Maybe it's 30 they usually go for. Anyway, I want to get some quick comments from chat.
7908200	7914200	Sia Tabiri says, sorry for sounding like a broken record, but have you seen any interesting Twitch collaborations recently?
7914200	7922200	I watched a set of six drag queens with Twitch channels playing Deceit, a mix of Dead by Daylight and Werewolf last night and it was super interesting.
7923200	7929200	Seeing them support each other so much, really promoting each other's channel and interacting in the ways they did was such a fun time.
7930200	7938200	I personally didn't see that. I have heard about those types of collaborations. I want to collaborate with my friends and do some cross promotion and fun things.
7938200	7947200	That's when Twitch works great. That's when Twitch works right. I think it is great. And I love like streamers uplifting each other and so forth.
7948200	7958200	And it is interesting how drag is more and more showing up on Twitch, not just because I think, you know, folks are finding it's a great way for expression and show forth on Twitch.
7959200	7967200	But with all the bars and so forth being closed, there's so much of these like virtual performances and things that are being done online right now.
7968200	7976200	Think how hard it is for, you know, you name it, you're whatever RuPaul's Drag Race queen, they can't tour bars right now.
7977200	7982200	You know, especially these queens that are on season 12 and All Stars 5, because I know that's all the rage on TV right now.
7983200	7991200	And I'm sorry to dive into RuPaul's Drag Race chat, but it is take your favorite whatever that relies on in person stuff.
7991200	7999200	Like it's, it's hurting right now. Like these season 12 queens should be able to tour the country and make money off their television appearance.
8000200	8009200	They can't. These All Stars 5 queens, same thing. They're going to be in the limelight again, especially queens we haven't seen in a long time like Anjaina and Jujubee can tour, but now they can't do that touring.
8010200	8019200	And so that really sucks. But the virtual streams is a way to do it. I would be curious if they're making nearly as much money on a virtual stream as they were doing in tips.
8019200	8030200	But something's better than nothing, I suppose. So anyway, sorry to deviate a little much there, but I thought that was a good question.
8031200	8040200	Hype Mayhem says, do we need a Bayonetta 3 at this point? Hell yes, we do. Of course we do. I love Bayonetta. I really want to see a third game. That'd be awesome.
8041200	8042200	Any other stories, Loki?
8042200	8055200	Um, yeah, so I was going to mention also that we also got a video this week of some more stuff for Lego Super Mario. So they showed that they're going to have different power ups for it as well. So they have the cat Mario.
8056200	8068200	Um, they have that hammer brother Mario and then the fire flower Mario as well. So they're going to sell those add ons as well. August 1st when that comes out. So that was kind of neat.
8069200	8076200	Uh, yeah, it looks awesome. The other thing I saw too, was that the announcement that a Final Fantasy 14 starter edition went free on PlayStation 4.
8077200	8079200	I heard about that. What a great time to jump in.
8081200	8085200	Yeah, that's only for a few more days, right?
8085200	8093200	Um, yes, I believe it's, uh, let's see here. It is going to be ending, um, May 26th. So yeah, I got a couple more days.
8094200	8101200	Yeah. And that is the base Realm Reborn game. So it's none of the expansions because that's where they're going to get your money is if they get you hooked and then you get the expansions.
8102200	8111200	Uh, and 30 days of time to play for free. So if you've been curious or you want to dip your toe in the water, I mean, now's a great fricking time, but there, there's a reason for it.
8111200	8120200	They have a plan to get money out of you, but I, you know, I talk about Final Fantasy 14 a lot on this show. I love it as an MMO. It's, it's, it's worth a look in my opinion.
8121200	8128200	Um, but I, I understand the cost can put people off, but here's a way to, to take, take a look in the door free for 30 days at least.
8129200	8142200	Mm hmm. Um, what do you, I forgot to mention that's coming out this week in the U S is pong quest. That was something else that's coming out. Remember that, that pong game that was, uh, like an, like an adventure type stuff.
8143200	8152200	And they have all the callbacks to different classic Atari games in there. So that's, I totally forgot. That was the thing I, now that you're mentioning, I'm like, yeah, I think there was a story on that a while back. Well, that's cool.
8153200	8154200	See, see if that is fun.
8155200	8169200	So yeah, that's pretty much it. All right. Well, uh, I guess that's going to do it for another. Oh really? Oh, sorry. Late breaking news. And this is important. SSJ 100. Matt says, uh, it sounds like team ketchup may have won splat fest.
8169200	8183200	I'm so glad splatoon did a do over on that whole thing. So that the right team could win in that scenario, because I believe mayonnaise won the first time. So I'm very, I'm very glad a justice prevailed on the redo.
8186200	8196200	All right. Anyhow, uh, that's going to do it for another, uh, episode of orange launch radio. Thank you guys so much for tuning in and participating with our show, whether it was live here or not.
8196200	8207200	Twitch TV slash vog network. Or even if you were listening on the podcast feed, we love you all the same. All we ask here at orange launch radio, tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
8208200	8219200	But if the voices aren't here to put out over the arrow and can't, can't put your voices up. So, uh, tell a friend or two about the show auto hosts on Twitch. Even if you don't like to stream yourself, they still go a very long way.
8219200	8230200	It's a great way to like, tell your friends. So host vog network, uh, super appreciate that. And, um, yeah, a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever you found this show goes an awful long way. So thank you again to everybody.
8231200	8238200	And, uh, hope you guys, especially on the Twitch side, I know the podcast didn't see a lot of changes this week, but on the Twitch side, I hope you guys enjoyed the webcams.
8238200	8267200	Well, this week was about getting them added next week. It will look better. I'll have more time to play with it and set up the different shots. Now that I know like what the limitations are. Uh, so next week we'll hopefully look a little better on that front and we can get used to this for, cause it's going to be at least, I mean, I don't know. I, yeah, I don't know. I, I, I, I feel uncomfortable even putting a date out there. We'll be back together when we can be back together. But until then we'll do this.
8268200	8275200	So, all right. Um, that's it. I think it's about time to get a final thoughts. Uh, Loki, you want to start your final thoughts tonight?
8276200	8287200	Uh, yeah. My final thought is I'm glad that we've got tomorrow off for Memorial day. And also we, we have to wish, uh, Rama a happy birthday. His birthday's today.
8288200	8301200	I forgot it was today. Happy birthday, Rama. Oh my gosh. I know so many like late may babies. Yeah. Happy birthday, Rama. Uh, Shane from the who's on the show all the time. His was yesterday. So happy late birthday.
8301200	8314200	Yeah. So lots of, lots of late May. And then my friend Amanda's right around this time too. My old roommate. Yeah. Lots of late May people. I know. So yeah. Happy birthday to all you late May's folks out there. Um, that's it. That's going to do it for us this week.
8314200	8331200	We'll be back. Oh, my, my final thought quickly. Um, I need to play my turbo graphics mini already. Now that I'm done with LARP stuff, I can do it. And, um, I downloaded and played the tutorial and I'm going to play a little more immortal combat Excel.
8332200	8343200	I did do that this week and I didn't talk about it in my gaming week cause I only did the tutorial, but so we played that. Um, we, we, we're going to do some co-op on a Minecraft dungeons later this week.
8344200	8359200	Hell yeah. I can't wait to play Minecraft dungeons. Hell yeah. I want to play that for sure. I hear it's short. There's so much stuff this week. There's Minecraft dungeons, PSO2, uh, Xenoblade Chronicles. Like this is a great week for gaming despite this crappy world situation.
8359200	8369200	So, um, enjoy it guys. Have a great time gaming this week. So, all right, we'll see you in seven days to talk all about it. All right. Have a great week, everybody. Good night.
