Alright, hanging in there throughout all this?

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah, doing my best.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah, did you take the kids anywhere exciting? A park or I guess there's just not a lot to, I'm like, what are you going to say? I took them to a trampoline park? I don't know. I'm just hoping there's some exciting story.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
No, they're over at their grandparents house right now.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh, that's good. That's good. Quality, quality, quality time and all that is good. So, alright.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I also want to welcome back to the show this week. Say hello, everybody. Give a warm welcome to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hi.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Hello, welcome back.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Thank you.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We missed you.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Happy to be back. What did you throw?

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Hot pot of coffee. No, I'm just kidding. So I told the listeners what was going on. I don't know if there's anything you want to say about it, but obviously the floor is yours if you wanted to say anything or say nothing at all. I can go to the next topic.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Well, I, I felt it would be good just to give some background and bear it a little bit, you know, because it's been, I haven't really been too super up and up on the whole scenario because my dad is in Alabama and I'm not here in California.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So I will, I'll go a little bit into not too much detail, but enough detail. How's that sound?

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Sure, whatever you're comfortable with.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Well, um, about, had it been right before I got my current jobs maybe five or six years ago, my dad had a stroke in his 50s.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He had done a lot of drugs, it was the 70s and he likes drugs capital D drugs to quote, Dennis Leary. I'm sorry, Dr. Dennis Leary.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And so, as it stands, you know, lots of hard living can catch up to you chain smoking.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I mean my dad cheated death, a lot when he was a teenager and early adult I mean he crashed his motorcycle so many times, I'm sure he's hit his head more than a few times.

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So, he had a stroke.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
He nearly died. My, my youngest sister gave the resuscitation order for him, and he was never the same after that.

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:37,000
He was paralyzed on one side, he was doing better for a while and then he just, because he, some of his brain function had been decreased because of the stroke and a consequent, you know, you know you have another, you can have another stroke after you've had the stroke

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:49,000
so, so he wasn't getting, he had clogged arteries his heart was a mess. I mean, my dad was, I don't know he was being held together with duct tape and chicken wire, as we like to say back in the south.

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Like some computers I've used. So, like the OLR studio computer Yes. Yeah, no that one's shiny and new. I'm proud of that little.

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Well, remember there's two, there's there's the new one that powers the video and the old one still powers me and my stories so yes.

38
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah, oh girl we need to get you upgraded. It's the most well and it's all I mean folks have been kind enough to send upgrades but it's the most Voltron PC you'll ever see in your life of old shit and new shit, like duct tape together.

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Anyway, I'm sorry, I don't mean to do right now. I'm sorry, you've now inspired me to, to write like a fan story of like duct tape Gundam. So, filing that away.

40
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Done.

41
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
All right, so anyway.

42
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So my dad.

43
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He and I never did see eye to eye he was you know, Southern pretty, you know, to him it was normal for everybody else who has a conscience, it's racist, homophobic, you name it and by the way, hype mayhem vehicle Voltron is my favorite don't listen to.

44
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So, and necessary 100 miles says the show PC is now called duct tape Gundam, I approve.

45
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah, I second motion passes. Anyway, back to topic.

46
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The way that you know things when is it my dad eventually is his attitude got worse and worse he was moved from, you know, one place to the other, he had to have a total hip replacement last year, and then you know my granny died, five years ago.

47
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:36,000
She got well not five years ago, gosh, three and a half years ago because she died right after grandmama did you remember I was a mess up for that, I remember this all happening because obviously this show has been around and you know, again, I want to remind

48
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
people, it is a video game podcast but because you know the family that we've built up here on Sunday nights.

49
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You know, we've all gone through a lot of deep stuff in our lives so sometimes this podcast is a way to kind of share that with you which is what Jamie's doing now, but I, I remember because of this show, when all that was happening because it was, I feel like you

50
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
had you had to deal with a lot like back to back to back relatively. Oh yeah, I was in some hardcore therapy after that.

51
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And just for anyone who's wondering I have an appointment with my shrink scheduled for next week. Thank you.

52
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Anyway, um, but you know after granny died.

53
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Dad got significantly worse and my sister Shelley was taking care of dad's needs and in mobile.

54
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And she was having to drive in from Foley which was, you know, like an hour or so drive into mobile to take care of dad but she did it every day and she's a high school teacher.

55
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So kudos to my sister Shelley you are amazing and I know she's not listening because she doesn't do video games.

56
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But as things go.

57
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The show that I was last on being the week before last.

58
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm sure as people notice during the show I vanished. I was like, I all because I got a call from my sister, saying that dad was in the hospital with respiratory issues.

59
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And of course the first thing that everyone thinks is the code. Does he have the, you know, the ronas.

60
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And so she couldn't even go in to see him after he was in the hospital, and dad had a very strict DNR do not resuscitate order, so that he couldn't be intubated they there was going to be no ventilation form or anything if he was going to die he was going

61
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
to die.

62
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And as it turned out, he didn't have coded and one of the nurses, very graciously pulled some strings to get him in a private room, so that we so that my sister could have an hour visit with them, they basically she got two visits, one with him for an hour

63
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:51,000
visit and then the other one when it was about time, and my mother went with her mom my dad had been divorced for, you know, since I was nine months old.

64
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So, yeah, divorced for a very long time, but, you know, my dad, I'd say that losing mom was dad's biggest regret and mom knew it and you know she and my daddy were best friends until they got married.

65
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So anyway.

66
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It turned out to be a bowel blockage and and kidney failure, and he did the surgery they didn't think he was going to live through it and my sister made the decision.

67
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
After consulting me she didn't just say oh nope, bye.

68
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:41,000
She and I decided that we were just gonna take daddy off of the, the heart medication that he was on the blood pressure medicine to keep his blood pressure up.

69
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And so they expected him to die on Monday.

70
00:08:47,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And then when Shelly went in my mom went in I videoed with my dad, and he woke up off of the morphine that they had him on long enough to try to open his eyes and wave at me.

71
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And something was something very similar happened with my mom, for what it's worth. Yeah, yeah, it was very significant. And then, but him being the stubborn jerk that he was.

72
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I can say this because he's my dad, and he was a stubborn jerk.

73
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Hold on.

74
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
He did not die that morning, as he was expected to.

75
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And he did not die the next day, as he was expected to.

76
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:38,000
He held on. And so my sister went in one more time with my mom and and dad, he didn't wake up for any of that he was already on his way down.

77
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:47,000
They weren't making fun of his feet to try to get them to wake up because dad was sensitive about his feet and sent me the worst picture of his tone I was like I don't need to see that.

78
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But anyway, I digress because I'm now just remembering everything that went down with it. But anyway,

79
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I said to Shelly, you know, hey, call me whatever time it is and keep in mind, I was in training now for my, my position at work for the rotation that I'm doing that you know could be a pretty big promotion for me so I was already nervous.

80
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah, she was already had a lot on her plate and getting still recovering from the pneumonia that I had. So I get a call around two in the morning for me for central time where dad was, and he, he died.

81
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So, I was, I think I'm pretty grateful that I was so exhausted because I was still on my sleeping pills at the time.

82
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And I passed right back out so I think that sleep was a good buffer for me.

83
00:10:46,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But then I had to, you know, go to work, I could have taken my, my bereavement time, then, but I'd worked so hard for that and I could just think that my dad would be like, nah, nah, nah.

84
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And the funny thing too is that when I got my senior position at my previous position that I was in Rob, not saying where I work.

85
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
That was when granny died and I didn't get to take any bereavement for that.

86
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And you know, like I can't get a promotion because then family will die.

87
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But with the, with the state of the world being what it is, you know, you can't eat, you really go back to Alabama, either to, you know, see people and, and, you know, have that grieving together so.

88
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And while I could technically fly.

89
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Mobile County has the highest infection rate in, in Alabama. And I think it's exceeded, like, one of the Mississippi counties, although Mississippi is pretty terrible, because you know the state motto of Alabama is right.

90
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
We ain't Mississippi.

91
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Okay.

92
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So at any rate, um, yeah I, and on top of that I'm still on like that level one to two quarantine where I'm not exactly safe to go out because they don't know if I had COVID-19.

93
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And if I did, I could be susceptible to reinfection or carrier. And if I think it would be worse if your body was still recovering from another thing and then you get COVID it would be, that would be a very bad thing.

94
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You know how sick I was with that pneumonia I was, I mean, well I'm sure all of our listeners remember me like, I've got to go.

95
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But at any rate, um, yeah I wouldn't be safe to fly because if I haven't had it then I'm, I'm in susceptible list because I recently had pneumonia.

96
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And now I have asthma that I haven't had you since I lost all that weight so go fig. But yeah, so we're going to do something later on, I mean, you know how I feel about everything.

97
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:05,000
History has taught us there's going to be a second worst wave. But I'm going to leave that where it is. I'm probably sure I'm not going to go be able to get out to Alabama to have any kind of memorial until next year.

98
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And I'm pretty sure that I am not going to DerpyCon if they have it this year. I'm not doing any traveling. I'm gonna, I'm gonna stay put.

99
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You gotta take care of you. Nobody's gonna fault you for that.

100
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh yeah and Shelley and I talked about it and she's like, you know, I'm not really, I think ready to do anything to she's still teaching school through all of this, and my youngest sister is a hot mess.

101
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:45,000
We won't talk about her, not as bad as my brother who is unrelated to her. My brothers are not related to my sisters. So, let me, let me ask you about this, because this is something we were kind of having a text message exchange about and you know

102
00:13:45,000 --> 00:14:00,000
bringing this story I mean obviously this this OLR and everybody here that listens week after week, whether it's live or whether it's on the podcast feed you know we're a family and so we're here for you if you need, especially when you've been robbed

103
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:14,000
of getting to do some other type of memorial because of this whole situation like you know, ain't nobody gonna fault you for venting, but, yeah, you and I had an interesting text message exchange, where you've kind of talked a little bit about

104
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:25,000
the grieving process and how your love of Animal Crossing, which is no secret around here, has helped you through that. Can you, can you elaborate on that a little bit like what we were talking about.

105
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Absolutely, absolutely because I knew, I knew we were going to get there. So, this actually goes back a little bit before dad went into hospital is, I've been playing Animal Crossing the whole time I had pneumonia like religiously like I'm talking nine hours

106
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm talking nine hours of play a day. And my, my really good friend who is in chat and I she's, she's been a little public about it I'm going to go to into detail but hi Gwen finara and chat.

107
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I, well I made a little cemetery in my in my town. I put one, because the Zen stone honestly I like it better the, you know, it's a Japanese gravestone. And I put one up for for grandma and granny.

108
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I put one up for Dan's mom who, you know, I said she she died at the beginning of the year so I'm sure you can already think about how things have been. And I put one up for Gwen's mom, because I have fond memories of her mother, and I loved her to bits

109
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:42,000
and she was really kind to us when we had to evacuate during a hurricane when we were all in college Gwen was my college roommate. And so I wanted to do something for her mom, because I know that the anniversary was coming up.

110
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And then, when, when dad died, I was just like, I didn't even think about it, I took one of those, I went and got the mats for a gravestone.

111
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And, yeah, she said she built a huge garden for her mother.

112
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But I, I had a stone set up for daddy, I put, I put a black lily in front of it and I was like, that dad wouldn't have liked black lily so I've got incense in front of all of my, my stones I'm actually kind of using instance a little bit as, as my

113
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
as my in game yard site candle, although I think I'm gonna put.

114
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I've been putting a candle out by by that grave I set for my dad.

115
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Every Friday for for Shabbat, as my, my art site candle I mean, there's been one Friday.

116
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But, but I put one out when he died, and I have, but it's, it's still the fact I'm sorry I don't mean to catch up but it's still the fact that Animal Crossing is like that, like that you, you go through the motion in a game is just it's it's fascinating

117
00:16:49,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and you're definitely not alone like I assure you girl you are not alone because we have our chat room over it of course, and I got to plug this some point twitch.tv slash vog network voice gigs network, where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific

118
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby black will show and you guys chat along. And we've got a lot of, you know, obviously support in there for you.

119
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Our dear Marissa, my therapist knows all about Animal Crossing.

120
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Probably not just from you on Bobby black will says, Animal Crossing is great for a lot of this stuff pod culture saying Animal Crossing has been great for my depression.

121
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I've got something related to their interest next to the stones in the Memorial Garden I set up and I was going to tell you, I, I set something up for my mom in my town.

122
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And you know that was she passed in 2017 so this is a while gone.

123
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yeah, I've been struggling in Animal Crossing in the creativity department like I go to some people's towns like dang I mean like your town.

124
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Everything is laid out you got your town square it's it's beautiful you got all these things, my town I'm kind of like, I'm just adding. I'm, I'm taking the the painting that was already given to me and just adding my own little flourishes.

125
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm taking the village layout and just, oh, I want to do this here. Oh, it is here. And one place I did, I, it, the spark hit me when I saw that Nook shopping had the Mother's Day mug available for time.

126
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I was like, I have to do something with that. And so I did and I set up behind my house. There's a little stone wall and there's a little I have the Zen stone because I don't have the other one but I kind of like the Zen stone at this point, and I have

127
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:37,000
When I get a DIY I'll save it for you. I have the little mug right next to it and then I have pink and black roses, and the black roses are kind of for me, the pink roses are kind of for my mom because I, we had rose bushes when I was younger so I always remember

128
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
attending the roses anyway, not to make it about me but just to kind of share with you like, me too.

129
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
We're all doing it. We're all doing it.

130
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And I linked, actually I was talking to one of my newer friends, Annie who is one of the amazing co hosts of Stuff Mom Never Told You and Saver.

131
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You know, and I've mentioned this podcast plenty of times on the show.

132
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:13,000
But, you know, just talking about a little bit and there's an article that's from the order of good death.com called exploring grief and Animal Crossing, it's really a good read I'm going to link it.

133
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:25,000
But you know, I think that because we are all distance like this and we can't be with our families, and we can't, I mean there's people that did die of COVID.

134
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
They're not, they're not allowed to have any family around them they can't see the body.

135
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You know, and if they're having very small surfaces. And so, this is the way that you can do something quote tangible, right, something that you can look at and interact with in some way or another.

136
00:19:48,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And, you know, I'll put it this way I do have my art site candle in real life for my dad, you know, and for those who don't know, you know, got a few a little bit of my Jew crew here in a chat, but the yard site candle is a candle that burns for 26 hours,

137
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
and you light it on the anniversary of someone's death their yard site.

138
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But I've been lighting one, I've lit one quite a bit often for just to remember the victims of COVID-19 and our governmental stupidity.

139
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And now I've got got them for my dad.

140
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And, you know, I'll, you know, have a little swig of the manage habits and and say, say, cottage for my dad even though my dad would probably, I don't know I never told him that I converted to Judy.

141
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So, he probably would be, I wouldn't say, you know, spending in his grave, he'd be breakdancing in his grave. Again, hashtag relatable because my mom was very adamant, I don't want a funeral, I don't want a headstone I don't want a memorial.

142
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I want, you know, she she wants her ashes scattered in a very particular place. And it was cremated. Yeah. And so, so it's kind of one of those Oh my going against my mom's wishes but I'm like, my mom hated video games and she's not going to find out about this, and this is

143
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
sometimes you do something. This is more for me. And I think she'd understand that.

144
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I think she would but yeah, but you but you would hear that Rob you're playing that game.

145
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Absolutely hope I did your mom justice with that.

146
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Let me, let me read some other hashtag relatable comments.

147
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I got my therapist playing Animal Crossing.

148
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Crystal skies and chat says my therapist also knows all about Animal Crossing.

149
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:53,000
My office has been coming together and Animal Crossing as well. Marissa says my therapist is going to get an Animal Crossing and a switch for kids now so they can socialize.

150
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Well you know we've already talked on previous episodes about just what a huge like you know cultural milestone this game has been, and certainly not for the reasons that it wanted to be.

151
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You know, it's just the right game that released at the right time, you know, and yeah, it's weird.

152
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It's weird to think, would it be like this, if it had released in a normal world I don't know it's it's, we don't know we'll never know, still pretty sure Animal Crossing would have been big, but it was.

153
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It was timely, not not on purpose I mean people like Oh conspiracy theory blah blah blah tinfoil hat would have.

154
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:39,000
But I think that interest that it was the therapy we needed when it came out. Oh, for sure.

155
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:50,000
A very interesting observation by Bobby Blackwolf and chat that's worth calling out here. Nintendo keeps putting out these cultural milestones. Remember everyone going out and being together for Pokemon Go.

156
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:59,000
If you want to get technical I mean Pokemon Go is a Niantic game that they just kind of lifted Nintendo's IP for but, but technically Game Freak right.

157
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You're right you're right the Pokemon Company which is, you know, but anyway, but, and I'm going to give you this. It's because it was Pokemon that that game was so popular so yes I mean if it hadn't been Nintendo slash Game Freak Pokemon

158
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Companies. If it hadn't been those particular characters I don't think it would have caught on the fire that it did, even though technically it's Niantic game so sure, we'll still give Nintendo credit for that, because you know that observation yeah

159
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Nintendo, Nintendo really does seem to hit a lot of these cultural milestones of sorts, you know, and with Animal Crossing and how we all dealt with it during coven we're gonna remember that for a long time.

160
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Well, and to add in other things with that too. When Pokemon Go came out, it actually has helped several friends of mine with social anxiety and full blown agoraphobia.

161
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:57,000
You know, because it was kind of like you had your centered little bubble but you were still out, and it got people out and involved and, and, and that.

162
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And another thing too, as I was talking, actually looking through some information for reference, you know, we have a good number of other online games that are really playing into the social distancing.

163
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:31,000
People in, you know, because people still play Sims 4 in Animal Crossing and even like Second Life are using those games to celebrate Ramadan, which, for, for those who observe Ramadan with Iraq, I hope I said that right.

164
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And I was gonna say Jack, Jack box is the huge one too.

165
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Yeah, even though that's not like a simulation game like the everything goes to name like certainly jackbox in the Oh, here's the thing we can play online virtually and it's like when it's, it's very easy for everybody to like not everybody has to have a PlayStation

166
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:59,000
not everybody has to have a copy of the game because it's very easily streamable, and this whole Oh you just play through your mobile phone over the internet makes it like super easy like I would imagine.

167
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Like I'm not I'm not going to pry into jackbox financials and again, I don't think any of these companies, you can talk about evil corporate greed all you want.

168
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I don't think Nintendo or jackbox games ever wanted to be in this position. But, but they are. And so I bet jackbox is making noodles noodles off of this situation.

169
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Nintendo to be rather an ethical company because I mean think about what I think it was you want to who did it that he took a pay cut when Nintendo was suffering so that his employees could be paid fairly.

170
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I remember that during the Wii U, I remember that during the Wii U era Yeah, exactly. So, but you know, there's also, I think, and I'm really hoping that this isn't you know just becoming a breeding pit for the worst of.

171
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm just going to throw it out there, toxic masculinity, that we've got more online matches in multiplayer games.

172
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You know, I'm hoping that the more.

173
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I'll say non cisgender men are able to go in and play their favorite online games and those environments as well without having to suffer. You know, the EP for lack of a better description, you know, and you know what I'm talking about it's it's not a good place for women.

174
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It's interesting because I think since Nintendo often gets written off by the masses as the kitty product, the little kid product that toxic audience tends to stray from and again I fully recognize I am painting broad strokes here okay and nothing is easily sort of won't call me or call me, but that audience tends to stay out of the Nintendo games because it gets written off as a kitty product.

175
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And so, in some ways I think that kind of helps lend it to why it is part of all these cultural phenomenons because it feels a little safer because that toxicness has these other has these other places to go.

176
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And again, it's not to say Nintendo is free of toxicity and all this other stuff I'm not that ignorant, but smash again in in broad strokes, like, Nintendo tends to be that safer place for a broader audience.

177
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Well, you know, I remember I was playing a crap ton of Mass Effect three multiplayer, but I would only play with people I knew.

178
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And I would not play.

179
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
If I, if we like joined in on any matches, I would not play with my speaker on. Yeah.

180
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I just, it's like the moment when a non cisgender male joins in, in a game like that the moment they find out that there could be a vagina involved.

181
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:57,000
You know the the hammer comes down and we shouldn't have to put up with it it's absolutely disgusting and especially in this day and age with everything going on and just the general, I'd say social trauma that we as an overall society are experiencing.

182
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:08,000
We need to have this outlet and people need to be less shitty about it. Yeah, that's all I'm gonna say there, you have to wonder if something in the world situation isn't going to challenge, some of that.

183
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
But anyway, that's, that's a much deeper topic we've gotten a lot of topic I'm sorry.

184
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
But, but going back, let's do the car.

185
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:30,000
People are using their games as a means of communication as a means of getting out their stress, and in my case, your case, Gwen here, we're we're working through our grief in Animal Crossing.

186
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You know we're working through our grief in a very, I would say healthy way there and there is and this is the last, I'm really going to go too much into the grief thing there is a TED Talk that it gave me a lot of help when, when Grandmom and Granny died I know I linked it to you Rob to watch.

187
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And I'm gonna, I'm going to put it in chat, but I'm going to try to find out who it was that did it because I always forget her name, but it podcast folks won't see the chat so right that's why I'm gonna say, you know, look for it, but it's a TED Talk about closure.

188
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
And it talks about.

189
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It's by Nancy Burns brns.

190
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:26,000
But it's a really good conversation about keeping your grief grief with you as a part of you so that you don't separate it from the memories. And I think that's what we're doing with Animal Crossing, you know what I mean.

191
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:44,000
We are, we are putting our grief out there in a way that others can share it with us we're keeping it fresh in our hearts, but it's also helping us to reconcile that sadness with the joy it could bring us you know what I mean.

192
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Absolutely. So, and we tie it into the things that we love to keep that close to us.

193
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:56,000
So, I've had some time to think on this. No, you're fine you're fine you know and just as you know Animal Crossing has helped us through a lot of that.

194
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:09,000
This show has helped us through a lot of these difficult moments in our lives so it's, it's, it's good to have you back to our soccer I'm glad you were feeling up to coming back tonight so a hearty welcome back to you.

195
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:29,000
18 years almost. Yeah, been a lot. Unbelievable, unbelievable. And I was hoping, I was hoping by the time our 18th birthday rolled around, because we're sitting, we're sitting on new art and new intro and like a whole like makeover for the show, we're just sitting on it, because the idea was, oh, that would be a great way to come out of this

196
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:41,000
COVID situation the social distance recording is like, we're back again and here's all new coat of paint and all this stuff but now it's like as the time goes on it's like well, maybe we'll just have to roll that out on the 18th anniversary because we just we don't know

197
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:52,000
when this is going to be passed I mean I don't know it seems like things are getting I get I guess I shouldn't go too far into the topic we don't know.

198
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
So we have to play it week by week.

199
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And, you know, I think that. And now I'm going to get all like ridiculously sappy and everything. Okay, that you guys have been just a delight, a joy in my life.

200
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And I think without the show I probably would have been a lot more lost yeah I mean yeah I had to take the week off of it because I mean and I'm even still doing it, I just don't trust my voice when I was in training I hardly said anything publicly,

201
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:30,000
you know, you know, in our, in our training chat which I'm all doing this online, you know, that.

202
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:49,000
But coming back to the show is, I think, one of my big steps in in facing it and dealing with it and trying to trying to, I'm not gonna say muscle through, but trying just to bring that into a part of the person that it makes me well and get some

203
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
sort of normalcy back in a completely abnormal world.

204
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Well, I don't believe normal is always in flux. The only constant is change, right, fair.

205
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
This is our normal. But when you've been doing something 18 years it's kind of normal.

206
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
You know what I know it. No, I know what you mean.

207
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Yeah, so I mean I'm gonna say look at us. Look at our other fellow podcasts.

208
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Look at her.

209
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
But look at how we've all adapted.

210
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:34,000
We've got discord now for doing our show other folks are using Skype. I've seen some on zoom or their, you know, videos streaming you know with the crazy backgrounds and everything.

211
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I think it's absolutely amazing that we have the, you know, could we have done this 10 years ago.

212
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Would we have paid out the nose for life through life 365 to do it.

213
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Could we have done it 10 years ago, maybe through Skype, but is that the way well and and here's the thing and I, as, as convenient as like discord is for doing this show and it's great because it allows us to still get together we can get that creative

214
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:13,000
energy out we can still do this show and it kind of gives us what we need. I am going to be honest, I still don't like it as much as I liked us all being here, but I realize that just can't be the case right now.

215
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It will be the case again someday.

216
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
We'll get we'll get there, week by week.

217
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Oh great now I've got that song stuck in my head.

218
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Some day, somewhere, nevermind.

219
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:36,000
It's Bob rush he's like butter. Yeah, Bobby says the majority of podcasts actually were done over Skype for the past 15 years very, very few were done in the same room.

220
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I think you meant like over 10 because when you invoke life 365 see in that era when we were doing dialect radio. I'm not sure Skype would have done as well but yeah most podcasts are done over Skype, but I think what kind of has made or zoom whatever

221
00:33:48,000 --> 00:34:01,000
you want to insert there. I think part of what's made this show special is the fact that we're all in the same room. And I can also say, I don't like doing the distance recording, but we're going to do the distance recording, so we can still have this show

222
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
because something's better than nothing.

223
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Absolutely, absolutely. And, and you know, with all of this, you know, I, and any fellow podcaster listening to this show live or recorded.

224
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Kudos to you keep doing it keep your voice out there we need, especially our into you know our independent podcasters and the people who are out there saying important things that people need to hear.

225
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Don't, don't let a virus stop you keep using you know doing it this way do it however you need to. It could be really difficult, it could be super easy for you but the fact that you're doing it is what's important.

226
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Absolutely.

227
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Keep on keeping on.

228
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Yeah, put that art out there because in this really crappy situation and podcasting is a type of art. I know a lot of people like to, you know, speak negatively of it.

229
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I'm not going to stand by and let that happen. It is a type of art, it's a type of expression.

230
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And as crappy as these times are the best thing that's going to come out of it is the art is the Animal Crossing creativity, the the things that help us to grieve and all of that that's going to be so don't, you know, keep podcasting and keep keep making art, whatever

231
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:26,000
it is, if you paint, if you, you know, keep it, keep one of my favorite movies ever is pump up the volume. Mm hmm. And just the fact that I mean it was you know the 90s with shortwave radio, right.

232
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:42,000
But I always think that that might have been one of my biggest inspirations that led me to love doing the live radio, and then going into. That was why when I had the chance to you know do under sedation with y'all and fill in for for Jessica and be like the constant guest.

233
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I jumped on it. And then when we did our show, I knew I had found the thing that I mean, if I could get paid for doing all our hell yeah, but I know no don't talk crazy now.

234
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:07,000
We got paid yet so I don't think we will so whatevs. But at any rate, that's that's my whole my whole thing. Everyone out there keep using your voice. Please keep using your voice.

235
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Also PS. I played with Gail Simone and Animal Crossing so I feel like I've had my, my ultimate nerd moment, the end. Congrats. All right, Loki is still with us.

236
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Sorry. It's been a right it's been it's been like you totally ran to the other rumors I know it's like, it's, it's been a good 30 minutes of venting and chatting but it's it was needed.

237
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:41,000
It was child wrangling. This is group therapy. All right, we are going to get into some gaming news though because video games are the way that some of us you know cope it's a, it's an art form as well.

238
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And some of us cope through Animal Crossing. Others of us like to play games where we shoot demons in the face right Loki.

239
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Sure. So, Doom eternal courses, you know, one of the big games that came out and march around this wall exactly at the same time as Animal Crossing.

240
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:10,000
And it was met with pretty good reception you know that pretty positive reviews and everything and there weren't really any issues with it.

241
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:23,000
That is until they decided to update it and insert de nouveau anti cheat, because everybody loves de nouveau I mean the copy protection scheme that doesn't really work that well.

242
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And on top of that, they had actually with this now being put in there and I guess to stop cheating but there really isn't a whole lot of like online multiplayer.

243
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:51,000
It's really just the battle mode that they have where it's basically to one player versus to two players playing as like some sort of demons, which I don't know if there's been a lot of cheating in that per se but it is something that they put in there

244
00:37:51,000 --> 00:38:00,000
and now folks aren't really happy about de nouveau anti cheat being in there because it gives kernel access to this program.

245
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And it's basically leaving it open to be exploited in some way to gain access to your system now, of course, it's come out saying that Listen, this is only running when the game is running and it's, you know, not going to stay persistent in your computer.

246
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:48,000
But, you know, so folks don't really like that. However, apparently de nouveau is working with the team with, you know, the behind Doom eternal to see if there's a way to get like some sort of separate launcher for the single player offline play, so that it would allow you to play the offline portion single player, which a lot of people are doing is just playing single player, and being able to do that without the de nouveau anti cheat and only enabling it if you're playing some sort of online portion of that.

247
00:38:48,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Which I think it's a decent compromise, it still kind of sucks. And then of course, along with that, as folks tend to do, I got review bombs pretty bad on steam. So now it's mixed instead of very positive.

248
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Oh, good old review bombing, you know, a way to way to take a stand internet.

249
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Show them. Yeah, well, they're making their voices heard. I mean, it sounds like that they hear them. So I don't know some interesting commentary because this topic came up in our discord server this week.

250
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:32,000
So of course, we have a discord server like a lot of your favorite podcasters and broadcasters. And you can find it over at vog network.com. That's vog network.com slash discord will get you the invite you need to get in there.

251
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And there was some really interesting comments, I want to relay some of those comments on the situation. metal mayhem on discord said, here's my take. On one hand, I can understand wanting anti cheating measures. Over the past 17 years of playing games online, I've seen all too many cheaters and that annoyed the fuck out of me.

252
00:39:49,000 --> 00:40:05,000
TF. At the same time, I can't stand intrusive programs being installed on my PC. That's one major reason why I like buying games on GOG versus steam when I have the option to do so. And let's be real here, anti cheating software and DRM doesn't stop folks from doing what they're going to do.

253
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:27,000
All it'll do it all it'll do is slowly delay it. And in the process, annoy everyone else. Here's a comment from 13 x forever 30 forever who said, Why exactly is this bad? Besides the general FUD about the F, I think F us maybe about the potential of exploit by a third party.

254
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:44,000
You have 10s of drivers running with the same privileges, for far more dubious reasons or needs. iTunes installs 10 year old driver to be able to rip audio CDs and no one bats an eye. Some game company installs the drivers is being constantly developed under a high pressure to fix any issues ASAP, and the internet's losing their mind.

255
00:40:44,000 --> 00:41:09,000
There are valid reasons to reject the notion of such updates, but people are focusing on all the wrong aspects of this. One more here from Tiger Claw. I just want to say, though, I like that comment because it does shine a spotlight on why is it always the games that get all the press about this when there are so many other products on your computer and he he named an audio software, but there's all other types.

256
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:26,000
But I think that in those situations where people find exploits like that, they are brought up. It's just it's not necessarily something that, you know, you might be paying attention to. I don't think that people are silent on that when there is an exploit like that. They're just as up in arms about it.

257
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:49,000
It's just this tends to be like, do you know, do you know, but doesn't tend to work correctly and it sends to get defeated pretty quick and causes all sorts of issues, I think, with the game. I don't know necessarily specifics, but I know that, like, even with this launching, I want to say that I thought they were supposed to be putting Denuvo anti piracy in there and they accidentally shipped it with basically a

258
00:41:49,000 --> 00:42:14,000
DRM free executable for some stupid reason, because probably because Bethesda. But I know like other companies that have used, you know, I believe have been the it's been defeated pretty fast. So I don't know. I think the overall consensus is that the negatives outweigh the positives of it.

259
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:30,000
But I mean, you'll see, I don't think there's really a strong online to it. Maybe this is just kind of a precursor before they launch like a legitimate multiplayer deathmatch type thing or something that I can see.

260
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Maybe they're just getting the kinks out with this one online mode first, because then I can see that the need for this. But for just like the simple one versus two mode, I mean, I guess there would be.

261
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I mean, I assume there's gonna be cheaters everywhere, but I can't imagine that it's gonna be that rampant.

262
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Let me read one more comment from Tiger Claw here from Discord. I don't really like the stuff that's being installed in the background. One of the issues might be that it would slow down your PC if it's constantly running in the background.

263
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:10,000
There would be cases where having such things could affect system performance when you're gaming on a PC. For example, it could potentially eat too much of your system resources and use up a lot of memory. This is basically a form of DRM.

264
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:26,000
So yeah, lots of negative feelings about this software. I think for me, I understand why companies kind of have to do the anti-cheat thing. To an extent, I understand it because people are gonna cheat.

265
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:35,000
And you see it run rampant in almost any online game, especially ones that don't have these sorts of protocols in place.

266
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:46,000
But on the other side, I also completely understand that Doom Eternal also has a one-player mode, and some people just want to play the one-player mode, and have no interest in playing online with other people.

267
00:43:46,000 --> 00:44:00,000
So why are they being subjected to this as well? In that aspect, I understand why this is very annoying, because it's for a part of the game that I don't really have an interest in.

268
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
But, I don't know.

269
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I mean, we'll have to see. According to you, I think it may be just kind of a knee-jerk reaction to anti-cheats in the past. Basically, a lot of them used to hook into the file systems, start up with your OS and that kind of stuff.

270
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Whereas, maybe this isn't as intrusive, but I don't know. I don't have Doom.

271
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:40,000
And I'm gonna just totally throw something kind of lame-brain out there and fully admit it, but my gut says, you know, this is America. We love to sue people in America.

272
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Could it be that these things getting installed on a computer when people don't want them to, let's say it gets exploited or whatever, let's say there is an exploit and somebody gets into your computer because of this anti-cheat system, could there be a legal ramification with that?

273
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Or, I mean, I know, hold on, because I know what people are going to say is up, but you accepted that end-user license agreement, and when you accepted the license agreement, you agreed all that stuff.

274
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And I kind of figure, like, sure, I understand that. Is that really going to stop a lawyer from a class action lawsuit? I don't know.

275
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I've also seen those types of license agreements challenged when it's like, nah, nah, you don't get to get out of it by doing that. You know what I mean?

276
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Like, when Sony and the PlayStation issues they had and all that stuff. Anyway, go ahead, Loki.

277
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
But the company...

278
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Oh, sorry, Jamie. Sorry.

279
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Yeah, one thing that the company does have the right to protect the experience that they sold to people, you know, they advertise the game a certain way, that certain things would happen, that certain protections would be there, and this could indeed be their way of enforcing it, right?

280
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Yeah, it's like, it's why I'm not, like, completely against the anti-cheat thing, but I do feel to some extent the company needs to own it if that software is what is used to exploit your computer.

281
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:06,000
But then again, we have the Discord comment that makes an excellent point. You have a ton of shit on your PC that could probably be used to exploit your computer. So...

282
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:16,000
How are you going to pinpoint it to, you know, what exactly it is? I don't know. Yeah, I'm sure people will calm down after a while.

283
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:27,000
All right. All right, well, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week, whether we were using mods or anti-cheat systems or what.

284
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Darsaka. Real quick, I was going to say, that's the thing that would actually concern me is sometimes I like to cheat my own single player experiences.

285
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:42,000
So is this going to prevent me from doing that? That kind of takes away some of the fun.

286
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Excellent question. And Bethesda in some ways has embraced the mods, like in the old Doom, right? Like, that's the big reason why they have these new...

287
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Yeah, I'm like, it is interesting. Like, you know, I think there's definitely assets and positives to modding and so forth. So you ask an excellent question.

288
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Like, if this disables the ability to mod your PC version of Doom Eternal, then that's kind of a bummer. You know, if you want to do that, as long as your modding isn't distracting from the experiences of others.

289
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I think that it's sort of like the bad apple scenario where they're saying, well, one could be used negatively, we're going to ban them all.

290
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Where like with what BioWare did with Mass Effect is like, if it's not affecting the multiplayer experience, do your high res mods, make Shepard wear whatever you want her to wear, you know?

291
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:39,000
All right. Anyway, good point, Logie. Let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week, Doom or otherwise.

292
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Darsaka, how was your gaming week?

293
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Animal Crossing.

294
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I guess we kind of got into that earlier in the show. Anything?

295
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Yeah, I really haven't played anything else. Oh yeah, I was going to say, and I've told you all about this game a bunch of times because I have Apple Arcade and I have been super into playing Patterned.

296
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:03,000
And they released a bunch of puzzles and some of them are what I call hell puzzles.

297
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:12,000
But basically, in a nutshell, what Patterned is, and it's set to like, if you want the music, it's like really gentle background piano music.

298
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Just really gentle in background and kind of relaxing and calming like you're by a stream, you know, but you get different, your entire picture is a tiled picture with different, you know, patterns and designs on it.

299
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:41,000
And you have different blocks of a different size that you have to bring in to match over a piece of the artwork. And it starts off as line art and fills in more gradually as you fill in more of the pieces until you have the complete puzzle.

300
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:50,000
And they let you download it as wallpaper. If you're playing on on one of your mobile devices or playing on a computer.

301
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I've even used one of these wallpapers for, you know, one of my own little projects.

302
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:08,000
But at any rate, I have been playing a good bit of that it's been just really good for for kind of having like a distraction for my brain because I need to be doing a couple of things at once.

303
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:23,000
And if I if I stopped in this was last week of course if I stopped to think about anything that I was going to go crazy so it's been really good for just, you know, keeping, keeping me steady it's nice and chill you can play it on your phone you play on your tablet

304
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
you can play it on your computer I'm playing it of course on Mac because it's Apple arcade.

305
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:40,000
But it's a game that I super love, um, I really haven't opened anything else I haven't touched Pokemon I haven't touched the Harry Potter game.

306
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:50,000
It's just really, I've just been so stuck in Animal Crossing land because it's been, it's been like my, my, my blanket my blankie.

307
00:49:50,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Although I am finally considering if my other if my gaming computer will keep up with it, I'm finally going to take the plunge on Detroit become human, because I love that game.

308
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
It's beautiful.

309
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
So, yeah, that's my gaming week.

310
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Excellent.

311
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Loki, how was your gaming week.

312
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
So I played a little bit of Minecraft with my kids.

313
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I played more step mania stuff, I was loading on some new songs and I finally found the eight 20 songs so put those in there and played some of that today.

314
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:38,000
So that's fun. And of course lots of Orna. And I think that was it. Yeah, I think that's all I played this week.

315
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Okay. Um, so for my gaming week I'm still going on the regulars like Animal Crossing and Final Fantasy 14 and the mobile stuff like you know Ingress Pokemon Go and let's say the Orna and all that stuff.

316
00:50:51,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Let's see, uh, new stuff though. I probably the biggest thing that I checked out that was new on the Nintendo switch they released the mobile game Elder Scrolls blades, but now they're reporting it to consoles originally it was supposed to be out on like

317
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:13,000
every console and mobile. It's taken a while for them to do that and I don't even know if that's still the plan anymore, but the switch version came out.

318
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:26,000
So I was like, what the hell it's free. What do I have to lose, so I jumped in and played it a little bit. There's a lot of people out there I noticed on Twitter and stuff that don't like this game, and it's buggy because it's a Bethesda game, it hasn't been like super

319
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:33,000
buggy for me like I might get a frame skip issue here and there, but Bobby was talking about on his show tonight and it's on his Twitter over at Bobby black wolf.

320
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:44,000
He had this like, like he can't even use his right joystick. It's so damn choppy like I didn't have any of those issues but it's interesting how buggy the game can be from one system to another.

321
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:53,000
His theory is that it has to do with running the game off an SD card. I don't think mine is doing that but I don't know that it's not either but anyway I'm, whatever.

322
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Um, I don't hate it like I read all that they hate that people have for this game out there and I'm like this is a little strong. I don't love it either. I'm not going to die on the hill for this game.

323
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:18,000
It's a really like dumbed down version of Elder Scrolls, and I mean dumb down like it's really simplified but sometimes it's kind of like what you need, like Elder Scrolls, there's a lot when you can touch every book and every piece of fruit and pick every flower

324
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:27,000
and all that stuff so like in some ways like not having all of that overload my senses with like, I need to collect everything is actually kind of nice.

325
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Um, so it's kind of like a dungeon crawler sort of thing you're basically like going through these like pre rendered dungeons and killing a couple mobs and you know that the battle systems very simple it's kind of like slash with the left hand slash

326
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:54,000
with the right hand slash with the left hand cast a spell it's kind of it's very, again, it's very simplified. And then the whole point is that you're like restoring this city, so it's basically a city builder game with some dungeon crawling built into it.

327
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Again, I don't hate it, it was a, it was a fair use of a couple hours, maybe not probably not even that long maybe an hour and a half that I was playing it.

328
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I just wish the damn thing had a map. I can't believe here we are in the year 2020, and I'm playing a video game without a stinking map, like, what what is up with that.

329
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:24,000
And don't throw the whole well video games didn't used to have maps. They've been doing maps and video games since like the original Legend of Zelda probably before that, quite honestly, Elder Scrolls has maps in their game.

330
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Yes, exactly. So like the what the fact that it's missing from this one is really irritating. But otherwise, it's, it's okay. Like, I don't hate it. I think I don't understand why people like really hate it.

331
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I do hear though that they've changed a lot since it originally released for mobile that they've done some changes and now here we are releasing on switch. This is the first time I've experienced it so some people might be basing their perceptions off the original version of the game and that that could explain why maybe sometimes

332
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:07,000
some people hate it and I'm like, I mean, I get that it's buggy and it's really simple and it is a free to play game but I don't think it's like the worst thing I've ever played in my life I've played far worse games that I paid money for.

333
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:26,000
So there's that. But yeah, Elder Scrolls Blades. It's, it's okay. Put that on the back of the box. All right. We're gonna get into some gaming news here. I do want to mention some quick stuff during housekeeping because Bobby was mentioning this on his show tonight and I think this is an important thing to bring up.

334
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:49,000
So every year. Well, I shouldn't say every year but for the past couple years. The voice geeks network has sponsored a show out in Atlanta, that is similar to like our California extreme out here you know where they do all like the, the old, old school machines pinball machines and arcade machines they kind of rent a hotel ballroom and the whole things on free play for a weekend.

335
00:54:49,000 --> 00:55:14,000
There's a thing like that out in Atlanta, the Atlanta area is not actually not in the city of Atlanta, but it's called the southern fried game gaming Expo, I must say game room but I think now it's gaming Expo because they try to incorporate some other stuff into that as well but southern F FGE, they have canceled for the year 2020, which I'm sure won't surprise anyone with everything that's going on in the world a lot of big conventions are canceling.

336
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:28,000
But here's the thing. We've talked about this a little bit with why is dragon con still happening. Why is packs still happening Why are these companies saying that these things are going to happen, and long story short, it has to do with contracts.

337
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:57,000
They could be in a breach of contract essentially, if they just cancel because unfortunately pandemics for whatever ridiculous reason is not one of the like acceptable reasons to cancel a contract. However, if the city or the state government steps steps in and says, Oh no, you're not having this gatherings of 500 plus people are banned here, then you can enact a clause in the contract known as force majority.

338
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:14,000
And you basically get to cancel but you get to recoup the money invested because now it's not your fault the canceled basically. So most conventions This is why dragon con hasn't canceled yet. This is why packs hasn't canceled yet, because that type of stuff is not going to happen until two three months out before this all happens.

339
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:39,000
So for everybody that's on dragon cons page posting, I can't believe you'd put the public at risk. Wait, wait, if you want to blame something, blame the legal process. Okay. But here's the thing. Southern fried game room Expo, they they have canceled because they're in a part of Georgia where there is no legal clause to have such big gatherings.

340
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:54,000
So they are caving in to that pressure and doing the right thing per se, by not having a mass gathering of people at their own discretion. And unfortunately, that means they are going to be financially liable.

341
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:13,000
So if you're able to if you're in the south east area, if you are the type of person that would usually go to these types of things, please consider supporting for getting your 2021 ticket, or they're going to have some shirts online and some of the merch that they probably would have sold this year will be available online instead.

342
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:27,000
If that is the type of thing up your alley, I would encourage you to get on there and support that because, you know, they did do the right thing for public safety, even though technically, there was no government mandate for them to shut down on that.

343
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:45,000
So I just want to give them a shout out of sorts. The interesting silver lining to that, that whole thing, for me is that, you know, with all this time off, I'm saving, and all this flight credit, I'm going to have if Dragon Kong ends up getting canceled, I'm going to have more flight credit.

344
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:54,000
It's one of those weird things where it's like, well, I might be able to go to this in 2021. Usually I'm like, oh, no, I can't do two trips to Atlanta over the summer. That's too much. I don't have that kind of time.

345
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Well, with everything that's happened this year, I guess the silver lining is I'm going to have everything banked for next year. So no promises yet because we don't know what the world's really going to look like in 2021.

346
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:16,000
We don't even know if it's going to be okay then, we hope, but, you know, but the interesting silver lining is that maybe I can go in 2021, but I hope you all will support them and do the right thing and all that.

347
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:25,000
So, okay, let's move on and get into some gaming news and the headlines of the week. Loki, you want to start us off?

348
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Yes. So one of the news bits that was part of the summer of gaming or whatever the hell we're calling it now, they had an announcement with Tony Hawk talking about the remaster of Tony Hawk one and two.

349
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:52,000
So that's pretty sweet to see them basically going to be remastering those two games. They're trying to get the same tracks from the original soundtrack.

350
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Not sure if they're going to be able to get all of them, but they're going to have the original skaters and looks pretty awesome.

351
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:07,000
So that would be coming out September 1st, I believe, or September 4th. And yeah, so what to look forward to that.

352
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:17,000
And then, of course, along with that, because obviously it's been a long time since these games have come out and, you know, Tony Hawk isn't as young as he used to be.

353
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:24,000
So what's kind of fun is they're actually going to have the pros that are in the game are actually going to be aged as well.

354
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,000
So he's going to tell you, Hawk will look like he does now and as will the other pros in there.

355
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:39,000
So I think that's pretty cool. Dad's going skateboarding. Yeah. I wonder if they'll get like other does Tony Hawk have kids?

356
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I imagine he does. Yeah, you got it. You got to wonder if those kids sometimes are like, Dad, you're embarrassing me.

357
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Do you think everybody thinks that about their dad?

358
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I guess that's true. And then at the same time, it's like, child, that skateboarding is paying for your college.

359
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:03,000
These three masters are going to pay for that. So I guess you can't be too critical. Did you hear his record got broken?

360
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Oh, no, I didn't. Yeah. Like an 11 year old kid finally pulled off a 1080.

361
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,000
OK, well, but does but does that cheapen the Tony Hawk brand?

362
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:18,000
No, but I'm just saying that like the thing he like was kicking his ass to try to do a kid beat him finally.

363
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:27,000
But it kind of brings things back to that legacy that he's kind of done to true, you know, and it's like, you know, I realize skateboarding is not in the Olympics,

364
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:38,000
but I think people in Generation X and especially subsequent generations, we kind of start to look at skateboarding and those types of things that were like the X Games when we were like in our early 20s.

365
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Right. Like those are kind of like Olympic sports to us. So and the reason why I say that is because, like, you know, if an Olympian has a record beaten, you still kind of remember like the heyday of that Olympian.

366
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Right. You know, like, yeah, like Mary Lou Retton in the 80s or something like that, you know, like that was that was crazy how she was everywhere.

367
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,000
And I don't even know how I wanted her legs or what. Who's I wanted legs like that.

368
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Who's more modern? Who's the swimmer guy? Michael. Michael Phelps. Michael Phelps. Yeah.

369
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Or there's. I can't remember her name now. Who is the runner? Jackie Joyner-Kersee is on the tip of my tongue. No, no, no. Oh, but I can't remember showing my age.

370
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Oh, and then there was also like for, you know, the the figure skating world, Bonaly, who, you know, just to piss off the judges, did a backflip.

371
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Oh, yeah. Isn't there some documentary about her? It's fascinating. I think so. I remember watching all that figure skating stuff growing up because, you know, hello.

372
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:47,000
And I remember I was totally into it. I think her name was like Sophia or so something. Sonia. Sonia. Yeah. Sorry. Sonia. Sonia. Yeah.

373
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Sonia Bonaly. So. So anyway, sorry to interrupt. No, you're fine. Only here at O.L.R. can we relate Tony Hawk Pro skateboarding to figure skate discussion.

374
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:07,000
So there was. So what's kind of cool, though, is this is being done by various visions. So they're the ones behind the Crash Bandicoot remakes.

375
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:15,000
So one of their goals was basically to have the game still feel like the original game.

376
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:21,000
So all of the not necessarily bugs, but like kind of quirks of the original game and everything.

377
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:29,000
What's kind of cool, though, too, is apparently if you did like, of course, they're trying to push pre-orders and stuff. If you wanted to do that, you get to actually play.

378
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:36,000
They have like a kind of a demo release thing that they're going to put out. That's the I can't remember the stage is called.

379
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:43,000
It's the warehouse, I believe, that you can actually check out and stuff. I don't know. It's pretty fun.

380
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Yeah, like I'm kind of into it, too. Like, you know, I don't think I really got into the Tony Hawk games.

381
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Like I remember games like Skate or Die and 720 in California games and those like I'm going really old school there, but I didn't really get into the Tony Hawk games.

382
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:08,000
But I think I think they'd be kind of fun to revisit. I kind of be down. Yeah. Dad, you're embarrassing me.

383
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I'm just picturing dads across the nation picking up these Tony Hawk remasters and playing them all over again. All right. Cool. All right.

384
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Well, moving on, let's talk about some big gaming news from this week. That is the unveiling of the unreal five engine.

385
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:30,000
That's right. A PlayStation five tech demo was shown off for the unreal five engine, which was announced in one of those streams that they're doing for the summer game fest.

386
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:38,000
So this was like they did an interview with Jeff Keighley, because you remember how I was being a little bit like isn't summer game fest like just news announcements?

387
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:44,000
But this was actually something produced by them because Jeff Keighley was involved to sit down interview and they really hyped it up.

388
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
And, you know, they hyped up this interview. It was a mystery thing. And then they did it.

389
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:56,000
And of course, some Twitter people were like, that's it. And I'm thinking in the back of my mind, I'm like, do you know how many of your games are powered by unreal engine?

390
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Like this might not seem like a big deal, but it's a very big deal because this is what the future of gaming is going to look like.

391
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:08,000
And they showed a little video and I'm sorry, I don't have it here for our Twitch viewers, but I'm sure plenty of you have seen it.

392
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:19,000
It's a it's a don't call it Tomb Raider, but it sure looks awfully similar of this, you know, gal who's running through tombs, I guess, and, you know, running cliffs and jumping.

393
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:26,000
And it's very smooth. It's 30 frames a second, but 1440p, it looks very good and, you know, kind of has me hyped.

394
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I'm like, OK, all right, this looks really cool. You know, this is how they're pushing, you know, graphics and so forth.

395
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:41,000
So, yeah, they did that whole unveil that game, that demo that they showed, though, even though they say it is playable, it is it is not at this time a game.

396
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Sometimes tech demos turn into games like we play.

397
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Was that what it was on the weed that was just basically like all their tech demos?

398
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Yes. E3 demos or the three, two, one, one, two, three switch.

399
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:59,000
That's like all their tech demos thrown into a game to switch and whatever that one to do this game.

400
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
One, two. Why aren't you ever on sale? Yeah.

401
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I still want $40 for this game. One, two, bundle it in already. All right.

402
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Anyway, but so that's not to say it couldn't ever be a game, at least that's not the plan at this point anyway.

403
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000
And that's you know, that there's a lot of stuff that never becomes a game.

404
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:25,000
The Final Fantasy six, when they did it in 3D back in the day, like that whole demo in Nintendo 64, like that never became an actual thing.

405
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
So not everything becomes a thing anyway.

406
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,000
So they showed this off, this demo, and it's got some oohs and aahs.

407
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,000
And yeah, the Unreal Engine 5, it's coming out next year.

408
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,000
So that's interesting because that means the games that are going to launch on PlayStation 5,

409
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Xbox Series X are not going to be in this, which it's not like that's the only engine out there.

410
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Many companies have their own in-house engines that they build.

411
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:55,000
So that's fine. But it's interesting this is going to be there at first.

412
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
That is going to be something that they're working on.

413
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,000
It should be pointed out that there is Unreal Engine 4.25.

414
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
So the current Unreal Engine does support next generation hardware.

415
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
So that's not to say there won't be anything in Unreal.

416
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,000
It just won't be in Unreal 5 until after this is out, as you can imagine.

417
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,000
The other big news about Unreal, and I think this is a big deal,

418
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:21,000
the royalties are now waived on your first million dollars in game revenue.

419
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,000
That's right, you can build games for free in Unreal Engine,

420
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
and royalties are waived on your first million dollars.

421
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
And these are retroactive terms to January 1, 2020.

422
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I mean, how many indie developers out there never see that kind of money,

423
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
you know, and are already having a cut to get out?

424
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,000
This is a great, great thing for small developers, indie developers.

425
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,000
That's amazing news that, you know, that's going to be royalty free for the first million.

426
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I am expecting great things of the Unreal 5 version of Super Multitasking, I just have to say.

427
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Now, one of the things...

428
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Those pixels better be razor sharp.

429
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Now, one other thing to talk about with Unreal Engine 5,

430
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
because sometimes when we've talked about brand new cutting edge engines,

431
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
the question is, what about Switch, though?

432
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Real quick, there's one more piece to that as well.

433
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,000
So the other thing that they did was they opened up the framework that they use for Fortnite

434
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:26,000
for their multiplayer servers and matchmaking and all that stuff.

435
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
And now that's available for free as well.

436
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,000
It's platform agnostic, so you can use it in Unreal, Unity, whatever you want to use it in.

437
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Now, when it comes to the Switch, the question is, is it going to be there, is it going to run on it?

438
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:45,000
And the short answer is, yes, obviously it's not going to have the same power,

439
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:50,000
but the engine that you build the game in, it can still work on Switch as well.

440
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
And Unreal Engine 4 fully works on Switch right now,

441
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
and Unreal 5, they will continue to have that Switch report.

442
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
It may not have every feature, it may not run the same,

443
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,000
but it's going to be available for Switch development, so that, I believe, is a good thing.

444
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Now, sorry, I've been ignoring chat while I've been getting to all this,

445
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
but I want to get to some of the comments in chat.

446
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Let's see, VGRealness says,

447
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
maybe the Summer Games thing is what's going to take the place of E3,

448
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,000
as there doesn't seem to be much hype around the IGN E3 replacement.

449
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Wait until a little closer to that second week in June,

450
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
or whenever they ultimately schedule that for.

451
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:31,000
You know, Twitter and social media is very much a live in the now kind of place.

452
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,000
And so, I think the fact that there's, what is there to get hyped about?

453
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Turn on my computer and look at the latest thing on IGN, right?

454
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Like, E3 you get hype about because you get up, you go,

455
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
you might make plans to watch press conferences with friends,

456
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
or even Sony did that movie theater thing, right?

457
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
But obviously that's all different right now.

458
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
And you drink heavily after all the social anxiety gets you.

459
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Yes, yes. So, that's not really happening this year.

460
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,000
So, I don't know if it's to say that the buzz won't be there.

461
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I think it's just, once the news is out there, it will spread like wildfire,

462
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
no matter where it comes from.

463
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Anyway, actdeftinchat says,

464
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
though like I said earlier, it's cool that the tech is going to be amazing,

465
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
but what does this all mean to us, the general consumer?

466
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Especially this being shown for the PlayStation 5.

467
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
All hype, no substance.

468
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Well, wait until that IGN thing or when E3 would have been.

469
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Keep in mind, what we saw out of this was,

470
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I think they even said was going to be the game developers conference.

471
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
And obviously that got put on hold and didn't happen.

472
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Wait for those, you know, Sony.

473
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
At least it was more entertaining than Mark Cerny's talk.

474
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Well, for you, but if you're a developer,

475
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
you might have found Mark Cerny's talk very fascinating.

476
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,000
No, that new material or like, you know, material aside,

477
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
and the material was both very interesting.

478
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
It's just the presentation of it.

479
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,000
One is certainly more interesting than the other one.

480
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Don't even remotely slander the man who made Marble Madness, okay?

481
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Don't. All right, anyway.

482
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Unreal 5, Marble Madness?

483
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,000
But here. But, you know, let's see where we are in June or I guess July,

484
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
because Microsoft has basically said,

485
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
we're going to show Halo in July and the other games too, right?

486
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
So, you know, wait until there,

487
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
and I think you're going to find that hype level you're looking for

488
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
when we start to get to the stuff that is really targeted at the game.

489
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
to get to the stuff that is really targeted at the consumer.

490
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
So I wouldn't feel lack of hype right now,

491
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,000
because we are still May, this is early,

492
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
we don't usually get to find out the good stuff, not until June,

493
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
and then you're going to have to assume with everything that's going on with the pandemic,

494
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
it may be like July, August, it's going to be like summer long,

495
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
so when the companies are ready to unveil that stuff.

496
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:51,000
So, you know, I think the hype will still be there,

497
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
you're just going to have to give it a little longer, that's all.

498
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:59,000
So, alright, let's move on and get into some other news.

499
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Darsakra.

500
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Well, and this actually kind of goes back to where we were starting

501
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,000
right at the beginning of the show with all the people using their online games

502
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:16,000
for, you know, more often and for staying in contact with people,

503
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:23,000
but the video game industry in the US has set a sales record for the first quarter.

504
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
They're attributing it mostly to people staying at home,

505
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
for people having nothing to do but stay home and play video games.

506
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
So they have set a record of 10.86 billion,

507
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:42,000
which is 9% higher compared to the same spending in the same quarter of 2019,

508
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
so it's up 9% from last year.

509
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:55,000
And of that total, 9.58 billion was spent on video game content with an 11% increase.

510
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,000
They did mention big sellers, of course, being Animal Crossing New Horizon,

511
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare, Doom Eternal, Dragon Ball Z, Kakaroto,

512
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Fortnite, Grand Theft Auto 5, Minecraft, MLB The Show 20,

513
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:13,000
and NBA 2K20 as the best performing games.

514
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:18,000
And of course, the Switch sold its absolute best.

515
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:25,000
It led the market with a 2% increase, so the sales went to $773 million,

516
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:30,000
and with their accessories, that went up 1% to $503 million.

517
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:35,000
So taking all those numbers away from it, because I can say numbers all day,

518
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
but what does that mean to us?

519
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,000
It means that we are seeing more people gaming.

520
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:48,000
We're seeing people who are using gaming as their therapy,

521
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000
as we mentioned earlier, right?

522
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:59,000
And the people who are, in general, just looking to their games

523
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:05,000
as their big replacement, I think, for all of the other external things they used to do.

524
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:10,000
So in that respect, this surprises no one really, or it should surprise nobody.

525
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Nana, what do you think?

526
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Yeah, with the current state of the world, you're right.

527
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
It doesn't really surprise me.

528
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
The Switch going cuckoo bananas with everything Animal Crossing doing the same.

529
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I like that, cuckoo bananas.

530
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Doesn't really surprise me either.

531
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,000
I'm sure Jackbox Games probably is doing very well, and as I mentioned earlier,

532
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,000
as well, again, not that this is how you want to profit, but it is what it is.

533
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,000
And so, yeah, with more people being at home,

534
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:44,000
and I know some folks are still working and all that, but you have a lot of unemployed.

535
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Unemployment is really high, really high right now with all the service industry and everything.

536
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
It's very high.

537
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:58,000
So there's a lot of people that are playing video games to give them peace of mind.

538
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
They didn't have video games in the Great Depression.

539
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Of course, they also didn't have remotely the social programs we have now.

540
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Thank you, FDR, except, you know, again, not going to comment and ruined.

541
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:14,000
But I'm saying, you know, this is the perfect distraction,

542
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
the perfect thing for people who are looking for an outlet.

543
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,000
So, of course, they're going to be going into, you know, buying more systems.

544
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,000
I mean, well, how long were Switches unavailable?

545
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
They're just now coming back in office.

546
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Why am I saying office? It's like I'm going to work.

547
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:36,000
They're just now coming back into stores for availability.

548
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Yeah, Alan got one a week ago, but it was, you know, he had to get the text message alert when they were in stock.

549
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Did he have to kill for it?

550
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Yeah, it was that whole thing. He had to really, like, work for it, basically.

551
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Yeah, and I'm quite happy to have him as my AC buddy and to give him all my unneeded DIYs.

552
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Yeah, his town's really coming along, actually.

553
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
I need to just do a live stream of Animal Crossing already, but, you know.

554
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I did one when I first started playing.

555
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:09,000
I should probably do another, but my audio goes kind of funky going through my MacBook.

556
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
So, actually, and I didn't talk about this during my gaming week, but it is important.

557
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I've been using my office for work and still my gaming and everything, and that's why I'm like,

558
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I don't know if I want to sit in there for even longer and do streaming, but I probably will at some point.

559
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
But I did some minor upgrades in my computer this week.

560
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:34,000
I finally got that power supply, and I want to thank everybody for those very lovely offers that you all made,

561
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,000
but it finally came through. I got the power supply, and Alan put it in the computer today, actually,

562
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,000
and the new graphics card, which isn't a huge step up in the graphics department,

563
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:47,000
but also more fans to try to prevent some of the other issues I was having.

564
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,000
So, yeah, so the good news is that computer's all up and running now,

565
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
so I didn't want to, like, set up the capture card and everything,

566
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
just because I knew the thing was going to get torn apart and put back together.

567
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
But maybe that's something I can look at doing now, because there's just a little more oomph in there now.

568
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,000
So, I actually was looking at my streaming setup earlier this week because I was watching somebody,

569
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,000
and I was like, I need to figure out how to do certain things in there.

570
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:16,000
It's such an OBS noob, but, like, I finally figured out that you can actually organize your scenes,

571
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:21,000
where you have multiple different sets of scenes, because before I just had it all dumped in the one.

572
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:26,000
And I remember telling you, I was like, well, this is annoying, because, like, I have my DDR setup here,

573
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
and it's mixed in with my Skyrim setup.

574
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Oh, you mean, like, having the profiles, switching between the different profiles.

575
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Yeah, you can switch between, like, different profiles in there, and I was like, I just figured that out this week.

576
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:42,000
God, you know, like, it just takes me so long to figure this stuff out.

577
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,000
But, you know, you're not going to know until you dive in there.

578
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Jump in there and try it, that's for sure.

579
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,000
All right, anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about some other gaming news. Loki.

580
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
All right, so this is pretty exciting.

581
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:02,000
So, this week, Konami released a new DDR game that you can actually play in your browser.

582
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:09,000
So, Dance Dance Revolution V, which, it's technically in alpha right now, but it is available to play.

583
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:14,000
There's 15 songs available on there from Dance Dance Revolution A and A20.

584
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:21,000
And right now, you can play with your keyboard, although I assume if you have, you know, a mat or something like that,

585
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:27,000
that you want to hook up, that you can map it out to the keys and everything and be just fine.

586
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:33,000
It's kind of basic right now. I mean, they don't have any modifications.

587
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,000
You can do the songs, no speed mods or anything. They do have, you know, the four difficulties per song.

588
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:42,000
It's only single player. And yeah, but it is pretty cool.

589
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,000
You do need an EMUs account to set up, you know, that.

590
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:52,000
So, if you have that, you can log in. I can check it out. And it's running in Unity.

591
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
God, I don't even know if I were to remember my login, but if I have the car.

592
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Oh my God, in Unity?

593
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
It's in Unity.

594
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Wow.

595
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,000
If I had my card somewhere, maybe I could figure it out. Did you actually play it, Logie?

596
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I did play it.

597
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
What'd you think?

598
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:12,000
A little bit. It's all right. I mean, it looks just like, you know, DDR.

599
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
They've got, you know, everything in the backgrounds and everything.

600
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,000
And, you know, I try to take it apart, you know, because that's me.

601
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
So, I took a-

602
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
I may have or may have not done that.

603
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:29,000
So, I took a pass on it. I haven't played it yet. And I'm just kind of like, I heard the news and I was like, oh, okay.

604
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:36,000
And I kind of took some shit on Discord for my opinion because, you know, I basically said, well, here we are again.

605
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
And, you know, again, we've been doing this show a very long time.

606
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
And I feel like in the early years of the show, especially, there was a very common theme.

607
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,000
And that was that Konami never wanted to take risks in America.

608
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Like, DDR was released here kicking and screaming and subparly. Remember?

609
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
DDR USA mix, not as strong as what they have had over there.

610
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:02,000
And then when the DDR stuff. So, it was like, you know, and finally, maybe around the time Supernova finally came out.

611
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Like, finally, somebody at Konami figured out, oh, yeah, like, I guess there is, you know, a whole market for DDR there in the US.

612
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
And they've done this with a lot of other products too.

613
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:16,000
So, my point is, is I'm like, here we are again. It's another product. It's just for Japan.

614
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:24,000
So, it's just one of those, I have a very, and I didn't say this on Discord, and I think this would explain my position a lot more eloquently.

615
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:31,000
I have a very similar approach to this that I do, Phantasy Star Universe, I'm sorry, Phantasy Star Online 2 or PSO2.

616
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Yes, I'm aware it's been out in Japan for eight years.

617
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Yes, I'm aware I could have downloaded a translation patch and played it.

618
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,000
I'm not going to because Sega didn't want me to.

619
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
And that's how I feel about this. End of story.

620
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Yeah, and this is, it's okay. I mean, the timing windows are extremely forgiving.

621
01:19:52,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I mean, it's just like, it was super easy for me to AAA a song and like, I clearly wasn't hitting it at the right time.

622
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:10,000
So, I don't know. And there's some things that they do that are pretty dumb, like the scoring and everything sent by plain text.

623
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
And I mean, that could be totally exploited if you wanted to.

624
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:20,000
But in fairness, it's all like an early alpha, like it's a first release, like it's a preview, I guess.

625
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
So all of these things could be addressed. Like maybe they do have plans for international rollout.

626
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Maybe they do have plans for this, but I'll just, I can wait. I can wait.

627
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Yeah, I mean, I don't know why they couldn't just put Ace or A20 or whatever on PC because it runs on PC in the arcade anyways.

628
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:43,000
So like it runs on Windows XP. I mean, come on. I think I think you can handle it can handle this.

629
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:49,000
I don't know why we need to port it over the unity aside from, you know, doing the streaming assets and stuff like that.

630
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:54,000
It makes it a little bit easier that way. Maybe they can build a monetization for new song packs and stuff like that.

631
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:02,000
But I don't know. Like, I wish it was. I like to see where this goes.

632
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Like, because it would be cool, like if we could get like an official PC version of Dance Mania running or not Dance Mania, Dance Dance Revolution.

633
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I'll load that up on my cabinet as an option to play, like if I could do that. But like, I don't know.

634
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Let me get to some comments from Discord, because we did have there was a discussion about it earlier in the week, and then there was a little more today.

635
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:31,000
And I don't even know this is going on, but I see a comment from Dark Tetsuya responding to a YYR comment, which we'll read in a minute.

636
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Dark Tetsuya says, I heard a certain someone got death threats, hate mail in his inbox, since he works at Konami in their Japanese offices.

637
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Like, what the fuck, seriously? Okay, yeah, that is fucking gross and extreme.

638
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:52,000
And like, even if I'm sitting here going, meh, like, I would never condone, you guys know, I would never condone that level of, and I don't even, what the fuck is prompting people to go that far with it?

639
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Entitlement.

640
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Who cares?

641
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
I guess.

642
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:04,000
It's the same thing, that's why those idiots are protesting it, you know, wherever their capitals are. It's entitlement, it's people wanting what they want when they want, little Veruca salts.

643
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Is it that or is it, oh, we're mad because it's only 15 songs and it doesn't have DDR, third mix, fourth mix?

644
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
It's an alpha, who cares?

645
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
That's, that, that is a bit extreme.

646
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:19,000
YYR's comment says, as far as DDRV goes, I think it goes to show that gamers will complain about anything.

647
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Yes, it feels very early and rough around the edges, but I can't believe they released something for free that works with dance pads and contains current songs.

648
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Hell, it's got Golden League stuff in it that's a royal bitch to unlock in the actual game.

649
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:35,000
If anything, it's a token of goodwill above all, and yet we're giving them shit about it. Not a good look.

650
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:44,000
So I don't know if that's a comment for me, because it says we're giving them shit about it, or it's a comment for the extreme, like, crazy people, like Dark Tetsuya was referring to.

651
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
So I don't know.

652
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
I hope so.

653
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:55,000
But, you know, it could be me, it's fine because I was talking negatively about it in Discord, but I'm going to stand by what I said with the whole PSU too.

654
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:10,000
And again, the thing that just kind of irks me about it is that I see this very familiar pattern from the past that I hated in the past, and I'm not exactly, and yes, I'm well aware.

655
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:18,000
I could just, you know, go on and get through a little Japanese and do it and play. You know what? I don't want to.

656
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:25,000
You know what? It's fine. I think we have the right to criticize it because, dude, we've supported them from the beginning.

657
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Exactly.

658
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Through all of their games, and even DDRPC and all that, like, garbage.

659
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Tell you what, you bought that one, was it Beaten Groovy or whatever?

660
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Yes. I mean, I bought Beaten Groovy.

661
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
It's just a reminder.

662
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:43,000
I have the right to be critical, I think, of Konami products.

663
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
I mean, like, you know.

664
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
There's a difference between being critical and then just being a complainer.

665
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Exactly.

666
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
You know what I mean?

667
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Yeah. So, and again, and if that comment is that the crazy people that Dartis is referring to, then I'm with you.

668
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Like, just in general, that kind of cyberbullying that goes on around games and stuff is dumb.

669
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:08,000
And even from my own perspective, when Konami finally decides to invite me to the table, just like in the past, when they did have a subpar USA mix,

670
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:14,000
the three of us were there every fucking Wednesday night putting dollars in that machine playing it, even if it was USA mix.

671
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
And when they were-

672
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
But it did kind of pay off for us.

673
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Yeah. And when they released the PlayStation USA version, we all fucking bought it.

674
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
I bought that fucking Disney.

675
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
I bought that Konami.

676
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I'll be here to consume it when, you know, they put it out.

677
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,000
So we imported all that stuff too.

678
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
So, I mean, like, we bought it twice.

679
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
But I like-

680
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,000
And we also didn't buy it.

681
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
But I like the theory.

682
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:47,000
I like the theory that because it's early, maybe international versions are in the plan for a later rollout.

683
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Cool. I'll see you then.

684
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:54,000
So, all right, let's move on with some more stories, which I think the next one is mine, actually.

685
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,000
So let's talk about the PlayStation Studios brand.

686
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:06,000
So, yeah, there's not like a new company launched within PlayStation, but I guess you could say like a new branding, if you will.

687
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:10,000
A first party game is under the PlayStation Studios brand.

688
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:15,000
So the internal studios, meaning Naughty Dog, Insomniac Games, Santa Monica Studios.

689
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
So what are we looking at there?

690
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Like, Last of Us, God of War.

691
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Those big PlayStation exclusives that, you know, people are waiting for, right?

692
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,000
They're now all under a PlayStation Studios brand.

693
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:34,000
This was announced alongside an opening cinematic that is going to be with new PlayStation Studios games on the console.

694
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I'm guessing that's like a throwback to the PS boot up that we used to have, right?

695
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Well, I mean, and also a lot of games and studios of worth have their own little, you know, boot up screen, right?

696
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Like I reminded me like of a movie logo, like, you know, like 20th Century Fox.

697
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Everybody knows that one, right?

698
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
That whole thing, right?

699
01:25:54,000 --> 01:26:00,000
And or I think even with video games like the PlayStation era of Konami, if we want to talk about that.

700
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
There was that whole weird CGI thing where the Konami logo comes out of the rocks.

701
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Now, you remember that?

702
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
I can see it in my head.

703
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
I'm trying to think of like modern game.

704
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,000
I know what you mean.

705
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
And I play the doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

706
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Yes. I'm trying to think of modern game studio like splash screens that are kind of iconic.

707
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Anyway, I was looking in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.

708
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
If you guys think of any, let me know.

709
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:31,000
But anyway, yeah, so they're going to file it all under this brand for PlayStation Studios.

710
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:37,000
And, you know, head of global marketing, Eric Lempel, said over the last few years, even last decade,

711
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,000
the strength of the titles coming out from our studios has been stronger than ever.

712
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,000
We've been thinking about how we unite all of these great games under one brand.

713
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:48,000
And really the purpose of that is to make the consumer understand that when they see this brand,

714
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:53,000
they're getting ready for a robust, innovative, deep experience that they've come to expect from games coming from PlayStation.

715
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
So we came up with PlayStation Studios.

716
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:00,000
And it is noted, Microsoft did something very similar about a year ago.

717
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,000
When they started acquiring like Ninja Theory and Obsidian Entertainment, it's Xbox Game Studios.

718
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:10,000
And I do think the branding there is to reinforce the exclusiveness.

719
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:15,000
I think is what it really comes down to is that, oh, if I want to play a PlayStation Studios game,

720
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,000
I better get a PlayStation and an Xbox Studios game.

721
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,000
I better get an Xbox or a PC that's strong enough to run it.

722
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:27,000
So, well, and then we could get into the whole, hey, PlayStation stuff is starting to show up on PC.

723
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:33,000
But that's a whole another chain of events that we'll get into at another time when it's more appropriate.

724
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
We can talk about that.

725
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Yeah, but I think it's an interesting branding.

726
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:41,000
I don't think it really like changes anything, but I think it is just to drive home.

727
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:46,000
These are the PlayStation exclusives because we have the PlayStation 5 coming out and we want people to understand that.

728
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
And I think that's really what it boils down to.

729
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,000
So, all right, I'm looking at some of the comments in chat.

730
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,000
S.G.O. and Hunter Matt says, the classic HBO title credits are still the best.

731
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Bobby Blackwell says, I only really remember the turn 10 and playground game splash screens because of all the fours of playing I do.

732
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Well, they have the neat little like looks like you're turning on a car type of thing.

733
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
It's pretty cool. So, all right.

734
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:16,000
For the record, there is on YouTube for the people who like the old HBO thing, there's a making of.

735
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Of that whole opening set and how they built a real set for it.

736
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
It was so long and that was the best.

737
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
So good.

738
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
It was like 30 seconds long.

739
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,000
And it was always like, oh, my God, we got the HBO preview.

740
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Mama, you'll never hear from me again.

741
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Sneak it up at 2 a.m. to watch.

742
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Oh, no, that was Showtime to watch Rock and Rule, which is to this day one of my favorite movies.

743
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Well, you know what?

744
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,000
If we're going to throw it back, Dark Sakura, then let's throw it back with our next story.

745
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Are we going way back?

746
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Are we not?

747
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
I think we're going to go.

748
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Yes, let's go back.

749
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:59,000
We're going to get in our way back machine that you can also see next to a DeLorean on the rock and ball table.

750
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Just saying.

751
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Microsoft Solitaire is 30 freakin years old.

752
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:10,000
How much of that game did we all play when we were bored?

753
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:15,000
A lot, because it was like that default thing everybody had, you know?

754
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Well, it was, you know, the the built in kind of bloatware, but at least had had some use, you know?

755
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:27,000
But at any rate, it it's it's been out.

756
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:34,000
I mean, it's hard to think of having a computer that doesn't have, you know, some kind of solitaire.

757
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:41,000
And, you know, and now it's got like a collection, a solitaire collection where you have, you know, the old fashioned Klondike.

758
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:45,000
You have your scenes and they're bringing it in with Xbox integration now.

759
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:49,000
I mean, just seeing how I remember the cards with the fishies on the back.

760
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Yeah.

761
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:55,000
And remember, remember your reward for beating it was the bouncing card.

762
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Oh, and to see is funny if you.

763
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Gosh, what was it that I did?

764
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Yeah, we had an old it was a friend of mine who had a computer running three windows three one one emulated on her computer and just watching the cards go all over the place.

765
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
You know, is it what it is?

766
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:26,000
We can do that noise again, Jamie, because it was one of the Stooges, the the windows three point one one Stooges.

767
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,000
V.G. realness says now it has ads and you have to pay for it to get rid of it.

768
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Trash. No, I'm actually I've played the newer Microsoft solitaire.

769
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:43,000
It's it's fine. It's it's it it has evolved the way many games have many free games have across the last 30 years.

770
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
They have achievements in it, too.

771
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:52,000
That's just you know, it's funny is that for me, it was always like, you know what?

772
01:30:52,000 --> 01:31:01,000
I I don't like minesweeper, which is funny because one of the first things I did with my Mac is download minesweeper.

773
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,000
But I mean, it's it's just like that.

774
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:10,000
It's like it's like imagining.

775
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Not having vanilla ice cream, you know, it's just a staple, it's something that you just always expect to be there.

776
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:22,000
I love I loved Microsoft Solitaire, but what I really loved was that pinball game on Windows 95.

777
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Was it? Oh, yeah. Space cadet or something like that.

778
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:31,000
I remember the name of it was like that. Wasn't there like a skiing game for a hot minute?

779
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Or am I thinking back to thinking ski free and that that's that wasn't part of the normal suite of games.

780
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:41,000
That was the other thing that they had with chips challenge and stuff.

781
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:45,000
I remember that was called. But they also had hover.

782
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Where's my hover remake? Mm hmm.

783
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:53,000
I I just was like.

784
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,000
With with with that.

785
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:02,000
It's like when I said when I when I got even when I got on to my when I remember when I put together my Linux machine,

786
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:07,000
one of the first things I did was find the version of solitary that ran in Debian.

787
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:12,000
So now it's it's a staple. I mean, this game is now older than some of our listeners.

788
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Oh, God. Well, and it's a thing where it's like, you know, my mom is not a gamer,

789
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:27,000
but she'd play Microsoft Solitaire. So, you know, I think it was entry level gaming for a lot of people.

790
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,000
This is this is the mobile gaming of 30 years ago, in a way. Yeah.

791
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Indeed, it is. So. All right. But lovely throwback.

792
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Yeah. A little bit. Not our classic game of the week, though, just to be clear.

793
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Maybe in a later week for now.

794
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:46,000
But that's that's a stretch. I did. Hey, I did Halo for y'all.

795
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:51,000
And you also did Minesweeper at one point. So it would make sense that you would do the other Windows games.

796
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Maybe, maybe. Anyway, maybe we'll get to the game of the week this week or maybe it's a table.

797
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,000
We'll get to that. But we have a couple more stories for you first. Loki.

798
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:08,000
So out of nowhere, Nintendo announces a brand new game that's coming out in a couple months and it's a Paper Mario game.

799
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:13,000
So they have announced Paper Mario, the origami king, which is going to be coming out on the switch.

800
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:17,000
July 17th. Looks pretty cool.

801
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:23,000
And they had it looks like all these new folding abilities and different enemies that are all origami stuff.

802
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Hope there's some instructions on how to actually make some of these, because that would be pretty awesome.

803
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:35,000
And then wait, can I tinfoil had something on this? Because, yeah, here's the thing you say came out of nowhere.

804
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:41,000
I actually don't think it came out of nowhere because just last week there was a lot of like pressure in the media about,

805
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:45,000
wow, Nintendo's going crazy with Animal Crossing and they're selling all these things.

806
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Let's look at what's coming up next for Nintendo. Tumbleweed rolls by.

807
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:53,000
There is the Xbox Chronicles Definitive Edition, and many people are hype about that.

808
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:57,000
But I mean, beyond that, Tumbleweed, there's nothing really on the horizon for Nintendo,

809
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,000
because as we know, they probably would have announced this during the 3.

810
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,000
It means the Xenoblade Chronicles.

811
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
So what?

812
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
You said Xbox Chronicles.

813
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Did I really? Jesus Christ, I'm getting old.

814
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Xenoblade Chronicles.

815
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:13,000
So so that, of course, is all coming at the end of this month.

816
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Actually, it's in a couple of weeks. But beyond that, we don't have a lot of games announced.

817
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:22,000
We don't know what's coming. So I kind of think they were under pressure to unveil something.

818
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:28,000
And I think it's because, too, this probably was going to be in their E3 Nintendo Direct.

819
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:37,000
I think this coming out now is proof that the E3 Direct is not going to happen when you think it is.

820
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:42,000
It's going to happen end of June or early July. So they had to get this one out now.

821
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
That's my tinfoil hat theory.

822
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
I guess that makes sense, yeah.

823
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:52,000
It looks cool. I haven't played a Paper Mario game since Super Paper Mario, so I don't know.

824
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
I'll have to check it out.

825
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Yeah, it looks cute.

826
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Yeah. And there was someone saying online, like it says that someone had datamined, I guess, the eShop,

827
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:11,000
where they said that there is a version of it that's been uploaded on May 4th.

828
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:18,000
And it looks like almost seven gigs in size. So maybe the game's already done.

829
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Maybe. Maybe it's a strategical release thing. You know, it's like it's their summer title. Who knows?

830
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Cheeseburger in our chat room. Cheeseburger94 says, I'm stoked for New Paper Mario.

831
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
I really hope it will be more like the original two games.

832
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,000
And bonds006 says, Nintendo, show them something to keep the money coming in.

833
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:40,000
I still think Animal Crossing is doing plenty good for them for a little while.

834
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Animal Crossing is printing money.

835
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:48,000
It is. But okay, I get the investors need something because the market is a crazy place right now.

836
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:52,000
So the investors need something to see in the future. So here's something for them.

837
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,000
But this wasn't it, right? Look, there was something a little something else, too, right?

838
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Speaking of something for people that have invested money into like Nintendo's online service,

839
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:09,000
there's some more games that you can play in your Super NES and NES channel stuff.

840
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:17,000
So they've got on the NES side of the house, Rygar and Puzzle de Pon or Panel de Pon.

841
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:24,000
And then on the Super Nintendo, we have I'm sorry.

842
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000
So actually, no, it looks like that would be a super Nintendo.

843
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Yeah, I was like, Panel de Pon was Super Nintendo, I believe. Yeah. Sorry.

844
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Yeah, it's it's the the Super Famicom box art that's throwing me.

845
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
So on the NES side, we just have Rygar.

846
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:42,000
And then on the Super Nintendo side, we have Wild Guns, Panel de Pon and Operation Logic Bomb.

847
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Well, and to be to be fair, you can't be expected to know everything about Panel de Pon,

848
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:52,000
because it's a rare release where this never was released in the U.S. Tetris Attack.

849
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Yes, I know. We got it in other type of branded situations.

850
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,000
But the actual Panel de Pon game was only ever released in Japan.

851
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
So this is another one of those.

852
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:07,000
And this kind of happened to us when we got like Mario 2 loss levels in the library.

853
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
We didn't get it in All-Stars.

854
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:13,000
We got the actual like Super Mario 2 Famicom ROM in the U.S. library.

855
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,000
So this is kind of something like that. So that's that's kind of neat.

856
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Yeah. But Rygar with save states will be awesome.

857
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Absolutely. God, I mean, Rygar is only going to benefit from everything in that emulator.

858
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
And Rygar is a great choice. I love that game.

859
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Yeah. All those are going to be available on May 20th.

860
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
So look forward to those this week.

861
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,000
I mean, it would be nice if those types of releases were a little more frequent,

862
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:39,000
but all things said and done, it's not a terrible lineup for a month.

863
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
So I'll take it.

864
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
That's not too bad. Yeah.

865
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I'm actually hyped for Rygar.

866
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
I got it on NES recently,

867
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:51,000
but having it on Nintendo Switch Online would be nice since you can save state.

868
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Absolutely. Bobby Black Wolf says they can't use the Tetris name.

869
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,000
So that's why it's paneled upon and not Tetris Attack.

870
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Tetris company won't allow them to use the Tetris name since it's not Tetris.

871
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,000
And VG Realness says it's totally Tetris Attack. LOL.

872
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Yes. I mean, it is. It is the equivalent.

873
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Like paneled upon and Tetris Attack is like Puyo Puyo and Kirby's Avalanche

874
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
or Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.

875
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
It is exactly like it is the same damn game,

876
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,000
but they just splash the familiar characters in it.

877
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:25,000
So in paneled upon, are there any recognizable characters in paneled upon?

878
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I think there's like a smash move from that game or something,

879
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
but that's like it.

880
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,000
That's like it. It's a very otherwise kind of obscure Nintendo title

881
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
and more people will remember Tetris Attack

882
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,000
or it's Pokemon Puzzle League is the same game, isn't it?

883
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
I think it is.

884
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Planet Puzzle League?

885
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,000
No, Pokemon Puzzle League and then later Planet Puzzle League.

886
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
I think they're all paneled upon.

887
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Yeah.

888
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,000
So you kind of get the old school, the first version of that.

889
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:56,000
All right. Bobby Black Wolf says paneled upon has original characters.

890
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
The US localization made it Yoshi characters.

891
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Well, that was Tetris Attack had the Yoshi characters, right?

892
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
If I remember right.

893
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Yeah.

894
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Yep. Thank you.

895
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Bobby says Pokemon Puzzle League on N64 is paneled upon.

896
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
That's what I thought.

897
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
So all right.

898
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Well, I'm glad we have that all cleared up.

899
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,000
That's a fun puzzle game, though.

900
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:16,000
I love Pokemon Puzzle League because that was the game I kind of found first

901
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,000
and then I heard, oh, it was based off all these other games

902
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
and I kind of discovered them.

903
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Let's talk a little bit about Discord.

904
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,000
You know, video chat and all that is very popular right now

905
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
with all the social distancing going on

906
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
and people not able to really hang out in person.

907
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:33,000
So there's a lot of virtual things that are being used.

908
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
And video chat is one of them.

909
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Obviously, Zoom, if we want to talk about Cuckoo Banana sales,

910
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Zoom is one of those companies that's been doing very well in this situation.

911
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
And I think you're seeing a lot of other, you know,

912
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,000
conferencing competitors taking steps to be in that space.

913
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:50,000
I know Skype's been doing a lot of upgrades for better or for worse,

914
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
and I would say for worse.

915
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
I had another, and this is what, again,

916
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,000
if you want to know why this show isn't using Skype anymore.

917
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
So you know I do my survivor LARPs, right?

918
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,000
So I'm like on the production team for, I'm not playing it,

919
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,000
but I'm just kind of like helping to oversee it and all that stuff this week

920
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
and have for the past couple of weeks.

921
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:13,000
And so the newest version of Skype on PC broke my recording

922
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,000
because for whatever reason, it doesn't integrate through the desktop audio anymore.

923
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:21,000
It decides to use its own audio thing with no warning or change or whatever.

924
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
So those are the types of things that Skype just does to make things better

925
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
that have me very irritated with it.

926
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Anyway, on the other side, Discord doing some things to improve itself a little bit,

927
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:36,000
especially when more and more people are using video conferencing.

928
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
And now Discord already had video chat,

929
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:43,000
but now it has server video chat for desktop, web, and iOS.

930
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
So again, Discord has had this since 2017,

931
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,000
and obviously Bobby and the studio here,

932
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:53,000
we've been using video chat to talk to each other for a while.

933
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
So this is a little something new.

934
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:59,000
What this is, is now it's more like drop in and drop out conversation.

935
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:03,000
So you can hang out in a video call with people or just be by yourself

936
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,000
and people can see that you're there and drop in and talk to you.

937
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,000
So it's almost kind of like that Zoom line that's open or a Zoom meeting that's open

938
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:14,000
and people just kind of drop in and drop out as opposed to making a call,

939
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
which is a little more like what Skype does.

940
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
You have to actually call to initiate a conversation.

941
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
That's what Discord was doing before.

942
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
So that's kind of neat.

943
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,000
And it is interesting how Discord is kind of positioning themselves

944
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
in that video chat marketplace,

945
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:32,000
especially when it's video chat for gamers,

946
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:38,000
but I see a lot of people that don't consider themselves hardcore gamers

947
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:43,000
more and more that are starting to use it for chats and games,

948
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
like D&D type of games.

949
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:49,000
I think Discord is getting very popular with the D&D scene as far as I know.

950
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
So kind of interesting.

951
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Anyway, there you go.

952
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Let's go back.

953
01:41:55,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Let's go back in time to a time when we didn't have video chat online.

954
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
It's the classic game of the week.

955
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
And every week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault

956
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,000
and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking this game out.

957
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,000
But once a month, instead of picking a game, she likes to pick a pinball table.

958
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
And I believe that's what we've got this week.

959
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:20,000
So Dark Soccer is going to give us the classic pinball table of the month.

960
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
So what did you pick for this month?

961
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:29,000
So I picked the machine Bride of Pinbot.

962
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:34,000
So, yay, Bride of Pinbot, which is by itself an amazing table.

963
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:40,000
But beyond just being an amazing table, it's actually had an update.

964
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,000
So we'll get into that just a little bit.

965
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
So Bride of Pinbot.

966
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Now, I will go ahead and say it was done by Jon Trudeau.

967
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
So we know what kind of a creeper he was.

968
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,000
But it was also done by Python.

969
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,000
I'm going to mispronounce that last name, Angelou.

970
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
And it was released by Williams.

971
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:05,000
The table itself came out in 1991, and it is a follow-up to Pinbot,

972
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:12,000
which, going back into video games, Pinbot was a NES game, remember?

973
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
I do?

974
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Yep.

975
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:22,000
So anyway, with Bride of Pinbot, it took that theme from Pinbot,

976
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:27,000
and it took it in a somewhat different direction.

977
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Instead of the platform like you had, you had to put her eyes in.

978
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:38,000
It kind of had this pachinko-style playfield similar to how Pinbot had.

979
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:41,000
But you had other things going on with it.

980
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:47,000
It had a rotating box with the machine's face states on the sides.

981
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:51,000
It had raised eyes and holes, depending on which face that you were on.

982
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Your left ramp had a saucer with a small wheel.

983
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Single ball, that saucer would give you a random award,

984
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
including sometimes a timed jackpot.

985
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,000
You have multi-ball, which comes after the metamorphosis,

986
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
where you lock the eyes and everything.

987
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
You have the heartbeat ramp.

988
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
I mean, it was really great.

989
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:14,000
And there is, with that center ramp,

990
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,000
there is an interval for a shot that's worth a billion points.

991
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:23,000
And actually getting that shot at least once

992
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:28,000
will let it be recorded in the special Billionaire's Club on the high score list,

993
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
that's separate from the main high score.

994
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,000
And then once, of course, you activate all of her circuits,

995
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,000
then you get, I guess, kind of the wizard mode in the game.

996
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,000
It's kind of like pre-wizard modey stuff, but, you know, a lot of those lines.

997
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:46,000
And the voice of the machine was actually done by a singer named Stephanie Rogers.

998
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:51,000
And it's one of the earlier games that had a modesty mode,

999
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
because her voice was so sultry.

1000
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:58,000
I mean, I can tell you another game that had a modesty mode,

1001
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:04,000
that was, gosh, Big Bang Bar,

1002
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:13,000
which was a prototype until someone was able to get the licensing for it.

1003
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:18,000
So anyway, it is one of my absolute favorite tables.

1004
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:25,000
And as you knew, you know, I had one for, I'd say, for a hot minute, right?

1005
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
I played it long enough for me to play it at least once.

1006
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Yeah, for sure.

1007
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
So, sorry.

1008
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:36,000
So at any rate, it got an update not long ago,

1009
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
but let me rewind a little bit back,

1010
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:45,000
because there is actually one game that had some glitching going on in it earlier too,

1011
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:52,000
because there was, the ROM version L7 had a multiplayer bug,

1012
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:58,000
so they would actually have people wind back to the L6 build of the game.

1013
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:02,000
So back to that, anyway, as I was saying, there was,

1014
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
sorry, my voice is being stupid right now.

1015
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:10,000
There was an update that's called Bride of Pinbot 2.0 that has,

1016
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:13,000
you can get a color D&D for it.

1017
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:16,000
It has new animations, new music.

1018
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:20,000
The music to me, like, sounds almost like it's something out of Space Mountain.

1019
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,000
I love it.

1020
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:26,000
You know, it's just, it's beautiful.

1021
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
It has new roads in it.

1022
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:35,000
It uses the assets and then builds on it to where you're really getting a new experience with this.

1023
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
I think it's absolutely a thing of beauty.

1024
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:43,000
And you'll often see, you know, people will bring them out now for various,

1025
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:48,000
let's say, pinball expos and classic gaming things.

1026
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:53,000
And I think, yeah, Dark Touch, I think they did do one for high speed,

1027
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
but I hadn't played it.

1028
01:46:55,000 --> 01:47:01,000
But at any rate, you can also get new translates for Bride of Pinbot 2.0.

1029
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Absolutely beautiful.

1030
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:07,000
New cabinet decals, really nice artwork.

1031
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:11,000
I should probably put up the footage of 2.0, shouldn't I?

1032
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Yeah, you might want to.

1033
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Let's do that. Here we go.

1034
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:21,000
And by the way, the player in that footage is, well, it's from the channel 85VETTT.

1035
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:26,000
And, well, it was put up in 2015.

1036
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
I know it's been out for a hot minute.

1037
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:34,000
But it's really, if you can get your hands on what to play,

1038
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,000
if you can get one to own, that would also be pretty nice.

1039
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:45,000
But it really is absolutely an amazing table, the Bride of Pinbot 2.0,

1040
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:51,000
which, you know, we've had other fan updates and unofficial updates,

1041
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:55,000
because you remember we were borrowing someone's Cactus Canyon continued,

1042
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,000
which updates that little drama.

1043
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:03,000
I think they finally released the full ruleset for Cactus Canyon.

1044
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Of course, it doesn't have the bonus modes like continued had

1045
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:13,000
because Skrillex is licensed for the Cowboys vs. Aliens segment.

1046
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:19,000
I should find that video and put it up again of Dan scoring that multiplayer,

1047
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
the Cowboys vs. Aliens.

1048
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
I'm going to go back to the 1.0 footage now that you've seen 2.0.

1049
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Cool.

1050
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:30,000
But at any rate, you know, it's on my list of ones that I love.

1051
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,000
I've definitely owned one.

1052
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:34,000
I've had them in various states of repair.

1053
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:39,000
And it really is a worthwhile table to play, absolutely gorgeous, so much fun.

1054
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:43,000
And it's classic, which, of course, this one was followed by one

1055
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:46,000
I'm not going to be discussing in the segment,

1056
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:52,000
well, in the segment ongoing called Jackpot, which, you know, we had that too.

1057
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Jackpot's really a fun one.

1058
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,000
But of the three, I'm going to say that Bride of Pinbot,

1059
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:01,000
and especially the Bride of Pinbot 2.0, is my favorite of that series.

1060
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
All right.

1061
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Anything else to say about the classic pinball table of the month?

1062
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
I see.

1063
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
I think that's what she said.

1064
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Yeah, no, I see you or something like that, I think.

1065
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,000
I can see.

1066
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Yeah, that's what the old pinbot would do.

1067
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Now I see you.

1068
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Now I see you.

1069
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
All right, cool.

1070
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Good pick, good pick.

1071
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
And because I've played this one at your house,

1072
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
so I particularly remember this one.

1073
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:34,000
You played it in my garage back when I lived in Citrus Frights.

1074
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Oh, that's right.

1075
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Oh, that's right.

1076
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
It wasn't even in your new place.

1077
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Yeah, oh my gosh, it was that long ago.

1078
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,000
It was among our first ones, because we had Whodunnit,

1079
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
and had Rocky and Bullinkle.

1080
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

1081
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,000
At the time, yeah.

1082
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,000
And we had the rotating Judge Dredd.

1083
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:55,000
I say rotating because we've had multiple Judge Dredd's thanks to Will.

1084
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
All right.

1085
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Oh, go ahead.

1086
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
One last thing, to be a little sad,

1087
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,000
I also want to give a shout out to Will, who had to put one too to sleep.

1088
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,000
That's sad.

1089
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Spitbull.

1090
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Sorry to hear that.

1091
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Midna and 1-2 got along really well.

1092
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Dark Soccer, are you hanging out to do rapid fire news?

1093
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Are you going to cut out?

1094
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Yeah.

1095
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Okay.

1096
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,000
I'll do a rapid fire.

1097
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,000
All right, let's get to rapid fire news.

1098
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Will you want to start us off then?

1099
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Yeah, I guess.

1100
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Sure, like, sure, I'll do one.

1101
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:29,000
But anyway, there, you know, this goes back again to saying

1102
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,000
that we've had to do a lot of our memorializing and events

1103
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
in online games.

1104
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:40,000
UC Berkeley seniors are graduating in Minecraft through a Minecraft ceremony.

1105
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
I think that's cool.

1106
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:47,000
And they've actually done a recreation of the football field and everything

1107
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:51,000
so that their little avatars can go walking across of it

1108
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:57,000
and they put it all together and to kind of give them, you know,

1109
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:00,000
maybe it's not the graduation that everyone wanted,

1110
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:04,000
but it's still a really nice gesture for them to do so.

1111
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:07,000
And then they're doing a virtual music festival with 90 performers

1112
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:10,000
taking part over several days.

1113
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,000
So pretty cool.

1114
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:17,000
And then last but not least, and this is happy news for all of us,

1115
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:20,000
I might have done a little dance,

1116
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:29,000
but May 22nd is the revised release date for the Turbografx 16 mini.

1117
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Yay!

1118
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Is Konami doing something right?

1119
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Yeah, I don't know if you got the shipping thing from Amazon.

1120
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Mine's on the 26th, but whatever.

1121
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
I'm like, I've been waiting this long.

1122
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
It'll get here when it gets here.

1123
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Well, and you know, they had a mess of them in Japan.

1124
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Oh, yeah, and I heard you could have bought it this whole time

1125
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
if you wanted to just buy one of the ones from Japan.

1126
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:56,000
But again, I'll just wait for the one that's meant for me.

1127
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Yeah, indeed.

1128
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,000
But I'm excited for it.

1129
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
No, no, me too.

1130
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
I am absolutely just thrilled as I can be.

1131
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
I mean, we've all waited for one.

1132
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,000
I really would like...

1133
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,000
I was thinking that I really wanted a Japanese one,

1134
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:14,000
but I don't care about Tokimeki Memorial that much.

1135
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Well, then they're also putting many of the Japanese versions of the games

1136
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
in the U.S. ones, so...

1137
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,000
They are, so I get to annoy people with chowainiki again.

1138
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Well, hey, that'll give you something to talk about next week

1139
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
on the show that's not just Animal Crossing.

1140
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,000
If it arrives.

1141
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,000
If it arrives, yeah.

1142
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
But yeah, but I mean, among the other games on there,

1143
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:34,000
we've got Newtopia, which I love Newtopia.

1144
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
It's kind of a little Zelda-like game.

1145
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Splatterhouse, and that would be the other reason

1146
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:42,000
I'd want the Japanese version, is for the unedited Splatterhouse.

1147
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Although, maybe you can switch your region?

1148
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,000
But Snatcher!

1149
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Snatcher.

1150
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,000
I know, there's some good stuff on there.

1151
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,000
I don't think it's translated, though.

1152
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000
No, I don't think it is.

1153
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
You have to use a guide or something to get through it.

1154
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Y'all can finally play a real rondo of blood.

1155
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Hooray.

1156
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,000
That's on the PlayStation.

1157
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Hooray.

1158
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,000
R-Type.

1159
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Though, R-Type.

1160
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,000
That makes me happy, too, because I love R-Type.

1161
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:06,000
And Extifer will get to play Alien Crush.

1162
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Oh, yeah.

1163
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Oh my god, he used to play that all day on the Wii.

1164
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
He was so into it.

1165
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,000
It was crazy.

1166
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Because the Wii had the turbo graphics stuff

1167
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
and the backwards compatibility.

1168
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:17,000
All right.

1169
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Anyway.

1170
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
You know what I mean.

1171
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,000
What the hell am I saying?

1172
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,000
The eShop.

1173
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,000
What the hell did they call it?

1174
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Virtual...

1175
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Or console.

1176
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Virtual console.

1177
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Virtual console.

1178
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,000
I already forgot.

1179
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,000
All right.

1180
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Anyway.

1181
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Dark Zara, thank you.

1182
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,000
It was lovely to have you back tonight.

1183
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
I hope you're feeling a lot better.

1184
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,000
I hope the show helped.

1185
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Why don't I do releases?

1186
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,000
You want to?

1187
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,000
All right.

1188
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,000
All right.

1189
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Well, then.

1190
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Well, can we do the rest of it?

1191
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,000
I don't have to do any more after that,

1192
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
but I would really like to just hang around

1193
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
and participate a little bit.

1194
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,000
I'm still kind of...

1195
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Eh.

1196
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,000
All right.

1197
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Up to you.

1198
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Well, let's get through the...

1199
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,000
You let me know when you're done.

1200
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Let's do the rest of the rapid fire news first.

1201
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,000
So, Loki, why don't you go?

1202
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Go show.

1203
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Okay.

1204
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,000
So, let's talk about free stuff.

1205
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,000
So, Lego Ninjago, the movie, the video game,

1206
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:07,000
is now free on PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4

1207
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
until May 21st.

1208
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
So, go download it on your platform of choice

1209
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
or all three like I did,

1210
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:16,000
because you never know where you need free games.

1211
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
And it was actually pretty good.

1212
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
I actually purchased this one on the Switch

1213
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,000
a while back for my kids,

1214
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
so I did play a little bit of it.

1215
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
And the Lego games are pretty good.

1216
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,000
I love the movie.

1217
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:28,000
And then, let's see.

1218
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
So, we're kind of wondering, you know,

1219
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
what are these other companies going to be doing,

1220
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:36,000
you know, for upcoming events and game announcements

1221
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,000
since we don't really have like a formalized E3?

1222
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Well, we now know at least what Ubisoft's doing.

1223
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:44,000
So, they have a Ubisoft Forward event

1224
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,000
that's coming out on July 12th

1225
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:50,000
that they're going to talk about their game reveals

1226
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,000
and news and whatnot.

1227
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
So, that's going to be happening.

1228
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:58,000
It looks like 12 p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. UK,

1229
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,000
on the 12th of July.

1230
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
So, neat.

1231
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
I always look forward to those.

1232
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,000
They're usually, out of the third-party companies,

1233
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
they seem to be kind of the more,

1234
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
the best one out of the group.

1235
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
They get some interesting hosts sometimes.

1236
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
I wonder if that'll be the case this year, too.

1237
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Yeah, I'll be curious to see how they're going to do that.

1238
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
So, yeah.

1239
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Because they had like Joel McHale one year.

1240
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Aisha Tyler did it for a little bit.

1241
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
So, yeah.

1242
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Yeah.

1243
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,000
All right.

1244
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Interesting trademark spotted in Europe by Capcom.

1245
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:34,000
And the trademark is for Capcom Arcade Stadium.

1246
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,000
No idea what this is,

1247
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:38,000
although the trademark indicates it could be a Nintendo Switch thing.

1248
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Capcom did do an arcade compilation

1249
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
on the PlayStation 3, I want to say,

1250
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
and that probably was on the 360 as well.

1251
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,000
So, there is that.

1252
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:49,000
I don't know if this is some type of port or update to that

1253
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
that's going to be on the Nintendo Switch.

1254
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
It definitely sounds like a compilation of some sort.

1255
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Doesn't it?

1256
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Yeah, it sounds like they're old school games.

1257
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
I wouldn't expect things like Street Fighter

1258
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:01,000
and things that they've been selling in other packages to be in there,

1259
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
but I guess anything is certainly possible.

1260
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:06,000
And Capcom has a lot of like old classics.

1261
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:09,000
I'm still holding up for an official release of Quiz and Dragons.

1262
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Yes, I realize all the quiz questions are dated as hell at this point,

1263
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
because all the questions are from like 1994

1264
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
or wherever that game came out, but...

1265
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Let's get a new one then.

1266
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Yeah, right.

1267
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Can we have a new Quiz and Dragons?

1268
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Yeah, why not?

1269
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Let's get a new one.

1270
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:24,000
That would be awesome.

1271
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:28,000
I thought they did like a Quiz and Dragons for like...

1272
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Maybe I'm thinking of something else,

1273
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
but I thought there was a game like that

1274
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
that was for like 3DS or something like that.

1275
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Oh shit, maybe.

1276
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,000
I don't know.

1277
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,000
I missed it if there was.

1278
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Maybe Jack can help.

1279
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Also, one of those releases that came out on the Switch,

1280
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,000
you might have forgotten that this happened,

1281
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:42,000
but it was a pretty big deal.

1282
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:45,000
The Panzer Dragoon remake was released on the Switch.

1283
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
That was a little while ago,

1284
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:50,000
and some people had some complaints that it wasn't very good

1285
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:53,000
and it didn't live up to the trailer and all that stuff.

1286
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Well, they did do a big update this week.

1287
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:58,000
It's up to version 1.3 now with some new options,

1288
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
cheat codes, and other improvements.

1289
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Episode 0, a performance mode for 60 frames a second,

1290
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:07,000
multi-button fire, Blue Dragon motion rework.

1291
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:10,000
They've really gone back and tried to tweak the game based on feedback.

1292
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:13,000
I have not played it myself yet to see what I think,

1293
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:16,000
but I've heard that it's still not perfect,

1294
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
but it's way better shaped than it was.

1295
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,000
That was the general consensus of what I was hearing about that remake.

1296
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
All right, let's travel around the world

1297
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
and check out some release dates,

1298
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:30,000
as small as they may be for this date and time in this era.

1299
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Loki, what's coming out in the US?

1300
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Not a whole lot.

1301
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:37,000
We've got this week, it looks like Golf With Your Friends.

1302
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
That's going to be on PC and Nintendo Switch,

1303
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1304
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:44,000
But, Loki, what if I don't have friends?

1305
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Well, then you can golf with nobody.

1306
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Golf with yourself.

1307
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Go golf yourself, Loki.

1308
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Go golf yourself.

1309
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
That needs to be a name of a game. That's awesome.

1310
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Go golf yourself?

1311
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Can we put that on the list of dream games?

1312
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Go golf yourself.

1313
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:05,000
There's been a lot of really good funny, like, what the golf and stuff like that.

1314
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:08,000
That's true. Funny golf games.

1315
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,000
They've had a few.

1316
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,000
All right.

1317
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
God, there's one.

1318
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
This, man, tangent time.

1319
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
So there was a golf game, actually,

1320
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,000
that was on one of these PC gamer discs a while back

1321
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
that I had gotten.

1322
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:24,000
It was like a Halloween themed golf thing.

1323
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:27,000
I used to love mini golf games.

1324
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Big fan of that.

1325
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Growing up near mini golf places.

1326
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
But, yeah, man, I need to find that.

1327
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Anyways, other games.

1328
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,000
They're coming out.

1329
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:39,000
So the wonderful 101 remastered on PC,

1330
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4.

1331
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
So that's coming out this week.

1332
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Cannibal Cuisine on PC,

1333
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Nintendo Switch.

1334
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Sounds interesting.

1335
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Biped on Nintendo Switch.

1336
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
The Persistence on PC,

1337
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,

1338
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
and Xbox One.

1339
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Spirit Hunter NG on Nintendo Switch.

1340
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:04,000
We've got Maneater on PC,

1341
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1342
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Monstrum on Nintendo Switch,

1343
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1344
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
And last but not least, Saints Row,

1345
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
the third remaster on PC,

1346
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,000
PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1347
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:20,000
We have a few games trickling through in Japan.

1348
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,000
That game you mentioned,

1349
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,000
the Spirit Hunter NG in Japan,

1350
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
is just called NG in Japan.

1351
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:29,000
But it looks like a scary game on the Switch,

1352
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
where it's like spirits killing people.

1353
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
It seems like the type of thing Jamie would be into.

1354
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
She likes those Japanese horror spirits

1355
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
or killing everybody type of things.

1356
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Oh, yeah, totally.

1357
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
So this is a Jamie game.

1358
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
That releases in Japan this week as well

1359
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
on May the 21st.

1360
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,000
The other big release on the Switch

1361
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
is a Phantasy Star Online 2,

1362
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,000
ironically enough.

1363
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Because you know it's on the Switch in Japan.

1364
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:54,000
And this is an Episode 6 deluxe package

1365
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,000
called Cloud.

1366
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
So I think it's just some type of rebundling of it

1367
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
to celebrate like a new episode

1368
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
that's out in Japan anyway.

1369
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
And then on the PlayStation 4,

1370
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
I'm trying to see if we have anything this week.

1371
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
That same NG game is out as well as Phantasy Star.

1372
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
So the same game is out on the PlayStation 4.

1373
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
And that's really it for this week.

1374
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
How about the UK, DarkSakura?

1375
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Only a couple.

1376
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:18,000
We have Saints Row 3 Remastered and Maneater.

1377
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
That would be it.

1378
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
That is it. All right.

1379
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:25,000
This is the part of the show where we get into the emails.

1380
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Do you want me to do it, or you want to do it, or what?

1381
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
I'm not even logged in.

1382
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Okay, well, neither am I.

1383
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Is there anything important?

1384
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
I saw an email from YYR come in at the last second.

1385
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
I'm logging in.

1386
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Oh, okay, good.

1387
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Because I am apparently the only one

1388
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
who cleans out the inbox.

1389
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Yes, you are.

1390
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Yes, I am.

1391
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Okay, it's loading up the email for me,

1392
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
and I will be happy to do that.

1393
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Okay, it's loading up the email for me,

1394
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:55,000
and I will be happy to read it as soon as it freaking co-operates.

1395
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Oh, you know what?

1396
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:57,000
I refresh it the moment it pops.

1397
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Okay, ready?

1398
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Yes.

1399
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Hello, LR.

1400
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Just a quick comment on last week's discussion

1401
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
regarding the Xbox Series X event.

1402
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:07,000
It's very easy to say, well, the games are still in development.

1403
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Maybe they're kind of early.

1404
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Maybe there isn't much to show yet.

1405
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:14,000
There should be more to show in a few months, et cetera.

1406
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:15,000
But here's the thing.

1407
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Microsoft and Sony seem like they're still planning

1408
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:21,000
to launch their new plastic and metal boxes this holiday season.

1409
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
If that means November,

1410
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:26,000
that's about six months from this very moment,

1411
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,000
and it seems like some of the games

1412
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:30,000
announced we're targeting the launch window.

1413
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Now, let's get one thing straight.

1414
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Six months is plenty of time for me

1415
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
to add new challenges to super multitasking.

1416
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:39,000
But considering the size and scope of most AAA productions,

1417
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:43,000
those games had damn better be within sight of their finish lines.

1418
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:44,000
If we're six months away,

1419
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
and they barely got anything to show,

1420
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:49,000
then either the devs have a real problem on their hands,

1421
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
or the games need to be delayed.

1422
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Anywho.

1423
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
I don't want to well actually this too much,

1424
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
but maybe a little bit.

1425
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
But just something to keep in mind,

1426
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:59,000
just something to keep in mind,

1427
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:02,000
is that a lot of times the builds for E3

1428
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,000
and the types of things that are shown at these presentations

1429
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,000
are done quite a bit in advance.

1430
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
So I don't want to deflate the point too much,

1431
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:11,000
but it may be a little more in six months,

1432
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
it may be like eight months, nine months,

1433
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:17,000
just because these things are usually compiled and so forth,

1434
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
like way more in advance.

1435
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
But I get your point.

1436
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:24,000
I'm not trying to detract from the point too much.

1437
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Moving forward.

1438
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Anywho, I hope you're all enjoying the show.

1439
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
I'll post a link in the VoG Discord

1440
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
to something fun on Friday night.

1441
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Eleven gamers have never heard of super multitasking before,

1442
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:41,000
did a blind race to clear 30 challenges out of 42 in the game.

1443
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,000
It was pretty entertaining to watch,

1444
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:45,000
so if you've got some time to kill, head on over and check it out.

1445
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Best wishes to all, including the listeners.

1446
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Have a great week.

1447
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Warm regards, Aaron, YYR.

1448
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Yeah, Bobby talked about that speedrun a little bit at the end of his show,

1449
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
and so now we've talked about it on our show.

1450
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
But yeah, it is there in the Discord.

1451
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
I didn't watch it myself, but when I heard Bobby,

1452
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:02,000
I guess Bobby saw it and he was talking about it a little bit,

1453
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
and so I was like, oh, that's really cool

1454
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:07,000
that it showed up there in a speedrun and all that stuff,

1455
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:10,000
and I think that's a great way to get the word out.

1456
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Again, the internet is sleeping on super multitasking.

1457
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:15,000
That game is great.

1458
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:20,000
It's just a fun little time waster but challenging thing.

1459
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:24,000
It's such a good product, and this thing should be wildfire.

1460
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
I hope it was well received by the speedrunners.

1461
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
I'm sure it was.

1462
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:31,000
So, excellent.

1463
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Oh, it was just linked in our chat room too.

1464
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Thanks, Matt.

1465
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Cool.

1466
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Wonderful.

1467
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
All right, so if you want to email us in a future week,

1468
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:42,000
participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to do so.

1469
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
In the meantime, we have a few more stories for you

1470
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
before we wrap up the show.

1471
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Loki, why don't you get to it?

1472
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:55,000
All right, so we've got the news that PUBG is adding bots on PC.

1473
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:00,000
So they're introducing, I guess, a ranked mode

1474
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:06,000
where players can play against the best players in the world,

1475
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:09,000
but every mode that's not necessarily ranked

1476
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:16,000
is going to get bots to fill up the space where actual players aren't.

1477
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:21,000
So they said that they're introducing the bots

1478
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:24,000
due to the widening skill gap among the player base.

1479
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:30,000
So it's going to allow new or bad players something easier to shoot at.

1480
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:35,000
So me, me and Bobby Blackwolf get to fight bots.

1481
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,000
I'm similar back with Titanfall as well,

1482
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:41,000
because Titanfall used to have the main characters

1483
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:44,000
were kind of like the Titan pilots and stuff like that,

1484
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:48,000
and then you'd have these fodder characters that were around

1485
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:52,000
that you would be able to easily kill to build up your experience bar

1486
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
to call down your Titan and stuff.

1487
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:59,000
So I don't know. It's not a big deal, I think.

1488
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
See, I thought the punchline to this was going to be

1489
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
they have to put bots in it to make sure that there's actually

1490
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
a hundred people playing it on Stadia.

1491
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:11,000
No, that's not necessarily the reason,

1492
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:15,000
but they said, of course, this is just the first iteration of their bots.

1493
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:19,000
In the coming months, they'll be implementing machine learning techniques

1494
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:22,000
to monitor how humans play to improve them.

1495
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Of course, because it is a new thing that's being added to the game,

1496
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:28,000
everybody hates it.

1497
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
What? Change? We hate that.

1498
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Yes, apparently folks are not enjoying that.

1499
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:38,000
But yeah, it's a thing that's happening.

1500
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:41,000
I thought it would have been just because maybe

1501
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
PUBG since it's been out for a while,

1502
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
maybe they're not filling up their matches.

1503
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
That's what I was thinking too, not to be shady,

1504
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:50,000
but the reality is they used to be the only kid on the block,

1505
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:53,000
and now there's tons of these types of games.

1506
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Yeah, so some of the other games,

1507
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
like one we'll probably mention here in just a minute,

1508
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:01,000
could probably utilize some of these AI bots

1509
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:07,000
to help fill out their games when it's not necessarily doing all that great.

1510
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Well, it's doing fine, but they're not filling up as quickly as they used to.

1511
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Now, I'll give it this, the AI integration

1512
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:19,000
and the whole how it's going to learn from actual human behavior.

1513
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
That part's kind of cool.

1514
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:24,000
I'm also not super upset about it,

1515
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:28,000
although it does kind of take the thrill out of it

1516
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
when it's like, oh, it's a one versus 100 match,

1517
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:33,000
but they're not really all people.

1518
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:39,000
But I always secretly wondered if Tetris 99 wasn't doing the same thing.

1519
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
They'll never tell you.

1520
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
Yeah, they'll never tell you.

1521
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
They'll never tell you.

1522
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
They'll never tell you.

1523
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
They'll never tell you.

1524
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
Yeah, they'll never tell you.

1525
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:55,000
But there's a part of me that has always wondered,

1526
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:59,000
like, well, they could be doing it and just not saying anything.

1527
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
I don't know.

1528
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
There's a lot they could be doing, yeah.

1529
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Yeah, they don't exactly show them.

1530
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Well, no, I guess they do put a leaderboard at the end,

1531
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
and they show all the names.

1532
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
So I guess there's that.

1533
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
It could be procedurally generated names.

1534
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
It's just like everyone is playing Overwatch and like...

1535
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
You couldn't put conspiracy theories out there

1536
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
without the receipts to back it up.

1537
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
There's plenty of that going on in the world already.

1538
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
It's just like Overwatch, you know,

1539
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
when I was playing in some of those games,

1540
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
like unranked or whatever,

1541
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
and you're playing there,

1542
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
and then all of a sudden the bots at the end are like,

1543
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
yeah, good job, good game, good game, and stuff like that.

1544
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:36,000
It's like, I can't tell if these are real people or not.

1545
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
It's like, I think they're bots.

1546
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
It might be.

1547
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
All right.

1548
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Let's move on and talk a little bit about...

1549
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:47,000
I can't believe I have the Grand Theft Auto 5 story,

1550
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
but it's a busy week. What can I say?

1551
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:52,000
And this is more for me than it is for Loki,

1552
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:55,000
because I'm sure Loki bought Grand Theft Auto 5 on PC

1553
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:58,000
a long time ago when it was first out.

1554
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
But now I have it too,

1555
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:03,000
because the Epic Games Store has been giving it away.

1556
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:06,000
That's right. Grand Theft Auto 5 is the free game of the moment,

1557
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
or free game of the week, I suppose,

1558
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
on the Epic Games Store.

1559
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Actually, I'm glad we put the show together today,

1560
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:17,000
because it reminded me today to go in there and get it,

1561
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
because when this was first announced,

1562
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
the Epic Games Store, of course, crashed,

1563
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
because everybody was like,

1564
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
Zomagod, free Grand Theft Auto 5,

1565
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
were stampeding into the store,

1566
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
and of course brought it to its knees.

1567
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:33,000
So now that it's Sunday, it's very easy to get back in there and grab the game.

1568
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
So that's pretty cool.

1569
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Grand Theft Auto 5, free until May 21st.

1570
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Go get it. Go get it.

1571
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Something I noticed when I did grab it today,

1572
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:48,000
usually they tease what game is coming next for free.

1573
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:53,000
For this one, they put, like, a bank vault that says to be announced, basically.

1574
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
And that's what they did with Grand Theft Auto 5 as well.

1575
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:58,000
Yeah. No, that's what I mean. That's what they did with Grand Theft Auto 5.

1576
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:02,000
And it's doing it again for something else next week.

1577
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
So we may, and I want to...

1578
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
We may have another big title next week.

1579
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:12,000
I think there's a reason they made everybody turn on the two-factor authentication all of a sudden for these.

1580
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
I think we've got some big giveaways,

1581
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
and they didn't want bots collecting them all.

1582
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
So that's kind of interesting.

1583
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
So, we'll see.

1584
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Anyway, yeah, so what else can I say?

1585
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
It's free, Grand Theft Auto 5.

1586
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:28,000
If you're, I mean, if you're, nothing's ever truly free.

1587
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:31,000
So if you're willing to install and use the Epic Games Store,

1588
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
which maybe you're not,

1589
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
I'll use the store. I just won't give them my money.

1590
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
I haven't, and I haven't like...

1591
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
Well, I've actually given them my pay for things.

1592
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
I won't give them my credit card.

1593
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:44,000
But if they ever roll out the prepaid cards,

1594
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:47,000
then I'll finally be able to buy Tetris Effect.

1595
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
I tend to use PayPal on there, but like,

1596
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
you know, I've got two-factor on that.

1597
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
Oh, I didn't know they took PayPal.

1598
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
I might not be opposed to using PayPal,

1599
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
because then it's going through them.

1600
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
I'll have to think about it.

1601
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:01,000
But yeah.

1602
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
I purchased, was it the last thing I just purchased on there,

1603
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
just because I watch this channel,

1604
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Let's Game It Out all the time,

1605
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:09,000
and he really likes to break satisfactory a bunch.

1606
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:12,000
And so I got that, because it looked kind of interesting.

1607
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
So I'll, you know, have to play it at some point.

1608
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
But I did, yeah, I downloaded it again,

1609
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:20,000
or I added to my library, Grand Theft Auto 5.

1610
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Although I have it on PC already,

1611
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:25,000
and trying to get all my PC accounts,

1612
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
or all my accounts for Grand Theft Auto 5,

1613
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
because I got on like every platform,

1614
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:32,000
is really hard to get those all merged together.

1615
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
I don't play Grand Theft Auto Online,

1616
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
so it's not, I mean, that's really what it's for,

1617
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:39,000
but I'm wondering how this is going to work.

1618
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
I guess I could just log into my Rockstar Games account,

1619
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:42,000
and they'll be fine.

1620
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,000
All right.

1621
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:47,000
Well, let's move on with another story, Loki.

1622
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:48,000
All right.

1623
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:52,000
And then we talked a little bit about some issues with Valorant,

1624
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:58,000
and their whole controversial anti-cheat system as well.

1625
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Well, apparently it's working somewhat well,

1626
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:09,000
because they have banned 8,873 cheaters because of it.

1627
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:14,000
So, I mean, that's something, I guess.

1628
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
But yeah, I don't know.

1629
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Still, people don't like it.

1630
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Bye, cheaters.

1631
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Bye.

1632
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
Yeah, because there's folks saying,

1633
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
you know, I spent so much money on this crap,

1634
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:25,000
and then I get banned.

1635
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:28,000
What the hell, you know?

1636
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:32,000
But it was a person that was on a cheating forum.

1637
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:33,000
I don't know.

1638
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:36,000
Like, don't cheat in games, or don't cheat in online games.

1639
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Yeah, don't cheat in online multiplayer games.

1640
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
Cheat in single-player games all you want.

1641
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Yeah, just don't cheat in online games.

1642
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Exactly.

1643
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:46,000
All right.

1644
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:47,000
Well, one more story for you guys,

1645
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
and I think this might have been a game

1646
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
that Loki was referring to earlier.

1647
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:54,000
It's another one of those battle royale type of games.

1648
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:58,000
This may have actually, was the Culling one of the first ones

1649
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:59,000
that actually did it?

1650
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:00,000
It was, yeah.

1651
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,000
So they have the Culling,

1652
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:04,000
and then there was the Culling 2 that came out not too long ago,

1653
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
and the Culling 2 is hot garbage

1654
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
that literally no one was playing.

1655
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
It was, like, completely empty.

1656
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Well, and then now we have the Culling Origins, right?

1657
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Yeah, the Culling Origins is basically the first game again,

1658
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
but they kind of remastered it,

1659
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:21,000
but they've re-released it with a new,

1660
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
it's free to play now.

1661
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Well...

1662
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:25,000
Sort of.

1663
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:26,000
No.

1664
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Not exactly.

1665
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:28,000
It was free to play.

1666
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
You have to buy the game for $5.99 now,

1667
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
so you buy the game for $5.99,

1668
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
and then the developers, Aviant,

1669
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
is going to be charging players a fee

1670
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:39,000
if you want to play more than one match in a day.

1671
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:42,000
You have to buy token packs or weekly, monthly passes

1672
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
just to play the game.

1673
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Yeah, so what it was before,

1674
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:49,000
so it was $5.99 before for the base game,

1675
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
and then they sold skins in there,

1676
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:54,000
and apparently no one was buying the skins,

1677
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:58,000
and then now they're charging $5.99 for the game

1678
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:01,000
and then charging for folks to play the game,

1679
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
but, like...

1680
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
That's not smart.

1681
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Like...

1682
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,000
No.

1683
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
If you, like, what you need to do,

1684
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
like, if you believe your game,

1685
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:14,000
like, honestly, this pricing model just says

1686
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
your game isn't worth it.

1687
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:19,000
This pricing model just says this game isn't worth it.

1688
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Because if it was worth it,

1689
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
you would just charge $19.99,

1690
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
which is what PUBG's been charging for a long time.

1691
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
They charge more than that, right? $24.99?

1692
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Just charge $19.99 and get rid of the stupid thing.

1693
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Yeah, I don't think they can charge $19.99 for this game

1694
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
because if it's anything like the calling 2 was,

1695
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
it is garbage.

1696
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
Then it's not worth it. Your game's not worth it.

1697
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:44,000
So, yeah, I mean...

1698
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
It's unfortunate.

1699
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
You know, it's just coming back,

1700
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
you get it that you did it first,

1701
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
or you were one of the first people to do it,

1702
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
but just because you did it first doesn't mean you're the best.

1703
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:57,000
It certainly doesn't mean that if you were the best at one time

1704
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
that you're the best now.

1705
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:06,000
Let me have a very frank discussion with the creators of the culling

1706
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:09,000
because I can relate to you on a certain level.

1707
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:13,000
If doing it first meant you were gonna be the biggest and richest,

1708
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:14,000
guess what?

1709
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:17,000
We'd have people listening to this podcast.

1710
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:22,000
So, take it from me, culling.

1711
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
You're fucked.

1712
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:27,000
You're just gonna have to enjoy your nice...

1713
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Enjoy the fans you do have, because that's what we do.

1714
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
Enjoy the fans you do have,

1715
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:36,000
because nickel and diming them like this and all,

1716
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:39,000
that's just... It ain't gonna fly.

1717
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
It's not gonna work. Take it from us.

1718
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Just because you're the oldest doesn't mean you're the most well-received.

1719
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:48,000
So, it's just not a very good solution to the problem

1720
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:53,000
which was that they couldn't get people interested in buying their skin packs and stuff

1721
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:56,000
and so they weren't making enough money to run the servers.

1722
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:00,000
Fine, I get that, but this isn't the way to do it either

1723
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:06,000
because what you needed to do was instead make some more interesting items for people to buy

1724
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:09,000
and do it that way.

1725
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
You have to do free-to-play, especially in this space

1726
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:15,000
because you have very good competition doing free-to-play

1727
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:18,000
and then you have folks doing the pay-to-play stuff

1728
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
but they're not charging per game.

1729
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Honestly, maybe, and I don't mean to sound like a bitch,

1730
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:28,000
but maybe you should ask yourself,

1731
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:35,000
is this product good enough to be taking up space on the server in the first place?

1732
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Yeah, it's just, I don't know. I don't know why anyone would try to do this

1733
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:46,000
and we've seen bigger companies fail at this as well.

1734
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:50,000
I mean, so, you know, Radical Heights, anyone?

1735
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:53,000
I just, I don't see them succeeding.

1736
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:56,000
We're gonna send our thoughts and prayers.

1737
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
That's what we'll do.

1738
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
All right.

1739
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:03,000
Anyhow, let's move on.

1740
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
Anyhow, let's move on.

1741
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:08,000
If you guys have some comments or some topics that we didn't address yet

1742
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:11,000
that you'd like us to, we open up the listener roundtable via the chat room

1743
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
if you guys have any questions or further comment

1744
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:16,000
as we interact live with you guys live on Sunday night

1745
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:19,000
here at twitch.tv slash vog network

1746
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:23,000
for here, our 820th episode for May the 17th.

1747
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
VG Realness in Chat says,

1748
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:29,000
LOL, I don't mean to sound like a bitch, but love you Rob.

1749
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Well, look, I'm just calling it like it is.

1750
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:37,000
We all read this story about the culling and rolled our collective eyes.

1751
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Like it's just, it's not a good idea.

1752
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:43,000
And I'm just, I'm trying to be as nice as possible about it.

1753
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:46,000
But sometimes you have to show a little tough love.

1754
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Okay.

1755
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:51,000
It's just, it's such a crowded space nowadays.

1756
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:55,000
There's so many like light podcasting.

1757
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Remember when there were only like 15 gaming podcasts on iTunes?

1758
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Remember you've got like fricking call of duty in that space.

1759
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Now you've got, you know, not Overwatch, you've got, um,

1760
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Fortnite and you've got, um,

1761
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:12,000
I would say things like Overwatch.

1762
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
And I mean, I know they're not one versus a hundred.

1763
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,000
I would still say they take,

1764
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
they take the player base and those types of games.

1765
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Yeah. I mean, you've, you've got a lot of people competing in that space

1766
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
and I'm sorry, but like if your game,

1767
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:27,000
you're coming off a game that was just hot garbage and no one was playing it.

1768
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:30,000
And now you're bringing back the old game and all you're doing is putting a

1769
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
really stupid payment model on it.

1770
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
I don't think anyone cares.

1771
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:37,000
No one's going to come back now to be fair.

1772
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:41,000
And the only credit I'm ever giving them on this is just that the eight ninety

1773
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:45,000
nine that you have to pay for the game or whatever is only if you didn't know

1774
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:46,000
in the original.

1775
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:50,000
But still, it's just it's a stupid payment model.

1776
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:51,000
I mean, you're going to,

1777
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:54,000
you're going to have people trying that out once a day or whatever.

1778
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:59,000
And you and granted, you could possibly earn additional credits if you come in

1779
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
first with these shit.

1780
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:07,000
So if you actually play a game and you find out,

1781
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:10,000
hey, look, there's no one online playing this.

1782
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:13,000
I mean, what's to say? Like if you get disconnected because their servers are

1783
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:16,000
trash, what's to say that there's no one in the game?

1784
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:19,000
I mean, I just have a feeling that people are going to check it out and they're

1785
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:22,000
like, nope, I'm gonna go play something else or they're just not even going to

1786
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
give it any time of day. And it's just gonna be dead.

1787
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:27,000
It's just gonna be dead extremely quickly.

1788
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:32,000
They're happy to backtrack or do something different.

1789
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:35,000
All right. Well, do we have any last minute stories?

1790
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:39,000
OK. Or Jamie, if either of you have any last minute stories.

1791
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:42,000
I don't really have anything last minute.

1792
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:47,000
Things kind of go a little bit back and forth, don't they?

1793
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Well, I was didn't really have a last minute story,

1794
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:53,000
but this was brought to my attention just before I started the show.

1795
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:59,000
So I was watching one of my game dev YouTubers and stuff talking about game jams and stuff like that.

1796
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:04,000
So there's one of the things that was sponsored by that video is this thing called core,

1797
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:08,000
which is this like a platform that you can build games.

1798
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:11,000
And then there's like a dozen or dozens of them out there.

1799
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:19,000
This one, though, I'm not it's built off of the unreal engine and all the art assets look like it's straight out of Fortnite.

1800
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:24,000
I mean, it's very similar character models and very similar art assets and stuff.

1801
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:29,000
But it's kind of cool, though, because they have that where you can cater to actually building multiplayer games and everything.

1802
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:36,000
And it looks pretty smooth. So something I was thinking about checking out just to kind of see if my kids want to play there or something like that.

1803
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:40,000
But I've heard that this like asset dumping thing is a problem, though.

1804
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:47,000
Like didn't do we have a story on it last week or did I just I just read it somewhere about how like on the Nintendo Switch, people are like.

1805
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is not this is not like that.

1806
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:58,000
So, OK, this is more of like this is a platform kind of think of like like a Roblox or something like that where you build stuff.

1807
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Oh, OK. OK. On that platform. Yeah.

1808
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:09,000
And it's also since it's using the epic game engine or whatever or not epic games, unreal engine,

1809
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:14,000
I'm starting to think maybe it's somehow affiliated with epic somehow.

1810
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:20,000
I mean, the art assets look very similar. Like if you you saw a screenshot of this, you'd be like.

1811
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:26,000
Is that Fortnite? Because it looks like Fortnite. So if you're interested in checking out, it's core games dot com.

1812
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:33,000
And it's just you can create a free account and you play games that people made or make your own things or just play around with it and stuff like that.

1813
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Not really sure how they make money with it, but it looks neat. I don't know.

1814
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:44,000
So, yeah, it's all basically like unreal engine. You can expand it with Lua or you don't want to program anything.

1815
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:50,000
You can just I think they have I'm guessing maybe it's like blueprints or something, but it looked kind of cool.

1816
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:57,000
You know, something mess around with. So that was something I was going to bring up because I know I will check it out.

1817
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:00,000
I love the idea of using that as like a family bonding time thing. That's cool.

1818
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Well, yeah, because they like they want to like they always play.

1819
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:14,000
Well, not Fortnite, but they've been playing a lot of roadblocks and doing stuff like that or playing Minecraft, skyblock and stuff like that.

1820
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:20,000
So. But if they can make their own games, it's sort of like, you know, Fortnite or something like that.

1821
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:26,000
I mean, the graphics look great. And I don't know exactly how it works and what you can build with it.

1822
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:31,000
But like, I mean, it looks pretty. So there's at least that. All right.

1823
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Well, I think we're going to go ahead and wrap things up here at Orange Launch Radio for the night.

1824
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Thank you guys so much, though, for tuning in to our show.

1825
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:41,000
If you like what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend about the show.

1826
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

1827
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:48,000
And when the voices are but without the voices here to put out on the air, you know.

1828
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:51,000
So we've got to get more people here to join our little family here.

1829
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Orange Launch Radio and the Voice of Geeks Network.

1830
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:57,000
We put the fun and dysfunction. That's right.

1831
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:01,000
So, again, thank you, everybody who did tune to turn out tonight.

1832
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
We really appreciate a five star review.

1833
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Just a simple recommendation, a link to, you know, our show on whatever podcast platform you use.

1834
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:14,000
iTunes, Spotify, Google Podcasts, whatever it is you're using.

1835
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Help us spread the word.

1836
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:22,000
An auto host on iTunes. An auto host on Twitch goes an awful long way as well.

1837
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:25,000
So we really appreciate those for those of you that auto host the Voice of Geeks Network.

1838
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Really, really appreciate that as well.

1839
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
Quick plug for something I'm doing on the side.

1840
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:32,000
We talked about this on Bobby's show a little bit, but I want to mention it here.

1841
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:36,000
On my personal Twitch channel at Rob Roberts, on Wednesday night,

1842
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:40,000
myself and my buddy Arya Snark from Shaking and Crying,

1843
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:43,000
we are going to have a watch party of the Birdcage.

1844
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
And you're all invited.

1845
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:48,000
If you do want to watch the movie with it, like we can't broadcast the movie,

1846
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
but we're using Twitch watch parties to do it.

1847
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:54,000
So if you have an Amazon Prime account, you can watch the movie along with us.

1848
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:57,000
Otherwise, if you have like a DVD copy or you have the movie another way,

1849
02:22:57,000 --> 02:23:00,000
we will say start the movie now.

1850
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
We'll do that whole type of thing.

1851
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:07,000
I have it on Apple TV myself, so maybe I'll do it with you.

1852
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Perfect. Perfect.

1853
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:11,000
So yeah, if you want to watch along with technology, you can use Amazon Prime.

1854
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:15,000
If you want to do it by hitting play at the same time, that's fine too.

1855
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Like if you're like a second out of sync, it's not going to be a big deal.

1856
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Come on. It's the Birdcage.

1857
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:22,000
We're going to watch camp movies because that's what's fun.

1858
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
Can you believe I've never seen it?

1859
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:25,000
Oh my gosh.

1860
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Right?

1861
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Yeah. Well, you know what's funny?

1862
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:31,000
We're starting to already plot out like if we have fun doing it and it goes as well.

1863
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:34,000
So we think it's going to do and we turn this into a weekly thing.

1864
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
We're plotting out what movies we want to do next.

1865
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:40,000
And we're finding like there's stuff where like Victoria hasn't seen it.

1866
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:41,000
And I'm like, girl.

1867
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
And there's only anti meme is on your list.

1868
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
There's I don't think it is yet.

1869
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:46,000
But what was that?

1870
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Is that on prime?

1871
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:49,000
Because I don't know.

1872
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Yeah, we're restricted to the meme should be required to watch.

1873
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:53,000
I know. I know.

1874
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:58,000
But like if Paris is burning was there, we'd be doing that in a heartbeat.

1875
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
You know, there's just not everything is on Amazon Prime.

1876
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:05,000
But and I said this, too, if it does well enough and we're like, you know,

1877
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:08,000
maybe we need to do this for not just movies that are on Amazon Prime.

1878
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:13,000
We will record podcast commentary tracks that you can use for.

1879
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
And then we can do things like any name.

1880
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Paris is burning and things like that.

1881
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
So we'll see, though. We'll see.

1882
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
All right.

1883
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:25,000
As you wonder, Matt says, here is the real question is sleepaway camp on it.

1884
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
No. And I checked.

1885
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
But there are some cheesy horror movies.

1886
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:32,000
And the rotation on Prime is always changing.

1887
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
So you never know. Anyway, you know what?

1888
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:39,000
If you ever do a serious movie and I am so obsessed right now with Midsommar,

1889
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
I would love to see you guys react to it.

1890
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:44,000
But it would be really, really hard to do, I think, for a live stream.

1891
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
I haven't seen that movie yet.

1892
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:49,000
And I'm a little afraid because I've heard things.

1893
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:53,000
Is the Nicolas Cage version of the Wicker Man on there?

1894
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Because that would be awesome.

1895
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:59,000
I don't believe it is. Nifty 805 says showgirls, showgirls, showgirls.

1896
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:02,000
We would be there in a heartbeat again if it was on Amazon.

1897
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
You don't know shit.

1898
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:08,000
But my favorite movie of all time is on Amazon Prime.

1899
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:11,000
And so that will definitely be in the rotation in the next couple of weeks.

1900
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:14,000
We'll leave it at that. Anyhow, let's wrap up the show.

1901
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:15,000
I know what it is.

1902
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:18,000
Enough about me. Let's talk to my other hosts and wrap things up.

1903
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:21,000
So that'll count as my final thought because I give a nice big plug there.

1904
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
So, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

1905
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:30,000
I was actually planning on doing a live tweet of me watching Hereditary for the first time

1906
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:31,000
because I haven't seen it.

1907
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
That is on Prime as well, I think.

1908
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:39,000
Is it? I mean, I've got Prime, but I already bought it on Apple TV+.

1909
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:44,000
So I did it when I watched Midsommar.

1910
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:47,000
And of course, I've seen Midsommar now like a bunch of times since then

1911
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:50,000
because it's like the best movie if I want to cry or something.

1912
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:57,000
But I would love to have people there to see me kind of freak out a little bit

1913
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:01,000
over really weird, mentally disturbing stuff.

1914
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Fun!

1915
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:03,000
Alright.

1916
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Well, you know what I like. I play Silent Hill for fun.

1917
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:09,000
I know. It was good to have you back tonight, Jamie.

1918
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:10,000
It was good to be back.

1919
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Good. I'm glad to hear it.

1920
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:15,000
And last, but certainly not least, Loki, what's your final thought tonight?

1921
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:22,000
My final thought is, has Jamie seen the trailer for Medium yet? Or The Medium?

1922
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:23,000
No.

1923
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
You need to go watch the trailer for The Medium.

1924
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:31,000
It's a new game that's coming out by the folks that did the Blair Witch project game on Xbox.

1925
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:38,000
And it's a very Silent Hill-esque type game and it has music by Kiryamaoka in it.

1926
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
You know what? I did hear of that.

1927
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Gosh, what's it on?

1928
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:45,000
Xbox, but that means Windows 10 too.

1929
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Okay. Well then, yeah, I can do it here.

1930
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Okay, cool. Yeah, thanks for letting me know.

1931
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Alright.

1932
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
Well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1933
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:55,000
Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting the show.

1934
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000

Stay safe.

1936
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:01,000
I know things are crazy right now, but enjoy a game.

1937
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Be well.

1938
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:03,000
We're wishing you all the best.

1939
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
I know it's just like crazy times.

1940
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:10,000
I'm glad we could at least have these few hours together every Sunday night throughout all of it.

1941
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:11,000
So, that's really all I've got.

1942
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
We'll see you next time in seven days.

1943
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:14,000
Good night, everybody.

1944
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:15,000
Until next time.

1945
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:19,000
