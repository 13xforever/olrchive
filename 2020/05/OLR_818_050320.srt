00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This week Xbox Game Pass, the Netflix of Xbox and PC games crosses 10 million subscribers.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,240
On the cusp of a new gaming generation, PS Now and Game Pass seem to be settling in to

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,240
change game purchasing.

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,960
This is just one headline from the week's news, stay tuned for more, starting right

5
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:32,320
now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,760
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,920
where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,240
818 for this May the 3rd of 2020.

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,220
My name is Rob Roberts and I am all alone here in Studio N7 because like many folks

10
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,080
in the world, we're doing the social distance thing right now so I'm here to talk about

11
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,760
video games and on Discord are my pals DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,720
I'm emotionally distant.

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,920
Emotionally distant, well glad you're able to get close enough to do the show tonight

14
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,920
with us.

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,440
How's your week been?

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:22,080
It's been, I'm back at work, mostly able to finish a day so not too bad, I got a rotation

17
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:29,240
that will hopefully lead to a full promotion so I start training on tomorrow and I'm nervous

18
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,040
sighted about it.

19
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,400
It's progress at least, glad to hear that things have been improving since I know you

20
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,720
were really sick and congratulations once again on the promotion.

21
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,560
I think we talked a little bit about that last week but congrats again.

22
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,560
All the same.

23
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,560
Thanks.

24
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,360
Hey, I know one thing I wanted to ask you about was, because you talked about it weeks

25
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,720
ago on the show, your apocalypse garden that you've decided to start amongst this whole

26
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,680
thing because I have to admit, I don't know if it's Animal Crossing or what, but all of

27
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,800
a sudden I've been like, I need to try to grow more flowers and all this stuff and I'm

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,400
just like, ooh, gardening.

29
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,220
So how's that going for you?

30
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,680
It's going pretty well.

31
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,980
Of course, some of my seedlings died, my tomatoes all died because I need a shadier place to

32
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:14,980
put them in.

33
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,720
Oh, I hit the wrong button.

34
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,360
Anyway, I have a spinach that survived.

35
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,440
I have two rainbow carrots that survived.

36
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,960
I have four cucumbers.

37
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,780
One of them isn't doing so well.

38
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,460
I have some chives.

39
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,080
I have my shiso finally died.

40
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,280
I feel bad about it because it was delicious.

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:50,520
And actually, I have basil that's now potted and I would gladly leave one or two on your

42
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,560
doorstep.

43
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,560
Oh, that's a long trip, though, for that.

44
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,560
No, we'll see.

45
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,760
Quickly, just going to our chat room, because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night

46
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,240
at the voice geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network.

47
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,600
We're on live Sundays at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby

48
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,120
Black Wolf show.

49
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,380
And fifth dream today in our chat is saying, I'm like, what?

50
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,840
There aren't tomatoes in Animal Crossing.

51
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,740
No, believe it or not, we're talking about like real gardening, because what's interesting

52
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,220
how sometimes it may take a video game to kind of make you think about, oh, I should

53
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,700
like do this IRL.

54
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,540
And I'm not saying necessarily dark soccer was inspired by well, I shouldn't speak for

55
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,540
you.

56
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,980
Were you inspired in part by Animal Crossing for gardening?

57
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,100
Really?

58
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,220
I had wanted to try my hand at vegetables and I've grown tomatoes and cucumbers before.

59
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,100
And Dan was kind of on a pickle kick for a little bit.

60
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:45,620
So I decided just to start growing things I had already ordered the seeds before Animal

61
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,740
Crossing was out.

62
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:53,980
And I had I actually had them in the sprouting container.

63
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,700
I want to say like, I put them in to sprout them like a day before Animal Crossing came

64
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,260
out.

65
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,900
And Bobby Black Wolf is going to take that back before that it was well before that Bobby

66
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,100
Black Wolf is reminding us that the tomato update is next month in Animal Crossing.

67
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:12,420
Well, I mean, if leaks are to be believed, which leaks so far here, right, but a bump

68
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:18,140
pun, if the leaks are to be believed, we will be getting vegetables in Animal Crossing.

69
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,380
We don't know when we're waiting for Nintendo to confirm it.

70
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,940
And everything should be considered a rumor until Nintendo confirms it.

71
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,500
But it would seem it would seem likely.

72
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,540
And I think we had a story last week on the show that Animal Crossing has a path for regular

73
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,480
updates for some time.

74
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,200
And it would make a lot of sense for sure for that game.

75
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,460
So why not bring on the vegetables?

76
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,660
The coding hasn't lied so far.

77
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,660
Yeah.

78
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,420
I'm completely correct about Red being on a ship.

79
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,860
Yeah, which isn't something you might be able to guess otherwise, because that was new.

80
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,940
He wasn't on a ship before.

81
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,940
Exactly.

82
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,260
And the little bit of coding about Rover, we saw how that worked out this week.

83
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,260
Mm hmm.

84
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,860
So, so you're saying.

85
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,860
All right.

86
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,780
Well, also joining us, of course, right now via Discord.

87
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,180
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

88
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,180
Hello.

89
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,180
Hi, Loki.

90
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,180
How are you doing?

91
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,180
I'm fine.

92
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,180
Yeah.

93
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,700
Go ahead.

94
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,700
I was going to say, you feel tired.

95
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,700
Oh, you know, like it's it's I've been reading up on this because it's been doing a number.

96
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,980
This whole quarantine thing has been doing a number on me as well.

97
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,340
And I've I've been trying to go out and like be more active and stuff and actually make

98
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,100
sure I'm walking every day and that sort of thing.

99
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,340
But I still like I just I'm so freaking tired.

100
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,500
But there is there is a science to it.

101
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,580
There's reasons why, like, you know, some of the things that your body's kind of going

102
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:40,700
through is you are in general just kind of not being as active if for some reason just

103
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,220
kind of like makes you tired.

104
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,980
So like, I feel you.

105
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,980
I'm right there.

106
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:51,820
I take I had I had a day a couple of weeks ago where I took three naps like it.

107
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,820
It's crazy.

108
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,820
Right.

109
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,820
I remember those times.

110
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,820
All right.

111
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,820
Yeah.

112
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,820
That's true.

113
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,860
I don't have kids, but I do have Mr. Smoosh.

114
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,060
And believe me, he will wake you up as well.

115
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,940
Any projects you've been working on in this, you know, quarantine time?

116
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,500
No, not really.

117
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,500
Yeah.

118
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Yeah.

119
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,140
I didn't really work on my game this week too much.

120
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,940
Just by the time I get, you know, after that day, like working and everything, it's just

121
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,940
like I'm just drained.

122
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,020
I can't concentrate enough to like actually do programing and stuff.

123
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:27,020
And normally I would leave that to like one of the weekends, weekend days, I guess.

124
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:32,100
So I had done everything that I normally would spread out across two days yesterday.

125
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,060
And I was hoping to get that done today, but then it just didn't happen because I ended

126
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,820
up having to help me some with his like school project.

127
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:44,940
And then I cooked meatball subs.

128
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,420
So I had to make garlic bread and stuff like that.

129
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,900
So I don't know.

130
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,900
OK.

131
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,380
So Chef Loki is still a thing because it's actually being asked in chat.

132
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,820
Gripper 02 in chat is asking, so is Loki making his own pizzas now?

133
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,700
But, you know, cooking with Loki is still a thing.

134
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:05,620
I could, but like I just haven't been doing anything like that.

135
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,180
We ordered out this week a little bit, so we did that a few times.

136
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,660
But no, I haven't been able to make pizzas, but I've been like cooking a lot of things

137
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,100
like a few things each week.

138
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,100
Yeah.

139
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,100
Yeah.

140
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,860
We have to eat out here and there too, just to kind of break the monotony of cooking at

141
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,860
home.

142
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,900
And it's a fine line to get.

143
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,840
Like we have to do like a little bit of everything because I'm kind of like it's so much cheaper

144
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,580
if you just go to the restaurant and pick it up.

145
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,540
But then it's like, well, you still want to be able to help the drivers that are trying

146
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,540
to get by.

147
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,980
But those companies take such a huge share.

148
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,820
So it's like, what's the you know.

149
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,660
So we just we tried to do a little bit of everything, but not too much of one thing.

150
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,500
I think that's all you can do.

151
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Exactly.

152
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,500
All right.

153
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Let's see.

154
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,500
S2100 Matt says Loki is not at the stage where he is rolling white bread into stick form

155
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,100
and dipping it in spaghetti sauce to make breadsticks.

156
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,260
No, we're not there yet.

157
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,140
I mean, the pizza place you always go to isn't closed.

158
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,700
So you can still go there.

159
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,700
No, it's not.

160
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,620
And they keep bugging me every single day that they want me to order something.

161
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:08,740
I'm like, no, no, I'm not going to do that every day.

162
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,340
Some places are opening up all of a sudden, like some places during, you know, when the

163
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:21,000
shutdowns all started, not every restaurant necessarily opened for for takeout and delivery.

164
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,940
Some just stayed closed, but just on May 1st, some have been opening back up.

165
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,580
For example, you know, I don't want to I don't want to give him a free ad, but we ordered

166
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:40,980
from an ancient pasta factory that had stopped that they weren't open for the last month

167
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,980
or so.

168
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,020
But they just started again, I guess, on on May 1st.

169
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,380
And there's a more local chain.

170
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,780
I'll shout them out because they're local, the Moss Taco Bar.

171
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,940
They just started again on May 1st.

172
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,580
So it's it's interesting how some places kind of have just had to accept, like, you know,

173
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,300
maybe they were going to be able to be closed for a month.

174
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,260
But now it's like, oh, we we kind of have to do this for a little bit or whatever.

175
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,140
We had new stores even opening up over here.

176
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,780
So like we just got a five guys down the street.

177
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,280
So that's another option.

178
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:13,340
And there's a gym boys opening up over there, too, right next door.

179
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:18,160
So I was like almost went over there today, but then I made the garlic bread stuff.

180
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,340
So I didn't end up doing that.

181
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,740
And Bobby Blackwell says people got rent to pay.

182
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,180
Yeah, that's true. I mean, some people may not have foreseen this lasting as long as

183
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,180
it has.

184
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,860
And, you know, it's well, I keep saying it's going to go on longer.

185
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,900
But, you know, if you've listened to the whole, like, staged reopening thing, restaurants,

186
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,380
I believe in one of the recent governor because we're all in California, so one of the recent

187
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,380
governor knew some updates.

188
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,540
He said restaurants in some form should be a few days away, although it'll be, you know,

189
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,540
reduced occupancy.

190
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,260
And, you know, our work has already said, like, basically, even if if they were to lift

191
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:56,100
the restrictions tomorrow when this was on Friday, so they're going to lift the restrictions

192
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,100
tomorrow.

193
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,460
We wouldn't go back to work until the very earliest the end of June.

194
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,820
So right now it's looking like at least the end of June.

195
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,820
Yeah.

196
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,820
We're probably much later.

197
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,260
My work has been asking people if they were ready to go back and fully accepting if they

198
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,260
said no.

199
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,260
Yeah.

200
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:17,220
My work has basically said we're not going to mandate anyone goes back until there's

201
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,300
a cure or a vaccine.

202
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,260
So I mean, knock on plastic is what I have here in the studio.

203
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,260
We're all very fortunate.

204
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:28,340
I know a lot of people out there, you know, do not have as flexible work scenario.

205
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,160
So believe me, I know I'm very, very lucky in this whole scenario.

206
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,980
And that's why I'm trying to support every little thing.

207
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,820
I get a little driver over here, arrest a local restaurant over here and so forth.

208
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:44,340
But you know, just staying home at the end of the day is the most important thing.

209
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,340
Because we do live in the capital of California.

210
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,100
I'm sure you've seen what's been going on downtown in the news.

211
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,740
I want no shape or part of that.

212
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:56,180
So I am going to stay right here in my nice little part of suburbia where I am.

213
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,380
And I think that's the best we can do for right now.

214
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,380
All right.

215
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,520
Anyway, obviously, one thing we do when we're inside is we play a lot of video games.

216
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,500
And so of course, here on this program, we sit and talk about video games for a few hours

217
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,660
every week with all of you guys in our chat room who care to join us live Sunday nights

218
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,580
at the Voice of Geeks network.

219
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:20,080
But of course, our show is free in an audio only podcast forum as well as our podcast

220
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,080
has existed.

221
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,660
You know, the audio show has existed for like 18 years now, just about.

222
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,300
So we don't plan on that going away anytime soon.

223
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,300
If you want to participate that way, send us feedback throughout the week either at

224
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,300
vog network.com.

225
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,580
You can leave comments on prior episodes.

226
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,160
You can always email us participate at orange launch radio.com.

227
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,660
Or you can send us a tweet at OLR many different ways to interact with us throughout the week,

228
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,660
even if you aren't able to make it here live on Sunday night, because I know even with

229
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,620
people locked down at home, but there's still a lot of other Yeah, there's other things

230
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,580
you might have a regular zoom call that you're doing.

231
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,100
Maybe you got a usual meeting or a church thing you used to do on Sundays.

232
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,300
Now that's kind of virtual.

233
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,620
So I know you can't always be here live.

234
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,540
Although I have heard now some people and this has kind of been happening to me too.

235
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:05,840
Some people are falling way behind on their podcasts, because commuting was a place that

236
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:10,540
they and that was me like I used to listen to the podcast I would listen to when I would

237
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,580
commute to work.

238
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,460
And now that's kind of like not a thing.

239
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:19,300
So I've fallen behind a little bit, although I've, I try to listen to some while I play

240
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,300
MMOs.

241
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,100
I will do like crafting gathering in an MMO, which is very mindless and listen to podcasts.

242
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,660
So you know, if you're able to join us great, if not, I understand these are crazy times

243
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,660
right now.

244
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,420
But we're gonna talk about the news with you guys.

245
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,340
We are not here to report the news.

246
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:40,460
Because I think you guys, you know, if you're, if you're perceptive enough to find a gaming

247
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,500
podcast, you probably already have your finger on the pulse of games a little bit.

248
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,260
But we're here to talk about it.

249
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:50,500
I'm giving this longer spiel because it's been a few months since I've introduced OLR.

250
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,200
So just to remind people, this show was formed.

251
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,300
Because the three of us, we all met playing a little arcade game called Dance Dance Revolution

252
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,520
at the arcade.

253
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,180
And we used to go to a local restaurant and eat dinner.

254
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,260
We would eat very healthy mozzarella sticks, but it's okay because we burn off the calories

255
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,560
playing DDR.

256
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,220
And then we would just talk smack, but like in a good way, not always like a negative

257
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,020
way, about our constructive way, about one of our favorite hobbies, which is video games.

258
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,760
And so we kind of took that to the virtual world.

259
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,700
So welcome to our dinner table.

260
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,540
I'm sorry, I'm out of food.

261
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:27,340
Anyhow, let's get into our kickoff topic for tonight, which has to do with a big upcoming

262
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,340
video game.

263
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,020
I don't know if you want to take this one, Loki, but there's been a lot of news on this

264
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,020
game this week.

265
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,020
That's for sure.

266
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,020
Yeah.

267
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:41,420
So there's, of course, there's large big name games coming out, especially those from Sony,

268
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:46,060
which we've seen for a few E3s now, and we've been patiently waiting for them to actually

269
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,300
release it.

270
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:54,060
And unfortunately, because of things being the way they are, people just can't leave

271
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,560
spoilers out there or can't leave them to themselves.

272
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:06,160
So of course, allegedly, someone hacked Sony possibly to get some information about The

273
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:12,080
Last of Us 2 and have leaked that information out onto the Internet.

274
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,320
So it is widely out there now.

275
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:21,420
Thankfully, it seems to be that the people that are responsible for it are not affiliated

276
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,720
with Naughty Dog or Sony Interactive Entertainment.

277
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,240
However, they have an ongoing investigation to figure out what's going on with it, but

278
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,680
they do know who did it.

279
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,080
So that's kind of interesting.

280
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,040
And Bobby's clarifying in our chat that it was not a hack.

281
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,560
It was an NDA being broken by an outsourced company.

282
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,760
And to be fair on this whole situation, the narrative behind it has been changing a lot

283
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,200
as the week's been going on.

284
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,480
And I think social media is probably playing into that a little bit.

285
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,880
And you got the game of telephone going on because I know when this originally hit, it

286
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:01,960
was scorned Naughty Dog employee due to the conditions at Naughty Dog, which is a fair

287
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,760
issue and a separate issue.

288
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,600
I'll just say that. But it leaked this whole thing to get back at their employer and all

289
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,200
this stuff. And so the narrative has really been shifting as the week has been going on.

290
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,520
But it sounds like now it's this whole, well, it didn't happen from within Sony and it

291
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,320
didn't happen from within Naughty Dog, but it was definitely obviously it was somebody

292
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,320
they were working with.

293
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,680
Because like what I saw online, I mean, just recently there was another article posted

294
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,080
about how someone had gotten access to the Amazon cloud servers, I guess, Amazon servers

295
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:41,160
for Naughty Dog Games, which had development code for Uncharted 3, The Last of Us and

296
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,880
access to servers for multiplayer functionality.

297
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,520
And apparently they were able to use that to fetch files from The Last of Us 2.

298
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,760
So I don't know, maybe that was part of it, but whatever the case may be, we don't need

299
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,760
to know how it happened, but it just has happened.

300
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,280
And so, you know, that does suck that that's out there, especially for those folks who

301
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,680
are really interested in playing the game.

302
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:12,400
I haven't played The Last of Us, so I mean, it'd be unfortunate if I found out spoilers,

303
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,640
but like I wouldn't have any context to it.

304
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:21,440
Yeah, I did see the spoilers because I made, and I will not say them here, that would be

305
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,000
a dick thing to do, but I made the mistake of going to Twitter and looking at the replies

306
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,920
to one of the threads.

307
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,000
And of course, you know, people are in there and they're shouting out the spoilers because

308
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,840
some people are just the worst, trademark, at Twitter.

309
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,840
Although I did notice, I mean, it wasn't happening instantly, but I did notice that Naughty

310
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,600
Dog and Sony were using that new Twitter functionality, which I didn't even, I kind

311
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,360
of forgot it was a thing because I never saw it being used, but they were using that new

312
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,400
functionality where you can hide certain replies.

313
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,040
So they were using it to suppress some of the people that were posting spoilers, but

314
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,040
you know, tweets fly so fast that so many people were posting them.

315
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,120
And you know how shitty people are.

316
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,860
Like unfortunately, there are shitty people out there that were just searching for anybody

317
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:09,000
talking about The Last of Us on Twitter and would just reply saying, hey, bet you can't

318
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,400
wait for a blah, blah, blah, blah, you know, and that whole thing.

319
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,120
So I mean, it's, it's, it's shitty.

320
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:22,480
I would hope now, like Loki, I don't play the, I never got really invested in that series.

321
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,560
I know people do.

322
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,680
I would hope that even if I were to see the ultimate spoiler, you know, even if I were

323
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,960
to see Darth Vader is Luke's father, which, okay, I know you're all going to go, oh my

324
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
God.

325
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,960
1977?

326
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
I know, I know.

327
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,120
I know you all are going to feign shock, but give me a break.

328
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
Okay.

329
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
The movie is how old?

330
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,440
May the fourth is tomorrow.

331
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,960
If y'all didn't know, y'all didn't, y'all were never going to care.

332
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,440
So is that, but anyway, if, if, um, now where was I going with all that?

333
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,440
Oh yeah.

334
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,480
Even if you know that like Darth Vader is Luke's father, well, I think, okay, many kids

335
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,440
have grown up just knowing that as a way of life, right?

336
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,940
That yes, Darth Vader is Luke, Luke's father, but that doesn't ruin Star Wars.

337
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,100
Like you can still enjoy at least the first three movies.

338
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:12,160
I realize people may have varying opinions on the movies after that, but I think in general,

339
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,340
most people at least enjoy some people straight up fan boy.

340
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,220
Some people are like, it's all right.

341
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,460
You know, everybody's got their varying opinions.

342
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,460
Fine.

343
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:26,060
But I think for the most nowadays, the equivalent of that would be like Ray's lineage, I guess,

344
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:30,460
since you know, everybody knows who, uh, what Luke's lineage is.

345
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,740
Well, actually, actually I never saw the later movies, so don't spoil that one.

346
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,740
Right.

347
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,740
I remember his name.

348
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,740
Yeah.

349
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:42,220
But although that was a very forced twist and it was, here's the thing, here's the thing.

350
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,060
Even it was force.

351
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,060
I'm sorry.

352
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,320
Am I hosting with dark Sakura or the 23rd Magus?

353
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,580
Who is this on the line right now?

354
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,580
Old OLR joke.

355
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,580
Old OLR joke.

356
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,580
Okay.

357
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,100
So, um, I wasn't gonna say, Oh yes.

358
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,900
Even if, even if I did have it spoiled, whatever those movies still ought to be good.

359
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,420
While you still know that, right?

360
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,980
Like you can still watch those movies and relatively enjoy them, even though you know

361
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,300
the big spoiler at the end.

362
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,300
Right.

363
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,220
So I would hope, and I'm not forgiving the spoilers.

364
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,220
Don't get me wrong.

365
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,060
If you're out there and I doubt anybody listening to this show is one of those people, but who

366
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:23,180
knows who stumbles upon us randomly on Twitter or Twitch.

367
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:28,140
If you're one of those people that's out there, like randomly posting spoilers, I'm not excusing

368
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,140
you.

369
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,900
You're a Dick like straight up.

370
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:36,860
But, um, I, I would think that the experience can still be a good one for people.

371
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:41,740
I hope people don't get too, too distraught if they have been spoiled and who knows, you

372
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:48,020
know, um, they're now trying to say pre-release maybe something, maybe delays happen because

373
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,020
there was a change.

374
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,880
I mean, I think they're trying to maybe, you know, missed people a little bit with what's

375
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,140
going on, but there could be a change or could be something that happens, who knows?

376
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,580
So, um, the game should still be enjoyable, I would think.

377
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,860
So I'm hoping if you did get accidentally spoiled on Twitter or whatever, that it doesn't

378
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,540
ruin the whole damn thing for you.

379
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:12,620
Don't, don't let those people have that kind of power over you, I guess.

380
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:20,380
So let's see, um, I'm looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

381
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:25,220
Bobby says, my friend was so excited to show star Wars to his six year old son and the

382
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,540
kid was like, Oh, he's Luke's father because he heard it at school.

383
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:35,180
My friend was crushed because he was excited to see the reaction, ah, other kids, man,

384
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,180
other people's kids.

385
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,180
All right.

386
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,180
What can you do?

387
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,180
Um, let's see.

388
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,140
I know what I can do.

389
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:46,900
What's that have any not have, Oh, not, not, I don't contribute to the other people's kids

390
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,900
when I'm the other people.

391
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,900
There you go.

392
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,900
There you go.

393
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,900
Um, let's see.

394
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:56,940
I would, I would rather be that crazy uncle, uh, that shows the kid, the movie that his

395
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:03,220
parents don't want him to see my uncle, he took me to see poltergeist when I was little

396
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:09,820
hope, hopefully melody is not watching, but I will tell you what, why, by the way, happy

397
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,820
birthday Charlotte.

398
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,860
Cause her birthday was just like yesterday.

399
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:19,260
Um, but when that child is older, I probably will take her to her first star rated movie,

400
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,300
but hopefully melody.

401
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,300
Didn't hear that.

402
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,300
All right.

403
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,300
Anyway.

404
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,300
Yeah.

405
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,300
That's and that's, that's the life for me.

406
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,300
So anyway.

407
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,300
Uh, last of us to those spoilers suck, but the game is still coming out, right?

408
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,300
And you know, I'm sure it'll still sell very well.

409
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,300
Right?

410
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,300
Loki.

411
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,300
I would assume so.

412
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,300
I would assume so as well.

413
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:43,340
Um, so what do you think is ultimately going to happen with this?

414
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:48,140
Cause I th I think the obvious answer is that a huge lawsuit is going to happen.

415
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,420
We're going to see, I mean, it's funny cause when Bobby was covering this topic on his

416
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,540
show, some people were saying, are they going to go to jail?

417
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:59,460
You know, which I understand not everybody necessarily, you know, gamer jail, gamer jail.

418
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,340
It's going to get tricky because well, their careers are going to go to jail.

419
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,740
That's how it was, how it was leaked out.

420
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:10,340
If it was a violation of an NDA, then they might get fired from the company that they

421
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,020
worked for might have some sort of repercussions there.

422
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:18,300
If it was God, you know, from like hacking or something like that, then there's the whole

423
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,340
cyber intrusion stuff.

424
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,460
I think no matter, I think no matter what, you're going to see a lawsuit come of this

425
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,580
because I'm assuming an NDA was broken.

426
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:32,020
Let's go, let's go with the whole, um, eighth of a vendor that was working maybe for localization

427
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:36,700
or QA or something in another country, uh, was the one that ultimately leaked this.

428
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,700
Let's say it was that.

429
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:42,100
Um, then I think yours for certainly going to see a breach of contract lawsuit and I

430
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,940
think you're going to see one so big that it's probably going to shut down whatever

431
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,980
company it was because no, no, nobody else is going to want to work with that company

432
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,980
in the future.

433
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:56,220
And it kind of sucks like how much one person's actions have like screwed other people.

434
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,020
Um, and I think you're certainly going to see a huge lawsuit come of that.

435
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:03,380
But the interesting thing is, let's say it is this foreign issue where the companies

436
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:07,500
in Germany or what have you, and you know, the, uh, nod dog is in the States.

437
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,900
Then you're going to have that whole like weird international law stuff come into play,

438
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,380
which is a whole other mess.

439
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,380
Right.

440
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,940
So I don't know what happens in that case because I don't know if we've had a lot of

441
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,980
precedent for that type of thing.

442
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,980
Um, it's still a universal thing.

443
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,980
It is.

444
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,940
I mean, and they could sue them in a German court, I guess ultimately, I guess it would

445
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,860
depend on where that contract was executed.

446
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,860
Ultimately.

447
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:34,400
Um, I would think that even if it's a German country, it probably has hold or it has some

448
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,860
type of presence in the U S but you know, again, I don't, I don't really know and I'm

449
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,420
not going to pretend to know that stuff.

450
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,660
I just think it's for sure.

451
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,900
We're going to see a lawsuit and I don't know if we've seen something like that in the gaming

452
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,900
industry before.

453
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,740
I'm trying to think if we've ever had, like, I think we've had threats of it and I can't

454
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,900
think of a time.

455
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,380
Maybe this is where I need chats help.

456
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,960
I can't think of a time where one of these like breach of contract issues actually went

457
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,460
to court, but I think we're going to see it here and this is going to be a very interesting

458
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,820
new ish kind of thing.

459
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:08,820
So um, see a Tiberian chat says if someone from top chef breaks the law, would they go

460
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,820
to jail?

461
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,820
Simmons?

462
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,820
Um, you know, uh, speaking of reality shows though, there was, you know, you guys all

463
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:19,900
know I, I enjoy survivor and those types of shows and uh, it's kind of like a known fact

464
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:27,480
that, uh, well, you know, fat fact in quotes, allegedly protect myself here, allegedly a

465
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:33,260
former contestant, uh, who was kind of a no notorious villain on the show who got to the

466
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:37,900
finals twice and still never won, uh, and who continues to bully Sandra D S twine on

467
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:42,540
Twitter to this day, uh, because he's so butthurt about it, uh, apparently spoiled like three

468
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:48,020
seasons of the show, uh, and has yet to really face any repercussions from it.

469
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:53,380
Um, even though in those reality show contracts, if you break the survivor contract, you're

470
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,660
on the hook for like $5 million or something like that.

471
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,660
It's a lot of money.

472
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:01,080
You know, those shows are not cheap to produce and you know, spoilers can ruin everything.

473
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,700
So anyway, um, I'll be seeing that this is for Mark and Boone.

474
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,700
They were robbed.

475
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,700
Yeah.

476
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,700
Speaking of reality shows.

477
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,700
Yeah.

478
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,940
People very invested in Lego masters in these times.

479
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,940
Yes, yes, yes.

480
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,460
I've watched actually talking about catching up on, uh, uh, podcasting and stuff like that.

481
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:22,780
I've been watching a lot of the, uh, different, uh, behind the brick in like different podcasts

482
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,340
and YouTube shows with, uh, Mark and Boone and stuff.

483
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:29,300
And actually funny enough, uh, Mark and Boone, uh, I think it was Boone actually.

484
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:34,680
He does a YouTube show about Legos and I mean, a lot of these guys that are on the show have

485
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
their own YouTube stuff.

486
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,120
They're all like really cool with it.

487
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,360
I mean, like as far as who won and stuff, I think a lot of it, they said that the judging

488
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,360
was fair.

489
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,840
Um, that I think a lot of it is just how they kind of cut and edit the show.

490
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:54,760
Um, because like, I know one of the guys, um, Oh God, it was, uh, the guy, the one of

491
00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:00,240
the finalists with Amy or, uh, I can't remember them, but there's one dude that like, I would

492
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,920
annoy the hell out of me at first and like, I hated him and then like it got better throughout

493
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
the rest of the show.

494
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,320
And then you see like after the fact and it's like, okay, yeah, he's pretty cool.

495
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,360
Um, but the way that they kind of edit it and in a way that made it look like he was

496
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,120
just like a complete douchebag.

497
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,120
So I don't know.

498
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,400
It's creative editing, the manufactured drama.

499
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:26,960
Um, you know, and, and, and this is an important lesson about reality TV, which I'm not sure

500
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,840
if this really directly ties to games, but we'll talk about it anyway.

501
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,520
Um, and this is especially true on drag race.

502
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,520
Whoops.

503
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,520
I'm sorry.

504
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,840
I'm bringing up drag race at the top of the show, but it's important because I bet the

505
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,080
same thing will apply to Lego masters or any of your favorite reality TV shows.

506
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,800
Um, winning American idol being another huge one, winning doesn't necessarily mean winning.

507
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
Okay.

508
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,520
It's not whether you win or lose.

509
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,080
It's what you do with the opportunity that's been presented to you.

510
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,760
Uh, if you want to go to drag race, ask Tyra Sanchez who won season two, what she's doing

511
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,760
these days.

512
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,920
And then look at some of her peers like Raven, uh, Juju B Pandora box and where they're at,

513
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,040
uh, or season seven is another great example.

514
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,040
Look at Violet Chachki.

515
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,040
Although don't get me wrong.

516
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,400
Violet Chachki is actually really cool and I love her looks, but where you look at where

517
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,760
her needle is at versus Trixie Mattel and Katya who are also on that season and where

518
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,560
their needles are at.

519
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:25,320
For the record, um, Violet Chachki is doing a lot of work with, um, uh, the actual fashion

520
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:32,400
world, uh, working as a model and doing, uh, uh, a lot of, uh, design work.

521
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
Totally get that.

522
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,400
But, and I'm not trying to shade her and I'm sorry if it made it, if I made it sound like

523
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,280
I'm putting her on the same level as Tyra, however, if I were to compare her bank account

524
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,720
to Trixie and Katya, she's doing very well.

525
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,280
She's doing well, but is she doing as good as Trixie and Katya?

526
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,840
Yeah, actually I highly doubt that, but I guess we'll never know.

527
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,760
I think, uh, you might be a little contrarian there, but that's all right.

528
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,360
No, no, I've actually been, been following her for some time.

529
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,360
She's actually doing quite well.

530
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,880
I'm doing some work for Gotye.

531
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,880
Okay.

532
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,200
I'd be, I'd be curious about her YouTube views next to Trixie and Katya and what they do,

533
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,200
but yeah, it's all right.

534
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,680
Well, YouTube isn't a measure of fame and success.

535
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,840
Well, um, yeah, of course there's those, uh, concerts and the ticket sales and so forth.

536
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,080
Um, but you know, it's a different, it's a different path that, uh, they're walking.

537
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,080
That's for sure.

538
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,480
Um, or American Idol.

539
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,360
Uh, I think, uh, again, a huge example from that would be, um, Oh my God, why can't I

540
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,360
hear me?

541
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,360
Just, uh, Hudson, Jennifer Hudson.

542
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,360
Uh, and she won a freaking Oscar.

543
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,200
Uh, she didn't win that show.

544
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,780
Uh, and who won her season quick?

545
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,780
Who won the season?

546
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:40,280
Jennifer Hudson was on, it was Fantasia Fantasia did Fantasia did okay.

547
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,360
Uh, and you know, she, well, I shouldn't say, okay, she did very well, but she didn't win

548
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,000
an Oscar like Jennifer Hudson did.

549
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,660
So again, it doesn't matter like what you like do with the win.

550
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,720
It's what you do with the exposure.

551
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,100
And some winners do very well.

552
00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:01,000
Look at Kelly Clarkson, look at, um, Carrie Underwood, you know, some winners sometimes

553
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:10,100
do very well anyway, but back to back to the subject at hand about the last of us to hopefully

554
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:15,140
all these spoilers and these things do not cut into sales tremendously.

555
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,500
Uh, that would be a very, very, very sad thing.

556
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,780
Um, and I, I don't think that'll happen.

557
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,900
I think there's enough fans of the last of us where this is still going to sell very

558
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,900
well.

559
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:31,200
Uh, we'll have to see how the like COVID and all that situation kind of plays into it.

560
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,220
But seeing as it's boosted, um, which is as much as the situation sucks, it's boosted

561
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:40,660
things like animal crossing and it's boosted things like, um, Final Fantasy seven remake

562
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,000
and some of those figures we talked about last week, the last of us to only stands to

563
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,740
do pretty well.

564
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,980
All right.

565
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:52,300
So let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we

566
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,540
have been playing this week.

567
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,260
And we'll start with, okay.

568
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,100
So it looks like dark soccer stepped away for a second.

569
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,500
So actually, uh, Loki, I'm going to start with you.

570
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,780
All right.

571
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,660
So, um, I didn't play a whole ton of things this week.

572
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,340
Uh, well actually maybe we did.

573
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:11,200
So I played a little bit of, uh, earth defense force, iron rain again.

574
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,200
So I've been playing through that.

575
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,900
I think I'm a little bit more than halfway through that now.

576
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:20,220
Um, I picked up a few games on the steam well, it's not really a sale, but they had like

577
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:25,740
stuff marked down, um, so I've been playing guts and glory.

578
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:31,700
And if you're not familiar with guts and glory, guts and glory is like a 3d version of, uh,

579
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,980
happy wheels.

580
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:41,220
So it's an incredibly violent, um, physics based kind of obstacle course vehicle game.

581
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,140
And uh, so I, and it's, it's pretty violent.

582
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,820
Um, so, uh, that's been fun.

583
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:52,660
And then of course, uh, when playing a little bit of step mania as well, um, even more songs

584
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:58,320
on the cabin actually started building my own songs, but it's been so long since I've

585
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,360
used the step mania, like, uh, editor to actually make stuff that I'm so kind of ran

586
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,720
into a little bit of a learning curve with it, just trying to get songs synced up and

587
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,720
everything correctly.

588
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,200
Cause I was trying to get it like extremely like perfect right on.

589
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:17,580
But then again, you know, I don't, I'm not exactly going to be scoring any triple A's

590
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,580
on anything.

591
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,080
So I don't know how well I can sync stuff up, but I'm gonna just do my best on that.

592
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,040
Um, so I have a few songs picked out for that and been working on, um, you know, that sort

593
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,040
of thing.

594
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:36,320
And uh, that's, uh, Orna, lots of Orna, um, still playing that and almost, I don't know.

595
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,960
I think I'm almost to 170 now on that.

596
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:45,600
Um, so just try and make it up to 175 so I can get some, uh, Oh no, still 169.

597
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,440
Are you holding onto a ton of orange to unlock a new class at 175?

598
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:53,400
I'm still trying to get the class at 150, even though my character's like 164, 165.

599
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:58,680
I'm uh, I've only got like 746,000 orange right now.

600
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:03,120
So I don't have enough to like even close to getting the next class cause I think it's

601
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,240
at 2 million, but I don't know.

602
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,240
I don't really care.

603
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,160
I mean the next class doesn't look all that great anyways.

604
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,720
There's just more attack power and more HP I guess.

605
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,520
That stuff goes a long way though.

606
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,840
Like my God, when I finally upped from a, what was it, sword master or whatever it was

607
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,840
to druid.

608
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,240
No, the other way around druid to like sort of whatever, whatever the hell I am now.

609
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,880
Uh, it's, it was a huge, like I'm actually able to take things out now.

610
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,880
Like I was really struggling before.

611
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,880
I've got my, my brand new bad ass weapon that I'm leveling up.

612
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:38,400
So my current weapon that I was using is like an attack of like 550 or something like that.

613
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,120
And the new one is like 700 something.

614
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,480
So I mean, just that alone is like way more than the class as it is.

615
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,040
Um, although damage wise, it doesn't really seem to make much of a difference, which is

616
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,040
kind of funny.

617
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,920
Um, so I just have to wait for that to be done.

618
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,960
It's up, well it's been leveled up to level 10 and still got about a day and a half left

619
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,960
on that.

620
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:05,200
Um, and then everything else has been kind of being leveled up as it goes.

621
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,520
And I don't know, I've been just trying to get as much as I can.

622
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:13,520
I've got like, I've got to start doing more arenas because I have like 500 arena tokens

623
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,880
because I buy them every time that they come into the store.

624
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,480
Um, so I don't know.

625
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:22,000
I've been just trying to play a lot, doing the daily quests.

626
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,720
All right.

627
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,720
Is that it for your gaming week?

628
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,720
That's it.

629
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
All right.

630
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,680
I will go to my gaming week.

631
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,400
So I've been continuing to play Animal Crossing.

632
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,240
Of course, a lot, a lot of Animal Crossing.

633
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,240
Bummer Jamie had to walk away for a minute cause I'm sure we could geek out about Animal

634
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,240
Crossing.

635
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,240
We'll do that a little later.

636
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,680
I've been working on my gardens, um, uh, in Animal Crossing and trying to set up, I think

637
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:49,960
I only have one more like a flower I really need to work on crossbreeding and growing

638
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,960
and all that stuff.

639
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,920
Uh, and I'll get around to that at some point.

640
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,160
Um, I've actually been trying to work a little more with terraforming.

641
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,720
I'm not trying to go too crazy, but like, I didn't want to like redo my island completely

642
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,720
or any of that.

643
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,840
I'm very much like, I'll just kind of work with what I got, but like I wanted to make

644
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,680
one of my cliff areas where my garden is just a little bit bigger.

645
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,640
So I like added a couple more squares around the side and I kind of did that whole thing

646
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,640
with the terraforming.

647
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,240
So I was working with that a little bit and otherwise just, um, you know, just signing

648
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:22,260
in visiting my friends towns to pick up do it yourself patterns or the various visitors

649
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,860
that are there and see what's going on and so forth.

650
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,520
It's still a fun social game.

651
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:32,000
Um, speaking of social stuff, I'm still playing Final Fantasy 14 even though, you know, it's

652
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,200
kind of a lull between patches right now, but just trying to grind out the tomes and

653
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,340
make sure I can buy the highest level gear that's available with the tomes that you get

654
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,340
every week.

655
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,340
So there's that.

656
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:46,220
And then continuing on with things like Orna, we just talked about and Pokemon Go, which

657
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:49,260
just launched the remote rating right and Pokemon Go.

658
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,900
So I actually finally got to do one of those remote raids.

659
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:56,900
So in the little chat group, which I haven't been very good at checking in on a lot lately,

660
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,820
they were like, oh, we're going to do this park.

661
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:03,660
And it's a park that like, it's it's far enough away where it is on my radar, but it's like

662
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,760
so far away.

663
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,820
It's like that grayish color that like it's fading into the horizon.

664
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,700
It's so far away.

665
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:14,540
So yeah, I'm able to get it barely.

666
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,540
So we raided at that gym.

667
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,420
And that was kind of nice to just see that whole remote thing in action.

668
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:23,620
And then what we did, we walked over to the park that's like right near me, that has a

669
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,620
gym.

670
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,420
Alan and I walked over there and we were the only ones there.

671
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:31,140
And there were like 15 accounts in the gym, all fighting.

672
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:36,360
And usually you'd be like, spoofer, boo, spoofer, but obviously it's a very different world

673
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,360
we're in now.

674
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,280
You have sanctioned spoofing essentially within the game.

675
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,360
So that's been kind of interesting.

676
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:47,460
Otherwise, I'm trying to do those Kanto quests that are going on right now and I'm stuck

677
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,520
on one of them, which ironically I think is raiding.

678
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,800
I just need to wait for like a one star to pop up as a remote raid and do it.

679
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,640
And then to finish the location game talk, I spent a little time yesterday with Ingress

680
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,200
because they did a virtual event.

681
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,680
So, you know, Ingress is very much a game that is played out in the real world.

682
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,280
And back in October, I was talking about a live event that happened here in Sacramento

683
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:15,480
that had like 300, 400 people all playing the game downtown and having a good time and

684
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,480
all that stuff.

685
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,880
Obviously, our world is not built for that right now.

686
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,880
They pretty regularly will do these events called First Saturday, where like a small

687
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,960
group of maybe 50 people will get together and play the game on the first Saturday of

688
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,080
the month, explore a new town, do some missions, just kind of have fun in the sun.

689
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,560
Obviously, our current world state doesn't lend well to that model.

690
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,940
So they did the first virtual First Saturday this past weekend.

691
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,940
And that was kind of neat.

692
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,680
It was different.

693
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,740
We hung out on a Zoom call and we all recharged portals.

694
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:52,520
But then we did like a group OPR or Niantic Wayfarer, right?

695
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,640
So we all went in there and reviewed things together as a group.

696
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,920
And that was actually kind of fun to talk about that with people from the other faction

697
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,200
to kind of get a sense of where their head is at.

698
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,380
And some of the things we agree on and we don't agree on always when it comes to and

699
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,380
everybody was cordial.

700
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,460
Nobody was like, you're wrong, you know, but we kind of talked about, oh, I don't know

701
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,620
if I would view it that way.

702
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:13,300
I might have one starred that because this or whatever it is.

703
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,020
So it was nice to be able to talk about that.

704
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:19,620
And it was really funny because some of the same submissions would come up.

705
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:25,660
Like three of us got this submission called Dad's Computer that was showing up.

706
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:30,260
And it was legit, probably a nine year old who took a screenshot of a computer screen

707
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:33,860
on Google and was trying to submit that as a pokey stop.

708
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,500
Oh, I forgot to mention.

709
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:41,820
So remember how I had submitted that, like the pokey stop request for like or Ingress,

710
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,660
I guess it was back a long time ago for that code Ninja's place.

711
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:50,440
Finally, almost a year later, they finally rejected it.

712
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,180
It took a whole year.

713
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,180
Can you talk about something for a minute?

714
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,580
I need to handle something.

715
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,580
Yeah.

716
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,580
So it was ridiculous, because I was like, you know, what is going on?

717
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:03,820
And trying to get a response to at least say, OK, is this going to pass or not, which

718
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:11,860
I really should have, but because they gave a mural that was to a yogurt place next kind

719
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,900
of across the way, they gave that as a pokey stop.

720
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:19,300
But I thought, you know, let's put a mural in this one and then I can hit it from where

721
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,300
I'm sitting.

722
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:25,300
Although, to be fair, I can also hit the yogurt shop as well because it's close enough.

723
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,500
But I don't know.

724
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:32,340
I thought I would have made a good pokey stop, but I guess whatever.

725
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,940
So that Ingress event was pretty fun.

726
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:39,500
And they actually I didn't realize this, but Niantic rewarded those of us that participated

727
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,060
a free upgrade.

728
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,660
So one of our portals got upgraded.

729
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,400
That's cool, except all my submissions are in Puerto Rico because I submitted them all

730
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,700
when I was on the cruise.

731
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,480
So you're welcome if you live in Puerto Rico.

732
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,180
I added some pokey stops in Old Town.

733
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,260
So anyway, what else have I been playing?

734
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,620
Oh, a new game.

735
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,140
I'll talk quickly about Streets of Rage 4.

736
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:04,960
So I was able to play Streets of Rage 4 because it's on Xbox Game Pass, actually.

737
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,620
That was a really pleasant surprise.

738
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,660
I guess they probably did announce that.

739
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,780
I forgot.

740
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,820
I just looked at the Game Pass app on Friday or something.

741
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,380
I was like, oh, Streets of Rage 4 is here.

742
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,620
I want to check that out.

743
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,940
So I did download that and check it out.

744
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,660
And as you know, of course, Streets of Rage 1, 2, and 3 were Genesis games.

745
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:26,420
It was an old school beat-em-up like Final Fight or a lot of those games you played at

746
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:30,020
a pizza parlor in the 90s, those beat-em-up hell, the Ninja Turtles game, one of the most

747
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,860
popular in that genre of beat-em-ups.

748
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:39,220
And so Streets of Rage, now that we're years and years later on the Xbox One, and I know

749
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:44,420
this is on Nintendo Switch and all the platforms, is really kind of that same formula, except

750
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,980
it's not pixelated.

751
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:49,200
It's more hand-drawn, although I believe there's a retro mode in it, but you don't have it

752
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,500
right away.

753
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,220
The only thing that was weird for me at first is that they actually changed the controls

754
00:39:54,220 --> 00:40:02,340
a little bit, but you can go back and change to a different layout if you need to.

755
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,600
So I didn't do that.

756
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:11,020
So I played with the default, which is this new one, where they add a button for you to

757
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,560
be able to pick things up.

758
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,800
So you can actually pick up food and pick up what...

759
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,900
So it's a little weird because you don't use the attack button to do that, you use a separate

760
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,900
button.

761
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,300
So I'm real getting used to it.

762
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:25,860
But again, you can change it back, I just kind of played with what the default was,

763
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,060
which was this very weird kind of thing.

764
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,780
So yeah.

765
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,740
But otherwise, it's fun.

766
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,740
The music's...

767
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,080
Of course, I was curious what the music would be like.

768
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:39,420
And even though the music is more like the old Streets of Rage game, which is good, Yuzo

769
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:45,740
Koshiro's involved, I like Yuzo Koshiro from the stuff he did with the driving games and

770
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,260
Actraiser and some of the other stuff.

771
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,080
So the Streets of Rage music, I like enough.

772
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,540
This is more like that, obviously, and not his other stuff, which I enjoy a lot more.

773
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,100
But it's still fun.

774
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,580
And I think if you do have Game Pass, you need to get on this.

775
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:06,220
Otherwise, I think they're asking like 30 bucks for it, which may sound a little steep,

776
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:11,540
but I feel like there's a lot of features that you kind of unlock as you go that are

777
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:15,260
gonna make that price tag a lot easier.

778
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,860
And this is one that you can play online, unlike those first three games.

779
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:22,940
So I think that's gonna make it a lot easier for people to be able to like play online

780
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,160
with friends, especially in this day and age, right?

781
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,680
You can't go over to people's houses to play the game.

782
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,800
So playing online is going to end up being a great thing.

783
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,800
So yeah.

784
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,800
There you go.

785
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,740
Yeah, that kind of made me wonder too, because now that you mentioned the whole playing the

786
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:42,580
same room thing, I'm not sure how long this whole COVID thing is going to go on, but that's

787
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:48,740
going to be interesting once the Amico comes out, because they're all local multiplayer

788
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,940
for that stuff.

789
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,940
For sure.

790
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,940
I'm sorry.

791
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,940
Give me just another minute here, Loki.

792
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,940
Sorry.

793
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:55,940
This is live, folks.

794
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,460
What can you do?

795
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,620
So yeah, it'd be interesting to see how that's going to affect things.

796
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:05,460
I am hoping by the time that comes out in October that, you know, things will be a little

797
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,460
bit calmed down.

798
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:10,280
But you know, that is a kind of a weird scenario.

799
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,120
No one could have predicted that when you're going to release a brand new console at the

800
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,120
end of the year.

801
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,900
So what are you going to do, I guess?

802
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,600
So I don't know.

803
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,880
It'll be interesting to see.

804
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,360
I hopefully will see some more stuff for that, especially with, you know, when E3 was supposed

805
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:32,280
to have been happening in about a month or so away.

806
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:38,400
Surprised to see that we haven't heard too much from like Sony or I know Nintendo's even

807
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,640
talked about maybe not doing a digital event, but like even Sony just hearing some more

808
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,960
information about what they've got in the pipeline coming out and stuff and I don't

809
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,960
know.

810
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,960
I just want to know more information.

811
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,640
I feel like now with all these companies, you know, obviously E3 not happening and stuff

812
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,360
and a lot of these companies say, no, we're not even going to do digital events that it's

813
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,640
like, when am I going to find out my information?

814
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,640
Okay, I'm back.

815
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,640
Sorry.

816
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,840
So I'm going to have to address this at some point.

817
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,120
Dark soccer had to go.

818
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,240
She had a family emergency.

819
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,040
Something's come up that's extremely urgent.

820
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:17,120
So she's needed to go sending thoughts and well wishes to her and her family right now

821
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,120
for sure.

822
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,840
It's not my place to give specifics right now.

823
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,640
I will let her do so when she feels up to returning.

824
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,680
For now, sorry to be blunt, but it is what it is.

825
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,680
It's life.

826
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,160
Anyway, Loki, we're going to carry on with the show.

827
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,800
You were talking about retro consoles.

828
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,560
And that actually reminded me because I have it sitting right here next to me.

829
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,900
I ordered this little guy online this week.

830
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:48,960
This Neo Geo Mini is something I picked up because it was on like a super sale on Amazon.

831
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,960
Really?

832
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,960
Yeah.

833
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,000
Is that the one that looks like a little like a desktop cabinet or yes, it's like a tiny

834
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,120
it's like those other it's a tiny little cat.

835
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,680
It might be hard to see on the tour.

836
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,800
It looks like my other little arcade machines that I collect and it's got 40 games in it,

837
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,640
including like five different Metal Slug games, King of the Monsters, Magician Lord, King

838
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,720
of Fighter, you know, all the stuff you'd expect to see here.

839
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,980
I'm sure you'll have a great time seeing that on Twitch, but there's a list of all the games

840
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:16,980
from the back.

841
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,680
Why don't they just make like a arcade one up size cabinet for one of those?

842
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,680
I'm kind of surprised.

843
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,680
That would be awesome.

844
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,000
I'm kind of surprised that too.

845
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,040
But here's here's the thing that sold me on it.

846
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,560
I wasn't necessarily going to get it at first because I was like that cabinet kind of looks

847
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,620
like garbage to play on.

848
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,880
But here's the thing.

849
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,880
It has an HDMI out on it.

850
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,520
So you can actually hook this baby up to a TV and play the Neo Geo games that way.

851
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,720
I'm not sure if you can hook up a controller.

852
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,440
I think that is a thing.

853
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,680
I don't want to get quoted on that, though, but I believe I'm going to have to open this

854
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,680
up and see.

855
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:53,080
I might have it because I think some of the other minis that they've done, they can you

856
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,560
could hook up Neo Geo controllers as well.

857
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,560
Yeah.

858
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,560
So that's pretty cool.

859
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,560
Maybe somebody in chat actually.

860
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,120
Adrian today says, yes, they have controllers, so I could actually probably order those separately

861
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:07,500
if I wanted to play the Neo Geo games on the TV.

862
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,240
So that's ultimately what sold me on it.

863
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,240
I was like, oh, I don't have to play on the tiny little screen.

864
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,440
I can actually play on the television.

865
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,440
And that's pretty cool.

866
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,440
Yeah, it was awesome.

867
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:21,560
Like I said, I when I first got my candy cab, I had a multi cart for a Neo Geo thing for

868
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,560
that.

869
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,600
But then then I mailed that to Bobby for his super gun.

870
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,240
So he has that now.

871
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,280
Bobby says, when's the Twitch stream of it?

872
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,520
When I get one of those controllers that I'm going to have to buy, because I don't I don't

873
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,520
know how I would play with the tiny little thing.

874
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,400
I mean, you know, I but I collect these types of things anyway.

875
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,480
So like, you know, and for the price, what was it?

876
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,480
I think it was only 30 bucks.

877
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,480
It was like 20.

878
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,160
I think normally it's about 50 and it was down to 30.

879
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,640
And I was like, what the heck?

880
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,640
That's a good price.

881
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,260
So that'll be something I can talk about next week is the Neo Geo mini.

882
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,260
So cool.

883
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,260
Cool.

884
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:58,580
Well, let's move on and we'll get into this week's news.

885
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,420
So, Loki, why don't you start us off?

886
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:05,340
Well, they alluded to talking about other companies announcing their events and that

887
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:09,500
being kind of up in the air as far as we even have like cancellations with Nintendo and

888
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,500
stuff like that.

889
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,600
But at least there is one that we can count on and it's right around the corner.

890
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:21,540
So coming up later this week on May 7th, we will see Xbox Series X gameplay for the first

891
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,540
time.

892
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:27,380
Probably not the first time because we've had some demos, but more of it.

893
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:30,780
That's going to be coming May 7th.

894
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:38,340
They're going to show new gameplay, including a gameplay trailer for Assassin's Creed Valhalla,

895
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:43,940
which they had a cinematic trailer for that earlier this week.

896
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:47,480
So that was something.

897
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:54,280
No idea what other games are going to be out there during that time, but I'm very curious

898
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,600
to see what spec, well, they already talked about specs, but more details.

899
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,840
I want to know more details about it and just trying to get excited about that kind of stuff.

900
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,760
So I'm looking forward to that.

901
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,760
That's going to be streaming.

902
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:11,720
It looks like 11 a.m. Eastern time on Thursday.

903
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,240
She Hulk 10 in our chat says, hopefully a new fable.

904
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,240
I am with you.

905
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,240
She Hulk.

906
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:21,240
I was like to see it will be very interesting, though, without the involvement of Molyneux.

907
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,800
But I'm OK with that.

908
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,800
Let's see.

909
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,800
Let's see what else does with it.

910
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,800
Don't think I'll be a problem.

911
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,080
Yeah, I think at the end of the day, it won't be a huge issue.

912
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,080
It'll be interesting.

913
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:33,720
It'll be I'm curious what creative direction the game takes and like what kind of elements

914
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,920
it holds on to, like some of the choice things.

915
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,160
I'd be very curious about that.

916
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,920
I feel like it's going to happen.

917
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,520
I feel that the rumbles and the rumors, but we'll see.

918
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,560
I don't want to we won't necessarily see it this week.

919
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,560
I don't know.

920
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,440
Well, it sounds to me because you've got your you know, we've already kind of seen lately

921
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:53,680
with just different games how these, you know, sort of Final Fantasy seven remake.

922
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,240
But I mean, obviously the stuff would have been planned long in advance.

923
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:03,120
You know, I really think like having a core RPG game on the platform would be very essential,

924
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:08,180
especially since we're not going to have like an Elder Scrolls six for a long time or a

925
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,920
new fallout or something like that.

926
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:15,880
I would think that a fable will do very well for that as well, because you got the Halo

927
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,620
to kind of take care of like the action stuff as well in the FPS.

928
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,800
So I would I would hope that we'd see that sort of things.

929
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,200
I'm just more curious to see what's coming from all these studios that they, you know,

930
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:32,340
picked up a year or so ago to see what they're working on.

931
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:34,280
That's what I'm really interested to see.

932
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,340
S.H.A. 100 Matt in chat says, I'm ready to see this damn thing in action.

933
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:40,900
This drip feed is getting a little irritating.

934
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:46,520
And you know, yeah, I feel like this this cycle especially has really been drawn out

935
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,520
for a bit.

936
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,520
Right.

937
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,020
Hasn't it kind of felt like the PlayStation four and the Xbox one have been kind of like

938
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:54,700
lame ducks for a little bit while we're like waiting for the PlayStation five and what's

939
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,740
new with Microsoft and everything like yes, I know we've had at least still the Final

940
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:01,380
Fantasy seven remake and we're getting Last of Us two.

941
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:04,500
There are still games from this generation for us to get excited about.

942
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,280
But I can't help but feel that because we know backwards compatibility is going to play

943
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,280
into this next generation.

944
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,200
It's kind of like, OK, well, all these games are putting out they're going to work on the

945
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,480
new ones, too.

946
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,220
So let's get to that hardware.

947
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,220
So it does.

948
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:19,480
It does feel like this lead up, even though it probably honestly has been the same amount

949
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,160
of time as has been any other generation.

950
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,160
Fine.

951
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,720
It just feels like this lead up has been an awful long time.

952
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,320
Maybe that's something about the Internet age we live in.

953
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,720
I don't know.

954
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:36,200
But on this on the same side, we the first week of May is probably earlier than I think

955
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:40,040
we most of us would have been expecting to hear this information, which I think would

956
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,600
have been the first week of June.

957
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:46,000
It's hard to say what they wanted to do a pre event before E3, kind of like what happened

958
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,200
with Xbox one, although that didn't go so well for Microsoft that time.

959
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,200
You know, I don't know.

960
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:58,080
But this this regardless of why or what this is, this is this is what's going to happen.

961
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,920
So we'll get to see this week.

962
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,680
Yeah.

963
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:07,400
Gripper O2 says, are there any new games to sway us into buying the new consoles?

964
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,960
Well, that's what we're going to find out.

965
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,200
Keep in mind, Microsoft has scooped up oodles and oodles of companies over the past couple

966
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,200
of years.

967
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,340
That's some of the biggest news to come out of Microsoft.

968
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:20,520
So they've really been laying out the pieces and making strategical moves to really come

969
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,440
out swinging this generation.

970
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:27,000
So I think Microsoft stands to answer some of those questions on Thursday.

971
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,980
Will they show us everything?

972
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:29,980
I doubt it.

973
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:34,020
I would taper your expectations a little bit.

974
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:39,940
We'll probably get one or two new games that'll show off the hardware.

975
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:46,820
My guess, we will absolutely have a sports game of some type, but that will include racing.

976
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:51,740
That could include a Forza, whether it's Horizon or mainline or something new.

977
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:55,620
I would absolutely bet like Forza is somehow one of the games we're going to see.

978
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:58,620
The other game could be literally anything.

979
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:02,900
And I would guess it's really going to be, and one reason why I specifically peg racing

980
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:07,800
and sports, those are the games that really, and especially Forza, and that's why I really

981
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,540
think it's going to be Forza, something.

982
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:10,540
Forza is something.

983
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:17,140
And yes, I know it's the right year for Horizon, but I think all bets are off when it comes

984
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,780
to the regular schedule of Forza.

985
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,620
I think it could be Forza anything.

986
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,220
I'd love for it to be Horizon.

987
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:27,260
But racing games are going to really show off the power of the system and things like

988
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:32,620
ray tracing and all the things that these games are going to bring to the tables.

989
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:37,420
That's why I fully expect it'll be a Forza universe type of game that we're going to

990
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,420
see this week.

991
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:42,340
Bobby Blackwell says it'll be Forza Motorsport 8.

992
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:43,340
Yeah.

993
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:49,020
And Bobby says all Xbox consoles have released with a racing game outside the first one.

994
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,020
And I'll-

995
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,020
Oh, yeah.

996
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,020
Oh, yeah.

997
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,020
What?

998
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,020
What?

999
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,020
What?

1000
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,020
Let's see a new bridge racer game.

1001
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,020
Come on.

1002
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,500
Maybe on the PlayStation 5 reveal, but we're not there yet.

1003
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,500
We're not there yet.

1004
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,820
Come on, they're not console specific anymore.

1005
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:04,820
Come on.

1006
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:05,820
Come on.

1007
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:06,820
Come on.

1008
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:07,820
It's been like, how many years now?

1009
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:08,820
Like in the PETA one.

1010
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:12,780
I'm not counting that because that was garbage, but like, let's, let's, let's get a new, new

1011
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:13,780
Ridge Racer game.

1012
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:14,780
Come on.

1013
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:18,180
Frodo Swaggins asked a great question in chat saying, what do you think about the power

1014
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:25,500
difference between PlayStation 5 and Series X?

1015
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:29,580
I don't think we'll know until we actually see what, how the games use everything because

1016
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:32,260
like it's just all specs right now.

1017
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:35,060
It doesn't mean anything until we actually see them in action.

1018
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:41,380
Um, yeah, it, it, it doesn't really matter without the games and the proof is the Nintendo

1019
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:42,540
Switch.

1020
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,540
That's my answer.

1021
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:48,580
Nintendo Switch, because Nintendo Switch is not bringing that same technology to the table

1022
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:51,900
that these, I mean, it's a different thing with the whole games on the go and all that,

1023
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:57,140
but Nintendo Switch still look at the sales figure of Animal Crossing, the Nintendo Switch

1024
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:02,780
does very well holding its place in gaming while not being the most technologically superior

1025
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,780
console.

1026
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:07,380
I do think price is going to be important.

1027
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:14,580
Um, and I don't think Sony or Microsoft wants to find themselves as launching the more expensive

1028
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:15,580
console.

1029
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:21,020
Um, but we'll see at the end of the day, it's going to be the games that are the most important

1030
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,420
period.

1031
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:23,920
So we'll see.

1032
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,580
And She-Hulk 10 says you won't notice without a new TV.

1033
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:30,580
And that could be very, that's a very good point as well is that I still don't have a

1034
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:32,580
4k TV.

1035
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:36,100
You may not know this, you can get one like sub 500 now.

1036
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:41,020
I mean, it's like, it just, well, for one, I'm just so irritated because of how much

1037
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:46,900
I paid for the TV I currently have, but also I'm just kind of like in this day and age,

1038
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,180
I'm like, it's just not been a priority for me.

1039
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:56,140
I do have a 4k computer monitor and that's put the console in there.

1040
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:57,140
Here's the crazy thing.

1041
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:59,420
I actually bought a new graphics card.

1042
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:03,760
We've been waiting to install the new graphics card because we need a new power supply, but

1043
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,140
get this, did you know there's like some freak power supply?

1044
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:09,100
Well, I should say free cause it's probably because of COVID and all that.

1045
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:12,020
There's like a power supply shortage going on right now.

1046
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,020
Try to go get one.

1047
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:21,300
What kind of power, how, how much of a power, oh, uh, eight, one of those are like impossible

1048
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,300
to find.

1049
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,060
Uh, and seven fifties aren't easy either.

1050
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:27,820
Uh, and I feel like when I was on Best Buy site, uh, it was like, you could find things

1051
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:33,740
in the cheat, like the 300, 400 range or the 1200 range, but like everything in the middle

1052
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:34,740
ain't there.

1053
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:36,620
And Newegg didn't have anything?

1054
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:37,620
No.

1055
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:40,580
Or it was all like not in stock till the end of may and things like that.

1056
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,140
I would check eBay or something.

1057
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:44,380
eBay has been pretty fast to ship stuff.

1058
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:45,380
It's weird.

1059
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:50,940
No, I actually ordered a power supply on Amazon and it said, uh, we ordered it the first week

1060
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:56,180
of April and it said it'll be there April 28th, April 28th comes and goes.

1061
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:59,820
And the next day I get an email that's like, can you confirm you still want this because

1062
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:01,980
we don't know when we're going to have it in stock.

1063
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:03,620
And I was a little irritated.

1064
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:08,880
I thought it was because they weren't shipping anything other than essential, you know, things

1065
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:09,880
until later.

1066
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:13,720
No, cause I got, I wouldn't call this Neo Geo mini essential.

1067
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:18,080
I think I had to wait an extra day or two than I normally would, but no big deal.

1068
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,440
I'm not going to be all like, can I speak to the manager about it?

1069
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:26,040
But I was a little irked that like, I kind of felt like if they didn't have it and they

1070
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,320
didn't know when they were going to, I kind of wasn't getting a realistic, but I'm trying

1071
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:33,840
not to, you know, soccer mom manager about it.

1072
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:38,160
You know, I'm trying to just be like, all right, maybe they were expecting it, but because

1073
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:42,280
the factories are closed to the world situation, they didn't make them in time, whatever.

1074
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,280
I'm just trying to keep my cool.

1075
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,080
But yeah, it's trying to find a power supply right now is a little weird.

1076
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,360
So I don't know what's up with that.

1077
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,280
So, OK, yeah.

1078
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:56,920
Anyway, yeah, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, yeah, I really want to build a new computer,

1079
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,360
but right now is the hardest time.

1080
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:02,400
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Because everybody's trying to work from home or spending the stimulus

1081
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,560
money and all that stuff is factoring into that.

1082
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:11,920
So anyhow, back to the Xbox, we'll see more stuff this week.

1083
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,760
I'm very excited to see it in motion.

1084
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:19,320
I think a lot of us are. So we will definitely talk about that next week on the show.

1085
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:24,680
All right. In the meantime, let's talk about Google Stadia.

1086
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,080
Remember, there was a Stadia Connect that happened this past week.

1087
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,080
Did you all remember that?

1088
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,920
Yeah. Yeah. Because social media was like dead silent on it.

1089
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:36,840
And I kind of like forgot until I was looking for stories.

1090
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,280
Yeah, right. Well, here's what you missed at the Google Stadia Connect.

1091
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,880
I don't know. Like some of this news is kind of like, oh, yeah.

1092
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,760
Player Unknown Battlegrounds is now on Stadia.

1093
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,400
I mean, that is kind of a big game.

1094
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:54,840
And it's something that you can actually get for free if you are a Google Stadia pro

1095
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:58,240
subscriber, which remember, they gave that away for two months.

1096
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,080
So they have a lot of people who are pro subscribers right now.

1097
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,560
So that's a pretty big land.

1098
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,520
And, you know, first person shooter game, that's something that might look a little

1099
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:10,040
better on something like Stadia, depending on your Internet connection and all that

1100
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,360
versus, you know, how it might look on your computer without something like that.

1101
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,760
I don't know. It depends on your situation.

1102
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:20,600
But then, you know, the fact that they've also announced that they're partnering with

1103
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,360
Electronic Arts. So that's pretty big.

1104
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:27,840
They're going to bring things like Madden, FIFA and Star Wars Jedi Order.

1105
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,240
Now, say what you will.

1106
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:33,200
But let's not forget that Madden is like the biggest selling game in this country.

1107
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:37,560
So that being on Stadia now is an option.

1108
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,960
That could be interesting to see how that plays out.

1109
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:45,400
Again, I'm not sure Stadia has really proven itself as hardware to the masses, to

1110
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,920
the dirty casuals, if you will.

1111
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:52,760
But if Google can kind of push that, it would be interesting to see how many people

1112
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,040
might buy into that. I don't know.

1113
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:59,600
I think their positioning, the EA partnership is very interesting, I will say.

1114
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,720
You know, you can talk all the smack you want about Stadia, but I think that's

1115
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,640
important. And I think it's important to get people on board who might not otherwise

1116
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:11,040
be on board with Stadia because of sports, sports, sports, sports, you know, things I

1117
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,240
know we don't get into as much here on Orange Launch Radio.

1118
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,880
But I'm certainly not going to deny those games are fucking huge and that there are

1119
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,280
people that only buy sports, sports, sports, sports.

1120
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,880
And that's, you know, that they are gamers, too, for sure.

1121
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,280
So, all right.

1122
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:30,400
Anyhow, other things, Octopath Traveler, Square Enix just released on Stadia as well.

1123
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,400
That's a pretty big deal.

1124
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:35,360
And then they also talked about some games that will be first on Stadia.

1125
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:38,520
So they're not saying exclusive, but they're saying first on Stadia.

1126
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:44,480
One of the games was Crayta, which is a platform to build games and play games.

1127
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:49,480
It is very similar looking to Fortnite because it's also built in Unreal Engine.

1128
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,480
So it's a way to build and play your own games.

1129
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,000
I guess you could say like Little Big Planet or Dreams type of thing.

1130
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,520
But it'll be on Stadia.

1131
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:59,520
That's kind of interesting because I don't usually think of like create your own thing

1132
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,640
on a Stadia device because it's in the cloud, but that's kind of neat.

1133
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:09,320
Also, Ember is another game, which you play a firefighter, but it sounds like not a very

1134
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:09,680
good one.

1135
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,040
You might actually be setting fires.

1136
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,920
I don't remember what the gag was with this whole thing, but that is another game that

1137
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:14,720
is coming out as well.

1138
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:20,240
So they are showing us at least a few other games for Stadia.

1139
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,000
And if you haven't turned on your Stadia, well, I keep saying turn on your Stadia, even

1140
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,680
though it's not an actual device, but let's say fired up your Stadia account on the web

1141
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,760
or on your Chromecast, it might be a good reason to go back and check things out.

1142
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:34,160
I don't know.

1143
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,240
Player Unknown Battlegrounds might be kind of neat.

1144
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:36,720
I don't know.

1145
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,160
But I know a lot of people aren't into first person shooters either.

1146
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,880
So, so what do you think, Loki?

1147
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:44,560
Like, do you think Google, do you think the EA thinks a big deal?

1148
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:48,800
Or do you think Stadia is like, you know what, Stadia really needed to get moving by now

1149
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,680
and it still hasn't.

1150
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,560
And that's bad.

1151
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,840
I think it's the latter.

1152
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:56,000
I think it needs to have EA to be able to compete out there.

1153
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,080
I just, I don't see the draw.

1154
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:00,880
I really don't.

1155
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:07,760
I mean, aside from the potential where I don't have to buy a console to play games, it's

1156
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,240
just, I don't know.

1157
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,560
It's not something I would invest in.

1158
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,240
Yep.

1159
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:14,960
So we'll see.

1160
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:15,680
I mean, we'll see.

1161
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,440
It's an interesting maneuver.

1162
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:21,600
I don't, I don't think this week's worth of news was enough.

1163
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:27,440
I really think they needed to start to clue in how more people can get on Stadia.

1164
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,080
Like, I need to see like exclusive games.

1165
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,240
Like this is only something you can get on Stadia.

1166
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,880
Cause that's the thing is that it's like, yeah, it's cool.

1167
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,800
You have Madden, so does everybody else.

1168
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:40,000
And they've had it for a long time now and now you're just getting it.

1169
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:47,680
And it's like, I need to see like why I want to choose your platform because there's the

1170
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,840
fact that it's, it's strictly digital.

1171
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,920
It's, it's a Google service.

1172
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,280
So you're not sure it's like, is this going to be around for a long time?

1173
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,080
I mean, I just, I don't know.

1174
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:02,080
I really have a hard time trusting that this would be a good thing.

1175
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:06,640
Like nowadays, if, if everything's stayed the way it was, where bandwidth is unlimited

1176
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:13,760
and everything, maybe, uh, after everything goes back to normal, it's going to be a hard sell.

1177
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,440
And I just don't see it.

1178
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:24,240
Um, I really think Google needs to be a little more, um, like they need to reach out to a more

1179
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:28,800
casual audience a lot more aggressively, and maybe they're not ready for that for whatever reason,

1180
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:35,360
but I really think they should be running ads right now that are akin to go to stadia.google.com

1181
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,720
to play Madden right now, you know, which obviously they're not ready for that yet,

1182
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,400
but that needs to kind of be the message.

1183
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,600
They need to drop this whole, like you get a pro account.

1184
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,800
That stuff is confusing to a non gamer audience.

1185
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:50,960
It's not confusing to you or me, but to a non gamer audience, the message needs to be

1186
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,320
very fucking simple.

1187
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:56,400
It needs to be, Hey, do you want to play Madden, but you don't have a game console.

1188
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,400
Go to stadia.google.com right now to play Madden online with your friends.

1189
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,600
That should be the message.

1190
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,760
And it needs to be just that simple.

1191
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,120
If you have to jump through all these fucking hoops about, you know, signing up for this

1192
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:10,400
account and that account and tying it to your Google account, all this stuff, they're never

1193
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,720
going to tap the base that they need to be tapping.

1194
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,600
And I think it's just that simple.

1195
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,200
I think the messaging needs to be better.

1196
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:21,920
And I also want to see like the examples of that integration they were talking about with

1197
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:26,160
like YouTube and stuff, or if I'm streaming a game and someone can come join me in my

1198
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,280
game or something like that.

1199
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:32,000
Like I want to see more of that sort of thing is showing up on here, but like doesn't really

1200
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:32,960
seem like there's anything like that.

1201
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,240
Like if for some reason, I mean, Microsoft would never put it on their service since

1202
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,920
they have their own streaming service, but let's assume like, Hey, Minecraft is on there.

1203
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,800
And then you have someone streaming Minecraft and they're like, Hey, you want to come play

1204
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:43,760
with us on our server?

1205
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:48,560
You know, click this link, go and immediately connect, play Minecraft without having to

1206
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,920
have it installed or anything like that.

1207
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,640
Google could do that with YouTube if they wanted to.

1208
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,840
If they want to leverage their muscle with YouTube, they could do it because I'm sitting

1209
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:59,280
here about to make a comment about, well, one thing I don't think made our show world

1210
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:04,560
tonight, but Amazon games, um, I think talked a little more about new world.

1211
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,920
Um, I'm going to be quite honest.

1212
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:09,200
I really understand it and I'm not going to until I actually get to play the game.

1213
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,360
So that's about all I have to say about new world.

1214
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:15,360
Um, but I would imagine it would be very likely that Amazon could integrate something like

1215
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:16,240
that into Twitch.

1216
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,800
Hey, do you want to come play this MMO with me right now?

1217
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:22,480
Use this extension or whatever to just tap here and come play with me.

1218
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,880
Google could leverage YouTube to do the same thing.

1219
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,080
Well, right.

1220
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,960
They have it built in for Stadia stuff, but there's not really any games.

1221
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,920
I've seen that they're going to be using that first day.

1222
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:32,560
I don't know.

1223
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,040
I don't know.

1224
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:37,040
And I don't know if it's due to the world, you know, COVID Corona situation or what.

1225
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:40,960
Um, but I feel like Google isn't moving as fast enough as we all expected them to.

1226
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,320
This is like the best time.

1227
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:45,200
Like this is the ideal situation for them.

1228
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:50,320
And if it can't take off in the ideal situation for them, where everybody has this available

1229
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:54,880
space and a lot of people are stuck at home, it's like, I mean, it's not going to take

1230
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,640
off if this is not going to happen now.

1231
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:00,480
Now is the time for Google to do this.

1232
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:05,280
Because if they wait like literally one more month there, it's too late.

1233
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:09,440
And I, that's why I'm kind of like this, what happened this week needed to be it.

1234
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,280
And it wasn't like, I'm not saying what they announced was crap or anything like that.

1235
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,600
I don't think it was, but it wasn't enough.

1236
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:21,600
It needed to be the next phase of Stadia because now what's going to happen is now, you know,

1237
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:25,360
E3 and I'm using my quotey fingers is going to end up happening in June.

1238
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,280
When I'm using my quotey fingers, it's E3 replacement stuff and things we would have

1239
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,960
seen at E3 are going to start happening.

1240
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,880
And then it's like, oh, Madden's on PlayStation.

1241
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:33,840
I know PlayStation.

1242
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,040
I know Xbox.

1243
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,080
I know those things.

1244
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,960
I'm going to end up getting my game on those consoles.

1245
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:39,280
Yeah.

1246
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:39,440
Yeah.

1247
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,960
We're going to have Madden and we're going to have EA games on this platform.

1248
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:49,200
And then next week, you know, we're going to have all the Microsoft exclusives like,

1249
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,120
oh yeah, I want to get it on my platform.

1250
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:51,600
Well, guess what?

1251
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,720
They have their own streaming platform.

1252
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:56,160
They'll need your Google Stadia to stream those games.

1253
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:02,560
So it's like, I just don't I don't see it happening because they don't have enough

1254
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:05,280
draw to bring people to that platform.

1255
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:09,200
They need some exclusive games that are out now.

1256
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:16,000
And I'm sorry, Destiny 2 and Madden is not really going to be a draw when it's on all

1257
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,320
the other platforms already that people have had probably years already.

1258
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,920
I just I don't see it.

1259
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:22,160
Yeah.

1260
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:27,600
And something like, you know, the firefighting game, like as Ember, as cute as that sounds,

1261
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:30,720
as neat as that sounds, that's not going to pull the fucking muscle.

1262
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:34,880
Like Google, use your muscle to get that exclusive that you need.

1263
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:40,160
You know, hey, get EA to give you Madden first for a week.

1264
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:45,600
That's the kind of like big dick energy we're going to need from Google Stadia for people

1265
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,720
to be talking about it.

1266
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,640
Oh, and EA is only on that platform until they come up with their own streaming platform.

1267
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,720
I think they've already said they want to do their own thing.

1268
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:58,080
So well, there's that there's that whole EA access that kind of ties into Xbox.

1269
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:58,800
I mean, you're right.

1270
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,440
It's probably only a matter of time before Origin becomes that.

1271
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:01,920
Who knows?

1272
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:02,640
Yeah.

1273
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,520
As soon as they don't need Google anymore, they're gone.

1274
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,160
I mean, just look at like the Nvidia sharing and stuff like that.

1275
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:12,960
I mean, I'm sure all these companies will drop them as soon as they have their own solutions

1276
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,120
because they don't want to pay anybody to have their own platform.

1277
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:15,840
They want their own.

1278
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:16,960
They want to control all of it.

1279
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,480
They want their own ecosystem.

1280
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:19,680
All right.

1281
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,880
Well, let's move on to the next story because this will tie this tie into this a little

1282
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:23,280
bit.

1283
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,320
We're having to produce on the fly a little bit because Jamie was going to talk about

1284
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:26,400
this.

1285
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,920
Do you want to do this or you want me to do it?

1286
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:28,240
Sure.

1287
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,600
Let's talk about Summer Games Fest.

1288
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:30,000
OK.

1289
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:36,480
Summer Games Fest is going to be going on from now to the end of August or during summer.

1290
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:45,520
So it's basically going to be a very long like kind of industry wide celebration of

1291
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:45,920
games.

1292
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:53,200
And it's going to be like I guess this digital event that's going to include different shows

1293
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:59,760
including lives from like Bethesda, Blizzard, CD Projekt Red, EA, Microsoft, Riot, Sony

1294
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:00,720
and Square Enix.

1295
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:07,920
They said the event's going to take or they're going to stream on all major platforms.

1296
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:12,400
So Facebook, Mixer, Twitch, Twitter and YouTube.

1297
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:18,240
And they're going to have different details, I guess, for those events are going to come

1298
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,720
I guess later on as soon as they announce those.

1299
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:26,240
I don't know if the Xbox thing is necessarily considered one of those, but I don't know.

1300
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:30,560
But Steam and Xbox are going to offer demos and trials for some games limited time.

1301
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:35,920
Steam's games festival summer edition supposed to be taking place June 9th through the 14th.

1302
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:40,160
And this is all being hosted, I guess, by Jeff Keeley's putting this on.

1303
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,400
So it's pretty cool.

1304
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:47,040
I want this is where I was just saying I want to learn more about the stuff that's coming

1305
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:47,440
up.

1306
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,920
I just wish there was more of a timeline to kind of tell me, you know, when all this is

1307
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:56,160
going to happen, because it doesn't really specify.

1308
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:01,280
And like, I don't know, but it's cool.

1309
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,600
So that's kind of like their game awards thing.

1310
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:09,120
Yeah, I mean, the whole thing is kind of like interesting, but it's weird that it's like

1311
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:09,920
four months.

1312
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,440
Like, that's not that's not a festival.

1313
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,160
That's not a highlight.

1314
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:16,160
That's like a that's the general gaming news flow.

1315
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:20,960
It's like it's almost like I'm launching a website where I'm going to get all these exclusives

1316
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:21,440
first.

1317
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:23,040
And it's called Summer Game Fest.

1318
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:27,760
You know, I just like and maybe it's just because also it's this whole nature of the

1319
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,600
virtual world we're living in right now.

1320
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:34,240
But I don't think I really, really, truly believe and I believe me.

1321
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:38,720
I understand the narrative of things are not going to go back to the way they were for

1322
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,320
a very long time.

1323
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:46,560
Like, I understand that things like sporting events, travel, you know, there are things

1324
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:52,480
where many, many Dragon Con where many, many people gather that there's still a big question

1325
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:54,560
mark that hangs over a lot of that.

1326
01:08:54,560 --> 01:09:00,160
But for the most part, like I, I feel like we'll be able to kind of like gather in like

1327
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:01,360
small groups.

1328
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:07,040
You'll still be able to like go to restaurant on a Saturday night in a few months as opposed

1329
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,520
to, you know, a year and a half.

1330
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,160
I don't think we go back to normal normal like life.

1331
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,720
Well, I don't think we ever go back to that 100%.

1332
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:19,760
I think, for example, seeing masks in public, whereas maybe in some countries that was a

1333
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:23,120
very common thing you would see when people are sick and we didn't really have that here.

1334
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,200
I think I think that'll be a permanent fixture.

1335
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,040
I think when people are sick, they're going to wear masks.

1336
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:30,320
You know, I think that's something you're going to see more and more common.

1337
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,720
But anyway, I don't want to digress too much.

1338
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:38,640
My point is, is that, you know, maybe my mindset is this because I think of festival as we

1339
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,920
gather for a week at South by Southwest and we talk about these types of things.

1340
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,200
We do these types of things.

1341
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:48,400
And I understand that, like, you know, maybe we can't have a festival in person anymore

1342
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,120
or what have you.

1343
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:59,360
But like four months of this online gathering, it's long and I don't think online culture

1344
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,240
like it is in the quarantine scenario.

1345
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,240
Exists in four months.

1346
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:12,080
I don't think we're living our lives on Zoom 100% in four months, maybe 20%, but not 100%

1347
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:12,800
like we are now.

1348
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:13,300
You know what I mean?

1349
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,680
Yeah, so.

1350
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:23,040
But anyway, yeah, so the four month thing is a little weird to me.

1351
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:27,440
I think that's just because maybe and maybe he has a series of exclusives that are going

1352
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,920
to take him up through the Game Awards or something like that.

1353
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:30,720
But it's just I don't know.

1354
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,560
It's very it's very interesting.

1355
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:39,600
But I could also see how maybe companies that were pushing to get things done for E3 week

1356
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:44,640
are not able to make that happen because they've had to deal with the very real situation of

1357
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:50,960
transitioning employees to working from home and not it doesn't necessarily end up in 100%

1358
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:51,520
productivity.

1359
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,640
In fact, it rarely does when it starts.

1360
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,840
You know, like you can have some people are hell, they're more productive at home.

1361
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,120
But like there's hurdles.

1362
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,320
There's just all sorts of technological hurdles people have to get through before you're

1363
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:06,800
able to, you know, kind of adjust to being at home all the time.

1364
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:13,520
And so maybe companies that were going to do this thing for E3 week have kind of had

1365
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,880
to push back their announces to all sorts of different times.

1366
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:21,120
So now it's like, hey, that thing we were going to E3 week, it's like four months out

1367
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,200
from when we were going to do it or another company like two months.

1368
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:27,040
I guess they're counting the Xbox thing as part of this.

1369
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,800
OK, I don't know.

1370
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:31,680
Interesting.

1371
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,200
But I don't know why.

1372
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:38,720
What makes this special designation important?

1373
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:40,080
That's what I'm missing.

1374
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:44,080
Because honestly, when you say, oh, we're going to trickle down big gaming news for

1375
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:48,800
four months, I'm just like, that's just normal.

1376
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,720
Yeah, that's just the summer in games.

1377
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:57,360
You know, OK, it's not all going to be in one week like it was in years past.

1378
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,080
We knew that.

1379
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:03,280
But like what's going to make Summerfest because the minute something is announced

1380
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:07,440
on this Summerfest site, you know, Kotaku is going to have it.

1381
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,960
Eurogamer is going to have it.

1382
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,160
Twitter is going to have it.

1383
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,120
Facebook is going to have it.

1384
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,600
Like the news will just be there.

1385
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,160
You know what I mean?

1386
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:19,040
So I don't know that that's and I'm not I'm not trying to dog on it.

1387
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,040
You know, Jeff Keighley is a smart dude.

1388
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,280
Like there's obviously a piece of this I'm missing.

1389
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:26,400
And maybe it's one of those things I just don't see until it happens.

1390
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,520
Four months of advertisers.

1391
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:30,320
I don't know.

1392
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:33,440
But yeah, I'm just I'm just kind of confused on a few things.

1393
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:36,400
I don't know.

1394
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:38,160
All right.

1395
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:41,600
I just am glad to see some some information whatsoever.

1396
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,240
Yeah.

1397
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,040
So all right.

1398
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,840
So let's move on to the next story that you had, Loki.

1399
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:46,720
Yes.

1400
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:50,880
Unfortunately, Jamie would have loved this as well, but I thought this was kind of interesting.

1401
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:56,160
So everybody's stuck at home and a lot of people are playing Animal Crossing.

1402
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:03,440
There was a social media post by the Queer Eye Twitter user that was saying, hey,

1403
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:09,040
if you go ahead and show a share your designs in your house,

1404
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:13,680
Bobby Burke is going to actually take a look at that stuff and give you tips about

1405
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,160
home decorating since he's the interior designer on the show.

1406
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,560
So I thought that was funny.

1407
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,720
So there is folks like showing off some of the different things that they're making.

1408
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,040
And he's giving comments about them.

1409
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:29,120
Pretty neat.

1410
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:30,480
Yeah.

1411
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:34,320
It's a very it's a nice little modern twist on things, isn't it?

1412
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,240
Yeah, it's funny.

1413
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:41,760
It's like it's what was the isn't it like the happy home designers or something like

1414
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,960
that or happy home, something or other that's in the game itself.

1415
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,760
And then it's like, you know, he's almost like a member of that now.

1416
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:52,880
I remember where they evaluate like your home and how it how it is.

1417
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:53,840
Yeah, you're right.

1418
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,280
The happy home designer thing.

1419
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:55,920
All right, cool.

1420
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,880
I remember the happy home designer was like a game.

1421
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,880
But like I remember it's happy home something.

1422
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,840
But yeah, it's been a while since I played Animal Crossing.

1423
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,000
Still haven't gotten to touch my switch version yet.

1424
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:09,360
What's the holdup?

1425
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,440
The kids are monopolizing the switch.

1426
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:16,560
And after that, it's like watching TV and stuff.

1427
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,400
So I just haven't got a chance to.

1428
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:20,260
All right.

1429
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:26,820
I'm waiting for is Jonathan Van Ness involved in this, though, or is it just Bobby, the

1430
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:28,100
the home guy that's doing this?

1431
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:30,340
I think it's just Bobby.

1432
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:36,260
Oh, see, I I like Jonathan the best because he calls everything fierce and gorgeous.

1433
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:38,420
And it's you look so gorgeous in that.

1434
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:44,340
So maybe he'll start to address some of the attire that you wear in the in the game,

1435
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:50,100
which, by the way, I don't know if you notice, but on stream, I'm wearing my meme shirt.

1436
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:54,820
I said on a previous episode that like that meme shirt that's an Animal Crossing.

1437
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:56,420
I fucking have that in a different color.

1438
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:56,980
Here it is.

1439
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:00,740
It's a little different because the cat has glasses.

1440
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:04,020
But like I that's why I laughed my ass off when I saw that shirt.

1441
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:05,700
I'm like, I fucking own that shirt.

1442
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:08,500
So that's why I always wear it in Animal Crossing.

1443
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:11,860
So it's funny.

1444
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:14,260
So all right, let's move on.

1445
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:17,460
And I'm going to talk a little bit about esports drama.

1446
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:19,780
This one involving Overwatch.

1447
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:25,300
So the Overwatch League, you know, it's still going moved over to YouTube.

1448
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:28,420
And that's why I kind of lost track of it because I was following it on Twitch.

1449
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:31,460
But it's on YouTube now and they're still going.

1450
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:36,420
Obviously not right this second, but they had a season and they named an MVP.

1451
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:41,540
The MVP was I hope I'm pronouncing this right, but it's Sinatra.

1452
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:44,100
Like like Frank Sinatra, but with an extra A.

1453
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:45,460
So Sinatra.

1454
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:46,500
Hopefully I'm pronouncing that right.

1455
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:46,980
Sorry, guys.

1456
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:49,220
You can tell how much I've been following Overwatch League lately.

1457
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:52,020
But I mean, this guy is so popular.

1458
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:56,660
Not only is he the MVP of the entire league, he was actually on late night with Jimmy Fallon,

1459
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:59,700
like talking about Overwatch League last October.

1460
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:02,660
You know, when people were still going on late night talk shows in person.

1461
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:04,580
So this guy's a pretty big deal.

1462
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:09,220
It was announced this week that he's going to be leaving the Overwatch League.

1463
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:14,420
And as if it couldn't get any worse, he's going to go.

1464
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:17,220
I mean, worse for, I guess, Blizzard or whatever, worse for the league.

1465
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:21,460
He's going to leave to go play Valorant instead.

1466
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:24,660
So maybe he's just getting bored with Overwatch.

1467
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:27,300
Well, he actually has commented a little bit on that.

1468
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:31,940
He basically said the game is just not for me anymore.

1469
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:36,820
I'm very happy with my life, but I just wasn't having fun with Overwatch anymore.

1470
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:38,660
So, Loki, that's it.

1471
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:40,020
You're not having fun playing the game.

1472
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:40,740
Don't play it.

1473
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:42,260
He's talked about he is.

1474
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:45,860
But what was interesting is that specifically he calls out

1475
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:48,580
the 2-2-2 role locking format.

1476
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:49,300
You know what that is?

1477
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:53,700
That's where they made it so that every match is 2 DPS, 2 heals, 2 tanks.

1478
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:58,180
He cites that as a problem and the hero bans.

1479
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:01,300
Yeah, I don't learn somebody to do that stuff.

1480
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:04,980
I mean, it seems like you would have more creativity with your teams unless,

1481
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:09,220
I guess, they're trying to get it so that not everybody hogs like a certain type of

1482
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:10,020
class or something.

1483
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:10,660
I don't know.

1484
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:10,900
Yeah.

1485
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:13,300
But that should be an option where you can turn that on or off.

1486
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:16,980
Frodo Swagons in chat says Valorant is so boring to watch.

1487
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:17,780
My God.

1488
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:20,980
Quest Buster says Valorant isn't even out of closed beta yet.

1489
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:24,420
So, kind of some ping ponging opinions there.

1490
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:27,540
But I think we can give Riot the benefit of the doubt.

1491
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:29,620
The game isn't out of beta yet.

1492
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:34,500
But still, this is a huge development for a game that isn't out of beta.

1493
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:37,460
I mean, talk about like throwing your weight behind something.

1494
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:44,500
Again, it's not just like this guy was not just like a mostly sidelined player on one

1495
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,460
of the teams like this.

1496
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:49,620
This guy was the fucking MVP and he's saying, yeah, I'm gonna go play this instead because

1497
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:52,420
the game I'm making money off of and getting notoriety for.

1498
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:53,380
It's just not fun anymore.

1499
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:59,220
Like, you have to wonder if Riot slipped a 20 in his pocket, a 20 million dollar bill

1500
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:01,220
or like what's going on there.

1501
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:03,220
It's kind of interesting.

1502
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:04,420
I mean, but I'm willing to give.

1503
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:06,260
I haven't played Valorant myself.

1504
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:08,660
Maybe it is really fucking fun.

1505
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:09,140
I don't know.

1506
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:10,100
I haven't played it yet.

1507
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:13,780
But I imagine it's one of those things, like most video games, we're all going to have

1508
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:15,780
an opinion on it and some are going to love it and some aren't.

1509
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:18,580
And this guy is just one of the lovers.

1510
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:21,300
Yeah.

1511
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:25,540
Quest Buster says he's not the only pro thinking of moving over to Valorant either.

1512
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:30,340
Overwatch League lost some talent earlier this year, too, such as a few popular announcers.

1513
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:36,020
So, it sounds like the Overwatch League might just be kind of, I don't know.

1514
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:37,860
There's a part of me that says it's, oh boy.

1515
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:39,300
Oh, girl, it's drama.

1516
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:40,420
Oh, they're in trouble.

1517
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:41,940
But then I'm also like, you know what?

1518
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:49,620
As esports is getting bigger, it's like we don't just have football anymore.

1519
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:53,060
It's like for years and years, we've only ever had football.

1520
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:54,660
Football is the only thing we see.

1521
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:55,780
Football is the only game we play.

1522
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:56,580
That's all we have.

1523
01:18:56,580 --> 01:19:00,020
But now it's like all of a sudden, oh, they got baseball.

1524
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:04,260
Oh, and basketball and hockey like all these other.

1525
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:07,060
And I think this is what's going to continue to happen with Overwatch League.

1526
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:10,340
And so suddenly, you know, Michael Jordan might be like, you know what?

1527
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:13,860
Instead of playing basketball, I'm going to go try this for a little while.

1528
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:15,860
Golf or whatever.

1529
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:16,580
You know what I mean?

1530
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:18,740
Like, I'm going to go try to be a pro in something else.

1531
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:23,060
And I think, you know, obviously you're going to see that a lot more probably in esports

1532
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:23,540
than you will.

1533
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:28,340
Obviously, I'm giving a very like, you know, it's not that common that you hear the pro sports

1534
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:30,740
people going from one sport to another, but it does happen.

1535
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:34,820
But I think you're going to see it happen here more as there's just as esports game

1536
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:37,220
popularity and there are more sports to choose from.

1537
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:38,500
Quest Buster.

1538
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:39,860
Oh, go ahead.

1539
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:43,060
No, I said, yeah, you're probably going to see more of that stuff.

1540
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:46,980
I mean, it's like after a while, like you got to move on to like other things, I would

1541
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:47,380
think.

1542
01:19:47,380 --> 01:19:53,140
And maybe maybe this person thinks that, you know, Overwatch has kind of lost its luster

1543
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:56,100
and now, you know, Valiant's where it's at.

1544
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:56,740
So I don't know.

1545
01:19:58,820 --> 01:19:59,140
Yeah.

1546
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:02,900
So reading some comments from chat, Quest Buster says, one of the arguments I've seen

1547
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:06,500
is that the core Phantom will always love Overwatch, but the broader numbers just aren't

1548
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,580
there to make it esports great.

1549
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:12,500
Could Overwatch be slow?

1550
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:12,820
I don't know.

1551
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:15,700
I feel like it's too early to doom and gloom, that type of stuff.

1552
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:19,140
But a lot will depend on the strength of Overwatch 2, I suppose.

1553
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:20,500
Yes.

1554
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,000
Yeah.

1555
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:22,280
All right.

1556
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:23,860
All right.

1557
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:30,020
Well, let's move on to our next story, which is did you want to do this?

1558
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:31,060
You want me to do this?

1559
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:31,540
China?

1560
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:32,020
Yes.

1561
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:32,340
Yes.

1562
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:34,820
Talk about China banning games.

1563
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:35,320
Yep.

1564
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:39,060
So China has banned a video game called Coronavirus Attack.

1565
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:42,580
It was a game that came out on Steam about a week or so ago.

1566
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:49,780
The game Coronavirus Attack is about a virus that can turn people in the selfish zombies

1567
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:51,380
as spread throughout your country.

1568
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:57,300
And your purpose is to prevent the selfish zombie virus carries from escaping and infecting

1569
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:58,260
other peoples.

1570
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:02,420
And to do that, you have to basically kill these people before they leave the country.

1571
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:08,180
So of course, I felt that that game was kind of offensive.

1572
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:15,380
And since also it was talking a little bit about where you win badges, like say, liberate

1573
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:20,900
Hong Kong and whatnot, obviously they had to ban that from China.

1574
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:22,840
Hmm.

1575
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:29,700
Well, I mean, the whole like killing people before they that's kind of in poor taste as

1576
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:30,200
it is.

1577
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:36,500
You know, we've been talking a lot about how there's going to be games as art that come

1578
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:43,700
out of this and not all art is, you know, some art provokes some art is offensive and

1579
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:44,500
it gets you thinking.

1580
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:49,940
And so this is just one of those examples, I think, is that it's art that is a little

1581
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:50,340
offensive.

1582
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:53,620
I don't know if it's necessarily like, you know, you're like shooting people or anything.

1583
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:57,860
You're actually playing a yellow coronavirus pathogen.

1584
01:21:58,660 --> 01:21:59,460
I'm not really sure what.

1585
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:05,300
Obviously, this is one of these games that people have made that is just trying to stir

1586
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:06,180
outrage, I think.

1587
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:08,020
Well, they got it.

1588
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:09,560
Yeah.

1589
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:11,700
So I don't know.

1590
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:14,900
Neat, I guess.

1591
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:16,820
All right.

1592
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:20,020
Everyone will immediately forget about this game in a week or so.

1593
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:20,520
Probably.

1594
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:21,780
All right.

1595
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:26,500
Then let's move on to the next story, which is a little bit of a follow up to something

1596
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:27,380
we've been talking about.

1597
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:27,880
Right.

1598
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:28,980
Right.

1599
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:34,100
So we were talking a little bit about these Valorant beta keys that they were doing these

1600
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:39,060
24 hour streams where if you watch them for a certain amount of time, you would get a

1601
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:40,980
drop for one of these beta keys.

1602
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:46,180
Well, Twitch announced that they are going to be stopping this practice.

1603
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:51,220
They said, basically, we've heard your concerns about creators continuously streaming VODs

1604
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:54,820
while tagging the channels live to farm Valorant drops.

1605
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:58,500
This harms the integrity of the drops program.

1606
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:03,060
So we've updated our community guidelines to clarify that cheating any Twitch reward

1607
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:04,740
system is prohibited.

1608
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:08,340
No cheating, because cheating is against the rules.

1609
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:14,100
So now they're basically not going to allow them to run these 24 hour streams.

1610
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:17,620
They're going to prevent this type of thing.

1611
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:24,180
So they said cheating a Twitch reward system such as drops or channel point systems is

1612
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:24,820
not allowed.

1613
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:33,540
And I'm not sure what exactly they're going to be doing to kind of combat that aside from

1614
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:36,340
just trying to prevent these 24 hour streams.

1615
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:45,860
I don't know, but I mean, yeah, if you don't drop these keys on the streams in the first

1616
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:46,420
place.

1617
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:50,020
Yeah, I feel like a conversation is going to happen there as well.

1618
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:55,780
But yeah, I mean, I guess maybe I'm a little pleasantly surprised Twitch took action in

1619
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:56,420
that regard.

1620
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:57,940
I didn't really expect them to.

1621
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:02,420
But now that they did, I'm kind of like, oh, okay, yeah, I guess that is the thing that

1622
01:24:02,420 --> 01:24:04,260
should have happened and good on Twitch for doing it.

1623
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:04,500
Right?

1624
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:06,420
Like, you know, they saw that there was a problem there.

1625
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:07,780
People are exploiting it.

1626
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:10,420
And so they've kind of, you know, cut that off.

1627
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:13,860
And maybe that will make some of the people that are, you know, maybe like Riot and so

1628
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:14,020
forth.

1629
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:15,700
Maybe they didn't expect that this would happen.

1630
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:19,140
You know, sometimes you can't foresee how internet people are going to take to certain

1631
01:24:19,140 --> 01:24:19,640
things.

1632
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:27,540
So they, you know, did this and that'll be something for future key drop giveaway things

1633
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:28,900
to consider, you know?

1634
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:29,940
Yeah.

1635
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:34,420
And well, at least it's nice to see that they're doing something.

1636
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:36,100
So I don't know.

1637
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:36,600
Yep.

1638
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:37,720
All right.

1639
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:42,260
Well, moving on to talking about Oculus sales.

1640
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:47,540
So Oculus sales, they've actually been improving a little bit, which is notable to talk about

1641
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:51,780
because, you know, we wonder, like, you know, is VR going to take over?

1642
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:53,700
VR going to be the next big thing?

1643
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:55,700
PlayStation VR has been doing pretty well.

1644
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:59,060
And now we have, you know, improving numbers for Oculus.

1645
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:02,020
And there's several reasons why this is happening.

1646
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:05,300
It's not just like, oh, finally, you know, there's reasons for it.

1647
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:08,580
And one of the big ones, of course, is the Oculus Quest.

1648
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:11,060
The Oculus Quest just came out in last May.

1649
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:16,180
And this has been pointed out as the biggest contributor to Facebook's other because,

1650
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:17,620
remember, Facebook owns Oculus.

1651
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:22,260
So the other revenue category has been very bolstered by the Oculus Quest.

1652
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:29,380
In fact, the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, you may know, actually kind of said something

1653
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:34,580
akin to wish we could have made more of them faster because these things were selling so well.

1654
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:37,060
Oh, I actually have the quote from the investor call.

1655
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:38,580
I wish we could have made more of them.

1656
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:38,980
I'm sorry.

1657
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:41,700
I wish we could make more of them faster during this period.

1658
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:47,780
It's possible that the COVID corona situation accelerates some of the trends around virtual

1659
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:51,620
or augmented reality, but I'm not sure what will happen in the long term.

1660
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:55,780
And that's something important to consider as well is that you may have people that are

1661
01:25:55,780 --> 01:26:03,860
looking to VR as not just necessarily a new thing to do while at home or a thing to keep us home.

1662
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:07,780
But think about how this is also something kind of I get you could probably do a whole

1663
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:09,940
other show on this and I know they're out there.

1664
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:19,620
Is that how could VR now in this pandemic world we're in kind of shine by how it can

1665
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:24,580
bring us together by being in these fake worlds?

1666
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:30,100
I guess I don't know how else to put it, but like or even like I can now travel these places

1667
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:33,620
that I would have liked to have gone in person, but maybe I can't right now.

1668
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:36,100
But VR can kind of take me there.

1669
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:40,100
Or I would think if you're Facebook, it's a pay-per-view, a pay-per-view,

1670
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:44,420
a kin event that I can attend in VR even though I can't be there in person.

1671
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:47,860
Well, they have like, was it the Google Earth VR stuff that you can go like,

1672
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:49,940
look at Street View stuff in VR, I think.

1673
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:54,820
Phoenix 7726 says, so ready player one?

1674
01:26:55,700 --> 01:27:00,820
I'm not sure I'd go that far, but think especially because VR technology isn't quite that.

1675
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:03,300
But what about the fact that, you know what,

1676
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:06,900
sporting events and concerts we keep talking about,

1677
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:09,300
those are going to be the last things to come back, right?

1678
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:14,020
Like those are those are, you know, those don't come back until we have

1679
01:27:15,140 --> 01:27:20,500
treatment is one thing or a cure or a vaccine.

1680
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:24,020
You know, we're getting some hopeful things on the treatment front.

1681
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:26,260
But we don't, you know, we got to let the scientists do their work.

1682
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:27,300
These things take time.

1683
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:31,220
So, you know, we can wish on a star all we want, but we don't have anything where, you know,

1684
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:37,140
the government has felt strong enough to say, yes, we can treat this now and it won't be as fatal.

1685
01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:38,820
Go forth and go back to normal.

1686
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:42,580
You know, yes, now it is like the flu because we can treat it.

1687
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:44,100
They can't do that yet.

1688
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:48,340
So my point is, the concert industry, the live entertainers,

1689
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:54,660
it's going to be challenging to figure out how do they make money in these types of times.

1690
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:59,540
But what if they could do a concert in VR and sell tickets?

1691
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:04,980
And I've always kind of thought this was going to be why Facebook because

1692
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:07,060
remember when Facebook bought Oculus?

1693
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:10,020
Everybody was like, why the fuck is Facebook buying Oculus?

1694
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:12,580
Why didn't Microsoft buy a gaming company?

1695
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:14,100
VR is for gaming.

1696
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:16,900
And it's like, oh, wait, maybe not.

1697
01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:19,540
Maybe it's not just for gaming, actually.

1698
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:21,460
They haven't really done much with it, though.

1699
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:22,500
So I don't know.

1700
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:23,700
They haven't yet.

1701
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:31,700
But like, this is again, not that I advocate for this pandemic is a great time to be capitalist.

1702
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:36,660
But I think the reality is there's going to be a lot of people that do try to seize the

1703
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:41,460
opportunity, you know, and Facebook would honestly be stupid not to.

1704
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:45,700
And I've said this since the beginning when they bought Oculus.

1705
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:50,420
Look at the things that Facebook has been doing, like live streaming and 3D photos.

1706
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:55,540
They keep inching closer and closer to streaming VR events.

1707
01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:58,020
That will fucking happen.

1708
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:01,300
It do you think Loki is streaming VR events?

1709
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:03,220
Is that going to happen at some point?

1710
01:29:03,220 --> 01:29:04,900
Is the technology going to be there for that?

1711
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:06,660
Eventually, it will.

1712
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:09,060
He went away.

1713
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:10,420
So I'm going to answer for him.

1714
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:11,860
Oh, wait, I think it's because my Skype.

1715
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:13,140
Sorry, my Skype is blowing up.

1716
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:15,460
And so it causes I'm sorry, Loki, were you talking?

1717
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:16,740
I am still here.

1718
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:17,540
Do you hear me?

1719
01:29:17,540 --> 01:29:18,260
Yeah, sorry.

1720
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:19,540
I have the Skype.

1721
01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:21,780
God, Skype's going on.

1722
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:24,820
And so you were probably talking to listeners and I couldn't hear you.

1723
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:27,540
So the question I was asking was an answer for my benefit.

1724
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:28,040
Sorry.

1725
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:32,740
Will VR be streaming live events anytime soon?

1726
01:29:33,940 --> 01:29:38,260
I don't know about soon, but it eventually depends on what we're looking at soon.

1727
01:29:38,260 --> 01:29:39,860
I mean, maybe in the next 10 years.

1728
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:43,380
I kind of think it'll be a lot sooner than that.

1729
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:45,940
I think the technology exists to be able to do it.

1730
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:49,060
I just don't think it exists on a wide scale, but I think they're going to go that way.

1731
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:53,860
So anyway, my point is, is that I see Facebook streaming these types of events in VR

1732
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:56,260
that we're not able to attend in person right now.

1733
01:29:56,260 --> 01:29:59,380
And I think there will be people that will be into it and buy into it.

1734
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:03,220
It's probably not going to make as much money as live tours do.

1735
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:07,300
But if Taylor Swift wants to do a concert on Facebook in VR,

1736
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:09,220
I bet there will be people that would pay money for that.

1737
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:10,500
Okay, thank you.

1738
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:12,580
Bobby says the Olympics streamed in VR.

1739
01:30:12,580 --> 01:30:15,300
I was like, surely something has happened with this already.

1740
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:18,100
And I was like, I know you can download videos in VR.

1741
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:21,220
There's plenty of stuff on PlayStation VR, like videos.

1742
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:24,260
I remember there was an Utada Hikaru concert you could watch and things like that.

1743
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:26,180
But the streaming, I wasn't sure.

1744
01:30:26,180 --> 01:30:28,260
Okay, so the streaming is there.

1745
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:33,060
So Bonds006 says Facebook can own that market.

1746
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:35,940
They have the sub, just offer it to the masses.

1747
01:30:35,940 --> 01:30:37,540
$4.99 a VR show.

1748
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:38,100
Exactly.

1749
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:39,380
I think that's where this goes.

1750
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:44,420
SSG100Matt says the NBA has been working with showing live games in VR for a while.

1751
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:47,460
The biggest obstacle is that the customer base isn't there yet.

1752
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:50,020
Well, now it's starting to grow a little bit.

1753
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:53,060
And maybe this is going to be the time when it grows a little more.

1754
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:56,900
I do need to point out VRChat is popular Zoom, that's all.

1755
01:30:57,860 --> 01:31:02,100
I do need to point out Half-Life Alex has also released in this time frame.

1756
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:04,340
And I think we'd be idiots to not call out.

1757
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:06,740
You know, that probably had somewhat of an impact.

1758
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:08,180
Maybe not a huge one.

1759
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:14,020
But I know at least one person that finally jumped ship into AR to play Half-Life Alex.

1760
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:15,060
I'm sorry, VR.

1761
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:18,820
I was going to say, yeah, there was an article I saw.

1762
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:20,260
ARAlexR, sorry.

1763
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:22,260
Regarding the VR stuff.

1764
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:30,260
And even with Alex coming out, it's only about 1.9% of Steam users actually own VR headsets.

1765
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:34,740
That's still higher than I would have thought, to be honest.

1766
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:36,500
So, all right.

1767
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:38,020
Well, anyway, we'll see what develops.

1768
01:31:38,020 --> 01:31:42,020
But I think it's interesting to note that Oculus has been growing.

1769
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:43,300
So, I'm going to...

1770
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:45,300
I think if he's ready, I'm going to actually call over to the show.

1771
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:47,780
So, you guys know we've had to change a little bit on the fly tonight.

1772
01:31:47,780 --> 01:31:50,260
Because DarkSakura had a family emergency and she had to go.

1773
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:56,100
So, if you've seen me frantically texting on the stream, I was actually texting Alan

1774
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:58,820
to see if he'd be willing to cover the classic game tonight.

1775
01:31:58,820 --> 01:32:01,300
And thank gosh, he was.

1776
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:03,140
So, I'm just going to do a little microphone change here.

1777
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:03,780
So, I'm going to give...

1778
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:04,260
Hi, Alan.

1779
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:04,660
How are you?

1780
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:05,460
Here's the yellow mic.

1781
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:06,900
And I'm going to take the noisy mic.

1782
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:07,620
So, sorry, guys.

1783
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:08,660
It's going to make a little noise.

1784
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:09,540
But I have to.

1785
01:32:09,540 --> 01:32:13,700
The Venmo payment hasn't come through yet for this.

1786
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:14,660
No, it hasn't.

1787
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:15,780
And hopefully this one works.

1788
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:16,020
Yes.

1789
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:16,340
Okay.

1790
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:17,620
So, hi, how are you?

1791
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:18,100
I'm very...

1792
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:19,460
My time is very expensive.

1793
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:23,380
Well, I appreciate you gracing us with your presence.

1794
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:25,300
Is this a Twitch appropriate thing you're wearing?

1795
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:25,860
Cover up.

1796
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:26,180
Jesus.

1797
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:27,060
All right.

1798
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:28,420
It's nice outside.

1799
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:29,860
It's hotter in here than it is outside.

1800
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:32,820
How's gaming been for you?

1801
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:34,180
We didn't talk about this on the show.

1802
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:36,100
You bought something this week.

1803
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:36,580
Oh, yes.

1804
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:39,060
I got a Switch Lite.

1805
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:43,860
It's on its way to Best Buy.

1806
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:48,260
I pick it up on Saturday because I got the coral color.

1807
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:48,980
I'm not pink.

1808
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:50,100
Coral.

1809
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:53,940
So yeah, that and Animal Crossing.

1810
01:32:54,580 --> 01:32:57,460
And why did you finally jump ship on getting this?

1811
01:32:57,460 --> 01:32:58,660
Because you wanted your own...

1812
01:32:58,660 --> 01:33:00,900
I was like, you can build an Animal Crossing house on my island.

1813
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:01,140
No.

1814
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:04,660
Just the fact that you have...

1815
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:07,540
I don't like playing in the living room.

1816
01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:09,940
I don't like playing on a big TV.

1817
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:13,380
I like things that are intimate, where it's either in my lap or right in front of me at

1818
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:14,580
a computer desk.

1819
01:33:14,580 --> 01:33:16,820
So yeah.

1820
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:18,020
And then I can...

1821
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:23,140
If I was doing something and you wanted it, you're like, someone's coming over to give

1822
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:23,540
me something.

1823
01:33:23,540 --> 01:33:23,940
Get off.

1824
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:29,780
It's just like if you have kids that fight too much, you just got to get them their own

1825
01:33:29,780 --> 01:33:31,460
stuff, even if it spoils them.

1826
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:32,180
I understand.

1827
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:36,420
So well, and it's interesting is we were talking about this on prior shows is that the Switches

1828
01:33:36,420 --> 01:33:39,620
have been kind of hard to come by, but I guess not because you got...

1829
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:42,180
Well, you weren't able to just buy one today.

1830
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:44,020
You had to wait a little bit, but you were able to get one.

1831
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:50,260
I saw over your shoulder, Alan got a Switch without having to deal with scalpers.

1832
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:57,060
Yes, because this past week, and you may be SOL, a lot of the major retailers got...

1833
01:33:57,780 --> 01:34:03,060
I have no idea how big the shipment is or when the next one is going to be in relation

1834
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:03,460
to...

1835
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:07,140
Because Nintendo stopped production with all the COVID-19 stuff going on.

1836
01:34:07,140 --> 01:34:15,060
But Costco, Best Buy, and Amazon got a pretty significant bunch of different colors of the

1837
01:34:15,060 --> 01:34:15,540
lights.

1838
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:23,700
I don't know about the main Switch, but I originally placed my order on Amazon because

1839
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:29,380
they were sold out of Coral, saw that Best Buy had Coral, canceled the Amazon order,

1840
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:30,340
switched to Best Buy.

1841
01:34:31,220 --> 01:34:36,100
And by the way, if you were to check, Best Buy, I think, is already sold out.

1842
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:37,300
There might be some on Amazon.

1843
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:40,580
If you see Amazon 199, that's Amazon.

1844
01:34:41,140 --> 01:34:43,220
They're the only people selling it for MSRP.

1845
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:46,180
So yeah, I was able...

1846
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:49,380
There were so many Switches in stock, I was able to cancel the order in one place and

1847
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:52,900
confidently place it with another retailer, which two weeks ago you couldn't do.

1848
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:59,220
So without getting too much of a tangent, I'm on this app called Slick Deals, which

1849
01:34:59,220 --> 01:35:06,100
I use to track if there's something that I want, whether it's workout clothes or...

1850
01:35:07,940 --> 01:35:08,420
I don't know.

1851
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:10,340
I'm into fitness stuff.

1852
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:12,180
So protein bar stuff that's expensive.

1853
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:15,220
But if I want to know if there's a really great deal on it, you can put stuff on there

1854
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:18,340
and your phone will alert you when it's in stock.

1855
01:35:18,340 --> 01:35:20,340
Can you all tell Alan's been working out?

1856
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:21,860
I'm very skinny.

1857
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:22,580
Thank you.

1858
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:26,500
I haven't been working out, but Alan has.

1859
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:34,580
I put a Switch notification in Slick Deals and it basically popped up and said,

1860
01:35:34,580 --> 01:35:40,660
this isn't technically a deal because it is MSRP, but Costco, Best Buy, Amazon have them

1861
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:42,740
this week for MSRP.

1862
01:35:42,740 --> 01:35:44,980
And some people downloaded it because it's not a sale.

1863
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:48,900
Deal is a discount, but that was my way in.

1864
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:55,220
So today says, oh, Alan is one of those people that has an app and steals all the stuff people

1865
01:35:55,220 --> 01:35:56,900
want before they see it's in stock.

1866
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:58,500
Okay, but to be fair, he's not scalping.

1867
01:35:58,500 --> 01:35:59,940
He bought it for himself.

1868
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:00,340
Yes.

1869
01:36:00,340 --> 01:36:06,900
And a lot of the people who vote down those tips when something is in stock that's hard

1870
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:09,220
to find are the resellers.

1871
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:13,460
So the fact that this thing on Slick Deals had like minus 50 downvoted, those are the

1872
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:18,660
scalpers downvoting it because they want to buy out Amazon at $1.99 and then flip it on

1873
01:36:18,660 --> 01:36:19,460
eBay for $300.

1874
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:22,260
I just want one and I don't want to pay $400 for it.

1875
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:26,340
And Fifth Dream today says, I know.

1876
01:36:26,340 --> 01:36:28,180
And by the way, SJ100 Matt can actually hear.

1877
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:33,300
So Smoosh is all the way in the hallway and they can hear that Smoosh is pissed because

1878
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:37,780
how dare we both be here and not by his side right now.

1879
01:36:37,780 --> 01:36:38,660
I don't have mine.

1880
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:39,940
I don't have the squirt bottle.

1881
01:36:39,940 --> 01:36:41,380
It's fine.

1882
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:41,880
Yeah.

1883
01:36:42,580 --> 01:36:43,860
So anyway, I'm getting a Switch.

1884
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:45,140
I'm getting a Coral one.

1885
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:48,100
I've already got the SD card with a little micro thing.

1886
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:50,260
I have it set aside.

1887
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:58,820
So yeah, I'll be posting my Switch code probably on Twitter Saturday evening and then I'll

1888
01:36:58,820 --> 01:37:02,900
probably hop on OLR on Sunday and read it there.

1889
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:07,300
All I'm going to have is Animal Crossing because Switch games are $60 a pop and I'm probably

1890
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:07,940
not going to go.

1891
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:09,940
Well, you have all my games that I have on.

1892
01:37:09,940 --> 01:37:10,580
Well, true.

1893
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:14,660
And if I knew this was going to happen, I would have done what Bobby Blackwolf did and

1894
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:17,460
bought the physical one so we could like share the cartridge.

1895
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:18,980
But here we go.

1896
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:19,540
LOL.

1897
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:20,740
Bobby's sitting there laughing.

1898
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:22,020
Ha ha ha.

1899
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:23,540
I'm smarter than Rob is.

1900
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:25,540
This is pretty spontaneous.

1901
01:37:25,540 --> 01:37:28,180
I never guessed that he would finally join the Switch bandwagon.

1902
01:37:28,180 --> 01:37:28,660
This is like...

1903
01:37:28,660 --> 01:37:33,540
And I didn't think Animal Crossing would be the game to break you either, so to speak.

1904
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:35,620
I think it's the circumstances that we're in.

1905
01:37:35,620 --> 01:37:37,780
We live in strange times.

1906
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:39,300
We do live in strange times.

1907
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:42,580
But why couldn't we like...

1908
01:37:42,580 --> 01:37:43,620
What do you mean swap games?

1909
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:44,020
How?

1910
01:37:44,020 --> 01:37:46,740
Like the light isn't digital only.

1911
01:37:47,860 --> 01:37:50,100
No, no, it's not digital only.

1912
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:50,260
Yeah.

1913
01:37:50,260 --> 01:37:52,180
Then all these cartridges I have in the other room.

1914
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:53,140
Yeah, so we can still do that.

1915
01:37:53,140 --> 01:37:54,340
Yeah, you can take any of those games.

1916
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:54,740
Yeah.

1917
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:59,060
But like Animal Crossing or Mario Maker 2 or the things I bought digitally, I don't

1918
01:37:59,060 --> 01:37:59,780
have those.

1919
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:00,740
But there's plenty.

1920
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:02,180
You want to play Diablo 3 or something like that?

1921
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:02,900
Yeah, well, okay.

1922
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:04,340
I get your point there.

1923
01:38:04,340 --> 01:38:05,700
But like, yeah, I mean, if I want...

1924
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:07,220
The only other game that I want...

1925
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:13,220
Bobby says, to be fair, my wife bought Animal Crossing digitally because she was playing

1926
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:16,020
it too much, I'd only get about 30 minutes a day.

1927
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:17,300
Yeah.

1928
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:18,260
Okay, there it is.

1929
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:18,500
Yeah.

1930
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:20,660
So Bobby is actually not laughing.

1931
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:22,100
He's nodding in agreement.

1932
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:22,420
Yes.

1933
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:23,060
I understand.

1934
01:38:23,780 --> 01:38:28,420
I'm gonna take over your Breath of the Wild because I played that for like a dozen hours

1935
01:38:28,420 --> 01:38:29,540
and I hope...

1936
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:30,260
Longer than that.

1937
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:32,020
But I haven't played it in a while.

1938
01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:32,520
Yeah.

1939
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:38,180
The only other one where I'd want to get, regardless of whether or not you have a copy

1940
01:38:38,180 --> 01:38:39,700
of it, would probably be Mario Kart.

1941
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:40,200
I have it.

1942
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:45,060
But like if we wanted to play together, like on our respective switches.

1943
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:45,940
Then that's a little harder.

1944
01:38:45,940 --> 01:38:46,180
Yeah.

1945
01:38:46,180 --> 01:38:46,680
Yeah.

1946
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:48,020
Smash Brothers.

1947
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:53,860
I love Smash Brothers for GameCube, but because I'm on the light and I don't like the controller

1948
01:38:53,860 --> 01:38:56,740
thing, whatever, I'm not worried about Smash Brothers.

1949
01:38:57,700 --> 01:38:58,200
All right.

1950
01:38:58,740 --> 01:39:00,740
What else am I wanting to ask you about?

1951
01:39:01,780 --> 01:39:04,100
First off, a lot of the folks on Twitch...

1952
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:05,540
Sorry to the podcast who can't see.

1953
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:08,900
And also, if Matt or Loki is saying anything, I can't hear him.

1954
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:09,940
So hi, Matt.

1955
01:39:09,940 --> 01:39:10,900
No, he's quiet right now.

1956
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:12,100
I'm not being quiet.

1957
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:12,420
All right.

1958
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:15,060
Yeah, Loki's being quiet, but he says hi back.

1959
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:17,160
All right.

1960
01:39:18,740 --> 01:39:21,700
Now, a lot of the Twitch people are commenting on...

1961
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:23,940
They're saying, where did Alan get his haircut?

1962
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:25,860
Or how did Alan get a haircut?

1963
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:28,580
And just to be clear, Alan did not go out.

1964
01:39:28,580 --> 01:39:30,420
Alan's been very good at the shelter in place.

1965
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:31,380
He just shaved his head.

1966
01:39:32,180 --> 01:39:35,220
It's the quarantine desperation.

1967
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:36,900
I can't take this anymore.

1968
01:39:37,940 --> 01:39:38,440
Target.

1969
01:39:39,380 --> 01:39:40,340
DIY.

1970
01:39:40,340 --> 01:39:41,060
You just...

1971
01:39:41,060 --> 01:39:41,540
That's right.

1972
01:39:41,540 --> 01:39:43,140
Loki's saying it verbally.

1973
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:44,740
You just do this with the guard.

1974
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:47,620
And the guard keeps you from making any severe mistakes.

1975
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:51,620
And then you get your spouse or roommate or significant other.

1976
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:53,380
And you say, get the back.

1977
01:39:53,380 --> 01:39:54,420
I can't get the back.

1978
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:55,540
It's fucked up in the back.

1979
01:39:56,260 --> 01:39:58,180
And then Rob comes out and he's like, fine.

1980
01:39:58,180 --> 01:39:59,540
And then he goes, nah.

1981
01:39:59,540 --> 01:40:00,040
So yeah.

1982
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:04,820
But see, you're lucky, though, that you still have everything in the middle.

1983
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:08,340
So the problem for me is that I don't have all this in the middle.

1984
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:09,700
You're going to have to cave at some point.

1985
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:12,580
Or you're going to have the full fur rim, like Friar Tuck.

1986
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:14,420
See, I don't want that.

1987
01:40:14,420 --> 01:40:17,540
So I'm just like, luckily, I really love hats.

1988
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:18,100
Yeah.

1989
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:19,300
Or I just have to go down.

1990
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:22,100
Like I have to do like the extra thing and just go like completely.

1991
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:23,860
But I'm like, my head is shaped funny.

1992
01:40:23,860 --> 01:40:24,660
I don't like it.

1993
01:40:24,660 --> 01:40:27,780
But like, you know, like the back, the back is starting to grow out.

1994
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:28,660
It's like, oh, God.

1995
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:29,780
Yeah.

1996
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:30,500
So I don't know.

1997
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:33,300
When you finally crack, just let me know.

1998
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:36,420
And we'll go outside in the lawn so the hair can go wherever.

1999
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:40,260
And I will happily, the hair that you have, I will happily buzz.

2000
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:42,740
But yeah, no, it's just it's quarantine desperation.

2001
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:43,700
It is.

2002
01:40:43,700 --> 01:40:44,200
It is.

2003
01:40:44,660 --> 01:40:44,980
All right.

2004
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,700
So the reason why you're here, of course, Dark Soccer,

2005
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:50,820
I had to step away for a family emergency, which which fucking sucks.

2006
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:54,660
But I really appreciate you, you know, because I'm like, OK, how do we do this?

2007
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:57,300
I could just have Loki pick something on the fly or I could be something on the fly.

2008
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:59,060
Oh, Alan's got about 15 minutes.

2009
01:40:59,060 --> 01:41:00,180
Maybe he can pick something.

2010
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:02,660
So I said, could you pick a classic game of the week?

2011
01:41:02,660 --> 01:41:06,820
So because we've done this on the fly, we had to switch out what we were going to do.

2012
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:09,140
Jamie was going to do a pinball table tonight.

2013
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:11,220
I'm sure you all can understand she's not going to do that.

2014
01:41:11,220 --> 01:41:13,220
We're going to roll that over to a later week,

2015
01:41:13,220 --> 01:41:16,660
whether that be next week, two weeks from now, whenever she she comes back.

2016
01:41:17,620 --> 01:41:20,260
But I said, Alan, hey, could you pick something on the fly?

2017
01:41:20,260 --> 01:41:21,060
So he did.

2018
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:22,740
I don't have footage of it tonight.

2019
01:41:22,740 --> 01:41:24,340
I'm sure you all understand why.

2020
01:41:24,340 --> 01:41:25,860
So we're just going to do this on the fly.

2021
01:41:25,860 --> 01:41:27,940
But Alan is going to pick the classic game tonight.

2022
01:41:27,940 --> 01:41:29,620
So, Alan, what do you want to talk about?

2023
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:31,060
What game do you want to pick tonight?

2024
01:41:31,060 --> 01:41:35,380
I want to talk about let me get my and I have played this game multiple times and beat it

2025
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:36,980
multiple times, but it was a long time ago.

2026
01:41:36,980 --> 01:41:38,580
So I need to get my sure.

2027
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:39,060
Go for it.

2028
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:40,900
My nodes, a.k.a. Wikipedia.

2029
01:41:43,220 --> 01:41:44,900
Meanwhile, I'll read comments from chat.

2030
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:48,900
Miss DOLR says, Alan, why do you think one of the first things I'm doing when the salons

2031
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:50,820
actually reopen is getting my hair cut?

2032
01:41:50,820 --> 01:41:51,780
With precautions.

2033
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:57,060
But I don't even have the other house person help me make my back even option now.

2034
01:41:57,060 --> 01:41:58,580
Yeah, but let me tell you what.

2035
01:41:58,580 --> 01:42:04,420
Those haircut places are going to be swamped when it's safe to do so.

2036
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:06,180
So just make an appointment.

2037
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:10,420
I'm not too proud to admit this, but for about two years now, I have been getting my

2038
01:42:11,620 --> 01:42:17,380
when you're a man of a certain age, like in your late 30s, early 40s, the hair on your

2039
01:42:17,380 --> 01:42:21,060
nose, in your nose, your ears and your eyebrows, we're just going to do whatever the fuck we

2040
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:21,460
want.

2041
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:22,420
You can figure it out.

2042
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:24,500
So I would get wax.

2043
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:27,140
I would get my eyebrows and ears and nose waxed.

2044
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:30,340
And you can't tell right now, but there's a lot of chaos here.

2045
01:42:30,340 --> 01:42:34,580
This the fact that I have two eyebrows, that's my doing with the razor blade.

2046
01:42:34,580 --> 01:42:37,220
So I miss the wax salon.

2047
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:37,860
I want to get...

2048
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:39,860
You want your Brazilian?

2049
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:42,980
Yes, my face Brazilian, whatever.

2050
01:42:42,980 --> 01:42:45,140
Just yoink.

2051
01:42:45,140 --> 01:42:45,860
Absolutely.

2052
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:54,420
And this is like, I got like some Abe Vigoda type, you know, the guy with the eyebrows

2053
01:42:54,420 --> 01:42:55,460
that's going on in my ears.

2054
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:56,020
It's not cute.

2055
01:42:56,020 --> 01:42:56,580
Oh my God, you died.

2056
01:42:56,580 --> 01:42:57,220
Have some class.

2057
01:42:57,220 --> 01:42:57,720
Oh God.

2058
01:42:58,740 --> 01:42:59,460
I'm just kidding.

2059
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:03,060
Once you turn 35, it truly is downhill.

2060
01:43:04,020 --> 01:43:04,820
That's not true.

2061
01:43:04,820 --> 01:43:07,380
I've loved my 30s and my 40s are okay.

2062
01:43:07,940 --> 01:43:12,180
I mean, this COVID shit ain't helping, but until that happened, it was all right.

2063
01:43:12,180 --> 01:43:12,660
All right.

2064
01:43:12,660 --> 01:43:13,860
Classic game of the week.

2065
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:14,420
What is it?

2066
01:43:14,420 --> 01:43:20,020
Okay, so this game, I want to see if the chat room can guess.

2067
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:21,940
It's for the PS2.

2068
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:31,940
It came out in America in October of 2001.

2069
01:43:31,940 --> 01:43:35,540
Came out in August in Japan, same year, 2001, PS2 title.

2070
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:44,580
It was directed by Hideki Kamiya, who was the director of Resident Evil 2.

2071
01:43:45,140 --> 01:43:53,780
And it was a genre breaking, genre inventing edgelord, beat him up, mega gothic extravaganza.

2072
01:43:53,780 --> 01:43:55,060
And that is Devil May Cry.

2073
01:43:56,660 --> 01:43:58,100
Props to Orange Riot hit it first.

2074
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:06,180
Devil May Cry, cause I got a PS2 on launch, which I think came out March of 2000.

2075
01:44:06,180 --> 01:44:11,540
So by the time Devil May Cry came out, PS2 was out for about 15 months.

2076
01:44:11,540 --> 01:44:17,380
And for me personally, DMC, which not referring to the DMC remake that came out like six years

2077
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:27,140
ago that everyone hated, but as an abbreviation, the first Devil May Cry for me was PS2's killer app.

2078
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:30,900
Like this is why I have this console.

2079
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:32,340
This is new, this is fun.

2080
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:34,100
I've never seen anything like this before.

2081
01:44:34,660 --> 01:44:35,540
Shit's wild.

2082
01:44:35,540 --> 01:44:38,820
I want to bring friends over to show them this.

2083
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:44,660
That was that game for me, because I had like tech and tag tournament and SSX snowboarding

2084
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:46,580
and some of the other launch titles.

2085
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:48,100
A few things had trickled in.

2086
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:52,900
PS2, of course, the 3D compared to the original PlayStation was quite incredible, but Devil

2087
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:59,060
May Cry was it for me, where I was like, I've now justified the price of the, I don't

2088
01:44:59,060 --> 01:45:00,740
know, $400 that thing cost.

2089
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:07,380
It is a 3D action hack and slash.

2090
01:45:08,580 --> 01:45:10,260
It counted up your combos.

2091
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:14,820
There were very ridiculous moves where you're flipping, you're juggling enemies in the air.

2092
01:45:14,820 --> 01:45:17,620
You're flipping weapons in the middle of combos.

2093
01:45:17,620 --> 01:45:18,660
You're shooting lasers.

2094
01:45:18,660 --> 01:45:19,940
You have a demon form.

2095
01:45:19,940 --> 01:45:29,860
It is very self-aware, edgelord, hot topic, like, my name's Dementia Raven, Gerald Darkway,

2096
01:45:29,860 --> 01:45:32,420
Black Parade way, like, goth.

2097
01:45:32,420 --> 01:45:40,100
And in the intro, Dante is at his private detective's office, and a blonde chick drives

2098
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:46,340
a motorcycle through his door and lands the motorcycle on him, and it's very cuckoo bananas.

2099
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:50,180
Devil May Cry is the precursor to Bayonetta.

2100
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:54,820
If you've played Bayonetta, then you know what Devil May Cry is like, because that's

2101
01:45:54,820 --> 01:45:59,860
sort of the, Dante is Bayonetta's father, in no sense.

2102
01:45:59,860 --> 01:46:00,740
Not daddy, though.

2103
01:46:00,740 --> 01:46:01,940
That's between the two of them.

2104
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:02,500
I don't know what they do.

2105
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:03,220
That's their business.

2106
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:09,700
Hideki Kamiya, like I said, he was the director of Resident Evil 2.

2107
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:14,180
He then went on to Platinum Games, where he also did, of course, Bayonetta and Bayonetta

2108
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:14,740
2.

2109
01:46:14,740 --> 01:46:16,660
Wonderful 101, I think, was his.

2110
01:46:17,300 --> 01:46:20,660
He wrote the story for Viewtiful Joe 1 and 2.

2111
01:46:21,860 --> 01:46:23,060
He blocked me on Twitter.

2112
01:46:23,860 --> 01:46:24,740
What did you say to him?

2113
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:26,420
No, but he's blocked a lot of people.

2114
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:26,900
Okay, yeah.

2115
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:34,340
Yeah, I think he is a preemptive, he's a good internet troll, but he's an internet troll

2116
01:46:34,340 --> 01:46:39,620
that kind of has not the thickest skin, so he is good at riling up his fans and irritating

2117
01:46:39,620 --> 01:46:42,660
the shit out of them, but then if you kind of say something snotty back, I think he will

2118
01:46:42,660 --> 01:46:44,340
block you, which isn't the best mix.

2119
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:58,580
So, the style with the tight, challenging gameplay was what made Devil May Cry such

2120
01:46:58,580 --> 01:46:59,220
a success.

2121
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:06,580
It had a very, it was easy to learn, impossible, quote unquote, to master.

2122
01:47:06,580 --> 01:47:10,100
It had a very sharp learning curve if you wanted to, or a very steep learning curve

2123
01:47:10,100 --> 01:47:15,060
if you wanted to get an S or SS class on all the missions, all the levels, you had

2124
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:16,180
to play them over and over again.

2125
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:21,940
There was easy, normal, hard, nightmare mode, are you stupid mode, all that stuff.

2126
01:47:21,940 --> 01:47:27,780
If you were a masochist before Dark Souls, you beat Devil May Cry and you put on Nightmare

2127
01:47:27,780 --> 01:47:29,300
and then you had yourself a great old time.

2128
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:31,380
Definitely was replayable.

2129
01:47:32,020 --> 01:47:36,420
Once you got good at it in normal mode, you could probably play it again from start to

2130
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:38,980
finish and realize, oh, you shaved two hours off your time.

2131
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:45,300
So, yeah, action, arcade, very violent, demons and monsters.

2132
01:47:46,580 --> 01:47:49,860
I had very little time to put this together, but you get the idea.

2133
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:50,820
You're doing great, sweetie.

2134
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:55,620
Go on YouTube, look up Devil May Cry 2001 if you've never played it.

2135
01:47:57,300 --> 01:48:00,500
Also, really good soundtrack, don't really know who did the music, though.

2136
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:05,380
But you can get it now pretty much anything relevant current day.

2137
01:48:05,380 --> 01:48:09,460
You can get it on PS4 or Xbox One as a digital download.

2138
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:11,380
It's on the Switch because everything's on the Switch now.

2139
01:48:11,380 --> 01:48:12,660
Came out June 2019.

2140
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:14,340
You can get it on PC.

2141
01:48:17,220 --> 01:48:20,420
Devil May Cry had a sequel, Devil May Cry 2.

2142
01:48:20,420 --> 01:48:25,860
They did not ask Hideki Kamiya if he wanted to be a part of it.

2143
01:48:25,860 --> 01:48:28,260
They just greenlit it and put people on it that weren't him.

2144
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:31,540
And he still, at the time when they interviewed him about it, he's like, I don't know why

2145
01:48:31,540 --> 01:48:32,580
they made the sequel without me.

2146
01:48:33,220 --> 01:48:34,660
Capcom just did their own thing.

2147
01:48:34,660 --> 01:48:39,140
Devil May Cry 2 is considered the worst of the series.

2148
01:48:39,940 --> 01:48:44,020
DMC3, which is about him, Dante, and his brother, Virgil.

2149
01:48:44,020 --> 01:48:49,860
The game is very, very loosely based off of Milton's Paradise Lost.

2150
01:48:50,420 --> 01:48:54,580
I think there was that one Edgelord game for the PS3 that came out that was also based

2151
01:48:54,580 --> 01:48:54,900
on that.

2152
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:57,620
So yeah, Trish, Virgil, Dante.

2153
01:48:58,260 --> 01:49:04,660
DMC3 was a prequel, which was very successful and very fun to play.

2154
01:49:04,660 --> 01:49:11,540
Then there was DMC4 and DMC5 after the series was put on hiatus because I'm not sure what

2155
01:49:11,540 --> 01:49:13,540
year it was, 2012, 2013.

2156
01:49:13,540 --> 01:49:18,580
They sort of remade Dante as this very Twinkie type.

2157
01:49:18,580 --> 01:49:23,540
It was too Hot Topic, Edgelord, Grim Dark, Raven, Dementia Way.

2158
01:49:23,540 --> 01:49:24,660
It was too much.

2159
01:49:25,460 --> 01:49:30,740
You know, Kamiya knew how to keep it at like a 7 and they went a full 10 and it did not

2160
01:49:30,740 --> 01:49:30,980
work.

2161
01:49:31,700 --> 01:49:38,180
So because that game kind of flopped, they were like, oh, Capcom didn't really know what

2162
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:39,300
they wanted to do with it.

2163
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:44,500
Finally, they greenlit and made Devil May Cry 5, which came out last year.

2164
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:47,940
And my understanding is that was successful and that was a lot of fun to play.

2165
01:49:47,940 --> 01:49:48,420
I have it.

2166
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:50,580
I haven't played past the tutorial stage.

2167
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:51,140
And why not?

2168
01:49:51,860 --> 01:49:54,980
Girl, how many games do we have on Steam that we haven't played?

2169
01:49:56,100 --> 01:49:57,700
Are you going to ask me that question?

2170
01:49:57,700 --> 01:49:58,820
Drag me, expose me.

2171
01:50:00,820 --> 01:50:07,380
So yeah, you can get DMC1, 2, and 3 on Steam.

2172
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:08,260
It's a trilogy.

2173
01:50:09,140 --> 01:50:14,420
For some reason, DMC3 standalone 4 and 5 are on sale right now on Steam, but the original

2174
01:50:14,420 --> 01:50:16,660
1, 2, and 3 trilogy is like a package.

2175
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:17,540
It's full retail.

2176
01:50:17,540 --> 01:50:18,900
I think it's 39 or 49.

2177
01:50:18,980 --> 01:50:22,580
Maybe put that on your Steam wish list and wait for one of the bigger sales to come up.

2178
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:25,940
But if you want to play it, you have half a dozen ways to do so, is what I'm trying

2179
01:50:25,940 --> 01:50:26,740
to say.

2180
01:50:26,740 --> 01:50:29,460
So yeah, that's the classic game of the week.

2181
01:50:30,340 --> 01:50:34,260
Came out in 2001, which is 19 years ago.

2182
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:37,700
Thank you for the reminder that we're all getting older.

2183
01:50:37,700 --> 01:50:38,660
Appreciate that.

2184
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:39,380
Disgusting.

2185
01:50:39,940 --> 01:50:40,500
All right.

2186
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:41,220
All right.

2187
01:50:41,220 --> 01:50:42,340
Well, Alan, you did great.

2188
01:50:42,900 --> 01:50:45,620
You guys have to know again, I gave him like 10 minutes notice.

2189
01:50:45,620 --> 01:50:47,220
Hi, can you jump in and do this segment?

2190
01:50:47,220 --> 01:50:47,860
And he did it.

2191
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:51,780
I checked the Wiki and I was like, all right, there's got to be, because there's always

2192
01:50:51,780 --> 01:50:54,260
the game that's like, how have we not done this before?

2193
01:50:54,260 --> 01:50:55,300
Devil May Cry was it?

2194
01:50:55,860 --> 01:50:56,420
All right.

2195
01:50:56,420 --> 01:50:56,820
Yeah.

2196
01:50:56,820 --> 01:50:58,260
That's why I put a ring on it.

2197
01:50:58,260 --> 01:50:58,820
Yep.

2198
01:50:58,820 --> 01:50:59,140
All right.

2199
01:50:59,140 --> 01:50:59,780
Thanks, Alan.

2200
01:51:00,340 --> 01:51:00,740
Bye.

2201
01:51:00,740 --> 01:51:00,980
All right.

2202
01:51:00,980 --> 01:51:01,380
Take care.

2203
01:51:01,940 --> 01:51:02,740
All right.

2204
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:05,940
And I'm going to switch back to my less noisy mic, you guys.

2205
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:10,340
Thank you for dealing with some of our life changes.

2206
01:51:10,340 --> 01:51:16,820
Again, Dark Sakura had to step away early due to an emergency and hoping everything's

2207
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:19,140
okay in our soccer Ville.

2208
01:51:19,140 --> 01:51:19,780
Okay.

2209
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:23,300
Moving on, though, we still have some news to cover and some things to get to before

2210
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:25,140
we wrap up tonight's show.

2211
01:51:25,140 --> 01:51:26,900
So we got some rapid fire news.

2212
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:28,180
We're going to try to get into here.

2213
01:51:28,180 --> 01:51:29,460
So, Loki, do you want to start?

2214
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:30,340
Yeah.

2215
01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:35,460
Let's talk about what's coming out for free games with your online subscriptions for Xbox

2216
01:51:35,460 --> 01:51:37,860
slide game with golden PlayStation network.

2217
01:51:37,860 --> 01:51:41,780
So starting with games of gold, you have the rally four, which is going to be made first

2218
01:51:41,780 --> 01:51:47,780
through the three verse and then Warhammer 40,000 Inquisitor Martyr that's going to be

2219
01:51:47,780 --> 01:51:51,060
coming out May 16th through June 15th.

2220
01:51:51,060 --> 01:51:56,420
And then the Xbox 360 compatible games Sensible World of Soccer for the first half of May

2221
01:51:56,420 --> 01:51:58,420
and Overlord two for the second half of May.

2222
01:51:58,980 --> 01:52:01,620
That is a game I have not played in a long time.

2223
01:52:01,620 --> 01:52:02,260
Overlord.

2224
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:09,700
Then let's see, although it's weird, though, because in their screenshot, they show Overlord,

2225
01:52:09,700 --> 01:52:11,300
not Overlord two.

2226
01:52:11,300 --> 01:52:14,340
So I wonder if that's not accurate or not.

2227
01:52:14,340 --> 01:52:15,060
Let's see here.

2228
01:52:16,260 --> 01:52:23,700
But anyways, we've got for the PlayStation side of the house, the city skylines and farming

2229
01:52:23,700 --> 01:52:26,900
simulator 19 are going to be the two games you get.

2230
01:52:27,460 --> 01:52:28,420
Those are some choices.

2231
01:52:28,420 --> 01:52:29,460
Well, city skylines.

2232
01:52:29,460 --> 01:52:34,020
I mean, I keep forgetting like that's a console game, you know, like that to me, like that

2233
01:52:34,020 --> 01:52:35,860
is like a SimCity type of successor.

2234
01:52:35,860 --> 01:52:40,660
Like that's the game that showed up when the SimCity reboot like stunk.

2235
01:52:40,660 --> 01:52:43,780
So I keep associating that as PC.

2236
01:52:43,780 --> 01:52:48,020
I never think of that as a PS4 game, but I guess, you know, maybe this release is going

2237
01:52:48,020 --> 01:52:49,620
to change some of those notions.

2238
01:52:49,620 --> 01:52:50,580
Farming Simulator.

2239
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:53,620
I'm not trying to dog on that game, but I feel like that's shown up as the free game

2240
01:52:53,620 --> 01:52:54,820
multiple places right now.

2241
01:52:54,820 --> 01:52:58,660
So it's kind of like because that was that was a Stadia Pro game not that long ago.

2242
01:52:58,660 --> 01:52:59,940
So I mean, yeah.

2243
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:04,180
And it's you know, I don't know a lot of people that are going to get that excited about farming

2244
01:53:04,180 --> 01:53:06,340
simulator, but it's different.

2245
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:12,020
It could be a fun game to stream if you haven't, you know, you don't know what you're doing.

2246
01:53:12,020 --> 01:53:12,580
It's true.

2247
01:53:12,580 --> 01:53:13,060
I don't know.

2248
01:53:13,060 --> 01:53:13,620
It's true.

2249
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:14,260
Hey, you know what?

2250
01:53:14,260 --> 01:53:18,100
Those like those truck driving simulator things with the Eurotruck simulator, whatever.

2251
01:53:18,100 --> 01:53:19,220
Those games are fucking fun.

2252
01:53:20,180 --> 01:53:21,460
So you know what?

2253
01:53:22,900 --> 01:53:24,100
Anyway, I shouldn't talk shit.

2254
01:53:24,100 --> 01:53:25,140
Yeah, do some farming.

2255
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:27,780
If you're ready to do some farming.

2256
01:53:27,780 --> 01:53:28,280
Sure.

2257
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:29,400
All right.

2258
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:31,460
And this is kind of cool.

2259
01:53:31,460 --> 01:53:35,220
So we have always been talking about a lot of different things you can make with Dreams

2260
01:53:35,220 --> 01:53:36,420
and all these cool creations.

2261
01:53:36,420 --> 01:53:41,140
So somebody took the whole concept of Lego Super Mario.

2262
01:53:41,140 --> 01:53:44,820
You know, the actual sets are coming out here within a matter of months.

2263
01:53:45,860 --> 01:53:52,180
They took that and they've made a Lego Super Mario game in Dreams using the character model

2264
01:53:52,180 --> 01:53:54,020
and everything completely from scratch.

2265
01:53:54,740 --> 01:53:59,140
Pretty amazing, though, the little gameplay that they did it and it was 60 plus hours

2266
01:53:59,140 --> 01:54:01,540
so far being put into the game to make that.

2267
01:54:01,620 --> 01:54:06,340
And they even had like a behind the scenes video showing how they modeled everything

2268
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:08,100
and just an amazing job.

2269
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:09,300
No copyright takedown yet?

2270
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:14,100
Not yet, because wasn't that a thing just like two weeks ago we had like Mario games

2271
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:15,300
getting taken down in Dreams?

2272
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:17,220
Like, how does this not happen here?

2273
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:19,220
Mario and Lego this time.

2274
01:54:19,220 --> 01:54:22,020
Oh, but you're fringing on two IPs.

2275
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:22,660
Great job.

2276
01:54:23,540 --> 01:54:24,580
Multiple IPs.

2277
01:54:24,580 --> 01:54:26,260
Multiple, why not?

2278
01:54:26,260 --> 01:54:27,700
You're going to fridge on IPs.

2279
01:54:27,700 --> 01:54:28,660
Let's do multiples.

2280
01:54:29,620 --> 01:54:34,500
Um, but yeah, that's like, that's like when what's his name posts the video with all the

2281
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:37,220
copyright stuff so that they all infringe on each other.

2282
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:39,780
They all file infringement stuffs on each other.

2283
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:42,340
You know what I'm talking about?

2284
01:54:42,340 --> 01:54:44,020
Yeah, copyright deadlock or whatever it is.

2285
01:54:44,900 --> 01:54:45,400
Yeah.

2286
01:54:46,100 --> 01:54:46,580
All right.

2287
01:54:46,580 --> 01:54:51,300
So if you want to check it out, just look for Lego Super Mario, the video game.

2288
01:54:51,300 --> 01:54:55,460
And it's by the game designer, barely regal.

2289
01:54:55,700 --> 01:55:02,580
So which classy, which by the way, um, there is a free demo of Dreams.

2290
01:55:02,580 --> 01:55:03,140
It just came out.

2291
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:06,420
I was reading about, I haven't grabbed it myself yet, but I don't know if it's something

2292
01:55:06,420 --> 01:55:10,340
where you can like, just play the creations or if it's timed or what the restrictions

2293
01:55:10,340 --> 01:55:11,620
on the demo are.

2294
01:55:11,620 --> 01:55:15,220
But, um, if you're curious about this game, which Dreams is one of those things where

2295
01:55:15,220 --> 01:55:17,300
I'm always like, Oh yeah, I need to get on that.

2296
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:18,340
I need to get on that.

2297
01:55:18,340 --> 01:55:18,740
You know what?

2298
01:55:18,740 --> 01:55:19,860
I really need to get on that.

2299
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:22,500
And then it's like, you know, but animal crossing.

2300
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:26,980
And so I never like get to it, but maybe a demo would be a nice little shove in the

2301
01:55:26,980 --> 01:55:27,700
right direction.

2302
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:28,020
Right.

2303
01:55:28,020 --> 01:55:29,220
So you have a chance.

2304
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:30,260
So, all right.

2305
01:55:31,220 --> 01:55:36,500
Moving on, let's talk about some changes coming up to Final Fantasy 14 and its next

2306
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:37,220
patch.

2307
01:55:37,220 --> 01:55:41,060
You may not be aware, but some of the things that people don't like about Final Fantasy

2308
01:55:41,060 --> 01:55:46,660
14 is that the story from the original expansion, a realm reborn, the first 50 levels of the

2309
01:55:46,660 --> 01:55:47,700
game you have to play.

2310
01:55:47,700 --> 01:55:50,500
Some people feel it is too fucking long.

2311
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:54,500
And, um, yeah, yeah, it's, it's, it's a little long.

2312
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:56,660
So this is an interesting thing they're doing in the patch.

2313
01:55:56,660 --> 01:56:02,020
They are cutting out some of the con you never, you never think about celebrating the removal

2314
01:56:02,020 --> 01:56:06,580
of content as good news, but in the case of Final Fantasy 14, people are relatively happy

2315
01:56:06,580 --> 01:56:10,900
that, uh, they're going to be scaling back the content in a realm reborn.

2316
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:12,580
I believe they're saying about 13%.

2317
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:18,340
So some of the, uh, stuff you have to get through to get to the expansions, it's going

2318
01:56:18,340 --> 01:56:20,180
to be rebalanced, changed.

2319
01:56:20,180 --> 01:56:25,620
Uh, you won't have to worry about consistently hitting this block where you can't progress

2320
01:56:25,620 --> 01:56:27,380
with the story because they're going to balance it.

2321
01:56:27,380 --> 01:56:30,900
So the story gives you enough experience to just keep going through the story.

2322
01:56:30,900 --> 01:56:32,180
So that's pretty cool.

2323
01:56:32,180 --> 01:56:37,060
And they're adding new stuff as well, including the next section of the Nier Automata inspired

2324
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:38,980
raid called the Puppets Bunker.

2325
01:56:39,540 --> 01:56:44,740
And I'm looking forward to playing that because I, I was very late to the party on Nier and

2326
01:56:44,740 --> 01:56:45,540
it's really cool.

2327
01:56:45,540 --> 01:56:47,700
And I like the look and especially the music.

2328
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:48,900
I love the music in that game.

2329
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:52,900
So, uh, very looking forward to what the music is going to be like in that, uh, particular

2330
01:56:52,900 --> 01:56:53,140
raid.

2331
01:56:53,140 --> 01:56:54,260
That'll be really cool.

2332
01:56:54,260 --> 01:56:58,660
And they're also going to continue the storyline around the Ruby weapon, uh, which was something

2333
01:56:58,660 --> 01:57:00,100
you fought already.

2334
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:03,780
And they're going to be increasing the difficulty of, uh, past raids.

2335
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:08,100
So some of the old level 50 raids will be coming back, uh, and getting a lot harder.

2336
01:57:08,980 --> 01:57:13,300
Uh, Ziba is asking over in our chat room, Rob, what server do you play on?

2337
01:57:13,300 --> 01:57:14,260
Cactuar.

2338
01:57:14,260 --> 01:57:15,540
I've been bouncing around.

2339
01:57:15,540 --> 01:57:17,220
I started on Midgar Summer.

2340
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:20,100
I was on, um, Hyperion during the last expansion.

2341
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:21,620
Now I'm on Cactuar.

2342
01:57:21,620 --> 01:57:25,060
And, um, I finally changed my character.

2343
01:57:25,060 --> 01:57:26,740
I'm no longer Lil Poundcake.

2344
01:57:26,740 --> 01:57:28,180
That was my old character.

2345
01:57:28,180 --> 01:57:29,300
I've changed.

2346
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:31,300
I should, should I say my new character?

2347
01:57:31,940 --> 01:57:34,100
Am I going to get trolled if I give away my new character?

2348
01:57:34,100 --> 01:57:35,380
Do you want to know my new character name?

2349
01:57:35,380 --> 01:57:36,740
Loki, do you want to know my new character?

2350
01:57:36,740 --> 01:57:37,300
You might like it.

2351
01:57:38,180 --> 01:57:38,420
Sure.

2352
01:57:38,420 --> 01:57:39,060
What is it?

2353
01:57:39,060 --> 01:57:41,860
My new character's name is Jeremy Bearimy.

2354
01:57:44,820 --> 01:57:45,780
So there you go.

2355
01:57:45,780 --> 01:57:46,100
All right.

2356
01:57:46,980 --> 01:57:51,620
Uh, moving on, uh, also talking about Apex Legends.

2357
01:57:52,820 --> 01:57:57,540
Apex Legends is introducing a new hero, a thief named Loba.

2358
01:57:57,540 --> 01:58:01,380
And if you've been following the game, you may have seen Loba before.

2359
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:05,780
She has a connection to Revenant, uh, that joined the game in season four.

2360
01:58:06,820 --> 01:58:10,420
In this new update for Apex Legends, there's going to be a new,

2361
01:58:10,420 --> 01:58:14,100
a hundred new items for people to unlock, including legendary skins,

2362
01:58:14,100 --> 01:58:18,260
Apex packs, uh, a new quest mechanic apparently is going to be in the game.

2363
01:58:18,260 --> 01:58:19,060
That's pretty cool.

2364
01:58:19,060 --> 01:58:21,140
I haven't checked out Apex since it first launched.

2365
01:58:21,140 --> 01:58:23,220
I didn't read, really need to get back into it.

2366
01:58:23,220 --> 01:58:26,100
Um, because I think there there's like duos mode in that now.

2367
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:27,620
And they've added some other fun stuff to that.

2368
01:58:27,620 --> 01:58:28,660
So, okay.

2369
01:58:28,660 --> 01:58:30,420
Hey, anybody out there play Apex?

2370
01:58:30,420 --> 01:58:33,220
Like, do they, did they ever put in like a solo type mode?

2371
01:58:33,860 --> 01:58:37,060
Like where, or something where you can play against AI to get better

2372
01:58:37,060 --> 01:58:40,100
at the game before you just go back to the game?

2373
01:58:40,100 --> 01:58:40,260
Yeah.

2374
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:42,580
When they had the Titanfall into the game.

2375
01:58:42,580 --> 01:58:42,740
Yeah.

2376
01:58:42,740 --> 01:58:43,540
I'd be looking for that too.

2377
01:58:43,540 --> 01:58:44,260
That'd be pretty cool.

2378
01:58:44,900 --> 01:58:45,540
All right.

2379
01:58:45,540 --> 01:58:49,940
Um, let me try to tackle the headlines Jamie had, and then you can fill in any gaps.

2380
01:58:49,940 --> 01:58:50,180
Okay.

2381
01:58:50,180 --> 01:58:50,900
Loki.

2382
01:58:50,900 --> 01:58:54,980
Um, so number one, uh, Evo 2020 got canceled.

2383
01:58:54,980 --> 01:58:57,460
Uh, so they're not going to be doing Evo 2020.

2384
01:58:57,460 --> 01:58:58,900
Does that really surprise anyone?

2385
01:58:58,900 --> 01:58:59,460
Not really.

2386
01:58:59,460 --> 01:59:01,540
Sadly, uh, everything is getting canceled.

2387
01:59:01,540 --> 01:59:04,340
Um, but they're going to be doing an online event in its place.

2388
01:59:04,340 --> 01:59:07,140
Um, I know, uh, this was brought up on Bobby's show.

2389
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:11,380
He had a caller tonight that was talking on his show a little bit about it and how it's

2390
01:59:11,380 --> 01:59:16,260
going to be interesting to see how it plays out because like disconnects happen and the

2391
01:59:16,260 --> 01:59:19,140
internet isn't always the greatest on some of these games.

2392
01:59:19,140 --> 01:59:20,740
There's lag and yeah.

2393
01:59:20,740 --> 01:59:25,220
So, um, I don't know if it's going to be the best solution, but right now there isn't a

2394
01:59:25,220 --> 01:59:26,500
lot of other solutions.

2395
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:29,460
So yeah, it's what they might have to do.

2396
01:59:29,460 --> 01:59:34,500
So, uh, we'll see, uh, what, how Evo goes, but I'm sure they want to get back to Vegas

2397
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:35,620
as soon as possible.

2398
01:59:36,180 --> 01:59:38,980
Uh, and then the other big story, and this is actually a big, big deal.

2399
01:59:38,980 --> 01:59:40,900
We just don't have a lot, a lot of information.

2400
01:59:40,980 --> 01:59:43,380
Um, Assassin's Creed Valhalla was announced.

2401
01:59:43,380 --> 01:59:46,980
It's going to be like a Vikings, a Norse mythology kind of themed Assassin's Creed

2402
01:59:46,980 --> 01:59:47,380
game, right?

2403
01:59:47,380 --> 01:59:51,380
It's, uh, going to make a God of War game where they just aren't making the God of War

2404
01:59:51,380 --> 01:59:55,620
game, but yeah, they did the, um, whole cinematic trailer this week.

2405
01:59:55,620 --> 02:00:00,180
And then part of the Xbox thing that they're doing next week, they're going to show gameplay.

2406
02:00:00,900 --> 02:00:02,020
Oh, okay.

2407
02:00:02,020 --> 02:00:02,900
Oh, that might be one.

2408
02:00:02,900 --> 02:00:03,140
Okay.

2409
02:00:03,140 --> 02:00:06,900
So that's one of the games that, uh, Microsoft's going to show them at that event.

2410
02:00:06,900 --> 02:00:07,700
Good to know.

2411
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:13,380
Um, so yeah, but, uh, I I'm curious if it'll have like a rich history mode, like Odyssey

2412
02:00:13,380 --> 02:00:16,900
had, you know how, like they, they really tried to make Assassin's Creed more than just

2413
02:00:16,900 --> 02:00:18,260
like the single player campaign.

2414
02:00:18,260 --> 02:00:19,460
I think it could be very interesting.

2415
02:00:20,420 --> 02:00:23,220
So we'll see more details to come.

2416
02:00:23,220 --> 02:00:25,060
We just know the basic, basic stuff right now.

2417
02:00:25,620 --> 02:00:26,020
All right.

2418
02:00:26,020 --> 02:00:28,980
Let's travel around the world and check out release dates.

2419
02:00:28,980 --> 02:00:32,980
Uh, Loki, we'll start with the U S I don't even know if we have any games coming out,

2420
02:00:32,980 --> 02:00:37,460
but, um, well, we, we have a few things, so not a whole lot.

2421
02:00:38,420 --> 02:00:46,900
We've got John Wick hacks on PlayStation four and void bastards on Nintendo switch and PlayStation

2422
02:00:46,900 --> 02:00:47,400
four.

2423
02:00:48,580 --> 02:00:49,140
And that's it.

2424
02:00:50,340 --> 02:00:50,580
Yeah.

2425
02:00:50,580 --> 02:00:52,260
A little bit of a slower week right now.

2426
02:00:52,260 --> 02:00:54,980
Um, especially when most of the game stores are closed.

2427
02:00:54,980 --> 02:00:57,860
Well, I guess in some, some States are starting to open that type of stuff back up.

2428
02:00:57,860 --> 02:00:58,180
Huh?

2429
02:00:58,180 --> 02:01:02,180
So I keep, you know, my, my perspective is very California and we're probably going to

2430
02:01:02,180 --> 02:01:03,780
be the last state to reopen.

2431
02:01:03,860 --> 02:01:04,340
And I'm okay.

2432
02:01:07,460 --> 02:01:07,620
Hmm.

2433
02:01:07,620 --> 02:01:08,260
All right.

2434
02:01:08,260 --> 02:01:09,780
Well, anyhow, moving on to Japan.

2435
02:01:09,780 --> 02:01:13,540
Honestly, when I look at Japanese releases, I don't see anything on the Nintendo switch

2436
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:16,260
and that's probably just, you know, again, do the situation.

2437
02:01:16,260 --> 02:01:18,580
And this is empty on PlayStation four as well.

2438
02:01:18,580 --> 02:01:22,980
You know, I'm looking at an importer website, so I don't know if, um, the imports are just

2439
02:01:22,980 --> 02:01:25,380
slowing down because of what's going on, which should be understandable.

2440
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:29,220
But according to my list, as it currently stands, we don't have any releases in Japan

2441
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:29,780
right now.

2442
02:01:29,780 --> 02:01:32,180
And that just could be because of the world situation.

2443
02:01:32,180 --> 02:01:33,460
Um, so that's all I got.

2444
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:34,180
How about the UK?

2445
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:36,980
Nothing in the UK either.

2446
02:01:36,980 --> 02:01:37,940
All right.

2447
02:01:37,940 --> 02:01:41,620
It's going to be going to be a slow month until we get to the other end of this stuff.

2448
02:01:41,620 --> 02:01:41,940
All right.

2449
02:01:41,940 --> 02:01:45,540
Uh, this would be the part of the show where we would usually read emails, which actually

2450
02:01:45,540 --> 02:01:49,940
I'm going to check again, cause I checked before the show and we didn't have any emails.

2451
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:52,900
Um, but somebody actually asked for the address at the top of the show.

2452
02:01:52,900 --> 02:01:55,540
So I'm wondering if they didn't write in during the show.

2453
02:01:55,540 --> 02:02:00,260
And since we don't have Jamie with us tonight, we're going to have a little less content.

2454
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:03,060
Uh, Loki, can you buy me time while I put, pull up the emails?

2455
02:02:03,220 --> 02:02:06,420
Cause I wasn't originally planning to, but I think somebody emailed.

2456
02:02:07,620 --> 02:02:08,180
Yes.

2457
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:15,220
So as you may know, um, we, I think we may have even been last week, uh, Rick may, who,

2458
02:02:15,220 --> 02:02:21,540
uh, voice the soldier in team fortress two passed away, um, a few weeks ago, actually

2459
02:02:21,540 --> 02:02:22,420
on April 13th.

2460
02:02:22,980 --> 02:02:30,740
And, um, because of this to memorialize or tribute Rick may, um, now in team fortress

2461
02:02:30,740 --> 02:02:35,140
two valve has updated Memorial statues featuring a soldier as a tribute.

2462
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:41,780
Um, so those are going to be in game, I guess, at least through the month of may in honor

2463
02:02:41,780 --> 02:02:43,620
of the passing of the voice actor.

2464
02:02:44,740 --> 02:02:45,940
That's a very nice gesture.

2465
02:02:46,580 --> 02:02:46,900
All right.

2466
02:02:46,900 --> 02:02:47,460
We do this.

2467
02:02:47,460 --> 02:02:48,820
Well, actually we do have a lot of emails.

2468
02:02:48,820 --> 02:02:51,380
I'm glad I went back and looked because before the show, we didn't have anything.

2469
02:02:51,380 --> 02:02:54,020
Now we have like three, so we've got a lot of emails to get through.

2470
02:02:54,020 --> 02:02:55,780
Let's get to it and you can email us as well.

2471
02:02:55,780 --> 02:02:58,100
Participate at orange laundry.com.

2472
02:02:58,100 --> 02:02:59,380
We love getting emails.

2473
02:02:59,380 --> 02:03:00,020
Here we go.

2474
02:03:00,020 --> 02:03:01,940
First email from Frodo swagons.

2475
02:03:01,940 --> 02:03:05,700
Hey all, there are a couple of games coming up that look pretty interesting to me.

2476
02:03:05,700 --> 02:03:09,060
Was wondering if you've heard of them and or what you think of them.

2477
02:03:09,060 --> 02:03:11,540
Minecraft dungeons is the first one.

2478
02:03:11,540 --> 02:03:13,700
Uh, I'm going to just jump in and answer this right now.

2479
02:03:13,700 --> 02:03:17,380
I already have that downloaded via Xbox game pass to my Xbox one.

2480
02:03:17,380 --> 02:03:21,620
I'm, I'm pretty hyped for my craft dungeon because it speaks to two of my interests.

2481
02:03:21,620 --> 02:03:24,500
I'm, I'm kind of a casual on Minecraft.

2482
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:28,260
I don't, but I think it's cool, but I love Diablo.

2483
02:03:28,260 --> 02:03:32,500
And so I'm all about like a new, like triple a dungeon explore.

2484
02:03:32,500 --> 02:03:35,060
I've been trying to fill the gap with some of the other,

2485
02:03:35,060 --> 02:03:38,020
like there's plenty of roguelikes and dungeon explorers out there.

2486
02:03:38,020 --> 02:03:43,220
Things like dead cells, wizard of legend, and all those games are great, but I'm,

2487
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:46,980
I'm looking to see what a big name like Minecraft kind of brings to the table.

2488
02:03:46,980 --> 02:03:50,580
So yes, um, usually when we get the emails, I'm always kind of like, no,

2489
02:03:50,580 --> 02:03:51,860
I haven't heard a lot about, no, this one.

2490
02:03:51,860 --> 02:03:52,580
Yes, I have.

2491
02:03:52,580 --> 02:03:53,620
Uh, Loki, what about you?

2492
02:03:54,660 --> 02:03:55,780
I'm interested in it.

2493
02:03:55,780 --> 02:03:57,460
I haven't purchased it at all.

2494
02:03:57,460 --> 02:03:59,220
Do you know if there's a cross play on that at all?

2495
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:00,980
Good question.

2496
02:04:00,980 --> 02:04:02,420
I'm not sure off the top of my head.

2497
02:04:02,420 --> 02:04:03,860
I think I don't see why not.

2498
02:04:05,060 --> 02:04:06,580
It's got to have PC and Xbox.

2499
02:04:06,580 --> 02:04:08,740
It's a Microsoft game essentially at the end of the day.

2500
02:04:09,540 --> 02:04:11,940
Oh, um, yeah, I'll probably pick it up on PC.

2501
02:04:11,940 --> 02:04:15,060
Uh, and I know Frodo, you didn't ask, but our chat room is popping in too.

2502
02:04:15,060 --> 02:04:16,580
And every gamer gets a voice here.

2503
02:04:16,580 --> 02:04:19,220
So SGA 100 Matt says Minecraft dungeons looks great.

2504
02:04:19,220 --> 02:04:20,660
Diablo with Minecraft.

2505
02:04:20,660 --> 02:04:20,980
Yeah.

2506
02:04:20,980 --> 02:04:23,060
I thought, I thought it looked cool too.

2507
02:04:23,060 --> 02:04:26,420
Um, Loki, I know you and your family play Minecraft sometimes.

2508
02:04:26,420 --> 02:04:28,340
So I thought maybe dungeons might interest you.

2509
02:04:28,340 --> 02:04:29,300
So there you go.

2510
02:04:29,300 --> 02:04:33,060
The other game we played this week, I did play Minecraft a little bit.

2511
02:04:33,060 --> 02:04:33,560
Oh, did you?

2512
02:04:34,260 --> 02:04:34,900
That's right.

2513
02:04:34,900 --> 02:04:36,420
You have a server up now, don't you?

2514
02:04:36,420 --> 02:04:37,300
Or is that not public?

2515
02:04:37,300 --> 02:04:39,140
Yeah, it's realms.

2516
02:04:39,140 --> 02:04:42,900
So it's like, uh, it's like a server, but smaller scale.

2517
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:46,500
It's up to 10 or 15 people.

2518
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:49,700
I can't remember what the, I think it's 10 that you pay.

2519
02:04:49,700 --> 02:04:52,820
And it's like, like eight bucks a month or something like that.

2520
02:04:52,820 --> 02:04:57,540
And it's officially sanctioned like through the actual, uh, Minecraft stuff.

2521
02:04:57,540 --> 02:05:00,180
But yeah, we only do it because it's up to you of us.

2522
02:05:00,180 --> 02:05:00,500
Okay.

2523
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:02,420
Is it just your family or like?

2524
02:05:02,420 --> 02:05:04,100
Yeah, just myself and the kids.

2525
02:05:04,100 --> 02:05:04,340
Okay.

2526
02:05:04,340 --> 02:05:05,460
Cause I was gonna say, I'll come crash.

2527
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:06,900
If it's a family thing, I won't come crash.

2528
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:07,860
No, you can come crash.

2529
02:05:08,420 --> 02:05:08,900
Yeah.

2530
02:05:08,900 --> 02:05:09,700
I don't know what I do.

2531
02:05:09,700 --> 02:05:13,220
I dig, I dig a big hole in the ground and live, live in it.

2532
02:05:13,220 --> 02:05:14,180
Like I play Minecraft.

2533
02:05:14,180 --> 02:05:15,620
Like I'm a fucking ant.

2534
02:05:15,620 --> 02:05:17,540
Like, no.

2535
02:05:17,540 --> 02:05:20,740
And here I said, you know, I didn't really play much in Minecraft.

2536
02:05:20,740 --> 02:05:21,780
We actually, no, we did.

2537
02:05:21,780 --> 02:05:24,180
We did take on the Ender Dragon this week.

2538
02:05:24,180 --> 02:05:25,860
So, um, that was fun.

2539
02:05:25,860 --> 02:05:30,660
So we did that as a family and now, um, the kids want to build the wither to

2540
02:05:30,660 --> 02:05:31,460
fight the wither.

2541
02:05:31,460 --> 02:05:34,420
So, um, I was helping them with that.

2542
02:05:35,140 --> 02:05:35,460
All right.

2543
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:39,140
Um, now the chat room is pulling through by doing live fact checking for us.

2544
02:05:39,140 --> 02:05:39,700
Thank you, chat.

2545
02:05:39,700 --> 02:05:40,340
Love you.

2546
02:05:40,340 --> 02:05:45,220
Uh, Questbuster says cross play, not at launch, but Mojang said they will be

2547
02:05:45,220 --> 02:05:46,340
working on it post.

2548
02:05:46,980 --> 02:05:48,500
So, all right.

2549
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:49,460
There's that.

2550
02:05:49,460 --> 02:05:49,700
All right.

2551
02:05:49,700 --> 02:05:52,740
Anyhow, the other game, I'm moving back to Frodo's Wagon's email.

2552
02:05:52,740 --> 02:05:55,060
The other game is Assassin's Creed Valhalla.

2553
02:05:55,060 --> 02:05:56,100
Have you heard of this one?

2554
02:05:56,660 --> 02:05:58,100
Funny you should bring this up now.

2555
02:05:58,100 --> 02:05:59,300
Uh, we just talked about it.

2556
02:05:59,300 --> 02:06:02,420
I never got to be a big fan of the assassin games, but this game looks pretty

2557
02:06:02,420 --> 02:06:03,140
damn good.

2558
02:06:03,140 --> 02:06:07,140
I was a big fan of the Vikings series and this looks to be right up that alley.

2559
02:06:07,140 --> 02:06:10,020
I'm not a hundred percent sure on this, but I heard when you buy a copy of the

2560
02:06:10,020 --> 02:06:12,420
game on Xbox that you get two different versions.

2561
02:06:12,420 --> 02:06:16,740
One version for all Xbox consoles up to the Xbox one X and one version that is

2562
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:19,620
only for the series X with all of the extra power.

2563
02:06:19,700 --> 02:06:23,380
If that is true, it's kind of cool how Microsoft is going about that, including

2564
02:06:23,380 --> 02:06:24,180
all of that.

2565
02:06:24,180 --> 02:06:26,500
Anyway, hope all is well Frodo's wagons.

2566
02:06:26,500 --> 02:06:29,780
Actually, I believe it's actually kind of the opposite.

2567
02:06:29,780 --> 02:06:33,940
It's that you buy one copy of the game and it's automatically upgraded to the

2568
02:06:33,940 --> 02:06:39,220
Xbox series X version when you upgrade your console, because that's what

2569
02:06:39,220 --> 02:06:41,780
Microsoft's been flexing on some of their games, right?

2570
02:06:41,780 --> 02:06:44,740
Like, like Halo is going to or Halo six, whatever they're calling it.

2571
02:06:45,700 --> 02:06:47,300
Infinite is going to be the same thing, right?

2572
02:06:47,300 --> 02:06:48,980
Like you can play it on an Xbox one X.

2573
02:06:49,060 --> 02:06:53,380
And when you buy it there, it automatically transfers to series X.

2574
02:06:53,380 --> 02:06:58,020
And the reality is Microsoft really wants you to play that stuff on game pass

2575
02:06:58,020 --> 02:06:59,700
so they can get money from you every month.

2576
02:06:59,700 --> 02:07:03,700
And it obviously those will be upgraded depending on whatever console you're on.

2577
02:07:04,340 --> 02:07:07,940
But I believe Assassin's Creed is actually, you just buy it once and now

2578
02:07:07,940 --> 02:07:09,140
you'll have it on all consoles.

2579
02:07:09,140 --> 02:07:09,940
Am I wrong on that?

2580
02:07:10,900 --> 02:07:11,300
Thank you.

2581
02:07:11,300 --> 02:07:12,260
I don't remember.

2582
02:07:12,260 --> 02:07:13,780
DJ Rama S says correct.

2583
02:07:13,780 --> 02:07:13,940
Okay.

2584
02:07:13,940 --> 02:07:14,740
That's what I thought.

2585
02:07:14,740 --> 02:07:14,980
Yeah.

2586
02:07:14,980 --> 02:07:18,580
And because that's, that's supposed to be a big draw about the game for

2587
02:07:18,580 --> 02:07:22,980
Microsoft and one that Sony kind of hasn't answered yet.

2588
02:07:22,980 --> 02:07:28,260
Although we know that unlike this last time, Sony fully intends to have

2589
02:07:28,260 --> 02:07:31,300
PlayStation four games be playable on PlayStation five.

2590
02:07:31,300 --> 02:07:35,220
Remember there was that whole kind of awkward top 100 games comment that

2591
02:07:35,220 --> 02:07:37,060
they had to kind of go back and clarify.

2592
02:07:37,060 --> 02:07:40,180
No, they're trying to get everything, but you know, they're just, they have

2593
02:07:40,180 --> 02:07:41,860
their priorities, you know, that whole thing.

2594
02:07:41,860 --> 02:07:45,780
So we know things like last of us to Final Fantasy seven remake, the

2595
02:07:45,780 --> 02:07:49,940
recent shit it's going to play on PlayStation five, will it, will it be.

2596
02:07:50,900 --> 02:07:51,220
I'm sorry.

2597
02:07:52,260 --> 02:07:52,980
Read into it.

2598
02:07:52,980 --> 02:07:55,300
Like, uh, that they were going to ignore all that stuff.

2599
02:07:55,300 --> 02:07:58,580
It's just that, you know, like Microsoft, they have so much that they've

2600
02:07:58,580 --> 02:08:02,260
started with, you know, making backwards compatible and then they're rolling

2601
02:08:02,260 --> 02:08:04,180
other stuff out as they get through it.

2602
02:08:04,180 --> 02:08:05,780
But, you know, obviously they have their priorities.

2603
02:08:06,420 --> 02:08:06,980
Yeah.

2604
02:08:06,980 --> 02:08:08,420
So awesome.

2605
02:08:08,420 --> 02:08:10,900
I just closed the mailbag before I got to the next email.

2606
02:08:11,620 --> 02:08:15,220
Uh, do you, have you been given any thought Loki too, if you're going to

2607
02:08:15,220 --> 02:08:18,740
pick up PlayStation five, Xbox one X, like, do you think any of that is in

2608
02:08:18,740 --> 02:08:19,780
your future this year?

2609
02:08:20,580 --> 02:08:22,820
Uh, I don't know.

2610
02:08:22,820 --> 02:08:26,900
Maybe Xbox that's kind of, I don't know on the fence of that.

2611
02:08:26,900 --> 02:08:29,620
Cause I do have a PC, so I can just pick up stuff on there.

2612
02:08:29,620 --> 02:08:29,940
True.

2613
02:08:29,940 --> 02:08:33,940
Um, but, uh, PlayStation, maybe, I don't know.

2614
02:08:33,940 --> 02:08:35,140
Have to see what they actually have.

2615
02:08:36,020 --> 02:08:36,500
Okay.

2616
02:08:36,500 --> 02:08:37,380
Sounds good.

2617
02:08:37,380 --> 02:08:38,980
Um, come on.

2618
02:08:38,980 --> 02:08:41,460
Now, of course, now that I need to get it back into the mailbag, I'm

2619
02:08:41,460 --> 02:08:42,820
getting the whole spinning thing.

2620
02:08:42,820 --> 02:08:43,060
All right.

2621
02:08:43,060 --> 02:08:43,620
There we go.

2622
02:08:43,620 --> 02:08:44,100
Finally.

2623
02:08:44,100 --> 02:08:45,060
Good heavens.

2624
02:08:45,060 --> 02:08:45,380
Okay.

2625
02:08:45,940 --> 02:08:52,340
Our next email comes to us from Pixel Pacas who says, hi, OLR.

2626
02:08:52,900 --> 02:08:55,940
I wanted to let y'all know about a really great game that came out

2627
02:08:55,940 --> 02:08:56,500
recently.

2628
02:08:56,500 --> 02:09:01,060
It's a visual novel called A Summer's End and focuses on the budding

2629
02:09:01,060 --> 02:09:06,020
romance between two women living in Hong Kong during the 1980s.

2630
02:09:06,020 --> 02:09:08,740
Well, that is a very kind of niche sort of thing.

2631
02:09:08,740 --> 02:09:12,660
I can't think of a lot of games that have taken on, uh, same sex female

2632
02:09:12,660 --> 02:09:14,900
relationships in Hong Kong in the 1980s.

2633
02:09:14,900 --> 02:09:17,620
Uh, are there other video games that cover that, that you can think of

2634
02:09:17,620 --> 02:09:18,020
Logie?

2635
02:09:19,380 --> 02:09:19,620
No.

2636
02:09:19,620 --> 02:09:20,660
So this may be a first.

2637
02:09:20,660 --> 02:09:20,980
I don't know.

2638
02:09:20,980 --> 02:09:22,420
No, that, but you know what?

2639
02:09:22,420 --> 02:09:25,460
I also like, it might, you might think I'm making fun of it.

2640
02:09:25,460 --> 02:09:26,740
I'm really not.

2641
02:09:26,740 --> 02:09:32,900
Like I really fucking love games that make you consider differently or

2642
02:09:32,900 --> 02:09:36,260
tell a different story that you might not have thought of otherwise.

2643
02:09:36,260 --> 02:09:39,460
So already in this first paragraph, you have my attention.

2644
02:09:40,660 --> 02:09:44,580
Visual novels are a genre pretty close to my heart and I play them all

2645
02:09:44,580 --> 02:09:45,380
the time.

2646
02:09:45,380 --> 02:09:48,420
For those who have never played the genre, there are a surprising

2647
02:09:48,420 --> 02:09:51,300
amount of titles focused on LGBTQ themes.

2648
02:09:51,300 --> 02:09:55,380
With that being said, most of these visual novels depict absolutely no

2649
02:09:55,380 --> 02:09:57,060
conflict around being gay.

2650
02:09:57,060 --> 02:10:00,020
This is a wonderful fantasy, but certainly doesn't reflect many

2651
02:10:00,020 --> 02:10:01,540
people's actual experiences.

2652
02:10:02,260 --> 02:10:07,220
A Summer's End uses both the timeframe and setting to make the storyline

2653
02:10:07,220 --> 02:10:10,100
more realistic than most visual novels.

2654
02:10:10,100 --> 02:10:14,100
The protagonist must come to terms with her sexuality and decide whether

2655
02:10:14,100 --> 02:10:18,420
to live her own truth or live with her mother's traditional expectations.

2656
02:10:18,420 --> 02:10:21,860
Her struggles really echoed my own, which is something I've never felt

2657
02:10:21,860 --> 02:10:23,380
reflected in a game before.

2658
02:10:23,380 --> 02:10:24,420
Oh, okay.

2659
02:10:24,420 --> 02:10:26,900
So interesting that you call that out because you're right.

2660
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:30,580
A lot of games, like, let's say like Dream Daddy.

2661
02:10:30,580 --> 02:10:30,820
Okay.

2662
02:10:31,220 --> 02:10:34,820
That's an extremely well-known visual novel game that takes on LGBT

2663
02:10:34,820 --> 02:10:35,220
themes.

2664
02:10:36,260 --> 02:10:41,060
And it's never like, okay, these dudes are gay.

2665
02:10:41,060 --> 02:10:41,620
Cool.

2666
02:10:41,620 --> 02:10:44,420
You know, it's accepted by everybody.

2667
02:10:44,420 --> 02:10:47,140
It's just the way it is in the game.

2668
02:10:47,140 --> 02:10:51,860
So we don't often really get to explore the reality for many of us that

2669
02:10:51,860 --> 02:10:56,020
are in the LGBT community where it's not always accepted by everyone

2670
02:10:56,020 --> 02:10:56,900
right away.

2671
02:10:56,900 --> 02:10:59,620
This game might make you experience that a little bit.

2672
02:10:59,620 --> 02:11:02,820
So where I said just a minute ago, you know, I like exploring these

2673
02:11:02,820 --> 02:11:06,260
types of things that I might not otherwise understand.

2674
02:11:06,260 --> 02:11:08,500
You know, I certainly don't know what it's like to be a woman in Hong

2675
02:11:08,500 --> 02:11:09,620
Kong in 1980s.

2676
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:15,540
I may have some experience with, you know, being gay and coming out and

2677
02:11:15,540 --> 02:11:20,020
all that, but like, this is a game that a lot of people could maybe,

2678
02:11:20,020 --> 02:11:22,260
like, learn something from in a way.

2679
02:11:22,260 --> 02:11:23,780
And I think that's really cool about novels.

2680
02:11:23,780 --> 02:11:27,300
And I bet there's, I know there's all types of these games out there.

2681
02:11:27,300 --> 02:11:27,940
You know, I know that.

2682
02:11:28,740 --> 02:11:32,180
Steam just had like a freaking expo they were doing.

2683
02:11:32,180 --> 02:11:39,380
They were doing like a, it was like, it was a play on Ludum Dare was the

2684
02:11:39,380 --> 02:11:39,780
name of it.

2685
02:11:39,780 --> 02:11:40,900
Somebody in chat is going to yell it.

2686
02:11:40,900 --> 02:11:42,740
I know I should bring my chat window back up.

2687
02:11:42,740 --> 02:11:47,700
And Steam was having this big exhibition of all these visual novel games

2688
02:11:47,700 --> 02:11:48,500
recently.

2689
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:49,220
And you know what?

2690
02:11:49,220 --> 02:11:52,500
I'm sure there's all sorts of themes that are explored in these games.

2691
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:54,900
And it honestly, it's probably something I need to be a little more

2692
02:11:54,900 --> 02:11:55,620
familiar with.

2693
02:11:55,620 --> 02:11:59,460
But sometimes, like, seriously, if you went to Steam during this and saw

2694
02:11:59,460 --> 02:12:03,300
the list of games, it can almost be overwhelming.

2695
02:12:04,100 --> 02:12:07,620
It's like there's 500 visual novel games to choose from.

2696
02:12:07,620 --> 02:12:12,580
And it is overwhelming, but you know, it's very akin to walking into a

2697
02:12:12,580 --> 02:12:13,700
library.

2698
02:12:13,700 --> 02:12:16,580
Every book has some sort of story to tell.

2699
02:12:16,580 --> 02:12:19,940
And every game, even though I'm overwhelmed, like, Oh my God, 500

2700
02:12:19,940 --> 02:12:22,260
games, you know, to pick from, what do I do?

2701
02:12:22,820 --> 02:12:24,500
Every one of them has a story to tell.

2702
02:12:25,140 --> 02:12:28,100
And some of them may be things you've never experienced before.

2703
02:12:28,100 --> 02:12:28,500
Thank you.

2704
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:30,020
PixelPakas is in chat right now.

2705
02:12:30,020 --> 02:12:33,300
It's Ludo Narakon, narrator, Narakon.

2706
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:33,860
So thank you.

2707
02:12:33,860 --> 02:12:34,500
That was what I knew.

2708
02:12:34,500 --> 02:12:37,220
It was like a play on, like, I thought, like, Ludum Dare or something.

2709
02:12:37,220 --> 02:12:37,860
Okay.

2710
02:12:37,860 --> 02:12:40,180
Anyway, moving on with the rest of the email.

2711
02:12:41,140 --> 02:12:43,940
Just wanted to share this beautiful game with the OLR audience.

2712
02:12:43,940 --> 02:12:47,300
It's currently available on Steam for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

2713
02:12:47,300 --> 02:12:50,900
The developers want to bring it to consoles, but nothing is confirmed

2714
02:12:50,900 --> 02:12:51,300
yet.

2715
02:12:51,300 --> 02:12:54,260
That again from PixelPakas and the game one more time.

2716
02:12:54,260 --> 02:12:55,780
A Summer's End.

2717
02:12:55,780 --> 02:12:56,580
So cool.

2718
02:12:56,580 --> 02:12:57,700
I'm going to put that on my list.

2719
02:12:57,700 --> 02:13:00,500
So next time I get presented with a list of these 500 titles, I'll know

2720
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:01,380
which one to look for.

2721
02:13:01,380 --> 02:13:02,020
So thank you.

2722
02:13:02,660 --> 02:13:03,300
You know what?

2723
02:13:03,300 --> 02:13:08,740
And sometimes these, like, I want to say, like, these, these lower stress

2724
02:13:08,740 --> 02:13:12,340
games, I don't know, maybe a novel can be very stressful.

2725
02:13:12,340 --> 02:13:13,300
Certainly they can.

2726
02:13:13,300 --> 02:13:14,580
But you guys know what I mean.

2727
02:13:14,580 --> 02:13:18,260
The games that always get dogged as walking simulators, like Edith Finch,

2728
02:13:19,060 --> 02:13:22,020
Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, Dear Esther, all those types of games

2729
02:13:22,020 --> 02:13:24,180
usually get, I know those aren't visual novels, but I think

2730
02:13:24,180 --> 02:13:26,820
what they have similarly is that those types of games always get

2731
02:13:26,820 --> 02:13:29,220
dogged on for not having much of a game behind it.

2732
02:13:29,220 --> 02:13:33,220
But the stories behind it and what you go through in the game is very

2733
02:13:33,220 --> 02:13:33,700
impressive.

2734
02:13:33,700 --> 02:13:36,820
And I think that's something that probably is a common thread between

2735
02:13:36,820 --> 02:13:39,540
this and visual novel games, is that visual novel games aren't

2736
02:13:39,540 --> 02:13:41,300
necessarily hard per se.

2737
02:13:41,300 --> 02:13:44,260
Although, I mean, if you think about it, games like King's Quest and that

2738
02:13:44,260 --> 02:13:46,340
shit back in the day was a visual novel, sort of, sort of.

2739
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:50,020
And, you know, there's definitely stories to tell there.

2740
02:13:50,020 --> 02:13:52,420
Anyway, I could go on and on, but thank you for the recommendation.

2741
02:13:53,140 --> 02:13:53,460
All right.

2742
02:13:53,460 --> 02:13:57,620
And our last email tonight, last but not least, from YYR.

2743
02:13:58,660 --> 02:13:59,700
Hello, LR.

2744
02:14:00,660 --> 02:14:03,860
I cannot begin to tell you how excited I was that Kirby's Dream Land

2745
02:14:03,860 --> 02:14:05,780
was last week's classic game of the week.

2746
02:14:05,780 --> 02:14:08,420
It's one of my all-time favorite games on any platforms.

2747
02:14:09,140 --> 02:14:12,260
One of my favorite things about it, well, apart from the fantastic music,

2748
02:14:12,260 --> 02:14:15,060
some of the best graphics on the original Game Boy and the sheer joy

2749
02:14:15,060 --> 02:14:17,780
that comes from controlling that squishy puff ball is how the

2750
02:14:17,780 --> 02:14:20,100
developers made the game so customizable.

2751
02:14:20,100 --> 02:14:22,260
It can be as challenging or as easy as you want.

2752
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:23,940
The base game is very easy.

2753
02:14:23,940 --> 02:14:27,380
An average Joe, who is even slightly competent at platforming and action

2754
02:14:27,380 --> 02:14:29,700
games, can complete it without much trouble.

2755
02:14:29,700 --> 02:14:32,900
But as was mentioned on last week's segment, when you complete the game,

2756
02:14:32,900 --> 02:14:35,460
you receive a code to unlock a much more difficult level.

2757
02:14:36,100 --> 02:14:39,380
Extra game, as this was called, was not simply a lazy tacked on mode

2758
02:14:39,380 --> 02:14:42,100
where enemies do more damage, although this is also true.

2759
02:14:42,740 --> 02:14:46,020
Most of the enemies either had entirely different behaviors or

2760
02:14:46,020 --> 02:14:48,180
completely replaced by new enemies.

2761
02:14:48,180 --> 02:14:51,700
All of the game's bosses had totally new patterns and attacks.

2762
02:14:51,700 --> 02:14:54,420
If anyone was disappointed by the default difficulty,

2763
02:14:54,420 --> 02:14:56,820
they'd generally be happy with this one.

2764
02:14:56,820 --> 02:15:01,700
But once you manage to complete extra game, you receive a second secret code.

2765
02:15:01,700 --> 02:15:05,300
This not only unlocks an awesome sound test feature, but also allows you

2766
02:15:05,300 --> 02:15:08,500
to customize the life bar and the number of lives you start with.

2767
02:15:08,500 --> 02:15:11,220
You can even combine this with extra game code if you want,

2768
02:15:11,220 --> 02:15:14,020
making the game's difficulty 100% customizable.

2769
02:15:14,020 --> 02:15:17,780
This was and still is a rarity in video gaming and serves to make the

2770
02:15:17,780 --> 02:15:21,060
game even more awesome than it otherwise was.

2771
02:15:21,060 --> 02:15:24,340
One of my favorite challenges is to play the easy difficulty,

2772
02:15:24,340 --> 02:15:26,660
but with only a single hit point.

2773
02:15:26,660 --> 02:15:27,620
Can you do it?

2774
02:15:27,620 --> 02:15:28,340
You ought to try.

2775
02:15:28,980 --> 02:15:30,900
Anyway, I'll end with an apology.

2776
02:15:30,900 --> 02:15:34,180
Sorry, but I have no plans to add the Super Scope support to

2777
02:15:34,180 --> 02:15:35,860
Sharpshooter Plus, darn.

2778
02:15:35,860 --> 02:15:38,180
But I hope that you'll continue to enjoy the game without it.

2779
02:15:38,180 --> 02:15:38,680
We will.

2780
02:15:39,140 --> 02:15:43,300
Actually, I do have a plan to add support for some other devices eventually,

2781
02:15:43,300 --> 02:15:46,820
possibly later this year, but, well, stay tuned.

2782
02:15:46,820 --> 02:15:48,820
Hope you're all staying happy and healthy.

2783
02:15:48,820 --> 02:15:50,180
Have a great week.

2784
02:15:50,180 --> 02:15:53,060
Sucking and spitting, Aaron, yyr.

2785
02:15:53,060 --> 02:15:54,180
Thanks for the note, yyr.

2786
02:15:54,180 --> 02:15:54,980
Appreciate it.

2787
02:15:54,980 --> 02:15:58,420
And yeah, go pick up Sharpshooter Plus if you haven't picked that up already.

2788
02:15:58,420 --> 02:16:00,020
And it's always great to hear from yyr.

2789
02:16:01,540 --> 02:16:05,220
You know what that kind of reminds me of when you talk about like a mode

2790
02:16:05,220 --> 02:16:08,020
that you run through it the second time and the enemies change?

2791
02:16:09,860 --> 02:16:13,060
Remember when you beat Super Mario Brothers for the first time?

2792
02:16:13,060 --> 02:16:15,220
You kind of got like the second quest.

2793
02:16:15,220 --> 02:16:19,620
You'd run through it again, but now the goombas are the little beetle dudes

2794
02:16:19,620 --> 02:16:22,420
and some things are faster and some things have changed.

2795
02:16:22,420 --> 02:16:27,140
I feel like the roots of that mode in Kirby are kind of rooted in what you

2796
02:16:27,140 --> 02:16:29,860
saw there in like Super Mario Brothers and earlier games like that.

2797
02:16:30,900 --> 02:16:34,180
And it's kind of, yeah, it's kind of something that was really unique to that

2798
02:16:34,180 --> 02:16:37,460
era, the 8-bit games, and I'm looping Game Boy in with 8-bit games,

2799
02:16:38,100 --> 02:16:40,900
kind of unique to that era we don't see as much of anymore.

2800
02:16:40,900 --> 02:16:44,900
I mean, we see like harder modes and things that get unlocked and so forth,

2801
02:16:45,060 --> 02:16:48,340
like, you know, replacing monsters, changing their behavior,

2802
02:16:48,340 --> 02:16:49,940
allowing you to customize things.

2803
02:16:50,500 --> 02:16:53,140
You didn't see that or you saw that more back in the day.

2804
02:16:53,140 --> 02:16:56,420
You don't see it as much now, but pretty cool.

2805
02:16:56,420 --> 02:16:58,500
Thanks. Thank you for the trip down memory lane.

2806
02:16:58,500 --> 02:17:00,740
I appreciate that. And I will share that with Jamie when I can.

2807
02:17:01,540 --> 02:17:02,980
All right. That is it for the email back.

2808
02:17:02,980 --> 02:17:05,780
So we had a lot of emails considering I looked before the show and there was none.

2809
02:17:05,780 --> 02:17:07,300
We got like three right at the buzzer there.

2810
02:17:07,300 --> 02:17:08,660
So I appreciate that, guys. Awesome.

2811
02:17:08,660 --> 02:17:09,780
Yeah. Awesome. All right.

2812
02:17:09,780 --> 02:17:12,820
Well, let's get back into a few more stories here before we wrap up for the night.

2813
02:17:12,820 --> 02:17:14,260
So, Loki, why don't you start us off?

2814
02:17:14,980 --> 02:17:17,380
So I've been wondering for a while, it's like,

2815
02:17:17,380 --> 02:17:19,620
when are we going to start using these amiibos again?

2816
02:17:19,620 --> 02:17:24,980
Because, you know, obviously, since we didn't really have much amiibo support,

2817
02:17:24,980 --> 02:17:27,220
or I don't think any. I don't know about you,

2818
02:17:27,220 --> 02:17:31,140
but I've finally been using those Animal Crossing ones I collected to get,

2819
02:17:31,140 --> 02:17:34,020
I guess, for Animal Crossing. All those posters. Yeah.

2820
02:17:34,020 --> 02:17:37,060
But I'm talking about like, you know, for like Mario Maker 2 and stuff.

2821
02:17:37,060 --> 02:17:39,700
So I was wondering, when's this going to happen?

2822
02:17:39,700 --> 02:17:41,780
Well, apparently that may be happening soon.

2823
02:17:41,780 --> 02:17:46,260
So thanks to a new patent filed by Nintendo,

2824
02:17:46,260 --> 02:17:49,940
it appears that amiibos are going to be back in a brand new game.

2825
02:17:52,260 --> 02:17:56,180
So the functionality, I can't really tell what they're doing with this.

2826
02:17:56,180 --> 02:18:00,100
For example, it looks like some sort of RPG or something like that.

2827
02:18:00,980 --> 02:18:05,620
They show like a picture of like playing as the squid kid or something like that.

2828
02:18:05,620 --> 02:18:08,900
So I'm wondering if this is going to somehow allow you to play as

2829
02:18:08,900 --> 02:18:11,540
different amiibo characters in certain games.

2830
02:18:12,180 --> 02:18:18,740
Um, pretty neat though. I'm not really sure what exactly it's supposed to be

2831
02:18:18,740 --> 02:18:21,540
that they're developing, but maybe we'll hear about that soon.

2832
02:18:22,740 --> 02:18:26,980
That could be really cool if that's like a Nintendo online thing,

2833
02:18:26,980 --> 02:18:30,340
that like you could download a free, you know, simple,

2834
02:18:30,340 --> 02:18:34,180
simple-ish RPG where your amiibo are the characters.

2835
02:18:34,180 --> 02:18:36,100
It makes me think there's this Disney game

2836
02:18:36,660 --> 02:18:39,140
they've been pushing on a lot of ad platforms lately.

2837
02:18:39,140 --> 02:18:41,300
That's essentially like an RPG with different characters.

2838
02:18:41,380 --> 02:18:44,260
It's all like a gacha mechanic, but you unlock different,

2839
02:18:44,260 --> 02:18:46,260
it's like Disney sorcery or something like that.

2840
02:18:46,260 --> 02:18:48,340
I don't know. I'm not going to, they're not paying me.

2841
02:18:48,340 --> 02:18:50,420
I'm not going to plug it, but they have something like that.

2842
02:18:50,420 --> 02:18:53,620
So I'm thinking like, what if like, okay, well, instead of like gacha,

2843
02:18:53,620 --> 02:18:58,820
what if Nintendo use like amiibo to kind of have their own type of like RPG game

2844
02:18:58,820 --> 02:19:02,260
that you could build your team and fight against other teams and things like that.

2845
02:19:02,260 --> 02:19:04,180
And maybe it's something they tied in Nintendo online.

2846
02:19:04,180 --> 02:19:07,060
It's like, here's another perk of being a Nintendo online subscriber.

2847
02:19:07,060 --> 02:19:10,820
Cause you know, we're going to have that year is about to come up again.

2848
02:19:10,820 --> 02:19:14,020
Many people got another year free thanks to Twitch prime,

2849
02:19:14,020 --> 02:19:15,700
but I'm going to guess that doesn't happen again.

2850
02:19:15,700 --> 02:19:19,140
So people are going to have to, you know, pay the money for another year

2851
02:19:19,140 --> 02:19:21,620
and people will probably do it just for animal crossing.

2852
02:19:22,420 --> 02:19:25,860
But you know, what, what other value are they going to bring to that Tetris 99?

2853
02:19:25,860 --> 02:19:27,380
That was a great one, but what else?

2854
02:19:27,380 --> 02:19:31,060
You know, cause the, the classic library, those wells have been drying up.

2855
02:19:32,580 --> 02:19:33,080
Yeah.

2856
02:19:33,620 --> 02:19:38,020
I don't know with all the Nintendo and super Nintendo games on there, man.

2857
02:19:38,580 --> 02:19:41,300
So it's a NES remix or super NES remix.

2858
02:19:42,260 --> 02:19:45,780
I know, but I take a amiibo based RPG.

2859
02:19:45,780 --> 02:19:50,340
Why not give me more value to all those little suckers that I spent all that money on?

2860
02:19:50,340 --> 02:19:51,220
I'd love it.

2861
02:19:51,220 --> 02:19:55,220
If they had like an amiibo RPG game, I'd already have like 200 characters.

2862
02:19:55,220 --> 02:19:57,860
It might not that many, but I'd have a lot.

2863
02:19:57,860 --> 02:20:01,060
I would have a lot considering all the characters that I have.

2864
02:20:01,060 --> 02:20:03,220
It might not support everything though.

2865
02:20:03,220 --> 02:20:06,660
Like they might not have the rights to use something like cloud.

2866
02:20:07,460 --> 02:20:11,780
Um, but they could probably use, I mean, the third party stuff.

2867
02:20:11,780 --> 02:20:13,380
There aren't a lot of those.

2868
02:20:13,380 --> 02:20:16,660
Most of them are based around Nintendo first party franchises and they can do whatever

2869
02:20:16,660 --> 02:20:17,380
they want with those.

2870
02:20:17,380 --> 02:20:20,020
So it'd be interesting to see if that actually happens.

2871
02:20:20,580 --> 02:20:21,300
All right.

2872
02:20:21,300 --> 02:20:25,540
Well, moving on to talk about Xbox game pass and how well it's been doing, uh, as of late,

2873
02:20:25,540 --> 02:20:27,060
you know, I, I was talking about game pass.

2874
02:20:27,060 --> 02:20:28,740
I was using it to play streets of rage four.

2875
02:20:29,380 --> 02:20:30,580
I think it's pretty neat.

2876
02:20:30,580 --> 02:20:32,900
And a lot of other people apparently tuning onto it as well.

2877
02:20:33,460 --> 02:20:34,260
Excuse me.

2878
02:20:34,260 --> 02:20:36,500
Game pass has over 10 million subscribers.

2879
02:20:36,500 --> 02:20:39,460
That's a pretty big landmark, 10 million people on game pass.

2880
02:20:39,460 --> 02:20:43,700
Uh, Phil Spencer, head of Xbox noted this recently in a new blog post talking about

2881
02:20:43,700 --> 02:20:45,700
how the service is continuing to grow.

2882
02:20:45,700 --> 02:20:48,580
That was up from 9.5 million last year.

2883
02:20:48,580 --> 02:20:53,780
Uh, and, uh, also in the blog post, it was noted subscribers are playing games twice

2884
02:20:53,780 --> 02:20:57,220
as much since the COVID 19 pandemic started.

2885
02:20:57,220 --> 02:20:58,820
And I'm kind of one of those people.

2886
02:20:59,700 --> 02:21:03,620
I wasn't really dipping into like deeply into the library.

2887
02:21:03,620 --> 02:21:06,180
I might check out a first party Microsoft title when it's released,

2888
02:21:06,180 --> 02:21:08,740
but I wasn't playing a lot of other stuff now.

2889
02:21:08,740 --> 02:21:12,820
I've been like, I've been going deep in that library and playing everything.

2890
02:21:12,820 --> 02:21:16,740
So, um, yeah, I think game pass has been great for me.

2891
02:21:16,740 --> 02:21:20,100
So, um, congrats to them on 10 million.

2892
02:21:20,100 --> 02:21:22,420
That means I think this is going to be around for awhile.

2893
02:21:22,420 --> 02:21:28,260
I'm very curious to see how they build this into the Xbox series X economy and

2894
02:21:28,260 --> 02:21:33,380
essentially if video games don't generally just go a Netflix direction like movies have.

2895
02:21:34,100 --> 02:21:34,580
We'll see.

2896
02:21:35,220 --> 02:21:35,860
We'll see.

2897
02:21:35,860 --> 02:21:36,100
Yeah.

2898
02:21:36,100 --> 02:21:40,980
I mean, definitely it would be a more appealing offer for me if they had more games on the

2899
02:21:40,980 --> 02:21:42,100
PC side of things.

2900
02:21:42,100 --> 02:21:45,700
Um, that may be why I may need to get one of the series X's.

2901
02:21:45,700 --> 02:21:48,420
Um, well that a 4k monitor, I would assume.

2902
02:21:49,060 --> 02:21:50,420
So, um, we'll see.

2903
02:21:50,420 --> 02:21:53,220
S2 and her mountain chat says I still don't have game pass.

2904
02:21:53,220 --> 02:21:55,060
I should probably get it at this rate.

2905
02:21:55,060 --> 02:21:58,900
My issue is that I'm trying to finish the game I already have before getting more.

2906
02:21:58,900 --> 02:21:59,460
Yeah.

2907
02:21:59,460 --> 02:22:04,420
Um, if you're worried about your backlog expanding, Xbox game pass isn't really going to help

2908
02:22:04,420 --> 02:22:05,220
with that.

2909
02:22:05,220 --> 02:22:07,300
Um, but it's still pretty impressive.

2910
02:22:07,300 --> 02:22:12,500
I also want my one other thing about game pass is that it's got a decent selection.

2911
02:22:12,500 --> 02:22:20,980
I wish it were a little larger because I feel like there's a very rich Xbox 360 and original

2912
02:22:20,980 --> 02:22:25,860
Xbox library that they haven't fully tapped into as much as they could.

2913
02:22:26,580 --> 02:22:32,420
Um, and maybe that's probably has to do with rights licenses and so forth, but even first

2914
02:22:32,420 --> 02:22:37,780
party Microsoft titles, we don't have enough of those on game pass.

2915
02:22:37,780 --> 02:22:42,260
And so that's maybe where I'd like to see game pass really round out because I'm telling,

2916
02:22:42,260 --> 02:22:45,220
you know, and I understand it's probably a little harder to get the current stuff it's

2917
02:22:45,220 --> 02:22:50,660
over, but like these Xbox 360 games that, you know, they probably don't make money anymore.

2918
02:22:50,660 --> 02:22:52,020
They're not selling them new.

2919
02:22:52,020 --> 02:22:56,100
They're probably only moving around on the third party market, maybe a few digital copies

2920
02:22:56,100 --> 02:23:00,020
here and there, but think about how much, you know, you might be able to make on a subscription

2921
02:23:00,020 --> 02:23:03,940
based thing where it's like, Oh, you know, all these games that I haven't touched in

2922
02:23:03,940 --> 02:23:09,540
like 10 years, I can go back and check out, you know, so it'd be cool.

2923
02:23:09,540 --> 02:23:10,580
So we'll see.

2924
02:23:10,580 --> 02:23:11,140
I do.

2925
02:23:11,140 --> 02:23:13,700
I still would recommend game pass as it is.

2926
02:23:13,700 --> 02:23:14,100
It's fine.

2927
02:23:14,100 --> 02:23:18,980
But I think, Ooh, if we could just like round out that library even more with like a stronger,

2928
02:23:18,980 --> 02:23:20,340
like retro ish.

2929
02:23:20,340 --> 02:23:23,060
It's weird to talk about Xbox 360 as retro, but that's what it is.

2930
02:23:24,100 --> 02:23:24,820
What was that again?

2931
02:23:24,820 --> 02:23:30,740
It was, uh, um, what the hell was the, uh, the Xbox arcade thing?

2932
02:23:30,740 --> 02:23:31,700
Oh, game room.

2933
02:23:31,700 --> 02:23:32,900
Oh, don't get me started.

2934
02:23:32,900 --> 02:23:33,940
Game room.

2935
02:23:33,940 --> 02:23:34,420
Come on.

2936
02:23:35,060 --> 02:23:35,700
I'd love it.

2937
02:23:35,700 --> 02:23:40,020
But the rights get complicated because of all the Atari games and all that stuff.

2938
02:23:40,020 --> 02:23:41,620
But yeah, we'll see.

2939
02:23:41,620 --> 02:23:42,820
We'll see what comes of that.

2940
02:23:42,820 --> 02:23:43,060
All right.

2941
02:23:43,060 --> 02:23:43,700
Moving on.

2942
02:23:43,700 --> 02:23:44,580
Do you want to do this Loki?

2943
02:23:44,580 --> 02:23:47,540
You want me to take it or the next story that Jamie had?

2944
02:23:47,540 --> 02:23:48,100
Okay.

2945
02:23:48,100 --> 02:23:49,540
Yeah, I can talk about it.

2946
02:23:49,540 --> 02:23:57,700
So, um, we've got the university of Utah, obviously not going to be able to hold their

2947
02:23:57,700 --> 02:24:04,260
graduation, um, live, um, at least outside when the world there, but apparently they're

2948
02:24:04,260 --> 02:24:08,660
going to be holding it digitally in a video game that they designed.

2949
02:24:09,380 --> 02:24:14,500
So, um, they're going to be able to join in, in that video game as different avatars and

2950
02:24:14,500 --> 02:24:17,060
be able to walk down the aisle.

2951
02:24:17,060 --> 02:24:19,620
And I don't know, this whole game looks like Roblox.

2952
02:24:19,620 --> 02:24:20,260
I swear to God.

2953
02:24:20,260 --> 02:24:26,900
But, uh, anyways, um, so yeah, they're going to be doing this digital ceremony and being

2954
02:24:26,900 --> 02:24:30,900
allowed, I guess also streaming on Twitch so that your family and friends can watch.

2955
02:24:32,340 --> 02:24:32,740
Cool.

2956
02:24:32,740 --> 02:24:33,380
Pretty neat.

2957
02:24:33,940 --> 02:24:39,220
Hey, it's making the best of a not so great situation, but you know, I know a lot of people

2958
02:24:39,220 --> 02:24:42,580
have been doing the zoom stuff to keep in touch and yeah, it's, it's cool.

2959
02:24:42,580 --> 02:24:46,500
So, you know, it's, it's something it's what we got to do in these times.

2960
02:24:46,500 --> 02:24:51,060
Just think I kind of like the, the lobbies and everything that they made, like, I don't

2961
02:24:51,060 --> 02:24:54,260
know, it looks like it's almost like unreal four or something, but yeah, it just looks

2962
02:24:54,260 --> 02:24:58,260
like people dressed up like in cosplay on most people, avatar things over their head.

2963
02:24:58,260 --> 02:24:59,860
But I don't know.

2964
02:24:59,860 --> 02:25:00,500
It's pretty cool.

2965
02:25:01,060 --> 02:25:04,660
Uh, Bobby Blackwolf and chat points out, I had a Facebook friend post about playing

2966
02:25:04,660 --> 02:25:07,780
retro classic games with their kid during shelter in place.

2967
02:25:07,780 --> 02:25:09,300
They were playing Wii bowling,

2968
02:25:09,300 --> 02:25:15,140
which I mean, we, what we bowling was 2006.

2969
02:25:15,140 --> 02:25:16,660
That's a 14 year old game.

2970
02:25:16,660 --> 02:25:16,980
Sorry.

2971
02:25:17,860 --> 02:25:18,740
Play what you got.

2972
02:25:18,740 --> 02:25:22,100
It's just funny to call it retro, but it is right.

2973
02:25:22,100 --> 02:25:23,780
It would qualify as classic game of the week.

2974
02:25:23,780 --> 02:25:24,340
Wouldn't it?

2975
02:25:24,340 --> 02:25:25,700
It's over 10 years old.

2976
02:25:26,340 --> 02:25:26,580
All right.

2977
02:25:26,580 --> 02:25:30,100
Which I'm actually, no, we say that I'm kind of surprised that hasn't come up maybe in

2978
02:25:30,100 --> 02:25:30,900
the future.

2979
02:25:30,900 --> 02:25:31,300
All right.

2980
02:25:31,300 --> 02:25:35,220
It may have, I'm surprised it hasn't been.

2981
02:25:35,220 --> 02:25:36,100
I don't think so.

2982
02:25:36,100 --> 02:25:36,580
I don't know.

2983
02:25:37,300 --> 02:25:39,140
There's always games that come up.

2984
02:25:39,140 --> 02:25:40,260
Just like, just like dark soccer.

2985
02:25:40,260 --> 02:25:42,900
Like a couple of weeks ago, she picked a game where it's like, how have I never picked this

2986
02:25:42,900 --> 02:25:43,400
game?

2987
02:25:43,780 --> 02:25:44,500
It just happens.

2988
02:25:44,500 --> 02:25:46,100
There's, there's a lot of games out there.

2989
02:25:46,100 --> 02:25:46,660
All right.

2990
02:25:46,660 --> 02:25:48,660
Uh, moving on just a couple more stories for you guys.

2991
02:25:48,660 --> 02:25:49,160
Loki.

2992
02:25:50,100 --> 02:25:50,900
All right.

2993
02:25:50,900 --> 02:25:53,780
So let's talk a little bit about Nintendo again.

2994
02:25:53,780 --> 02:26:00,980
And unfortunately, since you may not be using, um, the Wii U very much, their eShop is of

2995
02:26:00,980 --> 02:26:03,060
course closing July 31st.

2996
02:26:03,060 --> 02:26:08,020
Same with Nintendo 3DS, uh, July 31st in some countries.

2997
02:26:08,020 --> 02:26:09,300
So not everywhere.

2998
02:26:09,300 --> 02:26:17,700
Um, several countries in the Caribbean and Latin America are closing shop there.

2999
02:26:17,700 --> 02:26:23,300
Um, there's too many to list fortunately, but it is unfortunate those are closing.

3000
02:26:24,020 --> 02:26:26,420
I guess you just got to move on to the new platforms.

3001
02:26:27,300 --> 02:26:32,900
Um, yeah, both shops in Mexico and Brazil will be exempt from these closures.

3002
02:26:34,020 --> 02:26:34,500
Yeah.

3003
02:26:34,500 --> 02:26:39,140
So I'm not terribly surprised to hear about Wii U and again, this is other countries,

3004
02:26:39,140 --> 02:26:40,180
not the US.

3005
02:26:40,180 --> 02:26:45,060
I'm not terribly surprised to hear about Wii U going away because I think Nintendo is ready

3006
02:26:45,060 --> 02:26:46,740
to let that shit go.

3007
02:26:46,740 --> 02:26:47,940
Um, which it does.

3008
02:26:48,500 --> 02:26:51,140
Wii U still has a great virtual console library.

3009
02:26:51,140 --> 02:26:54,900
Wii U still has some good, you know, especially the fact that Wii U kind of emulates Wii.

3010
02:26:54,900 --> 02:26:59,460
There's still a lot of things to like about it, but, um, you know, I, I it's kind of one

3011
02:26:59,460 --> 02:27:00,260
of those, I get it.

3012
02:27:00,260 --> 02:27:03,860
Nintendo is ready to be rid of the ghost of the Wii U.

3013
02:27:03,860 --> 02:27:08,900
I'm a little more surprised about 3DS because I feel like Nintendo is still kind of been

3014
02:27:08,900 --> 02:27:10,260
pushing that device.

3015
02:27:10,820 --> 02:27:15,540
And again, we have to stress it's other countries right now, but I still feel, I feel like the

3016
02:27:15,540 --> 02:27:21,620
last time this happened with the Wii shop, the US and Europe and Japan were not far behind.

3017
02:27:23,060 --> 02:27:24,260
Am I, am I just crazy?

3018
02:27:24,260 --> 02:27:25,380
Am I remembering this a different way?

3019
02:27:25,380 --> 02:27:27,700
But I feel like this is very similar to what happened before.

3020
02:27:29,460 --> 02:27:29,780
Right.

3021
02:27:29,780 --> 02:27:30,260
Yeah.

3022
02:27:30,260 --> 02:27:34,420
It wasn't that far long after that the days ended up shutting that stuff down.

3023
02:27:34,420 --> 02:27:35,380
I think so.

3024
02:27:35,380 --> 02:27:38,340
So, I mean, even though it's not the US and Europe, it might be.

3025
02:27:38,340 --> 02:27:43,540
So I'm just saying if you have points, you got gift cards, you might want to just go

3026
02:27:43,540 --> 02:27:44,660
find something to buy.

3027
02:27:44,660 --> 02:27:48,020
There's still, there's still a lot of good stuff on Wii U and so forth and 3DS.

3028
02:27:48,020 --> 02:27:49,300
Go find it, go buy it.

3029
02:27:49,300 --> 02:27:53,780
Cause can't guarantee it's going to be there much longer and show those developers a little

3030
02:27:53,780 --> 02:27:56,260
love who probably haven't had their games sell in a while.

3031
02:27:56,260 --> 02:27:57,060
So, all right.

3032
02:27:57,940 --> 02:28:01,460
Uh, one systems games, you're not going to be able to find on virtual console though,

3033
02:28:01,460 --> 02:28:04,500
which is a shame is the Atari 2600.

3034
02:28:04,500 --> 02:28:06,820
Well, I guess they do have those flashback games.

3035
02:28:06,820 --> 02:28:07,540
Right.

3036
02:28:07,540 --> 02:28:10,580
But, um, I haven't played the latest flashback series.

3037
02:28:10,580 --> 02:28:15,380
There's like a three volume flashback series, but I've been a little on the, I, I feel

3038
02:28:15,380 --> 02:28:17,700
like they might, I don't know.

3039
02:28:17,700 --> 02:28:20,580
I feel like the breaking it up into three volumes isn't the way to do it.

3040
02:28:20,580 --> 02:28:20,980
We'll see.

3041
02:28:20,980 --> 02:28:21,700
I don't know.

3042
02:28:21,700 --> 02:28:23,700
Anyway, but that's not what this is about.

3043
02:28:23,700 --> 02:28:27,780
This is about using the Atari 2600 to teach AI.

3044
02:28:28,580 --> 02:28:34,820
So a team of Uber AI researchers developed a system called go explore.

3045
02:28:35,860 --> 02:28:39,540
It will beat any Atari 2600 game.

3046
02:28:39,540 --> 02:28:41,140
I don't know what they mean by any though.

3047
02:28:41,140 --> 02:28:44,660
Cause there was, there was a lot of bullshit Atari 2600 games.

3048
02:28:44,660 --> 02:28:50,500
So I, does it really mean any, I guess we'll see, uh, with super, you can see the receipts.

3049
02:28:50,500 --> 02:28:50,660
Yeah.

3050
02:28:50,660 --> 02:28:53,620
I want to see the receipts with superhuman scores.

3051
02:28:53,700 --> 02:28:59,060
Including ones where the AI previously could not beat real players.

3052
02:28:59,940 --> 02:29:04,580
It's a system that remembers promising States and return to those States before it goes

3053
02:29:04,580 --> 02:29:05,460
out exploring.

3054
02:29:07,380 --> 02:29:13,700
It's been improved over older AI, like deep mind, uh, on games like Monzuma's revenge

3055
02:29:13,700 --> 02:29:16,660
and got a near perfect pitfall score.

3056
02:29:16,660 --> 02:29:21,620
Uh, so it's, it's interesting to see there's a full series of tweets on this.

3057
02:29:21,700 --> 02:29:25,940
And if you want to see the user's account, Jeff Klune, uh, is obviously one of the people

3058
02:29:25,940 --> 02:29:26,420
working on it.

3059
02:29:26,420 --> 02:29:28,420
Cause it's his, uh, Twitter account.

3060
02:29:28,420 --> 02:29:33,300
Uh, and he puts in a tweet, go explore now solves all unsolved Atari games.

3061
02:29:33,300 --> 02:29:37,060
Here's a little asterisk with it because it probably won't do beat him and eat him.

3062
02:29:37,060 --> 02:29:38,180
It's just not going to do that.

3063
02:29:38,180 --> 02:29:38,500
Okay.

3064
02:29:38,500 --> 02:29:45,300
It's good, but it might play other games, uh, handles, uh, sto stochastic training throughout

3065
02:29:45,300 --> 02:29:50,660
via goal condition policies, reuses skills to intelligently explore after returning and

3066
02:29:50,660 --> 02:29:54,180
solves hard exploration, simulated robot tasks.

3067
02:29:54,180 --> 02:30:00,260
And so there's a whole bunch of tweets on this and videos that you can see this AI getting

3068
02:30:00,260 --> 02:30:02,500
better and better with Atari 2,600.

3069
02:30:02,500 --> 02:30:06,740
And you know, a lot of those Atari 2,600 games were fairly simple.

3070
02:30:06,740 --> 02:30:12,260
And I think that's what makes this notable is that it's not just doing one thing.

3071
02:30:12,260 --> 02:30:14,740
Well, chess is pretty simple, right?

3072
02:30:14,740 --> 02:30:19,940
And we know there's great chess AI out there, but now AI is evolving into this.

3073
02:30:19,940 --> 02:30:21,940
It can do a variety of things.

3074
02:30:21,940 --> 02:30:26,980
Well, there's still simple relatively, but it has a pattern that it learns from and it

3075
02:30:26,980 --> 02:30:27,780
builds on that.

3076
02:30:28,500 --> 02:30:33,300
And so it's almost one of those things where you have to wonder how much further behind

3077
02:30:33,300 --> 02:30:35,780
are going to be more complicated games.

3078
02:30:35,780 --> 02:30:38,180
How many are going to play eat and hate humanity, right?

3079
02:30:40,580 --> 02:30:45,300
It's going to go, it's going to play ET and then grow sentient and try to destroy humans.

3080
02:30:45,300 --> 02:30:46,180
Why, why not?

3081
02:30:46,180 --> 02:30:46,740
Why not?

3082
02:30:46,740 --> 02:30:48,980
Just, why don't you throw that on 2020 as well?

3083
02:30:48,980 --> 02:30:49,860
How about, how about it?

3084
02:30:49,860 --> 02:30:50,500
Come on.

3085
02:30:50,500 --> 02:30:51,460
Cylon attack.

3086
02:30:51,460 --> 02:30:51,860
Why not?

3087
02:30:55,380 --> 02:30:55,940
There you go.

3088
02:30:55,940 --> 02:30:57,540
I think, I think that's a neat story though.

3089
02:30:58,660 --> 02:31:03,300
The AI stuff is very fascinating and it kind of makes my head hurt, but it's cool stuff.

3090
02:31:04,020 --> 02:31:07,220
So that is it for the news that we had scheduled tonight.

3091
02:31:07,220 --> 02:31:10,820
If you guys have any questions for us, I will open up the listener roundtable for a moment

3092
02:31:10,820 --> 02:31:14,740
in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

3093
02:31:14,740 --> 02:31:17,460
If you have anything you want to ask or any statements you want to make, we'll have a

3094
02:31:17,460 --> 02:31:18,820
quick round table.

3095
02:31:18,820 --> 02:31:21,940
Otherwise I'll check in with Loki to see if there's any last minute stories.

3096
02:31:21,940 --> 02:31:24,340
I kind of feel like I haven't already covered.

3097
02:31:25,220 --> 02:31:28,340
I've got to feel like we covered a lot of the big, it was kind of a, I don't want to

3098
02:31:28,340 --> 02:31:32,420
say it was a slow news week, but it's, it's slowing down because I think people aren't

3099
02:31:32,420 --> 02:31:34,260
working as much or as fast.

3100
02:31:34,260 --> 02:31:40,660
And now, well, I mean the gaming industry in general, in the summer of games festival

3101
02:31:40,660 --> 02:31:46,260
time now, I expect things might pick up in that timeframe where E3 would have been.

3102
02:31:46,260 --> 02:31:50,420
And certainly, you know, for this four month period or whatever, uh, but we're very much

3103
02:31:50,420 --> 02:31:53,540
in a quiet period right now, but I guess things are going to pick up with this week.

3104
02:31:53,540 --> 02:31:54,500
We get the Xbox stuff.

3105
02:31:54,500 --> 02:31:55,780
That's going to be a pretty big deal.

3106
02:31:55,780 --> 02:31:56,260
Yeah.

3107
02:31:56,260 --> 02:31:57,620
So I'm excited to see that.

3108
02:31:57,620 --> 02:31:58,340
Yeah.

3109
02:31:58,340 --> 02:32:01,540
Uh, any, any wishlist game on the new Xbox for you?

3110
02:32:02,900 --> 02:32:04,660
I talk, I keep talking about fable.

3111
02:32:04,660 --> 02:32:05,300
What about for you?

3112
02:32:05,300 --> 02:32:06,660
What would be cool like that?

3113
02:32:06,660 --> 02:32:09,700
I mean, that's really kind of, I'd be interested in fable.

3114
02:32:09,700 --> 02:32:15,300
I don't really know what else I would, maybe they'll bring back cameo.

3115
02:32:15,940 --> 02:32:16,500
I don't know.

3116
02:32:16,500 --> 02:32:20,020
Hey, maybe, maybe, uh, for some motorsport for me.

3117
02:32:20,020 --> 02:32:20,500
Oh yeah.

3118
02:32:20,500 --> 02:32:20,820
I'm sorry.

3119
02:32:20,820 --> 02:32:21,940
Not sorry.

3120
02:32:21,940 --> 02:32:27,140
Forza Horizon for me, not so much motorsport because I don't do the sim games as well as

3121
02:32:27,140 --> 02:32:29,380
I do the arcade games, but I do.

3122
02:32:29,380 --> 02:32:34,420
I realize motorsport is probably going to be first, but that doesn't mean I don't want

3123
02:32:34,420 --> 02:32:38,740
a Forza Horizon game at some point, or at least an arcade eraser type of game.

3124
02:32:39,380 --> 02:32:40,020
That's for sure.

3125
02:32:40,020 --> 02:32:40,580
Yeah.

3126
02:32:40,580 --> 02:32:40,820
Yeah.

3127
02:32:41,620 --> 02:32:45,620
But I, I, I would think fable would be a great thing to come out of the gate with if that

3128
02:32:45,620 --> 02:32:47,220
is something in their sleeve.

3129
02:32:47,220 --> 02:32:49,940
So I would love to see like Forza and fable.

3130
02:32:50,660 --> 02:32:53,940
And I guess Assassin's Creed Valhalla will be a game that they're going to show.

3131
02:32:53,940 --> 02:32:55,060
We already kind of know that.

3132
02:32:55,060 --> 02:32:56,260
So we'll see.

3133
02:32:56,260 --> 02:33:00,180
Oh, the only little bit I did see here real quick as I was browsing through things.

3134
02:33:00,180 --> 02:33:00,420
Yeah.

3135
02:33:00,420 --> 02:33:03,460
Burnout paradise remastereds coming on the switch on June 19th.

3136
02:33:04,340 --> 02:33:05,540
They were 50 bucks for it.

3137
02:33:06,340 --> 02:33:06,580
Yeah.

3138
02:33:06,580 --> 02:33:07,460
I'm not worth it.

3139
02:33:07,460 --> 02:33:08,740
Just buy it on PC for that.

3140
02:33:08,740 --> 02:33:09,780
Like 20 bucks.

3141
02:33:09,780 --> 02:33:10,260
You might want it.

3142
02:33:10,260 --> 02:33:10,660
Well, I don't know.

3143
02:33:10,660 --> 02:33:12,820
Maybe the portability is that important to some people.

3144
02:33:12,820 --> 02:33:15,700
I might, I'm going to, I'm going to wait for a discount.

3145
02:33:15,700 --> 02:33:20,900
I hope, I hope this doesn't cause EA to go see Nintendo sucks.

3146
02:33:20,900 --> 02:33:23,140
Cause our game didn't sell well on there.

3147
02:33:23,140 --> 02:33:23,780
Fuck off.

3148
02:33:25,780 --> 02:33:30,740
To where they think, why isn't there a game from like, I don't even know how old that

3149
02:33:30,740 --> 02:33:33,540
is that like super old already.

3150
02:33:33,540 --> 02:33:38,820
Like was it selling, you know, it's been a few years since the remastered came out and

3151
02:33:39,460 --> 02:33:40,660
now it's coming out on the switch.

3152
02:33:40,660 --> 02:33:41,940
Oh, well, sorry.

3153
02:33:41,940 --> 02:33:43,780
You know, maybe you should have put it out sooner.

3154
02:33:43,780 --> 02:33:44,100
Yeah.

3155
02:33:44,100 --> 02:33:46,740
They need to not set themselves up for disaster.

3156
02:33:46,740 --> 02:33:50,020
Maybe they want to milk the hardest of the hardcore or something.

3157
02:33:50,020 --> 02:33:54,260
I don't know what their logic is first, but if that game doesn't come down in price pretty

3158
02:33:54,260 --> 02:33:56,580
fast, they're, they're not being smart about it.

3159
02:33:56,580 --> 02:33:57,620
So yeah.

3160
02:33:57,620 --> 02:34:00,820
And SGL 100, Matt says, I'm more worried about them saying burnout is dead.

3161
02:34:00,820 --> 02:34:02,340
Why should we make a new one?

3162
02:34:02,340 --> 02:34:05,220
Like look at your idiot launch strategy.

3163
02:34:05,220 --> 02:34:07,140
Maybe go to that first.

3164
02:34:07,140 --> 02:34:07,540
Jeez.

3165
02:34:08,980 --> 02:34:09,620
We'll see.

3166
02:34:09,620 --> 02:34:09,940
All right.

3167
02:34:09,940 --> 02:34:10,500
Anything else?

3168
02:34:11,300 --> 02:34:11,940
That's it.

3169
02:34:11,940 --> 02:34:12,180
All right.

3170
02:34:12,180 --> 02:34:16,020
Well, I think we're going to go ahead and wrap up and call it a night here at orange

3171
02:34:16,020 --> 02:34:16,820
launch radio.

3172
02:34:16,820 --> 02:34:20,180
Hey, thank you guys for tuning into our show, whether you were here live or whether you

3173
02:34:20,180 --> 02:34:21,860
joined us on the podcast feed.

3174
02:34:21,860 --> 02:34:23,140
Really appreciate you being here.

3175
02:34:23,140 --> 02:34:26,980
I know the show felt a little bit off tonight and hopefully I'll be able to tell you more

3176
02:34:27,620 --> 02:34:31,860
later on, but, um, you know, just definitely thinking of a dark soccer and the family right

3177
02:34:31,860 --> 02:34:32,420
now.

3178
02:34:32,420 --> 02:34:35,220
Um, and, uh, hopefully she's back next week.

3179
02:34:35,220 --> 02:34:35,860
I don't know.

3180
02:34:35,860 --> 02:34:36,740
Hard to say.

3181
02:34:36,740 --> 02:34:40,500
Um, but we'll, we'll keep providing a show for you guys to get us through these tough

3182
02:34:40,500 --> 02:34:42,980
times, uh, one way or the other.

3183
02:34:42,980 --> 02:34:46,420
Um, in the meantime, thanks again for tuning in and listening.

3184
02:34:46,420 --> 02:34:49,540
If you liked what you heard here at orange Ontario, please tell a friend about the show.

3185
02:34:49,540 --> 02:34:52,740
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we

3186
02:34:52,740 --> 02:34:54,740
have to have the voices here to hear them.

3187
02:34:54,740 --> 02:34:59,780
Um, so a nice five star review wherever you found this show goes a long way on auto host

3188
02:34:59,780 --> 02:35:00,900
on Twitch or raid.

3189
02:35:00,900 --> 02:35:01,940
I saw raid come in tonight.

3190
02:35:01,940 --> 02:35:02,820
Thank you so much for that.

3191
02:35:02,820 --> 02:35:04,820
Uh, all that type of stuff goes a long way.

3192
02:35:04,980 --> 02:35:06,100
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3193
02:35:06,100 --> 02:35:10,180
Um, for those of you that go the extra mile to support orange on radio, we really appreciate

3194
02:35:10,180 --> 02:35:10,900
you.

3195
02:35:10,900 --> 02:35:14,020
Um, otherwise, Loki, do you have a final thought for us tonight?

3196
02:35:14,980 --> 02:35:16,660
No, that's pretty much it.

3197
02:35:16,660 --> 02:35:20,340
I'm going to try to, uh, try to work on my game this week.

3198
02:35:20,340 --> 02:35:22,260
Cross my fingers, then we'll do it.

3199
02:35:22,900 --> 02:35:25,140
If not, I'll just work on some step mania songs.

3200
02:35:26,180 --> 02:35:30,020
Um, and then my final thought is, um, I know it's almost nine o'clock, but I hope I can

3201
02:35:30,020 --> 02:35:34,500
find a one star raid somewhere nearby, uh, so I can move on in my Pokemon go quests.

3202
02:35:34,900 --> 02:35:38,500
Because the research is limited time, you know, so I got to make sure I finished that

3203
02:35:38,500 --> 02:35:39,540
before wet, like Friday.

3204
02:35:39,540 --> 02:35:44,660
So try to get on that, but I'm glad they're not just doing a gen one event and we get

3205
02:35:44,660 --> 02:35:46,660
gen two next week and gen three the week out.

3206
02:35:46,660 --> 02:35:49,140
Thank gosh for a little diversity of my Pokemans.

3207
02:35:49,140 --> 02:35:50,100
I appreciate that.

3208
02:35:50,740 --> 02:35:54,100
All right, that's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio until next

3209
02:35:54,100 --> 02:35:54,340
week.

3210
02:35:54,900 --> 02:35:57,940
Take care, have fun gaming online.

3211
02:35:57,940 --> 02:36:03,460
Um, stay safe everybody, uh, as more and more States and things start to open up.

3212
02:36:03,460 --> 02:36:10,100
Um, just, you know, listen to doctors, listen to science, be safe, protect yourself, wash

3213
02:36:10,100 --> 02:36:11,620
your hands, all that good stuff.

3214
02:36:12,260 --> 02:36:13,060
Take care of yourself.

3215
02:36:13,060 --> 02:36:14,020
That's the most important thing.

3216
02:36:14,020 --> 02:36:14,980
We'll see you in seven days.

3217
02:36:14,980 --> 02:36:15,300
Goodbye.

3218
02:36:16,260 --> 02:36:18,900
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

3219
02:36:19,540 --> 02:36:25,780
