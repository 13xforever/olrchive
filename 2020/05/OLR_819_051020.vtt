00:00.000 --> 00:18.240
This week, the Internet is outraged on behalf of a talented 9-year-old Fortnite player.

00:18.240 --> 00:21.200
Also this week, the Internet learns about the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act

00:21.200 --> 00:23.140
and more importantly, its exceptions.

00:23.140 --> 00:25.800
This is just one headline in the week's news, stay tuned for the rest, starting right now

00:25.800 --> 00:32.800
on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:32.800 --> 00:36.440
Hello my friends out there on the Internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

00:36.440 --> 00:37.920
every gamer has a voice.

00:37.920 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 819 for this May 10th, 2020.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.280
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm all alone here in the studio, although we would usually all

00:49.280 --> 00:51.240
be here in the same room taping.

00:51.240 --> 00:54.440
As you know, there's a lot of things going on in the world right now that are preventing

00:54.440 --> 00:55.440
that.

00:55.440 --> 00:56.880
A big thanks to the Magic of Discord.

00:56.880 --> 00:58.160
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

00:58.160 --> 00:59.160
Hello.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.160
Hi, Loki.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.360
How are you doing?

01:01.360 --> 01:02.360
I'm fine.

01:02.360 --> 01:03.360
Good, good.

01:03.360 --> 01:08.560
Did you do anything special for Mother's Day for like your wife or your own mom or anything

01:08.560 --> 01:09.560
like that?

01:09.560 --> 01:13.120
I bought her a cake yesterday and then I cooked dinner today.

01:13.120 --> 01:14.560
Oh, well, there you go.

01:14.560 --> 01:15.560
That's very good of you.

01:15.560 --> 01:17.400
I think I saw the picture on Facebook.

01:17.400 --> 01:18.400
Was that today or yesterday?

01:18.400 --> 01:19.400
It was today.

01:19.400 --> 01:20.400
Oh, that looked good.

01:20.400 --> 01:24.680
It was like you did like fried chicken or something, but in the air fryer, right?

01:24.920 --> 01:29.400
Yeah, it's air fryer, honey butter wings.

01:29.400 --> 01:32.040
Oh, you're infamous honey butter, right?

01:32.040 --> 01:33.040
Yes.

01:33.040 --> 01:34.040
Yes.

01:34.040 --> 01:35.040
All right.

01:35.040 --> 01:36.040
Awesome.

01:36.040 --> 01:38.400
I'll come back and talk more about food with you in just a minute.

01:38.400 --> 01:41.880
Not joining us tonight, unfortunately, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:41.880 --> 01:45.280
I do want to quickly let you guys know what's going on.

01:45.280 --> 01:49.840
So last week's show got a little bit weird because Jamie had to leave partway through

01:49.840 --> 01:51.360
the show.

01:51.360 --> 01:55.560
What happened, guys, is that Dark Sakura got word halfway, or not even halfway, probably

01:55.560 --> 02:02.960
like a quarter pounder of the way into the show last week, Dark Sakura got a phone call

02:02.960 --> 02:09.360
that her dad had been admitted into the hospital and was in the emergency area being tested

02:09.360 --> 02:10.360
and so forth.

02:10.360 --> 02:13.480
Unfortunately, I don't have great news to report.

02:13.480 --> 02:19.000
Her father passed away this week and so as you can imagine, she's taking some time off

02:19.000 --> 02:24.720
tonight to handle things and decompress with everything going on.

02:24.720 --> 02:28.980
So obviously we're sending our best wishes and so forth to Dark Sakura.

02:28.980 --> 02:33.120
It's definitely not an easy thing to be going through, especially with everything else that's

02:33.120 --> 02:35.480
going on in the world.

02:35.480 --> 02:39.200
So yeah, I did get her permission to tell you all that, that that had happened.

02:39.200 --> 02:43.120
I think it would be okay for me to as well tell you it was not COVID related because

02:43.120 --> 02:44.120
I think that's good.

02:44.120 --> 02:48.440
I think just in this day and age, that is going to be a curiosity that happens, although

02:48.440 --> 02:50.820
that was a scare.

02:50.820 --> 02:56.260
Anytime you're in the hospital and you're showing certain symptoms, that is something

02:56.260 --> 03:01.880
that they're looking at, but I felt it appropriate to say it's not that, but I will let Dark

03:01.880 --> 03:03.240
Sakura give more details.

03:03.240 --> 03:08.000
If she wants to, which she's under no obligation to do, when she returns to the show, be it

03:08.000 --> 03:12.220
next week, the week after, however much time she needs.

03:12.220 --> 03:18.020
So I know it's a tremendously difficult thing to go through with losing a parent.

03:18.020 --> 03:23.980
So yeah, I'm just thinking of her and I'm sure we all are in chat and so forth right

03:23.980 --> 03:24.980
now.

03:24.980 --> 03:30.140
So yeah, I just wanted to let you know why last week's show got a little weird there

03:30.140 --> 03:37.260
in the middle and why Jamie's not here tonight and we'll come back whenever she pleases.

03:37.260 --> 03:42.980
So moving on, because we do try to do this show to take our minds off of all the craziness

03:42.980 --> 03:48.940
going on in the real world, be it personal tragedy or the tragedy that is seemingly surrounding

03:48.940 --> 03:52.300
us in the globe every day with what's going on in the world.

03:52.300 --> 03:58.460
I know a lot of us run to our Animal Crossing towns to escape what's going on.

03:58.460 --> 03:59.460
I don't blame you.

03:59.460 --> 04:01.260
I'm very similar in this day and age.

04:01.260 --> 04:06.040
So with that being said, let's use video games as an escape for a little bit.

04:06.040 --> 04:10.040
Let's talk about some big gaming news and some things to look forward to amongst all

04:10.040 --> 04:15.720
this this year, starting with our kickoff tonight, talking about the Xbox Series X event.

04:15.720 --> 04:22.160
So Loki, last week on the show, we set some, I guess, not so great expectations for the

04:22.160 --> 04:23.160
event.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.160
Yeah.

04:24.160 --> 04:29.560
So, well, you know, and why the summer of gaming is stretched out for four months because

04:29.560 --> 04:31.640
they're stretching out the news for four months.

04:31.640 --> 04:32.980
Well, here's the thing, too.

04:32.980 --> 04:37.400
And I don't know if it was said before we had taped last week or after that it was going

04:37.400 --> 04:39.660
to be all third party.

04:39.660 --> 04:43.420
Sorry, we missed the memo and didn't get to relay that during the show.

04:43.420 --> 04:45.660
So, you know, if that was before the show, then our bad.

04:45.660 --> 04:46.660
We missed it.

04:46.660 --> 04:49.340
There's a lot of information about the event going around.

04:49.340 --> 04:54.660
And so but I do think we'd also said, you know, set your expectations at a reasonable

04:54.660 --> 04:55.660
level.

04:55.660 --> 04:56.660
It's May.

04:56.660 --> 04:59.440
So like, you know, I'm going to be completely honest.

04:59.440 --> 05:04.800
I kind of clicked through the event because I forgot it was at 8 a.m.

05:04.800 --> 05:08.480
Usually these types of things are at like noon my time because being on the West Coast,

05:08.480 --> 05:12.980
I can usually, you know, I don't have to worry about like sleeping right through it or something.

05:12.980 --> 05:19.600
So I was distracted with day job work stuff and I had no idea, none, that it had even

05:19.600 --> 05:21.780
happened until it was already over.

05:21.780 --> 05:24.120
So I kind of ended up going like clicking through it.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.120
And that that was the point.

05:25.120 --> 05:31.080
I kind of heard, well, it was kind of just a bunch of third party trailers.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.080
Did you watch it, Loki?

05:32.080 --> 05:33.760
Was that what you walked away with?

05:33.760 --> 05:35.300
I did watch it.

05:35.300 --> 05:37.660
And there was some interesting things there.

05:37.660 --> 05:42.000
But like the I mean, they came out first.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.840
They said, OK, you know, we've heard the Internet, you guys giving us a hard time about gameplay

05:46.840 --> 05:47.840
trailers.

05:47.840 --> 05:50.960
Well, we tell we're telling you now they're gameplay trailers.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.940
And then they show what your trailers are gameplay.

05:52.940 --> 05:57.620
So it's like, guys, what are you doing?

05:57.620 --> 06:00.100
So they had some interesting things.

06:00.100 --> 06:06.200
I mean, I really enjoyed like some of the trailers they had for what was it?

06:06.200 --> 06:10.140
That one medium that looked pretty awesome.

06:10.140 --> 06:15.020
The game, the medium, which basically looked like a spiritual successor to Silent Hill

06:15.020 --> 06:18.320
by the folks that I was like, is that even the one that the kiriyama is like actually

06:18.320 --> 06:19.320
involved with?

06:19.320 --> 06:20.320
Yes, he is.

06:20.320 --> 06:26.520
Silent Hill, like I hear a kiriyama is the silent hill.

06:26.520 --> 06:30.980
So that one is by the makers of the Blair Witch and the Observer.

06:30.980 --> 06:33.520
So Blair Witch is pretty good.

06:33.520 --> 06:39.700
And then there was Scorn, which I have no idea what that was.

06:39.700 --> 06:43.720
Some horror game looks like, you know, was H.R.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.680
Geiger or something like that.

06:45.680 --> 06:46.920
And that looked kind of weird.

06:46.920 --> 06:47.920
Maybe that's chorus.

06:47.920 --> 06:48.920
I don't know.

06:48.920 --> 06:54.100
There's a lot of these games that were kind of similar overall.

06:54.100 --> 06:57.580
I thought it was pretty good.

06:57.580 --> 07:02.260
Didn't really care so much about Madden stuff, but whatever.

07:02.260 --> 07:06.420
And then, of course, Assassin's Creed, I was really hoping to see some actual gameplay,

07:06.420 --> 07:11.100
but of course not.

07:11.100 --> 07:13.300
I don't know the new Yakuza game.

07:13.300 --> 07:17.280
I guess I got to get into the Yakuza series because it looked pretty awesome.

07:17.280 --> 07:18.280
Like a dragon.

07:18.280 --> 07:19.280
Yeah.

07:19.280 --> 07:22.420
And just quickly about the gameplay, because that seemed to be the recurring theme from

07:22.420 --> 07:23.420
a lot of people.

07:23.420 --> 07:26.240
And you kind of hit on that, you know, with what you said earlier, that most people were

07:26.240 --> 07:30.100
hoping like this is going to be the chance to see some gameplay.

07:30.100 --> 07:33.000
And it really like wasn't gameplay like, OK, sure.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.620
There might have been like three seconds of gameplay in engine footage, whatever.

07:36.620 --> 07:37.620
OK, like.

07:37.620 --> 07:38.620
Yeah.

07:38.620 --> 07:39.620
Right.

07:39.620 --> 07:43.100
And it was really it was funny because Bobby went into this on his show tonight because

07:43.100 --> 07:45.140
I haven't given this line out yet during the show.

07:45.140 --> 07:48.700
We do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the

07:48.700 --> 07:53.400
voice of Geeks Network, Twitch dot excuse me, have the hiccups, twitch dot TV slash

07:53.400 --> 07:57.460
Vogue Network at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black

07:57.460 --> 07:58.460
Wolf show.

07:58.460 --> 08:00.560
And Bobby on his show tonight was talking about this.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.720
And I thought it was funny because he kind of went through some of the footage and he

08:02.720 --> 08:06.140
actually like blew up the little disclaimer that was at the bottom of the screen that

08:06.140 --> 08:09.800
kind of talks about how, you know, it's very typical, you know, what you see in trailers.

08:09.800 --> 08:11.640
Like, you know, the game footage is not final.

08:11.640 --> 08:16.420
It's, you know, all, you know, prior what they expect it to look like and all this stuff.

08:16.420 --> 08:21.280
So it's it was kind of rendered preview things.

08:21.280 --> 08:25.480
It just didn't look like people were actually playing these games.

08:25.480 --> 08:28.740
You know, it just looked like, oh, they're they're either rendering these cinematics

08:28.740 --> 08:32.340
and in engine or there's a lot of shooty shooty bang bang.

08:32.340 --> 08:36.100
But it's very scripted and reacting a lot faster than a person actually playing it would

08:36.100 --> 08:38.620
be doing and so forth.

08:38.620 --> 08:44.400
But, you know, considering that the line is getting more and more blurred and there was

08:44.400 --> 08:45.400
an interesting take.

08:45.400 --> 08:50.260
I was reading online about this, about how, you know, part of the reason why maybe we're

08:50.260 --> 08:54.940
not feeling it so much with, you know, what we saw this week is that, you know, when the

08:54.940 --> 09:00.220
graphics went up from Nintendo to Super Nintendo, huge jump when they went up from Super Nintendo

09:00.220 --> 09:04.260
to the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation era, the first 3D era.

09:04.260 --> 09:05.260
That was huge.

09:05.260 --> 09:07.080
It was a huge jump in graphics, right?

09:07.080 --> 09:08.900
Like, oh, my God, 3D, right?

09:08.900 --> 09:12.880
And then going from the PlayStation one of the PlayStation two, that was a huge upgrade,

09:12.880 --> 09:16.360
you know, DVD and all the extra stuff that could be stored with that PlayStation two

09:16.360 --> 09:17.400
to PlayStation three.

09:17.400 --> 09:23.400
That was a pretty big jump, three to four, a minor jump, not as big of a jump, but still

09:23.400 --> 09:24.400
a noticeable jump.

09:24.400 --> 09:25.400
Right.

09:25.400 --> 09:31.080
You know, more HD stuff and more is 60 frames a second and things like that.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.580
OK, so you notice every now they're going from four to five.

09:33.580 --> 09:37.980
It's almost like we're pushing the limits of what our eyes can actually see, that it's

09:37.980 --> 09:41.500
just like that graphical improvement isn't there.

09:41.500 --> 09:47.100
So it's almost like we need to know what are the other bells and whistles.

09:47.100 --> 09:49.440
Because the graphics aren't doing it anymore.

09:49.440 --> 09:55.060
And I think that's why this particular reveal event was a struggle, because it's harder

09:55.060 --> 09:56.540
to ooh and aah at the graphics.

09:56.540 --> 09:58.180
I mean, yes, it looks good.

09:58.180 --> 10:03.100
I thought it was, yeah, the graphics were fine, but like there's I just wanted to see

10:03.100 --> 10:08.140
more like gameplay, like what these games are, because there's some like I don't even

10:08.140 --> 10:11.260
know what what this game is like.

10:11.260 --> 10:14.660
It's hard for me to understand what exactly it is that I'm going to be playing, whereas

10:14.660 --> 10:18.720
like some of them, like the Yakuza stuff, at least that I have a pretty good idea.

10:18.720 --> 10:21.900
And I know that like, OK, those cutscenes are actually in game and stuff.

10:21.900 --> 10:23.620
But like, I don't know.

10:23.620 --> 10:28.340
And just the fact that, you know, OK, I don't think this was a bomb or, you know, horrible.

10:28.340 --> 10:30.580
Like it was not like the Xbox one reveal.

10:30.580 --> 10:32.740
OK, that was a disaster.

10:32.740 --> 10:34.700
This was this wasn't a disaster.

10:34.700 --> 10:41.700
This was just kind of like, OK, or maybe or like maybe an overall meh, but with a couple

10:41.700 --> 10:43.220
minutes of oh, neat.

10:43.220 --> 10:46.700
For example, the Xbox is getting a new Yakuza game.

10:46.700 --> 10:47.700
Oh, neat.

10:47.700 --> 10:48.900
You know, that was OK.

10:48.900 --> 10:53.300
So that's kind of neat, you know, or oh, the Silent Hill folks are working on a new game

10:53.300 --> 10:54.300
for Xbox.

10:54.300 --> 10:55.300
Oh, OK, neat.

10:55.300 --> 10:58.560
You know, but we just didn't really get to see the gameplay, but at least it did have

10:58.560 --> 11:02.520
those few moments of, oh, neat, right?

11:02.520 --> 11:08.040
But I think when the first party reveal happens and we start to do the real deep dive into

11:08.040 --> 11:11.840
this new Xbox Series X, I think that's when it's going to have to be a little more than

11:11.840 --> 11:13.040
just, oh, neat.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.320
It's going to have to be, oh, I want that.

11:15.320 --> 11:16.320
I'm going to preorder that.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.320
You know what I mean?

11:18.320 --> 11:19.320
Yeah, definitely.

11:19.320 --> 11:23.520
I mean, there's some games, you know, that were like, oh, that's pretty cool.

11:23.520 --> 11:27.840
So far, like then, of course, they said, OK, well, we're going to have another event later

11:27.840 --> 11:28.840
on in July.

11:28.840 --> 11:35.880
And it's like, fine, I guess, just wait for all that stuff in July.

11:35.880 --> 11:40.720
I'm trying to find some comments from our chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

11:40.720 --> 11:47.960
Bonds 006 says HDR 2 and 4K, bleeding edge graphics is OK, but gameplay is better.

11:47.960 --> 11:51.640
Something else to consider with 4K, too, is just how many games are we actually going

11:51.640 --> 11:52.640
to see with it?

11:52.640 --> 11:56.800
Because 4K is going to be a beast for those artists to make those types of textures.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.480
Like there's there's a limit.

11:58.520 --> 12:01.960
I think that that's pretty typical nowadays in the PC space.

12:01.960 --> 12:04.560
So I think everyone's kind of used to it already.

12:04.560 --> 12:08.160
And one of the things I did like, though, was they were talking about that smart delivery.

12:08.160 --> 12:15.280
So that's that thing where if you buy, say, you know, Census Creed Valhalla on Xbox One,

12:15.280 --> 12:18.400
you also get the free upgrade to the Series X.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.760
And vice versa.

12:19.760 --> 12:21.580
Honestly, that's exciting.

12:21.580 --> 12:25.920
And I think it's one of those things where now like backwards compatibility becomes almost

12:25.920 --> 12:28.960
more important when trying to sell your new console.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.960
And I think that's why Sony is much more on board with it this time.

12:31.960 --> 12:35.480
And, you know, Microsoft's definitely making it a piece of what they're saying, too.

12:35.480 --> 12:39.880
But there's also a lot of people out there that are like, I don't think I really need

12:39.880 --> 12:44.560
an Xbox Series X because I'm going to play all these games on PC.

12:44.560 --> 12:48.120
Is that really a loss for Microsoft?

12:48.120 --> 12:49.240
I don't think so.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.800
I don't know if all these games will be on PC.

12:51.800 --> 12:55.480
I mean, a lot of them will be, but well, it's hard to everything is going to be the third

12:55.480 --> 12:56.480
party stuff.

12:56.480 --> 12:57.480
It's hard to say.

12:57.480 --> 12:58.480
Fair.

12:58.480 --> 13:01.640
But we know the first party Microsoft stuff all will be like they've said that as much

13:01.640 --> 13:03.120
like Halo is going to be on PC.

13:03.120 --> 13:04.720
They're all going to be on PC.

13:04.720 --> 13:10.960
So you know, I think it just depends on what the specs are to get in the run the way that

13:10.960 --> 13:16.000
they do, because like, I mean, I have a pretty new laptop, so I'm hoping that that stuff

13:16.000 --> 13:17.480
should run really well.

13:17.480 --> 13:20.200
But I mean, eventually at some point it's not.

13:20.200 --> 13:27.560
So I need to see what I need to have it run at the speed that they know it should run

13:27.560 --> 13:28.560
or whatever.

13:28.560 --> 13:29.560
Just.

13:29.560 --> 13:32.200
But yeah, I mean, that that was the thing is like, well, I don't know if I really need

13:32.200 --> 13:37.240
to necessarily buy an Xbox because I can just have a PC.

13:37.240 --> 13:38.240
I don't know.

13:38.240 --> 13:42.200
Maybe the games pass and stuff, you know, the ad.

13:42.200 --> 13:45.160
I mean, that's just that's going to be a big part of it as well.

13:45.160 --> 13:48.840
So you're going to have three generations of systems where they have games for it.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.800
I do think I do think games pass is great.

13:51.800 --> 13:53.000
And I've said that on the show before.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.400
I think the one place the game pass could improve is that they do have such a robust

13:57.400 --> 14:02.520
library of Xbox 360 and original Xbox games that could be on that service, but for whatever

14:02.520 --> 14:07.720
reason aren't and especially first party Microsoft titles, you know, so maybe they're just drip

14:07.720 --> 14:08.200
feeding it.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.320
Maybe we'll see more.

14:09.320 --> 14:09.800
I don't know.

14:09.800 --> 14:12.840
But, you know, Xbox game pass, I think I'm a big fan of that.

14:12.840 --> 14:17.560
And to see what how that's going to impact, you know, the next generation of Xbox, I want

14:17.560 --> 14:19.240
to get some more comments from chat.

14:19.240 --> 14:25.000
Bonds 006 says graphic porn does not make up for a lackluster game design, bland gameplay,

14:25.000 --> 14:26.040
shoddy AI.

14:26.040 --> 14:30.840
And yeah, this this trailer binge that we got, we couldn't really see any of that other

14:30.840 --> 14:31.240
stuff.

14:31.240 --> 14:35.480
Not that, you know, events are really going to clue you in if the game has shoddy AI or

14:35.480 --> 14:35.880
not.

14:35.880 --> 14:39.080
But still, I think a lot of us like to see the gameplay to see what's it really going

14:39.080 --> 14:40.520
to look like when we get our hands on it.

14:41.160 --> 14:45.800
Fifth Dream Today says the fast loading, the smaller download sizes, the 3D sound chip.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.240
I'm already sold.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.840
So very true.

14:50.600 --> 14:51.080
Let's see.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.480
Johnny Woofay talking about ray tracing.

14:53.480 --> 14:57.160
New killer instinct with ray tracing would be amazing.

14:57.160 --> 15:01.480
So yeah, ray tracing, obviously a big part of the next generation of gaming.

15:01.480 --> 15:04.680
And I know my current PC, my current video card can't really handle it.

15:04.680 --> 15:07.400
So, you know, that may be something I'll have to go to.

15:07.400 --> 15:11.800
Either I got to improve my video card or I'll have to go to an Xbox Series X to experience

15:11.800 --> 15:12.200
that.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.160
We'll see what happens.

15:14.920 --> 15:17.000
You know, something else this event kind of made me think of, you know,

15:17.000 --> 15:23.240
again, guys, it's May, you know, and usually this type of binge doesn't start till June.

15:23.240 --> 15:27.080
And with everything going on in the world, I don't think many of us would be surprised

15:27.080 --> 15:29.160
if it's delayed a little bit past early June.

15:29.160 --> 15:34.120
The E3, I'm using my quoting fingers, time frame that we would usually see these events

15:34.120 --> 15:34.600
in.

15:34.600 --> 15:40.680
But, you know, let's imagine, as I'm sure many of you have been doing these past few

15:40.680 --> 15:44.280
months, let's imagine COVID, Corona had never happened.

15:44.280 --> 15:46.680
Let's imagine this whole pandemic never happened.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.840
I know, it's hard to do.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.200
And then we had E3 like usual.

15:52.840 --> 15:57.640
I think you would see Microsoft coming out on stage and, you know, talking about their

15:57.640 --> 15:58.040
new system.

15:58.040 --> 16:02.200
They're only going to have an hour and a half or two hours and they've got to fit in, you

16:02.200 --> 16:06.280
know, their system and all the reasons why you should upgrade to the new system as well

16:06.280 --> 16:09.800
as announcing their own games and games you should be looking forward to.

16:10.360 --> 16:16.040
I think a lot of this stuff we saw in the inside Xbox would have been relegated to that

16:16.040 --> 16:18.440
third party sizzle wheel, right?

16:18.440 --> 16:19.880
Y'all know what I'm talking about, right?

16:19.880 --> 16:21.560
Yeah, the sizzle reel.

16:21.560 --> 16:25.320
I mean, a lot of them like see a lot of the games are like, oh, is this this?

16:25.320 --> 16:26.600
Because I thought it was something else.

16:26.600 --> 16:30.360
Like, for example, Vampire the Masquerade originally when they were showing that I was

16:30.360 --> 16:33.960
like, oh, is this Bioshock in a new Bioshock?

16:33.960 --> 16:36.040
And it's like, oh, no, it's Vampire, which is fine.

16:36.040 --> 16:37.480
I mean, I guess that game is pretty good.

16:37.480 --> 16:43.000
And that's not to say they won't show third party games still at the big event, whatever,

16:43.000 --> 16:44.440
you know, the virtual event they end up doing.

16:44.520 --> 16:46.920
That's not to say they won't, like, if there is a new Bioshock, that's not to say they

16:46.920 --> 16:47.800
won't show that.

16:47.800 --> 16:51.720
But I think these particular games that got shown were probably the things that would

16:51.720 --> 16:53.800
have been relegated to the sizzle reel.

16:53.800 --> 16:59.080
And now it's a little bit of a win-win situation when that they get that time back that would

16:59.080 --> 17:00.760
have gone to the sizzle reel, right?

17:00.760 --> 17:02.920
So we can see something else at the show.

17:02.920 --> 17:05.880
And B, you didn't just get a sizzle reel.

17:05.880 --> 17:11.000
You got much more content from these third parties and you got, you know, to see more

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
of, you know, these games for better or for worse with the rendered trailers and so forth.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.160
So I just I think this was the supersized sizzle trailer.

17:19.160 --> 17:23.240
I just think that they should be really careful with what they're calling gameplay.

17:23.240 --> 17:29.480
Like if it's in engine footage or something like that, that's fine, because especially

17:29.480 --> 17:35.240
Ubisoft, I mean, we're talking about not just a few years ago, we had the whole debacle

17:35.240 --> 17:41.320
over Watch Dogs where they showed stuff that ended up being, you know, downgraded when

17:41.320 --> 17:45.960
the full retail version came out or Aliens Colonial Marines, you know, remember that

17:45.960 --> 17:50.600
whole thing where none of the footage even resembled the final game when it came out.

17:50.600 --> 17:54.440
So it's it's we need to be very careful with that.

17:54.440 --> 17:58.200
A lot of people in chat and I know it came up on Bobby show as well, not to rehash things

17:58.200 --> 18:03.800
too much, but the Killzone PS3 debacle and how the target rendered footage that they

18:03.800 --> 18:06.840
showed at the event didn't even match what ended up happening.

18:06.840 --> 18:09.000
That's been talked about quite a bit tonight.

18:09.000 --> 18:14.680
And I get it. It's still early, but don't don't one, call it a gameplay trailer and

18:14.680 --> 18:20.120
two, don't have another like a brief moment before all the trailers say, hey, we get it,

18:20.120 --> 18:23.720
you guys, you know, you come down on us when we call this stuff gameplay and it's not.

18:23.720 --> 18:27.960
But we promise you it's gameplay like don't have that before all of this.

18:27.960 --> 18:32.440
If it's not going to be that like, I don't understand why you set yourself up even more.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.040
Yeah, that was a weird, weird setup.

18:35.880 --> 18:39.640
I mean, I don't know. It's just it's weird. Like without the UI and stuff on there,

18:39.640 --> 18:43.800
it's just it doesn't look right. And I get it like there's like cut scenes and stuff like that.

18:43.800 --> 18:51.080
They're rendered in game, but. I don't know if it's all cut scenes is kind of ridiculous.

18:51.080 --> 18:55.800
OK, this comment is too good. I have to read it. This is about you and that vampire trailer.

18:56.440 --> 19:00.600
Bobby Black Wolf says, Q up the is this anime butterfly meme?

19:00.600 --> 19:04.360
Loki is the anime boy. Vampire is the butterfly. Is this Bioshock?

19:06.600 --> 19:10.600
It's good. It's like it's like when he had like the guy like stringing up the people

19:10.600 --> 19:14.600
in the house and stuff like that, I was like, oh, OK, that kind of looks like a splicer or

19:14.600 --> 19:19.640
something like that. You've all done it. We've all done it. I'm I'm I'm positive because, you know,

19:19.640 --> 19:25.320
if you if you can go back to last year's E3, if you happen to be a subscriber of Vogue Network

19:25.320 --> 19:29.400
here at Twitch, Wink, Wink, Nudge, Nudge, you can go back into the video footage and look at

19:29.400 --> 19:33.480
everything. And I don't I don't remember if Bobby and I were commentating on like a Microsoft event

19:33.480 --> 19:38.040
or it was the Square event. But I know that there was like a trailer that came up and I'm like,

19:38.040 --> 19:40.600
oh, this looks like such and such. And it totally wasn't.

19:41.720 --> 19:46.520
You know, and that or and then I was like, thought that was a Forza Horizon game. I'm like,

19:47.320 --> 19:53.160
I mean, it's heavily inspired by it. You know, it looks it. I don't know.

19:53.880 --> 20:00.200
You know, and look, look, I can openly admit it because you all do it with video games, too.

20:00.200 --> 20:04.280
And it happens with movie trailers. So it's not it's not just games where this happens.

20:04.280 --> 20:07.640
You've totally seen movie trailers and a person will show up and you'll be like,

20:07.640 --> 20:10.680
is this the trailer for a new Marvel thing? Oh, no, it's not.

20:12.680 --> 20:16.840
It's it's a rip off or something like that. Or is this the new Pixar movie? Oh, no, no,

20:16.840 --> 20:21.320
it's not Pixar. It's something like that. Is this the new Iron Man? Oh, that's Dr. Doolittle.

20:23.720 --> 20:30.200
Exactly. You've all done it in the movie theater. Come on. So, yeah. But anyway, I again,

20:30.200 --> 20:37.320
the event wasn't bad. It just was kind of like, oh, that wasn't really gameplay. All right.

20:37.320 --> 20:44.680
So we're really looking forward to your I guess now July event instead. So now it'll be just

20:44.680 --> 20:49.400
what's interesting to see through all this, of course, is how is Sony going to play this?

20:49.400 --> 20:53.960
Because we still don't know. Does Sony plan to do something in June when E3 would have been?

20:53.960 --> 20:57.320
Is Sony going to wait for July? Because as we've talked about on the show before,

20:58.200 --> 21:05.080
Microsoft pulled out the switch two months before it released. So hypothetically, if consoles aren't

21:05.080 --> 21:11.880
releasing until November, we may not hear anything until September. Nintendo pulled out the switch.

21:12.600 --> 21:19.480
They did. They said Microsoft. Oh, God. All right. Sorry. It's been a long, long seven weeks.

21:20.280 --> 21:23.960
So, yes, Nintendo pulled out the switch. Sorry. With only like two months to go,

21:23.960 --> 21:27.160
because it was like early January. And granted, the holidays come into that and everything.

21:27.160 --> 21:31.800
But still, and the switch sold like cuckoo bananas because they had all the right games for it and

21:31.800 --> 21:38.680
the right things to say. So you don't need five or six months of lead time. Unless maybe you're

21:38.680 --> 21:45.080
trying to collect all those preorders. I don't know. But Nintendo kind of changed the games in

21:45.080 --> 21:49.480
many ways with the switch's launch. You don't have to launch a console for the holidays. You

21:49.480 --> 21:54.120
don't have to launch a console with six months lead time and you can still be successful. So

21:55.400 --> 22:02.280
we'll see. Anyway, I'm still excited for Xbox Series X. I'm sure the July event is going to

22:02.280 --> 22:07.960
be great. I'm excited for Sony's event as well. And I'm excited for Nintendo to announce what

22:07.960 --> 22:12.680
their plan looks like for the rest of the year. I just really like games. So I just...

22:13.560 --> 22:17.640
You ever go on Twitter and look like... And I'm telling you, actually, don't do this.

22:18.280 --> 22:22.360
But have you ever made the mistake of going on Twitter and looking at an Xbox tweet and looking

22:22.360 --> 22:28.600
at the reply and it's all Sony fanboys saying really mean things? Or you go to a Sony tweet

22:28.600 --> 22:33.960
and you look at all the replies and it's Microsoft fanboys saying very mean things. I'm so tired.

22:34.600 --> 22:40.120
Y'all, it's 2020 and I'm tired. Like, just stop. Stop fighting.

22:40.120 --> 22:43.400
We don't have sports teams to root for right now, so we have to root for the console wars.

22:43.400 --> 22:49.640
It's so disturbing. And I know, Rob, don't read the comments. You're right. I should know better.

22:49.640 --> 22:58.120
I can't help it. Sometimes you click and... God, I saw it. So anyway. Yeah. And then Bobby says,

22:58.120 --> 23:02.600
and you go to a Nintendo tweet and it's all Nintendo fanboys saying mean things.

23:02.600 --> 23:08.280
Where is our direct, et cetera? Yeah, no. Tea. It's true. Nintendo kind of fights themselves,

23:08.280 --> 23:13.080
don't they? It's been 26 days since a Nintendo Direct. I'm dying.

23:15.240 --> 23:18.680
Orange right in chat says, have you ever made the mistake of going on Twitter?

23:20.120 --> 23:26.120
You know, there's a lot of good and bad on Twitter. I've had a pretty darn good experience

23:26.120 --> 23:31.560
on Twitter. I've met a lot of great people on Twitter. I heavily curate my Twitter experience

23:32.120 --> 23:37.560
and I heavily choose who I follow. I have two different layers of followers. I do. Yes,

23:37.560 --> 23:42.920
I follow like 1600 people on Twitter. I do. Not nearly that many of them are active. I've also

23:42.920 --> 23:46.920
been on Twitter for 10 years and there's a lot of accounts that ain't tweeting anymore. Sure.

23:47.960 --> 23:52.600
Here's the thing. I'm going to tell you my steps to how to stay on top of a 1600 follower list.

23:52.600 --> 23:58.040
Number one, the minute I follow you, I disable your retweets. Number one,

23:58.680 --> 24:01.640
that's just been a policy. Like I'm not interested in retweets.

24:01.640 --> 24:07.800
I'm interested. Yeah, we can do that. Oh yeah. You go follow and you click on the dots on a

24:07.800 --> 24:12.200
person's profile and you can disable their retweets. And if I see any retweets come in

24:12.200 --> 24:15.880
my timeline where it's like, I forgot, because sometimes if somebody has a protected account,

24:16.600 --> 24:19.960
you can't do that right away. So if I see a retweet come in my timeline,

24:19.960 --> 24:23.560
especially if it's something I really don't care about, I go to your profile and I hide retweets.

24:23.560 --> 24:28.760
No, retweets I'm fine with. That's right. It's the likes that I want to stop getting in my team.

24:28.760 --> 24:32.120
Yeah, those don't... Well, when you follow as many people as I do...

24:32.120 --> 24:40.040
Everybody be thirsty out there and like... It's true. Don't go to the curated timeline

24:40.040 --> 24:43.880
because you see a lot more of it there. You have to go to the actual chronological timeline.

24:44.680 --> 24:52.760
And then the other Twitter trick is, well, quote tweets you can't really do anything about. And

24:52.760 --> 24:56.280
that's the one that's starting to become a pain. But a lot of times the things people say are

24:56.280 --> 25:02.440
funny, so okay. But the other very, very important thing is lists. And that's the other thing.

25:02.440 --> 25:09.000
So I have an invisible list and you don't know if you're on it or not of about 40-ish people.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
And that's the one I actually read with regularity and kind of stay current on.

25:13.800 --> 25:18.120
And then it's like one of those, if I'm bored or I'm not doing anything right now,

25:18.120 --> 25:21.800
I'm doing that whole lying in bed and I really shouldn't be on my phone, but I am.

25:21.800 --> 25:28.840
Then I scroll through the big timeline and read all the 1600 thing crap. And then if you're

25:28.840 --> 25:34.440
tweeting a bunch of bullshit, I don't want to see, I just mute you. Sorry. But especially...

25:34.440 --> 25:41.800
Oh my God, the automated stuff. That's a mute. I feel like Grandpa Simpson. That's a paddling.

25:43.240 --> 25:46.920
Every sponsored tweet I see, I blocked the account.

25:47.880 --> 25:52.600
You have a robot that says how many people followed you today. That's a mute. You tweet

25:52.600 --> 25:59.880
too damn much about politics. That's a mute. You just, the automated tweets are the things that

25:59.880 --> 26:08.840
really bother me. That's a mutant. So that's how I see it. That's a mutant. And that's how I stay

26:08.840 --> 26:15.400
on top of things. Bobby Blackwell says Rob mutes VOG network confirmed. No, I don't mute our own

26:15.400 --> 26:21.960
stuff. And here's the thing with that. At least it's like, and I actually don't mute the people

26:21.960 --> 26:25.560
that say I'm going live on Twitch and all that. I don't mute that. That's not what I'm talking

26:25.560 --> 26:31.560
about. I'm talking about the one that says I have five new followers today and three people

26:31.560 --> 26:37.800
unfollowed me. Thank you so much to dah, dah, dah for whatever website for the stats or thanks

26:37.800 --> 26:43.960
at so-and-so for the follow. Thanks at so-and-so like they have a robot thing that tweets every

26:43.960 --> 26:49.240
time somebody follows them. That's a mutant. But if somebody, like I follow a lot of other

26:49.240 --> 26:52.280
Twitch streamers, let's be real. And if they tweet, hi, I'm going live on Twitch and I'm

26:52.280 --> 26:56.680
going to be playing something such and such tonight. Like our, like our pal, Jeff.

26:58.360 --> 27:03.080
I follow him. I don't, I don't mute him. He tweets a lot of funny shit too. And I actually really

27:03.080 --> 27:08.040
enjoy his clips from Twitch. So I don't mute that, you know? So I don't, no, I do not mute VOG

27:08.040 --> 27:15.080
network, but I do mute, especially when like you have no other content. Anyway, one other

27:15.080 --> 27:19.320
Twitter trick, I know you're getting burned out on this, but now I'm on a roll. I don't follow

27:19.320 --> 27:26.600
everyone back automatically. Most people I do, but here's my trick because there's so many robots

27:26.600 --> 27:32.440
out there on Twitter nowadays. I assess your account in five minutes or five seconds to try

27:32.440 --> 27:37.160
to figure out if you're a real person or not. And here's my criteria. I go to your page and I click

27:37.160 --> 27:45.160
on your media tab. If I see, and I scroll for three seconds. If I see a selfie of you, I know

27:45.160 --> 27:49.560
you're a real person and I'll follow you back or some other type of picture that obviously came

27:49.560 --> 27:56.200
from a cell phone camera. I follow back. If I see a lot of interaction with accounts and gifts,

27:56.200 --> 28:00.600
then I kind of try to feel out, okay, is this content that I'm going to like? Then I'll probably

28:00.600 --> 28:08.040
follow back. If it's empty, there's nothing there in your media tab, I don't follow back

28:09.240 --> 28:16.520
because that is almost a sure sign of a bot account. So that's, anyway, I'm not perfect

28:16.520 --> 28:20.840
a hundred percent of the time. So please don't walk away from this. If you followed me on Twitter

28:20.840 --> 28:24.920
and I never followed you back with a tear, why won't Rob Roberts follow me on Twitter?

28:25.960 --> 28:30.280
It's not a perfect system and Twitter doesn't always alert me when people follow me. So I

28:30.280 --> 28:35.640
miss it sometimes. But anytime somebody asks me or responds to something or likes something

28:35.640 --> 28:38.520
and I'm not following them, I usually go and I see they're following me. I'm like,

28:38.520 --> 28:42.520
why am I not following this person? And so just like one of my tweets and I'll usually catch it.

28:42.520 --> 28:49.480
So anyway, a Tiger Clawed Chat says, good thing Rob at least follows members of the community

28:49.480 --> 28:54.760
because we post good content. Yes, I follow people. Quest Buster says, these Twitter tips

28:54.760 --> 28:58.840
are gold. You're welcome, I guess. I've been on Twitter a long, long time and I've just kind of

28:58.840 --> 29:04.920
picked up that stuff. Tiger Clawed says, I think Travis Donovan's Twitter does that sometimes.

29:05.960 --> 29:11.320
There's certain people I will let slide and Grandpa Donovan is one of them. Don't tell him.

29:11.320 --> 29:17.720
But even if he uses a robot, I don't have it in my heart to unfollow him. Yeah, Bonds006 says,

29:17.720 --> 29:23.880
or too much about 5G, new ways to make money and why you're an expert on blah blah or slimming

29:23.880 --> 29:29.320
teas, promotion, Herbalife. Oh yeah, all that shit in your bio especially. Like if it's like,

29:29.320 --> 29:34.760
follow my Twitch channel. That's in my bio. I'm not going to disqualify somebody for having that.

29:34.760 --> 29:41.160
But if it's kind of like, make more followers, I'll tell you, that's a mutant. All right, anyway,

29:42.360 --> 29:46.920
there are Twitter tips with me that you didn't ask for that I went off for 10 minutes about. Sorry,

29:46.920 --> 29:52.360
Logie, do you have any hot Twitter tips? No, I apparently need to start doing more things.

29:52.360 --> 29:56.520
I don't know. Really, the only thing I do nowadays is I just use the like button to

29:57.320 --> 30:02.520
bookmark stuff they go back to later on. That's fair. Usually like, I follow a lot of developers

30:02.520 --> 30:06.200
and they post like tutorials on how to do different things. Like, oh, hey, that's interesting.

30:06.200 --> 30:11.160
I want to do that. That's interesting. So I'll put it so I can, it pulls up in my likes feed.

30:11.160 --> 30:15.800
You know what, though? Like, here's the thing, Logie, is that like, you are so right, though,

30:15.800 --> 30:19.960
about the likes and that there's some very thirsty people on Twitter and the type of stuff that goes

30:19.960 --> 30:24.760
in the feed. And it actually makes me self conscious about the types of things that I like

30:24.760 --> 30:34.520
on Twitter. Because I don't want y'all knowing like, that I that I like some of those thirst

30:34.520 --> 30:40.600
stress. I like some of those thoughts. Okay. And I had I had to like, block those people

30:40.600 --> 30:45.400
that were appearing to my feed, not necessarily people that are liking those things. I like I like

30:45.400 --> 30:50.040
it's like, you just don't want to block a certain type of account. You don't want somebody's,

30:50.600 --> 30:58.040
you know, like ass pic showing up in your feed. I understand. Exactly. Because trust me, I follow

30:58.040 --> 31:04.600
some very good looking people. And I wish I could like more of your tweets. Please don't take it as

31:04.600 --> 31:10.200
a it's just I, I don't want to show the world. What a pervert I am. Okay, so that's why I don't

31:10.200 --> 31:14.280
like as many. But once in a while, I can't help it. And I still like a few or it's like, it's a

31:14.280 --> 31:21.000
nice selfie. And it's not. It's not actually like thirst content. I like the G rated stuff. That's

31:21.000 --> 31:29.240
fine. So anyway, bonds 006 says thank you, Rob. I do not tell Facebook or Instagram my likes and

31:29.240 --> 31:36.120
such music food places I've lived school, etc. Oh, for sure. Um, like all that stuff. When you

31:36.120 --> 31:40.200
check in at locations, you're just opening yourself to getting ads for similar things.

31:40.840 --> 31:47.320
For sure. Absolutely. And like, I don't I don't know what it is. Loki, do you get this problem

31:47.320 --> 31:56.440
on on Facebook? Every other ad I see on Facebook is some new startup men's underwear company

31:56.440 --> 32:02.200
of some sort. And I'm like, Hey, listen to you. I swear to God I do because we'll say things

32:02.200 --> 32:07.320
that like all of a sudden they'll start, you know, showing that I haven't searched any of this.

32:07.320 --> 32:12.440
Not a topic I often talk about out loud or anything like that. I'm like, did it? Did I

32:12.440 --> 32:16.760
did it track an Amazon purchase I made before I went on that cruise or something? Like,

32:16.760 --> 32:23.800
why am I seeing it could have nothing once like that. I like view like there was an ad I saw for

32:23.800 --> 32:28.040
this. I don't even know. It looks like this wearable subwoofer thing or something that

32:28.040 --> 32:31.960
they're talking about, like for immersion for like VR or something like that. And I watched the ad

32:31.960 --> 32:36.920
and I'm like, man, that looks stupid. And now almost like every time I watch a video on my phone,

32:37.400 --> 32:41.960
it's that same ad over and over and over. I'm like, dude, I don't want to look at this. I'm

32:41.960 --> 32:47.640
not interested in it. I looked at the ad and it's like, whatever. Or I'll get recommendations all

32:47.640 --> 32:55.240
the time. Like if, you know, I buy something that they're like, hey, do you want that again? Hey,

32:55.240 --> 32:59.480
do you want this thing that's exactly the same thing that you did? Like, it's like,

32:59.480 --> 33:05.880
I don't need another laptop. I don't need a tablet. I don't need this pixel. You're just

33:05.880 --> 33:10.040
advertising wrong. Pixel pockets. And Chad is asking underwear startups. I meaning like

33:10.040 --> 33:13.480
companies you've never heard of. Like everybody knows like Calvin Klein or Fruit of the Loom or

33:13.480 --> 33:17.400
things like that. Everybody knows that these are companies like that. I never heard of except on

33:17.400 --> 33:22.600
Facebook ads. Uh, and SSJ, Matt and 100. Matt says, I will say redacted because I'm not given

33:22.600 --> 33:27.320
a free exposure, um, are fantastic. Well, thank you as to show on her map by typing that name

33:27.320 --> 33:32.600
and chat where now I'll damn to see their ads for the next year. I'm just, I'm just giving you

33:32.600 --> 33:39.640
our time, but I think that's kind of like how they pick it up. That stuff and pixel pockets

33:39.640 --> 33:46.520
just said the same thing. Y'all are giving free ads. Now, tiger claw, uh, says I see stuff like

33:46.520 --> 33:50.840
that all the time and I can deal with it. It's nothing for me to get mad about. I just let it

33:50.840 --> 33:55.080
fly because I'm good at concentrating on what I want to see. You're right. Like it doesn't

33:55.080 --> 34:00.920
bother me. I'm just, I'm more the type where I'm like, what did I do to generate this algorithm?

34:01.480 --> 34:05.720
That's what I want to know. Like, is it just, is it just showing it to me? Cause I'm a gay man.

34:05.720 --> 34:09.480
Cause that's, that's my primary theory, but I guess, I guess not cause that's what you want

34:09.480 --> 34:15.960
under Matt. I know is not, and is seeing those ads too. So maybe a lot of these companies advertise

34:15.960 --> 34:19.720
on podcasts and stuff too. So I think they just, they just go everywhere. I'm sure. So

34:20.360 --> 34:25.560
anyway, all right. Enough tangents. I'm sorry. Dark soccer is not here tonight to keep me in

34:25.560 --> 34:30.680
line. All right. Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks. Take it back to video games. Loki,

34:31.320 --> 34:36.280
how was your game week? So I play a few things this week. I went ahead and played through

34:37.000 --> 34:43.080
earth defense force, iron rain. So I finished the campaign on that, which unlocked like

34:43.080 --> 34:50.280
nightmare mode and I'm like, no, no, I'm not going to play that because then I had to play the whole

34:50.280 --> 34:54.840
thing again. And the last mission like took like 30 minutes just to kill the stupid boss. And

34:55.480 --> 35:02.840
no, that's it. We got through the story and it was okay. So yeah, so I finished that game.

35:03.720 --> 35:07.960
Guts and glory, that game. That's kind of like happy wheels. So I finished that as well

35:07.960 --> 35:15.400
and played through all the tracks on that and didn't really feel interested enough to play

35:15.400 --> 35:22.760
the user made tracks because those looked like hot garbage. And so I'm just not going to do that.

35:22.760 --> 35:30.760
Um, I played a bit of a step mania today. Uh, and that was pretty fun. Hey, quick side note. Sorry.

35:30.760 --> 35:34.360
I'm a tangent. But since you brought up step mania, that makes me think of step maniacs,

35:34.360 --> 35:38.440
right? The Kyle, the Kyle ward and his company, the dance game. Have you been kind of keeping

35:38.440 --> 35:43.160
track on like, um, like their monthly releases? Like they keep injecting new songs every month

35:43.160 --> 35:48.680
into the game. Have you seen that? It's pretty cool. My Twitter feed. Yeah, I saw that a lot.

35:49.480 --> 35:55.160
I've only played the game once the past couple months. It's been like half songs that many of

35:55.160 --> 36:00.920
us knew through dance, dance revolution. Like, um, yeah, things like, uh, and I'm sorry, things like,

36:00.920 --> 36:04.360
and I'm sorry, cause I don't, I don't have the list in front of me, but I think I saw like bumblebee

36:04.360 --> 36:09.640
by papaya was in there. Uh, walk a lock. I want to say it was in one of them. Uh, and it's,

36:09.640 --> 36:14.920
it's songs that you, you probably found through DDR first are now in this game. And it's interesting

36:14.920 --> 36:18.520
cause they're mixing. It's not just those games. It's like, you'll see one of those songs. You'll

36:18.520 --> 36:21.880
see, Oh, a new song from that maybe you hadn't heard before. And then another one. And then

36:21.880 --> 36:27.240
another one that kind of sounds like that Euro DDR sound, but it's not an actual song that was

36:27.240 --> 36:31.000
in the game before, but it's like from that same family. So it's an interesting mix. I'm sorry. I

36:31.000 --> 36:34.280
just, I wanted to give that a shout out and acknowledgement. Cause I thought it was like,

36:34.280 --> 36:38.040
that's kind of neat that they're supporting it every month. And it's kind of like a little

36:38.040 --> 36:44.440
mix of old and new. That's pretty interesting. Yeah. It was, it was like I said, I played it

36:44.440 --> 36:49.720
one time when we went to check out, there was a, a bowling alley in Rockland that has a pretty

36:49.720 --> 36:53.000
decent size arcade with all these different music games in there. They have that game.

36:53.560 --> 36:59.240
They do have that game. I want to go check it out, except everything's closed. Yeah. Unfortunately.

36:59.240 --> 37:07.160
So, um, uh, I could not, my brain could not handle, uh, doing DDR with a center, um,

37:07.160 --> 37:16.440
a center arrow or centers, uh, step place. Uh, I can do pump it up. Okay. But DDR, just my brain's

37:16.440 --> 37:22.040
not wired to do that. You have to tune down the difficulty to allow yourself to get accustomed to

37:22.040 --> 37:25.400
it. Like you just, you're not going to be able to jump right in and do an expert level song

37:25.960 --> 37:29.880
until you get accustomed to it. They want you to play it a little bit like pump to where you have

37:29.880 --> 37:35.720
to hit like, like three steps at a time, which you can do by like putting your foot in between them.

37:35.720 --> 37:39.800
Um, and so I'm just not really accustomed to that, which is why it was hard for me to do it.

37:39.800 --> 37:43.320
And I couldn't find out how to turn it off and options, or at least I didn't, couldn't figure

37:43.320 --> 37:48.440
out how to get to options, maybe. Yeah. Plus a lot of the hardest level songs are designed for

37:48.440 --> 37:54.440
people to hold the bar and do the foot flying thing, which is not, you know, and I'm not here

37:54.440 --> 37:59.960
to start that debate. Okay. I'm not here to start the debate, but all I'm going to say is in my time

38:00.040 --> 38:06.600
playing DDR, that was something we really just never did. Like, and I, I, again, I'm not trying

38:06.600 --> 38:12.920
to start a war here. Okay. I respect everybody's opinion. I'm too old to dance anymore period.

38:12.920 --> 38:19.480
So I don't have an opinion on this topic anymore, but, um, because of that, like, I, I cannot get

38:19.480 --> 38:26.120
used to trying to hold the bar to do these harder songs. Like it's just, it's really awkward. Yeah.

38:26.120 --> 38:31.080
And you know, getting older doesn't help. So, yeah. So yeah, it's really awkward. I've tried

38:31.080 --> 38:37.400
doing that before, like on max 300 or something like that. And I just, I can't do it that way.

38:37.400 --> 38:41.320
It doesn't, I can't play that way or like seeing people play doubles and stuff like that. I,

38:41.320 --> 38:47.080
I just can't do it. My fear long enough, I guess. Um, and then the last thing I think I played,

38:47.080 --> 38:53.720
Oh, uh, Orna played more Orna. Um, so like up to one 70, I'm still trying to grind through stuff

38:53.720 --> 39:01.880
there. And let's see what else. Um, I did play this one game called one dreamer, uh, prologue.

39:01.880 --> 39:09.640
So it's, they put out a kind of a little demo taste of the game. And so one dreamer is this

39:09.640 --> 39:15.800
like pixel art point and click game, uh, where you hack things. So it takes place in this like

39:15.800 --> 39:22.760
virtual VR world or whatever. And you have to kind of pack stuff to progress through the game,

39:22.760 --> 39:27.800
which is pretty cool. So there's like, almost like coding, but it's not exactly coding or

39:27.800 --> 39:34.120
anything. It's just kind of replacing values. And it's about this, these two kids that are,

39:35.240 --> 39:41.640
um, inspired by one, like this developer of this big, massive VR game, almost like kind of like,

39:41.640 --> 39:48.760
uh, the whole Oasis stuff and, uh, ready player one. So they're inspired by him to,

39:49.640 --> 39:56.600
uh, create their own game. And then it's, there's some story along with the developer on why he

39:56.600 --> 40:01.240
quit and got burnt out and like some other stuff. So it's, it kind of hints at some things,

40:01.240 --> 40:06.840
but it's a beautiful game. Like really worth checking out. The prologue is free on steam to

40:06.840 --> 40:12.120
play the, the full game is not out yet, but yeah, go check it out. One dream or prologue, um, is the

40:12.120 --> 40:16.520
game you want to look for. And it's just great. It's, it's very short, probably about, you know,

40:17.080 --> 40:24.760
an hour, but it's definitely worth playing. All right. That it, that it. All right. Then

40:24.760 --> 40:29.560
let me talk about my gaming week. Um, so since Jamie's not here, I will talk about animal

40:29.560 --> 40:35.640
crossing, which I am still playing. Uh, got my turnips today. Um, and, uh, all that good stuff,

40:35.640 --> 40:41.320
but the big development in animal crossing world is Alan got his switch on. He got it a little

40:41.320 --> 40:45.000
early. He was supposed to get it on Saturday, but I think Best Buy had it on like Thursday.

40:45.000 --> 40:50.440
So he got his coral switch light. And so he just started playing animal crossing. And so maybe it

40:50.440 --> 40:55.640
was Friday because he's, he hasn't even unlocked. His museum is under construction today. So I think

40:55.640 --> 41:00.520
that's like day three. I don't know. I lost count, but anyway, he is starting animal crossing. So

41:00.520 --> 41:05.000
it's all, it's kind of interesting because Bobby on his show tonight talked about, he kind of like

41:05.000 --> 41:10.040
has hit a wall with animal crossing a little bit for me. I think I was getting close to that wall,

41:10.040 --> 41:14.680
but now that Alan has just started animal crossing, it's almost like, Oh, I feel

41:14.680 --> 41:19.320
reinvigorated because I want to help Alan and I want to see his town grow and all this stuff.

41:19.320 --> 41:23.960
But what's really funny about it is that because Alan is like the new kid on the block with his

41:23.960 --> 41:29.800
new switch. And, um, you know, we, we have several friends, including like Jamie, including,

41:29.800 --> 41:33.000
you know, some of our gaming friends in Chicago and other people on Twitter and stuff.

41:33.560 --> 41:40.680
Everybody wants to help Alan. So like the first day he opened his Island, everybody was taking

41:40.680 --> 41:47.160
their duplicate patterns, their hybrid, hybrid flowers, their extra furniture. And like Alan

41:47.160 --> 41:53.000
is at a point where he looks like a hoarder's house because there is just furniture strewn

41:53.000 --> 41:57.720
all over the lawn and DIY patterns surrounding the store because he can't, he doesn't have the

41:57.720 --> 42:02.680
storage for everything. Cause he can't upgrade his house fast enough to get the storage.

42:02.760 --> 42:08.120
Yeah. I, I need to play that game. I, so I would technically be loud than you kill. I'm not even

42:08.120 --> 42:14.920
on the block yet. So I would need to play that. So just giving up on it. Just be careful. Tiger

42:14.920 --> 42:19.080
class said he should post the friend court on the discord. It is on his social media.

42:19.080 --> 42:23.320
If you know his Twitter account, which isn't too hard to find, he did post it on there for what

42:23.320 --> 42:28.680
it's worth. Um, yeah, I need to add him. I haven't got a chance to actually get possession of my

42:28.680 --> 42:33.000
switch to be able to do that. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. So, uh, yeah, that's just kind of

42:33.000 --> 42:36.840
the funny thing I've kind of been watching him go through is that everybody is just dumping their

42:36.840 --> 42:40.520
shit on his lawn and everybody's trying to be helpful. Like nobody's doing anything wrong,

42:40.520 --> 42:44.440
but it's just funny. It's almost like, I feel like he's almost overwhelmed with having to sort

42:44.440 --> 42:49.480
through everything because now he has these random patches of, well, I have some orange flowers over

42:49.480 --> 42:53.640
there that are just all kind of mixed together. I have some purple and pink ones over there that

42:53.640 --> 42:59.160
are just kind of all mixed together. And I have three villagers on my Island. He hasn't even

42:59.160 --> 43:05.160
picked all his weeds yet. He's like, I kind of liked the way the weeds look and I'm like, no,

43:05.160 --> 43:11.080
you need to get rid of them or you're never going to get a three star rating. So it's, but it's,

43:11.080 --> 43:16.680
it's kind of been fun and reinvigorating to experience the game from day one all over again

43:16.680 --> 43:22.360
through him. And like, you know, like Alan doesn't usually get into console gaming.

43:22.360 --> 43:26.200
So the fact that he bought a switch and he's playing animal crossing is kind of a big deal.

43:26.200 --> 43:33.160
Like he's like exclusively been PC gaming a long time. Like I can't even think of the last time,

43:33.160 --> 43:37.560
like I watched him sit down and play a console game. So this is kind of a big deal. And of

43:37.560 --> 43:41.400
course now I showed him more art, you know, cause even though some things I own digitally,

43:41.400 --> 43:45.800
so he can't play them like super Mario maker too. Like I can't like loan that to him.

43:45.800 --> 43:50.040
Some things I have on cartridge that he has expressed interest. He wants to get into like

43:50.040 --> 43:55.400
Zelda breath of the wild. So it, it will be kind of fun to revisit a lot of those games for the

43:55.400 --> 44:02.760
first time through him. That'll be pretty cool. So, all right. Bonds 006 says a lot of my Facebook

44:02.760 --> 44:08.200
friends are begging others to come to their Island. I like reading their pitches to get visitors

44:09.560 --> 44:15.960
without getting too deep into the psychology of it all. I think a lot of that is the time and age

44:15.960 --> 44:21.720
that we live in with all of this. My hands floating around here, going on in the world

44:21.720 --> 44:27.560
is that you can't really go out and visit people in person. So animal crossing is kind of the way

44:27.560 --> 44:32.280
for some people to kind of get that contact with other people. So I think that's why you have a

44:32.280 --> 44:37.000
lot of people that are really open to like, please come visit my village, even though I don't have

44:37.000 --> 44:41.720
anything that exciting going on today. Water my flowers, you know, or something. And I'm happy to

44:41.720 --> 44:45.320
go to other people's town and water their flowers. You never know what's in nooks and

44:45.320 --> 44:49.720
I usually will keep a stash of oranges from my town or my islands, especially on me and go sell

44:49.720 --> 44:55.320
them in other people's towns. So it's kind of like a point for me to go there. So yeah. It's,

44:55.320 --> 44:58.360
it's, it's an interesting side effect of everything that's going on in the world.

44:58.360 --> 45:03.400
Anyway, it wasn't all animal crossing, but I wanted to update you on Alan getting his switch

45:03.400 --> 45:09.400
this week. Some other games I've been playing. So I got sucked into another sale on the PlayStation

45:09.480 --> 45:15.160
store. They had a big in Japan sale. So there was a couple games I got on discount. One of them is

45:15.160 --> 45:21.000
Taiko no Tatujin on PlayStation 4. I think it's called, maybe somebody in chat can correct me.

45:21.000 --> 45:25.960
I think it's Taiko no Tatujin Drum Master is the subtitle of it, but it's like, it's the PlayStation

45:25.960 --> 45:31.000
4 release of Taiko no Tatujin. So speaking of music games, you know, this is one that goes

45:31.000 --> 45:35.640
way back, right? Like Taiko no Tatujin, when was the first round of those games? Probably in the

45:35.640 --> 45:41.480
PS2 era. And if you don't know, like there's a, there's a tiny little drum or in the arcade,

45:41.480 --> 45:46.360
it's a big drum and you can kind of, you either hit it in the middle, the left or the right side

45:46.360 --> 45:51.400
on the red notches, or you hit it on the rim with the blue notches on the left or the right side.

45:51.400 --> 45:55.400
And I was always kind of like, I don't know how that's really going to translate well to controller,

45:55.400 --> 45:58.600
but since it was on sale for like 14 bucks, I was like, eh, screw it. I'll pick it up.

45:59.320 --> 46:03.560
And so I did, and it's kind of fun to play on controller. They did it in a way where

46:04.520 --> 46:11.240
right and down or X and O, I think if I'm remembering my symbols right, are the inside,

46:11.240 --> 46:17.160
the reds. So it's like the inside of the controller is where you hit for the red and then

46:17.160 --> 46:23.880
the outside or the L1, R1 or L2, R2 are the blue ones. And you can hit those for the blue ones.

46:23.880 --> 46:29.000
So it actually, it makes it easy to kind of like do a drum roll, like you would with the sticks.

46:29.000 --> 46:33.160
So it's actually, it's not too terribly laid out. And I've been playing a variety,

46:33.160 --> 46:37.880
it's got a huge song list. No songs you would really know probably unless there are some

46:37.880 --> 46:42.280
classical songs in it. And there's a lot of anime songs in it. I don't follow anime so closely,

46:42.280 --> 46:45.800
but like the theme of Doraemon is in it. And so some of you that follow anime a little better

46:45.800 --> 46:52.120
than I do will probably recognize stuff in it. And there's a lot of J-pop in it. And so I don't know

46:52.120 --> 46:57.320
if these songs are huge or not, cause I haven't really listened to them before, but they were

46:57.320 --> 47:01.000
catchy. There was a song in there called Linda Linda, I thought was really, really catchy.

47:01.000 --> 47:08.280
So, cause like, it's like a rock song. It goes, what? Any Katamari track? No, there's no Katamari

47:08.280 --> 47:13.000
track, but they do have other game soundtrack songs, including it was weird. It's the Pac-Man

47:13.000 --> 47:19.000
song, but when it was in Ridge Racer. So it's the Ridge Racer Pac-Man song. That is one of

47:19.000 --> 47:23.720
the songs in the game. And there's like a Soul Calibur 6 song and things like that. So, yeah.

47:23.720 --> 47:31.240
Oh, Bonds 006 says, what was the ripoff? This or Donkey Kong? I think Donkey Kong was after

47:31.240 --> 47:38.600
Taika. They were about the same time. It was, I think it was after. Was it? Was it technically,

47:38.600 --> 47:44.120
did Namco have input on that game? Was it their version of it? I don't remember. And it's been

47:44.120 --> 47:51.080
so long. I don't remember. Oh, I didn't know that. Jason, our voiceover guy in chat saying Linda

47:51.080 --> 47:56.040
Linda wasn't owned on. I didn't know that. Okay. Thank you, Bobby. Namco made Donkey Kong. Okay.

47:56.040 --> 47:59.880
I figured there had to be some questions. So that's why. So it was, it was one of those.

48:00.680 --> 48:06.840
It's like Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine or the Yoshi's forest or whatever it was.

48:08.040 --> 48:15.880
It's there. It's Puyo Puyo, but with the characters in it. Okay. Let's see. Let's see.

48:15.880 --> 48:19.480
S2100 Matt says Taiko is such a fun arcade experience. I was always hesitant to see if

48:19.480 --> 48:24.280
that would translate to the console versions. And it totally does translate well. Act F says

48:24.280 --> 48:30.600
there's also Taiko no Tatsujin drum and fun on the Switch. Yeah. And I thought, I think it's

48:31.320 --> 48:38.440
fun because they put a lot of things to do in it. They have the little gotcha reward boxes things,

48:39.080 --> 48:44.120
but you don't pay for the boxes. Instead you fill out these little mini bingo cards. So every song

48:44.120 --> 48:48.120
in the game, and there's gotta be at least 50 of them, if not more. And there's a ton of DLC. You

48:48.120 --> 48:52.120
could probably buy like 30 or 40 more songs, but they want like two bucks a song. So I haven't

48:52.120 --> 48:56.840
bought any of them. Um, but every song has a little bingo card that goes with it. And it's

48:56.840 --> 49:00.680
a three by three bingo card. And as you do little certain accomplishments, you fill out the bingo

49:00.680 --> 49:04.920
card. And then when you get a bingo three across or down, it's more like Tic Tac Toes. I don't know

49:04.920 --> 49:08.680
why they call it bingo, but when you get a bingo, you get a little coin and you can use the coins in

49:08.680 --> 49:14.440
the shop to open like loot boxes. But luckily they don't have like, or at least I didn't see it,

49:14.440 --> 49:19.800
a DLC that's like pay $20 and get all these loot boxes. I didn't see that. So I'm okay with the

49:19.800 --> 49:23.560
loot box thing when it's like self-contained like that. And I actually thought the little,

49:23.560 --> 49:27.800
because once you finish a bingo card, spoiler alert, if you get all nine on a bingo card,

49:28.360 --> 49:34.040
you get a special bingo card that's even harder. So it kind of gets some replayability value.

49:34.040 --> 49:38.920
And I thought the online component is kind of neat. You can do ranked matches online,

49:38.920 --> 49:43.480
but you're not playing live against people. You're playing against people's ghosts.

49:44.200 --> 49:48.760
So it has a recording of somebody else playing a song and you're playing against that. And I

49:48.760 --> 49:53.240
thought that was a pretty clever way to do it. So that way there's always somebody online to fight.

49:53.240 --> 49:56.200
Cause you know how, like sometimes in these games, once they've been out a year or two,

49:56.200 --> 50:00.840
nobody's playing them anymore. Well, nice with this thing being on sale, I can still go in and

50:00.840 --> 50:05.480
do ranked matches and you do placement matches and then you're given a certain rank and you,

50:05.480 --> 50:09.320
you know, can level up or you can even go down if you're not beating enough people.

50:09.320 --> 50:15.160
And I'm finding that, you know, I'm winning two out of three. So, so far I haven't played a lot

50:15.160 --> 50:20.600
of them, but it was kind of neat. I liked it. So yeah, I thought, I thought the, let's see,

50:20.600 --> 50:24.600
active says the bingo cards are only obtainable within game currency and you can't buy that with

50:24.600 --> 50:30.200
real money. Good to know. Very good to know. Bobby Blackwell says I have the PS2 Tycho versions.

50:30.200 --> 50:34.840
I have four of the games and the controller. Yeah. So, I mean, yeah, this is the first one

50:34.840 --> 50:39.400
I remember buying in a long time. So, it's a lot of fun and I'm enjoying playing it.

50:40.360 --> 50:46.280
The other game I bought on the PlayStation 4 sale, I'm going to stop for a minute here because this

50:46.280 --> 50:51.400
is very important. I'm about to say a very controversial gaming opinion. That's probably

50:51.400 --> 50:56.600
going to make some of you very upset. So, I'm just going to beg you. Let me have my shitty opinion.

50:56.600 --> 51:00.760
Please don't rage unsubscribe or anything from the show because of my shitty opinion. Okay.

51:01.400 --> 51:06.600
But I'm entitled to my shitty opinion. Here it is. The other game I bought on the file, on the,

51:07.480 --> 51:13.800
the, uh, uh, sale is the Final Fantasy 8 remake because it was $10. And I was like, you know what?

51:14.920 --> 51:19.160
It's high time. You know what? I need to give this game another chance. I always pick on this

51:19.160 --> 51:24.360
Final Fantasy game. It's always like the one I say is the worst because I can't stand the junction

51:24.360 --> 51:29.800
drawing and all that stuff. I, I've never really cared for Final Fantasy 8. Let me give it another

51:29.800 --> 51:35.880
try. And so I started it up. I let it play. I got through the opening sequence and I was like,

51:36.760 --> 51:41.720
this CD video hasn't aged very well, but okay. It's, you know, they didn't have time to go redo

51:41.720 --> 51:50.040
it, whatever. And then the game starts. Loki. I have to be honest, Loki. It looks like garbage.

51:50.040 --> 51:58.440
I'm sorry. It looks so bad. Like, and here's the thing. This is the reason why. Let me justify my

51:58.440 --> 52:03.560
shitty opinion. Okay. Cause I already know some of you are like, Steven, look, look, we all have

52:03.560 --> 52:10.840
our problematic gaming opinions. This is mine. It's that juxtaposition of this really high

52:10.840 --> 52:17.640
definition, really good looking model of like Squall or Kestis and these characters,

52:17.640 --> 52:23.480
but then they didn't do anything to the backgrounds, which have not aged well since

52:23.480 --> 52:31.400
the PlayStation 1 era. They look very like, it looks like you're putting on a pair of bad glasses

52:31.400 --> 52:36.040
and everything's very blurred. And like, here's the thing. When I play the Final Fantasy 7,

52:37.000 --> 52:41.080
not the remake, but the Final Fantasy 7 version that they put on PlayStation 4,

52:41.640 --> 52:47.000
it all looks kind of bad and grainy and you go, Oh, retro experience, but something about

52:47.000 --> 52:55.640
Final Fantasy 8, where it's like HD clashing with like non HD at the same time. Like I could

52:55.640 --> 53:02.120
not get past it. Loki. I could not get past it. I'm sorry. So there it is. One of those games that

53:02.120 --> 53:09.400
would benefit from like that, uh, AI upscaled stuff where they do that on PC or something.

53:09.960 --> 53:15.400
All right. I I'm finally taking a look at trash to see, or sorry, take a look at chat to see if

53:15.400 --> 53:23.480
they're calling me trash. Oh, and let's see. Bobby Black Wolf says, I'm not angry. I'm just

53:23.480 --> 53:29.080
disappointed. DJ Rama S says the redheaded stepchild of the Final Fantasy games. Quest

53:29.080 --> 53:33.480
Buster says, I'm not mad. I'm laughing. You stop playing where you want to Rob.

53:34.120 --> 53:39.400
Bonds006 says, we all have our moment of let me give X title a try. And Repcycled says,

53:39.400 --> 53:44.360
Oh yeah, it wasn't what I expected. Repcycled says the backgrounds are CGI renders. Can't

53:44.360 --> 53:49.400
they just rerender it in high res? Like, I feel like if it was that the original files or

53:49.400 --> 53:58.440
something. Yeah. And if it was that easy, they would have like, you know, was it 12 for one of

53:58.440 --> 54:03.240
them they had, like they found the old, maybe it's even eight or they found the older files

54:03.240 --> 54:10.760
and upscaled at the seven 20. But that may have been eight actually. Now they think of it. So

54:11.400 --> 54:16.200
I'm going to be like brutally honest. I turned the game off before I even got out of the

54:16.200 --> 54:22.040
balam garden. Like I didn't even get into a battle. I was like, I literally just had a,

54:22.040 --> 54:27.480
I was playing it and I'm like, and like I access one of the computer terminals and like my eyes

54:27.480 --> 54:32.120
are hurting. It's so blurry and bad. And I'm like, I, and then I'm like walking through and

54:32.120 --> 54:36.200
I run into selfie and I'm like, okay, let's take her on a little tour. And I just, I hit a point

54:36.200 --> 54:43.080
where I just put the controller on the table and I said, I can't. And I turned it off. I will

54:43.800 --> 54:48.840
now before you final fantasy eight fans, send me your hate tweets and cyber bullying and hate

54:48.840 --> 54:53.720
email. I will try again this week because I owe it at least to get to a battle. Okay.

54:54.360 --> 55:00.920
But so you play on PC because someone did release a pack that they did the AI gigapixel

55:01.720 --> 55:05.480
upscaling to four K and it actually looks pretty good.

55:05.480 --> 55:09.000
Bobby black Wolf and Chad says the original source code was lost or destroyed or both

55:09.000 --> 55:16.280
final fantasy 13. They found the original files and upscaled to seven 20. Yes. And that's the one

55:16.280 --> 55:20.200
I really want to play right now. And I wish game pass would hurry up and add it. So I don't get

55:20.200 --> 55:24.520
tempted into buying that whole trilogy again, but I'm game pass did announce they're adding

55:24.520 --> 55:29.480
final fantasy nine, like within days, like it's the early first half of this month. So it's,

55:29.480 --> 55:33.080
if they didn't add it, like now it's, uh, within the next couple of days,

55:33.080 --> 55:37.560
file fancy nine is getting at it. So that's pretty cool. And there's no HD. So I think

55:37.560 --> 55:41.720
file fancy nine will be a little easier to stomach because you're not going to have the clash going

55:41.720 --> 55:48.440
on of HD on top of not HD. It's all going to be non HD. And I think it will be a little more

55:48.440 --> 55:53.960
palatable. May have to check it out on PC. I wonder if I, I know I have seven,

55:53.960 --> 55:57.960
I think Alan owns it. So I need to do that whole library lending thing. I don't know. Anyway,

55:57.960 --> 56:03.320
there it is. There was my gaming week. Oh boy. I just asked you 100. Matt just clipped. Oh boy,

56:03.320 --> 56:07.560
I'm going to be in so much trouble. Sorry. Again, please don't hate unsubscribe. We love you. We

56:07.560 --> 56:12.440
value, we value all the opinions. I see you final fantasy eight fans. And again, I I'm going to give

56:12.440 --> 56:18.280
you this cookie. I recognize that the story in final fantasy eight is pretty good. And like my

56:18.280 --> 56:23.960
problem has always been with just the game part of the game. Like I hated the drawing junctioning.

56:23.960 --> 56:28.360
I hated that everything leveled up with you that those were all the things that like bothered me

56:28.360 --> 56:33.480
about the game. Uh, originally like it's not the story. So let's just make that clear. All right.

56:34.360 --> 56:38.360
I find people are willing to let it slide a little more when I give that little disclaimer.

56:39.960 --> 56:43.800
All right, let's get into some gaming news and what's been going on in the world this week.

56:43.800 --> 56:50.280
Loki help change the topic. Okay. So, uh, let's talk a little bit about leaks.

56:51.000 --> 56:56.120
So apparently there is this giant Nintendo leak that happened. So

56:57.320 --> 57:04.600
lots of different things leaked out and a lot of it was surrounding the Nintendo Wii. And so

57:05.400 --> 57:12.440
they had stuff like with old Pokemon debug roms and source code, uh, 3ds debug roms, uh,

57:12.440 --> 57:18.200
the keys for all the consoles. Uh, so those are all the encrypted keys to get access to some of

57:18.200 --> 57:24.760
the, um, you know, to be able to sign your own code almost on, uh, everything up through the DSI.

57:25.960 --> 57:32.040
Then of course, full source code design files, documentation, and everything basically used

57:32.040 --> 57:37.960
to create the Wii. So full source code for the operating system, which I thought was weird.

57:37.960 --> 57:44.520
It's actually called iOS. So, um, with that, I mean, this thing is going to be hacked. I mean,

57:44.520 --> 57:48.440
or he has hacked the pieces, but now, I mean, they could do some really crazy stuff with that.

57:49.240 --> 57:53.480
Um, I want to read some, can I read something from the discord? So we have a discord, of course,

57:53.480 --> 57:57.800
and we encourage you to join over at vog network.com slash discord. And sometimes you guys post

57:57.800 --> 58:00.920
stories throughout the week and we use some of those stories in, in planning, or you leave a

58:00.920 --> 58:05.640
comment that sticks in my mind of, Oh, I need to mention that on the show. So we had a comment on

58:05.640 --> 58:11.800
this from 13 forever in chat, um, or excuse me on discord who sent us a tweet. So the first

58:11.800 --> 58:17.400
thing was a tweet that says, uh, and the tweet is from an account Mark and 42 that says people

58:17.400 --> 58:23.320
love to get all excited about leaks of official SDKs or code, but really rarely are they all that

58:23.320 --> 58:27.960
amazing early on in development of homebrew for a console, they can help make things move much

58:27.960 --> 58:33.800
faster, but the expense of legally tainting everything they touch. And then, uh, 13 leaves

58:33.800 --> 58:41.560
the comment delete that leak is overblown and misreported. Yes. So like for example, um, the,

58:42.280 --> 58:45.640
there was, you know, folks were thinking, well with this, you know, you could have better

58:45.640 --> 58:50.600
emulation or whatever, but not necessarily because if you use the exact code or whatever

58:50.600 --> 58:56.280
that's in that for emulation, then they can shut you down because you're basically using pirated

58:56.280 --> 59:01.080
code, but not to say that you couldn't like gleam some information. Like if you're having trouble

59:01.080 --> 59:06.840
with a certain thing or rendering a certain, you know, part of a game or maybe like sound design or

59:06.840 --> 59:12.120
whatever the case may be where you tried and tried and tried with the emulator, but just can't seem

59:12.120 --> 59:16.120
to crack what it is or how it runs or something. You might be able to look at that code and

59:16.120 --> 59:22.280
understand what you're doing wrong, um, without actually using the direct code. Not to say that

59:22.280 --> 59:27.000
there wouldn't be some unscrupulous folks that may be able to like clone the Wii system, or I

59:27.000 --> 59:31.000
don't even know what they could be done with it, but it's still very interesting to see, you know,

59:31.000 --> 59:37.720
some of this data that's come out and some of the cool, uh, like little tech demos and whatnot that

59:37.720 --> 59:43.800
they had put together with that from like the GameCube and everything. And by the way, there's

59:43.800 --> 59:48.520
echoing comments in the chat about what basically what you just said is that, you know, and as, as

59:48.520 --> 59:53.160
much as it sounds like this is really exciting stuff for emulators, uh, it could, it would actually

59:53.160 --> 59:58.120
damage them to use this code. Yeah, like even the folks, I think with, um, Dolphin or whatever, they

59:58.120 --> 01:00:02.680
said that, yeah, we're not even gonna look at that. We can't look at that. We're not even gonna, you

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:07.160
know, we're gonna pretend it doesn't exist type of thing. I think the reason why a story like this

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:13.800
catches fire is that for one, the Wii was, remember, just remember how like crazy popular the Wii was,

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:19.400
right? And I think it's just that element of TEEHEE, I'm seeing something I'm not supposed to see,

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:25.240
heehee. I think that's the reason why this stuff spreads like wildfire is like, don't look at that.

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:30.040
What? Right? Like everybody wants to see it. What's this like, you know,

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:33.560
assuming that they have like all this stuff out there, obviously like, you're not going to see

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:39.640
emulator of teams or whatever using this data or they, they probably wouldn't be using this data,

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:44.840
but who's to say that you couldn't like someone couldn't fork one of those emulators or whatever

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:49.480
and start incorporating that code or some, somehow to do it, you know, under the radar or whatever,

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:54.440
or, you know, you have some unscrupulous folks developing, you know, mod chips or something

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:59.320
into these where they could bypass something or learn how to sign code a certain way. And you

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:05.560
could, I don't know what you could do with it. Not for me to, to really say, because I don't know

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:10.200
how to do any of this stuff. So we'll have to see what happens with it. And the thought is that there

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:14.040
may actually be more data that's out there that hasn't been leaked yet, that this is only a

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:21.480
portion of it. So I'm curious to see what happens. Uh, bonds 006 asks, will we get an explosion of

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:27.960
home brew from this? And I'm kind of, I'm kind of like, I don't, I don't see it being more or

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:32.920
less than what's already being made. Right. We already had a lot of home brew because remember

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:36.520
there was that whole installing the home brew channel on your Wii. Remember the whole thing.

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:41.880
So you could run like home brew software. Like that was all still big when the Wii was still

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:47.960
like a current piece of hardware. So I don't see it exploding now. Well, like, here's my thought

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:53.240
with this, like, could it be possible for somebody to like, say, you know how we have right now where

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:58.200
folks can create their own NES cartridges or something like that. They're able to build it.

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:03.720
So it can actually run on the real hardware could maybe someone home brew a Wii game and build it so

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:08.200
that it can run on the actual hardware and be able to sign it correctly so that the system thinks

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:14.120
it's, you know, an actual legit copy of a, you know, disc or something like that. Or I don't

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:19.080
know what you could really do with it. In theory. Yes. Although you're going to hit that same

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:25.240
problem where Nintendo is going to pursue it and shut it down. However, this does be, I mean,

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:29.800
we're all quick to kind of say, Nintendo will sue it. Nintendo will shut it down. What if it comes

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:36.200
from a country where they don't give a shit about copyright? No, that's a serious question. What

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:40.680
happens if it comes from a country that doesn't give a shit about copyright? Then it's a little

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:47.160
harder. That argument becomes a little more complex. Yeah. I mean, if they try to sell it

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:53.560
here that then it's not, well, now it's happening here, but could this open up things in other

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:58.360
countries? I don't know. It's really hard question to take on. I also kind of think it maybe is a lot

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:03.720
of work. It's kind of one of those like lots of work, maybe. I don't know. I, again, I feel like

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:09.640
most things that would be exist for home brew development emulation on the Wii have probably

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:13.560
happened. Although, sure, the emulation can always get better and it can get stronger,

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:18.360
but the reputable, respectable teams are not going to be diving into this because they know they

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:24.120
can't. Yeah. No. One of the things that was interesting that was also leaked out of it was

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:30.120
the official Game Boy emulator. So I'm assuming this is what was running on like a DS or something

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:35.400
like that to run, or maybe, I don't know if it was necessarily a DS. I can't remember where they

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:42.280
had like game. No, the original DS ran color. Well, it ran advantage games. Did it run the,

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:49.240
well, the advantage ran Game Boy color game. Did it have Game Boy hardware in it? Like it had like

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:53.240
the same chip on there or I don't know. Was that actually emulated? Can you look at the documents

01:03:53.240 --> 01:04:00.680
and tell me, okay, let's find the documents that download all three gigs of that from wherever it

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:06.680
is somewhere out there. Oh, Oh yeah. You'll find it easily on 4chan. Oh, that's going to be a fun

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:13.880
journey. Yeah. I don't think I'll be doing that. Yeah. The needle is in the haystack,

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:19.560
but just so you know, the haystack is full of bees. Yeah. So anyways, so where this actually

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:24.440
came from, since, you know, we didn't really discuss that is it was coming from Broadon,

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:30.200
which is, or at least that's where the thought is where they came from. So Broadon was a company

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:37.160
that was in, I believe China that was developed. They developed the IQ system, which I think that

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:45.720
was that a GameCube, the Panasonic player, the Panasonic Q that one. No, it was the IQ. No,

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:49.320
you're right. I think Jamie's highlighted that on the show like a long time ago, but yes, I know

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:54.360
what you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, apparently the thought is that's where this is

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:59.800
from. Although why would the source code for like Pokemon games be in there or the Wii operating

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:04.520
system and stuff? I wouldn't think this would be something that would be a part of that, but

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:09.640
I don't know. Maybe they were working on a Wii device or something. Who knows? Who knows?

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:15.320
Maybe. Who knows? All right. Well, can we see what Smarter Minds will do with it?

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:19.880
Well, or, or not. Cause they can't. It's just one of those. That's interesting. Okay. Yeah.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:23.960
So I totally get the perspective of the comment and discord. That's kind of like,

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:28.120
people are making this a much bigger deal than it is. And I think it's, it's just one of those

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:31.960
we're seeing something we're not supposed to see it's insider information, but there's going

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:35.720
to be people that download it that have no idea like what to even do with it. You know what I

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:38.840
mean? They're going to download it just because they're told they're not supposed to have it.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:44.920
And that's, that's why this story is catching everywhere here. Something you're not supposed

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:49.560
to have is on the parts of the internet. You rarely visit. All right. Anyway,

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:56.040
let's move on and talk about some other news. Uh, this is one of those, this is a bummer,

01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:02.040
but is anyone really surprised? The 2020 Tokyo game show has been canceled this year. And of

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:07.240
course, as you can imagine, it's because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Uh, so it will not be happening

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:11.800
this year and it will be replaced with an online showcase. Uh, an official statement from Tokyo

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:17.080
game show says due to the outbreak of novel coronavirus or COVID-19 on a global scale.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:22.040
And the situation remains unpredictable in Japan as well. The organizer and the co-organizers have

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:26.680
reached this decision after a long consideration to place the utmost priority on the health and

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:32.200
safety of visitors, exhibitors, and stakeholders. We ask for your kind understanding and cooperation.

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:36.680
Um, and again, I don't think anyone's really surprised by this. Some people may be surprised,

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:42.200
like, isn't it a little early for this to cancel? Like we still have things like, you know, the,

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:46.440
the talk has been going on about things around labor day weekend, like dragon con, you know,

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:50.760
still haven't canceled and we've already gotten into those reasons and so forth and the legal

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:55.400
stuff behind it. And, you know, Bobby took a deep dive on that if you want to hear all that.

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:59.720
But I think also the reality is with something like Tokyo game show, you know, you have all these

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:04.920
exhibitors and they've got to prepare things. They've got to plan their booths. They've got

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:09.320
a plan, you know, all these things that go into it. And if they kind of know like, all right,

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:13.640
big events are not going to be happening for the rest of the year. Like, you know,

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:16.760
all of the scientists are telling us this and everything's kind of pointing to that.

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:22.520
Then why have people waste their energy this far out in planning their demos, planning their

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:26.440
boosts, planning all of that stuff to something that they just know is not going to happen.

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:33.720
And I think that's why it cancels this far out. So pretty much, I would just expect at this point

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:38.680
that any 2020 convention just ain't happening. Um, I'm going to cross my fingers and tell,

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:42.680
I'm still hoping for a miracle. I'm still, I'm still hoping dragon con can happen. I'm,

01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:47.560
I'm an idiot. And the reason why, you know, I'm like, well, you know, it took us a couple months,

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:52.600
like go, uh, go two months ago to, uh, where we were at then. That was right when this whole

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:56.680
thing was starting. So two months from now is going to be July and who knows where we're going

01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:01.800
to be by then. You know? Yes. Yes. I listened to science. Yes. I know a lot of the news isn't good.

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:06.760
So sue me if I want to be a little bit optimistic. All right. Give me, give me something. Cause I'm

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:10.360
getting fucking sick of being at home too. Just like everybody else. And yes, I'll do it. Yes.

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:14.280
I understand the importance of it. No, I'm not going to be down there protesting that I want my

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:18.520
haircut because I understand that something, you know, I have a dad who's 80 years old.

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:23.480
I need to make sure he's okay. So I'm doing my part in everything. But, um, you know,

01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:28.600
it's just one of those, like, I wish it would happen, but I'm accepting the reality. It's

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:33.080
probably not. And so that goes with pretty much any of the big game shows, any of the big

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:38.200
conventions and so forth. So we have to start seeing now, if some of this starts to dip into

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:44.600
2021, what happens with stuff in January, like magfest and so forth? Who knows? Who knows? Yeah,

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:48.520
it's just, I think it really is too early to say at this point, but maybe some of that will start

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:55.080
getting evaluated over the summer and things like that. So, uh, anyway, um, you know, it's, um,

01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:00.920
it's not particularly surprising here. It gets canceled. It'll be interesting to see what they

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:05.320
do in the virtual space. Now we know it's going to be a virtual convention. So what is that going

01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:09.560
to look like? Is it something you're going to have to pay to access, to see trailers and

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:13.720
maybe pay, play some demos online or something? I don't know. Uh, or, or what is it going to be?

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:17.640
Or is it just going to be a drip feeding of trailers or something like that? Who knows

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:21.240
more to come, I suppose. So let's move on to our next story. Loki.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:32.840
All right. So, uh, Roblox has had a user breach. Basically what happened was, is there was this,

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:40.200
a hacker that bribed, uh, one of the Roblox, I guess, employees to gain access to their backend

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:47.880
customer support panel. And apparently using that, they were able to take a hold and gain

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:54.040
access to some of the more prominent Roblox players that are out there. Um, if there's

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:59.480
such a thing and they were able to do things as, you know, see the user's email addresses,

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:05.560
change passwords, remove two factor authentication from the accounts, ban users and more.

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:13.080
Apparently there was some folks on there that, you know, some of these, you know, high, more popular,

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:18.120
like streamers or whatever that had private emails that were tied to that. And they were getting

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:23.640
contacted by this guy as well to, you know, basically he was bragging that he had their

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:31.320
account or something. So it's, it's interesting, um, that they let this happen. Apparently it was

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:40.280
a small set of users that had this happen to them, but still kind of ridiculous that it was somebody

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:47.160
that basically fished their way into the system. But apparently those folks that did have their

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:54.840
accounts compromised were contacted, um, by the hacker. Yeah. And I think it's kind of funny

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:59.880
cause I don't know if you kind of brushed Roblox off there at the beginning, but Roblox is huge

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:06.680
online. I understand it is my kids play it all the time. Yeah. It's more of a tween audience,

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:13.160
I suppose. Mostly it's one of the, it's one of the games that's coming to the Xbox series X.

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:21.560
So I see, um, it's going to fully, I've seen the thing is with Roblox is a lot of it,

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:27.960
it's all user generated content. And so a lot of it's just plain trash. There's some things that

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:35.080
are popular. Like my son keeps talking about this horror game series that he plays, that's called

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:40.920
piggy and that there's like 21 chapters of or something. And he says it's very much like granny.

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:47.960
I'm like, none of this means anything to me right now. Um, I'm like, is this what I

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:52.440
sounded like when I was his age and talking about Nickelodeon shows to my mom? Like, is that what

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:58.360
this is all about? Well, no, no, no. I like, I would be, you know, able to like keep up with all

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:03.800
that stuff. It's not like I'm getting old. It's just, it's, it's, it's a stupid, um, I get it.

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:09.880
He's into the, but like, I'm not going to pay attention to every single like obstacle course

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:14.600
game that he plays or something, but he's very interested in like the streamers that he watches

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:18.600
that play. And then he goes and plays with them or something like that. Like they'll do a live

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:25.400
stream. And so I don't know, but like, yeah, I know it's a very popular game. It's also full of

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:33.080
just all sorts of copyright IP theft, trademark infringement. It's all over the place. That's

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:38.680
absolute not user generated content. What do you expect? Yeah, but they just don't see the police,

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:45.240
any of that. All right. Uh, let's move on and talk about, uh, another announcement this week,

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:50.040
which I guess was supposed to be like one of the first, uh, summer game. I even forgot the name

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:54.360
of that thing already. Summer game Fest. So they're calling it the format. Yeah. Yeah. I

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:59.160
think this was supposed to be one of those announcements, but it was all over the Twitter

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:03.640
by within five seconds of it being announced. And that has to do with mortal combat 11,

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:09.000
getting an expansion pack called aftermath. It is going to add to the story and it's going to add

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.480
some new characters to the game, including fusion, uh, who I believe was originally in mortal combat

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:18.840
four. Right. He's like the air God. Right. Right. Uh, and then you have a Shiva. That's pretty cool.

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:23.160
Shiva was the like Goro, the female Goro and mortal combat three. Remember that? So, uh,

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:30.280
she's in that too. And then Robocop because, uh, mortal combat 11 has become this very interesting,

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:36.520
like Hollywood versus video games type of thing. Uh, and, and, uh, Robocop is going to be in it.

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:43.560
And at Boone in a tweet confirmed, Peter Weller is voicing Robocop. That's pretty awesome. Yes,

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:47.320
that is, that is pretty cool. Like, don't get me wrong. It's just, it's just like random,

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:51.320
like, well, cause what we have the terminator, right. Isn't one of the, it was in 11. I'm trying

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:57.640
to remember who's in 10 and who's in 11. Cause it's different. Um, well I know 11 has like spawn

01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:03.320
and there's a terminator, uh, the joker. Oh, right. The joker. See, and then like some of them

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:07.960
like had like Freddie and Jason and, but that was like, I think that was 10. Those are even

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:13.080
all the way back to nine. I think Freddie was in her. Those weren't, no, those weren't injustice.

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:20.280
Yeah. Yeah. It was a predator in this one. I don't remember. Predator was in the last one.

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:24.680
I was in the last one. Yeah. All right. Uh, thank you. SU 100, Matt, laying it out for me. Thank

01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:30.840
you. I needed something very plain text there. Leatherface Freddie, Jason alien predator were

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:36.920
in the last games. Thank you. Uh, and Freddie was also in nine, uh, and, uh, tiger class saying we

01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:41.800
now have a Robo cop versus terminator in a fighting game. Yes, we do. Uh, those comments

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:48.040
from our Twitch channel, twitch.tv slash vog network. This is all coming out on may 26th.

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:53.080
Um, so the expansion will have the cinematic story, the new characters and new skins,

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:59.960
three new skins for 39 99. There is too expensive. There is also an aftermath collection,

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:05.880
which includes the base game, the combat pack, downloadable content. And now the aftermath

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:13.160
expansion will be available digitally and also, uh, physically in June for the 59 99 kind of more

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:17.880
traditional price tag. Yeah. Well, I always wait for the game of the year edition, but, um, yeah.

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:24.120
So I think that should be like 29 99 at most, like that's ridiculous. Cause you're basically

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:31.400
saying that you have folks that paid $60 and they paid for that expansion pack to get the, um, the

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:38.280
extra characters or whatever. And now you have them pain again, like another $140 or whatever

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:41.640
was like honor 20 bucks for that game. I mean, come on. I'm going to, I'm going to give two

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:46.200
sides. I'm going to give two sides. Yeah. I do agree. $30 is a little expensive for me,

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:51.400
but for the more like hardcore mortal combat fans, I know the story in that game has typically

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:57.320
been very well done. So I think for a story expansion, some people may see the value in that,

01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:03.240
but I'm also of the mindset, like for me personally, I'm like, it'll be by the holidays.

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:09.160
This is cheaper. But like, I'm, I'm even saying like 29 99, that's including the story. I would

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:15.000
say like, if we're going to just forgo the story thing, maybe 1999, like I still think that's

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:21.880
ridiculous for the three characters. I mean, come on. Um, I did like that they added the friendships

01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:26.520
in the arena fatalities, which are pretty cool. I was going to say that part is free. So there's

01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:31.240
a free update coming at the same time and it will add new stages, including the classic Deadpool,

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:36.600
of course has a K, uh, the soul chamber. There will be new stage fatalities. If you're putting

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:40.840
the classic Deadpool in there, of course you gotta have the stage fatality and friendships are coming

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:44.840
back. And that's exciting. Like, uh, there was the one of scorpion. He goes, get over here. And

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:50.840
it's a big Teddy bear that he hugs. Uh, and then Kano had one where he was starting a barbecue with

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:58.520
his, um, eye laser and he's barbecuing. Uh, and then I saw one for sub zero where, um, it was,

01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:04.440
uh, an ice cream cart or something like that, or no, it was, it was, um, it was the night,

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:10.440
the nitro nitro nitrogen frozen thing. Cause that's all the rage, right? It was that.

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:17.800
So, and it's funny cause it's sub zero. So yeah. Anyway, I thought that was all pretty funny. So,

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:22.520
uh, yeah. And that actually, the funny thing is that kind of stuff makes me want to play these

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:27.880
newer mortal combat games. Cause I, you know, I don't care for like these fatalities are getting

01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:33.160
to be a little much like it was funny when it was comical, when it was like itchy and scratchy level

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:39.400
stuff like mortal combat two on the super Nintendo, that was fine. Now I'm like, this is a little too

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:46.200
real for me, but if I can just friendship everybody, I'm fine with that. So I might

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:50.280
actually be okay with this now that I can friendship everybody. Oh yes. That was that's

01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:54.360
right. Thank you. Johnny. We'll say points out another one. New, but was playing jump rope with

01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:58.680
his shadows. Yeah. That was really funny too. So I'm all about the friendships. I think they're

01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:07.240
great. So, all right, let's move on. Uh, Loki, what do you got for us? All right. Um, so we

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:15.320
have a few companies swapping their IPs. Uh, basically we've got a THQ Nordic and Koch media,

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:20.520
um, kind of shuffling around. So that's up according to, I believe what Bobby was saying

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:26.760
earlier that it's because the developer behind those games actually as a move companies or as

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:33.400
owned, I guess it says they're both owned by the same parent company and bracer group. Um, so

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:36.840
some of the stuff that's shifted around and I really don't know what this means

01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:43.320
necessarily for games coming out, but you've got, uh, red faction and painkiller going to,

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:54.840
um, I guess, uh, THQ Nordic. And then you've got, uh, looks like sacred risen rush for Berlin,

01:18:54.840 --> 01:19:04.200
second site and singles, flirt up your life. So those are, um, going, I'm sorry. Yeah. THQ

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:08.680
Newark is getting those last four and apparently Koch media is getting red faction and painkiller.

01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:14.600
All these games we have not seen games for in a while. So, yeah. Yeah. Kind of interesting

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:19.240
that these games might kind of get a new life through it. And also do we, I mean like THQ Nordic,

01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:24.040
like another, and I can't remember how this has all been passed down, but it was another company

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:29.320
completely that then bought the THQ name and is now like getting the THQ licenses back that were

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:33.800
with this other company. Right. Isn't that like a whole element to this? Yeah. So, yeah. So the,

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:39.080
basically one of the cool parts about it is apparently action is now back in control games.

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:45.160
I've had this like thing, this USB thing from an E3 with like demos from like the last E3 I went

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:50.920
to, which was years ago. It's Nordic games. It's THQ. Yeah. So, um, yeah, but now red

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.480
factions basically with volition now. So, you know, the original developers. So

01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:03.560
I'm all for a new, uh, new red faction game. Yeah. Uh, Questbuster in chat says I want a

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:10.760
new red faction along the lines of gorilla. So, uh, SGL 100, Matt says, I still have not played

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:15.160
any of them. It's that player that gets put in the trade to be waived afterwards. They're not going

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:19.800
to make that game, which I imagine is the, the, whatever that crazy title was you said there at

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:24.600
the end. So it's just, it's the throwaway one they put in there to just make it a little more value.

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:30.600
Oh yeah. The singles flirting up your life. That sounds like a mobile game for me.

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:36.760
But yeah, maybe that's where it ends up. It's a shitty mobile title. Maybe makes a few bucks.

01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:41.720
Fine. Whatever. But they probably won't do much with it otherwise. So, yeah. All right.

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:47.080
Well, moving on to something that's been getting some kind of like bigger headlines than just in

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:53.400
gaming blogs. And that has to do with the absence of Nintendo games. And the reason why I think, um,

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:58.120
it's picked up a lot of steam on other news blogs and you're seeing more mainstream coverage of it

01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:03.480
is because animal crossing is such a cuckoo bananas meme game right now at this point, like,

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:09.320
you know, so many people are playing it, um, that a lot of people are asking, well, what's next for

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:14.200
Nintendo? How is Nintendo going to follow up animal crossing? And the answer is we don't

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:18.680
really know. Like we know they're working on a breath of the wild too. We don't know when it's

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:23.080
coming out. We know that Xenoblade Chronicles, the remaster, and that's going to be awesome.

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:26.520
I'm excited about that. That's something that's going to happen by the end of the month,

01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:33.320
but we don't know like exactly, um, when thank you. Alan's putting coffee down. He knows I need it.

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:39.000
Thank you. All right. Um, so we, we, uh, we don't know like when this is happening. So what is

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:45.640
Nintendo's plan over the next, you know, a little while. So, um, there was a Nintendo investor Q and

01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:52.200
a session and, uh, some tweets that relay what a CEO Shuntura Furukawa said, uh, during this

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:57.160
event says that there are other undisclosed titles set to be released this year. Hello.

01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:00.760
We all kind of knew that, right? They usually announce things for the holidays in June. I

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:07.240
don't think this is a huge surprise, but the Corona virus pandemic could impact development

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:12.360
as developers are currently working from home. Here's a series of tweets from the account

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:18.520
Cephason talking about, uh, the relaying from the Nintendo, uh, Q and a session

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:24.840
Nintendo president and CEO Shuntura Furukawa says that although the Chinese factory suspended

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:30.520
shipments of Nintendo switches in February, Japan faced delays in putting new units on shelves.

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:36.200
However, the impact on overall business has been minor so far. He mentions there are other titles

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:40.680
they plan to release this year in addition to those already announced. However, it may

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:45.640
be difficult to finish development during the current situation as employees are working from

01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:53.880
home. Their forecast assumes they will release as planned. So that could make the E3 direct or

01:22:53.880 --> 01:23:00.920
whatever you want to call it. It could make it very interesting, right? Because they may announce

01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:05.560
games and not tell us when they're coming. And I think that should be something we're fully ready

01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:11.080
for. Like they're going to announce games, but they're not going to say, Oh, holiday this year

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:15.560
or, Oh, it's not happening. Or it's a, you know, quarter one next year. I think they're just going

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:22.040
to say coming soon, coming soon, soon, unless it's a game that like already is like, damn,

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:26.440
you're done. Like maybe they had some games that are in like, it's going to be out today

01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:32.760
type of status. Then maybe those games will come out. But I, uh, I don't know. We'll see.

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:38.840
So anyway, there you go. Nintendo. Yes, they're working on new games. Of course they are. They

01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:43.160
were probably going to announce them in June, but this whole situation has screwed everything up.

01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:46.600
So there you go. In the meantime, please look forward to more Animal Crossing.

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:53.320
All right. Let's go back to a classic time and take a step back a little bit. Let's go back to

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:59.160
a time when there was no pandemic. Let's go back 10 years or more and visit a classic game of the

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:03.400
week. Every week, typically dark soccer will step into the gaming vault and find a game that she

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:07.720
thinks, Hey, you guys should check this game out this week. Obviously, as we know, dark soccer is

01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:11.640
dealing with some more important things this week, so she can't be here to pick the game. Uh,

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:16.680
and last week we had Alan pick the game for us, which was really cool this week. Uh, Loki,

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:20.360
it's been a while since we've heard from you and had you pick a game in Jamie's absence.

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:23.560
I think it's your turn to pick the classic game of the week. So what are you gonna pick for us

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:31.880
tonight? So my pick this week is Duke Nukem 3D. Good pick. I, I'm kind of surprised we haven't

01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:40.360
picked this before. I'm so shocked. All right. Well, there it is. So Duke Nukem 3D was released

01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:49.480
in on PC, January 29th, 1996, uh, as shareware. And then of course the full version of the game

01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:57.880
came out later on April 19th. Um, yes. Share were love that stuff. Um, of course there was

01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:03.160
three campaigns that were included with that, but later on they released a plutonium pack,

01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:08.280
which is an expansion to the game. They added a fourth campaign as well and some additional

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:14.360
things to that. So of course the shareware version of the game, um, you had the first original

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:23.400
episode, which was episode one, uh, LA meltdown. And then of course episode two, a lunar apocalypse

01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:29.560
that was, uh, in the full version. And then episode three shrapnel city. And then in the

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:36.040
atomic edition they had episode four, uh, birth. And then one of the things about Duke Nukem was

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:43.080
it was pretty cutting edge for the, the game engine. So it was built off of this build 3d

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:49.480
engine, which was, um, developed from 3d realms and it could do a lot of things that like doom

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:56.520
couldn't do necessarily. Um, so it added a lot of new gameplay features to it. One of the things

01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:02.520
though with Duke Nukem cause originally Duke Nukem was this old side scrolling, uh, kind of

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:09.000
action game, a side scrolling platform game. So they of course, you know, brought it out

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:16.520
kind of this ultraviolet crass, uh, game. And so of course it got in trouble with some of the

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:22.920
retailers out there for, you know, having pixelated strippers in there or just, you know,

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:30.040
poop jokes and bad language and all that kind of stuff. Um, of course one of the main, um,

01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:38.680
selling points of Duke Nukem is John St. John who voices Duke Nukem himself. And, um, really,

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:47.000
I mean, I played a ton of this just, I remember I actually, I own the game, the full version of it.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:52.200
Then I was building levels for it because you could actually use, there was a level editor that

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:57.560
was, I think included with the game and you could go in there and like build your own levels out

01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:02.840
and actually play them in game and play them even in multiplayer. Uh, which it was one of the first

01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:07.080
games to offer a multiplayer over the internet, which is pretty cool. Of course we always just

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:14.600
do it through LAN and, um, yeah, so lots of cool stuff. Uh, some of the other fun things about

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:19.400
Duke Nukem was all the different expansion packs you could buy. So this was the kind of thing you

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:23.560
would see, you know, in your Babbage's or software, et cetera, or whatever, they would have all these

01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:30.120
expansion packs where folks would create brand new campaigns that would either, uh, total conversion

01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:38.040
the game or just add to it. Uh, so they had Duke's Caribbean life's a beach, uh, Duke nuclear winter.

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:45.480
I think I had Duke it out in DC and there was a Duke Nukem's penthouse paradise, stuff like that.

01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:51.800
Um, of course each campaign of the actual game had a lot of parodies of different, uh, pop culture

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:57.640
things. So of course, you know, with, uh, the atomic edition, I remember there was a level in

01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:03.480
there that was very much it's, uh, babe land, which is just like Disneyland. So they even

01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:08.360
had like a pirates of the Caribbean ride and stuff like that. Of course, you know, there's pig cops

01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:13.720
everywhere. Um, there's lots of different lines in the game that were drawn from like aliens,

01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:20.040
dirty Harry evil dead to full metal jacket, jaws, pulp fiction, and they live. Um,

01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:26.600
there's all sorts of parodies for like Shawshank redemption, uh, 2001 space Odyssey,

01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:31.560
I mean, it was just full of pop culture references and even some that are kind of

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:38.840
dated nowadays, like they have the Exxon Valdez in there, which no one remembers that. Um, but yeah.

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:44.680
And then of course, um, even more recently, we just got an episode five alien world order,

01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:50.360
and that was with the 20th anniversary world tour, uh, that was just released. And of course,

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:56.040
Duke Nukem has been released so many times, uh, different console ports. Of course you had it on

01:28:56.040 --> 01:29:05.560
the Sega Saturn, a total meltdown on PlayStation Duke Nukem 64. There was, um, Duke Nukem on three

01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:13.400
on the Xbox. It's been on mobile phones and the Nokia, um, PlayStation, you know, it's been

01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:17.560
everywhere. And then of course they even had some source ports that came out later on. So

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:24.440
that's where you get the E Duke, um, and then some other enhancements with that. So it's,

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:28.920
it's still pretty, uh, I think there's still quite a bit of content being put out for there

01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:33.960
and thank God it's, it's actually a pretty great game. I'm like Duke Nukem forever, but

01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:41.080
I don't know. That's why it's my classic game of the week and definitely well deserved. I think,

01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:47.400
no, this is, this is a very good pick and, um, I, yeah, it is, it is deserved. I played a shitload

01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:50.600
of this in college. I know I've told this story on the show before humor me. I'm gonna tell it

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:58.280
one more time. Um, of many, uh, I, I played this game in the college dorms a lot in, um, college

01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:03.320
and we, because we were all in the dorms, every room had their own phone line and everything was

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:07.640
connected on the internet via phone back then. So I remember I would play this game and then

01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:11.640
my neighbor who was also a bit of a computer nerd would sign on and play this game. We would call

01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:15.880
each other on the dial up and we would play versus, and the other guys in the dorm used to

01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:19.960
love to like, they would run into one room and see where I'm at and then go run in there and tell

01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:25.080
them where I'm at and then they do the same thing like vice versa. So it was kind of like a land

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:29.480
thing actually in a way, in a weird way, but in the dorm setting, which as you know, is like very,

01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:34.520
you know, compact and tight. Those dorm rooms are very small. So, uh, yeah, like I have a lot of fond

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:38.120
memories of playing this game as a result. And then of course with all the level editors,

01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:43.720
you know, this was the first Mario maker of sorts, if you will, for some people was kind of like

01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:49.480
making their own Duke Nukem levels. Um, which Wolf Wolfenstein and Doom kind of went through

01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:52.040
a similar thing. So it's kind of like all these games around the same time, you know?

01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:57.480
Yeah. And I, I had actually made some, like I said, some levels in it as well. One of the levels

01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:03.800
that I made that was kind of ridiculous was this whole, I think I made like this like flooded city

01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:08.680
thing. And I remember there was one that I made also that was like a big water slide that just

01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:14.600
looped around. And so one of the things you could do in the game is a raise and lower floors with

01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:20.280
like the page up, page down keys. There's no limit to how long you can lower that floor.

01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:26.040
Yeah. So I put a paperweight on the page down and I went and had lunch for an hour and came back

01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:30.760
and it had like a 15 minute drop in the game, which is hilarious. That's amazing. Um,

01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:35.720
so yeah, good times. There you go. Uh, there it is your classic of the week, Duke Nukem, which,

01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:41.480
um, you can easily check out on like steam, like, you know, there's a, or even a Google games has

01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:46.200
it as well. I mean, there's all sorts of additions that are out there. It's always on sale. Um,

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:50.520
there's, I think there's still a lot of people even making modded levels and stuff today. And

01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:55.560
I am pretty sure there's probably some more fancier versions of Duke Nukem that people

01:31:55.560 --> 01:32:03.240
are modded in. Like I, I won't, won't be surprised when I see Ray tracing and Duke Nukem three.

01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:10.120
So, uh, bonds to bonds, double six and chat says, LOL. So Rob invented land in college. No,

01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:13.960
I didn't invent. I'm not like trying to say I invented the internet. I said it was like

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:21.240
land. Uh, and VG realness says, well, she is that old. So it's possible. Rude. Rude as hell.

01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:25.560
You didn't have to do that. Uh, let's see. Uh, as she went under, Matt says someone made a

01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:31.400
Duke Nukem level of the dorm floors at school that became a local Fox news, angry parents segment.

01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:39.000
Oh no, I can, I see it though. I, I, I feel like I tried to recreate a building. I knew in one of

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:43.800
the, yeah, we tried to recreate our neighborhood too at one point, but it's, it's hard to,

01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:50.440
it's hard to, one of the limitations that you had with, um, or the build engine is you can't have,

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:55.720
and this may have been just an initial like build stuff. So Duke Nukem era, not necessarily in,

01:32:55.720 --> 01:33:01.000
um, some of the other games that they made with that, but you couldn't have floors above floors.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.000
And so you couldn't really create like a two story house or something like that. You have to have it

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:09.560
just solid floors and there's like tricks you could do to kind of like get around some of that

01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:15.720
stuff. But it, it's still, it was kind of limiting what you could do with it. Now there's further

01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:21.320
games that made a use of the build engine and enhanced it. So like, I remember redneck rampage

01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:28.120
was one that I played a lot of and, um, Oh gosh, there was some other games that they use that as

01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:33.640
well that added more features to it. That's why you have these newer versions of like Duke Nukem

01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:39.960
or whatever that utilize these more updated, uh, build engines to add a whole lot of features

01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:45.960
that weren't in the original game in the first place. All right. Lots of, yeah, it's just the

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:50.200
way people have expanded on this game over the years and it's still kind of relevant in many

01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:54.840
ways. It's just, yeah, it's, it's a true classic. I'm glad you picked it. Good job. All right. And

01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:58.360
even if dark soccer isn't a big fan of first person shooters, I feel like she, she, she,

01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:02.280
even she can recognize that this is, this is something that is deserving. Hey, at least it's

01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:08.280
not halo. There's that. All right. Uh, let's move on. We have some rapid fire news, some other

01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:13.160
things to talk about quickly. Um, and then we'll get back into some more news, lots more news to

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:17.960
talk about and, uh, get your, uh, comments in our, uh, just, uh, get your comments on in our chat

01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:23.720
room over at twitch.tv slash vog network before the night is over. Uh, let's get to the rapid

01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:31.080
fire news. Loki. So whereas we had, um, Elijah would visiting folks in animal crossing last week.

01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:37.960
Now we have representative Alexandria, um, Ocasio-Cortez visiting folks in animal crossing

01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:43.160
as well. Lots of people are getting around in animal crossing. So, uh, that was something

01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:48.600
that she had posted on Twitter and there's some screenshots of people, you know, having her visit

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:52.920
their town and stuff like that. So that's kind of fun. Uh, lots of creative stuff I've been seeing

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:58.040
with, uh, animal crossing as well. Just, um, you know, folks even like, uh, we had like,

01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:04.280
you know, sports teams, like advertising things, um, that were using animal crossing for like,

01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:08.760
almost like little skits and stuff. So I saw something with like our local Sacramento Kings

01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:15.480
team and there was one for, um, I can't remember which baseball team it was, but, uh, yeah,

01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:19.560
good stuff that they have lots of, uh, folks out there. Something else to consider, something else

01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:25.880
to consider about, um, AOC and, you know, I, I realized she's a very polarizing political figure,

01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:30.040
whatever, but the thing to remember about politicians, they really are just like us.

01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:35.400
And, you know, with AOC, she, she likes drag race. She likes video games like animal crossing.

01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:40.120
She's not that different from a lot of people her age that, you know, I think we know. And I know,

01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:43.480
again, I've told this story on the show before and I probably don't need to tell it again,

01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:47.800
but I used to date a politician that ran for office. And trust me, if there's one thing I

01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:54.680
learned from that relationship, any idiot can run for office. Okay. So, you know, uh, it's,

01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:58.360
even though it's kind of one of those things was like, Ooh, a politician is playing animal

01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:02.680
crossing. They're real people. You know, same thing with the celebrities with like Elijah,

01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:07.640
what they're real people. They're all locked up at home too. So here's something that's pretty great

01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:12.280
that I saw that, um, someone had offered her to do on there. And I don't know if she took them

01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:19.800
up on that, but apparently someone has talk show that they set up in animal crossing called animal

01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:25.960
talking, like a talk show set and stuff like that. And they do like interviews or whatever over,

01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:30.440
you know, whatever voice chat that they have in there. But I thought that was kind of cute.

01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:31.560
That's a cute idea. Yeah.

01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:39.880
Anyway. And then, um, let's see. So aside from animal crossing news, of course, you know,

01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:47.720
I'm big into the Lego games. And so it leaked out that the Lego star Wars, the Skywalker saga will

01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:55.240
be coming out October 20th. And that was thanks to a, uh, Disney YouTube channel video that they

01:36:55.240 --> 01:37:03.080
had for the game. Although it did get pulled. So I don't know if they were jumping the gun on

01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:09.000
announcing that, but apparently, you know, it is coming out this year. So I wouldn't be surprised

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:17.960
to see it, uh, sometime this fall. All right. Well, but there's no star Wars movie this year,

01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:23.080
right? No, no, no. And this is basically kind of a culmination of like all of the,

01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:28.280
the whole nine movies. Oh, okay. I gotcha. All right. All right. All right. Well,

01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:33.640
moving on to some other, uh, news, we have some new modes for bloodstained ritual of the night,

01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:38.040
the game that is not Castlevania symphony of the night, but it does have some similarities,

01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:42.840
doesn't it? Uh, there's going to be a big update for bloodstain to coming to the switch in may or

01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:47.320
June. And I imagine it's coming to other platforms around the same time as well. Uh, the dev team has

01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:51.640
said, they're looking into locking a release date for this update. And once it's confirmed,

01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:57.080
they'll have it out there. The details for what's in the update, Zangetsu will become a playable

01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:01.480
character. And that's going to be a little bit different, uh, because it's, you know, Zangetsu

01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:05.400
will not have the same type of movement and combat abilities that Miriam has. So it'll be using a

01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:09.560
sword. So it'll play a little differently. Uh, but then this other mode sounds pretty cool,

01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:14.040
a randomizer mode. So they're actually going to build an official randomizer into the game

01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:17.960
where you can adjust eight different parameters of the game to mix up the experience.

01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:23.800
Uh, you can mix up, save and warp rooms, shops, key items, enemy drops. Uh, that's going to be

01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:29.480
very interesting. And, uh, I think we'll make for all sorts of fun speed runs for that. So very

01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:36.360
cool. Uh, and speaking of switch things coming to other consoles, uh, a PlayStation four version of

01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:42.200
blaster master zero two has apparently been looked at and, or has apparently been spotted

01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:46.840
on the PlayStation store, like a placeholder for it. So, uh, that has not officially been

01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:52.920
announced by the developer. Um, but it's been about a year. Again, this is blaster master zero

01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:57.960
two. So remember they like redid blaster master on the switch and then they did a blast. They

01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:06.040
did a sequel to the remake basically. And it's pretty good. They did a very good job of those

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:12.440
games. Like I, I, I, I hope more people get to play them. So, uh, they came out on PC in steam

01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:17.800
in November. Uh, it was on the switch in March and now apparently going to be on its way to,

01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:23.000
um, PlayStation four as well. I wonder if the original will come with it. Cause I don't think

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.800
the original, the original is on PC and the original was on 3DS as well. Uh, I don't think

01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:32.680
the original was on, but I could be wrong. I don't think the original was on PlayStation store.

01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:36.280
So it'd be interesting to see if it's kind of comes in like a combo pack or something. We'll see.

01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:41.080
So there you go. Some rapid fire news. Let's travel around the world and look at some world

01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:48.520
release dates or lack thereof. Um, now I have quite a few actually. So let's see. We've got

01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:56.840
star Wars one, um, racer and that's coming out on Nintendo switch. Um, we have deep rock galactic

01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:04.360
on PC and Xbox one, two per mega baseball three on PC, Nintendo switch PlayStation four and Xbox one.

01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:08.600
And I swear to God, I didn't even plan the classic game of the week to go along with this,

01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:14.840
but I guess the timing is great. So coming from 3d realms, ion theory on Nintendo switch,

01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:20.120
PlayStation four and Xbox one. This game also uses the build engine that was used in Duke

01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:25.400
Nukem 3d. Of course, now 20 years later and even more enhanced, but still in that same style of

01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:32.360
Duke Nukem three, uh, we have Hatsune Miku project, Eva mega mix on Nintendo switch. And that's it.

01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:37.720
What timing on that? Very good. All right. Uh, going to Japan, which by the way, uh,

01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:42.440
interesting comment on discord that, um, sheds a lot of light. Cause last week I was kind of like

01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:46.440
the Japanese releases have kind of dried up. There's not a lot coming out. It was pointed out

01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:50.520
that the Japanese rating board, remember we talked about a couple of weeks ago on the show. I think

01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:55.560
it was like the ESRB was working from home or something, but the Japanese one, the CRO,

01:40:55.560 --> 01:41:00.520
they closed down for a little bit. So that's why we haven't had as many Japanese. They can't rate

01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:04.760
the games. So that's why we haven't seen as many things. And I would have thought, Oh, well maybe

01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:09.240
they rated them way out in advance, but it doesn't always happen that way. Um, so thank you. That

01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:14.840
was a very good call out on discord, but we do have a few things that snuck through, um, this

01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:18.840
one probably because it's a repackaging maybe they didn't have to re rate it. I don't know,

01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:25.080
but it's the dragon quest X or dragon quest 10 all in one package versions one through five will

01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:30.520
come out on the switch this week on may 14th. So that's kinda like a re repackaging. And of course

01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:36.200
that is also coming out, um, on the PlayStation four, uh, one other minor release this week,

01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:42.680
AO tennis two on the PlayStation four. Uh, the AO does not mean adults only. Sorry. Uh,

01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:48.200
that's just the name of it. Uh, and I'm not sure the company behind this, um, but it is like,

01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:53.320
it's a real, it's like a realistic tennis simulator game is very disappointed. Yeah,

01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:57.800
no, it is not adults only. Uh, sorry about that, but it does, it looks very realistic,

01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:02.120
you know, as far as like tennis Sims go. Um, so that's pretty cool there. That's it for

01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:05.720
Japanese releases and an explanation why we're probably seeing a lot less of them.

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:11.320
How about the UK low key? Anything? Not much. Uh, we've got budget cuts coming out on PlayStation

01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:19.320
VR. Um, the persistence on PlayStation four and also, I'm sorry, we have persistence on

01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:27.400
X-Box one and intended switch as well. And that's it. All righty. Well, let's get to the mailbag

01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:32.760
because every week we read your guys's emails participate at orange lounge radio.com is the

01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:37.160
place to send those emails and we will read them on the show. Of course, usually

01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:44.680
I should have these emails up in advance, but I didn't do that tonight because I'm an idiot. Um,

01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:47.880
Oh boy. Now it's telling me the password is invalid. Hold on.

01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:52.600
Oh fuck. I know I'm getting it right.

01:42:55.080 --> 01:43:00.200
Oh, help me buy time. Loki. All right. What are you looking forward to an iron maiden?

01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:05.240
Uh, well, I w I'm just curious to see what the game looks like. There was,

01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:09.480
I I'm getting confused. There's another one that's also kind of like a retro shooter.

01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:14.520
That's basically the symbolized or simple pixelized sprites and everything, but they have

01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:18.120
like advanced lighting with it. And I can't remember if that was iron maiden or another one.

01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:23.960
I think that's a different one. Um, I'm just, I want to kind of check it out. I need to go back

01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:29.640
and just play like Duke Nukem and stuff like that. Um, I think when I used to play those

01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:34.680
originally, I used like the old gravis pads. I never really got into like keyword mouse with

01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:40.840
that stuff, but I don't know. I'll have to check out and see how that game is. And hopefully it's

01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:45.720
not too expensive, but great job buying time. Loki. Uh, I got it. All right. Good. Thank you.

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:50.920
All right, here we go. Uh, first email tonight from Robert M who emailed us at participate

01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:55.880
at orangeandrea.com to say little disappointed, but understand the circumstances that we didn't

01:43:55.880 --> 01:44:01.960
get to hear Jamie reacting to the release of the Neo Geo pocket color game SNK gals fighters on the

01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:07.640
switch got me to dig out my old unit and change the batteries for the first time in over 15 years.

01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:12.120
Here's hoping for match of the millennium. Well, unfortunately, you know, with what I said earlier

01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:16.360
in the show, it probably will be a little bit before dark soccer gets to it. Um, but we will

01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:19.640
make sure to pass along the message and ask her if she's even, she may not even be aware that it

01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:23.880
came out on switch, but she would probably also go, well, I could just go play the real thing.

01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:28.520
So maybe she did this week. You did remind me though, my Neo Geo mini. Yeah. I didn't get

01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:31.480
around to even using it yet because now I want to order one of the controllers

01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:36.120
because I don't want to have to play with a tiny little joystick that it came with.

01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:40.040
It doesn't work. I don't think gals fighters is on it though. Sadly,

01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:44.120
but thank you for the reminder that it came out on the switch.

01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:52.680
All right. One more email tonight from Y Y R our power. Y Y R hello. L R when Rob mentioned

01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:57.240
trying streets of rage four on last week's show, he mentioned that the game had an online co-op

01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:04.200
for the first time in the series. Well, actually I'm just going to mention the excellent Sega

01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:11.160
vintage collection streets of rage that released on X-Box three 60 back in 2012. Yeah, I forgot

01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:16.280
about it. Sorry. Developed by M2. It features both the international and Japanese releases of

01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:21.400
all three games in the original trilogy, and also features online co-op in all three games.

01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:25.880
Plus it has a music player, a challenge mode, leaderboards, and all the trimmings you'd find

01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:31.880
in similar collections. Best of all, it's backwards compatible on X-Box one and only cost $10. So you

01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:36.040
can enjoy it right now and there's no need to wait for a sale. Anyways, thanks for the show issue. And

01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:42.200
it's fine. Even though I'm, I'm rolling my eyes a little bit at this. Well, actually that I'm,

01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:48.120
I'm being explained to right now. Uh, it's, it's fine. I did forget about the release and the

01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:52.200
minute you kind of like said it, I'm like, Oh yeah, I even played that fucking game.

01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:59.560
And I totally forgot. So it's fine. Um, I never did online in it. So that's what caused me to forget

01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:04.680
anyway. Uh, but good call out. Thanks for the show as usual. I'm sure that I can speak for

01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:09.320
many of the listeners. When I say that we're looking for distractions nowadays, thank you

01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:14.600
for helping provide a diversion for a few hours every week from the near constant stream of bad

01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:19.960
news. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Warm regards and well, well wishes Y Y R. Well,

01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:24.280
thank you for that very kind comment there at the end. Um, we're happy to do so. It gives,

01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:28.440
it gives me something to look forward to do as well. So it's like, and it's nice because like,

01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:32.920
since I know I'm going to be on camera, it's like, all right, I'm going to have to put on pants

01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:38.200
today. I'm going to have to take a shower. I'm going to have to find nice hat to wear to hide

01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:43.240
all this mess of hair that I have going on right now. So it's, uh, it, it helps me go through the

01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:48.520
motions, even on a weekend and try to keep some sense of a normal routine. So thank you guys for

01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:53.480
showing up here and giving a crap and motivating us to do it. We really appreciate it. So

01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:59.960
participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send your emails in a future week. If

01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:05.800
you would like to have them read on the show. All right. Uh, bonds double six says, well,

01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:11.240
actually, Rob, you're wrong. Let me tell you how Rob got mansplained. Yes, I sure did. But you know

01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:16.920
what? Luckily I know why YR is, is a well-intentioned guy and he's, he's very polite

01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:23.080
and how he does it. So I, I will allow it to happen this one time. All right, let's move on.

01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:29.160
Uh, let's get to some more news. Loki, not surprised about this next one, how fast it came and went

01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:35.960
right. Uh, yeah, not too surprised. So apparently there's been this, uh, project that's been going

01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:43.720
on for awhile. So it's a recompilation, um, project for Mario 64. So basically they were,

01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:48.760
um, taking the raw source code for Mario 64. And I don't know, I believe that they were

01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:53.560
reverse engineering all of that. And then once they got it down to the raw source code, they then

01:47:53.560 --> 01:48:02.440
use modern compilers to compile the game for other systems, including mainly the PC. So allowing them

01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:10.440
to basically use, um, you know, DirectX 12 or OpenGL to port the game over to PC where it runs

01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:19.800
natively with, you know, controller support and widescreen and 4k and stuff like that. So pretty,

01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:25.160
pretty cool. Unfortunately, like something like that, that would get so much attention.

01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:31.400
It has been, um, it's being yanked off the internet, uh, thanks to Nintendo and they are

01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:36.520
seeking their lawyers on these sites that are hosting these files. And apparently they're

01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:40.920
shutting down YouTube and that kind of stuff as well. Yeah. They're, they're showing folks that

01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:47.240
are, um, displaying gameplay from it. And so I have a theory, I have a theory on that. I have

01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:50.200
a theory that goes a little deeper on that, but, but is there something else to this too? You want

01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:57.480
to mention or, um, no, that's pretty much it really. Um, yeah, that they, they basically had

01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:03.000
these versions or whatever that were out there. Um, but you know, now you can't do that. Um,

01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:09.080
I did also find around the same time though, that there was also a web version of Mario 64 that you

01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:12.600
can play as well, which I thought was pretty cool. And it ran great. I was messing around with that

01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:18.440
with my, uh, Xbox controller, but that's, that's the one that I looked at. And I thought, I thought

01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:22.920
at first it was like the same thing, um, which I'm not going to give you the URL, but it's very

01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:28.680
easily Googleable. So have fun. Um, but, uh, yeah, I was playing that and it was interesting because

01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:32.120
it suffered a little bit, like it was nice and all, but it suffered a little bit from that same

01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:36.120
criticism. I had a final fantasy eight earlier where it's like, look at these very lovely

01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:41.800
textures, like very weirdly put together. That's the same one. Or if that's just like an emulator,

01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:46.840
that may just be an emulator. I think it is. I think it is. I think it is, but it's so fun and

01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:53.000
it has saves. And so you can do that, but, um, so let's, sorry, let's talk about Nintendo taking

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.880
down the YouTubes because I think there's a lot of people going, that's too far. That's stupid. Why

01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:04.440
are they doing that? Um, go back to those rumors from a couple of weeks ago that Nintendo is

01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:10.440
planning a Mario onslaught for later this year or next year at this rate. Um, and one of those games

01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:16.760
that they are talking about is their own HD remaster. Now, certainly, um, if Nintendo is

01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:21.080
working on their own HD remaster, you can completely understand why they would yank this

01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:25.400
other version that's being done. They were going to do that anyway, because we know how Nintendo

01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:31.080
always goes with IP, but why would they go after the YouTubes as well? Because if Nintendo is about

01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:36.680
to announce their own product, they don't want footage of that other thing getting mistaken for

01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:41.960
what they're doing. Well, that's my, that's my bet on why they're doing it. They just doing it

01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:46.440
because they can, I mean, there's no repercussions for them doing that because they've done that in

01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:50.520
the past about like, remember they used to have the whole thing where you had to sign up with

01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:55.480
them in order to have YouTube content for any of their games to be, otherwise you just flag it and

01:50:55.480 --> 01:51:01.080
kick it off the internet. Um, yeah, it very well could be low key, but I feel like it's one of

01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:07.240
those, they've got their own plans for Mario 64 and they want to control the message and they do

01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:10.920
not, like, I think that's why they're going a little further with this where I feel like there's

01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:17.560
other Nintendo projects and weird Nintendo fan things. Like for example, that YouTube of the guy

01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:22.680
that, God, what was it? He put the Mario cartoon into a Mario game. You remember that from about

01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:28.840
six months ago? Nintendo didn't shut that down. Yeah. That wasn't something he released.

01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:34.920
Right. Right. But they didn't yank the YouTube Loki. That's my point. I there's a difference

01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:38.520
here and like how fast that's just, you know, and again, it might just, you're right. Loki.

01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:43.960
It might just be Nintendo is just totally controlling their IP. They don't want people

01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:48.920
to be making money on YouTube off this because they don't have a right to it's a, it's a pirate

01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:53.000
piece of software. You're right. Loki. That may completely be it. But I just, I can't shake this

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:57.880
feeling that the reason why they're doing this so fast and they're doing it so much and stuff on

01:51:57.880 --> 01:52:03.000
YouTube is because they're about to put their own YouTubes out there of an HD Mario. And they do not

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:09.240
want this. Sorry to the developers, but what Nintendo views as a second rate version of the

01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:15.000
game to get confused with it. And that's why they're yanking the YouTubes. Maybe walk. See,

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:20.040
I guess, uh, Bobby Blackwell says if they don't take it down, then a different company can

01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:24.360
actually do it and make money on it because, well, you didn't shut down that fan's version.

01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:29.480
Well, for, for the, the actual game itself. Yes. But we've, we've again, I just cited a YouTube

01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:35.160
project. They never took down. So there's like, I feel like things kind of exist in the YouTube

01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:41.080
form and these other places that Nintendo doesn't shut down so quickly. If that makes sense.

01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:46.680
So I don't know. Anyway, uh, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, Disney does the same thing with their

01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:51.400
IPs. Uh, Rip Cycle says you got to slap down people using your IP or it becomes slippery to

01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:56.520
defend. Uh, Johnny Wu-Fei says just like the Mario removal in dreams, but there's still Mario

01:52:56.520 --> 01:53:03.240
stuff in Roblox, right? I'm pretty sure that there there's Mario's there. Roblox has all sorts of IP

01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:09.720
theft in there. It's it's I don't play Roblox, so I couldn't tell you offhand. I mean, I could boot

01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:14.680
it up and take a look, I guess, but no, I don't. I'm sure it's there. I'm sure it's there. All

01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:21.160
right. You know, when anybody is presented with a creator of some sort, someone is going to recreate

01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:27.080
World 1-1. It's just an iconic piece of level design. It's always going to be copied. So,

01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:32.760
all right. Anyhow, moving on. Let's, uh, talk about some other stories. Oh,

01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:39.320
yeah. Y'all want some more rumors? Cause I got some more rumors for you. Uh, rumors outside of EA

01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:46.040
as to what is happening over there. And, uh, apparently, uh, this is a resource that comes

01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:49.160
from, actually, I'm just going to go to the original source here. Um, I hate it when I go

01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:53.560
to a news article and it's just like, here's, we're just rewriting what VentureBeat said about

01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:57.960
this whole thing or whatever the website is. In this case, it is VentureBeat. Um, so VentureBeat

01:53:57.960 --> 01:54:03.160
is saying that, uh, EA gave investors an overview of what's coming up for the next fiscal year.

01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:08.200
So the fiscal year runs from, you know, March to, or April to the end of March. So this is

01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:13.160
everything through March, 2021. 14 games are apparently in the works, but they are still

01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:16.360
going to be working on, of course, like apex legends and games that have done very well for

01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:21.160
them. Those kinds of like always giving types of games. They start to name some of the games,

01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:26.920
Burnout Paradise Remastered on Nintendo Switch, Command and Conquer Remastered PC,

01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:32.840
Medal of Honor VR. We know all these games, right? Madden 21, duh, NHL 21, of course,

01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:40.600
unannounced sports game, an HD remake of an EA game. And then 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 are all

01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:46.360
EA. Oh, excuse me. 9, 10, 11, 12, our EA partner game, 13, 14, our EA mobile game.

01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:52.840
And what is really funny about this article, the very last paragraph. Oh, and that HD remaster of

01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:57.560
an EA game is the Mass Effect trilogy. Just don't expect that to also launch on Switch,

01:54:57.560 --> 01:55:01.240
just not at first. Oh yeah. And some of these games are coming out for Switch. Like they're

01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:05.880
saying apex legends, uh, possibly on the Switch and so forth. But it's very funny how they kind

01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:09.800
of dropped that little bombshell right at the end. By the way, it's totally the Mass Effect

01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:18.600
trilogy that is the, uh, uh, remastered thing. Um, I have heard this same thing from people I

01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:24.360
know that know people. So, you know, take, take it what you will. It obviously would also make a lot

01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:29.800
of sense. I think a lot of fans have been begging for it. Take us back. I'm one of them. Take us

01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:33.480
back to the Mass Effect we all know and love. I think there's a lot of people that would really

01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:38.840
love if this came out on the Switch, who knows if it will. Um, for me, I kind of like, well,

01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:44.920
at this point, I'd like to see it on PlayStation 5 and Xbox One Series X, but if these consoles

01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:48.600
are going to play the older stuff anyway, then fine, whatever. And it's going to be a very

01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:54.360
interesting chance to maybe, uh, remake some of the things that were a problem in one.

01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:59.080
Not that I'm expecting like a full H. I'm just expecting like, you know, kind of like the general,

01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:04.200
like, uh, zhuzhing up of some of the textures. Like I'm not expecting the game to get completely

01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:08.680
overhauled. I imagine all the DLC will be included and all that good stuff, but I'm not expecting,

01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:14.280
like, a huge, huge overhaul, but maybe with the first game, they might have an opportunity to do

01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:20.440
things like, um, well, they can really clean that one up. Um, that's for sure. It's official HD mods.

01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:24.680
Basically those of you that have been playing on PC probably already using HD mods. This will just

01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:30.440
be official HD mods, um, and master, but they can also fix like the, the driving sequences, the

01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:35.000
Mako. They can fix a lot of that stuff. And a really good one that came up on Twitter that I

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:41.320
was like, oh, that's a really good one. They could restore the Kayden romance in one, uh,

01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:45.720
the same sex romance that they originally cut and all the dialogue is still in the game and

01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:50.280
people like unpatched it and unlocked it. They could restore that. And I think that would be

01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:55.320
very interesting, um, to restore that. And maybe, maybe there's some other, um, things that they cut

01:56:55.320 --> 01:57:00.200
that they could kind of put back in the game like that. So again, I don't know how much time or how

01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:05.640
much effort they're putting into this, that I don't know. Um, but Mass Effect trilogy, it's

01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:11.880
almost certain to be announced, um, throughout this summer events with what's going on. So,

01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:19.800
um, let's see bonds, double six says no Sims news. Uh, they remain committed to the Sims.

01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:23.960
What is it? The Sims four, right? Is the current one. Uh, and kind of like those always, they,

01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:28.680
there'll be more Sims expansions. I'm sure, uh, tiger class says knowing Rob, he'll buy this

01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:33.000
remaster. Like he buys every version of the Mass Effect trilogy. This is like Star Wars all over

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:39.480
again with the rereleases. You bet your ass. Uh, as she went on her, Matt says Mass Effect one does

01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:44.760
need some cleaning up some parts of that don't age well, graphically. It is on an Xbox, Xbox game pass

01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:49.960
if you want to check it out, but yeah, it, it just, it needs, it just needs a little like the

01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:54.920
first game is where they could make the most improvements to bring it in line with the second

01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:59.400
and third games. And I think that would be a very solid trilogy package. And I really hope they keep

01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:04.360
the multiplayer from three in there. And I would love it if they would, you know, enhance that a

01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:08.360
little, give us some new enemies to fight in there. Maybe I know this is going to be controversial,

01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:12.680
but bring in some of the stuff from Andromeda, which I know makes no lore sense whatsoever,

01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:16.280
but whatever it's multiplayer, bring in some of the stuff from Andromeda to have us fight in the

01:58:16.280 --> 01:58:20.520
Mass Effect three multiplayer. I think that'd be really fun. So, um, let's see, we'll see,

01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:25.400
we'll see some of the details. Um, when this inevitably gets announced over the summer

01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:30.280
and I'm very excited about it. All right. So, uh, Loki, what do you have next for us?

01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:39.080
Um, okay. So let's see, we've got some information about a Fortnite player who's been banned from

01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:44.600
playing competitively. Now this Fortnite player was only nine years old and was playing a guest

01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:51.160
in, uh, was playing arena, which I guess isn't a tournament, but he got banned for being under,

01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:57.640
I guess the minimum age, which is 13. And he gets, you can think, uh, Coppa for that as well.

01:58:58.680 --> 01:59:04.040
So I don't know. I know that there's a lot of those like agreements online that especially

01:59:04.040 --> 01:59:07.080
like if you have social media accounts and stuff like that, you have to sign and says,

01:59:07.080 --> 01:59:11.880
Oh yeah, you're at age 13 or whatever, because they have rules about advertising to children

01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:19.240
in there. And so I suppose if you violate that rule, then you could be banned from that stuff.

01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:25.320
They did ban him for four years, which, uh, based on his age would actually make him 13.

01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:30.760
So he'd be eligible to enter competitions at the time. Now, um, I just want to say quickly,

01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:33.720
like, cause that was the first thing that came to my mind too, is that like, okay,

01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:37.640
even though these headlines are going around, going nine year old gets banned from Fortnite

01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:42.760
and you know, those are the big flashy headlines and so forth. Um, it kind of made you kind of go,

01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:46.440
okay, well considering kids are not supposed to do things online until they're 13 anyway,

01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:50.120
or companies aren't supposed to have that because of the CCOPA law, it makes sense.

01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:53.240
And it's not as sensationalist as a lot of blogs are making it out to seem,

01:59:53.240 --> 01:59:57.000
but Jason and I were texting a little bit before the show and Jason kind of brought up the point

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:03.160
that like, actually you can go around it with parental permission. And it sounds like the

02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:08.440
parents want him to be a part of that, but I could, I could see a place where maybe

02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:12.920
Epic has a company policy where like they just, they don't want to deal with permission slips.

02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:19.000
So they just have a policy of 13 or older and that's it. And that's part of what you agree to

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:24.360
when you sign up for the game. I don't, again, I'm, I'm admittedly, I'm not an expert on Fortnite

02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:29.400
and I certainly didn't read the end user license agreement in it. Um, so, but that's just a theory,

02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:35.480
I guess, that I would have. Yeah, possibly. I mean, I don't know. I would imagine that

02:00:35.480 --> 02:00:41.640
there's probably similar guidelines for like other games out there, like, uh, Roblox and stuff,

02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:48.200
but that doesn't stop my kids from playing it. So I don't know. I was trying to see, uh,

02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:53.720
considering how providers have to treat COPPA, uh, allowed users data as special, Epic could also

02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:58.200
decide that they just won't bother and not allow the user due to not being able or willing to

02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:01.560
fulfill the requirements of the terms. Yeah. I imagine the vast majority of everyone not

02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:05.960
specifically expecting children under the age of 13 as users do this. Yeah. That's kind of,

02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:10.200
that's kind of where my brain is at is that they just don't, again, that was a text from Jason.

02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:15.080
That, um, that's kind of where I think Epic is at with this is that they just, they just don't want

02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:20.840
to bother with it. So they're not going to let you play till you're 13. Yeah. Yeah. And considering

02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:25.800
it is kind of a shooty, shooty, bang, bang game of sorts, maybe they just don't want to get into,

02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:29.160
I mean, they probably are well aware that kids are playing it, but it's not something they want

02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:34.200
to officially acknowledge. You know, even if it's cartoony, it might just be a little bit, you know,

02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:40.360
but puts them in a bad light, I suppose. I don't know. So yeah. All right. Too bad, but I guess

02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:46.280
they'll have to go play something else. All right. Well, meanwhile, uh, let's talk about cyberpunk

02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:50.760
updates. So cyberpunk 2077, of course, that's going to be a huge release this summer. We all

02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:54.760
know that, right? Uh, what are the big headlines for this? Well, there's a couple of things.

02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:58.600
Number one, it's going to get its own event in June, which isn't very surprising.

02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:02.840
We knew it was going to be an all star game at the E3 that would have hypothetically happened

02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:07.640
this year. Although now, obviously with that all getting, uh, tabled because of everything else

02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:12.360
going on in the world, cyberpunk is going to do their own online event. Uh, that's going to happen

02:02:12.360 --> 02:02:17.880
in June and they're calling it night city wire, and it's going to happen on June 11th. So that is

02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:23.240
just, I guess the teaser that's happening. Uh, I imagine that it's going to be the gameplay trailer

02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:28.040
that we probably would have seen at E3, right? That's yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's going to be

02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:32.520
probably some more gameplay. Like, I mean, they've already shown quite a bit of gameplay

02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:37.640
and that scene. Now that stuff was actual gameplay. Like you watched them playing the

02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:44.680
actual game. Like that is a gameplay trailer. What we saw, not a gameplay trailer that is an

02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:51.000
engine trailer. Now, um, I'm surprised. I'm sure no one is surprised that cyberpunk 2077 has been

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:59.480
rated M for mature. Okay. Yeah. Let's talk about why. Um, because of all the nudity and the extreme

02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:05.640
violence. Here's the summary. Some locations depict mutilated corpses with open chest cavities

02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:10.680
and or exposed organs and entrails. During one quest, players assist a character by hammering

02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:14.760
nails through his hands and feet, screaming sounds and blood effects accompany the scene.

02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:21.960
Wow. Uh, that is something very interesting. And also players can select a gender and customize

02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:28.600
their character. Customization can include depictions of breasts, buttocks, and genitalia,

02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:35.160
as well as various sizes and combinations of genitals. So we will leave it to your imagination,

02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:41.480
just how free the character customization will be. Did it first? Yes.

02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:45.480
Yes. Did you just Simpsons did it this whole thing?

02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:55.720
But I have a sexy sexiness meter in saints row. Like if, if you slide at the female or whatever,

02:03:55.720 --> 02:03:59.480
it just made your boobs bigger. If you slide the male and made your package bigger. Yeah. So

02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:03.720
anyway, it's I, and again, we don't know the specifics. We just know what's coming from the

02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:09.880
ESRB. So it does sound like things are going to be highly customizable in the game, which you know

02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:17.240
what? Cool. You know, uh, people lose hours and hours in character creation mode. Me I'm at the

02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:21.400
point where I'm just like, I'm going to select a pre-selected character and then pick the hair I

02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:27.320
want and just go from there. That's, that's how I make my characters in game now in games. Now I

02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:31.880
just find the pre-selected character. Then I change it to, uh, the hair I like. That's it.

02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:36.120
But other people are going to spend hours and hours and the customizer doing

02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:42.680
every possible combination they can think of. So have fun. All right. Let's get to the listener

02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:47.320
round table. So you guys can ask us some questions in our chat room. If you'd like over at twitch.tv

02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:52.200
slash vog network, VOG network. Uh, if there's anything you'd like us to bring up or discuss

02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:56.760
here on the program, we can do that. Otherwise I'll look to Loki to buy us a little time with

02:04:56.760 --> 02:05:02.840
some last minute stories. Yes. And I do have a few things. So, um, apparently there's some

02:05:02.840 --> 02:05:12.520
old phone games that you can play for free. So Gameloft classics 20 years is a collection of

02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:21.320
30 old phone games. Some from back in 2007 that are now playable on Android devices.

02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:30.120
What old ass games are there besides snake? Uh, gang star, modern combat. Um,

02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:37.640
I don't know. These old ass games. I remember on my old ass sprint flip phone that I had that

02:05:37.640 --> 02:05:42.600
like had the color screen. You remember that guy? Um, it like had a really shitty camera in it too.

02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:46.120
And you could take selfies on it. Cause I had like that front screen that was really bad.

02:05:46.120 --> 02:05:51.800
Um, so, okay, here we go. It had games like color games on it. Like there was like a Castlevania

02:05:51.800 --> 02:05:57.320
port on that thing. It was really bad. Not sure if you would know most of these titles here,

02:05:58.280 --> 02:06:03.800
but, um, these are, they have them broken up by genre puzzle fun, run and gun life and love

02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:09.800
arcade action and sports and cards. So some of the titles we have here, we have, um,

02:06:10.360 --> 02:06:17.560
date or ditch to high school hookups, modern combat to black Pegasus gang star to Kings of LA

02:06:18.120 --> 02:06:23.320
zombie would alien quarantine. Uh, I don't know any of this shit. I don't, I don't know any of this

02:06:24.280 --> 02:06:33.560
generic stuff. Um, yeah, so neat that that's out there and you can play it for free. So

02:06:34.280 --> 02:06:37.480
go check it out. If you have an Android phone, I guess, I don't know if it's on iOS, but

02:06:38.680 --> 02:06:43.800
it's on Android at least. I probably will not get on that anytime soon,

02:06:43.800 --> 02:06:45.960
especially cause I don't recognize any of those games you mentioned.

02:06:45.960 --> 02:06:55.160
Um, anything else? Uh, yeah, well there is a video that I guess, um, was in a video that

02:06:55.160 --> 02:07:00.200
was published regarding some technology that's showing like hand tracking. That's going to be

02:07:00.200 --> 02:07:06.360
used in Sony's new VR controllers. And they were showing off, uh, apparently there's a paper that

02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:13.000
was uploaded to upload VR as well. Uh, talking about how that's working. It says evaluation

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:18.360
of machine learning techniques for hand pose estimation on handheld device with proximity

02:07:18.360 --> 02:07:24.920
sensor. Yes. Those, those research papers that have such, you know, fancy titles and the video

02:07:24.920 --> 02:07:30.840
shows like some pretty awesome hand tracking on what looks like a really old school looking

02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:36.200
controller, but obviously it's meant for just the hand tracking and stuff, but it's very, um,

02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:41.480
very accurate to pretty much any pose you can make with your hands. So

02:07:42.040 --> 02:07:46.360
pretty neat via interesting to see how that is incorporated into a new VR controller.

02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:55.560
Anything's better than the move. All right. Anything else? Our chats being pretty quiet

02:07:55.560 --> 02:07:59.480
when it comes to questions or comments, which is fine. I know there's a lot of other stuff going

02:07:59.480 --> 02:08:02.920
on in the world, by the way, cause I forgot to mention at the top of the show, cause I had some

02:08:02.920 --> 02:08:07.720
other housekeeping I needed to get, um, uh, talk about, but I do want to wish all of our mothers

02:08:07.720 --> 02:08:12.200
out there a happy mother's day. Uh, whether, um, you're a mom yourself or you want to go

02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:16.600
wish your mom a happy mother's day or, you know, motherly figure, you know, uh, pet,

02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:20.600
pet moms and so forth. You know, if, if you believe this day applies to you, then happy

02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:29.480
mother's day to you. Yeah. I got, I got nothing really else to talk about, I guess.

02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:36.840
All right. Straight up out of news, I guess. Okay. Some questions here. Uh,

02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:40.280
Sia Tabiri in chat says, okay, so I've been enjoying murder by numbers,

02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:45.320
the P cross investigation game, any fun crossover genre games you enjoy?

02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:51.000
Ooh, wow. Crossover genre games. I'm stumped in the moment trying to think of anything.

02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:55.880
I don't really play it anymore, but puzzle quest is pretty cool.

02:08:55.880 --> 02:09:00.200
Oh yeah. Puzzle quest is awesome. They have a free version of that on steam.

02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:03.960
And I don't remember the name of it, but like that, that whole model kind of went free to play

02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:08.680
sometime ago. Cause like there was, there was the Marvel puzzle quest. That was the first free to

02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:12.440
play one I could think of. And now there's a more traditional one. That's all, uh, it's all free to

02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:18.280
play now. I used to like back in the Android and this is a pretty old game, but, uh, swords and

02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:26.760
poker, which is pretty fun. Um, um, trying to think of what else is kind of cool.

02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:29.800
I always, I don't know if this is considered like John, but I always liked when they did

02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:34.920
like the puzzle game that the platformer folks would show up in like Yoshi's cookie.

02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:41.080
And we were talking earlier about like Puyo Puyo, but with Sonic and with Yoshi and some of those

02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:45.480
like crossover. I don't know if that really is the genre bending that you're looking for, but

02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:49.400
that's that comes to my mind where it's like platformers crossed with puzzler.

02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:55.880
Actually, yeah, actually Yoshi's cookie was like a way better, um, puzzle game than that for me

02:09:55.880 --> 02:10:00.520
than I think most people gave it credit for. Um, I also really enjoyed Pokemon puzzle league,

02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:05.960
which is another one of those, which was Tetris attack, but with Pokemon. So there's that.

02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:13.880
Yeah. Um, I think what else? Uh, we've got some other questions here and these are some good,

02:10:13.880 --> 02:10:18.280
good ones here. Um, as Joe and Hunter, Matt says thoughts on the final fantasy seven remake part

02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:23.400
two being in the early stages. Do you think it will get fast tracked because of the big success

02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:30.680
of the first part? I can't believe it's only in the early stages. Come on. Like what what's taken.

02:10:30.680 --> 02:10:35.320
So like I cannot, but this game should already be like, I guess maybe they didn't, they, they knew

02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:39.960
it was a risk and they were worried that the game wasn't going to do well or something. I just

02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:45.000
worry that this game is going to take forever now, but maybe now that the engine is done and they

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:50.200
have a process, maybe it won't take that long. Cause the final fantasy 13, two was only what,

02:10:50.200 --> 02:10:57.000
like two years after the first one. So fingers and toes crossed, but I'm, I am a little shocked. Like

02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:04.840
they're just now starting it like, yeah, I would have thought it was, yeah. Well, it, like I said

02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:10.600
before, I think it's, um, less development time for this one because they've already got the

02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:14.440
engine built now for everything and they've got it kind of working the way they want it to. And

02:11:14.440 --> 02:11:20.280
it's now basically developing the content for it. Um, so some of that's going to be kind of,

02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:24.120
I mean, they've got the characters modeled and everything and some of the environments already.

02:11:24.120 --> 02:11:29.960
So I would imagine that the turnaround time for developments can be much smaller, but yeah,

02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:34.600
I would think that. I hope they've already, I would hope so too. Cause I think final fantasy

02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:39.480
13 was challenged in development a lot. Like they, they, I know they changed the platform

02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:43.720
they were using to develop it partway through. So I'm hoping that like now it's all kind of set

02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:48.920
that, that they can kind of turn around a part to a faster cause like, obviously if they, if they

02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:53.080
wait five or seven years or however long it took us to get found messy seven remake, like that's

02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:57.480
just not going to work. So hopefully they can get it turned out in two to three. Um, but then,

02:11:57.480 --> 02:12:01.480
you know, you start to look at, well, how many parts is final fantasy seven going to be?

02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:06.600
And honestly, the answer is we don't know. There's too many people that are quick to assume,

02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:11.080
Oh, well, because there's, it's only takes you like a third of the way through the first disc.

02:12:11.080 --> 02:12:17.880
There's going to be like six different games to which I say, that's not how it works.

02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:25.080
That's all I can say. So we don't know how many parts it could be. It could be just two parts.

02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:29.880
It could be three parts. It could be seven parts. We just don't know. Anyway. Um,

02:12:29.880 --> 02:12:34.040
I was going to say, kind of go back to that first question. A crypto necro dancer would be,

02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:37.160
Oh, that's a good one for genre bending game. Yeah. That's a good one. I like that.

02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:42.280
Good. Good. Yeah. That's good. Those types of games that are like they're rogue likes,

02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:47.160
but they're this too. What was the trailer for? Like somebody passes on Twitter. It was like a

02:12:47.160 --> 02:12:54.120
shooter slash music game slash rogue like. Yeah. So I've got a few of those in my wishlist. So

02:12:55.080 --> 02:13:00.520
there's gun jam is one of those in BPM bullets per minute is another one. That was it bullets

02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:07.320
per minute. So anyway, yeah. I think gun jam is one where you have to like shoot in rhythm with,

02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:12.200
um, there's like a thing that comes up the screen and almost like guitar heroes, something like

02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:17.640
that. Um, and then same with, uh, one of them is just shooting. The other one is like shooting

02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:23.480
and movement and everything is all done in time. So I don't know. It's pretty cool. Um,

02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:30.120
Ziba in our chats asks, did you guys talk about the final fantasy 11 mobile rumors screenshots?

02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:35.880
Excuse me. I don't want to talk about it. Mobile rumors, screenshots, disappointed that it's

02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:43.720
not coming out. Ziba. I did see the pictures and it does look really good. Like in HD. Um,

02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:48.680
at least the few screenshots we saw. And when I see that stuff, I can't help but feel overwhelming

02:13:48.680 --> 02:13:53.800
disappointment that it's going to be on mobile. And that's just the, like, I'm just like, I,

02:13:53.800 --> 02:13:58.920
I still do not understand how this game is going to translate to mobile. And that's like that key

02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:03.320
missing piece for me. And until I understand that it's so hard for me to get excited.

02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:08.760
Cause honestly I see those screenshots and I'm like, why can't you just make a new PC client

02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:15.960
with that? Why does they want you to go to 14? I don't know. So that's, that's the part where

02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:20.360
I'm struggling. I guess it's all a rumor anyway. Maybe we were supposed to find out more at E3

02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:25.320
this year. Maybe we still find out, we'll find out more in the summer. I did see that screenshot

02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:30.840
that they had of Winhurst or whatever, where I thought that was a fan, like that they were up

02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:36.040
grading the game, like the client for the game or something like that. I thought that was a fan

02:14:36.040 --> 02:14:40.120
mod or something like that when I saw it originally, but I didn't realize that was a

02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:44.760
screenshot from the actual mobile game. Act-deft in chat says maybe it'll get ported over to the

02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:49.800
switch. Um, you know, that's some mobile games do end up on the switch like that. So I guess

02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:56.120
even if we're talking about a mobile game, it isn't impossible that it ends up on consoles.

02:14:56.120 --> 02:15:00.600
For example, the, um, you know, that game I really liked last year, that Sayonara wild hearts,

02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:05.240
that game that's very artistic and flair and the music's very good. That's a mobile game,

02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:10.360
but it, they put it on consoles too. It's just a very simple control scheme, right? It's just one

02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:16.360
button instead of tapping the screen. So, um, I suppose anything's possible with that, but all we

02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:20.200
have right now are rumors. All we have is what they've told us. And that is that they plan to

02:15:20.200 --> 02:15:26.040
do 11 on mobile. We don't know anything beyond that yet, but honestly switch would make a lot

02:15:26.040 --> 02:15:36.360
of sense. So you joke, but dot, dot, dot anyway. Uh, let's see one more here. Um, cheeseburger

02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:43.480
94 in chat says what's this newfangled twatch chat. And what happened to the gold old IRC chat?

02:15:43.480 --> 02:15:47.160
Oh, you must've, you, you clearly haven't been here in about a year and a half. Yes.

02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:55.400
We moved to Twitch, um, in December of 2018. And a big part of that was that, um, well, number one,

02:15:55.400 --> 02:16:00.680
more and more shows are moving to Twitch. Um, because Twitch has more discoverability,

02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:05.720
Twitch is very easy to have, um, uh, like the mobile app, the PlayStation four app,

02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:08.920
uh, a lot of gamers know what you're talking about when you talk about Twitch. And so it's

02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:15.400
very easy to find us and discover us on Twitch. And the reality was as much as we loved shoutcast

02:16:15.400 --> 02:16:21.000
and being like MP3 radio and all that number one, we were paying quite a bit of money to

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:27.000
run that feed and host that feed. Number two, people aren't discovering shoutcast feeds and

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:31.240
all that the same way they're discovering Twitch. And honestly, and I know, you know,

02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:35.960
anytime you maybe make a big change with the show, people are going to say, but I like the old way.

02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:41.880
But the reality is like our number, our listening numbers would still decline, decline, decline.

02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:46.200
And it's not all about the listener numbers, but at the same time, it's like, if we're only,

02:16:46.200 --> 02:16:50.360
you know, there's going to come a point where like, if literally nobody's listening, then

02:16:50.360 --> 02:16:55.960
we're going to be like, all right, well, I don't know. You know, so moving to Twitch has

02:16:55.960 --> 02:17:01.080
helped our audience grow a little bit. And some new people have found us because of that. And

02:17:01.080 --> 02:17:07.880
that's been a great thing. And we get to broadcast this show for free. If you miss the audio thing,

02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:12.920
two things you can always listen to the podcast feed that hasn't changed. And number two,

02:17:12.920 --> 02:17:16.200
the Twitch client, and this is another thing I really like about it on the mobile phone,

02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:20.520
Twitch has an audio only mode. A lot of people don't know that it's there, but if you go into

02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:23.640
your settings, you can make it audio only. So if you don't want to look at my ugly mug,

02:17:23.640 --> 02:17:27.400
you don't have to. You can switch it into audio only mode. And that's, that's totally fine.

02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:31.560
And if you don't want to look at my ugly mug, well, you're in luck for the next few months.

02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:36.680
Yeah. Pod Culture says, I missed the Skype line. Well, again, things have to change.

02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:42.120
We were paying for Skype. More gamers know what Discord is in this day and age. Skype was having

02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:49.320
a lot of conflicts and errors and issues. And you know, there's, I missed the old Skype. I'm going

02:17:49.320 --> 02:17:57.800
to leave. That's my retort. I miss Skype too, the old Skype. So anyway, let's see. Pixel Paca says,

02:17:57.800 --> 02:18:02.360
the only problem with Twitch is that my Australian friend cannot watch live very well. Almost all

02:18:02.360 --> 02:18:07.320
Twitch streams constantly buffer for her, but you can do audio only or get the podcast later. Yes,

02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:12.920
that's very true. And I imagine if the shout cast probably would have buffered a little bit as well,

02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:17.720
that far away. Who knows? But yeah, audio only will help cut back a lot and make it a little

02:18:17.720 --> 02:18:22.040
more, especially if you're in, you know, I don't know where in Australia your friend lives,

02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:25.720
but if it's somewhere where the internet connection isn't as strong, then the audio only

02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:30.680
will probably help a little bit of that. Yeah. SG100Matt says, they don't miss the constant

02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:35.560
battle every time Skype had an update that would bork something else. It's that, unfortunately,

02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:41.080
it is very much that. And we know that a lot of gamers have embraced Discord right now. I'm not

02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:46.280
saying Discord is going to be the only way to do it forever. I remain open to other ideas,

02:18:46.280 --> 02:18:51.400
but we'll see. All right. Anyway, thank you. Great questions tonight for the round table.

02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:55.320
Any other last minute stories we didn't get to, Loki, that you want to mention before we wrap up?

02:18:55.320 --> 02:18:59.160
No, that's it. All right. Then I guess that means we wrap up. So that's going to do it for another

02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:03.240
episode of Orange Lounge Radio tonight. Thank you. Of course, everybody here, whether you were live

02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:07.800
on glorious video or whether you were here for the pod or for just the audio only on Twitch,

02:19:07.800 --> 02:19:11.400
or whether you're here on the podcast feed, no matter how you consume Orange Lounge Radio,

02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:16.120
we thank you for being a part of it. And you could help us out a lot by spreading the word

02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:20.600
because we are the show where every gamer has a voice. But if the voices aren't here to put out

02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:27.800
on air, then we don't get them. Also, an auto host here on Twitch on your own channel for

02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:33.480
VOG Network. So helpful. I can't even tell you. The power of hosting and rating is really great

02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:38.120
on Twitch. So we really appreciate all of that. And of course, a big thanks to anybody who followed,

02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:42.360
subscribed or rated or anything like that tonight. I will acknowledge all you guys after

02:19:42.600 --> 02:19:48.200
we're done recording the podcast for tonight. Just thank you for showing up and being here. And

02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:53.320
thanks again to all the gamer moms out there. And hope you had a great Mother's Day today.

02:19:54.360 --> 02:19:58.200
Let's get to final thoughts. Final, final thought. Loki, your final thought tonight.

02:19:58.840 --> 02:20:05.640
So my final thought is I was told by my work that we're not going back. They're not even

02:20:05.640 --> 02:20:10.680
considering us the conversation about going back until at least September 1st.

02:20:11.480 --> 02:20:14.280
So I'm going to be working from home for a long time.

02:20:15.080 --> 02:20:19.800
Yeah. And I don't know how long OLR is going to do the distance thing as well. I miss being in

02:20:19.800 --> 02:20:25.560
studio with everybody. But it's really, it's one of those when the scientists say it's safe,

02:20:25.560 --> 02:20:31.160
then we'll do it. Until then, we will follow the rules. And that's that. And even then,

02:20:31.160 --> 02:20:37.720
I kind of don't want to force Loki or Jamie to have to be here in person for a good period

02:20:37.720 --> 02:20:41.880
after that while we kind of like make sure everything is good, if that makes sense. I'm

02:20:41.880 --> 02:20:50.760
sure you can all understand that. So yeah. With that, my final thought is it was a shorter show

02:20:50.760 --> 02:20:55.960
than usual tonight. But that leaves me more time to go play games. Maybe I can sell stuff at Nook's

02:20:55.960 --> 02:21:00.360
before they close for the night. That'll be good. All right. Have a great week, everybody. Happy

02:21:00.360 --> 02:21:04.360
gaming. We will see you here in seven days. Again, we're sending a lot of love to DarkSakra

02:21:05.320 --> 02:21:10.280
and her friends and family. We'll see you next week to talk more about games.

02:21:10.280 --> 02:21:11.640
Have a good week, everybody. Good night.

02:21:30.360 --> 02:21:34.680
The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those

02:21:34.680 --> 02:21:40.680
of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.

02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:45.720
See you next week.
