00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,240
This week, the Internet is outraged on behalf of a talented 9-year-old Fortnite player.

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,200
Also this week, the Internet learns about the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,140
and more importantly, its exceptions.

4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,800
This is just one headline in the week's news, stay tuned for the rest, starting right now

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,800
on the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,440
Hello my friends out there on the Internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,920
every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 819 for this May 10th, 2020.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,280
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm all alone here in the studio, although we would usually all

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,240
be here in the same room taping.

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,440
As you know, there's a lot of things going on in the world right now that are preventing

12
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,440
that.

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,880
A big thanks to the Magic of Discord.

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,160
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,160
Hello.

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,160
Hi, Loki.

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,360
How are you doing?

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,360
I'm fine.

19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,360
Good, good.

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,560
Did you do anything special for Mother's Day for like your wife or your own mom or anything

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,560
like that?

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,120
I bought her a cake yesterday and then I cooked dinner today.

23
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,560
Oh, well, there you go.

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,560
That's very good of you.

25
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,400
I think I saw the picture on Facebook.

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,400
Was that today or yesterday?

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,400
It was today.

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Oh, that looked good.

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,680
It was like you did like fried chicken or something, but in the air fryer, right?

30
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,400
Yeah, it's air fryer, honey butter wings.

31
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,040
Oh, you're infamous honey butter, right?

32
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,040
Yes.

33
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,040
Yes.

34
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,040
All right.

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,040
Awesome.

36
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,400
I'll come back and talk more about food with you in just a minute.

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,880
Not joining us tonight, unfortunately, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

38
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,280
I do want to quickly let you guys know what's going on.

39
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,840
So last week's show got a little bit weird because Jamie had to leave partway through

40
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,360
the show.

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,560
What happened, guys, is that Dark Sakura got word halfway, or not even halfway, probably

42
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,960
like a quarter pounder of the way into the show last week, Dark Sakura got a phone call

43
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,360
that her dad had been admitted into the hospital and was in the emergency area being tested

44
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,360
and so forth.

45
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,480
Unfortunately, I don't have great news to report.

46
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,000
Her father passed away this week and so as you can imagine, she's taking some time off

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,720
tonight to handle things and decompress with everything going on.

48
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,980
So obviously we're sending our best wishes and so forth to Dark Sakura.

49
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,120
It's definitely not an easy thing to be going through, especially with everything else that's

50
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,480
going on in the world.

51
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,200
So yeah, I did get her permission to tell you all that, that that had happened.

52
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,120
I think it would be okay for me to as well tell you it was not COVID related because

53
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
I think that's good.

54
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,440
I think just in this day and age, that is going to be a curiosity that happens, although

55
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,820
that was a scare.

56
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:56,260
Anytime you're in the hospital and you're showing certain symptoms, that is something

57
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,880
that they're looking at, but I felt it appropriate to say it's not that, but I will let Dark

58
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,240
Sakura give more details.

59
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,000
If she wants to, which she's under no obligation to do, when she returns to the show, be it

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,220
next week, the week after, however much time she needs.

61
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:18,020
So I know it's a tremendously difficult thing to go through with losing a parent.

62
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:23,980
So yeah, I'm just thinking of her and I'm sure we all are in chat and so forth right

63
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,980
now.

64
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:30,140
So yeah, I just wanted to let you know why last week's show got a little weird there

65
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:37,260
in the middle and why Jamie's not here tonight and we'll come back whenever she pleases.

66
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,980
So moving on, because we do try to do this show to take our minds off of all the craziness

67
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:48,940
going on in the real world, be it personal tragedy or the tragedy that is seemingly surrounding

68
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,300
us in the globe every day with what's going on in the world.

69
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:58,460
I know a lot of us run to our Animal Crossing towns to escape what's going on.

70
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,460
I don't blame you.

71
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,260
I'm very similar in this day and age.

72
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,040
So with that being said, let's use video games as an escape for a little bit.

73
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,040
Let's talk about some big gaming news and some things to look forward to amongst all

74
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,720
this this year, starting with our kickoff tonight, talking about the Xbox Series X event.

75
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:22,160
So Loki, last week on the show, we set some, I guess, not so great expectations for the

76
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,160
event.

77
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,160
Yeah.

78
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,560
So, well, you know, and why the summer of gaming is stretched out for four months because

79
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,640
they're stretching out the news for four months.

80
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,980
Well, here's the thing, too.

81
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,400
And I don't know if it was said before we had taped last week or after that it was going

82
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,660
to be all third party.

83
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,420
Sorry, we missed the memo and didn't get to relay that during the show.

84
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,660
So, you know, if that was before the show, then our bad.

85
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,660
We missed it.

86
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,340
There's a lot of information about the event going around.

87
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:54,660
And so but I do think we'd also said, you know, set your expectations at a reasonable

88
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,660
level.

89
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,660
It's May.

90
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,440
So like, you know, I'm going to be completely honest.

91
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,800
I kind of clicked through the event because I forgot it was at 8 a.m.

92
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,480
Usually these types of things are at like noon my time because being on the West Coast,

93
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,980
I can usually, you know, I don't have to worry about like sleeping right through it or something.

94
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:19,600
So I was distracted with day job work stuff and I had no idea, none, that it had even

95
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,780
happened until it was already over.

96
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,120
So I kind of ended up going like clicking through it.

97
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
And that that was the point.

98
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,080
I kind of heard, well, it was kind of just a bunch of third party trailers.

99
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,080
Did you watch it, Loki?

100
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,760
Was that what you walked away with?

101
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,300
I did watch it.

102
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,660
And there was some interesting things there.

103
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,000
But like the I mean, they came out first.

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,840
They said, OK, you know, we've heard the Internet, you guys giving us a hard time about gameplay

105
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
trailers.

106
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,960
Well, we tell we're telling you now they're gameplay trailers.

107
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,940
And then they show what your trailers are gameplay.

108
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,620
So it's like, guys, what are you doing?

109
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,100
So they had some interesting things.

110
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:06,200
I mean, I really enjoyed like some of the trailers they had for what was it?

111
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,140
That one medium that looked pretty awesome.

112
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,020
The game, the medium, which basically looked like a spiritual successor to Silent Hill

113
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,320
by the folks that I was like, is that even the one that the kiriyama is like actually

114
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,320
involved with?

115
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
Yes, he is.

116
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:26,520
Silent Hill, like I hear a kiriyama is the silent hill.

117
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,980
So that one is by the makers of the Blair Witch and the Observer.

118
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,520
So Blair Witch is pretty good.

119
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,700
And then there was Scorn, which I have no idea what that was.

120
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,720
Some horror game looks like, you know, was H.R.

121
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,680
Geiger or something like that.

122
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,920
And that looked kind of weird.

123
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Maybe that's chorus.

124
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
I don't know.

125
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:54,100
There's a lot of these games that were kind of similar overall.

126
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,580
I thought it was pretty good.

127
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,260
Didn't really care so much about Madden stuff, but whatever.

128
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:06,420
And then, of course, Assassin's Creed, I was really hoping to see some actual gameplay,

129
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:11,100
but of course not.

130
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,300
I don't know the new Yakuza game.

131
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,280
I guess I got to get into the Yakuza series because it looked pretty awesome.

132
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
Like a dragon.

133
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,280
Yeah.

134
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,420
And just quickly about the gameplay, because that seemed to be the recurring theme from

135
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,420
a lot of people.

136
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,240
And you kind of hit on that, you know, with what you said earlier, that most people were

137
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,100
hoping like this is going to be the chance to see some gameplay.

138
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,000
And it really like wasn't gameplay like, OK, sure.

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,620
There might have been like three seconds of gameplay in engine footage, whatever.

140
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,620
OK, like.

141
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,620
Yeah.

142
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,620
Right.

143
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,100
And it was really it was funny because Bobby went into this on his show tonight because

144
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,140
I haven't given this line out yet during the show.

145
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,700
We do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the

146
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,400
voice of Geeks Network, Twitch dot excuse me, have the hiccups, twitch dot TV slash

147
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,460
Vogue Network at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black

148
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,460
Wolf show.

149
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,560
And Bobby on his show tonight was talking about this.

150
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,720
And I thought it was funny because he kind of went through some of the footage and he

151
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,140
actually like blew up the little disclaimer that was at the bottom of the screen that

152
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,800
kind of talks about how, you know, it's very typical, you know, what you see in trailers.

153
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,640
Like, you know, the game footage is not final.

154
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,420
It's, you know, all, you know, prior what they expect it to look like and all this stuff.

155
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,280
So it's it was kind of rendered preview things.

156
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,480
It just didn't look like people were actually playing these games.

157
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,740
You know, it just looked like, oh, they're they're either rendering these cinematics

158
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,340
and in engine or there's a lot of shooty shooty bang bang.

159
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:36,100
But it's very scripted and reacting a lot faster than a person actually playing it would

160
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,620
be doing and so forth.

161
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:44,400
But, you know, considering that the line is getting more and more blurred and there was

162
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
an interesting take.

163
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,260
I was reading online about this, about how, you know, part of the reason why maybe we're

164
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,940
not feeling it so much with, you know, what we saw this week is that, you know, when the

165
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:00,220
graphics went up from Nintendo to Super Nintendo, huge jump when they went up from Super Nintendo

166
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,260
to the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation era, the first 3D era.

167
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,260
That was huge.

168
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,080
It was a huge jump in graphics, right?

169
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,900
Like, oh, my God, 3D, right?

170
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,880
And then going from the PlayStation one of the PlayStation two, that was a huge upgrade,

171
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,360
you know, DVD and all the extra stuff that could be stored with that PlayStation two

172
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,400
to PlayStation three.

173
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:23,400
That was a pretty big jump, three to four, a minor jump, not as big of a jump, but still

174
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
a noticeable jump.

175
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
Right.

176
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:31,080
You know, more HD stuff and more is 60 frames a second and things like that.

177
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,580
OK, so you notice every now they're going from four to five.

178
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,980
It's almost like we're pushing the limits of what our eyes can actually see, that it's

179
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,500
just like that graphical improvement isn't there.

180
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:47,100
So it's almost like we need to know what are the other bells and whistles.

181
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,440
Because the graphics aren't doing it anymore.

182
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,060
And I think that's why this particular reveal event was a struggle, because it's harder

183
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,540
to ooh and aah at the graphics.

184
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,180
I mean, yes, it looks good.

185
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:03,100
I thought it was, yeah, the graphics were fine, but like there's I just wanted to see

186
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:08,140
more like gameplay, like what these games are, because there's some like I don't even

187
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,260
know what what this game is like.

188
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,660
It's hard for me to understand what exactly it is that I'm going to be playing, whereas

189
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,720
like some of them, like the Yakuza stuff, at least that I have a pretty good idea.

190
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,900
And I know that like, OK, those cutscenes are actually in game and stuff.

191
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,620
But like, I don't know.

192
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:28,340
And just the fact that, you know, OK, I don't think this was a bomb or, you know, horrible.

193
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,580
Like it was not like the Xbox one reveal.

194
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,740
OK, that was a disaster.

195
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,700
This was this wasn't a disaster.

196
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:41,700
This was just kind of like, OK, or maybe or like maybe an overall meh, but with a couple

197
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,220
minutes of oh, neat.

198
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,700
For example, the Xbox is getting a new Yakuza game.

199
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,700
Oh, neat.

200
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,900
You know, that was OK.

201
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:53,300
So that's kind of neat, you know, or oh, the Silent Hill folks are working on a new game

202
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,300
for Xbox.

203
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,300
Oh, OK, neat.

204
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,560
You know, but we just didn't really get to see the gameplay, but at least it did have

205
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,520
those few moments of, oh, neat, right?

206
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:08,040
But I think when the first party reveal happens and we start to do the real deep dive into

207
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,840
this new Xbox Series X, I think that's when it's going to have to be a little more than

208
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,040
just, oh, neat.

209
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,320
It's going to have to be, oh, I want that.

210
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
I'm going to preorder that.

211
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
You know what I mean?

212
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
Yeah, definitely.

213
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,520
I mean, there's some games, you know, that were like, oh, that's pretty cool.

214
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,840
So far, like then, of course, they said, OK, well, we're going to have another event later

215
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
on in July.

216
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:35,880
And it's like, fine, I guess, just wait for all that stuff in July.

217
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,720
I'm trying to find some comments from our chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

218
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:47,960
Bonds 006 says HDR 2 and 4K, bleeding edge graphics is OK, but gameplay is better.

219
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,640
Something else to consider with 4K, too, is just how many games are we actually going

220
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,640
to see with it?

221
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,800
Because 4K is going to be a beast for those artists to make those types of textures.

222
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,480
Like there's there's a limit.

223
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,960
I think that that's pretty typical nowadays in the PC space.

224
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,560
So I think everyone's kind of used to it already.

225
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,160
And one of the things I did like, though, was they were talking about that smart delivery.

226
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:15,280
So that's that thing where if you buy, say, you know, Census Creed Valhalla on Xbox One,

227
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,400
you also get the free upgrade to the Series X.

228
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,760
And vice versa.

229
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,580
Honestly, that's exciting.

230
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,920
And I think it's one of those things where now like backwards compatibility becomes almost

231
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,960
more important when trying to sell your new console.

232
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,960
And I think that's why Sony is much more on board with it this time.

233
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,480
And, you know, Microsoft's definitely making it a piece of what they're saying, too.

234
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,880
But there's also a lot of people out there that are like, I don't think I really need

235
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,560
an Xbox Series X because I'm going to play all these games on PC.

236
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,120
Is that really a loss for Microsoft?

237
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,240
I don't think so.

238
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,800
I don't know if all these games will be on PC.

239
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,480
I mean, a lot of them will be, but well, it's hard to everything is going to be the third

240
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,480
party stuff.

241
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,480
It's hard to say.

242
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
Fair.

243
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,640
But we know the first party Microsoft stuff all will be like they've said that as much

244
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,120
like Halo is going to be on PC.

245
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,720
They're all going to be on PC.

246
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,960
So you know, I think it just depends on what the specs are to get in the run the way that

247
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:16,000
they do, because like, I mean, I have a pretty new laptop, so I'm hoping that that stuff

248
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,480
should run really well.

249
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,200
But I mean, eventually at some point it's not.

250
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:27,560
So I need to see what I need to have it run at the speed that they know it should run

251
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,560
or whatever.

252
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
Just.

253
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,200
But yeah, I mean, that that was the thing is like, well, I don't know if I really need

254
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,240
to necessarily buy an Xbox because I can just have a PC.

255
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,240
I don't know.

256
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,200
Maybe the games pass and stuff, you know, the ad.

257
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,160
I mean, that's just that's going to be a big part of it as well.

258
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,840
So you're going to have three generations of systems where they have games for it.

259
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,800
I do think I do think games pass is great.

260
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,000
And I've said that on the show before.

261
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,400
I think the one place the game pass could improve is that they do have such a robust

262
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:02,520
library of Xbox 360 and original Xbox games that could be on that service, but for whatever

263
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:07,720
reason aren't and especially first party Microsoft titles, you know, so maybe they're just drip

264
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,200
feeding it.

265
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,320
Maybe we'll see more.

266
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:09,800
I don't know.

267
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,840
But, you know, Xbox game pass, I think I'm a big fan of that.

268
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,560
And to see what how that's going to impact, you know, the next generation of Xbox, I want

269
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,240
to get some more comments from chat.

270
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:25,000
Bonds 006 says graphic porn does not make up for a lackluster game design, bland gameplay,

271
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,040
shoddy AI.

272
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,840
And yeah, this this trailer binge that we got, we couldn't really see any of that other

273
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,240
stuff.

274
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,480
Not that, you know, events are really going to clue you in if the game has shoddy AI or

275
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:35,880
not.

276
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,080
But still, I think a lot of us like to see the gameplay to see what's it really going

277
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,520
to look like when we get our hands on it.

278
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,800
Fifth Dream Today says the fast loading, the smaller download sizes, the 3D sound chip.

279
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,240
I'm already sold.

280
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,840
So very true.

281
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,080
Let's see.

282
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,480
Johnny Woofay talking about ray tracing.

283
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,160
New killer instinct with ray tracing would be amazing.

284
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,480
So yeah, ray tracing, obviously a big part of the next generation of gaming.

285
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,680
And I know my current PC, my current video card can't really handle it.

286
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,400
So, you know, that may be something I'll have to go to.

287
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,800
Either I got to improve my video card or I'll have to go to an Xbox Series X to experience

288
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,200
that.

289
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,160
We'll see what happens.

290
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,000
You know, something else this event kind of made me think of, you know,

291
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,240
again, guys, it's May, you know, and usually this type of binge doesn't start till June.

292
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,080
And with everything going on in the world, I don't think many of us would be surprised

293
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,160
if it's delayed a little bit past early June.

294
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,120
The E3, I'm using my quoting fingers, time frame that we would usually see these events

295
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,600
in.

296
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:40,680
But, you know, let's imagine, as I'm sure many of you have been doing these past few

297
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,280
months, let's imagine COVID, Corona had never happened.

298
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,680
Let's imagine this whole pandemic never happened.

299
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,840
I know, it's hard to do.

300
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,200
And then we had E3 like usual.

301
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,640
I think you would see Microsoft coming out on stage and, you know, talking about their

302
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,040
new system.

303
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,200
They're only going to have an hour and a half or two hours and they've got to fit in, you

304
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,280
know, their system and all the reasons why you should upgrade to the new system as well

305
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,800
as announcing their own games and games you should be looking forward to.

306
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:16,040
I think a lot of this stuff we saw in the inside Xbox would have been relegated to that

307
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,440
third party sizzle wheel, right?

308
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,880
Y'all know what I'm talking about, right?

309
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,560
Yeah, the sizzle reel.

310
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,320
I mean, a lot of them like see a lot of the games are like, oh, is this this?

311
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,600
Because I thought it was something else.

312
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,360
Like, for example, Vampire the Masquerade originally when they were showing that I was

313
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,960
like, oh, is this Bioshock in a new Bioshock?

314
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,040
And it's like, oh, no, it's Vampire, which is fine.

315
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,480
I mean, I guess that game is pretty good.

316
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,000
And that's not to say they won't show third party games still at the big event, whatever,

317
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,440
you know, the virtual event they end up doing.

318
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,920
That's not to say they won't, like, if there is a new Bioshock, that's not to say they

319
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,800
won't show that.

320
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,720
But I think these particular games that got shown were probably the things that would

321
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,800
have been relegated to the sizzle reel.

322
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,080
And now it's a little bit of a win-win situation when that they get that time back that would

323
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,760
have gone to the sizzle reel, right?

324
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,920
So we can see something else at the show.

325
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,880
And B, you didn't just get a sizzle reel.

326
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,000
You got much more content from these third parties and you got, you know, to see more

327
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
of, you know, these games for better or for worse with the rendered trailers and so forth.

328
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,160
So I just I think this was the supersized sizzle trailer.

329
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,240
I just think that they should be really careful with what they're calling gameplay.

330
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:29,480
Like if it's in engine footage or something like that, that's fine, because especially

331
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:35,240
Ubisoft, I mean, we're talking about not just a few years ago, we had the whole debacle

332
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:41,320
over Watch Dogs where they showed stuff that ended up being, you know, downgraded when

333
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,960
the full retail version came out or Aliens Colonial Marines, you know, remember that

334
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,600
whole thing where none of the footage even resembled the final game when it came out.

335
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,440
So it's it's we need to be very careful with that.

336
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,200
A lot of people in chat and I know it came up on Bobby show as well, not to rehash things

337
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,800
too much, but the Killzone PS3 debacle and how the target rendered footage that they

338
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,840
showed at the event didn't even match what ended up happening.

339
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,000
That's been talked about quite a bit tonight.

340
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,680
And I get it. It's still early, but don't don't one, call it a gameplay trailer and

341
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:20,120
two, don't have another like a brief moment before all the trailers say, hey, we get it,

342
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,720
you guys, you know, you come down on us when we call this stuff gameplay and it's not.

343
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,960
But we promise you it's gameplay like don't have that before all of this.

344
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,440
If it's not going to be that like, I don't understand why you set yourself up even more.

345
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,040
Yeah, that was a weird, weird setup.

346
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,640
I mean, I don't know. It's just it's weird. Like without the UI and stuff on there,

347
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,800
it's just it doesn't look right. And I get it like there's like cut scenes and stuff like that.

348
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:51,080
They're rendered in game, but. I don't know if it's all cut scenes is kind of ridiculous.

349
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,800
OK, this comment is too good. I have to read it. This is about you and that vampire trailer.

350
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,600
Bobby Black Wolf says, Q up the is this anime butterfly meme?

351
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,360
Loki is the anime boy. Vampire is the butterfly. Is this Bioshock?

352
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,600
It's good. It's like it's like when he had like the guy like stringing up the people

353
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,600
in the house and stuff like that, I was like, oh, OK, that kind of looks like a splicer or

354
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,640
something like that. You've all done it. We've all done it. I'm I'm I'm positive because, you know,

355
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:25,320
if you if you can go back to last year's E3, if you happen to be a subscriber of Vogue Network

356
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,400
here at Twitch, Wink, Wink, Nudge, Nudge, you can go back into the video footage and look at

357
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,480
everything. And I don't I don't remember if Bobby and I were commentating on like a Microsoft event

358
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,040
or it was the Square event. But I know that there was like a trailer that came up and I'm like,

359
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,600
oh, this looks like such and such. And it totally wasn't.

360
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,520
You know, and that or and then I was like, thought that was a Forza Horizon game. I'm like,

361
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:53,160
I mean, it's heavily inspired by it. You know, it looks it. I don't know.

362
00:19:53,880 --> 00:20:00,200
You know, and look, look, I can openly admit it because you all do it with video games, too.

363
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,280
And it happens with movie trailers. So it's not it's not just games where this happens.

364
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,640
You've totally seen movie trailers and a person will show up and you'll be like,

365
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,680
is this the trailer for a new Marvel thing? Oh, no, it's not.

366
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,840
It's it's a rip off or something like that. Or is this the new Pixar movie? Oh, no, no,

367
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,320
it's not Pixar. It's something like that. Is this the new Iron Man? Oh, that's Dr. Doolittle.

368
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:30,200
Exactly. You've all done it in the movie theater. Come on. So, yeah. But anyway, I again,

369
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:37,320
the event wasn't bad. It just was kind of like, oh, that wasn't really gameplay. All right.

370
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:44,680
So we're really looking forward to your I guess now July event instead. So now it'll be just

371
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:49,400
what's interesting to see through all this, of course, is how is Sony going to play this?

372
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,960
Because we still don't know. Does Sony plan to do something in June when E3 would have been?

373
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,320
Is Sony going to wait for July? Because as we've talked about on the show before,

374
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:05,080
Microsoft pulled out the switch two months before it released. So hypothetically, if consoles aren't

375
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:11,880
releasing until November, we may not hear anything until September. Nintendo pulled out the switch.

376
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:19,480
They did. They said Microsoft. Oh, God. All right. Sorry. It's been a long, long seven weeks.

377
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,960
So, yes, Nintendo pulled out the switch. Sorry. With only like two months to go,

378
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,160
because it was like early January. And granted, the holidays come into that and everything.

379
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,800
But still, and the switch sold like cuckoo bananas because they had all the right games for it and

380
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:38,680
the right things to say. So you don't need five or six months of lead time. Unless maybe you're

381
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:45,080
trying to collect all those preorders. I don't know. But Nintendo kind of changed the games in

382
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,480
many ways with the switch's launch. You don't have to launch a console for the holidays. You

383
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,120
don't have to launch a console with six months lead time and you can still be successful. So

384
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:02,280
we'll see. Anyway, I'm still excited for Xbox Series X. I'm sure the July event is going to

385
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:07,960
be great. I'm excited for Sony's event as well. And I'm excited for Nintendo to announce what

386
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,680
their plan looks like for the rest of the year. I just really like games. So I just...

387
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,640
You ever go on Twitter and look like... And I'm telling you, actually, don't do this.

388
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,360
But have you ever made the mistake of going on Twitter and looking at an Xbox tweet and looking

389
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:28,600
at the reply and it's all Sony fanboys saying really mean things? Or you go to a Sony tweet

390
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,960
and you look at all the replies and it's Microsoft fanboys saying very mean things. I'm so tired.

391
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,120
Y'all, it's 2020 and I'm tired. Like, just stop. Stop fighting.

392
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,400
We don't have sports teams to root for right now, so we have to root for the console wars.

393
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:49,640
It's so disturbing. And I know, Rob, don't read the comments. You're right. I should know better.

394
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:58,120
I can't help it. Sometimes you click and... God, I saw it. So anyway. Yeah. And then Bobby says,

395
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,600
and you go to a Nintendo tweet and it's all Nintendo fanboys saying mean things.

396
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,280
Where is our direct, et cetera? Yeah, no. Tea. It's true. Nintendo kind of fights themselves,

397
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:13,080
don't they? It's been 26 days since a Nintendo Direct. I'm dying.

398
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,680
Orange right in chat says, have you ever made the mistake of going on Twitter?

399
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:26,120
You know, there's a lot of good and bad on Twitter. I've had a pretty darn good experience

400
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:31,560
on Twitter. I've met a lot of great people on Twitter. I heavily curate my Twitter experience

401
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:37,560
and I heavily choose who I follow. I have two different layers of followers. I do. Yes,

402
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:42,920
I follow like 1600 people on Twitter. I do. Not nearly that many of them are active. I've also

403
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,920
been on Twitter for 10 years and there's a lot of accounts that ain't tweeting anymore. Sure.

404
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,600
Here's the thing. I'm going to tell you my steps to how to stay on top of a 1600 follower list.

405
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:58,040
Number one, the minute I follow you, I disable your retweets. Number one,

406
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,640
that's just been a policy. Like I'm not interested in retweets.

407
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:07,800
I'm interested. Yeah, we can do that. Oh yeah. You go follow and you click on the dots on a

408
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,200
person's profile and you can disable their retweets. And if I see any retweets come in

409
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,880
my timeline where it's like, I forgot, because sometimes if somebody has a protected account,

410
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,960
you can't do that right away. So if I see a retweet come in my timeline,

411
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,560
especially if it's something I really don't care about, I go to your profile and I hide retweets.

412
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:28,760
No, retweets I'm fine with. That's right. It's the likes that I want to stop getting in my team.

413
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,120
Yeah, those don't... Well, when you follow as many people as I do...

414
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:40,040
Everybody be thirsty out there and like... It's true. Don't go to the curated timeline

415
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,880
because you see a lot more of it there. You have to go to the actual chronological timeline.

416
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:52,760
And then the other Twitter trick is, well, quote tweets you can't really do anything about. And

417
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,280
that's the one that's starting to become a pain. But a lot of times the things people say are

418
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:02,440
funny, so okay. But the other very, very important thing is lists. And that's the other thing.

419
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:09,000
So I have an invisible list and you don't know if you're on it or not of about 40-ish people.

420
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And that's the one I actually read with regularity and kind of stay current on.

421
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,120
And then it's like one of those, if I'm bored or I'm not doing anything right now,

422
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,800
I'm doing that whole lying in bed and I really shouldn't be on my phone, but I am.

423
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:28,840
Then I scroll through the big timeline and read all the 1600 thing crap. And then if you're

424
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:34,440
tweeting a bunch of bullshit, I don't want to see, I just mute you. Sorry. But especially...

425
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:41,800
Oh my God, the automated stuff. That's a mute. I feel like Grandpa Simpson. That's a paddling.

426
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,920
Every sponsored tweet I see, I blocked the account.

427
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,600
You have a robot that says how many people followed you today. That's a mute. You tweet

428
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:59,880
too damn much about politics. That's a mute. You just, the automated tweets are the things that

429
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:08,840
really bother me. That's a mutant. So that's how I see it. That's a mutant. And that's how I stay

430
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:15,400
on top of things. Bobby Blackwell says Rob mutes VOG network confirmed. No, I don't mute our own

431
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:21,960
stuff. And here's the thing with that. At least it's like, and I actually don't mute the people

432
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,560
that say I'm going live on Twitch and all that. I don't mute that. That's not what I'm talking

433
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:31,560
about. I'm talking about the one that says I have five new followers today and three people

434
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:37,800
unfollowed me. Thank you so much to dah, dah, dah for whatever website for the stats or thanks

435
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:43,960
at so-and-so for the follow. Thanks at so-and-so like they have a robot thing that tweets every

436
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:49,240
time somebody follows them. That's a mutant. But if somebody, like I follow a lot of other

437
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,280
Twitch streamers, let's be real. And if they tweet, hi, I'm going live on Twitch and I'm

438
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,680
going to be playing something such and such tonight. Like our, like our pal, Jeff.

439
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:03,080
I follow him. I don't, I don't mute him. He tweets a lot of funny shit too. And I actually really

440
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:08,040
enjoy his clips from Twitch. So I don't mute that, you know? So I don't, no, I do not mute VOG

441
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:15,080
network, but I do mute, especially when like you have no other content. Anyway, one other

442
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,320
Twitter trick, I know you're getting burned out on this, but now I'm on a roll. I don't follow

443
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:26,600
everyone back automatically. Most people I do, but here's my trick because there's so many robots

444
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:32,440
out there on Twitter nowadays. I assess your account in five minutes or five seconds to try

445
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,160
to figure out if you're a real person or not. And here's my criteria. I go to your page and I click

446
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:45,160
on your media tab. If I see, and I scroll for three seconds. If I see a selfie of you, I know

447
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,560
you're a real person and I'll follow you back or some other type of picture that obviously came

448
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:56,200
from a cell phone camera. I follow back. If I see a lot of interaction with accounts and gifts,

449
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,600
then I kind of try to feel out, okay, is this content that I'm going to like? Then I'll probably

450
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:08,040
follow back. If it's empty, there's nothing there in your media tab, I don't follow back

451
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:16,520
because that is almost a sure sign of a bot account. So that's, anyway, I'm not perfect

452
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,840
a hundred percent of the time. So please don't walk away from this. If you followed me on Twitter

453
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,920
and I never followed you back with a tear, why won't Rob Roberts follow me on Twitter?

454
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,280
It's not a perfect system and Twitter doesn't always alert me when people follow me. So I

455
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:35,640
miss it sometimes. But anytime somebody asks me or responds to something or likes something

456
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,520
and I'm not following them, I usually go and I see they're following me. I'm like,

457
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,520
why am I not following this person? And so just like one of my tweets and I'll usually catch it.

458
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:49,480
So anyway, a Tiger Clawed Chat says, good thing Rob at least follows members of the community

459
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,760
because we post good content. Yes, I follow people. Quest Buster says, these Twitter tips

460
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,840
are gold. You're welcome, I guess. I've been on Twitter a long, long time and I've just kind of

461
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:04,920
picked up that stuff. Tiger Clawed says, I think Travis Donovan's Twitter does that sometimes.

462
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:11,320
There's certain people I will let slide and Grandpa Donovan is one of them. Don't tell him.

463
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:17,720
But even if he uses a robot, I don't have it in my heart to unfollow him. Yeah, Bonds006 says,

464
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,880
or too much about 5G, new ways to make money and why you're an expert on blah blah or slimming

465
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:29,320
teas, promotion, Herbalife. Oh yeah, all that shit in your bio especially. Like if it's like,

466
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:34,760
follow my Twitch channel. That's in my bio. I'm not going to disqualify somebody for having that.

467
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:41,160
But if it's kind of like, make more followers, I'll tell you, that's a mutant. All right, anyway,

468
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,920
there are Twitter tips with me that you didn't ask for that I went off for 10 minutes about. Sorry,

469
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:52,360
Logie, do you have any hot Twitter tips? No, I apparently need to start doing more things.

470
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,520
I don't know. Really, the only thing I do nowadays is I just use the like button to

471
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:02,520
bookmark stuff they go back to later on. That's fair. Usually like, I follow a lot of developers

472
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,200
and they post like tutorials on how to do different things. Like, oh, hey, that's interesting.

473
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,160
I want to do that. That's interesting. So I'll put it so I can, it pulls up in my likes feed.

474
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:15,800
You know what, though? Like, here's the thing, Logie, is that like, you are so right, though,

475
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,960
about the likes and that there's some very thirsty people on Twitter and the type of stuff that goes

476
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,760
in the feed. And it actually makes me self conscious about the types of things that I like

477
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:34,520
on Twitter. Because I don't want y'all knowing like, that I that I like some of those thirst

478
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:40,600
stress. I like some of those thoughts. Okay. And I had I had to like, block those people

479
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:45,400
that were appearing to my feed, not necessarily people that are liking those things. I like I like

480
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:50,040
it's like, you just don't want to block a certain type of account. You don't want somebody's,

481
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:58,040
you know, like ass pic showing up in your feed. I understand. Exactly. Because trust me, I follow

482
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:04,600
some very good looking people. And I wish I could like more of your tweets. Please don't take it as

483
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:10,200
a it's just I, I don't want to show the world. What a pervert I am. Okay, so that's why I don't

484
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,280
like as many. But once in a while, I can't help it. And I still like a few or it's like, it's a

485
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:21,000
nice selfie. And it's not. It's not actually like thirst content. I like the G rated stuff. That's

486
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:29,240
fine. So anyway, bonds 006 says thank you, Rob. I do not tell Facebook or Instagram my likes and

487
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:36,120
such music food places I've lived school, etc. Oh, for sure. Um, like all that stuff. When you

488
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,200
check in at locations, you're just opening yourself to getting ads for similar things.

489
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:47,320
For sure. Absolutely. And like, I don't I don't know what it is. Loki, do you get this problem

490
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:56,440
on on Facebook? Every other ad I see on Facebook is some new startup men's underwear company

491
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:02,200
of some sort. And I'm like, Hey, listen to you. I swear to God I do because we'll say things

492
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,320
that like all of a sudden they'll start, you know, showing that I haven't searched any of this.

493
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:12,440
Not a topic I often talk about out loud or anything like that. I'm like, did it? Did I

494
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,760
did it track an Amazon purchase I made before I went on that cruise or something? Like,

495
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:23,800
why am I seeing it could have nothing once like that. I like view like there was an ad I saw for

496
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,040
this. I don't even know. It looks like this wearable subwoofer thing or something that

497
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,960
they're talking about, like for immersion for like VR or something like that. And I watched the ad

498
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,920
and I'm like, man, that looks stupid. And now almost like every time I watch a video on my phone,

499
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,960
it's that same ad over and over and over. I'm like, dude, I don't want to look at this. I'm

500
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:47,640
not interested in it. I looked at the ad and it's like, whatever. Or I'll get recommendations all

501
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:55,240
the time. Like if, you know, I buy something that they're like, hey, do you want that again? Hey,

502
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,480
do you want this thing that's exactly the same thing that you did? Like, it's like,

503
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:05,880
I don't need another laptop. I don't need a tablet. I don't need this pixel. You're just

504
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,040
advertising wrong. Pixel pockets. And Chad is asking underwear startups. I meaning like

505
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,480
companies you've never heard of. Like everybody knows like Calvin Klein or Fruit of the Loom or

506
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,400
things like that. Everybody knows that these are companies like that. I never heard of except on

507
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,600
Facebook ads. Uh, and SSJ, Matt and 100. Matt says, I will say redacted because I'm not given

508
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:27,320
a free exposure, um, are fantastic. Well, thank you as to show on her map by typing that name

509
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:32,600
and chat where now I'll damn to see their ads for the next year. I'm just, I'm just giving you

510
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:39,640
our time, but I think that's kind of like how they pick it up. That stuff and pixel pockets

511
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:46,520
just said the same thing. Y'all are giving free ads. Now, tiger claw, uh, says I see stuff like

512
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,840
that all the time and I can deal with it. It's nothing for me to get mad about. I just let it

513
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,080
fly because I'm good at concentrating on what I want to see. You're right. Like it doesn't

514
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:00,920
bother me. I'm just, I'm more the type where I'm like, what did I do to generate this algorithm?

515
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,720
That's what I want to know. Like, is it just, is it just showing it to me? Cause I'm a gay man.

516
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,480
Cause that's, that's my primary theory, but I guess, I guess not cause that's what you want

517
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:15,960
under Matt. I know is not, and is seeing those ads too. So maybe a lot of these companies advertise

518
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,720
on podcasts and stuff too. So I think they just, they just go everywhere. I'm sure. So

519
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:25,560
anyway, all right. Enough tangents. I'm sorry. Dark soccer is not here tonight to keep me in

520
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:30,680
line. All right. Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks. Take it back to video games. Loki,

521
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,280
how was your game week? So I play a few things this week. I went ahead and played through

522
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,080
earth defense force, iron rain. So I finished the campaign on that, which unlocked like

523
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:50,280
nightmare mode and I'm like, no, no, I'm not going to play that because then I had to play the whole

524
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,840
thing again. And the last mission like took like 30 minutes just to kill the stupid boss. And

525
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:02,840
no, that's it. We got through the story and it was okay. So yeah, so I finished that game.

526
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,960
Guts and glory, that game. That's kind of like happy wheels. So I finished that as well

527
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:15,400
and played through all the tracks on that and didn't really feel interested enough to play

528
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:22,760
the user made tracks because those looked like hot garbage. And so I'm just not going to do that.

529
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:30,760
Um, I played a bit of a step mania today. Uh, and that was pretty fun. Hey, quick side note. Sorry.

530
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,360
I'm a tangent. But since you brought up step mania, that makes me think of step maniacs,

531
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,440
right? The Kyle, the Kyle ward and his company, the dance game. Have you been kind of keeping

532
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,160
track on like, um, like their monthly releases? Like they keep injecting new songs every month

533
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:48,680
into the game. Have you seen that? It's pretty cool. My Twitter feed. Yeah, I saw that a lot.

534
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:55,160
I've only played the game once the past couple months. It's been like half songs that many of

535
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:00,920
us knew through dance, dance revolution. Like, um, yeah, things like, uh, and I'm sorry, things like,

536
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,360
and I'm sorry, cause I don't, I don't have the list in front of me, but I think I saw like bumblebee

537
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:09,640
by papaya was in there. Uh, walk a lock. I want to say it was in one of them. Uh, and it's,

538
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:14,920
it's songs that you, you probably found through DDR first are now in this game. And it's interesting

539
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,520
cause they're mixing. It's not just those games. It's like, you'll see one of those songs. You'll

540
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,880
see, Oh, a new song from that maybe you hadn't heard before. And then another one. And then

541
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:27,240
another one that kind of sounds like that Euro DDR sound, but it's not an actual song that was

542
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,000
in the game before, but it's like from that same family. So it's an interesting mix. I'm sorry. I

543
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,280
just, I wanted to give that a shout out and acknowledgement. Cause I thought it was like,

544
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,040
that's kind of neat that they're supporting it every month. And it's kind of like a little

545
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:44,440
mix of old and new. That's pretty interesting. Yeah. It was, it was like I said, I played it

546
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,720
one time when we went to check out, there was a, a bowling alley in Rockland that has a pretty

547
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,000
decent size arcade with all these different music games in there. They have that game.

548
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:59,240
They do have that game. I want to go check it out, except everything's closed. Yeah. Unfortunately.

549
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:07,160
So, um, uh, I could not, my brain could not handle, uh, doing DDR with a center, um,

550
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:16,440
a center arrow or centers, uh, step place. Uh, I can do pump it up. Okay. But DDR, just my brain's

551
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:22,040
not wired to do that. You have to tune down the difficulty to allow yourself to get accustomed to

552
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,400
it. Like you just, you're not going to be able to jump right in and do an expert level song

553
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,880
until you get accustomed to it. They want you to play it a little bit like pump to where you have

554
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,720
to hit like, like three steps at a time, which you can do by like putting your foot in between them.

555
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,800
Um, and so I'm just not really accustomed to that, which is why it was hard for me to do it.

556
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,320
And I couldn't find out how to turn it off and options, or at least I didn't, couldn't figure

557
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:48,440
out how to get to options, maybe. Yeah. Plus a lot of the hardest level songs are designed for

558
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:54,440
people to hold the bar and do the foot flying thing, which is not, you know, and I'm not here

559
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,960
to start that debate. Okay. I'm not here to start the debate, but all I'm going to say is in my time

560
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:06,600
playing DDR, that was something we really just never did. Like, and I, I, again, I'm not trying

561
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:12,920
to start a war here. Okay. I respect everybody's opinion. I'm too old to dance anymore period.

562
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:19,480
So I don't have an opinion on this topic anymore, but, um, because of that, like, I, I cannot get

563
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:26,120
used to trying to hold the bar to do these harder songs. Like it's just, it's really awkward. Yeah.

564
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:31,080
And you know, getting older doesn't help. So, yeah. So yeah, it's really awkward. I've tried

565
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:37,400
doing that before, like on max 300 or something like that. And I just, I can't do it that way.

566
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,320
It doesn't, I can't play that way or like seeing people play doubles and stuff like that. I,

567
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:47,080
I just can't do it. My fear long enough, I guess. Um, and then the last thing I think I played,

568
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:53,720
Oh, uh, Orna played more Orna. Um, so like up to one 70, I'm still trying to grind through stuff

569
00:38:53,720 --> 00:39:01,880
there. And let's see what else. Um, I did play this one game called one dreamer, uh, prologue.

570
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:09,640
So it's, they put out a kind of a little demo taste of the game. And so one dreamer is this

571
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:15,800
like pixel art point and click game, uh, where you hack things. So it takes place in this like

572
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:22,760
virtual VR world or whatever. And you have to kind of pack stuff to progress through the game,

573
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,800
which is pretty cool. So there's like, almost like coding, but it's not exactly coding or

574
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:34,120
anything. It's just kind of replacing values. And it's about this, these two kids that are,

575
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:41,640
um, inspired by one, like this developer of this big, massive VR game, almost like kind of like,

576
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:48,760
uh, the whole Oasis stuff and, uh, ready player one. So they're inspired by him to,

577
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:56,600
uh, create their own game. And then it's, there's some story along with the developer on why he

578
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:01,240
quit and got burnt out and like some other stuff. So it's, it kind of hints at some things,

579
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:06,840
but it's a beautiful game. Like really worth checking out. The prologue is free on steam to

580
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:12,120
play the, the full game is not out yet, but yeah, go check it out. One dream or prologue, um, is the

581
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,520
game you want to look for. And it's just great. It's, it's very short, probably about, you know,

582
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:24,760
an hour, but it's definitely worth playing. All right. That it, that it. All right. Then

583
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,560
let me talk about my gaming week. Um, so since Jamie's not here, I will talk about animal

584
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:35,640
crossing, which I am still playing. Uh, got my turnips today. Um, and, uh, all that good stuff,

585
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:41,320
but the big development in animal crossing world is Alan got his switch on. He got it a little

586
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,000
early. He was supposed to get it on Saturday, but I think Best Buy had it on like Thursday.

587
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,440
So he got his coral switch light. And so he just started playing animal crossing. And so maybe it

588
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:55,640
was Friday because he's, he hasn't even unlocked. His museum is under construction today. So I think

589
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:00,520
that's like day three. I don't know. I lost count, but anyway, he is starting animal crossing. So

590
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:05,000
it's all, it's kind of interesting because Bobby on his show tonight talked about, he kind of like

591
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,040
has hit a wall with animal crossing a little bit for me. I think I was getting close to that wall,

592
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:14,680
but now that Alan has just started animal crossing, it's almost like, Oh, I feel

593
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:19,320
reinvigorated because I want to help Alan and I want to see his town grow and all this stuff.

594
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,960
But what's really funny about it is that because Alan is like the new kid on the block with his

595
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:29,800
new switch. And, um, you know, we, we have several friends, including like Jamie, including,

596
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,000
you know, some of our gaming friends in Chicago and other people on Twitter and stuff.

597
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:40,680
Everybody wants to help Alan. So like the first day he opened his Island, everybody was taking

598
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:47,160
their duplicate patterns, their hybrid, hybrid flowers, their extra furniture. And like Alan

599
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:53,000
is at a point where he looks like a hoarder's house because there is just furniture strewn

600
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,720
all over the lawn and DIY patterns surrounding the store because he can't, he doesn't have the

601
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,680
storage for everything. Cause he can't upgrade his house fast enough to get the storage.

602
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:08,120
Yeah. I, I need to play that game. I, so I would technically be loud than you kill. I'm not even

603
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:14,920
on the block yet. So I would need to play that. So just giving up on it. Just be careful. Tiger

604
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:19,080
class said he should post the friend court on the discord. It is on his social media.

605
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:23,320
If you know his Twitter account, which isn't too hard to find, he did post it on there for what

606
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:28,680
it's worth. Um, yeah, I need to add him. I haven't got a chance to actually get possession of my

607
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:33,000
switch to be able to do that. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. So, uh, yeah, that's just kind of

608
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,840
the funny thing I've kind of been watching him go through is that everybody is just dumping their

609
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,520
shit on his lawn and everybody's trying to be helpful. Like nobody's doing anything wrong,

610
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,440
but it's just funny. It's almost like, I feel like he's almost overwhelmed with having to sort

611
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:49,480
through everything because now he has these random patches of, well, I have some orange flowers over

612
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,640
there that are just all kind of mixed together. I have some purple and pink ones over there that

613
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:59,160
are just kind of all mixed together. And I have three villagers on my Island. He hasn't even

614
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:05,160
picked all his weeds yet. He's like, I kind of liked the way the weeds look and I'm like, no,

615
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:11,080
you need to get rid of them or you're never going to get a three star rating. So it's, but it's,

616
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:16,680
it's kind of been fun and reinvigorating to experience the game from day one all over again

617
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:22,360
through him. And like, you know, like Alan doesn't usually get into console gaming.

618
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:26,200
So the fact that he bought a switch and he's playing animal crossing is kind of a big deal.

619
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:33,160
Like he's like exclusively been PC gaming a long time. Like I can't even think of the last time,

620
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:37,560
like I watched him sit down and play a console game. So this is kind of a big deal. And of

621
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:41,400
course now I showed him more art, you know, cause even though some things I own digitally,

622
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,800
so he can't play them like super Mario maker too. Like I can't like loan that to him.

623
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,040
Some things I have on cartridge that he has expressed interest. He wants to get into like

624
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:55,400
Zelda breath of the wild. So it, it will be kind of fun to revisit a lot of those games for the

625
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:02,760
first time through him. That'll be pretty cool. So, all right. Bonds 006 says a lot of my Facebook

626
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:08,200
friends are begging others to come to their Island. I like reading their pitches to get visitors

627
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:15,960
without getting too deep into the psychology of it all. I think a lot of that is the time and age

628
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:21,720
that we live in with all of this. My hands floating around here, going on in the world

629
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:27,560
is that you can't really go out and visit people in person. So animal crossing is kind of the way

630
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:32,280
for some people to kind of get that contact with other people. So I think that's why you have a

631
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:37,000
lot of people that are really open to like, please come visit my village, even though I don't have

632
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,720
anything that exciting going on today. Water my flowers, you know, or something. And I'm happy to

633
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,320
go to other people's town and water their flowers. You never know what's in nooks and

634
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:49,720
I usually will keep a stash of oranges from my town or my islands, especially on me and go sell

635
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:55,320
them in other people's towns. So it's kind of like a point for me to go there. So yeah. It's,

636
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,360
it's, it's an interesting side effect of everything that's going on in the world.

637
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:03,400
Anyway, it wasn't all animal crossing, but I wanted to update you on Alan getting his switch

638
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:09,400
this week. Some other games I've been playing. So I got sucked into another sale on the PlayStation

639
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:15,160
store. They had a big in Japan sale. So there was a couple games I got on discount. One of them is

640
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:21,000
Taiko no Tatujin on PlayStation 4. I think it's called, maybe somebody in chat can correct me.

641
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,960
I think it's Taiko no Tatujin Drum Master is the subtitle of it, but it's like, it's the PlayStation

642
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:31,000
4 release of Taiko no Tatujin. So speaking of music games, you know, this is one that goes

643
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,640
way back, right? Like Taiko no Tatujin, when was the first round of those games? Probably in the

644
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:41,480
PS2 era. And if you don't know, like there's a, there's a tiny little drum or in the arcade,

645
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:46,360
it's a big drum and you can kind of, you either hit it in the middle, the left or the right side

646
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:51,400
on the red notches, or you hit it on the rim with the blue notches on the left or the right side.

647
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,400
And I was always kind of like, I don't know how that's really going to translate well to controller,

648
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,600
but since it was on sale for like 14 bucks, I was like, eh, screw it. I'll pick it up.

649
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:03,560
And so I did, and it's kind of fun to play on controller. They did it in a way where

650
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:11,240
right and down or X and O, I think if I'm remembering my symbols right, are the inside,

651
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:17,160
the reds. So it's like the inside of the controller is where you hit for the red and then

652
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:23,880
the outside or the L1, R1 or L2, R2 are the blue ones. And you can hit those for the blue ones.

653
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:29,000
So it actually, it makes it easy to kind of like do a drum roll, like you would with the sticks.

654
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,160
So it's actually, it's not too terribly laid out. And I've been playing a variety,

655
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:37,880
it's got a huge song list. No songs you would really know probably unless there are some

656
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:42,280
classical songs in it. And there's a lot of anime songs in it. I don't follow anime so closely,

657
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,800
but like the theme of Doraemon is in it. And so some of you that follow anime a little better

658
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:52,120
than I do will probably recognize stuff in it. And there's a lot of J-pop in it. And so I don't know

659
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:57,320
if these songs are huge or not, cause I haven't really listened to them before, but they were

660
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:01,000
catchy. There was a song in there called Linda Linda, I thought was really, really catchy.

661
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:08,280
So, cause like, it's like a rock song. It goes, what? Any Katamari track? No, there's no Katamari

662
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:13,000
track, but they do have other game soundtrack songs, including it was weird. It's the Pac-Man

663
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:19,000
song, but when it was in Ridge Racer. So it's the Ridge Racer Pac-Man song. That is one of

664
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,720
the songs in the game. And there's like a Soul Calibur 6 song and things like that. So, yeah.

665
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:31,240
Oh, Bonds 006 says, what was the ripoff? This or Donkey Kong? I think Donkey Kong was after

666
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:38,600
Taika. They were about the same time. It was, I think it was after. Was it? Was it technically,

667
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:44,120
did Namco have input on that game? Was it their version of it? I don't remember. And it's been

668
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:51,080
so long. I don't remember. Oh, I didn't know that. Jason, our voiceover guy in chat saying Linda

669
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:56,040
Linda wasn't owned on. I didn't know that. Okay. Thank you, Bobby. Namco made Donkey Kong. Okay.

670
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,880
I figured there had to be some questions. So that's why. So it was, it was one of those.

671
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:06,840
It's like Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine or the Yoshi's forest or whatever it was.

672
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:15,880
It's there. It's Puyo Puyo, but with the characters in it. Okay. Let's see. Let's see.

673
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,480
S2100 Matt says Taiko is such a fun arcade experience. I was always hesitant to see if

674
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:24,280
that would translate to the console versions. And it totally does translate well. Act F says

675
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:30,600
there's also Taiko no Tatsujin drum and fun on the Switch. Yeah. And I thought, I think it's

676
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:38,440
fun because they put a lot of things to do in it. They have the little gotcha reward boxes things,

677
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:44,120
but you don't pay for the boxes. Instead you fill out these little mini bingo cards. So every song

678
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:48,120
in the game, and there's gotta be at least 50 of them, if not more. And there's a ton of DLC. You

679
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:52,120
could probably buy like 30 or 40 more songs, but they want like two bucks a song. So I haven't

680
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:56,840
bought any of them. Um, but every song has a little bingo card that goes with it. And it's

681
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:00,680
a three by three bingo card. And as you do little certain accomplishments, you fill out the bingo

682
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,920
card. And then when you get a bingo three across or down, it's more like Tic Tac Toes. I don't know

683
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,680
why they call it bingo, but when you get a bingo, you get a little coin and you can use the coins in

684
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:14,440
the shop to open like loot boxes. But luckily they don't have like, or at least I didn't see it,

685
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:19,800
a DLC that's like pay $20 and get all these loot boxes. I didn't see that. So I'm okay with the

686
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,560
loot box thing when it's like self-contained like that. And I actually thought the little,

687
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,800
because once you finish a bingo card, spoiler alert, if you get all nine on a bingo card,

688
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:34,040
you get a special bingo card that's even harder. So it kind of gets some replayability value.

689
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:38,920
And I thought the online component is kind of neat. You can do ranked matches online,

690
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,480
but you're not playing live against people. You're playing against people's ghosts.

691
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:48,760
So it has a recording of somebody else playing a song and you're playing against that. And I

692
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:53,240
thought that was a pretty clever way to do it. So that way there's always somebody online to fight.

693
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,200
Cause you know how, like sometimes in these games, once they've been out a year or two,

694
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:00,840
nobody's playing them anymore. Well, nice with this thing being on sale, I can still go in and

695
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:05,480
do ranked matches and you do placement matches and then you're given a certain rank and you,

696
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,320
you know, can level up or you can even go down if you're not beating enough people.

697
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:15,160
And I'm finding that, you know, I'm winning two out of three. So, so far I haven't played a lot

698
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:20,600
of them, but it was kind of neat. I liked it. So yeah, I thought, I thought the, let's see,

699
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,600
active says the bingo cards are only obtainable within game currency and you can't buy that with

700
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:30,200
real money. Good to know. Very good to know. Bobby Blackwell says I have the PS2 Tycho versions.

701
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:34,840
I have four of the games and the controller. Yeah. So, I mean, yeah, this is the first one

702
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:39,400
I remember buying in a long time. So, it's a lot of fun and I'm enjoying playing it.

703
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:46,280
The other game I bought on the PlayStation 4 sale, I'm going to stop for a minute here because this

704
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:51,400
is very important. I'm about to say a very controversial gaming opinion. That's probably

705
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:56,600
going to make some of you very upset. So, I'm just going to beg you. Let me have my shitty opinion.

706
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:00,760
Please don't rage unsubscribe or anything from the show because of my shitty opinion. Okay.

707
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:06,600
But I'm entitled to my shitty opinion. Here it is. The other game I bought on the file, on the,

708
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:13,800
the, uh, uh, sale is the Final Fantasy 8 remake because it was $10. And I was like, you know what?

709
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:19,160
It's high time. You know what? I need to give this game another chance. I always pick on this

710
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:24,360
Final Fantasy game. It's always like the one I say is the worst because I can't stand the junction

711
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:29,800
drawing and all that stuff. I, I've never really cared for Final Fantasy 8. Let me give it another

712
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:35,880
try. And so I started it up. I let it play. I got through the opening sequence and I was like,

713
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:41,720
this CD video hasn't aged very well, but okay. It's, you know, they didn't have time to go redo

714
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:50,040
it, whatever. And then the game starts. Loki. I have to be honest, Loki. It looks like garbage.

715
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:58,440
I'm sorry. It looks so bad. Like, and here's the thing. This is the reason why. Let me justify my

716
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:03,560
shitty opinion. Okay. Cause I already know some of you are like, Steven, look, look, we all have

717
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:10,840
our problematic gaming opinions. This is mine. It's that juxtaposition of this really high

718
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:17,640
definition, really good looking model of like Squall or Kestis and these characters,

719
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:23,480
but then they didn't do anything to the backgrounds, which have not aged well since

720
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:31,400
the PlayStation 1 era. They look very like, it looks like you're putting on a pair of bad glasses

721
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:36,040
and everything's very blurred. And like, here's the thing. When I play the Final Fantasy 7,

722
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,080
not the remake, but the Final Fantasy 7 version that they put on PlayStation 4,

723
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:47,000
it all looks kind of bad and grainy and you go, Oh, retro experience, but something about

724
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:55,640
Final Fantasy 8, where it's like HD clashing with like non HD at the same time. Like I could

725
00:52:55,640 --> 00:53:02,120
not get past it. Loki. I could not get past it. I'm sorry. So there it is. One of those games that

726
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:09,400
would benefit from like that, uh, AI upscaled stuff where they do that on PC or something.

727
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:15,400
All right. I I'm finally taking a look at trash to see, or sorry, take a look at chat to see if

728
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:23,480
they're calling me trash. Oh, and let's see. Bobby Black Wolf says, I'm not angry. I'm just

729
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:29,080
disappointed. DJ Rama S says the redheaded stepchild of the Final Fantasy games. Quest

730
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:33,480
Buster says, I'm not mad. I'm laughing. You stop playing where you want to Rob.

731
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:39,400
Bonds006 says, we all have our moment of let me give X title a try. And Repcycled says,

732
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:44,360
Oh yeah, it wasn't what I expected. Repcycled says the backgrounds are CGI renders. Can't

733
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:49,400
they just rerender it in high res? Like, I feel like if it was that the original files or

734
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:58,440
something. Yeah. And if it was that easy, they would have like, you know, was it 12 for one of

735
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:03,240
them they had, like they found the old, maybe it's even eight or they found the older files

736
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:10,760
and upscaled at the seven 20. But that may have been eight actually. Now they think of it. So

737
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:16,200
I'm going to be like brutally honest. I turned the game off before I even got out of the

738
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:22,040
balam garden. Like I didn't even get into a battle. I was like, I literally just had a,

739
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:27,480
I was playing it and I'm like, and like I access one of the computer terminals and like my eyes

740
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:32,120
are hurting. It's so blurry and bad. And I'm like, I, and then I'm like walking through and

741
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:36,200
I run into selfie and I'm like, okay, let's take her on a little tour. And I just, I hit a point

742
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:43,080
where I just put the controller on the table and I said, I can't. And I turned it off. I will

743
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:48,840
now before you final fantasy eight fans, send me your hate tweets and cyber bullying and hate

744
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:53,720
email. I will try again this week because I owe it at least to get to a battle. Okay.

745
00:54:54,360 --> 00:55:00,920
But so you play on PC because someone did release a pack that they did the AI gigapixel

746
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:05,480
upscaling to four K and it actually looks pretty good.

747
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:09,000
Bobby black Wolf and Chad says the original source code was lost or destroyed or both

748
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:16,280
final fantasy 13. They found the original files and upscaled to seven 20. Yes. And that's the one

749
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,200
I really want to play right now. And I wish game pass would hurry up and add it. So I don't get

750
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:24,520
tempted into buying that whole trilogy again, but I'm game pass did announce they're adding

751
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:29,480
final fantasy nine, like within days, like it's the early first half of this month. So it's,

752
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:33,080
if they didn't add it, like now it's, uh, within the next couple of days,

753
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:37,560
file fancy nine is getting at it. So that's pretty cool. And there's no HD. So I think

754
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:41,720
file fancy nine will be a little easier to stomach because you're not going to have the clash going

755
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:48,440
on of HD on top of not HD. It's all going to be non HD. And I think it will be a little more

756
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:53,960
palatable. May have to check it out on PC. I wonder if I, I know I have seven,

757
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:57,960
I think Alan owns it. So I need to do that whole library lending thing. I don't know. Anyway,

758
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:03,320
there it is. There was my gaming week. Oh boy. I just asked you 100. Matt just clipped. Oh boy,

759
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:07,560
I'm going to be in so much trouble. Sorry. Again, please don't hate unsubscribe. We love you. We

760
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:12,440
value, we value all the opinions. I see you final fantasy eight fans. And again, I I'm going to give

761
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:18,280
you this cookie. I recognize that the story in final fantasy eight is pretty good. And like my

762
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:23,960
problem has always been with just the game part of the game. Like I hated the drawing junctioning.

763
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:28,360
I hated that everything leveled up with you that those were all the things that like bothered me

764
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:33,480
about the game. Uh, originally like it's not the story. So let's just make that clear. All right.

765
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,360
I find people are willing to let it slide a little more when I give that little disclaimer.

766
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:43,800
All right, let's get into some gaming news and what's been going on in the world this week.

767
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:50,280
Loki help change the topic. Okay. So, uh, let's talk a little bit about leaks.

768
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,120
So apparently there is this giant Nintendo leak that happened. So

769
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:04,600
lots of different things leaked out and a lot of it was surrounding the Nintendo Wii. And so

770
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:12,440
they had stuff like with old Pokemon debug roms and source code, uh, 3ds debug roms, uh,

771
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:18,200
the keys for all the consoles. Uh, so those are all the encrypted keys to get access to some of

772
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:24,760
the, um, you know, to be able to sign your own code almost on, uh, everything up through the DSI.

773
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:32,040
Then of course, full source code design files, documentation, and everything basically used

774
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:37,960
to create the Wii. So full source code for the operating system, which I thought was weird.

775
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:44,520
It's actually called iOS. So, um, with that, I mean, this thing is going to be hacked. I mean,

776
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:48,440
or he has hacked the pieces, but now, I mean, they could do some really crazy stuff with that.

777
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:53,480
Um, I want to read some, can I read something from the discord? So we have a discord, of course,

778
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:57,800
and we encourage you to join over at vog network.com slash discord. And sometimes you guys post

779
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,920
stories throughout the week and we use some of those stories in, in planning, or you leave a

780
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:05,640
comment that sticks in my mind of, Oh, I need to mention that on the show. So we had a comment on

781
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:11,800
this from 13 forever in chat, um, or excuse me on discord who sent us a tweet. So the first

782
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:17,400
thing was a tweet that says, uh, and the tweet is from an account Mark and 42 that says people

783
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:23,320
love to get all excited about leaks of official SDKs or code, but really rarely are they all that

784
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:27,960
amazing early on in development of homebrew for a console, they can help make things move much

785
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:33,800
faster, but the expense of legally tainting everything they touch. And then, uh, 13 leaves

786
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:41,560
the comment delete that leak is overblown and misreported. Yes. So like for example, um, the,

787
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,640
there was, you know, folks were thinking, well with this, you know, you could have better

788
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:50,600
emulation or whatever, but not necessarily because if you use the exact code or whatever

789
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:56,280
that's in that for emulation, then they can shut you down because you're basically using pirated

790
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:01,080
code, but not to say that you couldn't like gleam some information. Like if you're having trouble

791
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:06,840
with a certain thing or rendering a certain, you know, part of a game or maybe like sound design or

792
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:12,120
whatever the case may be where you tried and tried and tried with the emulator, but just can't seem

793
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:16,120
to crack what it is or how it runs or something. You might be able to look at that code and

794
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:22,280
understand what you're doing wrong, um, without actually using the direct code. Not to say that

795
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:27,000
there wouldn't be some unscrupulous folks that may be able to like clone the Wii system, or I

796
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
don't even know what they could be done with it, but it's still very interesting to see, you know,

797
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:37,720
some of this data that's come out and some of the cool, uh, like little tech demos and whatnot that

798
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:43,800
they had put together with that from like the GameCube and everything. And by the way, there's

799
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:48,520
echoing comments in the chat about what basically what you just said is that, you know, and as, as

800
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:53,160
much as it sounds like this is really exciting stuff for emulators, uh, it could, it would actually

801
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:58,120
damage them to use this code. Yeah, like even the folks, I think with, um, Dolphin or whatever, they

802
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:02,680
said that, yeah, we're not even gonna look at that. We can't look at that. We're not even gonna, you

803
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:07,160
know, we're gonna pretend it doesn't exist type of thing. I think the reason why a story like this

804
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:13,800
catches fire is that for one, the Wii was, remember, just remember how like crazy popular the Wii was,

805
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:19,400
right? And I think it's just that element of TEEHEE, I'm seeing something I'm not supposed to see,

806
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:25,240
heehee. I think that's the reason why this stuff spreads like wildfire is like, don't look at that.

807
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:30,040
What? Right? Like everybody wants to see it. What's this like, you know,

808
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:33,560
assuming that they have like all this stuff out there, obviously like, you're not going to see

809
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:39,640
emulator of teams or whatever using this data or they, they probably wouldn't be using this data,

810
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:44,840
but who's to say that you couldn't like someone couldn't fork one of those emulators or whatever

811
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:49,480
and start incorporating that code or some, somehow to do it, you know, under the radar or whatever,

812
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:54,440
or, you know, you have some unscrupulous folks developing, you know, mod chips or something

813
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:59,320
into these where they could bypass something or learn how to sign code a certain way. And you

814
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:05,560
could, I don't know what you could do with it. Not for me to, to really say, because I don't know

815
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:10,200
how to do any of this stuff. So we'll have to see what happens with it. And the thought is that there

816
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:14,040
may actually be more data that's out there that hasn't been leaked yet, that this is only a

817
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:21,480
portion of it. So I'm curious to see what happens. Uh, bonds 006 asks, will we get an explosion of

818
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:27,960
home brew from this? And I'm kind of, I'm kind of like, I don't, I don't see it being more or

819
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:32,920
less than what's already being made. Right. We already had a lot of home brew because remember

820
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:36,520
there was that whole installing the home brew channel on your Wii. Remember the whole thing.

821
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:41,880
So you could run like home brew software. Like that was all still big when the Wii was still

822
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:47,960
like a current piece of hardware. So I don't see it exploding now. Well, like, here's my thought

823
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:53,240
with this, like, could it be possible for somebody to like, say, you know how we have right now where

824
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:58,200
folks can create their own NES cartridges or something like that. They're able to build it.

825
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:03,720
So it can actually run on the real hardware could maybe someone home brew a Wii game and build it so

826
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:08,200
that it can run on the actual hardware and be able to sign it correctly so that the system thinks

827
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:14,120
it's, you know, an actual legit copy of a, you know, disc or something like that. Or I don't

828
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:19,080
know what you could really do with it. In theory. Yes. Although you're going to hit that same

829
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:25,240
problem where Nintendo is going to pursue it and shut it down. However, this does be, I mean,

830
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:29,800
we're all quick to kind of say, Nintendo will sue it. Nintendo will shut it down. What if it comes

831
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:36,200
from a country where they don't give a shit about copyright? No, that's a serious question. What

832
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:40,680
happens if it comes from a country that doesn't give a shit about copyright? Then it's a little

833
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:47,160
harder. That argument becomes a little more complex. Yeah. I mean, if they try to sell it

834
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:53,560
here that then it's not, well, now it's happening here, but could this open up things in other

835
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:58,360
countries? I don't know. It's really hard question to take on. I also kind of think it maybe is a lot

836
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:03,720
of work. It's kind of one of those like lots of work, maybe. I don't know. I, again, I feel like

837
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:09,640
most things that would be exist for home brew development emulation on the Wii have probably

838
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:13,560
happened. Although, sure, the emulation can always get better and it can get stronger,

839
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:18,360
but the reputable, respectable teams are not going to be diving into this because they know they

840
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:24,120
can't. Yeah. No. One of the things that was interesting that was also leaked out of it was

841
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:30,120
the official Game Boy emulator. So I'm assuming this is what was running on like a DS or something

842
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:35,400
like that to run, or maybe, I don't know if it was necessarily a DS. I can't remember where they

843
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:42,280
had like game. No, the original DS ran color. Well, it ran advantage games. Did it run the,

844
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:49,240
well, the advantage ran Game Boy color game. Did it have Game Boy hardware in it? Like it had like

845
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:53,240
the same chip on there or I don't know. Was that actually emulated? Can you look at the documents

846
01:03:53,240 --> 01:04:00,680
and tell me, okay, let's find the documents that download all three gigs of that from wherever it

847
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:06,680
is somewhere out there. Oh, Oh yeah. You'll find it easily on 4chan. Oh, that's going to be a fun

848
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:13,880
journey. Yeah. I don't think I'll be doing that. Yeah. The needle is in the haystack,

849
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:19,560
but just so you know, the haystack is full of bees. Yeah. So anyways, so where this actually

850
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:24,440
came from, since, you know, we didn't really discuss that is it was coming from Broadon,

851
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:30,200
which is, or at least that's where the thought is where they came from. So Broadon was a company

852
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:37,160
that was in, I believe China that was developed. They developed the IQ system, which I think that

853
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:45,720
was that a GameCube, the Panasonic player, the Panasonic Q that one. No, it was the IQ. No,

854
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:49,320
you're right. I think Jamie's highlighted that on the show like a long time ago, but yes, I know

855
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:54,360
what you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, apparently the thought is that's where this is

856
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:59,800
from. Although why would the source code for like Pokemon games be in there or the Wii operating

857
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:04,520
system and stuff? I wouldn't think this would be something that would be a part of that, but

858
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:09,640
I don't know. Maybe they were working on a Wii device or something. Who knows? Who knows?

859
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:15,320
Maybe. Who knows? All right. Well, can we see what Smarter Minds will do with it?

860
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:19,880
Well, or, or not. Cause they can't. It's just one of those. That's interesting. Okay. Yeah.

861
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:23,960
So I totally get the perspective of the comment and discord. That's kind of like,

862
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:28,120
people are making this a much bigger deal than it is. And I think it's, it's just one of those

863
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:31,960
we're seeing something we're not supposed to see it's insider information, but there's going

864
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:35,720
to be people that download it that have no idea like what to even do with it. You know what I

865
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:38,840
mean? They're going to download it just because they're told they're not supposed to have it.

866
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:44,920
And that's, that's why this story is catching everywhere here. Something you're not supposed

867
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:49,560
to have is on the parts of the internet. You rarely visit. All right. Anyway,

868
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:56,040
let's move on and talk about some other news. Uh, this is one of those, this is a bummer,

869
01:05:56,040 --> 01:06:02,040
but is anyone really surprised? The 2020 Tokyo game show has been canceled this year. And of

870
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:07,240
course, as you can imagine, it's because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Uh, so it will not be happening

871
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:11,800
this year and it will be replaced with an online showcase. Uh, an official statement from Tokyo

872
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:17,080
game show says due to the outbreak of novel coronavirus or COVID-19 on a global scale.

873
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:22,040
And the situation remains unpredictable in Japan as well. The organizer and the co-organizers have

874
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:26,680
reached this decision after a long consideration to place the utmost priority on the health and

875
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:32,200
safety of visitors, exhibitors, and stakeholders. We ask for your kind understanding and cooperation.

876
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:36,680
Um, and again, I don't think anyone's really surprised by this. Some people may be surprised,

877
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:42,200
like, isn't it a little early for this to cancel? Like we still have things like, you know, the,

878
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:46,440
the talk has been going on about things around labor day weekend, like dragon con, you know,

879
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:50,760
still haven't canceled and we've already gotten into those reasons and so forth and the legal

880
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:55,400
stuff behind it. And, you know, Bobby took a deep dive on that if you want to hear all that.

881
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:59,720
But I think also the reality is with something like Tokyo game show, you know, you have all these

882
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:04,920
exhibitors and they've got to prepare things. They've got to plan their booths. They've got

883
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:09,320
a plan, you know, all these things that go into it. And if they kind of know like, all right,

884
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:13,640
big events are not going to be happening for the rest of the year. Like, you know,

885
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:16,760
all of the scientists are telling us this and everything's kind of pointing to that.

886
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:22,520
Then why have people waste their energy this far out in planning their demos, planning their

887
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:26,440
boosts, planning all of that stuff to something that they just know is not going to happen.

888
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:33,720
And I think that's why it cancels this far out. So pretty much, I would just expect at this point

889
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:38,680
that any 2020 convention just ain't happening. Um, I'm going to cross my fingers and tell,

890
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:42,680
I'm still hoping for a miracle. I'm still, I'm still hoping dragon con can happen. I'm,

891
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:47,560
I'm an idiot. And the reason why, you know, I'm like, well, you know, it took us a couple months,

892
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:52,600
like go, uh, go two months ago to, uh, where we were at then. That was right when this whole

893
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:56,680
thing was starting. So two months from now is going to be July and who knows where we're going

894
01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:01,800
to be by then. You know? Yes. Yes. I listened to science. Yes. I know a lot of the news isn't good.

895
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:06,760
So sue me if I want to be a little bit optimistic. All right. Give me, give me something. Cause I'm

896
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:10,360
getting fucking sick of being at home too. Just like everybody else. And yes, I'll do it. Yes.

897
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:14,280
I understand the importance of it. No, I'm not going to be down there protesting that I want my

898
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:18,520
haircut because I understand that something, you know, I have a dad who's 80 years old.

899
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:23,480
I need to make sure he's okay. So I'm doing my part in everything. But, um, you know,

900
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:28,600
it's just one of those, like, I wish it would happen, but I'm accepting the reality. It's

901
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:33,080
probably not. And so that goes with pretty much any of the big game shows, any of the big

902
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:38,200
conventions and so forth. So we have to start seeing now, if some of this starts to dip into

903
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:44,600
2021, what happens with stuff in January, like magfest and so forth? Who knows? Who knows? Yeah,

904
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:48,520
it's just, I think it really is too early to say at this point, but maybe some of that will start

905
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:55,080
getting evaluated over the summer and things like that. So, uh, anyway, um, you know, it's, um,

906
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:00,920
it's not particularly surprising here. It gets canceled. It'll be interesting to see what they

907
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:05,320
do in the virtual space. Now we know it's going to be a virtual convention. So what is that going

908
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:09,560
to look like? Is it something you're going to have to pay to access, to see trailers and

909
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:13,720
maybe pay, play some demos online or something? I don't know. Uh, or, or what is it going to be?

910
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:17,640
Or is it just going to be a drip feeding of trailers or something like that? Who knows

911
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:21,240
more to come, I suppose. So let's move on to our next story. Loki.

912
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:32,840
All right. So, uh, Roblox has had a user breach. Basically what happened was, is there was this,

913
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:40,200
a hacker that bribed, uh, one of the Roblox, I guess, employees to gain access to their backend

914
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:47,880
customer support panel. And apparently using that, they were able to take a hold and gain

915
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:54,040
access to some of the more prominent Roblox players that are out there. Um, if there's

916
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:59,480
such a thing and they were able to do things as, you know, see the user's email addresses,

917
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:05,560
change passwords, remove two factor authentication from the accounts, ban users and more.

918
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:13,080
Apparently there was some folks on there that, you know, some of these, you know, high, more popular,

919
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:18,120
like streamers or whatever that had private emails that were tied to that. And they were getting

920
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:23,640
contacted by this guy as well to, you know, basically he was bragging that he had their

921
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:31,320
account or something. So it's, it's interesting, um, that they let this happen. Apparently it was

922
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:40,280
a small set of users that had this happen to them, but still kind of ridiculous that it was somebody

923
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:47,160
that basically fished their way into the system. But apparently those folks that did have their

924
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:54,840
accounts compromised were contacted, um, by the hacker. Yeah. And I think it's kind of funny

925
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:59,880
cause I don't know if you kind of brushed Roblox off there at the beginning, but Roblox is huge

926
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:06,680
online. I understand it is my kids play it all the time. Yeah. It's more of a tween audience,

927
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:13,160
I suppose. Mostly it's one of the, it's one of the games that's coming to the Xbox series X.

928
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:21,560
So I see, um, it's going to fully, I've seen the thing is with Roblox is a lot of it,

929
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:27,960
it's all user generated content. And so a lot of it's just plain trash. There's some things that

930
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:35,080
are popular. Like my son keeps talking about this horror game series that he plays, that's called

931
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:40,920
piggy and that there's like 21 chapters of or something. And he says it's very much like granny.

932
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:47,960
I'm like, none of this means anything to me right now. Um, I'm like, is this what I

933
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:52,440
sounded like when I was his age and talking about Nickelodeon shows to my mom? Like, is that what

934
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:58,360
this is all about? Well, no, no, no. I like, I would be, you know, able to like keep up with all

935
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:03,800
that stuff. It's not like I'm getting old. It's just, it's, it's, it's a stupid, um, I get it.

936
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:09,880
He's into the, but like, I'm not going to pay attention to every single like obstacle course

937
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:14,600
game that he plays or something, but he's very interested in like the streamers that he watches

938
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:18,600
that play. And then he goes and plays with them or something like that. Like they'll do a live

939
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:25,400
stream. And so I don't know, but like, yeah, I know it's a very popular game. It's also full of

940
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:33,080
just all sorts of copyright IP theft, trademark infringement. It's all over the place. That's

941
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:38,680
absolute not user generated content. What do you expect? Yeah, but they just don't see the police,

942
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:45,240
any of that. All right. Uh, let's move on and talk about, uh, another announcement this week,

943
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:50,040
which I guess was supposed to be like one of the first, uh, summer game. I even forgot the name

944
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:54,360
of that thing already. Summer game Fest. So they're calling it the format. Yeah. Yeah. I

945
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:59,160
think this was supposed to be one of those announcements, but it was all over the Twitter

946
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:03,640
by within five seconds of it being announced. And that has to do with mortal combat 11,

947
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:09,000
getting an expansion pack called aftermath. It is going to add to the story and it's going to add

948
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:13,480
some new characters to the game, including fusion, uh, who I believe was originally in mortal combat

949
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:18,840
four. Right. He's like the air God. Right. Right. Uh, and then you have a Shiva. That's pretty cool.

950
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:23,160
Shiva was the like Goro, the female Goro and mortal combat three. Remember that? So, uh,

951
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:30,280
she's in that too. And then Robocop because, uh, mortal combat 11 has become this very interesting,

952
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:36,520
like Hollywood versus video games type of thing. Uh, and, and, uh, Robocop is going to be in it.

953
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:43,560
And at Boone in a tweet confirmed, Peter Weller is voicing Robocop. That's pretty awesome. Yes,

954
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:47,320
that is, that is pretty cool. Like, don't get me wrong. It's just, it's just like random,

955
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:51,320
like, well, cause what we have the terminator, right. Isn't one of the, it was in 11. I'm trying

956
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:57,640
to remember who's in 10 and who's in 11. Cause it's different. Um, well I know 11 has like spawn

957
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:03,320
and there's a terminator, uh, the joker. Oh, right. The joker. See, and then like some of them

958
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:07,960
like had like Freddie and Jason and, but that was like, I think that was 10. Those are even

959
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:13,080
all the way back to nine. I think Freddie was in her. Those weren't, no, those weren't injustice.

960
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:20,280
Yeah. Yeah. It was a predator in this one. I don't remember. Predator was in the last one.

961
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:24,680
I was in the last one. Yeah. All right. Uh, thank you. SU 100, Matt, laying it out for me. Thank

962
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:30,840
you. I needed something very plain text there. Leatherface Freddie, Jason alien predator were

963
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:36,920
in the last games. Thank you. Uh, and Freddie was also in nine, uh, and, uh, tiger class saying we

964
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:41,800
now have a Robo cop versus terminator in a fighting game. Yes, we do. Uh, those comments

965
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:48,040
from our Twitch channel, twitch.tv slash vog network. This is all coming out on may 26th.

966
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:53,080
Um, so the expansion will have the cinematic story, the new characters and new skins,

967
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:59,960
three new skins for 39 99. There is too expensive. There is also an aftermath collection,

968
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:05,880
which includes the base game, the combat pack, downloadable content. And now the aftermath

969
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:13,160
expansion will be available digitally and also, uh, physically in June for the 59 99 kind of more

970
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:17,880
traditional price tag. Yeah. Well, I always wait for the game of the year edition, but, um, yeah.

971
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:24,120
So I think that should be like 29 99 at most, like that's ridiculous. Cause you're basically

972
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:31,400
saying that you have folks that paid $60 and they paid for that expansion pack to get the, um, the

973
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:38,280
extra characters or whatever. And now you have them pain again, like another $140 or whatever

974
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:41,640
was like honor 20 bucks for that game. I mean, come on. I'm going to, I'm going to give two

975
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:46,200
sides. I'm going to give two sides. Yeah. I do agree. $30 is a little expensive for me,

976
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:51,400
but for the more like hardcore mortal combat fans, I know the story in that game has typically

977
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:57,320
been very well done. So I think for a story expansion, some people may see the value in that,

978
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:03,240
but I'm also of the mindset, like for me personally, I'm like, it'll be by the holidays.

979
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:09,160
This is cheaper. But like, I'm, I'm even saying like 29 99, that's including the story. I would

980
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:15,000
say like, if we're going to just forgo the story thing, maybe 1999, like I still think that's

981
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:21,880
ridiculous for the three characters. I mean, come on. Um, I did like that they added the friendships

982
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:26,520
in the arena fatalities, which are pretty cool. I was going to say that part is free. So there's

983
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:31,240
a free update coming at the same time and it will add new stages, including the classic Deadpool,

984
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:36,600
of course has a K, uh, the soul chamber. There will be new stage fatalities. If you're putting

985
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:40,840
the classic Deadpool in there, of course you gotta have the stage fatality and friendships are coming

986
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:44,840
back. And that's exciting. Like, uh, there was the one of scorpion. He goes, get over here. And

987
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:50,840
it's a big Teddy bear that he hugs. Uh, and then Kano had one where he was starting a barbecue with

988
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:58,520
his, um, eye laser and he's barbecuing. Uh, and then I saw one for sub zero where, um, it was,

989
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:04,440
uh, an ice cream cart or something like that, or no, it was, it was, um, it was the night,

990
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:10,440
the nitro nitro nitrogen frozen thing. Cause that's all the rage, right? It was that.

991
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:17,800
So, and it's funny cause it's sub zero. So yeah. Anyway, I thought that was all pretty funny. So,

992
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:22,520
uh, yeah. And that actually, the funny thing is that kind of stuff makes me want to play these

993
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:27,880
newer mortal combat games. Cause I, you know, I don't care for like these fatalities are getting

994
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:33,160
to be a little much like it was funny when it was comical, when it was like itchy and scratchy level

995
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:39,400
stuff like mortal combat two on the super Nintendo, that was fine. Now I'm like, this is a little too

996
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:46,200
real for me, but if I can just friendship everybody, I'm fine with that. So I might

997
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:50,280
actually be okay with this now that I can friendship everybody. Oh yes. That was that's

998
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:54,360
right. Thank you. Johnny. We'll say points out another one. New, but was playing jump rope with

999
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:58,680
his shadows. Yeah. That was really funny too. So I'm all about the friendships. I think they're

1000
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:07,240
great. So, all right, let's move on. Uh, Loki, what do you got for us? All right. Um, so we

1001
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:15,320
have a few companies swapping their IPs. Uh, basically we've got a THQ Nordic and Koch media,

1002
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:20,520
um, kind of shuffling around. So that's up according to, I believe what Bobby was saying

1003
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:26,760
earlier that it's because the developer behind those games actually as a move companies or as

1004
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:33,400
owned, I guess it says they're both owned by the same parent company and bracer group. Um, so

1005
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:36,840
some of the stuff that's shifted around and I really don't know what this means

1006
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:43,320
necessarily for games coming out, but you've got, uh, red faction and painkiller going to,

1007
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:54,840
um, I guess, uh, THQ Nordic. And then you've got, uh, looks like sacred risen rush for Berlin,

1008
01:18:54,840 --> 01:19:04,200
second site and singles, flirt up your life. So those are, um, going, I'm sorry. Yeah. THQ

1009
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:08,680
Newark is getting those last four and apparently Koch media is getting red faction and painkiller.

1010
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:14,600
All these games we have not seen games for in a while. So, yeah. Yeah. Kind of interesting

1011
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:19,240
that these games might kind of get a new life through it. And also do we, I mean like THQ Nordic,

1012
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:24,040
like another, and I can't remember how this has all been passed down, but it was another company

1013
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:29,320
completely that then bought the THQ name and is now like getting the THQ licenses back that were

1014
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:33,800
with this other company. Right. Isn't that like a whole element to this? Yeah. So, yeah. So the,

1015
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:39,080
basically one of the cool parts about it is apparently action is now back in control games.

1016
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:45,160
I've had this like thing, this USB thing from an E3 with like demos from like the last E3 I went

1017
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:50,920
to, which was years ago. It's Nordic games. It's THQ. Yeah. So, um, yeah, but now red

1018
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,480
factions basically with volition now. So, you know, the original developers. So

1019
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:03,560
I'm all for a new, uh, new red faction game. Yeah. Uh, Questbuster in chat says I want a

1020
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:10,760
new red faction along the lines of gorilla. So, uh, SGL 100, Matt says, I still have not played

1021
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:15,160
any of them. It's that player that gets put in the trade to be waived afterwards. They're not going

1022
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:19,800
to make that game, which I imagine is the, the, whatever that crazy title was you said there at

1023
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:24,600
the end. So it's just, it's the throwaway one they put in there to just make it a little more value.

1024
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:30,600
Oh yeah. The singles flirting up your life. That sounds like a mobile game for me.

1025
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:36,760
But yeah, maybe that's where it ends up. It's a shitty mobile title. Maybe makes a few bucks.

1026
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:41,720
Fine. Whatever. But they probably won't do much with it otherwise. So, yeah. All right.

1027
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:47,080
Well, moving on to something that's been getting some kind of like bigger headlines than just in

1028
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:53,400
gaming blogs. And that has to do with the absence of Nintendo games. And the reason why I think, um,

1029
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:58,120
it's picked up a lot of steam on other news blogs and you're seeing more mainstream coverage of it

1030
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:03,480
is because animal crossing is such a cuckoo bananas meme game right now at this point, like,

1031
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:09,320
you know, so many people are playing it, um, that a lot of people are asking, well, what's next for

1032
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:14,200
Nintendo? How is Nintendo going to follow up animal crossing? And the answer is we don't

1033
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:18,680
really know. Like we know they're working on a breath of the wild too. We don't know when it's

1034
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:23,080
coming out. We know that Xenoblade Chronicles, the remaster, and that's going to be awesome.

1035
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:26,520
I'm excited about that. That's something that's going to happen by the end of the month,

1036
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:33,320
but we don't know like exactly, um, when thank you. Alan's putting coffee down. He knows I need it.

1037
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:39,000
Thank you. All right. Um, so we, we, uh, we don't know like when this is happening. So what is

1038
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:45,640
Nintendo's plan over the next, you know, a little while. So, um, there was a Nintendo investor Q and

1039
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:52,200
a session and, uh, some tweets that relay what a CEO Shuntura Furukawa said, uh, during this

1040
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:57,160
event says that there are other undisclosed titles set to be released this year. Hello.

1041
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:00,760
We all kind of knew that, right? They usually announce things for the holidays in June. I

1042
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:07,240
don't think this is a huge surprise, but the Corona virus pandemic could impact development

1043
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:12,360
as developers are currently working from home. Here's a series of tweets from the account

1044
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:18,520
Cephason talking about, uh, the relaying from the Nintendo, uh, Q and a session

1045
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:24,840
Nintendo president and CEO Shuntura Furukawa says that although the Chinese factory suspended

1046
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:30,520
shipments of Nintendo switches in February, Japan faced delays in putting new units on shelves.

1047
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:36,200
However, the impact on overall business has been minor so far. He mentions there are other titles

1048
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:40,680
they plan to release this year in addition to those already announced. However, it may

1049
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:45,640
be difficult to finish development during the current situation as employees are working from

1050
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:53,880
home. Their forecast assumes they will release as planned. So that could make the E3 direct or

1051
01:22:53,880 --> 01:23:00,920
whatever you want to call it. It could make it very interesting, right? Because they may announce

1052
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:05,560
games and not tell us when they're coming. And I think that should be something we're fully ready

1053
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:11,080
for. Like they're going to announce games, but they're not going to say, Oh, holiday this year

1054
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:15,560
or, Oh, it's not happening. Or it's a, you know, quarter one next year. I think they're just going

1055
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:22,040
to say coming soon, coming soon, soon, unless it's a game that like already is like, damn,

1056
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:26,440
you're done. Like maybe they had some games that are in like, it's going to be out today

1057
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:32,760
type of status. Then maybe those games will come out. But I, uh, I don't know. We'll see.

1058
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:38,840
So anyway, there you go. Nintendo. Yes, they're working on new games. Of course they are. They

1059
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:43,160
were probably going to announce them in June, but this whole situation has screwed everything up.

1060
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:46,600
So there you go. In the meantime, please look forward to more Animal Crossing.

1061
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:53,320
All right. Let's go back to a classic time and take a step back a little bit. Let's go back to

1062
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:59,160
a time when there was no pandemic. Let's go back 10 years or more and visit a classic game of the

1063
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:03,400
week. Every week, typically dark soccer will step into the gaming vault and find a game that she

1064
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:07,720
thinks, Hey, you guys should check this game out this week. Obviously, as we know, dark soccer is

1065
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:11,640
dealing with some more important things this week, so she can't be here to pick the game. Uh,

1066
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:16,680
and last week we had Alan pick the game for us, which was really cool this week. Uh, Loki,

1067
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:20,360
it's been a while since we've heard from you and had you pick a game in Jamie's absence.

1068
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:23,560
I think it's your turn to pick the classic game of the week. So what are you gonna pick for us

1069
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:31,880
tonight? So my pick this week is Duke Nukem 3D. Good pick. I, I'm kind of surprised we haven't

1070
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:40,360
picked this before. I'm so shocked. All right. Well, there it is. So Duke Nukem 3D was released

1071
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:49,480
in on PC, January 29th, 1996, uh, as shareware. And then of course the full version of the game

1072
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:57,880
came out later on April 19th. Um, yes. Share were love that stuff. Um, of course there was

1073
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:03,160
three campaigns that were included with that, but later on they released a plutonium pack,

1074
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:08,280
which is an expansion to the game. They added a fourth campaign as well and some additional

1075
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:14,360
things to that. So of course the shareware version of the game, um, you had the first original

1076
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:23,400
episode, which was episode one, uh, LA meltdown. And then of course episode two, a lunar apocalypse

1077
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:29,560
that was, uh, in the full version. And then episode three shrapnel city. And then in the

1078
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:36,040
atomic edition they had episode four, uh, birth. And then one of the things about Duke Nukem was

1079
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:43,080
it was pretty cutting edge for the, the game engine. So it was built off of this build 3d

1080
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:49,480
engine, which was, um, developed from 3d realms and it could do a lot of things that like doom

1081
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:56,520
couldn't do necessarily. Um, so it added a lot of new gameplay features to it. One of the things

1082
01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:02,520
though with Duke Nukem cause originally Duke Nukem was this old side scrolling, uh, kind of

1083
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:09,000
action game, a side scrolling platform game. So they of course, you know, brought it out

1084
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:16,520
kind of this ultraviolet crass, uh, game. And so of course it got in trouble with some of the

1085
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:22,920
retailers out there for, you know, having pixelated strippers in there or just, you know,

1086
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:30,040
poop jokes and bad language and all that kind of stuff. Um, of course one of the main, um,

1087
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:38,680
selling points of Duke Nukem is John St. John who voices Duke Nukem himself. And, um, really,

1088
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:47,000
I mean, I played a ton of this just, I remember I actually, I own the game, the full version of it.

1089
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:52,200
Then I was building levels for it because you could actually use, there was a level editor that

1090
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:57,560
was, I think included with the game and you could go in there and like build your own levels out

1091
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:02,840
and actually play them in game and play them even in multiplayer. Uh, which it was one of the first

1092
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:07,080
games to offer a multiplayer over the internet, which is pretty cool. Of course we always just

1093
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:14,600
do it through LAN and, um, yeah, so lots of cool stuff. Uh, some of the other fun things about

1094
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:19,400
Duke Nukem was all the different expansion packs you could buy. So this was the kind of thing you

1095
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:23,560
would see, you know, in your Babbage's or software, et cetera, or whatever, they would have all these

1096
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:30,120
expansion packs where folks would create brand new campaigns that would either, uh, total conversion

1097
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:38,040
the game or just add to it. Uh, so they had Duke's Caribbean life's a beach, uh, Duke nuclear winter.

1098
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:45,480
I think I had Duke it out in DC and there was a Duke Nukem's penthouse paradise, stuff like that.

1099
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:51,800
Um, of course each campaign of the actual game had a lot of parodies of different, uh, pop culture

1100
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:57,640
things. So of course, you know, with, uh, the atomic edition, I remember there was a level in

1101
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:03,480
there that was very much it's, uh, babe land, which is just like Disneyland. So they even

1102
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:08,360
had like a pirates of the Caribbean ride and stuff like that. Of course, you know, there's pig cops

1103
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:13,720
everywhere. Um, there's lots of different lines in the game that were drawn from like aliens,

1104
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:20,040
dirty Harry evil dead to full metal jacket, jaws, pulp fiction, and they live. Um,

1105
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:26,600
there's all sorts of parodies for like Shawshank redemption, uh, 2001 space Odyssey,

1106
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:31,560
I mean, it was just full of pop culture references and even some that are kind of

1107
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:38,840
dated nowadays, like they have the Exxon Valdez in there, which no one remembers that. Um, but yeah.

1108
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:44,680
And then of course, um, even more recently, we just got an episode five alien world order,

1109
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:50,360
and that was with the 20th anniversary world tour, uh, that was just released. And of course,

1110
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:56,040
Duke Nukem has been released so many times, uh, different console ports. Of course you had it on

1111
01:28:56,040 --> 01:29:05,560
the Sega Saturn, a total meltdown on PlayStation Duke Nukem 64. There was, um, Duke Nukem on three

1112
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:13,400
on the Xbox. It's been on mobile phones and the Nokia, um, PlayStation, you know, it's been

1113
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:17,560
everywhere. And then of course they even had some source ports that came out later on. So

1114
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:24,440
that's where you get the E Duke, um, and then some other enhancements with that. So it's,

1115
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:28,920
it's still pretty, uh, I think there's still quite a bit of content being put out for there

1116
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:33,960
and thank God it's, it's actually a pretty great game. I'm like Duke Nukem forever, but

1117
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:41,080
I don't know. That's why it's my classic game of the week and definitely well deserved. I think,

1118
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:47,400
no, this is, this is a very good pick and, um, I, yeah, it is, it is deserved. I played a shitload

1119
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:50,600
of this in college. I know I've told this story on the show before humor me. I'm gonna tell it

1120
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:58,280
one more time. Um, of many, uh, I, I played this game in the college dorms a lot in, um, college

1121
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:03,320
and we, because we were all in the dorms, every room had their own phone line and everything was

1122
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:07,640
connected on the internet via phone back then. So I remember I would play this game and then

1123
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:11,640
my neighbor who was also a bit of a computer nerd would sign on and play this game. We would call

1124
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:15,880
each other on the dial up and we would play versus, and the other guys in the dorm used to

1125
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:19,960
love to like, they would run into one room and see where I'm at and then go run in there and tell

1126
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:25,080
them where I'm at and then they do the same thing like vice versa. So it was kind of like a land

1127
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:29,480
thing actually in a way, in a weird way, but in the dorm setting, which as you know, is like very,

1128
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:34,520
you know, compact and tight. Those dorm rooms are very small. So, uh, yeah, like I have a lot of fond

1129
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:38,120
memories of playing this game as a result. And then of course with all the level editors,

1130
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:43,720
you know, this was the first Mario maker of sorts, if you will, for some people was kind of like

1131
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:49,480
making their own Duke Nukem levels. Um, which Wolf Wolfenstein and Doom kind of went through

1132
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:52,040
a similar thing. So it's kind of like all these games around the same time, you know?

1133
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:57,480
Yeah. And I, I had actually made some, like I said, some levels in it as well. One of the levels

1134
01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:03,800
that I made that was kind of ridiculous was this whole, I think I made like this like flooded city

1135
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:08,680
thing. And I remember there was one that I made also that was like a big water slide that just

1136
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:14,600
looped around. And so one of the things you could do in the game is a raise and lower floors with

1137
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:20,280
like the page up, page down keys. There's no limit to how long you can lower that floor.

1138
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:26,040
Yeah. So I put a paperweight on the page down and I went and had lunch for an hour and came back

1139
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:30,760
and it had like a 15 minute drop in the game, which is hilarious. That's amazing. Um,

1140
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:35,720
so yeah, good times. There you go. Uh, there it is your classic of the week, Duke Nukem, which,

1141
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:41,480
um, you can easily check out on like steam, like, you know, there's a, or even a Google games has

1142
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:46,200
it as well. I mean, there's all sorts of additions that are out there. It's always on sale. Um,

1143
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:50,520
there's, I think there's still a lot of people even making modded levels and stuff today. And

1144
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:55,560
I am pretty sure there's probably some more fancier versions of Duke Nukem that people

1145
01:31:55,560 --> 01:32:03,240
are modded in. Like I, I won't, won't be surprised when I see Ray tracing and Duke Nukem three.

1146
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:10,120
So, uh, bonds to bonds, double six and chat says, LOL. So Rob invented land in college. No,

1147
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:13,960
I didn't invent. I'm not like trying to say I invented the internet. I said it was like

1148
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:21,240
land. Uh, and VG realness says, well, she is that old. So it's possible. Rude. Rude as hell.

1149
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:25,560
You didn't have to do that. Uh, let's see. Uh, as she went under, Matt says someone made a

1150
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:31,400
Duke Nukem level of the dorm floors at school that became a local Fox news, angry parents segment.

1151
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:39,000
Oh no, I can, I see it though. I, I, I feel like I tried to recreate a building. I knew in one of

1152
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:43,800
the, yeah, we tried to recreate our neighborhood too at one point, but it's, it's hard to,

1153
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:50,440
it's hard to, one of the limitations that you had with, um, or the build engine is you can't have,

1154
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:55,720
and this may have been just an initial like build stuff. So Duke Nukem era, not necessarily in,

1155
01:32:55,720 --> 01:33:01,000
um, some of the other games that they made with that, but you couldn't have floors above floors.

1156
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:05,000
And so you couldn't really create like a two story house or something like that. You have to have it

1157
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:09,560
just solid floors and there's like tricks you could do to kind of like get around some of that

1158
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:15,720
stuff. But it, it's still, it was kind of limiting what you could do with it. Now there's further

1159
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:21,320
games that made a use of the build engine and enhanced it. So like, I remember redneck rampage

1160
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:28,120
was one that I played a lot of and, um, Oh gosh, there was some other games that they use that as

1161
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:33,640
well that added more features to it. That's why you have these newer versions of like Duke Nukem

1162
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:39,960
or whatever that utilize these more updated, uh, build engines to add a whole lot of features

1163
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:45,960
that weren't in the original game in the first place. All right. Lots of, yeah, it's just the

1164
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:50,200
way people have expanded on this game over the years and it's still kind of relevant in many

1165
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:54,840
ways. It's just, yeah, it's, it's a true classic. I'm glad you picked it. Good job. All right. And

1166
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:58,360
even if dark soccer isn't a big fan of first person shooters, I feel like she, she, she,

1167
01:33:58,360 --> 01:34:02,280
even she can recognize that this is, this is something that is deserving. Hey, at least it's

1168
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:08,280
not halo. There's that. All right. Uh, let's move on. We have some rapid fire news, some other

1169
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:13,160
things to talk about quickly. Um, and then we'll get back into some more news, lots more news to

1170
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:17,960
talk about and, uh, get your, uh, comments in our, uh, just, uh, get your comments on in our chat

1171
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:23,720
room over at twitch.tv slash vog network before the night is over. Uh, let's get to the rapid

1172
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:31,080
fire news. Loki. So whereas we had, um, Elijah would visiting folks in animal crossing last week.

1173
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:37,960
Now we have representative Alexandria, um, Ocasio-Cortez visiting folks in animal crossing

1174
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:43,160
as well. Lots of people are getting around in animal crossing. So, uh, that was something

1175
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:48,600
that she had posted on Twitter and there's some screenshots of people, you know, having her visit

1176
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:52,920
their town and stuff like that. So that's kind of fun. Uh, lots of creative stuff I've been seeing

1177
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:58,040
with, uh, animal crossing as well. Just, um, you know, folks even like, uh, we had like,

1178
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:04,280
you know, sports teams, like advertising things, um, that were using animal crossing for like,

1179
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:08,760
almost like little skits and stuff. So I saw something with like our local Sacramento Kings

1180
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:15,480
team and there was one for, um, I can't remember which baseball team it was, but, uh, yeah,

1181
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:19,560
good stuff that they have lots of, uh, folks out there. Something else to consider, something else

1182
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:25,880
to consider about, um, AOC and, you know, I, I realized she's a very polarizing political figure,

1183
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:30,040
whatever, but the thing to remember about politicians, they really are just like us.

1184
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:35,400
And, you know, with AOC, she, she likes drag race. She likes video games like animal crossing.

1185
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:40,120
She's not that different from a lot of people her age that, you know, I think we know. And I know,

1186
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:43,480
again, I've told this story on the show before and I probably don't need to tell it again,

1187
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:47,800
but I used to date a politician that ran for office. And trust me, if there's one thing I

1188
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:54,680
learned from that relationship, any idiot can run for office. Okay. So, you know, uh, it's,

1189
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:58,360
even though it's kind of one of those things was like, Ooh, a politician is playing animal

1190
01:35:58,360 --> 01:36:02,680
crossing. They're real people. You know, same thing with the celebrities with like Elijah,

1191
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:07,640
what they're real people. They're all locked up at home too. So here's something that's pretty great

1192
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:12,280
that I saw that, um, someone had offered her to do on there. And I don't know if she took them

1193
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:19,800
up on that, but apparently someone has talk show that they set up in animal crossing called animal

1194
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:25,960
talking, like a talk show set and stuff like that. And they do like interviews or whatever over,

1195
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:30,440
you know, whatever voice chat that they have in there. But I thought that was kind of cute.

1196
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:31,560
That's a cute idea. Yeah.

1197
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:39,880
Anyway. And then, um, let's see. So aside from animal crossing news, of course, you know,

1198
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:47,720
I'm big into the Lego games. And so it leaked out that the Lego star Wars, the Skywalker saga will

1199
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:55,240
be coming out October 20th. And that was thanks to a, uh, Disney YouTube channel video that they

1200
01:36:55,240 --> 01:37:03,080
had for the game. Although it did get pulled. So I don't know if they were jumping the gun on

1201
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:09,000
announcing that, but apparently, you know, it is coming out this year. So I wouldn't be surprised

1202
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:17,960
to see it, uh, sometime this fall. All right. Well, but there's no star Wars movie this year,

1203
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:23,080
right? No, no, no. And this is basically kind of a culmination of like all of the,

1204
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:28,280
the whole nine movies. Oh, okay. I gotcha. All right. All right. All right. Well,

1205
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:33,640
moving on to some other, uh, news, we have some new modes for bloodstained ritual of the night,

1206
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:38,040
the game that is not Castlevania symphony of the night, but it does have some similarities,

1207
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:42,840
doesn't it? Uh, there's going to be a big update for bloodstain to coming to the switch in may or

1208
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:47,320
June. And I imagine it's coming to other platforms around the same time as well. Uh, the dev team has

1209
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:51,640
said, they're looking into locking a release date for this update. And once it's confirmed,

1210
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:57,080
they'll have it out there. The details for what's in the update, Zangetsu will become a playable

1211
01:37:57,080 --> 01:38:01,480
character. And that's going to be a little bit different, uh, because it's, you know, Zangetsu

1212
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:05,400
will not have the same type of movement and combat abilities that Miriam has. So it'll be using a

1213
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:09,560
sword. So it'll play a little differently. Uh, but then this other mode sounds pretty cool,

1214
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:14,040
a randomizer mode. So they're actually going to build an official randomizer into the game

1215
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:17,960
where you can adjust eight different parameters of the game to mix up the experience.

1216
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:23,800
Uh, you can mix up, save and warp rooms, shops, key items, enemy drops. Uh, that's going to be

1217
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:29,480
very interesting. And, uh, I think we'll make for all sorts of fun speed runs for that. So very

1218
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:36,360
cool. Uh, and speaking of switch things coming to other consoles, uh, a PlayStation four version of

1219
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:42,200
blaster master zero two has apparently been looked at and, or has apparently been spotted

1220
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:46,840
on the PlayStation store, like a placeholder for it. So, uh, that has not officially been

1221
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:52,920
announced by the developer. Um, but it's been about a year. Again, this is blaster master zero

1222
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:57,960
two. So remember they like redid blaster master on the switch and then they did a blast. They

1223
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:06,040
did a sequel to the remake basically. And it's pretty good. They did a very good job of those

1224
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:12,440
games. Like I, I, I, I hope more people get to play them. So, uh, they came out on PC in steam

1225
01:39:12,440 --> 01:39:17,800
in November. Uh, it was on the switch in March and now apparently going to be on its way to,

1226
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:23,000
um, PlayStation four as well. I wonder if the original will come with it. Cause I don't think

1227
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:27,800
the original, the original is on PC and the original was on 3DS as well. Uh, I don't think

1228
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:32,680
the original was on, but I could be wrong. I don't think the original was on PlayStation store.

1229
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:36,280
So it'd be interesting to see if it's kind of comes in like a combo pack or something. We'll see.

1230
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:41,080
So there you go. Some rapid fire news. Let's travel around the world and look at some world

1231
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:48,520
release dates or lack thereof. Um, now I have quite a few actually. So let's see. We've got

1232
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:56,840
star Wars one, um, racer and that's coming out on Nintendo switch. Um, we have deep rock galactic

1233
01:39:56,840 --> 01:40:04,360
on PC and Xbox one, two per mega baseball three on PC, Nintendo switch PlayStation four and Xbox one.

1234
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:08,600
And I swear to God, I didn't even plan the classic game of the week to go along with this,

1235
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:14,840
but I guess the timing is great. So coming from 3d realms, ion theory on Nintendo switch,

1236
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:20,120
PlayStation four and Xbox one. This game also uses the build engine that was used in Duke

1237
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:25,400
Nukem 3d. Of course, now 20 years later and even more enhanced, but still in that same style of

1238
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:32,360
Duke Nukem three, uh, we have Hatsune Miku project, Eva mega mix on Nintendo switch. And that's it.

1239
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:37,720
What timing on that? Very good. All right. Uh, going to Japan, which by the way, uh,

1240
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:42,440
interesting comment on discord that, um, sheds a lot of light. Cause last week I was kind of like

1241
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:46,440
the Japanese releases have kind of dried up. There's not a lot coming out. It was pointed out

1242
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:50,520
that the Japanese rating board, remember we talked about a couple of weeks ago on the show. I think

1243
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:55,560
it was like the ESRB was working from home or something, but the Japanese one, the CRO,

1244
01:40:55,560 --> 01:41:00,520
they closed down for a little bit. So that's why we haven't had as many Japanese. They can't rate

1245
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:04,760
the games. So that's why we haven't seen as many things. And I would have thought, Oh, well maybe

1246
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:09,240
they rated them way out in advance, but it doesn't always happen that way. Um, so thank you. That

1247
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:14,840
was a very good call out on discord, but we do have a few things that snuck through, um, this

1248
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:18,840
one probably because it's a repackaging maybe they didn't have to re rate it. I don't know,

1249
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:25,080
but it's the dragon quest X or dragon quest 10 all in one package versions one through five will

1250
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:30,520
come out on the switch this week on may 14th. So that's kinda like a re repackaging. And of course

1251
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:36,200
that is also coming out, um, on the PlayStation four, uh, one other minor release this week,

1252
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:42,680
AO tennis two on the PlayStation four. Uh, the AO does not mean adults only. Sorry. Uh,

1253
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:48,200
that's just the name of it. Uh, and I'm not sure the company behind this, um, but it is like,

1254
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:53,320
it's a real, it's like a realistic tennis simulator game is very disappointed. Yeah,

1255
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:57,800
no, it is not adults only. Uh, sorry about that, but it does, it looks very realistic,

1256
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:02,120
you know, as far as like tennis Sims go. Um, so that's pretty cool there. That's it for

1257
01:42:02,120 --> 01:42:05,720
Japanese releases and an explanation why we're probably seeing a lot less of them.

1258
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:11,320
How about the UK low key? Anything? Not much. Uh, we've got budget cuts coming out on PlayStation

1259
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:19,320
VR. Um, the persistence on PlayStation four and also, I'm sorry, we have persistence on

1260
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:27,400
X-Box one and intended switch as well. And that's it. All righty. Well, let's get to the mailbag

1261
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:32,760
because every week we read your guys's emails participate at orange lounge radio.com is the

1262
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:37,160
place to send those emails and we will read them on the show. Of course, usually

1263
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:44,680
I should have these emails up in advance, but I didn't do that tonight because I'm an idiot. Um,

1264
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:47,880
Oh boy. Now it's telling me the password is invalid. Hold on.

1265
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:52,600
Oh fuck. I know I'm getting it right.

1266
01:42:55,080 --> 01:43:00,200
Oh, help me buy time. Loki. All right. What are you looking forward to an iron maiden?

1267
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:05,240
Uh, well, I w I'm just curious to see what the game looks like. There was,

1268
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:09,480
I I'm getting confused. There's another one that's also kind of like a retro shooter.

1269
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:14,520
That's basically the symbolized or simple pixelized sprites and everything, but they have

1270
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:18,120
like advanced lighting with it. And I can't remember if that was iron maiden or another one.

1271
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:23,960
I think that's a different one. Um, I'm just, I want to kind of check it out. I need to go back

1272
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:29,640
and just play like Duke Nukem and stuff like that. Um, I think when I used to play those

1273
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:34,680
originally, I used like the old gravis pads. I never really got into like keyword mouse with

1274
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:40,840
that stuff, but I don't know. I'll have to check out and see how that game is. And hopefully it's

1275
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:45,720
not too expensive, but great job buying time. Loki. Uh, I got it. All right. Good. Thank you.

1276
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:50,920
All right, here we go. Uh, first email tonight from Robert M who emailed us at participate

1277
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:55,880
at orangeandrea.com to say little disappointed, but understand the circumstances that we didn't

1278
01:43:55,880 --> 01:44:01,960
get to hear Jamie reacting to the release of the Neo Geo pocket color game SNK gals fighters on the

1279
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:07,640
switch got me to dig out my old unit and change the batteries for the first time in over 15 years.

1280
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:12,120
Here's hoping for match of the millennium. Well, unfortunately, you know, with what I said earlier

1281
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:16,360
in the show, it probably will be a little bit before dark soccer gets to it. Um, but we will

1282
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:19,640
make sure to pass along the message and ask her if she's even, she may not even be aware that it

1283
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:23,880
came out on switch, but she would probably also go, well, I could just go play the real thing.

1284
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:28,520
So maybe she did this week. You did remind me though, my Neo Geo mini. Yeah. I didn't get

1285
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:31,480
around to even using it yet because now I want to order one of the controllers

1286
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:36,120
because I don't want to have to play with a tiny little joystick that it came with.

1287
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:40,040
It doesn't work. I don't think gals fighters is on it though. Sadly,

1288
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:44,120
but thank you for the reminder that it came out on the switch.

1289
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:52,680
All right. One more email tonight from Y Y R our power. Y Y R hello. L R when Rob mentioned

1290
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:57,240
trying streets of rage four on last week's show, he mentioned that the game had an online co-op

1291
01:44:57,240 --> 01:45:04,200
for the first time in the series. Well, actually I'm just going to mention the excellent Sega

1292
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:11,160
vintage collection streets of rage that released on X-Box three 60 back in 2012. Yeah, I forgot

1293
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:16,280
about it. Sorry. Developed by M2. It features both the international and Japanese releases of

1294
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:21,400
all three games in the original trilogy, and also features online co-op in all three games.

1295
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:25,880
Plus it has a music player, a challenge mode, leaderboards, and all the trimmings you'd find

1296
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:31,880
in similar collections. Best of all, it's backwards compatible on X-Box one and only cost $10. So you

1297
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:36,040
can enjoy it right now and there's no need to wait for a sale. Anyways, thanks for the show issue. And

1298
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:42,200
it's fine. Even though I'm, I'm rolling my eyes a little bit at this. Well, actually that I'm,

1299
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:48,120
I'm being explained to right now. Uh, it's, it's fine. I did forget about the release and the

1300
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:52,200
minute you kind of like said it, I'm like, Oh yeah, I even played that fucking game.

1301
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:59,560
And I totally forgot. So it's fine. Um, I never did online in it. So that's what caused me to forget

1302
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:04,680
anyway. Uh, but good call out. Thanks for the show as usual. I'm sure that I can speak for

1303
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:09,320
many of the listeners. When I say that we're looking for distractions nowadays, thank you

1304
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:14,600
for helping provide a diversion for a few hours every week from the near constant stream of bad

1305
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:19,960
news. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Warm regards and well, well wishes Y Y R. Well,

1306
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:24,280
thank you for that very kind comment there at the end. Um, we're happy to do so. It gives,

1307
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:28,440
it gives me something to look forward to do as well. So it's like, and it's nice because like,

1308
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:32,920
since I know I'm going to be on camera, it's like, all right, I'm going to have to put on pants

1309
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:38,200
today. I'm going to have to take a shower. I'm going to have to find nice hat to wear to hide

1310
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:43,240
all this mess of hair that I have going on right now. So it's, uh, it, it helps me go through the

1311
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:48,520
motions, even on a weekend and try to keep some sense of a normal routine. So thank you guys for

1312
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:53,480
showing up here and giving a crap and motivating us to do it. We really appreciate it. So

1313
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:59,960
participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send your emails in a future week. If

1314
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:05,800
you would like to have them read on the show. All right. Uh, bonds double six says, well,

1315
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:11,240
actually, Rob, you're wrong. Let me tell you how Rob got mansplained. Yes, I sure did. But you know

1316
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:16,920
what? Luckily I know why YR is, is a well-intentioned guy and he's, he's very polite

1317
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:23,080
and how he does it. So I, I will allow it to happen this one time. All right, let's move on.

1318
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:29,160
Uh, let's get to some more news. Loki, not surprised about this next one, how fast it came and went

1319
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:35,960
right. Uh, yeah, not too surprised. So apparently there's been this, uh, project that's been going

1320
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:43,720
on for awhile. So it's a recompilation, um, project for Mario 64. So basically they were,

1321
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:48,760
um, taking the raw source code for Mario 64. And I don't know, I believe that they were

1322
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:53,560
reverse engineering all of that. And then once they got it down to the raw source code, they then

1323
01:47:53,560 --> 01:48:02,440
use modern compilers to compile the game for other systems, including mainly the PC. So allowing them

1324
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:10,440
to basically use, um, you know, DirectX 12 or OpenGL to port the game over to PC where it runs

1325
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:19,800
natively with, you know, controller support and widescreen and 4k and stuff like that. So pretty,

1326
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:25,160
pretty cool. Unfortunately, like something like that, that would get so much attention.

1327
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:31,400
It has been, um, it's being yanked off the internet, uh, thanks to Nintendo and they are

1328
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:36,520
seeking their lawyers on these sites that are hosting these files. And apparently they're

1329
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:40,920
shutting down YouTube and that kind of stuff as well. Yeah. They're, they're showing folks that

1330
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:47,240
are, um, displaying gameplay from it. And so I have a theory, I have a theory on that. I have

1331
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:50,200
a theory that goes a little deeper on that, but, but is there something else to this too? You want

1332
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:57,480
to mention or, um, no, that's pretty much it really. Um, yeah, that they, they basically had

1333
01:48:57,480 --> 01:49:03,000
these versions or whatever that were out there. Um, but you know, now you can't do that. Um,

1334
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:09,080
I did also find around the same time though, that there was also a web version of Mario 64 that you

1335
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:12,600
can play as well, which I thought was pretty cool. And it ran great. I was messing around with that

1336
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:18,440
with my, uh, Xbox controller, but that's, that's the one that I looked at. And I thought, I thought

1337
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:22,920
at first it was like the same thing, um, which I'm not going to give you the URL, but it's very

1338
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:28,680
easily Googleable. So have fun. Um, but, uh, yeah, I was playing that and it was interesting because

1339
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:32,120
it suffered a little bit, like it was nice and all, but it suffered a little bit from that same

1340
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:36,120
criticism. I had a final fantasy eight earlier where it's like, look at these very lovely

1341
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:41,800
textures, like very weirdly put together. That's the same one. Or if that's just like an emulator,

1342
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:46,840
that may just be an emulator. I think it is. I think it is. I think it is, but it's so fun and

1343
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:53,000
it has saves. And so you can do that, but, um, so let's, sorry, let's talk about Nintendo taking

1344
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:57,880
down the YouTubes because I think there's a lot of people going, that's too far. That's stupid. Why

1345
01:49:57,880 --> 01:50:04,440
are they doing that? Um, go back to those rumors from a couple of weeks ago that Nintendo is

1346
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:10,440
planning a Mario onslaught for later this year or next year at this rate. Um, and one of those games

1347
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:16,760
that they are talking about is their own HD remaster. Now, certainly, um, if Nintendo is

1348
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:21,080
working on their own HD remaster, you can completely understand why they would yank this

1349
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:25,400
other version that's being done. They were going to do that anyway, because we know how Nintendo

1350
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:31,080
always goes with IP, but why would they go after the YouTubes as well? Because if Nintendo is about

1351
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:36,680
to announce their own product, they don't want footage of that other thing getting mistaken for

1352
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:41,960
what they're doing. Well, that's my, that's my bet on why they're doing it. They just doing it

1353
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:46,440
because they can, I mean, there's no repercussions for them doing that because they've done that in

1354
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:50,520
the past about like, remember they used to have the whole thing where you had to sign up with

1355
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:55,480
them in order to have YouTube content for any of their games to be, otherwise you just flag it and

1356
01:50:55,480 --> 01:51:01,080
kick it off the internet. Um, yeah, it very well could be low key, but I feel like it's one of

1357
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:07,240
those, they've got their own plans for Mario 64 and they want to control the message and they do

1358
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:10,920
not, like, I think that's why they're going a little further with this where I feel like there's

1359
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:17,560
other Nintendo projects and weird Nintendo fan things. Like for example, that YouTube of the guy

1360
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:22,680
that, God, what was it? He put the Mario cartoon into a Mario game. You remember that from about

1361
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:28,840
six months ago? Nintendo didn't shut that down. Yeah. That wasn't something he released.

1362
01:51:29,240 --> 01:51:34,920
Right. Right. But they didn't yank the YouTube Loki. That's my point. I there's a difference

1363
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:38,520
here and like how fast that's just, you know, and again, it might just, you're right. Loki.

1364
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:43,960
It might just be Nintendo is just totally controlling their IP. They don't want people

1365
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:48,920
to be making money on YouTube off this because they don't have a right to it's a, it's a pirate

1366
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:53,000
piece of software. You're right. Loki. That may completely be it. But I just, I can't shake this

1367
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:57,880
feeling that the reason why they're doing this so fast and they're doing it so much and stuff on

1368
01:51:57,880 --> 01:52:03,000
YouTube is because they're about to put their own YouTubes out there of an HD Mario. And they do not

1369
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:09,240
want this. Sorry to the developers, but what Nintendo views as a second rate version of the

1370
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:15,000
game to get confused with it. And that's why they're yanking the YouTubes. Maybe walk. See,

1371
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:20,040
I guess, uh, Bobby Blackwell says if they don't take it down, then a different company can

1372
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:24,360
actually do it and make money on it because, well, you didn't shut down that fan's version.

1373
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:29,480
Well, for, for the, the actual game itself. Yes. But we've, we've again, I just cited a YouTube

1374
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:35,160
project. They never took down. So there's like, I feel like things kind of exist in the YouTube

1375
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:41,080
form and these other places that Nintendo doesn't shut down so quickly. If that makes sense.

1376
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:46,680
So I don't know. Anyway, uh, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, Disney does the same thing with their

1377
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:51,400
IPs. Uh, Rip Cycle says you got to slap down people using your IP or it becomes slippery to

1378
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:56,520
defend. Uh, Johnny Wu-Fei says just like the Mario removal in dreams, but there's still Mario

1379
01:52:56,520 --> 01:53:03,240
stuff in Roblox, right? I'm pretty sure that there there's Mario's there. Roblox has all sorts of IP

1380
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:09,720
theft in there. It's it's I don't play Roblox, so I couldn't tell you offhand. I mean, I could boot

1381
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:14,680
it up and take a look, I guess, but no, I don't. I'm sure it's there. I'm sure it's there. All

1382
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:21,160
right. You know, when anybody is presented with a creator of some sort, someone is going to recreate

1383
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:27,080
World 1-1. It's just an iconic piece of level design. It's always going to be copied. So,

1384
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:32,760
all right. Anyhow, moving on. Let's, uh, talk about some other stories. Oh,

1385
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:39,320
yeah. Y'all want some more rumors? Cause I got some more rumors for you. Uh, rumors outside of EA

1386
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:46,040
as to what is happening over there. And, uh, apparently, uh, this is a resource that comes

1387
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:49,160
from, actually, I'm just going to go to the original source here. Um, I hate it when I go

1388
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:53,560
to a news article and it's just like, here's, we're just rewriting what VentureBeat said about

1389
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:57,960
this whole thing or whatever the website is. In this case, it is VentureBeat. Um, so VentureBeat

1390
01:53:57,960 --> 01:54:03,160
is saying that, uh, EA gave investors an overview of what's coming up for the next fiscal year.

1391
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:08,200
So the fiscal year runs from, you know, March to, or April to the end of March. So this is

1392
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:13,160
everything through March, 2021. 14 games are apparently in the works, but they are still

1393
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:16,360
going to be working on, of course, like apex legends and games that have done very well for

1394
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:21,160
them. Those kinds of like always giving types of games. They start to name some of the games,

1395
01:54:21,720 --> 01:54:26,920
Burnout Paradise Remastered on Nintendo Switch, Command and Conquer Remastered PC,

1396
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:32,840
Medal of Honor VR. We know all these games, right? Madden 21, duh, NHL 21, of course,

1397
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:40,600
unannounced sports game, an HD remake of an EA game. And then 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 are all

1398
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:46,360
EA. Oh, excuse me. 9, 10, 11, 12, our EA partner game, 13, 14, our EA mobile game.

1399
01:54:46,360 --> 01:54:52,840
And what is really funny about this article, the very last paragraph. Oh, and that HD remaster of

1400
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:57,560
an EA game is the Mass Effect trilogy. Just don't expect that to also launch on Switch,

1401
01:54:57,560 --> 01:55:01,240
just not at first. Oh yeah. And some of these games are coming out for Switch. Like they're

1402
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:05,880
saying apex legends, uh, possibly on the Switch and so forth. But it's very funny how they kind

1403
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:09,800
of dropped that little bombshell right at the end. By the way, it's totally the Mass Effect

1404
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:18,600
trilogy that is the, uh, uh, remastered thing. Um, I have heard this same thing from people I

1405
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:24,360
know that know people. So, you know, take, take it what you will. It obviously would also make a lot

1406
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:29,800
of sense. I think a lot of fans have been begging for it. Take us back. I'm one of them. Take us

1407
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:33,480
back to the Mass Effect we all know and love. I think there's a lot of people that would really

1408
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:38,840
love if this came out on the Switch, who knows if it will. Um, for me, I kind of like, well,

1409
01:55:38,840 --> 01:55:44,920
at this point, I'd like to see it on PlayStation 5 and Xbox One Series X, but if these consoles

1410
01:55:44,920 --> 01:55:48,600
are going to play the older stuff anyway, then fine, whatever. And it's going to be a very

1411
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:54,360
interesting chance to maybe, uh, remake some of the things that were a problem in one.

1412
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:59,080
Not that I'm expecting like a full H. I'm just expecting like, you know, kind of like the general,

1413
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:04,200
like, uh, zhuzhing up of some of the textures. Like I'm not expecting the game to get completely

1414
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:08,680
overhauled. I imagine all the DLC will be included and all that good stuff, but I'm not expecting,

1415
01:56:08,680 --> 01:56:14,280
like, a huge, huge overhaul, but maybe with the first game, they might have an opportunity to do

1416
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:20,440
things like, um, well, they can really clean that one up. Um, that's for sure. It's official HD mods.

1417
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:24,680
Basically those of you that have been playing on PC probably already using HD mods. This will just

1418
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:30,440
be official HD mods, um, and master, but they can also fix like the, the driving sequences, the

1419
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:35,000
Mako. They can fix a lot of that stuff. And a really good one that came up on Twitter that I

1420
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:41,320
was like, oh, that's a really good one. They could restore the Kayden romance in one, uh,

1421
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:45,720
the same sex romance that they originally cut and all the dialogue is still in the game and

1422
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:50,280
people like unpatched it and unlocked it. They could restore that. And I think that would be

1423
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:55,320
very interesting, um, to restore that. And maybe, maybe there's some other, um, things that they cut

1424
01:56:55,320 --> 01:57:00,200
that they could kind of put back in the game like that. So again, I don't know how much time or how

1425
01:57:00,200 --> 01:57:05,640
much effort they're putting into this, that I don't know. Um, but Mass Effect trilogy, it's

1426
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:11,880
almost certain to be announced, um, throughout this summer events with what's going on. So,

1427
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:19,800
um, let's see bonds, double six says no Sims news. Uh, they remain committed to the Sims.

1428
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:23,960
What is it? The Sims four, right? Is the current one. Uh, and kind of like those always, they,

1429
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:28,680
there'll be more Sims expansions. I'm sure, uh, tiger class says knowing Rob, he'll buy this

1430
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:33,000
remaster. Like he buys every version of the Mass Effect trilogy. This is like Star Wars all over

1431
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:39,480
again with the rereleases. You bet your ass. Uh, as she went on her, Matt says Mass Effect one does

1432
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:44,760
need some cleaning up some parts of that don't age well, graphically. It is on an Xbox, Xbox game pass

1433
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:49,960
if you want to check it out, but yeah, it, it just, it needs, it just needs a little like the

1434
01:57:49,960 --> 01:57:54,920
first game is where they could make the most improvements to bring it in line with the second

1435
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:59,400
and third games. And I think that would be a very solid trilogy package. And I really hope they keep

1436
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:04,360
the multiplayer from three in there. And I would love it if they would, you know, enhance that a

1437
01:58:04,360 --> 01:58:08,360
little, give us some new enemies to fight in there. Maybe I know this is going to be controversial,

1438
01:58:08,360 --> 01:58:12,680
but bring in some of the stuff from Andromeda, which I know makes no lore sense whatsoever,

1439
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:16,280
but whatever it's multiplayer, bring in some of the stuff from Andromeda to have us fight in the

1440
01:58:16,280 --> 01:58:20,520
Mass Effect three multiplayer. I think that'd be really fun. So, um, let's see, we'll see,

1441
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:25,400
we'll see some of the details. Um, when this inevitably gets announced over the summer

1442
01:58:25,400 --> 01:58:30,280
and I'm very excited about it. All right. So, uh, Loki, what do you have next for us?

1443
01:58:31,400 --> 01:58:39,080
Um, okay. So let's see, we've got some information about a Fortnite player who's been banned from

1444
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:44,600
playing competitively. Now this Fortnite player was only nine years old and was playing a guest

1445
01:58:45,240 --> 01:58:51,160
in, uh, was playing arena, which I guess isn't a tournament, but he got banned for being under,

1446
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:57,640
I guess the minimum age, which is 13. And he gets, you can think, uh, Coppa for that as well.

1447
01:58:58,680 --> 01:59:04,040
So I don't know. I know that there's a lot of those like agreements online that especially

1448
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:07,080
like if you have social media accounts and stuff like that, you have to sign and says,

1449
01:59:07,080 --> 01:59:11,880
Oh yeah, you're at age 13 or whatever, because they have rules about advertising to children

1450
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:19,240
in there. And so I suppose if you violate that rule, then you could be banned from that stuff.

1451
01:59:19,240 --> 01:59:25,320
They did ban him for four years, which, uh, based on his age would actually make him 13.

1452
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:30,760
So he'd be eligible to enter competitions at the time. Now, um, I just want to say quickly,

1453
01:59:30,760 --> 01:59:33,720
like, cause that was the first thing that came to my mind too, is that like, okay,

1454
01:59:33,720 --> 01:59:37,640
even though these headlines are going around, going nine year old gets banned from Fortnite

1455
01:59:37,640 --> 01:59:42,760
and you know, those are the big flashy headlines and so forth. Um, it kind of made you kind of go,

1456
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:46,440
okay, well considering kids are not supposed to do things online until they're 13 anyway,

1457
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:50,120
or companies aren't supposed to have that because of the CCOPA law, it makes sense.

1458
01:59:50,120 --> 01:59:53,240
And it's not as sensationalist as a lot of blogs are making it out to seem,

1459
01:59:53,240 --> 01:59:57,000
but Jason and I were texting a little bit before the show and Jason kind of brought up the point

1460
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:03,160
that like, actually you can go around it with parental permission. And it sounds like the

1461
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:08,440
parents want him to be a part of that, but I could, I could see a place where maybe

1462
02:00:08,440 --> 02:00:12,920
Epic has a company policy where like they just, they don't want to deal with permission slips.

1463
02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:19,000
So they just have a policy of 13 or older and that's it. And that's part of what you agree to

1464
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:24,360
when you sign up for the game. I don't, again, I'm, I'm admittedly, I'm not an expert on Fortnite

1465
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:29,400
and I certainly didn't read the end user license agreement in it. Um, so, but that's just a theory,

1466
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:35,480
I guess, that I would have. Yeah, possibly. I mean, I don't know. I would imagine that

1467
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:41,640
there's probably similar guidelines for like other games out there, like, uh, Roblox and stuff,

1468
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:48,200
but that doesn't stop my kids from playing it. So I don't know. I was trying to see, uh,

1469
02:00:48,200 --> 02:00:53,720
considering how providers have to treat COPPA, uh, allowed users data as special, Epic could also

1470
02:00:53,720 --> 02:00:58,200
decide that they just won't bother and not allow the user due to not being able or willing to

1471
02:00:58,200 --> 02:01:01,560
fulfill the requirements of the terms. Yeah. I imagine the vast majority of everyone not

1472
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:05,960
specifically expecting children under the age of 13 as users do this. Yeah. That's kind of,

1473
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:10,200
that's kind of where my brain is at is that they just don't, again, that was a text from Jason.

1474
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:15,080
That, um, that's kind of where I think Epic is at with this is that they just, they just don't want

1475
02:01:15,080 --> 02:01:20,840
to bother with it. So they're not going to let you play till you're 13. Yeah. Yeah. And considering

1476
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:25,800
it is kind of a shooty, shooty, bang, bang game of sorts, maybe they just don't want to get into,

1477
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:29,160
I mean, they probably are well aware that kids are playing it, but it's not something they want

1478
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:34,200
to officially acknowledge. You know, even if it's cartoony, it might just be a little bit, you know,

1479
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:40,360
but puts them in a bad light, I suppose. I don't know. So yeah. All right. Too bad, but I guess

1480
02:01:40,360 --> 02:01:46,280
they'll have to go play something else. All right. Well, meanwhile, uh, let's talk about cyberpunk

1481
02:01:46,280 --> 02:01:50,760
updates. So cyberpunk 2077, of course, that's going to be a huge release this summer. We all

1482
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:54,760
know that, right? Uh, what are the big headlines for this? Well, there's a couple of things.

1483
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:58,600
Number one, it's going to get its own event in June, which isn't very surprising.

1484
02:01:58,600 --> 02:02:02,840
We knew it was going to be an all star game at the E3 that would have hypothetically happened

1485
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:07,640
this year. Although now, obviously with that all getting, uh, tabled because of everything else

1486
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:12,360
going on in the world, cyberpunk is going to do their own online event. Uh, that's going to happen

1487
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:17,880
in June and they're calling it night city wire, and it's going to happen on June 11th. So that is

1488
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:23,240
just, I guess the teaser that's happening. Uh, I imagine that it's going to be the gameplay trailer

1489
02:02:23,240 --> 02:02:28,040
that we probably would have seen at E3, right? That's yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's going to be

1490
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:32,520
probably some more gameplay. Like, I mean, they've already shown quite a bit of gameplay

1491
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:37,640
and that scene. Now that stuff was actual gameplay. Like you watched them playing the

1492
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:44,680
actual game. Like that is a gameplay trailer. What we saw, not a gameplay trailer that is an

1493
02:02:44,680 --> 02:02:51,000
engine trailer. Now, um, I'm surprised. I'm sure no one is surprised that cyberpunk 2077 has been

1494
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:59,480
rated M for mature. Okay. Yeah. Let's talk about why. Um, because of all the nudity and the extreme

1495
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:05,640
violence. Here's the summary. Some locations depict mutilated corpses with open chest cavities

1496
02:03:05,640 --> 02:03:10,680
and or exposed organs and entrails. During one quest, players assist a character by hammering

1497
02:03:10,680 --> 02:03:14,760
nails through his hands and feet, screaming sounds and blood effects accompany the scene.

1498
02:03:15,320 --> 02:03:21,960
Wow. Uh, that is something very interesting. And also players can select a gender and customize

1499
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:28,600
their character. Customization can include depictions of breasts, buttocks, and genitalia,

1500
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:35,160
as well as various sizes and combinations of genitals. So we will leave it to your imagination,

1501
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:41,480
just how free the character customization will be. Did it first? Yes.

1502
02:03:41,480 --> 02:03:45,480
Yes. Did you just Simpsons did it this whole thing?

1503
02:03:48,680 --> 02:03:55,720
But I have a sexy sexiness meter in saints row. Like if, if you slide at the female or whatever,

1504
02:03:55,720 --> 02:03:59,480
it just made your boobs bigger. If you slide the male and made your package bigger. Yeah. So

1505
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:03,720
anyway, it's I, and again, we don't know the specifics. We just know what's coming from the

1506
02:04:03,720 --> 02:04:09,880
ESRB. So it does sound like things are going to be highly customizable in the game, which you know

1507
02:04:09,880 --> 02:04:17,240
what? Cool. You know, uh, people lose hours and hours in character creation mode. Me I'm at the

1508
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:21,400
point where I'm just like, I'm going to select a pre-selected character and then pick the hair I

1509
02:04:21,400 --> 02:04:27,320
want and just go from there. That's, that's how I make my characters in game now in games. Now I

1510
02:04:27,320 --> 02:04:31,880
just find the pre-selected character. Then I change it to, uh, the hair I like. That's it.

1511
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:36,120
But other people are going to spend hours and hours and the customizer doing

1512
02:04:36,120 --> 02:04:42,680
every possible combination they can think of. So have fun. All right. Let's get to the listener

1513
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:47,320
round table. So you guys can ask us some questions in our chat room. If you'd like over at twitch.tv

1514
02:04:47,320 --> 02:04:52,200
slash vog network, VOG network. Uh, if there's anything you'd like us to bring up or discuss

1515
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:56,760
here on the program, we can do that. Otherwise I'll look to Loki to buy us a little time with

1516
02:04:56,760 --> 02:05:02,840
some last minute stories. Yes. And I do have a few things. So, um, apparently there's some

1517
02:05:02,840 --> 02:05:12,520
old phone games that you can play for free. So Gameloft classics 20 years is a collection of

1518
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:21,320
30 old phone games. Some from back in 2007 that are now playable on Android devices.

1519
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:30,120
What old ass games are there besides snake? Uh, gang star, modern combat. Um,

1520
02:05:30,120 --> 02:05:37,640
I don't know. These old ass games. I remember on my old ass sprint flip phone that I had that

1521
02:05:37,640 --> 02:05:42,600
like had the color screen. You remember that guy? Um, it like had a really shitty camera in it too.

1522
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:46,120
And you could take selfies on it. Cause I had like that front screen that was really bad.

1523
02:05:46,120 --> 02:05:51,800
Um, so, okay, here we go. It had games like color games on it. Like there was like a Castlevania

1524
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:57,320
port on that thing. It was really bad. Not sure if you would know most of these titles here,

1525
02:05:58,280 --> 02:06:03,800
but, um, these are, they have them broken up by genre puzzle fun, run and gun life and love

1526
02:06:03,800 --> 02:06:09,800
arcade action and sports and cards. So some of the titles we have here, we have, um,

1527
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:17,560
date or ditch to high school hookups, modern combat to black Pegasus gang star to Kings of LA

1528
02:06:18,120 --> 02:06:23,320
zombie would alien quarantine. Uh, I don't know any of this shit. I don't, I don't know any of this

1529
02:06:24,280 --> 02:06:33,560
generic stuff. Um, yeah, so neat that that's out there and you can play it for free. So

1530
02:06:34,280 --> 02:06:37,480
go check it out. If you have an Android phone, I guess, I don't know if it's on iOS, but

1531
02:06:38,680 --> 02:06:43,800
it's on Android at least. I probably will not get on that anytime soon,

1532
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:45,960
especially cause I don't recognize any of those games you mentioned.

1533
02:06:45,960 --> 02:06:55,160
Um, anything else? Uh, yeah, well there is a video that I guess, um, was in a video that

1534
02:06:55,160 --> 02:07:00,200
was published regarding some technology that's showing like hand tracking. That's going to be

1535
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:06,360
used in Sony's new VR controllers. And they were showing off, uh, apparently there's a paper that

1536
02:07:06,360 --> 02:07:13,000
was uploaded to upload VR as well. Uh, talking about how that's working. It says evaluation

1537
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:18,360
of machine learning techniques for hand pose estimation on handheld device with proximity

1538
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:24,920
sensor. Yes. Those, those research papers that have such, you know, fancy titles and the video

1539
02:07:24,920 --> 02:07:30,840
shows like some pretty awesome hand tracking on what looks like a really old school looking

1540
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:36,200
controller, but obviously it's meant for just the hand tracking and stuff, but it's very, um,

1541
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:41,480
very accurate to pretty much any pose you can make with your hands. So

1542
02:07:42,040 --> 02:07:46,360
pretty neat via interesting to see how that is incorporated into a new VR controller.

1543
02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:55,560
Anything's better than the move. All right. Anything else? Our chats being pretty quiet

1544
02:07:55,560 --> 02:07:59,480
when it comes to questions or comments, which is fine. I know there's a lot of other stuff going

1545
02:07:59,480 --> 02:08:02,920
on in the world, by the way, cause I forgot to mention at the top of the show, cause I had some

1546
02:08:02,920 --> 02:08:07,720
other housekeeping I needed to get, um, uh, talk about, but I do want to wish all of our mothers

1547
02:08:07,720 --> 02:08:12,200
out there a happy mother's day. Uh, whether, um, you're a mom yourself or you want to go

1548
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:16,600
wish your mom a happy mother's day or, you know, motherly figure, you know, uh, pet,

1549
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:20,600
pet moms and so forth. You know, if, if you believe this day applies to you, then happy

1550
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:29,480
mother's day to you. Yeah. I got, I got nothing really else to talk about, I guess.

1551
02:08:29,480 --> 02:08:36,840
All right. Straight up out of news, I guess. Okay. Some questions here. Uh,

1552
02:08:36,840 --> 02:08:40,280
Sia Tabiri in chat says, okay, so I've been enjoying murder by numbers,

1553
02:08:40,280 --> 02:08:45,320
the P cross investigation game, any fun crossover genre games you enjoy?

1554
02:08:46,120 --> 02:08:51,000
Ooh, wow. Crossover genre games. I'm stumped in the moment trying to think of anything.

1555
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:55,880
I don't really play it anymore, but puzzle quest is pretty cool.

1556
02:08:55,880 --> 02:09:00,200
Oh yeah. Puzzle quest is awesome. They have a free version of that on steam.

1557
02:09:00,200 --> 02:09:03,960
And I don't remember the name of it, but like that, that whole model kind of went free to play

1558
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:08,680
sometime ago. Cause like there was, there was the Marvel puzzle quest. That was the first free to

1559
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:12,440
play one I could think of. And now there's a more traditional one. That's all, uh, it's all free to

1560
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:18,280
play now. I used to like back in the Android and this is a pretty old game, but, uh, swords and

1561
02:09:18,280 --> 02:09:26,760
poker, which is pretty fun. Um, um, trying to think of what else is kind of cool.

1562
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:29,800
I always, I don't know if this is considered like John, but I always liked when they did

1563
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:34,920
like the puzzle game that the platformer folks would show up in like Yoshi's cookie.

1564
02:09:35,480 --> 02:09:41,080
And we were talking earlier about like Puyo Puyo, but with Sonic and with Yoshi and some of those

1565
02:09:41,080 --> 02:09:45,480
like crossover. I don't know if that really is the genre bending that you're looking for, but

1566
02:09:45,480 --> 02:09:49,400
that's that comes to my mind where it's like platformers crossed with puzzler.

1567
02:09:50,600 --> 02:09:55,880
Actually, yeah, actually Yoshi's cookie was like a way better, um, puzzle game than that for me

1568
02:09:55,880 --> 02:10:00,520
than I think most people gave it credit for. Um, I also really enjoyed Pokemon puzzle league,

1569
02:10:01,320 --> 02:10:05,960
which is another one of those, which was Tetris attack, but with Pokemon. So there's that.

1570
02:10:05,960 --> 02:10:13,880
Yeah. Um, I think what else? Uh, we've got some other questions here and these are some good,

1571
02:10:13,880 --> 02:10:18,280
good ones here. Um, as Joe and Hunter, Matt says thoughts on the final fantasy seven remake part

1572
02:10:18,280 --> 02:10:23,400
two being in the early stages. Do you think it will get fast tracked because of the big success

1573
02:10:23,400 --> 02:10:30,680
of the first part? I can't believe it's only in the early stages. Come on. Like what what's taken.

1574
02:10:30,680 --> 02:10:35,320
So like I cannot, but this game should already be like, I guess maybe they didn't, they, they knew

1575
02:10:35,320 --> 02:10:39,960
it was a risk and they were worried that the game wasn't going to do well or something. I just

1576
02:10:39,960 --> 02:10:45,000
worry that this game is going to take forever now, but maybe now that the engine is done and they

1577
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:50,200
have a process, maybe it won't take that long. Cause the final fantasy 13, two was only what,

1578
02:10:50,200 --> 02:10:57,000
like two years after the first one. So fingers and toes crossed, but I'm, I am a little shocked. Like

1579
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:04,840
they're just now starting it like, yeah, I would have thought it was, yeah. Well, it, like I said

1580
02:11:04,840 --> 02:11:10,600
before, I think it's, um, less development time for this one because they've already got the

1581
02:11:10,600 --> 02:11:14,440
engine built now for everything and they've got it kind of working the way they want it to. And

1582
02:11:14,440 --> 02:11:20,280
it's now basically developing the content for it. Um, so some of that's going to be kind of,

1583
02:11:20,280 --> 02:11:24,120
I mean, they've got the characters modeled and everything and some of the environments already.

1584
02:11:24,120 --> 02:11:29,960
So I would imagine that the turnaround time for developments can be much smaller, but yeah,

1585
02:11:29,960 --> 02:11:34,600
I would think that. I hope they've already, I would hope so too. Cause I think final fantasy

1586
02:11:34,600 --> 02:11:39,480
13 was challenged in development a lot. Like they, they, I know they changed the platform

1587
02:11:39,480 --> 02:11:43,720
they were using to develop it partway through. So I'm hoping that like now it's all kind of set

1588
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:48,920
that, that they can kind of turn around a part to a faster cause like, obviously if they, if they

1589
02:11:48,920 --> 02:11:53,080
wait five or seven years or however long it took us to get found messy seven remake, like that's

1590
02:11:53,080 --> 02:11:57,480
just not going to work. So hopefully they can get it turned out in two to three. Um, but then,

1591
02:11:57,480 --> 02:12:01,480
you know, you start to look at, well, how many parts is final fantasy seven going to be?

1592
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:06,600
And honestly, the answer is we don't know. There's too many people that are quick to assume,

1593
02:12:06,600 --> 02:12:11,080
Oh, well, because there's, it's only takes you like a third of the way through the first disc.

1594
02:12:11,080 --> 02:12:17,880
There's going to be like six different games to which I say, that's not how it works.

1595
02:12:18,760 --> 02:12:25,080
That's all I can say. So we don't know how many parts it could be. It could be just two parts.

1596
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:29,880
It could be three parts. It could be seven parts. We just don't know. Anyway. Um,

1597
02:12:29,880 --> 02:12:34,040
I was going to say, kind of go back to that first question. A crypto necro dancer would be,

1598
02:12:34,040 --> 02:12:37,160
Oh, that's a good one for genre bending game. Yeah. That's a good one. I like that.

1599
02:12:38,040 --> 02:12:42,280
Good. Good. Yeah. That's good. Those types of games that are like they're rogue likes,

1600
02:12:42,280 --> 02:12:47,160
but they're this too. What was the trailer for? Like somebody passes on Twitter. It was like a

1601
02:12:47,160 --> 02:12:54,120
shooter slash music game slash rogue like. Yeah. So I've got a few of those in my wishlist. So

1602
02:12:55,080 --> 02:13:00,520
there's gun jam is one of those in BPM bullets per minute is another one. That was it bullets

1603
02:13:00,520 --> 02:13:07,320
per minute. So anyway, yeah. I think gun jam is one where you have to like shoot in rhythm with,

1604
02:13:07,320 --> 02:13:12,200
um, there's like a thing that comes up the screen and almost like guitar heroes, something like

1605
02:13:12,200 --> 02:13:17,640
that. Um, and then same with, uh, one of them is just shooting. The other one is like shooting

1606
02:13:17,640 --> 02:13:23,480
and movement and everything is all done in time. So I don't know. It's pretty cool. Um,

1607
02:13:24,360 --> 02:13:30,120
Ziba in our chats asks, did you guys talk about the final fantasy 11 mobile rumors screenshots?

1608
02:13:31,080 --> 02:13:35,880
Excuse me. I don't want to talk about it. Mobile rumors, screenshots, disappointed that it's

1609
02:13:36,520 --> 02:13:43,720
not coming out. Ziba. I did see the pictures and it does look really good. Like in HD. Um,

1610
02:13:43,720 --> 02:13:48,680
at least the few screenshots we saw. And when I see that stuff, I can't help but feel overwhelming

1611
02:13:48,680 --> 02:13:53,800
disappointment that it's going to be on mobile. And that's just the, like, I'm just like, I,

1612
02:13:53,800 --> 02:13:58,920
I still do not understand how this game is going to translate to mobile. And that's like that key

1613
02:13:58,920 --> 02:14:03,320
missing piece for me. And until I understand that it's so hard for me to get excited.

1614
02:14:03,320 --> 02:14:08,760
Cause honestly I see those screenshots and I'm like, why can't you just make a new PC client

1615
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:15,960
with that? Why does they want you to go to 14? I don't know. So that's, that's the part where

1616
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:20,360
I'm struggling. I guess it's all a rumor anyway. Maybe we were supposed to find out more at E3

1617
02:14:20,360 --> 02:14:25,320
this year. Maybe we still find out, we'll find out more in the summer. I did see that screenshot

1618
02:14:25,320 --> 02:14:30,840
that they had of Winhurst or whatever, where I thought that was a fan, like that they were up

1619
02:14:31,480 --> 02:14:36,040
grading the game, like the client for the game or something like that. I thought that was a fan

1620
02:14:36,040 --> 02:14:40,120
mod or something like that when I saw it originally, but I didn't realize that was a

1621
02:14:40,120 --> 02:14:44,760
screenshot from the actual mobile game. Act-deft in chat says maybe it'll get ported over to the

1622
02:14:44,760 --> 02:14:49,800
switch. Um, you know, that's some mobile games do end up on the switch like that. So I guess

1623
02:14:50,600 --> 02:14:56,120
even if we're talking about a mobile game, it isn't impossible that it ends up on consoles.

1624
02:14:56,120 --> 02:15:00,600
For example, the, um, you know, that game I really liked last year, that Sayonara wild hearts,

1625
02:15:01,400 --> 02:15:05,240
that game that's very artistic and flair and the music's very good. That's a mobile game,

1626
02:15:05,800 --> 02:15:10,360
but it, they put it on consoles too. It's just a very simple control scheme, right? It's just one

1627
02:15:10,360 --> 02:15:16,360
button instead of tapping the screen. So, um, I suppose anything's possible with that, but all we

1628
02:15:16,360 --> 02:15:20,200
have right now are rumors. All we have is what they've told us. And that is that they plan to

1629
02:15:20,200 --> 02:15:26,040
do 11 on mobile. We don't know anything beyond that yet, but honestly switch would make a lot

1630
02:15:26,040 --> 02:15:36,360
of sense. So you joke, but dot, dot, dot anyway. Uh, let's see one more here. Um, cheeseburger

1631
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:43,480
94 in chat says what's this newfangled twatch chat. And what happened to the gold old IRC chat?

1632
02:15:43,480 --> 02:15:47,160
Oh, you must've, you, you clearly haven't been here in about a year and a half. Yes.

1633
02:15:47,160 --> 02:15:55,400
We moved to Twitch, um, in December of 2018. And a big part of that was that, um, well, number one,

1634
02:15:55,400 --> 02:16:00,680
more and more shows are moving to Twitch. Um, because Twitch has more discoverability,

1635
02:16:00,680 --> 02:16:05,720
Twitch is very easy to have, um, uh, like the mobile app, the PlayStation four app,

1636
02:16:05,720 --> 02:16:08,920
uh, a lot of gamers know what you're talking about when you talk about Twitch. And so it's

1637
02:16:08,920 --> 02:16:15,400
very easy to find us and discover us on Twitch. And the reality was as much as we loved shoutcast

1638
02:16:15,400 --> 02:16:21,000
and being like MP3 radio and all that number one, we were paying quite a bit of money to

1639
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:27,000
run that feed and host that feed. Number two, people aren't discovering shoutcast feeds and

1640
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:31,240
all that the same way they're discovering Twitch. And honestly, and I know, you know,

1641
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:35,960
anytime you maybe make a big change with the show, people are going to say, but I like the old way.

1642
02:16:35,960 --> 02:16:41,880
But the reality is like our number, our listening numbers would still decline, decline, decline.

1643
02:16:41,880 --> 02:16:46,200
And it's not all about the listener numbers, but at the same time, it's like, if we're only,

1644
02:16:46,200 --> 02:16:50,360
you know, there's going to come a point where like, if literally nobody's listening, then

1645
02:16:50,360 --> 02:16:55,960
we're going to be like, all right, well, I don't know. You know, so moving to Twitch has

1646
02:16:55,960 --> 02:17:01,080
helped our audience grow a little bit. And some new people have found us because of that. And

1647
02:17:01,080 --> 02:17:07,880
that's been a great thing. And we get to broadcast this show for free. If you miss the audio thing,

1648
02:17:08,840 --> 02:17:12,920
two things you can always listen to the podcast feed that hasn't changed. And number two,

1649
02:17:12,920 --> 02:17:16,200
the Twitch client, and this is another thing I really like about it on the mobile phone,

1650
02:17:16,200 --> 02:17:20,520
Twitch has an audio only mode. A lot of people don't know that it's there, but if you go into

1651
02:17:20,520 --> 02:17:23,640
your settings, you can make it audio only. So if you don't want to look at my ugly mug,

1652
02:17:23,640 --> 02:17:27,400
you don't have to. You can switch it into audio only mode. And that's, that's totally fine.

1653
02:17:27,400 --> 02:17:31,560
And if you don't want to look at my ugly mug, well, you're in luck for the next few months.

1654
02:17:31,560 --> 02:17:36,680
Yeah. Pod Culture says, I missed the Skype line. Well, again, things have to change.

1655
02:17:36,680 --> 02:17:42,120
We were paying for Skype. More gamers know what Discord is in this day and age. Skype was having

1656
02:17:42,120 --> 02:17:49,320
a lot of conflicts and errors and issues. And you know, there's, I missed the old Skype. I'm going

1657
02:17:49,320 --> 02:17:57,800
to leave. That's my retort. I miss Skype too, the old Skype. So anyway, let's see. Pixel Paca says,

1658
02:17:57,800 --> 02:18:02,360
the only problem with Twitch is that my Australian friend cannot watch live very well. Almost all

1659
02:18:02,360 --> 02:18:07,320
Twitch streams constantly buffer for her, but you can do audio only or get the podcast later. Yes,

1660
02:18:07,320 --> 02:18:12,920
that's very true. And I imagine if the shout cast probably would have buffered a little bit as well,

1661
02:18:13,480 --> 02:18:17,720
that far away. Who knows? But yeah, audio only will help cut back a lot and make it a little

1662
02:18:17,720 --> 02:18:22,040
more, especially if you're in, you know, I don't know where in Australia your friend lives,

1663
02:18:22,040 --> 02:18:25,720
but if it's somewhere where the internet connection isn't as strong, then the audio only

1664
02:18:25,720 --> 02:18:30,680
will probably help a little bit of that. Yeah. SG100Matt says, they don't miss the constant

1665
02:18:30,680 --> 02:18:35,560
battle every time Skype had an update that would bork something else. It's that, unfortunately,

1666
02:18:35,560 --> 02:18:41,080
it is very much that. And we know that a lot of gamers have embraced Discord right now. I'm not

1667
02:18:41,080 --> 02:18:46,280
saying Discord is going to be the only way to do it forever. I remain open to other ideas,

1668
02:18:46,280 --> 02:18:51,400
but we'll see. All right. Anyway, thank you. Great questions tonight for the round table.

1669
02:18:52,040 --> 02:18:55,320
Any other last minute stories we didn't get to, Loki, that you want to mention before we wrap up?

1670
02:18:55,320 --> 02:18:59,160
No, that's it. All right. Then I guess that means we wrap up. So that's going to do it for another

1671
02:18:59,160 --> 02:19:03,240
episode of Orange Lounge Radio tonight. Thank you. Of course, everybody here, whether you were live

1672
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:07,800
on glorious video or whether you were here for the pod or for just the audio only on Twitch,

1673
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:11,400
or whether you're here on the podcast feed, no matter how you consume Orange Lounge Radio,

1674
02:19:11,400 --> 02:19:16,120
we thank you for being a part of it. And you could help us out a lot by spreading the word

1675
02:19:17,080 --> 02:19:20,600
because we are the show where every gamer has a voice. But if the voices aren't here to put out

1676
02:19:20,600 --> 02:19:27,800
on air, then we don't get them. Also, an auto host here on Twitch on your own channel for

1677
02:19:27,800 --> 02:19:33,480
VOG Network. So helpful. I can't even tell you. The power of hosting and rating is really great

1678
02:19:33,480 --> 02:19:38,120
on Twitch. So we really appreciate all of that. And of course, a big thanks to anybody who followed,

1679
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:42,360
subscribed or rated or anything like that tonight. I will acknowledge all you guys after

1680
02:19:42,600 --> 02:19:48,200
we're done recording the podcast for tonight. Just thank you for showing up and being here. And

1681
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:53,320
thanks again to all the gamer moms out there. And hope you had a great Mother's Day today.

1682
02:19:54,360 --> 02:19:58,200
Let's get to final thoughts. Final, final thought. Loki, your final thought tonight.

1683
02:19:58,840 --> 02:20:05,640
So my final thought is I was told by my work that we're not going back. They're not even

1684
02:20:05,640 --> 02:20:10,680
considering us the conversation about going back until at least September 1st.

1685
02:20:11,480 --> 02:20:14,280
So I'm going to be working from home for a long time.

1686
02:20:15,080 --> 02:20:19,800
Yeah. And I don't know how long OLR is going to do the distance thing as well. I miss being in

1687
02:20:19,800 --> 02:20:25,560
studio with everybody. But it's really, it's one of those when the scientists say it's safe,

1688
02:20:25,560 --> 02:20:31,160
then we'll do it. Until then, we will follow the rules. And that's that. And even then,

1689
02:20:31,160 --> 02:20:37,720
I kind of don't want to force Loki or Jamie to have to be here in person for a good period

1690
02:20:37,720 --> 02:20:41,880
after that while we kind of like make sure everything is good, if that makes sense. I'm

1691
02:20:41,880 --> 02:20:50,760
sure you can all understand that. So yeah. With that, my final thought is it was a shorter show

1692
02:20:50,760 --> 02:20:55,960
than usual tonight. But that leaves me more time to go play games. Maybe I can sell stuff at Nook's

1693
02:20:55,960 --> 02:21:00,360
before they close for the night. That'll be good. All right. Have a great week, everybody. Happy

1694
02:21:00,360 --> 02:21:04,360
gaming. We will see you here in seven days. Again, we're sending a lot of love to DarkSakra

1695
02:21:05,320 --> 02:21:10,280
and her friends and family. We'll see you next week to talk more about games.

1696
02:21:10,280 --> 02:21:11,640
Have a good week, everybody. Good night.

1697
02:21:30,360 --> 02:21:34,680
The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those

1698
02:21:34,680 --> 02:21:40,680
of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.

1699
02:21:43,720 --> 02:21:45,720
See you next week.
