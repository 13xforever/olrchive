Come back down for re-entry and join your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki

00:32.080 --> 00:35.400
for news on Luna's offerings announced so far and the rest of the week's gaming news

00:35.400 --> 00:38.200
starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:41.560 --> 00:45.280
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:45.280 --> 00:47.320
where every gamer has a voice.

00:47.320 --> 00:54.840
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back once again on this Sunday, September the 27th

00:54.840 --> 00:59.920
of 2020 with episode number 837 of our show.

00:59.920 --> 01:05.120
My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined not tonight by DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:05.120 --> 01:11.120
She has the night off as it is Yom Kippur today and so I hope all of our listeners who

01:11.120 --> 01:14.520
are partaking in that are having an easy fast.

01:14.520 --> 01:20.120
I imagine we may have less folks here live as a result but maybe some folks catching

01:20.120 --> 01:26.760
up with us throughout the week via our podcast or our subscribers over at twitch.tv slash

01:26.760 --> 01:31.320
VOG Network where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

01:31.320 --> 01:35.680
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show might be catching up with the extra video that subscribers

01:35.680 --> 01:38.840
get for being subscribed to the VOG Network.

01:38.840 --> 01:44.320
By the way, today is the last chance, last Sunday anyway, of September so if you want

01:44.320 --> 01:48.640
to get a discount on those subscriptions we really appreciate it and all that goes

01:48.640 --> 01:53.080
back to help the network and help us pay our taxes every year because we're paying

01:53.080 --> 01:56.600
more taxes than some people.

01:56.600 --> 02:02.080
But please help me welcome to the show someone who I know is paying his taxes and doing his

02:02.080 --> 02:03.080
part.

02:03.080 --> 02:04.080
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.080
Hello.

02:05.080 --> 02:06.080
Hey, Loki.

02:06.080 --> 02:07.160
How are you doing?

02:07.160 --> 02:08.160
I'm doing pretty good.

02:08.160 --> 02:09.160
Good.

02:09.160 --> 02:10.960
Good to see you as always.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.160
What is this behind you tonight?

02:12.160 --> 02:13.160
You've got Bubble Bobble.

02:13.160 --> 02:14.840
You're going to old school and classic tonight.

02:15.240 --> 02:16.640
It's the NES Bubble Bobble.

02:16.640 --> 02:20.240
It was one of the first three games they had for the NES.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.160
Oh, I like that.

02:22.160 --> 02:23.160
Okay.

02:23.160 --> 02:26.560
And that's you just decided to pick Bubble Bobble for that reason or?

02:26.560 --> 02:29.080
Um, yeah, because I had trouble.

02:29.080 --> 02:34.080
I've run through a lot of the games already each week, so like, I'm just like, um, what

02:34.080 --> 02:36.160
should I put this week?

02:36.160 --> 02:37.160
I was thinking there might be-

02:37.160 --> 02:38.680
I guess I could have put a Bethesda game or something.

02:38.680 --> 02:39.680
Yeah, yeah.

02:39.680 --> 02:40.680
That would be topical.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.720
We'll get into that in a second, obviously.

02:42.720 --> 02:47.320
I thought maybe there was a clue there that like maybe the mystery Loki game that you're

02:47.320 --> 02:50.240
making has something to do with Bubble Bobble.

02:50.240 --> 02:54.200
I thought maybe there was a, okay, I need to stop reading into things so damn much.

02:54.200 --> 02:58.400
It's just, I needed something to put in the background and I didn't want to repeat stuff

02:58.400 --> 02:59.400
I've had already.

02:59.400 --> 03:02.320
So it was Bubble Bobble this week.

03:02.320 --> 03:03.320
Yeah.

03:03.320 --> 03:04.320
Fair.

03:04.320 --> 03:08.600
Over in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network, Bobby Blackwell says, my first

03:08.600 --> 03:09.840
games on the NES.

03:09.840 --> 03:11.120
I had the power set.

03:11.120 --> 03:17.440
I had Super Mario.com world-class track meet, and then I had pro wrestling and Top Gun.

03:17.440 --> 03:18.440
This is a good question.

03:18.440 --> 03:24.600
Y'all in chat, first system and games that you had for said system, let's, let's elaborate

03:24.600 --> 03:25.600
on that a bit.

03:25.600 --> 03:30.960
I'm trying to think what I, well, my first system was really an Atari 2600, honestly.

03:30.960 --> 03:34.080
And I remember combat.

03:34.080 --> 03:37.000
And I remember Spider-Man and I think I've talked, you know, I've talked enough about

03:37.000 --> 03:40.360
Spider-Man on this show and in the past few episodes, I'm trying to remember what else

03:40.360 --> 03:41.360
I own.

03:41.360 --> 03:42.360
Oh, Superman.

03:42.360 --> 03:43.480
I guess I, I guess I was a superhero kid.

03:43.480 --> 03:44.760
I do remember having Superman.

03:44.760 --> 03:47.680
Did you ever play Superman on the Atari 2600?

03:47.680 --> 03:48.680
No.

03:48.680 --> 03:50.280
It was really weird.

03:50.280 --> 03:53.920
You flew through these different screens and there was this little bling bling bling little

03:53.920 --> 03:54.920
thing.

03:54.920 --> 03:56.760
I think it was like Krypton or something that would chase you.

03:56.760 --> 03:58.000
You were trying to get Lois Lane.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.120
It was, it played very strange.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.600
So that was an early game that I had.

04:02.600 --> 04:03.600
All right.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.600
What did you want to say, Loki?

04:04.600 --> 04:05.600
Adding to that?

04:05.600 --> 04:07.880
Oh, I was going to say, so my first three games that I got on the NES, cause we got

04:07.880 --> 04:14.320
it secondhand, I believe, um, was Bubble Bobble, The Legend of Zelda, cause that's one I really

04:14.320 --> 04:19.240
wanted and Breakthrough, um, kind of random.

04:19.240 --> 04:20.240
Yeah.

04:20.240 --> 04:21.240
Yeah.

04:21.240 --> 04:26.720
I'm pretty sure Zelda was like the first game outside of, um, Mario Brothers and, uh, Duck

04:26.720 --> 04:27.720
Hunt.

04:27.720 --> 04:31.720
I didn't have the power pad system, but I'm pretty sure Zelda was also bought around the

04:31.720 --> 04:36.700
same time because that was the game that like really probably got me like super into gaming

04:36.740 --> 04:39.380
and made me, made me more of a gamer, quite frankly.

04:39.380 --> 04:43.900
Um, let's see other comments in chat, uh, checking out what folks are saying.

04:43.900 --> 04:48.660
Pod culture says Atari, 2,600 combat, et and Pac-Man.

04:48.660 --> 04:52.060
Those are some must have games, even though two of them were kind of garbage.

04:52.060 --> 04:58.740
Uh, She-Hulk 10 says Colecovision and, and it scrolled off the screen, Donkey Kong Colecovision

04:58.740 --> 04:59.740
had some good stuff.

04:59.740 --> 05:02.820
Colecovision, uh, we never had one, but our friends had one.

05:02.820 --> 05:04.580
Um, let's see other stuff.

05:04.580 --> 05:06.460
Fifth dream says I played Superman a lot.

05:06.460 --> 05:07.460
Okay.

05:07.460 --> 05:08.460
Glad it wasn't just me.

05:08.460 --> 05:11.100
The break man says Atari, 2,600 Ghostbusters.

05:11.100 --> 05:16.380
Now that was one of the first games I remember picking up for the Commodore 64.

05:16.380 --> 05:20.900
Um, I remember going to a computer store and well, I didn't buy it.

05:20.900 --> 05:25.340
I was like six or seven, but I remember my, my dad buying it for me because you know,

05:25.340 --> 05:26.340
gimme, gimme, gimme.

05:26.340 --> 05:29.900
Well, that was also when they would, they would have the computers that would play games

05:29.900 --> 05:33.480
like, and they'd be on display and Ghostbusters was one of the games they were showing off,

05:33.480 --> 05:38.960
I guess not too far apart from how you'd have like an Xbox or a PlayStation kiosk set

05:38.960 --> 05:42.160
up in a Best Buy or a GameStop in these days.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.960
You kind of try before you buy.

05:43.960 --> 05:47.400
I remember that's how I discovered Sid Meier's civilization.

05:47.400 --> 05:50.200
I spent hours at a store.

05:50.200 --> 05:54.080
I don't know how they let me stay at that damn store hours playing Civ on a computer

05:54.080 --> 05:55.080
at the store.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.080
It was crazy.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.080
Um, yeah.

05:57.080 --> 06:01.200
So, um, yeah, I did have a Colecovision as well.

06:01.200 --> 06:05.280
I can't remember what the first few games were cause I think that was during the crash.

06:05.280 --> 06:11.760
Um, so my dad had like 50 games for, for system that he says he never like did gaming and

06:11.760 --> 06:12.760
stuff.

06:12.760 --> 06:13.760
Like he had 50 games for that.

06:13.760 --> 06:15.600
So I think he got them so dirt cheap.

06:15.600 --> 06:20.360
Um, but like I used to play a ton of, uh, the Smurfs, Jumpman Jr. and Bump and Jump

06:20.360 --> 06:21.360
on that.

06:21.360 --> 06:22.360
Okay.

06:22.360 --> 06:23.360
Good.

06:23.360 --> 06:26.040
I didn't know Jumpman Jr. was on Colecovision, but I guess that makes sense.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.040
Epic.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.520
Epic's put their games out a lot of places.

06:28.520 --> 06:29.520
Yeah.

06:29.520 --> 06:30.520
Cool.

06:30.840 --> 06:34.640
So from retro games to modern games, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic.

06:34.640 --> 06:39.240
Obviously there's a big, big story and everybody's got a hot take on this and this has to do

06:39.240 --> 06:47.980
with Microsoft and their acquisition of Bethesda and what, uh, ID software all under the parent

06:47.980 --> 06:48.980
company is ZeniMax.

06:48.980 --> 06:49.980
Right?

06:49.980 --> 06:50.980
Loki, tell us more.

06:50.980 --> 06:51.980
Yes.

06:51.980 --> 06:57.400
So yeah, I would have, uh, the crack of Dawn on, uh, September 21st, we've got the announcement

06:57.400 --> 07:04.280
that apparently, uh, ID software's parent company, um, ZeniMax or ZeniMax, which owns,

07:04.280 --> 07:09.040
you know, Bethesda ID software and a lot of other, um, subsidiaries as well.

07:09.040 --> 07:15.140
They were purchased for $7.5 billion by Microsoft, uh, which is incredible.

07:15.140 --> 07:22.320
So apparently, you know, that adds a whole ton of games to their roster as well.

07:22.320 --> 07:29.000
Um, it seems like that this has been purchased just for, well, to definitely help out with

07:29.000 --> 07:32.080
games pass and adding more titles to that.

07:32.080 --> 07:40.160
But I mean, as someone who's decided to purchase an X-Box this, this, uh, time around, it's

07:40.160 --> 07:41.760
just making my purchase even better.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.080
So I love it.

07:43.080 --> 07:47.580
Um, and as to why, uh, some, some folks may wonder why did I put on the sidebar Microsoft

07:47.580 --> 07:52.200
acquires Bethesda and I didn't put Microsoft acquire ZeniMax, um, well, Bethesda is a part

07:52.200 --> 07:57.900
of that, but also, and what I kind of relate this to every E3, we have the Bethesda press

07:57.900 --> 07:58.900
conference, right?

07:58.900 --> 08:02.880
We have the Bethesda event, Bethesda E3, well, Microsoft now owns everything that you've

08:02.880 --> 08:09.160
been shown in that particular, um, you know, real for the past couple of years.

08:09.160 --> 08:10.160
So yeah.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.160
Yeah.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.160
Kinda, um, kinda interesting.

08:12.160 --> 08:14.520
Um, is that all you wanted to say on it?

08:14.520 --> 08:16.360
No, no, not at all.

08:16.360 --> 08:21.320
So, so of course, you know, the obvious concern is, well, what's that going to do with these

08:21.320 --> 08:25.120
exclusive games that Sony has, you know, for Bethesda?

08:25.120 --> 08:30.360
Or does that mean that I can't get elder scrolls six on, you know, the PlayStation five?

08:30.360 --> 08:36.440
Well, apparently that's not necessarily going to be the case, um, that they are confirmed

08:36.440 --> 08:41.720
that they're right now going to hold their agreements, especially with, um, was a death

08:41.720 --> 08:42.720
loop.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.080
Now that's an exclusive game on PlayStation five.

08:45.080 --> 08:49.120
So they're going to actually keep that exclusive because that's the agreement that's already

08:49.120 --> 08:50.120
been made.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.120
Yeah.

08:51.120 --> 08:54.960
There's probably contracts and things because of how death loop has been highlighted in

08:54.960 --> 08:57.000
the PlayStation five showcase.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.640
That would be a lot of eggs on Sony's face.

08:59.640 --> 09:03.160
If that game suddenly went and became a Microsoft exclusive.

09:03.160 --> 09:09.200
So there's probably legal agreements, which it's probably just easier to go ahead and

09:09.200 --> 09:11.320
honor the, uh, agreement.

09:11.320 --> 09:12.320
Yeah.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.680
So they're going to keep their agreements.

09:13.680 --> 09:18.720
And then I believe with the right now, what they've been, the kind of stance has been

09:18.720 --> 09:20.800
is they're going to look at it as they go along.

09:20.800 --> 09:26.000
But I think that they're actually still considering doing these multi-platform, which makes sense

09:26.000 --> 09:29.240
because you have a lot of these Microsoft properties on other systems.

09:29.240 --> 09:34.520
Um, I mean, hell, we just had a new Ori game come to the switch this week.

09:34.520 --> 09:39.680
So in the outer worlds, the outer worlds is still multi-platform even after Microsoft

09:39.680 --> 09:40.680
bought obsidian.

09:40.680 --> 09:46.680
Um, but I, I think there's a lot to say though about Microsoft kind of resting on, well,

09:46.680 --> 09:50.280
not necessarily resting on, but investing, I think is a better word investing on the

09:50.280 --> 09:53.660
strength of literally cause they just spent billions of dollars to invest, but they're

09:53.660 --> 10:00.200
investing on the strength of game pass because sure elder scrolls six could go multi-platform.

10:00.200 --> 10:04.640
It could show up on the PlayStation five road will set you back $70 or you just get it with

10:04.640 --> 10:07.040
game pass for PC and Xbox.

10:07.040 --> 10:10.640
Which at this point, many gamers, yeah.

10:10.640 --> 10:15.720
And so I kind of feel like it doesn't matter at that point, if it's multi-platform, it's

10:15.760 --> 10:21.640
going to be such a stronger deal to pick it up on PC or Xbox, uh, that maybe Microsoft

10:21.640 --> 10:26.000
doesn't need to, I mean, Oh, well, it sells more on PlayStation five.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Great.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.240
That's more money for Microsoft who now owns the studio.

10:30.240 --> 10:38.960
So I'm not sure this whole era of console exclusives is what it used to be.

10:38.960 --> 10:40.720
I mean, for Sony, it still is.

10:40.720 --> 10:45.120
Uh, they're going to have God of war and all this stuff, but even, even things like

10:45.120 --> 10:50.800
horizon zero Dawn and some of the other strong Sony franchises you've started to see come

10:50.800 --> 10:52.640
to PC.

10:52.640 --> 10:55.160
And you know, there was a lot of gamers that were up in arms about it, even though it was

10:55.160 --> 10:59.480
like a year after the fact, but I think it just kind of goes to show that like maybe

10:59.480 --> 11:03.160
exclusives aren't everything it used to be.

11:03.160 --> 11:06.080
And I don't understand why people are up in arms about that kind of stuff.

11:06.080 --> 11:08.920
Like even like, I don't get it.

11:08.920 --> 11:12.320
Like why would you care if somebody else can play a game?

11:12.320 --> 11:15.960
Like that's such a stupid thing to be mad about that Twitter shit.

11:15.960 --> 11:16.960
Just ignore it.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.160
There's so much like God, people have a lot of free time.

11:19.160 --> 11:21.440
I mean, I understand there's a pandemic going on.

11:21.440 --> 11:25.760
A lot of people are still staying at home and all that, which is great, but I, you just,

11:25.760 --> 11:27.560
you just have to filter that garbage out.

11:27.560 --> 11:34.040
There's so much garbage on social media that, you know, just pay it no mind in you, you

11:34.040 --> 11:38.040
know, it gets 50 times as bad when it's political stuff and it's just filter, filter, filter,

11:38.040 --> 11:40.000
filter, you let the brain filter out.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Yeah.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.920
It's just like with all the people saying, well, there's better, better games on PlayStation

11:43.920 --> 11:44.920
five.

11:44.920 --> 11:45.920
And I mean, you know, Xbox sucks.

11:45.920 --> 11:46.920
I'm not going to get an Xbox.

11:46.920 --> 11:47.920
I'm like, cool.

11:47.920 --> 11:48.920
You can, you can do whatever you want.

11:48.920 --> 11:53.160
Like, I don't understand why people are like mad at other people for their purchasing decisions

11:53.160 --> 11:54.360
or decisions on stuff.

11:54.360 --> 11:55.880
It's like, who cares?

11:55.880 --> 11:56.880
It doesn't matter.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.640
It's not impacting you at all.

11:58.640 --> 12:00.760
Like it, it's just such a silly thing.

12:00.760 --> 12:02.800
Like I, I don't get it.

12:02.800 --> 12:07.880
Chewy 240 in chat says, anyone still doubting game pass needs to re-examine their gaming

12:07.880 --> 12:08.880
life.

12:08.880 --> 12:09.880
Well, let's talk about that.

12:09.880 --> 12:10.880
Hello.

12:10.880 --> 12:11.880
Let's talk about that.

12:11.880 --> 12:18.720
Um, obviously a big reason why Microsoft has done this is to really buffer up game pass.

12:18.720 --> 12:25.800
And this buffing up of game pass is starting now, like now, because we've already had the

12:25.800 --> 12:29.040
Xbox game pass account tweet out a leak.

12:29.040 --> 12:33.920
And I'm using my quotey fingers, a leak that long story short doom, eternal or doom.

12:33.920 --> 12:38.320
One of them, probably both are on their way to Xbox game pass very soon.

12:38.320 --> 12:42.000
Um, probably in the coming weeks, certainly before the end of the year.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.360
So this investment is already starting to pay off.

12:46.360 --> 12:50.360
And that's more than you can say for a lot of Microsoft's other investments.

12:50.360 --> 12:54.160
That's not to shade any of those studios, but when you get Bethesda and as some of you

12:54.160 --> 12:59.840
have noted in chat, Bethesda has a history that goes back to the fucking 19 or 19 eight.

12:59.840 --> 13:00.840
Yes.

13:00.840 --> 13:01.840
19.

13:01.840 --> 13:03.100
I can't get my words right tonight.

13:03.100 --> 13:04.100
The 1980s.

13:04.100 --> 13:05.100
Okay.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.380
I'm at my brain thought I said 1890s anyway.

13:07.380 --> 13:11.080
It goes all the way back to the 1980s with some of the old games that they did.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.080
Let's not forget.

13:12.080 --> 13:15.440
Microsoft has a PC game pass as well.

13:15.440 --> 13:19.720
Wouldn't it be pretty rad if like a lot of these old classics suddenly started showing

13:19.720 --> 13:21.400
up on PC game pass?

13:21.400 --> 13:26.000
I'm not saying they're going to, but if Microsoft wanted to go that route, they could.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.760
And that's just going to strengthen that as well.

13:27.760 --> 13:31.440
And then of course on the console front, now you have doom, doom and eternal.

13:31.440 --> 13:35.080
Obviously you're gonna have elder scrolls six and it doesn't matter if the game goes

13:35.080 --> 13:40.160
multi-platform because it's going to be part of game pass or you can pay $70 for it.

13:40.160 --> 13:48.760
If you really want, you know, on PlayStation five, um, with game pass, Microsoft has now,

13:48.760 --> 13:52.720
and I use this analogy on Bobby's show when I was doing the, the toss over and I'm going

13:52.720 --> 13:54.080
to say it again.

13:54.080 --> 13:59.540
It's like all these services and people trying to become the next game pass, right?

13:59.540 --> 14:01.000
We have Google stadia.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
We have a new one from Amazon.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.800
We're going to talk about it a little bit.

14:03.800 --> 14:07.540
We have, um, Nintendo switch online.

14:07.540 --> 14:13.480
We have, uh, PlayStation and now the PlayStation plus, uh, games and all that Microsoft was

14:13.480 --> 14:18.200
already out in front and now they have just pushed the nitro button and you remember that

14:18.200 --> 14:22.800
and Ivan man, iron Stewart, super off-road, you hit that nitro button, you go flying out

14:22.800 --> 14:23.800
in front.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.600
That's what this Bethesda purchase has done.

14:25.600 --> 14:29.600
They have nitro their way to the front with this game pass, which is where they truly

14:29.600 --> 14:37.560
see gaming going is where movies and TV have gone, which is streaming, which is Netflix.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.520
And how long did it take?

14:39.520 --> 14:45.100
Because Netflix was so far out front with their investments of creating original programming.

14:45.100 --> 14:49.840
So when it came the, uh, when it came to who's going to get the stranger things that

14:49.840 --> 14:54.220
really kind of threw them out in first place and you know, all the Netflix originals that

14:54.220 --> 14:59.340
have made them who they are, it has taken forever for other companies to catch up and

14:59.340 --> 15:01.260
become part of the conversation.

15:01.260 --> 15:03.100
Hulu is kind of getting there.

15:03.100 --> 15:06.780
CBS all access is struggling.

15:06.780 --> 15:12.780
CBS is been out there at CBS is one of the big three networks and they're having a hard

15:12.780 --> 15:14.580
time catching on with streaming.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.540
They're having to rebrand the paramount network.

15:16.540 --> 15:23.460
They're having to bring in the forces from VH1 and MTV and in order to take on, uh, Netflix,

15:23.460 --> 15:29.620
the only company that was able to nitro themselves to a level where Netflix is at pretty quickly

15:29.620 --> 15:32.500
is Disney, Disney plus.

15:32.500 --> 15:39.880
And the analogy here would be if Nintendo really wanted to, they could create something

15:39.880 --> 15:43.660
stronger than game pass tomorrow.

15:43.660 --> 15:44.660
Well, don't worry.

15:44.660 --> 15:47.620
Just, they're not, we all know they're not, they're running a Nintendo time.

15:47.620 --> 15:50.620
So right now we're, we're talking early two thousands of Nintendo.

15:50.620 --> 15:51.620
Don't worry.

15:51.620 --> 15:53.880
In 10 years, they'll have something that's similar to Netflix.

15:53.880 --> 15:57.100
And then they'll, you know, everyone will talk how innovative it is.

15:57.100 --> 15:58.100
They're just behind.

15:58.100 --> 16:02.340
Nintendo plus will be out in 2030 it's, it's going to be some time.

16:02.340 --> 16:06.300
I mean, I props to them if they figured this out early and I'm sorry.

16:06.300 --> 16:11.100
The NES online and the SNES online don't count.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.460
Y'all know it don't count.

16:12.820 --> 16:14.500
It's, it's beans.

16:14.500 --> 16:20.300
It's it's fucking free Pluto TV compared to, actually, I kind of like Pluto TV.

16:20.300 --> 16:23.740
I shouldn't shade it, but it compared to Netflix, it's like a non-issue.

16:23.740 --> 16:24.740
Okay.

16:24.740 --> 16:25.740
Crackle.

16:25.740 --> 16:26.740
It's yes.

16:26.740 --> 16:27.740
Crackle.

16:27.740 --> 16:38.220
Or like, or is it like my TV or I've got the Roku channel, which is just like the garbage,

16:38.220 --> 16:39.460
like old shows.

16:39.460 --> 16:41.300
Like I didn't even realize that this was syndicated.

16:41.300 --> 16:46.180
It's the weather app that just plays the same forecast on loop for your area 24 hours

16:46.180 --> 16:47.180
a day.

16:47.180 --> 16:50.860
It's that, that actually exists on PlayStation four, by the way, there's like a weather app

16:50.860 --> 16:51.860
anyway.

16:51.860 --> 16:56.660
Um, I think like the Roku app, it's like, it's got like reruns of wings and that's about

16:56.660 --> 16:57.660
it on there.

16:57.660 --> 16:59.740
It's just like random stuff.

16:59.740 --> 17:00.740
All right.

17:00.740 --> 17:05.180
So my point is, and that whole chat comment I was responding to originally and talking

17:05.180 --> 17:09.540
about, let's talk about game pass is that with this, Microsoft has propelled themselves

17:09.540 --> 17:14.220
to the front that like everybody else is now going to be struggling to catch up.

17:14.220 --> 17:18.660
And you see Sony kind of starting to move pieces in that direction.

17:18.660 --> 17:21.300
It is too late.

17:21.300 --> 17:24.500
They had now see Sony moving anything in that direction.

17:24.500 --> 17:28.700
They have a lot of ground to make up and you know, Sony is going to kind of hope they can

17:28.700 --> 17:29.700
still ride on.

17:29.700 --> 17:34.980
And I'm not, I'm not, please don't miss hear me when I talk these critical things about

17:34.980 --> 17:38.700
Sony and this is just the culture we're in now is that everything is so polarized.

17:38.700 --> 17:41.500
And if I'm sitting here being critical of Sony, I must hate them.

17:41.500 --> 17:42.500
I don't.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.900
I've said it until I'm blue in the face every week on the show.

17:44.900 --> 17:45.900
Cool.

17:45.900 --> 17:46.900
We have Microsoft.

17:46.900 --> 17:47.900
Yes.

17:47.900 --> 17:48.900
Like not even that.

17:48.900 --> 17:49.900
Yeah.

17:49.900 --> 17:50.900
Yeah.

17:50.900 --> 17:51.900
Go back and listen.

17:51.900 --> 17:52.900
Yes.

17:52.900 --> 17:55.100
We, we've raked Microsoft over the coals and then some, okay.

17:55.100 --> 17:58.060
The thing is we're, we're rooting for everybody.

17:58.060 --> 17:59.060
Okay.

17:59.060 --> 18:04.500
But the reality is in this department where we all see gaming is going, Sony has some

18:04.500 --> 18:06.300
major catching up to do.

18:06.300 --> 18:10.580
And what they showed with the PlayStation plus with free games, isn't quite it.

18:10.580 --> 18:14.220
It is, it is movement in the right direction.

18:14.220 --> 18:16.720
That's coming years too late.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.900
So they have a lot of ground to make up now.

18:18.900 --> 18:23.260
Sony could sign some deals and really make some ground up tomorrow.

18:23.260 --> 18:25.420
Sony isn't charging an extra fee.

18:25.420 --> 18:30.540
They're bundling in and PlayStation plus that is, you know, to be noted, but it just, you

18:30.540 --> 18:34.660
know, you can feel how far behind they are now.

18:34.660 --> 18:39.780
And if they don't start to make moves, bigger moves to catch up, Microsoft's really going

18:39.780 --> 18:41.320
to run away with this.

18:41.320 --> 18:44.880
I mean, honestly, if you want to say, you know, all their free games that they're offering

18:44.880 --> 18:48.860
for the PlayStation five, really just kind of catching up to what Microsoft's been doing

18:48.860 --> 18:53.140
because Microsoft's been putting out four games a month that you get with your monthly

18:53.140 --> 18:55.660
subscription, whereas Sony's had two.

18:55.660 --> 19:01.760
So they're already kind of behind with that plus games fast food for thought again, something

19:01.760 --> 19:04.220
Sony could do tomorrow barring legal agreements.

19:04.220 --> 19:07.500
And I know legal agreements take time.

19:07.500 --> 19:10.580
Sony could just merge PlayStation plus and PlayStation.

19:10.580 --> 19:15.900
Now I realize they may not be able to carry all the same games, but maybe PlayStation

19:15.900 --> 19:22.740
now would allow them to open up three to one and hundreds of games from Playstations past.

19:22.740 --> 19:26.540
And Sony could make that happen pretty quickly.

19:26.540 --> 19:27.540
Will they?

19:27.540 --> 19:28.540
I don't know.

19:28.540 --> 19:31.300
No, I don't think they're never going to do that anyway.

19:31.300 --> 19:33.420
They like their money too much.

19:33.420 --> 19:34.420
Some other comments.

19:34.420 --> 19:35.420
Yeah.

19:35.420 --> 19:40.300
And Paley Hanumayo says, quite frankly, they'll still outsell Xbox this next gen.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.140
That is not incorrect.

19:42.140 --> 19:43.360
I actually agree with you.

19:43.360 --> 19:50.460
The PlayStation five as hardware will outsell Xbox, however.

19:50.460 --> 19:55.820
Here's the real question to ask at the end of this generation.

19:55.820 --> 20:03.360
Who will have more monthly subscribers, PlayStation plus or Xbox Game Pass?

20:03.360 --> 20:06.640
And hardware doesn't matter anyways, because when you think about it, they're making a

20:06.640 --> 20:09.920
it's a loss for any hardware sold anyways.

20:09.920 --> 20:14.680
And right now, people are just speculating based on how quickly pre-sales are.

20:14.680 --> 20:18.640
And we don't even know because we don't know the actual numbers that are being sold.

20:18.640 --> 20:23.680
And with these game streaming services, games pass is on PC.

20:23.680 --> 20:27.240
It's also on mobile devices and PlayStation now.

20:27.240 --> 20:33.120
I think people fighting the old school console war on Twitter with Sony versus Microsoft

20:33.160 --> 20:35.400
and Nintendo is kind of out there doing their own thing.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.720
I think they're gauging the wrong battle.

20:37.720 --> 20:42.480
I think if you're in Phil Spencer's shoes, the battle you're looking at is what I just

20:42.480 --> 20:43.480
mentioned.

20:43.480 --> 20:48.240
They want to at the end of this generation have way more Xbox Game Pass subscribers than

20:48.240 --> 20:53.480
there are PlayStation plus subscribers or Nintendo online monthly subscribers.

20:53.480 --> 20:57.000
That is the battle Microsoft is going to fight.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.080
The Nintendo online one.

21:00.080 --> 21:02.200
I wouldn't even try to compare with them.

21:02.200 --> 21:04.720
It's just like it's not even the same type of thing.

21:04.720 --> 21:06.800
And it's not even the same amount of money that they're making.

21:06.800 --> 21:07.800
I know.

21:07.800 --> 21:08.800
But I had to include it.

21:08.800 --> 21:15.040
I'm chewy, too, because because again, tomorrow, Nintendo could change this conversation, right?

21:15.040 --> 21:16.960
I know we're all sitting here cynical.

21:16.960 --> 21:18.520
They're not going to.

21:18.520 --> 21:19.960
I accept that.

21:19.960 --> 21:21.400
And I agree with it.

21:21.400 --> 21:26.560
But let's also agree with the fact that if they wanted to tomorrow, Nintendo could change

21:26.560 --> 21:28.360
this conversation.

21:28.360 --> 21:31.680
No, they can't, actually.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.520
No, they won't.

21:33.520 --> 21:34.520
And they can't.

21:34.520 --> 21:35.920
I'm going to go on the record.

21:35.920 --> 21:36.920
They can't.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.320
They cannot change this conversation in one day.

21:39.320 --> 21:42.600
There is no announcement that they can make that would change this conversation.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.600
All right.

21:44.600 --> 21:45.600
Let's see.

21:45.600 --> 21:47.600
Other comments in chat here.

21:47.600 --> 21:50.280
Quest Buster says they're pushing the brand as a whole.

21:50.280 --> 21:53.840
If the console doesn't beat the PlayStation 5 in sales, it's probably not as important

21:53.840 --> 21:59.880
as expanding their ecology on everything else, not Sony or Nintendo.

21:59.880 --> 22:03.800
And the break man says they're trying to expand Xbox as a platform far more reaching

22:03.800 --> 22:05.240
than just a console.

22:05.240 --> 22:10.320
Chewy 240 in chat says reoccurring revenue cash is king.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.720
Correct.

22:11.720 --> 22:19.520
What game saved an entire franchise and Square Enix from the brink of doom?

22:19.520 --> 22:21.120
Final Fantasy 14.

22:21.120 --> 22:22.780
Look it up.

22:22.780 --> 22:25.040
That's why that game had to be fixed.

22:25.040 --> 22:26.040
And it was fixed.

22:26.040 --> 22:28.120
And it was fixed very well.

22:28.120 --> 22:33.200
And what does Square Enix now thank for a lot of its revenue when Final Fantasy, you

22:33.200 --> 22:37.560
know, some of the other titles weren't necessarily when Tomb Raider didn't sell as much as they

22:37.560 --> 22:40.560
thought it would, which is ridiculous.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.560
But you know what?

22:41.560 --> 22:43.080
You all saw that headline, too, right?

22:43.080 --> 22:44.880
But what game did they credit?

22:44.880 --> 22:46.320
Mm hmm.

22:46.320 --> 22:47.320
Anyway.

22:47.320 --> 22:51.240
See it to be in chat says, I wonder if part of Nintendo being slow to roll some of that

22:51.240 --> 22:55.560
stuff out is also because of related licenses potentially.

22:55.800 --> 23:01.920
There is such a strong first party library, although most of what you see in the NES and

23:01.920 --> 23:05.920
the SNES classics now is Nintendo's first party library.

23:05.920 --> 23:10.480
To be honest, there aren't a lot of first party games left that aren't already on the

23:10.480 --> 23:11.480
service.

23:11.480 --> 23:15.080
There may be some tricky licensing things, but for the most part, all the first party

23:15.080 --> 23:19.360
games that you would expect to see are out there.

23:19.360 --> 23:23.720
Now they honestly don't think the licensing would be that expensive on those games.

23:23.720 --> 23:28.760
To be honest, especially like, I'm sure they can because look at look at what the Wii

23:28.760 --> 23:29.760
was.

23:29.760 --> 23:30.760
You remember the Wii?

23:30.760 --> 23:33.000
Well, you know, in the virtual console, how many games are on there?

23:33.000 --> 23:36.800
And since and since you brought it up, like that's kind of where I was going with it,

23:36.800 --> 23:43.360
is that but they still have yet to even tap into Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo

23:43.360 --> 23:51.480
64, GameCube, Wii, Wii U, they there's all these things they haven't tapped into yet.

23:51.480 --> 23:53.560
So I don't know.

23:53.560 --> 23:58.400
Did you see that crazy rumor that at the next Nintendo Direct they're going to flack out

23:58.400 --> 23:59.840
a Game Boy player?

23:59.840 --> 24:03.640
I just it's I don't I don't buy it at all.

24:03.640 --> 24:07.120
I don't buy it wouldn't be surprised, but like.

24:07.120 --> 24:09.200
Once again, that's just like kind of trickling stuff.

24:09.200 --> 24:13.160
It's just it's giving you enough just to like, OK, cool, I can justify the money that I'm

24:13.160 --> 24:18.200
paying for this online thing, but like it's not really doing anything, it's just kind

24:18.200 --> 24:22.040
of just the bare minimum.

24:22.040 --> 24:23.520
I guess I don't know.

24:23.520 --> 24:25.760
Should I say something that's going to get me in trouble?

24:25.760 --> 24:26.760
All right.

24:26.760 --> 24:28.720
Of course, always.

24:28.720 --> 24:31.360
It's not worth it for Nintendo to put out the Game Boy player.

24:31.360 --> 24:36.480
Those games don't hold up well at all, save for like Tetris, which wouldn't even be a

24:36.480 --> 24:39.960
part of it anyway, because there's Tetris 99 and there's agreements with the Tetris

24:39.960 --> 24:40.960
company.

24:40.960 --> 24:44.840
I'm not saying the Game Boy wasn't important for its time and all that, but a lot of those

24:44.840 --> 24:48.980
Game Boy games, y'all, they do not hold up well at all.

24:48.980 --> 24:52.320
It would be way smarter for them to go to the Game Boy Advance.

24:52.320 --> 24:55.840
Those games hold up a lot better because a lot of them are on the same level with things

24:55.840 --> 24:58.040
like Super Nintendo and beyond.

24:58.040 --> 25:03.800
So sorry if you don't agree with what I said, but that's like the tea as I see it.

25:03.800 --> 25:08.320
Those Game Boy games do not hold up well at all, like they're not going to be fun to play.

25:08.320 --> 25:12.400
You'll play them for like 15 seconds and just be like, oh, yeah, I loved this when I was

25:12.400 --> 25:13.400
a kid.

25:13.840 --> 25:14.840
All right.

25:15.960 --> 25:20.920
So anyway, Bobby Black, I'm just going to go straight to the virtual boy.

25:20.920 --> 25:24.280
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Pokemon Red Blue, not worth it.

25:24.280 --> 25:29.040
Dead game, which is why they remade it twice.

25:29.040 --> 25:31.440
And so it's not going to be a part of that collection.

25:31.440 --> 25:34.880
Pokemon wouldn't be in there because and it was specifically red and blue.

25:34.880 --> 25:38.860
They just remade it not that long ago as Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee.

25:38.860 --> 25:41.480
So they're not going to put those games in there.

25:41.480 --> 25:45.640
So anyway, now Orangewrite says maybe have them all.

25:45.640 --> 25:48.400
OK, that I could go a little more for.

25:48.400 --> 25:54.440
So I'm not saying there's like, oh, my gosh, there are zero games I would ever play, but

25:54.440 --> 25:58.320
it's just like I just think a lot of those games, it's not going to carry the weight

25:58.320 --> 25:59.720
that y'all think it would.

25:59.720 --> 26:03.400
Anyway, we're getting really distant from the original topic, which was Microsoft acquiring

26:03.400 --> 26:04.400
Bethesda.

26:04.400 --> 26:08.440
Any other bullet points on that story you wanted to get out, Loki?

26:09.440 --> 26:17.000
No, that was pretty much it is just they they own Bethesda now and, you know, now maybe

26:17.000 --> 26:22.600
we will get an actual Fallout New Vegas sequel because now we have Obsidian and we have Bethesda.

26:22.600 --> 26:24.800
So technically they can make it happen.

26:24.800 --> 26:27.840
That's what a lot of people are saying.

26:27.840 --> 26:29.240
That's cool if that happens.

26:29.240 --> 26:35.300
But you know, that's kind of one of those like, you know, one phase of enlightenment.

26:35.300 --> 26:39.140
But the biggest phase of enlightenment is why don't they work together on a new game?

26:39.140 --> 26:40.580
That would be something really, really cool.

26:40.580 --> 26:44.300
Like have them work together on a new franchise, although it wouldn't happen tomorrow.

26:44.300 --> 26:45.300
So.

26:45.300 --> 26:46.300
All right.

26:46.300 --> 26:51.360
Anyway, I think this is going to be pretty exciting for the future for Microsoft as far

26:51.360 --> 26:56.660
as like Elder Scrolls six and that coming to Sony.

26:56.660 --> 26:59.860
I don't know, like I wanted to be really cynical and come on the show and say it's not going

26:59.860 --> 27:04.420
to happen and they're just talking that way to reduce some of the negativity.

27:04.420 --> 27:09.360
But I really do think it's different now and Microsoft is fighting a different fight.

27:09.360 --> 27:14.120
And so they might just go ahead and still release Elder Scrolls six on PlayStation and

27:14.120 --> 27:19.440
kind of like I said, it's going to be 70 bucks there or free on Game Pass, free on Game Pass

27:19.440 --> 27:21.720
with your subscription.

27:21.720 --> 27:24.300
And that's the battle Microsoft's going to fight.

27:24.300 --> 27:25.300
We'll see.

27:25.300 --> 27:28.980
But there's nothing to say that they couldn't do like a timed exclusive.

27:28.980 --> 27:30.880
Oh, they could do a timed exclusive.

27:30.880 --> 27:37.940
They could do that there's a whole new expansion or part of it that is only on Microsoft.

27:37.940 --> 27:40.460
There's there's a lot of things they could do with it.

27:40.460 --> 27:43.760
Spider-Man is only available in Elder Scrolls six on Xbox.

27:43.760 --> 27:50.360
That'll show him Questbuster in chat says Obsidian might actually be happy doing their

27:50.360 --> 27:53.920
own thing now with outer worlds and the world they created with pillars.

27:53.920 --> 27:57.160
I'm sure they still have the Fallout universe in their heart, but they've probably moved

27:57.160 --> 27:58.160
on.

27:58.160 --> 27:59.160
Yeah.

27:59.440 --> 28:01.280
They'll probably just move on to something new.

28:01.280 --> 28:05.200
But maybe there could be like a remastering or something, something that would take less

28:05.200 --> 28:09.720
resources than a whole new game, but like a remastering of New Vegas or revisiting that

28:09.720 --> 28:10.720
somehow that I say.

28:10.720 --> 28:13.800
I would love more than the remaster of Oblivion or New Vegas.

28:13.800 --> 28:15.400
That would be cool.

28:15.400 --> 28:16.400
Do you?

28:16.400 --> 28:17.400
OK.

28:17.400 --> 28:23.160
Do you think there's going to be the Skyrim one more time edition on PlayStation five

28:23.160 --> 28:25.200
and Xbox Series X?

28:25.200 --> 28:27.920
Will there be a Skyrim one more time?

28:27.920 --> 28:36.320
One more for the road encore edition for the.

28:36.320 --> 28:39.480
I could see that, but I feel like it's got to happen.

28:39.480 --> 28:42.840
Like if they don't put Skyrim on Xbox one X.

28:42.840 --> 28:44.880
I've already done like the enhanced edition.

28:44.880 --> 28:48.800
I don't know if they're going to necessarily do that again.

28:48.800 --> 28:51.360
It would be funny, but like, I don't know if it would do that.

28:51.360 --> 28:55.600
I don't think unless they can justify getting the return on it.

28:55.600 --> 29:00.240
I mean, they already have like the special edition as it is, and I don't know what new

29:00.240 --> 29:05.680
the Xbox Series X will necessarily do with the special edition, like how that will upscale

29:05.680 --> 29:06.680
stuff on that.

29:06.680 --> 29:11.760
So I mean, that sort of could be like releasing it again.

29:11.760 --> 29:13.440
I don't think they will.

29:13.440 --> 29:16.080
Tiger Claw on chat says Skyrim remastered in 4K HDR.

29:16.080 --> 29:19.820
Well, you know, it may just end up being one of the things where it's like enhanced backwards

29:19.820 --> 29:22.400
compatibility on Xbox Series X.

29:22.400 --> 29:23.400
Yeah.

29:23.400 --> 29:24.900
And yeah, it already does.

29:24.900 --> 29:31.100
And so maybe it's going to have further enhanced capability on Xbox Series X and they'll just

29:31.100 --> 29:35.500
say to Sony, well, you don't really care about backwards compatibility on PlayStation.

29:35.500 --> 29:37.580
So we're not going to enhance it for that.

29:37.580 --> 29:38.580
Yeah.

29:38.580 --> 29:44.020
I'm pretty sure that the PlayStation 4 and I want to say the PlayStation.

29:44.020 --> 29:47.420
Oh, yeah, they've already enhanced Skyrim once.

29:47.420 --> 29:48.740
Yeah, they've already enhanced it once.

29:48.740 --> 29:52.060
I'm pretty sure it supports 4K and whatnot.

29:52.060 --> 29:53.060
HDR.

29:53.060 --> 29:54.060
Probably.

29:54.220 --> 29:57.140
I don't know what the PC version does with the old engine, though, they're like, it just

29:57.140 --> 30:00.140
doesn't look super great.

30:00.140 --> 30:02.220
So like, I wouldn't even rebuild the whole thing.

30:02.220 --> 30:03.980
You want to play it one more time.

30:03.980 --> 30:05.100
One more time.

30:05.100 --> 30:06.100
One more turn.

30:06.100 --> 30:07.100
One more turn.

30:07.100 --> 30:16.380
And I've got it on PC or my Xbox 360 and PlayStation 4.

30:16.380 --> 30:19.580
Let's move on with the show and talk about the things we have been playing this week.

30:19.580 --> 30:23.140
If it was Skyrim or what during how was your gaming week?

30:23.140 --> 30:27.140
Again, Dark Sakura not here tonight because of the Jewish holiday, but we will see her

30:27.140 --> 30:31.780
again next week and get caught up on everything that she has been playing throughout the week.

30:31.780 --> 30:34.380
So Loki, how was your gaming week?

30:34.380 --> 30:37.900
I picked up a breakpoint that we talked about last week.

30:37.900 --> 30:42.460
The game looks kind of like Geometry Wars.

30:42.460 --> 30:43.460
Oh, right.

30:43.460 --> 30:44.460
That came out.

30:44.460 --> 30:45.940
I need to pick that up, too.

30:45.940 --> 30:46.940
Yeah.

30:46.940 --> 30:47.940
Yeah.

30:47.940 --> 30:48.940
So that's pretty cool.

30:48.940 --> 30:50.940
It's very hard.

30:50.940 --> 30:56.020
It's kind of you have to keep on your toes because your weapons keep breaking as you're

30:56.020 --> 30:57.980
fighting through there.

30:57.980 --> 31:01.060
So you have like all these different melee weapons that you get.

31:01.060 --> 31:05.900
And of course, it's very similar gameplay and the aesthetic is very similar to Geometry

31:05.900 --> 31:08.060
Wars, but pretty fun.

31:08.060 --> 31:09.740
So I did play that a little bit.

31:09.740 --> 31:14.100
I played a little bit of hot shot racing again, so that was pretty cool.

31:14.100 --> 31:15.660
I'm really enjoying that game.

31:15.660 --> 31:25.180
I actually went back and played some more Minecraft and a little frustrated with Microsoft

31:25.180 --> 31:28.660
right now because I have a realm that I pay for.

31:28.660 --> 31:33.060
And so I prepaid for that and then they want to be the pay again for my realm.

31:33.060 --> 31:38.620
So it ended up charging me like three times for my realm subscription.

31:38.620 --> 31:42.260
So obviously the Windows Store has some issues when it comes to that.

31:42.260 --> 31:47.180
So I have to get a refund for those or something.

31:47.180 --> 31:48.180
It's like seven bucks.

31:48.180 --> 31:49.180
That's annoying.

31:49.180 --> 31:50.180
So annoying.

31:50.180 --> 31:51.180
Yeah.

31:51.180 --> 31:57.500
And then I played a little bit of, well, actually quite a bit of Orna this week.

31:57.500 --> 31:58.500
So I've been doing that.

31:58.500 --> 32:00.300
I finally leveled up to 181.

32:00.300 --> 32:03.440
I'm still kind of way behind because I don't play very often anymore.

32:03.440 --> 32:09.860
And then I checked out Pokemon Go a little bit and played very little of that.

32:09.860 --> 32:12.180
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

32:12.180 --> 32:17.820
I think I've been slacking on the Orna front myself and I really got to like all these

32:17.820 --> 32:22.780
randos started joining our thing and I think it's because, well, I think we've been leveling

32:22.780 --> 32:26.840
up because as a, I want to say free company and it's not what it is, it's a guild or whatever

32:26.840 --> 32:27.840
it is in that game.

32:27.840 --> 32:28.840
I think we've been leveling up.

32:28.840 --> 32:34.120
I think we're showing up now in like those first two pages of like open kingdoms because

32:34.120 --> 32:37.060
we've been leveling up so much and that's why we're getting all these randos that are

32:37.060 --> 32:38.060
joining us.

32:38.060 --> 32:40.360
I just thought there was a lot of people that he didn't know, I'm like, who are all these

32:40.360 --> 32:41.360
people?

32:41.400 --> 32:44.280
And those, so I don't know what to do about all that.

32:44.280 --> 32:47.900
As long as they're nice, like whatever, I guess it's the most important thing.

32:47.900 --> 32:50.680
Just don't be a dick and you know, we'll have fun getting to know new people.

32:50.680 --> 32:52.800
But yeah, I've been slacking off on Orna.

32:52.800 --> 32:56.180
I probably have been playing more ingress than any of the other location based games

32:56.180 --> 33:00.840
this week just because with all the quarantine and everything, and especially like the heat

33:00.840 --> 33:04.460
and the smoke here in California the past couple of weeks, I have not been going outside

33:04.460 --> 33:08.360
as much and the COVID 19 pounds is really starting to show.

33:08.360 --> 33:11.400
So I'm trying to get walking and doing that stuff more.

33:11.400 --> 33:13.320
So Ingress is a good motivator for that.

33:13.320 --> 33:19.780
I did a mission banner yesterday at a giant park in the south area of Sacramento and it

33:19.780 --> 33:23.740
probably took me like two hours of solid walking.

33:23.740 --> 33:27.080
I'd stopped and did the portal scanning here and there too, but you know, that was a lot

33:27.080 --> 33:28.080
of exercise.

33:28.080 --> 33:32.760
So I'm just trying to do that, you know, let that game motivate the exercise because that's

33:32.760 --> 33:34.660
when it's its best really.

33:34.660 --> 33:39.540
As far as other games, I've been playing Final Fantasy 14 because I'm always playing that

33:39.540 --> 33:43.720
still working on my crafters and my paladin leveling that up.

33:43.720 --> 33:47.400
But then I've also been spending a little bit of time, quite a bit of time actually

33:47.400 --> 33:48.840
on two other games.

33:48.840 --> 33:56.000
I've been playing a lot of No Man's Sky again, thanks to the recent 3.0 patch, which we're

33:56.000 --> 33:57.440
going to talk about later in the show.

33:57.440 --> 34:00.240
So I'll save most of my thoughts for them.

34:00.240 --> 34:03.780
But because of that patch, I was like, you know what, what the hell?

34:03.780 --> 34:04.900
Let's do it again.

34:04.900 --> 34:07.700
Let's start a universe from scratch and see what happens.

34:07.700 --> 34:12.120
And I was just really happy with the universe I rolled into and on the planet where I established

34:12.120 --> 34:13.460
my base and stuff.

34:13.460 --> 34:18.920
I am now like further along and I'm now into 10 plus hours, which is probably more than

34:18.920 --> 34:21.640
I've spent on any other playthrough in that game so far.

34:21.640 --> 34:25.160
And I just, I am really, really loving that game right now.

34:25.160 --> 34:28.920
I'm going to talk a little more later in the show about the patch and some of the things

34:28.920 --> 34:35.160
that it changed and some of the old games that I revisited to check out some changes.

34:35.160 --> 34:38.100
So I'll show you that later in the show.

34:38.100 --> 34:39.680
Let's see other games I've been playing.

34:39.680 --> 34:43.720
One other game I've been playing a lot of this week, Hades.

34:43.720 --> 34:47.860
So I bought that on Steam a couple weeks ago.

34:47.860 --> 34:49.940
And this week I said, what the hell?

34:49.940 --> 34:53.280
And I double dipped and I bought it on Switch as well.

34:53.280 --> 34:57.640
And I've spent several hours on that game.

34:57.640 --> 34:59.120
That is fun.

34:59.120 --> 35:03.600
Like it's, you know, for the roguelikes and for what it is, it has a very kind of like

35:03.600 --> 35:06.560
Diablo-esque feel to it, but it isn't Diablo.

35:06.560 --> 35:08.800
Like it isn't that kind of game at all.

35:08.800 --> 35:11.880
It's kind of more like a rogue-like, it just kind of, I don't know, plays a little bit

35:11.880 --> 35:16.400
like Diablo, but it is very satisfying going through all those different dungeons and the

35:16.400 --> 35:20.960
way they've kind of told the story and have all the different characters that they do

35:20.960 --> 35:23.480
in a game like that is pretty neat.

35:23.480 --> 35:25.720
And the voice acting is very well done.

35:25.720 --> 35:29.680
So yeah, I've been really enjoying Hades.

35:29.680 --> 35:36.360
It's weird to have to fight that first boss over and over and over again as you kind of

35:36.360 --> 35:37.880
keep getting further and further.

35:37.880 --> 35:42.840
But you do feel yourself progressing and that fight feels like it gets easier and easier.

35:42.840 --> 35:45.160
And then you kind of learn how to do it with other weapons and stuff.

35:45.160 --> 35:49.440
So yeah, I'm loving Hades.

35:49.440 --> 35:50.440
It's a really good game.

35:50.440 --> 35:53.200
Probably one of the best games of the year, honestly.

35:53.200 --> 35:57.180
Siya Tabiri in chat says, another streamer I follow on here is thirsty for every character

35:57.180 --> 35:58.680
in Hades.

35:58.680 --> 35:59.680
Don't blame them.

35:59.680 --> 36:01.360
The character design is really well done.

36:01.360 --> 36:04.120
You really only see like the one picture of most of them.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.160
Well, they have different poses and things like that.

36:06.160 --> 36:10.400
So it's interesting because they don't like move and are fully animated like you see in

36:10.400 --> 36:12.520
a lot of games today, but it works.

36:12.520 --> 36:14.160
I'm not saying you have to have that.

36:14.160 --> 36:16.540
I just said the game is one of the best of the year.

36:16.540 --> 36:24.580
It's just interesting how it is limited, but it still manages to tell the story and contribute

36:24.580 --> 36:27.460
to a great game experience the way that it does.

36:27.460 --> 36:29.900
Quest Buster says, I'm really tempted to get Hades.

36:29.900 --> 36:32.860
At Dev says, I kind of want to try Hades too.

36:32.860 --> 36:34.220
I'm going to endorse it.

36:34.220 --> 36:39.420
I will try to do a stream of it later on, or maybe like a recorded YouTube or something.

36:39.420 --> 36:44.020
I have another idea stewing in my head for more video on demand stuff, but I will try

36:44.020 --> 36:48.220
to do some more narrated gameplay of that and why I'm into that game a little later

36:48.220 --> 36:49.220
on.

36:49.220 --> 36:50.220
But I am super into Hades.

36:50.220 --> 36:51.220
Good game.

36:51.220 --> 36:54.360
So that was pretty much my gaming week.

36:54.360 --> 36:56.380
Some quick housekeeping.

36:56.380 --> 36:58.900
There may not be a show in two weeks.

36:58.900 --> 37:01.660
I will confirm next week.

37:01.660 --> 37:05.440
It's very possible I'm going to be going on a little trip.

37:05.440 --> 37:08.940
And yes, I realize everything that's going on in the world and all of those precautions

37:08.940 --> 37:09.940
and things are going into it.

37:09.940 --> 37:10.940
It's not flying.

37:10.940 --> 37:11.940
It's driving.

37:11.940 --> 37:12.940
Are going into that.

37:13.100 --> 37:17.180
I may not be back in time for a show in two weeks, considering I haven't gone anywhere

37:17.180 --> 37:18.180
in about six months.

37:18.180 --> 37:23.940
I'm going to take a night off, but I will confirm that next week because I may actually

37:23.940 --> 37:24.940
be back in time.

37:24.940 --> 37:26.560
Still working out some of the details.

37:26.560 --> 37:30.060
So yeah, that's that.

37:30.060 --> 37:35.500
Also over at the voice geeks network, vog network.com, just a couple weeks ago, we launched

37:35.500 --> 37:39.900
the vog roundtables where we get some different people together to discuss a current topic

37:39.900 --> 37:41.260
going on in geek culture.

37:41.260 --> 37:44.820
And this week, this was a good one because it wasn't gaming.

37:44.820 --> 37:48.400
I want to make sure we're doing some like, obviously, I'm going to make a lot of gaming

37:48.400 --> 37:50.020
content because it's my wheelhouse.

37:50.020 --> 37:52.980
But once in a while, I'm going to challenge myself to do something outside of that too.

37:52.980 --> 37:56.500
So this week, we did a panel on cosplay in the COVID era.

37:56.500 --> 38:00.140
And we kind of talked about how cosplayers are passing the time when there's really no

38:00.140 --> 38:01.980
in person conventions right now.

38:01.980 --> 38:06.120
And there's some pretty neat ideas like we heard about.

38:06.120 --> 38:11.020
We had Aria snark or Victoria formerly of shaking and crying here at the voice geeks

38:11.020 --> 38:12.600
network was a part of the panel.

38:12.600 --> 38:16.680
And she talked about how she was doing like a virtual Disneyland birthday party dressed

38:16.680 --> 38:17.680
up in cosplay.

38:17.680 --> 38:18.680
So this is a really neat story.

38:18.680 --> 38:19.680
So check that out.

38:19.680 --> 38:22.640
The vog roundtable over at vog network.com.

38:22.640 --> 38:26.960
Big ups to anime jam session who showed up and participated with that as well.

38:26.960 --> 38:30.240
Rama and Ichigo, who is a frequent guest on that show.

38:30.240 --> 38:35.120
So all right, let's move on though to talking about the news.

38:35.120 --> 38:37.240
So Loki, what's going on in the news?

38:37.240 --> 38:38.240
Yes.

38:38.240 --> 38:43.440
So Amazon had their big kind of, you know, event that they talked about all the different

38:43.440 --> 38:48.160
things coming out from Amazon, I think it's like the Amazon fire stuff.

38:48.160 --> 38:53.080
And one of the things that they talked about is a brand new service called Luna.

38:53.080 --> 39:00.640
It is a paid game streaming service that allows subscribers to play PC games remotely on computers,

39:00.640 --> 39:04.480
phones, tablets, and fire TVs, I believe.

39:04.480 --> 39:08.600
So they're charging $5.99 a month.

39:08.600 --> 39:16.680
And you get a curated library of PC games called, I guess, the Luna plus game channel.

39:16.680 --> 39:21.680
And you can check out quite a few different games on there.

39:21.680 --> 39:26.280
So some of the stuff that I noticed off, you know, top my head here looking at this, they

39:26.280 --> 39:28.120
got some pretty decent stuff on there.

39:28.120 --> 39:32.640
There's luminous on their control grid.

39:32.640 --> 39:38.000
And then more indie titles, like they have two point hospital, over cook to rhyme Ubisoft's

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
in there as well.

39:39.000 --> 39:43.280
A resident in there, South Korea, Valhalla.

39:43.280 --> 39:47.560
So they've got, you know, some bigger titles and a mix of kind of smaller titles in there

39:47.560 --> 39:48.560
as well.

39:48.560 --> 39:55.080
But yeah, and then you can also purchase a controller, which kind of looks like a Nintendo

39:55.080 --> 40:00.480
switch pro controller, but with purple, which I kind of like the way that looks.

40:00.480 --> 40:05.480
And yeah, plus there's since, you know, they do own Twitch, there is integrated Twitch

40:05.480 --> 40:07.560
functionality as well.

40:07.560 --> 40:14.640
So you can actually stream directly from that to Twitch, which is kind of cool.

40:14.640 --> 40:20.320
Do you know that comic where it's got the two characters and the one like has like a

40:20.320 --> 40:26.560
neat painting or something and the character goes, you made this and then takes the painting

40:26.560 --> 40:30.360
and the last frame is like, I made this, you know, that whole thing where it's like, they

40:30.360 --> 40:31.600
stole the thing.

40:31.600 --> 40:32.600
Yeah.

40:32.600 --> 40:35.920
That is what Amazon just did to Google Stadia in my opinion.

40:35.920 --> 40:37.520
Yes, pretty much.

40:37.520 --> 40:43.080
I mean, the difference though, with this and Stadia obviously is this is similar to like

40:43.080 --> 40:50.840
a games pass or PlayStation now service where Stadia is even less of a less attractive because

40:50.840 --> 40:51.840
yeah.

40:51.840 --> 40:58.800
And that's exactly why I'm like Amazon just kind of like just snatched it from Google.

40:58.800 --> 41:01.960
And I just like, especially when it comes to like the Twitch integration, oh, it's all

41:01.960 --> 41:06.680
those things that YouTube should probably already be at when it comes to Stadia.

41:06.680 --> 41:11.740
And well, yeah, Stadia still not out of beta.

41:11.740 --> 41:16.760
Don't we still not have open services out of that was supposed to happen the first quarter

41:16.760 --> 41:17.760
of this year.

41:17.760 --> 41:18.760
What the hell happened?

41:18.760 --> 41:23.920
Well, besides COVID okay, but it's been, we're talking about online stuff.

41:23.920 --> 41:30.880
What's that additional beta is that when us being in COVID and, you know, using a lot

41:30.880 --> 41:34.320
more online services be additional beta testing.

41:34.320 --> 41:35.320
Yeah.

41:35.320 --> 41:40.760
But I guess developers and everything, but yeah, honestly, I like the way the controller

41:40.760 --> 41:41.760
looks.

41:41.760 --> 41:42.760
I like purple.

41:42.760 --> 41:44.640
I mean, maybe I just need to get purple controller.

41:44.640 --> 41:45.640
Yes.

41:45.640 --> 41:46.640
We hear it.

41:46.640 --> 41:47.640
The voice geeks network love purple.

41:47.640 --> 41:48.640
Exactly.

41:48.640 --> 41:51.080
So I mean, I don't know.

41:51.080 --> 41:54.160
It's all right.

41:54.160 --> 41:58.800
But like, I'm not going to probably buy it.

41:58.800 --> 41:59.800
It's a neat idea.

41:59.800 --> 42:01.920
I'm curious to see how that works out.

42:01.920 --> 42:06.320
Hey, maybe they'll throw it into, you know, prime or something like that.

42:06.320 --> 42:07.320
Oh, that would be great.

42:07.320 --> 42:08.320
Prime.

42:08.320 --> 42:09.320
Yeah.

42:09.320 --> 42:10.320
And then you get that as well.

42:10.320 --> 42:11.880
But I don't know.

42:11.880 --> 42:12.880
We'll see.

42:12.880 --> 42:15.960
You know, it's interesting because we just had this discussion last week and we had the

42:15.960 --> 42:20.120
round table and everything about the mid roll ads on Twitch and Twitch, maybe not, you know,

42:20.120 --> 42:22.880
making enough money right now and they're having to look at other ways to make money.

42:22.880 --> 42:27.440
Well, I would think this might be one of the ways where Twitch can help the Amazon machine

42:27.440 --> 42:32.160
make money that, you know, I'm not saying that, you know, it's maybe going to be enough

42:32.160 --> 42:37.820
to keep Twitch running, but it is something that is going to add value to the company.

42:37.820 --> 42:42.200
You know, the ability to, I would assume one day just jump right into these games that

42:42.200 --> 42:44.960
streamers are playing.

42:44.960 --> 42:47.360
And I see that happen a lot.

42:47.360 --> 42:51.340
One game that Alan has been playing a ton of lately is Dead by Daylight.

42:51.340 --> 42:53.440
He's been playing that game a lot.

42:53.440 --> 42:56.880
He played, you know, he gets super into one game at a time and that's the game right now.

42:56.880 --> 43:01.120
But what I see him doing, he has streamer friends.

43:01.120 --> 43:04.140
He has, you know, two or three regular, he probably has more than that, but two or three

43:04.140 --> 43:08.160
that I regularly see streamer friends and they'll be online and playing.

43:08.160 --> 43:12.160
And when he sees them online and playing and there's a spot, he'll just jump in and join

43:12.160 --> 43:14.240
and play the game with them.

43:14.240 --> 43:20.040
And so that whole process, I just explained, is probably going to be very, very easy with

43:20.040 --> 43:21.520
something like Luna.

43:21.520 --> 43:24.680
You know, if you see your streamer friend playing the game, just click here to join

43:24.680 --> 43:26.400
in.

43:26.400 --> 43:28.880
If the streamer wants that and their privacy settings are set up.

43:28.880 --> 43:29.880
Yeah.

43:29.880 --> 43:36.080
So I mean, assuming that's how they set it up, which would be very similar to like Stadia,

43:36.080 --> 43:39.120
but I just don't see a lot of people using that.

43:39.120 --> 43:44.360
Like it seems like a cool idea, but like I don't think there's a lot of people playing

43:44.360 --> 43:50.920
Stadia and honestly, like the folks that are streaming to YouTube or even Twitch, I don't

43:50.920 --> 43:55.800
think that they're using these services.

43:55.800 --> 43:56.800
I mean, I don't know.

43:56.800 --> 44:01.240
Well, one reason you can't really, you can't really stream Stadia right now, anytime I've

44:01.240 --> 44:05.400
shown Stadia here on OLR, I prerecorded it and then I showed it here.

44:05.400 --> 44:10.400
You can't really stream Stadia because you can't have the bandwidth to send that all

44:10.400 --> 44:11.400
up.

44:11.400 --> 44:14.240
Well, maybe you do depending on your internet, but right now most people don't have the capability

44:14.240 --> 44:15.240
to...

44:15.240 --> 44:16.240
It's all remote.

44:16.240 --> 44:17.240
Right.

44:17.240 --> 44:22.360
But if Luna is integrated with Amazon and it's all tied together, then hypothetically,

44:22.360 --> 44:26.520
you can kind of hit a button to stream your gameplay and it's going to stream from the

44:26.520 --> 44:30.420
web services side and it would require...

44:30.420 --> 44:31.880
That's how Stadia works as well.

44:31.880 --> 44:35.680
It's just Stadia sucks, but that's how it works as well.

44:35.680 --> 44:38.760
It streams from Google's cloud services or whatever.

44:38.760 --> 44:39.760
To YouTube?

44:39.760 --> 44:40.760
Yeah.

44:40.760 --> 44:41.760
To YouTube.

44:41.760 --> 44:42.760
Oh.

44:42.760 --> 44:48.240
That's because that's how it does, for example, if your PC or whatever you're streaming on

44:48.240 --> 44:52.840
can't handle 4K or something like that, so you're playing in 1080p or something.

44:52.840 --> 44:55.460
When you stream it to YouTube, it's actually in 4K.

44:55.460 --> 45:01.560
The fact that I, a streamer, don't even know about that whole stuff, I thought I read that

45:01.560 --> 45:06.200
that was going to be a thing, I didn't realize that it was already baked in, says a lot

45:06.200 --> 45:07.200
about Stadia.

45:07.200 --> 45:08.200
Yeah.

45:08.200 --> 45:09.200
Well, okay, so...

45:09.200 --> 45:12.840
Once again, don't care because it's Stadia and I'm not buying games on that service and

45:12.840 --> 45:15.400
I'm not using it and...

45:15.400 --> 45:17.800
So I don't care, sorry.

45:17.800 --> 45:22.680
I think depending on the game, especially when it comes to MMOs and things that are

45:22.680 --> 45:27.920
specifically multiplayer, I think there will be a place for jumping right in with your

45:27.920 --> 45:31.560
favorite streamer, just like Alan does already with something like Dead by Daylight.

45:31.560 --> 45:37.200
Unfortunately, a game like Control, a game like Luminous, a game like Res Infinite, those

45:37.200 --> 45:40.600
are all fantastic games, but they're not games you're going to jump in and play with your

45:40.600 --> 45:41.600
favorite streamer.

45:41.600 --> 45:43.320
It's going to take the right game.

45:43.320 --> 45:44.320
Something like...

45:44.320 --> 45:48.240
You know the game Luna needs tomorrow?

45:48.240 --> 45:49.680
Among Us.

45:49.680 --> 45:51.120
Hello!

45:51.120 --> 45:55.640
That's like a 10-person game and that would be a great one that you could just...

45:55.640 --> 45:59.960
How often do I see that being played on a Twitch where then one person has to go and

45:59.960 --> 46:02.800
it's like they have a hole in the game so they have to change the rules or they have

46:02.800 --> 46:05.080
to have a rando, which gets weird.

46:05.080 --> 46:06.080
Hello!

46:06.080 --> 46:10.760
That's the game that you would be able to jump in and easily play with your friends.

46:10.760 --> 46:16.720
Or something like 100 vs. 1, a Fortnite, a Tetris 99.

46:16.720 --> 46:17.720
What's that?

46:17.720 --> 46:18.720
It's like free and mobile.

46:18.720 --> 46:19.720
Yeah, it uses ads.

46:19.720 --> 46:21.640
It's like five bucks, you know?

46:21.640 --> 46:22.640
So...

46:23.640 --> 46:24.640
Just pay the five dollars.

46:24.640 --> 46:25.640
I mean, it's...

46:25.640 --> 46:27.480
I don't know.

46:27.480 --> 46:31.640
But that integration would still go a long way, I'm just saying.

46:31.640 --> 46:32.640
Yeah.

46:32.640 --> 46:33.640
Anyway.

46:33.640 --> 46:38.680
So are you interested in more about Luna or...

46:38.680 --> 46:39.680
Probably not really.

46:39.680 --> 46:40.680
No.

46:40.680 --> 46:46.480
Funny enough, even though I'm kind of wary about having Amazon have access to cameras

46:46.480 --> 46:52.000
in my house, that camera thing that they've got on the drone camera that they have is

46:52.040 --> 46:53.440
kind of cool.

46:53.440 --> 46:56.440
But aside from that, I don't know.

46:56.440 --> 46:58.080
I do like the drone camera.

46:58.080 --> 46:59.080
That's kind of neat.

46:59.080 --> 47:00.080
But...

47:00.080 --> 47:01.080
Well, we have that...

47:01.080 --> 47:02.080
What is it?

47:02.080 --> 47:03.080
Ring or whatever?

47:03.080 --> 47:04.080
We have Amazon's camera thing in our house.

47:04.080 --> 47:05.080
That's what it is.

47:05.080 --> 47:10.960
It's a Ring camera, but it's a drone, so it flies around your house in film stuff.

47:10.960 --> 47:12.000
That's kind of cool.

47:12.000 --> 47:17.320
Someone in Amazon HQ wants to watch me walk from the bedroom to the shower.

47:17.320 --> 47:19.760
I hope they enjoy what they see, honestly.

47:19.760 --> 47:20.760
It's just...

47:20.760 --> 47:21.760
Whatever.

47:21.760 --> 47:24.520
I don't care.

47:24.520 --> 47:26.520
Camera's not pointed that way anyway.

47:26.520 --> 47:27.520
Anyway.

47:27.520 --> 47:35.240
For me, the Amazon Luna streaming, it's a great example of what I just said about now

47:35.240 --> 47:39.760
Microsoft is way far out in front of the competition.

47:39.760 --> 47:45.480
I kind of look at this and I go, oh, this is cool, but I have Game Pass already now,

47:45.480 --> 47:46.480
and there's like...

47:46.480 --> 47:47.480
I don't really see...

47:47.480 --> 47:48.880
There's some nice games here.

47:48.880 --> 47:53.500
The ones I would want to play, I pretty much already own already, though, so this is cool.

47:53.500 --> 47:57.440
This would have been a lot better two years ago.

47:57.440 --> 48:03.200
This is a perfect example of when I say Microsoft is way far out in front, and the other people

48:03.200 --> 48:05.240
are going to take too long.

48:05.240 --> 48:07.360
This is a great example of that.

48:07.360 --> 48:10.800
Luna's getting out the door about two years too late.

48:10.800 --> 48:19.080
And I would say, though, that probably this is already a step up from Google Stadia, just

48:19.080 --> 48:20.580
from their initial offering.

48:20.580 --> 48:21.760
Just sounds better anyways.

48:21.760 --> 48:22.760
There's more games.

48:22.760 --> 48:23.760
It doesn't...

48:23.760 --> 48:26.440
You don't have to pay for each additional game.

48:26.440 --> 48:32.320
I get it that Google Stadia has that library that's available, but that's not the same

48:32.320 --> 48:34.760
thing.

48:34.760 --> 48:37.760
That's like calling what PlayStation Plus has the same thing as Game Pass.

48:37.760 --> 48:39.160
It's not the same thing.

48:39.160 --> 48:41.280
So I just...

48:41.280 --> 48:46.320
I think it's already a little bit better, but still that's like...

48:46.320 --> 48:47.680
It's not all that attractive.

48:47.680 --> 48:51.320
That's like saying, you know, this...

48:51.320 --> 48:56.640
To go back to the analogy that we were using earlier, Google Stadia's Crackle, although

48:56.640 --> 48:59.760
I don't think you have paid for Crackle, but let's just say that you did.

48:59.760 --> 49:05.240
So Google Stadia, or maybe it's like Voodoo, okay, so it's not necessarily...

49:05.240 --> 49:14.880
It's Voodoo to Amazon's Quibi, but it's not going to compete with Hulu or Netflix.

49:14.880 --> 49:17.360
Now that's just mean to call it Quibi.

49:17.360 --> 49:18.360
Come on.

49:18.360 --> 49:19.880
That's mean.

49:19.880 --> 49:22.880
Don't do that.

49:22.880 --> 49:26.480
It's not as good as obviously the other stuff, but you never know.

49:26.480 --> 49:27.480
It could get better.

49:27.480 --> 49:30.000
I mean, and it already has like the opportunity to do that.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.060
I'd like to see what they're going to do with it.

49:32.060 --> 49:36.100
And whatever happened to all these games that Amazon was supposed to be putting out,

49:36.100 --> 49:38.380
like, don't they have some games that they're working on?

49:38.380 --> 49:41.180
Like I thought there was some Amazon game studios or something that...

49:41.180 --> 49:47.220
Yeah, the RPG, I keep seeing some people playing it on Twitch.

49:47.220 --> 49:48.820
I don't know if it's still like...

49:48.820 --> 49:49.820
Oh, right, right, right.

49:49.820 --> 49:54.500
Is it the one that's like a Fortnite, but like it's like a Battle Royale...

49:54.500 --> 49:57.060
No, Spellbreak, that's not an Amazon thing.

49:57.060 --> 49:58.060
Okay.

49:58.060 --> 49:59.060
That's not...

49:59.060 --> 50:00.060
Okay.

50:00.060 --> 50:01.060
No.

50:01.060 --> 50:02.060
Okay.

50:02.060 --> 50:03.060
Thank you, Questbuster.

50:03.060 --> 50:04.060
Oh.

50:04.060 --> 50:05.060
Preview events is what it is.

50:05.060 --> 50:06.060
New World.

50:06.060 --> 50:07.060
Got it.

50:07.060 --> 50:08.060
All right.

50:08.060 --> 50:09.060
Moving on.

50:09.060 --> 50:10.860
Let's talk about No Man's Sky.

50:10.860 --> 50:15.320
So No Man's Sky is a game that I've been playing an awful lot of this week, and pretty much

50:15.320 --> 50:20.700
the catalyst for me jumping on it again was the 3.0 update.

50:20.700 --> 50:25.860
So there was a big 3.0 update called Origins, and what did Origins do?

50:25.860 --> 50:30.460
So the Origins update added billions of new planets, apparently.

50:30.460 --> 50:36.400
They also changed the diversity of flora and fauna, also changing different weather systems

50:36.400 --> 50:38.940
and making more dramatic terrain types.

50:38.940 --> 50:42.600
So basically they're saying in a short, it changes pretty much everything, and as far

50:42.600 --> 50:47.700
as like the look of the game and what you encounter on the planets, it definitely does

50:47.700 --> 50:50.240
change a lot of things.

50:50.240 --> 50:56.300
In this playthrough that I have, so I started over, and honestly, if you've spent like less

50:56.300 --> 50:59.380
than 10 hours on your save file, just start over.

50:59.380 --> 51:02.900
Like there's so much in the tutorial, there's so much that it walks you through and so forth

51:02.900 --> 51:08.580
that you are going to have a lot to discover and see and do, and you're not going to feel

51:08.580 --> 51:12.360
like you're retreading the same path because you're going to be on New Worlds and things

51:12.360 --> 51:15.220
like that, and now everything looks a little bit different.

51:15.220 --> 51:20.740
So I would say just start over, especially those of you guys that like bought No Man's

51:20.740 --> 51:25.540
Sky back when it first launched and haven't touched it since, this is probably a pretty

51:25.540 --> 51:29.080
good time to jump in and check that stuff out.

51:29.080 --> 51:31.560
So I've been really enjoying my time with the game.

51:31.560 --> 51:36.000
I've gotten further in, even though the story branches in multiple paths, so there isn't

51:36.000 --> 51:41.200
like really a story, but I feel like I'm farther in a couple of those paths than I was ever

51:41.200 --> 51:45.720
in any of my previous playthroughs, of which I've rebooted No Man's Sky like five times

51:45.720 --> 51:46.720
now.

51:46.720 --> 51:50.360
Yeah, I haven't played in a long time, and I was actually thinking about, you know, booting

51:50.360 --> 51:54.300
it up on PC, which I haven't played at all because I purchased that when I was on sale

51:54.300 --> 51:58.260
one time, and I was like, oh, I should really go back and play that because I haven't played

51:58.300 --> 51:59.300
it since.

51:59.300 --> 52:00.300
Yeah.

52:00.300 --> 52:01.300
1.0.

52:01.300 --> 52:05.340
And Bobby Blackwell says, did you start over on PC or PS4?

52:05.340 --> 52:10.940
I started over on PS4, however, if you aren't already aware, No Man's Sky put in cross-play

52:10.940 --> 52:13.060
like two patches ago.

52:13.060 --> 52:18.060
So you will see a little icon now next to usernames that show you what it says.

52:18.060 --> 52:20.500
I don't know how they handled the world naming.

52:20.500 --> 52:22.900
Like if two people were in it, I don't know how they did that.

52:22.900 --> 52:25.980
That didn't affect anything because I've been starting new games and such.

52:25.980 --> 52:27.420
Have they reset all that?

52:27.460 --> 52:28.460
I don't think they did.

52:28.460 --> 52:29.780
In fact, I know they didn't.

52:29.780 --> 52:31.740
I'm going to get to that in a minute.

52:31.740 --> 52:36.500
But you have now if you have a friend code, basically, which I know is dumb, but it's

52:36.500 --> 52:37.820
how they get away with it.

52:37.820 --> 52:41.380
So basically what you do if you add somebody by their No Man's Sky friend code, then it

52:41.380 --> 52:44.940
doesn't matter what platform they're on and you will see them on your No Man's Sky friend

52:44.940 --> 52:46.920
list and you can interact with them and so forth.

52:46.920 --> 52:50.500
So PC, PS4, Xbox, and it's on Game Pass.

52:50.500 --> 52:52.420
So it doesn't matter anymore.

52:52.420 --> 52:55.020
So that's that's the really good news about that.

52:55.020 --> 52:56.020
Yeah.

52:56.020 --> 52:59.620
And Questbuster says players have icons that can tell you if they're PC or PS4 players.

52:59.620 --> 53:00.620
Yeah.

53:00.620 --> 53:03.780
It has a little keyboard and mouse for PC and then Xbox has like an Xbox shape controller

53:03.780 --> 53:05.480
and PS4 has PS4.

53:05.480 --> 53:07.100
So yeah.

53:07.100 --> 53:13.800
Now the base where I've established on is now I've called the planet MSEP for Main Street

53:13.800 --> 53:19.620
Electrical Parade because it's one of those planets where like the flora and fauna glow

53:19.620 --> 53:22.460
at night and it looks very neon.

53:22.460 --> 53:25.780
It looks like Darnassus and wow, except more red than purple.

53:25.780 --> 53:29.140
It's really pretty like the way it glows and I set up my base there and I really, really

53:29.140 --> 53:30.140
like it.

53:30.140 --> 53:34.300
Sorry, I should have got some video of it, but maybe I'll do a stream at some point or

53:34.300 --> 53:35.300
something, but it's really pretty.

53:35.300 --> 53:36.980
So I'm like really into this base.

53:36.980 --> 53:41.860
I've actually built a place to land my ship so you can take off and not have the fuel

53:41.860 --> 53:44.340
costs and all that stuff, which is pretty cool.

53:44.340 --> 53:47.300
Bobby Blackwell says, do they have cross save?

53:47.300 --> 53:50.700
Like can I play on a PS4 and just move to a PC with the same game?

53:50.700 --> 53:57.660
I'm not sure, but I'm leaning towards no, just because I haven't seen it, but I would

53:57.660 --> 54:01.540
Google it or something before I definitively answer that question because again, they've

54:01.540 --> 54:04.180
been changing a lot with the game.

54:04.180 --> 54:08.020
Now here's the downside to this patch.

54:08.020 --> 54:11.420
And for people that have been playing the game a long time, some people may have built

54:11.420 --> 54:16.620
their base on a really pretty planet before and that planet may have changed.

54:16.620 --> 54:18.500
I didn't realize this was part of it.

54:18.500 --> 54:22.940
When they talk about all the flora and fauna and all this stuff, they changed old planets

54:22.940 --> 54:24.980
to put in all this new stuff.

54:24.980 --> 54:31.100
Now they didn't go so far as to, if you were on a non-environmental hazard planet before,

54:31.100 --> 54:33.140
suddenly you're on a toxic nightmare planet.

54:33.140 --> 54:37.100
They didn't do that, but they definitely changed planets.

54:37.100 --> 54:42.460
And so some people had their bases on these really like perfect planets and this update,

54:42.460 --> 54:43.460
Oh great.

54:43.460 --> 54:47.460
A volcano is now next to their base, you know?

54:47.460 --> 54:51.960
And yes, there is now a weather circumstance where it can rain fire.

54:51.960 --> 54:55.300
And I actually saw this on a planet where it was literally called that circumstance

54:55.300 --> 54:56.300
2020.

54:56.300 --> 54:59.140
It was, they probably should have.

54:59.140 --> 55:03.840
Anyway, to put this together and show you what I mean, I actually have a little video

55:03.840 --> 55:05.460
I'd like to show you here.

55:05.460 --> 55:09.980
So those of you that have been following VOG for a while and maybe watched some personal

55:09.980 --> 55:14.860
streaming that myself and Bobby Black Wolf do a couple of years ago during the 2.0 upgrade.

55:15.180 --> 55:17.180
And yeah, it was like a couple of years ago.

55:17.180 --> 55:21.920
We started building our bases on a planet called Blissey.

55:21.920 --> 55:24.820
We called it Blissey because it was a peaceful planet.

55:24.820 --> 55:26.300
It looked very earthy.

55:26.300 --> 55:28.580
It looked very serene and peaceful.

55:28.580 --> 55:34.060
I couldn't find any footage of this planet on my Twitch, in my clips, but I did find

55:34.060 --> 55:36.020
some on Bobby Black Wolf's channel.

55:36.020 --> 55:40.340
So here without permission is some footage from Bobby Black Wolf's Twitch.

55:40.340 --> 55:42.060
So this is Blissey.

55:42.060 --> 55:45.820
Now it's at night, but you can see, and I'll, I'll narrate over this a little bit for the

55:45.820 --> 55:46.880
podcast listeners.

55:46.880 --> 55:48.720
You can see it's very green.

55:48.720 --> 55:50.360
It's very beach.

55:50.360 --> 55:54.820
It's very, you know, and you see Bobby running from my base to his base, he's kind of jet

55:54.820 --> 55:55.820
packing.

55:55.820 --> 55:58.260
There's the occasional little animal there.

55:58.260 --> 56:01.140
And you know, you can see like there was like one mountain in the distance and so forth,

56:01.140 --> 56:02.140
right?

56:02.140 --> 56:05.860
So this is the planet Blissey and you know, Bobby's got his base set up and all that fun

56:05.860 --> 56:06.980
stuff.

56:06.980 --> 56:10.260
Here is what Blissey looks like now.

56:10.260 --> 56:15.740
So I booted up my old save file on my PlayStation five or my PlayStation five.

56:15.740 --> 56:18.540
I wish my PlayStation four earlier today.

56:18.540 --> 56:19.540
Look at that.

56:19.540 --> 56:20.580
It's all pink.

56:20.580 --> 56:23.140
Now there's this pink fauna.

56:23.140 --> 56:27.540
Well for one, I spawned right on top of a toxic plant, which is kind of annoying.

56:27.540 --> 56:31.860
So there's that now to deal with, but I kind of laughed when I saw it was all pink with

56:31.860 --> 56:36.820
the flaunt, uh, with the fauna and stuff on the ground because excuse me, the flora fauna

56:36.820 --> 56:37.820
would be the animals.

56:37.820 --> 56:38.880
We'll get to that in a minute.

56:38.880 --> 56:43.740
The flora is all pink and it made me laugh because Blissey is a pink Pokemon.

56:43.740 --> 56:45.560
So that kind of cracked me up.

56:45.560 --> 56:47.120
I was checking here in the interface.

56:47.120 --> 56:50.680
This is just recorded live game players checking in the interface because I was like, why don't

56:50.680 --> 56:53.780
you'll notice in the lower left, I don't see the actual planet.

56:53.780 --> 56:58.720
We renamed it to Blissey, but I was seeing the old name and check out that gigantic monolith.

56:58.720 --> 57:01.040
We just saw in the video was not there before.

57:01.040 --> 57:02.680
So that was something that was added there.

57:02.680 --> 57:03.680
Uh, yeah.

57:03.680 --> 57:06.920
So even though the name in the corner says like Etome, some of the something, it's actually

57:06.920 --> 57:07.920
the planet Blissey.

57:07.920 --> 57:09.920
And you could see that in the online services.

57:09.920 --> 57:14.240
I think that probably just has something to do with some of the changes and so forth.

57:14.240 --> 57:19.760
Um, now what we're seeing in the footage, there are all of these animals everywhere.

57:19.760 --> 57:23.280
Whereas in the old footage, you would see the occasional one animal.

57:23.280 --> 57:27.420
There's like all these little turtle looking things everywhere now and so forth.

57:27.420 --> 57:32.760
And now here's where I'm doing that exact same run to Bobby's base that he was doing

57:32.760 --> 57:33.760
in the old footage.

57:33.760 --> 57:39.100
You can see just how different the ground looks with the varied kind of like pink fauna

57:39.100 --> 57:43.000
animals everywhere now that were in the old one and so forth.

57:43.000 --> 57:48.000
So I'm scanning some of these animals, but as I am doing some scanning, one of the, so

57:48.000 --> 57:50.600
a lot of this is like, cool, gray, awesome.

57:50.600 --> 57:51.600
Looks great.

57:51.600 --> 57:53.480
Let me show you the punchline.

57:53.480 --> 57:57.040
Look carefully on the left hand side of the screen while I start to scan some of these

57:57.040 --> 57:59.920
things where it talks about what is going on with the planet.

57:59.920 --> 58:02.640
Look at the left side of the screen and for the podcast was just going to read it.

58:02.640 --> 58:08.200
It says lethal humidity outbreaks.

58:08.200 --> 58:09.200
Hold up.

58:09.200 --> 58:10.200
Hold up.

58:10.200 --> 58:11.200
So you're in Florida?

58:11.200 --> 58:12.200
Hold up.

58:12.200 --> 58:20.660
The planet Blissey, our peaceful, nice, quiet planet where we established our VOG bases

58:20.660 --> 58:24.280
and here's me running to Bobby's base and it's going to show the message and so forth.

58:24.280 --> 58:32.560
The lovely planet, serene, quiet Blissey has lethal humidity outbreaks.

58:32.560 --> 58:39.260
I don't even know what that is to begin with, but sounds very 2020 as some folks are saying

58:39.260 --> 58:42.080
in chat, but yeah.

58:42.080 --> 58:47.220
So anyway, that just kind of cracked me up there as we were doing that.

58:47.220 --> 58:50.320
So anyway, there it is.

58:50.320 --> 58:55.740
A look back at, or a look forward as well as a look back at No Man's Sky.

58:55.740 --> 59:00.640
So anyway, I do recommend the patch and checking out No Man's Sky.

59:00.640 --> 59:01.640
It's pretty cool.

59:01.720 --> 59:05.280
So, all right, let's go ahead and move on with some more stories.

59:05.280 --> 59:07.720
Loki, what do you have for us up next?

59:07.720 --> 59:09.080
All right.

59:09.080 --> 59:15.960
So Among Us is obviously very popular as of late and as such, the developers behind the

59:15.960 --> 59:21.420
game announced that Among Us 2, which was originally announced almost 40 days ago has

59:21.420 --> 59:22.420
now been canceled.

59:22.420 --> 59:29.180
They have canceled it because they are working on continuing to support the original game

59:29.180 --> 59:32.060
and the content for that because it's so popular.

59:32.060 --> 59:33.220
So it makes sense.

59:33.220 --> 59:40.080
You don't want to just like, you know, separate the crowd they're playing Among Us among two

59:40.080 --> 59:41.080
different games.

59:41.080 --> 59:42.740
Then you have to support two different games.

59:42.740 --> 59:48.300
It's just easier to put the content into the original one, which yeah, I'm fine with that.

59:48.300 --> 59:50.260
So pretty cool.

59:50.260 --> 59:52.260
Yep, yep.

59:52.260 --> 59:56.400
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I feel for the devs because the original game's code

59:56.400 --> 01:00:01.000
base sounds unwieldy to add to, like Minecraft's was, and they wanted to start over with all

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
the lessons they learned.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Yeah.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.680
So it's an interesting kind of side effect of the game becoming so popular.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.960
It's almost like, oh crap, now we're stuck with this now.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:15.000
I mean, I get, they could have just done a part two, but maybe they're worried like,

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.200
and I get it like a part two, there's a lot of risks that come with that, you know?

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:26.360
Yeah, they could, I could see them doing something similar to like, well, probably a bad example

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:31.520
but what Ingress did where they just, you know, redid the scanner, completely redesigned

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:32.880
it from the ground up.

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.240
They could do that with this game.

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:38.720
So number two is technically number one, it's just like 2.0 or something like that.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:39.720
Oh.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.540
They just replaced the whole thing.

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:45.080
We were just talking about a game that did something like that actually.

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:47.560
So I guess that would make a lot of sense, right?

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:48.560
Right, exactly.

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:52.120
So I could see him doing something like that, but no, at least as long as they're still

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.600
continuing to support it, I think it's still pretty good.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:55.600
Yeah.

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:56.840
Okay, fair enough.

01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:57.840
All right.

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:00.440
Well, let's move on talking about other updates.

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:05.180
Let's talk about Animal Crossing, which is going to be getting a pretty large fall update.

01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:09.020
So there's going to be some Halloween events coming to Animal Crossing.

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:11.040
Of course, there has to be Halloween events, right?

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:12.040
Because all the games have had them.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.040
Yeah.

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:16.760
And if you didn't know this about Animal Crossing, you can't just data mine it off the disc,

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:20.920
the cartridge, whatever the files now, because they didn't even put in the holiday events

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.700
because they didn't want people, or they probably weren't done yet, but they don't want people

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:25.240
spoiling them either.

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:28.120
So now they're going to be patching in the Halloween events since Halloween's coming

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.120
up.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:34.120
And there's Jack the Lantern is going to be somebody that visits.

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:39.140
He'll have Halloween goodies, and there'll be a Halloween event and game with candy that

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:41.000
you buy and you give it to residents.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.580
There are also going to be pumpkins in the game, and it's going to be part of crafting.

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:48.520
So no word if I'll get my pumpkin spice latte, but I imagine there'll be things like pumpkin

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:52.400
chairs, pumpkin couches, pumpkin beds, which sounds fun, I guess.

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:56.400
It is all launching this coming week, September 30th is when the new update is coming.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:01.760
Nintendo put out a video to their social media channels that shows everything to look forward

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:02.760
to.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:07.780
There's going to be another patch that will introduce the holiday events coming in November,

01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:13.540
and I imagine they're not going to want to patch it in late December because of the holidays.

01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:16.520
Even if the holidays are a little different in Japan than they are here, it's just still,

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:19.200
it's not a good time to be doing those patches.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:24.720
So November is probably when we're going to start to see that stuff pasted or patched

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:28.240
into the game.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:31.120
On that note, I haven't touched Animal Crossing in a couple of weeks now.

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:35.000
I think it finally wore off for me.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.520
That big stream we did a couple of weeks ago was probably like the last hurrah.

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:41.960
I've played a couple of times since then, but I just got frustrated with the fact that

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:44.400
I was not getting any more photos from villagers.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:47.720
I was visiting every single day, trading stuff, and I was not getting pictures.

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:51.000
And I was like, you know what, there's nothing else for me to do in this game right now.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.320
I'm going to go play Hades instead.

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:55.840
Yeah, my wife's been playing that to get photos now.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:00.120
So she's been doing that and remodeling some of the island stuff.

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.120
Maybe the fault.

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:05.200
I mean, I would be lying if I said, oh, I'm not going to check it out anymore because

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.040
I'm certainly not anti-Animal Crossing or anything.

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.800
It's just, I think I just kind of wore the game out.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:13.520
But I think it's nice that this is coming because this will give me a reason to boot

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:17.160
it up again and probably check it out a little bit.

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:20.560
And yeah, I'll probably try to craft some of the pumpkin furniture and see what that's

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:24.200
all about because, you know, everybody knows I love my pumpkin spice and stuff like that.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:28.720
So I'll see what kind of fun things I can craft to fit that theme.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:33.080
But then I'll probably get my time taken over with other games again.

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:35.280
It tends to happen.

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:39.240
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I haven't booted Animal Crossing since early July.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:43.120
I'm going to boot it up and find that my village is all flowers everywhere.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:49.640
I don't I'm my understanding is that the towns don't become overrun with weeds anymore.

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:53.920
Like you'll get a day or two worth of weeds, but you're not going to have to clean up like

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:59.740
a month worth of weeds or flower because the game, if you're not there, it doesn't rain.

01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:01.920
It's kind of the logic that the game follows.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:06.200
So if you booted it up tonight, you'd probably find that, yeah, you have a couple of days

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:09.140
worth of damage, but it's not nearly as bad as you would think.

01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:12.940
And in some of the other games, have you been gone for a few months and villagers will reach

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:16.580
you a little bit for not having checked in for a while, but then they'll just go on like

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:17.580
nothing's ever happened.

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:21.260
Like, oh, you just took a little vacation, whatever.

01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:24.420
Black and Pat says, I haven't booted it since Memorial Day weekend.

01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:25.420
Yeah.

01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:27.560
So there's a lot of people haven't checked in in a while to have it.

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:31.740
If you're gone for a long time, that said, he just shouts at you for a while.

01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:32.740
Yeah.

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:33.740
That would be fun.

01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:37.380
See a Tiberian chat says, I still log in at least once a day.

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:39.700
So it's just different for everybody.

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:43.360
And Bobby says, I did hear that villagers don't move out while you're gone.

01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:44.540
They used to in other games.

01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:49.880
That is also true because remember, villagers always ask for your permission to leave now.

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.340
That is different from the other games.

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:53.580
They used to just like leave.

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:57.260
Like you turn on the game one day, bye, I left, I moved over and I packed my shit and

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:59.040
left last night.

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:03.780
And they don't do that anymore, which considering that the game is played by a lot of kids is

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:09.180
probably a good thing because you know, there would be kids that would be gutted if a particular

01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:12.580
villager left their town overnight, because that's what happened to all of us and the

01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:13.580
GameCube version.

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:15.580
Um, so yeah, that doesn't really happen.

01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:17.420
They didn't care about our feelings at all.

01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:18.420
Yeah.

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:20.140
Back then game companies didn't care about you.

01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:26.300
So anyway, uh, no one special 77 chat says people probably have checked in on their Neopets

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:27.340
in decades.

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:29.460
They're probably all decomposed by now.

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:30.460
Digital dust.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:31.460
No.

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:34.220
If you log into Neopets, if you can remember your login and password, they're all still

01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:35.220
there.

01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:39.060
I believe they're probably changed a little bit, but, uh, no, your Neopets do not die.

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:45.900
If you haven't fed them in 20 years, um, it's magic and what's the point then.

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.220
All right.

01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:51.280
Let's move on with more news Loki.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:55.580
So this is kind of disappointing to hear from a first party company, but apparently Sony

01:05:55.580 --> 01:06:01.500
has confirmed that there is no free PlayStation five upgrade for the PlayStation four Spider-Man.

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:06.500
Um, that's not to say that it's not incredibly confusing.

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.580
So let me try to explain it a little bit.

01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:10.100
It's the way this works.

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:15.140
So if you purchase the original Spider-Man game on PlayStation four, well, you're not

01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:22.040
going to get an upgrade to the PlayStation five without rebuying the Marvel's, um, Spider-Man

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:26.740
Miles Morales, which the ultimate edition on that is, I believe, I don't remember they're

01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:29.720
calling out cross play or cross by or whatever.

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:35.140
So basically you get a PlayStation four and PlayStation five version from that.

01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:37.820
And they throw in the original game as a bonus.

01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:42.700
So they're making the original remaster, but they're not going to give it to you if

01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:46.340
you've already paid them money, uh, allegedly.

01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:52.860
And then, um, apparently though, there is also a $20 paid upgrade that you can bump

01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:56.060
up the, um, Miles Morales ultimate edition.

01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:57.060
I'm sorry.

01:06:57.060 --> 01:07:01.900
So you can buy Miles Morales, um, version of the game and it's just that, or you can

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:05.740
buy the ultimate edition, which also throws in the original game as well.

01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:13.660
Um, it's confusing, but this kind of just goes to show you how Sony is taking this next

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:16.060
generation of, um, consoles.

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:23.640
So they are basically making you pay for every little bit of upgrade and whatnot for these

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:29.020
games, much like some of these third party companies are, um, like Activision is wanting,

01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:31.320
you know, $70 for their games as well.

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:36.320
Sony is also charging $70 for their games because they want the money from that.

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:43.520
This is why I am very skeptical on the fact that we will never see a service like games

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.520
pass.

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:47.960
I think, I mean, I guess they have PlayStation now, but it's not the same where it can download

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:51.080
the game, run it natively on the system.

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:52.680
Um, sure.

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:53.960
There'll be PlayStation two games.

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:57.780
And the fact that I think there's more PlayStation two games coming out this week, but they're

01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:59.960
going to sell them to you.

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:04.160
They're not going to give them to you as part of this service or all inclusive thing.

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:08.280
They're going to piecemeal it all out to make as much money as they can off of it.

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:13.720
Um, whereas you have, you know, Nintendo also doing kind of a similar approach where they

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:19.720
don't want to put many titles in their online catalogs because they're worried that devalues

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:20.720
their titles.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:23.360
That's why they never dropped the price on their titles.

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:28.440
Well and there's, there's also the answer as to why you never got like a, uh, Nintendo

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:36.200
64 mini is because with the Nintendo 64 mini, um, you would now have Mario 64 included.

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:41.120
And that's something that they want you to get in the Mario three D all-stars.

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:46.840
I think it's also because they couldn't redo the hardware that they had because the SNES

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:54.840
mini and the Nintendo mini, the NES mini, I guess, um, both ran on identical hardware.

01:08:54.840 --> 01:09:01.160
And so they could essentially just repurpose that they can't do that for Nintendo 64.

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:03.920
It barely works.

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:10.480
You can put into the 64 games on those consoles if you mod them, but it doesn't run well.

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:13.400
They would have to develop new hardware for that.

01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:15.800
And so there's a cost associated with that.

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:19.880
Plus the system would have to be more expensive and it's whether they're going to make their

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:20.880
money back on it.

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:23.680
So it's just not cost effective for them to do that one.

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:29.720
They could just put out, you know, as collection of emulated games and sell for 60 bucks.

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:30.720
Yeah.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:34.480
Uh, I don't think this is the right call for Sony.

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:38.600
Um, you know, I understand games cost money to make, they've got to pay the people to

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:39.600
develop them.

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:44.640
Um, I would have been a little more comfortable maybe with a paid upgrade that isn't quite

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.160
the full cost of the game.

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:49.760
Um, but I think this decision might bite them a little bit because I can tell you for me

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:53.600
personally, I never did get Spiderman for PlayStation four.

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:56.800
I probably would have when it went on a big sale later on.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.000
Um, but I can tell you, I'm not going to now.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.720
Now that I know it's not going to upgrade to the PlayStation five version, well, I'm

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:05.360
just going to hold off until I get a PlayStation five, then I'll revisit Spiderman at that

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.360
point.

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:09.360
Um, wrong call in my opinion.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:16.000
And again, it's something that the competition, Microsoft is approaching a bit differently.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.640
And uh, I just, I hate to see it.

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.640
It's a little frustrating.

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.640
I get it.

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:22.640
That not everything is free.

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:23.640
Yeah.

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:24.640
There does.

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.920
It's some of the stuff does cost money.

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:33.000
My take on it though, is that the additional assets that they're creating for miles Morales,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.040
I mean, they're creating a PlayStation five version, so they have to create the assets,

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:38.960
whether they're not, you know, whether or not they're going to be using it for this

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:41.300
original game or not, they're already being created.

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:44.520
They're already selling you that, that game anyways.

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:49.200
Like I don't understand if they already have this version of the game available, like how

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:51.640
much money are you really losing on that?

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:55.400
I mean, it's just, it's just weird though, that they wouldn't do that.

01:10:55.400 --> 01:11:00.200
I guess that the point is that, well, if you really want to remaster, then you'll want

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:03.720
to purchase this additional thing, but they're just trying to get another sale out of you.

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:07.600
Or as Microsoft, I think would just, a lot of these are free upgrades.

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:08.600
How about this?

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:12.640
You know, cause this would go back to the point I made earlier about, I think that,

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:18.060
you know, no, Microsoft will not sell as many Xboxes this generation as Sony sells PlayStation

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:19.060
five.

01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:23.900
And especially when you factor in Japan, however, uh, that's not the fight Microsoft's fighting.

01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:28.340
Again, it's about how, who has more subscribers to their service at the end of this generation.

01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:35.780
And so my point is, what if Sony made it free for PlayStation plus to get those upgrades?

01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:40.900
And now that would be an added benefit about PlayStation plus that could be interesting.

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:41.900
And I could go for that.

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:42.900
Yeah.

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:46.700
But they're not going to do that because of course they're not, but I'm trying to, I'm

01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:48.820
trying to get her online play.

01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:51.140
And so it's, it's not an, it's on an upsell.

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:55.820
They give an answer that still gives Sony some money.

01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:59.680
I'm trying to go to a reasonable answer that still allows Sony to get some money.

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:00.820
They want all of the money.

01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:04.940
That's why they won't give up Spiderman for the MCU and stuff because they want, they

01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:05.940
want that money.

01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:14.900
And on, I mean, it just, it's, I don't know if people are going to remember it even beyond

01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:20.140
like this, if they continue to do this, go down this path with this generation, but like,

01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:25.540
it just, it's, it, what little money you're losing from this, you could build so much

01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:28.460
goodwill from it, but they just don't care.

01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:32.500
And it's, I don't know, they want all of the pennies.

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:38.880
So we'll see how that strategy pays off, but you know, again, I think when it comes to

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:43.460
places like Japan, it's not going to matter, you know, and Spiderman doesn't exist anywhere

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:45.220
besides PlayStation.

01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:48.780
So they kind of get to call the shots.

01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:50.860
Not a lot we can do about it besides not buy it.

01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:51.860
So, yeah.

01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:52.860
All right.

01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:53.860
Moving on.

01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:59.580
I want to talk a little bit about iOS and Microsoft getting an app on iOS, but it's

01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:01.220
not quite the one you're thinking of.

01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:05.140
It is not the whole cloud issue being resolved, but I'm going to come back to that point in

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:06.140
just a moment.

01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:11.820
Let's we'll come back to that for now, though, an Xbox remote play app is coming to iOS.

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:17.260
So yes, this feature is being tested right now, and apparently it will allow you to connect

01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:23.460
directly to your Xbox One or, of course, the upcoming consoles like Series X, S, et cetera,

01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:26.200
and it will let you play anything that's on your system.

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:31.180
So it's kind of interesting that the cloud thing doesn't work, but this does, but since

01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:36.660
you're connecting to your own system and it's, I guess there's just a difference there, and

01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:40.240
it's all kind of like streaming within your own house or what have you.

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:43.880
So you will be able to use this app to do that.

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:45.940
Again, this is different from X cloud.

01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:48.860
You are streaming from your own box.

01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:54.200
So I don't think that means you could do that out off cellular.

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:55.620
Maybe you can.

01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:58.320
Could you play off cellular to your own Xbox One?

01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:59.720
I'll be a fan with hog.

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:04.280
Probably a lot of the networks out there, but when we finally get better 5G coverage

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:06.340
and there's a bandwidth out there.

01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:12.060
Which if rumors are to be believed is going to be an iOS later this year is 5G.

01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:18.780
Well, they can have whatever they want in iOS, but it's whether the networks are actually

01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:19.780
out there.

01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:20.780
That's going to matter.

01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:21.780
Right?

01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:22.780
Yeah.

01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:23.780
So good.

01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:24.780
They support it.

01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:25.780
Great.

01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:26.780
But like that doesn't actually build the network.

01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:28.940
So, um, I don't know.

01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:30.860
I don't know if the bandwidth's out there for that.

01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:37.020
It would be a cool way to get around, uh, get around the whole iOS problem, you know,

01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:41.480
just stream game pass to your console then stream that to your, I mean, there's more

01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:45.140
latency built up there, but maybe it's not so bad.

01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:50.020
Um, well, since you brought up getting around the iOS store, something we didn't talk about

01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:53.760
in the Luna thing, which I think now's a good time to bring it up since we're talking about,

01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:58.300
you know, Microsoft kind of finding a way into the app store, Luna has figured out how

01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.020
to get an iOS app.

01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:02.080
And basically what they're doing, they're doing something.

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:07.480
This has been around in iOS for a long time, but very few people actually make use of it.

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:10.020
And that is a web app.

01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:14.380
Basically all you're doing, you're making a website bookmark and you, it launches like

01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:16.460
it's an app because that's what it is.

01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:19.420
It's a website bookmark that it's just an app on your phone.

01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:27.020
And so Luna has figured out how to run in a Safari browser window at full speed.

01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:31.660
Maybe this is something where Microsoft isn't at yet, but what's very interesting too.

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:35.620
If you look in some of the Microsoft legal filings and things like that, Microsoft or

01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:39.220
Apple, I'm sorry, in the Apple legal filings.

01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:44.660
And so that in the Epic versus Epic Apple versus Epic thing, good Lord, um, Apple has

01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:50.940
even said if they went down this route of having web apps, this would not be an issue.

01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:52.920
This is a solution for them.

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:59.340
It's just something they're not doing, um, because I believe the backloading of Fortnite

01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:04.440
on Android devices to go around, uh, the store was a similar thing.

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:08.400
I think you were loading it from like a web app type of thing, and it wasn't quite as

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:11.160
well adopted as it was coming from the store.

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:17.760
So I think the, well, that one was downloading an APK on the iOS side.

01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:18.760
I'm not sure.

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:26.360
The Android side, it was downloading a siloed in APK to load it in, but, um, that obviously

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:32.040
you get a whole bunch of popups saying, Oh, this is not secure, dangerous viruses beware.

01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:33.920
Yeah, I get that.

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:40.260
So, um, so it's interesting, but Luna somehow is going to be, cause I can't think of a lot

01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:42.960
of things I've actually saved as web apps.

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:45.660
I remember an early, early conversation.

01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:50.620
Obviously Bobby remembers this too, um, where we were talking about like having like VOG

01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:55.820
or maybe it was even the old network at one point having like a web app that would launch

01:16:55.820 --> 01:17:03.380
and you could have the, I think the old networks radio player trying to encourage people to

01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:04.660
install that as a web app.

01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:07.420
And it's just, it's kind of hard to get that adoption.

01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:11.860
So I kind of wonder how Luna thinks it's going to get adopted.

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:14.500
Maybe because it is, this is a much bigger deal.

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:18.820
This is not some indie podcast networks, little remote player.

01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:23.620
This is how to play control and luminous and res infinite, and it's an Amazon product and

01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:26.720
it'll be advertised on Twitch and all this stuff.

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:29.460
Maybe they figured they're going to get a better adoption rate for it, for the whole

01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:30.900
concept of a web app.

01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:32.200
I don't know.

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:38.020
But anyway, Microsoft could ultimately go down the same route if they can get X cloud

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:41.220
working in a Safari window.

01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:43.700
Um, which we'll see.

01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:46.820
You know, and I don't just mean working, I mean working well.

01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:51.060
You know, because, you know, if it stutters, if it lags, that's all going to look bad on

01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:52.060
Microsoft.

01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:53.060
It's not going to look bad on Apple.

01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:54.500
It's only bad on Microsoft.

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:59.880
So be interesting to see if they figure out a way to resolve that.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:04.700
By the way, there's another app from Microsoft and Xbox coming to iOS.

01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:07.420
So there's lots of apps for Xbox on iOS.

01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:09.540
It's just not, you know, the one everybody's talking about.

01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:13.980
In fact, I think most of our audience will probably not care about this, but some of

01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:14.980
you will.

01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:17.820
It's the Xbox Family Sharing app.

01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:20.700
You know, Nintendo kind of has something like this too, and they have a cute little animation

01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:21.700
for this.

01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:23.940
And this is very common these days now.

01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:28.480
It's basically an app from your phone that allows you to credit your kid or teen or whoever's

01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:33.280
playing on the Xbox credit time, screen time, and you can limit it so that like they only

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:36.560
get an hour on the Xbox a day during the week.

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:39.840
Maybe you can add bonus time if they've done their homework, which is kind of interesting.

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:44.560
It actually shows the little concept video, like one of the kids in the house sending

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:50.200
a message to the parents app, can I have more time on the Xbox and the parent can like accept

01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:53.720
or decline right there, which I think is kind of interesting.

01:18:53.720 --> 01:19:00.280
Is this now, Loki, you have kids, they're not maybe quite at that age yet where they're

01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:01.280
running this.

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:04.960
Well, maybe actually, maybe I don't know, you'd have to tell me, are they running the

01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:09.240
consoles by themselves at this point, or do they still need your help?

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:11.780
And is this an app that you would use in your household?

01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:15.080
I know you don't have Xbox, but hypothetically.

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:17.600
I don't have Xbox yet.

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:19.400
You ordered an X though, right?

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:20.400
Exactly.

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:21.400
Right.

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:22.400
Yeah.

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:23.400
I forgot to get into my game week.

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:24.400
Yeah.

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:25.400
I did get a pre-order for an Xbox Series X.

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:27.440
So we never talked about that.

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:28.440
Yeah.

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:31.200
We'll come back to that in a little bit, the pre-order game.

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:37.800
But I do actually use this because we have Microsoft accounts for, well, he has it for

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:41.800
Roblox and for Minecraft.

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:46.840
So he has to have a Microsoft store account in order to be able to do that.

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:51.400
I did have family settings on there at one point, but then it got like annoying because

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:55.160
we were trying to like do friends, like add each other as friends.

01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:58.240
Like I was trying to have my youngest son and it just was a pain in the butt to get

01:19:58.240 --> 01:19:59.240
it to work right.

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:01.960
I made him an adult nerd.

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:05.680
But now he still has to ask me for permission to be able to buy something from the store

01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:08.720
because he doesn't have a payment card on file.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:11.640
But it was annoying.

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:17.680
He's still a child account, but he took all the restrictions off of it as far as being

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:21.120
able to add friends and stuff like that.

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:24.940
Well, he sells the restrictions on it, but I had to do it to be able to add myself on

01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:27.200
there as so we could all play together.

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:33.840
It's very frustrating to do the basic stuff on there, but they make it that way on purpose

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:36.800
so that you can really lock it down if you want.

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:41.480
But I get like emails and stuff of like how much time he's been spending in different

01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:42.800
apps and stuff like that.

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:45.880
So yeah, so that would be kind of neat.

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:51.520
I mean, he just doesn't play Xbox and he's probably not going to be playing the Xbox.

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:56.400
No one special 77 in chat over Twitch TV slash vog network says on paper, this sounds good,

01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:57.960
but in practice, I don't know.

01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:59.600
The typical kid ain't stupid.

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:03.360
If you thought we were tech savvy as kids compared to our parents, kids nowadays are

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:05.720
more so they'll find a way around this.

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:09.960
Well, the tools do get better, but I will agree as some kids.

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:12.200
Well, some kids figure out how to social engineer.

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:13.200
That's what I did.

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:14.200
Wink.

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:15.200
You.

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:19.960
And what I mean by social engineer is, oh, I got to help you fix your computer here,

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:22.080
but it's asking me for your password to fix the computer.

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:24.720
What's the password?

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:29.040
And then you figure out your parents password by helping with something.

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:30.600
And oh, how about that?

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:33.840
It's the same password that lets me do these other things.

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:39.560
I'm not saying I did or did not do that as a kid.

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:45.680
But I will say my mom had a certain fondness for a certain Hawaiian Island.

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:47.680
Anyway.

01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:51.520
All right.

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:53.240
Let's see.

01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:54.240
Other comment.

01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.000
In chat I was going to read right now.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.000
So OK.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.080
So we'll see what develops with these apps and so forth with Microsoft.

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:03.920
I'm curious to see if they jump on the whole web app thing.

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:05.520
We're going to get to the classic game of the week here.

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:10.720
But actually, before I do, let me insert because you reminded us here, yes, with all this talk

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:15.680
and it's been a fairly busy gaming newsweek between Tokyo Game Show and this huge news

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:18.560
about Microsoft and ZeniMax and all that going on.

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:25.360
So we didn't even talk about that Xbox Series X and S preorders happened this week.

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:30.280
And we mentioned on last week's show, I said I am going to preorder Xbox this time.

01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:33.000
I did not preorder PlayStation 5 yet.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.040
That will be a 2021 thing.

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.840
But I did decide to get Xbox Series X this year.

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:40.660
And Loki also decided to get on the Xbox game.

01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:44.040
So how did it go for you with the preorder, Loki?

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:46.320
It was rather pain free.

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:49.360
I mean, sure, there were sites that were buggy and stuff.

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:53.680
So I tried getting it from a few different places at first, but then it kept saying sold

01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:57.160
out.

01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:01.200
I ended up getting it through Walmart originally.

01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:07.480
And it like three times when I processed it, it kept saying that they were sold out, even

01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:08.880
though I had got one.

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:14.400
And by the third time, then it finally went through, even though I was in like that confirm

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:15.400
thing.

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:19.640
I was just hitting confirm on it and it finally it went through once and I was like, cool,

01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:20.640
done.

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:25.640
But like Amazon, I know immediately the site just crashed immediately or like we were getting

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:32.080
the you know, the something's wrong dogs, you know, and then Best Buy and even Microsoft

01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:33.080
site.

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:34.460
It was just all like unavailable for a while.

01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:43.120
So luckily, I was able to just be there right at eight when it went live and ended up taking,

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:47.520
you know, a preorder with Walmart site before I had like some other stuff.

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:50.400
So it just made sense to do it there.

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:51.660
Congrats.

01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:54.240
So I was looking right at eight a.m.

01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:55.720
I was trying to look at a few sites.

01:23:55.720 --> 01:24:00.800
I was trying to look at Costco because that was on the original list on Microsoft's original

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:01.800
press release.

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:02.800
Costco is there.

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:04.800
I don't think they ever did take preorders to Series X.

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.040
So I'm sitting there trying to load it.

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:07.040
Nothing's showing up.

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:08.400
So I'm like, whatever.

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:09.560
I'm just going to kind of do it.

01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:10.800
A lot of people on Twitter do it.

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:16.560
And I'm going to watch that Wario 64 account, which, you know, hey, props to the guy.

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:21.880
He's very good at or I guess it could be gal or non-binary running that account because

01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:22.880
they've never shown their face.

01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:25.200
It's just a personality.

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:31.280
So with Wario 64 account, they get like all the latest, you know, oh, these sites are

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:32.280
preordered into.

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:37.940
Now, if you didn't know this, they're hiding referral codes in those Amazon links.

01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:43.420
So all y'all that were using that account for your Amazon like that guy just got a salary

01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:47.700
for the whole month off all and probably then some from all your preorders for the Xbox

01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:49.620
Series X and PlayStation 5.

01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:50.620
You know what?

01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:51.620
Yeah.

01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:52.700
You know what he's doing?

01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:54.280
He's doing a service.

01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:55.280
You're using the service.

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.440
It's not costing you anything.

01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:58.180
So I'm not I'm not hating on him.

01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:02.460
I'm just saying that's you know, that ain't nothing free, bitch.

01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:05.440
Anyway, that's what I'm saying.

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:11.520
So I was watching that account in one window and I saw that Target was up and I was having

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:14.020
that problem where I'd add it to the cart.

01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:15.020
My cart doesn't load.

01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:17.980
My cart's empty and all that other stuff.

01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:20.660
So I was just hitting the wall and I was like, why is Amazon up?

01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:21.820
Why is Amazon up?

01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:26.640
Then I see that tweet from Wario go up that says it's up on Amazon.

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:31.060
But instead of clicking the link, I went and I wasn't doing it to be a bitch and go around

01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:32.060
the referral.

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:36.160
I was doing it because I didn't know what that was going to link to.

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:38.660
And I wanted to make sure it was everything.

01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:41.040
I wanted to make sure it was the right vendor.

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:46.660
So I searched Xbox Series X and I did confirm it was a Series X.

01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:51.680
Yes, I heard the stories about the 1Xs that went up and sailed, but it was a Series X.

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:55.980
And I went in and I preordered it and I got it.

01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:58.880
And then I heard the link's not working, all this other stuff.

01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:00.080
Like people were complaining about the links.

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.800
I think what happened.

01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:05.680
I think to get around bots or to get around the site getting hammered, I think Amazon

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:10.780
was cycling those links or killing those links like every 60 seconds.

01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:12.720
I really think that's what they were doing.

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:17.700
So I think searching for it by hand allowed me to get in there pretty early and problem

01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:19.080
free.

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:23.820
However, like many of you about a week later, no, not a week later, but a few days later,

01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:26.280
I got that email from Amazon.

01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:30.360
We're sorry to inform you that because of the demand of this item, you may not get it

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:35.160
on the day, but everybody got that email for the Xbox and everybody got that email

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.400
for the PlayStation 5.

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:43.900
I don't know why it's so fucking difficult for these stores to handle this, especially

01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:45.120
in the PlayStation 5.

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:49.320
I get it because it was, you know, all the oxygen free free for all.

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:56.740
But in the Microsoft side, everybody knew when this was coming.

01:26:56.740 --> 01:27:01.320
And so it's a little difficult and it's a little disappointing to see that the sites

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:07.360
still could not handle it.

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:11.140
Concert tickets seem to work, but we might have to look at getting another system or

01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:16.060
something to preorder because this is getting really annoying.

01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:17.060
I don't know.

01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:21.460
I would have thought that Sony doing it the way they were doing it where you would sign

01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:23.500
up to do a preorder.

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:30.300
I thought that was going to work, but Sony was completely unclear and not transparent

01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:36.140
on who got invited to do it and when they made it sound like only Sony elite were going

01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:37.600
to be able to do it.

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.340
And so that was kind of stupid.

01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:46.560
So I really wish other retailers might adopt a similar strategy where you sign up in advance

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:51.940
and you have to have either like you've you've to F-age your to F-age your phone number.

01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:55.140
You have to have an existing account where you've bought at least one item on the site

01:27:55.140 --> 01:27:59.980
somewhere or something that would make it a lot harder for bots and scalpers to get

01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:00.980
in there.

01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:02.980
I don't know.

01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:04.100
Some other stories in chat.

01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:08.860
Black Compat says it took me an hour to check out my cart on the Microsoft store site.

01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:14.780
I had a Series X in my cart at 1106 Eastern completed the process finally shortly after

01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:16.360
noon my time.

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:19.300
That's probably around the time I finally got through or I got through on Amazon.

01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:22.980
I heard the Microsoft store itself was having some problems.

01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:26.780
So that all was kind of an unfortunate experience.

01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:28.120
I don't know what to say about it.

01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:34.800
As far as my own Xbox, whatever at this point, if I get one launch day, cool.

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:40.580
If I have to wait a few more weeks, whatever, you know.

01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:44.080
Worst case scenario, I walk into a store and I buy one there and then I just cancel the

01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:45.080
Amazon preorder.

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:47.340
At least they don't charge you till they actually ship it.

01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:52.660
It's kind of one of those things where it's like, sure, I'd like to have it on day one,

01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:56.340
but maybe the events of this year have just put a lot of things into perspective where

01:28:56.340 --> 01:29:01.220
it's like, some things are more important and if I don't have an Xbox Series X the very

01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:05.220
first day, I will be able to go on with my life.

01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:09.620
I was just looking for also the accessories and stuff because I'm like, okay, cool.

01:29:09.620 --> 01:29:11.180
Got the preorder.

01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:13.940
What's going to be a launch day game?

01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:14.940
I don't know.

01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:16.740
I don't know what's launching.

01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:18.180
I don't know what the launch games are.

01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:23.140
I don't even know where can I get another controller?

01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:24.140
Where is all this stuff?

01:29:24.140 --> 01:29:27.180
Because none of it was on their websites.

01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:31.380
So I guess I'll just have to wait and find that out, but like, I don't even know what.

01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:32.380
Game pass.

01:29:32.380 --> 01:29:36.660
Game pass will just be where my day one stuff comes from.

01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:42.100
And again, the enhanced backwards compatibility stuff that they're promising will make older.

01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:49.380
I'm really excited to start No Man's Sky again on Xbox Series X because I don't see how it's

01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:55.580
not going to really run at like a PC equivalent on the Series X.

01:29:55.580 --> 01:30:00.220
And I don't know what type of things the developers are doing to bump that up, but I would imagine

01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:05.540
it's going to run very well on the eventual PlayStation 5 release, however they do that,

01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:06.660
and Xbox Series X.

01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:10.500
And that is kind of nice, especially after these stories about Spider-Man, you have to

01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:11.500
pay again.

01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:16.060
It is nice to know that on Xbox Series X and Game Pass, I'll be able to play No Man's Sky

01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:19.420
in sweet, sweet 4K that first day.

01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:23.180
I guess I'll have my cross-play stuff that I completely forgot about because I have it

01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:30.300
on PC, like Crackdown 3 and Forza Horizon 4, and I'm sure there's other things when

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:36.420
I still had Xbox Live Gold that I was adding stuff in, so who knows?

01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:37.420
It'll be a surprise.

01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:41.340
Yeah, and I talked about this when I talked about getting an Xbox versus a PlayStation.

01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:47.420
I feel like PlayStation, okay, they have Spider-Man Miles Morales and they have the Demon's Souls

01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:51.260
remake, neither of which are games I'm that...

01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:55.220
I'm like, okay, I'll check them out eventually, but do I need them day one?

01:30:55.220 --> 01:30:56.220
Nah.

01:30:56.220 --> 01:31:01.780
So I'm going to instead address the discrepancy at home that I have a PS4 Pro, but an old

01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:06.180
Xbox One, so I'm going to bring up Microsoft and at some point I'll catch PlayStation up

01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:07.420
as well next year.

01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:12.460
I just don't need to spend $1,000 on consoles and a new TV on top of that because I don't

01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:14.660
have a 4K TV, but I got to fix that too.

01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:17.460
So something's got to wait for next year, and so it's going to be the PlayStation 5.

01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:20.300
Yeah, I need to get a 4K monitor.

01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:21.300
Yeah.

01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:22.300
All right.

01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:24.700
Now let's travel back to simpler times.

01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:26.740
Let's go back to the past.

01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:32.740
We're going to go back to a simple time when games, you know, you didn't have to have a

01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:34.480
4K TV to play them on.

01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:43.320
You played them on your CRT television in glorious 320 pixel resolution, and you liked

01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:44.320
it.

01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:46.600
It's the classic game of the week, and usually...

01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:47.600
240, I mean.

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:48.600
Was it 240?

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:49.600
I thought it was like 320.

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:50.600
It's 240p.

01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:53.720
I guess it depends on what system it was.

01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:57.560
Anyhow, Dark Sakura would usually be here and step into the gaming vault and find a

01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:02.440
game that she thinks, hey, you brats should be checking this game out, but she is off

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:03.440
tonight for Yom Kippur.

01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:04.480
She's not here with the show.

01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:05.840
She'll be back next week.

01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:10.400
So I have decided to fill in with a choice here, and I feel like this is one Loki might

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:11.400
approve of.

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:12.400
I don't know.

01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:18.840
We'll find out, but I have chosen a game that probably was most famous on the NES, and that's

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:23.080
where the B-roll footage comes from tonight, but it was also very popular on Commodore

01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:28.920
64 and a lot of other 80s and late 80s types of computing systems.

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:34.600
The classic game of the week tonight is Skate or Die.

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:35.600
That's right.

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:36.600
Skate or Die.

01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:38.320
Did you like this game, Loki?

01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:42.640
Yeah, I used to play with my friend down the street all the time.

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:44.280
He had it on the NES.

01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:47.120
Why did this guy in Skate or Die look like Rodney Dangerfield?

01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:49.120
I never understood that.

01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:50.120
Was it...

01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:51.120
I mean, and he was called Rodney.

01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:52.840
That's the creator of the game, I think.

01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:53.840
No, it's not.

01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:54.840
No.

01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:55.840
I think...

01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:58.640
Rodney Dangerfield didn't make Skate or Die, Loki.

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:00.760
No, I understand that.

01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:02.520
I thought that the guy that made it was...

01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:04.120
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:09.680
No, but his name is actually Rodney Recluse, so he even has the same name, except he has

01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:11.960
a tattoo and purple hair and stuff.

01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:14.200
His son, Bionic Lester, that might have...

01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:16.920
Bionic Lester might be the developer, I don't know.

01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:23.840
But the other guy is Rodney Dangerfield, and I never really understood why.

01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:25.640
Nobody's ever really explained this to me.

01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:27.280
All right, anyway.

01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:30.720
Tigerclaw in chat says maybe they were Rodney Dangerfield fans at the time.

01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:36.200
Still, maybe it was easier to steal people's likenesses in the 80s than it is today.

01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:37.200
Yes, probably.

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:38.200
Just like, I don't know.

01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:39.200
Who are we gonna make this guy look like?

01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:40.200
Rodney Dangerfield.

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:41.200
I don't know.

01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:42.200
Anyway.

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:48.000
All right, so this game was released by Electronic Arts, and it was released on the ZX Spectrum,

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:55.260
Commodore 64, Atari ST, the Apple II, GS, the Amstrad, and IBM's under MS-DOS.

01:33:55.260 --> 01:33:59.960
It was also on the NES by Konami, but of course, published by Ultra Games, which was

01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:03.860
how they got around the three games a year limitation in the US.

01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:06.580
Codemasters ended up handling the Atari version.

01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:10.660
Now, what's interesting about this game, it's kind of inspired by, even though it wasn't

01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:19.500
made by Epyx, it was kind of in the style of the Epyx summer games, winter games, California

01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:20.500
games.

01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:22.740
You know all those games that Epyx did back in the day, right?

01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:24.880
This is kind of that, okay?

01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:26.260
But it's all skating.

01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:30.980
I mean, obviously, I think Half-Pipe was one of the games in California games.

01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:34.300
But they kind of made their own version of one of those types of games, and that's what

01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:36.420
Skate or Die essentially is.

01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:38.580
It's a minigame collection.

01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:40.700
Wii Sports was a minigame collection.

01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:44.740
You know, a lot of times with the sports games, these minigames collections do pretty good.

01:34:44.740 --> 01:34:49.560
So the original version was the Commodore 64 version.

01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:52.100
There were three programmers that made that, okay?

01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:56.700
They were previously with Epyx, so that's why, you know, you can say it was inspired

01:34:56.700 --> 01:35:00.500
by those types of games, and those were the games that they had worked on.

01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:06.180
This game was inspired by 720, which I believe Jamie's covered on this show before.

01:35:06.180 --> 01:35:12.540
If not, we've certainly talked about it, which y'all know that as the popular coin-op skateboarding

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:19.420
game that Atari made that ran off the same hardware that like Indiana Jones and Final

01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:24.340
Lap or whatever their racing game was called, all that ran off the same hardware.

01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:29.520
There were several events, freestyle ramp event, high jump, there were downhill events,

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:34.540
the downhill race and a downhill jam, and then there was a pool joust, or an empty pool

01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:37.260
you would kind of skate and try to knock another person over.

01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:38.740
That was kind of interesting.

01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:42.380
So yeah, the game did pretty well.

01:35:42.380 --> 01:35:44.460
It was known for its intro music.

01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:50.780
Again, the original version was the Commodore 64 version, and that was composed by Rob Hubbard,

01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:54.580
and it had a very Commodore 64 SID chip sound to it.

01:35:54.580 --> 01:35:59.980
It actually was redone by Kuji Murata for the NES version.

01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:06.980
So the NES intro is that same Commodore 64 intro just redone for the NES chip sound set,

01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:08.500
which I think is kind of interesting.

01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:15.540
So it sold over 100,000 copies, which isn't too shabby for a video game in that era.

01:36:15.540 --> 01:36:18.220
And there were some follow-ups to this as well.

01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:21.420
There was Ski or Die, did you ever play Ski or Die?

01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:23.380
No, but I've heard of it.

01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:25.980
I think I did play the sequel though.

01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:27.900
It was very similar.

01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:34.100
And then there was also Skate or Die 2, but Skate or Die 2 was only on the NES, and that

01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:35.600
was in 1990.

01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:41.640
So Skate or Die 2 also kind of wasn't the same like mini game format that the other

01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:43.180
games were.

01:36:43.180 --> 01:36:46.680
But Rodney and Lester were back, so there is that.

01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:52.540
Supposedly Criterion Games, the same folks that made Burnout, supposedly they were remaking

01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:58.980
Skate or Die during the PlayStation 2 and Xbox One era, but the game was canceled.

01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:02.920
The good news is though, that's how we got Burnout 3.

01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:08.440
So the Skate or Die remake was in development for 12 months, and then they canceled it.

01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:13.880
So I'd be curious to see if there's a tell-all about that or something that leaks some of

01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:15.960
the footage from that or what have you someday.

01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:21.680
So there you go, that's your classic game of the week, Skate or Die.

01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:28.160
And when it comes to myself and Skate or Die, I will probably just have to die because I'm

01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:29.160
a terrible skater.

01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:32.680
What about you, Loki, were you ever a skateboarder?

01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:36.560
No, I tried, but nah, it was more skating.

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:39.980
I could only really skate in video games, that's for sure.

01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:43.960
Some comments from our chat, Dark Tetsuya says Skate or Die 2 did have the halfpipe

01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:49.640
stuff though, let's see, Dark Tetsuya says I think the joust music might be my favorite

01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:50.640
theme in this.

01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:54.680
Bionic Lester was unbeatable though, well in the little video clip that we pull off

01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:59.200
YouTube, somebody was getting him, so there was that.

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:04.360
Sean 322 talking about Rodney Dangerfield kind of being in the game says, maybe the

01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:07.440
game got no respect.

01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:11.340
Well it sold 100, I think it got a lot of respect, but I appreciate your pun, so there

01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:13.540
is that.

01:38:13.540 --> 01:38:18.480
So yeah, some comments there from our chat on Skate or Die, the classic game of the week.

01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:23.360
Alright, let's get into some fast news, some rapid fire news, which I think has a story

01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:24.360
in here.

01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:29.200
Because I brought up Ultra Games, some of you guys are asking about a certain news topic,

01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:31.380
and I think we're going to get into it here shortly.

01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:33.960
So Loki, rapid fire news tonight.

01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:40.920
Yeah, so there was a game that I grew up with on the Windows, I think it was 3-1 maybe,

01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:46.800
but it was an old game called Chips Challenge, and it was a puzzle game that they had in,

01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:51.880
I can't remember, it was like the Windows party pack or some sort of pack that had little

01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:53.680
games in there.

01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:59.360
Chips Challenge has actually now been released for free on Steam, so you can go check it

01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:06.560
out for free now and play the wonderful, it looks like it's slightly updated, but the

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:08.760
game from the 90s.

01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:12.680
And yeah, it's pretty awesome, so go check it out.

01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:17.780
I always crack up at stories about Chips Challenge because I know the guy who made it.

01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:23.560
We play games together, I've been to his house, Chuck, I gotta get him on OLR at some point.

01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:25.920
He's under Chuck's Challenge.

01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:29.920
I know, yeah, he's talked to me about some of the things, because he knows I do this

01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:32.560
show and everything, he's talked to me about some of the stuff his game has been through,

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:36.960
and he doesn't really do, as my understanding anyway, and I'll invite him on the show at

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:41.000
some point so he can speak for himself, obviously COVID is the thing right now, we could get

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:46.440
him virtually, but I'd rather have him here in studio at some point, but he might still

01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:50.000
be doing some, I mean like you said, Chuck's Challenge and stuff, he does a lot of stuff

01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:56.960
that's really cool with lights, and so he's created stuff for Ingress where, you know

01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:00.440
that tunnel in San Jose that changes from green to blue depending on what team owns

01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:01.560
it in Ingress?

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:07.680
He had something to do with that, and he made a cool little light-up portal that travels

01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:10.280
to different events and stuff, so it's pretty cool.

01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:16.920
He's a very talented guy, and one of the legendary game makers from back in the day that many

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:22.120
of today's games were built on, so it's just like, it's my one little like, oh that guy,

01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:29.120
I know that guy, so cool, well congrats to him and all the attention this game is getting,

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:34.600
like you said, many people in the Windows 3.1 era grew up on this game and know this

01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:36.480
game very well.

01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:42.560
Yeah, so pretty cool, and then to go along with that, there's some more games coming

01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:49.360
to PC, some classic Metal Gear games are coming to good ol' games, and this is part of the

01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:55.120
Konami Collector series, so they're gonna have actually three Metal Gear games, so Metal

01:40:55.120 --> 01:41:02.120
Gear, Metal Gear Solid, and Metal Gear Solid 2 are all gonna be available on PC, so not

01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:09.840
bad, and of course, you know, I'd have to check out to see what they've done with those

01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:14.840
and see how those ports are, but yeah, pretty cool.

01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:20.480
I might have to check it out, like the fact that it's the MSX version of the game, which

01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:26.320
they already had done for like a PlayStation, yeah, for a previous collection on PlayStation,

01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:31.360
but the fact that that's coming out on PC, that's awesome. Now the Contra port, that

01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:34.720
was all on Game Pass, the Contra stuff, and that was all on Game Pass back in the day,

01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:38.800
and they're okay, but like the Metal Gear thing is the most exciting out of that bunch

01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:39.800
for sure.

01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:40.800
Yeah.

01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:46.560
Yeah. All right. Moving on and talking about some other quick news here, news out of Tokyo

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:52.360
Game Show with Nier Replicant, which is like a redoing of the first game, which was just

01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:58.680
called Nier here in the US, but this is kind of like that extra version that changes the

01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:04.240
character to ones that we kind of know more from Nier Automata, but anyway, Nier Replicant

01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:10.800
is going to be launching all over the world on April 23rd, 2021. I'm sorry, North America

01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:18.360
and Europe is the launch days for that, April 23rd, 2021. PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC

01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:25.280
via Steam. The full title of the game is Nier Replicant version 1.22474487139. I don't know

01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:30.120
what the full title means, but there you go. It is of course the alternate edition of the

01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:34.120
original 2010 Nier. So that's pretty cool. I'll have to check that out because I love

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.040
Nier Automata. I need to finish it still. I know there's going to be, I'm going to get

01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:42.760
an email. Did you ever finish Nier Automata? Isn't it great? And I'm like, oh, I got distracted

01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:48.080
by other games. Sorry. Happens all the time. All right. And then we have news about Mortal

01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:53.600
Combat 11. Apparently some data mining has showed that there is alternate voice acting

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:59.400
in the game and get this, it's from the nineties movies actors. Now we all know that Shang

01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:04.600
Soon, they already did that, right? But apparently this new dialogue that was data mined out

01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:09.120
of the game is Christopher Lambert is in it. That's awesome. Who played Raiden in the movie?

01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:15.200
Remember that? Was it actually just like clips from the movie or was it new recordings? And

01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:20.840
Linda Ashby, who played Johnny Cage and Bridgette Wilson, who's now Bridgette Wilson Sampras,

01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:26.960
who played Sonia is also there. So I don't know if that's going to be DLC or what, but

01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:33.800
we can say the YouTube that had all the clips got taken down. So by Warner Brothers. So

01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:39.940
where there's smoke, there's Scorpion. So we'll see what comes to that. Honestly, if

01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:45.440
I get to replace Ronda Rousey in Mortal Combat 11, I think that's a great thing. So that's

01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:49.960
cool that they got Bridgette Wilson to do that. So, and you know what? Yeah. As cheese

01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:56.180
balls, that nineties movie is like, I think it just means a lot to a certain generation,

01:43:56.300 --> 01:43:59.700
like a lot of us grew up with that. And so it's really cool to have those actors and actresses

01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:04.340
back. Maybe it'd be like the 25th anniversary or something. I was just trying to see when the

01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:08.580
movie came out, but this is back in August. So I thought maybe they would do something,

01:44:08.580 --> 01:44:12.100
you know, Halloween's right around the corner. Maybe they're going to do something with that.

01:44:12.100 --> 01:44:17.500
Maybe they'll find some way to charge us more for it. All right, let's travel around the world and

01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:22.900
check out some game releases coming out soon with some world release dates. Loki, what's coming out

01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:30.020
in the US this week? So this week we've got Genshin Impact on PC, PlayStation 4, iOS, and Android.

01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:38.500
Hanser Dragoon remake on PlayStation 4. Return one-way trip on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,

01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:47.580
and Xbox One. Spelunky 2 is coming on PC this week. Umahara Kawase Bazuka on Nintendo Switch

01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:54.940
and PlayStation 4. Warsaw on PlayStation 4. And I think maybe Shantae is also coming out this

01:44:54.940 --> 01:45:01.100
week as well on Nintendo Switch. Super Mario Brothers 35 is coming out this week on the Switch.

01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:08.220
We've also got Warsaw on the Switch as well. Crash Bandicoot 4, it's about time,

01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:15.420
on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. And Star Wars Squadrons on the PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:45:15.420 --> 01:45:20.060
I didn't realize that was that soon. Yeah, I didn't realize it was November. Yeah, I didn't

01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:25.020
realize it was that soon either. All right, let's travel to Japan and check out some releases out

01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:32.700
there this week. So this week we have a few things. We have, um, sorry I got thrown off

01:45:32.700 --> 01:45:38.620
because there's some releases showing on September 30th, but it's all hardware. So I think the game

01:45:38.620 --> 01:45:43.660
releases, it doesn't look like we actually have any on Nintendo Switch this week. Okay, we do have

01:45:43.660 --> 01:45:48.860
some on PlayStation 4. We have Star Wars Squadron is also out in Japan this week and Crash Bandicoot

01:45:48.860 --> 01:45:56.300
4 is out in Japan also on October 2nd. And Ys Origin also has a release this week on the

01:45:56.300 --> 01:46:02.380
PlayStation 4 this week. So a fairly quiet week in Japan, although all of those titles are pretty big

01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:07.900
deals. So I guess it's not that quiet. Dark Sakura is not here to cover the UK tonight,

01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:15.260
but possibly Loki can get us those dates in her absence. Yep, so we also have Untitled Goose Game

01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:21.100
coming out on PlayStation 4 and Switch. I believe that's the physical version of that. Let's Sing

01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:29.660
Queen coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Switch. Human Fall Flat on PlayStation 4, Xbox One

01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:36.780
and Switch. That's the anniversary edition. Crash Bandicoot 4 It's About Time on PlayStation 4 and

01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:44.620
Xbox One. Star Wars Squadrons on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Warborn on PlayStation 4

01:46:44.620 --> 01:46:54.380
and on the Switch. And then we've got also Distrust Collector's Edition on Nintendo Switch.

01:46:55.180 --> 01:47:03.180
And that's it. All right, let's get into some more news then before we get to the listener

01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:11.100
roundtable tonight. So Loki. Yes, so Sega is looking to make Yakuza into a movie.

01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:17.100
So that sounds pretty awesome. Apparently they're working to develop an adaptation with

01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:25.340
1212 Entertainment and Wild Sheep content. And apparently they're also looking for script writers

01:47:25.340 --> 01:47:32.780
as well. So very early into the whole process. But I think that would make a very interesting

01:47:32.780 --> 01:47:39.260
movie. My dumb ass was about to say, has Sega ever gotten into films before and then forgetting,

01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:46.540
oh, yeah, like the last major release before all this happened was the Sonic film? No, they haven't

01:47:46.540 --> 01:47:53.500
done anything. Did they ever confirm a sequel for Sonic? They had to have, right? No. Yes, they are,

01:47:53.500 --> 01:48:00.460
yeah. Got it. I haven't even dated it, but I don't remember exactly when it was. But I'm pretty sure

01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:07.500
it was probably like 2022 or something. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, dammit, the Sonic film

01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:13.420
reappears on VOG. Look, actually it's this weird dystopian thing right now because there are movie

01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:20.060
theaters out there, especially here in California that have been closed since March. So you go and

01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:25.420
you look like what posters are hanging up and it's still like Sonic. Sonic. Because that was the

01:48:25.420 --> 01:48:31.340
movie that was out when all this bullshit started happening. So there are other movies too, but

01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:38.700
it's weird. It's scheduled for April 8th, 2022 right now. But assuming they can, well, I mean,

01:48:38.700 --> 01:48:42.860
I guess movies are shooting again with COVID and all that stuff. They have guidelines. Was it

01:48:42.860 --> 01:48:50.460
Avatar 2 converted to 100% wrapped now? So that's coming out at some point. In these crazy times,

01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:53.020
they were able to finish that? Apparently.

01:48:53.020 --> 01:48:54.460
Wow. Let's see.

01:48:54.460 --> 01:48:59.820
Not many years it's going to take to CG animate everything. That's the whole problem.

01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:04.220
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, our theaters reopened here. They're only showing like three

01:49:04.220 --> 01:49:10.940
films. And they're starting to slowly open again here in California, depending on your county.

01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:15.340
Because you mentioned Loki last week. You went and saw Tenet. You had to drive up to El Dorado,

01:49:15.340 --> 01:49:19.100
which is in a different county because they have this interesting system that's like a

01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:23.420
four-tier system. So it's like, if you still have high COVID numbers, you're in the purple

01:49:23.420 --> 01:49:28.460
tier and a lot of stuff is still really stupid because it's like, oh yeah, those are like

01:49:28.460 --> 01:49:34.380
borders. No one can possibly go from one county to the other. It's dumb.

01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:39.820
As long as folks are still taking precautions, it's when people just say, oh, COVID's not real

01:49:39.820 --> 01:49:44.860
and don't bother with any precautions at all. That's when like Florida's about to do. Sorry.

01:49:44.860 --> 01:49:49.500
I don't mean to like get political, but it's science isn't political. That's all I'm going

01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:56.140
to say. And so, you know, it's kind of scary in that area. What's that where they're just like,

01:49:56.140 --> 01:50:01.420
ah, it's not just everything. Drive-ins. Drive-in theaters are like ever more

01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:09.340
popular. Yeah. Was there Rocky Horror? I was just, so I might be saying too much,

01:50:09.340 --> 01:50:13.260
but they were trying to see if we could pull off a live Rocky Horror,

01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:19.580
but they didn't, we didn't have enough notice to do it. And the social distancing makes it very

01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:24.860
hard to do Rocky live. So for this, cause they're doing it at the drive-in like next week or no,

01:50:24.860 --> 01:50:28.700
I think it was yesterday. Cause that's how they wanted to turn it around real fast.

01:50:28.700 --> 01:50:33.020
Um, but they are looking into it for October. I hope I'm not saying too much. Um, but they're

01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:37.100
looking into see if they could do the performance in October. I don't know how they would compensate

01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:40.940
for social distancing and all that though. I think they were talking about a system where

01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:47.580
instead of the characters all interacting, like each character would be in a little place on the

01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:51.900
stage and they would kind of do their emotions and acting in that place on the stage. It would

01:50:51.900 --> 01:50:57.740
be a little weird, but that's how they could do it safely or I just per guidelines. So,

01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:07.900
um, yep. All right. Anyhow, uh, let's move on and talk about Kirby fighters too.

01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:13.420
Kirby fighters too. Surprise. It just came out and I don't know if Nintendo was kind of forced

01:51:13.420 --> 01:51:17.740
to do it because they kind of spilled it themselves. Uh, it leaked on one of their well

01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:22.860
leaked, but it showed up on one of their websites as like a game basically. And so Nintendo confirmed

01:51:22.860 --> 01:51:28.060
it. So they confirmed in a tweet, a brand new Kirby game is available now. Kirby fighters two

01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:35.100
is $20. It's a Kirby versus Kirby versus Kirby game. It's, it's kind of like smash brothers,

01:51:35.660 --> 01:51:40.860
light sorta. I'm really oversimplifying it, but what would you expect a game like Kirby

01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:44.860
fighters to be when Kirby is a character in smash brothers? Um, but that is something you can check

01:51:44.860 --> 01:51:49.740
out and there's all sorts of, uh, different Kirby hat fighters and DDD and all that good stuff.

01:51:49.740 --> 01:51:54.220
I have not played the game myself yet. I'd have to ask at depth how it is. Um, but, uh,

01:51:54.220 --> 01:51:59.820
if you're wondering where was Kirby fighters one, it was part of Kirby triple deluxe, which was,

01:52:00.140 --> 01:52:06.540
uh, a 3ds game they put out in 2014. Um, and then I believe they put a standalone version of that

01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:13.820
out on switch. Not that long ago. Um, maybe about a year ago, uh, times feels kind of frozen right

01:52:13.820 --> 01:52:17.500
now, uh, ever since March, but I think it was probably a little over a year ago that

01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:24.060
Kirby fighter game was out on the switch. So, um, and active says, no, I haven't gotten it yet.

01:52:24.700 --> 01:52:34.220
Shock. Wow. All right. Anyway, uh, let's move on. All right. Loki. Uh, so

01:52:35.420 --> 01:52:43.900
Nintendo has, uh, sent a DMCA notice against peaches untold tales. Now you may have not

01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:50.940
heard of this game. It is a triple X parody game featuring princess peach and doing I'm, I'm sure

01:52:50.940 --> 01:52:57.340
completely wholesome things. Uh, but so they have basically taken it down off of GitHub.

01:52:57.340 --> 01:53:01.580
Of course, it's the internet and being that it's been on the internet for several years already

01:53:01.580 --> 01:53:06.460
before they, I don't even know why they just took it down now, but I'm sure you can find it out

01:53:06.460 --> 01:53:11.580
there. And it's just, it's all the things you would think it would possibly be. It's something

01:53:11.580 --> 01:53:19.980
only the internet could have done. Yes. Yes it is. It's really stupid. It is weird though that

01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:24.460
it existed for so long. And then just now Nintendo is getting around to taking it down.

01:53:24.460 --> 01:53:28.860
Although couldn't you argue that some of it is parody, but I guess the whole thing is parody,

01:53:28.860 --> 01:53:33.020
but they're saying that it's a little too close to home. Maybe they're saying that it's too similar.

01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:39.340
It copyrights that fringes on copyrights from a super Mario maker to Mario parts of Mario Galaxy

01:53:39.340 --> 01:53:47.020
and smash brothers. I, I guess like probably because it's saying it's like Mario and princess

01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:51.900
peach and stuff like that. Maybe they're saying that it's that's, what's the problem. If they

01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:57.900
were just like, it's mushroom princess and, you know, they just changed the name, Italian plumber.

01:53:58.700 --> 01:54:02.700
Yeah. Kind of like how they do like green Mario green, green Mario.

01:54:05.820 --> 01:54:11.820
So, uh, yeah. All right. It's been taken down. So obviously you can't find it on the internet.

01:54:11.820 --> 01:54:16.300
Yeah. You know what though? It's fine. Unlike a lot of the types of stories we talk about with

01:54:16.300 --> 01:54:21.900
that. I, I have zero interest in this garbage, whatever. I'm just surprised that, yeah, it

01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:26.780
didn't, it didn't get away. Cause like, you know, you have pornos that come out that are like

01:54:26.780 --> 01:54:31.180
parodies of, uh, like the Lord of the cock ring or whatever, you know, that you get like, I don't

01:54:31.180 --> 01:54:36.460
even know if that's a real thing. I assume it is. Uh, you get these parodies of, of TVs and movies

01:54:36.460 --> 01:54:41.020
all the time and porn. So it seems logical that it would happen in video games as well, but yeah,

01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:46.460
probably usually when they do the parodies of porn, they change all the names. Right.

01:54:47.340 --> 01:54:50.940
Um, even when it's real people, uh, like I remember, um,

01:54:52.780 --> 01:54:58.700
there was, um, what was it? Nail and Palin. You remember when, when Sarah Palin was everywhere,

01:54:58.700 --> 01:55:03.580
she was the VP nominee. And of course, you know, they, but they like would change the name.

01:55:04.460 --> 01:55:10.780
So it was like, you know, Susie or something. One of the stars actually looked very similar

01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:16.700
to her. So they made a ton of movies. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, my, then they usually change,

01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:22.380
but this parody, yeah. Like you said, they should have changed, uh, Mario and peach to different,

01:55:22.380 --> 01:55:27.660
you know, things, which considering there's a peach emoji that represents. All right. You know

01:55:27.660 --> 01:55:32.780
what? Nevermind. We're not going to continue this conversation. All right. Moving on. Let's,

01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:38.780
let's instead talk about something that I'm actually, I'm fucking sick of talking about

01:55:38.780 --> 01:55:45.260
this and I didn't really want to bring this up again tonight. I'm going to like one more time,

01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:50.140
but I'm not talking about this again. Of course, somebody is going to quote me on this. It's the

01:55:50.140 --> 01:55:53.900
same. That's going to come back to haunt me. I'm not talking about this again until we fucking get

01:55:53.900 --> 01:56:01.340
a confirmation on this. And it's the mass effect trilogy again, because another retailer has leaked

01:56:01.340 --> 01:56:07.740
it again. And this is a Czechoslovakian retailer. Herne Savitt. I'm probably saying that completely

01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:16.700
wrong. Sorry. Um, I bet it's more like that. Anyway. Uh, it is a, uh, October 15th release

01:56:16.700 --> 01:56:21.660
on their systems, which that is way too soon. I don't, unless it's a digital only thing,

01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:25.500
but then why would a retailer be taking orders for it? So it doesn't, it doesn't make any sense.

01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:32.620
Um, but they have cover art. Now GameStop makes up their own cover art sometimes, but it does,

01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:37.500
I mean, this is what the cover art I would expect could look like. It's just a picture of

01:56:38.620 --> 01:56:42.700
male shepherd. Uh, unfortunately for those that believe fem chef, maybe on the backside is fem

01:56:42.700 --> 01:56:46.300
chef. That would be the way to do it. Have a one shepherd on one side and one on the other. It's

01:56:46.300 --> 01:56:50.860
like when you or, uh, you could take the cover and flip it. That would be a great way to do it too.

01:56:50.860 --> 01:56:56.060
I think mass effect three really was like that. Um, but anyway, it does have cover art and, uh,

01:56:56.060 --> 01:57:01.580
it's happening now. There's this story and there was another one and I forget what blog ran it.

01:57:01.580 --> 01:57:06.220
I'm sorry, but it spilled a lot more details and it was basically like,

01:57:06.220 --> 01:57:10.780
yes, it's happening. And the reason why it's held up, they took the multiplayer out for mass

01:57:10.780 --> 01:57:13.980
effect three. They're not looking at which. So I was a little disappointed to hear that,

01:57:13.980 --> 01:57:19.340
but I get it, but they are trying to quote unquote fix mass effect one and the mass effect

01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:24.700
one development is the holdup. And they're not saying what they are fixing in that, but I could

01:57:24.700 --> 01:57:29.260
theorize as somebody who really enjoys that game, the graphics are a bit dated compared to the other

01:57:29.260 --> 01:57:33.660
two games. They probably have to catch that up. And those Mako driving sequences were horrific.

01:57:33.660 --> 01:57:38.300
So they're probably either changing that system completely or making that a little more bearable.

01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:41.820
Um, so those are some things they kind of need to fix in mass effect one

01:57:41.820 --> 01:57:45.180
to because, you know, people are going to want to play these games in order. If they pick up

01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:49.980
this collection and they're not going to get to two and three, if one, some will argue with me,

01:57:49.980 --> 01:57:54.140
I tweeted about this and I even got responses that were like, well, Rob wants the best game.

01:57:54.140 --> 01:57:58.780
And it's like, okay, look, but the game elements, I don't think are with, I don't think they're

01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:04.220
going to change combat. They might though, I guess we'll see, but I really don't think

01:58:04.220 --> 01:58:07.900
the types of changes they're making are going to ruin, you know, whatever you feel

01:58:07.900 --> 01:58:14.700
like about mass effect one. So anyway, there you go. That was the other big piece is that,

01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:19.100
you know, that we get news from the inside or whatever. However, the news is leaking because

01:58:19.100 --> 01:58:26.220
it just constantly leaks because EA won't confirm it for whatever fucking reason. But anyway,

01:58:26.620 --> 01:58:33.180
the news that multiplayer is out and a mass effect one redo of sorts is in, which is what

01:58:33.180 --> 01:58:39.900
a lot of people were probably theorizing anyway. At this point, I would guess that it's going to

01:58:39.900 --> 01:58:45.580
end up being a November 7th thing, but I, for one, am not going to talk about this shit anymore

01:58:46.140 --> 01:58:52.300
until they confirm it. I'm done. If Jamie brings it up, that's on her. She's not here. So maybe

01:58:52.300 --> 01:58:59.020
she's still got one more inner, but I'm not bringing this up anymore. All right. Anyway,

01:59:00.060 --> 01:59:02.620
that's it. You want to talk about the mass effect trilogy?

01:59:04.140 --> 01:59:08.460
I have played like a little bit of one and that's it. So.

01:59:09.340 --> 01:59:12.380
Well, what, what was it you didn't, why didn't you play more of one?

01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:18.860
I don't know. I just didn't like it because my, my coworker loaned it to me and I was like,

01:59:18.860 --> 01:59:23.100
oh yeah, I'll totally check it out. Cause it sounded really cool. I just, I didn't like it.

01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:27.420
I don't know. I didn't quite get into it. Well, and maybe some of these changes will be a good

01:59:27.420 --> 01:59:30.220
thing for you. And I'm going to open up the listener round table. If you guys have some

01:59:30.220 --> 01:59:33.420
questions in chat or something you want to talk about, go ahead and ask away in chat.

01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:42.060
Phoenix 7726. Sorry guys. Phoenix 7726 in chat says two had the best story. Three had the best

01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:47.580
combat. One was still solid. In my opinion, I'm not saying one is a bad game by any means. It's

01:59:47.580 --> 01:59:53.260
just one is not at the same level, like graphically and engine wise that two and three were at.

01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:57.980
And so I do think there is a disconnect, but I, I, if there's one thing they're not going to change

01:59:57.980 --> 02:00:04.380
in one, it's the story. They're not going to change the story. Well, let me, I'm gonna take

02:00:04.380 --> 02:00:11.820
those words back because I really loved the idea that maybe they would put back in some of the

02:00:11.820 --> 02:00:17.020
romance options they cut the first time. Like maybe they would allow Kayden to be romanceable

02:00:17.020 --> 02:00:22.780
by M Shep in the first game. And maybe, and why, why stop there? Why not maybe have some other

02:00:22.780 --> 02:00:27.740
romances that show up later on end up in the first game? I don't know what else they might have cut

02:00:27.740 --> 02:00:33.420
or things like that, but it would be kind of cool to see that stuff restored. But I am talking about

02:00:33.420 --> 02:00:38.140
additional content. I'm not talking about taking anything away or something that would fundamentally

02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:43.660
change the core of that story. So, but you know, whatever changes they make, they're not going to

02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:49.740
change the story of one. And I think that's very important. All right. We will get into last minute

02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:53.900
stories in a moment, but I have at least one round table question here coming from no one special.

02:00:54.700 --> 02:01:00.380
Who says, okay, granted, as far as I know, I'm the only one here that is a heavy GOG user,

02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:05.740
but hypothetically, if you all were as well, and given that Konami is now listing games on GOG

02:01:05.740 --> 02:01:10.060
and Sega's Panzer Dragoon is there too, is there any publishers or games that you would

02:01:10.060 --> 02:01:19.500
like to see on the service? Yes. And actually I, one reason I'm not a heavier user of GOG is that

02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:24.940
it feels like lately they're just kind of playing a lot of catch up to what, you know, Steam and

02:01:24.940 --> 02:01:33.260
everybody else in the space is doing. What made GOG interesting was GOG. And they got away from

02:01:33.260 --> 02:01:37.900
that at some point, which I, and I get it, you know, and I'm sure somebody is about to clap

02:01:37.900 --> 02:01:42.380
back and chat that, well, once they kind of exhausted all of the retro things, they could

02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:47.020
get their hands on. And so the only way they could stay competitive was to be more like Steam. Well,

02:01:47.020 --> 02:01:52.220
my response to that is okay, but this is the first time that GOG has done something that's really

02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:57.500
made me turn my head in quite some time is that story we just talked about earlier tonight,

02:01:57.500 --> 02:02:03.820
that now Konami is putting out the MSX version of Metal Gear, the superior version of Metal Gear

02:02:03.820 --> 02:02:09.420
that most people here in the US never played because the NES version, although it's not bad,

02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:15.980
especially when it's all you ever knew, it is subpar compared to the MSX version. So the fact

02:02:15.980 --> 02:02:22.060
that GOG has dug that up, I mean, yes, it was from the Metal Gear Solid 3 PlayStation thing, whatever

02:02:22.060 --> 02:02:25.580
they did out there, but the fact that they've brought that to PC and brought that to the

02:02:25.580 --> 02:02:30.860
forefront, here's a way to get it now today without having to find a game that was on sale

02:02:30.860 --> 02:02:36.220
10 years ago and all that stuff, that is very interesting and something I will probably return

02:02:36.220 --> 02:02:42.300
to GOG to look at. So that's my answer, my very long-winded answer to your question, Owen Special,

02:02:42.300 --> 02:02:51.260
is that what makes GOG interesting is GOG. It's in the name and there are plenty of older games

02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:56.940
they could still go back and try to get on their service. And it's nice to see that with this

02:02:56.940 --> 02:03:01.500
Konami thing, they haven't necessarily stopped that. Now, I don't know who initiated that

02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:07.740
conversation. Was it Konami? Was it GOG? I don't know, but this is a good direction. More, please.

02:03:08.940 --> 02:03:11.660
So that's my answer to that. What about you, Loki?

02:03:12.380 --> 02:03:15.820
I didn't use them much other than some of the free games that I've gotten from them.

02:03:16.700 --> 02:03:20.940
I know that they have that cool launcher that came out a while back that's supposed to bring your

02:03:20.940 --> 02:03:28.620
Epic Game Store and Steam library all together. But I don't know, it's just fine just loading each

02:03:28.620 --> 02:03:35.020
of those up separately. So I don't really need it. But yeah, I don't know. There's not really

02:03:35.020 --> 02:03:42.140
anything drawing to them more than the other platforms. Maybe they have humble

02:03:42.140 --> 02:03:45.420
bottles or something with their keys in there or something. I don't know.

02:03:46.380 --> 02:03:51.820
No One Special follows up and says, for me, what draws me to that site is that the games are DRM

02:03:51.820 --> 02:03:56.780
free. I have the peace of mind that if GOG goes away, if I downloaded the installers, I won't lose

02:03:56.780 --> 02:04:01.500
my game. There's no guarantee that Valve would hit the turn off the DRM button if they go out of

02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:08.060
business. I think it's in the terms that you accept, actually. I think legally Valve has to hit that

02:04:08.060 --> 02:04:13.020
button. But let's say, I'm going to humor your argument here, let's say that button doesn't get

02:04:13.020 --> 02:04:18.940
hit for whatever reason. Publishers could still find a way to turn it off for you.

02:04:18.940 --> 02:04:23.260
Not that everybody would do it, but a bunch would. But I get it. I'm not trying to like

02:04:24.220 --> 02:04:28.700
debate your point, really, because you like what you like. And that's,

02:04:29.260 --> 02:04:34.140
go, go, go ahead. Like it's good. The competition in the space is a good thing. And if that's where

02:04:34.140 --> 02:04:39.580
you like to shop, excellent. Like I like to shop at Target. I really don't like going to Walmart.

02:04:39.580 --> 02:04:45.340
There's people that feel the exact opposite that I do. Choice is cool. And it's fine. There's not

02:04:45.340 --> 02:04:49.740
necessarily a right or a wrong answer. It kind of just depends on how you were treated or whatever

02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:55.420
at one place versus another. But yeah, GOG will continue to grab my attention when they release

02:04:55.420 --> 02:05:02.540
really cool older games. Like that Myst VR thing. Did that ever come up on the show? I don't remember

02:05:02.540 --> 02:05:05.820
if we talked about that last week or the week before. Yeah, I think we brought it up last week

02:05:05.820 --> 02:05:11.340
that it was coming out. It's kind of a neat little thing. Now, what about Uru Myst Online?

02:05:11.340 --> 02:05:18.700
Did that ever come back somewhere? Did they ever get that running again? I don't know. But was it

02:05:18.700 --> 02:05:25.180
Minecraft VR came out this week as well. Oh yeah. I need to hook up my headset and get that going

02:05:25.180 --> 02:05:32.220
again. Yeah, so that was cool. Yeah. ActDeft in chat with another Roundtable question here

02:05:32.220 --> 02:05:39.260
who asks, with more games adopting cross-play, which game that right now doesn't have it,

02:05:39.260 --> 02:05:46.140
would you like to see adopted? Oh, I don't think there's a lot of games I play a ton of.

02:05:49.180 --> 02:05:56.860
I'm stuck because the games I play the most right now, this week, Final Fantasy and No Man's Sky,

02:05:56.860 --> 02:06:03.100
both already have it. I'm trying to think of something that would be really cool.

02:06:05.980 --> 02:06:08.940
I don't know, Loki. I'm stumped. Is there something for you? What about you guys?

02:06:09.740 --> 02:06:12.220
I don't play a lot of multiplayer games, so I can't really think of anything.

02:06:13.260 --> 02:06:19.580
Bobby has a good answer. Fall Guys. I forget that that doesn't have it. That's a very good answer.

02:06:19.580 --> 02:06:25.660
I'm going to copy and steal that answer. Fall Guys is a good one for that. I keep forgetting

02:06:25.660 --> 02:06:31.260
it doesn't have that. I'm also waiting for Fall Guys on the Switch. It seems like the definitive

02:06:31.260 --> 02:06:37.020
thing Nintendo needs to have on that system. Well, that was part of that leak, or leaked,

02:06:37.020 --> 02:06:44.620
if you will, directing this. A bunch of fan wank, but yeah, I don't know. My uncle said,

02:06:45.580 --> 02:06:52.540
Overwatch is a good one too. Oh, Diablo III on the Blizzard front. I'd love to see Diablo III.

02:06:52.540 --> 02:06:59.740
I hope Diablo IV is cross-play. Diablo III is sunsetting at this point as Diablo IV is getting

02:06:59.740 --> 02:07:08.060
more and more. You had me there, no one special 77 with the SNL fighters until it was a typo.

02:07:08.060 --> 02:07:14.940
That would be an interesting fighting game. The fighting games. I thought some of the fighting

02:07:14.940 --> 02:07:20.380
games were cross-play. I guess not Street Fighter though. I thought Mortal Kombat did have some

02:07:20.380 --> 02:07:24.220
cross-play in it. I guess I could be wrong. Orange Riot with a very good comment here.

02:07:24.220 --> 02:07:29.660
If a leak gives you everything you wanted, it's probably fake. That's very, very good advice.

02:07:29.660 --> 02:07:33.660
And that was probably the thing I read in there where it was like, Fall Guys today on the Switch,

02:07:33.660 --> 02:07:39.740
where I was like, nah, it's fake. Come on. Okay, active says Street Fighter is cross-play between

02:07:39.740 --> 02:07:48.220
PC and PS4. And it's, I think, still free for a few more days on PlayStation Plus. I did check

02:07:48.220 --> 02:07:51.100
that out. I downloaded it. I don't think I brought it up during my gaming week because

02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:55.100
I didn't play it a lot. And this is more last week than this week, but that is something that

02:07:55.100 --> 02:07:59.500
you can get on PlayStation Plus right now. All right, how about some last minute stories,

02:07:59.500 --> 02:08:03.500
Loki? Let's see if we get any other last questions in chat. But for now, some last minute stories.

02:08:04.860 --> 02:08:07.900
So we're going to probably have a little bit more about this next week, but Minecraft Live

02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:16.460
is on Saturday and they're doing their vote for the new mob for the game. So I'm a little

02:08:16.540 --> 02:08:22.380
disappointed at what they've shown off so far. So two of the mobs that they're putting up for

02:08:22.380 --> 02:08:28.060
vote are already mobs there in Minecraft Earth, which, and they're kind of lame anyways. So the

02:08:28.060 --> 02:08:33.020
Moobloom, which is basically a cross between, it's like a mushroom, but with flowers instead

02:08:33.020 --> 02:08:39.340
of mushrooms. And then they have a Glow Squid, which is a squid, but it glows. And then the

02:08:40.060 --> 02:08:46.620
Ice Oliger, which is a new villager type mob, but they just added a bunch of those in like

02:08:46.620 --> 02:08:53.660
that village and pillage one. It's not as cool as like the Phantoms. I don't know if the Phantom

02:08:53.660 --> 02:08:58.460
was really cool, but like I was hoping they'd be better stuff. They should just add all of them.

02:08:58.460 --> 02:09:05.900
Like seriously, I had a mod in my realm already that added the Moobloom and the Glow Squid. I

02:09:05.900 --> 02:09:09.980
don't know. It's not that hard to implement that stuff. I don't know why they don't just do all

02:09:09.980 --> 02:09:17.740
three, but whatever. Maybe something to add content for some time. People excited about

02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:23.020
stuff. So it's, but they're going to do, it's basically in place of the whole Minecon thing

02:09:23.020 --> 02:09:28.940
since obviously COVID. But so you're going to do the Minecraft live, which I believe is on,

02:09:28.940 --> 02:09:36.060
I know it's Saturday at 9 AM Pacific and whatever that translates to for everybody else.

02:09:37.340 --> 02:09:41.020
So I will watch all that and it's going to have like details about Minecraft Earth,

02:09:41.020 --> 02:09:45.340
their Minecraft Dungeons, which I still haven't played even though I have it.

02:09:46.140 --> 02:09:49.260
And then of course Minecraft proper. So we'll see.

02:09:50.140 --> 02:09:52.380
All right. Anything else for last minute stories?

02:09:55.100 --> 02:09:56.620
No, I think that's it.

02:09:56.620 --> 02:10:00.300
All right. And I don't think I see any other questions in our chat. So I think we'll go

02:10:00.300 --> 02:10:04.460
ahead and wrap up for tonight. I know it's a little bit earlier, but we're down a host

02:10:04.460 --> 02:10:09.500
tonight and yeah. So it's just a little bit of a shorter show sometimes. Actually, no,

02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:13.260
you're still over two hours, about two hours, 15 minutes. So still pretty good, pretty good

02:10:13.260 --> 02:10:17.500
chunk of show. Because there was some busy, busy things this week with the whole Microsoft

02:10:17.500 --> 02:10:22.620
big purchase there of ZeniMax as well as the Tokyo Game Show. Although I don't think Tokyo Game Show

02:10:22.620 --> 02:10:29.340
was quite as news heavy as it was in previous years. And I think a lot of that is because

02:10:29.340 --> 02:10:33.500
Sony just did that thing two weeks ago where they kind of put all their cards on the table.

02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:38.380
I don't think Sony did Tokyo Game Show this year. Nintendo never does Tokyo Game Show,

02:10:38.380 --> 02:10:43.980
but I feel like a lot of the big announcements were in Sony's PS5 event because that's not

02:10:43.980 --> 02:10:47.980
usually the type of thing that would have been this close to Tokyo Game Show. That is the stuff

02:10:47.980 --> 02:10:52.540
we should have got during E3 using my Cody fingers. But of course, COVID fucked everything

02:10:52.540 --> 02:10:57.420
up. So it screwed up timeline. So I think it just made the Tokyo Game Show feel a little lighter

02:10:57.420 --> 02:11:01.900
this year than it usually is. And just the whole situation of it being virtual and everything.

02:11:03.820 --> 02:11:08.140
Yeah. So it was basically, I'm just kind of looking at a lot of it is stuff that was covered

02:11:08.140 --> 02:11:11.900
in the directs that we've seen from Nintendo and like some of the other things. So they had,

02:11:13.340 --> 02:11:17.260
it was pretty much just like a few of the Japanese games that were mentioned in the

02:11:17.260 --> 02:11:23.100
directs. So like the new Hyrule Warriors game, they've got the new Monster Hunter,

02:11:24.140 --> 02:11:27.740
new Replicant. They talked about that a little bit. Dynasty Warriors, Nine Empires,

02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:33.180
Battle in Wonderland, Cyberpunk. They have that new video that wasn't quite related to

02:11:33.180 --> 02:11:37.180
Tokyo Game Show, but that was also there. Resident Evil Village,

02:11:40.460 --> 02:11:46.780
just The Devil May Cry 5, Biohazard, Infinite Darkness, which is a new series coming to Netflix.

02:11:48.140 --> 02:11:52.780
Yeah. That's cool. Yeah. It's just a lot of follow-ups on things we already knew about,

02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:55.900
which is still cool. And especially, you know, if you're following those games, but it was just

02:11:55.900 --> 02:12:01.420
wasn't like a lot of like new, new information. So, but that's okay. You know, again, it's been

02:12:01.420 --> 02:12:07.660
a weird news cycle this year. Everything's been weird this year. So, all right. Well, that is

02:12:07.660 --> 02:12:10.940
about going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. I want to thank you guys for

02:12:10.940 --> 02:12:15.180
spending time with us this week, whether you're here with us live on Sunday night, as we tape

02:12:15.180 --> 02:12:20.620
here at VOG Network, or if you were listening on the podcast feed, we really appreciate it.

02:12:20.620 --> 02:12:24.860
A nice five-star review of this show on iTunes or wherever it is that you found this show goes

02:12:24.860 --> 02:12:28.780
an awful long way. If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or

02:12:28.780 --> 02:12:32.380
two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has

02:12:32.380 --> 02:12:36.540
a voice. But if the voices aren't here to put out on the air, then, you know, we're not really

02:12:36.540 --> 02:12:42.540
getting all the voices. So, yeah. Help us tell a friend. Tweet about the show is a great thing.

02:12:42.620 --> 02:12:47.820
Auto-hosting on Twitch is awesome. Even if you don't do a lot of streaming yourself,

02:12:47.820 --> 02:12:53.660
still throwing a VOG Network. That auto-host does a lot for exposure. We really, really appreciate

02:12:53.660 --> 02:12:58.060
people that go the extra mile and do that. I also wanted to say, if you want to continue

02:12:58.060 --> 02:13:01.820
the conversation during the week, a lot of the chatter in Discord has been picking up lately,

02:13:01.820 --> 02:13:06.140
and that's great. So, you can join us on Discord, vognetwork.com. That's vognetwork.com

02:13:06.780 --> 02:13:12.780
Discord, where you can follow some conversations for ourselves here at Orange Lounge Radio,

02:13:13.500 --> 02:13:19.900
Bobby Blackwolf, Anime Jam Session, other great shows on VOG as well. British Invaders,

02:13:19.900 --> 02:13:23.420
I know, put out a couple big episodes recently about some big 50th anniversaries that are

02:13:23.420 --> 02:13:29.180
happening. And yeah, lots of great stuff. So, check that out. And then, of course,

02:13:29.180 --> 02:13:33.100
the VOG Roundtables and all that info is there as well. And folks, chat about some of the…

02:13:33.100 --> 02:13:37.420
We get a lot of headlines posted in Discord during the week that sometimes we do take

02:13:37.420 --> 02:13:41.340
those and use them on the show and talk about those conversations. So, thanks to all you that

02:13:41.340 --> 02:13:47.100
are participating over there. That's going to do it. I hope you guys have a great week, some happy

02:13:47.100 --> 02:13:51.260
gaming. I know I'm probably going to play way too much more No Man's Sky and Hades and all

02:13:51.260 --> 02:13:56.460
that stuff, but I'll try to fit in some new games too. Loki, hopefully you have a productive week

02:13:56.460 --> 02:13:59.980
working on your game or playing some U.S., whatever you choose to do.

02:13:59.980 --> 02:14:06.780
I'm still waiting. My music guy is having time management issues.

02:14:08.060 --> 02:14:09.420
All right, that's fine.

02:14:09.420 --> 02:14:18.300
So, thankfully, I have a backup music guy that's doing it for free. So, I'll have more music from

02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:24.940
them. But like, yeah, I've already given him crap about that because he's like seven days past due.

02:14:25.580 --> 02:14:31.980
Oh, all right. All right. Well, thanks again, everybody. We'll see you in seven days to do

02:14:31.980 --> 02:14:37.020
this show all over again. Have a great week, everybody. We'll see you next time on Orange

02:14:37.020 --> 02:14:41.660
Lounge Radio. Dark Sakura will be back next week and we'll get caught up with her and it will be

02:14:41.660 --> 02:14:46.380
October. It'll be spooky season officially. Have a great week, everybody. We'll see you next time.

02:14:46.380 --> 02:14:46.780
Good night.

02:14:47.660 --> 02:14:50.300
