00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Link cables, IR blasts, and finally good ol' Wi-Fi, I consider the Nintendo 3DS to be the most social portable we've ever seen almost exclusively due to the existence of SpotPass and StreetPass. Conventions quickly went from a wireless clusterfuck of data exchange to a wireless wasteland devoid of 3D life. I truly do miss it. 3DS, we hardly knew ye.

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Stay tuned for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki, their thoughts on the sunsetting Nintendo handhelds, and plenty more gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio back again live tonight with episode number 836 of our show for this September 20th of 2020.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That's a lot of 20s. My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined via Discord as much as we love to tape all in the same room. 2020 has made that not possible but thanks to technology I'm able to connect with my co-hosts at a social distance. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

5
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm throwing up the horns. Yeah, I love your look tonight. Now I know the podcastees can't see it but the folks on Twitch can kind of see you're rocking kind of a little bit of a gothic look tonight.

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:40,000
A little bit for old school goth. A little bit of Halloween Daria tonight. Halloween my ass, I just wear this anyway. Halloween is every day when you're a cosplayer.

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Well, this isn't... I just, you know, this is kind of how I feel right now. I feel like I'm in a really dark place so why shouldn't my outside show how I'm feeling inside?

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah, it's been a decade this weekend, hasn't it? Oh boy. Anyway.

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Well, and I mean, there's the other news that I shared. I mean, we all know that Ruth Bader Ginsburg died and there's a big hole in our democracy that she's left.

10
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I've unfriended a few people, by the way, who have, you know, just shat on her memory. But we also lost Nobiko, the long cat.

11
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Right. You messaged me that before the show. That's sad. 18 years old.

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You know, some of those internet meme cats are kind of passed away some time ago, like Keyboard Cat is the one that comes to mind, right? Because that was an old clip from the 80s.

13
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yeah. But there had been a big like series of posts that, you know, yeah, the cat's still alive. His name is Nobiko and he lives in Japan and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

14
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And then his owner said, no, Nobiko passed away of respiratory failure.

15
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That's tragic. 18 is a good run. Shirmi made it to 16. Cats should live longer than people.

16
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't think longer. I think that they should have just a human lifespan. Yes. Agree. All right. Well, introducing our other co-host who's living a nice, full life and will continue to for some time, I'm sure. Say hello to Loki.

17
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Not if I keep eating all this ramen.

18
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If we have to keep eating the way we have been in quarantine, who knows? I was trying to shove it down before the show started. So you're going to be well preserved because of all the preservatives.

19
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's it. You're mummifying yourself. What is the game running behind you tonight?

20
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's one of the games that should have been included on one of these All-Stars. It's WarioWare Shake It, one of the best platform games that nobody remembers anymore.

21
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It was a hand-drawn, animated platformer game by Nintendo. And I really wish they would do a traditional Mario game in that style, but they didn't. They left it to Wario instead.

22
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah, I'm with you. I would have been more jazzed about like another Super Mario 2D collection than maybe the 3D All-Stars. I mean, I get that a lot of people are really enjoying 3D All-Stars.

23
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I personally did not pick it up. I've gone into the reasons before and I'm not here to like shit on Nintendo fans. It's not my thing. I just, if I want to go play Mario 3D, I have my 3DS, which is a great system.

24
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And even if Nintendo is going to discontinue them, spoiler alert, they can't come into my house and take my 3DS away with my copy of Mario 64 on it. So there is that and the other things I've talked about on previous episodes.

25
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Well, I just wish that they would have done more with this collection than they did because it literally is just, it's all emulated.

26
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And even like the one that has kind of the most done to it, which is Mario Galaxy, is really just the version that was out in, was it China, on the Nvidia Shield because remember they had it over there.

27
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Since technically a Switch is sort of an Nvidia Shield, you know, hardware wise, that's what they ported over. I mean, that's exactly the same thing. It's same kind of resolution they were doing and stuff.

28
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But like, just even on PC with the folks, you know, decompiling the original Mario 64, and I know we'll have more stories kind of tied with that later.

29
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:26,000
There's been so much more that they've done with it than just this. Like just, oh, look, we re-released an emulator. Enjoy. It's like, okay.

30
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I would have been, I would have been like so jazzed about the 3D collection if they tried to do something. You're right, like the things that people have done with Mario 64, like when they turned it into all that, like the massively multiplayer Mario 64.

31
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm not saying Nintendo has to like copy it, but it does kind of show that like you can kind of go back and reinvent old games. And that's maybe why I loved the first All-Stars collection on Super Nintendo so, so much.

32
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It really truly is one of the greatest releases ever because it didn't just port the games, it reimagined them. And that's what made it so amazing.

33
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Exactly. Yeah, exactly. It wasn't just a re-release. It was a remaster of those games. And these are, it literally is the old games running in an emulator and then they're hacking stuff in there with some slightly better textures for like the HUD and stuff.

34
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And some more anti-aliasing or actually in some cases, removing the anti-aliasing in the case of Mario 64. It's just, it's very minimal. It's hardly worthy of an All-Stars collection, especially without Mario Galaxy 2. That's just silly.

35
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah. And I get, I'm really not here to kick it when it's down. And if those of you, I know many of you out there, especially if I'm watching my Twitter and social media feed are playing 3D All-Stars and enjoying it and that's cool.

36
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And you know, also I think my age might be showing a little bit because I think there's lots of gamers out there who might be like in their early 20s or mid 20s who didn't really get to play Sunshine or didn't really get to play Mario 64 either when those games were new or ever.

37
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So the fact that people are experiencing those games for the first time, I think that's awesome. So that's cool.

38
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yeah. I never played Sunshine and Galaxy. I played like up through the first few levels and that was it. Mario 64, I played pretty much all the way through, but the other two, like I haven't touched. So it is kind of nice to do that. And my kids are having fun with it. I haven't gotten a chance to play it yet, but they have. So you're enjoying them.

39
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:41,000
All right. Well, yeah. And those 3D games, I think they just keep getting better and better. And honestly, like if you don't already own Mario Odyssey, in my opinion, get that before you play. Because I honestly think Odyssey is the best 3D Mario's ever been. It's a hell of a lot of fun.

40
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But I am probably going to pick up, even though the price tag is a little high, I will probably end up picking up the 3D, I can't even remember the exact way they titled it, Super Mario 3D Land. But it kind of plays like a 2D Mario, but it had the 3D stuff.

41
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah, it's 3D World.

42
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
3D World.

43
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's 3D World plus...

44
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'll probably still get that. I thought that was such a solid platformer. I really enjoyed that. I wouldn't mind revisiting that, even if the price tag is a little high.

45
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So, all right. Anyway, lots. We have so much news to get into tonight. We really need to stop. We'll talk about other stuff during our gaming weeks, but we got a lot to get into tonight. So let's start with the biggest news.

46
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We had a Sony event. Sony came out, they did an event, and they finally showed us. This is the price, this is the date, and this is some of the games that we're going to be putting on the PlayStation, some you've seen before, some you haven't.

47
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Loki, why don't you break this down for us a little bit, although prepare to be interrupted a lot.

48
00:08:40,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Okay, so they have a lot of trailers before the final announcement of the actual price. So kicking things off, I mean Final Fantasy XVI. That's definitely how you start one of these press events, or not even press events, one of these directs is like kick it off with a brand new Final Fantasy trailer. So it looked pretty cool.

49
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Do you think that they moved that to the front because of the leaks that had proceeded for a couple days?

50
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I think they moved it to the front because of the way that they were describing their footage. So that one in particular is a PC running, it was a game running on PC meant to look like a PlayStation 5, whereas the rest were running off of PlayStation 5 hardware.

51
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So they prefaced that trailer differently than the rest of them. So I think that's why they did it. But yeah, I mean, it looks nice. It is considered a console exclusive, but it is still coming out on PC as well. So we'll see what that necessarily means. There's some other...

52
00:09:42,000 --> 00:10:00,000
They're being a little wishy washy on the PC thing right now. I don't know if I would stay. They kind of said that, but then the trailers kind of contradict each other. So we know PlayStation 5 for sure. I think it's like PC eventually. I mean, Square has been doing that with a lot of their games, but it may not be right away.

53
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:14,000
But there's other titles though that also were coming. They were called console exclusives as well. But then they're also coming to PC and other consoles like three months later is the other thing too.

54
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Personally, I am not a fan of paid console exclusives. I didn't like it when PlayStation did it. I didn't like it when Xbox did it. I'm not a fan of that kind of thing. I think it's just ridiculous to do that.

55
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Can we talk about the trailer though? Because it was so sexy. I am dying. It was really, really good. Jamie, did you see the trailer? I'm so curious what your thoughts were on 16.

56
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It looks like 14? Kind of?

57
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Kind of, yes. In my opinion, that's a great thing.

58
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You know me, I'm just still trying to reserve judgment. I'm trying not to be excited. Does that make sense?

59
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah, no, I get it. But it is so hard for me not to buy in the hype because, and it took me a minute because I saw that logo come up for the creative team three and I was like, why does that logo look so distinctive and it came to my mind after the fact.

60
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The font is the same font used in Final Fantasy 14. I didn't connect it right away, but I connected it later. It was creative team three. And then I'm watching it and I'm like, this really has like a 14 kind of vibe to it.

61
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm not familiar with the storyline in 14. Are some of the characters the same in this one?

62
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:56,000
No, no, it's just, it's just kind of like the look of it and just kind of like the vibe you get. The combat also kind of reminded me of if you completely took the interface off of 14, and obviously you don't have multiple people on the screen but I mean some things in 14 you're doing by yourself.

63
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:12,000
The combat looked a little 14 to me. But I wouldn't, I wouldn't read too much into that. But I mean, sure enough, we found out that Naoki Yoshida, who is the producer and director of 14, is the producer of 16. Those were some early rumors out there that he was kind of shooting down.

64
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Well, I think he said, I'm not the director of 16. And he's not. He's the producer. So you know, semantics, right? But somebody else from his team that worked on Stormblood is the director of the game.

65
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And so this is going to be a single player Final Fantasy 14 inspired game. And I am like, I got chills when I made the connection. I'm like, because again, like I know not everybody has played Final Fantasy 14 because I get it. It's an MMO. It's a monthly fee.

66
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's not for everybody. But I'm telling you, the story in 14 is so good, especially when you get to the expansions, that like the fact that that is going to get realized as a single player game in Final Fantasy 16, like the bar is already set high, which is a dangerous thing.

67
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I admit, I mean, this game could be garbage and just, you know, it's unfortunate. But I, I just, I so don't want to believe that. Like, I so feel like the formula is in a really good place. And I am really excited for this game that I haven't been for a game this far out in a very long time.

68
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So now with that being said, let me just poo poo on all that.

69
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Can't wait.

70
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So, you know, another game that I was highly anticipating that also was touted as like a single player, you know, campaign, the Avengers became a live service game. What if this happens? The same thing happens to this as a live service game. I understand that they have 14, which is kind of like that, but they like all the money. So, you know,

71
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Let's see. Actually, you know what's interesting? I'm hearing mixed things on the Avengers, because I'm hearing that early demo was not very well received. But the people that have bought the full game and are playing the full game, I don't see a lot of negative reaction.

72
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I feel like a lot of people that are playing the Avengers are enjoying it. But again, I haven't played it myself, so I can't tell you what I think. But that's just the vibe I'm getting on social media.

73
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I do want that one.

74
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Gotcha. And fifth dream in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says I hate the Avengers game TBH. So there you go. One bad opinion.

75
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I hear the gameplay can be fun, like because they have it kind of broken up with like some of these linear story sections. And then they have kind of like the, you know, recycle quests type things where it's like, go here, do this type of stuff.

76
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:47,000
The story stuff is pretty good and the gameplay is pretty good, but it's like some of these quests, plus that they completely ripped off Destiny 2, like everything is a Destiny 2.

77
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:59,000
They basically just took it, put it in this game, tweaked the names of things, and that's it. I mean, it's kind of rushed, but that's why I think we're hearing mixed things on it.

78
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm going to leave it to Naoki Yoshida, who strikes me as a real fan of gaming and the genre, to make the decision that he believes is best as the producer. And I'm just going to really try to have faith. We'll see.

79
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:18,000
There is an early rumor. You know, there's a lot of memes online about, oh, here we go, another white dude protagonist in Final Fantasy 16.

80
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But, and I want to stress, this is a rumor, but it's coming from the same place that the Final Fantasy 16 is tied to the PlayStation 5 announcement came from.

81
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Rumor, rumor that 16 is going to have a character creator and it's going to be kind of like Shepard in Mass Effect.

82
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:45,000
So there will be male and female versions and everything will be voice, male and female. And there's going to be a character creator, which would be something that exists in Final Fantasy 14.

83
00:15:45,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Again, yeah, that would be awesome. And it makes a lot of sense. I think Mass Effect is a great template that shows it can be done. And the 14 team kind of doing that, they have experience writing a story like that from a you name it type of protagonist.

84
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So that would be very exciting. But I want to, you know, I again, I'm stressing rumor and I know some of you hate when I talk about rumors on this show, but I think that's one worth bringing up.

85
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:20,000
But level your expectation. Don't set that as an expectation. Anyway.

86
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And anyways, so moving on from Final Fantasy, they showed the first combat footage in gameplay of Spider-Man Miles Morales, which looks pretty awesome.

87
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Yeah, looks like the game is going to be coming to both the PlayStation 4 and 5. So it looks pretty cool.

88
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That was a little surprising, though, the fact that it's going to be 4 and 5. Everybody kind of thought this was like the big exclusive that 5 has right out the gate. And that isn't going to be the case. That was a little bit surprising.

89
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But I mean, you know, the footage you were looking at was from a 5. It's going to be as the best it possibly can be. A good game is a good game. So I guess at the end of the day, it won't matter, right?

90
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yeah. After years of rumors and leaked trailers and stuff like that, finally got the trailer announcement for Hogwarts Legacy, which is supposed to be coming to PlayStation 5.

91
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So it's supposed to take place before all of the Harry Potter stuff in the 1800s, I guess. So that looked interesting.

92
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Definitely had that epic adventure feel to it. And I think there's been a lot of people that had really wanted a game like this up until about a year ago, but we'll get into that later in the show.

93
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
A year ago? We knew about this in age before.

94
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh, I thought it was a little more recent.

95
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
No, the controversy has been going on for some time.

96
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Yikes. All right, well, we'll get into it later in the show.

97
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:01,000
They showed off some more footage of Call of Duty, Black Ops, Cold War, more Deathloop. I don't know, Deathloop looks okay, but God, I wish they would cut down on the trailers for that.

98
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Deathloop looked more like my kind of vibe, like the type of game I would play versus Call of Duty. No shade.

99
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's just like Dishonored. I mean, it's pretty much Dishonored with a time loop, which I mean, it's the same team, so it makes sense.

100
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I liked the art direction in that trailer, too. I kind of liked that film noir vibe it had going for it. I thought it was pretty cool.

101
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Yeah, it looked cool. Devil May Cry 5 is going to be getting a PlayStation 5 version.

102
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Cool.

103
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:39,000
There's a new trailer for Oddworld Soulstorm that looks kind of interesting. A new Five Nights at Freddy's game announced.

104
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
That was unexpected.

105
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yeah, definitely.

106
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Because those games have traditionally been either iPhone, Android, or desktop games. There was a Five Nights VR.

107
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yeah, but that's one of the ones, though, that is that timed exclusive type of thing. In fact, actually, in the trailer here, when they talk about the exclusives available on PC, not available on other consoles until three months later.

108
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Do you know?

109
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
That's after release date.

110
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:19,000
When that trailer first showed up, did you think it was Five Nights? Because I totally thought it was something else, and I was like, oh my gosh, this looks so good.

111
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Do you know? And then it was Five Nights at Freddy's. I was like, damn, I was hoping it was the other thing. Do you know what vibe I got from it at first?

112
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Portal?

113
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:37,000
That sprung to mind. That was my very first was, ooh, this might be Portal. But then my second thought, and I was like, oh no, it's Bioshock.

114
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:48,000
They're taking a Stranger Things vibe, like an 80's Stranger Things vibe, and gelling it with Bioshock. And I was like, oh, I'm here for this game.

115
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And then it was Five Nights at Freddy's, and I have to admit, I was a little bit like, oh.

116
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I was like, yeah, no, I'm not here for this game.

117
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,000
No, I don't want to hate on Five Nights. Look, just because I'm not a big fan of the jump scare games, I'm kind of like, oh, okay.

118
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And I was like, damn, this is what happens when you set expectations.

119
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Definitely, I did get a Bioshock vibe from it as well, because it looked like Rapture.

120
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,000
But now that's what I want from a new Bioshock game, is I'm like, Bioshock meets Stranger Things type of thing would be pretty incredible.

121
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:30,000
They have a whole lot of opportunity with the Bioshock Infinite, because remember, she kept pulling stuff through those rifts from alternate 80's dimensions and stuff like that.

122
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So there could be something cool like that, but someday we'll get a new Bioshock game. Amazing.

123
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,000
They've been kind of quiet on the Bioshock front. You feel like they're working on something, and I keep feeling like, okay, any day now we're going to see a new Bioshock.

124
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And I thought it might be this week, but that's okay.

125
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,000
They showed some more footage for Demon's Souls, which looks amazing. I mean, that's how you do a remake right there.

126
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Yeah, it did look really good.

127
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And then what I thought was going to be an announcement of like some sort of games pass type thing.

128
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:15,000
They talked a little bit about these, it's like PlayStation Plus, their collection of titles that they have, the PlayStation Plus collection.

129
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yeah, that's what it's called.

130
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And it was just a few titles that they were offering for free with the PlayStation 5 launch, if you have PlayStation Plus.

131
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Yeah.

132
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Which I got to be honest, I have most of these already. It's not a big deal.

133
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I thought for sure, oh, collection, here's games pass, it's their answer to it. It's like, disappointed.

134
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Well, it was okay. I had several thoughts about it.

135
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I was kind of like, okay, well, many of these games, PlayStation Plus, I mean, you said I have most of these games.

136
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I would bet you probably got them all through PlayStation Plus at some point.

137
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yeah, I think a lot of them I did.

138
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So it kind of sounds like they're opening the PlayStation Plus vault in some way and bringing back a lot of games you can download again as some kind of answer to game pass.

139
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm kind of like, all right, well, that's okay.

140
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But there is that very big fact that they're not charging another fee for it.

141
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It is a part of PlayStation Plus, and that's pretty big that you're not having to pay anything extra for it.

142
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So that's pretty cool.

143
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And game pass, when it first rolled out, did not have the most impressive lineup in the world.

144
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It was something they built over a couple of years that it's been around now.

145
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So it will be interesting to see how much and how regularly PlayStation adds to that.

146
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Are there going to be free PlayStation Plus games of the month anymore, or is it just going to be we're adding them into the library?

147
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Because I kind of feel like that's where it's going to go.

148
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
They're just going to add games into the library now, and it's not going to be what it was before.

149
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Because that's fine.

150
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm kind of fine with that, because if you forget to download it, you can still get it.

151
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Especially because there's no fee beyond play.

152
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So it's not like they're going to make you pay more money.

153
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It's just the logical next step on how they do it.

154
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah, I'd be curious to see what they do with that.

155
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
But that's pretty much it.

156
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
So then finally, at the very end, before we'll get to the pricing in just a sec.

157
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So at the very end they teased Ragnarok is coming, so obviously a new God of War game coming in 2021.

158
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yep.

159
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Which is fine.

160
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And then finally they said, of course they announced the pricing of the PlayStation 5.

161
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,000
They've got the price at $499 for the system with the disk drive, $399 for the digital edition.

162
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And those are both going to be coming out on November 12th in the US, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea.

163
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And then the rest of the territories on November 19th.

164
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And that's, for me, that's exactly what I was expecting.

165
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And I think what most people were expecting.

166
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Well, some I think expected an undercut to Xbox's price, but I feel like this is a different situation than last time.

167
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Microsoft made a choice and what ultimately was a bad choice from a sales perspective.

168
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Sorry, I know some of you were fans of it, but from a larger perspective, it was a bad choice to bundle connect with the system.

169
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Mandatory, basically.

170
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And so that isn't a factor this time.

171
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So I kind of expected PlayStation and Microsoft to have price parity of their high-end systems.

172
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Now, granted, every company found a way to cut the price of that somehow.

173
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
PlayStation cut the price with the digital edition.

174
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Microsoft cut it with a lower spec edition, the Series S.

175
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,000
But essentially, the Mercedes-Benz systems, the top-of-the-line ones, are the same price.

176
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
So it's going to be interesting for this gen.

177
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And here's something, though, that's also interesting.

178
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
We don't know necessarily what the prices are on the Xbox game front.

179
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:55,000
But on the PlayStation side, though, there's already a few first-party titles that are $70 retail.

180
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
So Demon's Souls and Destruction All-Stars are going to be $70.

181
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Marvel's Spider-Man and Miles Morales is going to be $50.

182
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
They're going to have an ultimate edition for $70.

183
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And Sackboy's Big Adventure is going to be $60.

184
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,000
So interesting that they're going $70 on some of those.

185
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I would be fine with that in this generation if I knew that it wasn't going to be followed up by the usual nonsense with season passes and shoving microtransactions, standard throw, loot boxes, and all this stuff.

186
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But I know it's definitely going to still be there.

187
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Yeah, I think it really depends on what they kind of do with that price.

188
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
You know, and it's interesting because we're talking about $70 game generation.

189
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
But I actually don't really think that label is true.

190
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
We're looking at the generation where we'll pay $70 for some games, for AAA games, for first-party games.

191
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
But the price of games is all over the map.

192
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:58,000
And especially now that we have digital exclusive systems, you know, some games are $9.99, some are $29.99, some are $70.

193
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It's just going to be all over the map, and it's very interesting.

194
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I think they're just testing the waters is what it is.

195
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I think that they want to be at $70, but they're waiting for the backlash from it.

196
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And if they don't get that backlash, then they're just going to go full in with that.

197
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I kind of think most of us have been expecting it for some time.

198
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I'm ready for it. It is what it is.

199
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm with the statement that you said, Loki.

200
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:26,000
If we're paying $10 to get rid of some of this nickel and diming BS we've seen over the last generation, then fine.

201
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And Bobby says, you know, AAA game budgets have balloons.

202
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Yes, but you have obviously heard from all these companies where they're making billions of dollars off of microtransactions.

203
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So I think that their games are well within their budgets.

204
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
They'd be covered by those microtransactions.

205
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And I don't think that they need to nickel and dime an initial, well, not even nickel and dime, an additional $10 on top of that.

206
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
They're making plenty of money.

207
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And trust me, all that money is not going to the development teams.

208
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It's going to the CEOs of those companies.

209
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:08,000
So I don't feel a little bit sad at them at all for, you know, not making an additional $10 off of me, to be honest, because it's not going to the people that really need it.

210
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It's going to people who make these poor decisions and end up screwing up our games because they're shoving all this microtransactions up because they're trying to appease their investors is what it is.

211
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I kind of feel like, again, it's just it's the $70.

212
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
People are going to pay it.

213
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And I think this debate, I'm not I'm not dismissing what you're saying, Loki at all, but I just kind of feel like it's it's ultimately we just need to be ready for it.

214
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It's the it's the era of the $70 game.

215
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And if you want to play a AAA game like God of War day one, you're going to pay it.

216
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
But you also know that if you don't pay it right away, games tend to go down in price.

217
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So it's it's it's so interesting because usually we can compare things to music and movies.

218
00:27:47,000 --> 00:28:00,000
But this is something somewhat unique in games, although I would say the closest thing I could think of is people who paid the $30 to have Mulan on Disney Plus.

219
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Now, reviews of that movie aside, I'm not here to debate the quality of that movie.

220
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I haven't seen it, so I don't care.

221
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
But some people paid $30 so they could have it in their house the very first day it was available.

222
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Some people are going to wait until it's free on Disney Plus.

223
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It just kind of depends on what is for your situation.

224
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And I think that's still going to be true of the $70 game, that's for sure.

225
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Some people are going to pay it because they also would be the type that would pay $30 to get Mulan day one on top of their Disney Plus fee.

226
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Right. And honestly, like, you know, let's just put it this way.

227
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Like Sony can charge $70 for their games, but that's also going to make a better argument for games pass on the Xbox side of things because they're including first party games in with that price.

228
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And honestly, if everything's going to be $70 this generation, that's looking at like a much better deal in the long run.

229
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So I don't know.

230
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It's I'm kind of disappointed that they didn't come out with something similar to kind of counteract that.

231
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I don't think PlayStation now is a good alternative for that.

232
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Also disappointed this year that apparently that this generation is not going to be backwards compatible with the PlayStation three, two or one.

233
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
It's only going to be with the PlayStation four, which is something I guess.

234
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
But it's still like, really, you can't you can't play PlayStation one games.

235
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I mean, God, my cell phone can probably emulate a PlayStation one.

236
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Just find you saying that this is brand new cutting edge system just it's just not able to do it.

237
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
It's just impossible.

238
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I will say I will say, Loki, I completely agree with you on the point that games pass and that sort of system is ultimately where I think this generation of games ends up.

239
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:48,000
You know, we might be looking at the $70 game now, but I think it is going to drive more and more people to a subscription based service.

240
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And Sony's catching up on that front.

241
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
They're not there yet, but they're laying the groundwork for it.

242
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And I think that will continue as this generation moves on.

243
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I do want to get some other comments from chat.

244
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:09,000
SSJ 100 Matt says, you know, counter take, I would much rather pay $70 for a game if the developer didn't require their staff crunch to finish the project and hire more help to finish a game.

245
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I can see that.

246
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
That comment from twitch.tv slash vog network.

247
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I do want to ask kind of like a TLDR question from all of you.

248
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I'm going to ask you guys in chat.

249
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I'm going to ask dark Sakura and Loki and my TLDR question about this whole PS five event is where was your head at before this event?

250
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Were you I'm going to get a PS five day one.

251
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm going to get a PS five eventually.

252
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I'm never getting a PS five.

253
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Where was your head out before this event?

254
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Did the event change your mind?

255
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
So that's the TLDR question I want to ask.

256
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Dark Sakura, I'm going to start with you because I haven't heard from you in a sec.

257
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
No.

258
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
No, what?

259
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I'm still not preordering anything.

260
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I am still going to wait.

261
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You know, it's just like it's kind of what we did with the PS four.

262
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
You know, we didn't really didn't put in a preorder.

263
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
We you know, we got into ours.

264
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I'm kind of over the whole preorder and wait for a thing because they're going to be there.

265
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
You know, they're not going to sell out forever.

266
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It's not going to be like, you know, the person that goes off and buys one and then breaks it in front of people.

267
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
It's I mean, whoever is going to do that.

268
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Yeah, they're they're a dick and they're out of their money.

269
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
But I mean, it's not it's not that urgent to me.

270
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
It really isn't.

271
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I can wait.

272
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm this is one of the first years where I really feel like I can wait.

273
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I know. And you you and I and many people out there also come from a generation where we remember lining up for a Dreamcast,

274
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
lining up for a we lining up for a PlayStation two.

275
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And I don't know if that's a sign of our age or just how we're feeling about this generation of games was just kind of like, all right, well, we'll get around to it eventually.

276
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Right. It's also a little bit of kind of wanting to break that thing.

277
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:09,000
It's a very capitalist kind of thing where they put out the anticipation, they build this and build this and build this, you know, and really all they care about is the money.

278
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
You know, I kind of don't want to contribute to that anymore.

279
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
You know, let me get some comments. Yeah, of course.

280
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Let me get some comments from chat and I'll get to Loki Morrisimo in chat says day one before and after.

281
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
So there you go.

282
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Just cemented the decision to buy one day one.

283
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:34,000
That's why you're not alone in that. I know that Bobby Black Wolf in chat says the only reason I want to PlayStation five on launch day is because of the podcast.

284
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
If I was not a podcaster, I would be waiting.

285
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Yeah. You know, I definitely feel a little bit of that pressure, like, oh, I should have one because of the show.

286
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
But I feel like most of you guys are in just like a similar boat to me.

287
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Like, it's very hard to say I'm going to get a PlayStation five and an Xbox Series X.

288
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And for me, you guys, I haven't said this on the show in a while.

289
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Remember, reminder, I don't have a 4K TV yet, so that's something I have to buy this year.

290
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
So I kind of have to cut something loose to be able to afford this year.

291
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
So and obviously, a lot of people are hurting out there in the world right now.

292
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I'm very, very lucky, very, very fortunate to still be working in spite of the world conditions.

293
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I'm lucky I can be talking about these game systems at all.

294
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I think there's a lot of people that are going to be waiting a little bit.

295
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Anyway, I'll see a pixel Baucus kind of following that up, saying I want a PlayStation five Xbox Series X or S due to reviewing games.

296
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
But I could also keep reviewing games on my PlayStation. I'm sorry.

297
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I'm sorry. On my PC. Sjoan Hunter Matt says, I'm waiting on a PS5 for next year.

298
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
OK, Loki, please. So your thoughts before and your thoughts after.

299
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I don't know. I wasn't really sold on it before, and I'm not really sold on it after either.

300
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Like, I get it that like Final Fantasy is coming out, but how many years did we see a trailer for Final Fantasy 13?

301
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
How many? Did we see a date when this game's coming out?

302
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
How about Final Fantasy 15? There was more of those.

303
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
But yes. Yeah. So like, I mean, honestly, when I was thinking 13, I mean 13 verses.

304
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
But like like honestly, this game's not coming out any time soon.

305
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
So like no reason for me to jump in just to give this in.

306
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Like honestly, like I haven't really been interested in a lot of the first party Sony titles aside from.

307
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I don't know, I can't really think of any like God of War.

308
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I mean, it's a great game. Just not really interested in it anymore.

309
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Last of Us, not interested in it. Uncharted? Nope.

310
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I can play those on my PlayStation 4. I don't know.

311
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Like even like the Spider-Man game looks kind of cool, but I didn't get it last time either.

312
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
So like I've got a lot of games in my backlog anyways to pick up.

313
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
So I'm just going to wait, I think, on that system.

314
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I'm more interested, though, like on the Xbox side of things, just because of Game Pass and all that.

315
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And also the system is much smaller like that thing. Even the digital edition of the PlayStation 5 is enormous.

316
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Like it's oddly shaped to like where the hell am I going to put this thing?

317
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
So like, I don't I don't know. That's like also one of the reasons, too.

318
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I like the fact that the Xbox is boxy and small.

319
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
In fact, it's kind of funny. They actually released online.

320
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
You can go download a papercraft version of the Xbox and fold it up and actually see where it will fit.

321
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Oh, wow. In your like AV setup if you want. So I may check that out.

322
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
But it was actually smaller than I thought it would be.

323
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
So that's where I'm at, assuming that I can actually get one of those.

324
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And even if I don't at launch, you know, it's not a big deal.

325
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Really only game looking forward to this year anyways is Cyberpunk.

326
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I have a PC for that, so I can wait on everything actually.

327
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I'm going to the chat for some more comments.

328
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
We have Shehulk10 who says, nobody needs these consoles.

329
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
And that's very true. Nobody needs it. It's not water or shelter.

330
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Certainly with 2020 being the way it's been.

331
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I understand why people want them very badly to help them cope with what a crazy year it's been and just everything else.

332
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Video games are an outlet.

333
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Video games are a way of expressing energy and spending that.

334
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
But I also completely understand, nobody needs this, right?

335
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And some people have to spend that money on other things and that's fine.

336
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Questbuster says, get behind me, FOMO. Get behind me.

337
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I want to reassure those with FOMO.

338
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It's okay if you can't afford these consoles day one.

339
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Don't let any marketing campaign or anything tell you otherwise.

340
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
You are still a gamer.

341
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
This is why games are still coming out on the PlayStation 4, even when they're coming out on PlayStation 5.

342
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
And Microsoft has a very similar strategy.

343
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I actually had one of the digital editions in a car or something and I was like, no, I don't need it.

344
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
But yeah, that is definitely a real thing.

345
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Another comment here from Black Compat who says, I'll get a PS5 in time for God of War Ragnarok.

346
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Yeah, it sounds like there's a lot of people where it's like, when that one game I have to have is available, then that's when I'm going to break.

347
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:21,000
So for me, the event did not change my mind, although I was neither unhappy or ecstatic with it.

348
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I thought it was, actually, I shouldn't say that.

349
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I thought it was fine. I thought it was a good presentation.

350
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I liked it that it wasn't just follow ups on all the things they did before.

351
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And for the most part, it was really primarily new stuff they were showing.

352
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And so I will give them props for that.

353
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
However, did it change my mind to not get PlayStation 5 day one?

354
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
It did not change my mind.

355
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I did not participate in the PlayStation 5 pre-orders.

356
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
This is certainly nothing anti-Sony.

357
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm kind of with that earlier comment I just read.

358
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
You know by the time Final Fantasy 16 comes out, I'm going to have one of these.

359
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
There's no question.

360
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And it probably will be in the budget for next year.

361
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I have opted this year to order a Xbox Series X day one.

362
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Now before you guys want to turn this into a Microsoft versus Sony thing, I want to stress, it's not.

363
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I'm a fan of everything, including Nintendo.

364
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And this is just kind of the ebb and flow of the way things work sometimes.

365
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Go back to last gen.

366
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I had a PS4 day one, and I got the Xbox One after they detached Kinect.

367
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Go back to the gen before that.

368
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I had an Xbox 360 as soon as I could get one, and then I got a PlayStation 3 eventually.

369
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Go back to the gen before that.

370
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
It was flipped again.

371
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I got the PS2 first, then I got the Xbox later.

372
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
So my point is, this is just how it flows.

373
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And I think the fact that I already have a PlayStation Pro, but my Xbox One is still really early on,

374
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
is heavily factoring into that decision.

375
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I feel like the upgrade for me from Xbox One plane, J in addition, to Xbox Series X

376
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
is going to be a more monumental upgrade than PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5.

377
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And the bottom line, what really sells me on it, I don't think either one of these consoles has a particularly strong day one lineup.

378
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
That's just the reality.

379
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:11,000
However, COVID and the 2020 situation and the supply chain and all that, I kind of get it.

380
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Like, I'm not an angry gamer about it.

381
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I'm actually quite surprised both of these systems are still coming out in 2020, to be quite honest.

382
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:29,000
But what pushes Series X just a little ahead for me is how they are embracing the backwards compatibility.

383
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And I don't mean just emulating Xbox One and 360 and Xbox, something Sony has declined to do,

384
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
but they are actually enhancing the backwards compatibility library.

385
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So if I get an Xbox Series X day one, and I don't even have to necessarily buy any of the launch day games,

386
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I will know, ooh, I'm getting a system that's going to enhance all of these games that I own.

387
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Whereas if I bought a PlayStation 5 day one, I feel like the messaging is, well, I can still play my PlayStation 4 games,

388
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
and they'll be a little faster thanks to the drive, but we haven't done anything to it besides that.

389
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
And your 3-2-1 games don't work either.

390
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:19,000
So for that reason, I'm waiting for the PlayStation 5 game I have to have to get a PlayStation 5.

391
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:27,000
So that is my reasoning on why I'm saying Xbox Series X for me day one and PlayStation 5 in 2021.

392
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,000
So any other comments or follow-up on the PlayStation 5 conference?

393
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
No?

394
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
All right, then.

395
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I'll play somebody else's, though.

396
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Yeah, of course, of course. When it's safe to hang out again, we'll all have to go to Loki's and play his PlayStation 5 if he gets one,

397
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and y'all can come over here and play my Xbox.

398
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
By the way, Rob, pray for me.

399
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I signed up for an MMO.

400
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Oh, which one?

401
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
You want to take a guess?

402
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Oh, 14. Did you come back to 14?

403
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I came back to 14.

404
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Oh, wowee. All right. That's going to be fun.

405
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Just now.

406
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Just now. What tipped the scales on that for you?

407
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I had a Twitter poll, and everyone told me to come back to this.

408
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Okay.

409
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
So I said, okay.

410
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Well, if you ever need help with Dungeons, you know I got your back.

411
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
You know I will, because I need to get leveled. I quit after Heavensward.

412
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
All right. Well, the expansion storylines are really good.

413
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
So I'll have to see that jerk face again.

414
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Excited to see your reaction to that.

415
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Let's see. Other comments here.

416
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Sj100matt says, it also supports cross saves on some titles.

417
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Forza Horizon 4 has cross save transfers to Series X.

418
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Oh, yes. That's right. That is a thing.

419
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And Sj100matt also said, and I think this is a very good point

420
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
and something I neglected to say in my argument,

421
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Game Pass sold me on sticking with a Series X.

422
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
That is another thing that definitely weighed into my thought process, too,

423
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
was like, ooh, I want to play Flight Simulator on console.

424
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Somebody correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe a version of Flight Simulator

425
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
is coming out for consoles, and I'm all about that.

426
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Yeah, I'm really excited for that. So there's that.

427
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Questbuster says, I'm not mad about either presentation. No hate.

428
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Both camps will find something to love,

429
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
but it's hard not to see how aggressive Microsoft is this time around

430
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
with their technology and ecosystem.

431
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And in my opinion, this is a big difference between

432
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Don Mattrick, who led the company when Xbox One came out,

433
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
and Phil Spencer, and where the company is at now.

434
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And I said this on a previous episode of OLR, and I'm going to say it again.

435
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Those of you that write Microsoft off with one fell swoop,

436
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I really need you to reexamine your approach.

437
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And I would tell the exact same thing to anybody trying to write off

438
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Nintendo or Sony. They are all doing great things right now,

439
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
and it's time for all of these game companies to get the respect they deserve.

440
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I'm not going to let gaming fans write off Xbox anymore.

441
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Now, I understand the golden rule of gaming.

442
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
A system is only as good as the games that are on it,

443
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
so I understand that if you're not into the things like Halo,

444
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
and Call of Duty, and stuff like that,

445
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
that it's going to shift your opinion and things like that.

446
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
That is completely understandable.

447
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
But take a look at Microsoft is super diversifying

448
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
what people have stereotyped them about before,

449
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
with games like Tell Me Why in Game Pass,

450
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
and the strength of the indie games that are on Game Pass as well.

451
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
That's my honest thought on that stuff.

452
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Alright, anyway, but I love all games.

453
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
This is going to be an exciting generation of games everywhere,

454
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
including PC, so we all win, except our wallets lose.

455
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Alright, anyway, let's get into something more topical.

456
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Let's talk about our gaming weeks,

457
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

458
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
So, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

459
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
It was actually eventful.

460
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
My iPad Pro arrived, so I've been trying out a bunch of different stuff.

461
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Of course, I'm back on Patterned.

462
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
We've got a couple pinball games,

463
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Dan's been playing a couple of them.

464
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I'm trying to actually think, because I've got a lot of stuff.

465
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I actually restarted Final Fantasy V.

466
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Oh, cool.

467
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I've really just been using it for some of my retro gaming,

468
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
and it's been pretty cool.

469
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
The next thing I have to do is hook up my SteelSeries controller,

470
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
so that I can actually play controller games.

471
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Oh, and I also got Among Us.

472
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Oh.

473
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Now, I just did the free play to kind of get a feel for it,

474
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
and it was really fun going around just killing people.

475
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
So, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing that.

476
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Seems sus.

477
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I don't know who else is playing.

478
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Now, after you said that,

479
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
every time you go in to play a game with anybody from OLR,

480
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
they're going to be DarkSakura's sus.

481
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
She's a thrill killer.

482
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
You know, I really hope that I get to be the imposter.

483
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I think sabotaging everyone's fun would be delightful.

484
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I mean, did I say that out loud?

485
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
You need to talk to Shane,

486
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
because he just jumped on that bandwagon this week, too,

487
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
and Delvin at VG Realness has been trying to talk me into getting it

488
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
and playing with him, which I probably will give in and do,

489
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
so stay tuned.

490
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
There might be some fun Among Us nights coming soon.

491
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
But, yeah, I'm almost scared to play that game,

492
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
because I don't know.

493
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I sometimes feel like I'm not a great liar in some of those games.

494
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
But then again, you know, I won the Survivor game,

495
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
so maybe I can do it.

496
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I don't know. We'll see.

497
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Maybe you can do it.

498
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Yeah.

499
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I have faith in you.

500
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I've enjoyed watching the Twitch streams that I've been watching on it.

501
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
This kind of makes me think of the old Werewolf game

502
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
that we used to play in DDR Freak.

503
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
It's totally Werewolf slash Mafia slash The Resistance.

504
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
It's totally that as a video game.

505
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,000
And those guys are smart for taking a very good formula

506
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
and adapting it into a video game.

507
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Yeah.

508
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I like that it even does a few things to help you mask the person,

509
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
but it also kind of gives me a little bit of Danganronpa,

510
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
as in, you know, you can call, like,

511
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I'm going to just nickname this a trial,

512
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:28,000
but like an emergency meeting that you can discuss who might the villain be.

513
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
The emergency meeting meme is great, too.

514
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I'm loving that as a 2020 meme.

515
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I haven't seen a meme yet,

516
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
because I didn't care enough until I decided just to see what it was about.

517
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
That's all right.

518
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Let's see.

519
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Other comments in chat.

520
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
No One Special 77 says,

521
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Would that make her dark sus-gura, though?

522
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Asking for science.

523
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
No.

524
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Come on, dad joke.

525
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I don't know what the sus is.

526
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I'm just going to play it.

527
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
So when people are, like, chatting,

528
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
because some people talk over the voice,

529
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
some people type in text,

530
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
so a very common thing is, like,

531
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
dark Sakura seems sus.

532
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
She was by herself, da-da-da.

533
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
So sus is, like, short for suspect.

534
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Suspicious?

535
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Yeah, suspicious.

536
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Okay, I get that.

537
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And let's see.

538
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Bobby Black Wolf is pointing out Among Us has kind of grown a lot

539
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
since it first came out.

540
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
It's also different now than it was in 2018.

541
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
They made a lot of updates to get it to the way it is today.

542
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
And yeah, so this is one of those interesting things

543
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
where this video game's been around for a few years.

544
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It just now is gaining intensity because of things like Twitch.

545
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Bobby's saying a big name Twitch streamer got a hold of it.

546
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Who knows?

547
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Maybe they were sponsored, maybe not.

548
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I don't know.

549
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
But now a lot of people are doing it.

550
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
That's how Binding of Isaac got popular.

551
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I thought...

552
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
The streamer found it, and yeah.

553
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Shit, Minecraft.

554
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Yeah.

555
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
And that actually is according to the devs, so...

556
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Yeah.

557
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Anyway.

558
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Anything else for your gaming week?

559
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
No.

560
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Okay.

561
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Then Loki, how was your gaming week?

562
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I didn't really play too much.

563
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I've been playing a bit of Orna just to do my daily wars,

564
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:12,000
and when I go places I try to capture any territories that I'm near.

565
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
What else?

566
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
So I've been playing a little bit of Hot Shots Racing.

567
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I think I played a little bit of Minecraft this week as well.

568
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Mainly just been working on game development stuff.

569
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
That's really what I've been doing.

570
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I've hired people to write music for me and do sound effects, so...

571
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Oh, you're stuck doing this now?

572
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
You've put money into it.

573
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Not much.

574
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,000
But yeah, so I've got that going, so I'm expecting to get that stuff hopefully next week.

575
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
And then...

576
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Yeah, just chug it along.

577
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Alright, I'm excited for you.

578
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
What systems are you releasing on?

579
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Some of them.

580
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Okay, alright.

581
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
At least one of them.

582
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
At least PC.

583
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Bobby Blocko says Amico. Who knows?

584
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Alright.

585
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Amico?

586
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Anything's possible.

587
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I don't even know how you would develop for that.

588
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I don't either, but there's got to be a way.

589
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
If you tweet Tommy Tallarico three times, he'll appear and tell you how to do it.

590
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
It's like the Candyman.

591
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Yeah, it is. It is.

592
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
The Amica Man.

593
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
The Amica Man.

594
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
The Running Man.

595
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Shh. Alright.

596
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Anyway.

597
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Excuse me.

598
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
My gaming week.

599
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Let's talk a little bit about Final Fantasy XIV.

600
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Because honestly, I know it's such a meme for me at this point.

601
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,000
But I fell on the crafting and gathering bandwagon so hard.

602
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XIV.

603
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I have all of my crafting and gathering jobs past level 65.

604
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
When less than ten days ago, five of them I hadn't even touched.

605
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
So I've been playing a lot of crafting and gathering.

606
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
But it's really fun.

607
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
And that's where I've been spending, honestly, a lot of my gaming time.

608
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I've been playing a little bit of other stuff here and there.

609
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Pokemon Go, of course, because today was community day.

610
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
And so I caught some Porygon shinies.

611
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
But not a lot.

612
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I was reading in Discord, I think SSJ100Mad or somebody was saying,

613
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Oh, I caught like 20 of them.

614
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
And then freaking Shane texted me.

615
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
He caught over 40 shinies.

616
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
40! What are you going to do with those?

617
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I know.

618
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I know. I know.

619
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
And some things about Shane can't be explained.

620
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I really hope he's watching.

621
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
But yeah, with my luck, though,

622
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
and maybe this is because I did Bluetooth catching.

623
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
And Porygons can sometimes be a little bit tougher.

624
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I don't know what it is.

625
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
The CP levels or whatever.

626
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
But I only got four with my Bluetooth.

627
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Now, granted, I didn't play the whole time.

628
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I was doing another project this morning.

629
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
So I really wasn't even out and about until like two o'clock.

630
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
And I was so low on Pokeballs the way I played.

631
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I went downtown to the grid and just used my Bluetooth

632
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
and drove up and down the grid where I knew all the Poke Stops were.

633
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
And so that way I was refreshing as I was capturing new stuff.

634
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
And I only got four shinies that way.

635
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
But that's okay.

636
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I'm more mad that none of them were good.

637
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Like, I got a one star.

638
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
That was my best Porygon.

639
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
They were all garbage.

640
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And I just like to get strong Porygons.

641
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
That's me.

642
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
SSJ100Mad says,

643
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
SSJ100Matt says,

644
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I tried to use my Go Plus,

645
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
but a lot ran away from it because Porygon is a higher tiered Pokemon.

646
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
So they're more likely to run.

647
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And you're right.

648
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
And I think that was my undoing in this event and why I only got four.

649
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Whereas other people I know got over 40.

650
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
So it just it is what it is.

651
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
So.

652
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
All right.

653
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Bobby Blackwell says, I got zero.

654
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Well, I feel better.

655
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Thanks, Bobby.

656
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
All right.

657
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Let's move on from our gaming week.

658
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
We have a lot of news to get into.

659
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Quick housekeeping note.

660
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I want to mention this at some point during the show.

661
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Some of you probably caught wind of this either on our social media or what have you.

662
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I launched a new experiment thing this week at the Voice of Geeks Network called the VoG Roundtable.

663
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,000
The idea with this is to try to bring in some new voices into VoG.

664
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
We have a lot of great voices that are out there already.

665
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
But I've been meeting a lot of great people through streaming, through networking,

666
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
and that thing through networking via Dragon Con and other conventions.

667
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
And we don't often have the ability to, especially when we're all in the same space,

668
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
have a lot of guests here long term on OLR.

669
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
So I was thinking, oh, what's something we could do?

670
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:23,000
So we launched the VoG Roundtable to get voices to talk about current trends in geekery.

671
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
So this week we did one on PlayStation 5.

672
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And I did bring Bobby in for one about the Twitch mid-roll ads.

673
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I wanted Bobby and I to have a conversation on that because there was a big question about

674
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
how will this impact VoG? So we kind of talked about that.

675
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And then Twitch ended up undoing that for now.

676
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
But I would say watch it anyway because there's some great alternative ideas to that in there.

677
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
And hopefully more to come.

678
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
And in my dream world, I'll do the first some of these.

679
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
But then pretty soon, Dark Soccer's going to host some roundtables.

680
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
And Bobby's going to host some roundtables.

681
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
And all of our VoG people will host some roundtables.

682
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
That's my hope. My hopes and dreams.

683
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
You certainly are signing me up for a bunch of stuff, Rob.

684
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I'm kidding.

685
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Hey now, you know what?

686
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:14,000
But the nice thing about the roundtable is that you don't necessarily have to launch a full podcast

687
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
if there's just one topic you want to talk about real quick.

688
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Like if you want to just talk about...

689
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
We need to have a whole decompression on this new pinball table that was just announced.

690
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Let's do a roundtable about it.

691
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And then we can talk for an hour about it and get it out of our system.

692
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
So anyway.

693
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I have luck.

694
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Yes, there you go. That's what I like to hear. I have thoughts. Good, good.

695
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Anyway.

696
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, kind of like an NPR segment.

697
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Just need some smooth jazz and calm talking.

698
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Bobby Blackwell says that Final Fantasy VII discussion we wanted to have.

699
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Yeah, that never did happen. We might need to make that happen for sure.

700
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
And then as Joe and Hunter Matt says, it's like a mini cast on a specific topic.

701
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Yes, except I do want to stress, it is not a podcast at this time.

702
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
That was a question I wasn't prepared for, funny enough, that came in when we were doing it live.

703
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:09,000
My original idea was to do it as VODs only on Twitch for subscribers that would then come out later on YouTube.

704
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,000
But Bobby kind of talked me into why do just VODs, why not just broadcast it live.

705
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
And I was like, alright, cool. We'll do it that way.

706
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
But we're not going to even set a regular date and time for that.

707
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
But you will be able to see them on Twitch.

708
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
If you're following here at VOG Network, we'll do those throughout the week.

709
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Some weeks there will be none. Some weeks there will be three.

710
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
It just depends on what the news is like that particular week.

711
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
And then you can also follow us on YouTube at VOG Network.

712
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
And we'll be posting everything there and on our website over at vognetwork.com.

713
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
And yes, Bobby Blackwell says we'll announce ahead of time on Discord. Absolutely.

714
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
And we're not going to do any on top of other VOG programs like Anime Jam Session.

715
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Yes, that is absolutely true as well. We're not going to tiptoe on other programming.

716
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Alright, enough about that side project. I just wanted you all to check it out.

717
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
And you may not have known, VOG Network has a YouTube channel.

718
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
We have a lot of random ass videos on that channel.

719
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And it's pretty cool. If you want to see Bobby showing off the rainbow road trick on a Tesla, there's a video about it.

720
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:18,000
If you want to see Shane and I reviewing the Mass Effect ride like five years ago at Great America, there's a video on that.

721
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
So, enjoy. There's a lot of random shit on YouTube. You may not even be there.

722
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,000
So, alright. Let's move on. More gaming news. It was a busy news week, right, Loki?

723
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Yes. So, there was lots of showcases this week. So, we already talked about PlayStation.

724
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,000
So, let's talk about Nintendo again. So, Nintendo's got some pretty cool stuff.

725
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
They did their partner showcase. They've done like three or four of those already this year, I think.

726
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:53,000
So, they talked a little bit about a new Monster Hunter game coming to the Switch, Monster Hunter Rise.

727
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,000
And that's going to be coming out March 26, 2021.

728
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:03,000
They also announced that there's going to be a Monster Hunter Stories 2 Wings of Ruin.

729
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:09,000
And that one is going to be kind of like a cel-shaded type of game.

730
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:16,000
And apparently, it is similar to the one that came out on the 3DS in 2017. So, it's kind of interesting.

731
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Fitness Boxing 2, Rhythm and Exercise. Definitely a popular subject, especially with everyone being stuck inside from COVID.

732
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:31,000
So, fitness games could be pretty popular, I'd imagine. That's coming out December 4th.

733
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Disgaea 6, Defiance of Destiny was announced as well.

734
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Apparently, they even have a max level in the game of 100 million. So, that's great.

735
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
So, you definitely level up a lot there.

736
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:58,000
They've got a game that's a Chicago mob-themed tactical role-playing game called Empire of Sin.

737
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:04,000
And that's going to be coming out, looks like, December 1st, 2020.

738
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Sniper Elite 4 is coming out this holiday.

739
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:13,000
The Long Dark is getting a Switch release, or did get a Switch release. It's out now.

740
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Hades, which I knew was coming to the Switch, they announced that it was coming out this last week.

741
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
So, that came out as well after the little announcement there.

742
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Balan Wonderland, of course, we knew that was coming to the PlayStation 4, maybe as Xbox.

743
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:37,000
One of those, they had the trailer on, but now it is also confirmed for the Switch on March 26th, 2021.

744
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,000
And it's also going to have co-op. That's that game that's done by the folks that did Knights into Dreams.

745
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
So, it should be pretty awesome.

746
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Rune Factory 5 is going to be coming to the Switch at some point.

747
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:55,000
And then they finished it up with Ori and the Will of Wisps is getting a Switch release, which it came out that same day.

748
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:03,000
So, in the year 2020, Nintendo ended a Nintendo event with a Microsoft product.

749
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
It's interesting. Interesting. That's all.

750
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Pretty sure they've done that before, though, with Minecraft.

751
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:13,000
No, they have. They have, but it's still one of those, you gotta see it to believe it type of things, right?

752
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,000
It's like playing Sonic on a Nintendo system. None of us were ready for it until it really happened.

753
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I will say, though, out of all that, a lot of good stuff in there, really.

754
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
But I think a lot of attention on Hades having just come out.

755
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I didn't pick it up on Switch. I have it on PC, though, and it is really good.

756
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
For a roguelike game, it's good, and it's got a neat little story to it.

757
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
So, I highly recommend that one. I think a lot of people are enjoying that for sure.

758
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says, my wife loves Hades.

759
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Quest Buster says, I'm tempted to snag Hades on Steam.

760
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Yeah, that's where I got it a few weeks ago.

761
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,000
After the first time they showed it in an earlier Partner Direct, I bought Hades on Steam.

762
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Phoenix7726 in chat asks, kind of on a related note about roguelikes, have any of you played Spelunky 2?

763
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Not yet, but I want to. I loved the first one, and so it's on my to-do list if I ever can clear this backlog.

764
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
It looks really exciting. What were your thoughts on it, Phoenix?

765
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Well, wait. I'll get you those answers later, but for now, let's talk about the Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S,

766
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:30,000
because the pre-orders are happening for that, and we know exactly when and what time,

767
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
because obviously the PlayStation 5 had some issues with pre-ordering.

768
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:40,000
They've even kind of updated Twitter to talk about that, that, you know, oops, we realize this kind of could have been better.

769
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
So, Microsoft is doing it all on the same date and the same time.

770
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I think overall that's probably a good thing, knowing the when is a good thing.

771
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:58,000
My one concern slash reservation is scalpers, because now that we all know exactly what day and time it's going to happen,

772
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I'm worried scalpers are going to really be arming the front lines.

773
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:07,000
So, I really hope some of these retailers have thought of some new surprises to kind of shut down these bots

774
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
or make it really hard for them to do the scalpio.

775
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I've heard that CAPTCHA codes don't really stop it. That's why the CAPTCHA chain, like, you don't type in codes anymore.

776
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Now it's click everything that looks like a banana, you know, and then it's like, oops, I clicked a plantain, I gotta do it again.

777
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:34,000
It's still, if you change up, like, something, I mean, it's still harder for them to do it than without it.

778
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Yeah. But anyway, the time and date to pre-order your Xbox X or S, or both if you want, is 8 a.m. Pacific,

779
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:49,000
and that's 11 a.m. Eastern Time on September 22nd, so that is coming up on Tuesday, so I know I'm going to be doing it.

780
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
We'll see how many others do it.

781
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:01,000
The retailers included Amazon, Target, Walmart, Best Buy, Costco, Sam's Club, GameStop, Newegg,

782
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:07,000
and also the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, kind of an interesting way to get the Xboxes around the world

783
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
to our men and women in the armed forces, so that's kind of interesting.

784
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
But all those, again, the list varies depending on your country.

785
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I read the list here in the U.S., but obviously that list changes a bit depending on your country.

786
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I think it's interesting Costco's on there. I feel like that's the one I'm going to try for,

787
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,000
because I feel like that's the one that'll have the least amount of people that realize you can pre-order an Xbox at Costco,

788
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:35,000
and I think me saying it here is not suddenly going to make a million more people realize that, but we'll see.

789
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I probably am going to have two browsers open, one on the left screen, one on the right screen,

790
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:45,000
this one on Costco, this one on Amazon or something, and figure out where I can get it first, but we'll see.

791
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
We'll see. So yeah, check that out.

792
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Again, the price, these consoles will be out November 10th, Xbox Series X, $499.99 retail,

793
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Xbox Series X, $299.99 retail, and of course, again, I'm giving you information here in the States.

794
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,000
All right, Pod Culture says, I thought it was 11 a.m. Eastern, or 11 a.m. for you guys.

795
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
No, it is 8 a.m. for us on the West Coast in California, Oregon, Washington.

796
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,000
It is going to be 8 for us and 11 for you East Coasters.

797
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Don't get the time wrong, or you'll be sad. All right.

798
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,000
DJ Rama S says, hitting Best Buy for mine, them reward zone points, yo.

799
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:31,000
And Pod Culture says what Rama said, I don't blame you, but I do want to caution you.

800
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:39,000
The complaints I saw about PlayStation 5 were a lot about their site and the timing out and all that stuff,

801
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
so I completely understand your reasoning, and I'm not going to tell you where to buy your stuff,

802
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:49,000
but just be forewarned. You may run into some ever-spinning clock pages and things like that,

803
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
but hopefully they'll be ready for it.

804
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I'll put all of the pages all at once. All of them.

805
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Yeah, hopefully they'll be a little more ready for it.

806
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I mean, maybe that was a problem with the PlayStation 5 is that it kind of just happened,

807
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:07,000
so maybe Best Buy will have some backups or something, I don't know, whatever they need to do to make it work.

808
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
All right, Pod Culture says I'll have Amazon open as well, so it sounds like I'm not the only one

809
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
that's going to kind of be doing two shops at the same time, so we'll see.

810
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
All right, let's move on. We have more news.

811
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Dark Sakura.

812
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Dark Sakura, I believe you're muted, so you'll have to go back to the beginning.

813
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Well, shit.

814
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
It happens.

815
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,000
There's a game series that a lot of people are very fond of. Some people in my family are.

816
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Rayman. How many folks in chat like Rayman?

817
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Because I thought it's always been a really neat game, a very pretty game,

818
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:46,000
but the creator of Rayman, Michel Ancel, has decided to quit video games

819
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:52,000
and is going to go to work on a wildlife sanctuary.

820
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
He's leaving the industry to do it full time.

821
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I mean, this is also the person who has brought us Rabbids and Beyond Good and Evil.

822
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:12,000
He did confirm that the current projects active Beyond Good and Evil 2 and Wild would continue without him.

823
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,000
He has said, and actually I'll just read part of the quote on here.

824
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Today is very special for me. After more than 30 years, I've decided to stop working on video games

825
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
and fully focus on my second passion, wildlife.

826
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:30,000
My new project takes place in the real world and consists in the wildlife open sanctuary

827
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,000
dedicated to education, nature lovers and wild animals.

828
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Many of you might want to know what will happen to Wild and BGE2.

829
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:45,000
No worries. Since many months now, the teams are autonomous and the projects are going super well.

830
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Beautiful things to be seen soon. May the fox be with you.

831
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:54,000
So, yeah, he had been with Ubisoft.

832
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:02,000
He had worked on, I mean, basically just so, you know, those big three series are well loved.

833
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Yeah.

834
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:15,000
And, you know, he announced Wild back at Games Con 2014, which is an open world where you play as, you know, animals.

835
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:25,000
And I guess maybe that might have been sort of a hint that he's really looking more toward working with the real thing.

836
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:33,000
And Ubisoft did confirm the details of the Wildlife Sanctuary project and wished him well.

837
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,000
And I'll be honest, I'm really looking forward to see what he does with his wildlife sanctuary.

838
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:48,000
It's Montpellier, France, and I wish him the best with it myself. I think it's a noble cause.

839
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Yeah. You know what? Good for him. Like, I know it's a big loss for the gaming industry.

840
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:57,000
This is adjacent to like if Miyamoto ever left Nintendo, heaven forbid.

841
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
But this is, you know, like that for Ubisoft.

842
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
You know, we're losing a very big creative force behind many of these games.

843
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:14,000
But at the same time, like, you know, he wants to take a lot of this money that he's earned doing these different projects and now focus on something else that's near and dear to his heart for a little while.

844
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,000
And it's kind of hard to be upset about that. It's a good thing.

845
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Don't worry to tell someone what to do with their life unless they're, you know, a bigot.

846
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Exactly.

847
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Don't worry to tell them what to do with their life.

848
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Looking in chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network, Quest Buster says, I'm relieved that this departure from Ubisoft was not because of a scandal.

849
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Sad but true. Sad but true.

850
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Too many of that.

851
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:42,000
S2100 Matt points out John Stewart did the same thing after he left The Daily Show.

852
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
That's true. You know, sometimes, you know, John Stewart probably could have got another TV show if he wanted.

853
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:52,000
But obviously he's been working a lot with the 9-11 firefighters, if I remember right. Right.

854
01:06:52,000 --> 01:07:00,000
And the folks that were losing medical coverage happening to all those people with the fund being drained by, you know, the tyrant.

855
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Yeah. So I think that's really cool. You know, he could have done another show if he wanted to.

856
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
But he's doing this other thing that he wants as well.

857
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Bobby Blackoff is also pointing out he has an animal sanctuary in New Jersey that John Stewart works with.

858
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
So that's pretty cool.

859
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:25,000
And Dark Tetsuya says, I'm always sad whenever Ubisoft does an E3 thing because I always am hoping there'll be a new Rayman sequel.

860
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Well, that doesn't mean there won't be another Rayman. It's just it won't have, you know, the same creative minds behind it.

861
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:38,000
But that's okay. You know, not every Mario game has had Miyamoto's direct involvement either.

862
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
So it happens.

863
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Anyway, let's see. One of the people who've left to do other things, Bill Gates and Microsoft. Right.

864
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Many people still associate Bill Gates with Microsoft, but he's honestly had nothing to do with Microsoft for some time now.

865
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:00,000
And he does a lot. Him and his wife both do a lot of philanthropy.

866
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
And, you know, those.

867
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Wozniak left Apple ages ago.

868
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Yes. Another great example. Yeah. So. All right.

869
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
He's a pretty cool dude.

870
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Oh, yeah. Was is was is a lot of fun to.

871
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Why didn't they try to give him a TV show at some point?

872
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Am I just confusing that one episode where Kathy Griffin went on a date with him?

873
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I think you might be confusing when Kathy Griffin dated was.

874
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Yeah, that was dated actually for a while.

875
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Yeah, that was an episode or two of the My Life on the D list back in the day.

876
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I didn't watch the D list. I just remember being in her stand up.

877
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Yeah.

878
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,000
About him proving that you can get speeding tickets driving a Prius.

879
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,000
If I'm sorry, but Loki's face, if you podcasters listen, I could have seen it.

880
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
He just looked like mind blown, like what?

881
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Kathy Griffin and the was. Yeah, that was a thing.

882
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Look it up. It's such an unlikely pairing.

883
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
No, I mean, I but you know what?

884
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:58,000
That's the stuff in Hollywood that I love when the unlikely people get together.

885
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
That's awesome to me. So anyway. All right.

886
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:06,000
But it's like that kind of stuff. Like you think that like it's funny hearing stories like that,

887
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000
where it just works really well, like these really unlikely couples.

888
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Yeah, right. All right. Anyhow, let's move on. We have more stories.

889
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Let's talk about this one, Loki, about EA.

890
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Oh, yeah. Look it here. Here's something very unexpected.

891
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:29,000
It's it's EA, you know, killing off another studio. What?

892
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Well, not really. Not really, Loki. Don't misrepresent it.

893
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Oh, yes, it is. It's exactly the same, you know, so basically like like EA likes to do.

894
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:43,000
They like to purchase companies and then they like to destroy them eventually.

895
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:52,000
So EA origin was kind of pretty much dead anyways, aside from it being their platform for selling games.

896
01:09:52,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Well, apparently now they're going to be retiring the origin name and just calling it the wonderful EA desktop app.

897
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Wow. What a creative name. That's a creative creative name.

898
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Way to weigh the EA that EA much, much like their sports games and stuff.

899
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:20,000
They've put the maximum amount of creativity and development into this brand new name.

900
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
You know, someone got paid for it, though.

901
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:30,000
It stands by, you know, and much like, you know, the current version of Madden or even the last year's version of Madden,

902
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I'm sure we'll go into EA desktop app and see references to origin still.

903
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:42,000
So I can't wait to see that. But eventually, I don't know if they're going to change the name of their.

904
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:48,000
You know, they've already kind of changed their EA access service from origin access. So it makes sense.

905
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Yeah. You know, and I think it's kind of a sign of where things are going.

906
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
And let's be real. Origin had problems from the beginning.

907
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Origin had some serious problems in the beginning and had a reputation that it never really was able to shake, you know, origin.

908
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:08,000
And I would say I would dare to say origin really wasn't that bad later on.

909
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,000
And they gave away some free games and stuff. And it was it was an OK app to have.

910
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:16,000
And I keep saying, like, the whole thing's going away. It's not it's just a rebranding. Right.

911
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
But I kind of do feel like even if it's a rebranding,

912
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:25,000
it is also indicative of a shift from EA wanting to go to like the storefront

913
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:31,000
and the steam model that they were kind of going for with origin to that subscription model.

914
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:38,000
And I think that's why things have kind of changed and shifted to what they have,

915
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:43,000
because it's to bring origin closer to where EA really wants to be with EA access,

916
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
especially now that they have that tie in deal with Microsoft,

917
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:52,000
which is really just the first level of EA access, because, you know,

918
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,000
they're going to hope that some of the people they get through with Game Pass are going to be tempted to go a little higher with their EA.

919
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
That's that's the whole reason why the deals there in the first place,

920
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
because they're going to really want you to sign up for EA access as well.

921
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Some wishful thinking. It's like I could get one hundred and twenty seven games more.

922
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:13,000
I think it's like one hundred seventy two. It's over one hundred games.

923
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Or I could get Madden.

924
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Now, I will say I do have to just symbolically pour one out for origin.

925
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:28,000
It does make me a little sad to see that name go away because origin is that thing,

926
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:36,000
that brand associated with the Richard Garriott games of the 80s and early 90s and notably the Ultima series.

927
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Right now, obviously, origin, the desktop app was nothing to do with that, per se.

928
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
But it is where the name came from. And you could, you know, get Ultima.

929
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I believe you could get like Ultima nine. I think that was one of their free giveaways at one point was Ultima.

930
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Pagan was one of the games you could get on origin for free for a month or something like that.

931
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,000
So I do have to symbolically pour one out for that reason.

932
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,000
No one special. Seventy seven also points out Wing Commander was an origin title back in the day.

933
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Yes, yes, yes. So it is it is a name in the gaming industry synonymous with a lot of great 80s and 90s games.

934
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Y'all just might not realize it. So pretty cool. All right.

935
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Interesting on the rebranding front, because a lot of people talking about plus.

936
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
And there was the comment that came up that said, I'm surprised.

937
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Oh, Tiger class says, I'm surprised it didn't just go with a name such as EA plus,

938
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,000
because that's how a lot of services are doing these days, putting a plus next to the name.

939
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:39,000
And obviously, we all think about Disney Plus, but Tiger Claw does call out CBS All Access just announced in the last week or so.

940
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,000
They're going to be rebranding to Paramount Plus.

941
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:50,000
So that is where like Star Trek Discovery and stuff is going to be now is Paramount Plus not dead serious.

942
01:13:50,000 --> 01:14:01,000
No, no, no, no. See, so this this joke is not going to this only resonates with me because none of you worked in the distribution industry.

943
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:08,000
But back when I used to work at a distribution company, Paramount Plus was the name of our incentive card that we got from Paramount.

944
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,000
They'd actually put money on it as like a credit card type thing that they kept loading with money if you did well.

945
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,000
So I think that's just kind of funny that they're using that name. Interesting.

946
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Oh, that is OK. Oh, that's that's a clever little insight I wouldn't have known about. So that's cool.

947
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:26,000
I always associate Paramount. If you have seen the movie Clue from 1985.

948
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:32,000
And if you haven't, I highly suggest you put some time aside to watch Clue immediately.

949
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:39,000
You can watch it on an Xbox one or PlayStation through. Is it Pluto or is it the other one?

950
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,000
One of those free TV apps has Clue on it and you can watch Clue the movie and you need to do it.

951
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:50,000
If you've never seen the movie, it is a Pluto TV. I don't know if it's I feel like it's the other one or not.

952
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Or you can just have Netflix on while you're gaming.

953
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Yes, I think it's still on Netflix, too. But the reason why that movie comes to mind, the logo at the very beginning, it was a Paramount motion picture.

954
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,000
So you see the Paramount logo at the beginning. And of course, a lot of movies in the 80s.

955
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Paramount was a huge and still is a huge studio, I think, from the front for movies.

956
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
So you see that logo in front of a lot of things. So yet to be thank you.

957
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:18,000
That's what I was trying to think of. I think it is actually on to be. So there it is.

958
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Although Clue will probably move to Paramount Plus, I imagine, because it is a Paramount. It's part of that library.

959
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:32,000
But they're already, just since I am a CBS All Access subscriber, because I used to like Big Brother, but it's fucking impossible this season.

960
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,000
And I enjoy Star Trek a lot. And I'm not shilling for them, I promise.

961
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:43,000
But in the beginning, they didn't have a lot. They had the good fight and Star Trek and that's about it.

962
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:48,000
But they've been going back and now they're really trying to add stuff from Viacom's other stuff.

963
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:55,000
So they have a lot of MTV stuff now. They have VH1 now. They have all of Drag Race is there now.

964
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,000
So that's pretty cool. And I'm hoping when the new episodes air, they'll be on there too. So that'll be nice.

965
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I'm still probably going to keep watching them through my Apple TV.

966
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Well yeah, you'd probably get them uncensored there. I don't know if they'll be uncensored or I'm watching them.

967
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
I can get them uncensored.

968
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Moving on, let's talk about another game expo that happened online this weekend.

969
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:23,000
It was the Game Devs of Color Expo. And the Game Devs of Color Expo happened over the weekend.

970
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Of course, it was virtual because, you know, 2020, everything is virtual.

971
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:35,000
But what was getting a lot of attention was that they did a Game Devs of Color Expo Direct before the expo kind of happened.

972
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:39,000
So like, I think it was on Thursday, maybe Friday. Sorry, I forget exactly what day.

973
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:49,000
But they actually did some announcements, Nintendo style, of some great indie games that are going to be coming out soon that were part of what was featured at this Game Devs of Color Expo.

974
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:56,000
If you want to see all the games or you want to see the Direct, you can visit the website GameDevsofColorExpo.com.

975
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
But I do want to point out two of the ones that really caught my eye.

976
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Breakpoint, which is a game that is releasing next week.

977
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Breakpoint looks like Geometry Wars, it looks like a version of that, but which I'm sure the devs have heard 100 times.

978
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:26,000
But it does look unique because they've kind of brought like a sword and shield type of mechanic to it.

979
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
And the soundtrack is awesome.

980
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Yeah, it is. So this was definitely a highlight.

981
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,000
And honestly, probably a game I'm going to get next week is Breakpoint.

982
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
So that was a cool one to see.

983
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
And then I liked this.

984
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Jamie, I feel like this game would be up your alley as well.

985
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Proto Corgi was the other game.

986
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
What?

987
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,000
It was a retro inspired shoot-em-up, but you are a dog.

988
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
You play as Bullet, a flying Corgi pup.

989
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I get serious Parodius vibes from this game, but it's like a Corgi.

990
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,000
I like that it's firing like bark.

991
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Yes!

992
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Now here's something really cool, Dark Sakura.

993
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
There is a demo out for this game right now on Steam.

994
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
So you can, yep, so you can Corgi all the things.

995
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Proto Corgi is the name of that game, so check that out.

996
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,000
You know what? I'm getting it right the fuck now.

997
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
There you go.

998
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I keep forgetting that I'm not on my Mac,

999
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,000
so I'm trying to do Command Space to open Spotlight, to open my Steam,

1000
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:33,000
and no PCs don't have that beautifulness.

1001
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Good life choice. Anyway, obviously the event,

1002
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
technically I think it's still going on tonight,

1003
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
but I imagine most people probably have missed it by this point.

1004
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
However, you can still check out the Direct.

1005
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Obviously a lot of these demos are coming out on Steam.

1006
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
And yeah, this is pretty cool.

1007
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I have to admit, this is the fifth annual,

1008
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
and I feel like it might have come up on OLR again last year,

1009
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
but I did not hear about this all five years,

1010
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
so I'm glad that this is getting out there,

1011
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
and this is something I hope someday I could check out in person.

1012
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
It sounds really cool.

1013
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
And a lot of great games.

1014
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
What's that?

1015
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
I changed my background to it.

1016
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Oh, Loki changed his background to Proto Corgi.

1017
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
That's awesome. Love it.

1018
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
I just downloaded it.

1019
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
All right.

1020
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
And Quest Buster saying,

1021
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Proto Corgi demo is only 77 megabytes.

1022
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Yes. Remember when games were a sensible size?

1023
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
It looks wonderfully animated.

1024
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,000
It's almost like a Paul Robinson type thing.

1025
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,000
I would be surprised if he's the one that did that,

1026
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
but I don't think it is.

1027
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Super cool.

1028
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
So props to the folks showing off again.

1029
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
And there's many more.

1030
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
I could spend a three-hour show talking about everything there,

1031
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
but those are just two where I was like,

1032
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
I'm ordering that, I'm ordering that.

1033
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
So those were them.

1034
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Fifth Dream in chat says,

1035
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
waiting for the sequel.

1036
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Neo Corgi.

1037
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Yeah. Cool, cool.

1038
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
All right.

1039
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Let's move on to, well, another story.

1040
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
It's got to be talked about.

1041
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Dark Sakura.

1042
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:08,000
So the TERF as in T-E-R-F.

1043
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
As I put on the sidebar, Lady Voldemort.

1044
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
No, I'm not going to, I'm not going to go with that.

1045
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,000
She hasn't killed anybody yet, but.

1046
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Anyway.

1047
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Yet.

1048
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Yeah.

1049
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:29,000
But she may end up being indirectly responsible for damaging the mental health of millions

1050
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
of people who are fans of her work.

1051
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:41,000
So she is not going to be involved in the latest Harry Potter game.

1052
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
That's Hogwarts legacy.

1053
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:47,000
That's supposed to come out on, you know, the next, next gen stuff.

1054
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:52,000
But the thing that I need to emphasize a big ass,

1055
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,000
but like a ceramics lot sitting on it size,

1056
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:04,000
but is that she's still going to make money from sales of the game.

1057
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:10,000
And she actually just put out a, you know,

1058
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:15,000
there's a book out that she did under the pen named Robert Galbraith,

1059
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:23,000
who is also the name of the American psychiatrist who pushed gay conversion therapy.

1060
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Where the there's a murderer who is a, quote, cross dresser.

1061
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
By the way, who I also read.

1062
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Where's Haji?

1063
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:42,000
So it's not just transphobic, but it's Islamophobic as well.

1064
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:50,000
So I would strongly, strongly urge people do not give this book any money.

1065
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Do not give the game any money.

1066
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Do not give any of it any money.

1067
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:00,000
You know, if I even posted this on Twitter, you know, you can be a fan of that universe

1068
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,000
and not support her, not buy any more things.

1069
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
You don't have to get rid of what you already own.

1070
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,000
I mean, shit, I went through that with Jeffree Star.

1071
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:14,000
You know, I bought all that makeup and then, oh, by the way, he's piece of shit.

1072
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
So, but I didn't throw anything away.

1073
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
I spent money on it.

1074
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,000
You know, whether or not I throw it away or anything, he still had my fucking money.

1075
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Same with her.

1076
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:28,000
You know, I, you know, I tell people that, you know, I would,

1077
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I would even say don't support people streaming it

1078
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,000
because that's just going to encourage more people to purchase the game.

1079
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:44,000
And I don't care how little involvement she has with the creation of this game.

1080
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
She's made money from the license.

1081
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Do not add more because quite likely in these contracts,

1082
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
she's also getting money from continuous profits.

1083
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Do not fucking buy the game.

1084
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,000
And if I find out you do, I will teleport to your,

1085
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:07,000
I will operate to your house and I don't know,

1086
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
but I'll do some kind of curse that's nasty.

1087
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,000
I have to, even though I don't necessarily disagree with you,

1088
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I have to present some popular counterpoints that are going on out there

1089
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:21,000
because some would argue that if you are going to take such a hard line on that,

1090
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Jamie, that you should be inviting people to come to your house

1091
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,000
and see if you have anything problematic in your house because you probably do.

1092
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,000
That there are many companies, everything is problematic.

1093
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
There are so many things out there.

1094
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:40,000
But when you have something that's right now in front of you,

1095
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:48,000
you know, you could get me on a tangent about actually how much veganism harms the environment

1096
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:55,000
and how not eating honey harms bees, you know, but I digress.

1097
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
You know, you do have to pick your battles.

1098
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:06,000
And this is one that is, it's not just the damage that she's doing with her current work,

1099
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
but it's a betrayal.

1100
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
You know, there's another edge to it.

1101
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Betrayal is a really good word.

1102
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Yeah.

1103
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:18,000
And it just sucks to see people in power use their power for such crappy things,

1104
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
you know, and that's what's really frustrating.

1105
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
And there's a lot, and the other counterpoint I wanted to bring up

1106
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
because this is one where I was like, well, that's an interesting kind of like, you know,

1107
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:31,000
is that for people that really feel like this universe is a part of their essence,

1108
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
it is a part of their childhood, it is a part of them,

1109
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:39,000
some people would say that, you know, maybe one way they can kind of rationalize,

1110
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
okay, I'm going to do it, is that I'm going to buy the game,

1111
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,000
but I'm going to give a sizable amount, either the same cost of the game

1112
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:51,000
or at least some, if not more, than what her would get from the game.

1113
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,000
I'm going to donate to a trans, pro-trans charity.

1114
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
She's still going to get money.

1115
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:01,000
It's still going to be money in her pocket.

1116
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Yeah, but how far to remove must we be from all this stuff?

1117
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Like, I'm not going to go like try to look at all the background information

1118
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
for all the products I buy for everything.

1119
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
I'm going to buy what I want to buy, honestly,

1120
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
and I'm going to probably buy this game because it looks awesome,

1121
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
my kids want to play it.

1122
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
So, yeah, I get it.

1123
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,000
I don't support what she says, I don't support that,

1124
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
but your money does.

1125
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,000
No, my money supports the developers of the game,

1126
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
which then is licensing by Warner Brothers.

1127
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
They have the rights to the actual movie series.

1128
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,000
They're going to pay her that money regardless if that sells zero copies

1129
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
or a million copies.

1130
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
That money is already paid.

1131
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,000
It's not already paid because in all of those contracts

1132
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
she gets money for every copy sold.

1133
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Do you know that?

1134
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Have you actually looked at her contracts for those games?

1135
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
I'm sorry, but like that's an assumption that you're making.

1136
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
And you know what?

1137
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,000
You can not support the game.

1138
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
That's fine.

1139
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,000
But like I'm not at a point here in my life where I just

1140
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,000
am not going to go do all the background research for everything.

1141
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Like if that's the case, I'm not buying any more Ubisoft games

1142
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
because I think every single game company out there is problematic.

1143
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
OK.

1144
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Warner Brothers is problematic.

1145
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
I mean, as it is.

1146
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,000
So like, I can't, I can't just block myself off

1147
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
because someone said something mean on the Internet or hurtful.

1148
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,000
OK.

1149
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Or racist.

1150
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,000
It's just you got to draw the line somewhere.

1151
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
OK.

1152
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,000
I don't know.

1153
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
It's like the whole like Chick-fil-A and like not supporting them

1154
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
either because they donate stuff.

1155
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Let me get.

1156
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
OK.

1157
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,000
I just want to get some comments from chat here.

1158
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Some important things here to say, as Joan Hunter-Matt says,

1159
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
to be clear, Jamie is not wrong how she feels.

1160
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Oh, absolutely not.

1161
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
And there's a lot of people that feel this.

1162
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Absolutely.

1163
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Absolutely.

1164
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,000
But Bobby Blackwell points out Twitch is problematic.

1165
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Oh, God.

1166
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Yeah.

1167
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Remember that whole thing they did this week with the whole.

1168
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Exactly.

1169
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
The emojis for the Latin.

1170
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,000
I think it was.

1171
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
And you'll have to excuse me.

1172
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
I'm sorry.

1173
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I do not remember the official name of the event that they were doing.

1174
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
I think it was like Latin Gaming Week or something.

1175
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,000
But they were giving like allowing you to modify emojis with sombreros

1176
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:10,000
and maracas, which if it is a Mexican pride event is probably fine.

1177
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Most Mexicans that I've talked to think that kind of stuff is cool,

1178
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:20,000
but not when it's all of Latin America, which would be a lot larger than just Mexico.

1179
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Obviously, that was a problematic thing that Twitch did.

1180
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Bobby Blackwell says Dragon Con was co-founded by a child molester.

1181
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
I still went.

1182
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Yeah, that went.

1183
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
That was yikes.

1184
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Thank God they divorced from him and they finally played some legal chess to do that.

1185
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,000
As Joe and Matt says, keep in mind, a lot of people worked on this game.

1186
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
People who likely do not agree with her views.

1187
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
These people's careers and development are at stake for this game.

1188
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:52,000
And a perfect example of a game that has also very problematic.

1189
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Minecraft.

1190
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Notch has said some very terrible things.

1191
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Oh, God.

1192
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Oh, he's.

1193
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:03,000
The opinions that I want on this are from our trans listeners.

1194
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Okay.

1195
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:10,000
If anybody out there is willing to speak up and chat, I would definitely love to hear it.

1196
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:15,000
So and I, you know, again, nobody is wrong in the way they feel.

1197
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,000
And I think everybody kind of has to evaluate this.

1198
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:27,000
And I think one thing we can do and luckily we are doing and I think we need to continue to do on social media is kind of present the facts.

1199
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:35,000
You know, did you know she is a problem and she has these views that are hurtful.

1200
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:45,000
They're hurting people, especially people that were so in love with this universe, only to find out that, you know, the author behind it doesn't support them as people.

1201
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
That's horrible.

1202
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:52,000
At least you can educate people with this information so they can make a decision on what they want to do.

1203
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,000
And I can still judge people for doing it.

1204
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:05,000
I'm sorry, it's as someone who is on that spectrum and I will not elaborate anymore because it's nobody else's business.

1205
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:20,000
It, it, it feels like a bigger stab in the heart, you know, and I in you know maybe it is a bit more emotional for me, but I don't.

1206
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:28,000
I can't see how it would be right to do anything that's that further supports her work.

1207
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Okay, and I think we'll leave it at that for now. So let's because, you know, we want to let make sure every gamer has a voice, the voices are out there.

1208
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Now you have an opportunity to figure out what you want to do.

1209
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:45,000
All right, let's move on and talk about social media of sorts of sorts. Right, Loki?

1210
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Speaking of another problematic company, Facebook.

1211
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:56,000
So Facebook Connect, they talked about the new things coming toward or in the Oculus brand.

1212
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:03,000
So, of course, the Oculus Quest 2 was announced and, you know, the different games coming to that as well.

1213
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
So, of course, with that, some announcements that were made.

1214
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:13,000
They're going to be bringing Star Wars Tales from the Galaxy's Edge, which is from the same developers who did Vader Immortal.

1215
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,000
So that's pretty awesome. So wish I had played the original.

1216
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Jurassic World Aftermath, Medal of Honor, above and beyond.

1217
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Population one, Beat Saber is getting me getting multiplayer as well.

1218
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,000
So that's kind of cool.

1219
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Myst, getting, I guess, another VR.

1220
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:34,000
I thought they already had a VR version for Myst, but I guess maybe it's now coming to the Quest 2.

1221
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:42,000
The Climb 2, Warhammer 40,000 Battle Sister, Pistol Whip 2089, and The Walking Dead Saints and Sinners.

1222
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:50,000
So apparently the new, I'm not sure when the Quest 2 is supposed to be out.

1223
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,000
I'm imagining probably relatively soon.

1224
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
And then, of course, you know, a bit of warning.

1225
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Starting in October, new Oculus users will have to link their account or they will need a Facebook account.

1226
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:15,000
And also existing accounts, existing Oculus accounts will have to be linked to a Facebook account starting January 1st, 2023 to get full functionality.

1227
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
So that's the only thing that sucks there.

1228
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Otherwise, you know, I have a Rift and, you know, I like my Rift desk, but yeah, I don't know.

1229
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Facebook, I really wish there was a reason why they were doing that, aside from just spying on people.

1230
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Yeah, I mean, I have no plans to ever buy an Oculus product, so that's that.

1231
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,000
And maybe this kind of goes back to the other conversation.

1232
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I don't know.

1233
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:47,000
But just, you know, for me, I'm not loving the idea of that being tied to Facebook accounts and I don't have a Facebook account anymore.

1234
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
So and I'm not getting one.

1235
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
So, yeah.

1236
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Well, I should clarify, I am still on Messenger and Instagram.

1237
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,000
However, I don't see myself doing that long term.

1238
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:04,000
It is something that has to slowly wean from while I find replacements for things like Messenger, that's for sure.

1239
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
So, all right.

1240
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Yeah.

1241
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Well, speaking of things that are ending, we have to talk about the 3DS, because this week it was announced that Nintendo is going to officially be ending Nintendo 3DS production.

1242
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
The official Japanese page for the Nintendo 3DS.

1243
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:29,000
And of course, that would also mean the 2DS is going to be involved, because that's kind of where 3DS ended up in its later years.

1244
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Right.

1245
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:39,000
So and then in a statement to Kotaku, Nintendo of America did confirm that the 3DS handhelds are no more, saying in a statement, quote,

1246
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:44,000
we can confirm that the manufacturing of the Nintendo 3DS family of systems has ended.

1247
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Nintendo and third party games for the Nintendo 3DS family of systems will continue to be available in the Nintendo eShop on Nintendo.com and at retail.

1248
01:32:53,000 --> 01:33:02,000
The existing library of more than 1000 Nintendo 3DS games contains many critically acclaimed titles and can provide years of content to explore and enjoy.

1249
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:08,000
So, yeah, basically they're saying, you know, yes, we're no longer going to be making the hardware,

1250
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:14,000
but it's not like we are suddenly going to come to your house and take all your 3DS away from you.

1251
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:18,000
That is very much not the case and not something they would be capable of doing.

1252
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:24,000
However, even though they kind of talk about that things could be available, like digitally and things like that,

1253
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:30,000
I'm not sure that would mean that the 3DS store is still going, if I remember right.

1254
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Right. You still have the option to use the 3DS store.

1255
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Right.

1256
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Plus, they still have like codes out there that you can buy or retail.

1257
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
They still sell 3DS games at retail.

1258
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Yeah.

1259
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Still full price because I looked.

1260
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:49,000
In fact, I actually just picked up my son, the Paper Mario sticker star,

1261
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:56,000
because he's getting close to finishing Paper Mario and the Origami King and I thought he'd want another one to play.

1262
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
So I got that for him as well.

1263
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,000
But yeah, a lot of those games are still full price.

1264
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:06,000
I'll wait until Black Friday and that kind of time frame when they mark those down again.

1265
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
But yikes.

1266
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:15,000
I'm surprised like this far after that stuff has come out, especially like the latest, like last Pokemon games on 3DS.

1267
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
They're still thirty nine ninety nine.

1268
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
It's ridiculous at this point.

1269
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,000
And the last official Nintendo first party game for that was the Kirby Robobot.

1270
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Right. Was the last thing they actually did.

1271
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
I think so.

1272
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
I don't remember.

1273
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
I feel like that was a couple of years ago at this point.

1274
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:35,000
But I was going to say with the store, the store is still available for now.

1275
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:41,000
But I have to be honest, how long until that ends up going away as well?

1276
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
I mean, the Nintendo like the Wii.

1277
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Yeah, exactly. Just like the Wii.

1278
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
And we've seen this happen before.

1279
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:51,000
I think it's probably a matter of time before the 3DS shop probably gets pulled, too.

1280
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
I don't want to panic anybody.

1281
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,000
But if you do have titles you're looking at getting and you want to get them electronically,

1282
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
you might want to think about budgeting for those in the next year.

1283
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,000
You probably still have at least a good year of life left in that shop.

1284
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,000
But that probably will be the beginning of the end.

1285
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Me-topia and Radiant Historia were the last two 3DS games I played.

1286
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Act Def says WarioWare Gold.

1287
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
I think that was the last one.

1288
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Phoenix 77 26 talks about Shovel Knight also got the final update as well.

1289
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:27,000
This is why it might also be a good idea to, I don't know, root your DS and back up your games.

1290
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Tiger Claw says I could see Nintendo porting some 3DS games to the Switch in the future.

1291
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:38,000
You know, I kind of hope that's where some of this ends up because after all, if you just tilt a Switch vertically,

1292
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:45,000
you can probably get a very similar real estate on a vertical screen that you would get on a 3DS or a 2DS.

1293
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
I mean, you might have a little bit of cropping, but.

1294
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:54,000
I'm still surprised we're in the middle of September and they haven't announced any big changes to Nintendo online.

1295
01:35:54,000 --> 01:36:01,000
It's just, you know, before they were like, oh, yeah, this year in the Super Nintendo collection or whatever,

1296
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,000
before the NES collection, there's like no new collections or anything.

1297
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
It's just I get what you mean.

1298
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
I was gonna say we have a minor update later in the show, but I see what you mean.

1299
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Like a whole new like a Game Boy collection or something.

1300
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
I get it. I get it.

1301
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Game Boy or something.

1302
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Like, I'm surprised that they haven't done anything.

1303
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Well, don't speak too soon.

1304
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
You never know what might be coming. Fingers and toes crossed.

1305
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Maybe the whole 2020 stuff pushed things back.

1306
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
I know I'm not going to hold my breath either.

1307
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
I'm not going to hold my breath, but well, I mean, it will be it.

1308
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Let's let it be a nice surprise if we were to suddenly get a Game Boy Advance, you know, library,

1309
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,000
which I would love a Game Boy Advance library myself.

1310
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:44,000
But there's a lot of things I think will be really cool and lend itself well to the system.

1311
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Anyway, let's go back to a classic time when these games are still alive in our hearts.

1312
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
You know what? You can't take that away from me.

1313
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
My memories and all of that of these games.

1314
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,000
It's the classic game of the week.

1315
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,000
And every week Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault to find a game that she thinks,

1316
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,000
hey, you guys should be playing this game right now.

1317
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
It's the classic game of the week.

1318
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Dark Sakura, what did you pick for the classic game of the week?

1319
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,000
I have chosen Cannon's Bike.

1320
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:20,000
And the reason being is because I'm on a Dreamcast kick.

1321
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:25,000
So I mean, we should all always be on a Dreamcast kick.

1322
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Well, I mean, the Dreamcast is I mean, it was a pretty amazing little system, you know.

1323
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:43,000
The great thing about it is that you had so many direct arcade games that came over on the Dreamcast.

1324
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:48,000
And Cannon's Bike is one of them, or as it was known in Japan, Gun's Bike.

1325
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:53,000
But at any rate, it is a multi-directional shooter game.

1326
01:37:53,000 --> 01:38:03,000
And it was released in 2000 by Psycho and later came out in the same year on the Dreamcast and was released by Capcom.

1327
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,000
It ran on the NAOMI hardware.

1328
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,000
And remember, it's not NAOMI, it's NAOMI.

1329
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Same with me, NAOMI.

1330
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:20,000
And it is kind of like Commando and Smash TV, although the focus is boss fighting, you know.

1331
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:26,000
But at any rate, it is the last game released for the Dreamcast in Europe.

1332
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:31,000
It was published by Big Ben Interactive and sold at Game exclusively.

1333
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:37,000
So at any rate, you have different playable characters.

1334
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Although, you know, the game Cannon's Bike was named after one of Cammy's moves.

1335
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,000
And Cammy is in the game.

1336
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:49,000
But you also have Arthur from Ghosts and Goblins or Ghouls and Ghosts.

1337
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:56,000
You have Boleta as she was in Japan or Baby Bonnie Hood from Darkstalkers as a hidden character.

1338
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:02,000
You have Charlie or Nash as he was in Japan from Street Fighter Alpha.

1339
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,000
You had Rockman or Mega Man.

1340
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:14,000
And then you had Shiba Shintaro from Three Wonders, which I have also done as a classic game before.

1341
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
So there you go.

1342
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:22,000
You also have another character who is made for the game.

1343
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Simone, who actually has a lot similar with Lin Kurosawa from Alien vs. Predator, the arcade beat-em-up.

1344
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:48,000
And then as an enemy character, you have Vega, who was known as Balrog in Japan, the bullfighter guy.

1345
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:56,000
At any rate, you know, Cannon's Bike had an interesting reception to it.

1346
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,000
It was very well received in Japan.

1347
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,000
It was considered by a game machine.

1348
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:08,000
It was listed to be the second most successful arcade game of the year.

1349
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:16,000
And in the US, it pretty much got average ratings.

1350
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Hamitsu gave it a 30 out of 40.

1351
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Game Informer said it was average.

1352
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Metacritic really rates it as average.

1353
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:28,000
But it is one of those little neat games.

1354
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,000
I personally thought it was really a lot of fun, you know.

1355
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:38,000
And the crossover for other Capcom games was always a fun little addition to it.

1356
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,000
You know, I always thought it was a little bit of fun.

1357
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:48,000
It's kind of one of those not super appreciated and not very, I'd say, well-remembered games.

1358
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:52,000
But it did get some good ratings from some other resources.

1359
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:58,000
It got an 8.8 from IGN.

1360
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:03,000
It got an 88% from GameFan.

1361
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:10,000
You know, like I said, a 30% from Hamitsu, which Hamitsu is notoriously stingy in their reviews.

1362
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,000
But, you know, it was a fun one.

1363
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:20,000
You know, if you haven't checked it out, you might enjoy it if you have a Dreamcast or a Dreamcast emulator or something.

1364
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:26,000
But Cannon Spike was just, I think it really fell under the radar for a lot of people.

1365
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:33,000
And, you know, maybe I'll hook up my Dreamcast and see if I can stream it or something because I have a copy.

1366
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
I haven't played it in a while.

1367
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Sorry, Jamie, I'm going to be honest.

1368
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I did not know this game before you picked it.

1369
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
What?

1370
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I did not.

1371
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
And you know what, in looking at chat, I'm not alone.

1372
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Pixel Pacas, who I know follows games very closely.

1373
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Cannon Spike looks like great fun.

1374
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
I've never seen it before.

1375
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Black Come Pat, who I know has been podcasting nearly as long as we have, says this is one I'm not familiar with.

1376
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
We'll have to check it out.

1377
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Yeah, I mean, when you talk about this game fell under the radar, girl, you're right.

1378
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,000
That's an underestimation.

1379
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:14,000
I think it's really neat that Charlie and Cami and some familiar faces are in it.

1380
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Maybe somebody showed this to me for a hot minute in college, but I do not remember it.

1381
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,000
But that's the point of the segment.

1382
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Well, you know what, Rob, I think you should come over someday when you're feeling safe.

1383
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Yeah.

1384
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:33,000
And we should just hook up the Dreamcast and just stream random Dreamcast shit.

1385
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
We really should.

1386
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
I would really love that.

1387
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:42,000
I did risky behavior today because I was on a film set.

1388
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Everything was protocol followed, but, you know, but maybe in a week or two.

1389
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Yeah, I'd love to do that.

1390
01:42:50,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Yeah, but I mean, and the other thing, too, as you can see in the long play that we have going on right now is you have all kinds of different scenarios and scenes as well.

1391
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Like if my timing is right, looking at this, like we're on a Ghouls and Ghosts themed level, you know, with zombies in the undead and delightful little horrors.

1392
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:25,000
But, you know, the questmaster actually put something in chat that I wasn't too aware of because I just thought, you know, this game would be kind of like cheat pile.

1393
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:31,000
But apparently it's sought after by collectors and go to copy.

1394
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,000
So, gosh, maybe I should sell it.

1395
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
I'm kidding.

1396
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
I'm kidding.

1397
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Kidding.

1398
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,000
You know, you know what?

1399
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:43,000
I just found out that I was looking up Guardian Legend for getting the album art.

1400
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:51,000
And apparently, like there's copies of it selling now for for the Bucks and I have mine in the box.

1401
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:56,000
But I mean, but this it's just a delightful little piece of fun.

1402
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,000
You know that that's all I can say about it, you know?

1403
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:09,000
And I'll be honest, I truly am surprised that people, at least listeners of our show, haven't haven't heard of it.

1404
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:12,000
And I'm not saying that in a judgmental kind of way.

1405
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Trust me, I will judge you for far many other things than just hearing of this game.

1406
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Right.

1407
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:25,000
But the game, you know, I kind of thought that a lot of people had heard of it, you know, especially with as many Dreamcast aficionados as I know.

1408
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Well, that's the beautiful thing about this segment is, you know, hey, remember this?

1409
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:34,000
And sometimes the answer is going to be, actually, I don't remember this.

1410
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Yeah.

1411
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Well, well, then, you know, if if you can find a copy or a way to play it, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, say no more.

1412
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Not in that manner, though.

1413
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Give it a try.

1414
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
You know, pretty, pretty fun.

1415
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Pretty cute.

1416
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,000
I think I will.

1417
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Well, three hundred bucks for that really orange.

1418
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Right.

1419
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Oh, hey.

1420
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
And you know what?

1421
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Take a look at your own collections.

1422
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:06,000
You never know what you're going to have that'll, you know, pay a quarter of your mortgage one month.

1423
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Right.

1424
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,000
No kidding.

1425
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:13,000
I think I still have a black stripe Final Fantasy seven somewhere.

1426
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:18,000
You know, what's funny about that is that we had loaned mine to somebody and they never gave it back.

1427
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:24,000
And then I bought the release of it and then we got another another one.

1428
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
And now I have a Japanese one.

1429
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Oh, wow.

1430
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Yeah, I have a black stripe symphony of the night somewhere, too.

1431
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,000
So it's just.

1432
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Oh, well, yeah, we know, you know, of course.

1433
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:39,000
We also have the Japanese special edition that came with the art book and the music CD and all of that.

1434
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:44,000
And I think, you know, this whole little talk about, you know, what you never know in your collection, what's worth.

1435
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:50,000
I think that's why some of us and maybe again, this is gamers of a certain age and this is my get off my lawn moment.

1436
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:59,000
But I think that's why there's some of us that are a little slower to move to digital, because we do still see a lot of that value in physical stuff.

1437
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Not to say, you know, folks in the younger generation don't see the value in that.

1438
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
You know what I mean?

1439
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:13,000
But it's just kind of one of those like, gosh, you know, like when I do everything digital, I don't have that cool little thing in my collection that I never knew was rare.

1440
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:17,000
You know, but I guess at the same time, I'm saying all that.

1441
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:24,000
But yet you have companies like Limited Run Games, where the whole point is to make collectibles, you know, of video gaming.

1442
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:28,000
So not everything is digital, I suppose.

1443
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Anyway, there it is.

1444
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Well, I was also go ahead.

1445
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Sorry. Well, I was also going to say, you know, on the same token, I know that the games are going to take up some space, though.

1446
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,000
But, you know, set yourself a dedicated area for it.

1447
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:52,000
If you can't collect, you know, have big, massive collections, then pick something that you love and hold on to that.

1448
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,000
You know, if you're super excited, I'm just going to throw this out there.

1449
01:46:55,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Say that you love every Final Fantasy game and that's your big love, then definitely get hard copies of everything.

1450
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
You know, that is your collection.

1451
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:09,000
You don't have to have a whole room dedicated to it.

1452
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:15,000
But you don't necessarily have to not have a room dedicated to it.

1453
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
It's OK if you do.

1454
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:23,000
I mean, thankfully Dan's office needs are a lot more minimal than mine.

1455
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:32,000
But yeah, his office is in the game room, although now we have two CRTs hooked up and, you know, we still have the Saturn hooked up.

1456
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:36,000
The vault is coming along.

1457
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
It's getting some new life.

1458
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
But anyway, Canon Spike.

1459
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Yes, there it is. Your classic game of the week, Canon Spike. There it is.

1460
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
All right.

1461
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Speaking of collectibles and collections growing out of hand, do you know what my fucking husband did today?

1462
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Oh, do tell, do tell.

1463
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:57,000
So he had to go to Costco because our Keurig machine finally went kaput.

1464
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,000
So he was like, all right, I'll get a new one from Costco or whatever.

1465
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:06,000
And he sends me a picture in Costco of a super Pac-Man arcade one up machine.

1466
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:11,000
And it just says, you know, husband with a super Pac-Man arcade one up machine.

1467
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:15,000
And I'm like, OK, you're open. You're opening a door.

1468
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
You do not want to fucking open.

1469
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Number one, I am telling Dan right now, super Pac-Man.

1470
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
It's a dark soccer.

1471
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:26,000
I looked for it online and I couldn't figure out why am I not finding a super Pac-Man online?

1472
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Super Pac-Man arcade one up is a Costco exclusive.

1473
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,000
That's why he saw it there.

1474
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,000
So, yeah, right.

1475
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:42,000
So he sent me that picture and I'm like, that is a fucking door you don't want to open.

1476
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Like, if you tease me with that, we're going to have one of those and you're going to be mad because that's going to come out of the house fund.

1477
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
And that's just that much longer.

1478
01:48:52,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Listen, this is why we don't have an Xbox Series X is because now I have all of these arcade games behind me.

1479
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Oh, no. Oh, no, I'd have both.

1480
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Well, girl, you've seen my house.

1481
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:17,000
I know we actually are trying to decide, like we need to get rid of four pins so that our house can kind of go back to normal.

1482
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Although Dan needs to fix the Mustang and put it somewhere, you know, so we're making some pretty tough decisions about about all that stuff.

1483
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Yeah, no. And I you know, I and I'm saying this all in good fun because obviously I think it's great that he he finds those things that like triggers my, you know, wallet need to spend money type of thing and taunts me with it.

1484
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:51,000
And who knows? Someday, I mean, once we do get past the house stuff, if there's still money left over, I would love nothing more than to fill up the fucking house with more arcade one up cabinets.

1485
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,000
And you better believe Super Pac-Man towards the top of my list.

1486
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,000
That's easily in like my top five machines I'd like to have.

1487
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Looking what Bobby said just now.

1488
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Yeah, you know what it is, Bobby? Bobby, it's a clone.

1489
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:09,000
I believe you might fact check me on this, please. I'm inviting Bobby Black Wolf to check fact check me.

1490
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:18,000
It doesn't happen often. I believe it is the same lineup as the 40th anniversary Pac-Man that is being sold on the official website.

1491
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:30,000
But they have flipped the arcade art and the cabinet art to be Super Pac-Man as opposed to the wood grain Pac-Man because there already is a Pac-Man one up cabinet, but it has less gains.

1492
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:35,000
And I think it's just a plain black cabinet. But the 40th anniversary is like a wood grain thing.

1493
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:40,000
And it does look nice, but I believe this isn't reskinned one of those, but it's Super Pac-Man skin.

1494
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Well, I did tell Dan, so we'll see what happens.

1495
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:48,000
And the same thing with NBA Jam. They did a championship edition that was in Costco.

1496
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Yeah, he sent me a picture of that one, too. And it looks good.

1497
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:59,000
If I if I had I would love NBA Jam, but there's you have to draw the fucking line.

1498
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:10,000
And yeah, Bobby points out and this is important. It's not just Pac-Man. It also has Galaga, Galaxian and Dig Dug. And those games are fucking awesome, too.

1499
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Really? So it's OK. I'm I'm glad I had Bobby fact check me. I am wrong. It is not a reskin.

1500
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:24,000
The 40th anniversary does not have Galaxian and Dig Dug. It instead has Pac and Pal.

1501
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:29,000
And. Which is terrible. Pac-Man Plus, which is also terrible.

1502
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:33,000
That Super Pac-Man machine is way better as far as the game lineup goes.

1503
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:37,000
It really depends on if you have to have the aesthetic of the wood grain cabinet or not, I think.

1504
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:46,000
So for me, again, you make your own damn opinion when it comes to what you're going to spend 400, 500 bucks on, however much these arcade cabinets are.

1505
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:54,000
I wonder how much was it? Did he tell me? I got to find out. Sorry, guys, this is excellent live radio.

1506
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:59,000
I believe it was four ninety nine. I could be wrong, but let's see on a three ninety nine.

1507
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Sorry, he said three ninety nine is the price. Maybe we won't get that.

1508
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Yeah, but I'm I'm wait, wait, wait for those price drops. I hope so. I hope so.

1509
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:12,000
All right. Anyway, let's move on from talking about those machines.

1510
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Maybe, maybe we'll be talking about arcade one up machines again in our rapid fire news segment.

1511
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge. Let's get into some rapid fire news we have tonight, starting with Loki.

1512
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Yes. So there is something that also preordered this week, and that was Mario Kart Live home circuit is one hundred dollars.

1513
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:37,000
You got one, though. Congrats. One hundred dollars for each starter set.

1514
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Yeah. So it's one hundred dollars. You can either choose from Mario or Green Mario and it comes with the different.

1515
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Hold up, hold up, hold up. What? You can do Mario or Green Mario.

1516
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,000
It's Luigi. That's Green Mario. It's a joke.

1517
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Oh, OK. So you can't agree. What is Nintendo calling it? Luigi? Was that your little joke?

1518
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:08,000
OK. It was my joke. OK. Because I was about to go off. I was I was like, Jamie, hold my earrings.

1519
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:13,000
I'm like, why would you not just do Luigi? OK. All right.

1520
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:17,000
It's Mario and Luigi. Each one is is a hundred dollars.

1521
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:23,000
You need a separate switch for each one in order to play two players. So, you know, that can happen.

1522
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:30,000
But yeah, it comes with like it looks like a bunch of different checkpoint areas and then like some cardboard arrows as well.

1523
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:36,000
The car and then a recharge, you know, like a charge cable. I think the software itself is actually going to be free to download.

1524
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:44,000
So that's going to be a thing as well. But, yeah, since coming out October 16th.

1525
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:48,000
All right. You know what? That's less than I thought it would be, especially when you look at the price of those Legos.

1526
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:54,000
I totally thought it was going to be like 40 for the game and then like another likes like,

1527
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:59,000
I guess I was about to say 60 for the car, which I guess is the same price. But somehow in my head I had it up to one hundred and twenty dollars.

1528
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:07,000
I thought it was going to cost one hundred twenty. Yeah. So those.

1529
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Yeah, we have almost all of those sets, too. Yeah. Yeah, I know. Right.

1530
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:16,000
So you should see we just put together one with King Boo on it today.

1531
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:21,000
That was another thing the husband tried to tempt me with last time we were at Target was like, oh, look down this aisle.

1532
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:26,000
They have those Nintendo Legos. Don't they look fun? Like, stop it. Stop it.

1533
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Aren't you? Aren't you? What you're supposed to do is you're supposed to make sure I don't see that.

1534
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:35,000
I always supposed to say, oh, look over here at these other things.

1535
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:39,000
All right. Anyway, let's see.

1536
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Bobby Black Wolf talking about collecting, saying I actually worked on the room that we're turning into our arcade this weekend.

1537
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:50,000
It's the last storage room from when we moved in. Found some more gaming VHS tapes that I might want to digitize.

1538
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Maybe I can do a vogue stream playing old video game VHS promo tapes.

1539
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Pretty cool. All right. Anyway, sorry. Moving on. Rapid fire news. Sorry, Loki.

1540
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:09,000
All right. And so aside from that, it looks like we have gotten news that way forward and Arc Systems are going to be bringing out a game based on Ruby,

1541
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:17,000
which is, of course, the animation that's by Rooster Teeth and it's been out for quite a while now.

1542
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:24,000
But yeah, so that sounds pretty awesome coming from those two and definitely the type of style of a game.

1543
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:29,000
I could definitely see that from them. That's supposed to be coming out sometime 2021.

1544
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:35,000
So hopefully we'll get some more information about that soon. All right.

1545
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Well, moving on to some rapid fire I have. This is one of those things where I was like, oh, I saw this and I was like, this is interesting.

1546
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:47,000
You guys all know like the lottery, right? They probably they haven't I think almost every state has one some type of lottery.

1547
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:53,000
I think there's one or two states that don't. But you probably still familiar with it is that it's like a state state sanctioned gambling, basically.

1548
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:57,000
And here in California, we have our own lottery and they have the number picker thing.

1549
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:05,000
But they also have these things called scratchers. And again, I'm not advertising for them, especially because it is, again, just basically state sanctioned gambling.

1550
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:15,000
However, I would be remiss not to mention this caught my eye was that there is a large advertising push going on here in California with the lottery for Pac-Man scratchers.

1551
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:20,000
That's right. So I guess for a limited time, we have some Pac-Man 40th anniversary scratcher cards.

1552
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:25,000
And if you want to see these for yourself, again, I hate that I'm doing an advertisement for a gambling thing,

1553
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:33,000
but I'm going to say Pac-Man scratchers dot com is where you can see what some of these look like, whether you are or not in California.

1554
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:38,000
I it has been brought to my attention. Some other states have also done like Pac-Man things in their lottery.

1555
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:43,000
I think Virginia did one last year. I bring this one up because I noticed the advertising push.

1556
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:50,000
It was a huge billboard I saw while driving today and also that it's kind of time to the 40th anniversary.

1557
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:55,000
But there's some different scratcher cards. So one of them you kind of scratch symbols and goes as a whole Pac-Man theme.

1558
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:59,000
There's another one. It's a five dollar scratcher card. Remember when scratch cards were a buck?

1559
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Now they're like all sorts of numbers. So there's a five dollar maze card where you basically,

1560
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:11,000
you know, scratch and as Pac-Man goes through a maze and hopefully you hit money and not a ghost.

1561
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:16,000
And then there's a ten dollar card where you play like a bunch of scratcher games all at once. It's all Pac-Man themed.

1562
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:23,000
I have to do it. What's that video of me doing one? Oh, do you do a video doing one?

1563
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:28,000
No, why not? I might do that. That might be fun. I think you don't win if you don't play.

1564
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Do you know like there's a huge thing on YouTube for like slot machine YouTubers and basically people that gamble on YouTube?

1565
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:41,000
It's like a huge industry. But just be careful y'all play responsibly.

1566
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:46,000
And if you think you have a problem, please speak up and don't get a gambling addiction.

1567
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:51,000
But I would say just as a collectible, I think it would be fun to own one of these.

1568
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Wouldn't that be funny if I like had a collectible and I like refused to scratch it off and it's like a grand prize winner?

1569
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:03,000
But you would never know it's Schrodinger's cat, except it's Schrodinger's Pac-Man scratcher.

1570
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:08,000
You would never know. That's right. That's right. So anyway, let's see.

1571
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Sometimes it's the anticipation that's the more fun part of doing those things, you know?

1572
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:20,000
And then when you finally get whatever, it's like, OK, what's up?

1573
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Orange right in chat says, oh, yeah, one of the last family parties, one of my aunts sat everyone down to watch someone play a slot machine.

1574
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:30,000
I have a friend that's super into this guy that plays slot machines on YouTube.

1575
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:34,000
And she goes to like conventions in Vegas about this guy on YouTube.

1576
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:43,000
And they they will play they do this thing where they pool their money so that everybody gets one pull on like a high dollar slot machine.

1577
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:47,000
And they all split up the prize that comes out. I thought that was interesting.

1578
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Yeah. Listen, we can we used to do that with with when at my old job, we would do that with a lottery.

1579
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Yeah. Yeah. Sounds same kind of thing. Like the lottery pool.

1580
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Yeah. So, guys, if I'm you know, one day I decide to retire from video gaming and, you know, all is behind us and all that stuff.

1581
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:11,000
And I'm I'm on Medicare and all that. Would you watch my YouTube videos if I was a slot machine YouTuber?

1582
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:17,000
I'd let you get broke. That sounds like the life. We let you get broke, Rob.

1583
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Grandpa playing Konami slot machines. It's adjacent. It's gaming.

1584
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:31,000
All right. You you get on with your bad self. I thought about it. I thought about it.

1585
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Phoenix 77 in chat says, Rob, you should become a V tuber. What's a V tuber or did you meant to say Y tuber like YouTuber?

1586
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:45,000
I know. Well, I'm trying to do more on YouTube and do more stuff for Vogue that will I mean, Twitch is video content, isn't it?

1587
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:51,000
All right. Anyway, all virtual YouTuber. Really, I have to learn more about that.

1588
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Look, look, I'm impressed that we actually got a project off the ground and let's see if it can hold for a couple months here.

1589
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:02,000
OK, then we'll talk about new projects. All right.

1590
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Is that the YouTuber thing where like they you basically have the animation capture thing where you can like make yourself a chibi anime girl if you wanted to or something?

1591
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,000
I think so. I've seen that on Twitch.

1592
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:22,000
You can do a lot of things. You can be a furry. You can be you can be a lot of things. I see people do it on Twitch all the time. It's not just YouTube.

1593
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:28,000
All right. Anyhow, I don't know if you can turn yourself into an eight bit character, though, probably.

1594
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:35,000
But I know you can. In a game I was talking about last week, Avicii and Vector, right? The music game featuring the music of Avicii.

1595
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:42,000
There is a code that has been released. I love shit like this. I love in 2020 we're talking about an unlock code. Fuck yeah.

1596
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:48,000
You put in this code on the main menu up, down, down, down, down, down, down, A.

1597
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:53,000
So that's up six downs and A. So sorry, it's not up, up, down, down.

1598
02:00:54,000 --> 02:01:02,000
So you do up, down six times and A and it will unlock an eight bit version of Wake Me Up, probably one of his best known songs.

1599
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:09,000
And the little when you play the game with it, it's an eight bit style, which is pretty rad.

1600
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:16,000
So yeah, you know what? Kudos for something that you could have done as DLC, but you didn't.

1601
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:21,000
You did it as an unlock code, as a throwback. Classy, classy props to you.

1602
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:24,000
All right. Moving on, Dark Sakura.

1603
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:34,000
Well, there are, you know, we kind of went over the one up thing a little bit earlier, you know, with that Super Pac-Man, like you mentioned.

1604
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Well, there's another one coming out. It's Golden Axe Arcade One Up, and it's actually already available, actually, as of the 17th.

1605
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:53,000
And it includes, dun, dun, dun, Golden Axe, Golden Axe, The Revenge of Death Adder, Shinobi, Altered Beast and Wrestle War.

1606
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Dude, if I had this, I would want it completely skinned for Shinobi, though. That would just be so rad.

1607
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:09,000
And then also they are the arcade ROMs licensed directly from Sega and it's $399.

1608
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Also, there's a Humble Bundle out that I'm kind of thinking of putting some money into.

1609
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:21,000
It's called You Can Pet the Dog for all the good boys.

1610
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:33,000
So basically this particular Humble Bundle is offering you a bunch of games that will put the proceeds back to various animal charities.

1611
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:41,000
So the $1 unlock will have Scribblenauts Unlimited, Beyond Eyes, Dog Sled Saga and Bulb Boy.

1612
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:50,000
If you do over $4.71, you get Shenmue 1 and 2, where the water tastes like wine and death's gambit.

1613
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Over $12, it gets Blair Witch.

1614
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Bonuses include Bulb Boy soundtrack and Dog Sled Saga soundtrack.

1615
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Some of the charities included are Sweet Farm, Humane Society of the United States and Best Friends Animal Society.

1616
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:13,000
So I, as a cat person, can buy this because I know cats will be helped as well.

1617
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:20,000
All right. What a clever idea for a bundle, quite honestly. I think it's great.

1618
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:24,000
I think it's funny that Shenmue is included because, I mean, You Pet the Dog.

1619
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Yeah. All right.

1620
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,000
You Pet the Dog.

1621
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Well, let's move on and see if there's any games coming out this week where you might be able to pet the dog or a cat.

1622
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Come on. There's cat people too, or maybe other animals as well.

1623
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. Let's start with Loki in the US.

1624
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Yeah. I'm not sure if you can pet dogs in any of these, but let's see what we've got.

1625
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:52,000
So we have a Halo 3 ODST. So that's coming to PC and Android.

1626
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:57,000
13 Sentinels, a GS rim on PlayStation 4.

1627
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Giga Force on PC and PlayStation 4.

1628
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 Complete Edition on PC and Nintendo Switch.

1629
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:10,000
And if I remember correctly, I believe that is the free game that's going to be next week on the Epic Games Store, by the way.

1630
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Oh, really?

1631
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Serious Sam. Yeah, I saw that because I was showing my kids.

1632
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:19,000
I was like, Hey, I'm like, you got to put this in your library.

1633
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Serious Sam 4 on PC and Stadia.

1634
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Vampire the Masquerade Night Road on PC, Mac and Linux, iOS, Android and Web browser,

1635
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:37,000
which I assume would be considered in all of these because I can't think of something that would not be part of those.

1636
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Mafia Definitive Edition on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1637
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:49,000
And last but not least on PC, Panzer Dragoon remake.

1638
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:53,000
That's it. I was like, isn't that already out, but not on PC yet.

1639
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. I gotcha.

1640
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Well, traveling over to Japan, we have the Japanese releases and coming out.

1641
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:03,000
It's been a few weeks of slowness in Japan, but things are starting to pick back up this week.

1642
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:08,000
We have quite a few releases on the Nintendo Switch this week, including Wagamama High Spec.

1643
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:14,000
KonoSuba, God's blessing on this wonderful world.

1644
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Love for this tempting attire.

1645
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Yes, that is the full name of the game and that is coming out in a regular and limited edition this week.

1646
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:25,000
I was trying to see, is that like another like manga looking game?

1647
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Yeah, I think it is.

1648
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:28,000
I'm here for it.

1649
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Yep. All right. So there's that.

1650
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Let's see. Also out on the Switch this week is Dungreed and Ikaruga is getting a release on the Switch this week in Japan.

1651
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Cool, cool.

1652
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Ikaruga is on everything. It's on my toaster.

1653
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
I know. I know.

1654
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Does it have Doom? Does it have Ikaruga?

1655
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
All right. Does it have Skyrim?

1656
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:56,000
All right. And then on the PlayStation 4, we have Date Alive, Ren Dystopia, also on regular and limited edition.

1657
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Oni Chambara Origin is also out this week.

1658
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Ikagi 2 in regular and limited edition.

1659
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Is it Ikagi?

1660
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
I think you're right. I think it's Ikagi.

1661
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Thank you.

1662
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Why don't you do Japanese?

1663
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Have we talked about you doing Japanese releases for the longest time?

1664
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Just switching.

1665
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Well, I mean, but it's good practice for you, Rob.

1666
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
For that Japanese class, I'm not taking.

1667
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Yes. All right.

1668
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Funny enough, I'm on a 56 day streak on Duolingo, just saying.

1669
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Oh, good job. Good job.

1670
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:38,000
You know what? And I think the listeners have just over the past 10 years we've been doing release dates regularly have just become used to me flubbing all the Japanese words.

1671
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
It's part of the charm, I guess.

1672
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:47,000
All right. Anyway, also on the PlayStation 4, F1 2020 and Ikaruga also on the PlayStation 4 this week.

1673
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
All the Ikaruga now available.

1674
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:52,000
How about the UK, DarkSakura?

1675
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Well, let's see if I pronounce it right.

1676
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
Stop it now.

1677
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:02,000
On the 22nd, we have 13 Sentinels Aegis Rim.

1678
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
We have, or Aegis.

1679
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:09,000
On the 24th, we have Total War Three Kingdoms Royal Edition.

1680
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:12,000
On the 25th, a few things. We have Monstrum.

1681
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:16,000
We have PGA Tour 2K21.

1682
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:19,000
Big Bobby Car, The Big Race.

1683
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Adam's Venture Origins.

1684
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:27,000
We have Do Not Feed the Monkeys, which I think is a great name and I have no idea what it's about.

1685
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Port Royale 4.

1686
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:36,000
Jamie, I'm going to guess that in the game you don't want to feed the monkeys, no matter how bad they ask.

1687
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Just a guess. Hypothetically.

1688
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Now I'm thinking of Don't Know What the Monkeys Won't Do from Animaniacs.

1689
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Wasn't there a game or something or a website or something called Don't Push the Button?

1690
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
I think, yeah.

1691
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:58,000
I feel like that's a game somewhere where you just put a big button in the middle and it's Don't Push the Button.

1692
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:01,000
If I told you, I'd give you a clue.

1693
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:04,000
I think that's how the lyrics went. Oh my god, I love the monkey song.

1694
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:11,000
Anyway, Troll Hunters, Defenders of Arcadia, Mafia Definitive Edition, and Mafia Trilogy.

1695
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Stephanie.

1696
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Alright.

1697
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:19,000
We've got a few more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the listener roundtable for tonight.

1698
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:24,000
I know we have a couple emails tonight, so that'll be good, and your other topics as presented in chat.

1699
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:27,000
But first, some updates on another game, right, Logie?

1700
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:33,000
Yep, so Fall Guys is getting some more updates in between the Season 1 and Season 2 of content.

1701
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:40,000
So now for their latest patch, they're actually remixing some of the older levels, so that's pretty cool.

1702
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:50,000
So along with that, though, there's going to be some interesting developments regarding cheaters.

1703
02:08:50,000 --> 02:09:01,000
So what they've been doing with folks cheating in the game is they've been putting them off in their own little island with the other cheaters so they can all play games together.

1704
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:02,000
I love how they do that.

1705
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Grand Theft Auto V, they did that similar with that, and I know there's been other games that have kind of banished cheaters to their own little area with other cheaters, but I think that's kind of funny.

1706
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:19,000
I wish I could almost watch people play that, but yeah, so that's a new thing.

1707
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:26,000
So hopefully cheaters will be just sent to their own cheater banishment, and you'll never have to see them again.

1708
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Bye.

1709
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Although I don't think the cheater island thing lasted very long, sadly. I think everybody on cheater island figured out they were on cheater island.

1710
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Yeah.

1711
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Anyway, here's my question for chat, really, and anybody on the panel who wants to answer it.

1712
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Now that Among Us is like the big craze, are people still crazy on Fall Guys? Or did everybody leave that behind for Among Us?

1713
02:09:54,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Because I feel like overnight on Twitch, the rankings just changed, and now Among Us is that game that showed up number one.

1714
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:08,000
So who out there is still playing Fall Guys on the regular? Just curious.

1715
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Alright.

1716
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:14,000
ActDef says, I still am crazy for Fall Guys. Okay, good. Good.

1717
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:17,000
I need to play more Fall Guys. I haven't done it in a while.

1718
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Yeah. You know, I noticed Alan was playing Fall Guys pretty hardcore for a bit, but you know what?

1719
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:28,000
I don't know if I talked about this on a previous show. In fact, I feel like I hear him in the other room, and he's probably playing this game right now.

1720
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Dead by Daylight is like the thing that he got super into.

1721
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
I got my Steam notification from that.

1722
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
Oh, he plays all the time.

1723
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Yeah.

1724
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Blackcompat does point out Fall Guys is still popular though. Yeah, it hasn't fallen out of the top ten or anything.

1725
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:57,000
But I'm glad the game is getting updates because I do feel like it's the type of game that kind of needs these regular updates to keep people going back and looking and checking it out and keeping it towards the top of the list in the face of other things and so forth.

1726
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Shehulk10 in chat says, why do people cheat playing online games?

1727
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Unfortunately, people just want to troll because they want a reaction. And the problem is, and this is the weird thing for me, in a game like Fall Guys, you're not going to see a reaction, but it's kind of that whole like, you know you're getting one.

1728
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:25,000
And it's like, I'm sitting here and I'm trolling and this person's gonna be so mad and it's really funny.

1729
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:29,000
So, all right.

1730
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:35,000
Anyway, Fifth Dream in chat says, I barely played Fall Guys, but my friend wanted me to play Among Us on Twitch with her today.

1731
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:42,000
SHO 100 Matt says, current stats, Among Us, 315k viewers, Fall Guys, 13.3k viewers.

1732
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:58,000
But 13.3k is still a lot. Like I kind of, you know, I'm not, now I feel like I've shaded the game and that's not what I'm trying to do. I'm just saying like, I just feel like this game was everywhere last month and now it's like, it's there.

1733
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:02,000
It's still there, but you know, PUBG is still there.

1734
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Anyway, I just sound like I'm being mean and I'm really not trying to be.

1735
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:12,000
All right, moving on. Let's talk about, yeah, just wait till the new content update drops, says Questbuster.

1736
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:18,000
That's probably the, you're right, when these things drop, it's gonna shoot right back up in the rankings because everybody's gonna be trying to get new costumes, that's for sure.

1737
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:29,000
Let's move on and talk about some updates. This was kind of hinted at earlier in the show, but we have more NES and SNES games slated for Nintendo Online.

1738
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:34,000
And the Switch Online, the classic console stuff that you should get with your Nintendo Online account.

1739
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:38,000
So there are some game updates coming this week on September 23rd.

1740
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:46,000
On the Super Nintendo, brand new games you're gonna see in the library are Donkey Kong Country 2, Diddy Kong's Quest.

1741
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:51,000
Makes sense, we just got Donkey Kong Country 1 in the last update, so it's time for number 2.

1742
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Hopefully Bobby Blackwell's paying attention because I know he loves these games.

1743
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Mario's Super P-Cross.

1744
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:04,000
I wasn't even aware they had a P-Cross game on Super Nintendo, but it looks like it's one of those games that was only ever released in Japan.

1745
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:10,000
They actually didn't release it here, but they're still putting it on the online service, kind of like Puyo Puyo.

1746
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:14,000
They did that with Puyo Puyo, and I feel like one other game they did that with as well.

1747
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:19,000
Oh, lost levels on the NES side.

1748
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:25,000
They put out the Mario 2 ROM and just made up a lost levels box art for it, so interesting.

1749
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Anyway, also on the Super Nintendo, the Peacekeepers, which I don't remember this game.

1750
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Wasn't it? I think it's a take, I think it's like a Final Fight clone, like that type of game.

1751
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:39,000
But anyway, I don't remember it, I gotta be honest.

1752
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:44,000
And on the NES side, there's one new game, but it's SCAT.

1753
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:50,000
That's right, they released a game called SCAT for the 8-bit Nintendo.

1754
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:54,000
But it stands for Special Cybernetic Attack Team.

1755
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:59,000
I'm sorry, it does not stand for Sacramento's Cosplay and Tournament.

1756
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:03,000
Well remembered, oh my god.

1757
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:06,000
That was some stuff.

1758
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:09,000
That predates OLR, doesn't it?

1759
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
It kind of does.

1760
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:16,000
I think the SCAT tournament was, which yes, was Sacramento's Cosplay and Tournament.

1761
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:21,000
I believe that was when, yeah, because I was living at the Crazy House then.

1762
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:24,000
And OLR didn't start until I was at the next place.

1763
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,000
Yeah.

1764
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
Wow, wow. Alright.

1765
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Anyhow, Japan, I want to just kind of add to this.

1766
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:34,000
Because, and I've mentioned this a million times on the show, but just if you're not already aware.

1767
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:37,000
You can get to Japan's library very easily.

1768
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:42,000
You just have to create a Japanese account, which is very easy to do with a throwaway email address.

1769
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:50,000
And then you just go into the store and download the Japanese versions of Famicom online and Super Famicom online.

1770
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:56,000
And you can play all the Japanese versions, which I would highly recommend you do for things like Metroid.

1771
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:02,000
And things that really were different because of the way the Famicom was with the extra sound chip versus the NES.

1772
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
It's really worth looking into.

1773
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:08,000
But, if you have the Japanese one, you're going to get some different titles.

1774
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:11,000
Donkey Kong Country 2 is still one of them.

1775
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:19,000
But they're also going to be getting on the Super Nintendo Fire Emblem, Mystery of the Emblem, Super Tennis, and Wild Guns.

1776
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:22,000
I believe Super Tennis and Wild Guns were released in the US previously.

1777
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:27,000
But if you want to play that Fire Emblem game, you'll have to do that through the Japanese store.

1778
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Because that game has some heavy Japanese in it, and I don't think they're going to translate it ever for this side.

1779
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:37,000
But if you have working enough knowledge of Japanese, it might be up your alley.

1780
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Pretty cool.

1781
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:44,000
Alright. Moving on. Let's go to Dark Sakura.

1782
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Well, oh my goodness.

1783
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:54,000
So, there is, well, I hope this is real.

1784
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:57,000
You know, we've had good things come from it before.

1785
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:08,000
But there is a Portuguese retailer that is listing Mass Effect trilogy remastered for PS4, Xbox One, and Switch.

1786
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:15,000
I would love a remastered version for PC as well, if that happens.

1787
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:20,000
But yeah, it's going to include all three from what it shows.

1788
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:24,000
It's EA, girl. The PC thing will happen.

1789
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:29,000
Well, it's by a Portuguese retailer named Gaming Replay.

1790
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:33,000
And they have an October release window.

1791
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:47,000
But it was reported that Electronic Arts would be releasing a Mass Effect trilogy remastered in fiscal year 2021, which would end March 31st, 2021.

1792
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:56,000
But the quote was to not expect it on Switch, at least not at first. So, we'll see.

1793
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:02,000
So, I'm not sure of a nice way to phrase this, but like, when the fuck are they going to announce this?

1794
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:11,000
Like, I know it's rumors and all that stuff, but like, this is like the fifth time we've had a substantial rumor around this Mass Effect trilogy.

1795
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
When are they just going to announce it already?

1796
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:17,000
And I thought, okay, they're just waiting for N7 day, whatever. They're trying to be cute.

1797
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:22,000
They're going to announce it on November 7th and just release it in a couple weeks, or maybe it'll be available that day.

1798
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:26,000
Or something like, it'll be a digital release that's available that day.

1799
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:32,000
But now you've got this retailer that's putting October and I'm like, that's just around the corner.

1800
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:35,000
When are they going to announce this? I don't know.

1801
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:41,000
Which, I mean, maybe that's supposed to be the announced date and put up pre-orders for it. Who knows?

1802
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Oh, maybe, maybe.

1803
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:45,000
With the final release date being November 7th.

1804
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:49,000
If I was going to market this shit, that's how I would do it.

1805
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
You know what though?

1806
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:52,000
What?

1807
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:58,000
I would get it and then definitely wait for mods to come out so I can make my Shepard look the way I want her to again.

1808
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:04,000
No OneSpecial77 in chat says, so I'm guessing Rob's getting the Mass Effect trilogy remaster.

1809
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
You better fucking believe I am.

1810
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Especially if multiplayer's coming back.

1811
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:12,000
If they made some polishing to Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.

1812
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:16,000
I will be disappointed if they remove multiplayer.

1813
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
I don't know why they do that.

1814
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:24,000
I will be disappointed if they do it, but it will not stop me from buying the collection and playing the whole goddamn thing over again.

1815
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
I'll fucking do it.

1816
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:29,000
What if they also bring back the phone utilities?

1817
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Ooh, I didn't even think of that.

1818
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:33,000
The war map or something?

1819
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:37,000
You're right, the war map on the phone. How are they going to do that?

1820
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Maybe the phone app will still work. It was all through your EA account.

1821
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:48,000
Yeah, I think it would be pretty fun. I honestly think that I'll get it.

1822
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:51,000
Oh yeah, I'll get it too. No question.

1823
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
When there's a PC release.

1824
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:58,000
Alright, moving on. A few more stories for you guys. Loki.

1825
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Alright, so let's talk about running games on systems they're not intended for.

1826
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:13,000
So Super Mario 64, as you may remember, had its source code reverse engineered.

1827
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:19,000
And so now, since they have the original source for the game, they can compile it for different systems.

1828
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:24,000
And one of the systems that's been compiled for now is the PlayStation 2.

1829
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Which, the first iteration of it was extremely buggy.

1830
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Now there's a better video out there actually of somebody speedrunning the game.

1831
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:39,000
And for the most part, aside from some texture issues with some of the transparencies and stuff, it seems to be working pretty good.

1832
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:48,000
But late breaking news also, not only is it running on the PlayStation 2, but they have now compiled it for the Dreamcast.

1833
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:51,000
It is now running natively on the Dreamcast as well.

1834
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:55,000
I saw someone post that to the VOG Network Discord right before the show tonight.

1835
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
It's also on the Dreamcast.

1836
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:00,000
And of course, you can join our Discord over at vognetwork.com.

1837
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1838
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
It will get you the invite random customer.

1839
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
The Dreamcast seems to have a whole other set of issues.

1840
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:09,000
There's no audio in that and there's a few texture issues as well.

1841
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:13,000
But some of the things like the text on screen is actually rendering fine.

1842
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
It's just some of the other stuff is not.

1843
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:19,000
So, very interesting to see this stuff kind of working on these systems.

1844
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:24,000
I mean, I guess it's not surprising since you can compile it for all these different systems and it's just code at the end of the day.

1845
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:28,000
But yeah, pretty interesting.

1846
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Yeah. I didn't even think about that as a side effect of the leak.

1847
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Like, you know, because maybe it's just I'm trying to erase that from my mind.

1848
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:39,000
Because it is pretty fucked up the source code is out there.

1849
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
No, no, no. This isn't from that.

1850
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:45,000
There's actually it's a team of people that actually reverse engineered the whole thing.

1851
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
Down to source.

1852
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:50,000
I mean, you're really still not supposed to do that.

1853
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:56,000
But it is I will acknowledge it for the technical surprise that it is, I shall say.

1854
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:01,000
But yeah, don't ever put that online or Nintendo is going to come to your house and break the door down.

1855
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
That's for sure. All right.

1856
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
Already leaked online.

1857
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
I know. Once on the Internet, always on the Internet.

1858
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:10,000
But don't be the don't be the fool to host it exclusively on their site.

1859
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:13,000
That's for sure. All right.

1860
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
One more story for you guys tonight.

1861
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:19,000
And it's about a doll who here loves dolls.

1862
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:22,000
So I know I was going to say dark soccer does.

1863
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:26,000
But no, I'm and actually this is pretty fucking cool.

1864
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Like, you know, if you're a doll fan or not, I know you all are video game fans.

1865
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:33,000
You wouldn't be listening to this show, although that is.

1866
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Is anybody out there not a video game fan listening to all?

1867
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Because I do find that kind of fascinating.

1868
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:41,000
And you should email us participate at orange on radio dot com.

1869
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:47,000
Anyway, a doll company and I've never heard of this company, but apparently they make premium dolls.

1870
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:50,000
American Girl is the name of the company around.

1871
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:53,000
I mean, it's been a big part of a lot of people's childhood.

1872
02:21:53,000 --> 02:22:02,000
OK. Yeah. You know, when I saw the picture, I was like, oh, that looks it looks a little bit like a much nicer version of kid sister.

1873
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:07,000
Do you remember my buddy and kid sister or like Cabbage Patch or something like that?

1874
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Yeah, but these are way above Cabbage Patch, like that doll.

1875
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I gotcha. I gotcha.

1876
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:17,000
The Mercedes. An American Girl doll looks like a Mercedes Benz.

1877
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:20,000
And it fucking gets you up to speed.

1878
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:24,000
Where we're American girls, then they have book lines.

1879
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:28,000
They've had movies. I'm pretty sure they've had TV shows.

1880
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:29,000
So it's that's been.

1881
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:34,000
And they've done a lot to forward social issues and women's rights issues.

1882
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
It's pretty amazing.

1883
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:43,000
And a lot of their the material that they put out, they've done a lot of research to make sure it's culturally accurate,

1884
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:48,000
including even getting for their Native American American girl.

1885
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:53,000
They've been they worked directly with the tribe she's supposed to represent.

1886
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:56,000
And so, yeah, they're they're amazing.

1887
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:59,000
But keep going with your story, because I have an addendum to that.

1888
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:05,000
I'm learning a lot on this show tonight. I put this in here because I was like, oh, it's dolls meets video games.

1889
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:08,000
How often do we get to talk about that? But I'm learning a lot. All right.

1890
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Anyway, American Girl is releasing an arcade game gal as part of their historical characters line.

1891
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:19,000
It is a total 80s girl. The dolly is very old.

1892
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:23,000
I know, right. Courtney Moore is the name of the doll.

1893
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:26,000
And she definitely looks like a California Valley girl from the 80s.

1894
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
But here's the thing. And this is this is what I'm getting to.

1895
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:32,000
She has a Pac-Man machine that she's with.

1896
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:36,000
And you would expect that the Pac-Man is machine would just be like, OK, cute.

1897
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:39,000
It's a doll with a machine. But here's the thing.

1898
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:43,000
Not only is the doll 18 inches tall, which is, you know, a decent size.

1899
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:51,000
So is that little arcade machine. And that Pac-Man cabinet actually plays Pac-Man.

1900
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:56,000
It is an actual fully operational Pac-Man machine that comes with the doll.

1901
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:59,000
And that is really cool. Now, to kind of add to it,

1902
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:03,000
dark soccer was saying about some of the get it on its own, by the way, the machine.

1903
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:06,000
Oh, I didn't I didn't see that. That's really cool.

1904
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:11,000
It's only American Girl website. And I will say and I apologize if this is what you were about to say, Jamie.

1905
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:15,000
But it's part of the story I'm looking at American Girl to what you were saying a minute ago.

1906
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:22,000
They are going to match all of the customer donations to a maximum of fifty thousand dollars to the association.

1907
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Girls who code at girls who code dot com.

1908
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:31,000
It is a nonprofit org that helps women from diverse backgrounds study computer science,

1909
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:36,000
using online resources, scholar sessions and summer events.

1910
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:41,000
Also, five thousand dollar scholarships to four of the students in the program.

1911
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:46,000
So, wow. Win all around. Not bad for a doll story.

1912
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:51,000
Well, there's a little bit more to please know. It was gosh, what was it?

1913
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:58,000
A year ago, year and a half ago, they did a character named Julie who had a pinball table.

1914
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:04,000
She was the 70s girl. Oh, and the pinball actually plays.

1915
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:09,000
And, you know, and hold on, I'll find find the pinball.

1916
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:14,000
You can actually buy the pinball by itself, too. But there is the pinball one.

1917
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:17,000
And then I don't know if we put it in the in the chat room.

1918
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:21,000
But if you just look up American Girl and it's Julie Pinball, you'll find that one.

1919
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:25,000
The pinball table is one hundred twenty bucks by itself.

1920
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:30,000
Pac-Man is I think it's also about one hundred and fifty.

1921
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:34,000
Wow. For the little little Pac-Man.

1922
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:41,000
But I mean, it's fully it's fully accurate. You know, I was pretty, pretty interested.

1923
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:45,000
Meesh in chat says, shit, I don't want the doll. Just give me the frickin cabinet.

1924
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:51,000
Well, you have that option. You can buy both. You can buy one. Yeah, I'll find it and link it in chat.

1925
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:57,000
And Bobby Black Wolf in chat says a pinball table I can actually afford and see it.

1926
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Tiberius says the doll is also pretty cute. Yeah, I'm not not going to lie.

1927
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:08,000
It's a cute. I was like dolls have come a long way. And the thing about the American girls dolls is that I mean,

1928
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:11,000
you'll find plenty if you were into the doll collecting,

1929
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:15,000
you'll find lots of people out there who will make clothes for them and everything.

1930
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:22,000
And the one thing that's interesting, if you the the Courtney's Pac-Man machine that I linked in chat,

1931
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:27,000
if you look at the last picture that shows the doll next to it and it is fully doll sized,

1932
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:35,000
you see the USB connector coming from the back. So that apparently is how it's powered is via USB.

1933
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:38,000
Very cool. But yeah, it's all out for preorder right now.

1934
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:45,000
And I mean, even, you know, with the pinball one, I know that some of Dan's buddies had a big talk going on,

1935
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:50,000
like, and these are men going on about the pinball table.

1936
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:55,000
And I mean, I certainly wouldn't wouldn't mind, you know, having it.

1937
02:26:55,000 --> 02:27:02,000
And it's very, very much 70s style pinball down to having the little digital, not digital,

1938
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:10,000
but the little LED, LED display for the score and everything.

1939
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:18,000
So. All right. Well, that was I was to say that was much more of a feel good story,

1940
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:22,000
especially with everything they're doing for the charities and stuff that I was expecting to end the show on.

1941
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:27,000
So that's pretty cool. Yeah. The American Girl Company is actually pretty stellar.

1942
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:33,000
I haven't found anything to be upset with them about or anything along those lines.

1943
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:45,000
It's you know, the the I would say if you get a chance to go and just read some of the stories about the girls themselves,

1944
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:49,000
they've written about them because they tell some pretty compelling stories,

1945
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:55,000
especially some of the ones that address the civil rights movement.

1946
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:59,000
And during the times of slavery, those stories are really poignant.

1947
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:03,000
I bet. All right. All right. Well, I learned about a new company tonight.

1948
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:06,000
Wasn't expecting that. All right. Well, moving on.

1949
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:09,000
It's the part of the show now that we're done with all the news that we had scheduled,

1950
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
that we're going to get into the listener roundtable.

1951
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:16,000
It's your chance to I mean, we try to get you guys to participate throughout the show via our chat.

1952
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:19,000
But this is the time for you to interact with our show via the mailbag as well as the chat room.

1953
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:24,000
If you have any questions for us or something you want us to talk about that we haven't gotten around to yet.

1954
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:28,000
Go ahead and shout it out in our chat over twitch dot TV slash vog and network.

1955
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:33,000
And while we wait for some of those questions, I think our soccer has a couple of emails to get to tonight.

1956
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:36,000
You guys email us. Participate at Orange Laundry dot com.

1957
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:42,000
And this is a great way for those of you that listen on the podcast feed through Spotify, iTunes.

1958
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:45,000
Not the Amazon one yet. I'm trying to get us listed on there.

1959
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:49,000
But I think the fact we have a custom thing is messing with it.

1960
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
But anyway, trying to get on everything.

1961
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:55,000
So for those of you guys that listen on the podcast feed can participate as well.

1962
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Again, the email is participate at Orange Laundry dot com.

1963
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Dark soccer. Why don't you kick us off with an email?

1964
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:05,000
All right. So first of them. Hello, all our crew.

1965
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:09,000
I probably love the show. Probably. OK.

1966
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:15,000
Finally, we know the console price is four hundred ninety nine for the high end models is OK.

1967
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:19,000
But we can get both high end consoles for only a thousand dollars.

1968
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:24,000
That ain't bad. Perhaps one could postpone that PC upgrade. What do you all think?

1969
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:28,000
Thank you. Love, Sam. I'm sorry. I love that.

1970
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:35,000
It's I probably love the show. Yeah.

1971
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:38,000
And I and I tend to read these like they're written.

1972
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:45,000
So if there's like lack of, you know, punctuation or things kind of run on, then I will read it exactly that way.

1973
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:50,000
No, I think it's great. Like, I'm not I'm not going to it's just funny.

1974
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:55,000
Like, I like that it doesn't B.S. us. You don't have to confess your undying love for O.L.R..

1975
02:29:55,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Like, I get it. For some of you, we're background noise and that's OK.

1976
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:05,000
So all right. I probably liked your email. All right.

1977
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:13,000
Anyway. So, yeah. It's the pricing of everything and what to do.

1978
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:22,000
You know, and there's a lot of people who are taking that perspective of why should I get the consoles when I can just use that money and upgrade my computer?

1979
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:27,000
But I really, truly don't think there's a one size fits all answer to this situation.

1980
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:33,000
And I'm going to tell you, it's really big for me personally, because I have definitely been confronted with that.

1981
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:39,000
When I talk about I'm going to get the Xbox Series X and people go, well, I'm just going to play those games on my PC, whatever.

1982
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:44,000
But here's the thing for me. I there are a lot of PC games I do enjoy playing.

1983
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:48,000
I play Final Fantasy 14 on PC, a lot of the Blizzard stuff I play on PC.

1984
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:54,000
There's no shortage of PC games that I do play. But sometimes y'all and especially in the year 2020,

1985
02:30:54,000 --> 02:31:02,000
I've got to get out of my office and away from my PC and somewhere else where I can be a vegetable.

1986
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:07,000
And that's why console gaming is really attractive here in the year 2020.

1987
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:16,000
Because unlike, you know, before, unlike the BC, before COVID, unlike those times when I was actually going into the office using a computer there,

1988
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:20,000
I'm in my office for eight hours a day working there.

1989
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:25,000
And then I'm continuing to play some games and they're like, I have to get the hell out of that office once in a while.

1990
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
So sometimes for me, that's enough.

1991
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:34,000
And, you know, I know you guys out there would be like, well, you should have a separate space for your office and something where you can like close the door.

1992
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:38,000
Yeah. OK. But as you all know, we didn't prepare for this.

1993
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:42,000
We've had to just make it work with what we've got. And that's what I've got going right now.

1994
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Now, when we talk about maybe going to a new space or something, I'll have that in mind.

1995
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:53,000
But for now, I think being able to separate from the PC sometimes is a necessity for me anyway.

1996
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:57,000
So I don't know. Any other thoughts on the email?

1997
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:03,000
No. OK. You said it. All right. Let me get some thoughts from chat real quick.

1998
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:12,000
Quest Buster in chat says, I love gaming on PCs, but I know people that work with PCs during the day and when they get home, don't want to touch one at all.

1999
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:19,000
Yeah. And DJ Ramas points out that five hundred dollars ain't going to do enough to upgrade your PC for next gen console specs.

2000
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:27,000
And in a way, that is also true. Like, you know, if you want a high end graphics card that does ray tracing, that's going to be a charge right there.

2001
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:36,000
So it just I really think the answer to this question is really dependent on who you are and what you like and what your situation is like.

2002
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:39,000
And that's something we as gaming fans have to keep in mind.

2003
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:48,000
I think more often than we do is that the answer for me and my house and my gaming configuration is not going to apply one for one to somebody else's.

2004
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:52,000
You have to weigh the options. Nothing is one size fits all.

2005
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:57,000
Yeah, exactly. And that's that's my thought on that.

2006
02:32:57,000 --> 02:33:01,000
All right. Just does Stella want to read an email, Loki?

2007
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:04,000
No, she's just six. I wasn't looking at her. So.

2008
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:12,000
Oh, all right. For those on the podcast feed, Stella, Loki's kitty has decided to grace us with her presence, although it's so funny.

2009
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:20,000
Every time Stella's on cam, it's the same pose, but it is the most damn adorable pose you will ever see.

2010
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:24,000
Yeah, she doesn't like facing the other way and she can't hear anymore, really.

2011
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:30,000
So she just screams at me the entire time. At least I'm pretty sure she can't hear.

2012
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:34,000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure she can't hear anything anymore, but I don't know.

2013
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:37,000
Did you name her after the Atari emulator?

2014
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:40,000
No. Funny enough, she's already named Stella when we got her.

2015
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:44,000
OK, I like that. It's kind of like Shermy was named Sherman.

2016
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:48,000
Oh, you know, Mr. Smoosh had a name.

2017
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:54,000
We found that out. We found that out when we took him to the vet finally in the vet, scanned the little thing.

2018
02:33:54,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Mr. Smoosh is oh, I don't even want to say it. It's so bad. Mr. Smoosh's former name was Hex.

2019
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:06,000
Yeah, I liked it. I don't like that name at all for Mr. Smoosh.

2020
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:12,000
But I think it's a cool name for a black cat. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's a cool name for a black cat, but not that black cat.

2021
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:21,000
Yeah, if I wasn't naming my cats after, you know, video games, I think Midna would have made a nice Knox or something like N.O.X..

2022
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:26,000
So we'll see. Tiger Claws says, I'm surprised Mr. Smoosh isn't like that.

2023
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:32,000
Does he not like to cuddle? No, he does. But he's more like a lap cat and he's really attached to Alan.

2024
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:38,000
So like if in fact, probably no, because I heard him in the hallway. But if Alan is like gaming or working on the computer long term.

2025
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:42,000
Absolutely. Mr. Smoosh will jump on Alan's lap and sit there.

2026
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:48,000
He doesn't like walk up on the shoulder like what Stella's doing to Loki, but he'll lie there in the lap.

2027
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:54,000
He's too fat to go any higher. He's too fat to fly.

2028
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:58,000
That's right. Anyway, sorry. Dark soccer. More emails. All right.

2029
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:03,000
All right. So next email. Hello, peoples.

2030
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:10,000
In recent weeks, we have seen a lot of stories being spread about the upcoming release of Sony and Microsoft's next gaming consoles.

2031
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:18,000
This week, we saw Sony release the announcement about their upcoming consoles. Does their announcement line up with the stories we were told about about it?

2032
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Honestly, I don't fucking care about this fucking stories and whether or not this fucking stories line up with the fucking reality.

2033
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:32,000
I just count those stories as goddamn fucking worthless hoopla from people who know fucking nothing about fucking nothing.

2034
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Someone's mad and I am not adding in the fucking that was already there.

2035
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
So I think I'm going to hit a limit.

2036
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Gaming is not alone when it comes to stupid stories being spread around those who have no value in the real world and only serve to drive interest among the stupid and gullible.

2037
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:57,000
American culture is rife with this, and we need to stop rewarding it with our attention. By the way, it's not you wrote out and you should have wrote an R.

2038
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
I correct it for you. Thank you.

2039
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:12,000
Let me be clear. Speculation is only worthwhile as it relates to gambling and that speculation relates to whether some team is going to cover the spread or some kicker is going to cost you whatever you gambled on when they miss a field goal in the third quarter.

2040
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:17,000
Okay, you're talking sports. That's another language. Don't do that again.

2041
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:29,000
The only rumors I went to listen to was put out by Fleetwood Mac in 1977. Other than that, get that shit out of my face, any site that pedals and unfounded rumors speculation is worthless to me and people should treat this as such.

2042
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:36,000
Do I have standards when it comes to sources Yes I do. I will never apologize for that no matter how much people who are trusted by others will disagree with me.

2043
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:43,000
Any source worthy of my trust will stand up to my strenuous scrutiny scrutiny absolutely at least take care of entertainment.

2044
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:50,000
Okay. I think that you're mad and I don't know why.

2045
02:36:50,000 --> 02:37:00,000
I think speculation sometimes is fun. Yeah, you know, respectfully I disagree like calm down.

2046
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:16,000
I think that you might need, like, some Valium, or what's the other thing that people take that as a palm. Here's the thing, here's the thing, look, I, I'm gonna say that I get the frustration about like rumors is that, and I do understand that there

2047
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
is too much.

2048
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:32,000
People don't fact check and people don't think about some of the things that they spread online. I had a big problem with that on Facebook and I think a lot of us do we all have that one relative who doesn't fucking read the article before they share it

2049
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:45,000
or shares these things that were just debunked on Snopes like two weeks ago, you know, three years old. Exactly. It's, it's those types of things and and to some extent like I get that especially when it comes to rumors and things you know and so forth.

2050
02:37:45,000 --> 02:38:00,000
But on the other hand, like and and having done this show I make no secret. Yes, we do talk about rumors on this show, but we do it because this is a show about video games, gaming culture and the gaming lifestyle and rumors, like it or not, you're part of the

2051
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:12,000
culture and if something is gaining a lot of speed and traction so forth on Twitter. It's something I feel like we have to talk about here to reasonably and reasonably debate is this rumor something that is.

2052
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:24,000
And remember this when I used to talk about a rumor was plausible. Now you all gave me so much shit over that word I stopped, I tried to take it out of my vocabulary, but I think you still know what I'm getting at is that you know we kind of discuss could there

2053
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:35,000
be smoke where there's fire with these rumors. But let's be honest, as much as you hate rumors. The Final Fantasy 16 one at the PS five event spot on. They got it. Yeah, that was that was a true rumor.

2054
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:47,000
This Mass Effect trilogy thing. It's gonna happen. And the movie industry is not immune from this, either, you know, it just is a part of what we partake in in our culture.

2055
02:38:47,000 --> 02:39:01,000
However, any of us called what was happening with Bill and Ted, which by the way. Excellent. Yeah. And, you know, I, and, but on the same token like I don't want to like dismiss what you're saying, I have a feeling like you wouldn't listen to this show

2056
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:15,000
if you didn't understand my perspective and entertainment is a frequent emailer of this show so I think he gets that to an extent, but I do so I want to say, I do understand your frustration because there are certain things out there that are so goddamn unbelievable

2057
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:32,000
and I don't understand why they gain as much motion as they do online sometimes, and that does happen in gaming as well. So it's, I to that end I do understand the frustration, but there are some things out there that do end up coming true.

2058
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:45,000
Also other comments in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network, Bobby Blackwell says if you want to show that has no rumors, check out the Bobby Blackwell show now on Amazon music, look.

2059
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:49,000
You didn't have to rub it in with the Amazon music part.

2060
02:39:49,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Yeah, and you know what I that's that's an editorial choice. And there are, yes, there are differences between our two shows, it's fine. You can have different things.

2061
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:14,000
Let's see, also, black compat says one of my aunts keep sharing this picture of Jesus that she loves. It's actually Jonathan Van Ness from queer I, and I don't have the desire to correct her.

2062
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:27,000
I know it's fucking hilarious. I love that story because I know exactly what picture you're talking about because I see it on Twitter all the time. And I love that.

2063
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:40,000
But it's also black compat, correct me if I'm wrong but isn't it one of those things where it's just kind of like, sh, wink, you know like, don't tell her.

2064
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:53,000
Dude, I do this stuff to piss off my mom on purpose. Dan tells me not to antagonize my mother. But when my mother is posting like, you know, tyrant shit. I'm gonna do it.

2065
02:40:53,000 --> 02:41:08,000
I'm gonna do it. You know, that's my job as a daughter, and I don't, I don't mean to be dark or depressing or anything but there are times when, and please do not misunderstand what I'm about to say, I miss my mother every single day I miss her so much.

2066
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:23,000
But at the same time, I'm so happy she doesn't have to deal with this year. I'm so happy I don't have to see how my mom dealt with 2020 on that on that token so sorry I know that seems that's like a dark deep place type of thing but it's just it's just the honest

2067
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:34,000
honest to God truth with everything out there on social media and she was starting to use Facebook more and use Twitter. And when she had a Twitter account she made me delete it because she said, I'm being followed by too many porn.

2068
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:38,000
There's too much porn on Twitter they all follow me and they're all, they're all.

2069
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
They're all sluts that follow me on Twitter.

2070
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Rob. What?

2071
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:45,000
I'm just saying. Oh.

2072
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:48,000
Yeah, but I just instinctively responded.

2073
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:51,000
I know I miss her a lot. All right, anyway.

2074
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
On to other topics.

2075
02:41:53,000 --> 02:42:00,000
My favorite thing to do is send mom like archaeological articles about Jesus not being white.

2076
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
I'm sure she loves it.

2077
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:19,000
But I mean, the thing is, okay, so you can not follow rumors all you want to and I always you know make my granddaddy always said consider the source and that's what we do you know, if we're going to post a rumor, we're going to do something that's relevant

2078
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:31,000
and trust number one like the mass effect one right right and we're also going to try to find as reliable sources as we can things that have been posted as listings things that could have some credence to them.

2079
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:37,000
Yes, so if you don't like it. Well, you can skip that part of the show.

2080
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:48,000
Let me, but let me also say something and because you reminded me dark soccer with what you were saying about you know how you kind of process rumors and this is very important because again not every gamer does this but I do.

2081
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:58,000
And this is why every time we do talk about a rumor on this show I'm like, take this with a grain of salt, or do not let this be an expectation that is so important.

2082
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:08,000
If you're going to talk about a rumor if you're gonna get into a rumor, please do not set that expectation. And yes, that even goes for me and Mass Effect, if they don't ever release the Mass Effect trilogy.

2083
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:24,000
They never said they were going to I really don't have a right to be disappointed. The only thing I can be disappointed in is the fact that I fell for all these rumors but there are a lot of rumors about the Mass Effect trilogy Okay, but you cannot set your expectations

2084
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:40,000
at the rumor level and that is so important and so many people miss that mark in gaming. They, they, I'm pissed that Sony didn't show this. Well, why did you ever think Sony was going to show it in the first place it was some stupid rumor you read on Twitter, or

2085
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:53,000
the Nintendo Direct shit notorious for that right some fake mock up some fake I'm pissed they didn't reveal a smash character today like you know I read about girl somebody lied to you, it happens.

2086
02:43:53,000 --> 02:44:01,000
Remember we they troll you on fall guys where they can't see your reaction you better believe they troll you on social media where they can.

2087
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:05,000
Anyway, moving on sorry. I said to get that point out.

2088
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:18,000
Hi, next email. Yes please. Last email. Okay, greetings one and all it's been a while since I dropped an email through and I figured I was long overdue. What I'm about to say has been on my mind for a while.

2089
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:21,000
Oh shit everyone's letting it out.

2090
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:29,000
A friend of mine said that he was sorry I was getting an Xbox Series X and so the PlayStation five. I mean, why would he be sorry.

2091
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:38,000
Because the PS five is better, some systems are basically the same hardware across the board along with similar technology wise man on set a system.

2092
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:46,000
I am not a man. Okay, system is as good as the games that are on it. I said that.

2093
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:49,000
Jamie, I'm so sorry that you're not me.

2094
02:44:49,000 --> 02:45:01,000
I'm just so that's what that cool reason the whole like, I'm sorry you're not getting a place by Jamie I'm so sorry you're not me, like, I know everybody wants to be at this level but you just can't.

2095
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
I'm sorry.

2096
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:09,000
You know what, what, I don't need your sorry you keep your pity party to yourself.

2097
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:16,000
Given the massive history, given the massive library of Xbox games from the last three consoles that can be played on the new system I'm here for it, damn it.

2098
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:27,000
To be fair, I really am not impressed with either systems lineup of games sunny fanboys say the SBS x is worthless because first party games are going to be on PC.

2099
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:42,000
Hey sunny fanboys PS fives first party games are slowly trickling their way over. There's no such thing as exclusivity either. I mean, think about it, a year after the game comes out it will be on PC or other consoles to have seen Sony fanboys

2100
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:52,000
backwards compatibility because no one wants it excuse you they're still allowed demand for it. Just because Sony is too lazy to do that with PS five that does not mean that there's no demand for it.

2101
02:45:52,000 --> 02:46:04,000
And truthfully, that's why I picked up the Xbox it's. I like the fact that I have one system to play these amazing titles. For the record, I still have my 360 connected for those incompatible games.

2102
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:15,000
Also, let us not forget that a lot of gamers don't have the space for all the consoles, and I am no exception to that. Side note for me I wonder if it's going to feel as badly as the last Xbox did in Japan.

2103
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
Anyway, going forward.

2104
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:27,000
We're really at that point where there is no dominant console of the generation, each company has their own direction. And while we're on the subject of game pass and Xbox.

2105
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:44,000
Sorry, Xbox games on PC. The big thing I hear is Xbox series that s x is worthless since the games you can play on a PC. Listen, I have a high end PC that I can play triple A titles on, but I use it for multimedia streaming and other projects first and gaming.

2106
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:50,000
Besides, I'm more comfortable playing video games on a big screen TV and lounging in my gaming chair or bed.

2107
02:46:50,000 --> 02:47:06,000
Overall, it doesn't matter what console we buy we're all winners we're all going to end up buying both consoles. No, I'm not. I know I am buying a PS five, not now but later because the one game I went for Horizon Forbidden West coming out to PS four.

2108
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:19,000
If I wait about a year or so after the game comes out there will be a greatest its version with all the DLC it's a win win for me. Well that's it forgive me for jumping all around in this email and quite a scatterbrain and it's hard for me to keep my thoughts

2109
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:36,000
on tangent before do you mean target before derailing into something else I mean my thoughts are always on tangent I mean, listen to me. I mean you have, have you listened to my podcast XD stay, stay safe out there and may the force be with y'all run.

2110
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:48,000
Well thank you for the email Rama and honestly like there's there's not a lot for me to argue with I feel like you and I are on the same page here, and we're not always on the same page when it comes to, you know, Microsoft and Sony and all that stuff

2111
02:47:48,000 --> 02:48:01,000
but that's that's okay and it's really silly that your friend was said what they said because that's really ridiculous everybody has to get what works for them and their situation and that is so different.

2112
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:04,000
Rob I'm sorry you're not me.

2113
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
Right.

2114
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
I'm sorry.

2115
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:14,000
I'm not I'm not sorry you know I'm not sorry, because I'm fucking amazing and none of y'all can be me.

2116
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:17,000
Just saying, I'll try harder, I'll strive every day.

2117
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:29,000
Alright, great emails this week you guys loved them all so I probably like that email segment tonight, participate at orange lounge radio.com. If you want to send us more emails for a future week.

2118
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:44,000
We do have at least one question from the chat I want to get to for our roundtable tonight. And that question comes from no one special 77 who says, so all of us are gamers, and we have been gaming for what seems like forever probably since the 80s or the 90s

2119
02:48:44,000 --> 02:49:00,000
maybe even the 70s depending on who you are. I'll pose this question. Do you have any favorite fond gaming memories, first time to an arcade, getting that coveted system for Christmas as a kid, saving up your hard earned money to buy a game or system totally on your own,

2120
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:17,000
played a game with a relative that has since passed. Alright, I mean I do feel like over the 800 plus history of this show. We've probably told all these stories before, but I'm fine with indulging it because gaming memories are nice, and in 2020, we need a little more nice.

2121
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:25,000
So would anyone like to indulge in no one special with some gaming memories some fond gaming memories, anyone.

2122
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:33,000
Pretending that I had the flu so I could stay home and play Final Fantasy six.

2123
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:36,000
That was pretty great, because I didn't have to go to school. Yep.

2124
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:39,000
How did you fake the flu.

2125
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:51,000
Did you know I just sat on the floor and had a blanket on and drink so much hot fluid that they did it registered as a temperature.

2126
02:49:51,000 --> 02:50:02,000
Since I brought up my mom, I will invoke that with my answer because I she was really not into technology or computers or any of that stuff at all, very much not her.

2127
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:17,000
So I really was never going to be able to get her to play a video game with me but the closest I could get would be on the Commodore 64, I could load up Wheel of Fortune or Family Feud, and she would play the game and just tell me what to type.

2128
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:30,000
So she would be like, you know, oh we're going to play Family Feud I'll just tell you what to type in. And so we would play games like that and there was a short amount of time where the Atari 2600 was in my mom's bedroom.

2129
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:39,000
So if I wanted to play it, I had to go to her bedroom and I know why she did it she did it because she didn't want me playing it too much. So she always wanted to kind of like be there to give me permission.

2130
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:51,000
And if the Golden Girls was on we were not going to be playing Atari 2600 at that time which I now that I'm looking back I completely respect that was a good parenting decision.

2131
02:50:51,000 --> 02:51:03,000
The Golden Girls should come before the Atari 2600, but she would watch me play stuff on Atari 2600 she's kind of, she's like, I don't get it, but she'd still watch and then she'd kind of go back to her magazine or whatever else she was doing in her chair.

2132
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:08,000
So, yeah, that's kind of like a gaming memory I remember.

2133
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
You know, oh, go ahead.

2134
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:14,000
I also remember when I lived with my lesbian parents.

2135
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:19,000
We would, I would play Chrono Trigger and they would watch with me.

2136
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:23,000
And that was always really a good memory. Nice.

2137
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:34,000
Some reminiscing in chat and then I'll see if Loki has anything. Fifth Dream says my dad seemingly reluctantly once bought us a 2600 I come home from school and he'd be in my room playing a new game sometimes.

2138
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:50,000
I didn't realize till later that he bought it so he could play too XD. There was never a game that my dad or my mom would play. Now the Commodore 64 I use that thing by far the most, but my dad would once in a great while.

2139
02:51:50,000 --> 02:52:02,000
Kick me off so he could try some railroad program my dad worked for the railroad for years and years till he retired, so it either be some railroad thing that he was doing like a railroad spreadsheet I don't know what he did I was, I was a kid.

2140
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:14,000
And, or something like a word processing document or genealogy which is the other thing my dad's always Superman into he gets some genealogy software and he want to kick me off computer so you can play genealogy.

2141
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:18,000
So, and that's what I called it playing genealogy.

2142
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:31,000
Other comments in chat dark to see it says I know I've done this one before but I cut school today we got the original PlayStation and I ran into my tutor, while she was out getting something lol and I did graduate so it didn't hurt me too much.

2143
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:43,000
Phoenix in chat says, I remember getting pissed drunk in college and playing battlefield four with a shit ton of people watching me, because apparently my copious and creative use of swear words was hilarious to a bunch of drunk college kids.

2144
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:54,000
Good times. Oh, I know I've told the college stories about Duke Nukem in the college dorms in this show before good times at deaf says, my dad actually got me into pinball.

2145
02:52:54,000 --> 02:53:00,000
We always went to the arcade and while I would play other games he would go to the pinball aisle and play some of the machines.

2146
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:09,000
Super Mario Brothers. My mom would sneak into my room when I was a kid to play it. If I woke up she would yell at me that I was dreaming and to go back to sleep.

2147
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:18,000
She got so good at the game. She knew where all the warps were and when the hammer brothers would come up and their patterns. She was speed running it before folks were running it.

2148
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:27,000
I've saved that copy of Super Mario Brothers and put it on my dresser next to a picture of my mom and me so I can remember her fucking love that story.

2149
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:37,000
And no one special says about my dad and the train stuff on the computer saying, Rob, did you derail his train of thought when he was working on that spreadsheet or program?

2150
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:43,000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2151
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:52,000
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I rolled the credits, Jamie. You guys probably couldn't hear it on your side.

2152
02:53:52,000 --> 02:54:04,000
All right. All right. Anyway, we're done, I guess. All right. Moving on. Loki, you didn't get to share yours.

2153
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:13,000
I mean, there's a lot of stuff. It's just like going to like some of the Nickel City stuff. That was pretty fun doing that with my friends.

2154
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:22,000
We used to go to all of the different shops that had arcade games back in the 90s. So like we'd stop by the 7-Eleven, play the Street Bear 2.

2155
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:28,000
And then there was a Captain Commando at one of the local diners. There was a movie theater that had like a bunch of other games.

2156
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:37,000
And we used to stop at Rico's Pizza to play some super off-road and stuff like that. So lots of fun stuff.

2157
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:45,000
And then, of course, my modded Grand Theft Auto games, some of the best gaming experiences ever, which never be topped, unfortunately.

2158
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:56,000
All right. Good memories. Good times. Love it. Love it. All right. I think with that, we're about at the point where we're gonna wrap this up.

2159
02:54:56,000 --> 02:55:04,000
So it's time to wrap last minute stories. Oh, God, of course. I'm so sorry. I forgot to ask for last minute stories. Please, Loki, go for it, please.

2160
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:13,000
All right. So there's this company, ICE, who stands for Interactive Concepts of Entertainment.

2161
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:24,000
And they're an arcade game manufacturing company. They are now going to be doing home arcade games similar to Arcade 1UP.

2162
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:34,000
So they've registered a brand new site, homearcadegames.com, and they have kind of a preview, like a picture showing some of the stuff that may be coming.

2163
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:43,000
Of this, lots of stuff that you wouldn't normally expect. So, for example, some non-traditional arcade games like Ice Ball, which is skee-ball.

2164
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:57,000
They've got, looks like a, I'm pretty excited about this one. So one of my kids' favorite games of playing the arcade is the raw thrills Jurassic Park arcade game.

2165
02:55:57,000 --> 02:56:07,000
That's one of the cabinets that they're showing there. Wow. And then Super Chex Pro, which is kind of like a ice hockey game that you can play, kind of like a foosball or something like that.

2166
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:17,000
They've got the Star Wars home pin, Stearns pinball, Namco Class of 81 with Pac-Man and Galaga.

2167
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:28,000
And also there was a, it was a collegiate hoops, which is a basketball arcade game where you, you know, the actual throwing basketballs into the hoops and stuff like that.

2168
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:35,000
So that's pretty cool kind of offset of just regular traditional cabinets, but man, that Jurassic Park game.

2169
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:46,000
Yeah. PixelPockets in chat, because you brought up arcade cabinets, is asking, did you all hear about that Neo Geo MVSX arcade machine?

2170
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:53,000
I do believe it came up a week or two ago in our rapid fire segment. And yeah, that sounds pretty rad too, honestly. Yeah, I kind of want one of those.

2171
02:56:54,000 --> 02:57:02,000
So they're going to start announcing stuff starting October 2020 is when they're going to have their first set of games available.

2172
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:09,000
So it'd be interesting to check out what they're doing with that. Apparently there's going to be more partnerships though with Raw Thrills.

2173
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:15,000
So I'm curious to see what comes out of that because they have a lot of interest in games. So interesting. Yeah.

2174
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:22,000
And PixelPockets says this home arcade games concept seems cool. Yeah, it's kind of, these arcade collectibles are really growing, huh?

2175
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:31,000
Like this whole arcade one up thing, I think kind of showed like, yes, yes, Gen Xers and millennials as they get older, yes, they will pay for this shit.

2176
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:34,000
So I think it's, they found something.

2177
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:37,000
I mean, our financial futures are already in the toilet, so why not?

2178
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:38,000
Exactly.

2179
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:41,000
And who knows when arcades are going to open again, so you know.

2180
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:42,000
That's right.

2181
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:43,000
And that's what it is.

2182
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
I forgot what they are.

2183
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:52,000
I have a friend who's moving into a new house and is already planning one of the rooms to be a full on arcade.

2184
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:56,000
And the reasoning behind it is that there's no arcades anymore.

2185
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000
So you know what? I'm going to put one in my house.

2186
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,000
And obviously you see a lot of people doing this.

2187
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:10,000
There's countless numbers of YouTubers that have tours of their either basement arcade, garage arcade, probably attic arcade, spare bedroom arcades.

2188
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,000
And you think of it.

2189
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:13,000
They've got it.

2190
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:16,000
Turning the in-law house into an arcade.

2191
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:17,000
All of it.

2192
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:18,000
That'd be amazing.

2193
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:19,000
Yeah.

2194
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:22,000
So and Bobby Bockel says, I'm converting your room into an arcade.

2195
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:24,000
It's a storage room right now.

2196
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:32,000
Well, I really hope Dragon Con 2021 is back in person and after all of this, so to speak, so that I can come see it.

2197
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:33,000
I do hope so.

2198
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:35,000
All right.

2199
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
Anyhow, any other last minute stories?

2200
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:39,000
That was a good one.

2201
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:40,000
No, that's it.

2202
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:42,000
Well, I had nothing.

2203
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,000
All right. Well, then I think we will wrap up the show.

2204
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:47,000
We're after nine o'clock or midnight on the East Coast anyway.

2205
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:48,000
It's been a long show tonight.

2206
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:49,000
We had a lot of news.

2207
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:52,000
So anyway, I want to thank you guys for staying up late with us.

2208
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:58,000
If you're listening live or listening to the whole thing, if you're on our podcast feed, we appreciate you guys for sticking with us.

2209
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:01,000
Rumors and all throughout another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2210
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:05,000
If you like what you heard here at the show, tell a friend or 20 about the show.

2211
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:08,000
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2212
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:13,000
But if we can't get the voices here to participate with us, we can't get the voices out there.

2213
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:19,000
And I think that's one thing we have heard time and time again just on tonight's show is that every gamer is different.

2214
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:21,000
And everybody's situation is different.

2215
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:24,000
And we've heard that applied all sorts of ways tonight.

2216
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:37,000
And that just is important why we need that diversity of opinions here to really try to put our feet in other people's shoes and understand why somebody might think a different way or choose a different system or whatever it is that we're talking about.

2217
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:41,000
So, really appreciate that. Thank you guys who help us spread the word.

2218
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:45,000
Auto hosting on Twitch for VOG Network goes a very long way.

2219
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:48,000
And you can do that anytime. You don't have to just do that on Sunday night.

2220
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:51,000
That is super helpful. And thank you so much.

2221
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:57,000
And thank you those you guys that leave a nice review to like a five star review on iTunes or wherever it is that you found this show.

2222
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:59,000
Those things go an awful long way.

2223
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:05,000
And don't forget to participate with us on Discord as well over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

2224
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:16,000
All right, enough plugs. I think we can go around and get everybody's final thought. I will start with Jamie because you're on top tonight in the site on the TV so dark soccer you're a final thought tonight.

2225
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:22,000
Um, well Rosh Hashanah is already over but to my fellow Jew people.

2226
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:24,000
Let's turn out to have.

2227
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:31,000
And during if you observe during Yom Kippur have an easy fast.

2228
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:33,000
All right.

2229
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:36,000
And Loki your final thought.

2230
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:45,000
Keep working on I'm still working on stuff. Hopefully I'm trying to get to a point where I can announce something so soon, hopefully.

2231
03:00:45,000 --> 03:01:02,000
All right. And then my final thought of course I want to say, of course, and I totally agree with folks in chat, rest in power to Ruth Bader Ginsburg and thank you so much for everything, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and a lot of the very important and historic decisions that you've had a part of.

2232
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:08,000
And in the very very wise words of a very very talented drag queen.

2233
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:12,000
I'm not going to panic, because I don't do that anymore.

2234
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:14,000
Everything's gonna be okay.

2235
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:15,000
All right.

2236
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:21,000
I just don't like the one Rob went in trouble, fear and doubt, run in circles scream and shout.

2237
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:23,000
That's fine too. That's fine.

2238
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:27,000
Whatever you've got to do to cope with the situation. All right.

2239
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:36,000
And on that note, we're going to end Orange Lounge AO for tonight, maybe some of you are going to play some video games to deal with things and get out to get out your feelings over the next seven days with some video games.

2240
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:43,000
Have fun, be safe, be kind. Have a good week everybody we'll see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.
