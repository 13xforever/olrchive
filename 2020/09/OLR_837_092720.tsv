41560	45280	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
45280	47320	where every gamer has a voice.

71120	74520	are partaking in that are having an easy fast.
74520	80120	I imagine we may have less folks here live as a result but maybe some folks catching
80120	86760	up with us throughout the week via our podcast or our subscribers over at twitch.tv slash
86760	91320	VOG Network where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

122080	123080	part.
123080	124080	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
124080	125080	Hello.
125080	126080	Hey, Loki.
126080	127160	How are you doing?
127160	128160	I'm doing pretty good.
128160	129160	Good.
129160	130960	Good to see you as always.
130960	132160	What is this behind you tonight?
132160	133160	You've got Bubble Bobble.
133160	134840	You're going to old school and classic tonight.
135240	136640	It's the NES Bubble Bobble.
136640	140240	It was one of the first three games they had for the NES.
140240	142160	Oh, I like that.
142160	143160	Okay.
143160	146560	And that's you just decided to pick Bubble Bobble for that reason or?
146560	149080	Um, yeah, because I had trouble.
149080	154080	I've run through a lot of the games already each week, so like, I'm just like, um, what
154080	156160	should I put this week?
156160	157160	I was thinking there might be-
157160	158680	I guess I could have put a Bethesda game or something.
158680	159680	Yeah, yeah.
159680	160680	That would be topical.
160680	162720	We'll get into that in a second, obviously.
162720	167320	I thought maybe there was a clue there that like maybe the mystery Loki game that you're
167320	170240	making has something to do with Bubble Bobble.
170240	174200	I thought maybe there was a, okay, I need to stop reading into things so damn much.
174200	178400	It's just, I needed something to put in the background and I didn't want to repeat stuff
178400	179400	I've had already.
179400	182320	So it was Bubble Bobble this week.
182320	183320	Yeah.
183320	184320	Fair.
184320	188600	Over in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network, Bobby Blackwell says, my first
188600	189840	games on the NES.
189840	191120	I had the power set.
191120	197440	I had Super Mario.com world-class track meet, and then I had pro wrestling and Top Gun.
197440	198440	This is a good question.
198440	204600	Y'all in chat, first system and games that you had for said system, let's, let's elaborate
204600	205600	on that a bit.
205600	210960	I'm trying to think what I, well, my first system was really an Atari 2600, honestly.
210960	214080	And I remember combat.
214080	217000	And I remember Spider-Man and I think I've talked, you know, I've talked enough about
217000	220360	Spider-Man on this show and in the past few episodes, I'm trying to remember what else
220360	221360	I own.
221360	222360	Oh, Superman.
222360	223480	I guess I, I guess I was a superhero kid.
223480	224760	I do remember having Superman.
224760	227680	Did you ever play Superman on the Atari 2600?
227680	228680	No.
228680	230280	It was really weird.
230280	233920	You flew through these different screens and there was this little bling bling bling little
233920	234920	thing.
234920	236760	I think it was like Krypton or something that would chase you.
236760	238000	You were trying to get Lois Lane.
238000	241120	It was, it played very strange.
241120	242600	So that was an early game that I had.
242600	243600	All right.
243600	244600	What did you want to say, Loki?
244600	245600	Adding to that?
245600	247880	Oh, I was going to say, so my first three games that I got on the NES, cause we got
247880	254320	it secondhand, I believe, um, was Bubble Bobble, The Legend of Zelda, cause that's one I really
254320	259240	wanted and Breakthrough, um, kind of random.
259240	260240	Yeah.
260240	261240	Yeah.
261240	266720	I'm pretty sure Zelda was like the first game outside of, um, Mario Brothers and, uh, Duck
266720	267720	Hunt.
267720	271720	I didn't have the power pad system, but I'm pretty sure Zelda was also bought around the
271720	276700	same time because that was the game that like really probably got me like super into gaming
276740	279380	and made me, made me more of a gamer, quite frankly.
279380	283900	Um, let's see other comments in chat, uh, checking out what folks are saying.
283900	288660	Pod culture says Atari, 2,600 combat, et and Pac-Man.
288660	292060	Those are some must have games, even though two of them were kind of garbage.
292060	298740	Uh, She-Hulk 10 says Colecovision and, and it scrolled off the screen, Donkey Kong Colecovision
298740	299740	had some good stuff.
299740	302820	Colecovision, uh, we never had one, but our friends had one.
302820	304580	Um, let's see other stuff.
304580	306460	Fifth dream says I played Superman a lot.
306460	307460	Okay.
307460	308460	Glad it wasn't just me.
308460	311100	The break man says Atari, 2,600 Ghostbusters.
311100	316380	Now that was one of the first games I remember picking up for the Commodore 64.
316380	320900	Um, I remember going to a computer store and well, I didn't buy it.
320900	325340	I was like six or seven, but I remember my, my dad buying it for me because you know,
325340	326340	gimme, gimme, gimme.
326340	329900	Well, that was also when they would, they would have the computers that would play games
329900	333480	like, and they'd be on display and Ghostbusters was one of the games they were showing off,
333480	338960	I guess not too far apart from how you'd have like an Xbox or a PlayStation kiosk set
338960	342160	up in a Best Buy or a GameStop in these days.
342160	343960	You kind of try before you buy.
343960	347400	I remember that's how I discovered Sid Meier's civilization.
347400	350200	I spent hours at a store.
350200	354080	I don't know how they let me stay at that damn store hours playing Civ on a computer
354080	355080	at the store.
355080	356080	It was crazy.
356080	357080	Um, yeah.
357080	361200	So, um, yeah, I did have a Colecovision as well.
361200	365280	I can't remember what the first few games were cause I think that was during the crash.
365280	371760	Um, so my dad had like 50 games for, for system that he says he never like did gaming and
371760	372760	stuff.
372760	373760	Like he had 50 games for that.
373760	375600	So I think he got them so dirt cheap.
375600	380360	Um, but like I used to play a ton of, uh, the Smurfs, Jumpman Jr. and Bump and Jump
380360	381360	on that.
381360	382360	Okay.
382360	383360	Good.
383360	386040	I didn't know Jumpman Jr. was on Colecovision, but I guess that makes sense.
386040	387040	Epic.
387040	388520	Epic's put their games out a lot of places.
388520	389520	Yeah.
389520	390520	Cool.
390840	394640	So from retro games to modern games, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic.
394640	399240	Obviously there's a big, big story and everybody's got a hot take on this and this has to do
399240	407980	with Microsoft and their acquisition of Bethesda and what, uh, ID software all under the parent
407980	408980	company is ZeniMax.
408980	409980	Right?
409980	410980	Loki, tell us more.
410980	411980	Yes.
411980	417400	So yeah, I would have, uh, the crack of Dawn on, uh, September 21st, we've got the announcement
417400	424280	that apparently, uh, ID software's parent company, um, ZeniMax or ZeniMax, which owns,
424280	429040	you know, Bethesda ID software and a lot of other, um, subsidiaries as well.
429040	435140	They were purchased for $7.5 billion by Microsoft, uh, which is incredible.
435140	442320	So apparently, you know, that adds a whole ton of games to their roster as well.
442320	449000	Um, it seems like that this has been purchased just for, well, to definitely help out with
449000	452080	games pass and adding more titles to that.
452080	460160	But I mean, as someone who's decided to purchase an X-Box this, this, uh, time around, it's
460160	461760	just making my purchase even better.
461760	463080	So I love it.
463080	467580	Um, and as to why, uh, some, some folks may wonder why did I put on the sidebar Microsoft
467580	472200	acquires Bethesda and I didn't put Microsoft acquire ZeniMax, um, well, Bethesda is a part
472200	477900	of that, but also, and what I kind of relate this to every E3, we have the Bethesda press
477900	478900	conference, right?
478900	482880	We have the Bethesda event, Bethesda E3, well, Microsoft now owns everything that you've
482880	489160	been shown in that particular, um, you know, real for the past couple of years.
489160	490160	So yeah.
490160	491160	Yeah.
491160	492160	Kinda, um, kinda interesting.
492160	494520	Um, is that all you wanted to say on it?
494520	496360	No, no, not at all.
496360	501320	So, so of course, you know, the obvious concern is, well, what's that going to do with these
501320	505120	exclusive games that Sony has, you know, for Bethesda?
505120	510360	Or does that mean that I can't get elder scrolls six on, you know, the PlayStation five?
510360	516440	Well, apparently that's not necessarily going to be the case, um, that they are confirmed
516440	521720	that they're right now going to hold their agreements, especially with, um, was a death
521720	522720	loop.
522720	525080	Now that's an exclusive game on PlayStation five.
525080	529120	So they're going to actually keep that exclusive because that's the agreement that's already
529120	530120	been made.
530120	531120	Yeah.
531120	534960	There's probably contracts and things because of how death loop has been highlighted in
534960	537000	the PlayStation five showcase.
537000	539640	That would be a lot of eggs on Sony's face.
539640	543160	If that game suddenly went and became a Microsoft exclusive.
543160	549200	So there's probably legal agreements, which it's probably just easier to go ahead and
549200	551320	honor the, uh, agreement.
551320	552320	Yeah.
552320	553680	So they're going to keep their agreements.
553680	558720	And then I believe with the right now, what they've been, the kind of stance has been
558720	560800	is they're going to look at it as they go along.
560800	566000	But I think that they're actually still considering doing these multi-platform, which makes sense
566000	569240	because you have a lot of these Microsoft properties on other systems.
569240	574520	Um, I mean, hell, we just had a new Ori game come to the switch this week.
574520	579680	So in the outer worlds, the outer worlds is still multi-platform even after Microsoft
579680	580680	bought obsidian.
580680	586680	Um, but I, I think there's a lot to say though about Microsoft kind of resting on, well,
586680	590280	not necessarily resting on, but investing, I think is a better word investing on the
590280	593660	strength of literally cause they just spent billions of dollars to invest, but they're
593660	600200	investing on the strength of game pass because sure elder scrolls six could go multi-platform.
600200	604640	It could show up on the PlayStation five road will set you back $70 or you just get it with
604640	607040	game pass for PC and Xbox.
607040	610640	Which at this point, many gamers, yeah.
610640	615720	And so I kind of feel like it doesn't matter at that point, if it's multi-platform, it's
615760	621640	going to be such a stronger deal to pick it up on PC or Xbox, uh, that maybe Microsoft
621640	626000	doesn't need to, I mean, Oh, well, it sells more on PlayStation five.
626000	627000	Great.
627000	630240	That's more money for Microsoft who now owns the studio.
630240	638960	So I'm not sure this whole era of console exclusives is what it used to be.
638960	640720	I mean, for Sony, it still is.
640720	645120	Uh, they're going to have God of war and all this stuff, but even, even things like
645120	650800	horizon zero Dawn and some of the other strong Sony franchises you've started to see come
650800	652640	to PC.
652640	655160	And you know, there was a lot of gamers that were up in arms about it, even though it was
655160	659480	like a year after the fact, but I think it just kind of goes to show that like maybe
659480	663160	exclusives aren't everything it used to be.
663160	666080	And I don't understand why people are up in arms about that kind of stuff.
666080	668920	Like even like, I don't get it.
668920	672320	Like why would you care if somebody else can play a game?
672320	675960	Like that's such a stupid thing to be mad about that Twitter shit.
675960	676960	Just ignore it.
676960	679160	There's so much like God, people have a lot of free time.
679160	681440	I mean, I understand there's a pandemic going on.
681440	685760	A lot of people are still staying at home and all that, which is great, but I, you just,
685760	687560	you just have to filter that garbage out.
687560	694040	There's so much garbage on social media that, you know, just pay it no mind in you, you
694040	698040	know, it gets 50 times as bad when it's political stuff and it's just filter, filter, filter,
698040	700000	filter, you let the brain filter out.
700000	701000	Yeah.
701000	703920	It's just like with all the people saying, well, there's better, better games on PlayStation
703920	704920	five.
704920	705920	And I mean, you know, Xbox sucks.
705920	706920	I'm not going to get an Xbox.
706920	707920	I'm like, cool.
707920	708920	You can, you can do whatever you want.
708920	713160	Like, I don't understand why people are like mad at other people for their purchasing decisions
713160	714360	or decisions on stuff.
714360	715880	It's like, who cares?
715880	716880	It doesn't matter.
716880	718640	It's not impacting you at all.
718640	720760	Like it, it's just such a silly thing.
720760	722800	Like I, I don't get it.
722800	727880	Chewy 240 in chat says, anyone still doubting game pass needs to re-examine their gaming
727880	728880	life.
728880	729880	Well, let's talk about that.
729880	730880	Hello.
730880	731880	Let's talk about that.
731880	738720	Um, obviously a big reason why Microsoft has done this is to really buffer up game pass.
738720	745800	And this buffing up of game pass is starting now, like now, because we've already had the
745800	749040	Xbox game pass account tweet out a leak.
749040	753920	And I'm using my quotey fingers, a leak that long story short doom, eternal or doom.
753920	758320	One of them, probably both are on their way to Xbox game pass very soon.
758320	762000	Um, probably in the coming weeks, certainly before the end of the year.
762000	766360	So this investment is already starting to pay off.
766360	770360	And that's more than you can say for a lot of Microsoft's other investments.
770360	774160	That's not to shade any of those studios, but when you get Bethesda and as some of you
774160	779840	have noted in chat, Bethesda has a history that goes back to the fucking 19 or 19 eight.
779840	780840	Yes.
780840	781840	19.
781840	783100	I can't get my words right tonight.
783100	784100	The 1980s.
784100	785100	Okay.
785100	787380	I'm at my brain thought I said 1890s anyway.
787380	791080	It goes all the way back to the 1980s with some of the old games that they did.
791080	792080	Let's not forget.
792080	795440	Microsoft has a PC game pass as well.
795440	799720	Wouldn't it be pretty rad if like a lot of these old classics suddenly started showing
799720	801400	up on PC game pass?
801400	806000	I'm not saying they're going to, but if Microsoft wanted to go that route, they could.
806000	807760	And that's just going to strengthen that as well.
807760	811440	And then of course on the console front, now you have doom, doom and eternal.
811440	815080	Obviously you're gonna have elder scrolls six and it doesn't matter if the game goes
815080	820160	multi-platform because it's going to be part of game pass or you can pay $70 for it.
820160	828760	If you really want, you know, on PlayStation five, um, with game pass, Microsoft has now,
828760	832720	and I use this analogy on Bobby's show when I was doing the, the toss over and I'm going
832720	834080	to say it again.
834080	839540	It's like all these services and people trying to become the next game pass, right?
839540	841000	We have Google stadia.
841000	842000	We have a new one from Amazon.
842000	843800	We're going to talk about it a little bit.
843800	847540	We have, um, Nintendo switch online.
847540	853480	We have, uh, PlayStation and now the PlayStation plus, uh, games and all that Microsoft was
853480	858200	already out in front and now they have just pushed the nitro button and you remember that
858200	862800	and Ivan man, iron Stewart, super off-road, you hit that nitro button, you go flying out
862800	863800	in front.
863800	865600	That's what this Bethesda purchase has done.
865600	869600	They have nitro their way to the front with this game pass, which is where they truly
869600	877560	see gaming going is where movies and TV have gone, which is streaming, which is Netflix.
877560	879520	And how long did it take?
879520	885100	Because Netflix was so far out front with their investments of creating original programming.
885100	889840	So when it came the, uh, when it came to who's going to get the stranger things that
889840	894220	really kind of threw them out in first place and you know, all the Netflix originals that
894220	899340	have made them who they are, it has taken forever for other companies to catch up and
899340	901260	become part of the conversation.
901260	903100	Hulu is kind of getting there.
903100	906780	CBS all access is struggling.
906780	912780	CBS is been out there at CBS is one of the big three networks and they're having a hard
912780	914580	time catching on with streaming.
914580	916540	They're having to rebrand the paramount network.
916540	923460	They're having to bring in the forces from VH1 and MTV and in order to take on, uh, Netflix,
923460	929620	the only company that was able to nitro themselves to a level where Netflix is at pretty quickly
929620	932500	is Disney, Disney plus.
932500	939880	And the analogy here would be if Nintendo really wanted to, they could create something
939880	943660	stronger than game pass tomorrow.
943660	944660	Well, don't worry.
944660	947620	Just, they're not, we all know they're not, they're running a Nintendo time.
947620	950620	So right now we're, we're talking early two thousands of Nintendo.
950620	951620	Don't worry.
951620	953880	In 10 years, they'll have something that's similar to Netflix.
953880	957100	And then they'll, you know, everyone will talk how innovative it is.
957100	958100	They're just behind.
958100	962340	Nintendo plus will be out in 2030 it's, it's going to be some time.
962340	966300	I mean, I props to them if they figured this out early and I'm sorry.
966300	971100	The NES online and the SNES online don't count.
971100	972460	Y'all know it don't count.
972820	974500	It's, it's beans.
974500	980300	It's it's fucking free Pluto TV compared to, actually, I kind of like Pluto TV.
980300	983740	I shouldn't shade it, but it compared to Netflix, it's like a non-issue.
983740	984740	Okay.
984740	985740	Crackle.
985740	986740	It's yes.
986740	987740	Crackle.
987740	998220	Or like, or is it like my TV or I've got the Roku channel, which is just like the garbage,
998220	999460	like old shows.
999460	1001300	Like I didn't even realize that this was syndicated.
1001300	1006180	It's the weather app that just plays the same forecast on loop for your area 24 hours
1006180	1007180	a day.
1007180	1010860	It's that, that actually exists on PlayStation four, by the way, there's like a weather app
1010860	1011860	anyway.
1011860	1016660	Um, I think like the Roku app, it's like, it's got like reruns of wings and that's about
1016660	1017660	it on there.
1017660	1019740	It's just like random stuff.
1019740	1020740	All right.
1020740	1025180	So my point is, and that whole chat comment I was responding to originally and talking
1025180	1029540	about, let's talk about game pass is that with this, Microsoft has propelled themselves
1029540	1034220	to the front that like everybody else is now going to be struggling to catch up.
1034220	1038660	And you see Sony kind of starting to move pieces in that direction.
1038660	1041300	It is too late.
1041300	1044500	They had now see Sony moving anything in that direction.
1044500	1048700	They have a lot of ground to make up and you know, Sony is going to kind of hope they can
1048700	1049700	still ride on.
1049700	1054980	And I'm not, I'm not, please don't miss hear me when I talk these critical things about
1054980	1058700	Sony and this is just the culture we're in now is that everything is so polarized.
1058700	1061500	And if I'm sitting here being critical of Sony, I must hate them.
1061500	1062500	I don't.
1062500	1064900	I've said it until I'm blue in the face every week on the show.
1064900	1065900	Cool.
1065900	1066900	We have Microsoft.
1066900	1067900	Yes.
1067900	1068900	Like not even that.
1068900	1069900	Yeah.
1069900	1070900	Yeah.
1070900	1071900	Go back and listen.
1071900	1072900	Yes.
1072900	1075100	We, we've raked Microsoft over the coals and then some, okay.
1075100	1078060	The thing is we're, we're rooting for everybody.
1078060	1079060	Okay.
1079060	1084500	But the reality is in this department where we all see gaming is going, Sony has some
1084500	1086300	major catching up to do.
1086300	1090580	And what they showed with the PlayStation plus with free games, isn't quite it.
1090580	1094220	It is, it is movement in the right direction.
1094220	1096720	That's coming years too late.
1096720	1098900	So they have a lot of ground to make up now.
1098900	1103260	Sony could sign some deals and really make some ground up tomorrow.
1103260	1105420	Sony isn't charging an extra fee.
1105420	1110540	They're bundling in and PlayStation plus that is, you know, to be noted, but it just, you
1110540	1114660	know, you can feel how far behind they are now.
1114660	1119780	And if they don't start to make moves, bigger moves to catch up, Microsoft's really going
1119780	1121320	to run away with this.
1121320	1124880	I mean, honestly, if you want to say, you know, all their free games that they're offering
1124880	1128860	for the PlayStation five, really just kind of catching up to what Microsoft's been doing
1128860	1133140	because Microsoft's been putting out four games a month that you get with your monthly
1133140	1135660	subscription, whereas Sony's had two.
1135660	1141760	So they're already kind of behind with that plus games fast food for thought again, something
1141760	1144220	Sony could do tomorrow barring legal agreements.
1144220	1147500	And I know legal agreements take time.
1147500	1150580	Sony could just merge PlayStation plus and PlayStation.
1150580	1155900	Now I realize they may not be able to carry all the same games, but maybe PlayStation
1155900	1162740	now would allow them to open up three to one and hundreds of games from Playstations past.
1162740	1166540	And Sony could make that happen pretty quickly.
1166540	1167540	Will they?
1167540	1168540	I don't know.
1168540	1171300	No, I don't think they're never going to do that anyway.
1171300	1173420	They like their money too much.
1173420	1174420	Some other comments.
1174420	1175420	Yeah.
1175420	1180300	And Paley Hanumayo says, quite frankly, they'll still outsell Xbox this next gen.
1180300	1182140	That is not incorrect.
1182140	1183360	I actually agree with you.
1183360	1190460	The PlayStation five as hardware will outsell Xbox, however.
1190460	1195820	Here's the real question to ask at the end of this generation.
1195820	1203360	Who will have more monthly subscribers, PlayStation plus or Xbox Game Pass?
1203360	1206640	And hardware doesn't matter anyways, because when you think about it, they're making a
1206640	1209920	it's a loss for any hardware sold anyways.
1209920	1214680	And right now, people are just speculating based on how quickly pre-sales are.
1214680	1218640	And we don't even know because we don't know the actual numbers that are being sold.
1218640	1223680	And with these game streaming services, games pass is on PC.
1223680	1227240	It's also on mobile devices and PlayStation now.
1227240	1233120	I think people fighting the old school console war on Twitter with Sony versus Microsoft
1233160	1235400	and Nintendo is kind of out there doing their own thing.
1235400	1237720	I think they're gauging the wrong battle.
1237720	1242480	I think if you're in Phil Spencer's shoes, the battle you're looking at is what I just
1242480	1243480	mentioned.
1243480	1248240	They want to at the end of this generation have way more Xbox Game Pass subscribers than
1248240	1253480	there are PlayStation plus subscribers or Nintendo online monthly subscribers.
1253480	1257000	That is the battle Microsoft is going to fight.
1257000	1260080	The Nintendo online one.
1260080	1262200	I wouldn't even try to compare with them.
1262200	1264720	It's just like it's not even the same type of thing.
1264720	1266800	And it's not even the same amount of money that they're making.
1266800	1267800	I know.
1267800	1268800	But I had to include it.
1268800	1275040	I'm chewy, too, because because again, tomorrow, Nintendo could change this conversation, right?
1275040	1276960	I know we're all sitting here cynical.
1276960	1278520	They're not going to.
1278520	1279960	I accept that.
1279960	1281400	And I agree with it.
1281400	1286560	But let's also agree with the fact that if they wanted to tomorrow, Nintendo could change
1286560	1288360	this conversation.
1288360	1291680	No, they can't, actually.
1292200	1293520	No, they won't.
1293520	1294520	And they can't.
1294520	1295920	I'm going to go on the record.
1295920	1296920	They can't.
1296920	1299320	They cannot change this conversation in one day.
1299320	1302600	There is no announcement that they can make that would change this conversation.
1302600	1304600	All right.
1304600	1305600	Let's see.
1305600	1307600	Other comments in chat here.
1307600	1310280	Quest Buster says they're pushing the brand as a whole.
1310280	1313840	If the console doesn't beat the PlayStation 5 in sales, it's probably not as important
1313840	1319880	as expanding their ecology on everything else, not Sony or Nintendo.
1319880	1323800	And the break man says they're trying to expand Xbox as a platform far more reaching
1323800	1325240	than just a console.
1325240	1330320	Chewy 240 in chat says reoccurring revenue cash is king.
1330320	1331720	Correct.
1331720	1339520	What game saved an entire franchise and Square Enix from the brink of doom?
1339520	1341120	Final Fantasy 14.
1341120	1342780	Look it up.
1342780	1345040	That's why that game had to be fixed.
1345040	1346040	And it was fixed.
1346040	1348120	And it was fixed very well.
1348120	1353200	And what does Square Enix now thank for a lot of its revenue when Final Fantasy, you
1353200	1357560	know, some of the other titles weren't necessarily when Tomb Raider didn't sell as much as they
1357560	1360560	thought it would, which is ridiculous.
1360560	1361560	But you know what?
1361560	1363080	You all saw that headline, too, right?
1363080	1364880	But what game did they credit?
1364880	1366320	Mm hmm.
1366320	1367320	Anyway.
1367320	1371240	See it to be in chat says, I wonder if part of Nintendo being slow to roll some of that
1371240	1375560	stuff out is also because of related licenses potentially.
1375800	1381920	There is such a strong first party library, although most of what you see in the NES and
1381920	1385920	the SNES classics now is Nintendo's first party library.
1385920	1390480	To be honest, there aren't a lot of first party games left that aren't already on the
1390480	1391480	service.
1391480	1395080	There may be some tricky licensing things, but for the most part, all the first party
1395080	1399360	games that you would expect to see are out there.
1399360	1403720	Now they honestly don't think the licensing would be that expensive on those games.
1403720	1408760	To be honest, especially like, I'm sure they can because look at look at what the Wii
1408760	1409760	was.
1409760	1410760	You remember the Wii?
1410760	1413000	Well, you know, in the virtual console, how many games are on there?
1413000	1416800	And since and since you brought it up, like that's kind of where I was going with it,
1416800	1423360	is that but they still have yet to even tap into Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo
1423360	1431480	64, GameCube, Wii, Wii U, they there's all these things they haven't tapped into yet.
1431480	1433560	So I don't know.
1433560	1438400	Did you see that crazy rumor that at the next Nintendo Direct they're going to flack out
1438400	1439840	a Game Boy player?
1439840	1443640	I just it's I don't I don't buy it at all.
1443640	1447120	I don't buy it wouldn't be surprised, but like.
1447120	1449200	Once again, that's just like kind of trickling stuff.
1449200	1453160	It's just it's giving you enough just to like, OK, cool, I can justify the money that I'm
1453160	1458200	paying for this online thing, but like it's not really doing anything, it's just kind
1458200	1462040	of just the bare minimum.
1462040	1463520	I guess I don't know.
1463520	1465760	Should I say something that's going to get me in trouble?
1465760	1466760	All right.
1466760	1468720	Of course, always.
1468720	1471360	It's not worth it for Nintendo to put out the Game Boy player.
1471360	1476480	Those games don't hold up well at all, save for like Tetris, which wouldn't even be a
1476480	1479960	part of it anyway, because there's Tetris 99 and there's agreements with the Tetris
1479960	1480960	company.
1480960	1484840	I'm not saying the Game Boy wasn't important for its time and all that, but a lot of those
1484840	1488980	Game Boy games, y'all, they do not hold up well at all.
1488980	1492320	It would be way smarter for them to go to the Game Boy Advance.
1492320	1495840	Those games hold up a lot better because a lot of them are on the same level with things
1495840	1498040	like Super Nintendo and beyond.
1498040	1503800	So sorry if you don't agree with what I said, but that's like the tea as I see it.
1503800	1508320	Those Game Boy games do not hold up well at all, like they're not going to be fun to play.
1508320	1512400	You'll play them for like 15 seconds and just be like, oh, yeah, I loved this when I was
1512400	1513400	a kid.
1513840	1514840	All right.
1515960	1520920	So anyway, Bobby Black, I'm just going to go straight to the virtual boy.
1520920	1524280	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Pokemon Red Blue, not worth it.
1524280	1529040	Dead game, which is why they remade it twice.
1529040	1531440	And so it's not going to be a part of that collection.
1531440	1534880	Pokemon wouldn't be in there because and it was specifically red and blue.
1534880	1538860	They just remade it not that long ago as Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee.
1538860	1541480	So they're not going to put those games in there.
1541480	1545640	So anyway, now Orangewrite says maybe have them all.
1545640	1548400	OK, that I could go a little more for.
1548400	1554440	So I'm not saying there's like, oh, my gosh, there are zero games I would ever play, but
1554440	1558320	it's just like I just think a lot of those games, it's not going to carry the weight
1558320	1559720	that y'all think it would.
1559720	1563400	Anyway, we're getting really distant from the original topic, which was Microsoft acquiring
1563400	1564400	Bethesda.
1564400	1568440	Any other bullet points on that story you wanted to get out, Loki?
1569440	1577000	No, that was pretty much it is just they they own Bethesda now and, you know, now maybe
1577000	1582600	we will get an actual Fallout New Vegas sequel because now we have Obsidian and we have Bethesda.
1582600	1584800	So technically they can make it happen.
1584800	1587840	That's what a lot of people are saying.
1587840	1589240	That's cool if that happens.
1589240	1595300	But you know, that's kind of one of those like, you know, one phase of enlightenment.
1595300	1599140	But the biggest phase of enlightenment is why don't they work together on a new game?
1599140	1600580	That would be something really, really cool.
1600580	1604300	Like have them work together on a new franchise, although it wouldn't happen tomorrow.
1604300	1605300	So.
1605300	1606300	All right.
1606300	1611360	Anyway, I think this is going to be pretty exciting for the future for Microsoft as far
1611360	1616660	as like Elder Scrolls six and that coming to Sony.
1616660	1619860	I don't know, like I wanted to be really cynical and come on the show and say it's not going
1619860	1624420	to happen and they're just talking that way to reduce some of the negativity.
1624420	1629360	But I really do think it's different now and Microsoft is fighting a different fight.
1629360	1634120	And so they might just go ahead and still release Elder Scrolls six on PlayStation and
1634120	1639440	kind of like I said, it's going to be 70 bucks there or free on Game Pass, free on Game Pass
1639440	1641720	with your subscription.
1641720	1644300	And that's the battle Microsoft's going to fight.
1644300	1645300	We'll see.
1645300	1648980	But there's nothing to say that they couldn't do like a timed exclusive.
1648980	1650880	Oh, they could do a timed exclusive.
1650880	1657940	They could do that there's a whole new expansion or part of it that is only on Microsoft.
1657940	1660460	There's there's a lot of things they could do with it.
1660460	1663760	Spider-Man is only available in Elder Scrolls six on Xbox.
1663760	1670360	That'll show him Questbuster in chat says Obsidian might actually be happy doing their
1670360	1673920	own thing now with outer worlds and the world they created with pillars.
1673920	1677160	I'm sure they still have the Fallout universe in their heart, but they've probably moved
1677160	1678160	on.
1678160	1679160	Yeah.
1679440	1681280	They'll probably just move on to something new.
1681280	1685200	But maybe there could be like a remastering or something, something that would take less
1685200	1689720	resources than a whole new game, but like a remastering of New Vegas or revisiting that
1689720	1690720	somehow that I say.
1690720	1693800	I would love more than the remaster of Oblivion or New Vegas.
1693800	1695400	That would be cool.
1695400	1696400	Do you?
1696400	1697400	OK.
1697400	1703160	Do you think there's going to be the Skyrim one more time edition on PlayStation five
1703160	1705200	and Xbox Series X?
1705200	1707920	Will there be a Skyrim one more time?
1707920	1716320	One more for the road encore edition for the.
1716320	1719480	I could see that, but I feel like it's got to happen.
1719480	1722840	Like if they don't put Skyrim on Xbox one X.
1722840	1724880	I've already done like the enhanced edition.
1724880	1728800	I don't know if they're going to necessarily do that again.
1728800	1731360	It would be funny, but like, I don't know if it would do that.
1731360	1735600	I don't think unless they can justify getting the return on it.
1735600	1740240	I mean, they already have like the special edition as it is, and I don't know what new
1740240	1745680	the Xbox Series X will necessarily do with the special edition, like how that will upscale
1745680	1746680	stuff on that.
1746680	1751760	So I mean, that sort of could be like releasing it again.
1751760	1753440	I don't think they will.
1753440	1756080	Tiger Claw on chat says Skyrim remastered in 4K HDR.
1756080	1759820	Well, you know, it may just end up being one of the things where it's like enhanced backwards
1759820	1762400	compatibility on Xbox Series X.
1762400	1763400	Yeah.
1763400	1764900	And yeah, it already does.
1764900	1771100	And so maybe it's going to have further enhanced capability on Xbox Series X and they'll just
1771100	1775500	say to Sony, well, you don't really care about backwards compatibility on PlayStation.
1775500	1777580	So we're not going to enhance it for that.
1777580	1778580	Yeah.
1778580	1784020	I'm pretty sure that the PlayStation 4 and I want to say the PlayStation.
1784020	1787420	Oh, yeah, they've already enhanced Skyrim once.
1787420	1788740	Yeah, they've already enhanced it once.
1788740	1792060	I'm pretty sure it supports 4K and whatnot.
1792060	1793060	HDR.
1793060	1794060	Probably.
1794220	1797140	I don't know what the PC version does with the old engine, though, they're like, it just
1797140	1800140	doesn't look super great.
1800140	1802220	So like, I wouldn't even rebuild the whole thing.
1802220	1803980	You want to play it one more time.
1803980	1805100	One more time.
1805100	1806100	One more turn.
1806100	1807100	One more turn.
1807100	1816380	And I've got it on PC or my Xbox 360 and PlayStation 4.
1816380	1819580	Let's move on with the show and talk about the things we have been playing this week.
1819580	1823140	If it was Skyrim or what during how was your gaming week?
1823140	1827140	Again, Dark Sakura not here tonight because of the Jewish holiday, but we will see her
1827140	1831780	again next week and get caught up on everything that she has been playing throughout the week.
1831780	1834380	So Loki, how was your gaming week?
1834380	1837900	I picked up a breakpoint that we talked about last week.
1837900	1842460	The game looks kind of like Geometry Wars.
1842460	1843460	Oh, right.
1843460	1844460	That came out.
1844460	1845940	I need to pick that up, too.
1845940	1846940	Yeah.
1846940	1847940	Yeah.
1847940	1848940	So that's pretty cool.
1848940	1850940	It's very hard.
1850940	1856020	It's kind of you have to keep on your toes because your weapons keep breaking as you're
1856020	1857980	fighting through there.
1857980	1861060	So you have like all these different melee weapons that you get.
1861060	1865900	And of course, it's very similar gameplay and the aesthetic is very similar to Geometry
1865900	1868060	Wars, but pretty fun.
1868060	1869740	So I did play that a little bit.
1869740	1874100	I played a little bit of hot shot racing again, so that was pretty cool.
1874100	1875660	I'm really enjoying that game.
1875660	1885180	I actually went back and played some more Minecraft and a little frustrated with Microsoft
1885180	1888660	right now because I have a realm that I pay for.
1888660	1893060	And so I prepaid for that and then they want to be the pay again for my realm.
1893060	1898620	So it ended up charging me like three times for my realm subscription.
1898620	1902260	So obviously the Windows Store has some issues when it comes to that.
1902260	1907180	So I have to get a refund for those or something.
1907180	1908180	It's like seven bucks.
1908180	1909180	That's annoying.
1909180	1910180	So annoying.
1910180	1911180	Yeah.
1911180	1917500	And then I played a little bit of, well, actually quite a bit of Orna this week.
1917500	1918500	So I've been doing that.
1918500	1920300	I finally leveled up to 181.
1920300	1923440	I'm still kind of way behind because I don't play very often anymore.
1923440	1929860	And then I checked out Pokemon Go a little bit and played very little of that.
1929860	1932180	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
1932180	1937820	I think I've been slacking on the Orna front myself and I really got to like all these
1937820	1942780	randos started joining our thing and I think it's because, well, I think we've been leveling
1942780	1946840	up because as a, I want to say free company and it's not what it is, it's a guild or whatever
1946840	1947840	it is in that game.
1947840	1948840	I think we've been leveling up.
1948840	1954120	I think we're showing up now in like those first two pages of like open kingdoms because
1954120	1957060	we've been leveling up so much and that's why we're getting all these randos that are
1957060	1958060	joining us.
1958060	1960360	I just thought there was a lot of people that he didn't know, I'm like, who are all these
1960360	1961360	people?
1961400	1964280	And those, so I don't know what to do about all that.
1964280	1967900	As long as they're nice, like whatever, I guess it's the most important thing.
1967900	1970680	Just don't be a dick and you know, we'll have fun getting to know new people.
1970680	1972800	But yeah, I've been slacking off on Orna.
1972800	1976180	I probably have been playing more ingress than any of the other location based games
1976180	1980840	this week just because with all the quarantine and everything, and especially like the heat
1980840	1984460	and the smoke here in California the past couple of weeks, I have not been going outside
1984460	1988360	as much and the COVID 19 pounds is really starting to show.
1988360	1991400	So I'm trying to get walking and doing that stuff more.
1991400	1993320	So Ingress is a good motivator for that.
1993320	1999780	I did a mission banner yesterday at a giant park in the south area of Sacramento and it
1999780	2003740	probably took me like two hours of solid walking.
2003740	2007080	I'd stopped and did the portal scanning here and there too, but you know, that was a lot
2007080	2008080	of exercise.
2008080	2012760	So I'm just trying to do that, you know, let that game motivate the exercise because that's
2012760	2014660	when it's its best really.
2014660	2019540	As far as other games, I've been playing Final Fantasy 14 because I'm always playing that
2019540	2023720	still working on my crafters and my paladin leveling that up.
2023720	2027400	But then I've also been spending a little bit of time, quite a bit of time actually
2027400	2028840	on two other games.
2028840	2036000	I've been playing a lot of No Man's Sky again, thanks to the recent 3.0 patch, which we're
2036000	2037440	going to talk about later in the show.
2037440	2040240	So I'll save most of my thoughts for them.
2040240	2043780	But because of that patch, I was like, you know what, what the hell?
2043780	2044900	Let's do it again.
2044900	2047700	Let's start a universe from scratch and see what happens.
2047700	2052120	And I was just really happy with the universe I rolled into and on the planet where I established
2052120	2053460	my base and stuff.
2053460	2058920	I am now like further along and I'm now into 10 plus hours, which is probably more than
2058920	2061640	I've spent on any other playthrough in that game so far.
2061640	2065160	And I just, I am really, really loving that game right now.
2065160	2068920	I'm going to talk a little more later in the show about the patch and some of the things
2068920	2075160	that it changed and some of the old games that I revisited to check out some changes.
2075160	2078100	So I'll show you that later in the show.
2078100	2079680	Let's see other games I've been playing.
2079680	2083720	One other game I've been playing a lot of this week, Hades.
2083720	2087860	So I bought that on Steam a couple weeks ago.
2087860	2089940	And this week I said, what the hell?
2089940	2093280	And I double dipped and I bought it on Switch as well.
2093280	2097640	And I've spent several hours on that game.
2097640	2099120	That is fun.
2099120	2103600	Like it's, you know, for the roguelikes and for what it is, it has a very kind of like
2103600	2106560	Diablo-esque feel to it, but it isn't Diablo.
2106560	2108800	Like it isn't that kind of game at all.
2108800	2111880	It's kind of more like a rogue-like, it just kind of, I don't know, plays a little bit
2111880	2116400	like Diablo, but it is very satisfying going through all those different dungeons and the
2116400	2120960	way they've kind of told the story and have all the different characters that they do
2120960	2123480	in a game like that is pretty neat.
2123480	2125720	And the voice acting is very well done.
2125720	2129680	So yeah, I've been really enjoying Hades.
2129680	2136360	It's weird to have to fight that first boss over and over and over again as you kind of
2136360	2137880	keep getting further and further.
2137880	2142840	But you do feel yourself progressing and that fight feels like it gets easier and easier.
2142840	2145160	And then you kind of learn how to do it with other weapons and stuff.
2145160	2149440	So yeah, I'm loving Hades.
2149440	2150440	It's a really good game.
2150440	2153200	Probably one of the best games of the year, honestly.
2153200	2157180	Siya Tabiri in chat says, another streamer I follow on here is thirsty for every character
2157180	2158680	in Hades.
2158680	2159680	Don't blame them.
2159680	2161360	The character design is really well done.
2161360	2164120	You really only see like the one picture of most of them.
2164120	2166160	Well, they have different poses and things like that.
2166160	2170400	So it's interesting because they don't like move and are fully animated like you see in
2170400	2172520	a lot of games today, but it works.
2172520	2174160	I'm not saying you have to have that.
2174160	2176540	I just said the game is one of the best of the year.
2176540	2184580	It's just interesting how it is limited, but it still manages to tell the story and contribute
2184580	2187460	to a great game experience the way that it does.
2187460	2189900	Quest Buster says, I'm really tempted to get Hades.
2189900	2192860	At Dev says, I kind of want to try Hades too.
2192860	2194220	I'm going to endorse it.
2194220	2199420	I will try to do a stream of it later on, or maybe like a recorded YouTube or something.
2199420	2204020	I have another idea stewing in my head for more video on demand stuff, but I will try
2204020	2208220	to do some more narrated gameplay of that and why I'm into that game a little later
2208220	2209220	on.
2209220	2210220	But I am super into Hades.
2210220	2211220	Good game.
2211220	2214360	So that was pretty much my gaming week.
2214360	2216380	Some quick housekeeping.
2216380	2218900	There may not be a show in two weeks.
2218900	2221660	I will confirm next week.
2221660	2225440	It's very possible I'm going to be going on a little trip.
2225440	2228940	And yes, I realize everything that's going on in the world and all of those precautions
2228940	2229940	and things are going into it.
2229940	2230940	It's not flying.
2230940	2231940	It's driving.
2231940	2232940	Are going into that.
2233100	2237180	I may not be back in time for a show in two weeks, considering I haven't gone anywhere
2237180	2238180	in about six months.
2238180	2243940	I'm going to take a night off, but I will confirm that next week because I may actually
2243940	2244940	be back in time.
2244940	2246560	Still working out some of the details.
2246560	2250060	So yeah, that's that.
2250060	2255500	Also over at the voice geeks network, vog network.com, just a couple weeks ago, we launched
2255500	2259900	the vog roundtables where we get some different people together to discuss a current topic
2259900	2261260	going on in geek culture.
2261260	2264820	And this week, this was a good one because it wasn't gaming.
2264820	2268400	I want to make sure we're doing some like, obviously, I'm going to make a lot of gaming
2268400	2270020	content because it's my wheelhouse.
2270020	2272980	But once in a while, I'm going to challenge myself to do something outside of that too.
2272980	2276500	So this week, we did a panel on cosplay in the COVID era.
2276500	2280140	And we kind of talked about how cosplayers are passing the time when there's really no
2280140	2281980	in person conventions right now.
2281980	2286120	And there's some pretty neat ideas like we heard about.
2286120	2291020	We had Aria snark or Victoria formerly of shaking and crying here at the voice geeks
2291020	2292600	network was a part of the panel.
2292600	2296680	And she talked about how she was doing like a virtual Disneyland birthday party dressed
2296680	2297680	up in cosplay.
2297680	2298680	So this is a really neat story.
2298680	2299680	So check that out.
2299680	2302640	The vog roundtable over at vog network.com.
2302640	2306960	Big ups to anime jam session who showed up and participated with that as well.
2306960	2310240	Rama and Ichigo, who is a frequent guest on that show.
2310240	2315120	So all right, let's move on though to talking about the news.
2315120	2317240	So Loki, what's going on in the news?
2317240	2318240	Yes.
2318240	2323440	So Amazon had their big kind of, you know, event that they talked about all the different
2323440	2328160	things coming out from Amazon, I think it's like the Amazon fire stuff.
2328160	2333080	And one of the things that they talked about is a brand new service called Luna.
2333080	2340640	It is a paid game streaming service that allows subscribers to play PC games remotely on computers,
2340640	2344480	phones, tablets, and fire TVs, I believe.
2344480	2348600	So they're charging $5.99 a month.
2348600	2356680	And you get a curated library of PC games called, I guess, the Luna plus game channel.
2356680	2361680	And you can check out quite a few different games on there.
2361680	2366280	So some of the stuff that I noticed off, you know, top my head here looking at this, they
2366280	2368120	got some pretty decent stuff on there.
2368120	2372640	There's luminous on their control grid.
2372640	2378000	And then more indie titles, like they have two point hospital, over cook to rhyme Ubisoft's
2378000	2379000	in there as well.
2379000	2383280	A resident in there, South Korea, Valhalla.
2383280	2387560	So they've got, you know, some bigger titles and a mix of kind of smaller titles in there
2387560	2388560	as well.
2388560	2395080	But yeah, and then you can also purchase a controller, which kind of looks like a Nintendo
2395080	2400480	switch pro controller, but with purple, which I kind of like the way that looks.
2400480	2405480	And yeah, plus there's since, you know, they do own Twitch, there is integrated Twitch
2405480	2407560	functionality as well.
2407560	2414640	So you can actually stream directly from that to Twitch, which is kind of cool.
2414640	2420320	Do you know that comic where it's got the two characters and the one like has like a
2420320	2426560	neat painting or something and the character goes, you made this and then takes the painting
2426560	2430360	and the last frame is like, I made this, you know, that whole thing where it's like, they
2430360	2431600	stole the thing.
2431600	2432600	Yeah.
2432600	2435920	That is what Amazon just did to Google Stadia in my opinion.
2435920	2437520	Yes, pretty much.
2437520	2443080	I mean, the difference though, with this and Stadia obviously is this is similar to like
2443080	2450840	a games pass or PlayStation now service where Stadia is even less of a less attractive because
2450840	2451840	yeah.
2451840	2458800	And that's exactly why I'm like Amazon just kind of like just snatched it from Google.
2458800	2461960	And I just like, especially when it comes to like the Twitch integration, oh, it's all
2461960	2466680	those things that YouTube should probably already be at when it comes to Stadia.
2466680	2471740	And well, yeah, Stadia still not out of beta.
2471740	2476760	Don't we still not have open services out of that was supposed to happen the first quarter
2476760	2477760	of this year.
2477760	2478760	What the hell happened?
2478760	2483920	Well, besides COVID okay, but it's been, we're talking about online stuff.
2483920	2490880	What's that additional beta is that when us being in COVID and, you know, using a lot
2490880	2494320	more online services be additional beta testing.
2494320	2495320	Yeah.
2495320	2500760	But I guess developers and everything, but yeah, honestly, I like the way the controller
2500760	2501760	looks.
2501760	2502760	I like purple.
2502760	2504640	I mean, maybe I just need to get purple controller.
2504640	2505640	Yes.
2505640	2506640	We hear it.
2506640	2507640	The voice geeks network love purple.
2507640	2508640	Exactly.
2508640	2511080	So I mean, I don't know.
2511080	2514160	It's all right.
2514160	2518800	But like, I'm not going to probably buy it.
2518800	2519800	It's a neat idea.
2519800	2521920	I'm curious to see how that works out.
2521920	2526320	Hey, maybe they'll throw it into, you know, prime or something like that.
2526320	2527320	Oh, that would be great.
2527320	2528320	Prime.
2528320	2529320	Yeah.
2529320	2530320	And then you get that as well.
2530320	2531880	But I don't know.
2531880	2532880	We'll see.
2532880	2535960	You know, it's interesting because we just had this discussion last week and we had the
2535960	2540120	round table and everything about the mid roll ads on Twitch and Twitch, maybe not, you know,
2540120	2542880	making enough money right now and they're having to look at other ways to make money.
2542880	2547440	Well, I would think this might be one of the ways where Twitch can help the Amazon machine
2547440	2552160	make money that, you know, I'm not saying that, you know, it's maybe going to be enough
2552160	2557820	to keep Twitch running, but it is something that is going to add value to the company.
2557820	2562200	You know, the ability to, I would assume one day just jump right into these games that
2562200	2564960	streamers are playing.
2564960	2567360	And I see that happen a lot.
2567360	2571340	One game that Alan has been playing a ton of lately is Dead by Daylight.
2571340	2573440	He's been playing that game a lot.
2573440	2576880	He played, you know, he gets super into one game at a time and that's the game right now.
2576880	2581120	But what I see him doing, he has streamer friends.
2581120	2584140	He has, you know, two or three regular, he probably has more than that, but two or three
2584140	2588160	that I regularly see streamer friends and they'll be online and playing.
2588160	2592160	And when he sees them online and playing and there's a spot, he'll just jump in and join
2592160	2594240	and play the game with them.
2594240	2600040	And so that whole process, I just explained, is probably going to be very, very easy with
2600040	2601520	something like Luna.
2601520	2604680	You know, if you see your streamer friend playing the game, just click here to join
2604680	2606400	in.
2606400	2608880	If the streamer wants that and their privacy settings are set up.
2608880	2609880	Yeah.
2609880	2616080	So I mean, assuming that's how they set it up, which would be very similar to like Stadia,
2616080	2619120	but I just don't see a lot of people using that.
2619120	2624360	Like it seems like a cool idea, but like I don't think there's a lot of people playing
2624360	2630920	Stadia and honestly, like the folks that are streaming to YouTube or even Twitch, I don't
2630920	2635800	think that they're using these services.
2635800	2636800	I mean, I don't know.
2636800	2641240	Well, one reason you can't really, you can't really stream Stadia right now, anytime I've
2641240	2645400	shown Stadia here on OLR, I prerecorded it and then I showed it here.
2645400	2650400	You can't really stream Stadia because you can't have the bandwidth to send that all
2650400	2651400	up.
2651400	2654240	Well, maybe you do depending on your internet, but right now most people don't have the capability
2654240	2655240	to...
2655240	2656240	It's all remote.
2656240	2657240	Right.
2657240	2662360	But if Luna is integrated with Amazon and it's all tied together, then hypothetically,
2662360	2666520	you can kind of hit a button to stream your gameplay and it's going to stream from the
2666520	2670420	web services side and it would require...
2670420	2671880	That's how Stadia works as well.
2671880	2675680	It's just Stadia sucks, but that's how it works as well.
2675680	2678760	It streams from Google's cloud services or whatever.
2678760	2679760	To YouTube?
2679760	2680760	Yeah.
2680760	2681760	To YouTube.
2681760	2682760	Oh.
2682760	2688240	That's because that's how it does, for example, if your PC or whatever you're streaming on
2688240	2692840	can't handle 4K or something like that, so you're playing in 1080p or something.
2692840	2695460	When you stream it to YouTube, it's actually in 4K.
2695460	2701560	The fact that I, a streamer, don't even know about that whole stuff, I thought I read that
2701560	2706200	that was going to be a thing, I didn't realize that it was already baked in, says a lot
2706200	2707200	about Stadia.
2707200	2708200	Yeah.
2708200	2709200	Well, okay, so...
2709200	2712840	Once again, don't care because it's Stadia and I'm not buying games on that service and
2712840	2715400	I'm not using it and...
2715400	2717800	So I don't care, sorry.
2717800	2722680	I think depending on the game, especially when it comes to MMOs and things that are
2722680	2727920	specifically multiplayer, I think there will be a place for jumping right in with your
2727920	2731560	favorite streamer, just like Alan does already with something like Dead by Daylight.
2731560	2737200	Unfortunately, a game like Control, a game like Luminous, a game like Res Infinite, those
2737200	2740600	are all fantastic games, but they're not games you're going to jump in and play with your
2740600	2741600	favorite streamer.
2741600	2743320	It's going to take the right game.
2743320	2744320	Something like...
2744320	2748240	You know the game Luna needs tomorrow?
2748240	2749680	Among Us.
2749680	2751120	Hello!
2751120	2755640	That's like a 10-person game and that would be a great one that you could just...
2755640	2759960	How often do I see that being played on a Twitch where then one person has to go and
2759960	2762800	it's like they have a hole in the game so they have to change the rules or they have
2762800	2765080	to have a rando, which gets weird.
2765080	2766080	Hello!
2766080	2770760	That's the game that you would be able to jump in and easily play with your friends.
2770760	2776720	Or something like 100 vs. 1, a Fortnite, a Tetris 99.
2776720	2777720	What's that?
2777720	2778720	It's like free and mobile.
2778720	2779720	Yeah, it uses ads.
2779720	2781640	It's like five bucks, you know?
2781640	2782640	So...
2783640	2784640	Just pay the five dollars.
2784640	2785640	I mean, it's...
2785640	2787480	I don't know.
2787480	2791640	But that integration would still go a long way, I'm just saying.
2791640	2792640	Yeah.
2792640	2793640	Anyway.
2793640	2798680	So are you interested in more about Luna or...
2798680	2799680	Probably not really.
2799680	2800680	No.
2800680	2806480	Funny enough, even though I'm kind of wary about having Amazon have access to cameras
2806480	2812000	in my house, that camera thing that they've got on the drone camera that they have is
2812040	2813440	kind of cool.
2813440	2816440	But aside from that, I don't know.
2816440	2818080	I do like the drone camera.
2818080	2819080	That's kind of neat.
2819080	2820080	But...
2820080	2821080	Well, we have that...
2821080	2822080	What is it?
2822080	2823080	Ring or whatever?
2823080	2824080	We have Amazon's camera thing in our house.
2824080	2825080	That's what it is.
2825080	2830960	It's a Ring camera, but it's a drone, so it flies around your house in film stuff.
2830960	2832000	That's kind of cool.
2832000	2837320	Someone in Amazon HQ wants to watch me walk from the bedroom to the shower.
2837320	2839760	I hope they enjoy what they see, honestly.
2839760	2840760	It's just...
2840760	2841760	Whatever.
2841760	2844520	I don't care.
2844520	2846520	Camera's not pointed that way anyway.
2846520	2847520	Anyway.
2847520	2855240	For me, the Amazon Luna streaming, it's a great example of what I just said about now
2855240	2859760	Microsoft is way far out in front of the competition.
2859760	2865480	I kind of look at this and I go, oh, this is cool, but I have Game Pass already now,
2865480	2866480	and there's like...
2866480	2867480	I don't really see...
2867480	2868880	There's some nice games here.
2868880	2873500	The ones I would want to play, I pretty much already own already, though, so this is cool.
2873500	2877440	This would have been a lot better two years ago.
2877440	2883200	This is a perfect example of when I say Microsoft is way far out in front, and the other people
2883200	2885240	are going to take too long.
2885240	2887360	This is a great example of that.
2887360	2890800	Luna's getting out the door about two years too late.
2890800	2899080	And I would say, though, that probably this is already a step up from Google Stadia, just
2899080	2900580	from their initial offering.
2900580	2901760	Just sounds better anyways.
2901760	2902760	There's more games.
2902760	2903760	It doesn't...
2903760	2906440	You don't have to pay for each additional game.
2906440	2912320	I get it that Google Stadia has that library that's available, but that's not the same
2912320	2914760	thing.
2914760	2917760	That's like calling what PlayStation Plus has the same thing as Game Pass.
2917760	2919160	It's not the same thing.
2919160	2921280	So I just...
2921280	2926320	I think it's already a little bit better, but still that's like...
2926320	2927680	It's not all that attractive.
2927680	2931320	That's like saying, you know, this...
2931320	2936640	To go back to the analogy that we were using earlier, Google Stadia's Crackle, although
2936640	2939760	I don't think you have paid for Crackle, but let's just say that you did.
2939760	2945240	So Google Stadia, or maybe it's like Voodoo, okay, so it's not necessarily...
2945240	2954880	It's Voodoo to Amazon's Quibi, but it's not going to compete with Hulu or Netflix.
2954880	2957360	Now that's just mean to call it Quibi.
2957360	2958360	Come on.
2958360	2959880	That's mean.
2959880	2962880	Don't do that.
2962880	2966480	It's not as good as obviously the other stuff, but you never know.
2966480	2967480	It could get better.
2967480	2970000	I mean, and it already has like the opportunity to do that.
2970000	2972060	I'd like to see what they're going to do with it.
2972060	2976100	And whatever happened to all these games that Amazon was supposed to be putting out,
2976100	2978380	like, don't they have some games that they're working on?
2978380	2981180	Like I thought there was some Amazon game studios or something that...
2981180	2987220	Yeah, the RPG, I keep seeing some people playing it on Twitch.
2987220	2988820	I don't know if it's still like...
2988820	2989820	Oh, right, right, right.
2989820	2994500	Is it the one that's like a Fortnite, but like it's like a Battle Royale...
2994500	2997060	No, Spellbreak, that's not an Amazon thing.
2997060	2998060	Okay.
2998060	2999060	That's not...
2999060	3000060	Okay.
3000060	3001060	No.
3001060	3002060	Okay.
3002060	3003060	Thank you, Questbuster.
3003060	3004060	Oh.
3004060	3005060	Preview events is what it is.
3005060	3006060	New World.
3006060	3007060	Got it.
3007060	3008060	All right.
3008060	3009060	Moving on.
3009060	3010860	Let's talk about No Man's Sky.
3010860	3015320	So No Man's Sky is a game that I've been playing an awful lot of this week, and pretty much
3015320	3020700	the catalyst for me jumping on it again was the 3.0 update.
3020700	3025860	So there was a big 3.0 update called Origins, and what did Origins do?
3025860	3030460	So the Origins update added billions of new planets, apparently.
3030460	3036400	They also changed the diversity of flora and fauna, also changing different weather systems
3036400	3038940	and making more dramatic terrain types.
3038940	3042600	So basically they're saying in a short, it changes pretty much everything, and as far
3042600	3047700	as like the look of the game and what you encounter on the planets, it definitely does
3047700	3050240	change a lot of things.
3050240	3056300	In this playthrough that I have, so I started over, and honestly, if you've spent like less
3056300	3059380	than 10 hours on your save file, just start over.
3059380	3062900	Like there's so much in the tutorial, there's so much that it walks you through and so forth
3062900	3068580	that you are going to have a lot to discover and see and do, and you're not going to feel
3068580	3072360	like you're retreading the same path because you're going to be on New Worlds and things
3072360	3075220	like that, and now everything looks a little bit different.
3075220	3080740	So I would say just start over, especially those of you guys that like bought No Man's
3080740	3085540	Sky back when it first launched and haven't touched it since, this is probably a pretty
3085540	3089080	good time to jump in and check that stuff out.
3089080	3091560	So I've been really enjoying my time with the game.
3091560	3096000	I've gotten further in, even though the story branches in multiple paths, so there isn't
3096000	3101200	like really a story, but I feel like I'm farther in a couple of those paths than I was ever
3101200	3105720	in any of my previous playthroughs, of which I've rebooted No Man's Sky like five times
3105720	3106720	now.
3106720	3110360	Yeah, I haven't played in a long time, and I was actually thinking about, you know, booting
3110360	3114300	it up on PC, which I haven't played at all because I purchased that when I was on sale
3114300	3118260	one time, and I was like, oh, I should really go back and play that because I haven't played
3118300	3119300	it since.
3119300	3120300	Yeah.
3120300	3121300	1.0.
3121300	3125340	And Bobby Blackwell says, did you start over on PC or PS4?
3125340	3130940	I started over on PS4, however, if you aren't already aware, No Man's Sky put in cross-play
3130940	3133060	like two patches ago.
3133060	3138060	So you will see a little icon now next to usernames that show you what it says.
3138060	3140500	I don't know how they handled the world naming.
3140500	3142900	Like if two people were in it, I don't know how they did that.
3142900	3145980	That didn't affect anything because I've been starting new games and such.
3145980	3147420	Have they reset all that?
3147460	3148460	I don't think they did.
3148460	3149780	In fact, I know they didn't.
3149780	3151740	I'm going to get to that in a minute.
3151740	3156500	But you have now if you have a friend code, basically, which I know is dumb, but it's
3156500	3157820	how they get away with it.
3157820	3161380	So basically what you do if you add somebody by their No Man's Sky friend code, then it
3161380	3164940	doesn't matter what platform they're on and you will see them on your No Man's Sky friend
3164940	3166920	list and you can interact with them and so forth.
3166920	3170500	So PC, PS4, Xbox, and it's on Game Pass.
3170500	3172420	So it doesn't matter anymore.
3172420	3175020	So that's that's the really good news about that.
3175020	3176020	Yeah.
3176020	3179620	And Questbuster says players have icons that can tell you if they're PC or PS4 players.
3179620	3180620	Yeah.
3180620	3183780	It has a little keyboard and mouse for PC and then Xbox has like an Xbox shape controller
3183780	3185480	and PS4 has PS4.
3185480	3187100	So yeah.
3187100	3193800	Now the base where I've established on is now I've called the planet MSEP for Main Street
3193800	3199620	Electrical Parade because it's one of those planets where like the flora and fauna glow
3199620	3202460	at night and it looks very neon.
3202460	3205780	It looks like Darnassus and wow, except more red than purple.
3205780	3209140	It's really pretty like the way it glows and I set up my base there and I really, really
3209140	3210140	like it.
3210140	3214300	Sorry, I should have got some video of it, but maybe I'll do a stream at some point or
3214300	3215300	something, but it's really pretty.
3215300	3216980	So I'm like really into this base.
3216980	3221860	I've actually built a place to land my ship so you can take off and not have the fuel
3221860	3224340	costs and all that stuff, which is pretty cool.
3224340	3227300	Bobby Blackwell says, do they have cross save?
3227300	3230700	Like can I play on a PS4 and just move to a PC with the same game?
3230700	3237660	I'm not sure, but I'm leaning towards no, just because I haven't seen it, but I would
3237660	3241540	Google it or something before I definitively answer that question because again, they've
3241540	3244180	been changing a lot with the game.
3244180	3248020	Now here's the downside to this patch.
3248020	3251420	And for people that have been playing the game a long time, some people may have built
3251420	3256620	their base on a really pretty planet before and that planet may have changed.
3256620	3258500	I didn't realize this was part of it.
3258500	3262940	When they talk about all the flora and fauna and all this stuff, they changed old planets
3262940	3264980	to put in all this new stuff.
3264980	3271100	Now they didn't go so far as to, if you were on a non-environmental hazard planet before,
3271100	3273140	suddenly you're on a toxic nightmare planet.
3273140	3277100	They didn't do that, but they definitely changed planets.
3277100	3282460	And so some people had their bases on these really like perfect planets and this update,
3282460	3283460	Oh great.
3283460	3287460	A volcano is now next to their base, you know?
3287460	3291960	And yes, there is now a weather circumstance where it can rain fire.
3291960	3295300	And I actually saw this on a planet where it was literally called that circumstance
3295300	3296300	2020.
3296300	3299140	It was, they probably should have.
3299140	3303840	Anyway, to put this together and show you what I mean, I actually have a little video
3303840	3305460	I'd like to show you here.
3305460	3309980	So those of you that have been following VOG for a while and maybe watched some personal
3309980	3314860	streaming that myself and Bobby Black Wolf do a couple of years ago during the 2.0 upgrade.
3315180	3317180	And yeah, it was like a couple of years ago.
3317180	3321920	We started building our bases on a planet called Blissey.
3321920	3324820	We called it Blissey because it was a peaceful planet.
3324820	3326300	It looked very earthy.
3326300	3328580	It looked very serene and peaceful.
3328580	3334060	I couldn't find any footage of this planet on my Twitch, in my clips, but I did find
3334060	3336020	some on Bobby Black Wolf's channel.
3336020	3340340	So here without permission is some footage from Bobby Black Wolf's Twitch.
3340340	3342060	So this is Blissey.
3342060	3345820	Now it's at night, but you can see, and I'll, I'll narrate over this a little bit for the
3345820	3346880	podcast listeners.
3346880	3348720	You can see it's very green.
3348720	3350360	It's very beach.
3350360	3354820	It's very, you know, and you see Bobby running from my base to his base, he's kind of jet
3354820	3355820	packing.
3355820	3358260	There's the occasional little animal there.
3358260	3361140	And you know, you can see like there was like one mountain in the distance and so forth,
3361140	3362140	right?
3362140	3365860	So this is the planet Blissey and you know, Bobby's got his base set up and all that fun
3365860	3366980	stuff.
3366980	3370260	Here is what Blissey looks like now.
3370260	3375740	So I booted up my old save file on my PlayStation five or my PlayStation five.
3375740	3378540	I wish my PlayStation four earlier today.
3378540	3379540	Look at that.
3379540	3380580	It's all pink.
3380580	3383140	Now there's this pink fauna.
3383140	3387540	Well for one, I spawned right on top of a toxic plant, which is kind of annoying.
3387540	3391860	So there's that now to deal with, but I kind of laughed when I saw it was all pink with
3391860	3396820	the flaunt, uh, with the fauna and stuff on the ground because excuse me, the flora fauna
3396820	3397820	would be the animals.
3397820	3398880	We'll get to that in a minute.
3398880	3403740	The flora is all pink and it made me laugh because Blissey is a pink Pokemon.
3403740	3405560	So that kind of cracked me up.
3405560	3407120	I was checking here in the interface.
3407120	3410680	This is just recorded live game players checking in the interface because I was like, why don't
3410680	3413780	you'll notice in the lower left, I don't see the actual planet.
3413780	3418720	We renamed it to Blissey, but I was seeing the old name and check out that gigantic monolith.
3418720	3421040	We just saw in the video was not there before.
3421040	3422680	So that was something that was added there.
3422680	3423680	Uh, yeah.
3423680	3426920	So even though the name in the corner says like Etome, some of the something, it's actually
3426920	3427920	the planet Blissey.
3427920	3429920	And you could see that in the online services.
3429920	3434240	I think that probably just has something to do with some of the changes and so forth.
3434240	3439760	Um, now what we're seeing in the footage, there are all of these animals everywhere.
3439760	3443280	Whereas in the old footage, you would see the occasional one animal.
3443280	3447420	There's like all these little turtle looking things everywhere now and so forth.
3447420	3452760	And now here's where I'm doing that exact same run to Bobby's base that he was doing
3452760	3453760	in the old footage.
3453760	3459100	You can see just how different the ground looks with the varied kind of like pink fauna
3459100	3463000	animals everywhere now that were in the old one and so forth.
3463000	3468000	So I'm scanning some of these animals, but as I am doing some scanning, one of the, so
3468000	3470600	a lot of this is like, cool, gray, awesome.
3470600	3471600	Looks great.
3471600	3473480	Let me show you the punchline.
3473480	3477040	Look carefully on the left hand side of the screen while I start to scan some of these
3477040	3479920	things where it talks about what is going on with the planet.
3479920	3482640	Look at the left side of the screen and for the podcast was just going to read it.
3482640	3488200	It says lethal humidity outbreaks.
3488200	3489200	Hold up.
3489200	3490200	Hold up.
3490200	3491200	So you're in Florida?
3491200	3492200	Hold up.
3492200	3500660	The planet Blissey, our peaceful, nice, quiet planet where we established our VOG bases
3500660	3504280	and here's me running to Bobby's base and it's going to show the message and so forth.
3504280	3512560	The lovely planet, serene, quiet Blissey has lethal humidity outbreaks.
3512560	3519260	I don't even know what that is to begin with, but sounds very 2020 as some folks are saying
3519260	3522080	in chat, but yeah.
3522080	3527220	So anyway, that just kind of cracked me up there as we were doing that.
3527220	3530320	So anyway, there it is.
3530320	3535740	A look back at, or a look forward as well as a look back at No Man's Sky.
3535740	3540640	So anyway, I do recommend the patch and checking out No Man's Sky.
3540640	3541640	It's pretty cool.
3541720	3545280	So, all right, let's go ahead and move on with some more stories.
3545280	3547720	Loki, what do you have for us up next?
3547720	3549080	All right.
3549080	3555960	So Among Us is obviously very popular as of late and as such, the developers behind the
3555960	3561420	game announced that Among Us 2, which was originally announced almost 40 days ago has
3561420	3562420	now been canceled.
3562420	3569180	They have canceled it because they are working on continuing to support the original game
3569180	3572060	and the content for that because it's so popular.
3572060	3573220	So it makes sense.
3573220	3580080	You don't want to just like, you know, separate the crowd they're playing Among Us among two
3580080	3581080	different games.
3581080	3582740	Then you have to support two different games.
3582740	3588300	It's just easier to put the content into the original one, which yeah, I'm fine with that.
3588300	3590260	So pretty cool.
3590260	3592260	Yep, yep.
3592260	3596400	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I feel for the devs because the original game's code
3596400	3601000	base sounds unwieldy to add to, like Minecraft's was, and they wanted to start over with all
3601000	3602000	the lessons they learned.
3602000	3603000	Yeah.
3603000	3606680	So it's an interesting kind of side effect of the game becoming so popular.
3606680	3609960	It's almost like, oh crap, now we're stuck with this now.
3609960	3615000	I mean, I get, they could have just done a part two, but maybe they're worried like,
3615000	3619200	and I get it like a part two, there's a lot of risks that come with that, you know?
3619200	3626360	Yeah, they could, I could see them doing something similar to like, well, probably a bad example
3626360	3631520	but what Ingress did where they just, you know, redid the scanner, completely redesigned
3631520	3632880	it from the ground up.
3632880	3634240	They could do that with this game.
3634240	3638720	So number two is technically number one, it's just like 2.0 or something like that.
3638720	3639720	Oh.
3639720	3641540	They just replaced the whole thing.
3641540	3645080	We were just talking about a game that did something like that actually.
3645080	3647560	So I guess that would make a lot of sense, right?
3647560	3648560	Right, exactly.
3648560	3652120	So I could see him doing something like that, but no, at least as long as they're still
3652120	3654600	continuing to support it, I think it's still pretty good.
3654600	3655600	Yeah.
3655840	3656840	Okay, fair enough.
3656840	3657840	All right.
3657840	3660440	Well, let's move on talking about other updates.
3660440	3665180	Let's talk about Animal Crossing, which is going to be getting a pretty large fall update.
3665180	3669020	So there's going to be some Halloween events coming to Animal Crossing.
3669020	3671040	Of course, there has to be Halloween events, right?
3671040	3672040	Because all the games have had them.
3672040	3673040	Yeah.
3673040	3676760	And if you didn't know this about Animal Crossing, you can't just data mine it off the disc,
3676760	3680920	the cartridge, whatever the files now, because they didn't even put in the holiday events
3680920	3683700	because they didn't want people, or they probably weren't done yet, but they don't want people
3683700	3685240	spoiling them either.
3685240	3688120	So now they're going to be patching in the Halloween events since Halloween's coming
3688120	3689120	up.
3689120	3694120	And there's Jack the Lantern is going to be somebody that visits.
3694120	3699140	He'll have Halloween goodies, and there'll be a Halloween event and game with candy that
3699140	3701000	you buy and you give it to residents.
3701000	3704580	There are also going to be pumpkins in the game, and it's going to be part of crafting.
3704580	3708520	So no word if I'll get my pumpkin spice latte, but I imagine there'll be things like pumpkin
3708520	3712400	chairs, pumpkin couches, pumpkin beds, which sounds fun, I guess.
3712400	3716400	It is all launching this coming week, September 30th is when the new update is coming.
3716400	3721760	Nintendo put out a video to their social media channels that shows everything to look forward
3721760	3722760	to.
3722760	3727780	There's going to be another patch that will introduce the holiday events coming in November,
3727780	3733540	and I imagine they're not going to want to patch it in late December because of the holidays.
3733540	3736520	Even if the holidays are a little different in Japan than they are here, it's just still,
3736520	3739200	it's not a good time to be doing those patches.
3739200	3744720	So November is probably when we're going to start to see that stuff pasted or patched
3744720	3748240	into the game.
3748240	3751120	On that note, I haven't touched Animal Crossing in a couple of weeks now.
3751120	3755000	I think it finally wore off for me.
3755000	3758520	That big stream we did a couple of weeks ago was probably like the last hurrah.
3758520	3761960	I've played a couple of times since then, but I just got frustrated with the fact that
3761960	3764400	I was not getting any more photos from villagers.
3764400	3767720	I was visiting every single day, trading stuff, and I was not getting pictures.
3767720	3771000	And I was like, you know what, there's nothing else for me to do in this game right now.
3771000	3772320	I'm going to go play Hades instead.
3772320	3775840	Yeah, my wife's been playing that to get photos now.
3775840	3780120	So she's been doing that and remodeling some of the island stuff.
3780120	3781120	Maybe the fault.
3781120	3785200	I mean, I would be lying if I said, oh, I'm not going to check it out anymore because
3785200	3787040	I'm certainly not anti-Animal Crossing or anything.
3787040	3789800	It's just, I think I just kind of wore the game out.
3789800	3793520	But I think it's nice that this is coming because this will give me a reason to boot
3793520	3797160	it up again and probably check it out a little bit.
3797160	3800560	And yeah, I'll probably try to craft some of the pumpkin furniture and see what that's
3800560	3804200	all about because, you know, everybody knows I love my pumpkin spice and stuff like that.
3804200	3808720	So I'll see what kind of fun things I can craft to fit that theme.
3808720	3813080	But then I'll probably get my time taken over with other games again.
3813080	3815280	It tends to happen.
3815280	3819240	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I haven't booted Animal Crossing since early July.
3819240	3823120	I'm going to boot it up and find that my village is all flowers everywhere.
3823120	3829640	I don't I'm my understanding is that the towns don't become overrun with weeds anymore.
3829640	3833920	Like you'll get a day or two worth of weeds, but you're not going to have to clean up like
3833920	3839740	a month worth of weeds or flower because the game, if you're not there, it doesn't rain.
3839740	3841920	It's kind of the logic that the game follows.
3841920	3846200	So if you booted it up tonight, you'd probably find that, yeah, you have a couple of days
3846200	3849140	worth of damage, but it's not nearly as bad as you would think.
3849140	3852940	And in some of the other games, have you been gone for a few months and villagers will reach
3852940	3856580	you a little bit for not having checked in for a while, but then they'll just go on like
3856580	3857580	nothing's ever happened.
3857580	3861260	Like, oh, you just took a little vacation, whatever.
3861260	3864420	Black and Pat says, I haven't booted it since Memorial Day weekend.
3864420	3865420	Yeah.
3865420	3867560	So there's a lot of people haven't checked in in a while to have it.
3867560	3871740	If you're gone for a long time, that said, he just shouts at you for a while.
3871740	3872740	Yeah.
3872740	3873740	That would be fun.
3873740	3877380	See a Tiberian chat says, I still log in at least once a day.
3877380	3879700	So it's just different for everybody.
3879700	3883360	And Bobby says, I did hear that villagers don't move out while you're gone.
3883360	3884540	They used to in other games.
3884540	3889880	That is also true because remember, villagers always ask for your permission to leave now.
3889880	3891340	That is different from the other games.
3891340	3893580	They used to just like leave.
3893580	3897260	Like you turn on the game one day, bye, I left, I moved over and I packed my shit and
3897260	3899040	left last night.
3899040	3903780	And they don't do that anymore, which considering that the game is played by a lot of kids is
3903780	3909180	probably a good thing because you know, there would be kids that would be gutted if a particular
3909180	3912580	villager left their town overnight, because that's what happened to all of us and the
3912580	3913580	GameCube version.
3913580	3915580	Um, so yeah, that doesn't really happen.
3915580	3917420	They didn't care about our feelings at all.
3917420	3918420	Yeah.
3918420	3920140	Back then game companies didn't care about you.
3920140	3926300	So anyway, uh, no one special 77 chat says people probably have checked in on their Neopets
3926300	3927340	in decades.
3927340	3929460	They're probably all decomposed by now.
3929460	3930460	Digital dust.
3930460	3931460	No.
3931460	3934220	If you log into Neopets, if you can remember your login and password, they're all still
3934220	3935220	there.
3935220	3939060	I believe they're probably changed a little bit, but, uh, no, your Neopets do not die.
3939060	3945900	If you haven't fed them in 20 years, um, it's magic and what's the point then.
3945900	3948220	All right.
3948220	3951280	Let's move on with more news Loki.
3951280	3955580	So this is kind of disappointing to hear from a first party company, but apparently Sony
3955580	3961500	has confirmed that there is no free PlayStation five upgrade for the PlayStation four Spider-Man.
3961500	3966500	Um, that's not to say that it's not incredibly confusing.
3966500	3968580	So let me try to explain it a little bit.
3969100	3970100	It's the way this works.
3970100	3975140	So if you purchase the original Spider-Man game on PlayStation four, well, you're not
3975140	3982040	going to get an upgrade to the PlayStation five without rebuying the Marvel's, um, Spider-Man
3982040	3986740	Miles Morales, which the ultimate edition on that is, I believe, I don't remember they're
3986740	3989720	calling out cross play or cross by or whatever.
3989720	3995140	So basically you get a PlayStation four and PlayStation five version from that.
3995140	3997820	And they throw in the original game as a bonus.
3997820	4002700	So they're making the original remaster, but they're not going to give it to you if
4002700	4006340	you've already paid them money, uh, allegedly.
4006340	4012860	And then, um, apparently though, there is also a $20 paid upgrade that you can bump
4012860	4016060	up the, um, Miles Morales ultimate edition.
4016060	4017060	I'm sorry.
4017060	4021900	So you can buy Miles Morales, um, version of the game and it's just that, or you can
4021900	4025740	buy the ultimate edition, which also throws in the original game as well.
4025740	4033660	Um, it's confusing, but this kind of just goes to show you how Sony is taking this next
4033660	4036060	generation of, um, consoles.
4036060	4043640	So they are basically making you pay for every little bit of upgrade and whatnot for these
4043640	4049020	games, much like some of these third party companies are, um, like Activision is wanting,
4049020	4051320	you know, $70 for their games as well.
4051320	4056320	Sony is also charging $70 for their games because they want the money from that.
4056320	4063520	This is why I am very skeptical on the fact that we will never see a service like games
4063520	4064520	pass.
4064520	4067960	I think, I mean, I guess they have PlayStation now, but it's not the same where it can download
4067960	4071080	the game, run it natively on the system.
4071080	4072680	Um, sure.
4072680	4073960	There'll be PlayStation two games.
4073960	4077780	And the fact that I think there's more PlayStation two games coming out this week, but they're
4077780	4079960	going to sell them to you.
4079960	4084160	They're not going to give them to you as part of this service or all inclusive thing.
4084160	4088280	They're going to piecemeal it all out to make as much money as they can off of it.
4088280	4093720	Um, whereas you have, you know, Nintendo also doing kind of a similar approach where they
4093720	4099720	don't want to put many titles in their online catalogs because they're worried that devalues
4099720	4100720	their titles.
4100720	4103360	That's why they never dropped the price on their titles.
4103360	4108440	Well and there's, there's also the answer as to why you never got like a, uh, Nintendo
4108440	4116200	64 mini is because with the Nintendo 64 mini, um, you would now have Mario 64 included.
4116200	4121120	And that's something that they want you to get in the Mario three D all-stars.
4121120	4126840	I think it's also because they couldn't redo the hardware that they had because the SNES
4126840	4134840	mini and the Nintendo mini, the NES mini, I guess, um, both ran on identical hardware.
4134840	4141160	And so they could essentially just repurpose that they can't do that for Nintendo 64.
4141160	4143920	It barely works.
4143920	4150480	You can put into the 64 games on those consoles if you mod them, but it doesn't run well.
4150480	4153400	They would have to develop new hardware for that.
4153400	4155800	And so there's a cost associated with that.
4155800	4159880	Plus the system would have to be more expensive and it's whether they're going to make their
4159880	4160880	money back on it.
4160880	4163680	So it's just not cost effective for them to do that one.
4163680	4169720	They could just put out, you know, as collection of emulated games and sell for 60 bucks.
4169720	4170720	Yeah.
4170720	4174480	Uh, I don't think this is the right call for Sony.
4174480	4178600	Um, you know, I understand games cost money to make, they've got to pay the people to
4178600	4179600	develop them.
4179600	4184640	Um, I would have been a little more comfortable maybe with a paid upgrade that isn't quite
4184640	4186160	the full cost of the game.
4186160	4189760	Um, but I think this decision might bite them a little bit because I can tell you for me
4189760	4193600	personally, I never did get Spiderman for PlayStation four.
4193600	4196800	I probably would have when it went on a big sale later on.
4196800	4199000	Um, but I can tell you, I'm not going to now.
4199000	4201720	Now that I know it's not going to upgrade to the PlayStation five version, well, I'm
4201720	4205360	just going to hold off until I get a PlayStation five, then I'll revisit Spiderman at that
4205360	4206360	point.
4206360	4209360	Um, wrong call in my opinion.
4209360	4216000	And again, it's something that the competition, Microsoft is approaching a bit differently.
4216000	4219640	And uh, I just, I hate to see it.
4219640	4220640	It's a little frustrating.
4220640	4221640	I get it.
4221640	4222640	That not everything is free.
4222640	4223640	Yeah.
4223640	4224640	There does.
4224640	4226920	It's some of the stuff does cost money.
4226920	4233000	My take on it though, is that the additional assets that they're creating for miles Morales,
4233000	4236040	I mean, they're creating a PlayStation five version, so they have to create the assets,
4236040	4238960	whether they're not, you know, whether or not they're going to be using it for this
4238960	4241300	original game or not, they're already being created.
4241300	4244520	They're already selling you that, that game anyways.
4244520	4249200	Like I don't understand if they already have this version of the game available, like how
4249200	4251640	much money are you really losing on that?
4251640	4255400	I mean, it's just, it's just weird though, that they wouldn't do that.
4255400	4260200	I guess that the point is that, well, if you really want to remaster, then you'll want
4260200	4263720	to purchase this additional thing, but they're just trying to get another sale out of you.
4263720	4267600	Or as Microsoft, I think would just, a lot of these are free upgrades.
4267600	4268600	How about this?
4268600	4272640	You know, cause this would go back to the point I made earlier about, I think that,
4272640	4278060	you know, no, Microsoft will not sell as many Xboxes this generation as Sony sells PlayStation
4278060	4279060	five.
4279060	4283900	And especially when you factor in Japan, however, uh, that's not the fight Microsoft's fighting.
4283900	4288340	Again, it's about how, who has more subscribers to their service at the end of this generation.
4288340	4295780	And so my point is, what if Sony made it free for PlayStation plus to get those upgrades?
4295780	4300900	And now that would be an added benefit about PlayStation plus that could be interesting.
4300900	4301900	And I could go for that.
4301900	4302900	Yeah.
4302900	4306700	But they're not going to do that because of course they're not, but I'm trying to, I'm
4306700	4308820	trying to get her online play.
4308820	4311140	And so it's, it's not an, it's on an upsell.
4311140	4315820	They give an answer that still gives Sony some money.
4315820	4319680	I'm trying to go to a reasonable answer that still allows Sony to get some money.
4319680	4320820	They want all of the money.
4320820	4324940	That's why they won't give up Spiderman for the MCU and stuff because they want, they
4324940	4325940	want that money.
4325940	4334900	And on, I mean, it just, it's, I don't know if people are going to remember it even beyond
4334900	4340140	like this, if they continue to do this, go down this path with this generation, but like,
4340140	4345540	it just, it's, it, what little money you're losing from this, you could build so much
4345540	4348460	goodwill from it, but they just don't care.
4348460	4352500	And it's, I don't know, they want all of the pennies.
4352500	4358880	So we'll see how that strategy pays off, but you know, again, I think when it comes to
4358880	4363460	places like Japan, it's not going to matter, you know, and Spiderman doesn't exist anywhere
4363460	4365220	besides PlayStation.
4365220	4368780	So they kind of get to call the shots.
4368780	4370860	Not a lot we can do about it besides not buy it.
4370860	4371860	So, yeah.
4371860	4372860	All right.
4372860	4373860	Moving on.
4373860	4379580	I want to talk a little bit about iOS and Microsoft getting an app on iOS, but it's
4379580	4381220	not quite the one you're thinking of.
4381220	4385140	It is not the whole cloud issue being resolved, but I'm going to come back to that point in
4385140	4386140	just a moment.
4386140	4391820	Let's we'll come back to that for now, though, an Xbox remote play app is coming to iOS.
4391820	4397260	So yes, this feature is being tested right now, and apparently it will allow you to connect
4397260	4403460	directly to your Xbox One or, of course, the upcoming consoles like Series X, S, et cetera,
4403460	4406200	and it will let you play anything that's on your system.
4406200	4411180	So it's kind of interesting that the cloud thing doesn't work, but this does, but since
4411180	4416660	you're connecting to your own system and it's, I guess there's just a difference there, and
4416660	4420240	it's all kind of like streaming within your own house or what have you.
4420240	4423880	So you will be able to use this app to do that.
4423880	4425940	Again, this is different from X cloud.
4425940	4428860	You are streaming from your own box.
4428860	4434200	So I don't think that means you could do that out off cellular.
4434200	4435620	Maybe you can.
4435620	4438320	Could you play off cellular to your own Xbox One?
4438320	4439720	I'll be a fan with hog.
4439720	4444280	Probably a lot of the networks out there, but when we finally get better 5G coverage
4444280	4446340	and there's a bandwidth out there.
4446340	4452060	Which if rumors are to be believed is going to be an iOS later this year is 5G.
4452060	4458780	Well, they can have whatever they want in iOS, but it's whether the networks are actually
4458780	4459780	out there.
4459780	4460780	That's going to matter.
4460780	4461780	Right?
4461780	4462780	Yeah.
4462780	4463780	So good.
4463780	4464780	They support it.
4464780	4465780	Great.
4465780	4466780	But like that doesn't actually build the network.
4466780	4468940	So, um, I don't know.
4468940	4470860	I don't know if the bandwidth's out there for that.
4470860	4477020	It would be a cool way to get around, uh, get around the whole iOS problem, you know,
4477020	4481480	just stream game pass to your console then stream that to your, I mean, there's more
4481480	4485140	latency built up there, but maybe it's not so bad.
4485140	4490020	Um, well, since you brought up getting around the iOS store, something we didn't talk about
4490020	4493760	in the Luna thing, which I think now's a good time to bring it up since we're talking about,
4493760	4498300	you know, Microsoft kind of finding a way into the app store, Luna has figured out how
4498300	4500020	to get an iOS app.
4500020	4502080	And basically what they're doing, they're doing something.
4502080	4507480	This has been around in iOS for a long time, but very few people actually make use of it.
4507480	4510020	And that is a web app.
4510020	4514380	Basically all you're doing, you're making a website bookmark and you, it launches like
4514380	4516460	it's an app because that's what it is.
4516460	4519420	It's a website bookmark that it's just an app on your phone.
4519420	4527020	And so Luna has figured out how to run in a Safari browser window at full speed.
4527980	4531660	Maybe this is something where Microsoft isn't at yet, but what's very interesting too.
4531660	4535620	If you look in some of the Microsoft legal filings and things like that, Microsoft or
4535620	4539220	Apple, I'm sorry, in the Apple legal filings.
4539220	4544660	And so that in the Epic versus Epic Apple versus Epic thing, good Lord, um, Apple has
4544660	4550940	even said if they went down this route of having web apps, this would not be an issue.
4550940	4552920	This is a solution for them.
4552920	4559340	It's just something they're not doing, um, because I believe the backloading of Fortnite
4559340	4564440	on Android devices to go around, uh, the store was a similar thing.
4564440	4568400	I think you were loading it from like a web app type of thing, and it wasn't quite as
4568400	4571160	well adopted as it was coming from the store.
4571160	4577760	So I think the, well, that one was downloading an APK on the iOS side.
4577760	4578760	I'm not sure.
4578760	4586360	The Android side, it was downloading a siloed in APK to load it in, but, um, that obviously
4586360	4592040	you get a whole bunch of popups saying, Oh, this is not secure, dangerous viruses beware.
4592040	4593920	Yeah, I get that.
4593920	4600260	So, um, so it's interesting, but Luna somehow is going to be, cause I can't think of a lot
4600260	4602960	of things I've actually saved as web apps.
4602960	4605660	I remember an early, early conversation.
4605660	4610620	Obviously Bobby remembers this too, um, where we were talking about like having like VOG
4610620	4615820	or maybe it was even the old network at one point having like a web app that would launch
4615820	4623380	and you could have the, I think the old networks radio player trying to encourage people to
4623380	4624660	install that as a web app.
4624660	4627420	And it's just, it's kind of hard to get that adoption.
4627420	4631860	So I kind of wonder how Luna thinks it's going to get adopted.
4631860	4634500	Maybe because it is, this is a much bigger deal.
4634500	4638820	This is not some indie podcast networks, little remote player.
4638820	4643620	This is how to play control and luminous and res infinite, and it's an Amazon product and
4643620	4646720	it'll be advertised on Twitch and all this stuff.
4646720	4649460	Maybe they figured they're going to get a better adoption rate for it, for the whole
4649460	4650900	concept of a web app.
4650900	4652200	I don't know.
4652200	4658020	But anyway, Microsoft could ultimately go down the same route if they can get X cloud
4658020	4661220	working in a Safari window.
4661220	4663700	Um, which we'll see.
4663700	4666820	You know, and I don't just mean working, I mean working well.
4666820	4671060	You know, because, you know, if it stutters, if it lags, that's all going to look bad on
4671060	4672060	Microsoft.
4672060	4673060	It's not going to look bad on Apple.
4673060	4674500	It's only bad on Microsoft.
4674500	4679880	So be interesting to see if they figure out a way to resolve that.
4679880	4684700	By the way, there's another app from Microsoft and Xbox coming to iOS.
4684700	4687420	So there's lots of apps for Xbox on iOS.
4687420	4689540	It's just not, you know, the one everybody's talking about.
4689540	4693980	In fact, I think most of our audience will probably not care about this, but some of
4693980	4694980	you will.
4694980	4697820	It's the Xbox Family Sharing app.
4697820	4700700	You know, Nintendo kind of has something like this too, and they have a cute little animation
4700700	4701700	for this.
4701700	4703940	And this is very common these days now.
4703940	4708480	It's basically an app from your phone that allows you to credit your kid or teen or whoever's
4708480	4713280	playing on the Xbox credit time, screen time, and you can limit it so that like they only
4713280	4716560	get an hour on the Xbox a day during the week.
4716560	4719840	Maybe you can add bonus time if they've done their homework, which is kind of interesting.
4719840	4724560	It actually shows the little concept video, like one of the kids in the house sending
4724560	4730200	a message to the parents app, can I have more time on the Xbox and the parent can like accept
4730200	4733720	or decline right there, which I think is kind of interesting.
4733720	4740280	Is this now, Loki, you have kids, they're not maybe quite at that age yet where they're
4740280	4741280	running this.
4741280	4744960	Well, maybe actually, maybe I don't know, you'd have to tell me, are they running the
4744960	4749240	consoles by themselves at this point, or do they still need your help?
4749240	4751780	And is this an app that you would use in your household?
4751780	4755080	I know you don't have Xbox, but hypothetically.
4755080	4757600	I don't have Xbox yet.
4757600	4759400	You ordered an X though, right?
4759400	4760400	Exactly.
4760400	4761400	Right.
4761400	4762400	Yeah.
4762400	4763400	I forgot to get into my game week.
4763400	4764400	Yeah.
4764400	4765400	I did get a pre-order for an Xbox Series X.
4765400	4767440	So we never talked about that.
4767440	4768440	Yeah.
4768440	4771200	We'll come back to that in a little bit, the pre-order game.
4771200	4777800	But I do actually use this because we have Microsoft accounts for, well, he has it for
4777800	4781800	Roblox and for Minecraft.
4781800	4786840	So he has to have a Microsoft store account in order to be able to do that.
4786840	4791400	I did have family settings on there at one point, but then it got like annoying because
4791400	4795160	we were trying to like do friends, like add each other as friends.
4795160	4798240	Like I was trying to have my youngest son and it just was a pain in the butt to get
4798240	4799240	it to work right.
4799240	4801960	I made him an adult nerd.
4801960	4805680	But now he still has to ask me for permission to be able to buy something from the store
4805680	4808720	because he doesn't have a payment card on file.
4808720	4811640	But it was annoying.
4811640	4817680	He's still a child account, but he took all the restrictions off of it as far as being
4817680	4821120	able to add friends and stuff like that.
4821120	4824940	Well, he sells the restrictions on it, but I had to do it to be able to add myself on
4824940	4827200	there as so we could all play together.
4827200	4833840	It's very frustrating to do the basic stuff on there, but they make it that way on purpose
4833840	4836800	so that you can really lock it down if you want.
4836800	4841480	But I get like emails and stuff of like how much time he's been spending in different
4841480	4842800	apps and stuff like that.
4842800	4845880	So yeah, so that would be kind of neat.
4845880	4851520	I mean, he just doesn't play Xbox and he's probably not going to be playing the Xbox.
4851520	4856400	No one special 77 in chat over Twitch TV slash vog network says on paper, this sounds good,
4856400	4857960	but in practice, I don't know.
4857960	4859600	The typical kid ain't stupid.
4859600	4863360	If you thought we were tech savvy as kids compared to our parents, kids nowadays are
4863360	4865720	more so they'll find a way around this.
4865720	4869960	Well, the tools do get better, but I will agree as some kids.
4869960	4872200	Well, some kids figure out how to social engineer.
4872200	4873200	That's what I did.
4873200	4874200	Wink.
4874200	4875200	You.
4875200	4879960	And what I mean by social engineer is, oh, I got to help you fix your computer here,
4879960	4882080	but it's asking me for your password to fix the computer.
4882080	4884720	What's the password?
4884720	4889040	And then you figure out your parents password by helping with something.
4889040	4890600	And oh, how about that?
4890600	4893840	It's the same password that lets me do these other things.
4893840	4899560	I'm not saying I did or did not do that as a kid.
4899560	4905680	But I will say my mom had a certain fondness for a certain Hawaiian Island.
4905680	4907680	Anyway.
4907680	4911520	All right.
4911520	4913240	Let's see.
4913240	4914240	Other comment.
4914760	4916000	In chat I was going to read right now.
4916000	4917000	So OK.
4917000	4921080	So we'll see what develops with these apps and so forth with Microsoft.
4921080	4923920	I'm curious to see if they jump on the whole web app thing.
4923920	4925520	We're going to get to the classic game of the week here.
4925520	4930720	But actually, before I do, let me insert because you reminded us here, yes, with all this talk
4930720	4935680	and it's been a fairly busy gaming newsweek between Tokyo Game Show and this huge news
4935680	4938560	about Microsoft and ZeniMax and all that going on.
4938560	4945360	So we didn't even talk about that Xbox Series X and S preorders happened this week.
4945360	4950280	And we mentioned on last week's show, I said I am going to preorder Xbox this time.
4950280	4953000	I did not preorder PlayStation 5 yet.
4953000	4955040	That will be a 2021 thing.
4955040	4957840	But I did decide to get Xbox Series X this year.
4957840	4960660	And Loki also decided to get on the Xbox game.
4960660	4964040	So how did it go for you with the preorder, Loki?
4964040	4966320	It was rather pain free.
4966320	4969360	I mean, sure, there were sites that were buggy and stuff.
4969360	4973680	So I tried getting it from a few different places at first, but then it kept saying sold
4973680	4977160	out.
4977160	4981200	I ended up getting it through Walmart originally.
4981200	4987480	And it like three times when I processed it, it kept saying that they were sold out, even
4987480	4988880	though I had got one.
4988880	4994400	And by the third time, then it finally went through, even though I was in like that confirm
4994400	4995400	thing.
4995480	4999640	I was just hitting confirm on it and it finally it went through once and I was like, cool,
4999640	5000640	done.
5000640	5005640	But like Amazon, I know immediately the site just crashed immediately or like we were getting
5005640	5012080	the you know, the something's wrong dogs, you know, and then Best Buy and even Microsoft
5012080	5013080	site.
5013080	5014460	It was just all like unavailable for a while.
5014460	5023120	So luckily, I was able to just be there right at eight when it went live and ended up taking,
5023120	5027520	you know, a preorder with Walmart site before I had like some other stuff.
5027520	5030400	So it just made sense to do it there.
5030400	5031660	Congrats.
5031660	5034240	So I was looking right at eight a.m.
5034240	5035720	I was trying to look at a few sites.
5035720	5040800	I was trying to look at Costco because that was on the original list on Microsoft's original
5040800	5041800	press release.
5041800	5042800	Costco is there.
5042800	5044800	I don't think they ever did take preorders to Series X.
5044800	5046040	So I'm sitting there trying to load it.
5046040	5047040	Nothing's showing up.
5047040	5048400	So I'm like, whatever.
5048400	5049560	I'm just going to kind of do it.
5049560	5050800	A lot of people on Twitter do it.
5050800	5056560	And I'm going to watch that Wario 64 account, which, you know, hey, props to the guy.
5056560	5061880	He's very good at or I guess it could be gal or non-binary running that account because
5061880	5062880	they've never shown their face.
5062880	5065200	It's just a personality.
5065200	5071280	So with Wario 64 account, they get like all the latest, you know, oh, these sites are
5071280	5072280	preordered into.
5072280	5077940	Now, if you didn't know this, they're hiding referral codes in those Amazon links.
5077940	5083420	So all y'all that were using that account for your Amazon like that guy just got a salary
5083420	5087700	for the whole month off all and probably then some from all your preorders for the Xbox
5087700	5089620	Series X and PlayStation 5.
5089620	5090620	You know what?
5090620	5091620	Yeah.
5091620	5092700	You know what he's doing?
5092700	5094280	He's doing a service.
5094280	5095280	You're using the service.
5095280	5096440	It's not costing you anything.
5096440	5098180	So I'm not I'm not hating on him.
5098180	5102460	I'm just saying that's you know, that ain't nothing free, bitch.
5102460	5105440	Anyway, that's what I'm saying.
5105440	5111520	So I was watching that account in one window and I saw that Target was up and I was having
5111520	5114020	that problem where I'd add it to the cart.
5114020	5115020	My cart doesn't load.
5115020	5117980	My cart's empty and all that other stuff.
5117980	5120660	So I was just hitting the wall and I was like, why is Amazon up?
5120660	5121820	Why is Amazon up?
5121820	5126640	Then I see that tweet from Wario go up that says it's up on Amazon.
5126640	5131060	But instead of clicking the link, I went and I wasn't doing it to be a bitch and go around
5131060	5132060	the referral.
5132060	5136160	I was doing it because I didn't know what that was going to link to.
5136160	5138660	And I wanted to make sure it was everything.
5138660	5141040	I wanted to make sure it was the right vendor.
5141040	5146660	So I searched Xbox Series X and I did confirm it was a Series X.
5146660	5151680	Yes, I heard the stories about the 1Xs that went up and sailed, but it was a Series X.
5151680	5155980	And I went in and I preordered it and I got it.
5155980	5158880	And then I heard the link's not working, all this other stuff.
5158880	5160080	Like people were complaining about the links.
5160080	5161800	I think what happened.
5161800	5165680	I think to get around bots or to get around the site getting hammered, I think Amazon
5165680	5170780	was cycling those links or killing those links like every 60 seconds.
5170780	5172720	I really think that's what they were doing.
5172720	5177700	So I think searching for it by hand allowed me to get in there pretty early and problem
5177700	5179080	free.
5179080	5183820	However, like many of you about a week later, no, not a week later, but a few days later,
5183820	5186280	I got that email from Amazon.
5186280	5190360	We're sorry to inform you that because of the demand of this item, you may not get it
5190360	5195160	on the day, but everybody got that email for the Xbox and everybody got that email
5195160	5197400	for the PlayStation 5.
5197400	5203900	I don't know why it's so fucking difficult for these stores to handle this, especially
5203900	5205120	in the PlayStation 5.
5205120	5209320	I get it because it was, you know, all the oxygen free free for all.
5209320	5216740	But in the Microsoft side, everybody knew when this was coming.
5216740	5221320	And so it's a little difficult and it's a little disappointing to see that the sites
5221320	5227360	still could not handle it.
5227360	5231140	Concert tickets seem to work, but we might have to look at getting another system or
5231140	5236060	something to preorder because this is getting really annoying.
5236060	5237060	I don't know.
5237060	5241460	I would have thought that Sony doing it the way they were doing it where you would sign
5241460	5243500	up to do a preorder.
5243500	5250300	I thought that was going to work, but Sony was completely unclear and not transparent
5250300	5256140	on who got invited to do it and when they made it sound like only Sony elite were going
5256140	5257600	to be able to do it.
5257600	5259340	And so that was kind of stupid.
5259340	5266560	So I really wish other retailers might adopt a similar strategy where you sign up in advance
5266560	5271940	and you have to have either like you've you've to F-age your to F-age your phone number.
5271940	5275140	You have to have an existing account where you've bought at least one item on the site
5275140	5279980	somewhere or something that would make it a lot harder for bots and scalpers to get
5279980	5280980	in there.
5280980	5282980	I don't know.
5282980	5284100	Some other stories in chat.
5284100	5288860	Black Compat says it took me an hour to check out my cart on the Microsoft store site.
5288860	5294780	I had a Series X in my cart at 1106 Eastern completed the process finally shortly after
5294780	5296360	noon my time.
5296360	5299300	That's probably around the time I finally got through or I got through on Amazon.
5299300	5302980	I heard the Microsoft store itself was having some problems.
5302980	5306780	So that all was kind of an unfortunate experience.
5306780	5308120	I don't know what to say about it.
5308120	5314800	As far as my own Xbox, whatever at this point, if I get one launch day, cool.
5314800	5320580	If I have to wait a few more weeks, whatever, you know.
5320580	5324080	Worst case scenario, I walk into a store and I buy one there and then I just cancel the
5324080	5325080	Amazon preorder.
5325080	5327340	At least they don't charge you till they actually ship it.
5327340	5332660	It's kind of one of those things where it's like, sure, I'd like to have it on day one,
5332660	5336340	but maybe the events of this year have just put a lot of things into perspective where
5336340	5341220	it's like, some things are more important and if I don't have an Xbox Series X the very
5341220	5345220	first day, I will be able to go on with my life.
5345220	5349620	I was just looking for also the accessories and stuff because I'm like, okay, cool.
5349620	5351180	Got the preorder.
5351180	5353940	What's going to be a launch day game?
5353940	5354940	I don't know.
5354940	5356740	I don't know what's launching.
5356740	5358180	I don't know what the launch games are.
5358180	5363140	I don't even know where can I get another controller?
5363140	5364140	Where is all this stuff?
5364140	5367180	Because none of it was on their websites.
5367180	5371380	So I guess I'll just have to wait and find that out, but like, I don't even know what.
5371380	5372380	Game pass.
5372380	5376660	Game pass will just be where my day one stuff comes from.
5376660	5382100	And again, the enhanced backwards compatibility stuff that they're promising will make older.
5382100	5389380	I'm really excited to start No Man's Sky again on Xbox Series X because I don't see how it's
5389380	5395580	not going to really run at like a PC equivalent on the Series X.
5395580	5400220	And I don't know what type of things the developers are doing to bump that up, but I would imagine
5400220	5405540	it's going to run very well on the eventual PlayStation 5 release, however they do that,
5405540	5406660	and Xbox Series X.
5406660	5410500	And that is kind of nice, especially after these stories about Spider-Man, you have to
5410500	5411500	pay again.
5411540	5416060	It is nice to know that on Xbox Series X and Game Pass, I'll be able to play No Man's Sky
5416060	5419420	in sweet, sweet 4K that first day.
5419420	5423180	I guess I'll have my cross-play stuff that I completely forgot about because I have it
5423180	5430300	on PC, like Crackdown 3 and Forza Horizon 4, and I'm sure there's other things when
5430300	5436420	I still had Xbox Live Gold that I was adding stuff in, so who knows?
5436420	5437420	It'll be a surprise.
5437420	5441340	Yeah, and I talked about this when I talked about getting an Xbox versus a PlayStation.
5441820	5447420	I feel like PlayStation, okay, they have Spider-Man Miles Morales and they have the Demon's Souls
5447420	5451260	remake, neither of which are games I'm that...
5451260	5455220	I'm like, okay, I'll check them out eventually, but do I need them day one?
5455220	5456220	Nah.
5456220	5461780	So I'm going to instead address the discrepancy at home that I have a PS4 Pro, but an old
5461780	5466180	Xbox One, so I'm going to bring up Microsoft and at some point I'll catch PlayStation up
5466180	5467420	as well next year.
5467420	5472460	I just don't need to spend $1,000 on consoles and a new TV on top of that because I don't
5472460	5474660	have a 4K TV, but I got to fix that too.
5474660	5477460	So something's got to wait for next year, and so it's going to be the PlayStation 5.
5477460	5480300	Yeah, I need to get a 4K monitor.
5480300	5481300	Yeah.
5481300	5482300	All right.
5482300	5484700	Now let's travel back to simpler times.
5484700	5486740	Let's go back to the past.
5486740	5492740	We're going to go back to a simple time when games, you know, you didn't have to have a
5492740	5494480	4K TV to play them on.
5494480	5503320	You played them on your CRT television in glorious 320 pixel resolution, and you liked
5503320	5504320	it.
5504320	5506600	It's the classic game of the week, and usually...
5506600	5507600	240, I mean.
5507600	5508600	Was it 240?
5508600	5509600	I thought it was like 320.
5509600	5510600	It's 240p.
5510600	5513720	I guess it depends on what system it was.
5513720	5517560	Anyhow, Dark Sakura would usually be here and step into the gaming vault and find a
5517560	5522440	game that she thinks, hey, you brats should be checking this game out, but she is off
5522440	5523440	tonight for Yom Kippur.
5523480	5524480	She's not here with the show.
5524480	5525840	She'll be back next week.
5525840	5530400	So I have decided to fill in with a choice here, and I feel like this is one Loki might
5530400	5531400	approve of.
5531400	5532400	I don't know.
5532400	5538840	We'll find out, but I have chosen a game that probably was most famous on the NES, and that's
5538840	5543080	where the B-roll footage comes from tonight, but it was also very popular on Commodore
5543080	5548920	64 and a lot of other 80s and late 80s types of computing systems.
5548960	5554600	The classic game of the week tonight is Skate or Die.
5554600	5555600	That's right.
5555600	5556600	Skate or Die.
5556600	5558320	Did you like this game, Loki?
5558320	5562640	Yeah, I used to play with my friend down the street all the time.
5562640	5564280	He had it on the NES.
5564280	5567120	Why did this guy in Skate or Die look like Rodney Dangerfield?
5567120	5569120	I never understood that.
5569120	5570120	Was it...
5570120	5571120	I mean, and he was called Rodney.
5571120	5572840	That's the creator of the game, I think.
5572840	5573840	No, it's not.
5573840	5574840	No.
5574840	5575840	I think...
5575840	5578640	Rodney Dangerfield didn't make Skate or Die, Loki.
5578640	5580760	No, I understand that.
5580760	5582520	I thought that the guy that made it was...
5582520	5584120	I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.
5584120	5589680	No, but his name is actually Rodney Recluse, so he even has the same name, except he has
5589680	5591960	a tattoo and purple hair and stuff.
5591960	5594200	His son, Bionic Lester, that might have...
5594200	5596920	Bionic Lester might be the developer, I don't know.
5596920	5603840	But the other guy is Rodney Dangerfield, and I never really understood why.
5603840	5605640	Nobody's ever really explained this to me.
5605640	5607280	All right, anyway.
5607320	5610720	Tigerclaw in chat says maybe they were Rodney Dangerfield fans at the time.
5610720	5616200	Still, maybe it was easier to steal people's likenesses in the 80s than it is today.
5616200	5617200	Yes, probably.
5617200	5618200	Just like, I don't know.
5618200	5619200	Who are we gonna make this guy look like?
5619200	5620200	Rodney Dangerfield.
5620200	5621200	I don't know.
5621200	5622200	Anyway.
5622200	5628000	All right, so this game was released by Electronic Arts, and it was released on the ZX Spectrum,
5628000	5635260	Commodore 64, Atari ST, the Apple II, GS, the Amstrad, and IBM's under MS-DOS.
5635260	5639960	It was also on the NES by Konami, but of course, published by Ultra Games, which was
5639960	5643860	how they got around the three games a year limitation in the US.
5643860	5646580	Codemasters ended up handling the Atari version.
5646580	5650660	Now, what's interesting about this game, it's kind of inspired by, even though it wasn't
5650660	5659500	made by Epyx, it was kind of in the style of the Epyx summer games, winter games, California
5659500	5660500	games.
5660500	5662740	You know all those games that Epyx did back in the day, right?
5662740	5664880	This is kind of that, okay?
5664880	5666260	But it's all skating.
5666260	5670980	I mean, obviously, I think Half-Pipe was one of the games in California games.
5670980	5674300	But they kind of made their own version of one of those types of games, and that's what
5674300	5676420	Skate or Die essentially is.
5676420	5678580	It's a minigame collection.
5678580	5680700	Wii Sports was a minigame collection.
5680700	5684740	You know, a lot of times with the sports games, these minigames collections do pretty good.
5684740	5689560	So the original version was the Commodore 64 version.
5689560	5692100	There were three programmers that made that, okay?
5692100	5696700	They were previously with Epyx, so that's why, you know, you can say it was inspired
5696700	5700500	by those types of games, and those were the games that they had worked on.
5700500	5706180	This game was inspired by 720, which I believe Jamie's covered on this show before.
5706180	5712540	If not, we've certainly talked about it, which y'all know that as the popular coin-op skateboarding
5712540	5719420	game that Atari made that ran off the same hardware that like Indiana Jones and Final
5719420	5724340	Lap or whatever their racing game was called, all that ran off the same hardware.
5724340	5729520	There were several events, freestyle ramp event, high jump, there were downhill events,
5729520	5734540	the downhill race and a downhill jam, and then there was a pool joust, or an empty pool
5734540	5737260	you would kind of skate and try to knock another person over.
5737260	5738740	That was kind of interesting.
5738740	5742380	So yeah, the game did pretty well.
5742380	5744460	It was known for its intro music.
5744460	5750780	Again, the original version was the Commodore 64 version, and that was composed by Rob Hubbard,
5750780	5754580	and it had a very Commodore 64 SID chip sound to it.
5754580	5759980	It actually was redone by Kuji Murata for the NES version.
5759980	5766980	So the NES intro is that same Commodore 64 intro just redone for the NES chip sound set,
5766980	5768500	which I think is kind of interesting.
5768500	5775540	So it sold over 100,000 copies, which isn't too shabby for a video game in that era.
5775540	5778220	And there were some follow-ups to this as well.
5778220	5781420	There was Ski or Die, did you ever play Ski or Die?
5781420	5783380	No, but I've heard of it.
5783380	5785980	I think I did play the sequel though.
5785980	5787900	It was very similar.
5787900	5794100	And then there was also Skate or Die 2, but Skate or Die 2 was only on the NES, and that
5794100	5795600	was in 1990.
5795600	5801640	So Skate or Die 2 also kind of wasn't the same like mini game format that the other
5801640	5803180	games were.
5803180	5806680	But Rodney and Lester were back, so there is that.
5806680	5812540	Supposedly Criterion Games, the same folks that made Burnout, supposedly they were remaking
5812540	5818980	Skate or Die during the PlayStation 2 and Xbox One era, but the game was canceled.
5818980	5822920	The good news is though, that's how we got Burnout 3.
5822920	5828440	So the Skate or Die remake was in development for 12 months, and then they canceled it.
5828440	5833880	So I'd be curious to see if there's a tell-all about that or something that leaks some of
5833880	5835960	the footage from that or what have you someday.
5835960	5841680	So there you go, that's your classic game of the week, Skate or Die.
5841680	5848160	And when it comes to myself and Skate or Die, I will probably just have to die because I'm
5848160	5849160	a terrible skater.
5849160	5852680	What about you, Loki, were you ever a skateboarder?
5852720	5856560	No, I tried, but nah, it was more skating.
5856560	5859980	I could only really skate in video games, that's for sure.
5859980	5863960	Some comments from our chat, Dark Tetsuya says Skate or Die 2 did have the halfpipe
5863960	5869640	stuff though, let's see, Dark Tetsuya says I think the joust music might be my favorite
5869640	5870640	theme in this.
5870640	5874680	Bionic Lester was unbeatable though, well in the little video clip that we pull off
5874680	5879200	YouTube, somebody was getting him, so there was that.
5879240	5884360	Sean 322 talking about Rodney Dangerfield kind of being in the game says, maybe the
5884360	5887440	game got no respect.
5887440	5891340	Well it sold 100, I think it got a lot of respect, but I appreciate your pun, so there
5891340	5893540	is that.
5893540	5898480	So yeah, some comments there from our chat on Skate or Die, the classic game of the week.
5898480	5903360	Alright, let's get into some fast news, some rapid fire news, which I think has a story
5903360	5904360	in here.
5904360	5909200	Because I brought up Ultra Games, some of you guys are asking about a certain news topic,
5909200	5911380	and I think we're going to get into it here shortly.
5911380	5913960	So Loki, rapid fire news tonight.
5913960	5920920	Yeah, so there was a game that I grew up with on the Windows, I think it was 3-1 maybe,
5920920	5926800	but it was an old game called Chips Challenge, and it was a puzzle game that they had in,
5926800	5931880	I can't remember, it was like the Windows party pack or some sort of pack that had little
5931880	5933680	games in there.
5934120	5939360	Chips Challenge has actually now been released for free on Steam, so you can go check it
5939360	5946560	out for free now and play the wonderful, it looks like it's slightly updated, but the
5946560	5948760	game from the 90s.
5948760	5952680	And yeah, it's pretty awesome, so go check it out.
5952680	5957780	I always crack up at stories about Chips Challenge because I know the guy who made it.
5957780	5963560	We play games together, I've been to his house, Chuck, I gotta get him on OLR at some point.
5964200	5965920	He's under Chuck's Challenge.
5965920	5969920	I know, yeah, he's talked to me about some of the things, because he knows I do this
5969920	5972560	show and everything, he's talked to me about some of the stuff his game has been through,
5972560	5976960	and he doesn't really do, as my understanding anyway, and I'll invite him on the show at
5976960	5981000	some point so he can speak for himself, obviously COVID is the thing right now, we could get
5981000	5986440	him virtually, but I'd rather have him here in studio at some point, but he might still
5986440	5990000	be doing some, I mean like you said, Chuck's Challenge and stuff, he does a lot of stuff
5990080	5996960	that's really cool with lights, and so he's created stuff for Ingress where, you know
5996960	6000440	that tunnel in San Jose that changes from green to blue depending on what team owns
6000440	6001560	it in Ingress?
6001560	6007680	He had something to do with that, and he made a cool little light-up portal that travels
6007680	6010280	to different events and stuff, so it's pretty cool.
6010280	6016920	He's a very talented guy, and one of the legendary game makers from back in the day that many
6016960	6022120	of today's games were built on, so it's just like, it's my one little like, oh that guy,
6022120	6029120	I know that guy, so cool, well congrats to him and all the attention this game is getting,
6030640	6034600	like you said, many people in the Windows 3.1 era grew up on this game and know this
6034600	6036480	game very well.
6036480	6042560	Yeah, so pretty cool, and then to go along with that, there's some more games coming
6042600	6049360	to PC, some classic Metal Gear games are coming to good ol' games, and this is part of the
6049360	6055120	Konami Collector series, so they're gonna have actually three Metal Gear games, so Metal
6055120	6062120	Gear, Metal Gear Solid, and Metal Gear Solid 2 are all gonna be available on PC, so not
6062840	6069840	bad, and of course, you know, I'd have to check out to see what they've done with those
6070280	6074840	and see how those ports are, but yeah, pretty cool.
6074840	6080480	I might have to check it out, like the fact that it's the MSX version of the game, which
6080480	6086320	they already had done for like a PlayStation, yeah, for a previous collection on PlayStation,
6086320	6091360	but the fact that that's coming out on PC, that's awesome. Now the Contra port, that
6091360	6094720	was all on Game Pass, the Contra stuff, and that was all on Game Pass back in the day,
6094720	6098800	and they're okay, but like the Metal Gear thing is the most exciting out of that bunch
6098800	6099800	for sure.
6099800	6100800	Yeah.
6100800	6106560	Yeah. All right. Moving on and talking about some other quick news here, news out of Tokyo
6106560	6112360	Game Show with Nier Replicant, which is like a redoing of the first game, which was just
6112360	6118680	called Nier here in the US, but this is kind of like that extra version that changes the
6118680	6124240	character to ones that we kind of know more from Nier Automata, but anyway, Nier Replicant
6124240	6130800	is going to be launching all over the world on April 23rd, 2021. I'm sorry, North America
6130800	6138360	and Europe is the launch days for that, April 23rd, 2021. PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC
6138360	6145280	via Steam. The full title of the game is Nier Replicant version 1.22474487139. I don't know
6145280	6150120	what the full title means, but there you go. It is of course the alternate edition of the
6150120	6154120	original 2010 Nier. So that's pretty cool. I'll have to check that out because I love
6155000	6159040	Nier Automata. I need to finish it still. I know there's going to be, I'm going to get
6159040	6162760	an email. Did you ever finish Nier Automata? Isn't it great? And I'm like, oh, I got distracted
6162760	6168080	by other games. Sorry. Happens all the time. All right. And then we have news about Mortal
6168080	6173600	Combat 11. Apparently some data mining has showed that there is alternate voice acting
6173600	6179400	in the game and get this, it's from the nineties movies actors. Now we all know that Shang
6179400	6184600	Soon, they already did that, right? But apparently this new dialogue that was data mined out
6184600	6189120	of the game is Christopher Lambert is in it. That's awesome. Who played Raiden in the movie?
6189120	6195200	Remember that? Was it actually just like clips from the movie or was it new recordings? And
6195200	6200840	Linda Ashby, who played Johnny Cage and Bridgette Wilson, who's now Bridgette Wilson Sampras,
6200840	6206960	who played Sonia is also there. So I don't know if that's going to be DLC or what, but
6206960	6213800	we can say the YouTube that had all the clips got taken down. So by Warner Brothers. So
6213800	6219940	where there's smoke, there's Scorpion. So we'll see what comes to that. Honestly, if
6219940	6225440	I get to replace Ronda Rousey in Mortal Combat 11, I think that's a great thing. So that's
6225440	6229960	cool that they got Bridgette Wilson to do that. So, and you know what? Yeah. As cheese
6229960	6236180	balls, that nineties movie is like, I think it just means a lot to a certain generation,
6236300	6239700	like a lot of us grew up with that. And so it's really cool to have those actors and actresses
6239700	6244340	back. Maybe it'd be like the 25th anniversary or something. I was just trying to see when the
6244340	6248580	movie came out, but this is back in August. So I thought maybe they would do something,
6248580	6252100	you know, Halloween's right around the corner. Maybe they're going to do something with that.
6252100	6257500	Maybe they'll find some way to charge us more for it. All right, let's travel around the world and
6257500	6262900	check out some game releases coming out soon with some world release dates. Loki, what's coming out
6262900	6270020	in the US this week? So this week we've got Genshin Impact on PC, PlayStation 4, iOS, and Android.
6270020	6278500	Hanser Dragoon remake on PlayStation 4. Return one-way trip on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,
6278500	6287580	and Xbox One. Spelunky 2 is coming on PC this week. Umahara Kawase Bazuka on Nintendo Switch
6287740	6294940	and PlayStation 4. Warsaw on PlayStation 4. And I think maybe Shantae is also coming out this
6294940	6301100	week as well on Nintendo Switch. Super Mario Brothers 35 is coming out this week on the Switch.
6302460	6308220	We've also got Warsaw on the Switch as well. Crash Bandicoot 4, it's about time,
6308220	6315420	on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. And Star Wars Squadrons on the PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6315420	6320060	I didn't realize that was that soon. Yeah, I didn't realize it was November. Yeah, I didn't
6320060	6325020	realize it was that soon either. All right, let's travel to Japan and check out some releases out
6325020	6332700	there this week. So this week we have a few things. We have, um, sorry I got thrown off
6332700	6338620	because there's some releases showing on September 30th, but it's all hardware. So I think the game
6338620	6343660	releases, it doesn't look like we actually have any on Nintendo Switch this week. Okay, we do have
6343660	6348860	some on PlayStation 4. We have Star Wars Squadron is also out in Japan this week and Crash Bandicoot
6348860	6356300	4 is out in Japan also on October 2nd. And Ys Origin also has a release this week on the
6356300	6362380	PlayStation 4 this week. So a fairly quiet week in Japan, although all of those titles are pretty big
6362380	6367900	deals. So I guess it's not that quiet. Dark Sakura is not here to cover the UK tonight,
6367900	6375260	but possibly Loki can get us those dates in her absence. Yep, so we also have Untitled Goose Game
6375260	6381100	coming out on PlayStation 4 and Switch. I believe that's the physical version of that. Let's Sing
6381100	6389660	Queen coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Switch. Human Fall Flat on PlayStation 4, Xbox One
6389660	6396780	and Switch. That's the anniversary edition. Crash Bandicoot 4 It's About Time on PlayStation 4 and
6396780	6404620	Xbox One. Star Wars Squadrons on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Warborn on PlayStation 4
6404620	6414380	and on the Switch. And then we've got also Distrust Collector's Edition on Nintendo Switch.
6415180	6423180	And that's it. All right, let's get into some more news then before we get to the listener
6423180	6431100	roundtable tonight. So Loki. Yes, so Sega is looking to make Yakuza into a movie.
6431740	6437100	So that sounds pretty awesome. Apparently they're working to develop an adaptation with
6438620	6445340	1212 Entertainment and Wild Sheep content. And apparently they're also looking for script writers
6445340	6452780	as well. So very early into the whole process. But I think that would make a very interesting
6452780	6459260	movie. My dumb ass was about to say, has Sega ever gotten into films before and then forgetting,
6459260	6466540	oh, yeah, like the last major release before all this happened was the Sonic film? No, they haven't
6466540	6473500	done anything. Did they ever confirm a sequel for Sonic? They had to have, right? No. Yes, they are,
6473500	6480460	yeah. Got it. I haven't even dated it, but I don't remember exactly when it was. But I'm pretty sure
6481420	6487500	it was probably like 2022 or something. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, dammit, the Sonic film
6487500	6493420	reappears on VOG. Look, actually it's this weird dystopian thing right now because there are movie
6493420	6500060	theaters out there, especially here in California that have been closed since March. So you go and
6500060	6505420	you look like what posters are hanging up and it's still like Sonic. Sonic. Because that was the
6505420	6511340	movie that was out when all this bullshit started happening. So there are other movies too, but
6511340	6518700	it's weird. It's scheduled for April 8th, 2022 right now. But assuming they can, well, I mean,
6518700	6522860	I guess movies are shooting again with COVID and all that stuff. They have guidelines. Was it
6522860	6530460	Avatar 2 converted to 100% wrapped now? So that's coming out at some point. In these crazy times,
6530460	6533020	they were able to finish that? Apparently.
6533020	6534460	Wow. Let's see.
6534460	6539820	Not many years it's going to take to CG animate everything. That's the whole problem.
6540380	6544220	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, our theaters reopened here. They're only showing like three
6544220	6550940	films. And they're starting to slowly open again here in California, depending on your county.
6550940	6555340	Because you mentioned Loki last week. You went and saw Tenet. You had to drive up to El Dorado,
6555340	6559100	which is in a different county because they have this interesting system that's like a
6559100	6563420	four-tier system. So it's like, if you still have high COVID numbers, you're in the purple
6563420	6568460	tier and a lot of stuff is still really stupid because it's like, oh yeah, those are like
6568460	6574380	borders. No one can possibly go from one county to the other. It's dumb.
6574380	6579820	As long as folks are still taking precautions, it's when people just say, oh, COVID's not real
6579820	6584860	and don't bother with any precautions at all. That's when like Florida's about to do. Sorry.
6584860	6589500	I don't mean to like get political, but it's science isn't political. That's all I'm going
6589500	6596140	to say. And so, you know, it's kind of scary in that area. What's that where they're just like,
6596140	6601420	ah, it's not just everything. Drive-ins. Drive-in theaters are like ever more
6601420	6609340	popular. Yeah. Was there Rocky Horror? I was just, so I might be saying too much,
6609340	6613260	but they were trying to see if we could pull off a live Rocky Horror,
6613260	6619580	but they didn't, we didn't have enough notice to do it. And the social distancing makes it very
6619580	6624860	hard to do Rocky live. So for this, cause they're doing it at the drive-in like next week or no,
6624860	6628700	I think it was yesterday. Cause that's how they wanted to turn it around real fast.
6628700	6633020	Um, but they are looking into it for October. I hope I'm not saying too much. Um, but they're
6633020	6637100	looking into see if they could do the performance in October. I don't know how they would compensate
6637100	6640940	for social distancing and all that though. I think they were talking about a system where
6641740	6647580	instead of the characters all interacting, like each character would be in a little place on the
6647580	6651900	stage and they would kind of do their emotions and acting in that place on the stage. It would
6651900	6657740	be a little weird, but that's how they could do it safely or I just per guidelines. So,
6659740	6667900	um, yep. All right. Anyhow, uh, let's move on and talk about Kirby fighters too.
6668540	6673420	Kirby fighters too. Surprise. It just came out and I don't know if Nintendo was kind of forced
6673420	6677740	to do it because they kind of spilled it themselves. Uh, it leaked on one of their well
6677740	6682860	leaked, but it showed up on one of their websites as like a game basically. And so Nintendo confirmed
6682860	6688060	it. So they confirmed in a tweet, a brand new Kirby game is available now. Kirby fighters two
6688060	6695100	is $20. It's a Kirby versus Kirby versus Kirby game. It's, it's kind of like smash brothers,
6695660	6700860	light sorta. I'm really oversimplifying it, but what would you expect a game like Kirby
6700860	6704860	fighters to be when Kirby is a character in smash brothers? Um, but that is something you can check
6704860	6709740	out and there's all sorts of, uh, different Kirby hat fighters and DDD and all that good stuff.
6709740	6714220	I have not played the game myself yet. I'd have to ask at depth how it is. Um, but, uh,
6714220	6719820	if you're wondering where was Kirby fighters one, it was part of Kirby triple deluxe, which was,
6720140	6726540	uh, a 3ds game they put out in 2014. Um, and then I believe they put a standalone version of that
6726540	6733820	out on switch. Not that long ago. Um, maybe about a year ago, uh, times feels kind of frozen right
6733820	6737500	now, uh, ever since March, but I think it was probably a little over a year ago that
6737500	6744060	Kirby fighter game was out on the switch. So, um, and active says, no, I haven't gotten it yet.
6744700	6754220	Shock. Wow. All right. Anyway, uh, let's move on. All right. Loki. Uh, so
6755420	6763900	Nintendo has, uh, sent a DMCA notice against peaches untold tales. Now you may have not
6763900	6770940	heard of this game. It is a triple X parody game featuring princess peach and doing I'm, I'm sure
6770940	6777340	completely wholesome things. Uh, but so they have basically taken it down off of GitHub.
6777340	6781580	Of course, it's the internet and being that it's been on the internet for several years already
6781580	6786460	before they, I don't even know why they just took it down now, but I'm sure you can find it out
6786460	6791580	there. And it's just, it's all the things you would think it would possibly be. It's something
6791580	6799980	only the internet could have done. Yes. Yes it is. It's really stupid. It is weird though that
6799980	6804460	it existed for so long. And then just now Nintendo is getting around to taking it down.
6804460	6808860	Although couldn't you argue that some of it is parody, but I guess the whole thing is parody,
6808860	6813020	but they're saying that it's a little too close to home. Maybe they're saying that it's too similar.
6813020	6819340	It copyrights that fringes on copyrights from a super Mario maker to Mario parts of Mario Galaxy
6819340	6827020	and smash brothers. I, I guess like probably because it's saying it's like Mario and princess
6827020	6831900	peach and stuff like that. Maybe they're saying that it's that's, what's the problem. If they
6831900	6837900	were just like, it's mushroom princess and, you know, they just changed the name, Italian plumber.
6838700	6842700	Yeah. Kind of like how they do like green Mario green, green Mario.
6845820	6851820	So, uh, yeah. All right. It's been taken down. So obviously you can't find it on the internet.
6851820	6856300	Yeah. You know what though? It's fine. Unlike a lot of the types of stories we talk about with
6856300	6861900	that. I, I have zero interest in this garbage, whatever. I'm just surprised that, yeah, it
6861900	6866780	didn't, it didn't get away. Cause like, you know, you have pornos that come out that are like
6866780	6871180	parodies of, uh, like the Lord of the cock ring or whatever, you know, that you get like, I don't
6871180	6876460	even know if that's a real thing. I assume it is. Uh, you get these parodies of, of TVs and movies
6876460	6881020	all the time and porn. So it seems logical that it would happen in video games as well, but yeah,
6881020	6886460	probably usually when they do the parodies of porn, they change all the names. Right.
6887340	6890940	Um, even when it's real people, uh, like I remember, um,
6892780	6898700	there was, um, what was it? Nail and Palin. You remember when, when Sarah Palin was everywhere,
6898700	6903580	she was the VP nominee. And of course, you know, they, but they like would change the name.
6904460	6910780	So it was like, you know, Susie or something. One of the stars actually looked very similar
6910780	6916700	to her. So they made a ton of movies. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, my, then they usually change,
6916700	6922380	but this parody, yeah. Like you said, they should have changed, uh, Mario and peach to different,
6922380	6927660	you know, things, which considering there's a peach emoji that represents. All right. You know
6927660	6932780	what? Nevermind. We're not going to continue this conversation. All right. Moving on. Let's,
6932780	6938780	let's instead talk about something that I'm actually, I'm fucking sick of talking about
6938780	6945260	this and I didn't really want to bring this up again tonight. I'm going to like one more time,
6946620	6950140	but I'm not talking about this again. Of course, somebody is going to quote me on this. It's the
6950140	6953900	same. That's going to come back to haunt me. I'm not talking about this again until we fucking get
6953900	6961340	a confirmation on this. And it's the mass effect trilogy again, because another retailer has leaked
6961340	6967740	it again. And this is a Czechoslovakian retailer. Herne Savitt. I'm probably saying that completely
6967740	6976700	wrong. Sorry. Um, I bet it's more like that. Anyway. Uh, it is a, uh, October 15th release
6976700	6981660	on their systems, which that is way too soon. I don't, unless it's a digital only thing,
6981660	6985500	but then why would a retailer be taking orders for it? So it doesn't, it doesn't make any sense.
6986220	6992620	Um, but they have cover art. Now GameStop makes up their own cover art sometimes, but it does,
6992620	6997500	I mean, this is what the cover art I would expect could look like. It's just a picture of
6998620	7002700	male shepherd. Uh, unfortunately for those that believe fem chef, maybe on the backside is fem
7002700	7006300	chef. That would be the way to do it. Have a one shepherd on one side and one on the other. It's
7006300	7010860	like when you or, uh, you could take the cover and flip it. That would be a great way to do it too.
7010860	7016060	I think mass effect three really was like that. Um, but anyway, it does have cover art and, uh,
7016060	7021580	it's happening now. There's this story and there was another one and I forget what blog ran it.
7021580	7026220	I'm sorry, but it spilled a lot more details and it was basically like,
7026220	7030780	yes, it's happening. And the reason why it's held up, they took the multiplayer out for mass
7030780	7033980	effect three. They're not looking at which. So I was a little disappointed to hear that,
7033980	7039340	but I get it, but they are trying to quote unquote fix mass effect one and the mass effect
7039340	7044700	one development is the holdup. And they're not saying what they are fixing in that, but I could
7044700	7049260	theorize as somebody who really enjoys that game, the graphics are a bit dated compared to the other
7049260	7053660	two games. They probably have to catch that up. And those Mako driving sequences were horrific.
7053660	7058300	So they're probably either changing that system completely or making that a little more bearable.
7058300	7061820	Um, so those are some things they kind of need to fix in mass effect one
7061820	7065180	to because, you know, people are going to want to play these games in order. If they pick up
7065180	7069980	this collection and they're not going to get to two and three, if one, some will argue with me,
7069980	7074140	I tweeted about this and I even got responses that were like, well, Rob wants the best game.
7074140	7078780	And it's like, okay, look, but the game elements, I don't think are with, I don't think they're
7078780	7084220	going to change combat. They might though, I guess we'll see, but I really don't think
7084220	7087900	the types of changes they're making are going to ruin, you know, whatever you feel
7087900	7094700	like about mass effect one. So anyway, there you go. That was the other big piece is that,
7094700	7099100	you know, that we get news from the inside or whatever. However, the news is leaking because
7099100	7106220	it just constantly leaks because EA won't confirm it for whatever fucking reason. But anyway,
7106620	7113180	the news that multiplayer is out and a mass effect one redo of sorts is in, which is what
7113180	7119900	a lot of people were probably theorizing anyway. At this point, I would guess that it's going to
7119900	7125580	end up being a November 7th thing, but I, for one, am not going to talk about this shit anymore
7126140	7132300	until they confirm it. I'm done. If Jamie brings it up, that's on her. She's not here. So maybe
7132300	7139020	she's still got one more inner, but I'm not bringing this up anymore. All right. Anyway,
7140060	7142620	that's it. You want to talk about the mass effect trilogy?
7144140	7148460	I have played like a little bit of one and that's it. So.
7149340	7152380	Well, what, what was it you didn't, why didn't you play more of one?
7153100	7158860	I don't know. I just didn't like it because my, my coworker loaned it to me and I was like,
7158860	7163100	oh yeah, I'll totally check it out. Cause it sounded really cool. I just, I didn't like it.
7163100	7167420	I don't know. I didn't quite get into it. Well, and maybe some of these changes will be a good
7167420	7170220	thing for you. And I'm going to open up the listener round table. If you guys have some
7170220	7173420	questions in chat or something you want to talk about, go ahead and ask away in chat.
7174700	7182060	Phoenix 7726. Sorry guys. Phoenix 7726 in chat says two had the best story. Three had the best
7182060	7187580	combat. One was still solid. In my opinion, I'm not saying one is a bad game by any means. It's
7187580	7193260	just one is not at the same level, like graphically and engine wise that two and three were at.
7193260	7197980	And so I do think there is a disconnect, but I, I, if there's one thing they're not going to change
7197980	7204380	in one, it's the story. They're not going to change the story. Well, let me, I'm gonna take
7204380	7211820	those words back because I really loved the idea that maybe they would put back in some of the
7211820	7217020	romance options they cut the first time. Like maybe they would allow Kayden to be romanceable
7217020	7222780	by M Shep in the first game. And maybe, and why, why stop there? Why not maybe have some other
7222780	7227740	romances that show up later on end up in the first game? I don't know what else they might have cut
7227740	7233420	or things like that, but it would be kind of cool to see that stuff restored. But I am talking about
7233420	7238140	additional content. I'm not talking about taking anything away or something that would fundamentally
7238140	7243660	change the core of that story. So, but you know, whatever changes they make, they're not going to
7243660	7249740	change the story of one. And I think that's very important. All right. We will get into last minute
7249740	7253900	stories in a moment, but I have at least one round table question here coming from no one special.
7254700	7260380	Who says, okay, granted, as far as I know, I'm the only one here that is a heavy GOG user,
7260380	7265740	but hypothetically, if you all were as well, and given that Konami is now listing games on GOG
7265740	7270060	and Sega's Panzer Dragoon is there too, is there any publishers or games that you would
7270060	7279500	like to see on the service? Yes. And actually I, one reason I'm not a heavier user of GOG is that
7279500	7284940	it feels like lately they're just kind of playing a lot of catch up to what, you know, Steam and
7284940	7293260	everybody else in the space is doing. What made GOG interesting was GOG. And they got away from
7293260	7297900	that at some point, which I, and I get it, you know, and I'm sure somebody is about to clap
7297900	7302380	back and chat that, well, once they kind of exhausted all of the retro things, they could
7302380	7307020	get their hands on. And so the only way they could stay competitive was to be more like Steam. Well,
7307020	7312220	my response to that is okay, but this is the first time that GOG has done something that's really
7312220	7317500	made me turn my head in quite some time is that story we just talked about earlier tonight,
7317500	7323820	that now Konami is putting out the MSX version of Metal Gear, the superior version of Metal Gear
7323820	7329420	that most people here in the US never played because the NES version, although it's not bad,
7330220	7335980	especially when it's all you ever knew, it is subpar compared to the MSX version. So the fact
7335980	7342060	that GOG has dug that up, I mean, yes, it was from the Metal Gear Solid 3 PlayStation thing, whatever
7342060	7345580	they did out there, but the fact that they've brought that to PC and brought that to the
7345580	7350860	forefront, here's a way to get it now today without having to find a game that was on sale
7350860	7356220	10 years ago and all that stuff, that is very interesting and something I will probably return
7356220	7362300	to GOG to look at. So that's my answer, my very long-winded answer to your question, Owen Special,
7362300	7371260	is that what makes GOG interesting is GOG. It's in the name and there are plenty of older games
7371260	7376940	they could still go back and try to get on their service. And it's nice to see that with this
7376940	7381500	Konami thing, they haven't necessarily stopped that. Now, I don't know who initiated that
7381500	7387740	conversation. Was it Konami? Was it GOG? I don't know, but this is a good direction. More, please.
7388940	7391660	So that's my answer to that. What about you, Loki?
7392380	7395820	I didn't use them much other than some of the free games that I've gotten from them.
7396700	7400940	I know that they have that cool launcher that came out a while back that's supposed to bring your
7400940	7408620	Epic Game Store and Steam library all together. But I don't know, it's just fine just loading each
7408620	7415020	of those up separately. So I don't really need it. But yeah, I don't know. There's not really
7415020	7422140	anything drawing to them more than the other platforms. Maybe they have humble
7422140	7425420	bottles or something with their keys in there or something. I don't know.
7426380	7431820	No One Special follows up and says, for me, what draws me to that site is that the games are DRM
7431820	7436780	free. I have the peace of mind that if GOG goes away, if I downloaded the installers, I won't lose
7436780	7441500	my game. There's no guarantee that Valve would hit the turn off the DRM button if they go out of
7441500	7448060	business. I think it's in the terms that you accept, actually. I think legally Valve has to hit that
7448060	7453020	button. But let's say, I'm going to humor your argument here, let's say that button doesn't get
7453020	7458940	hit for whatever reason. Publishers could still find a way to turn it off for you.
7458940	7463260	Not that everybody would do it, but a bunch would. But I get it. I'm not trying to like
7464220	7468700	debate your point, really, because you like what you like. And that's,
7469260	7474140	go, go, go ahead. Like it's good. The competition in the space is a good thing. And if that's where
7474140	7479580	you like to shop, excellent. Like I like to shop at Target. I really don't like going to Walmart.
7479580	7485340	There's people that feel the exact opposite that I do. Choice is cool. And it's fine. There's not
7485340	7489740	necessarily a right or a wrong answer. It kind of just depends on how you were treated or whatever
7489740	7495420	at one place versus another. But yeah, GOG will continue to grab my attention when they release
7495420	7502540	really cool older games. Like that Myst VR thing. Did that ever come up on the show? I don't remember
7502540	7505820	if we talked about that last week or the week before. Yeah, I think we brought it up last week
7505820	7511340	that it was coming out. It's kind of a neat little thing. Now, what about Uru Myst Online?
7511340	7518700	Did that ever come back somewhere? Did they ever get that running again? I don't know. But was it
7518700	7525180	Minecraft VR came out this week as well. Oh yeah. I need to hook up my headset and get that going
7525180	7532220	again. Yeah, so that was cool. Yeah. ActDeft in chat with another Roundtable question here
7532220	7539260	who asks, with more games adopting cross-play, which game that right now doesn't have it,
7539260	7546140	would you like to see adopted? Oh, I don't think there's a lot of games I play a ton of.
7549180	7556860	I'm stuck because the games I play the most right now, this week, Final Fantasy and No Man's Sky,
7556860	7563100	both already have it. I'm trying to think of something that would be really cool.
7565980	7568940	I don't know, Loki. I'm stumped. Is there something for you? What about you guys?
7569740	7572220	I don't play a lot of multiplayer games, so I can't really think of anything.
7573260	7579580	Bobby has a good answer. Fall Guys. I forget that that doesn't have it. That's a very good answer.
7579580	7585660	I'm going to copy and steal that answer. Fall Guys is a good one for that. I keep forgetting
7585660	7591260	it doesn't have that. I'm also waiting for Fall Guys on the Switch. It seems like the definitive
7591260	7597020	thing Nintendo needs to have on that system. Well, that was part of that leak, or leaked,
7597020	7604620	if you will, directing this. A bunch of fan wank, but yeah, I don't know. My uncle said,
7605580	7612540	Overwatch is a good one too. Oh, Diablo III on the Blizzard front. I'd love to see Diablo III.
7612540	7619740	I hope Diablo IV is cross-play. Diablo III is sunsetting at this point as Diablo IV is getting
7619740	7628060	more and more. You had me there, no one special 77 with the SNL fighters until it was a typo.
7628060	7634940	That would be an interesting fighting game. The fighting games. I thought some of the fighting
7634940	7640380	games were cross-play. I guess not Street Fighter though. I thought Mortal Kombat did have some
7640380	7644220	cross-play in it. I guess I could be wrong. Orange Riot with a very good comment here.
7644220	7649660	If a leak gives you everything you wanted, it's probably fake. That's very, very good advice.
7649660	7653660	And that was probably the thing I read in there where it was like, Fall Guys today on the Switch,
7653660	7659740	where I was like, nah, it's fake. Come on. Okay, active says Street Fighter is cross-play between
7659740	7668220	PC and PS4. And it's, I think, still free for a few more days on PlayStation Plus. I did check
7668220	7671100	that out. I downloaded it. I don't think I brought it up during my gaming week because
7671100	7675100	I didn't play it a lot. And this is more last week than this week, but that is something that
7675100	7679500	you can get on PlayStation Plus right now. All right, how about some last minute stories,
7679500	7683500	Loki? Let's see if we get any other last questions in chat. But for now, some last minute stories.
7684860	7687900	So we're going to probably have a little bit more about this next week, but Minecraft Live
7687900	7696460	is on Saturday and they're doing their vote for the new mob for the game. So I'm a little
7696540	7702380	disappointed at what they've shown off so far. So two of the mobs that they're putting up for
7702380	7708060	vote are already mobs there in Minecraft Earth, which, and they're kind of lame anyways. So the
7708060	7713020	Moobloom, which is basically a cross between, it's like a mushroom, but with flowers instead
7713020	7719340	of mushrooms. And then they have a Glow Squid, which is a squid, but it glows. And then the
7720060	7726620	Ice Oliger, which is a new villager type mob, but they just added a bunch of those in like
7726620	7733660	that village and pillage one. It's not as cool as like the Phantoms. I don't know if the Phantom
7733660	7738460	was really cool, but like I was hoping they'd be better stuff. They should just add all of them.
7738460	7745900	Like seriously, I had a mod in my realm already that added the Moobloom and the Glow Squid. I
7745900	7749980	don't know. It's not that hard to implement that stuff. I don't know why they don't just do all
7749980	7757740	three, but whatever. Maybe something to add content for some time. People excited about
7757740	7763020	stuff. So it's, but they're going to do, it's basically in place of the whole Minecon thing
7763020	7768940	since obviously COVID. But so you're going to do the Minecraft live, which I believe is on,
7768940	7776060	I know it's Saturday at 9 AM Pacific and whatever that translates to for everybody else.
7777340	7781020	So I will watch all that and it's going to have like details about Minecraft Earth,
7781020	7785340	their Minecraft Dungeons, which I still haven't played even though I have it.
7786140	7789260	And then of course Minecraft proper. So we'll see.
7790140	7792380	All right. Anything else for last minute stories?
7795100	7796620	No, I think that's it.
7796620	7800300	All right. And I don't think I see any other questions in our chat. So I think we'll go
7800300	7804460	ahead and wrap up for tonight. I know it's a little bit earlier, but we're down a host
7804460	7809500	tonight and yeah. So it's just a little bit of a shorter show sometimes. Actually, no,
7809500	7813260	you're still over two hours, about two hours, 15 minutes. So still pretty good, pretty good
7813260	7817500	chunk of show. Because there was some busy, busy things this week with the whole Microsoft
7817500	7822620	big purchase there of ZeniMax as well as the Tokyo Game Show. Although I don't think Tokyo Game Show
7822620	7829340	was quite as news heavy as it was in previous years. And I think a lot of that is because
7829340	7833500	Sony just did that thing two weeks ago where they kind of put all their cards on the table.
7833500	7838380	I don't think Sony did Tokyo Game Show this year. Nintendo never does Tokyo Game Show,
7838380	7843980	but I feel like a lot of the big announcements were in Sony's PS5 event because that's not
7843980	7847980	usually the type of thing that would have been this close to Tokyo Game Show. That is the stuff
7847980	7852540	we should have got during E3 using my Cody fingers. But of course, COVID fucked everything
7852540	7857420	up. So it screwed up timeline. So I think it just made the Tokyo Game Show feel a little lighter
7857420	7861900	this year than it usually is. And just the whole situation of it being virtual and everything.
7863820	7868140	Yeah. So it was basically, I'm just kind of looking at a lot of it is stuff that was covered
7868140	7871900	in the directs that we've seen from Nintendo and like some of the other things. So they had,
7873340	7877260	it was pretty much just like a few of the Japanese games that were mentioned in the
7877260	7883100	directs. So like the new Hyrule Warriors game, they've got the new Monster Hunter,
7884140	7887740	new Replicant. They talked about that a little bit. Dynasty Warriors, Nine Empires,
7888540	7893180	Battle in Wonderland, Cyberpunk. They have that new video that wasn't quite related to
7893180	7897180	Tokyo Game Show, but that was also there. Resident Evil Village,
7900460	7906780	just The Devil May Cry 5, Biohazard, Infinite Darkness, which is a new series coming to Netflix.
7908140	7912780	Yeah. That's cool. Yeah. It's just a lot of follow-ups on things we already knew about,
7912780	7915900	which is still cool. And especially, you know, if you're following those games, but it was just
7915900	7921420	wasn't like a lot of like new, new information. So, but that's okay. You know, again, it's been
7921420	7927660	a weird news cycle this year. Everything's been weird this year. So, all right. Well, that is
7927660	7930940	about going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. I want to thank you guys for
7930940	7935180	spending time with us this week, whether you're here with us live on Sunday night, as we tape
7935180	7940620	here at VOG Network, or if you were listening on the podcast feed, we really appreciate it.
7940620	7944860	A nice five-star review of this show on iTunes or wherever it is that you found this show goes
7944860	7948780	an awful long way. If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or
7948780	7952380	two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has
7952380	7956540	a voice. But if the voices aren't here to put out on the air, then, you know, we're not really
7956540	7962540	getting all the voices. So, yeah. Help us tell a friend. Tweet about the show is a great thing.
7962620	7967820	Auto-hosting on Twitch is awesome. Even if you don't do a lot of streaming yourself,
7967820	7973660	still throwing a VOG Network. That auto-host does a lot for exposure. We really, really appreciate
7973660	7978060	people that go the extra mile and do that. I also wanted to say, if you want to continue
7978060	7981820	the conversation during the week, a lot of the chatter in Discord has been picking up lately,
7981820	7986140	and that's great. So, you can join us on Discord, vognetwork.com. That's vognetwork.com
7986780	7992780	Discord, where you can follow some conversations for ourselves here at Orange Lounge Radio,
7993500	7999900	Bobby Blackwolf, Anime Jam Session, other great shows on VOG as well. British Invaders,
7999900	8003420	I know, put out a couple big episodes recently about some big 50th anniversaries that are
8003420	8009180	happening. And yeah, lots of great stuff. So, check that out. And then, of course,
8009180	8013100	the VOG Roundtables and all that info is there as well. And folks, chat about some of the…
8013100	8017420	We get a lot of headlines posted in Discord during the week that sometimes we do take
8017420	8021340	those and use them on the show and talk about those conversations. So, thanks to all you that
8021340	8027100	are participating over there. That's going to do it. I hope you guys have a great week, some happy
8027100	8031260	gaming. I know I'm probably going to play way too much more No Man's Sky and Hades and all
8031260	8036460	that stuff, but I'll try to fit in some new games too. Loki, hopefully you have a productive week
8036460	8039980	working on your game or playing some U.S., whatever you choose to do.
8039980	8046780	I'm still waiting. My music guy is having time management issues.
8048060	8049420	All right, that's fine.
8049420	8058300	So, thankfully, I have a backup music guy that's doing it for free. So, I'll have more music from
8058300	8064940	them. But like, yeah, I've already given him crap about that because he's like seven days past due.
8065580	8071980	Oh, all right. All right. Well, thanks again, everybody. We'll see you in seven days to do
8071980	8077020	this show all over again. Have a great week, everybody. We'll see you next time on Orange
8077020	8081660	Lounge Radio. Dark Sakura will be back next week and we'll get caught up with her and it will be
8081660	8086380	October. It'll be spooky season officially. Have a great week, everybody. We'll see you next time.
