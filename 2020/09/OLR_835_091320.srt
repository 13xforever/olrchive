1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,800
The masters of getting you to buy the same game multiple times do it again, bringing

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,600
the NES Mario Bros. games to the Nintendo Switch with improved graphics, by which they

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,880
mean the improved graphics as they had in their first re-release in 1993.

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,240
On the 35th anniversary of Mario Bros. we get back an old compilation of games, a new

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,760
compilation of less old games, and a brand new Mario Battle Royale, all of which made

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,400
for an incredible Mario-centric Nintendo Direct.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,680
These are my plans for the 18th, stay tuned to hear of your host's plans, Rob Roberts,

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,120
Jamie Summers, and Loki, recently done and coming soon, starting right now on the show

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,120
where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:48,120
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,240
every gamer has a voice, once again it is Orange Lounge Radio, back tonight with episode

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,720
number 835 for this September the 13th of 2020.

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,960
We are back tonight after being gone last week, thanks to Labor Day Holiday here in

14
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,560
the US and Virtual Dragon Con, which I was fortunate enough to participate with, and

15
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,240
I just want to start off by giving a big thank you to everybody over at Dragon Con and the

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,560
Digital Media Track for having me on some panels again, wonderful panels, great set

17
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,000
of panelists, I met a lot of great people and got to work with folks, and if anybody

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,120
from that group is here listening tonight, whether live or on the feed, then great, welcome,

19
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
hope you enjoy the show.

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,700
I am Rob Roberts and joining me in studio, nobody, joining me in studio is a brand new

21
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,880
little stuffed pumpkin spice latte, that's what we have here in studio as a new stuffed

22
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,440
animal for the chair, sadly due to the pandemic in the world we are still doing the distance

23
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,360
recording, so joining me via Discord, say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

24
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,040
Hello, and by the way, the studio now is in the ether, the studio is in our hearts.

25
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,400
Yes, the studio belongs to the people, it's much like the Harry Potter series, it no longer

26
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,240
belongs to one person, it belongs to the people.

27
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,040
Well, except we're not, you know, transphobic assholes.

28
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,000
Alan is yelling from the kitchen, do the people pay rent?

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,880
On our own places, yo.

31
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,160
Hey, hey, you know what, you guys are always very kind enough, actually I see this going

32
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,760
on right now, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv

33
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,920
slash vog network, VOG network, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the

34
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,360
Bobby Black Wolf show, and we may not charge rent, but some of you are very gracious with

35
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,760
the bits and the subs, and if I see people, like Pod Culture, I don't usually read these

36
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,880
out at the top of the show, but I will this time, Pod Culture just gave out 5 subs, thank

37
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,600
you so much, Dark Soccer, you just gave out one, Bobby resubbed, I mean, there's, and

38
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,240
Sia Dabiri as well, there's just lots of subs, there's a hype train going on right now, and

39
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,960
so obviously it's no secret, we get a little bit of kickback from that that we can use

40
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,960
to reinvest into the network, because running a business is expensive, yo, so we really

41
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,360
appreciate all that, so it may not be rent, but we appreciate all the subs, especially

42
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,460
with this month being the September themed month over at twitch.tv where there's discounts

43
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,960
and all that good stuff, so yay!

44
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
Sweet.

45
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,320
That's right, alright, also sweet, say hello to, also joining us tonight, Techmaster Loki.

46
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,320
Hello.

47
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,320
Hi, how are you?

48
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,320
Doing pretty good.

49
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,000
Yeah, what do you have going on behind you tonight?

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,120
That's not your game, is it?

51
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
That's a different racing game.

52
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,160
No, it's Hotshot Racing came out this week.

53
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,560
Oh yeah, it's an Xbox Game Pass thing, isn't it?

54
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,720
I think it might be, I have it on PC, but it's on Steam, and I think it's on the Xbox

55
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,920
PlayStation 4 and the Switch, it's kind of a throwback to the AM2 racing games that Sega

56
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,920
put out.

57
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,160
Yeah, yeah, no, I was looking and I was like, is that Virtua Racing?

58
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,500
It doesn't really look like it, but it could be, and I knew you were doing a racing inspired

59
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,040
game at one point, it was one of your projects, and I was like, ooh, he's come a long way

60
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,640
in the past couple.

61
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,440
I wish, I wish I was releasing a game on consoles and stuff, yeah, that'd be awesome.

62
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,120
Alright, well that game looks pretty cool, I'm gonna have to check that out at some point,

63
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,960
I've missed that this week, but that looks fun, that is like something that might be

64
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,840
up Dark Sakura's alley too, because Dark Sakura, like, hello, 90s Sega racing inspired

65
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,920
game, like, that has to speak to a special part of you, doesn't it?

66
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,800
Possibly, but I have Animal Crossing.

67
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,440
There's other business to be tended to.

68
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:34,720
I borrowed Horizon Zero Dawn from my friend like a year ago, and never played it because

69
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,680
Animal Crossing.

70
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:44,080
You can't hear the music from it, the music is also on par with those games as well, it's

71
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,000
kind of a throwback to all that stuff, it's pretty difficult too, but pretty fun game.

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,680
I'm gonna have to check out that game at some point, and then one other thing I need to

73
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,960
address here at the top of the show, I know we were out last week, but just a couple of

74
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:02,180
days ago, Loki, it was your birthday, so happy birthday, Loki, thank you, you have a birthday

75
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,220
that's very easy to remember, unfortunately, yeah, unfortunately, oh, but happy birthday

76
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,220
all the same.

77
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,660
Did you do anything special for your day?

78
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,500
I know it's weird with these whole pandemic times and a lot of places being closed, but

79
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,100
were you able to do anything fun?

80
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:23,340
Yeah, so like, I know like everything is frowned upon going out and doing things, but it depends

81
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,340
what you're doing.

82
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,540
Yeah, it depends, like, well, California, different counties are open in different capacities,

83
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:35,740
so just up the hill from us, El Dorado County is a little bit more open, so they have their

84
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,640
theaters open, and some of the restaurants are open for dining, so like, we went out

85
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:46,620
to breakfast and then went and saw Tenet in the theaters, and there was only like seven

86
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,340
people in there, it was really, you know, empty.

87
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,180
I can't imagine a lot of people are going, you know, y'all were wearing your masks the

88
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,060
whole time, I imagine, except when eating popcorn.

89
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,460
Just in the lobby, I mean, obviously in the theater, you don't have to because you're

90
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:04,200
spaced out so far, but like in the lobby, they require masks, but yeah, it was all right,

91
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,580
except for the theater, you know, had the volume turned way too high for the movie,

92
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:13,260
so it was like kind of garbled in parts, and it was like, it was like sitting in a rock

93
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,220
concert, like I had a headache by the end of the movie because it was so loud, like

94
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,380
insanely loud, and I've, I watch a lot of action movies in seven theaters, and like,

95
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:27,220
I know when it's turned up way too loud, so, but it was an okay movie, I liked it.

96
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,300
My dad's birthday is the week before yours, and as you know, he's had a bit of a year,

97
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,220
and I talked about that on prior shows, and he wanted to go out, we did outdoor dining,

98
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:41,060
but I felt really like we were at a chain restaurant out in Roseville that like their

99
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,460
parking lot is huge, and they had their table spaced all throughout the parking lot, so

100
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,500
it wasn't like, like when I see outdoor dining, sometimes like downtown, it looks like the

101
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,780
tables are all up on each other, and I'm like, I don't know how that's safe, but this was

102
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,900
not that at all, so I felt like, wow, we have a lot of space between us and the next table,

103
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,900
this is, this is alright.

104
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,460
So I have to ask, is it the place that has C and J in the name?

105
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,940
Yes it is, yes it is.

106
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,380
Yeah, I had a feeling, yeah, they've got a pretty massive parking lot, but I'm glad that

107
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:12,660
there's social distancing, although now with all the smoke out there, the AQI to date highest

108
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,660
was 325.

109
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah, yeah, this was last week before all those fires began, so it wasn't so bad.

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,860
Before the evil gender reveal parties kill people.

111
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,660
And I have to say something here at some point before we get into the gaming news because

112
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:33,300
there's a lot of it, just our hearts going out to people affected by the fires up in

113
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,420
Northern California, I mean that, I can't profess that I know anybody in Butte Creek

114
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,180
or have even been there, but I do know that's just down the road from where I lived for

115
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:47,120
a few years in Chico, which is a much bigger college town up in that area, and it's way

116
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,200
too close to Paradise that already went through this three years ago, two, three years ago.

117
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,040
I already know a couple of people who are just permanently moving out of Paradise, they

118
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,520
come back after campfire and then we're like, nope, not doing it again.

119
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,800
We have a mutual friend who left for Oregon, and it's even worse there.

120
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,840
Yes, yes, and I was just about to say Oregon is really going through it right now too,

121
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,820
so I thought I saw one person in chat earlier that said they were from the Oregon area,

122
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,620
so just my heart's going out to everybody affected by this.

123
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:24,440
This is so terrible, and obviously there's a lot of jokes about the gender reveal party

124
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,060
and all that stuff, but these fires are much more than that.

125
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:34,460
A fire of many fires was caused by that, but certainly the Oregon fire is a result of essentially

126
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:41,380
climate change and all that, so it's, I really hope we can, as a society, figure out how

127
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,060
to put it into this.

128
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:47,180
It's really scary, and I know not a lot of people are out here on the West Coast, sometimes

129
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,900
our news really centers on the East Coast, but let me tell you, this is affecting all

130
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,900
of us out here.

131
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:57,780
I have not left the house but to maybe go to a Starbucks drive-through in four days

132
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,620
because the smoke quality is so bad.

133
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,740
I can't breathe when I go outside.

134
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:09,500
I actually picked up a respirator for working on my ball-jointed dolls because the stuff

135
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,500
I have to spray them with is pretty toxic, and I ended up busting it out to go out and

136
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,620
check my mail because since I had pneumonia, or if it was COVID, we don't know because

137
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:25,060
it would test me, my lungs haven't really recovered from it that much, so I would step

138
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:30,540
outside and come in and have to grab my rescue inhaler, and so we had to today help Dan's

139
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,540
grandmother.

140
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:38,500
She was giving us some plates and some old dolls and some 50s-era Pyrex, which yes, 50s-era

141
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:46,220
Pyrex, but I ended up having to wear my respirator to do all that work, and then we had another

142
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,980
errand to run, and by the time I got back in the house, my head was already throbbing.

143
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,900
My skin is looking bad.

144
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:59,820
Actually, I've developed a rash from the ashes in the air.

145
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:05,260
For people out there outside of this area, like, oh, it's just some smoke, whatever,

146
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:10,700
it's pretty nasty, and I even made a terrible, morbid joke, but I think my friends know me

147
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,940
enough to know that I make this kind of joke, is like, now that we play the new game, is

148
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,300
it COVID or smoke inhalation?

149
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,860
It's pretty morbid, but it's accurate.

150
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,780
But it's accurate, exactly.

151
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,740
I went out to do a Pokemon Go raid, bring you into gaming a little bit.

152
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,060
I went out to do a Pokemon Go raid at the park that's right near me.

153
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,800
You guys know what I'm talking about, and that was it.

154
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,020
That was all I could tolerate, and it was just like the smoke.

155
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,500
It looked like Silent Hill out there.

156
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,540
It looked like it was fog.

157
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,540
The smoke was so low.

158
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,280
It looked like Silent Hill out there, and just like when you're breathing in, it just

159
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,280
smells like that.

160
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:48,020
It's, I mean, a lot of people like the smell of smoke when it's coming from a Yankee candle

161
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,500
or something, or a scented thing.

162
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,500
Or a bonfire.

163
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,220
But when it's like that, it's the choking kind of smoke, it is not pleasant, I'll tell

164
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,220
you that.

165
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,220
So, yeah.

166
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,220
Anyway, sorry.

167
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,320
Don't mean to deviate too much, but it's just, it is affecting our lives.

168
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,480
I've stayed in and played, I have played so much Final Fantasy XIV this weekend because

169
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,440
of this, it's like disgusting.

170
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
But it's what I have to do.

171
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,200
Yeah, I saw your thing on the crafting you were doing.

172
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,320
Yeah, I'll talk about that in my gaming week.

173
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,320
Sorry, Jamie.

174
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,760
I'll share this with people.

175
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,440
I actually have several Instagrams, you know, I have that at Dark Sakura, but I also have

176
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,960
one that's called All With No Spaces or Underscores Where Sakura Is At, and that's where I've

177
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:37,840
been putting pictures of the skies here and of course, you know, my vegetables and roses.

178
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:43,080
But you know, it's what I made for going out and walking around when I could go out and

179
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,320
walk around.

180
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,280
But lately, like my last few posts have been what the sky looks like in my neighborhood

181
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,080
and around and actually today when I was out in Folsom.

182
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah, and here it's not really that red and orange stuff you were seeing out of San Francisco

183
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,080
or Southern Oregon, like it doesn't look like that here.

184
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,080
It just looks rust.

185
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:08,960
Honestly, the Silent Hill comparison to me is it like it really does look like Silent

186
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,020
Hill out there.

187
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:16,280
So one of the pictures that I have is actually a pano and it shows like I was I was at the

188
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,440
Elk Grove Auto Mall because I had to get my my car my oil change done and the pano was

189
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,680
me going from left to right and you can actually see the thickness of the cloud of smoke and

190
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,920
the difference it makes in the color.

191
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,920
Yikes.

192
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,760
So and I'll be happy to really get in the chat room.

193
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:40,440
But just if you go to at where Sakura is at on Instagram, then I've got some pretty good

194
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,400
pictures to show people.

195
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
All right.

196
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,360
Well, let's get into some gaming news, which we've talked a lot here in the opening about

197
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,360
what's going on.

198
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
IRL.

199
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,440
We talked about Silent Hill and Pokemon Go.

200
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,440
All right.

201
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,160
Let's get into some gaming news.

202
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,040
Let's start off with probably the biggest news item from last week.

203
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,800
OK, Loki, do you want to do you want to start us off with the big, big item from last week?

204
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,920
Yeah, I mean, there wasn't really any news over the last few weeks.

205
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,400
It has been completely blown up.

206
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:14,720
So it's a Nintendo finally put out a direct that was targeting the thirty fifth anniversary

207
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,400
of Super Mario Brothers.

208
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,580
So lots of announcements around that, of course, one of the bigger announcements is the Super

209
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:28,500
Mario 3D All-Stars, which is coming out this week on the 18th, which is a combination of

210
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:35,820
Super Mario 64, Mario Sunshine and Super Mario Galaxy one Super Mario Galaxy two doesn't

211
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,860
exist in their world, unfortunately.

212
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,220
I don't know why that isn't in there.

213
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,020
That's kind of weird.

214
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,500
Maybe they couldn't fit in the cartridge.

215
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,220
I don't know, but it's not part of the collection.

216
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,200
So that's going to be coming out soon.

217
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:56,960
We do have, though, the original Super Mario All-Stars out as part of the Super Nintendo

218
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,520
online library.

219
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,240
So you can actually play that now.

220
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,240
So that's available.

221
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
Can I announce?

222
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,080
Can I stop there real quick for you to get another news to talk about the 3D All-Stars

223
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,820
and the original All-Stars a little bit?

224
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,960
Anybody here on the panel picking up the 3D All-Stars planning on it?

225
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
Sixty dollars?

226
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,960
Yes.

227
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
You are getting it.

228
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
Yeah, we are too.

229
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
Wow.

230
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,960
I'm I'm in the no camp.

231
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,960
I'm not going to get it.

232
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,400
Well, then you can just you have to come over here and play it, then I'm getting it for

233
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,400
my kids.

234
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
That's that's it.

235
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
All right.

236
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,840
I know who's really into me.

237
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,200
I am my kid.

238
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:36,080
Both valid reasons for me, like I and it's not even so much the price tag.

239
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:41,240
Like I understand that sixty dollars for three rock solid games and I consider Sunshine a

240
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,240
great game.

241
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,120
I know that one is divisive for some reason in the community.

242
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,560
My problem with it is, is that I don't think this collection is deserving of the All-Stars

243
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,560
name.

244
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,440
I said it and I believe that.

245
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,480
And if you want to reference what I'm talking about, go back to the original Super Mario

246
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,720
All-Stars and look at what kind of collection that was.

247
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,680
That was something that they really rebuilt from the ground up and put at a level that

248
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,280
was brand new for that system that they were putting it on at the time on the Super Nintendo.

249
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,120
When it came out, though, those were what they had as All-Stars.

250
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,560
No, no, no.

251
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,520
I understand what he's saying.

252
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,560
He seems basically they didn't just re-release like emulated versions of the game.

253
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,120
They rebuilt the games in newer engines and put it out there.

254
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,840
And yeah, this is like hardly anything.

255
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,840
We upscaled it a little bit.

256
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,640
They turned on a feature on Super Mario Sunshine that was honest.

257
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,440
I want to go back and fact check.

258
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,400
Wasn't that there?

259
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,360
The widescreen thing.

260
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,880
Wasn't that there already?

261
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,560
Because I know some games on GameCube like F-Zero GX AX supported the widescreen thing

262
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,720
on HD TVs at the time.

263
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,320
Now, I don't it's been so long since I played Sunshine, and I definitely didn't play it

264
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,600
on HDTV when I did.

265
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,440
So I don't remember if that was a feature, but I feel like 16 by 9 ratio in that era

266
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,400
of gaming was not exactly unheard of.

267
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,960
So it may be that they built it out and just enable it.

268
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,760
I don't know.

269
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,520
But I'm sorry.

270
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:19,760
I don't find that that great of an addition compared to what these games deserve, which

271
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:25,280
is the original All-Stars collection is not just a great collection.

272
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:31,040
It stands on its own as one of the greatest video game releases of all time, period.

273
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,360
And I would have just hoped that something labeled 3D All-Stars would kind of carry on

274
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,400
in that tradition.

275
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,000
And I know there's a lot of Nintendo fans out there that are going to say, ah, Phooey,

276
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,520
you're just a hater, Rob Roberts.

277
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,400
And I'm going to let my track record on this show speak is that I'm not a hater all the

278
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:46,960
time.

279
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,880
I will root for Nintendo and Sony and Microsoft when they should be rooted for.

280
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,200
I will be critical when they need to be criticized.

281
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:59,280
And this is one of those things where I'm like, I'm sorry, this collection feels extremely

282
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,560
half-assed to me.

283
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,680
And it's just they're going to go through on the strength of the original originality

284
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:12,080
of these titles, many of which they've released before, like Mario 64 has already been released

285
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,120
I don't know how many times.

286
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,560
And I just feel like, you know what?

287
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,760
I have my 3DS.

288
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,440
I can play Mario 64 on that.

289
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,120
I still have my Wii U for whatever reason.

290
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,400
I can still play Galaxy and Galaxy 2 on that because I have those original Wii discs.

291
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,320
I just I'm not about it.

292
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,640
I just don't want to dig out the N64.

293
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,440
And I get it.

294
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,080
I get it.

295
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,720
And again, I'm not to tell anybody else how to spend their money.

296
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,680
And I get it.

297
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,200
And I would lie.

298
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,000
I would be lying if I didn't say I'm kind of tempted.

299
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,240
There's a part, excuse me, I'm sorry.

300
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,360
There's a part of me that's a little bit tempted.

301
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,760
But then I think what really just kind of was like, oh, fuck it was when I heard that

302
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,680
they're doing this artificial, uh, deadline scarcity tactic by turning up.

303
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,960
You have to understand they never, they never purposely make their products scarce.

304
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,720
It's just that they just can't, they just can't import enough, you know, data to just

305
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,160
carry this title for an extended period of time.

306
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,440
So they have to remove it arbitrarily in the end of March for no reason.

307
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,200
This whole thing with them having the artificial scarcity by turning off the digital day.

308
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,920
This makes me go back and really question when into, you know what?

309
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,680
Maybe Loki was onto something all these years and all those times Nintendo said, nah, we've

310
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,160
we're really trying to put out as much hardware as we can.

311
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,720
No, we, we, we, the supply is just outside to me.

312
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,160
We're really trying to put out the hardware.

313
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,080
I feel like, God damn it, Nintendo.

314
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,480
I'd stuck up for you all those times when it came to the hardware and rooting for you.

315
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,200
Yeah, exactly.

316
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,920
Here we go again.

317
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,960
14 years now.

318
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,880
So I mean, like we were rooting for you and now it's like, I, I can no longer say, oh,

319
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:01,760
maybe Nintendo's trying because they made it very clear, very clear that they are interested

320
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,880
in creating a scarce market to drive up the value of the game and make sure this game

321
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,640
sells a lot this holiday season because Nintendo doesn't really have anything else save for

322
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,040
a third party title we'll get into later.

323
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,920
And I look, I get the COVID screwed everything up.

324
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,960
I get that, but that's not a reason for this game to have the artificial scarcity.

325
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,920
It's ridiculous.

326
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,960
I hate it.

327
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,400
I actually hate it.

328
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,960
And I'm going to vote with my wallet on this one.

329
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,320
Well, and they also said like the physical release of it too.

330
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,880
Like, um, some retailers have been saying that it's extremely scarce, the quantities

331
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,560
that they're going to be getting like of the physical version of this, because they're

332
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,400
trying to drive the price up it.

333
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,400
There's no reason why they can't print more of these cartridges.

334
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,960
And I'm not, I'm no longer going to defend.

335
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,200
I'm going, I'm no longer going to, yeah.

336
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,560
I know there's some Nintendo fanboys and stuff out there that get angry when Loki goes

337
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,360
on these tangents.

338
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,240
Nintendo's action here of making this March scarcity day, I can no longer defend Nintendo

339
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,680
when Loki goes on these tangents.

340
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,200
Yes, I agree.

341
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,960
They're making things artificially scarce.

342
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,000
Yes.

343
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,960
And to go along with that to even more frustration.

344
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,360
So wait, I'm sorry.

345
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,680
I know you want to get to the rest of the news, but I need to get chat comments.

346
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm sorry.

347
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,840
Cause I've been ignoring chat and we do tape live every Sunday night at twitch.tv slash

348
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,120
vog network.

349
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,280
And fifth dream is in our chat room saying Nintendo is the Disney of video games.

350
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,160
You know, what's interesting.

351
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,480
I've heard that comparison a lot this week and talking about the scarcity, but guess

352
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:30,800
what?

353
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,720
Did you know the Disney vault is no more?

354
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,800
There is no larger at all.

355
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,560
What are you not sure at all?

356
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,960
Disney, Disney plus has everything except song of the South, which is a whole nother

357
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,280
Oprah.

358
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,640
I'm not getting into tonight.

359
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,800
No, they're still doing that stuff though with their movies.

360
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,320
In fact, they're doing it now with the Fox movies too, that they're putting them in the

361
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,280
vault, so to speak.

362
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,520
I think it's still around, but yeah, it's less, less prevalent because now of the Disney

363
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,040
plus stuff, but that's what they're, they're selling Disney plus is what they're doing.

364
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:07,760
But the physical like DVDs and Blu-rays that stuff is it's still same as always.

365
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,880
But, but no, but digital Disney did not make digital scarcity.

366
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,720
In fact, everything is out on digital when it comes to Disney plus with the exception

367
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:23,440
of, again, if you want to argue bits and pieces, there are certain problematic movies

368
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,360
of the past that have these other separate issues and we're not going to get into that

369
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,000
tonight.

370
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,600
But the thing is, is that these other animated classics in their library, like Snow White,

371
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,960
Cinderella, all this stuff that hasn't been on DVD and Blu-ray in years is now part of

372
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,160
the Disney plus library.

373
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,560
And they kind of tore that down, I suppose.

374
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,560
Um, I was going to say to go into the March, once again, artificial scarcity.

375
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,040
So the other thing that they're doing too, Super Mario Brothers 35, which is like Tetris

376
00:21:53,040 --> 00:22:00,160
99, but now with Super Mario Brothers, that's also only available until March, 2021 for

377
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,800
some reason.

378
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,920
I, you know, it's weird.

379
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,760
This one I let slide because, and when, when that came up first, cause that was the first

380
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,880
thing in the direct, I think.

381
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,360
And when that came up first, I was like, all right, whatever.

382
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,600
Maybe they just feel like the player base won't be there.

383
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,440
Cause you know how sometimes like the player base is all there and then it's like, nobody's

384
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,560
playing it online anymore.

385
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,160
Everybody went on to the next thing.

386
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,360
So maybe they kind of put an end date on it to, um, just kind of have the player base

387
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,720
there for a certain amount of time and then go on to the next thing, whatever it may be.

388
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:35,120
And plus, since it is a enhancement for Nintendo online, which we need more of those, um, I'm,

389
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,920
I'm oddly okay with it being end dated in that case.

390
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,600
I'm surprised that there hasn't been more announcements of games coming to the service

391
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,320
because this is about the time everybody's, you know, memberships are running up because

392
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,720
of the free memberships that they received with Twitch.

393
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,840
Now's the time when that stuff's kind of coming back.

394
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,120
What new stuff do you have for me?

395
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,800
It's not really, I mean, there's this, but this is only until March.

396
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,680
I mean, I don't know.

397
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,880
There's not really a lot that they've announced that they have coming.

398
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,480
Um, other games that are going to be coming out next year.

399
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,920
So super Mario 3d world is getting, uh, re-released and they're also adding new content

400
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,000
to that in the form of Bowser's fury.

401
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
That's going to be coming out February 12th.

402
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,320
Um, that's cool.

403
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,680
That's a great Mario game.

404
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,000
If you missed it on Wii U, you really should pick it up.

405
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,920
Yeah, it is really good.

406
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,960
Um, they also announced that they're going to be doing a physical gaming watch.

407
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,000
That's going to have Mario or super Mario brothers and my brothers to the loss levels.

408
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,160
As well as, uh, kind of a modified version of ball in there as well.

409
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,800
So that's going to be available, sort of available.

410
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:52,720
I mean, we're talking to Nintendo here, so probably impossible to find on November 13th.

411
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,640
This is their version.

412
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,240
This is basically what they're doing this year instead of a Nintendo light or what were

413
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,640
those things called the mini Nintendo, the mini super Nintendo.

414
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,240
Everybody thought, Oh, we're going to get them in mini Nintendo 64.

415
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,600
And it's like, Nope, now you're going to get a mini game and watch of sorts.

416
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,280
And maybe next year there'll be a Zelda game and watch of sorts.

417
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,960
I don't think Nintendo is ready to do the 64 collection just yet for whatever.

418
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:21,600
Well, why, why would they, when they're basically still valuing Mario 64 at 20 bucks in this

419
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,120
other collection they're doing, wouldn't it be silly for them to put out the 3d all-stars

420
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,120
and a mini 64 in the same year?

421
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,440
Cause both are going to have Mario 64 on it.

422
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,680
So I just, I feel like we're still a couple of years away.

423
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,920
I think game and watch is kind of their idea of if this one does well, they'll probably

424
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,120
do a Zelda one next year.

425
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:43,040
Um, they showed off this new toy that's called a Mario Kart live home circuit.

426
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:49,120
So it's actually a physical, uh, like RC car that you control with your switch and it uses

427
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,320
AR and a camera that's built into the cars to create tracks and actually drive your car

428
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,360
through the house.

429
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,720
I don't have a house big enough for that, but, uh, my kids want it.

430
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,640
So they're like, we have to get that.

431
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,160
I'm like, uh, I don't know if we're going to be able to, uh, but that's going to be

432
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:09,120
coming, uh, looks like on October 16th, no price announced for that.

433
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,400
It's 99 99.

434
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,600
Somebody leaked, uh, at least it was like a Walmart listing or something went up.

435
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,440
Now, um, I will say this.

436
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,200
I was very hard on Nintendo earlier, so now I'll give, now I'll give the good news.

437
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,240
The fanboys stuff.

438
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,560
This looks rad.

439
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:30,560
Like I kind of just don't think I'm going to get it because my house is carpeted.

440
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,680
I'm sure it works on carpet.

441
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,400
Fine.

442
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,440
I just, it would just be me, Alan, I think would walk in and go, that's interesting.

443
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,720
And that would be about it.

444
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,120
The cat would be terrorized by this thing.

445
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,400
So I'm not sure I have a big need for this.

446
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,480
I'm excited to watch other people play it.

447
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:53,760
If I was the age of Loki's kids, if I was like nine years old or so, I would be all

448
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,720
about this thing.

449
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,200
I would want this so fucking bad.

450
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,640
It is so cool.

451
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,120
Um, but I, I'm not sure I can justify it for me now, but I can still look at it and go,

452
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,560
yeah, that looks neat.

453
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,040
And isn't that funny that the rumors were Nintendo was working on a new Mario Kart game

454
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,640
for the holiday and everybody just assumed it was Mario Kart nine.

455
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,040
Oops, oops.

456
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,720
But this is cool.

457
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,680
You assume.

458
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,160
I know.

459
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,120
Some other smaller things that they announced.

460
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,520
So, uh, they talked about it, some more tie-ins with different things, new animal crossing

461
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,360
content with super Mario brothers theme.

462
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,600
Furniture's not coming out until March.

463
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,440
Um, but it is coming.

464
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,840
They're doing some splat fests that are gonna be in January, uh, Mario themed stuff.

465
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,320
They're also going to have some actual t-shirts and stuff you can get with the splat fest

466
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,000
themes that look kind of cool.

467
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,720
Um, they showed some shoes.

468
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,200
So, oh my God shoes.

469
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,840
Uh, but yeah, I mean, so that, that's pretty much what it was.

470
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,040
Guess what, everybody?

471
00:26:53,040 --> 00:27:00,320
These shoes are $300 on the Nintendo, on the animal crossing thing.

472
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,520
Like obviously I know dark soccer is all about that animal crossing life.

473
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,040
I love me some animal crossing too.

474
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,640
We all do here at OLR.

475
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,240
Um, but you know, let me ask this question because they're, they're remaking, remastering

476
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,800
super Mario brothers one, the original light candy it's on the Nintendo online

477
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,200
service.

478
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,280
They gave it away again in all stars.

479
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,480
It's on the game and watch.

480
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,760
I mean, everywhere you're looking, there's a super Mario brothers one.

481
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:31,440
So why not just for shits and giggles, put the damn cartridge furniture in animal crossing

482
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,640
and let us enjoy the original super Mario brothers in our house.

483
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,880
That would be a throwback.

484
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,120
Yeah.

485
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,160
Or like, how about have that furniture available?

486
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,640
If you have a Nintendo online account and then like, say it, I mean, obviously you wouldn't

487
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,120
be visiting for the pocket camp stuff.

488
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:47,920
Yeah.

489
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,840
So obviously they wouldn't have like, you wouldn't say for whatever reason, you didn't

490
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,840
have the online, you could buy the furniture, but maybe you couldn't play it or something

491
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,240
like that.

492
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,880
You would need to have the online or the play this stuff.

493
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,440
But like, yeah, I don't understand why they can't do that.

494
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,640
I mean, it makes sense that it would work, but that would get me really excited if, if

495
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,800
they did something like that would be a true throwback for animal crossing would be the,

496
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,400
you know, NES systems.

497
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,480
I'm not, I'm not even asking for everything.

498
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:14,800
Okay.

499
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,360
I just, just put the original super Mario brothers in there as a little throwback, which

500
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:25,920
was that even unlockable and it was, it was rare to unlock it, but yes, it was.

501
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,160
Okay.

502
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,520
Cause I remember Zelda was in there and you actually couldn't get it without like a code

503
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,160
or something like that.

504
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,400
Like you, it never actually unlocked, but it was in there.

505
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,560
And I think there was another game along those lines too.

506
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,680
So yeah, Zelda super Mario brothers.

507
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,960
I can't remember the other ones are like that.

508
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,600
Power 573 says GameCube animal crossing was great with like the 20 NES games built into

509
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,320
the game.

510
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,920
What do you think was the bait that got me hooked?

511
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:56,400
I wouldn't have, I would have never given animal crossing a second glance back then

512
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,680
if it wasn't for that.

513
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,520
And I actually remember Loki.

514
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,080
That was, that was on you because you had a very nice situation because your work at

515
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,880
the time you were the one that got me animal crossing in the GameCube.

516
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,520
And I'm thankful for that to this day.

517
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,920
But I would have never said dear Santa or dear birthday fairy.

518
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,960
This is what I want if they hadn't said 20 NES games in it.

519
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:26,240
You know, Rob, what I played animal crossing on Nintendo 64 when they had them on the thing

520
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,440
out in San Francisco.

521
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,120
And if I recall correctly, the Nintendo 64 version didn't have the games in it.

522
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,840
I don't believe it did.

523
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,080
I think it had a reduced number.

524
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,280
I think it had like eight of them.

525
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,080
Yeah, yeah.

526
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,720
But did any.

527
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:43,840
Yeah, it had Clu Clu Land, Balloon Fight, Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr, Pinball, Tennis,

528
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,320
and it had the B tier games.

529
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,560
And you could get Warriors Woods and Baseball from the island.

530
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:56,800
And then you could also pick up Soccer, Donkey Kong Jr, Donkey Kong Jr 3, Clu Clu Land D

531
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,440
and Punch Out.

532
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:05,120
But it also though had in the game, you could do an e-reader for Mario Brothers and Ice

533
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,920
Climber.

534
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,720
And then for Animal Force Plus, you had a Famitsu giveaway for Super Mario Brothers,

535
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,320
and then you could cheat to get the Legend of Zelda.

536
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,320
But these were with the e-reader cards.

537
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,240
They were like loyalty gifts from Tom Nook.

538
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:27,360
But I mean, I didn't even know that they were in there when I was playing it on demo.

539
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,920
In San Francisco, and I fell in love with it because I love this kind of games.

540
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,400
So yeah, the moment the US one came out, I had it.

541
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,560
You excited for the Mario furniture?

542
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:45,600
It probably, it'll be more stuff to take up space in my storage, so I'll collect it.

543
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,120
I mean, basically right now I'm selling off everything in my storage that isn't super

544
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,640
expensive because now I can pretty much order anything.

545
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,560
I'm working on my catalog right now.

546
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,760
But yeah, I mean, I'll have it for the catalog.

547
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,800
That'll be fun.

548
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,400
Random Animal Crossing tangent, because that happens sometimes on this show.

549
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,160
I saw the funniest thing on Twitter this week.

550
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:11,200
It was a screenshot that was clearly done on Harvey's Island, and it had the dog.

551
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,880
I think it's Lucky, the one that's wearing a bandage or looks like a money.

552
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,920
Yeah, that's Lucky.

553
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:20,240
And he's surrounded by bonfires and campfires, and it just says, this is fine.

554
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,000
Yeah, yeah.

555
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,120
That cracked me up.

556
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,160
Although, um, I posted this a long time ago in my group, which I know you're

557
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,840
not doing that thing anymore, but I'm Facebook free two months now.

558
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:38,320
Someone made the ending of Midsommar in Animal Crossing, and I'll have to find it in

559
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,240
LinkedIn chat because it's the most hilarious thing I've ever seen, especially, you know,

560
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,360
how much I love that movie.

561
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,840
I know.

562
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,800
Look, I haven't seen it, but I've heard it's been kind of spoiled for me.

563
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,840
I've heard about the ending.

564
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,320
Okay.

565
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:48,640
Yeah.

566
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,560
And it's kind of like, that's kind of like somebody did that in Animal Crossing.

567
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,600
That's disturbing.

568
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,640
Well, I mean, we have Aika Village is back.

569
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:58,640
All right.

570
00:31:59,200 --> 00:31:59,760
Moving on.

571
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,000
All right.

572
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,840
Anything else in the Mario Direct that we missed?

573
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,600
We got too tangenty.

574
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,560
Um, no, I think that's pretty much everything that was announced in that direct.

575
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,600
All right.

576
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,400
Awesome.

577
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,080
Uh, let's move into this week.

578
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,160
I mean, I guess we didn't talk about Mario Kart Tour, but I don't really talk about Mario

579
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,880
Kart Tour.

580
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,640
Oh, the cell phone game.

581
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,080
I need to try it again now that you can play it in landscape mode.

582
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,000
It sounds like about time, right?

583
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,280
Yeah.

584
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:25,520
Yeah.

585
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,680
So they they're doing an event in there as well.

586
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:32,080
Um, and then there's also something with a Super Mario Maker 2.

587
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,760
They're doing an anniversary themed Ninji speed run course in November.

588
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,680
Um, that's it.

589
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,720
That's everything.

590
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,600
I was hoping for my Mario All-Stars skin in Mario Maker 2.

591
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,520
Wouldn't that have been the nice way to cap it off?

592
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,120
I okay, maybe not.

593
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,960
I would have liked to have seen the Mario All-Stars skin in Mario Maker 2, but whatever.

594
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,560
All right, moving on.

595
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,800
Let's get into what happened this week.

596
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:07,440
So, uh, when we last left our adventures last week before the big break for, uh, Dragon

597
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,840
Con slash Labor Day, we were still in a stalemate between Sony and Microsoft as to who is going

598
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,880
to unveil the details of their console first.

599
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:24,320
And in kind of a surprise twist, but not quite a surprise twist, uh, leakers beat them both

600
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,880
to it and forced Microsoft's hand.

601
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,520
Right, Loki?

602
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,760
Yes, that's true.

603
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,840
So, uh, the first thing that was leaked out was information about this brand new console,

604
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,160
the Xbox Series S, which we already know kind of leaked out from those controllers that

605
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,800
came out that were mentioning the Xbox Series S.

606
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,120
So we knew it was a thing that was going to be announced.

607
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:53,200
It just, you know, when, uh, so it was leaked out that there's video of it and the price

608
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,000
point and everything.

609
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,000
So it was leaked out that it was supposed to be $299 and it was going to be less, less

610
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,240
powerful than the Xbox Series X, but, um, still, you know, going to be a next gen console.

611
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:13,280
So that kind of, uh, forced then, uh, Microsoft in kind of a hilarious fashion to announce,

612
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,840
to make that announcement, uh, official, uh, later on.

613
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:22,080
So they finally did come out and say, Oh yes, you know, this is a legit thing.

614
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:29,440
Um, then they also later on the week announced that the Xbox Series X is going to be $499,

615
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,600
which is what it was rumored to be as well.

616
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,880
Um, so a little bit more details on the Xbox Series X.

617
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,360
Um, no disk drive, it's all digital.

618
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:42,720
It's going to be, uh, basically targeting, uh, 1440p on the game.

619
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,120
I'm sorry.

620
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,080
I have to back up.

621
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,080
That's not what I'm under the understanding of.

622
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,880
I thought Xbox X has a drive and there's this, I know you're going to get into it, but there's

623
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:56,080
another rumored spec that is the S the S is, Oh shit.

624
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,480
I'm sorry.

625
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,680
These names.

626
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:57,840
Yes.

627
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,240
I know S and X sound very similar.

628
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,560
These names aren't great.

629
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,160
These names are really not great.

630
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:04,480
I'm sorry.

631
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,640
That's like X Ray S like Sierra.

632
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:06,960
Yes.

633
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,280
Okay.

634
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,480
So sorry.

635
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:08,800
Yes.

636
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,080
S has no disk drive.

637
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,640
Sorry.

638
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,040
Yes.

639
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,200
S the one that S for speaker, because it looks like a speaker grill.

640
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:21,760
Um, so the Xbox Series S is going to be targeting 1440p.

641
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,960
Um, that's going to upscale to 4k though.

642
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,960
Um, but this is more for like folks, like if you don't have a 4k TV and you just want

643
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,400
to play the next gen games, um, the graphics are still gonna be better.

644
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,640
It's still gonna have, you know, Ray Tracey and everything.

645
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,720
It's just not going to be native 4k.

646
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,720
It will be up to 120 frames per second though in 1440p.

647
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,600
So that's pretty awesome.

648
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,720
Well, uh, I'm going to tell you, here's the thing.

649
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,280
I would imagine no one here on this panel is interested in Xbox Series S.

650
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,680
I'm curious if anyone in chat is interested in this one.

651
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,840
And I see this question going around Twitter a lot is who is this console for?

652
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,200
Who's going to buy this?

653
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,200
Um, I have two answers to this.

654
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:05,920
Number one, um, there's going to be other countries where the cost of, uh, consoles

655
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:12,640
is so expensive that the Xbox Series S is the only one that is like reasonable for people

656
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,000
to probably import.

657
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,600
And so the fact that it still will play kind of the current generation of games, I think

658
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,520
is an important kind of selling factor.

659
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,640
So I think you have that.

660
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,960
I don't think it's just for, um, people in the U S that's for sure.

661
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,720
Um, certainly there's going to be households where it's like, eh, we just want to play

662
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,680
Madden.

663
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,920
Then maybe a Series S will be for them.

664
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,800
And some folks are thinking about, you know, it's like a second console for kids or whatever

665
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,000
maybe for them.

666
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,360
Um, the other thing I don't think many people are talking about, but I think is a very important

667
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:43,860
point.

668
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:50,080
Didn't Microsoft say last month, they are no longer making the Xbox One as we know it

669
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,800
today.

670
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,240
They stopped making the Xbox One and that means the Xbox One X, the Xbox One.

671
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:04,400
So the Xbox Series X, God damn these names, the Xbox Series S is for people who want to

672
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,920
buy a new Xbox One.

673
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,520
And that's not to say that these games aren't going to look good either.

674
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,360
Cause 1440 P upscale to 4k is still going to be pretty good.

675
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:19,600
I mean, you're sure it's not native 4k, but a lot of games, like, especially out in this

676
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:24,640
current generation, aren't native 4k anyways, they're upscaled from a lower resolution into

677
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,140
4k.

678
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,600
So it, I don't think it's necessarily going to be a game, you know, deal breaker for a

679
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,160
lot of people.

680
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,400
And to be honest, a lot of folks will rather take the $200 savings than, you know, have

681
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,280
games look a fraction of the, you know, I guess the, the big difference would be, it's

682
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:49,280
like having a really top of the line and PC running games versus a mid tier gaming PC.

683
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,360
Both are still going to be fine.

684
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:56,320
You know, granted one may look marginally better than the other one, but overall it's

685
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,000
going to probably play the same.

686
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,600
It just, if you really, really, really care about, you know, the quality and everything,

687
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,840
then you'll get the more expensive system.

688
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:08,960
And if you don't really care, then you can get the less expensive system and maybe it's,

689
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,240
you know, size or something.

690
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,080
I mean, that system is much smaller.

691
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,960
They're saying it's 60% smaller than the Xbox Series X.

692
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,720
You know, processor wise, it is less powerful.

693
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,280
I don't know.

694
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,800
I mean, I definitely think that there's a home for it with a lot of people.

695
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,040
Plus when you consider that you're looking at the PlayStation 5, which it's got their

696
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,760
all digital version as well, which is marginally smaller.

697
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,280
I mean, it's just looks enormous.

698
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,840
But I guess we'll, you know, learn about that later.

699
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:46,560
It, I think they're just trying to be competitive pricing wise, because now, like, say, you

700
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,600
know, I mean, we're in the middle of a recession, middle of like COVID, maybe people don't have,

701
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,760
you know, that amount of money to drop on a console.

702
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,920
$299 is a little bit easier of a sell, especially as part of that.

703
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,560
One of the things that they announced is that they're bringing back the program where you

704
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,000
can basically finance it.

705
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,920
So you have like, I think it's like $25 or $35 a month, plus it throws in Xbox Live Gold,

706
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,280
Xbox Game Pass, or I guess it's Xbox Game Pass Ultimate now, which is pretty cool.

707
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,720
So it throws all that together.

708
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,760
And, you know, that's just a really good deal, all that thrown together.

709
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,680
Yeah, that's a really sweet deal, maybe for people that, you know, don't have all the

710
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,400
money necessarily right up front, but are still interested in carry on gaming again,

711
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,840
like Madden sports games or Halo or, you know, those key Xbox exclusives that they want to

712
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,960
play, this deal makes a lot of sense.

713
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:45,120
Not for me, but for other folks that maybe can't just drop, you know, $300 or haven't

714
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,000
been saving or whatever.

715
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,920
It makes a lot of sense.

716
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,360
So a few more things I forgot to mention.

717
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,840
Pre-orders start on the 22nd of September.

718
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:57,360
So just a couple of weeks away, the Series X and the Series S are supposed to be out

719
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,800
November 10th.

720
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,360
And then there's still a rumor out there that there's going to be one more console

721
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,880
that's not been announced yet.

722
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,440
The rumor is that there's a Xbox Series V that's supposed to be an all digital version

723
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,920
of the Series X, same spec wise as the X, but just no disk drive.

724
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,640
And that's supposed to be somewhere in between cost from the X and the S.

725
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,200
We'll see if that's a thing or not.

726
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,840
But right now, let's just consider that this is it.

727
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,200
And, you know, we'll wait to see what Sony responds with.

728
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,880
Now the chatters, and I apologize, it scrolled, it way scrolled off the screen before I could

729
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,440
get to it here.

730
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,560
But the chatters were correcting me is that not all of the old Xbox Ones have stopped

731
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,200
production.

732
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,280
The Xbox One X, the kind of highest end one that did stop production.

733
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,360
The one they're still making is the Xbox One S, which I think is kind of the budget

734
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,520
Xbox One, which would continue to be like the budget console.

735
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:55,520
But this still, I mean, the Xbox Series S still kind of replaces that Xbox One X kind

736
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,720
of in the ecosystem.

737
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,960
I still kind of know what I said.

738
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,120
But Xbox One S is now, because that's like, what, $1.99?

739
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,760
If that, it might be $1.49 at this point.

740
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,520
That is the budget Xbox, which is still going to play a lot of stuff.

741
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,680
And it will play a thing.

742
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,960
A lot of these, at least the first party games are going to be compatible with it.

743
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,400
So, yeah.

744
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,120
Honestly, the only thing, the only problem I really have with Microsoft is doing is the

745
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:23,520
naming.

746
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,960
I think the naming is really bad.

747
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,760
Like, look how we're confusing S and X, and they're too close.

748
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,040
It just also sounds alike, and that's kind of confusing.

749
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:40,160
It's not good, but the consoles themselves, I think I will probably, as of today, as of

750
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,560
this moment, I am probably going to get an Xbox Series X on launch day.

751
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,400
I can't say the same about PlayStation 5 today.

752
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,680
Now, obviously, and we'll get to it later in the show, you guys watching live, see it

753
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,640
on the sidebar.

754
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,440
A lot could change this week with the PlayStation 5 showcase.

755
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,320
We'll see.

756
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,160
Something else about my situation that is very important that I think a lot of people

757
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,320
are going to be kind of like, this could sway people.

758
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,520
Either way, I have a PlayStation 4 Pro.

759
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,840
I have an Xbox One.

760
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,080
That's it.

761
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,560
Period.

762
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,240
Xbox One before they started out with all the numbers and the series, all that other

763
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:16,800
stuff.

764
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,160
So my point is, my Xbox One is kind of gaming technology.

765
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,440
It's a few years behind.

766
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,880
My PlayStation 4 Pro is not lagging behind so much.

767
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,800
Something else that is really kind of wooing me on the Microsoft side is that Microsoft

768
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,840
really kind of made that commitment to the whole library is going to move up and get

769
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:39,600
upscaled and be new and have a fresh coat of paint, basically, on the Xbox Series X.

770
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,680
And Game Pass is a pretty sweet deal.

771
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,000
I'm a fan, I got to say.

772
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:52,560
So all of that stuff combined is kind of putting me in Xbox Microsoft's camp today.

773
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:57,040
Again, a lot could change this week with the Sony event, and I might have to break the

774
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:02,640
bank and somehow be able to afford two consoles, or maybe I'll change my mind and get the

775
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,840
PlayStation first.

776
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:08,640
But as of today, in two weeks, I plan to preorder the Xbox Series X.

777
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:10,960
So we'll see.

778
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:13,760
Yeah, same.

779
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,720
Just because I haven't really been I mean, right now, I'm not aware of what they're

780
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,880
launching with over there, but like.

781
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,120
I don't know, just seeing how they've handled this generation with as far as like cross

782
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:32,640
play, mod support, all that stuff, I'm definitely leaning more towards Microsoft.

783
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,840
It is unfortunate, you know, I have a large library of games there, like a huge library

784
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,480
of games there.

785
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:45,200
But I still have a PlayStation 4 Pro, so I could still play all that stuff.

786
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:51,360
I'd be curious to see what they do with PlayStation VR a little bit more once we have some more

787
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,640
announcements there, what that's going to do for how the games are going to look on

788
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,140
that.

789
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,960
I'm more interested in that, but that's something that could be later on.

790
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,000
You know, I don't have to jump in on that day one.

791
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,600
It's going to be interesting to see what happens this holiday, because there's a large

792
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,040
segment of gamers out there and that game.

793
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,080
And it's interesting.

794
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,040
I'm just a lot.

795
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,680
I'm not saying I see us all the time, but a lot of times the Nintendo fanboy kind of

796
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,960
overlaps with this group.

797
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,280
And that's the group that says, I don't like Microsoft.

798
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,320
I don't like Xbox.

799
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,600
I don't like what they're doing.

800
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,520
And you kind of go, why?

801
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,720
And it's, well, I don't like first person shooter.

802
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,120
That's the Halo and the Madden and that stuff.

803
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,800
And my comment to all of that is it is a different Microsoft now.

804
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,000
It is 2020.

805
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,400
Wake up, Nintendo fanboy.

806
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:38,900
Wake up.

807
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,840
And everybody out there, like if you're one of those people that's like, I don't, I just

808
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,040
don't like Microsoft.

809
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:45,540
Wake up.

810
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,880
Don Mattrick is not running that company anymore.

811
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,080
They have come a long way since Phil Spencer's been at the helm.

812
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,920
Do you know how many indie games are on Game Pass now?

813
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:01,200
And like what a good reception things like Tell Me Why are getting, which I think a lot

814
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,640
of people are writing off and like forgetting that something like that exists.

815
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,160
In the Microsoft universe.

816
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,480
So I just, I think if you're one of those people that's, I just don't like Microsoft.

817
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,520
I, you may have your valid reasons, but I want to challenge a little bit.

818
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,600
Have you evaluated that stance in the year 2020?

819
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,840
If you have, and you're still kind of not in their camp.

820
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,480
Okay, fine.

821
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,880
You tried, but if you haven't evaluated them in several years, I really think you should

822
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,000
take another look.

823
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,680
And that's, that's my opinion.

824
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,960
There's just not enough out on it.

825
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,120
Then it makes me want to justify the cost of it yet.

826
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,160
There's nothing that has really spoken to me that much.

827
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:48,320
I, and I, I do understand there's a lot of overlap with Microsoft and Sony, and I understand

828
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:54,000
that it's kind of like, if you have PlayStation five, then Microsoft really has to, and they,

829
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,920
they have been lagging behind in the first party studio, but I kind of feel like we're

830
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,920
going to see it this generation.

831
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:08,080
We're going to really see Microsoft push to be at that same level that Sony's out with

832
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,040
their first parties.

833
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,360
But we'll see.

834
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,920
I'll, I'll be honest.

835
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:21,280
I mean, even for PS five, all the stuff that I really want to play is on switch right now.

836
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,480
I'm kind of like not excited about any of the stuff coming out on any of them.

837
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:34,480
I mean, this is one of the first launches that I'm not remotely excited about anything

838
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,760
really coming out on them.

839
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:44,880
I mean, maybe resident evil village might be worthwhile, but yeah, there's just like

840
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,480
not a whole bunch on here that really, really grabs me.

841
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,600
I kind of don't care.

842
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:55,600
I, I, I mean, like I said, it's one of the first ones where I really don't care.

843
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:03,600
Not every console has had a bang up launch lineup and sometimes consoles don't really

844
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,360
mature into their life cycle for a year or two.

845
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:11,840
I didn't get a PlayStation three until little big planet was finally out.

846
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,960
You know, this was it.

847
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,960
You know, that was kind of the game.

848
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:15,280
Got it.

849
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,240
Yeah.

850
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,040
You know, then yeah, second sign me up.

851
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,480
I love all the Tekken games.

852
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,960
I do think Sony's going to draw.

853
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:28,800
I think where there's all this rumble, I think there's something to these silent Hill rumors.

854
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,280
And I think that is going to be the thing that makes the PlayStation five highly desirable,

855
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,040
but will it be a launch title?

856
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:35,760
I don't think so.

857
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,080
I think it's going to be a holiday 2021 thing.

858
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:43,760
And I think COVID and that whole situation, especially has kind of put the urgency on

859
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,680
adopting these new consoles right away on the back burner a little bit.

860
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,880
But the reason why I still kind of gravitate towards series X in light of me, just saying

861
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:59,920
all that is that Microsoft in the way that I haven't seen Sony do has made a commitment

862
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,040
to, Hey, not only is this console going to play all the new stuff, but day one, we're

863
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:10,560
going to play these optimized and new versions and new coats of paint and upscaled and, and

864
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,240
making all your old games look great again.

865
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,200
And that's kind of why I'm a little bit of Microsoft's camp right now.

866
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,240
Cause it kind of adds something sweet to that launch that otherwise is missing.

867
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,840
So I'll be honest, I'm probably going to still stick with, um, a PlayStation.

868
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,520
It's not because of any Microsoft hate.

869
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:36,720
It's just that, I mean, to be honest, the last couple of, actually all the last systems

870
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,360
have had more games that I've wanted to play and I don't see any sign of that really changing.

871
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,320
So it's, it's not the biggest of priorities to me.

872
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:50,400
I'm, I'm, I'm probably going to stick with PlayStation.

873
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,200
All right.

874
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:51,840
And that's fine.

875
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,520
But you know, and you've seen these, these gamers on social media and everything too,

876
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:01,200
where it's like, I don't like Xbox and it's like, I don't, I don't like Apple because

877
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,520
I don't like this one because I'm like.

878
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,440
Everybody who's a hater, shut up and let people enjoy things.

879
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,040
And we can agree on that.

880
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:11,920
All right.

881
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,600
All right.

882
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,200
Anything else on the, on the Microsoft stuff?

883
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:23,040
Um, no, that's pretty much it as far as, um, announcements for, um, Microsoft right now.

884
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,520
So we'll have to wait and see if there's yet another system out there.

885
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:30,000
Um, I did think it was kind of funny though, that one of the things that was shown on social

886
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,640
media this week, uh, about the Xbox series S is that in the video where they were talking

887
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:43,440
about the Xbox, um, series X back in June, there was actually an Xbox series S sitting

888
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,640
on the shelf, um, in the back behind, uh, Phil Spencer or whatever.

889
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:54,960
But, oh yeah, we never saw it because it looked like another book.

890
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,040
Like it's, it's a funny little teehee headline now at this point, but honestly,

891
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,640
how was anybody going to catch that?

892
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,640
It looked like a white book.

893
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,440
So it wasn't like the speaker side was facing out or anything.

894
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,000
It just looked like another book sitting on a shelf, whatever.

895
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,480
It's so funny though.

896
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,120
It's cute.

897
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:11,760
It's cute.

898
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,000
Yeah.

899
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,200
All right.

900
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,240
Let's talk a little bit about the now and our gaming weeks.

901
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,600
So we've had a little bit of time off.

902
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,680
How was our gaming week or weeks?

903
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,200
If we will, I'm going to just step away for a minute to get more water.

904
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,480
Cause I'm, I'm getting thirsty.

905
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,080
So dark soccer and then Loki, how was your gaming weeks?

906
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,160
Well, I really just played a lot of animal crossing.

907
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:38,880
Um, I mean, it's been a pretty busy week cause I am, I've got a promotion at work.

908
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,040
I'm starting my new position tomorrow.

909
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,560
So I've had other things on my mind and, you know, family issues,

910
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,760
but animal crossing has always been like my go-to comfort game.

911
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,360
And it's really been necessary as of late.

912
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:55,440
Um, I, since I finished my other word game, I'm now playing word scapes.

913
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,120
And, um, like they do this like dumb little tournament thing,

914
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,640
like once a week or something.

915
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:06,560
And I invariably finish in like between five to 10th place when I do it.

916
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,160
So it's a fun little game.

917
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:13,120
And for me, I like actually testing the vocabulary on these games

918
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,600
and seeing if they actually recognize legitimate words.

919
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:22,480
So I'm also trying to ease myself back into words with friends too.

920
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,520
Playing with a few people and thank you.

921
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,920
Thank you, Bobby, for the congratulations.

922
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,000
It comes with a raise.

923
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,040
That's makes me happy.

924
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:41,040
Um, but, um, we also, um, are, uh, we traded off AC DC temporarily for another game,

925
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,280
but I forgot which one it was.

926
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,080
I'll be honest.

927
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:51,040
So we've been playing some, uh, some pinball in the house and, um, we've got the, uh,

928
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,080
the Saturn hooked up.

929
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:56,560
So there's been some elevator action returns, uh, gaming going on.

930
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:01,200
And, uh, some of that, uh, outrun for, for switch that's come out.

931
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:06,160
And I, I think I played a couple of NES games on the platform on the switch.

932
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,600
So it's been, it's been pretty okay.

933
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,400
And thanks everybody again for the congratulations.

934
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,440
I appreciate it.

935
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:20,960
Um, but at any rate, um, uh, I, I'm still like, I don't know what it is, but I'm still

936
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:26,400
so antsy to have an update for pattern that I basically am checking my Apple arcade

937
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,920
every day, give me a new game, give me a new game, you know, update my game.

938
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:35,840
So, um, yeah, that's it for me.

939
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,120
All right.

940
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:42,000
Um, so this week I was mainly, uh, just working on game building stuff.

941
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,080
So I haven't played a lot of games.

942
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:49,280
Um, I did of course play some Orna just to, you know, do that, have to do my daily wars

943
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,160
and whatnot.

944
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,600
Um, so I played a little bit of that.

945
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:57,840
I played, um, hot shot racing, which is kind of in my background right now.

946
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,720
Um, so pretty fun racing game.

947
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,840
I've been kind of following the development of that for a while now.

948
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:10,400
Um, it's definitely a throwback to the old Sega racing games and both, you know, in graphics

949
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,880
sound, there's even some tracks that are kind of similar to the old games as well.

950
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,200
Um, so definitely lots of throwback to that and like kind of Ridge racer stuff.

951
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,880
So, uh, very cool.

952
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,280
Um, been playing quite a bit of that.

953
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:30,800
Uh, I've been having to play some of, uh, super or not super Mario Paper Mario and the

954
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,760
Origami King.

955
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,800
Cause my son wants me to fight the bosses for him.

956
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,000
So I've been having to play some of that and help them out with that.

957
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,800
So I still haven't gotten to play my save in a while.

958
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,240
I'm still way behind him now.

959
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,880
Um, what else?

960
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:51,680
Uh, very little of Minecraft, although I probably want to get back into that, uh, as well at

961
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:57,520
some point and maybe do some streaming of that mainly game development stuff that unfortunately

962
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,120
I can't share with you right now.

963
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:05,280
I really, really want to, but I can't hurry the fuck up and finish a game so we can, we

964
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,720
can hype it here on the show.

965
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,200
Oh, yeah, that's right.

966
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,440
There's still the pizza competition.

967
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:17,120
I I've shown, I've shown one of our listeners, what I'm working on only because I ha it was

968
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,640
like, it was bothering me so much.

969
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,160
Like I was going to put it out on Twitter.

970
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,120
I didn't want to do that.

971
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:25,920
Who I'm not saying speak up, who is it?

972
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,920
No privately, right?

973
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,000
Uh, privately except I've shown them.

974
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,480
So, uh, but it's, it's going to be hilarious.

975
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,800
It you're, you're going to love it once it's done.

976
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:39,840
It's, it's very cool.

977
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:46,080
So, uh, coming soon, hopefully in the next few weeks, I'm really rushing to get it done.

978
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:46,560
Oh, I'm sure.

979
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:52,480
I'm sure that'll bring great things for the project, but don't rush a project.

980
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,160
Make it, make it perfect.

981
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,520
The first time, right, right, right.

982
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,160
No, I'm just saying like, I've been working on it a lot.

983
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:03,600
I'm not jump, not just been like kinda, you know, an hour here, wait a couple of weeks,

984
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,400
hour again, I've been working on it every single day.

985
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,120
So, um, it's getting there.

986
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:15,280
No, not like rushing it, like as in bad quality, I'm rushing as in, I want to keep working

987
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,480
on it to get progress done with it, you know, so that it's, it's done.

988
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,000
But, uh, you know, I've been working on gameplay stuff for it.

989
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,360
Um, you'll, you'll understand once I, once I'm done with it, it's completely different

990
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,280
than what I've been working on already.

991
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,400
And it's not in unity.

992
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:36,400
Well, somebody knows somebody, somebody does know the person that should know knows.

993
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,760
So that's all I can say.

994
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:38,480
Okay.

995
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,880
Oh, I have an idea what it might be.

996
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:41,440
All right.

997
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:46,400
Bobby black open chat says, don't rush the project, but rush telling me what it is.

998
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,320
I just want the listener to know.

999
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,000
And now I think I know who it is.

1000
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,280
I think you just gave a clue there, but, uh, I just want that listener to know, you know,

1001
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,520
something that Jamie and I don't know.

1002
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,200
And that's not okay.

1003
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,120
So that'd be cool.

1004
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,480
I can't wait to share it for you.

1005
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:06,880
All right.

1006
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,600
No, we're excited.

1007
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,240
We really are.

1008
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:09,840
Uh, okay.

1009
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,560
Mike, give me a week.

1010
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,520
Um, I've been playing the, the location based games.

1011
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:18,560
Of course, Ingress, Pogo, Orna, not as much though, honestly, with the, with the heat

1012
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:23,840
wave, I was doing so good on my walk-in for a while and with the heat wave and the smoke

1013
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,000
and everything, like I just, I haven't really been outside much.

1014
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,800
So that was that.

1015
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,160
But I did, I tried to play a little bit.

1016
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:34,240
I fell down a rabbit hole in these past few days of crafting and final fantasy 14.

1017
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:38,000
I talk about that game a lot on this show because I do play it just about every night,

1018
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,040
every other night.

1019
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:43,840
Um, I'll get on and run a dungeon or two, usually with Shane, sometimes maybe some other

1020
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,000
people as well, just depending on who's around.

1021
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,600
Uh, and that's kind of been a thing, but I don't know what happened.

1022
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:53,680
Maybe it's because in this most recent patch, they did a minor update to what they call

1023
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:58,720
the Ishgard restoration in the game, which is a different way that you can level crafting

1024
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,680
and kind of contribute.

1025
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:04,560
Basically, it's like, it's kind of like a throwback to the on-carriage thing in World

1026
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:10,720
of Warcraft where everybody contributes projects that they're crafting to this project of hopefully

1027
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,840
creating a housing district in Ishgard at some point.

1028
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:20,000
But, uh, I, I have fallen and by falling off the deep end, I mean, I now have spreadsheets

1029
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:26,560
that I've created that I posted on Twitter, uh, uh, that, uh, track my gathering in the

1030
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:30,640
diadem and how many of everything that's the zone where you do all the crafting or do all

1031
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,280
the gathering.

1032
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:36,560
So it's like, it tracks and like, how many, uh, culinary, uh, turn-ins can I make based

1033
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:39,920
off these mats that I pulled from the diadem earlier today?

1034
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,000
So I have a fucking spreadsheet and everything.

1035
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,080
It's pretty nerdy, but also awesome.

1036
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,400
So that's been my life in Final Fantasy XIV.

1037
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,960
Um, I know, right?

1038
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,280
Right.

1039
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,840
I use an app, Animal Crossing, actually that app and Animal Crossing.

1040
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,640
Now there's like a thing on Twitter.

1041
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,400
You send the thing on Twitter.

1042
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,120
It's like a bot.

1043
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:08,720
You send it a short video of you scrolling through your catalog and it will send you

1044
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,880
a file that you can import into the app to automatically X off everything in your catalog.

1045
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:13,520
It's pretty rad.

1046
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,800
So I've just been using Nook Exchange.

1047
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:23,040
So, um, and because now I've got friends and I who are doing like different, uh, like you

1048
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,360
remember Gwen from our Final Fantasy free company.

1049
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:25,600
Yeah.

1050
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,640
A long time ago.

1051
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:26,880
Wow.

1052
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,440
Yeah.

1053
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,720
Um, we've got, we, we do exchanges and our friend, Melly, we do exchanges.

1054
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:38,560
And, um, my friend, uh, Chris, who is, uh, sister, Jared, Harry, Ariola.

1055
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:43,840
Um, one of my, my sister, um, we've been doing it and a few other people.

1056
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:47,200
It's actually been, uh, uh, Chris, Megzi, we've been doing them.

1057
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,240
It's been pretty cool.

1058
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,040
Nice.

1059
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:54,160
Um, VidPower573 in chat says, spreadsheets, Eve Online players say hi.

1060
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:54,480
Yeah.

1061
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,680
Yeah, no, I, I get it.

1062
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,480
I get it.

1063
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:56,800
All right.

1064
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:02,480
Um, other games in my gaming week, I, I played a lot of Super Mario All-Stars thanks to the,

1065
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,880
uh, kind of surprise release on Nintendo switch, because again, it really, and I meant to what

1066
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,480
I said earlier, it's really just one of the all-time great game releases.

1067
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,480
And I love playing the original Mario brothers and especially Super Mario brothers two.

1068
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,400
And I wanted to see if I still had it, if I could still beat Super Mario brothers two.

1069
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:23,760
And the answer is no, or I gave, I got frustrated and turned it off.

1070
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,920
Cause I lost all my lives before I had the chance to beat it, but I'll try again this

1071
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,160
week.

1072
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,200
I'm just a little rusty.

1073
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:35,600
Um, some new things for me that I played this week, I played a game from hello games.

1074
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:39,440
The folks behind no man's sky, they published a game in the past couple of weeks called

1075
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,040
the last campfire.

1076
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,400
And I checked that game out.

1077
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,920
Um, it honestly has nothing to do with no man's sky.

1078
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:50,720
I think, uh, hello games is just publishing something on behalf of a smaller indie studio

1079
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,880
that is doing something completely different.

1080
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:57,920
Uh, this game reminds me a little bit more of maybe like say a nineties PC puzzler type

1081
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:03,680
thing where basically you go into these different, they're kind of like spirits, but you go into

1082
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:08,000
these different little worlds and try to solve a puzzle to like free the spirit.

1083
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,640
And the whole thing is narrated as you played.

1084
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,480
And I could, I'm like, I know I've seen this trick in a game before.

1085
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,880
I know I've, it was Bastion that did that.

1086
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,680
Say you remember that game Bastion where you're playing the game, except instead of a deep

1087
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,480
manly voice narrating the game, like you did in Bastion.

1088
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:24,640
Right.

1089
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:31,120
You remember that it's instead, it's, it's more of a whimsical female voice that guides

1090
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,440
you through the last campfire.

1091
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,560
It's that's, that's basically, uh, the narrator in that game, but it's kind of that same twist

1092
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,480
where it's being narrated as you're playing.

1093
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,640
Um, act depth and chat says the one that looks like journey.

1094
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:48,960
It kinda has a similar art style, but the games don't really play anything alike.

1095
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:54,720
Uh, the game is more of like a, uh, like a platformer, but a puzzler platformer.

1096
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:58,400
Maybe, maybe like captain toad, but that's really stretching it.

1097
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,960
I feel like I've played some nineties PC puzzler games though, that are a lot like this.

1098
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,920
Um, so it was, yeah, I've, I've been enjoying that game.

1099
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:12,880
Um, then the other game that I've been playing, I did not expect to like this game and I think

1100
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:18,000
it is really good, but this week, uh, the ultimate edition or whatever you want to call

1101
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,520
it of Avicii in vector came out.

1102
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,240
Oh yeah.

1103
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:22,800
Yeah.

1104
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:27,760
Avicii being the musical artist that passed away, um, a few years ago.

1105
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:33,120
Um, but I think at the time he was working with this company to create a music game based

1106
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,280
on his library of music.

1107
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,320
And that game is called in vector or Avicii in vector.

1108
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:41,680
And I guess it's been out on PlayStation four and Xbox for a little bit.

1109
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,680
I kind of missed it, but then a switch version just came out.

1110
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:52,960
And with that came a parody Xbox and PlayStation versions that basically add like 10 new tracks.

1111
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:57,200
It's like some DLC from his last album, Tim.

1112
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,720
And I think there was another album in there as well that it adds some tracks from.

1113
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:05,520
It is all his music, which kind of surprised me how diverse it is.

1114
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:09,360
I mean, of course, of course, I know some Avicii songs, like everybody's heard that,

1115
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:13,520
you know, wait me up when I get, you know, I don't want to, I want to get us muted either

1116
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,360
by my bad singing or from copyright.

1117
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,640
But everybody knows that song.

1118
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,360
Um, but he has a pretty rich library of other songs.

1119
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:23,520
And, uh, it is that type of music that you would expect to hear in music games.

1120
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,080
And as a music game, it's pretty fun.

1121
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:31,120
Like it's, um, it's got a very similar, but not same approach to amplitude.

1122
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,320
It's not multiple tracks.

1123
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,800
It's just one track, but you're kind of going down this wire.

1124
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:40,720
And instead of moving left or right, you're rotating around the tube left or right to

1125
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,480
hit different things in there.

1126
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,120
Sounds almost like that spin rhythm game that they have.

1127
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:49,360
Maybe a little, but then at certain parts, your ship kind of takes off.

1128
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:52,720
Like when there's an instrumental break, your ship might take off.

1129
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:58,320
And then you're flying your ship through these holes, like a star Fox type game, basically.

1130
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,160
So it's like amplitude meets star Fox.

1131
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,040
I'm serious.

1132
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:05,440
And then you actually are flying through the circles in rhythm with the music as well.

1133
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,360
And so I thought that was kind of neat and I have to be on, I'm going to be completely

1134
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,240
blunt.

1135
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:14,640
This game is what I was hoping amplitude on PlayStation four was going to be.

1136
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:15,200
It's better.

1137
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:16,560
It really is.

1138
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:23,920
And I was surprised because usually you kind of go, Oh, it's a music game dedicated to

1139
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:24,960
one artist.

1140
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,960
It's probably a cash in.

1141
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,360
It probably isn't going to be that well thought out.

1142
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,720
I was totally wrong.

1143
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,640
It's, it's a well done music game.

1144
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:39,040
My only maybe like minor criticism is that it can be really hard to see which I'm playing

1145
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:43,600
on the PlayStation version and it can be really hard to see like what button you got to press

1146
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,240
because the way the arrows are kind of shaped is a little funky.

1147
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,160
I wish you could kind of change that.

1148
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:52,080
And especially when you're traveling through the wire, it does these really cool visual

1149
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:55,760
effects where you're kind of going uphill, downhill, uphill, kind of like, um, what's

1150
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:56,560
that other music game?

1151
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:57,200
Thumper.

1152
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,720
Thumper does that too, right?

1153
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:02,800
But it can be hard to see what's coming up if you're going uphill and downhill.

1154
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:07,120
And so, I mean, I guess that's part of the game design and part of the challenge.

1155
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:11,520
I wish you could kind of chill that out just a little bit, but that is my minor criticism

1156
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,320
on what's otherwise a really fun music game in my opinion.

1157
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:18,320
So, uh, VidPower573 in chat says, I've played Avicii and Vector.

1158
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,840
I really, really liked the music.

1159
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:20,080
Yeah.

1160
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:23,680
I was, you know, being a music game fan, I, I wanted to check it out and I was really

1161
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:24,720
surprised how much I liked it.

1162
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,760
Again, I was expecting it like a cheap title.

1163
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:32,480
You know, I guess though, um, like SingStar Queen and SingStar Abba, those were based

1164
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,800
on one musician and they turned out pretty good.

1165
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,400
So there's that.

1166
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,360
Um, ActDef says, I really want to try that game.

1167
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:40,160
Well, good news.

1168
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,360
There's a demo out.

1169
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:45,680
I know the Switch has a demo and I can't imagine it's not on PlayStation and Xbox as

1170
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,080
well.

1171
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:49,040
And it has two tracks in it that you can just check out.

1172
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,560
So there you go.

1173
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:51,120
Go for it.

1174
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:53,360
So, all right.

1175
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:57,360
Um, that was Avicii and Vector and that's it for my gaming week.

1176
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,120
So lots of games.

1177
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,760
Let's get into, um, some other gaming news then.

1178
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,320
We've been talking a lot here at the top of the show, but we have some other news we want

1179
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:04,880
to get into.

1180
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,640
So we will start off with Loki.

1181
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:08,320
Yes.

1182
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:12,160
So as we've been hinting at, there's the PlayStation showcase.

1183
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,560
It's just going to be on September 16th.

1184
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:18,640
That's supposed to, they better goddamn unveil the price at this point.

1185
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:26,000
Uh, it's supposed to unveil the price of the PlayStation 5 and, um, you know, what's going

1186
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,040
to be, I guess when it's coming out and that type of stuff.

1187
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:32,240
So, um, supposed to be 40 minutes long.

1188
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:36,640
It's going to air at, uh, 1 PM Pacific time, September 16th.

1189
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:42,880
And yeah, so I guess we'll have to wait and see what they have to announce there.

1190
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:49,520
Um, I know that as we've been kind of frustrated this week with the whole kind of plain chicken

1191
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:54,400
with announcing pricing and stuff like that, and I'm sure that leaks didn't help with that.

1192
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:59,680
I'm curious to see what they respond with if they're going to try to price themselves

1193
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:00,560
lower.

1194
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:05,760
Um, the rumor is that they might not be lower than $4.99 because they're charging a premium

1195
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:06,320
on their system.

1196
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:13,120
Um, I just hope for their sake, it's not $599 because all the means will come back, but

1197
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,240
uh, we'll see.

1198
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:19,520
I mean, I'm curious, like, I don't know, like I've been kind of, you know, pro PlayStation

1199
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:24,160
last generation just with, you know, the con that was the only console I has visited for.

1200
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:30,960
Um, and even like this coming up generation, like I have a nicer laptop that could run

1201
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,680
probably a lot of those games in decent settings.

1202
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,400
But I don't know.

1203
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,720
I still kind of want an Xbox series X.

1204
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:42,640
Um, I am curious to see though what exclusives each are going to have.

1205
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:48,480
Um, I know obviously launch is going to be kind of all over the place, but, um, I don't

1206
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:48,980
know.

1207
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:53,200
Yeah, I, I'm, I'm very curious to see what they announced.

1208
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:58,480
Like obviously I said before, I'm leaning towards Xbox series X, but I'm well aware.

1209
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,320
I know more about that console right now.

1210
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:03,120
There could still be some surprises in for PlayStation five.

1211
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:07,600
If Sony announces we got silent Hill and it's out this year, like that is going to

1212
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:11,600
be a very hard thing for me to resist a very, very hard thing for me to resist.

1213
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,680
So I might end up kind of tilting.

1214
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,560
Um, so there's still some things that could, it could make you want to get a PlayStation

1215
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:17,920
five this year for sure.

1216
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,480
So I'm really excited to see what they're going to talk about, what they're going to

1217
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:20,880
announce.

1218
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,520
I fully expect the price to be four 99.

1219
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,800
I just feel like it's kind of a different ball game this time.

1220
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:30,400
We had that complication last time when we were talking about PlayStation four and Xbox

1221
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:35,280
one where Microsoft under different leadership was convinced they needed to bundle the connect

1222
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:35,840
in.

1223
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:38,160
And, you know, some people were in favor of that.

1224
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,200
Some people weren't.

1225
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,000
It is what it is.

1226
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:40,400
That's good.

1227
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,000
That's not a factor this time around.

1228
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,800
So I think because that's kind of out, I think you are looking at two very similar systems.

1229
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:50,240
And so I think you're going to be looking at similar prices and I fully expect PlayStation

1230
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,240
five to clock in at four 99.

1231
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:58,240
I also realized cause, um, in, um, on social media, some folks were saying, well, Sony

1232
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,960
doesn't have to announce the price and date.

1233
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:05,120
They don't, they can do whatever the fuck they like, but I think the pressure is not

1234
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:06,640
like they would be foolish not to.

1235
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:12,320
And I will say this, I would argue, yes, they do have to announce the price and date before

1236
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:19,520
September 22nd, because what happens on the 22nd pre-orders for Xbox series X start.

1237
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:24,240
And because, because I mean, if they're not launching this year, then that's gonna kind

1238
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:24,800
of hurt them.

1239
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:31,600
I mean, um, you don't, you don't have to do anything besides die and pay taxes.

1240
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:36,000
And if you're lucky, you might be able to cheat death, but I do think so.

1241
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,080
Sony is under a lot of pressure.

1242
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,000
Like it kind of has to come out this week.

1243
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,960
It would be very, very foolish.

1244
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:47,360
And I think they will take a lashing, not just on social media, but they will take a

1245
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:52,800
lashing from investors, uh, and that audience, if they do not succumb to the pressure to

1246
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,480
put their cards on the table this week.

1247
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,840
So color me shocked if they don't price and date that thing this week.

1248
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:02,800
I would think that they would have to, um, I don't know.

1249
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:07,040
I'm just curious to see, you know, what, what each console has to offer.

1250
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:07,680
Like, I don't know.

1251
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:08,560
I don't like playing this.

1252
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,280
Like everyone wants to pick a team.

1253
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:12,000
I don't really care.

1254
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:17,680
I don't care who the team is because it's just, it's games at the end of the day.

1255
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:22,320
Kind of what I was getting at earlier is that, you know, there are things about all the gaming

1256
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:23,760
companies that I love.

1257
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:26,960
There are things about all the gaming companies that I don't love.

1258
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,800
It is okay to root for everybody.

1259
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:33,520
And even though I'm sitting here saying right now, my brain is kind of tilting like Microsoft

1260
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:38,240
this holiday, that doesn't mean I'm writing PlayStation five off for the entire generation.

1261
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,000
That is completely not the case.

1262
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,400
I fully expect I'll end up getting one next year.

1263
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:47,600
Um, and like I said, a million times now, Sony could still definitely announce something

1264
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,400
for this holiday.

1265
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,160
That'll make me go, shit.

1266
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,760
I have to have that now.

1267
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:57,440
And we're going to be having a different conversation, but, but like, I doubt that that's

1268
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,400
going to, I don't think we would get like a silent Hill this year or anything.

1269
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,200
If they announced that they're working on something like that, it would probably be

1270
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,000
next year.

1271
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:10,560
And a lot of that stuff, like I just, I don't know, like I can wait on that stuff.

1272
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:15,040
I guess if there's something that's really big, like I'm like, I'm excited about obsidian's

1273
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:16,720
new RPG that they have coming out.

1274
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:17,040
Oh yeah.

1275
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:17,600
That looks good.

1276
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,520
That's not anytime soon.

1277
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,480
I mean, but I know that's coming at some point.

1278
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:26,160
Um, but it's just also like, there's also the, all the game pass stuff.

1279
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:31,520
Like there's a whole library of Xbox games that I haven't played yet, um, that I could

1280
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,640
play on this console.

1281
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:36,320
Like, so I'm going to be busy with all that stuff for a very long time.

1282
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:39,680
Plus I still have my library of PlayStation four stuff that all these games I've purchased,

1283
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:44,960
like the final fantasy seven remake or final fantasy 15 or kingdom hearts three all spring

1284
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:49,040
except it's kind of odd, uh, just cause for like all this stuff I can go back and play.

1285
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:52,160
But if I was in the opposite position than I really am.

1286
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:56,880
And if I was in the opposite position where I had a gen one PlayStation four, you know,

1287
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:02,160
basically early release PlayStation four and an Xbox series X, my brain might be thinking

1288
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:06,720
I need to get PlayStation five because even if I have a large library of PlayStation four

1289
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:10,640
games left to play, we know that PlayStation five is going to have the SSD drive.

1290
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:11,760
Those games are going to run better.

1291
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,600
It's going to carry over those enhancements from the pro things will look better.

1292
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:19,520
So I might, I might've answered this question differently if I didn't,

1293
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,680
if I had a different configuration today in my own home.

1294
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,880
And how are they treating like PlayStation four games?

1295
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,680
Is the PlayStation five going to be playing PlayStation four games?

1296
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:30,160
I think, how's that working with my library and stuff?

1297
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,560
Like if I have all my games there, how's that work?

1298
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,000
And they, are they going to be upscaled?

1299
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,200
I mean like that, I need all these kind of like questions answered.

1300
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:43,760
Yeah, I think they've given a vague yes because they've demonstrated Spiderman on

1301
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,760
PlayStation four runs better on five.

1302
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,280
So they have addressed it.

1303
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:50,640
And you know, there was that whole Mark Cerny talk where then PlayStation kind of had to

1304
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,640
correct it and say, it's going to be more than just a hundred games.

1305
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:53,280
Don't worry.

1306
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,320
But I do agree.

1307
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:58,560
It would be very nice for Sony to answer the question very fucking clearly.

1308
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,320
How does backwards compatibility work?

1309
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,560
And I fully expect if the answer is it doesn't, they're going to, when it comes to PlayStation

1310
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:11,040
three, two, and one, I would love for, I would love for them to go the other way.

1311
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,600
And that would be soft leak on that, but I'm prepared for it.

1312
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,600
They'll probably dance around it.

1313
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,760
If they, if they don't say it, it's not happening.

1314
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:20,240
All right.

1315
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,480
Well, we'll wait and see later this week.

1316
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:23,120
Yes, we will.

1317
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:23,760
We sure will.

1318
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:28,880
DJ Rama S says there has been talk that PlayStation five won't be backwards compatible with a

1319
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,240
lot of PlayStation four games.

1320
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:30,960
Hmm.

1321
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,240
Who, who's saying that?

1322
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:34,640
What, what official channel is saying that?

1323
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:41,120
I think what is happening, that is a misinterpretation of the Mark Cerny talk where he said they're

1324
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:47,040
working on the top 100 games, but Sony did correct that and say it will be many more,

1325
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:51,600
which to be fair, that is exactly what happened when the Xbox three, no, I'm sorry.

1326
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,480
The Xbox one started backwards compatibility.

1327
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,880
The Xbox three 60 games, they were working on the largest titles and then it had the

1328
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:03,360
side effect of, Oh, but these other titles work too by getting halo three to work.

1329
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:04,000
Oh, guess what?

1330
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,320
That made Barbie horse adventures work too.

1331
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,920
That wasn't on our radar, but cool.

1332
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:08,880
We'll add it to the list.

1333
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:13,520
And that's, that's how backwards compatibility worked over there, but I'm, I'm kind of with

1334
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,400
She-Hulk 10, keep your PlayStation three in good shape.

1335
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:20,720
Cause sadly, I don't think that I, and it should be, but that's, that's a whole nother

1336
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:21,200
thing.

1337
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:21,440
All right.

1338
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,800
Anyway, we're going to move on.

1339
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,400
Let's go back and talk about game pass for a minute because another thing that came out

1340
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:30,560
this week for Microsoft's camp, some of you guys were yelling this out in chat earlier,

1341
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:34,320
but yes, uh, Xbox game pass is going to be getting a big edition.

1342
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:38,480
EA play is going to be baked into Xbox game pass.

1343
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:39,200
It's still good.

1344
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,920
I shouldn't, I shouldn't phrase it that way because it's still going to be a separate

1345
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:47,600
service, but basically as a game pass member, you will have access to the entry level of

1346
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,640
EA play.

1347
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:53,120
I want to point out EA play has like a basic level and an ultimate level.

1348
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:57,040
The ultimate level is the one where I think you get demos of free games or demos of upcoming

1349
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,240
games and stuff like that.

1350
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:59,520
That is not what you're getting for free.

1351
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:07,120
Based when you get the demos, I think, I think, um, the pro one, you get like the actual games

1352
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:12,400
like games pass does, but I think the, the base one, you get like 10 hours of brand new

1353
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:18,960
games when they come out, uh, 10 hour demos, but then, um, you get libraries of older games,

1354
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,880
you know, for free that's included with it.

1355
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:21,120
Yeah.

1356
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:26,000
So, but that is still going to really ramp up the amount of games playable on game pass.

1357
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,520
And that's a pretty big deal.

1358
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:31,280
So it didn't start yet, but it's going to start this holiday.

1359
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:35,120
So I would imagine around the time of the release of the consoles probably, uh, and

1360
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:39,120
you're going to get the EA play, which used to be called EA access, which used to be called

1361
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,080
origin access.

1362
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,880
They've had some troubles branding themselves.

1363
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,760
Um, and that's going to be basically baked into it.

1364
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:52,720
You do have to have game pass ultimate or game pass PC, but I think, wait, I'm sorry.

1365
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:57,120
I miss, do you, can you have just playing game pass Xbox and get this?

1366
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,040
I don't know.

1367
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:01,520
Or is it?

1368
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:02,880
Yeah, this is okay.

1369
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:03,280
Yeah.

1370
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:07,120
Microsoft confirmed the game pass ultimate and PC subscribers.

1371
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:10,080
So ultimate is both and PC is just PC.

1372
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:13,120
So it is not saying anything about just having the Xbox version.

1373
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:19,120
So I don't read the fine print, but I don't know about you guys.

1374
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:22,320
I have the ultimate, so I know this is going to be coming with it.

1375
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,080
Not that there's a lot of EA games.

1376
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:30,240
I get super thrilled about, but, um, if it's true that EA is going to be putting out a

1377
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,600
mass effect remaster.

1378
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:36,720
And if that is a part of this service, I'll be very happy about that.

1379
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:37,920
That's for sure.

1380
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,600
Um, and you know what?

1381
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:44,160
Maybe I would try more things like NHL and some of the sports products.

1382
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:48,400
If I didn't have to pay 60 bucks for them, I might be inclined to try some of these sports

1383
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:48,720
games.

1384
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:52,800
I otherwise don't usually look at game pass has challenged me to play more games.

1385
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,320
I might not usually play.

1386
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,360
So there is that.

1387
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:57,840
So, all right.

1388
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,080
S2100 Matt says, be still my heart, Rob.

1389
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:01,360
Well, why wouldn't I?

1390
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,880
I'm already paying for game pass.

1391
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,520
So if I can try out the NHL game for free, why wouldn't I?

1392
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,000
Free, using my quotey fingers.

1393
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,560
Questbuster says, Mirror's Edge is really good.

1394
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,480
Yeah, that would be another one that would be in the library.

1395
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:13,360
So neat.

1396
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:14,960
All right, let's move on.

1397
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:17,040
How about something from Nintendo's camp, DarkSakura?

1398
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:22,960
Yes, stuff from Nintendo, which is actually pretty, pretty cool.

1399
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:27,120
Um, I actually missed the first Hyrule Warriors and I really wanted to play it because I wanted

1400
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:30,080
just to play around as Linkle because she was cute.

1401
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:38,320
But Nintendo of America did announce recently that there's going to be a new Hyrule Warriors

1402
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:45,280
being worked on by Koei Tecmo and Nintendo and it's Hyrule Warriors Age of Calamity.

1403
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,240
It should be out on November 20th of this year.

1404
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:55,680
And it's set right before the 100 years before the events of Legend of Zelda Breath of the

1405
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:56,180
Wild.

1406
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:03,280
So you basically are playing the active participants that you're seeing through all these

1407
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:08,640
flashbacks, all the, the, the, uh, the, the heroes that we're working with, Lincoln,

1408
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:11,440
Zelda, the champions, um, you get to play with them.

1409
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,200
Zelda will be playable.

1410
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,040
She apparently gets to use the Sheikah Slate.

1411
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:17,760
Um, you know, stuff like that.

1412
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:22,240
And so the thing that I'm actually interested in for this is just having like hopefully

1413
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:25,520
a little bit more lore because I love the universe of Breath of the Wild.

1414
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:31,840
Um, and, uh, looking at some of the promotional artwork for it, it actually just very gorgeous.

1415
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:36,240
It has the same overall animation style that Breath of the Wild does.

1416
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:38,560
And I think it's going to be a fantastic tie-in.

1417
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:39,060
Yeah.

1418
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:44,320
You know, this isn't technically a first party release, but it feels like it because it's

1419
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,280
a Zelda game.

1420
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:49,520
And I think this is a very smart thing for Nintendo to be pushing this holiday, uh, between

1421
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:52,320
this and the Mario Kart, uh, real life thing.

1422
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:57,040
Uh, I think that's a pretty strong holiday lineup when we were expecting this year to

1423
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,280
be pretty quiet due to COVID and so forth.

1424
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:03,120
And we've kind of been getting that sense that Nintendo maybe has been challenged with

1425
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,960
this situation more than anybody else, just because of how silent they've been.

1426
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:10,000
But I think this new Hyrule Warriors is really exciting.

1427
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,720
And, and Jamie, I, I would loan you the first game.

1428
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,080
I think I've got to have it somewhere.

1429
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,440
I don't think I bought it digitally.

1430
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,920
I think I do have it on cart, uh, and I would loan it to you.

1431
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:18,880
It's a fabulous game.

1432
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,200
I would, I'd be happy to play it.

1433
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:24,480
I mean, Dan and I could play it together, but you know, right now, what happens with

1434
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:25,360
games that I borrowed?

1435
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:26,720
Yeah.

1436
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:27,760
They get animal crossed.

1437
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,160
Well, maybe this will be something that can be a distraction for a couple of days.

1438
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:37,440
Cause the, the lawyers, I still need to get back into last of us, but, um, but yeah, I,

1439
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:41,040
I would be happy, happy to borrow it when we have a day that isn't on fire.

1440
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:41,440
Yeah.

1441
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:41,680
Right.

1442
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:43,360
Hopefully that'll do.

1443
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:46,720
Weren't they saying it might rain in Oregon next, next week?

1444
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,080
Hopefully I hope that's true.

1445
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:48,800
I really hope so.

1446
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:55,280
But, but, um, but who knows, maybe someone in my house will take another stop by a local

1447
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,040
C's candy and share the goodness.

1448
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:58,420
Excellent.

1449
01:18:59,120 --> 01:18:59,840
All right.

1450
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:04,160
Uh, well, let's move on while we, well, actually I quickly Loki, just a pulse check on you.

1451
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,600
What's your thought with Hyrule warriors?

1452
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,160
Um, I do want to get it.

1453
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:13,360
My least my, I showed it to my, my son who's been playing, uh, through breath of the wild

1454
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:15,040
and he's like, we got to get that.

1455
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:15,360
Yeah.

1456
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:19,200
I think, I think this might be a three for three type of situation.

1457
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:24,160
Cause I think this is one where even though I wasn't so hot on the 3d all stars, I, I'm,

1458
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,080
I was a fan of the first Hyrule warriors game.

1459
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:30,080
It always impressed me just how many characters are in that game.

1460
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:33,040
You play, it's like 15 different people.

1461
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,480
And I'm like, who the fuck is this?

1462
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,200
I was always on the fence about buying it.

1463
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:41,040
Like I almost said, purchase it so many times, but I just never did.

1464
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,760
Um, so I may have to do it now.

1465
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,800
May have to get the new one and then may go back to the old one as well.

1466
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:51,680
Um, Bobby black Wolf and chat says I'd rather see persona five scramble

1467
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:55,200
than a Hyrule warriors TBH, both muscle games.

1468
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:58,880
Um, yeah, these, these, uh, which is, uh, dynasty warriors, right.

1469
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,680
It's basically what all these games are based on essentially.

1470
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:02,320
Yes.

1471
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:06,480
Um, yes, there is that persona when there was another one, not that long ago too.

1472
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,440
That was like a dynasty warriors S type of game.

1473
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,600
Um, damn, I can't remember somebody in chat.

1474
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:12,640
Maybe we'll yell it out.

1475
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:16,800
Um, but I remember, I remember playing 99 nights on Xbox 360 and thinking that

1476
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,760
was much better than most people gave it fire emblem.

1477
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:20,240
Thank you.

1478
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:23,840
It's fire emblem warriors, but DJ Rama says it was horrible.

1479
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:28,000
So that was the other one I was trying to think of.

1480
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:28,480
All right.

1481
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,480
Uh, let's move on more Nintendo news.

1482
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:30,980
Loki.

1483
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:32,480
Yes.

1484
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:35,840
Um, so there's been a rumor for a while now that there's going to be some sort

1485
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,080
of switch pro or something coming out.

1486
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,160
Um, and that's still a thing.

1487
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:44,320
Apparently though, there's more rumors that there is going to be an upgraded

1488
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,720
switch model coming out in 2021.

1489
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:51,760
And along with that, apparently Nintendo started asking some of the, uh, game

1490
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:56,160
developer studios out there to start making switch games 4k ready.

1491
01:20:56,640 --> 01:21:01,760
So I think the rumor is that it's going to be a, some sort of upgraded switch.

1492
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,920
That's going to be able to output the 4k.

1493
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:08,400
Um, not sure if that necessarily means that they're going to have older titles

1494
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:14,800
as well, but you know, maybe we'll get some sort of news about this in the

1495
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:15,600
next few months.

1496
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:19,520
Um, maybe this coincides with that March 31st date.

1497
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:23,680
Maybe there's a whole reason why those digital games aren't available after

1498
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:24,180
that.

1499
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,720
Maybe a new system's coming out.

1500
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:27,280
We'll see.

1501
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,840
I guess we'll wait until then take.

1502
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:33,600
Now I'm just, that would be very interesting if that is the reason why these

1503
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,320
games are suddenly unavailable has to do with some type of new system.

1504
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:39,280
But again, I'm not sure logically why that would be the case, especially if

1505
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:43,600
this is supposed to be like a switch pro, but yeah, it wouldn't be.

1506
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,960
I, yeah, I can't imagine that that would be the case.

1507
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,520
It's probably just, I don't know.

1508
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,320
I don't know why you would make a digital game available for a limited

1509
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:52,820
amount of time.

1510
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,200
I don't know, but I guess we'll find out.

1511
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,080
I don't know, but I guess we'll find out.

1512
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,080
I'm waiting to hear more news about that.

1513
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,480
Um, I would like a switch pro.

1514
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:09,680
So I actually have a switch I can play because the rest of my family has mine.

1515
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:13,760
Um, but yeah, I mean, it'd be interesting to see what they do with that.

1516
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,360
I'm excited for a Mario game.

1517
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,600
I'm excited at the prospect of them going to 4k.

1518
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,680
One other thing I have to worry about buying this holiday is a 4k TV.

1519
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:26,400
Let me ask you nerds in chat and you nerds here in the, in the room.

1520
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:30,640
I'm, uh, you know, obviously we've all seen there are super cheap 4k TVs right now, right?

1521
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:36,800
Like I can get a 4k TV for $399 or $499, but it's come to my attention that I should really

1522
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:42,320
look into either the OLED or whatever Samsung's version of that is called.

1523
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:46,080
They have something different, but I think I'm right now leaning towards the OLED.

1524
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:50,240
That is like a $1,400 TV, but damn, it looks good.

1525
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:54,400
Like I saw it in the store at like Costco and I saw another one at Target and I was

1526
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,680
like, this looks good.

1527
01:22:55,680 --> 01:23:00,400
And I'm trying to future proof my TV a little bit because the problem with the TV I have

1528
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,320
now, a it's not 4k.

1529
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:05,280
B I bought it right before HDR became a thing.

1530
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,120
So my TV doesn't even have HDR.

1531
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:10,320
So it kind of pissed me off when that started taking off because I dropped quite a bit of

1532
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,360
money on that old TV.

1533
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:16,240
So my question to you guys in chat room is, should I just buy the cheap TV to get it done

1534
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:16,640
with?

1535
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:22,640
Or if I have a nice, if we've been really good at saving this year and you might be

1536
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:26,560
thinking like, Rob, you're talking about buying a PlayStation or Xbox, a TV, that's

1537
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:27,440
a lot of money.

1538
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:33,360
Well, I didn't go to any conventions this year, so that has saved quite a bit of money.

1539
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:39,200
So you know, and there's been, I've been very fortunate with circumstances in my day job

1540
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,160
and stuff like that.

1541
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:43,200
So should I just invest and get that better TV?

1542
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:46,480
Cause I feel, or what seems like a better TV or is it better?

1543
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,600
Because it seems like it might be so.

1544
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:52,240
It depends what you're looking for.

1545
01:23:52,560 --> 01:24:01,040
Really a lot of those, it comes down to like, even just like contrast, HDR, what type of

1546
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,720
features you want in it and stuff.

1547
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:05,040
Just watch a lot of TV reviews out there.

1548
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,360
I mean, even some of the cheaper TVs aren't so bad.

1549
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:12,480
I have a not too expensive TCL TV and it's fine.

1550
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:15,200
It's 4K and it seems okay.

1551
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:20,000
It's just, if you're really like a video file or something, you may want it a little higher

1552
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,320
end, but I wouldn't spend like, I don't think you necessarily need to spend $1,400.

1553
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:26,560
It depends on how big of a TV you want.

1554
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,400
55 inch is what I was looking at.

1555
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:29,280
Oh, then yeah.

1556
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:30,800
Oh God, no, you probably wouldn't.

1557
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:35,200
I think we just bought, we bought a really large one for my mother-in-law that was like,

1558
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:42,000
I think it was like 600, but it was like, it was like a 60 or 70 inch TV is ridiculously

1559
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:42,320
huge.

1560
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,600
I mean, that TV looks huge.

1561
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:48,160
But so just make sure that the latency on it is low.

1562
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,240
That's definitely important.

1563
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:52,000
A lot of TVs are pretty good about that now.

1564
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,320
Yeah, sure.

1565
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:56,720
Real quick.

1566
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:57,200
Sorry.

1567
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,520
Bonds 006 says OLED and QLED.

1568
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,720
You can't lose going with either one.

1569
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:02,960
It's QLED was the Samsung one I couldn't think of.

1570
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:03,440
Sorry guys.

1571
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:03,940
Thank you.

1572
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:09,600
Tiger Claw says if you care about 120 frames per second, then you would need to get a 4K

1573
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:12,080
that has the HDMI 2.1 inputs.

1574
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,320
Those TV are 120 megahertz.

1575
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:18,720
So I think he's kind of giving me a hint at how to future proof because 120 frames a second

1576
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,520
is where things are going.

1577
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,280
It sounds like it is.

1578
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:24,320
S2100 Matt says I could get a 55 inch under 1K.

1579
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:27,280
I could, but can I get an OLED QLED under 1K?

1580
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,120
Actually, I think a QLED is under 1K.

1581
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:34,480
And then some folks saying best time to buy a TV is November.

1582
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:34,960
Yes.

1583
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,640
A few shout outs for Costco.

1584
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,000
That's actually what we were looking at.

1585
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,600
Something else that's happened during all this.

1586
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:44,080
We haven't had a Costco membership ever, but Alan finally jumped the shark and got

1587
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:44,720
one.

1588
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:47,520
So we probably will get from them.

1589
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:49,360
And that's what I've been kind of pricing with.

1590
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,160
So we'll see.

1591
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:50,660
We'll see.

1592
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:51,620
All right.

1593
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,520
Anyway, let's move on.

1594
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:56,000
I want to move on and get to some more stories here.

1595
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Let's get to a story on an old classic, which is funny because this is a game that I feel

1596
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:08,160
like is going to be 120 frames a second and 4K and all this stuff when it's Minecraft.

1597
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:10,960
But Minecraft is getting...

1598
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,080
Hello Minecraft.

1599
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:12,720
I know.

1600
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,120
But hey, it's a solid game.

1601
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:20,720
There's a reason it's lasted this long and it's moving into another new thing.

1602
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:22,560
And that is PSVR.

1603
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:23,040
That's right.

1604
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:28,240
PlayStation VR is going to be getting a VR version of Minecraft, which when you consider

1605
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:32,000
that Minecraft is a Microsoft's own thing, it is.

1606
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,720
Of course, Minecraft has existed on PlayStation, but you were kind of getting the sense that

1607
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,760
it was PlayStation was kind of supported second.

1608
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:45,440
So it's interesting that I think that the PlayStation VR is getting a version of it

1609
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:48,800
because they really could have probably skipped it and no one would have cared.

1610
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,600
This is not a new game.

1611
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:56,720
If you own existing Minecraft on PlayStation, you will be given the VR patch for free.

1612
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:58,000
So that's pretty cool.

1613
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,840
We don't know what the date is, though.

1614
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:04,080
There will be two modes for the VR, immersive and living room.

1615
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,240
But they don't say how that works.

1616
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,280
My thought is...

1617
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:08,560
I can tell you how it works.

1618
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:09,920
Can I say my guess?

1619
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:16,000
It's going to be like No Man's Sky, where one mode you can use your D-pad to move around

1620
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,200
in full 3D.

1621
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:20,400
And that's for people that want to have the full VR immersion.

1622
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:25,200
The other mode is for people that maybe don't do so well with VR and need to take it a little

1623
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:25,760
easier.

1624
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,160
And that's where you kind of project yourself forward.

1625
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:30,720
You're not actually having the full motion.

1626
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:33,760
You're moving like it's a game board.

1627
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:36,160
You're moving a couple squares ahead at a time or a couple squares left.

1628
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:36,960
That's my guess.

1629
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,840
You're close.

1630
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:43,840
The way it works is the living room mode is basically a virtual VR living room that you're

1631
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,160
literally playing it on a virtual screen.

1632
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,240
So it's just 2D Minecraft in VR.

1633
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,280
It's like a VR living room.

1634
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,920
Immersive is actually in VR.

1635
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:57,680
So the way they have Minecraft, you can actually do two modes.

1636
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:58,080
They have...

1637
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:03,600
There's a motion mode where you can move with just the controller and move around and everything

1638
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:04,240
independently.

1639
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:07,040
And I think there's also a teleportation option as well.

1640
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,640
When I was doing it on Gear VR, it was with just like actually moving around and stuff.

1641
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:13,280
And it was all right.

1642
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,920
I didn't feel like really sick from it or anything.

1643
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,760
And it worked fine on the Gear VR.

1644
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:18,880
I think that's also how they work.

1645
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:23,760
The mixed reality version on Windows 10 works as well as like that.

1646
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,160
So it'd be kind of curious to see...

1647
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:30,880
I'll definitely play it again because it was fun while I did it.

1648
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:36,080
But with the Gear VR is kind of hard to play that for a very long time.

1649
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:41,840
I still got to figure out how to do that with the rip desk right now on the...

1650
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,080
Because I have the Windows 10 version, so I should be able to do that.

1651
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:47,440
I just haven't figured out how to do the VR part on that.

1652
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:49,120
Yeah.

1653
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:52,160
And I didn't even realize the Gear VR version was a thing.

1654
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,800
So I guess they already have a VR...

1655
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:59,840
So maybe it wasn't as much of an investment to make the PlayStation VR version work.

1656
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:04,160
It's probably some type of adaptation of the Gear VR version.

1657
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:06,640
Maybe not literally, but I'm sure a lot of the code that made the

1658
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:09,120
Gear VR work is making PlayStation VR work.

1659
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:09,920
Right.

1660
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:13,200
Because basically those versions were all based off of Pocket Edition,

1661
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:14,960
which is now what Bedrock is.

1662
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,440
And that's the ones on all the other platforms.

1663
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:20,080
So it's easier for them to develop for that now.

1664
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:21,200
It's not straight Java.

1665
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,480
I mean, it's probably one of those things I'll try once and go, huh, interesting.

1666
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:27,600
And then never do again.

1667
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,680
That's kind of what I was with No Man's Sky.

1668
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:32,080
I love No Man's Sky and it is gorgeous in VR.

1669
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:35,120
I just can't play it in VR for very long because I just get really like,

1670
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:38,560
this is too much sensory overload.

1671
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:42,960
But that's why I think VR is very much like cell phones for me.

1672
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:48,560
Games that are designed with it in mind are always better than the other games

1673
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:51,680
that kind of like have VR injected into it.

1674
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:52,400
You know what I mean?

1675
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:53,840
Beat Saber, fun.

1676
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,680
Tetris Effect, fun.

1677
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:00,880
But these games that kind of inject it after the fact,

1678
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:03,360
like No Man's Sky is kind of like, oh, okay.

1679
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:06,240
That's kind of how I feel about it.

1680
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:07,840
All right.

1681
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:09,200
Let's move on.

1682
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:12,080
We have a few more stories for you guys.

1683
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:12,800
Dark Sakura.

1684
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:13,680
This is kind of a neat one.

1685
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:15,760
Yeah.

1686
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:19,680
I came across this one and actually posted it in my Animal Crossing community.

1687
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:21,840
I run on Facebook, but I thought it was really great.

1688
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:25,440
And I'm going to start off by saying how much I love and support the Trevor Project.

1689
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:33,040
They are for suicide prevention for LGBTQA plus youth, and they do some amazing stuff.

1690
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:38,000
Their website is thetrevorproject.org.

1691
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:44,480
But at any rate, they have released Animal Crossing clothes to help prevent youth suicide.

1692
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:50,320
Basically just to bring awareness out there and put out the colors for the Trevor Project and offer

1693
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:56,640
just a way to keep that awareness going by using their branding.

1694
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:07,440
I mean, it was actually stated from a Nielsen survey that 10% of all gamers over 18 identify

1695
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:16,400
under the rainbow and that they spend more on games than peers in similar age groups.

1696
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:22,080
So if you want a little bit more about, you know,

1697
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:26,560
helping to, you know, downloading the items first of all,

1698
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:32,320
but then going in a little bit more for helping youth with their charity.

1699
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:44,560
The creator code is M like Mike, A like Alpha 724817021536.

1700
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:48,320
And you can access by searching the custom design portal inside the Able Sisters.

1701
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:53,280
And the items will all say TRVR.

1702
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:58,160
So Tango, Romeo, Victor, Romeo, Cap or overalls or whatever.

1703
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:03,840
And then if you want a little bit more, you can also go to trvr.org slash care,

1704
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,400
C-A-R-E, Charlie Alpha Romeo Echo.

1705
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,600
But I love that they're doing this.

1706
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,640
I love that they're reaching out to the community to do this.

1707
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:14,720
And I'm going to share the link in the chat room.

1708
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:17,520
I think that's a great thing.

1709
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:23,360
And it's a great charity because, you know, this these times are really difficult, you know,

1710
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:26,320
with the pandemic going on and the fires and just everything.

1711
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:30,080
There's so much and the social justice movement, everything.

1712
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,680
There's a lot of stuff going on right now.

1713
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:39,040
And it can really cause people to, you know, have some really bad mental health days like I

1714
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,720
and I've been very open about this on Twitter.

1715
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:44,720
There's been some days lately where I'm just like, I'm not I'm not having a good day today.

1716
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:45,840
I just I'm not.

1717
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:48,400
And it's just that constant like, I can't go anywhere.

1718
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,680
I can't do anything.

1719
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:58,240
And imagine if you are a young LGBTQ, et cetera, a young rainbow person that is stuck in a,

1720
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:05,280
we'll just say, abusive environment towards, you know, your gender identity or your sexuality

1721
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:08,000
or whatever it is in the rainbow community.

1722
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,160
Like, you know, if you are in a situation and you can't leave it because of everything

1723
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:16,960
else that's going on in the world, that can be very, very troubling for a person's mental

1724
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:17,520
health.

1725
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:21,040
So I'm glad we're taking a moment, even if it's through a video game, even as through

1726
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:25,040
a social phenomenon like Animal Crossing, to kind of bring some attention back to that

1727
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:27,040
because people be struggling right now.

1728
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:30,240
Yo, and it's and people are struggling in all sorts of different ways.

1729
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:32,400
So I agreed.

1730
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:38,320
And I mean, and I'll go ahead and I'll be a little bit more open with with this right

1731
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:48,080
now with the year that we've had with with Dan's mom and, you know, losing my dad a few

1732
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:50,560
months ago and everything else going on.

1733
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:58,480
You know, it's I'm actually having to take time off to deal with things.

1734
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:04,560
And I'm going to be going actually into some therapy myself.

1735
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,240
And I encourage everybody.

1736
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:08,240
There is no shame in seeking help.

1737
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:13,360
In fact, if you need it, please reach out to your resources.

1738
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:16,560
There are some free services out there.

1739
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:22,480
If you're a veteran, you can try to find something through the VA, you know, look to the charities

1740
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:23,120
out there.

1741
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:26,240
There are resources out there for you one way or another.

1742
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:33,920
So and just know that there's a phrase that my old manager used to have outside his his

1743
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:38,880
cube that said, be kind for everybody is fighting a hard battle.

1744
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,120
This battle is maybe very private.

1745
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:46,960
They may be very public, but everyone is struggling and we should be kind.

1746
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:52,480
And the concept of going to the doctor when you're sick is not one that you should be

1747
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:56,160
embarrassed of when it when it's, you know, you're in the hospital.

1748
01:34:56,160 --> 01:35:00,880
You have a flu or if you suspect you have covid, nobody gives that a second thought.

1749
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:01,280
Right.

1750
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:05,200
So why again, the same thing of the saying you go to the doctor when you're sick.

1751
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:08,480
Why shouldn't that apply to all types of sick?

1752
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:14,800
So well, and you know, it's like, you know, when people are like, oh, you know, I'm having

1753
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,080
a depressive episode.

1754
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,880
They're like, well, did you did you try yoga?

1755
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:21,040
Did you try eating fruit?

1756
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:22,960
You know, which I've heard everything under the sun.

1757
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,600
Well, I'm sorry about your broken leg.

1758
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,920
Did you try, you know, doing yoga with it?

1759
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:31,360
Yeah, it went through the doctor and you had it set.

1760
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:37,760
It's it's the equivalent of when I when I have a cold, I had these symptoms.

1761
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:38,560
Did you take zinc?

1762
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:47,040
Well, zinc actually does have a medically proven, but still, you understand, you get

1763
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,400
what I'm right.

1764
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:50,640
And yeah, and I'm actually going to go.

1765
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:52,240
May I tangent a little bit?

1766
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:54,080
60 seconds.

1767
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:58,320
Girl, anyway, and I'll go ahead and let everyone know this.

1768
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:04,400
I've been on medication for depression and anxiety since I was probably still a late

1769
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:05,440
teenager.

1770
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:09,600
And there's people out there like, oh, it's going to change your brain chemistry.

1771
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,680
Well, that's the fucking point.

1772
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:15,840
My brain chemistry was making it hard for me to function around other people.

1773
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:20,720
I would be dead if not for the drugs that have saved my life by improving my mental

1774
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,800
health and my ability to cope with things.

1775
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:29,360
I had years of undiagnosed autism that once I got my diagnosis, they were able to change

1776
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:34,560
my medication to tweak it to that so that it assisted with the way I function in life.

1777
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:37,840
And Rob, I think you remember when I decided to quit my meds once.

1778
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:40,800
And how insufferable I was.

1779
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:43,140
Yeah.

1780
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:48,880
Everybody, please thank Rob for his heroic sacrifice, for having experienced that.

1781
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:55,200
So none of you have to, um, but you know, just, just say right now, you know, wasn't

1782
01:36:55,200 --> 01:37:02,080
that, wasn't that a Disneyland trip when that was Disneyland and we had it out and that

1783
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:03,440
was my birthday.

1784
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:04,400
It was my birthday.

1785
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:05,200
That was a day.

1786
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:11,440
And I think the only reason I didn't kick your ass metaphorically, not, I would never

1787
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:14,720
actually, but, you know, uh, metaphorically was that it was your birthday.

1788
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:17,680
And I was like, I'm going to be very fucking polite because it's her birthday.

1789
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:19,440
Oh, then we had it out.

1790
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:23,600
And I think I went back on my meds, like the, like, right when I got back to Sacramento.

1791
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:24,100
Yeah.

1792
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:27,520
So, um, but sometimes you fight with your sisters, it happens.

1793
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:29,280
There's a little hair pulling and then you work it out.

1794
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:35,200
But, but, you know, just to, just to say, you know, the next time, and if you have ever

1795
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:39,280
said this to somebody, I hope it was so far in the past and that you've learned your lesson.

1796
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:45,280
But, um, you know, if someone's on medication at the moment, someone says, well, you should

1797
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:51,440
just try doing this, you know, holistic, blah, blah, whatever, tell them to kindly

1798
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:52,640
shut the fuck up.

1799
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:56,080
And you need to try my vagina scented candle from Goop.

1800
01:37:58,160 --> 01:37:58,720
That bitch.

1801
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:05,600
No, just, just tell them to shut the fuck up and actually talk about shit they really

1802
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:06,160
know about.

1803
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:06,660
Okay.

1804
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:07,700
That's all.

1805
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:13,120
If someone doesn't, if you have someone in your life who's suffering, offer to let them

1806
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:15,120
talk about it, but respect if they say no.

1807
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:16,240
Just let them know that you're there.

1808
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:20,720
I think I, I broke the break man in chat.

1809
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:21,920
Who's going, what the fuck?

1810
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:23,200
It's a real thing, buddy.

1811
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:25,600
Look it up or don't actually don't look it up.

1812
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:29,200
I'm coming in hot enough for one night.

1813
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:30,980
All right.

1814
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:31,940
Yes.

1815
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:33,920
Gwyneth Paltrow is crazy.

1816
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:39,040
To be fair though, she feels that it smells like flowers and stuff.

1817
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:44,800
So it doesn't actually smell like, you know, what I, what I actually love is that it's

1818
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:51,520
labeled as bougie parfumé and she wants $75 for a fucking candle.

1819
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:54,880
Like I can make a candle that smells like a twat and I can make it a lot cheaper.

1820
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:56,320
All right.

1821
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:57,680
Moving on, please.

1822
01:38:57,680 --> 01:39:02,480
Anyway, yeah, let's, let's try to get back to the good message we were trying to get

1823
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:03,280
to at the beginning.

1824
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:04,560
And that is gave.

1825
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:08,880
And some of you guys were saying this in chat as well, is that, um, you know, the way animal

1826
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,320
crossing has really kind of helped.

1827
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:14,560
Um, SHG100 Matt in chat says animal crossing came at the right time for plenty of folks

1828
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,800
who needed that escape and sense of enjoyment.

1829
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:18,400
2020 has sucked.

1830
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:22,480
Uh, DJ Rama S says, I truly love how animal crossing has been bringing so many people

1831
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:22,960
together.

1832
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:23,680
Yes, for sure.

1833
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:28,560
Oh, see, now we have pod culture saying that we should have dream merch.

1834
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:30,480
So the twat candle.

1835
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:30,720
What?

1836
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:31,680
Yes to merch.

1837
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:32,720
No to that candle.

1838
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:35,440
You want to miss, you want to Mr. Smoosh's litter box candle?

1839
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:36,960
Is that what you want, America?

1840
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:40,400
I'll make a twat candle, but twat's gonna sound, is it gonna stand for something?

1841
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:41,840
I just haven't decided what yet.

1842
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:42,340
Yeah.

1843
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:43,700
All right.

1844
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:46,900
Anyhow, candle and send it out to somebody.

1845
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:53,460
Sia Tabiri suggests stroup, drop waffles, stroup, twat waffles.

1846
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:54,180
All right.

1847
01:39:54,180 --> 01:39:54,500
Okay.

1848
01:39:55,540 --> 01:39:57,620
Moving on, please.

1849
01:39:57,620 --> 01:39:58,100
Yeah.

1850
01:39:58,100 --> 01:39:59,780
We had other big news this week.

1851
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:03,380
We had a whole third party news thing we haven't even talked about yet.

1852
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:03,540
Right?

1853
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:04,100
Logie.

1854
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:04,500
Yeah.

1855
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:04,820
Yes.

1856
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:07,940
Speaking of speaking about twats, let's talk about Ubisoft.

1857
01:40:07,940 --> 01:40:13,540
Uh, so first off, you have their CEO come out and make a separate apology video.

1858
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:20,500
Of course that wasn't part of this presentation, but he's sorry for stuff and promises that

1859
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:21,300
things will be done.

1860
01:40:22,980 --> 01:40:24,340
Let's speak louder.

1861
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:29,300
The words, my friend put your, I mean, I know they're talking about, and some of the things

1862
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:33,700
they're talking about sounds promising, so actions speak louder than words.

1863
01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:35,220
Let's let's, let's see it happen.

1864
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:36,020
Make it happen, buddy.

1865
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:36,520
Yeah.

1866
01:40:37,140 --> 01:40:42,580
But anyways, so during their Ubisoft, uh, forward showcase, they were talking about

1867
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:45,380
some new games and some older games and stuff like that.

1868
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:50,500
So some of the things that they're showing off, uh, immortals Phoenix rising, uh, got

1869
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:51,380
a release date.

1870
01:40:51,380 --> 01:40:56,980
It's now December 3rd as originally a game called gods and monsters, which looked kind

1871
01:40:56,980 --> 01:40:59,700
of interesting, sort of like a Zelda type game.

1872
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:06,100
Uh, so that's something coming out later this year, uh, a remaster, uh, Prince of Persia,

1873
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:11,300
sand of times, I guess, or I guess maybe a remake, I don't know it a remake, I guess

1874
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:13,060
that is going to be coming out at some point.

1875
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:15,060
Uh, so it's in the works.

1876
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:19,780
They announced that, uh, Sam Fisher from splinter cells is going to be coming into,

1877
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:21,860
uh, rainbow six siege.

1878
01:41:22,900 --> 01:41:26,020
Uh, finally going to be remastering and re-release.

1879
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:30,420
I don't know if it's a necessary remaster, at least re-releasing the Scott Pilgrim versus

1880
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:36,420
the world game is going to be coming back out now on PlayStation 4, Xbox one PC switch

1881
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:37,540
and stadia.

1882
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:39,380
That's coming out this holiday.

1883
01:41:39,380 --> 01:41:41,300
A lot of people really happy about that one.

1884
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:42,260
And I, I understand.

1885
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:44,100
Very cool.

1886
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:48,740
Um, Aiden Pierce is going to be back in watchdog Legion.

1887
01:41:48,740 --> 01:41:51,860
So he is from the very first watchdogs games.

1888
01:41:51,860 --> 01:41:56,100
And apparently that's only as part of their season past DLC or whatever.

1889
01:41:56,100 --> 01:41:57,940
So, uh, neat.

1890
01:41:57,940 --> 01:42:02,820
I guess if you get the DLC or the, the season pass, you also get the original game.

1891
01:42:02,820 --> 01:42:05,140
Funny enough, I actually have the original game.

1892
01:42:05,140 --> 01:42:07,300
Still haven't played it this day.

1893
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:12,100
I have it in a, in the package, but still haven't played it.

1894
01:42:12,660 --> 01:42:17,460
Um, and then of course they announced a brand new game called writers Republic, which is

1895
01:42:17,460 --> 01:42:18,660
from the makers of steep.

1896
01:42:18,660 --> 01:42:23,700
It definitely looks like steep in a lot of the sense of that game.

1897
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:28,820
Um, this is kind of more of like an extreme downhill racing game.

1898
01:42:28,820 --> 01:42:33,140
Um, almost a little bit like motor store meets deep.

1899
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:34,260
Um, I don't know.

1900
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:36,020
It's interesting.

1901
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:38,500
So that's something that's going to be coming out a little bit later.

1902
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:42,260
Uh, also from their pre-show, they are showing off some more stuff as well.

1903
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:47,300
Far cry is getting a new VR game of far cry VR dive into insanity.

1904
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:51,220
It's going to be a multiplayer game up to eight people come out in 2021.

1905
01:42:51,220 --> 01:42:57,860
They had this, uh, Damon Paris journey back in time, which is like some VR, um, Notre

1906
01:42:57,860 --> 01:42:58,260
Dame.

1907
01:42:59,380 --> 01:43:00,260
Uh, I don't know.

1908
01:43:01,780 --> 01:43:04,980
Some sort of a game in Notre Dame, right?

1909
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:06,420
Yeah.

1910
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:09,460
So it's something that's coming out, I guess, for the Oculus.

1911
01:43:09,460 --> 01:43:14,420
Um, they're showing this game roller champions, which is still coming out next year.

1912
01:43:15,060 --> 01:43:22,180
They talked about, um, this game's a monster prom is getting a SQL monster prom to monster

1913
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:28,660
camp it's in development and yeah, just more, uh, content coming to the other games to division

1914
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:31,940
two for honor crew to all getting more content.

1915
01:43:32,660 --> 01:43:33,700
So nice.

1916
01:43:34,660 --> 01:43:35,160
Yeah.

1917
01:43:36,180 --> 01:43:37,780
A lot of good, a lot of good stuff coming.

1918
01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:41,780
I mean, obviously, you know, there's very fair criticisms and how they've been responding

1919
01:43:41,780 --> 01:43:46,580
to, um, some of the criticisms out there, but from strictly a games perspective, um,

1920
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:48,820
the games are looking pretty, pretty cool out of there.

1921
01:43:48,820 --> 01:43:54,020
So, um, no one special 77 and chat says I probably won't buy the Scott Pilgrim game

1922
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:59,220
if it's sold exclusively through Uplay, maybe steam, but I prefer GOG TBH.

1923
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:03,220
I haven't heard of Ubisoft selling anything exclusively through, through Uplay.

1924
01:44:03,220 --> 01:44:05,700
I bet if they do, it won't be for very long.

1925
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:08,580
It'll probably be for the first month, but it'll be on steam.

1926
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:13,860
And probably, I don't know if I don't have they been selling stuffs, uh, through Uplay

1927
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:14,500
exclusively.

1928
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:17,860
I thought they've been, I don't know about exclusively, but they do sell things to their

1929
01:44:17,860 --> 01:44:18,420
own storefront.

1930
01:44:18,420 --> 01:44:19,060
They sure do.

1931
01:44:19,060 --> 01:44:20,900
Have they been doing stuff through Epic though?

1932
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:24,180
I can't remember if they're one of the companies that was doing stuff through Epic or if they've

1933
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:25,300
gone through steam.

1934
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:30,260
I think recently, I think both, but I could be wrong.

1935
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:31,540
It's hard to keep track these days.

1936
01:44:31,940 --> 01:44:36,340
Yeah, I don't know, but it's still exciting to see that game coming back.

1937
01:44:36,340 --> 01:44:38,260
So, um, pretty cool.

1938
01:44:38,260 --> 01:44:38,500
Yeah.

1939
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:39,460
All right.

1940
01:44:39,460 --> 01:44:43,220
Well, moving on, let's talk about, um, this is kind of neat, uh, another company, very

1941
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:46,340
different company doing kind of a collector's set.

1942
01:44:46,340 --> 01:44:50,660
So it's Annapurna Interactive and you may or may not have heard them.

1943
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:55,300
They do a lot of kind of, I guess more like artistic and indie games that are available

1944
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:58,180
on PlayStation four, um, and other systems as well.

1945
01:44:58,180 --> 01:45:01,060
I know they put games out on switch, but this collection we're talking about is for the

1946
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:02,180
PlayStation four.

1947
01:45:02,180 --> 01:45:05,780
And what's really cool about this is that Annapurna is going to be, uh, teaming up with

1948
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:11,380
I am 8-bit to do a physical PlayStation four box set with eight games.

1949
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:17,380
So it's going to include games like what remains of Edith Finch, Sayonara Wild Hearts, Donut

1950
01:45:17,380 --> 01:45:19,060
County and Outer Wilds.

1951
01:45:19,060 --> 01:45:22,420
So, you know, these are all games that they've done, but what's also really cool about this

1952
01:45:22,420 --> 01:45:28,660
is that some games have never been released on a physical format before, including Goroga

1953
01:45:28,660 --> 01:45:33,780
is one of them and Telling Lies, which I talked about on the last OLR because I just got into

1954
01:45:33,780 --> 01:45:36,180
that game a few weeks ago and I really liked it.

1955
01:45:36,180 --> 01:45:39,700
Um, and so it was very different, um, but I really liked it.

1956
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:43,300
Uh, so it's kind of neat that they're doing this box set and it looks pretty cool.

1957
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:44,900
Now it's going to set you back.

1958
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:46,980
It's $179.99.

1959
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:51,220
So 180 bucks for this, uh, with exclusive cover sheets and anything, but it is meant

1960
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:53,060
to be a collector's item.

1961
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:58,260
If you want to spend another 20 bucks, you get the deluxe PS4 limited edition with an

1962
01:45:58,260 --> 01:46:04,260
ultra premium custom designed folio package and a forward from the founder of Annapurna,

1963
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:09,620
um, Nathan Gary and some statements, uh, with the team behind each game, there will be a

1964
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:12,340
limited run of 2000 copies for that.

1965
01:46:12,340 --> 01:46:15,700
So that's going to really be for the diehard fans, but you know what?

1966
01:46:15,700 --> 01:46:20,660
That's that company's put out so many good games and just like artsy indie titles that

1967
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:21,860
really resonate.

1968
01:46:21,860 --> 01:46:24,020
Um, I bet there will be a lot of people to go for that.

1969
01:46:24,820 --> 01:46:26,500
So, all right.

1970
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:29,380
So now we're going to take a trip back in time.

1971
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:34,660
We're going to go back to, there was, there was no eight disc collector set of things.

1972
01:46:34,660 --> 01:46:35,540
Well, I don't know.

1973
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:40,980
Maybe you would have collector sets, but they came with a dish and a spoon or a poster.

1974
01:46:41,860 --> 01:46:46,100
Yeah, no, and not, not those are a, uh, um, uh, pillowcase.

1975
01:46:47,060 --> 01:46:47,700
All right.

1976
01:46:47,700 --> 01:46:51,300
You know, I'm talking about the classic game of the week and every week dark soccer steps

1977
01:46:51,620 --> 01:46:55,860
into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, Hey, you kids should be tech checking

1978
01:46:55,860 --> 01:46:56,740
this game out.

1979
01:46:56,740 --> 01:46:58,660
What is the classic game of the week dark soccer?

1980
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:03,220
It's tech romancer suggested by my very own Dan.

1981
01:47:04,740 --> 01:47:08,580
So, uh, tech romancer is a, it was an arcade game.

1982
01:47:09,220 --> 01:47:16,580
It's Japanese game was Choko Senki Kikayo, um, which was a 3d fighting game that came

1983
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:18,340
out in 1998.

1984
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:22,740
Um, by the way, that name means chronicle of super steel warrior.

1985
01:47:22,740 --> 01:47:25,620
Kikayo Kikayo is a, it means a machine.

1986
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:33,220
So it was basically a fighting game that was based off of different sub genre of Becca

1987
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:34,020
anime.

1988
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:37,860
And of course it did come out to the dream cast as things in that era did.

1989
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:44,100
Um, so basically you come, you control a giant robot and you fight one-on-one combat with

1990
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:45,140
another giant robot.

1991
01:47:45,780 --> 01:47:52,660
Um, and the cool thing about this is that the studio new, uh, new eight, which is these,

1992
01:47:52,660 --> 01:47:59,700
it's the same animation studio, uh, that did the mechanical designs for super dimension

1993
01:47:59,700 --> 01:48:04,580
fortress, Macross, which, uh, as we know was Robotech in the U S but they designed the

1994
01:48:04,580 --> 01:48:05,380
robots for the game.

1995
01:48:06,340 --> 01:48:10,660
Um, I mean, that's, it's so funny cause you totally have this one that looks kind of like

1996
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:13,060
Mazinger Z style and everything is pretty cool.

1997
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:19,860
Um, so at any rate, um, you are far in the future of earth and you have advanced technology

1998
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:27,140
and everyone can just like chill, but then a alien tyrant named gold BS invades and you

1999
01:48:27,140 --> 01:48:27,940
got a fight.

2000
01:48:28,580 --> 01:48:31,300
So you have two, uh, primary modes.

2001
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:33,940
You have story mode and hero challenge mode.

2002
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:38,660
The dream cast one also had mini games that can be played on the VMU to get more points.

2003
01:48:39,300 --> 01:48:46,820
Um, in Japan, the game was re-released, um, as, uh, Choco Senki Kikayo for matching service,

2004
01:48:46,820 --> 01:48:51,860
which, um, matching services usually for online play and it had online functionality.

2005
01:48:52,420 --> 01:48:58,580
Um, so you have a flat 3d pane with buildings and other things scattered around.

2006
01:48:59,140 --> 01:49:04,100
Um, and if you destroy the terrain, um, by either breaking them or walking through them,

2007
01:49:04,100 --> 01:49:09,860
you get power ups and you, uh, can get three different weapons, armor, or life power ups,

2008
01:49:09,860 --> 01:49:13,540
a hero mode power up, which increases the power of your MECHA attack.

2009
01:49:13,540 --> 01:49:17,140
And you can also get additional abilities and different moves.

2010
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:22,340
So instead of having a round, your match is decided by your life meter.

2011
01:49:22,340 --> 01:49:27,940
Um, so you have two life meters and when the second one is depleted, then you're done.

2012
01:49:28,580 --> 01:49:34,900
Um, and then you also have an armor gauge that can be broken and lowers your overall defense.

2013
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:40,180
Then you also have at least two super attacks and a final attack, which, uh, you can use when

2014
01:49:40,180 --> 01:49:46,180
your opponent is down to the last 50% of their second life bar. And it's usually like an insta

2015
01:49:46,180 --> 01:49:55,940
kill. Um, it was actually, uh, listed as one of the most successful arcade games in Japan.

2016
01:49:55,940 --> 01:50:04,340
Um, game machine listed it as the sixth most successful. Um, the dreamcast game, um, in the

2017
01:50:04,340 --> 01:50:13,220
U S it wasn't really seen as, um, as great in the U S as it was in Japan, just because that same level

2018
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:18,900
of nostalgia, I guess, isn't present here as it would have been for the whole series of MECHA

2019
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:24,820
anime that had existed since, you know, the sixties. I mean, sixties really, you know,

2020
01:50:24,820 --> 01:50:30,660
you have your tattoo on Adam, you have, uh, Mazinger Z, you had everything leading up then into

2021
01:50:30,660 --> 01:50:37,620
like even, uh, got your mind in the seven early seventies, you had, uh, all kinds of, you know,

2022
01:50:37,620 --> 01:50:41,220
there's a lot more, I think, uh, nostalgia for it in Japan than there was for it here.

2023
01:50:41,780 --> 01:50:49,220
But, um, it got a 29, um, out of 40 from Famitsu is generally, uh, considered favorable. So,

2024
01:50:49,220 --> 01:50:53,540
I mean, and we know how stingy Famitsu is. So yeah, overall it got really,

2025
01:50:53,540 --> 01:50:59,220
really good ratings, uh, anywhere from average to the higher end of, uh, of the scale.

2026
01:51:02,260 --> 01:51:10,260
And that is tech romancer, which there you go. I'm curious before we go out to the show, if, uh,

2027
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:15,220
Loki has ever, uh, checked this game out. Cause I know you're a big mech person. And so this is

2028
01:51:15,220 --> 01:51:19,300
like a mech fighting game. So I'm curious if this is something that it was ever on your radar, Loki.

2029
01:51:19,940 --> 01:51:25,300
Uh, no, I was unaware of the whole game. Yeah. I have to admit, I was not very familiar with

2030
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:29,060
this game either. So, but you said it didn't have like a huge reception in the U S really

2031
01:51:29,060 --> 01:51:33,140
compared to Japan, right? Yeah. It was kind of like the people who liked it really liked it.

2032
01:51:33,140 --> 01:51:37,860
I mean, it is sort of, you know, it's a genre game and you know, if you're looking at the, uh,

2033
01:51:38,740 --> 01:51:44,980
the video here, you know, it's, it's like the, each of these Mecca come from their own like

2034
01:51:44,980 --> 01:51:49,300
anime series. They've got little intros and special logos for them and everything.

2035
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:57,700
So, um, so the game is really, uh, I wouldn't even say a love letter to the, uh, the genre.

2036
01:51:57,700 --> 01:52:01,940
Yeah. Um, sorry, just some quick comments from chat that kind of, uh, along those same lines,

2037
01:52:01,940 --> 01:52:05,940
orange, right. Says, love how everyone has their own logo. Uh, Questbuster says,

2038
01:52:05,940 --> 01:52:08,420
yay, tech romancer. I still have this for my dream cast.

2039
01:52:10,660 --> 01:52:16,500
Well, and, uh, bones double six wants me to keep, uh, you know, naming off, uh,

2040
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:25,540
mecha anime. So, uh, I was actually thinking though of, um, cyber bots. It's kind of gives

2041
01:52:25,540 --> 01:52:31,780
me a little bit of a cyber bots field, but cyber bots was, uh, was, uh, 2d. But I mean,

2042
01:52:31,780 --> 01:52:39,140
we also had, you know, uh, you know, I mentioned Mazinger Z. We had, um, that was a Go Nagai

2043
01:52:39,140 --> 01:52:44,420
anime, um, who also gave us devil man. You remember that one? Um, we had, uh,

2044
01:52:44,420 --> 01:52:53,380
Tetsujin 28 Go, which we got in the USS Gigantor in 1963. Um, we had, uh, Gundam, the whole Gundam

2045
01:52:53,380 --> 01:52:59,780
series as a big space saga with giant robots. Um, and I'm sure Gundam wing was really, I think

2046
01:52:59,780 --> 01:53:06,020
the one that kicked the Gundam series into popularity here in the U S we had, uh, Dan guard

2047
01:53:06,020 --> 01:53:13,380
ACE. We had for us, we had go lion that turned into the lion Voltron over here. Um, and we also

2048
01:53:13,380 --> 01:53:23,620
had, um, uh, that became vehicle Voltron. Um, Evangelion can even be considered a mecha anime,

2049
01:53:23,620 --> 01:53:29,620
even though that they are not really mecha, they're organic. Um, and then of course all

2050
01:53:29,620 --> 01:53:34,660
these things, you know, I would think that if you released a mecha game now with the advent of

2051
01:53:34,660 --> 01:53:42,660
Pacific rim, for an example, um, you know, and that a lot more people are more well versed in

2052
01:53:42,660 --> 01:53:47,860
various, uh, you know, anime, you know, a lot of people have gone back and tried to discover the

2053
01:53:47,860 --> 01:53:54,500
classics, you know, and that I think that maybe the game might have a better chance right now. I

2054
01:53:54,500 --> 01:54:02,260
mean, we had, we had a Voltron, you know, uh, kind of a redo that was released in the U S um, but I

2055
01:54:02,260 --> 01:54:08,740
mean, I remembered loving my mecha anime and like the nineties, like Palabor, um, even dominion

2056
01:54:08,980 --> 01:54:15,220
police could be considered a mecha anime. Of course. Um, we had, uh,

2057
01:54:16,740 --> 01:54:21,540
gosh, honestly, now I'm just thinking of all, all of the, the various kinds, cause I, I do

2058
01:54:21,540 --> 01:54:28,100
love my mecha anime. I liked, uh, got demo eight, the mess team. Uh, I, I like turn a Gundam was

2059
01:54:28,100 --> 01:54:33,380
actually pretty interesting. Um, even transformers, I think could be considered a, a mecha anime of

2060
01:54:33,380 --> 01:54:40,660
sorts, but I mean, you know, we had our, our introduction to a lot of this when we were a lot

2061
01:54:40,660 --> 01:54:46,820
younger, you know, even with what, um, they did for Robotech over here, we had my cross, we had

2062
01:54:46,820 --> 01:54:53,300
most beta bubblegum prices could be considered a mecha anime. So, which hopefully some of these

2063
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:59,380
names are actually, you know, familiar to people, you know, fire Robo, all, all, all of that. So,

2064
01:54:59,460 --> 01:55:08,820
all right. Uh, I love me some mecha in chat says I keep reminding people of a PS2 mecha game called

2065
01:55:08,820 --> 01:55:16,420
robot out alchemical drive, which started my obsession with mecha animes. I remember that

2066
01:55:16,420 --> 01:55:21,460
when I was supposed to brings up robot carnival, which was, uh, it was, it was pretty good. Uh,

2067
01:55:21,460 --> 01:55:29,460
metropolis, I think, um, there, cause there was, uh, yeah. Metropolis. There was the, um,

2068
01:55:30,580 --> 01:55:34,100
I can't, why can't I remember her name, her name or the Rose opera singer.

2069
01:55:34,980 --> 01:55:38,660
Bring us back from the classic game segment that I turned off. No, no, it's all good.

2070
01:55:38,660 --> 01:55:42,180
Trip down memory lane, but a tech romancer is your classic game of the week. There you go.

2071
01:55:43,060 --> 01:55:46,660
Tech romancer is awesome. Tastic. And you need to play it. And then, um,

2072
01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:51,620
but also play cyber. All right. We might talk about some of these other games in coming weeks.

2073
01:55:51,620 --> 01:55:55,700
That's for sure. Um, but I know for tonight, uh, dark Sakura, I know we have to let you go

2074
01:55:55,700 --> 01:55:59,860
a little early tonight. She has some family things to take care of, but, um, thank you,

2075
01:55:59,860 --> 01:56:03,620
of course, for being here as if I have to thank you. You've been here every week, but still

2076
01:56:03,620 --> 01:56:10,660
appreciate it. Mostly weeks, real life. Sometimes your life has different, uh, different, uh,

2077
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:14,260
designs on my time. Yeah. Understandable. There's a lot going on. Um, so

2078
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:20,260
sorry. Any final thoughts for our listeners before we let you go?

2079
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:27,540
Um, I encourage everyone here in California, sorry, my glasses are all smoky. Um, number one,

2080
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:33,700
I have new glasses and I think they're freaking adorable. And yes, I sprung for Prada. Um, second,

2081
01:56:33,700 --> 01:56:41,460
um, if you're out in any area, do not go outside without your mask. Even if you are not sick,

2082
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:45,220
other people may be, please be respectful of other people by wearing your mask properly,

2083
01:56:45,220 --> 01:56:50,580
covering your nose and your chin, and do not put it to your chin because of the moment you

2084
01:56:50,580 --> 01:56:55,140
pull it back over your face, germs that you have on your skin from your neck will go over your face.

2085
01:56:55,140 --> 01:56:59,700
Second of all, make sure you wash all of your hands. Um, you know, 20 seconds, you know,

2086
01:56:59,700 --> 01:57:05,860
seeing I will survive or something, um, or some belly parton. And also here in California,

2087
01:57:05,860 --> 01:57:12,340
if you can swing getting, uh, filters for your masks or getting a, um, respirator mask,

2088
01:57:13,060 --> 01:57:18,580
please do it. Don't go out there and damage your lungs. Just stay inside and stay safe.

2089
01:57:18,580 --> 01:57:23,220
Play some games. All right. And don't go any concerts. God damn it. Smash mouth.

2090
01:57:23,220 --> 01:57:25,620
All right. Thank you to our soccer. We'll see you next week.

2091
01:57:26,500 --> 01:57:32,900
Boy. All right. Bye. Bye. All right. Let me just, uh, while I fix the, uh, discord there

2092
01:57:32,980 --> 01:57:37,540
so we can see Loki front and center. All right. Let's get into some rapid fire news,

2093
01:57:37,540 --> 01:57:43,300
some quick headlines for the week. Loki. So, yes. So there's, um, some new games coming out.

2094
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:47,940
So one of those, um, from one of my favorite companies, D three is releasing yet another

2095
01:57:47,940 --> 01:57:54,900
Oni Chambara game. Uh, that's the bikini samurai, uh, zombie Slayer game that's going to be coming

2096
01:57:54,900 --> 01:58:03,620
out October 14th, uh, Oni Chambara origins on PlayStation four and PC. So it, it is what it is.

2097
01:58:03,620 --> 01:58:10,100
It's, uh, they had a very interesting, um, debut like release date trailer for it. I think it had,

2098
01:58:10,100 --> 01:58:15,060
I can't remember which, um, Japanese artist was in, but it's a Japanese metal band. Um,

2099
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:21,860
so interesting. Um, and then of course, um, another kind of eclectic game like that as well.

2100
01:58:21,860 --> 01:58:28,660
No more heroes three, unfortunately is going to be delayed to 2021 because of course, COVID-19.

2101
01:58:28,660 --> 01:58:34,420
So they've, um, said that because of that, it, their team has been hard hit at a grasshopper

2102
01:58:34,420 --> 01:58:40,740
manufacturer. And so that they've decided to focus on prioritizing quality and to push back

2103
01:58:40,740 --> 01:58:48,100
the final release date. So now it's coming out in 2021. So this year, so I can wait. It looks good.

2104
01:58:48,100 --> 01:58:52,500
Who knew there were so many similarities between no more heroes three and marshmallow peeps.

2105
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:59,940
Also not coming out this holiday season. Sorry. It's a terrible joke, but it's true

2106
01:58:59,940 --> 01:59:05,700
for this holiday for Halloween. Yeah. You know how they do peeps every now they do peeps,

2107
01:59:05,700 --> 01:59:11,460
like they do pumpkin peeps for Halloween. They'll do like peppermint peeps for Christmas. They'll,

2108
01:59:11,460 --> 01:59:14,820
they'll sell those things to you around for any Europe. You're only supposed to put that

2109
01:59:14,820 --> 01:59:21,540
Easter. No, not anymore. Not anymore. All right. Some rapid fire headlines for me.

2110
01:59:21,540 --> 01:59:28,180
Apparently the Ninja Gaiden trilogy has been registered as a trademark for PlayStation

2111
01:59:28,180 --> 01:59:34,500
four and switch. This is a Hong Kong software distributor game source entertainment listed

2112
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:39,940
these for Nintendo switch platforms in 2021. Oh, remember the days when things would get spoiled

2113
01:59:39,940 --> 01:59:46,820
from distributor release dates, Loki, remember the times. So this may be a thing. Now, apparently

2114
01:59:46,820 --> 01:59:52,740
the listing was eliminated, but some folks over on a big forum caught that. And there's apparently

2115
01:59:52,740 --> 02:00:00,580
a bundle with Ninja guidance, Sigma Sigma two and Ninja Gaiden three razors edge from 2012.

2116
02:00:00,580 --> 02:00:06,740
So it's a huge so, Oh man, I was thinking it was the original trilogy. I got excited.

2117
02:00:06,740 --> 02:00:11,620
No, no, no, no. All right. So it's the newer games. Well, those are okay.

2118
02:00:11,620 --> 02:00:18,020
Uh, that will be coming out apparently in March for 40 bucks. Okay. So a new Ninja Gaiden trilogy,

2119
02:00:18,020 --> 02:00:24,980
why not? If it's good enough for Mario, why not real? All right. Also another quick headline about

2120
02:00:24,980 --> 02:00:31,620
a mobile release for iOS and Android called Pac-Man geo. It looks like it might be Pokemon go

2121
02:00:31,620 --> 02:00:36,100
meets Pac-Man, but guess what? It's not that I read, I looked into this a little more. It is not

2122
02:00:36,100 --> 02:00:42,100
Pokemon go with Pac-Man because what it is, New York, Paris, Tokyo, make a Pac-Man maze by

2123
02:00:42,100 --> 02:00:47,060
choosing from a variety of real world streets. So you just play Pac-Man on a variety of real world

2124
02:00:47,060 --> 02:00:55,620
streets. You know what this is? Uh huh. It is. It's that Google April fool's joke. It is just like,

2125
02:00:55,620 --> 02:01:01,460
what's interesting. You know, the, the SIM similarity there between Pokemon go is that

2126
02:01:01,460 --> 02:01:08,420
Pokemon go was born of that April fool's joke. Uh, that was the kind of the first kind of

2127
02:01:09,460 --> 02:01:15,220
pebble, if you will, that started the avalanche of Pokemon go was when that Pokemon Google April

2128
02:01:15,220 --> 02:01:20,180
fool's prank happened. It ended up like, wow, this would actually be a really fun type of product in

2129
02:01:20,180 --> 02:01:25,060
the real world. So now that's what they're doing with Pac-Man, except it really is kind of like,

2130
02:01:25,060 --> 02:01:29,540
download the maps and play on these maps. But I mean the Google, the Google integration thing

2131
02:01:29,540 --> 02:01:35,460
was fun. So I'm sure this game will be fine, but it is not Pokemon. Like a lot of outlets

2132
02:01:35,460 --> 02:01:40,500
are just saying it must be Pokemon go meets Pac-Man. It's not that. Yeah. So at least it's

2133
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:45,700
free. So you can try it out and then immediately delete it off of her devices because it's probably

2134
02:01:45,700 --> 02:01:49,940
not really great. I still think it's interesting how many Google April fool's jokes are becoming

2135
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:56,900
reality. You want to know what else is funny? Okay. So Ingress Niantic Niantic used to be a

2136
02:01:56,900 --> 02:02:03,780
Google own thing, right? Until they split off on their own. Well, the April fool's joke in Ingress

2137
02:02:03,780 --> 02:02:09,860
one year when Google was over them was that it changed your avatar to Pac-Man and all the XM

2138
02:02:09,860 --> 02:02:15,300
became dots and all the portals or pokey stops, whatever were ghosts. And you could change them

2139
02:02:15,300 --> 02:02:22,660
to green and blue colors. That was the gag in Pokemon or Ingress one year. So it's kind of funny

2140
02:02:22,660 --> 02:02:29,620
how like all these Google jokes come alive in the real world. So SSG100 Matt says, I mean,

2141
02:02:29,620 --> 02:02:39,620
to be fair, how many OLR in jokes have been made into games? Two bungee ferret tossing and pixel

2142
02:02:39,620 --> 02:02:47,460
shits, right? Or pixel poops on the Vita. So, yeah. All right. So that so far, we don't know

2143
02:02:47,460 --> 02:02:52,980
of any mystery projects that may be coming. All right. Moving on. Let's travel around the world

2144
02:02:52,980 --> 02:02:57,540
and check out some release dates of things coming a little sooner than bungee ferret tossing too.

2145
02:02:58,420 --> 02:03:06,420
Yep. So this week we've got BPM bullets per minute. That's that rhythm of FPS that's coming

2146
02:03:06,420 --> 02:03:14,900
out on PC. Fight crab on Nintendo switch. Your crabs and your fighting. Spelunky 2.

2147
02:03:15,540 --> 02:03:20,420
What else do you need to know? I mean, it's literally what it is. You have like

2148
02:03:20,420 --> 02:03:29,140
crabs of weapons. There's Spelunky 2 on PlayStation 4. Welcome to Elk on PC and Xbox One.

2149
02:03:29,780 --> 02:03:38,180
Crisis Remastered on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Super Mario 3D All-Stars on Nintendo Switch

2150
02:03:38,180 --> 02:03:44,820
and WWE 2K Battlegrounds on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Stadia.

2151
02:03:46,340 --> 02:03:51,060
That's it. All right. Let's travel to Japan. We're on the Nintendo Switch this week. You can check

2152
02:03:51,060 --> 02:03:58,180
out Azure Lane. Crosswave comes out on September 17th. Atomic Crops also comes out on September

2153
02:03:58,180 --> 02:04:03,620
17th. And then the Super Mario 3D All-Stars also gets a release in Japan the same day as the rest

2154
02:04:03,620 --> 02:04:09,300
of the world, September 18th. And it looks like a one mother game for the 17th, excuse me. Pro

2155
02:04:09,300 --> 02:04:15,540
Yaku Famitsa 2020, which Loki just mentioned for the US as well. Checking the PlayStation 4. I

2156
02:04:15,540 --> 02:04:22,020
imagine you're going to have some overlap. Atomic Crops is on the PlayStation 4 as well and E-Football

2157
02:04:22,020 --> 02:04:28,500
PES 2021 season update. So literally just a roster update coming for Konami and Pro Evo Soccer in

2158
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:33,460
Japan. And that is it for the PlayStation 4 this week. A little lighter over there than the Switch.

2159
02:04:34,020 --> 02:04:37,460
So there you go. All right. We have a few more headlines and then we're going to get to the

2160
02:04:37,460 --> 02:04:41,300
listener round table with some emails. We do have two emails tonight to get to.

2161
02:04:41,300 --> 02:04:42,980
Still got the European dates.

2162
02:04:42,980 --> 02:04:46,900
Oh, shit. You're right. I skipped those over because Dark Soccer is not here,

2163
02:04:46,900 --> 02:04:50,260
but yes, usually you will pinch hit for those. So thank you. Please, Loki.

2164
02:04:51,220 --> 02:04:58,260
In Europe, we've got a Pro Evolution Soccer 2021 that's coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2165
02:04:58,740 --> 02:05:01,540
No Straight Roads on Nintendo Switch.

2166
02:05:01,540 --> 02:05:02,580
Gay Roads Only.

2167
02:05:04,980 --> 02:05:12,020
Super Mario 3D All-Stars on Nintendo Switch. Void Bastards on PlayStation 4 and the Switch.

2168
02:05:12,020 --> 02:05:20,180
NASCAR Heat 5 on PlayStation 4. Looks like we've got Commandos 2 HD Remaster.

2169
02:05:20,180 --> 02:05:26,340
That's going to be coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.

2170
02:05:27,140 --> 02:05:33,460
WWE 2K Battlegrounds on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch and PC as well.

2171
02:05:34,100 --> 02:05:37,700
Beholder Collector's Edition on Switch. And that's it.

2172
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:43,300
All right. Thank you for not neglecting our UK audience. Appreciate that.

2173
02:05:43,300 --> 02:05:43,860
Of course.

2174
02:05:43,860 --> 02:05:47,940
All right. But we do have some more headlines we're going to get into, including this one.

2175
02:05:48,660 --> 02:05:51,380
Pretty interesting shift to change coming and something we've been

2176
02:05:51,380 --> 02:05:52,980
talking about for a few weeks. Right, Loki?

2177
02:05:53,620 --> 02:06:00,660
Yeah. So Apple has made some changes to their game streaming rules, which apparently

2178
02:06:01,380 --> 02:06:06,260
could lead the way for Xcloud and Stadia to be allowed onto the App Store.

2179
02:06:06,260 --> 02:06:12,180
However, there's some caveats with that. So streaming games are permitted as long as they

2180
02:06:12,180 --> 02:06:18,260
adhere to all of their guidelines. And I guess each update must be submitted for review.

2181
02:06:18,260 --> 02:06:23,300
Developers must provide appropriate metadata for search and games must use in-app purchases

2182
02:06:23,300 --> 02:06:28,740
to unlock features or functionality. Each streaming game must be submitted

2183
02:06:28,740 --> 02:06:33,700
to the App Store as an individual app. So that's kind of irritating.

2184
02:06:33,700 --> 02:06:39,620
So, for example, if you have Xcloud, Halo would have to be its own app.

2185
02:06:39,620 --> 02:06:43,620
Forza would have to be its own app. Gears of War would have to be its own app,

2186
02:06:43,620 --> 02:06:48,660
which is absolutely stupid. But that's the way that they're forcing it to be done.

2187
02:06:49,860 --> 02:06:56,420
Each game streaming service may offer a catalog app on the App Store to help users sign up for

2188
02:06:56,420 --> 02:07:01,140
the service and find the games on the App Store, provided the apps adhere to all the guidelines.

2189
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:05,220
So basically you can have a catalog app that basically links you to the other

2190
02:07:05,860 --> 02:07:08,500
individual games that you have to download to your device.

2191
02:07:10,100 --> 02:07:15,700
I have some mixed thoughts on this. Obviously, we know that banning the streaming apps was not the

2192
02:07:15,700 --> 02:07:20,820
direction we wanted to see Apple taking. So it does seem like we might have our first crack in

2193
02:07:20,820 --> 02:07:27,540
the glass. And this is very different from the Apple and Fortnite situation. That's a whole

2194
02:07:27,540 --> 02:07:32,180
other thing. We're not getting into that again tonight. Although things are still happening in

2195
02:07:32,180 --> 02:07:36,260
that space, but it's basically more legal documents. Well, you did this, more legal

2196
02:07:36,260 --> 02:07:40,580
documents. You did that. But anyway, back on this, I think, and I said, I don't think Apple

2197
02:07:40,580 --> 02:07:46,100
is on the right side with this because they don't review every movie on Netflix. They don't review

2198
02:07:46,100 --> 02:07:51,380
every song on Spotify. Why do they want to review every game that's going out on streaming? Which is

2199
02:07:51,380 --> 02:07:58,260
kind of what this policy is, right? They literally want to review every game. And I think the

2200
02:07:58,260 --> 02:08:03,540
companies maybe want to put, and I still don't think this is going to be the final answer

2201
02:08:03,540 --> 02:08:07,300
because perception is everything. And I think the users are still like,

2202
02:08:07,300 --> 02:08:15,220
no, this isn't really what we want. And if Netflix can have Bandersnatch, which is a game,

2203
02:08:15,220 --> 02:08:21,940
and I'm sorry, the Black Mirror Bandersnatch episode, which is a game, and Netflix can have

2204
02:08:21,940 --> 02:08:27,220
the Minecraft story mode, which is a game, and that isn't a problem, then there's kind of like

2205
02:08:27,220 --> 02:08:31,140
a double standard there, right? Yes, there's lots of things like that, yeah.

2206
02:08:31,140 --> 02:08:34,740
Here's the thing. I don't think anybody else, well, it's the internet, probably somebody posted

2207
02:08:34,740 --> 02:08:39,860
on a forum somewhere, but I want to talk about what I think the issue is here, what the real

2208
02:08:39,860 --> 02:08:47,620
sticking point is here, and why Apple's doing this. And here it is. I know a lot of you in

2209
02:08:47,620 --> 02:08:53,460
chat are like, oh, it's money or Apple's selfish. No, come on, come on, get past all that. What is

2210
02:08:53,460 --> 02:09:01,300
the real answer? I'm going to tell you what it is. It's the games on xCloud and the games on Stadia

2211
02:09:01,940 --> 02:09:10,340
that are also mobile phone games. Those are the problem. And that I think is the issue that has

2212
02:09:10,340 --> 02:09:17,460
to be worked out. What do I mean by that? My example is, let's say Microsoft next week is

2213
02:09:17,460 --> 02:09:22,740
going to add Sayonara Wild Hearts to Game Pass. I don't know that that's the case. I'm making it up.

2214
02:09:23,700 --> 02:09:28,180
So Microsoft adds Sayonara Wild Hearts, which great, you can play that with a Game Pass

2215
02:09:28,180 --> 02:09:32,820
subscription, right? With an xCloud subscription and all that, right? So you could download this

2216
02:09:32,820 --> 02:09:38,420
separate app to your phone and play that. Wait a minute. There's a problem. Sayonara Wild Hearts

2217
02:09:38,420 --> 02:09:46,820
is also a standalone Apple game. I'm sorry, not Apple first party game, I'm sorry. Standalone app

2218
02:09:46,820 --> 02:09:51,700
that is available through Apple Arcade, which is another complication, but we'll say is also

2219
02:09:51,700 --> 02:09:57,220
something that stands on its own. That is the problem. And I think-

2220
02:09:57,220 --> 02:10:01,620
Yeah, but I think that's a problem that Apple should have because it's the developer of the

2221
02:10:01,620 --> 02:10:05,380
game should be able to decide, hey, I want my game to be played free with this thing.

2222
02:10:05,380 --> 02:10:09,860
It really isn't up to Apple. I mean, the developer can change the price of their game to free at any

2223
02:10:09,860 --> 02:10:17,380
point. It's not for Apple to decide that. But to say that, Loki, is then saying, well, then we

2224
02:10:17,380 --> 02:10:21,620
should just allow the Epic Store on iOS, which I don't think we should.

2225
02:10:24,020 --> 02:10:29,780
I mean, I don't know. I'm not going to take Apple's defense here. And the reason why,

2226
02:10:29,780 --> 02:10:37,780
aside from this, is just like all of the fuckery that they do with their physical devices and

2227
02:10:37,780 --> 02:10:43,700
making it difficult for independent repair shops to fix that stuff. They purposely go out of the

2228
02:10:43,700 --> 02:10:48,820
way to screw the consumer on a lot of things. But they're always saying it's in the best interest

2229
02:10:48,820 --> 02:10:53,860
of the consumer. It's really just to make themselves money. And I have a feeling that

2230
02:10:53,860 --> 02:11:01,140
the only reason they're changing these guidelines is not necessarily to open it up to Microsoft

2231
02:11:01,140 --> 02:11:08,100
and Google to put these streaming services on this device. It's more to protect them from an

2232
02:11:08,100 --> 02:11:12,180
upcoming lawsuit regarding this stuff. I think it's basically saying that,

2233
02:11:12,180 --> 02:11:17,220
look, we're playing fair. We're allowing them to be on here, but they have to follow our rules.

2234
02:11:17,220 --> 02:11:21,860
And unfortunately, it's just the solution they're providing is not adequate enough for these

2235
02:11:21,860 --> 02:11:30,260
streaming services. I get that angle, Loki, but I think there's a part of this where they are

2236
02:11:30,260 --> 02:11:37,620
listening. They're understanding that they are viewed as in the wrong by the consumer base,

2237
02:11:37,700 --> 02:11:44,820
and they have to listen to their consumers. And I think they are trying to resolve this somehow

2238
02:11:45,460 --> 02:11:53,060
to push this forward so they don't look so crappy. Bobby is elaborating on what I was saying in chat.

2239
02:11:54,340 --> 02:11:58,900
Yes, Bobby, what you're saying is where I'm going with this. Apple gets a cut from the iPhone

2240
02:11:58,900 --> 02:12:03,460
version. Apple would not get a cut of the Game Pass version, even though the consumer pays for

2241
02:12:03,460 --> 02:12:08,420
both versions. So Apple has a vested interest in promoting the app-native version over the

2242
02:12:08,420 --> 02:12:13,060
cloud version. They do have language that says you cannot make sure that the customer has paid

2243
02:12:13,060 --> 02:12:18,500
for an app twice, or rather you have to make sure there are no duplicate purchases. So if someone

2244
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:26,420
bought Sayonara Wild Hearts, they should not be allowed to play it on Game Pass. This is just my

2245
02:12:26,420 --> 02:12:32,420
honest, trying to take a step back and not be like, oh, I'm team Apple. To try to figure out

2246
02:12:32,420 --> 02:12:39,620
what is the sticking point here, this is it. The games that exist both on Xbox and potentially Game

2247
02:12:39,620 --> 02:12:46,500
Pass and as a standalone iOS Android game, those games that are, and who's to say this isn't going

2248
02:12:46,500 --> 02:12:52,420
to be a problem for Android as well? Maybe they just haven't thought of this yet. The games that

2249
02:12:52,420 --> 02:13:00,180
exist in both places, this has to be figured out. And I kind of think the ultimate resolution to

2250
02:13:00,180 --> 02:13:08,660
this, if Apple does cave on this, there's going to be a clout that will exclude certain games from

2251
02:13:08,660 --> 02:13:16,020
Game Pass. And it's going to be any game that has a standalone app on mobile stores cannot be a part

2252
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:22,340
of Game Pass or Stadia or any of these. And that is how this resolves. Mark my words. I don't think

2253
02:13:22,340 --> 02:13:26,740
it's going to be a problem though on Android because they already have xCloud on Android and

2254
02:13:26,740 --> 02:13:33,140
it's working just fine. And obviously Stadia is working on Android because it's a Google product.

2255
02:13:33,140 --> 02:13:33,640
Fair.

2256
02:13:34,420 --> 02:13:40,340
So I don't think, obviously, these are not going to be issues. It's just because Apple's being

2257
02:13:40,340 --> 02:13:48,180
Apple. I don't know what, they can do whatever they want. It's their ecosystem. But I don't like

2258
02:13:48,180 --> 02:13:53,140
how their ecosystem is such a closed, it's walled off from everybody else and they're not being

2259
02:13:53,140 --> 02:13:58,180
flexible on anything. But they have, they're well within the right to do that. But I'm also well

2260
02:13:58,180 --> 02:14:02,100
within my right to think that they're stupid for doing it and not buying their products, which is

2261
02:14:02,100 --> 02:14:07,220
what I'm going to continue to do. So yeah, you can still still ultimately vote with your wallet.

2262
02:14:07,220 --> 02:14:12,180
But I do think they're going to end up bending. And I think that's going to be the agreement. I

2263
02:14:12,180 --> 02:14:17,620
think xCloud and Stadia will be allowed on iOS, but the written agreement will be you cannot put

2264
02:14:17,620 --> 02:14:23,540
a game out that exists as a standalone app. And that's, that's that. So clip it because we're

2265
02:14:23,540 --> 02:14:27,780
going to play it again when that ends up happening. Well, I was gonna say, Bobby's saying that many

2266
02:14:27,780 --> 02:14:31,300
consumers like the walled garden because they feel it's safer. And who do you think put that

2267
02:14:31,300 --> 02:14:35,620
into their head that it's safer when it's walled off like that? It's Apple's marketing that said

2268
02:14:35,620 --> 02:14:41,300
that. So you know, that that's what it is. It's the perception put in by Apple saying, well,

2269
02:14:41,300 --> 02:14:45,940
this is why we do is because it's, it's safer for you. You don't want those viruses, do you?

2270
02:14:45,940 --> 02:14:50,900
We check everything. But really, there's no risk to the consumer, you know, for the streaming

2271
02:14:50,900 --> 02:14:55,700
services to put a virus on their phone or something like that. It is a streaming service.

2272
02:14:55,700 --> 02:15:00,740
It's it's just like Netflix, you're not worried about getting a virus on your TV or, or your phone

2273
02:15:00,740 --> 02:15:04,980
from watching Netflix or Hulu or whatever. So why should this be any different? I'm with black and

2274
02:15:04,980 --> 02:15:10,340
pad. I like the walls. I mean, because I feel like with Apple kind of going through with the quality

2275
02:15:10,340 --> 02:15:14,420
check and all that stuff, and not having all the sideloading and all that stuff, like everything

2276
02:15:14,500 --> 02:15:21,700
runs at a certain rate, that your performance isn't degraded. And and Allen uses Android,

2277
02:15:21,700 --> 02:15:25,620
and sometimes I see him run apps. I'm like, why is this frame rate so terrible? Oh, because there's

2278
02:15:25,620 --> 02:15:30,740
other things running on the side and all this other stuff going on. I just know it's because

2279
02:15:30,740 --> 02:15:37,540
that Android unfortunately, unlike Apple doesn't necessarily have a finite amount of systems to

2280
02:15:37,540 --> 02:15:43,380
develop for. And so you have, you know, mixed compatibility, because how do you test your device

2281
02:15:43,380 --> 02:15:48,580
or your program to run on every single possible system that's out there? All right, that's why

2282
02:15:48,580 --> 02:15:53,460
the Apple Android debate is not going to be settled here tonight. Let's move on to the next

2283
02:15:53,460 --> 02:15:58,980
story. You know what, I'm glad there's options. It shouldn't just be one company controlling

2284
02:15:58,980 --> 02:16:04,580
everything. So I'm glad we can have this debate about Apple versus Android. All right. Let's

2285
02:16:04,580 --> 02:16:09,540
talk about a game that has you know, and it shouldn't be one game. That's always the number

2286
02:16:09,540 --> 02:16:14,420
one game on Twitch either, right? It shouldn't be Fortnite forever. And it wasn't it. I mean,

2287
02:16:14,420 --> 02:16:20,420
it used to be for a long time it was PUBG, right? And it's still PUBG still does very well. Of

2288
02:16:20,420 --> 02:16:25,220
course, World of Warcraft was a huge game League of Legends. I mean, not to say those games aren't

2289
02:16:25,220 --> 02:16:30,180
still huge, but you know what I mean? Games come and games go from the number one spot and a new

2290
02:16:30,180 --> 02:16:34,660
game is showing up at the top of Twitch a lot lately. And there are some articles about the

2291
02:16:34,660 --> 02:16:40,820
sudden rise of the game Among Us, which I must admit I haven't played but my understanding is

2292
02:16:40,820 --> 02:16:46,980
it is a social deception game. So social deception games are things like werewolf,

2293
02:16:46,980 --> 02:16:55,300
the resistance. I love me some survivor and that type of stuff. I like the game Big Brother. I

2294
02:16:55,300 --> 02:17:00,180
don't like what it's turned into on TV. There's a lot of ugly shit on the show. But the game is

2295
02:17:00,180 --> 02:17:07,140
a concept. I think it's kind of interesting. So I think these, you know, kind of like social

2296
02:17:07,140 --> 02:17:13,780
deception games. Now we have one that is showing up in and I will admit, I don't know exactly how

2297
02:17:13,780 --> 02:17:18,660
Among Us works. I can tell you exactly how it works. Okay, I've actually seen some of it. So

2298
02:17:18,660 --> 02:17:24,820
the way it works is basically your your crew of 10 that's working on to afford a 10 I should say

2299
02:17:24,820 --> 02:17:33,380
that it's working on you basically preparing a ship for launch. And so you're you're doing

2300
02:17:33,380 --> 02:17:37,940
different tasks that you have in there to basically complete that. So there's little

2301
02:17:37,940 --> 02:17:44,100
mini games and stuff that you do. However, there's some people among you that are actually saboteurs

2302
02:17:44,100 --> 02:17:50,340
that are trying to, to stop everything. And the whole point is, oh, my God, that was the

2303
02:17:50,340 --> 02:17:55,860
it's the greatest reality TV show of all time, the mole, you're telling me it's the mole.

2304
02:17:55,860 --> 02:18:01,300
It's basically the mole. So basically, you do all that. And then after each round, Anderson Cooper

2305
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:07,620
there? No, necessarily. But like, after each round, you you call a meeting error, I guess

2306
02:18:07,620 --> 02:18:12,740
basically, they can call a meeting vote on who they feel is suspicious. And set, they basically

2307
02:18:12,740 --> 02:18:18,820
kick them through the airlock. So, and so like, if you're a saboteur, you're trying to break stuff,

2308
02:18:18,820 --> 02:18:22,660
you're trying to kill other crew members. But there's folks that are like, you know,

2309
02:18:24,180 --> 02:18:29,860
have like cameras, like a watch stuff. It's basically, it's trying to look like,

2310
02:18:29,860 --> 02:18:34,100
you know, like you're not causing trouble, but also causing trouble at the same time.

2311
02:18:34,100 --> 02:18:40,100
Okay, and it's the mole that way. Yeah. Oh, my God, that's, that's fucking amazing. I'm gonna

2312
02:18:40,100 --> 02:18:44,100
have to check this game out. I really am. So I mean, you can see why just in talking about the

2313
02:18:44,100 --> 02:18:48,580
game. And I can completely see why, especially with the whole like social deception. People love

2314
02:18:48,580 --> 02:18:53,700
to see people fight. That's why a lot of these reality shows are based in social deception and

2315
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:58,740
why shows like Survivor have been on for 20 years. That's essentially a social deception game. I mean,

2316
02:18:58,740 --> 02:19:03,220
it might not be a mole per se, but it's lying to someone's face. No, no, you and I got to stick

2317
02:19:03,220 --> 02:19:06,500
together and vote this other person out. And then you vote for, you know, them. You know, it's,

2318
02:19:06,500 --> 02:19:10,660
that's the stuff that, you know, these reality shows are at their core. And they're very,

2319
02:19:11,220 --> 02:19:14,820
it's very fast. And then of course, like Werewolf, the classic convention game,

2320
02:19:15,620 --> 02:19:21,860
is a social deception game. And yes, these games are huge. So this has done very, very well on

2321
02:19:21,860 --> 02:19:29,300
Twitch. And apparently, they are saying that the creators behind Among Us is that Mafia,

2322
02:19:29,300 --> 02:19:34,740
which is basically Werewolf, same thing, inspired this game. But apparently, it was originally going

2323
02:19:34,740 --> 02:19:41,700
to be a mobile only local multiplayer experience with just one map. But it didn't do that great

2324
02:19:41,700 --> 02:19:46,820
when it first came out. But based on feedback and some other things, they decided to stick

2325
02:19:46,820 --> 02:19:52,340
with the game, build it up and do these different updates. And now, they have the game to where it

2326
02:19:52,340 --> 02:19:59,700
is now. And it's doing very, very well online. Apparently, it's kind of started to get popularity

2327
02:19:59,700 --> 02:20:05,940
in Korea, then really took off there. YouTuber ran with it. And now it's, it's all over Twitch. And

2328
02:20:05,940 --> 02:20:10,580
now I'm interested in it. I gotta say, I want to check this game out. Although I can be a terrible

2329
02:20:10,580 --> 02:20:15,460
liar. I don't know why. But I'm pretty good at serve. I mean, I joked about when I played that

2330
02:20:15,460 --> 02:20:20,740
fake survivor game online last year, I got really good at the ability to just lie straight up lie to

2331
02:20:20,740 --> 02:20:23,940
somebody and say, Oh, no, we're sticking together. I'm not going to vote you out. And then I wrote

2332
02:20:23,940 --> 02:20:30,500
their name down the next tribal council. But I can be a horrible liar. Sometimes I'm not very

2333
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:36,100
good at things like the resistance. But I'd be curious to see how I do in a game like this.

2334
02:20:37,060 --> 02:20:39,700
What do you think? Why do you think this game is doing very popular?

2335
02:20:40,340 --> 02:20:46,820
I think it's just because of it's fun to watch people play it. It's also a relatively

2336
02:20:46,820 --> 02:20:52,980
inexpensive games like five bucks on Steam. So go check it out. It's just it's simple to

2337
02:20:54,100 --> 02:20:58,100
get how to play the game. And it's kind of difficult to master because you have to

2338
02:20:58,100 --> 02:21:04,500
be good at lying to people. And I don't know, it's has a lot of opportunity to be pretty funny.

2339
02:21:05,220 --> 02:21:09,540
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says the mole with Anderson Cooper was the greatest reality game

2340
02:21:09,540 --> 02:21:15,300
show ever. Don't at me. Bobby is correct. I need a little I need a little banner. I need a little

2341
02:21:15,300 --> 02:21:19,860
graphic a little doo doo doo doo. When when Bobby says something like that. And I can just say

2342
02:21:19,860 --> 02:21:26,740
Bobby is correct. A little a little floating wolf head surrounded by stars that says Bobby is

2343
02:21:26,740 --> 02:21:32,820
correct. That in comic sans font. That is yes, that factual statement. Well, obviously, the

2344
02:21:32,820 --> 02:21:37,140
mole is the greatest reality show. I would have loved to have gone on a show like that. It was

2345
02:21:37,140 --> 02:21:41,620
here. Let me read this on real people. So let me just elaborate a little bit more about what

2346
02:21:41,620 --> 02:21:46,340
this game is about. So like they're talking about what each like the crew and the imposter. So

2347
02:21:46,340 --> 02:21:49,780
the crew is basically supposed to win by completing tasks to prepare to ship to

2348
02:21:50,420 --> 02:21:56,660
or ejecting all imposters react quickly to undo the imposter sabotages. Check the admin map

2349
02:21:56,660 --> 02:22:01,220
security cameras to keep tabs on other crew members report any dead bodies immediately

2350
02:22:01,220 --> 02:22:06,740
to start discussion who they suspected the imposter is imposters was to kill the crewmates

2351
02:22:06,740 --> 02:22:10,900
or frame bystanders. Pretend to run tasks and blended with crewmates. You can sneak through

2352
02:22:10,900 --> 02:22:16,260
events to move quickly through the ship and sabotage to cause chaos and divide the crew

2353
02:22:16,260 --> 02:22:24,020
closed doors to trap victims and kill in private. So sounds fun. All right, cross play between

2354
02:22:24,020 --> 02:22:29,780
apparently it is on mobile, so Android and iOS. And it's cross played between that and PC. So it

2355
02:22:29,780 --> 02:22:36,660
looks pretty cool. All right, I'm gonna have to check this game out at some point. It sounds like

2356
02:22:36,660 --> 02:22:41,380
I've been missing out. And I'm always late to the party on this shit. I thought I was cool. And I

2357
02:22:41,380 --> 02:22:46,580
kind of discovered fall guys early like everybody else. But now it seems like fall guys has already

2358
02:22:46,580 --> 02:22:51,300
fallen to number two or three on the rankings. Because now there's this new kid in town. So

2359
02:22:51,300 --> 02:22:57,060
yeah, be interesting. All right, let's move on. These updates are somewhat controversial,

2360
02:22:57,060 --> 02:23:04,100
right? Loki because they're coming from a hack that probably should not have happened. I just

2361
02:23:04,100 --> 02:23:10,180
just so you know where my head is at with OLR. We are talking about video games, gaming culture,

2362
02:23:10,180 --> 02:23:17,060
and your lifestyle. And I think whether we like it or not, this happened. And people are talking

2363
02:23:17,060 --> 02:23:22,740
about it. And it's on gaming blogs. It's on news. It's on social media. So I'm bringing it to

2364
02:23:23,300 --> 02:23:28,260
the dinner table or Loki's bringing it to the dinner table tonight. And it is more things that

2365
02:23:28,260 --> 02:23:33,060
have come out of that Nintendo hack. Yeah, so there's more stuff coming out of this tag. They

2366
02:23:33,060 --> 02:23:39,540
call it Giga leak three or whatever. So and they said basically, it evolves a huge lot check. Who's

2367
02:23:39,540 --> 02:23:46,900
they? 4chan, right? Or probably 4chan. Okay. Whoever whoever was that hacked everything and

2368
02:23:46,900 --> 02:23:51,380
got a list. But it's a dump of like Gameboy and Gameboy Color games that were either finished

2369
02:23:51,380 --> 02:23:56,340
or close to being finished and sent off to Nintendo for internal certification. But a

2370
02:23:56,340 --> 02:24:01,380
lot of these games never made it out. So for example, one of the games that was part of the

2371
02:24:01,380 --> 02:24:09,460
hack was Pokemon Picross, which was cancelled game from 1999. So it kind of neat there is a

2372
02:24:09,460 --> 02:24:15,220
gimmick land tomato adventure for the Gameboy Color. There's some Hello Kitty pocket camera

2373
02:24:15,220 --> 02:24:22,100
game for the Gameboy Camera. That's interesting. There is a rock board, which is a game that came

2374
02:24:22,100 --> 02:24:26,260
out on the Famicom as Mega Man board game. But there's also currently a Gameboy version that

2375
02:24:26,260 --> 02:24:33,780
leaked out lots of different games theory because the break man says, so it's a bunch of bad games.

2376
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:37,940
Well, I mean, the Rockman board game might have been some up some people's alley. And I think

2377
02:24:37,940 --> 02:24:42,660
those Picross games tend to do well. And I think the idea of a Pokemon Picross sounds really cute.

2378
02:24:42,660 --> 02:24:46,980
But the problem, quote unquote, with some of these games is that they were relatively

2379
02:24:46,980 --> 02:24:52,260
late in the Gameboy cycle, right? So it was kind of like, it was not felt the money was

2380
02:24:52,260 --> 02:24:57,140
I mean, we're guessing, sorry, we're theorizing that the reason why they didn't come out was that

2381
02:24:57,140 --> 02:25:02,500
probably Nintendo did not feel it was worth the money to publish, make the cartridges,

2382
02:25:02,500 --> 02:25:06,340
do the advertising campaign, because there was no digital release back then, right? They couldn't

2383
02:25:06,420 --> 02:25:12,580
just release Pokemon Picross digitally, they could now. But they are probably not going to.

2384
02:25:13,700 --> 02:25:18,020
And, you know, because a lot of the Picross games they released digitally now at this point,

2385
02:25:18,020 --> 02:25:21,220
so it wasn't really felt in their best interest, because they were probably moving on to the

2386
02:25:21,220 --> 02:25:26,900
advance and those sorts of things. So it's, um, but I don't necessarily think the games

2387
02:25:26,900 --> 02:25:32,580
looked bad. I mean, the Hello Kitty camera thing is probably a cash in of sorts.

2388
02:25:33,460 --> 02:25:38,900
So like, so if you're interested, check this out. There's a user on Twitch, Luigi blood

2389
02:25:38,900 --> 02:25:44,260
that streamed a three hour long stream, showing off some of these ROMs. So one of the games that

2390
02:25:44,260 --> 02:25:49,220
I'm looking at here almost looks like Star Fox, but it's on the Gameboy, which is kind of crazy.

2391
02:25:49,220 --> 02:25:53,380
So it's almost like vector graphics and stuff. And I'm being corrected by Bobby and chat who

2392
02:25:53,380 --> 02:25:59,620
loves his Picross. It's how I got introduced to Picross Pokemon Picross was on the 3ds.

2393
02:25:59,700 --> 02:26:05,540
It was a free to play game on the 3ds. Well, I, so they may have taken some of the same concepts

2394
02:26:05,540 --> 02:26:10,660
and then reintroduced it later on. So maybe at one point it was this standalone Gameboy color game

2395
02:26:10,660 --> 02:26:15,460
and Nintendo took, I would be curious if some of the designs and things ended up carrying over and

2396
02:26:15,460 --> 02:26:20,180
being the same probably was so Nintendo probably just carried some of it over to the 3ds. So

2397
02:26:20,180 --> 02:26:25,940
that's very interesting. Yeah. There's lots of interesting looking games here, but, um,

2398
02:26:26,660 --> 02:26:29,940
yeah, like I said, you know, if you're interested in checking out, I mean, it's, it's all over

2399
02:26:29,940 --> 02:26:34,580
Twitter and all over, um, it looks like it's at least on Twitch a little bit. So, yeah,

2400
02:26:35,620 --> 02:26:38,740
some of these look kind of cool. It's that weird gray area where it's like,

2401
02:26:38,740 --> 02:26:43,780
it's a part of gaming history, but it also isn't, it wasn't really meant to ever be discovered. So

2402
02:26:44,500 --> 02:26:49,780
I, I don't know, it's a really weird space. I kind of think ultimately these games are going

2403
02:26:49,780 --> 02:26:54,020
to be talked about and buzzed about for a week. And then the internet is going to move on to

2404
02:26:54,020 --> 02:26:58,020
something else because that's what usually happens. It will be interesting to see the

2405
02:26:58,020 --> 02:27:05,140
approach that historians kind of take, but I don't think that they really can like archive

2406
02:27:05,140 --> 02:27:10,100
these actual games because they were never really released, but it would be an interesting chapter

2407
02:27:10,100 --> 02:27:15,860
in a book somewhere. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know how the historians perspective on this.

2408
02:27:15,860 --> 02:27:21,380
I'd really like to invite one on the show and ask, how do you, what, what is you, what is your angle

2409
02:27:21,380 --> 02:27:26,820
with these leaks? Because technically it's all illegal, but it is a part of gaming history.

2410
02:27:26,820 --> 02:27:33,940
How do you file this away? I don't know. I don't know either. It's, it's, it's complicated. That's,

2411
02:27:33,940 --> 02:27:37,860
that's the answer. All right. I know at least like, especially like the emulation scene and

2412
02:27:37,860 --> 02:27:42,180
stuff, there's not a lot that they could do with some of the code and stuff that I remember,

2413
02:27:42,180 --> 02:27:45,460
because like the previous leaks, they have like the official emulators that were on,

2414
02:27:46,420 --> 02:27:53,060
you know, the DS or, you know, the Wii. So they can't really use that for their code

2415
02:27:53,060 --> 02:27:58,420
because they would get in trouble with that. Right. Cause then, then you cross lines from

2416
02:27:58,420 --> 02:28:03,060
it's legal cause you don't have any, you know, commercial ROMs or whatever with it too.

2417
02:28:03,060 --> 02:28:09,140
It's illegal cause you stole it. So yeah, emulator teams have to very much keep themselves

2418
02:28:09,140 --> 02:28:12,180
siloed from this stuff. And that's come up before when we talked about, you know,

2419
02:28:12,180 --> 02:28:17,380
I think the PlayStation, was it the PlayStation mini hack? I think was a part of that or something.

2420
02:28:18,500 --> 02:28:24,340
No, not necessarily with that, but yeah, there's like, I think it was with the DS and the 3DS.

2421
02:28:24,340 --> 02:28:29,140
They had like some hacks with the software for those. Right. All right. Well, moving on to

2422
02:28:29,140 --> 02:28:35,540
something in a little less of a gray area, this is something I think old school fans of this program

2423
02:28:35,540 --> 02:28:39,940
and old school music game fans and new school music game fans will be very excited about. And

2424
02:28:39,940 --> 02:28:43,860
I'm ending the show tonight on a music game. Well, getting to the end of the show tonight on

2425
02:28:43,860 --> 02:28:49,860
a music game related story, and it is the game series, pop and music. And Konami has announced

2426
02:28:49,860 --> 02:28:55,780
yet again, another Bamani series for PC, and it is pop and music, and it's going to be called pop

2427
02:28:55,780 --> 02:29:02,500
and music lively. If you're unfamiliar with pop and music, it is a nine button game. There's five

2428
02:29:02,500 --> 02:29:07,060
in the front, four in the back, and you kind of hit the buttons in line with the music. And these

2429
02:29:07,060 --> 02:29:10,900
are giant buttons. If you ever see an arcade machine in an anime convention or something,

2430
02:29:11,940 --> 02:29:15,620
I always say it's trouble with the pop-o-matic bubble. You know that game with the dice in the

2431
02:29:15,620 --> 02:29:19,460
middle and you hit that. It's like that, but nine of those that are like the buttons that control

2432
02:29:19,460 --> 02:29:23,940
the game. It's a lot of fun to play, but it can't hurt your hands. And it will probably be a lot

2433
02:29:23,940 --> 02:29:30,900
easier on a mechanical keyboard where you're not going to hurt your hands so much. There is a beta

2434
02:29:30,900 --> 02:29:36,980
with five limited time songs in this limited time beta. There are five songs. They are all Japanese

2435
02:29:37,860 --> 02:29:44,180
pop and music games, including pop and music 17, 18, 20, Lapistoria, and pop and music peace.

2436
02:29:44,180 --> 02:29:49,700
So there's just one song selection from those different games. You do have to have a Konami

2437
02:29:49,700 --> 02:29:55,460
account to participate in the beta, and it is on Konami's website. I haven't played it myself.

2438
02:29:55,460 --> 02:29:59,780
I'm just imagining it's all in Japanese at this time, as most of these releases have been.

2439
02:30:00,580 --> 02:30:06,580
But my.konami.net is the place to start, and the beta client is on Japanese website. So you

2440
02:30:06,900 --> 02:30:11,140
will have to have some type of understanding of Japanese to probably get through the game,

2441
02:30:11,140 --> 02:30:15,940
although I'm sure there's going to be guides online somewhere. Dark Tetsuya says,

2442
02:30:15,940 --> 02:30:20,820
admittedly, I really only played pop and once on console back when we all got together to play that

2443
02:30:20,820 --> 02:30:25,380
stuff. But if this ever gets an official release, I'd be down. Yeah, I hope it makes its way here

2444
02:30:26,180 --> 02:30:30,340
stateside. I've played it in the arcade. Conventions are a great way to keep playing

2445
02:30:30,340 --> 02:30:34,580
the game. And round one, you usually will still see at least one pop and music machine at around

2446
02:30:34,580 --> 02:30:39,220
one somewhere. It might not be in the front with the other stuff, but it'll be around there. And

2447
02:30:39,940 --> 02:30:45,300
it's a fun game to play. And you got to learn to play nine button mode. Just go straight into nine

2448
02:30:45,300 --> 02:30:52,340
buttons. It's so much more fun that way. Right, Logie? I was never very good at music to play

2449
02:30:52,340 --> 02:30:58,740
with nine buttons. All right. I think I've tried. Let's move on. This is the part where you guys

2450
02:30:58,740 --> 02:31:02,980
get to have more of your voices on the show. We've been reading some of your chat comments all night.

2451
02:31:02,980 --> 02:31:07,540
But if you have something you'd like to add, please ask away in our chat room over twitch.tv

2452
02:31:07,540 --> 02:31:14,420
slash vog network. That's twitch.tv slash vog network as we are taping along live with our show.

2453
02:31:16,740 --> 02:31:20,820
But I have some emails to get to during the segment as well. Every week, you guys can email us.

2454
02:31:20,820 --> 02:31:26,260
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com and we read some of the emails on the show. So we do have two

2455
02:31:26,260 --> 02:31:32,100
emails tonight. Let me get to our first email, which is from Robert M that says, I'm also

2456
02:31:32,100 --> 02:31:36,340
surprised you hadn't covered Street Fighter 2 the World Warriors for the game of the week. And that

2457
02:31:36,340 --> 02:31:41,940
was the classic game two weeks ago before on our last episode, if you recall. Listening when the

2458
02:31:41,940 --> 02:31:46,900
episode aired on the 30th reminded me how the title theme is always connected in my mind with

2459
02:31:46,900 --> 02:31:53,300
the taste of shock tarts. It's been ages since I've tried to hunt down the candy. That is a very

2460
02:31:53,300 --> 02:31:59,860
interesting association. Are there any video games you associate with food, Logie? I'm trying to

2461
02:31:59,860 --> 02:32:07,460
think if I have associated anything with food. I mean, food that I eat or just food in general.

2462
02:32:07,460 --> 02:32:12,980
I mean, really the only food that you eat, like Street Fighter 2 reminds Robert M of shock tarts.

2463
02:32:13,860 --> 02:32:27,300
Oh, no, not really. I mean, I can say vaguely Halloween candy reminds me of Super Mario 3

2464
02:32:27,380 --> 02:32:32,020
because the night one of my good friends at the time and I stayed up all night long,

2465
02:32:32,580 --> 02:32:37,220
literally all night long playing Super Mario Brothers 3 was on Halloween and we were going

2466
02:32:37,220 --> 02:32:44,340
through Halloween candy like crazy and eating it and playing Mario Brothers 3. So that would be an

2467
02:32:44,340 --> 02:32:50,820
association I have. Dark Tetsuya says, I have one mechanized attack on NES and pepperoni pizza

2468
02:32:50,820 --> 02:32:56,660
combos. No one special says, I pretty much associate any retro arcade game with pizza and

2469
02:32:56,660 --> 02:33:04,740
Pepsi. The break man says, Turkey reminds me of Final Fantasy 3. I love that. She-Hulk 10 says,

2470
02:33:04,740 --> 02:33:11,540
Donkey Kong and bananas. Why not? In Donkey Kong country, you're collecting a ton of them. Why not?

2471
02:33:12,180 --> 02:33:18,500
All right. Let me finish the email here. Robert M continues saying, also, if you're shouting out

2472
02:33:18,500 --> 02:33:27,460
New Horizons dream addresses, mine is DA572727801688. And if you need that again,

2473
02:33:27,460 --> 02:33:34,100
just hit that 15 seconds backward on your player. I believe if the Sakura of Koholint is Jamie,

2474
02:33:34,100 --> 02:33:39,700
I visited last month. It is. And so, yes, you did visit. From what I can remember, really nice. And

2475
02:33:39,700 --> 02:33:42,980
that's from Robert M. And I will have to check out your town at some point, Robert M.

2476
02:33:42,980 --> 02:33:47,540
So the dream codes that they have, because I know like if you visit other towns, like you get more

2477
02:33:47,540 --> 02:33:52,260
stuff in your nook shop, because we're trying to get more stuff in our nook shop because it's the

2478
02:33:52,260 --> 02:33:55,940
same old items that keep cycling through. And I think if you visit other islands, you get more

2479
02:33:55,940 --> 02:34:01,620
stuff. Do you know if that works with the dream stuff? I would probably not. I don't know.

2480
02:34:01,620 --> 02:34:07,300
I haven't a clue. All right. You got to ask Jamie. She's the Animal Crossing guru.

2481
02:34:08,260 --> 02:34:13,620
Yep. All right. A quick note from our chat room before we get to our next email for the round

2482
02:34:13,620 --> 02:34:20,500
table here. SSJ100Matt says, Magfest met their 100K donation goal during the show. Earlier this

2483
02:34:20,500 --> 02:34:25,060
week, they decided to cancel next year's show without force majeure, meaning they were on the

2484
02:34:25,060 --> 02:34:29,060
hook for costs. But thankfully, they met their goal. Well, congratulations to Magfest. Yeah,

2485
02:34:29,060 --> 02:34:34,740
we hadn't gotten to that during the show tonight yet. But they did cancel Magfest for January of

2486
02:34:34,740 --> 02:34:41,540
next year. Obviously, the COVID situation is not going to go away that easy. So even though we may

2487
02:34:41,540 --> 02:34:46,020
be at a point where we can hang out in small groups, at that point, a big convention is

2488
02:34:46,020 --> 02:34:50,900
probably still not going to be doable in January. But the big deal is they went ahead and canceled

2489
02:34:50,900 --> 02:34:54,340
and they didn't wait for the legal force majeure thing. So they kind of had to raise money to save

2490
02:34:54,340 --> 02:34:59,380
Magfest, basically. So they did a telethon and it was still going tonight during the show. And it

2491
02:34:59,380 --> 02:35:03,140
sounds like they made their money. So congratulations. That's great. Bobby Blackwolf is

2492
02:35:03,140 --> 02:35:09,460
reminding AGDQ is also going virtual. Little bit of a different situation. They hadn't actually

2493
02:35:09,460 --> 02:35:14,580
announced a hotel or booked a hotel yet. So they're not having to worry about the fact that

2494
02:35:14,580 --> 02:35:19,460
they canceled on anybody. But they are going ahead and making the call that it's going to be virtual.

2495
02:35:19,460 --> 02:35:25,060
So that's two things now in 2021 that are now going to be virtual. And I would expect it's

2496
02:35:25,060 --> 02:35:29,620
probably still going to be a few months into 2021 before we really start seeing big events again.

2497
02:35:30,180 --> 02:35:34,340
It's probably going to be at least March, right? Get through this thing a year. But we'll see.

2498
02:35:34,980 --> 02:35:41,860
And Bobby says they'll still use a hotel as the main command center, though, in Virginia,

2499
02:35:41,860 --> 02:35:49,940
which they did for summer games done quick. So interesting. Also, virtual packs is going on

2500
02:35:49,940 --> 02:35:56,740
right now. I'm kind of confused as to what is going on when. They have like three different

2501
02:35:56,740 --> 02:36:01,460
rooms. And at the bottom of the page does not list the schedule for what's going on.

2502
02:36:02,100 --> 02:36:06,900
But I tuned into some random stuff and I saw somebody I knew on one of the panels. So that

2503
02:36:06,900 --> 02:36:11,860
was kind of fun. I was like, oh, her. I know her. So it was kind of interesting. But it looks like

2504
02:36:11,860 --> 02:36:16,340
they're doing the virtual panel stuff for PAX right now. But have we gotten any game developer

2505
02:36:16,340 --> 02:36:22,980
companies doing announcements like they sometimes would at PAX? Well, I know, was it that there was

2506
02:36:22,980 --> 02:36:27,860
stuff about Borderlands 3 that Gearbox was talking about? Oh, the multiplayer stuff, right?

2507
02:36:28,820 --> 02:36:32,500
On the same screen on PlayStation five, right? Right, right, right. So PlayStation five and

2508
02:36:32,500 --> 02:36:37,700
Xbox Series X, they're going to have four player split screen and then they're going to also do 4K

2509
02:36:37,700 --> 02:36:46,500
60 FPS, I think, on for single player if you do that. So that's that's kind of cool. And

2510
02:36:46,500 --> 02:36:50,980
apparently also there's going to be a vertical split screen options coming as well to current

2511
02:36:50,980 --> 02:36:56,660
generation games. And apparently they're going to be allowing you to transition. You're going to

2512
02:36:56,660 --> 02:37:02,100
have all your add on content and save files will be supported in the transition as well to the next

2513
02:37:02,100 --> 02:37:08,180
chance. All right. Well, let's do all I've heard so far. Let's do one more email tonight from Yyr

2514
02:37:08,180 --> 02:37:12,820
who says, Hello, LR. On the last episode of the show, there was a bit of confusion as far as the

2515
02:37:12,820 --> 02:37:17,700
way Nintendo handles their digital game licenses. Not that anyone can be blamed. After all, for many

2516
02:37:17,700 --> 02:37:21,780
years, Nintendo's way of handling a digital purchase was to simply assign the license to

2517
02:37:21,780 --> 02:37:26,500
the device on which you purchased the game. However, and fortunately, this policy ended with

2518
02:37:26,500 --> 02:37:31,700
the Wii U and the 3DS. Beginning with Nintendo Switch, licenses are assigned not to your device,

2519
02:37:31,700 --> 02:37:38,500
but to your Nintendo account. Pardon me. As long as you have access to your account, you'll be able

2520
02:37:38,500 --> 02:37:43,860
to redownload your games on any Nintendo Switch. You can assign any single Switch console as the

2521
02:37:43,860 --> 02:37:48,900
primary console on your account, and any user of that primary console can access your downloaded

2522
02:37:48,900 --> 02:37:54,260
content. But you can also access your games from any Switch console that you're logged into,

2523
02:37:54,260 --> 02:37:59,540
regardless of whether it's a primary console. This is actually very similar to the way licenses work

2524
02:37:59,540 --> 02:38:04,740
on Xbox. Thank you for clarifying. Yes, it is complicated because Nintendo's done it several

2525
02:38:04,740 --> 02:38:10,100
different ways. So thank you. I'm looking forward to your opinions and analysis on Microsoft's

2526
02:38:10,100 --> 02:38:15,540
announcements this week. I find the Xbox Series S console to be particularly interesting because

2527
02:38:15,540 --> 02:38:20,020
I'm trying to figure out its target audience, possibly consumers who want to play the newest

2528
02:38:20,020 --> 02:38:24,580
games, who don't care about physical copies anymore, who want to save some money, and who

2529
02:38:24,580 --> 02:38:30,180
also don't care much about 4K resolution or 60 frames a second performance. The real question is

2530
02:38:30,180 --> 02:38:35,140
how many folks fit into those categories? Thanks again for the show and have a great week. Why YR?

2531
02:38:35,940 --> 02:38:41,060
Kind of go back to that again. I think it's mainly it's folks trying to game on a budget right now

2532
02:38:41,060 --> 02:38:47,940
because it's why, you know, there's a market for PCs out there, especially like laptops and stuff

2533
02:38:47,940 --> 02:38:54,260
that are mid tier, I guess, if you will. Like not everybody buys a two thousand dollar gaming PC

2534
02:38:55,140 --> 02:39:01,540
to game on. They have graphics cards out there that aren't like the top of the line for stuff.

2535
02:39:01,540 --> 02:39:05,860
I mean, they just released a whole new series of like the Nvidia 3000 cards or whatever, and they

2536
02:39:05,860 --> 02:39:10,820
have like it's getting more powerful even on those lower tier cards. But not everybody has

2537
02:39:10,820 --> 02:39:16,900
to purchase like the top of the line stuff to game. And that's why even 1440p is still really

2538
02:39:16,900 --> 02:39:22,180
good. Yeah, it's going to look great. Even upscale the 4K is still going to look really good. It's

2539
02:39:22,180 --> 02:39:27,540
great. It's not like the best it could be, but maybe you don't care that it's the best it can be.

2540
02:39:28,820 --> 02:39:33,540
And that's what you're wanting to get in honor. You maybe you're buying it for your kids. You

2541
02:39:33,540 --> 02:39:39,060
don't want to drop that kind of money. So like I I think it's still a very they're going with

2542
02:39:39,060 --> 02:39:44,820
the value proposition there because that bundle of games pass is a really good deal. You're

2543
02:39:44,820 --> 02:39:49,700
getting, you know, really good graphics, you know, all the next gen games at launch, you know,

2544
02:39:49,700 --> 02:39:55,220
from first party next gen games. And you have a library of like 100 plus games to play. I mean,

2545
02:39:55,220 --> 02:40:01,860
like that's a really good, easy sell for $299. I think in my opinion and the probably the shortest

2546
02:40:01,860 --> 02:40:08,580
way I can put it is that the Xbox Series X is a living room console. The Xbox Series S

2547
02:40:08,660 --> 02:40:15,380
is a bedroom console. And it's not going to be that, you know, X, Y, Z, X and S for everybody.

2548
02:40:15,380 --> 02:40:22,660
It's not going to be that binary for everybody. Nothing is. But I think generally, that's kind

2549
02:40:22,660 --> 02:40:26,260
of what it breaks down to. If it's kind of like the household secondary console or whatever,

2550
02:40:26,260 --> 02:40:31,540
a bedroom console or kids console, it's the S is going to be just fine. It's still there's still

2551
02:40:31,540 --> 02:40:36,340
a lot it's going to be capable of doing. But if it's meant to be a beefy powerhouse 4K,

2552
02:40:37,300 --> 02:40:42,340
Bobby Black Wolf's basement theater type of thing, like Bobby Black Wolf is not going to waste his

2553
02:40:42,340 --> 02:40:48,180
time with the Series S. He's going to get the Series X for that setup. That's fine, too. Like,

2554
02:40:48,180 --> 02:40:54,260
I was like looking at replacing one of my monitors or I may have to be both of them to replace it

2555
02:40:54,260 --> 02:41:01,700
with a 4K monitor to 120 frames per second. I'm not going to be able to do that relatively easy.

2556
02:41:01,700 --> 02:41:08,740
So, you know, that might be something that would weigh in whether I get an S or an X. Also,

2557
02:41:10,500 --> 02:41:13,860
I don't know when these are going to be available or if they're going to be available or how fast

2558
02:41:13,860 --> 02:41:17,300
they're going to sell out. So, let's see. All right. Let me get to one more roundtable

2559
02:41:17,300 --> 02:41:20,820
question from chat and then I want to get to any last minute stories you might have tonight.

2560
02:41:20,820 --> 02:41:23,620
Thank you for the emails, by the way. More emails if you want to send them,

2561
02:41:23,620 --> 02:41:29,700
participate at orangelaunchradio.com. Last comment here from noinspecial77 who says,

2562
02:41:29,700 --> 02:41:34,900
I personally think that 1UP Arcade Machines are okay cheap alternatives to actual arcade machines.

2563
02:41:34,900 --> 02:41:38,740
They're not quite as good because you can't drop quarters and tokens into them. And most

2564
02:41:38,740 --> 02:41:44,820
retro games used CRT monitors, not modern displays like a 1UP Arcade Machines. So, given the choice,

2565
02:41:44,820 --> 02:41:49,860
I'd get the honest to goodness retro machine. That said, would you get the retro machine or

2566
02:41:49,860 --> 02:41:58,100
is 1UP Arcade Machines good enough, quote unquote. I think you kind of said it. It just depends on

2567
02:41:58,100 --> 02:42:05,140
what you're looking for. If you are looking for that authentic, reminds me of the pizza place I

2568
02:42:05,140 --> 02:42:12,020
had growing up, I'm okay with dropping tokens or having that whole system in my house, then the old

2569
02:42:12,020 --> 02:42:16,500
school machine is a fine way to go. And I think you make a good point with the CRTs. You're going

2570
02:42:16,500 --> 02:42:23,220
to have a hard time. Well, you can probably find secondary CRTs. They're just, they're not as

2571
02:42:23,220 --> 02:42:30,020
plentiful as they once were. No, they are not. As a person that is speaking with an arcade cabinet

2572
02:42:30,020 --> 02:42:36,260
that has a broken CRT right now, it is not easy to find and they're not easy to repair and they're

2573
02:42:36,260 --> 02:42:42,260
not easy to replace. And they're, they weigh a ton. Like it would probably, I seriously am

2574
02:42:42,260 --> 02:42:49,380
considering replacing it with an LCD screen because even though like I get it, like the old

2575
02:42:49,380 --> 02:42:56,260
low-res screens look pretty nice and stuff, but like I think I can live with it not looking as

2576
02:42:56,260 --> 02:42:59,860
perfect as it used to be. I mean, there's so much more you can do with it. And just like,

2577
02:42:59,860 --> 02:43:03,220
especially if you're going to monitor or something, it makes it so much easier.

2578
02:43:05,220 --> 02:43:11,060
I like, I don't know. I like my machine. I like the arcade 1UP machine. I have the burger time

2579
02:43:11,060 --> 02:43:17,940
one. I like it. The display, I like that it's a little brighter and crisper and is it authentic?

2580
02:43:18,740 --> 02:43:22,900
No, but it's authentic enough, you know, for the price I paid for it.

2581
02:43:24,820 --> 02:43:30,340
Yeah. It would be nice if, if it was, they were still making CRTs, it would be nice to be able

2582
02:43:30,340 --> 02:43:36,420
to replace it. But like at this point you have to find somebody that has one and it, that's probably

2583
02:43:36,420 --> 02:43:41,940
going to be at least like 500 plus dollars, maybe a thousand dollars to replace it. And it's still

2584
02:43:41,940 --> 02:43:46,340
going to be used and it's still going to, you may have burn-in and all that stuff. Like mine has

2585
02:43:46,580 --> 02:43:49,860
burn-in on it. You don't really notice it when you're playing it, but like,

2586
02:43:50,420 --> 02:43:55,380
like, I don't know how to fix it. It's broken. And, you know, you're talking about high voltage

2587
02:43:55,380 --> 02:44:02,180
and stuff in there. Like I'm kind of scared to try to fix it. So like, you know, I just rather

2588
02:44:02,180 --> 02:44:06,420
not mess with it. Rather just would have, it would have been nice just to have an LCD in there and

2589
02:44:06,420 --> 02:44:12,900
then, you know, your place it for like quarter of the price. All right. Well, good question.

2590
02:44:13,540 --> 02:44:17,140
Anyhow, before we get to wrapping up the show tonight, do we have any last minute stories,

2591
02:44:17,140 --> 02:44:22,180
Loki? Yeah, we have a few things to talk about. So a lot of this happened a little bit earlier.

2592
02:44:23,140 --> 02:44:33,460
So EA did some fuckery earlier in the week. So they had added ads in a full screen ads in UFC 4

2593
02:44:34,260 --> 02:44:40,580
for the boys. So there was an ad campaign there. They, they also reskinned some of the stuff in the

2594
02:44:40,660 --> 02:44:45,460
actual arena advertising it, but people got really pissed off about it and they eventually took it

2595
02:44:45,460 --> 02:44:50,020
out. This isn't the first time they've done that though. In fact, they also patched it into EA

2596
02:44:50,020 --> 02:44:56,500
sports, UFC three. They've also tested this in the past as well, just to kind of see response,

2597
02:44:56,500 --> 02:45:00,580
but apparently people didn't like it. I think what happened was is they pulled it out for after

2598
02:45:00,580 --> 02:45:05,140
they got done with their ad campaign because the boys has already launched on Amazon. So

2599
02:45:06,100 --> 02:45:12,980
it doesn't make sense to have ads in it anymore for that, but whatever. But it's EA B and EA.

2600
02:45:12,980 --> 02:45:18,740
Speaking of also more things that are just impossible to do. So you may remember we talked

2601
02:45:18,740 --> 02:45:22,900
about control and five Oh five games and how that they're not going to allow you to have a free path

2602
02:45:22,900 --> 02:45:28,580
to upgrade your existing copies of control because they say it's impossible. We just cannot do that

2603
02:45:28,580 --> 02:45:32,900
because the way of the game, the way the game works. So they're basically saying that in order

2604
02:45:32,900 --> 02:45:37,940
to get the Xbox series X or PlayStation five versions, you have to purchase the ultimate

2605
02:45:37,940 --> 02:45:45,700
edition. So here's the funny part though, that you know what's coming. So apparently earlier this

2606
02:45:45,700 --> 02:45:54,580
week folks that owned copies of the original game and also the DLCs or the season pass notes that

2607
02:45:54,580 --> 02:46:01,460
they also had a free upgrade deluxe edition that was available to download for free.

2608
02:46:01,460 --> 02:46:06,820
That was already attached to their account. So they had noticed that, well, Hey, wait a second.

2609
02:46:06,820 --> 02:46:14,020
I already have this as it is. So, so what the heck? And so apparently five of five games had

2610
02:46:14,020 --> 02:46:19,220
accidentally flipped that switch, but then they realized what they did. And so they revoked it and

2611
02:46:20,580 --> 02:46:28,020
retracted all those. Oh dear. So, so apparently no, it is not impossible to allow you to upgrade

2612
02:46:28,020 --> 02:46:34,340
for free. They're just not wanting to do that. They want to charge you again for the game. So

2613
02:46:34,340 --> 02:46:38,500
just be honest and just come out and say it. But of course they haven't made any sort of

2614
02:46:38,500 --> 02:46:47,460
comment about it, but yeah, it's interesting. Interesting. What a mess. Yeah. Anything else?

2615
02:46:48,740 --> 02:46:55,540
Um, that's pretty much it. All right. Well, that brings us to the end of another episode of orange

2616
02:46:55,540 --> 02:46:59,460
lounge radio. Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show tonight, whether you were listening

2617
02:46:59,460 --> 02:47:06,340
live or on the podcast feed, a new episodes always available at vog network.com VOG network.com.

2618
02:47:06,340 --> 02:47:13,380
And also most places where podcasts are available, such as iTunes, Google play, Spotify, uh, orange

2619
02:47:13,380 --> 02:47:18,580
Ontario available, all those places. Uh, so, uh, if you liked what you heard here at the show,

2620
02:47:18,580 --> 02:47:22,580
help us spread the word, leave a nice five star review or tell a friend about orange

2621
02:47:22,580 --> 02:47:27,060
lounge radio, because the more voices that we have here in chat, the more gamer voices and

2622
02:47:27,060 --> 02:47:32,180
opinions and all that good stuff we can get out there in the world. Um, you can continue the

2623
02:47:32,180 --> 02:47:37,540
conversation in our discord server. If you like vog network.com slash discord, we'll get you into

2624
02:47:37,540 --> 02:47:41,540
our discord server where, uh, many folks share stories. And sometimes we discuss some of the

2625
02:47:41,540 --> 02:47:46,100
things, uh, throughout the week. I'm sure there'll be a lot of reaction to the Sony conference this

2626
02:47:46,100 --> 02:47:50,580
week. So I'm looking forward to talking about that on the next episode of OLR. Um, I have to

2627
02:47:50,580 --> 02:47:56,340
get some friends together, uh, at vog, uh, this week to talk about it after it happens. And then

2628
02:47:56,340 --> 02:47:59,540
we'll talk about it on OLR as well. So I'm sure there's gonna be a lot of thoughts with the Sony

2629
02:47:59,540 --> 02:48:04,660
conference. Um, so we'll get into that at some point. Um, and yeah, we'll be back in seven days

2630
02:48:04,660 --> 02:48:10,820
to do it again. Um, Oh, and also a shout out for Twitch and, uh, everybody that, um, subbed gave

2631
02:48:10,820 --> 02:48:14,740
bits, uh, all that good stuff tonight. Thank you. Thank you so much for all that. Um, I'll,

2632
02:48:14,740 --> 02:48:19,220
I'll read you guys out after the show here in a minute. Um, but I also want to say those,

2633
02:48:19,220 --> 02:48:24,100
you guys that host us and I'm really bummed Twitch doesn't show us a list of who is hosting

2634
02:48:24,100 --> 02:48:28,420
us. So I can't thank you individually, but, um, just know that I really appreciate it. I know

2635
02:48:28,420 --> 02:48:34,100
some people do. And, uh, those auto hosts on Twitch go a long way in helping to, uh, show

2636
02:48:34,100 --> 02:48:40,500
that we're live to more people. So I really, really appreciate that stuff. So, um, yeah. Uh,

2637
02:48:40,500 --> 02:48:45,460
that is going to do it for another episode of orange lounge radio. Uh, let's get final

2638
02:48:45,460 --> 02:48:50,740
thoughts for tonight. Uh, Loki, you have any final thoughts tonight? Um, I was going to say

2639
02:48:50,740 --> 02:48:56,020
like they have replacement LCD panels that you can get, but they're super expensive if you want them

2640
02:48:56,020 --> 02:49:02,660
like the old CRTs, the four by three ones. Um, so aside from the arcade cabinet stuff, uh,

2641
02:49:02,660 --> 02:49:07,460
still gonna be working on them on games. So maybe I'll play some more stuff this week.

2642
02:49:07,460 --> 02:49:15,780
Not even a hint. No. All right. Um, so are there any games that are on your radar to try to get

2643
02:49:15,780 --> 02:49:22,980
to this week? Um, I'll probably play, I haven't played super Mario sunshine. So when I get the

2644
02:49:22,980 --> 02:49:29,300
3d collection, I'll have to try that out. Um, I don't know. Like I've got a lot of things I

2645
02:49:29,300 --> 02:49:35,380
need to play. I may play more hotshot racing. Um, yeah, I don't know. I need to stream some more.

2646
02:49:38,420 --> 02:49:46,020
All right. Um, and then my final thought for tonight is, um, I'm excited to get all my

2647
02:49:46,020 --> 02:49:52,260
crafting jobs in, uh, final fantasy to 60, which is probably going to happen. If not tonight,

2648
02:49:52,260 --> 02:49:58,100
then I'll probably happen tomorrow. Um, and then, um, I I'm looking forward to playing more of, uh,

2649
02:49:58,100 --> 02:50:03,300
Avicii and some of the other, uh, games out there in my backlog. I have a lot, I still want to go

2650
02:50:03,380 --> 02:50:09,060
back and play more no man's sky. I want to play that fricking. Um, I see VG realness Delvin

2651
02:50:09,060 --> 02:50:13,540
playing this all the time on his channel spell break. So what it's called the, the Fortnite with

2652
02:50:13,540 --> 02:50:22,180
magicians. I've yeah, I watched. Okay. So earlier in the week, I there's, um, I'm sure a lot of you

2653
02:50:22,180 --> 02:50:27,060
are familiar with the oral knots. They do a bunch of like funny, like star Wars videos and stuff

2654
02:50:27,060 --> 02:50:33,300
like that. Um, so they have this character that they do creepy. Oh, that's like a C3 PO,

2655
02:50:33,300 --> 02:50:37,940
but it's pretty funny. Um, so they had their character creepy out playing that game and it

2656
02:50:37,940 --> 02:50:45,300
looked interesting. Um, definitely a game I I'd like maybe to check out, but, uh, their stream

2657
02:50:45,300 --> 02:50:51,140
is pretty funny. I didn't know they actually streamed stuff. So it was pretty cool. All right.

2658
02:50:51,140 --> 02:50:55,700
Well, we're going to, uh, roll credits and be done here for another episode of orange launch radio.

2659
02:50:55,700 --> 02:50:59,940
