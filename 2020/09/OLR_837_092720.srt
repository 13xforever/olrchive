starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,280
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,320
where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:54,840
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back once again on this Sunday, September the 27th

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,920
of 2020 with episode number 837 of our show.

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,120
My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined not tonight by DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,120
She has the night off as it is Yom Kippur today and so I hope all of our listeners who

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,520
are partaking in that are having an easy fast.

16
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,120
I imagine we may have less folks here live as a result but maybe some folks catching

17
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:26,760
up with us throughout the week via our podcast or our subscribers over at twitch.tv slash

18
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,320
VOG Network where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

19
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,680
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show might be catching up with the extra video that subscribers

20
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,840
get for being subscribed to the VOG Network.

21
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,320
By the way, today is the last chance, last Sunday anyway, of September so if you want

22
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,640
to get a discount on those subscriptions we really appreciate it and all that goes

23
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,080
back to help the network and help us pay our taxes every year because we're paying

24
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,600
more taxes than some people.

25
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:02,080
But please help me welcome to the show someone who I know is paying his taxes and doing his

26
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,080
part.

27
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,080
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

28
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,080
Hello.

29
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,080
Hey, Loki.

30
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,160
How are you doing?

31
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
I'm doing pretty good.

32
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,160
Good.

33
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,960
Good to see you as always.

34
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,160
What is this behind you tonight?

35
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,160
You've got Bubble Bobble.

36
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,840
You're going to old school and classic tonight.

37
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,640
It's the NES Bubble Bobble.

38
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,240
It was one of the first three games they had for the NES.

39
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,160
Oh, I like that.

40
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,160
Okay.

41
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,560
And that's you just decided to pick Bubble Bobble for that reason or?

42
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,080
Um, yeah, because I had trouble.

43
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,080
I've run through a lot of the games already each week, so like, I'm just like, um, what

44
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,160
should I put this week?

45
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,160
I was thinking there might be-

46
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,680
I guess I could have put a Bethesda game or something.

47
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
Yeah, yeah.

48
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,680
That would be topical.

49
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,720
We'll get into that in a second, obviously.

50
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,320
I thought maybe there was a clue there that like maybe the mystery Loki game that you're

51
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,240
making has something to do with Bubble Bobble.

52
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,200
I thought maybe there was a, okay, I need to stop reading into things so damn much.

53
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,400
It's just, I needed something to put in the background and I didn't want to repeat stuff

54
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,400
I've had already.

55
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,320
So it was Bubble Bobble this week.

56
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,320
Yeah.

57
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,320
Fair.

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,600
Over in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network, Bobby Blackwell says, my first

59
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,840
games on the NES.

60
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,120
I had the power set.

61
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,440
I had Super Mario.com world-class track meet, and then I had pro wrestling and Top Gun.

62
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,440
This is a good question.

63
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:24,600
Y'all in chat, first system and games that you had for said system, let's, let's elaborate

64
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
on that a bit.

65
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,960
I'm trying to think what I, well, my first system was really an Atari 2600, honestly.

66
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,080
And I remember combat.

67
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,000
And I remember Spider-Man and I think I've talked, you know, I've talked enough about

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,360
Spider-Man on this show and in the past few episodes, I'm trying to remember what else

69
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
I own.

70
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
Oh, Superman.

71
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,480
I guess I, I guess I was a superhero kid.

72
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,760
I do remember having Superman.

73
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,680
Did you ever play Superman on the Atari 2600?

74
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,680
No.

75
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,280
It was really weird.

76
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,920
You flew through these different screens and there was this little bling bling bling little

77
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,920
thing.

78
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,760
I think it was like Krypton or something that would chase you.

79
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,000
You were trying to get Lois Lane.

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,120
It was, it played very strange.

81
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,600
So that was an early game that I had.

82
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
All right.

83
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
What did you want to say, Loki?

84
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Adding to that?

85
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,880
Oh, I was going to say, so my first three games that I got on the NES, cause we got

86
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:14,320
it secondhand, I believe, um, was Bubble Bobble, The Legend of Zelda, cause that's one I really

87
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,240
wanted and Breakthrough, um, kind of random.

88
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,240
Yeah.

89
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
Yeah.

90
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,720
I'm pretty sure Zelda was like the first game outside of, um, Mario Brothers and, uh, Duck

91
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,720
Hunt.

92
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,720
I didn't have the power pad system, but I'm pretty sure Zelda was also bought around the

93
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,700
same time because that was the game that like really probably got me like super into gaming

94
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,380
and made me, made me more of a gamer, quite frankly.

95
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,900
Um, let's see other comments in chat, uh, checking out what folks are saying.

96
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,660
Pod culture says Atari, 2,600 combat, et and Pac-Man.

97
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,060
Those are some must have games, even though two of them were kind of garbage.

98
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:58,740
Uh, She-Hulk 10 says Colecovision and, and it scrolled off the screen, Donkey Kong Colecovision

99
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,740
had some good stuff.

100
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,820
Colecovision, uh, we never had one, but our friends had one.

101
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,580
Um, let's see other stuff.

102
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,460
Fifth dream says I played Superman a lot.

103
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,460
Okay.

104
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,460
Glad it wasn't just me.

105
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,100
The break man says Atari, 2,600 Ghostbusters.

106
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,380
Now that was one of the first games I remember picking up for the Commodore 64.

107
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,900
Um, I remember going to a computer store and well, I didn't buy it.

108
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,340
I was like six or seven, but I remember my, my dad buying it for me because you know,

109
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,340
gimme, gimme, gimme.

110
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,900
Well, that was also when they would, they would have the computers that would play games

111
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,480
like, and they'd be on display and Ghostbusters was one of the games they were showing off,

112
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,960
I guess not too far apart from how you'd have like an Xbox or a PlayStation kiosk set

113
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,160
up in a Best Buy or a GameStop in these days.

114
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,960
You kind of try before you buy.

115
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,400
I remember that's how I discovered Sid Meier's civilization.

116
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,200
I spent hours at a store.

117
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,080
I don't know how they let me stay at that damn store hours playing Civ on a computer

118
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,080
at the store.

119
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
It was crazy.

120
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,080
Um, yeah.

121
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,200
So, um, yeah, I did have a Colecovision as well.

122
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,280
I can't remember what the first few games were cause I think that was during the crash.

123
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,760
Um, so my dad had like 50 games for, for system that he says he never like did gaming and

124
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,760
stuff.

125
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
Like he had 50 games for that.

126
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,600
So I think he got them so dirt cheap.

127
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,360
Um, but like I used to play a ton of, uh, the Smurfs, Jumpman Jr. and Bump and Jump

128
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
on that.

129
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
Okay.

130
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
Good.

131
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,040
I didn't know Jumpman Jr. was on Colecovision, but I guess that makes sense.

132
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
Epic.

133
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,520
Epic's put their games out a lot of places.

134
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,520
Yeah.

135
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,520
Cool.

136
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,640
So from retro games to modern games, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic.

137
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,240
Obviously there's a big, big story and everybody's got a hot take on this and this has to do

138
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:47,980
with Microsoft and their acquisition of Bethesda and what, uh, ID software all under the parent

139
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,980
company is ZeniMax.

140
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,980
Right?

141
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,980
Loki, tell us more.

142
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,980
Yes.

143
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:57,400
So yeah, I would have, uh, the crack of Dawn on, uh, September 21st, we've got the announcement

144
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:04,280
that apparently, uh, ID software's parent company, um, ZeniMax or ZeniMax, which owns,

145
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,040
you know, Bethesda ID software and a lot of other, um, subsidiaries as well.

146
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:15,140
They were purchased for $7.5 billion by Microsoft, uh, which is incredible.

147
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:22,320
So apparently, you know, that adds a whole ton of games to their roster as well.

148
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:29,000
Um, it seems like that this has been purchased just for, well, to definitely help out with

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,080
games pass and adding more titles to that.

150
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:40,160
But I mean, as someone who's decided to purchase an X-Box this, this, uh, time around, it's

151
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,760
just making my purchase even better.

152
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,080
So I love it.

153
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,580
Um, and as to why, uh, some, some folks may wonder why did I put on the sidebar Microsoft

154
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:52,200
acquires Bethesda and I didn't put Microsoft acquire ZeniMax, um, well, Bethesda is a part

155
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,900
of that, but also, and what I kind of relate this to every E3, we have the Bethesda press

156
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,900
conference, right?

157
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,880
We have the Bethesda event, Bethesda E3, well, Microsoft now owns everything that you've

158
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:09,160
been shown in that particular, um, you know, real for the past couple of years.

159
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
So yeah.

160
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,160
Yeah.

161
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,160
Kinda, um, kinda interesting.

162
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,520
Um, is that all you wanted to say on it?

163
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,360
No, no, not at all.

164
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,320
So, so of course, you know, the obvious concern is, well, what's that going to do with these

165
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,120
exclusive games that Sony has, you know, for Bethesda?

166
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,360
Or does that mean that I can't get elder scrolls six on, you know, the PlayStation five?

167
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,440
Well, apparently that's not necessarily going to be the case, um, that they are confirmed

168
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,720
that they're right now going to hold their agreements, especially with, um, was a death

169
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
loop.

170
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,080
Now that's an exclusive game on PlayStation five.

171
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,120
So they're going to actually keep that exclusive because that's the agreement that's already

172
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,120
been made.

173
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
Yeah.

174
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,960
There's probably contracts and things because of how death loop has been highlighted in

175
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,000
the PlayStation five showcase.

176
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,640
That would be a lot of eggs on Sony's face.

177
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,160
If that game suddenly went and became a Microsoft exclusive.

178
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:09,200
So there's probably legal agreements, which it's probably just easier to go ahead and

179
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,320
honor the, uh, agreement.

180
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
Yeah.

181
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,680
So they're going to keep their agreements.

182
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,720
And then I believe with the right now, what they've been, the kind of stance has been

183
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,800
is they're going to look at it as they go along.

184
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,000
But I think that they're actually still considering doing these multi-platform, which makes sense

185
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,240
because you have a lot of these Microsoft properties on other systems.

186
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,520
Um, I mean, hell, we just had a new Ori game come to the switch this week.

187
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,680
So in the outer worlds, the outer worlds is still multi-platform even after Microsoft

188
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,680
bought obsidian.

189
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:46,680
Um, but I, I think there's a lot to say though about Microsoft kind of resting on, well,

190
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,280
not necessarily resting on, but investing, I think is a better word investing on the

191
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,660
strength of literally cause they just spent billions of dollars to invest, but they're

192
00:09:53,660 --> 00:10:00,200
investing on the strength of game pass because sure elder scrolls six could go multi-platform.

193
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,640
It could show up on the PlayStation five road will set you back $70 or you just get it with

194
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,040
game pass for PC and Xbox.

195
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,640
Which at this point, many gamers, yeah.

196
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,720
And so I kind of feel like it doesn't matter at that point, if it's multi-platform, it's

197
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,640
going to be such a stronger deal to pick it up on PC or Xbox, uh, that maybe Microsoft

198
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,000
doesn't need to, I mean, Oh, well, it sells more on PlayStation five.

199
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Great.

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,240
That's more money for Microsoft who now owns the studio.

201
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:38,960
So I'm not sure this whole era of console exclusives is what it used to be.

202
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,720
I mean, for Sony, it still is.

203
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,120
Uh, they're going to have God of war and all this stuff, but even, even things like

204
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,800
horizon zero Dawn and some of the other strong Sony franchises you've started to see come

205
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,640
to PC.

206
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,160
And you know, there was a lot of gamers that were up in arms about it, even though it was

207
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,480
like a year after the fact, but I think it just kind of goes to show that like maybe

208
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,160
exclusives aren't everything it used to be.

209
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,080
And I don't understand why people are up in arms about that kind of stuff.

210
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,920
Like even like, I don't get it.

211
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,320
Like why would you care if somebody else can play a game?

212
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,960
Like that's such a stupid thing to be mad about that Twitter shit.

213
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
Just ignore it.

214
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,160
There's so much like God, people have a lot of free time.

215
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,440
I mean, I understand there's a pandemic going on.

216
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,760
A lot of people are still staying at home and all that, which is great, but I, you just,

217
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,560
you just have to filter that garbage out.

218
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:34,040
There's so much garbage on social media that, you know, just pay it no mind in you, you

219
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,040
know, it gets 50 times as bad when it's political stuff and it's just filter, filter, filter,

220
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,000
filter, you let the brain filter out.

221
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah.

222
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,920
It's just like with all the people saying, well, there's better, better games on PlayStation

223
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,920
five.

224
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,920
And I mean, you know, Xbox sucks.

225
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,920
I'm not going to get an Xbox.

226
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,920
I'm like, cool.

227
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
You can, you can do whatever you want.

228
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,160
Like, I don't understand why people are like mad at other people for their purchasing decisions

229
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,360
or decisions on stuff.

230
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,880
It's like, who cares?

231
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,880
It doesn't matter.

232
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,640
It's not impacting you at all.

233
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,760
Like it, it's just such a silly thing.

234
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,800
Like I, I don't get it.

235
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,880
Chewy 240 in chat says, anyone still doubting game pass needs to re-examine their gaming

236
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,880
life.

237
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,880
Well, let's talk about that.

238
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,880
Hello.

239
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
Let's talk about that.

240
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:18,720
Um, obviously a big reason why Microsoft has done this is to really buffer up game pass.

241
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:25,800
And this buffing up of game pass is starting now, like now, because we've already had the

242
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,040
Xbox game pass account tweet out a leak.

243
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,920
And I'm using my quotey fingers, a leak that long story short doom, eternal or doom.

244
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,320
One of them, probably both are on their way to Xbox game pass very soon.

245
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,000
Um, probably in the coming weeks, certainly before the end of the year.

246
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,360
So this investment is already starting to pay off.

247
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,360
And that's more than you can say for a lot of Microsoft's other investments.

248
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,160
That's not to shade any of those studios, but when you get Bethesda and as some of you

249
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,840
have noted in chat, Bethesda has a history that goes back to the fucking 19 or 19 eight.

250
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
Yes.

251
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
19.

252
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,100
I can't get my words right tonight.

253
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,100
The 1980s.

254
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,100
Okay.

255
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,380
I'm at my brain thought I said 1890s anyway.

256
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,080
It goes all the way back to the 1980s with some of the old games that they did.

257
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,080
Let's not forget.

258
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,440
Microsoft has a PC game pass as well.

259
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,720
Wouldn't it be pretty rad if like a lot of these old classics suddenly started showing

260
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,400
up on PC game pass?

261
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm not saying they're going to, but if Microsoft wanted to go that route, they could.

262
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,760
And that's just going to strengthen that as well.

263
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,440
And then of course on the console front, now you have doom, doom and eternal.

264
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,080
Obviously you're gonna have elder scrolls six and it doesn't matter if the game goes

265
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,160
multi-platform because it's going to be part of game pass or you can pay $70 for it.

266
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:48,760
If you really want, you know, on PlayStation five, um, with game pass, Microsoft has now,

267
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,720
and I use this analogy on Bobby's show when I was doing the, the toss over and I'm going

268
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,080
to say it again.

269
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,540
It's like all these services and people trying to become the next game pass, right?

270
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,000
We have Google stadia.

271
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
We have a new one from Amazon.

272
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,800
We're going to talk about it a little bit.

273
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,540
We have, um, Nintendo switch online.

274
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:13,480
We have, uh, PlayStation and now the PlayStation plus, uh, games and all that Microsoft was

275
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,200
already out in front and now they have just pushed the nitro button and you remember that

276
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,800
and Ivan man, iron Stewart, super off-road, you hit that nitro button, you go flying out

277
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
in front.

278
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,600
That's what this Bethesda purchase has done.

279
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,600
They have nitro their way to the front with this game pass, which is where they truly

280
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:37,560
see gaming going is where movies and TV have gone, which is streaming, which is Netflix.

281
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,520
And how long did it take?

282
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:45,100
Because Netflix was so far out front with their investments of creating original programming.

283
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,840
So when it came the, uh, when it came to who's going to get the stranger things that

284
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,220
really kind of threw them out in first place and you know, all the Netflix originals that

285
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:59,340
have made them who they are, it has taken forever for other companies to catch up and

286
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,260
become part of the conversation.

287
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,100
Hulu is kind of getting there.

288
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,780
CBS all access is struggling.

289
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:12,780
CBS is been out there at CBS is one of the big three networks and they're having a hard

290
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,580
time catching on with streaming.

291
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,540
They're having to rebrand the paramount network.

292
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:23,460
They're having to bring in the forces from VH1 and MTV and in order to take on, uh, Netflix,

293
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:29,620
the only company that was able to nitro themselves to a level where Netflix is at pretty quickly

294
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,500
is Disney, Disney plus.

295
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:39,880
And the analogy here would be if Nintendo really wanted to, they could create something

296
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,660
stronger than game pass tomorrow.

297
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,660
Well, don't worry.

298
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,620
Just, they're not, we all know they're not, they're running a Nintendo time.

299
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,620
So right now we're, we're talking early two thousands of Nintendo.

300
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,620
Don't worry.

301
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,880
In 10 years, they'll have something that's similar to Netflix.

302
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,100
And then they'll, you know, everyone will talk how innovative it is.

303
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,100
They're just behind.

304
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,340
Nintendo plus will be out in 2030 it's, it's going to be some time.

305
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,300
I mean, I props to them if they figured this out early and I'm sorry.

306
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,100
The NES online and the SNES online don't count.

307
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,460
Y'all know it don't count.

308
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,500
It's, it's beans.

309
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:20,300
It's it's fucking free Pluto TV compared to, actually, I kind of like Pluto TV.

310
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,740
I shouldn't shade it, but it compared to Netflix, it's like a non-issue.

311
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,740
Okay.

312
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,740
Crackle.

313
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,740
It's yes.

314
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,740
Crackle.

315
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:38,220
Or like, or is it like my TV or I've got the Roku channel, which is just like the garbage,

316
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,460
like old shows.

317
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,300
Like I didn't even realize that this was syndicated.

318
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:46,180
It's the weather app that just plays the same forecast on loop for your area 24 hours

319
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,180
a day.

320
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,860
It's that, that actually exists on PlayStation four, by the way, there's like a weather app

321
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,860
anyway.

322
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,660
Um, I think like the Roku app, it's like, it's got like reruns of wings and that's about

323
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,660
it on there.

324
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,740
It's just like random stuff.

325
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,740
All right.

326
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,180
So my point is, and that whole chat comment I was responding to originally and talking

327
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:09,540
about, let's talk about game pass is that with this, Microsoft has propelled themselves

328
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:14,220
to the front that like everybody else is now going to be struggling to catch up.

329
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,660
And you see Sony kind of starting to move pieces in that direction.

330
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,300
It is too late.

331
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,500
They had now see Sony moving anything in that direction.

332
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,700
They have a lot of ground to make up and you know, Sony is going to kind of hope they can

333
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,700
still ride on.

334
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,980
And I'm not, I'm not, please don't miss hear me when I talk these critical things about

335
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,700
Sony and this is just the culture we're in now is that everything is so polarized.

336
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,500
And if I'm sitting here being critical of Sony, I must hate them.

337
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,500
I don't.

338
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,900
I've said it until I'm blue in the face every week on the show.

339
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,900
Cool.

340
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,900
We have Microsoft.

341
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,900
Yes.

342
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,900
Like not even that.

343
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,900
Yeah.

344
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,900
Yeah.

345
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,900
Go back and listen.

346
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,900
Yes.

347
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,100
We, we've raked Microsoft over the coals and then some, okay.

348
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,060
The thing is we're, we're rooting for everybody.

349
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,060
Okay.

350
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:04,500
But the reality is in this department where we all see gaming is going, Sony has some

351
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,300
major catching up to do.

352
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,580
And what they showed with the PlayStation plus with free games, isn't quite it.

353
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,220
It is, it is movement in the right direction.

354
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,720
That's coming years too late.

355
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,900
So they have a lot of ground to make up now.

356
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,260
Sony could sign some deals and really make some ground up tomorrow.

357
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,420
Sony isn't charging an extra fee.

358
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:30,540
They're bundling in and PlayStation plus that is, you know, to be noted, but it just, you

359
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:34,660
know, you can feel how far behind they are now.

360
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:39,780
And if they don't start to make moves, bigger moves to catch up, Microsoft's really going

361
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,320
to run away with this.

362
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,880
I mean, honestly, if you want to say, you know, all their free games that they're offering

363
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,860
for the PlayStation five, really just kind of catching up to what Microsoft's been doing

364
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:53,140
because Microsoft's been putting out four games a month that you get with your monthly

365
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,660
subscription, whereas Sony's had two.

366
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:01,760
So they're already kind of behind with that plus games fast food for thought again, something

367
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,220
Sony could do tomorrow barring legal agreements.

368
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,500
And I know legal agreements take time.

369
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,580
Sony could just merge PlayStation plus and PlayStation.

370
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:15,900
Now I realize they may not be able to carry all the same games, but maybe PlayStation

371
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:22,740
now would allow them to open up three to one and hundreds of games from Playstations past.

372
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,540
And Sony could make that happen pretty quickly.

373
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,540
Will they?

374
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,540
I don't know.

375
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,300
No, I don't think they're never going to do that anyway.

376
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,420
They like their money too much.

377
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,420
Some other comments.

378
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,420
Yeah.

379
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:40,300
And Paley Hanumayo says, quite frankly, they'll still outsell Xbox this next gen.

380
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,140
That is not incorrect.

381
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,360
I actually agree with you.

382
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:50,460
The PlayStation five as hardware will outsell Xbox, however.

383
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,820
Here's the real question to ask at the end of this generation.

384
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:03,360
Who will have more monthly subscribers, PlayStation plus or Xbox Game Pass?

385
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,640
And hardware doesn't matter anyways, because when you think about it, they're making a

386
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,920
it's a loss for any hardware sold anyways.

387
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,680
And right now, people are just speculating based on how quickly pre-sales are.

388
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,640
And we don't even know because we don't know the actual numbers that are being sold.

389
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,680
And with these game streaming services, games pass is on PC.

390
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,240
It's also on mobile devices and PlayStation now.

391
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:33,120
I think people fighting the old school console war on Twitter with Sony versus Microsoft

392
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,400
and Nintendo is kind of out there doing their own thing.

393
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,720
I think they're gauging the wrong battle.

394
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,480
I think if you're in Phil Spencer's shoes, the battle you're looking at is what I just

395
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,480
mentioned.

396
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,240
They want to at the end of this generation have way more Xbox Game Pass subscribers than

397
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,480
there are PlayStation plus subscribers or Nintendo online monthly subscribers.

398
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,000
That is the battle Microsoft is going to fight.

399
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,080
The Nintendo online one.

400
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,200
I wouldn't even try to compare with them.

401
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,720
It's just like it's not even the same type of thing.

402
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,800
And it's not even the same amount of money that they're making.

403
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
I know.

404
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,800
But I had to include it.

405
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:15,040
I'm chewy, too, because because again, tomorrow, Nintendo could change this conversation, right?

406
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,960
I know we're all sitting here cynical.

407
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,520
They're not going to.

408
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,960
I accept that.

409
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,400
And I agree with it.

410
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,560
But let's also agree with the fact that if they wanted to tomorrow, Nintendo could change

411
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,360
this conversation.

412
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,680
No, they can't, actually.

413
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,520
No, they won't.

414
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,520
And they can't.

415
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,920
I'm going to go on the record.

416
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,920
They can't.

417
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,320
They cannot change this conversation in one day.

418
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,600
There is no announcement that they can make that would change this conversation.

419
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,600
All right.

420
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,600
Let's see.

421
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,600
Other comments in chat here.

422
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,280
Quest Buster says they're pushing the brand as a whole.

423
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,840
If the console doesn't beat the PlayStation 5 in sales, it's probably not as important

424
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,880
as expanding their ecology on everything else, not Sony or Nintendo.

425
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,800
And the break man says they're trying to expand Xbox as a platform far more reaching

426
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,240
than just a console.

427
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,320
Chewy 240 in chat says reoccurring revenue cash is king.

428
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,720
Correct.

429
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:19,520
What game saved an entire franchise and Square Enix from the brink of doom?

430
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,120
Final Fantasy 14.

431
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,780
Look it up.

432
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,040
That's why that game had to be fixed.

433
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,040
And it was fixed.

434
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,120
And it was fixed very well.

435
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:33,200
And what does Square Enix now thank for a lot of its revenue when Final Fantasy, you

436
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,560
know, some of the other titles weren't necessarily when Tomb Raider didn't sell as much as they

437
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,560
thought it would, which is ridiculous.

438
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,560
But you know what?

439
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,080
You all saw that headline, too, right?

440
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,880
But what game did they credit?

441
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,320
Mm hmm.

442
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
Anyway.

443
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,240
See it to be in chat says, I wonder if part of Nintendo being slow to roll some of that

444
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,560
stuff out is also because of related licenses potentially.

445
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:01,920
There is such a strong first party library, although most of what you see in the NES and

446
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,920
the SNES classics now is Nintendo's first party library.

447
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,480
To be honest, there aren't a lot of first party games left that aren't already on the

448
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,480
service.

449
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,080
There may be some tricky licensing things, but for the most part, all the first party

450
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,360
games that you would expect to see are out there.

451
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,720
Now they honestly don't think the licensing would be that expensive on those games.

452
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,760
To be honest, especially like, I'm sure they can because look at look at what the Wii

453
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,760
was.

454
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,760
You remember the Wii?

455
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,000
Well, you know, in the virtual console, how many games are on there?

456
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,800
And since and since you brought it up, like that's kind of where I was going with it,

457
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:43,360
is that but they still have yet to even tap into Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo

458
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:51,480
64, GameCube, Wii, Wii U, they there's all these things they haven't tapped into yet.

459
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,560
So I don't know.

460
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:58,400
Did you see that crazy rumor that at the next Nintendo Direct they're going to flack out

461
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,840
a Game Boy player?

462
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,640
I just it's I don't I don't buy it at all.

463
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,120
I don't buy it wouldn't be surprised, but like.

464
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,200
Once again, that's just like kind of trickling stuff.

465
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,160
It's just it's giving you enough just to like, OK, cool, I can justify the money that I'm

466
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:18,200
paying for this online thing, but like it's not really doing anything, it's just kind

467
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,040
of just the bare minimum.

468
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,520
I guess I don't know.

469
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,760
Should I say something that's going to get me in trouble?

470
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,760
All right.

471
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,720
Of course, always.

472
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,360
It's not worth it for Nintendo to put out the Game Boy player.

473
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,480
Those games don't hold up well at all, save for like Tetris, which wouldn't even be a

474
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,960
part of it anyway, because there's Tetris 99 and there's agreements with the Tetris

475
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,960
company.

476
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,840
I'm not saying the Game Boy wasn't important for its time and all that, but a lot of those

477
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,980
Game Boy games, y'all, they do not hold up well at all.

478
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,320
It would be way smarter for them to go to the Game Boy Advance.

479
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,840
Those games hold up a lot better because a lot of them are on the same level with things

480
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,040
like Super Nintendo and beyond.

481
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:03,800
So sorry if you don't agree with what I said, but that's like the tea as I see it.

482
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:08,320
Those Game Boy games do not hold up well at all, like they're not going to be fun to play.

483
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,400
You'll play them for like 15 seconds and just be like, oh, yeah, I loved this when I was

484
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
a kid.

485
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,840
All right.

486
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,920
So anyway, Bobby Black, I'm just going to go straight to the virtual boy.

487
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,280
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Pokemon Red Blue, not worth it.

488
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:29,040
Dead game, which is why they remade it twice.

489
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,440
And so it's not going to be a part of that collection.

490
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,880
Pokemon wouldn't be in there because and it was specifically red and blue.

491
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,860
They just remade it not that long ago as Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee.

492
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,480
So they're not going to put those games in there.

493
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,640
So anyway, now Orangewrite says maybe have them all.

494
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,400
OK, that I could go a little more for.

495
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:54,440
So I'm not saying there's like, oh, my gosh, there are zero games I would ever play, but

496
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,320
it's just like I just think a lot of those games, it's not going to carry the weight

497
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,720
that y'all think it would.

498
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,400
Anyway, we're getting really distant from the original topic, which was Microsoft acquiring

499
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
Bethesda.

500
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,440
Any other bullet points on that story you wanted to get out, Loki?

501
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:17,000
No, that was pretty much it is just they they own Bethesda now and, you know, now maybe

502
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,600
we will get an actual Fallout New Vegas sequel because now we have Obsidian and we have Bethesda.

503
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,800
So technically they can make it happen.

504
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,840
That's what a lot of people are saying.

505
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,240
That's cool if that happens.

506
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:35,300
But you know, that's kind of one of those like, you know, one phase of enlightenment.

507
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:39,140
But the biggest phase of enlightenment is why don't they work together on a new game?

508
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,580
That would be something really, really cool.

509
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,300
Like have them work together on a new franchise, although it wouldn't happen tomorrow.

510
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,300
So.

511
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,300
All right.

512
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:51,360
Anyway, I think this is going to be pretty exciting for the future for Microsoft as far

513
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,660
as like Elder Scrolls six and that coming to Sony.

514
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,860
I don't know, like I wanted to be really cynical and come on the show and say it's not going

515
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:04,420
to happen and they're just talking that way to reduce some of the negativity.

516
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:09,360
But I really do think it's different now and Microsoft is fighting a different fight.

517
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,120
And so they might just go ahead and still release Elder Scrolls six on PlayStation and

518
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:19,440
kind of like I said, it's going to be 70 bucks there or free on Game Pass, free on Game Pass

519
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,720
with your subscription.

520
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,300
And that's the battle Microsoft's going to fight.

521
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,300
We'll see.

522
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,980
But there's nothing to say that they couldn't do like a timed exclusive.

523
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,880
Oh, they could do a timed exclusive.

524
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:37,940
They could do that there's a whole new expansion or part of it that is only on Microsoft.

525
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,460
There's there's a lot of things they could do with it.

526
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,760
Spider-Man is only available in Elder Scrolls six on Xbox.

527
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:50,360
That'll show him Questbuster in chat says Obsidian might actually be happy doing their

528
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,920
own thing now with outer worlds and the world they created with pillars.

529
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,160
I'm sure they still have the Fallout universe in their heart, but they've probably moved

530
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,160
on.

531
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,160
Yeah.

532
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,280
They'll probably just move on to something new.

533
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,200
But maybe there could be like a remastering or something, something that would take less

534
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,720
resources than a whole new game, but like a remastering of New Vegas or revisiting that

535
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
somehow that I say.

536
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,800
I would love more than the remaster of Oblivion or New Vegas.

537
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,400
That would be cool.

538
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Do you?

539
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,400
OK.

540
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:23,160
Do you think there's going to be the Skyrim one more time edition on PlayStation five

541
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,200
and Xbox Series X?

542
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,920
Will there be a Skyrim one more time?

543
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:36,320
One more for the road encore edition for the.

544
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,480
I could see that, but I feel like it's got to happen.

545
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,840
Like if they don't put Skyrim on Xbox one X.

546
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,880
I've already done like the enhanced edition.

547
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,800
I don't know if they're going to necessarily do that again.

548
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,360
It would be funny, but like, I don't know if it would do that.

549
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,600
I don't think unless they can justify getting the return on it.

550
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,240
I mean, they already have like the special edition as it is, and I don't know what new

551
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,680
the Xbox Series X will necessarily do with the special edition, like how that will upscale

552
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,680
stuff on that.

553
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:11,760
So I mean, that sort of could be like releasing it again.

554
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,440
I don't think they will.

555
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,080
Tiger Claw on chat says Skyrim remastered in 4K HDR.

556
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,820
Well, you know, it may just end up being one of the things where it's like enhanced backwards

557
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,400
compatibility on Xbox Series X.

558
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,400
Yeah.

559
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,900
And yeah, it already does.

560
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:31,100
And so maybe it's going to have further enhanced capability on Xbox Series X and they'll just

561
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,500
say to Sony, well, you don't really care about backwards compatibility on PlayStation.

562
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,580
So we're not going to enhance it for that.

563
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,580
Yeah.

564
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:44,020
I'm pretty sure that the PlayStation 4 and I want to say the PlayStation.

565
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,420
Oh, yeah, they've already enhanced Skyrim once.

566
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,740
Yeah, they've already enhanced it once.

567
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:52,060
I'm pretty sure it supports 4K and whatnot.

568
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,060
HDR.

569
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,060
Probably.

570
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,140
I don't know what the PC version does with the old engine, though, they're like, it just

571
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,140
doesn't look super great.

572
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,220
So like, I wouldn't even rebuild the whole thing.

573
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,980
You want to play it one more time.

574
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,100
One more time.

575
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,100
One more turn.

576
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,100
One more turn.

577
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:16,380
And I've got it on PC or my Xbox 360 and PlayStation 4.

578
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,580
Let's move on with the show and talk about the things we have been playing this week.

579
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:23,140
If it was Skyrim or what during how was your gaming week?

580
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:27,140
Again, Dark Sakura not here tonight because of the Jewish holiday, but we will see her

581
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:31,780
again next week and get caught up on everything that she has been playing throughout the week.

582
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,380
So Loki, how was your gaming week?

583
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,900
I picked up a breakpoint that we talked about last week.

584
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:42,460
The game looks kind of like Geometry Wars.

585
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,460
Oh, right.

586
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,460
That came out.

587
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,940
I need to pick that up, too.

588
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,940
Yeah.

589
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,940
Yeah.

590
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,940
So that's pretty cool.

591
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,940
It's very hard.

592
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:56,020
It's kind of you have to keep on your toes because your weapons keep breaking as you're

593
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,980
fighting through there.

594
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,060
So you have like all these different melee weapons that you get.

595
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:05,900
And of course, it's very similar gameplay and the aesthetic is very similar to Geometry

596
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,060
Wars, but pretty fun.

597
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,740
So I did play that a little bit.

598
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:14,100
I played a little bit of hot shot racing again, so that was pretty cool.

599
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,660
I'm really enjoying that game.

600
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:25,180
I actually went back and played some more Minecraft and a little frustrated with Microsoft

601
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:28,660
right now because I have a realm that I pay for.

602
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:33,060
And so I prepaid for that and then they want to be the pay again for my realm.

603
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:38,620
So it ended up charging me like three times for my realm subscription.

604
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:42,260
So obviously the Windows Store has some issues when it comes to that.

605
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:47,180
So I have to get a refund for those or something.

606
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,180
It's like seven bucks.

607
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,180
That's annoying.

608
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,180
So annoying.

609
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,180
Yeah.

610
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:57,500
And then I played a little bit of, well, actually quite a bit of Orna this week.

611
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,500
So I've been doing that.

612
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,300
I finally leveled up to 181.

613
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,440
I'm still kind of way behind because I don't play very often anymore.

614
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,860
And then I checked out Pokemon Go a little bit and played very little of that.

615
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,180
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

616
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:17,820
I think I've been slacking on the Orna front myself and I really got to like all these

617
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:22,780
randos started joining our thing and I think it's because, well, I think we've been leveling

618
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:26,840
up because as a, I want to say free company and it's not what it is, it's a guild or whatever

619
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,840
it is in that game.

620
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,840
I think we've been leveling up.

621
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:34,120
I think we're showing up now in like those first two pages of like open kingdoms because

622
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,060
we've been leveling up so much and that's why we're getting all these randos that are

623
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,060
joining us.

624
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,360
I just thought there was a lot of people that he didn't know, I'm like, who are all these

625
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,360
people?

626
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,280
And those, so I don't know what to do about all that.

627
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,900
As long as they're nice, like whatever, I guess it's the most important thing.

628
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,680
Just don't be a dick and you know, we'll have fun getting to know new people.

629
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,800
But yeah, I've been slacking off on Orna.

630
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,180
I probably have been playing more ingress than any of the other location based games

631
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:00,840
this week just because with all the quarantine and everything, and especially like the heat

632
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,460
and the smoke here in California the past couple of weeks, I have not been going outside

633
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,360
as much and the COVID 19 pounds is really starting to show.

634
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,400
So I'm trying to get walking and doing that stuff more.

635
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,320
So Ingress is a good motivator for that.

636
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:19,780
I did a mission banner yesterday at a giant park in the south area of Sacramento and it

637
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,740
probably took me like two hours of solid walking.

638
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:27,080
I'd stopped and did the portal scanning here and there too, but you know, that was a lot

639
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,080
of exercise.

640
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,760
So I'm just trying to do that, you know, let that game motivate the exercise because that's

641
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,660
when it's its best really.

642
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:39,540
As far as other games, I've been playing Final Fantasy 14 because I'm always playing that

643
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:43,720
still working on my crafters and my paladin leveling that up.

644
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,400
But then I've also been spending a little bit of time, quite a bit of time actually

645
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,840
on two other games.

646
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:56,000
I've been playing a lot of No Man's Sky again, thanks to the recent 3.0 patch, which we're

647
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,440
going to talk about later in the show.

648
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,240
So I'll save most of my thoughts for them.

649
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,780
But because of that patch, I was like, you know what, what the hell?

650
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,900
Let's do it again.

651
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,700
Let's start a universe from scratch and see what happens.

652
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:12,120
And I was just really happy with the universe I rolled into and on the planet where I established

653
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,460
my base and stuff.

654
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:18,920
I am now like further along and I'm now into 10 plus hours, which is probably more than

655
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,640
I've spent on any other playthrough in that game so far.

656
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,160
And I just, I am really, really loving that game right now.

657
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,920
I'm going to talk a little more later in the show about the patch and some of the things

658
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:35,160
that it changed and some of the old games that I revisited to check out some changes.

659
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,100
So I'll show you that later in the show.

660
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,680
Let's see other games I've been playing.

661
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,720
One other game I've been playing a lot of this week, Hades.

662
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,860
So I bought that on Steam a couple weeks ago.

663
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,940
And this week I said, what the hell?

664
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,280
And I double dipped and I bought it on Switch as well.

665
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,640
And I've spent several hours on that game.

666
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,120
That is fun.

667
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,600
Like it's, you know, for the roguelikes and for what it is, it has a very kind of like

668
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,560
Diablo-esque feel to it, but it isn't Diablo.

669
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,800
Like it isn't that kind of game at all.

670
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,880
It's kind of more like a rogue-like, it just kind of, I don't know, plays a little bit

671
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,400
like Diablo, but it is very satisfying going through all those different dungeons and the

672
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,960
way they've kind of told the story and have all the different characters that they do

673
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,480
in a game like that is pretty neat.

674
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,720
And the voice acting is very well done.

675
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,680
So yeah, I've been really enjoying Hades.

676
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:36,360
It's weird to have to fight that first boss over and over and over again as you kind of

677
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,880
keep getting further and further.

678
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,840
But you do feel yourself progressing and that fight feels like it gets easier and easier.

679
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,160
And then you kind of learn how to do it with other weapons and stuff.

680
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,440
So yeah, I'm loving Hades.

681
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,440
It's a really good game.

682
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,200
Probably one of the best games of the year, honestly.

683
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,180
Siya Tabiri in chat says, another streamer I follow on here is thirsty for every character

684
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,680
in Hades.

685
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,680
Don't blame them.

686
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,360
The character design is really well done.

687
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,120
You really only see like the one picture of most of them.

688
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,160
Well, they have different poses and things like that.

689
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,400
So it's interesting because they don't like move and are fully animated like you see in

690
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,520
a lot of games today, but it works.

691
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,160
I'm not saying you have to have that.

692
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,540
I just said the game is one of the best of the year.

693
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:24,580
It's just interesting how it is limited, but it still manages to tell the story and contribute

694
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,460
to a great game experience the way that it does.

695
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,900
Quest Buster says, I'm really tempted to get Hades.

696
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,860
At Dev says, I kind of want to try Hades too.

697
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,220
I'm going to endorse it.

698
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:39,420
I will try to do a stream of it later on, or maybe like a recorded YouTube or something.

699
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:44,020
I have another idea stewing in my head for more video on demand stuff, but I will try

700
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:48,220
to do some more narrated gameplay of that and why I'm into that game a little later

701
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,220
on.

702
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,220
But I am super into Hades.

703
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,220
Good game.

704
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,360
So that was pretty much my gaming week.

705
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,380
Some quick housekeeping.

706
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,900
There may not be a show in two weeks.

707
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,660
I will confirm next week.

708
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:05,440
It's very possible I'm going to be going on a little trip.

709
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,940
And yes, I realize everything that's going on in the world and all of those precautions

710
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,940
and things are going into it.

711
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,940
It's not flying.

712
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,940
It's driving.

713
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,940
Are going into that.

714
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:17,180
I may not be back in time for a show in two weeks, considering I haven't gone anywhere

715
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,180
in about six months.

716
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:23,940
I'm going to take a night off, but I will confirm that next week because I may actually

717
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,940
be back in time.

718
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,560
Still working out some of the details.

719
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,060
So yeah, that's that.

720
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:35,500
Also over at the voice geeks network, vog network.com, just a couple weeks ago, we launched

721
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,900
the vog roundtables where we get some different people together to discuss a current topic

722
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,260
going on in geek culture.

723
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,820
And this week, this was a good one because it wasn't gaming.

724
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,400
I want to make sure we're doing some like, obviously, I'm going to make a lot of gaming

725
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,020
content because it's my wheelhouse.

726
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,980
But once in a while, I'm going to challenge myself to do something outside of that too.

727
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,500
So this week, we did a panel on cosplay in the COVID era.

728
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,140
And we kind of talked about how cosplayers are passing the time when there's really no

729
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,980
in person conventions right now.

730
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:06,120
And there's some pretty neat ideas like we heard about.

731
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:11,020
We had Aria snark or Victoria formerly of shaking and crying here at the voice geeks

732
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,600
network was a part of the panel.

733
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,680
And she talked about how she was doing like a virtual Disneyland birthday party dressed

734
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,680
up in cosplay.

735
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,680
So this is a really neat story.

736
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,680
So check that out.

737
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,640
The vog roundtable over at vog network.com.

738
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,960
Big ups to anime jam session who showed up and participated with that as well.

739
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,240
Rama and Ichigo, who is a frequent guest on that show.

740
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,120
So all right, let's move on though to talking about the news.

741
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,240
So Loki, what's going on in the news?

742
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,240
Yes.

743
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:43,440
So Amazon had their big kind of, you know, event that they talked about all the different

744
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,160
things coming out from Amazon, I think it's like the Amazon fire stuff.

745
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,080
And one of the things that they talked about is a brand new service called Luna.

746
00:38:53,080 --> 00:39:00,640
It is a paid game streaming service that allows subscribers to play PC games remotely on computers,

747
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,480
phones, tablets, and fire TVs, I believe.

748
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,600
So they're charging $5.99 a month.

749
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:16,680
And you get a curated library of PC games called, I guess, the Luna plus game channel.

750
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,680
And you can check out quite a few different games on there.

751
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,280
So some of the stuff that I noticed off, you know, top my head here looking at this, they

752
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,120
got some pretty decent stuff on there.

753
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:32,640
There's luminous on their control grid.

754
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:38,000
And then more indie titles, like they have two point hospital, over cook to rhyme Ubisoft's

755
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
in there as well.

756
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,280
A resident in there, South Korea, Valhalla.

757
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,560
So they've got, you know, some bigger titles and a mix of kind of smaller titles in there

758
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,560
as well.

759
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:55,080
But yeah, and then you can also purchase a controller, which kind of looks like a Nintendo

760
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:00,480
switch pro controller, but with purple, which I kind of like the way that looks.

761
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,480
And yeah, plus there's since, you know, they do own Twitch, there is integrated Twitch

762
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,560
functionality as well.

763
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:14,640
So you can actually stream directly from that to Twitch, which is kind of cool.

764
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:20,320
Do you know that comic where it's got the two characters and the one like has like a

765
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:26,560
neat painting or something and the character goes, you made this and then takes the painting

766
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,360
and the last frame is like, I made this, you know, that whole thing where it's like, they

767
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,600
stole the thing.

768
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,600
Yeah.

769
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,920
That is what Amazon just did to Google Stadia in my opinion.

770
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,520
Yes, pretty much.

771
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:43,080
I mean, the difference though, with this and Stadia obviously is this is similar to like

772
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:50,840
a games pass or PlayStation now service where Stadia is even less of a less attractive because

773
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,840
yeah.

774
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:58,800
And that's exactly why I'm like Amazon just kind of like just snatched it from Google.

775
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,960
And I just like, especially when it comes to like the Twitch integration, oh, it's all

776
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,680
those things that YouTube should probably already be at when it comes to Stadia.

777
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:11,740
And well, yeah, Stadia still not out of beta.

778
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:16,760
Don't we still not have open services out of that was supposed to happen the first quarter

779
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,760
of this year.

780
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,760
What the hell happened?

781
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:23,920
Well, besides COVID okay, but it's been, we're talking about online stuff.

782
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:30,880
What's that additional beta is that when us being in COVID and, you know, using a lot

783
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,320
more online services be additional beta testing.

784
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,320
Yeah.

785
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:40,760
But I guess developers and everything, but yeah, honestly, I like the way the controller

786
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,760
looks.

787
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,760
I like purple.

788
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,640
I mean, maybe I just need to get purple controller.

789
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,640
Yes.

790
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,640
We hear it.

791
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,640
The voice geeks network love purple.

792
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,640
Exactly.

793
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,080
So I mean, I don't know.

794
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,160
It's all right.

795
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,800
But like, I'm not going to probably buy it.

796
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,800
It's a neat idea.

797
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,920
I'm curious to see how that works out.

798
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,320
Hey, maybe they'll throw it into, you know, prime or something like that.

799
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,320
Oh, that would be great.

800
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,320
Prime.

801
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,320
Yeah.

802
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,320
And then you get that as well.

803
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,880
But I don't know.

804
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,880
We'll see.

805
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,960
You know, it's interesting because we just had this discussion last week and we had the

806
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,120
round table and everything about the mid roll ads on Twitch and Twitch, maybe not, you know,

807
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,880
making enough money right now and they're having to look at other ways to make money.

808
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,440
Well, I would think this might be one of the ways where Twitch can help the Amazon machine

809
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,160
make money that, you know, I'm not saying that, you know, it's maybe going to be enough

810
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,820
to keep Twitch running, but it is something that is going to add value to the company.

811
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:42,200
You know, the ability to, I would assume one day just jump right into these games that

812
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,960
streamers are playing.

813
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,360
And I see that happen a lot.

814
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:51,340
One game that Alan has been playing a ton of lately is Dead by Daylight.

815
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,440
He's been playing that game a lot.

816
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,880
He played, you know, he gets super into one game at a time and that's the game right now.

817
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,120
But what I see him doing, he has streamer friends.

818
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,140
He has, you know, two or three regular, he probably has more than that, but two or three

819
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:08,160
that I regularly see streamer friends and they'll be online and playing.

820
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,160
And when he sees them online and playing and there's a spot, he'll just jump in and join

821
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,240
and play the game with them.

822
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:20,040
And so that whole process, I just explained, is probably going to be very, very easy with

823
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,520
something like Luna.

824
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,680
You know, if you see your streamer friend playing the game, just click here to join

825
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,400
in.

826
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,880
If the streamer wants that and their privacy settings are set up.

827
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,880
Yeah.

828
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:36,080
So I mean, assuming that's how they set it up, which would be very similar to like Stadia,

829
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,120
but I just don't see a lot of people using that.

830
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:44,360
Like it seems like a cool idea, but like I don't think there's a lot of people playing

831
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:50,920
Stadia and honestly, like the folks that are streaming to YouTube or even Twitch, I don't

832
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,800
think that they're using these services.

833
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,800
I mean, I don't know.

834
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,240
Well, one reason you can't really, you can't really stream Stadia right now, anytime I've

835
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:05,400
shown Stadia here on OLR, I prerecorded it and then I showed it here.

836
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,400
You can't really stream Stadia because you can't have the bandwidth to send that all

837
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,400
up.

838
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,240
Well, maybe you do depending on your internet, but right now most people don't have the capability

839
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,240
to...

840
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,240
It's all remote.

841
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,240
Right.

842
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:22,360
But if Luna is integrated with Amazon and it's all tied together, then hypothetically,

843
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:26,520
you can kind of hit a button to stream your gameplay and it's going to stream from the

844
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:30,420
web services side and it would require...

845
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,880
That's how Stadia works as well.

846
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,680
It's just Stadia sucks, but that's how it works as well.

847
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,760
It streams from Google's cloud services or whatever.

848
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,760
To YouTube?

849
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,760
Yeah.

850
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,760
To YouTube.

851
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,760
Oh.

852
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:48,240
That's because that's how it does, for example, if your PC or whatever you're streaming on

853
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,840
can't handle 4K or something like that, so you're playing in 1080p or something.

854
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,460
When you stream it to YouTube, it's actually in 4K.

855
00:44:55,460 --> 00:45:01,560
The fact that I, a streamer, don't even know about that whole stuff, I thought I read that

856
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:06,200
that was going to be a thing, I didn't realize that it was already baked in, says a lot

857
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,200
about Stadia.

858
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,200
Yeah.

859
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,200
Well, okay, so...

860
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,840
Once again, don't care because it's Stadia and I'm not buying games on that service and

861
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,400
I'm not using it and...

862
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,800
So I don't care, sorry.

863
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:22,680
I think depending on the game, especially when it comes to MMOs and things that are

864
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:27,920
specifically multiplayer, I think there will be a place for jumping right in with your

865
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,560
favorite streamer, just like Alan does already with something like Dead by Daylight.

866
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:37,200
Unfortunately, a game like Control, a game like Luminous, a game like Res Infinite, those

867
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,600
are all fantastic games, but they're not games you're going to jump in and play with your

868
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,600
favorite streamer.

869
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,320
It's going to take the right game.

870
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,320
Something like...

871
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:48,240
You know the game Luna needs tomorrow?

872
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,680
Among Us.

873
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,120
Hello!

874
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:55,640
That's like a 10-person game and that would be a great one that you could just...

875
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,960
How often do I see that being played on a Twitch where then one person has to go and

876
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,800
it's like they have a hole in the game so they have to change the rules or they have

877
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,080
to have a rando, which gets weird.

878
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,080
Hello!

879
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:10,760
That's the game that you would be able to jump in and easily play with your friends.

880
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:16,720
Or something like 100 vs. 1, a Fortnite, a Tetris 99.

881
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,720
What's that?

882
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,720
It's like free and mobile.

883
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,720
Yeah, it uses ads.

884
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,640
It's like five bucks, you know?

885
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,640
So...

886
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,640
Just pay the five dollars.

887
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,640
I mean, it's...

888
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,480
I don't know.

889
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,640
But that integration would still go a long way, I'm just saying.

890
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,640
Yeah.

891
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,640
Anyway.

892
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:38,680
So are you interested in more about Luna or...

893
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,680
Probably not really.

894
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,680
No.

895
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:46,480
Funny enough, even though I'm kind of wary about having Amazon have access to cameras

896
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:52,000
in my house, that camera thing that they've got on the drone camera that they have is

897
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,440
kind of cool.

898
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,440
But aside from that, I don't know.

899
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,080
I do like the drone camera.

900
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,080
That's kind of neat.

901
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,080
But...

902
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,080
Well, we have that...

903
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,080
What is it?

904
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,080
Ring or whatever?

905
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,080
We have Amazon's camera thing in our house.

906
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,080
That's what it is.

907
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:10,960
It's a Ring camera, but it's a drone, so it flies around your house in film stuff.

908
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,000
That's kind of cool.

909
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,320
Someone in Amazon HQ wants to watch me walk from the bedroom to the shower.

910
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,760
I hope they enjoy what they see, honestly.

911
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,760
It's just...

912
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,760
Whatever.

913
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,520
I don't care.

914
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,520
Camera's not pointed that way anyway.

915
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,520
Anyway.

916
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:35,240
For me, the Amazon Luna streaming, it's a great example of what I just said about now

917
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,760
Microsoft is way far out in front of the competition.

918
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:45,480
I kind of look at this and I go, oh, this is cool, but I have Game Pass already now,

919
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,480
and there's like...

920
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,480
I don't really see...

921
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,880
There's some nice games here.

922
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,500
The ones I would want to play, I pretty much already own already, though, so this is cool.

923
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,440
This would have been a lot better two years ago.

924
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:03,200
This is a perfect example of when I say Microsoft is way far out in front, and the other people

925
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,240
are going to take too long.

926
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,360
This is a great example of that.

927
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,800
Luna's getting out the door about two years too late.

928
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:19,080
And I would say, though, that probably this is already a step up from Google Stadia, just

929
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,580
from their initial offering.

930
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:21,760
Just sounds better anyways.

931
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,760
There's more games.

932
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,760
It doesn't...

933
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,440
You don't have to pay for each additional game.

934
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:32,320
I get it that Google Stadia has that library that's available, but that's not the same

935
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,760
thing.

936
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,760
That's like calling what PlayStation Plus has the same thing as Game Pass.

937
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,160
It's not the same thing.

938
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,280
So I just...

939
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,320
I think it's already a little bit better, but still that's like...

940
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,680
It's not all that attractive.

941
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,320
That's like saying, you know, this...

942
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:56,640
To go back to the analogy that we were using earlier, Google Stadia's Crackle, although

943
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,760
I don't think you have paid for Crackle, but let's just say that you did.

944
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:05,240
So Google Stadia, or maybe it's like Voodoo, okay, so it's not necessarily...

945
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:14,880
It's Voodoo to Amazon's Quibi, but it's not going to compete with Hulu or Netflix.

946
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,360
Now that's just mean to call it Quibi.

947
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,360
Come on.

948
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,880
That's mean.

949
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,880
Don't do that.

950
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,480
It's not as good as obviously the other stuff, but you never know.

951
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,480
It could get better.

952
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,000
I mean, and it already has like the opportunity to do that.

953
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,060
I'd like to see what they're going to do with it.

954
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:36,100
And whatever happened to all these games that Amazon was supposed to be putting out,

955
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,380
like, don't they have some games that they're working on?

956
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:41,180
Like I thought there was some Amazon game studios or something that...

957
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:47,220
Yeah, the RPG, I keep seeing some people playing it on Twitch.

958
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,820
I don't know if it's still like...

959
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:49,820
Oh, right, right, right.

960
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:54,500
Is it the one that's like a Fortnite, but like it's like a Battle Royale...

961
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,060
No, Spellbreak, that's not an Amazon thing.

962
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,060
Okay.

963
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,060
That's not...

964
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,060
Okay.

965
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:01,060
No.

966
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:02,060
Okay.

967
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,060
Thank you, Questbuster.

968
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,060
Oh.

969
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:05,060
Preview events is what it is.

970
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,060
New World.

971
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,060
Got it.

972
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:08,060
All right.

973
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,060
Moving on.

974
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,860
Let's talk about No Man's Sky.

975
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:15,320
So No Man's Sky is a game that I've been playing an awful lot of this week, and pretty much

976
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:20,700
the catalyst for me jumping on it again was the 3.0 update.

977
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:25,860
So there was a big 3.0 update called Origins, and what did Origins do?

978
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:30,460
So the Origins update added billions of new planets, apparently.

979
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:36,400
They also changed the diversity of flora and fauna, also changing different weather systems

980
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,940
and making more dramatic terrain types.

981
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:42,600
So basically they're saying in a short, it changes pretty much everything, and as far

982
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:47,700
as like the look of the game and what you encounter on the planets, it definitely does

983
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:50,240
change a lot of things.

984
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:56,300
In this playthrough that I have, so I started over, and honestly, if you've spent like less

985
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:59,380
than 10 hours on your save file, just start over.

986
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:02,900
Like there's so much in the tutorial, there's so much that it walks you through and so forth

987
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:08,580
that you are going to have a lot to discover and see and do, and you're not going to feel

988
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:12,360
like you're retreading the same path because you're going to be on New Worlds and things

989
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,220
like that, and now everything looks a little bit different.

990
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:20,740
So I would say just start over, especially those of you guys that like bought No Man's

991
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:25,540
Sky back when it first launched and haven't touched it since, this is probably a pretty

992
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:29,080
good time to jump in and check that stuff out.

993
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,560
So I've been really enjoying my time with the game.

994
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:36,000
I've gotten further in, even though the story branches in multiple paths, so there isn't

995
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,200
like really a story, but I feel like I'm farther in a couple of those paths than I was ever

996
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:45,720
in any of my previous playthroughs, of which I've rebooted No Man's Sky like five times

997
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,720
now.

998
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,360
Yeah, I haven't played in a long time, and I was actually thinking about, you know, booting

999
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:54,300
it up on PC, which I haven't played at all because I purchased that when I was on sale

1000
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:58,260
one time, and I was like, oh, I should really go back and play that because I haven't played

1001
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:59,300
it since.

1002
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,300
Yeah.

1003
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,300
1.0.

1004
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:05,340
And Bobby Blackwell says, did you start over on PC or PS4?

1005
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:10,940
I started over on PS4, however, if you aren't already aware, No Man's Sky put in cross-play

1006
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:13,060
like two patches ago.

1007
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:18,060
So you will see a little icon now next to usernames that show you what it says.

1008
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,500
I don't know how they handled the world naming.

1009
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,900
Like if two people were in it, I don't know how they did that.

1010
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,980
That didn't affect anything because I've been starting new games and such.

1011
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,420
Have they reset all that?

1012
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:28,460
I don't think they did.

1013
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:29,780
In fact, I know they didn't.

1014
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,740
I'm going to get to that in a minute.

1015
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:36,500
But you have now if you have a friend code, basically, which I know is dumb, but it's

1016
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,820
how they get away with it.

1017
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:41,380
So basically what you do if you add somebody by their No Man's Sky friend code, then it

1018
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:44,940
doesn't matter what platform they're on and you will see them on your No Man's Sky friend

1019
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,920
list and you can interact with them and so forth.

1020
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,500
So PC, PS4, Xbox, and it's on Game Pass.

1021
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,420
So it doesn't matter anymore.

1022
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,020
So that's that's the really good news about that.

1023
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,020
Yeah.

1024
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:59,620
And Questbuster says players have icons that can tell you if they're PC or PS4 players.

1025
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:00,620
Yeah.

1026
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:03,780
It has a little keyboard and mouse for PC and then Xbox has like an Xbox shape controller

1027
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,480
and PS4 has PS4.

1028
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,100
So yeah.

1029
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:13,800
Now the base where I've established on is now I've called the planet MSEP for Main Street

1030
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:19,620
Electrical Parade because it's one of those planets where like the flora and fauna glow

1031
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:22,460
at night and it looks very neon.

1032
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:25,780
It looks like Darnassus and wow, except more red than purple.

1033
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:29,140
It's really pretty like the way it glows and I set up my base there and I really, really

1034
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:30,140
like it.

1035
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:34,300
Sorry, I should have got some video of it, but maybe I'll do a stream at some point or

1036
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,300
something, but it's really pretty.

1037
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,980
So I'm like really into this base.

1038
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:41,860
I've actually built a place to land my ship so you can take off and not have the fuel

1039
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:44,340
costs and all that stuff, which is pretty cool.

1040
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:47,300
Bobby Blackwell says, do they have cross save?

1041
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:50,700
Like can I play on a PS4 and just move to a PC with the same game?

1042
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:57,660
I'm not sure, but I'm leaning towards no, just because I haven't seen it, but I would

1043
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:01,540
Google it or something before I definitively answer that question because again, they've

1044
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:04,180
been changing a lot with the game.

1045
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:08,020
Now here's the downside to this patch.

1046
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:11,420
And for people that have been playing the game a long time, some people may have built

1047
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:16,620
their base on a really pretty planet before and that planet may have changed.

1048
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,500
I didn't realize this was part of it.

1049
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:22,940
When they talk about all the flora and fauna and all this stuff, they changed old planets

1050
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:24,980
to put in all this new stuff.

1051
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:31,100
Now they didn't go so far as to, if you were on a non-environmental hazard planet before,

1052
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,140
suddenly you're on a toxic nightmare planet.

1053
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:37,100
They didn't do that, but they definitely changed planets.

1054
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:42,460
And so some people had their bases on these really like perfect planets and this update,

1055
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:43,460
Oh great.

1056
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:47,460
A volcano is now next to their base, you know?

1057
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:51,960
And yes, there is now a weather circumstance where it can rain fire.

1058
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,300
And I actually saw this on a planet where it was literally called that circumstance

1059
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,300
2020.

1060
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,140
It was, they probably should have.

1061
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:03,840
Anyway, to put this together and show you what I mean, I actually have a little video

1062
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,460
I'd like to show you here.

1063
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:09,980
So those of you that have been following VOG for a while and maybe watched some personal

1064
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:14,860
streaming that myself and Bobby Black Wolf do a couple of years ago during the 2.0 upgrade.

1065
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:17,180
And yeah, it was like a couple of years ago.

1066
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:21,920
We started building our bases on a planet called Blissey.

1067
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,820
We called it Blissey because it was a peaceful planet.

1068
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:26,300
It looked very earthy.

1069
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,580
It looked very serene and peaceful.

1070
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:34,060
I couldn't find any footage of this planet on my Twitch, in my clips, but I did find

1071
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:36,020
some on Bobby Black Wolf's channel.

1072
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:40,340
So here without permission is some footage from Bobby Black Wolf's Twitch.

1073
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,060
So this is Blissey.

1074
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:45,820
Now it's at night, but you can see, and I'll, I'll narrate over this a little bit for the

1075
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:46,880
podcast listeners.

1076
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,720
You can see it's very green.

1077
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,360
It's very beach.

1078
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:54,820
It's very, you know, and you see Bobby running from my base to his base, he's kind of jet

1079
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:55,820
packing.

1080
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:58,260
There's the occasional little animal there.

1081
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:01,140
And you know, you can see like there was like one mountain in the distance and so forth,

1082
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,140
right?

1083
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:05,860
So this is the planet Blissey and you know, Bobby's got his base set up and all that fun

1084
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:06,980
stuff.

1085
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:10,260
Here is what Blissey looks like now.

1086
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:15,740
So I booted up my old save file on my PlayStation five or my PlayStation five.

1087
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:18,540
I wish my PlayStation four earlier today.

1088
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:19,540
Look at that.

1089
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:20,580
It's all pink.

1090
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:23,140
Now there's this pink fauna.

1091
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:27,540
Well for one, I spawned right on top of a toxic plant, which is kind of annoying.

1092
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:31,860
So there's that now to deal with, but I kind of laughed when I saw it was all pink with

1093
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:36,820
the flaunt, uh, with the fauna and stuff on the ground because excuse me, the flora fauna

1094
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:37,820
would be the animals.

1095
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:38,880
We'll get to that in a minute.

1096
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,740
The flora is all pink and it made me laugh because Blissey is a pink Pokemon.

1097
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,560
So that kind of cracked me up.

1098
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,120
I was checking here in the interface.

1099
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:50,680
This is just recorded live game players checking in the interface because I was like, why don't

1100
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,780
you'll notice in the lower left, I don't see the actual planet.

1101
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:58,720
We renamed it to Blissey, but I was seeing the old name and check out that gigantic monolith.

1102
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,040
We just saw in the video was not there before.

1103
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,680
So that was something that was added there.

1104
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,680
Uh, yeah.

1105
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,920
So even though the name in the corner says like Etome, some of the something, it's actually

1106
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:07,920
the planet Blissey.

1107
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,920
And you could see that in the online services.

1108
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:14,240
I think that probably just has something to do with some of the changes and so forth.

1109
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:19,760
Um, now what we're seeing in the footage, there are all of these animals everywhere.

1110
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,280
Whereas in the old footage, you would see the occasional one animal.

1111
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,420
There's like all these little turtle looking things everywhere now and so forth.

1112
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:32,760
And now here's where I'm doing that exact same run to Bobby's base that he was doing

1113
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,760
in the old footage.

1114
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:39,100
You can see just how different the ground looks with the varied kind of like pink fauna

1115
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:43,000
animals everywhere now that were in the old one and so forth.

1116
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
So I'm scanning some of these animals, but as I am doing some scanning, one of the, so

1117
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,600
a lot of this is like, cool, gray, awesome.

1118
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,600
Looks great.

1119
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,480
Let me show you the punchline.

1120
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:57,040
Look carefully on the left hand side of the screen while I start to scan some of these

1121
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,920
things where it talks about what is going on with the planet.

1122
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,640
Look at the left side of the screen and for the podcast was just going to read it.

1123
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:08,200
It says lethal humidity outbreaks.

1124
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,200
Hold up.

1125
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,200
Hold up.

1126
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,200
So you're in Florida?

1127
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,200
Hold up.

1128
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:20,660
The planet Blissey, our peaceful, nice, quiet planet where we established our VOG bases

1129
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:24,280
and here's me running to Bobby's base and it's going to show the message and so forth.

1130
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:32,560
The lovely planet, serene, quiet Blissey has lethal humidity outbreaks.

1131
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:39,260
I don't even know what that is to begin with, but sounds very 2020 as some folks are saying

1132
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:42,080
in chat, but yeah.

1133
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:47,220
So anyway, that just kind of cracked me up there as we were doing that.

1134
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:50,320
So anyway, there it is.

1135
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:55,740
A look back at, or a look forward as well as a look back at No Man's Sky.

1136
00:58:55,740 --> 00:59:00,640
So anyway, I do recommend the patch and checking out No Man's Sky.

1137
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,640
It's pretty cool.

1138
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:05,280
So, all right, let's go ahead and move on with some more stories.

1139
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,720
Loki, what do you have for us up next?

1140
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,080
All right.

1141
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:15,960
So Among Us is obviously very popular as of late and as such, the developers behind the

1142
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:21,420
game announced that Among Us 2, which was originally announced almost 40 days ago has

1143
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,420
now been canceled.

1144
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:29,180
They have canceled it because they are working on continuing to support the original game

1145
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:32,060
and the content for that because it's so popular.

1146
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:33,220
So it makes sense.

1147
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:40,080
You don't want to just like, you know, separate the crowd they're playing Among Us among two

1148
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,080
different games.

1149
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,740
Then you have to support two different games.

1150
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:48,300
It's just easier to put the content into the original one, which yeah, I'm fine with that.

1151
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,260
So pretty cool.

1152
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:52,260
Yep, yep.

1153
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:56,400
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I feel for the devs because the original game's code

1154
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:01,000
base sounds unwieldy to add to, like Minecraft's was, and they wanted to start over with all

1155
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
the lessons they learned.

1156
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Yeah.

1157
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,680
So it's an interesting kind of side effect of the game becoming so popular.

1158
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,960
It's almost like, oh crap, now we're stuck with this now.

1159
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:15,000
I mean, I get, they could have just done a part two, but maybe they're worried like,

1160
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,200
and I get it like a part two, there's a lot of risks that come with that, you know?

1161
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:26,360
Yeah, they could, I could see them doing something similar to like, well, probably a bad example

1162
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:31,520
but what Ingress did where they just, you know, redid the scanner, completely redesigned

1163
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,880
it from the ground up.

1164
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,240
They could do that with this game.

1165
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:38,720
So number two is technically number one, it's just like 2.0 or something like that.

1166
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:39,720
Oh.

1167
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,540
They just replaced the whole thing.

1168
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:45,080
We were just talking about a game that did something like that actually.

1169
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:47,560
So I guess that would make a lot of sense, right?

1170
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,560
Right, exactly.

1171
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:52,120
So I could see him doing something like that, but no, at least as long as they're still

1172
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,600
continuing to support it, I think it's still pretty good.

1173
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,600
Yeah.

1174
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:56,840
Okay, fair enough.

1175
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:57,840
All right.

1176
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:00,440
Well, let's move on talking about other updates.

1177
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:05,180
Let's talk about Animal Crossing, which is going to be getting a pretty large fall update.

1178
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:09,020
So there's going to be some Halloween events coming to Animal Crossing.

1179
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:11,040
Of course, there has to be Halloween events, right?

1180
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,040
Because all the games have had them.

1181
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,040
Yeah.

1182
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,760
And if you didn't know this about Animal Crossing, you can't just data mine it off the disc,

1183
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,920
the cartridge, whatever the files now, because they didn't even put in the holiday events

1184
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,700
because they didn't want people, or they probably weren't done yet, but they don't want people

1185
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,240
spoiling them either.

1186
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:28,120
So now they're going to be patching in the Halloween events since Halloween's coming

1187
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,120
up.

1188
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:34,120
And there's Jack the Lantern is going to be somebody that visits.

1189
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:39,140
He'll have Halloween goodies, and there'll be a Halloween event and game with candy that

1190
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:41,000
you buy and you give it to residents.

1191
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,580
There are also going to be pumpkins in the game, and it's going to be part of crafting.

1192
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:48,520
So no word if I'll get my pumpkin spice latte, but I imagine there'll be things like pumpkin

1193
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:52,400
chairs, pumpkin couches, pumpkin beds, which sounds fun, I guess.

1194
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,400
It is all launching this coming week, September 30th is when the new update is coming.

1195
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:01,760
Nintendo put out a video to their social media channels that shows everything to look forward

1196
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,760
to.

1197
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:07,780
There's going to be another patch that will introduce the holiday events coming in November,

1198
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:13,540
and I imagine they're not going to want to patch it in late December because of the holidays.

1199
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:16,520
Even if the holidays are a little different in Japan than they are here, it's just still,

1200
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,200
it's not a good time to be doing those patches.

1201
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:24,720
So November is probably when we're going to start to see that stuff pasted or patched

1202
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:28,240
into the game.

1203
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,120
On that note, I haven't touched Animal Crossing in a couple of weeks now.

1204
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:35,000
I think it finally wore off for me.

1205
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,520
That big stream we did a couple of weeks ago was probably like the last hurrah.

1206
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:41,960
I've played a couple of times since then, but I just got frustrated with the fact that

1207
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,400
I was not getting any more photos from villagers.

1208
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,720
I was visiting every single day, trading stuff, and I was not getting pictures.

1209
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:51,000
And I was like, you know what, there's nothing else for me to do in this game right now.

1210
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,320
I'm going to go play Hades instead.

1211
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,840
Yeah, my wife's been playing that to get photos now.

1212
01:02:55,840 --> 01:03:00,120
So she's been doing that and remodeling some of the island stuff.

1213
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,120
Maybe the fault.

1214
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:05,200
I mean, I would be lying if I said, oh, I'm not going to check it out anymore because

1215
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,040
I'm certainly not anti-Animal Crossing or anything.

1216
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,800
It's just, I think I just kind of wore the game out.

1217
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:13,520
But I think it's nice that this is coming because this will give me a reason to boot

1218
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:17,160
it up again and probably check it out a little bit.

1219
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:20,560
And yeah, I'll probably try to craft some of the pumpkin furniture and see what that's

1220
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:24,200
all about because, you know, everybody knows I love my pumpkin spice and stuff like that.

1221
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:28,720
So I'll see what kind of fun things I can craft to fit that theme.

1222
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:33,080
But then I'll probably get my time taken over with other games again.

1223
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,280
It tends to happen.

1224
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,240
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I haven't booted Animal Crossing since early July.

1225
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:43,120
I'm going to boot it up and find that my village is all flowers everywhere.

1226
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:49,640
I don't I'm my understanding is that the towns don't become overrun with weeds anymore.

1227
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:53,920
Like you'll get a day or two worth of weeds, but you're not going to have to clean up like

1228
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:59,740
a month worth of weeds or flower because the game, if you're not there, it doesn't rain.

1229
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:01,920
It's kind of the logic that the game follows.

1230
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:06,200
So if you booted it up tonight, you'd probably find that, yeah, you have a couple of days

1231
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,140
worth of damage, but it's not nearly as bad as you would think.

1232
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:12,940
And in some of the other games, have you been gone for a few months and villagers will reach

1233
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:16,580
you a little bit for not having checked in for a while, but then they'll just go on like

1234
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:17,580
nothing's ever happened.

1235
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:21,260
Like, oh, you just took a little vacation, whatever.

1236
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:24,420
Black and Pat says, I haven't booted it since Memorial Day weekend.

1237
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:25,420
Yeah.

1238
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:27,560
So there's a lot of people haven't checked in in a while to have it.

1239
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:31,740
If you're gone for a long time, that said, he just shouts at you for a while.

1240
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:32,740
Yeah.

1241
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:33,740
That would be fun.

1242
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:37,380
See a Tiberian chat says, I still log in at least once a day.

1243
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:39,700
So it's just different for everybody.

1244
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:43,360
And Bobby says, I did hear that villagers don't move out while you're gone.

1245
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:44,540
They used to in other games.

1246
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:49,880
That is also true because remember, villagers always ask for your permission to leave now.

1247
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,340
That is different from the other games.

1248
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:53,580
They used to just like leave.

1249
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:57,260
Like you turn on the game one day, bye, I left, I moved over and I packed my shit and

1250
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,040
left last night.

1251
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:03,780
And they don't do that anymore, which considering that the game is played by a lot of kids is

1252
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:09,180
probably a good thing because you know, there would be kids that would be gutted if a particular

1253
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:12,580
villager left their town overnight, because that's what happened to all of us and the

1254
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:13,580
GameCube version.

1255
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:15,580
Um, so yeah, that doesn't really happen.

1256
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:17,420
They didn't care about our feelings at all.

1257
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:18,420
Yeah.

1258
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,140
Back then game companies didn't care about you.

1259
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:26,300
So anyway, uh, no one special 77 chat says people probably have checked in on their Neopets

1260
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:27,340
in decades.

1261
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,460
They're probably all decomposed by now.

1262
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:30,460
Digital dust.

1263
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:31,460
No.

1264
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:34,220
If you log into Neopets, if you can remember your login and password, they're all still

1265
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:35,220
there.

1266
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:39,060
I believe they're probably changed a little bit, but, uh, no, your Neopets do not die.

1267
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:45,900
If you haven't fed them in 20 years, um, it's magic and what's the point then.

1268
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,220
All right.

1269
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:51,280
Let's move on with more news Loki.

1270
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:55,580
So this is kind of disappointing to hear from a first party company, but apparently Sony

1271
01:05:55,580 --> 01:06:01,500
has confirmed that there is no free PlayStation five upgrade for the PlayStation four Spider-Man.

1272
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:06,500
Um, that's not to say that it's not incredibly confusing.

1273
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,580
So let me try to explain it a little bit.

1274
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:10,100
It's the way this works.

1275
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:15,140
So if you purchase the original Spider-Man game on PlayStation four, well, you're not

1276
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:22,040
going to get an upgrade to the PlayStation five without rebuying the Marvel's, um, Spider-Man

1277
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:26,740
Miles Morales, which the ultimate edition on that is, I believe, I don't remember they're

1278
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:29,720
calling out cross play or cross by or whatever.

1279
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:35,140
So basically you get a PlayStation four and PlayStation five version from that.

1280
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:37,820
And they throw in the original game as a bonus.

1281
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:42,700
So they're making the original remaster, but they're not going to give it to you if

1282
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:46,340
you've already paid them money, uh, allegedly.

1283
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:52,860
And then, um, apparently though, there is also a $20 paid upgrade that you can bump

1284
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:56,060
up the, um, Miles Morales ultimate edition.

1285
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:57,060
I'm sorry.

1286
01:06:57,060 --> 01:07:01,900
So you can buy Miles Morales, um, version of the game and it's just that, or you can

1287
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:05,740
buy the ultimate edition, which also throws in the original game as well.

1288
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:13,660
Um, it's confusing, but this kind of just goes to show you how Sony is taking this next

1289
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:16,060
generation of, um, consoles.

1290
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:23,640
So they are basically making you pay for every little bit of upgrade and whatnot for these

1291
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:29,020
games, much like some of these third party companies are, um, like Activision is wanting,

1292
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:31,320
you know, $70 for their games as well.

1293
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:36,320
Sony is also charging $70 for their games because they want the money from that.

1294
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:43,520
This is why I am very skeptical on the fact that we will never see a service like games

1295
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,520
pass.

1296
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,960
I think, I mean, I guess they have PlayStation now, but it's not the same where it can download

1297
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:51,080
the game, run it natively on the system.

1298
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:52,680
Um, sure.

1299
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:53,960
There'll be PlayStation two games.

1300
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:57,780
And the fact that I think there's more PlayStation two games coming out this week, but they're

1301
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:59,960
going to sell them to you.

1302
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:04,160
They're not going to give them to you as part of this service or all inclusive thing.

1303
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:08,280
They're going to piecemeal it all out to make as much money as they can off of it.

1304
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:13,720
Um, whereas you have, you know, Nintendo also doing kind of a similar approach where they

1305
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:19,720
don't want to put many titles in their online catalogs because they're worried that devalues

1306
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:20,720
their titles.

1307
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:23,360
That's why they never dropped the price on their titles.

1308
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:28,440
Well and there's, there's also the answer as to why you never got like a, uh, Nintendo

1309
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:36,200
64 mini is because with the Nintendo 64 mini, um, you would now have Mario 64 included.

1310
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:41,120
And that's something that they want you to get in the Mario three D all-stars.

1311
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:46,840
I think it's also because they couldn't redo the hardware that they had because the SNES

1312
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:54,840
mini and the Nintendo mini, the NES mini, I guess, um, both ran on identical hardware.

1313
01:08:54,840 --> 01:09:01,160
And so they could essentially just repurpose that they can't do that for Nintendo 64.

1314
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,920
It barely works.

1315
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:10,480
You can put into the 64 games on those consoles if you mod them, but it doesn't run well.

1316
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,400
They would have to develop new hardware for that.

1317
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,800
And so there's a cost associated with that.

1318
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:19,880
Plus the system would have to be more expensive and it's whether they're going to make their

1319
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:20,880
money back on it.

1320
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,680
So it's just not cost effective for them to do that one.

1321
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:29,720
They could just put out, you know, as collection of emulated games and sell for 60 bucks.

1322
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:30,720
Yeah.

1323
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:34,480
Uh, I don't think this is the right call for Sony.

1324
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:38,600
Um, you know, I understand games cost money to make, they've got to pay the people to

1325
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,600
develop them.

1326
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:44,640
Um, I would have been a little more comfortable maybe with a paid upgrade that isn't quite

1327
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,160
the full cost of the game.

1328
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:49,760
Um, but I think this decision might bite them a little bit because I can tell you for me

1329
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:53,600
personally, I never did get Spiderman for PlayStation four.

1330
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,800
I probably would have when it went on a big sale later on.

1331
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,000
Um, but I can tell you, I'm not going to now.

1332
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,720
Now that I know it's not going to upgrade to the PlayStation five version, well, I'm

1333
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:05,360
just going to hold off until I get a PlayStation five, then I'll revisit Spiderman at that

1334
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,360
point.

1335
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:09,360
Um, wrong call in my opinion.

1336
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:16,000
And again, it's something that the competition, Microsoft is approaching a bit differently.

1337
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,640
And uh, I just, I hate to see it.

1338
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,640
It's a little frustrating.

1339
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:21,640
I get it.

1340
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:22,640
That not everything is free.

1341
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:23,640
Yeah.

1342
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:24,640
There does.

1343
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,920
It's some of the stuff does cost money.

1344
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:33,000
My take on it though, is that the additional assets that they're creating for miles Morales,

1345
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,040
I mean, they're creating a PlayStation five version, so they have to create the assets,

1346
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,960
whether they're not, you know, whether or not they're going to be using it for this

1347
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,300
original game or not, they're already being created.

1348
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:44,520
They're already selling you that, that game anyways.

1349
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:49,200
Like I don't understand if they already have this version of the game available, like how

1350
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,640
much money are you really losing on that?

1351
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:55,400
I mean, it's just, it's just weird though, that they wouldn't do that.

1352
01:10:55,400 --> 01:11:00,200
I guess that the point is that, well, if you really want to remaster, then you'll want

1353
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:03,720
to purchase this additional thing, but they're just trying to get another sale out of you.

1354
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:07,600
Or as Microsoft, I think would just, a lot of these are free upgrades.

1355
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:08,600
How about this?

1356
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:12,640
You know, cause this would go back to the point I made earlier about, I think that,

1357
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:18,060
you know, no, Microsoft will not sell as many Xboxes this generation as Sony sells PlayStation

1358
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:19,060
five.

1359
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:23,900
And especially when you factor in Japan, however, uh, that's not the fight Microsoft's fighting.

1360
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:28,340
Again, it's about how, who has more subscribers to their service at the end of this generation.

1361
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:35,780
And so my point is, what if Sony made it free for PlayStation plus to get those upgrades?

1362
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:40,900
And now that would be an added benefit about PlayStation plus that could be interesting.

1363
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:41,900
And I could go for that.

1364
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:42,900
Yeah.

1365
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:46,700
But they're not going to do that because of course they're not, but I'm trying to, I'm

1366
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:48,820
trying to get her online play.

1367
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:51,140
And so it's, it's not an, it's on an upsell.

1368
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:55,820
They give an answer that still gives Sony some money.

1369
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:59,680
I'm trying to go to a reasonable answer that still allows Sony to get some money.

1370
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:00,820
They want all of the money.

1371
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:04,940
That's why they won't give up Spiderman for the MCU and stuff because they want, they

1372
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:05,940
want that money.

1373
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:14,900
And on, I mean, it just, it's, I don't know if people are going to remember it even beyond

1374
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:20,140
like this, if they continue to do this, go down this path with this generation, but like,

1375
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:25,540
it just, it's, it, what little money you're losing from this, you could build so much

1376
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:28,460
goodwill from it, but they just don't care.

1377
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:32,500
And it's, I don't know, they want all of the pennies.

1378
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:38,880
So we'll see how that strategy pays off, but you know, again, I think when it comes to

1379
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:43,460
places like Japan, it's not going to matter, you know, and Spiderman doesn't exist anywhere

1380
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:45,220
besides PlayStation.

1381
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:48,780
So they kind of get to call the shots.

1382
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:50,860
Not a lot we can do about it besides not buy it.

1383
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:51,860
So, yeah.

1384
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:52,860
All right.

1385
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:53,860
Moving on.

1386
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:59,580
I want to talk a little bit about iOS and Microsoft getting an app on iOS, but it's

1387
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:01,220
not quite the one you're thinking of.

1388
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:05,140
It is not the whole cloud issue being resolved, but I'm going to come back to that point in

1389
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:06,140
just a moment.

1390
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:11,820
Let's we'll come back to that for now, though, an Xbox remote play app is coming to iOS.

1391
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:17,260
So yes, this feature is being tested right now, and apparently it will allow you to connect

1392
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:23,460
directly to your Xbox One or, of course, the upcoming consoles like Series X, S, et cetera,

1393
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:26,200
and it will let you play anything that's on your system.

1394
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:31,180
So it's kind of interesting that the cloud thing doesn't work, but this does, but since

1395
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:36,660
you're connecting to your own system and it's, I guess there's just a difference there, and

1396
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:40,240
it's all kind of like streaming within your own house or what have you.

1397
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:43,880
So you will be able to use this app to do that.

1398
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:45,940
Again, this is different from X cloud.

1399
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:48,860
You are streaming from your own box.

1400
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:54,200
So I don't think that means you could do that out off cellular.

1401
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,620
Maybe you can.

1402
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:58,320
Could you play off cellular to your own Xbox One?

1403
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,720
I'll be a fan with hog.

1404
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:04,280
Probably a lot of the networks out there, but when we finally get better 5G coverage

1405
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:06,340
and there's a bandwidth out there.

1406
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:12,060
Which if rumors are to be believed is going to be an iOS later this year is 5G.

1407
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:18,780
Well, they can have whatever they want in iOS, but it's whether the networks are actually

1408
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:19,780
out there.

1409
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:20,780
That's going to matter.

1410
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:21,780
Right?

1411
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:22,780
Yeah.

1412
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:23,780
So good.

1413
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:24,780
They support it.

1414
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:25,780
Great.

1415
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:26,780
But like that doesn't actually build the network.

1416
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:28,940
So, um, I don't know.

1417
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:30,860
I don't know if the bandwidth's out there for that.

1418
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:37,020
It would be a cool way to get around, uh, get around the whole iOS problem, you know,

1419
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:41,480
just stream game pass to your console then stream that to your, I mean, there's more

1420
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:45,140
latency built up there, but maybe it's not so bad.

1421
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:50,020
Um, well, since you brought up getting around the iOS store, something we didn't talk about

1422
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:53,760
in the Luna thing, which I think now's a good time to bring it up since we're talking about,

1423
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:58,300
you know, Microsoft kind of finding a way into the app store, Luna has figured out how

1424
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:00,020
to get an iOS app.

1425
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:02,080
And basically what they're doing, they're doing something.

1426
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:07,480
This has been around in iOS for a long time, but very few people actually make use of it.

1427
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:10,020
And that is a web app.

1428
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:14,380
Basically all you're doing, you're making a website bookmark and you, it launches like

1429
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:16,460
it's an app because that's what it is.

1430
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:19,420
It's a website bookmark that it's just an app on your phone.

1431
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:27,020
And so Luna has figured out how to run in a Safari browser window at full speed.

1432
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:31,660
Maybe this is something where Microsoft isn't at yet, but what's very interesting too.

1433
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:35,620
If you look in some of the Microsoft legal filings and things like that, Microsoft or

1434
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:39,220
Apple, I'm sorry, in the Apple legal filings.

1435
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:44,660
And so that in the Epic versus Epic Apple versus Epic thing, good Lord, um, Apple has

1436
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:50,940
even said if they went down this route of having web apps, this would not be an issue.

1437
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:52,920
This is a solution for them.

1438
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:59,340
It's just something they're not doing, um, because I believe the backloading of Fortnite

1439
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:04,440
on Android devices to go around, uh, the store was a similar thing.

1440
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:08,400
I think you were loading it from like a web app type of thing, and it wasn't quite as

1441
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:11,160
well adopted as it was coming from the store.

1442
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:17,760
So I think the, well, that one was downloading an APK on the iOS side.

1443
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:18,760
I'm not sure.

1444
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:26,360
The Android side, it was downloading a siloed in APK to load it in, but, um, that obviously

1445
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:32,040
you get a whole bunch of popups saying, Oh, this is not secure, dangerous viruses beware.

1446
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,920
Yeah, I get that.

1447
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:40,260
So, um, so it's interesting, but Luna somehow is going to be, cause I can't think of a lot

1448
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:42,960
of things I've actually saved as web apps.

1449
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,660
I remember an early, early conversation.

1450
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:50,620
Obviously Bobby remembers this too, um, where we were talking about like having like VOG

1451
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:55,820
or maybe it was even the old network at one point having like a web app that would launch

1452
01:16:55,820 --> 01:17:03,380
and you could have the, I think the old networks radio player trying to encourage people to

1453
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:04,660
install that as a web app.

1454
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:07,420
And it's just, it's kind of hard to get that adoption.

1455
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:11,860
So I kind of wonder how Luna thinks it's going to get adopted.

1456
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:14,500
Maybe because it is, this is a much bigger deal.

1457
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:18,820
This is not some indie podcast networks, little remote player.

1458
01:17:18,820 --> 01:17:23,620
This is how to play control and luminous and res infinite, and it's an Amazon product and

1459
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:26,720
it'll be advertised on Twitch and all this stuff.

1460
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:29,460
Maybe they figured they're going to get a better adoption rate for it, for the whole

1461
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:30,900
concept of a web app.

1462
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:32,200
I don't know.

1463
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:38,020
But anyway, Microsoft could ultimately go down the same route if they can get X cloud

1464
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:41,220
working in a Safari window.

1465
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:43,700
Um, which we'll see.

1466
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:46,820
You know, and I don't just mean working, I mean working well.

1467
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:51,060
You know, because, you know, if it stutters, if it lags, that's all going to look bad on

1468
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:52,060
Microsoft.

1469
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:53,060
It's not going to look bad on Apple.

1470
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:54,500
It's only bad on Microsoft.

1471
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:59,880
So be interesting to see if they figure out a way to resolve that.

1472
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:04,700
By the way, there's another app from Microsoft and Xbox coming to iOS.

1473
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:07,420
So there's lots of apps for Xbox on iOS.

1474
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:09,540
It's just not, you know, the one everybody's talking about.

1475
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:13,980
In fact, I think most of our audience will probably not care about this, but some of

1476
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:14,980
you will.

1477
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:17,820
It's the Xbox Family Sharing app.

1478
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:20,700
You know, Nintendo kind of has something like this too, and they have a cute little animation

1479
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:21,700
for this.

1480
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:23,940
And this is very common these days now.

1481
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:28,480
It's basically an app from your phone that allows you to credit your kid or teen or whoever's

1482
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:33,280
playing on the Xbox credit time, screen time, and you can limit it so that like they only

1483
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:36,560
get an hour on the Xbox a day during the week.

1484
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:39,840
Maybe you can add bonus time if they've done their homework, which is kind of interesting.

1485
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:44,560
It actually shows the little concept video, like one of the kids in the house sending

1486
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:50,200
a message to the parents app, can I have more time on the Xbox and the parent can like accept

1487
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:53,720
or decline right there, which I think is kind of interesting.

1488
01:18:53,720 --> 01:19:00,280
Is this now, Loki, you have kids, they're not maybe quite at that age yet where they're

1489
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,280
running this.

1490
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:04,960
Well, maybe actually, maybe I don't know, you'd have to tell me, are they running the

1491
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:09,240
consoles by themselves at this point, or do they still need your help?

1492
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:11,780
And is this an app that you would use in your household?

1493
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:15,080
I know you don't have Xbox, but hypothetically.

1494
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,600
I don't have Xbox yet.

1495
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,400
You ordered an X though, right?

1496
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:20,400
Exactly.

1497
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,400
Right.

1498
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:22,400
Yeah.

1499
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,400
I forgot to get into my game week.

1500
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:24,400
Yeah.

1501
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,400
I did get a pre-order for an Xbox Series X.

1502
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,440
So we never talked about that.

1503
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:28,440
Yeah.

1504
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:31,200
We'll come back to that in a little bit, the pre-order game.

1505
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:37,800
But I do actually use this because we have Microsoft accounts for, well, he has it for

1506
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:41,800
Roblox and for Minecraft.

1507
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:46,840
So he has to have a Microsoft store account in order to be able to do that.

1508
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:51,400
I did have family settings on there at one point, but then it got like annoying because

1509
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:55,160
we were trying to like do friends, like add each other as friends.

1510
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:58,240
Like I was trying to have my youngest son and it just was a pain in the butt to get

1511
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,240
it to work right.

1512
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:01,960
I made him an adult nerd.

1513
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:05,680
But now he still has to ask me for permission to be able to buy something from the store

1514
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:08,720
because he doesn't have a payment card on file.

1515
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,640
But it was annoying.

1516
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:17,680
He's still a child account, but he took all the restrictions off of it as far as being

1517
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:21,120
able to add friends and stuff like that.

1518
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,940
Well, he sells the restrictions on it, but I had to do it to be able to add myself on

1519
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:27,200
there as so we could all play together.

1520
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:33,840
It's very frustrating to do the basic stuff on there, but they make it that way on purpose

1521
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,800
so that you can really lock it down if you want.

1522
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:41,480
But I get like emails and stuff of like how much time he's been spending in different

1523
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:42,800
apps and stuff like that.

1524
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,880
So yeah, so that would be kind of neat.

1525
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:51,520
I mean, he just doesn't play Xbox and he's probably not going to be playing the Xbox.

1526
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:56,400
No one special 77 in chat over Twitch TV slash vog network says on paper, this sounds good,

1527
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:57,960
but in practice, I don't know.

1528
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:59,600
The typical kid ain't stupid.

1529
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:03,360
If you thought we were tech savvy as kids compared to our parents, kids nowadays are

1530
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,720
more so they'll find a way around this.

1531
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:09,960
Well, the tools do get better, but I will agree as some kids.

1532
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,200
Well, some kids figure out how to social engineer.

1533
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,200
That's what I did.

1534
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,200
Wink.

1535
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,200
You.

1536
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:19,960
And what I mean by social engineer is, oh, I got to help you fix your computer here,

1537
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:22,080
but it's asking me for your password to fix the computer.

1538
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,720
What's the password?

1539
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:29,040
And then you figure out your parents password by helping with something.

1540
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,600
And oh, how about that?

1541
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,840
It's the same password that lets me do these other things.

1542
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:39,560
I'm not saying I did or did not do that as a kid.

1543
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:45,680
But I will say my mom had a certain fondness for a certain Hawaiian Island.

1544
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:47,680
Anyway.

1545
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:51,520
All right.

1546
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,240
Let's see.

1547
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:54,240
Other comment.

1548
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,000
In chat I was going to read right now.

1549
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
So OK.

1550
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,080
So we'll see what develops with these apps and so forth with Microsoft.

1551
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:03,920
I'm curious to see if they jump on the whole web app thing.

1552
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,520
We're going to get to the classic game of the week here.

1553
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:10,720
But actually, before I do, let me insert because you reminded us here, yes, with all this talk

1554
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:15,680
and it's been a fairly busy gaming newsweek between Tokyo Game Show and this huge news

1555
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:18,560
about Microsoft and ZeniMax and all that going on.

1556
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:25,360
So we didn't even talk about that Xbox Series X and S preorders happened this week.

1557
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:30,280
And we mentioned on last week's show, I said I am going to preorder Xbox this time.

1558
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:33,000
I did not preorder PlayStation 5 yet.

1559
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,040
That will be a 2021 thing.

1560
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,840
But I did decide to get Xbox Series X this year.

1561
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:40,660
And Loki also decided to get on the Xbox game.

1562
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:44,040
So how did it go for you with the preorder, Loki?

1563
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,320
It was rather pain free.

1564
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:49,360
I mean, sure, there were sites that were buggy and stuff.

1565
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:53,680
So I tried getting it from a few different places at first, but then it kept saying sold

1566
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:57,160
out.

1567
01:22:57,160 --> 01:23:01,200
I ended up getting it through Walmart originally.

1568
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:07,480
And it like three times when I processed it, it kept saying that they were sold out, even

1569
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:08,880
though I had got one.

1570
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:14,400
And by the third time, then it finally went through, even though I was in like that confirm

1571
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,400
thing.

1572
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:19,640
I was just hitting confirm on it and it finally it went through once and I was like, cool,

1573
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:20,640
done.

1574
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:25,640
But like Amazon, I know immediately the site just crashed immediately or like we were getting

1575
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:32,080
the you know, the something's wrong dogs, you know, and then Best Buy and even Microsoft

1576
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:33,080
site.

1577
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,460
It was just all like unavailable for a while.

1578
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:43,120
So luckily, I was able to just be there right at eight when it went live and ended up taking,

1579
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:47,520
you know, a preorder with Walmart site before I had like some other stuff.

1580
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:50,400
So it just made sense to do it there.

1581
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,660
Congrats.

1582
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:54,240
So I was looking right at eight a.m.

1583
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,720
I was trying to look at a few sites.

1584
01:23:55,720 --> 01:24:00,800
I was trying to look at Costco because that was on the original list on Microsoft's original

1585
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:01,800
press release.

1586
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:02,800
Costco is there.

1587
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,800
I don't think they ever did take preorders to Series X.

1588
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,040
So I'm sitting there trying to load it.

1589
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:07,040
Nothing's showing up.

1590
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,400
So I'm like, whatever.

1591
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,560
I'm just going to kind of do it.

1592
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:10,800
A lot of people on Twitter do it.

1593
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:16,560
And I'm going to watch that Wario 64 account, which, you know, hey, props to the guy.

1594
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:21,880
He's very good at or I guess it could be gal or non-binary running that account because

1595
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:22,880
they've never shown their face.

1596
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,200
It's just a personality.

1597
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:31,280
So with Wario 64 account, they get like all the latest, you know, oh, these sites are

1598
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:32,280
preordered into.

1599
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:37,940
Now, if you didn't know this, they're hiding referral codes in those Amazon links.

1600
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:43,420
So all y'all that were using that account for your Amazon like that guy just got a salary

1601
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:47,700
for the whole month off all and probably then some from all your preorders for the Xbox

1602
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:49,620
Series X and PlayStation 5.

1603
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:50,620
You know what?

1604
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:51,620
Yeah.

1605
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:52,700
You know what he's doing?

1606
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,280
He's doing a service.

1607
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,280
You're using the service.

1608
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:56,440
It's not costing you anything.

1609
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:58,180
So I'm not I'm not hating on him.

1610
01:24:58,180 --> 01:25:02,460
I'm just saying that's you know, that ain't nothing free, bitch.

1611
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:05,440
Anyway, that's what I'm saying.

1612
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:11,520
So I was watching that account in one window and I saw that Target was up and I was having

1613
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:14,020
that problem where I'd add it to the cart.

1614
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:15,020
My cart doesn't load.

1615
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:17,980
My cart's empty and all that other stuff.

1616
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:20,660
So I was just hitting the wall and I was like, why is Amazon up?

1617
01:25:20,660 --> 01:25:21,820
Why is Amazon up?

1618
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:26,640
Then I see that tweet from Wario go up that says it's up on Amazon.

1619
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:31,060
But instead of clicking the link, I went and I wasn't doing it to be a bitch and go around

1620
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:32,060
the referral.

1621
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:36,160
I was doing it because I didn't know what that was going to link to.

1622
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:38,660
And I wanted to make sure it was everything.

1623
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:41,040
I wanted to make sure it was the right vendor.

1624
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:46,660
So I searched Xbox Series X and I did confirm it was a Series X.

1625
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:51,680
Yes, I heard the stories about the 1Xs that went up and sailed, but it was a Series X.

1626
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:55,980
And I went in and I preordered it and I got it.

1627
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:58,880
And then I heard the link's not working, all this other stuff.

1628
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,080
Like people were complaining about the links.

1629
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:01,800
I think what happened.

1630
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:05,680
I think to get around bots or to get around the site getting hammered, I think Amazon

1631
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:10,780
was cycling those links or killing those links like every 60 seconds.

1632
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:12,720
I really think that's what they were doing.

1633
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:17,700
So I think searching for it by hand allowed me to get in there pretty early and problem

1634
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:19,080
free.

1635
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:23,820
However, like many of you about a week later, no, not a week later, but a few days later,

1636
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:26,280
I got that email from Amazon.

1637
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:30,360
We're sorry to inform you that because of the demand of this item, you may not get it

1638
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:35,160
on the day, but everybody got that email for the Xbox and everybody got that email

1639
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:37,400
for the PlayStation 5.

1640
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:43,900
I don't know why it's so fucking difficult for these stores to handle this, especially

1641
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:45,120
in the PlayStation 5.

1642
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:49,320
I get it because it was, you know, all the oxygen free free for all.

1643
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:56,740
But in the Microsoft side, everybody knew when this was coming.

1644
01:26:56,740 --> 01:27:01,320
And so it's a little difficult and it's a little disappointing to see that the sites

1645
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:07,360
still could not handle it.

1646
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:11,140
Concert tickets seem to work, but we might have to look at getting another system or

1647
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:16,060
something to preorder because this is getting really annoying.

1648
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:17,060
I don't know.

1649
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:21,460
I would have thought that Sony doing it the way they were doing it where you would sign

1650
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:23,500
up to do a preorder.

1651
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:30,300
I thought that was going to work, but Sony was completely unclear and not transparent

1652
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:36,140
on who got invited to do it and when they made it sound like only Sony elite were going

1653
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:37,600
to be able to do it.

1654
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,340
And so that was kind of stupid.

1655
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:46,560
So I really wish other retailers might adopt a similar strategy where you sign up in advance

1656
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:51,940
and you have to have either like you've you've to F-age your to F-age your phone number.

1657
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:55,140
You have to have an existing account where you've bought at least one item on the site

1658
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:59,980
somewhere or something that would make it a lot harder for bots and scalpers to get

1659
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:00,980
in there.

1660
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:02,980
I don't know.

1661
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:04,100
Some other stories in chat.

1662
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:08,860
Black Compat says it took me an hour to check out my cart on the Microsoft store site.

1663
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:14,780
I had a Series X in my cart at 1106 Eastern completed the process finally shortly after

1664
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:16,360
noon my time.

1665
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:19,300
That's probably around the time I finally got through or I got through on Amazon.

1666
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:22,980
I heard the Microsoft store itself was having some problems.

1667
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:26,780
So that all was kind of an unfortunate experience.

1668
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:28,120
I don't know what to say about it.

1669
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:34,800
As far as my own Xbox, whatever at this point, if I get one launch day, cool.

1670
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:40,580
If I have to wait a few more weeks, whatever, you know.

1671
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:44,080
Worst case scenario, I walk into a store and I buy one there and then I just cancel the

1672
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:45,080
Amazon preorder.

1673
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:47,340
At least they don't charge you till they actually ship it.

1674
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:52,660
It's kind of one of those things where it's like, sure, I'd like to have it on day one,

1675
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:56,340
but maybe the events of this year have just put a lot of things into perspective where

1676
01:28:56,340 --> 01:29:01,220
it's like, some things are more important and if I don't have an Xbox Series X the very

1677
01:29:01,220 --> 01:29:05,220
first day, I will be able to go on with my life.

1678
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:09,620
I was just looking for also the accessories and stuff because I'm like, okay, cool.

1679
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:11,180
Got the preorder.

1680
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:13,940
What's going to be a launch day game?

1681
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:14,940
I don't know.

1682
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:16,740
I don't know what's launching.

1683
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:18,180
I don't know what the launch games are.

1684
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:23,140
I don't even know where can I get another controller?

1685
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:24,140
Where is all this stuff?

1686
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:27,180
Because none of it was on their websites.

1687
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:31,380
So I guess I'll just have to wait and find that out, but like, I don't even know what.

1688
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:32,380
Game pass.

1689
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:36,660
Game pass will just be where my day one stuff comes from.

1690
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:42,100
And again, the enhanced backwards compatibility stuff that they're promising will make older.

1691
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:49,380
I'm really excited to start No Man's Sky again on Xbox Series X because I don't see how it's

1692
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:55,580
not going to really run at like a PC equivalent on the Series X.

1693
01:29:55,580 --> 01:30:00,220
And I don't know what type of things the developers are doing to bump that up, but I would imagine

1694
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:05,540
it's going to run very well on the eventual PlayStation 5 release, however they do that,

1695
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:06,660
and Xbox Series X.

1696
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:10,500
And that is kind of nice, especially after these stories about Spider-Man, you have to

1697
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:11,500
pay again.

1698
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:16,060
It is nice to know that on Xbox Series X and Game Pass, I'll be able to play No Man's Sky

1699
01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:19,420
in sweet, sweet 4K that first day.

1700
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:23,180
I guess I'll have my cross-play stuff that I completely forgot about because I have it

1701
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:30,300
on PC, like Crackdown 3 and Forza Horizon 4, and I'm sure there's other things when

1702
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:36,420
I still had Xbox Live Gold that I was adding stuff in, so who knows?

1703
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:37,420
It'll be a surprise.

1704
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:41,340
Yeah, and I talked about this when I talked about getting an Xbox versus a PlayStation.

1705
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:47,420
I feel like PlayStation, okay, they have Spider-Man Miles Morales and they have the Demon's Souls

1706
01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:51,260
remake, neither of which are games I'm that...

1707
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:55,220
I'm like, okay, I'll check them out eventually, but do I need them day one?

1708
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:56,220
Nah.

1709
01:30:56,220 --> 01:31:01,780
So I'm going to instead address the discrepancy at home that I have a PS4 Pro, but an old

1710
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:06,180
Xbox One, so I'm going to bring up Microsoft and at some point I'll catch PlayStation up

1711
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:07,420
as well next year.

1712
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:12,460
I just don't need to spend $1,000 on consoles and a new TV on top of that because I don't

1713
01:31:12,460 --> 01:31:14,660
have a 4K TV, but I got to fix that too.

1714
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:17,460
So something's got to wait for next year, and so it's going to be the PlayStation 5.

1715
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:20,300
Yeah, I need to get a 4K monitor.

1716
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:21,300
Yeah.

1717
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:22,300
All right.

1718
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:24,700
Now let's travel back to simpler times.

1719
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:26,740
Let's go back to the past.

1720
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:32,740
We're going to go back to a simple time when games, you know, you didn't have to have a

1721
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:34,480
4K TV to play them on.

1722
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:43,320
You played them on your CRT television in glorious 320 pixel resolution, and you liked

1723
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:44,320
it.

1724
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:46,600
It's the classic game of the week, and usually...

1725
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:47,600
240, I mean.

1726
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:48,600
Was it 240?

1727
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:49,600
I thought it was like 320.

1728
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:50,600
It's 240p.

1729
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:53,720
I guess it depends on what system it was.

1730
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:57,560
Anyhow, Dark Sakura would usually be here and step into the gaming vault and find a

1731
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:02,440
game that she thinks, hey, you brats should be checking this game out, but she is off

1732
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:03,440
tonight for Yom Kippur.

1733
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:04,480
She's not here with the show.

1734
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,840
She'll be back next week.

1735
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:10,400
So I have decided to fill in with a choice here, and I feel like this is one Loki might

1736
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:11,400
approve of.

1737
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,400
I don't know.

1738
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:18,840
We'll find out, but I have chosen a game that probably was most famous on the NES, and that's

1739
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:23,080
where the B-roll footage comes from tonight, but it was also very popular on Commodore

1740
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:28,920
64 and a lot of other 80s and late 80s types of computing systems.

1741
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:34,600
The classic game of the week tonight is Skate or Die.

1742
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:35,600
That's right.

1743
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:36,600
Skate or Die.

1744
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:38,320
Did you like this game, Loki?

1745
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:42,640
Yeah, I used to play with my friend down the street all the time.

1746
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,280
He had it on the NES.

1747
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:47,120
Why did this guy in Skate or Die look like Rodney Dangerfield?

1748
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:49,120
I never understood that.

1749
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,120
Was it...

1750
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:51,120
I mean, and he was called Rodney.

1751
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:52,840
That's the creator of the game, I think.

1752
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:53,840
No, it's not.

1753
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:54,840
No.

1754
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:55,840
I think...

1755
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,640
Rodney Dangerfield didn't make Skate or Die, Loki.

1756
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:00,760
No, I understand that.

1757
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:02,520
I thought that the guy that made it was...

1758
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:04,120
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.

1759
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:09,680
No, but his name is actually Rodney Recluse, so he even has the same name, except he has

1760
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:11,960
a tattoo and purple hair and stuff.

1761
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:14,200
His son, Bionic Lester, that might have...

1762
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:16,920
Bionic Lester might be the developer, I don't know.

1763
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:23,840
But the other guy is Rodney Dangerfield, and I never really understood why.

1764
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,640
Nobody's ever really explained this to me.

1765
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:27,280
All right, anyway.

1766
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:30,720
Tigerclaw in chat says maybe they were Rodney Dangerfield fans at the time.

1767
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:36,200
Still, maybe it was easier to steal people's likenesses in the 80s than it is today.

1768
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:37,200
Yes, probably.

1769
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:38,200
Just like, I don't know.

1770
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:39,200
Who are we gonna make this guy look like?

1771
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,200
Rodney Dangerfield.

1772
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:41,200
I don't know.

1773
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:42,200
Anyway.

1774
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:48,000
All right, so this game was released by Electronic Arts, and it was released on the ZX Spectrum,

1775
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:55,260
Commodore 64, Atari ST, the Apple II, GS, the Amstrad, and IBM's under MS-DOS.

1776
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:59,960
It was also on the NES by Konami, but of course, published by Ultra Games, which was

1777
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:03,860
how they got around the three games a year limitation in the US.

1778
01:34:03,860 --> 01:34:06,580
Codemasters ended up handling the Atari version.

1779
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:10,660
Now, what's interesting about this game, it's kind of inspired by, even though it wasn't

1780
01:34:10,660 --> 01:34:19,500
made by Epyx, it was kind of in the style of the Epyx summer games, winter games, California

1781
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:20,500
games.

1782
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:22,740
You know all those games that Epyx did back in the day, right?

1783
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:24,880
This is kind of that, okay?

1784
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:26,260
But it's all skating.

1785
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:30,980
I mean, obviously, I think Half-Pipe was one of the games in California games.

1786
01:34:30,980 --> 01:34:34,300
But they kind of made their own version of one of those types of games, and that's what

1787
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:36,420
Skate or Die essentially is.

1788
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:38,580
It's a minigame collection.

1789
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:40,700
Wii Sports was a minigame collection.

1790
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:44,740
You know, a lot of times with the sports games, these minigames collections do pretty good.

1791
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:49,560
So the original version was the Commodore 64 version.

1792
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:52,100
There were three programmers that made that, okay?

1793
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:56,700
They were previously with Epyx, so that's why, you know, you can say it was inspired

1794
01:34:56,700 --> 01:35:00,500
by those types of games, and those were the games that they had worked on.

1795
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:06,180
This game was inspired by 720, which I believe Jamie's covered on this show before.

1796
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:12,540
If not, we've certainly talked about it, which y'all know that as the popular coin-op skateboarding

1797
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:19,420
game that Atari made that ran off the same hardware that like Indiana Jones and Final

1798
01:35:19,420 --> 01:35:24,340
Lap or whatever their racing game was called, all that ran off the same hardware.

1799
01:35:24,340 --> 01:35:29,520
There were several events, freestyle ramp event, high jump, there were downhill events,

1800
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:34,540
the downhill race and a downhill jam, and then there was a pool joust, or an empty pool

1801
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:37,260
you would kind of skate and try to knock another person over.

1802
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:38,740
That was kind of interesting.

1803
01:35:38,740 --> 01:35:42,380
So yeah, the game did pretty well.

1804
01:35:42,380 --> 01:35:44,460
It was known for its intro music.

1805
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:50,780
Again, the original version was the Commodore 64 version, and that was composed by Rob Hubbard,

1806
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:54,580
and it had a very Commodore 64 SID chip sound to it.

1807
01:35:54,580 --> 01:35:59,980
It actually was redone by Kuji Murata for the NES version.

1808
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:06,980
So the NES intro is that same Commodore 64 intro just redone for the NES chip sound set,

1809
01:36:06,980 --> 01:36:08,500
which I think is kind of interesting.

1810
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:15,540
So it sold over 100,000 copies, which isn't too shabby for a video game in that era.

1811
01:36:15,540 --> 01:36:18,220
And there were some follow-ups to this as well.

1812
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:21,420
There was Ski or Die, did you ever play Ski or Die?

1813
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:23,380
No, but I've heard of it.

1814
01:36:23,380 --> 01:36:25,980
I think I did play the sequel though.

1815
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:27,900
It was very similar.

1816
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:34,100
And then there was also Skate or Die 2, but Skate or Die 2 was only on the NES, and that

1817
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:35,600
was in 1990.

1818
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:41,640
So Skate or Die 2 also kind of wasn't the same like mini game format that the other

1819
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:43,180
games were.

1820
01:36:43,180 --> 01:36:46,680
But Rodney and Lester were back, so there is that.

1821
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:52,540
Supposedly Criterion Games, the same folks that made Burnout, supposedly they were remaking

1822
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:58,980
Skate or Die during the PlayStation 2 and Xbox One era, but the game was canceled.

1823
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:02,920
The good news is though, that's how we got Burnout 3.

1824
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:08,440
So the Skate or Die remake was in development for 12 months, and then they canceled it.

1825
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:13,880
So I'd be curious to see if there's a tell-all about that or something that leaks some of

1826
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:15,960
the footage from that or what have you someday.

1827
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:21,680
So there you go, that's your classic game of the week, Skate or Die.

1828
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:28,160
And when it comes to myself and Skate or Die, I will probably just have to die because I'm

1829
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:29,160
a terrible skater.

1830
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:32,680
What about you, Loki, were you ever a skateboarder?

1831
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:36,560
No, I tried, but nah, it was more skating.

1832
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:39,980
I could only really skate in video games, that's for sure.

1833
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:43,960
Some comments from our chat, Dark Tetsuya says Skate or Die 2 did have the halfpipe

1834
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:49,640
stuff though, let's see, Dark Tetsuya says I think the joust music might be my favorite

1835
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:50,640
theme in this.

1836
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:54,680
Bionic Lester was unbeatable though, well in the little video clip that we pull off

1837
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:59,200
YouTube, somebody was getting him, so there was that.

1838
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:04,360
Sean 322 talking about Rodney Dangerfield kind of being in the game says, maybe the

1839
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:07,440
game got no respect.

1840
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:11,340
Well it sold 100, I think it got a lot of respect, but I appreciate your pun, so there

1841
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:13,540
is that.

1842
01:38:13,540 --> 01:38:18,480
So yeah, some comments there from our chat on Skate or Die, the classic game of the week.

1843
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:23,360
Alright, let's get into some fast news, some rapid fire news, which I think has a story

1844
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,360
in here.

1845
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:29,200
Because I brought up Ultra Games, some of you guys are asking about a certain news topic,

1846
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:31,380
and I think we're going to get into it here shortly.

1847
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:33,960
So Loki, rapid fire news tonight.

1848
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:40,920
Yeah, so there was a game that I grew up with on the Windows, I think it was 3-1 maybe,

1849
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:46,800
but it was an old game called Chips Challenge, and it was a puzzle game that they had in,

1850
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:51,880
I can't remember, it was like the Windows party pack or some sort of pack that had little

1851
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:53,680
games in there.

1852
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:59,360
Chips Challenge has actually now been released for free on Steam, so you can go check it

1853
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:06,560
out for free now and play the wonderful, it looks like it's slightly updated, but the

1854
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:08,760
game from the 90s.

1855
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:12,680
And yeah, it's pretty awesome, so go check it out.

1856
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:17,780
I always crack up at stories about Chips Challenge because I know the guy who made it.

1857
01:39:17,780 --> 01:39:23,560
We play games together, I've been to his house, Chuck, I gotta get him on OLR at some point.

1858
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:25,920
He's under Chuck's Challenge.

1859
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:29,920
I know, yeah, he's talked to me about some of the things, because he knows I do this

1860
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:32,560
show and everything, he's talked to me about some of the stuff his game has been through,

1861
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:36,960
and he doesn't really do, as my understanding anyway, and I'll invite him on the show at

1862
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:41,000
some point so he can speak for himself, obviously COVID is the thing right now, we could get

1863
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:46,440
him virtually, but I'd rather have him here in studio at some point, but he might still

1864
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:50,000
be doing some, I mean like you said, Chuck's Challenge and stuff, he does a lot of stuff

1865
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:56,960
that's really cool with lights, and so he's created stuff for Ingress where, you know

1866
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:00,440
that tunnel in San Jose that changes from green to blue depending on what team owns

1867
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:01,560
it in Ingress?

1868
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:07,680
He had something to do with that, and he made a cool little light-up portal that travels

1869
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:10,280
to different events and stuff, so it's pretty cool.

1870
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:16,920
He's a very talented guy, and one of the legendary game makers from back in the day that many

1871
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:22,120
of today's games were built on, so it's just like, it's my one little like, oh that guy,

1872
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:29,120
I know that guy, so cool, well congrats to him and all the attention this game is getting,

1873
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:34,600
like you said, many people in the Windows 3.1 era grew up on this game and know this

1874
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:36,480
game very well.

1875
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:42,560
Yeah, so pretty cool, and then to go along with that, there's some more games coming

1876
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:49,360
to PC, some classic Metal Gear games are coming to good ol' games, and this is part of the

1877
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:55,120
Konami Collector series, so they're gonna have actually three Metal Gear games, so Metal

1878
01:40:55,120 --> 01:41:02,120
Gear, Metal Gear Solid, and Metal Gear Solid 2 are all gonna be available on PC, so not

1879
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:09,840
bad, and of course, you know, I'd have to check out to see what they've done with those

1880
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:14,840
and see how those ports are, but yeah, pretty cool.

1881
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:20,480
I might have to check it out, like the fact that it's the MSX version of the game, which

1882
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:26,320
they already had done for like a PlayStation, yeah, for a previous collection on PlayStation,

1883
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:31,360
but the fact that that's coming out on PC, that's awesome. Now the Contra port, that

1884
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:34,720
was all on Game Pass, the Contra stuff, and that was all on Game Pass back in the day,

1885
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:38,800
and they're okay, but like the Metal Gear thing is the most exciting out of that bunch

1886
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:39,800
for sure.

1887
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:40,800
Yeah.

1888
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:46,560
Yeah. All right. Moving on and talking about some other quick news here, news out of Tokyo

1889
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:52,360
Game Show with Nier Replicant, which is like a redoing of the first game, which was just

1890
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:58,680
called Nier here in the US, but this is kind of like that extra version that changes the

1891
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:04,240
character to ones that we kind of know more from Nier Automata, but anyway, Nier Replicant

1892
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:10,800
is going to be launching all over the world on April 23rd, 2021. I'm sorry, North America

1893
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:18,360
and Europe is the launch days for that, April 23rd, 2021. PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC

1894
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:25,280
via Steam. The full title of the game is Nier Replicant version 1.22474487139. I don't know

1895
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:30,120
what the full title means, but there you go. It is of course the alternate edition of the

1896
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:34,120
original 2010 Nier. So that's pretty cool. I'll have to check that out because I love

1897
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:39,040
Nier Automata. I need to finish it still. I know there's going to be, I'm going to get

1898
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:42,760
an email. Did you ever finish Nier Automata? Isn't it great? And I'm like, oh, I got distracted

1899
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:48,080
by other games. Sorry. Happens all the time. All right. And then we have news about Mortal

1900
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:53,600
Combat 11. Apparently some data mining has showed that there is alternate voice acting

1901
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:59,400
in the game and get this, it's from the nineties movies actors. Now we all know that Shang

1902
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:04,600
Soon, they already did that, right? But apparently this new dialogue that was data mined out

1903
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:09,120
of the game is Christopher Lambert is in it. That's awesome. Who played Raiden in the movie?

1904
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:15,200
Remember that? Was it actually just like clips from the movie or was it new recordings? And

1905
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:20,840
Linda Ashby, who played Johnny Cage and Bridgette Wilson, who's now Bridgette Wilson Sampras,

1906
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:26,960
who played Sonia is also there. So I don't know if that's going to be DLC or what, but

1907
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:33,800
we can say the YouTube that had all the clips got taken down. So by Warner Brothers. So

1908
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:39,940
where there's smoke, there's Scorpion. So we'll see what comes to that. Honestly, if

1909
01:43:39,940 --> 01:43:45,440
I get to replace Ronda Rousey in Mortal Combat 11, I think that's a great thing. So that's

1910
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:49,960
cool that they got Bridgette Wilson to do that. So, and you know what? Yeah. As cheese

1911
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:56,180
balls, that nineties movie is like, I think it just means a lot to a certain generation,

1912
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:59,700
like a lot of us grew up with that. And so it's really cool to have those actors and actresses

1913
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:04,340
back. Maybe it'd be like the 25th anniversary or something. I was just trying to see when the

1914
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:08,580
movie came out, but this is back in August. So I thought maybe they would do something,

1915
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:12,100
you know, Halloween's right around the corner. Maybe they're going to do something with that.

1916
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:17,500
Maybe they'll find some way to charge us more for it. All right, let's travel around the world and

1917
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:22,900
check out some game releases coming out soon with some world release dates. Loki, what's coming out

1918
01:44:22,900 --> 01:44:30,020
in the US this week? So this week we've got Genshin Impact on PC, PlayStation 4, iOS, and Android.

1919
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:38,500
Hanser Dragoon remake on PlayStation 4. Return one-way trip on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,

1920
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:47,580
and Xbox One. Spelunky 2 is coming on PC this week. Umahara Kawase Bazuka on Nintendo Switch

1921
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:54,940
and PlayStation 4. Warsaw on PlayStation 4. And I think maybe Shantae is also coming out this

1922
01:44:54,940 --> 01:45:01,100
week as well on Nintendo Switch. Super Mario Brothers 35 is coming out this week on the Switch.

1923
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:08,220
We've also got Warsaw on the Switch as well. Crash Bandicoot 4, it's about time,

1924
01:45:08,220 --> 01:45:15,420
on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. And Star Wars Squadrons on the PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1925
01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:20,060
I didn't realize that was that soon. Yeah, I didn't realize it was November. Yeah, I didn't

1926
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:25,020
realize it was that soon either. All right, let's travel to Japan and check out some releases out

1927
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:32,700
there this week. So this week we have a few things. We have, um, sorry I got thrown off

1928
01:45:32,700 --> 01:45:38,620
because there's some releases showing on September 30th, but it's all hardware. So I think the game

1929
01:45:38,620 --> 01:45:43,660
releases, it doesn't look like we actually have any on Nintendo Switch this week. Okay, we do have

1930
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:48,860
some on PlayStation 4. We have Star Wars Squadron is also out in Japan this week and Crash Bandicoot

1931
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:56,300
4 is out in Japan also on October 2nd. And Ys Origin also has a release this week on the

1932
01:45:56,300 --> 01:46:02,380
PlayStation 4 this week. So a fairly quiet week in Japan, although all of those titles are pretty big

1933
01:46:02,380 --> 01:46:07,900
deals. So I guess it's not that quiet. Dark Sakura is not here to cover the UK tonight,

1934
01:46:07,900 --> 01:46:15,260
but possibly Loki can get us those dates in her absence. Yep, so we also have Untitled Goose Game

1935
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:21,100
coming out on PlayStation 4 and Switch. I believe that's the physical version of that. Let's Sing

1936
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:29,660
Queen coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Switch. Human Fall Flat on PlayStation 4, Xbox One

1937
01:46:29,660 --> 01:46:36,780
and Switch. That's the anniversary edition. Crash Bandicoot 4 It's About Time on PlayStation 4 and

1938
01:46:36,780 --> 01:46:44,620
Xbox One. Star Wars Squadrons on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Warborn on PlayStation 4

1939
01:46:44,620 --> 01:46:54,380
and on the Switch. And then we've got also Distrust Collector's Edition on Nintendo Switch.

1940
01:46:55,180 --> 01:47:03,180
And that's it. All right, let's get into some more news then before we get to the listener

1941
01:47:03,180 --> 01:47:11,100
roundtable tonight. So Loki. Yes, so Sega is looking to make Yakuza into a movie.

1942
01:47:11,740 --> 01:47:17,100
So that sounds pretty awesome. Apparently they're working to develop an adaptation with

1943
01:47:18,620 --> 01:47:25,340
1212 Entertainment and Wild Sheep content. And apparently they're also looking for script writers

1944
01:47:25,340 --> 01:47:32,780
as well. So very early into the whole process. But I think that would make a very interesting

1945
01:47:32,780 --> 01:47:39,260
movie. My dumb ass was about to say, has Sega ever gotten into films before and then forgetting,

1946
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:46,540
oh, yeah, like the last major release before all this happened was the Sonic film? No, they haven't

1947
01:47:46,540 --> 01:47:53,500
done anything. Did they ever confirm a sequel for Sonic? They had to have, right? No. Yes, they are,

1948
01:47:53,500 --> 01:48:00,460
yeah. Got it. I haven't even dated it, but I don't remember exactly when it was. But I'm pretty sure

1949
01:48:01,420 --> 01:48:07,500
it was probably like 2022 or something. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, dammit, the Sonic film

1950
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:13,420
reappears on VOG. Look, actually it's this weird dystopian thing right now because there are movie

1951
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:20,060
theaters out there, especially here in California that have been closed since March. So you go and

1952
01:48:20,060 --> 01:48:25,420
you look like what posters are hanging up and it's still like Sonic. Sonic. Because that was the

1953
01:48:25,420 --> 01:48:31,340
movie that was out when all this bullshit started happening. So there are other movies too, but

1954
01:48:31,340 --> 01:48:38,700
it's weird. It's scheduled for April 8th, 2022 right now. But assuming they can, well, I mean,

1955
01:48:38,700 --> 01:48:42,860
I guess movies are shooting again with COVID and all that stuff. They have guidelines. Was it

1956
01:48:42,860 --> 01:48:50,460
Avatar 2 converted to 100% wrapped now? So that's coming out at some point. In these crazy times,

1957
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:53,020
they were able to finish that? Apparently.

1958
01:48:53,020 --> 01:48:54,460
Wow. Let's see.

1959
01:48:54,460 --> 01:48:59,820
Not many years it's going to take to CG animate everything. That's the whole problem.

1960
01:49:00,380 --> 01:49:04,220
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, our theaters reopened here. They're only showing like three

1961
01:49:04,220 --> 01:49:10,940
films. And they're starting to slowly open again here in California, depending on your county.

1962
01:49:10,940 --> 01:49:15,340
Because you mentioned Loki last week. You went and saw Tenet. You had to drive up to El Dorado,

1963
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:19,100
which is in a different county because they have this interesting system that's like a

1964
01:49:19,100 --> 01:49:23,420
four-tier system. So it's like, if you still have high COVID numbers, you're in the purple

1965
01:49:23,420 --> 01:49:28,460
tier and a lot of stuff is still really stupid because it's like, oh yeah, those are like

1966
01:49:28,460 --> 01:49:34,380
borders. No one can possibly go from one county to the other. It's dumb.

1967
01:49:34,380 --> 01:49:39,820
As long as folks are still taking precautions, it's when people just say, oh, COVID's not real

1968
01:49:39,820 --> 01:49:44,860
and don't bother with any precautions at all. That's when like Florida's about to do. Sorry.

1969
01:49:44,860 --> 01:49:49,500
I don't mean to like get political, but it's science isn't political. That's all I'm going

1970
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:56,140
to say. And so, you know, it's kind of scary in that area. What's that where they're just like,

1971
01:49:56,140 --> 01:50:01,420
ah, it's not just everything. Drive-ins. Drive-in theaters are like ever more

1972
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:09,340
popular. Yeah. Was there Rocky Horror? I was just, so I might be saying too much,

1973
01:50:09,340 --> 01:50:13,260
but they were trying to see if we could pull off a live Rocky Horror,

1974
01:50:13,260 --> 01:50:19,580
but they didn't, we didn't have enough notice to do it. And the social distancing makes it very

1975
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:24,860
hard to do Rocky live. So for this, cause they're doing it at the drive-in like next week or no,

1976
01:50:24,860 --> 01:50:28,700
I think it was yesterday. Cause that's how they wanted to turn it around real fast.

1977
01:50:28,700 --> 01:50:33,020
Um, but they are looking into it for October. I hope I'm not saying too much. Um, but they're

1978
01:50:33,020 --> 01:50:37,100
looking into see if they could do the performance in October. I don't know how they would compensate

1979
01:50:37,100 --> 01:50:40,940
for social distancing and all that though. I think they were talking about a system where

1980
01:50:41,740 --> 01:50:47,580
instead of the characters all interacting, like each character would be in a little place on the

1981
01:50:47,580 --> 01:50:51,900
stage and they would kind of do their emotions and acting in that place on the stage. It would

1982
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:57,740
be a little weird, but that's how they could do it safely or I just per guidelines. So,

1983
01:50:59,740 --> 01:51:07,900
um, yep. All right. Anyhow, uh, let's move on and talk about Kirby fighters too.

1984
01:51:08,540 --> 01:51:13,420
Kirby fighters too. Surprise. It just came out and I don't know if Nintendo was kind of forced

1985
01:51:13,420 --> 01:51:17,740
to do it because they kind of spilled it themselves. Uh, it leaked on one of their well

1986
01:51:17,740 --> 01:51:22,860
leaked, but it showed up on one of their websites as like a game basically. And so Nintendo confirmed

1987
01:51:22,860 --> 01:51:28,060
it. So they confirmed in a tweet, a brand new Kirby game is available now. Kirby fighters two

1988
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:35,100
is $20. It's a Kirby versus Kirby versus Kirby game. It's, it's kind of like smash brothers,

1989
01:51:35,660 --> 01:51:40,860
light sorta. I'm really oversimplifying it, but what would you expect a game like Kirby

1990
01:51:40,860 --> 01:51:44,860
fighters to be when Kirby is a character in smash brothers? Um, but that is something you can check

1991
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:49,740
out and there's all sorts of, uh, different Kirby hat fighters and DDD and all that good stuff.

1992
01:51:49,740 --> 01:51:54,220
I have not played the game myself yet. I'd have to ask at depth how it is. Um, but, uh,

1993
01:51:54,220 --> 01:51:59,820
if you're wondering where was Kirby fighters one, it was part of Kirby triple deluxe, which was,

1994
01:52:00,140 --> 01:52:06,540
uh, a 3ds game they put out in 2014. Um, and then I believe they put a standalone version of that

1995
01:52:06,540 --> 01:52:13,820
out on switch. Not that long ago. Um, maybe about a year ago, uh, times feels kind of frozen right

1996
01:52:13,820 --> 01:52:17,500
now, uh, ever since March, but I think it was probably a little over a year ago that

1997
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:24,060
Kirby fighter game was out on the switch. So, um, and active says, no, I haven't gotten it yet.

1998
01:52:24,700 --> 01:52:34,220
Shock. Wow. All right. Anyway, uh, let's move on. All right. Loki. Uh, so

1999
01:52:35,420 --> 01:52:43,900
Nintendo has, uh, sent a DMCA notice against peaches untold tales. Now you may have not

2000
01:52:43,900 --> 01:52:50,940
heard of this game. It is a triple X parody game featuring princess peach and doing I'm, I'm sure

2001
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:57,340
completely wholesome things. Uh, but so they have basically taken it down off of GitHub.

2002
01:52:57,340 --> 01:53:01,580
Of course, it's the internet and being that it's been on the internet for several years already

2003
01:53:01,580 --> 01:53:06,460
before they, I don't even know why they just took it down now, but I'm sure you can find it out

2004
01:53:06,460 --> 01:53:11,580
there. And it's just, it's all the things you would think it would possibly be. It's something

2005
01:53:11,580 --> 01:53:19,980
only the internet could have done. Yes. Yes it is. It's really stupid. It is weird though that

2006
01:53:19,980 --> 01:53:24,460
it existed for so long. And then just now Nintendo is getting around to taking it down.

2007
01:53:24,460 --> 01:53:28,860
Although couldn't you argue that some of it is parody, but I guess the whole thing is parody,

2008
01:53:28,860 --> 01:53:33,020
but they're saying that it's a little too close to home. Maybe they're saying that it's too similar.

2009
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:39,340
It copyrights that fringes on copyrights from a super Mario maker to Mario parts of Mario Galaxy

2010
01:53:39,340 --> 01:53:47,020
and smash brothers. I, I guess like probably because it's saying it's like Mario and princess

2011
01:53:47,020 --> 01:53:51,900
peach and stuff like that. Maybe they're saying that it's that's, what's the problem. If they

2012
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:57,900
were just like, it's mushroom princess and, you know, they just changed the name, Italian plumber.

2013
01:53:58,700 --> 01:54:02,700
Yeah. Kind of like how they do like green Mario green, green Mario.

2014
01:54:05,820 --> 01:54:11,820
So, uh, yeah. All right. It's been taken down. So obviously you can't find it on the internet.

2015
01:54:11,820 --> 01:54:16,300
Yeah. You know what though? It's fine. Unlike a lot of the types of stories we talk about with

2016
01:54:16,300 --> 01:54:21,900
that. I, I have zero interest in this garbage, whatever. I'm just surprised that, yeah, it

2017
01:54:21,900 --> 01:54:26,780
didn't, it didn't get away. Cause like, you know, you have pornos that come out that are like

2018
01:54:26,780 --> 01:54:31,180
parodies of, uh, like the Lord of the cock ring or whatever, you know, that you get like, I don't

2019
01:54:31,180 --> 01:54:36,460
even know if that's a real thing. I assume it is. Uh, you get these parodies of, of TVs and movies

2020
01:54:36,460 --> 01:54:41,020
all the time and porn. So it seems logical that it would happen in video games as well, but yeah,

2021
01:54:41,020 --> 01:54:46,460
probably usually when they do the parodies of porn, they change all the names. Right.

2022
01:54:47,340 --> 01:54:50,940
Um, even when it's real people, uh, like I remember, um,

2023
01:54:52,780 --> 01:54:58,700
there was, um, what was it? Nail and Palin. You remember when, when Sarah Palin was everywhere,

2024
01:54:58,700 --> 01:55:03,580
she was the VP nominee. And of course, you know, they, but they like would change the name.

2025
01:55:04,460 --> 01:55:10,780
So it was like, you know, Susie or something. One of the stars actually looked very similar

2026
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:16,700
to her. So they made a ton of movies. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, my, then they usually change,

2027
01:55:16,700 --> 01:55:22,380
but this parody, yeah. Like you said, they should have changed, uh, Mario and peach to different,

2028
01:55:22,380 --> 01:55:27,660
you know, things, which considering there's a peach emoji that represents. All right. You know

2029
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:32,780
what? Nevermind. We're not going to continue this conversation. All right. Moving on. Let's,

2030
01:55:32,780 --> 01:55:38,780
let's instead talk about something that I'm actually, I'm fucking sick of talking about

2031
01:55:38,780 --> 01:55:45,260
this and I didn't really want to bring this up again tonight. I'm going to like one more time,

2032
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:50,140
but I'm not talking about this again. Of course, somebody is going to quote me on this. It's the

2033
01:55:50,140 --> 01:55:53,900
same. That's going to come back to haunt me. I'm not talking about this again until we fucking get

2034
01:55:53,900 --> 01:56:01,340
a confirmation on this. And it's the mass effect trilogy again, because another retailer has leaked

2035
01:56:01,340 --> 01:56:07,740
it again. And this is a Czechoslovakian retailer. Herne Savitt. I'm probably saying that completely

2036
01:56:07,740 --> 01:56:16,700
wrong. Sorry. Um, I bet it's more like that. Anyway. Uh, it is a, uh, October 15th release

2037
01:56:16,700 --> 01:56:21,660
on their systems, which that is way too soon. I don't, unless it's a digital only thing,

2038
01:56:21,660 --> 01:56:25,500
but then why would a retailer be taking orders for it? So it doesn't, it doesn't make any sense.

2039
01:56:26,220 --> 01:56:32,620
Um, but they have cover art. Now GameStop makes up their own cover art sometimes, but it does,

2040
01:56:32,620 --> 01:56:37,500
I mean, this is what the cover art I would expect could look like. It's just a picture of

2041
01:56:38,620 --> 01:56:42,700
male shepherd. Uh, unfortunately for those that believe fem chef, maybe on the backside is fem

2042
01:56:42,700 --> 01:56:46,300
chef. That would be the way to do it. Have a one shepherd on one side and one on the other. It's

2043
01:56:46,300 --> 01:56:50,860
like when you or, uh, you could take the cover and flip it. That would be a great way to do it too.

2044
01:56:50,860 --> 01:56:56,060
I think mass effect three really was like that. Um, but anyway, it does have cover art and, uh,

2045
01:56:56,060 --> 01:57:01,580
it's happening now. There's this story and there was another one and I forget what blog ran it.

2046
01:57:01,580 --> 01:57:06,220
I'm sorry, but it spilled a lot more details and it was basically like,

2047
01:57:06,220 --> 01:57:10,780
yes, it's happening. And the reason why it's held up, they took the multiplayer out for mass

2048
01:57:10,780 --> 01:57:13,980
effect three. They're not looking at which. So I was a little disappointed to hear that,

2049
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:19,340
but I get it, but they are trying to quote unquote fix mass effect one and the mass effect

2050
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:24,700
one development is the holdup. And they're not saying what they are fixing in that, but I could

2051
01:57:24,700 --> 01:57:29,260
theorize as somebody who really enjoys that game, the graphics are a bit dated compared to the other

2052
01:57:29,260 --> 01:57:33,660
two games. They probably have to catch that up. And those Mako driving sequences were horrific.

2053
01:57:33,660 --> 01:57:38,300
So they're probably either changing that system completely or making that a little more bearable.

2054
01:57:38,300 --> 01:57:41,820
Um, so those are some things they kind of need to fix in mass effect one

2055
01:57:41,820 --> 01:57:45,180
to because, you know, people are going to want to play these games in order. If they pick up

2056
01:57:45,180 --> 01:57:49,980
this collection and they're not going to get to two and three, if one, some will argue with me,

2057
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:54,140
I tweeted about this and I even got responses that were like, well, Rob wants the best game.

2058
01:57:54,140 --> 01:57:58,780
And it's like, okay, look, but the game elements, I don't think are with, I don't think they're

2059
01:57:58,780 --> 01:58:04,220
going to change combat. They might though, I guess we'll see, but I really don't think

2060
01:58:04,220 --> 01:58:07,900
the types of changes they're making are going to ruin, you know, whatever you feel

2061
01:58:07,900 --> 01:58:14,700
like about mass effect one. So anyway, there you go. That was the other big piece is that,

2062
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:19,100
you know, that we get news from the inside or whatever. However, the news is leaking because

2063
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:26,220
it just constantly leaks because EA won't confirm it for whatever fucking reason. But anyway,

2064
01:58:26,620 --> 01:58:33,180
the news that multiplayer is out and a mass effect one redo of sorts is in, which is what

2065
01:58:33,180 --> 01:58:39,900
a lot of people were probably theorizing anyway. At this point, I would guess that it's going to

2066
01:58:39,900 --> 01:58:45,580
end up being a November 7th thing, but I, for one, am not going to talk about this shit anymore

2067
01:58:46,140 --> 01:58:52,300
until they confirm it. I'm done. If Jamie brings it up, that's on her. She's not here. So maybe

2068
01:58:52,300 --> 01:58:59,020
she's still got one more inner, but I'm not bringing this up anymore. All right. Anyway,

2069
01:59:00,060 --> 01:59:02,620
that's it. You want to talk about the mass effect trilogy?

2070
01:59:04,140 --> 01:59:08,460
I have played like a little bit of one and that's it. So.

2071
01:59:09,340 --> 01:59:12,380
Well, what, what was it you didn't, why didn't you play more of one?

2072
01:59:13,100 --> 01:59:18,860
I don't know. I just didn't like it because my, my coworker loaned it to me and I was like,

2073
01:59:18,860 --> 01:59:23,100
oh yeah, I'll totally check it out. Cause it sounded really cool. I just, I didn't like it.

2074
01:59:23,100 --> 01:59:27,420
I don't know. I didn't quite get into it. Well, and maybe some of these changes will be a good

2075
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:30,220
thing for you. And I'm going to open up the listener round table. If you guys have some

2076
01:59:30,220 --> 01:59:33,420
questions in chat or something you want to talk about, go ahead and ask away in chat.

2077
01:59:34,700 --> 01:59:42,060
Phoenix 7726. Sorry guys. Phoenix 7726 in chat says two had the best story. Three had the best

2078
01:59:42,060 --> 01:59:47,580
combat. One was still solid. In my opinion, I'm not saying one is a bad game by any means. It's

2079
01:59:47,580 --> 01:59:53,260
just one is not at the same level, like graphically and engine wise that two and three were at.

2080
01:59:53,260 --> 01:59:57,980
And so I do think there is a disconnect, but I, I, if there's one thing they're not going to change

2081
01:59:57,980 --> 02:00:04,380
in one, it's the story. They're not going to change the story. Well, let me, I'm gonna take

2082
02:00:04,380 --> 02:00:11,820
those words back because I really loved the idea that maybe they would put back in some of the

2083
02:00:11,820 --> 02:00:17,020
romance options they cut the first time. Like maybe they would allow Kayden to be romanceable

2084
02:00:17,020 --> 02:00:22,780
by M Shep in the first game. And maybe, and why, why stop there? Why not maybe have some other

2085
02:00:22,780 --> 02:00:27,740
romances that show up later on end up in the first game? I don't know what else they might have cut

2086
02:00:27,740 --> 02:00:33,420
or things like that, but it would be kind of cool to see that stuff restored. But I am talking about

2087
02:00:33,420 --> 02:00:38,140
additional content. I'm not talking about taking anything away or something that would fundamentally

2088
02:00:38,140 --> 02:00:43,660
change the core of that story. So, but you know, whatever changes they make, they're not going to

2089
02:00:43,660 --> 02:00:49,740
change the story of one. And I think that's very important. All right. We will get into last minute

2090
02:00:49,740 --> 02:00:53,900
stories in a moment, but I have at least one round table question here coming from no one special.

2091
02:00:54,700 --> 02:01:00,380
Who says, okay, granted, as far as I know, I'm the only one here that is a heavy GOG user,

2092
02:01:00,380 --> 02:01:05,740
but hypothetically, if you all were as well, and given that Konami is now listing games on GOG

2093
02:01:05,740 --> 02:01:10,060
and Sega's Panzer Dragoon is there too, is there any publishers or games that you would

2094
02:01:10,060 --> 02:01:19,500
like to see on the service? Yes. And actually I, one reason I'm not a heavier user of GOG is that

2095
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:24,940
it feels like lately they're just kind of playing a lot of catch up to what, you know, Steam and

2096
02:01:24,940 --> 02:01:33,260
everybody else in the space is doing. What made GOG interesting was GOG. And they got away from

2097
02:01:33,260 --> 02:01:37,900
that at some point, which I, and I get it, you know, and I'm sure somebody is about to clap

2098
02:01:37,900 --> 02:01:42,380
back and chat that, well, once they kind of exhausted all of the retro things, they could

2099
02:01:42,380 --> 02:01:47,020
get their hands on. And so the only way they could stay competitive was to be more like Steam. Well,

2100
02:01:47,020 --> 02:01:52,220
my response to that is okay, but this is the first time that GOG has done something that's really

2101
02:01:52,220 --> 02:01:57,500
made me turn my head in quite some time is that story we just talked about earlier tonight,

2102
02:01:57,500 --> 02:02:03,820
that now Konami is putting out the MSX version of Metal Gear, the superior version of Metal Gear

2103
02:02:03,820 --> 02:02:09,420
that most people here in the US never played because the NES version, although it's not bad,

2104
02:02:10,220 --> 02:02:15,980
especially when it's all you ever knew, it is subpar compared to the MSX version. So the fact

2105
02:02:15,980 --> 02:02:22,060
that GOG has dug that up, I mean, yes, it was from the Metal Gear Solid 3 PlayStation thing, whatever

2106
02:02:22,060 --> 02:02:25,580
they did out there, but the fact that they've brought that to PC and brought that to the

2107
02:02:25,580 --> 02:02:30,860
forefront, here's a way to get it now today without having to find a game that was on sale

2108
02:02:30,860 --> 02:02:36,220
10 years ago and all that stuff, that is very interesting and something I will probably return

2109
02:02:36,220 --> 02:02:42,300
to GOG to look at. So that's my answer, my very long-winded answer to your question, Owen Special,

2110
02:02:42,300 --> 02:02:51,260
is that what makes GOG interesting is GOG. It's in the name and there are plenty of older games

2111
02:02:51,260 --> 02:02:56,940
they could still go back and try to get on their service. And it's nice to see that with this

2112
02:02:56,940 --> 02:03:01,500
Konami thing, they haven't necessarily stopped that. Now, I don't know who initiated that

2113
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:07,740
conversation. Was it Konami? Was it GOG? I don't know, but this is a good direction. More, please.

2114
02:03:08,940 --> 02:03:11,660
So that's my answer to that. What about you, Loki?

2115
02:03:12,380 --> 02:03:15,820
I didn't use them much other than some of the free games that I've gotten from them.

2116
02:03:16,700 --> 02:03:20,940
I know that they have that cool launcher that came out a while back that's supposed to bring your

2117
02:03:20,940 --> 02:03:28,620
Epic Game Store and Steam library all together. But I don't know, it's just fine just loading each

2118
02:03:28,620 --> 02:03:35,020
of those up separately. So I don't really need it. But yeah, I don't know. There's not really

2119
02:03:35,020 --> 02:03:42,140
anything drawing to them more than the other platforms. Maybe they have humble

2120
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:45,420
bottles or something with their keys in there or something. I don't know.

2121
02:03:46,380 --> 02:03:51,820
No One Special follows up and says, for me, what draws me to that site is that the games are DRM

2122
02:03:51,820 --> 02:03:56,780
free. I have the peace of mind that if GOG goes away, if I downloaded the installers, I won't lose

2123
02:03:56,780 --> 02:04:01,500
my game. There's no guarantee that Valve would hit the turn off the DRM button if they go out of

2124
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:08,060
business. I think it's in the terms that you accept, actually. I think legally Valve has to hit that

2125
02:04:08,060 --> 02:04:13,020
button. But let's say, I'm going to humor your argument here, let's say that button doesn't get

2126
02:04:13,020 --> 02:04:18,940
hit for whatever reason. Publishers could still find a way to turn it off for you.

2127
02:04:18,940 --> 02:04:23,260
Not that everybody would do it, but a bunch would. But I get it. I'm not trying to like

2128
02:04:24,220 --> 02:04:28,700
debate your point, really, because you like what you like. And that's,

2129
02:04:29,260 --> 02:04:34,140
go, go, go ahead. Like it's good. The competition in the space is a good thing. And if that's where

2130
02:04:34,140 --> 02:04:39,580
you like to shop, excellent. Like I like to shop at Target. I really don't like going to Walmart.

2131
02:04:39,580 --> 02:04:45,340
There's people that feel the exact opposite that I do. Choice is cool. And it's fine. There's not

2132
02:04:45,340 --> 02:04:49,740
necessarily a right or a wrong answer. It kind of just depends on how you were treated or whatever

2133
02:04:49,740 --> 02:04:55,420
at one place versus another. But yeah, GOG will continue to grab my attention when they release

2134
02:04:55,420 --> 02:05:02,540
really cool older games. Like that Myst VR thing. Did that ever come up on the show? I don't remember

2135
02:05:02,540 --> 02:05:05,820
if we talked about that last week or the week before. Yeah, I think we brought it up last week

2136
02:05:05,820 --> 02:05:11,340
that it was coming out. It's kind of a neat little thing. Now, what about Uru Myst Online?

2137
02:05:11,340 --> 02:05:18,700
Did that ever come back somewhere? Did they ever get that running again? I don't know. But was it

2138
02:05:18,700 --> 02:05:25,180
Minecraft VR came out this week as well. Oh yeah. I need to hook up my headset and get that going

2139
02:05:25,180 --> 02:05:32,220
again. Yeah, so that was cool. Yeah. ActDeft in chat with another Roundtable question here

2140
02:05:32,220 --> 02:05:39,260
who asks, with more games adopting cross-play, which game that right now doesn't have it,

2141
02:05:39,260 --> 02:05:46,140
would you like to see adopted? Oh, I don't think there's a lot of games I play a ton of.

2142
02:05:49,180 --> 02:05:56,860
I'm stuck because the games I play the most right now, this week, Final Fantasy and No Man's Sky,

2143
02:05:56,860 --> 02:06:03,100
both already have it. I'm trying to think of something that would be really cool.

2144
02:06:05,980 --> 02:06:08,940
I don't know, Loki. I'm stumped. Is there something for you? What about you guys?

2145
02:06:09,740 --> 02:06:12,220
I don't play a lot of multiplayer games, so I can't really think of anything.

2146
02:06:13,260 --> 02:06:19,580
Bobby has a good answer. Fall Guys. I forget that that doesn't have it. That's a very good answer.

2147
02:06:19,580 --> 02:06:25,660
I'm going to copy and steal that answer. Fall Guys is a good one for that. I keep forgetting

2148
02:06:25,660 --> 02:06:31,260
it doesn't have that. I'm also waiting for Fall Guys on the Switch. It seems like the definitive

2149
02:06:31,260 --> 02:06:37,020
thing Nintendo needs to have on that system. Well, that was part of that leak, or leaked,

2150
02:06:37,020 --> 02:06:44,620
if you will, directing this. A bunch of fan wank, but yeah, I don't know. My uncle said,

2151
02:06:45,580 --> 02:06:52,540
Overwatch is a good one too. Oh, Diablo III on the Blizzard front. I'd love to see Diablo III.

2152
02:06:52,540 --> 02:06:59,740
I hope Diablo IV is cross-play. Diablo III is sunsetting at this point as Diablo IV is getting

2153
02:06:59,740 --> 02:07:08,060
more and more. You had me there, no one special 77 with the SNL fighters until it was a typo.

2154
02:07:08,060 --> 02:07:14,940
That would be an interesting fighting game. The fighting games. I thought some of the fighting

2155
02:07:14,940 --> 02:07:20,380
games were cross-play. I guess not Street Fighter though. I thought Mortal Kombat did have some

2156
02:07:20,380 --> 02:07:24,220
cross-play in it. I guess I could be wrong. Orange Riot with a very good comment here.

2157
02:07:24,220 --> 02:07:29,660
If a leak gives you everything you wanted, it's probably fake. That's very, very good advice.

2158
02:07:29,660 --> 02:07:33,660
And that was probably the thing I read in there where it was like, Fall Guys today on the Switch,

2159
02:07:33,660 --> 02:07:39,740
where I was like, nah, it's fake. Come on. Okay, active says Street Fighter is cross-play between

2160
02:07:39,740 --> 02:07:48,220
PC and PS4. And it's, I think, still free for a few more days on PlayStation Plus. I did check

2161
02:07:48,220 --> 02:07:51,100
that out. I downloaded it. I don't think I brought it up during my gaming week because

2162
02:07:51,100 --> 02:07:55,100
I didn't play it a lot. And this is more last week than this week, but that is something that

2163
02:07:55,100 --> 02:07:59,500
you can get on PlayStation Plus right now. All right, how about some last minute stories,

2164
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:03,500
Loki? Let's see if we get any other last questions in chat. But for now, some last minute stories.

2165
02:08:04,860 --> 02:08:07,900
So we're going to probably have a little bit more about this next week, but Minecraft Live

2166
02:08:07,900 --> 02:08:16,460
is on Saturday and they're doing their vote for the new mob for the game. So I'm a little

2167
02:08:16,540 --> 02:08:22,380
disappointed at what they've shown off so far. So two of the mobs that they're putting up for

2168
02:08:22,380 --> 02:08:28,060
vote are already mobs there in Minecraft Earth, which, and they're kind of lame anyways. So the

2169
02:08:28,060 --> 02:08:33,020
Moobloom, which is basically a cross between, it's like a mushroom, but with flowers instead

2170
02:08:33,020 --> 02:08:39,340
of mushrooms. And then they have a Glow Squid, which is a squid, but it glows. And then the

2171
02:08:40,060 --> 02:08:46,620
Ice Oliger, which is a new villager type mob, but they just added a bunch of those in like

2172
02:08:46,620 --> 02:08:53,660
that village and pillage one. It's not as cool as like the Phantoms. I don't know if the Phantom

2173
02:08:53,660 --> 02:08:58,460
was really cool, but like I was hoping they'd be better stuff. They should just add all of them.

2174
02:08:58,460 --> 02:09:05,900
Like seriously, I had a mod in my realm already that added the Moobloom and the Glow Squid. I

2175
02:09:05,900 --> 02:09:09,980
don't know. It's not that hard to implement that stuff. I don't know why they don't just do all

2176
02:09:09,980 --> 02:09:17,740
three, but whatever. Maybe something to add content for some time. People excited about

2177
02:09:17,740 --> 02:09:23,020
stuff. So it's, but they're going to do, it's basically in place of the whole Minecon thing

2178
02:09:23,020 --> 02:09:28,940
since obviously COVID. But so you're going to do the Minecraft live, which I believe is on,

2179
02:09:28,940 --> 02:09:36,060
I know it's Saturday at 9 AM Pacific and whatever that translates to for everybody else.

2180
02:09:37,340 --> 02:09:41,020
So I will watch all that and it's going to have like details about Minecraft Earth,

2181
02:09:41,020 --> 02:09:45,340
their Minecraft Dungeons, which I still haven't played even though I have it.

2182
02:09:46,140 --> 02:09:49,260
And then of course Minecraft proper. So we'll see.

2183
02:09:50,140 --> 02:09:52,380
All right. Anything else for last minute stories?

2184
02:09:55,100 --> 02:09:56,620
No, I think that's it.

2185
02:09:56,620 --> 02:10:00,300
All right. And I don't think I see any other questions in our chat. So I think we'll go

2186
02:10:00,300 --> 02:10:04,460
ahead and wrap up for tonight. I know it's a little bit earlier, but we're down a host

2187
02:10:04,460 --> 02:10:09,500
tonight and yeah. So it's just a little bit of a shorter show sometimes. Actually, no,

2188
02:10:09,500 --> 02:10:13,260
you're still over two hours, about two hours, 15 minutes. So still pretty good, pretty good

2189
02:10:13,260 --> 02:10:17,500
chunk of show. Because there was some busy, busy things this week with the whole Microsoft

2190
02:10:17,500 --> 02:10:22,620
big purchase there of ZeniMax as well as the Tokyo Game Show. Although I don't think Tokyo Game Show

2191
02:10:22,620 --> 02:10:29,340
was quite as news heavy as it was in previous years. And I think a lot of that is because

2192
02:10:29,340 --> 02:10:33,500
Sony just did that thing two weeks ago where they kind of put all their cards on the table.

2193
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:38,380
I don't think Sony did Tokyo Game Show this year. Nintendo never does Tokyo Game Show,

2194
02:10:38,380 --> 02:10:43,980
but I feel like a lot of the big announcements were in Sony's PS5 event because that's not

2195
02:10:43,980 --> 02:10:47,980
usually the type of thing that would have been this close to Tokyo Game Show. That is the stuff

2196
02:10:47,980 --> 02:10:52,540
we should have got during E3 using my Cody fingers. But of course, COVID fucked everything

2197
02:10:52,540 --> 02:10:57,420
up. So it screwed up timeline. So I think it just made the Tokyo Game Show feel a little lighter

2198
02:10:57,420 --> 02:11:01,900
this year than it usually is. And just the whole situation of it being virtual and everything.

2199
02:11:03,820 --> 02:11:08,140
Yeah. So it was basically, I'm just kind of looking at a lot of it is stuff that was covered

2200
02:11:08,140 --> 02:11:11,900
in the directs that we've seen from Nintendo and like some of the other things. So they had,

2201
02:11:13,340 --> 02:11:17,260
it was pretty much just like a few of the Japanese games that were mentioned in the

2202
02:11:17,260 --> 02:11:23,100
directs. So like the new Hyrule Warriors game, they've got the new Monster Hunter,

2203
02:11:24,140 --> 02:11:27,740
new Replicant. They talked about that a little bit. Dynasty Warriors, Nine Empires,

2204
02:11:28,540 --> 02:11:33,180
Battle in Wonderland, Cyberpunk. They have that new video that wasn't quite related to

2205
02:11:33,180 --> 02:11:37,180
Tokyo Game Show, but that was also there. Resident Evil Village,

2206
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:46,780
just The Devil May Cry 5, Biohazard, Infinite Darkness, which is a new series coming to Netflix.

2207
02:11:48,140 --> 02:11:52,780
Yeah. That's cool. Yeah. It's just a lot of follow-ups on things we already knew about,

2208
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:55,900
which is still cool. And especially, you know, if you're following those games, but it was just

2209
02:11:55,900 --> 02:12:01,420
wasn't like a lot of like new, new information. So, but that's okay. You know, again, it's been

2210
02:12:01,420 --> 02:12:07,660
a weird news cycle this year. Everything's been weird this year. So, all right. Well, that is

2211
02:12:07,660 --> 02:12:10,940
about going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. I want to thank you guys for

2212
02:12:10,940 --> 02:12:15,180
spending time with us this week, whether you're here with us live on Sunday night, as we tape

2213
02:12:15,180 --> 02:12:20,620
here at VOG Network, or if you were listening on the podcast feed, we really appreciate it.

2214
02:12:20,620 --> 02:12:24,860
A nice five-star review of this show on iTunes or wherever it is that you found this show goes

2215
02:12:24,860 --> 02:12:28,780
an awful long way. If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or

2216
02:12:28,780 --> 02:12:32,380
two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has

2217
02:12:32,380 --> 02:12:36,540
a voice. But if the voices aren't here to put out on the air, then, you know, we're not really

2218
02:12:36,540 --> 02:12:42,540
getting all the voices. So, yeah. Help us tell a friend. Tweet about the show is a great thing.

2219
02:12:42,620 --> 02:12:47,820
Auto-hosting on Twitch is awesome. Even if you don't do a lot of streaming yourself,

2220
02:12:47,820 --> 02:12:53,660
still throwing a VOG Network. That auto-host does a lot for exposure. We really, really appreciate

2221
02:12:53,660 --> 02:12:58,060
people that go the extra mile and do that. I also wanted to say, if you want to continue

2222
02:12:58,060 --> 02:13:01,820
the conversation during the week, a lot of the chatter in Discord has been picking up lately,

2223
02:13:01,820 --> 02:13:06,140
and that's great. So, you can join us on Discord, vognetwork.com. That's vognetwork.com

2224
02:13:06,780 --> 02:13:12,780
Discord, where you can follow some conversations for ourselves here at Orange Lounge Radio,

2225
02:13:13,500 --> 02:13:19,900
Bobby Blackwolf, Anime Jam Session, other great shows on VOG as well. British Invaders,

2226
02:13:19,900 --> 02:13:23,420
I know, put out a couple big episodes recently about some big 50th anniversaries that are

2227
02:13:23,420 --> 02:13:29,180
happening. And yeah, lots of great stuff. So, check that out. And then, of course,

2228
02:13:29,180 --> 02:13:33,100
the VOG Roundtables and all that info is there as well. And folks, chat about some of the…

2229
02:13:33,100 --> 02:13:37,420
We get a lot of headlines posted in Discord during the week that sometimes we do take

2230
02:13:37,420 --> 02:13:41,340
those and use them on the show and talk about those conversations. So, thanks to all you that

2231
02:13:41,340 --> 02:13:47,100
are participating over there. That's going to do it. I hope you guys have a great week, some happy

2232
02:13:47,100 --> 02:13:51,260
gaming. I know I'm probably going to play way too much more No Man's Sky and Hades and all

2233
02:13:51,260 --> 02:13:56,460
that stuff, but I'll try to fit in some new games too. Loki, hopefully you have a productive week

2234
02:13:56,460 --> 02:13:59,980
working on your game or playing some U.S., whatever you choose to do.

2235
02:13:59,980 --> 02:14:06,780
I'm still waiting. My music guy is having time management issues.

2236
02:14:08,060 --> 02:14:09,420
All right, that's fine.

2237
02:14:09,420 --> 02:14:18,300
So, thankfully, I have a backup music guy that's doing it for free. So, I'll have more music from

2238
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:24,940
them. But like, yeah, I've already given him crap about that because he's like seven days past due.

2239
02:14:25,580 --> 02:14:31,980
Oh, all right. All right. Well, thanks again, everybody. We'll see you in seven days to do

2240
02:14:31,980 --> 02:14:37,020
this show all over again. Have a great week, everybody. We'll see you next time on Orange

2241
02:14:37,020 --> 02:14:41,660
Lounge Radio. Dark Sakura will be back next week and we'll get caught up with her and it will be

2242
02:14:41,660 --> 02:14:46,380
October. It'll be spooky season officially. Have a great week, everybody. We'll see you next time.

2243
02:14:46,380 --> 02:14:46,780
Good night.
