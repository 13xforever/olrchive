0	28000	Link cables, IR blasts, and finally good ol' Wi-Fi, I consider the Nintendo 3DS to be the most social portable we've ever seen almost exclusively due to the existence of SpotPass and StreetPass. Conventions quickly went from a wireless clusterfuck of data exchange to a wireless wasteland devoid of 3D life. I truly do miss it. 3DS, we hardly knew ye.
28000	37000	Stay tuned for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki, their thoughts on the sunsetting Nintendo handhelds, and plenty more gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	60000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio back again live tonight with episode number 836 of our show for this September 20th of 2020.
60000	79000	That's a lot of 20s. My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined via Discord as much as we love to tape all in the same room. 2020 has made that not possible but thanks to technology I'm able to connect with my co-hosts at a social distance. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
79000	89000	I'm throwing up the horns. Yeah, I love your look tonight. Now I know the podcastees can't see it but the folks on Twitch can kind of see you're rocking kind of a little bit of a gothic look tonight.
89000	100000	A little bit for old school goth. A little bit of Halloween Daria tonight. Halloween my ass, I just wear this anyway. Halloween is every day when you're a cosplayer.
101000	111000	Well, this isn't... I just, you know, this is kind of how I feel right now. I feel like I'm in a really dark place so why shouldn't my outside show how I'm feeling inside?
111000	117000	Yeah, it's been a decade this weekend, hasn't it? Oh boy. Anyway.
117000	128000	Well, and I mean, there's the other news that I shared. I mean, we all know that Ruth Bader Ginsburg died and there's a big hole in our democracy that she's left.
128000	140000	I've unfriended a few people, by the way, who have, you know, just shat on her memory. But we also lost Nobiko, the long cat.
140000	145000	Right. You messaged me that before the show. That's sad. 18 years old.
145000	155000	You know, some of those internet meme cats are kind of passed away some time ago, like Keyboard Cat is the one that comes to mind, right? Because that was an old clip from the 80s.
155000	166000	Yeah. But there had been a big like series of posts that, you know, yeah, the cat's still alive. His name is Nobiko and he lives in Japan and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
166000	173000	And then his owner said, no, Nobiko passed away of respiratory failure.
173000	179000	That's tragic. 18 is a good run. Shirmi made it to 16. Cats should live longer than people.
179000	192000	I don't think longer. I think that they should have just a human lifespan. Yes. Agree. All right. Well, introducing our other co-host who's living a nice, full life and will continue to for some time, I'm sure. Say hello to Loki.
192000	196000	Not if I keep eating all this ramen.
196000	208000	If we have to keep eating the way we have been in quarantine, who knows? I was trying to shove it down before the show started. So you're going to be well preserved because of all the preservatives.
208000	212000	That's it. You're mummifying yourself. What is the game running behind you tonight?
213000	224000	It's one of the games that should have been included on one of these All-Stars. It's WarioWare Shake It, one of the best platform games that nobody remembers anymore.
224000	236000	It was a hand-drawn, animated platformer game by Nintendo. And I really wish they would do a traditional Mario game in that style, but they didn't. They left it to Wario instead.
236000	247000	Yeah, I'm with you. I would have been more jazzed about like another Super Mario 2D collection than maybe the 3D All-Stars. I mean, I get that a lot of people are really enjoying 3D All-Stars.
247000	261000	I personally did not pick it up. I've gone into the reasons before and I'm not here to like shit on Nintendo fans. It's not my thing. I just, if I want to go play Mario 3D, I have my 3DS, which is a great system.
261000	273000	And even if Nintendo is going to discontinue them, spoiler alert, they can't come into my house and take my 3DS away with my copy of Mario 64 on it. So there is that and the other things I've talked about on previous episodes.
273000	281000	Well, I just wish that they would have done more with this collection than they did because it literally is just, it's all emulated.
282000	295000	And even like the one that has kind of the most done to it, which is Mario Galaxy, is really just the version that was out in, was it China, on the Nvidia Shield because remember they had it over there.
295000	306000	Since technically a Switch is sort of an Nvidia Shield, you know, hardware wise, that's what they ported over. I mean, that's exactly the same thing. It's same kind of resolution they were doing and stuff.
306000	315000	But like, just even on PC with the folks, you know, decompiling the original Mario 64, and I know we'll have more stories kind of tied with that later.
315000	326000	There's been so much more that they've done with it than just this. Like just, oh, look, we re-released an emulator. Enjoy. It's like, okay.
326000	340000	I would have been, I would have been like so jazzed about the 3D collection if they tried to do something. You're right, like the things that people have done with Mario 64, like when they turned it into all that, like the massively multiplayer Mario 64.
340000	350000	I'm not saying Nintendo has to like copy it, but it does kind of show that like you can kind of go back and reinvent old games. And that's maybe why I loved the first All-Stars collection on Super Nintendo so, so much.
350000	357000	It really truly is one of the greatest releases ever because it didn't just port the games, it reimagined them. And that's what made it so amazing.
357000	373000	Exactly. Yeah, exactly. It wasn't just a re-release. It was a remaster of those games. And these are, it literally is the old games running in an emulator and then they're hacking stuff in there with some slightly better textures for like the HUD and stuff.
373000	390000	And some more anti-aliasing or actually in some cases, removing the anti-aliasing in the case of Mario 64. It's just, it's very minimal. It's hardly worthy of an All-Stars collection, especially without Mario Galaxy 2. That's just silly.
390000	401000	Yeah. And I get, I'm really not here to kick it when it's down. And if those of you, I know many of you out there, especially if I'm watching my Twitter and social media feed are playing 3D All-Stars and enjoying it and that's cool.
401000	416000	And you know, also I think my age might be showing a little bit because I think there's lots of gamers out there who might be like in their early 20s or mid 20s who didn't really get to play Sunshine or didn't really get to play Mario 64 either when those games were new or ever.
416000	422000	So the fact that people are experiencing those games for the first time, I think that's awesome. So that's cool.
422000	442000	Yeah. I never played Sunshine and Galaxy. I played like up through the first few levels and that was it. Mario 64, I played pretty much all the way through, but the other two, like I haven't touched. So it is kind of nice to do that. And my kids are having fun with it. I haven't gotten a chance to play it yet, but they have. So you're enjoying them.
443000	461000	All right. Well, yeah. And those 3D games, I think they just keep getting better and better. And honestly, like if you don't already own Mario Odyssey, in my opinion, get that before you play. Because I honestly think Odyssey is the best 3D Mario's ever been. It's a hell of a lot of fun.
462000	478000	But I am probably going to pick up, even though the price tag is a little high, I will probably end up picking up the 3D, I can't even remember the exact way they titled it, Super Mario 3D Land. But it kind of plays like a 2D Mario, but it had the 3D stuff.
478000	479000	Yeah, it's 3D World.
479000	480000	3D World.
480000	482000	It's 3D World plus...
482000	489000	I'll probably still get that. I thought that was such a solid platformer. I really enjoyed that. I wouldn't mind revisiting that, even if the price tag is a little high.
489000	501000	So, all right. Anyway, lots. We have so much news to get into tonight. We really need to stop. We'll talk about other stuff during our gaming weeks, but we got a lot to get into tonight. So let's start with the biggest news.
502000	516000	We had a Sony event. Sony came out, they did an event, and they finally showed us. This is the price, this is the date, and this is some of the games that we're going to be putting on the PlayStation, some you've seen before, some you haven't.
516000	520000	Loki, why don't you break this down for us a little bit, although prepare to be interrupted a lot.
520000	542000	Okay, so they have a lot of trailers before the final announcement of the actual price. So kicking things off, I mean Final Fantasy XVI. That's definitely how you start one of these press events, or not even press events, one of these directs is like kick it off with a brand new Final Fantasy trailer. So it looked pretty cool.
542000	548000	Do you think that they moved that to the front because of the leaks that had proceeded for a couple days?
548000	565000	I think they moved it to the front because of the way that they were describing their footage. So that one in particular is a PC running, it was a game running on PC meant to look like a PlayStation 5, whereas the rest were running off of PlayStation 5 hardware.
565000	582000	So they prefaced that trailer differently than the rest of them. So I think that's why they did it. But yeah, I mean, it looks nice. It is considered a console exclusive, but it is still coming out on PC as well. So we'll see what that necessarily means. There's some other...
582000	600000	They're being a little wishy washy on the PC thing right now. I don't know if I would stay. They kind of said that, but then the trailers kind of contradict each other. So we know PlayStation 5 for sure. I think it's like PC eventually. I mean, Square has been doing that with a lot of their games, but it may not be right away.
600000	614000	But there's other titles though that also were coming. They were called console exclusives as well. But then they're also coming to PC and other consoles like three months later is the other thing too.
614000	633000	Personally, I am not a fan of paid console exclusives. I didn't like it when PlayStation did it. I didn't like it when Xbox did it. I'm not a fan of that kind of thing. I think it's just ridiculous to do that.
633000	644000	Can we talk about the trailer though? Because it was so sexy. I am dying. It was really, really good. Jamie, did you see the trailer? I'm so curious what your thoughts were on 16.
644000	649000	It looks like 14? Kind of?
649000	653000	Kind of, yes. In my opinion, that's a great thing.
653000	661000	You know me, I'm just still trying to reserve judgment. I'm trying not to be excited. Does that make sense?
661000	680000	Yeah, no, I get it. But it is so hard for me not to buy in the hype because, and it took me a minute because I saw that logo come up for the creative team three and I was like, why does that logo look so distinctive and it came to my mind after the fact.
680000	694000	The font is the same font used in Final Fantasy 14. I didn't connect it right away, but I connected it later. It was creative team three. And then I'm watching it and I'm like, this really has like a 14 kind of vibe to it.
694000	700000	I'm not familiar with the storyline in 14. Are some of the characters the same in this one?
700000	716000	No, no, it's just, it's just kind of like the look of it and just kind of like the vibe you get. The combat also kind of reminded me of if you completely took the interface off of 14, and obviously you don't have multiple people on the screen but I mean some things in 14 you're doing by yourself.
716000	732000	The combat looked a little 14 to me. But I wouldn't, I wouldn't read too much into that. But I mean, sure enough, we found out that Naoki Yoshida, who is the producer and director of 14, is the producer of 16. Those were some early rumors out there that he was kind of shooting down.
732000	744000	Well, I think he said, I'm not the director of 16. And he's not. He's the producer. So you know, semantics, right? But somebody else from his team that worked on Stormblood is the director of the game.
744000	760000	And so this is going to be a single player Final Fantasy 14 inspired game. And I am like, I got chills when I made the connection. I'm like, because again, like I know not everybody has played Final Fantasy 14 because I get it. It's an MMO. It's a monthly fee.
760000	776000	It's not for everybody. But I'm telling you, the story in 14 is so good, especially when you get to the expansions, that like the fact that that is going to get realized as a single player game in Final Fantasy 16, like the bar is already set high, which is a dangerous thing.
776000	794000	I admit, I mean, this game could be garbage and just, you know, it's unfortunate. But I, I just, I so don't want to believe that. Like, I so feel like the formula is in a really good place. And I am really excited for this game that I haven't been for a game this far out in a very long time.
794000	802000	So now with that being said, let me just poo poo on all that.
802000	804000	Can't wait.
804000	825000	So, you know, another game that I was highly anticipating that also was touted as like a single player, you know, campaign, the Avengers became a live service game. What if this happens? The same thing happens to this as a live service game. I understand that they have 14, which is kind of like that, but they like all the money. So, you know,
826000	838000	Let's see. Actually, you know what's interesting? I'm hearing mixed things on the Avengers, because I'm hearing that early demo was not very well received. But the people that have bought the full game and are playing the full game, I don't see a lot of negative reaction.
838000	849000	I feel like a lot of people that are playing the Avengers are enjoying it. But again, I haven't played it myself, so I can't tell you what I think. But that's just the vibe I'm getting on social media.
849000	851000	I do want that one.
851000	858000	Gotcha. And fifth dream in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says I hate the Avengers game TBH. So there you go. One bad opinion.
858000	874000	I hear the gameplay can be fun, like because they have it kind of broken up with like some of these linear story sections. And then they have kind of like the, you know, recycle quests type things where it's like, go here, do this type of stuff.
875000	887000	The story stuff is pretty good and the gameplay is pretty good, but it's like some of these quests, plus that they completely ripped off Destiny 2, like everything is a Destiny 2.
887000	899000	They basically just took it, put it in this game, tweaked the names of things, and that's it. I mean, it's kind of rushed, but that's why I think we're hearing mixed things on it.
899000	910000	I'm going to leave it to Naoki Yoshida, who strikes me as a real fan of gaming and the genre, to make the decision that he believes is best as the producer. And I'm just going to really try to have faith. We'll see.
910000	918000	There is an early rumor. You know, there's a lot of memes online about, oh, here we go, another white dude protagonist in Final Fantasy 16.
918000	927000	But, and I want to stress, this is a rumor, but it's coming from the same place that the Final Fantasy 16 is tied to the PlayStation 5 announcement came from.
927000	935000	Rumor, rumor that 16 is going to have a character creator and it's going to be kind of like Shepard in Mass Effect.
935000	945000	So there will be male and female versions and everything will be voice, male and female. And there's going to be a character creator, which would be something that exists in Final Fantasy 14.
945000	964000	Again, yeah, that would be awesome. And it makes a lot of sense. I think Mass Effect is a great template that shows it can be done. And the 14 team kind of doing that, they have experience writing a story like that from a you name it type of protagonist.
964000	972000	So that would be very exciting. But I want to, you know, I again, I'm stressing rumor and I know some of you hate when I talk about rumors on this show, but I think that's one worth bringing up.
972000	980000	But level your expectation. Don't set that as an expectation. Anyway.
980000	993000	And anyways, so moving on from Final Fantasy, they showed the first combat footage in gameplay of Spider-Man Miles Morales, which looks pretty awesome.
993000	998000	Yeah, looks like the game is going to be coming to both the PlayStation 4 and 5. So it looks pretty cool.
999000	1010000	That was a little surprising, though, the fact that it's going to be 4 and 5. Everybody kind of thought this was like the big exclusive that 5 has right out the gate. And that isn't going to be the case. That was a little bit surprising.
1010000	1023000	But I mean, you know, the footage you were looking at was from a 5. It's going to be as the best it possibly can be. A good game is a good game. So I guess at the end of the day, it won't matter, right?
1023000	1037000	Yeah. After years of rumors and leaked trailers and stuff like that, finally got the trailer announcement for Hogwarts Legacy, which is supposed to be coming to PlayStation 5.
1037000	1046000	So it's supposed to take place before all of the Harry Potter stuff in the 1800s, I guess. So that looked interesting.
1046000	1058000	Definitely had that epic adventure feel to it. And I think there's been a lot of people that had really wanted a game like this up until about a year ago, but we'll get into that later in the show.
1058000	1061000	A year ago? We knew about this in age before.
1061000	1064000	Oh, I thought it was a little more recent.
1064000	1066000	No, the controversy has been going on for some time.
1066000	1069000	Yikes. All right, well, we'll get into it later in the show.
1070000	1081000	They showed off some more footage of Call of Duty, Black Ops, Cold War, more Deathloop. I don't know, Deathloop looks okay, but God, I wish they would cut down on the trailers for that.
1081000	1087000	Deathloop looked more like my kind of vibe, like the type of game I would play versus Call of Duty. No shade.
1087000	1094000	It's just like Dishonored. I mean, it's pretty much Dishonored with a time loop, which I mean, it's the same team, so it makes sense.
1094000	1102000	I liked the art direction in that trailer, too. I kind of liked that film noir vibe it had going for it. I thought it was pretty cool.
1102000	1109000	Yeah, it looked cool. Devil May Cry 5 is going to be getting a PlayStation 5 version.
1109000	1110000	Cool.
1110000	1119000	There's a new trailer for Oddworld Soulstorm that looks kind of interesting. A new Five Nights at Freddy's game announced.
1119000	1121000	That was unexpected.
1121000	1122000	Yeah, definitely.
1122000	1131000	Because those games have traditionally been either iPhone, Android, or desktop games. There was a Five Nights VR.
1131000	1149000	Yeah, but that's one of the ones, though, that is that timed exclusive type of thing. In fact, actually, in the trailer here, when they talk about the exclusives available on PC, not available on other consoles until three months later.
1149000	1150000	Do you know?
1150000	1151000	That's after release date.
1151000	1159000	When that trailer first showed up, did you think it was Five Nights? Because I totally thought it was something else, and I was like, oh my gosh, this looks so good.
1159000	1165000	Do you know? And then it was Five Nights at Freddy's. I was like, damn, I was hoping it was the other thing. Do you know what vibe I got from it at first?
1165000	1167000	Portal?
1168000	1177000	That sprung to mind. That was my very first was, ooh, this might be Portal. But then my second thought, and I was like, oh no, it's Bioshock.
1177000	1188000	They're taking a Stranger Things vibe, like an 80's Stranger Things vibe, and gelling it with Bioshock. And I was like, oh, I'm here for this game.
1188000	1191000	And then it was Five Nights at Freddy's, and I have to admit, I was a little bit like, oh.
1191000	1193000	I was like, yeah, no, I'm not here for this game.
1193000	1200000	No, I don't want to hate on Five Nights. Look, just because I'm not a big fan of the jump scare games, I'm kind of like, oh, okay.
1200000	1204000	And I was like, damn, this is what happens when you set expectations.
1204000	1210000	Definitely, I did get a Bioshock vibe from it as well, because it looked like Rapture.
1210000	1218000	But now that's what I want from a new Bioshock game, is I'm like, Bioshock meets Stranger Things type of thing would be pretty incredible.
1218000	1230000	They have a whole lot of opportunity with the Bioshock Infinite, because remember, she kept pulling stuff through those rifts from alternate 80's dimensions and stuff like that.
1230000	1236000	So there could be something cool like that, but someday we'll get a new Bioshock game. Amazing.
1236000	1243000	They've been kind of quiet on the Bioshock front. You feel like they're working on something, and I keep feeling like, okay, any day now we're going to see a new Bioshock.
1243000	1246000	And I thought it might be this week, but that's okay.
1247000	1254000	They showed some more footage for Demon's Souls, which looks amazing. I mean, that's how you do a remake right there.
1254000	1256000	Yeah, it did look really good.
1257000	1263000	And then what I thought was going to be an announcement of like some sort of games pass type thing.
1263000	1275000	They talked a little bit about these, it's like PlayStation Plus, their collection of titles that they have, the PlayStation Plus collection.
1275000	1277000	Yeah, that's what it's called.
1277000	1284000	And it was just a few titles that they were offering for free with the PlayStation 5 launch, if you have PlayStation Plus.
1284000	1285000	Yeah.
1285000	1292000	Which I got to be honest, I have most of these already. It's not a big deal.
1292000	1300000	I thought for sure, oh, collection, here's games pass, it's their answer to it. It's like, disappointed.
1300000	1304000	Well, it was okay. I had several thoughts about it.
1304000	1311000	I was kind of like, okay, well, many of these games, PlayStation Plus, I mean, you said I have most of these games.
1311000	1314000	I would bet you probably got them all through PlayStation Plus at some point.
1314000	1317000	Yeah, I think a lot of them I did.
1317000	1326000	So it kind of sounds like they're opening the PlayStation Plus vault in some way and bringing back a lot of games you can download again as some kind of answer to game pass.
1326000	1329000	I'm kind of like, all right, well, that's okay.
1329000	1334000	But there is that very big fact that they're not charging another fee for it.
1334000	1341000	It is a part of PlayStation Plus, and that's pretty big that you're not having to pay anything extra for it.
1341000	1343000	So that's pretty cool.
1343000	1347000	And game pass, when it first rolled out, did not have the most impressive lineup in the world.
1347000	1351000	It was something they built over a couple of years that it's been around now.
1351000	1356000	So it will be interesting to see how much and how regularly PlayStation adds to that.
1356000	1364000	Are there going to be free PlayStation Plus games of the month anymore, or is it just going to be we're adding them into the library?
1364000	1366000	Because I kind of feel like that's where it's going to go.
1366000	1370000	They're just going to add games into the library now, and it's not going to be what it was before.
1370000	1372000	Because that's fine.
1372000	1376000	I'm kind of fine with that, because if you forget to download it, you can still get it.
1376000	1378000	Especially because there's no fee beyond play.
1378000	1380000	So it's not like they're going to make you pay more money.
1380000	1383000	It's just the logical next step on how they do it.
1383000	1387000	Yeah, I'd be curious to see what they do with that.
1387000	1389000	But that's pretty much it.
1389000	1395000	So then finally, at the very end, before we'll get to the pricing in just a sec.
1395000	1401000	So at the very end they teased Ragnarok is coming, so obviously a new God of War game coming in 2021.
1401000	1402000	Yep.
1402000	1403000	Which is fine.
1403000	1408000	And then finally they said, of course they announced the pricing of the PlayStation 5.
1408000	1415000	They've got the price at $499 for the system with the disk drive, $399 for the digital edition.
1415000	1424000	And those are both going to be coming out on November 12th in the US, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea.
1424000	1428000	And then the rest of the territories on November 19th.
1428000	1432000	And that's, for me, that's exactly what I was expecting.
1432000	1434000	And I think what most people were expecting.
1434000	1441000	Well, some I think expected an undercut to Xbox's price, but I feel like this is a different situation than last time.
1441000	1447000	Microsoft made a choice and what ultimately was a bad choice from a sales perspective.
1447000	1452000	Sorry, I know some of you were fans of it, but from a larger perspective, it was a bad choice to bundle connect with the system.
1452000	1454000	Mandatory, basically.
1454000	1456000	And so that isn't a factor this time.
1456000	1462000	So I kind of expected PlayStation and Microsoft to have price parity of their high-end systems.
1462000	1466000	Now, granted, every company found a way to cut the price of that somehow.
1466000	1468000	PlayStation cut the price with the digital edition.
1468000	1471000	Microsoft cut it with a lower spec edition, the Series S.
1471000	1478000	But essentially, the Mercedes-Benz systems, the top-of-the-line ones, are the same price.
1478000	1481000	So it's going to be interesting for this gen.
1481000	1484000	And here's something, though, that's also interesting.
1484000	1488000	We don't know necessarily what the prices are on the Xbox game front.
1488000	1495000	But on the PlayStation side, though, there's already a few first-party titles that are $70 retail.
1495000	1499000	So Demon's Souls and Destruction All-Stars are going to be $70.
1499000	1503000	Marvel's Spider-Man and Miles Morales is going to be $50.
1503000	1505000	They're going to have an ultimate edition for $70.
1505000	1508000	And Sackboy's Big Adventure is going to be $60.
1508000	1515000	So interesting that they're going $70 on some of those.
1516000	1529000	I would be fine with that in this generation if I knew that it wasn't going to be followed up by the usual nonsense with season passes and shoving microtransactions, standard throw, loot boxes, and all this stuff.
1529000	1532000	But I know it's definitely going to still be there.
1532000	1536000	Yeah, I think it really depends on what they kind of do with that price.
1536000	1539000	You know, and it's interesting because we're talking about $70 game generation.
1539000	1542000	But I actually don't really think that label is true.
1542000	1548000	We're looking at the generation where we'll pay $70 for some games, for AAA games, for first-party games.
1548000	1550000	But the price of games is all over the map.
1550000	1558000	And especially now that we have digital exclusive systems, you know, some games are $9.99, some are $29.99, some are $70.
1558000	1561000	It's just going to be all over the map, and it's very interesting.
1561000	1563000	I think they're just testing the waters is what it is.
1563000	1567000	I think that they want to be at $70, but they're waiting for the backlash from it.
1567000	1571000	And if they don't get that backlash, then they're just going to go full in with that.
1571000	1574000	I kind of think most of us have been expecting it for some time.
1574000	1577000	I'm ready for it. It is what it is.
1577000	1579000	I'm with the statement that you said, Loki.
1579000	1586000	If we're paying $10 to get rid of some of this nickel and diming BS we've seen over the last generation, then fine.
1588000	1591000	And Bobby says, you know, AAA game budgets have balloons.
1591000	1597000	Yes, but you have obviously heard from all these companies where they're making billions of dollars off of microtransactions.
1597000	1600000	So I think that their games are well within their budgets.
1600000	1602000	They'd be covered by those microtransactions.
1602000	1608000	And I don't think that they need to nickel and dime an initial, well, not even nickel and dime, an additional $10 on top of that.
1608000	1610000	They're making plenty of money.
1610000	1613000	And trust me, all that money is not going to the development teams.
1613000	1615000	It's going to the CEOs of those companies.
1615000	1628000	So I don't feel a little bit sad at them at all for, you know, not making an additional $10 off of me, to be honest, because it's not going to the people that really need it.
1628000	1638000	It's going to people who make these poor decisions and end up screwing up our games because they're shoving all this microtransactions up because they're trying to appease their investors is what it is.
1638000	1642000	I kind of feel like, again, it's just it's the $70.
1642000	1644000	People are going to pay it.
1644000	1651000	And I think this debate, I'm not I'm not dismissing what you're saying, Loki at all, but I just kind of feel like it's it's ultimately we just need to be ready for it.
1651000	1653000	It's the it's the era of the $70 game.
1653000	1657000	And if you want to play a AAA game like God of War day one, you're going to pay it.
1657000	1662000	But you also know that if you don't pay it right away, games tend to go down in price.
1662000	1667000	So it's it's it's so interesting because usually we can compare things to music and movies.
1667000	1680000	But this is something somewhat unique in games, although I would say the closest thing I could think of is people who paid the $30 to have Mulan on Disney Plus.
1680000	1683000	Now, reviews of that movie aside, I'm not here to debate the quality of that movie.
1683000	1685000	I haven't seen it, so I don't care.
1685000	1690000	But some people paid $30 so they could have it in their house the very first day it was available.
1690000	1693000	Some people are going to wait until it's free on Disney Plus.
1693000	1696000	It just kind of depends on what is for your situation.
1696000	1700000	And I think that's still going to be true of the $70 game, that's for sure.
1700000	1708000	Some people are going to pay it because they also would be the type that would pay $30 to get Mulan day one on top of their Disney Plus fee.
1708000	1712000	Right. And honestly, like, you know, let's just put it this way.
1712000	1723000	Like Sony can charge $70 for their games, but that's also going to make a better argument for games pass on the Xbox side of things because they're including first party games in with that price.
1723000	1730000	And honestly, if everything's going to be $70 this generation, that's looking at like a much better deal in the long run.
1730000	1732000	So I don't know.
1732000	1738000	It's I'm kind of disappointed that they didn't come out with something similar to kind of counteract that.
1738000	1741000	I don't think PlayStation now is a good alternative for that.
1741000	1750000	Also disappointed this year that apparently that this generation is not going to be backwards compatible with the PlayStation three, two or one.
1750000	1753000	It's only going to be with the PlayStation four, which is something I guess.
1753000	1758000	But it's still like, really, you can't you can't play PlayStation one games.
1758000	1762000	I mean, God, my cell phone can probably emulate a PlayStation one.
1762000	1768000	Just find you saying that this is brand new cutting edge system just it's just not able to do it.
1768000	1769000	It's just impossible.
1769000	1781000	I will say I will say, Loki, I completely agree with you on the point that games pass and that sort of system is ultimately where I think this generation of games ends up.
1781000	1788000	You know, we might be looking at the $70 game now, but I think it is going to drive more and more people to a subscription based service.
1788000	1790000	And Sony's catching up on that front.
1790000	1793000	They're not there yet, but they're laying the groundwork for it.
1793000	1797000	And I think that will continue as this generation moves on.
1797000	1798000	I do want to get some other comments from chat.
1798000	1809000	SSJ 100 Matt says, you know, counter take, I would much rather pay $70 for a game if the developer didn't require their staff crunch to finish the project and hire more help to finish a game.
1809000	1810000	I can see that.
1810000	1814000	That comment from twitch.tv slash vog network.
1814000	1820000	I do want to ask kind of like a TLDR question from all of you.
1820000	1821000	I'm going to ask you guys in chat.
1821000	1830000	I'm going to ask dark Sakura and Loki and my TLDR question about this whole PS five event is where was your head at before this event?
1830000	1832000	Were you I'm going to get a PS five day one.
1832000	1833000	I'm going to get a PS five eventually.
1833000	1834000	I'm never getting a PS five.
1834000	1836000	Where was your head out before this event?
1836000	1839000	Did the event change your mind?
1839000	1842000	So that's the TLDR question I want to ask.
1842000	1846000	Dark Sakura, I'm going to start with you because I haven't heard from you in a sec.
1846000	1847000	No.
1847000	1848000	No, what?
1848000	1850000	I'm still not preordering anything.
1850000	1853000	I am still going to wait.
1853000	1859000	You know, it's just like it's kind of what we did with the PS four.
1859000	1861000	You know, we didn't really didn't put in a preorder.
1861000	1863000	We you know, we got into ours.
1863000	1869000	I'm kind of over the whole preorder and wait for a thing because they're going to be there.
1869000	1872000	You know, they're not going to sell out forever.
1872000	1878000	It's not going to be like, you know, the person that goes off and buys one and then breaks it in front of people.
1878000	1880000	It's I mean, whoever is going to do that.
1880000	1883000	Yeah, they're they're a dick and they're out of their money.
1883000	1886000	But I mean, it's not it's not that urgent to me.
1886000	1888000	It really isn't.
1888000	1890000	I can wait.
1890000	1895000	I'm this is one of the first years where I really feel like I can wait.
1895000	1903000	I know. And you you and I and many people out there also come from a generation where we remember lining up for a Dreamcast,
1903000	1906000	lining up for a we lining up for a PlayStation two.
1906000	1913000	And I don't know if that's a sign of our age or just how we're feeling about this generation of games was just kind of like, all right, well, we'll get around to it eventually.
1913000	1920000	Right. It's also a little bit of kind of wanting to break that thing.
1920000	1929000	It's a very capitalist kind of thing where they put out the anticipation, they build this and build this and build this, you know, and really all they care about is the money.
1929000	1933000	You know, I kind of don't want to contribute to that anymore.
1933000	1936000	You know, let me get some comments. Yeah, of course.
1936000	1942000	Let me get some comments from chat and I'll get to Loki Morrisimo in chat says day one before and after.
1942000	1944000	So there you go.
1944000	1947000	Just cemented the decision to buy one day one.
1947000	1954000	That's why you're not alone in that. I know that Bobby Black Wolf in chat says the only reason I want to PlayStation five on launch day is because of the podcast.
1954000	1956000	If I was not a podcaster, I would be waiting.
1956000	1961000	Yeah. You know, I definitely feel a little bit of that pressure, like, oh, I should have one because of the show.
1961000	1965000	But I feel like most of you guys are in just like a similar boat to me.
1965000	1970000	Like, it's very hard to say I'm going to get a PlayStation five and an Xbox Series X.
1970000	1974000	And for me, you guys, I haven't said this on the show in a while.
1974000	1980000	Remember, reminder, I don't have a 4K TV yet, so that's something I have to buy this year.
1980000	1985000	So I kind of have to cut something loose to be able to afford this year.
1985000	1990000	So and obviously, a lot of people are hurting out there in the world right now.
1990000	1995000	I'm very, very lucky, very, very fortunate to still be working in spite of the world conditions.
1995000	1998000	I'm lucky I can be talking about these game systems at all.
1998000	2001000	I think there's a lot of people that are going to be waiting a little bit.
2001000	2008000	Anyway, I'll see a pixel Baucus kind of following that up, saying I want a PlayStation five Xbox Series X or S due to reviewing games.
2008000	2011000	But I could also keep reviewing games on my PlayStation. I'm sorry.
2011000	2015000	I'm sorry. On my PC. Sjoan Hunter Matt says, I'm waiting on a PS5 for next year.
2015000	2020000	OK, Loki, please. So your thoughts before and your thoughts after.
2020000	2024000	I don't know. I wasn't really sold on it before, and I'm not really sold on it after either.
2024000	2031000	Like, I get it that like Final Fantasy is coming out, but how many years did we see a trailer for Final Fantasy 13?
2031000	2034000	How many? Did we see a date when this game's coming out?
2034000	2038000	How about Final Fantasy 15? There was more of those.
2038000	2043000	But yes. Yeah. So like, I mean, honestly, when I was thinking 13, I mean 13 verses.
2043000	2048000	But like like honestly, this game's not coming out any time soon.
2048000	2051000	So like no reason for me to jump in just to give this in.
2051000	2059000	Like honestly, like I haven't really been interested in a lot of the first party Sony titles aside from.
2059000	2063000	I don't know, I can't really think of any like God of War.
2063000	2066000	I mean, it's a great game. Just not really interested in it anymore.
2066000	2071000	Last of Us, not interested in it. Uncharted? Nope.
2071000	2077000	I can play those on my PlayStation 4. I don't know.
2077000	2085000	Like even like the Spider-Man game looks kind of cool, but I didn't get it last time either.
2085000	2088000	So like I've got a lot of games in my backlog anyways to pick up.
2088000	2091000	So I'm just going to wait, I think, on that system.
2091000	2098000	I'm more interested, though, like on the Xbox side of things, just because of Game Pass and all that.
2098000	2105000	And also the system is much smaller like that thing. Even the digital edition of the PlayStation 5 is enormous.
2105000	2109000	Like it's oddly shaped to like where the hell am I going to put this thing?
2109000	2114000	So like, I don't I don't know. That's like also one of the reasons, too.
2114000	2118000	I like the fact that the Xbox is boxy and small.
2118000	2121000	In fact, it's kind of funny. They actually released online.
2121000	2125000	You can go download a papercraft version of the Xbox and fold it up and actually see where it will fit.
2125000	2129000	Oh, wow. In your like AV setup if you want. So I may check that out.
2129000	2132000	But it was actually smaller than I thought it would be.
2132000	2137000	So that's where I'm at, assuming that I can actually get one of those.
2137000	2140000	And even if I don't at launch, you know, it's not a big deal.
2140000	2143000	Really only game looking forward to this year anyways is Cyberpunk.
2143000	2148000	I have a PC for that, so I can wait on everything actually.
2148000	2151000	I'm going to the chat for some more comments.
2151000	2155000	We have Shehulk10 who says, nobody needs these consoles.
2155000	2159000	And that's very true. Nobody needs it. It's not water or shelter.
2159000	2162000	Certainly with 2020 being the way it's been.
2162000	2168000	I understand why people want them very badly to help them cope with what a crazy year it's been and just everything else.
2168000	2170000	Video games are an outlet.
2170000	2175000	Video games are a way of expressing energy and spending that.
2175000	2179000	But I also completely understand, nobody needs this, right?
2179000	2184000	And some people have to spend that money on other things and that's fine.
2184000	2187000	Questbuster says, get behind me, FOMO. Get behind me.
2187000	2189000	I want to reassure those with FOMO.
2189000	2192000	It's okay if you can't afford these consoles day one.
2192000	2195000	Don't let any marketing campaign or anything tell you otherwise.
2195000	2197000	You are still a gamer.
2198000	2203000	This is why games are still coming out on the PlayStation 4, even when they're coming out on PlayStation 5.
2203000	2206000	And Microsoft has a very similar strategy.
2206000	2217000	I actually had one of the digital editions in a car or something and I was like, no, I don't need it.
2217000	2221000	But yeah, that is definitely a real thing.
2222000	2227000	Another comment here from Black Compat who says, I'll get a PS5 in time for God of War Ragnarok.
2227000	2233000	Yeah, it sounds like there's a lot of people where it's like, when that one game I have to have is available, then that's when I'm going to break.
2233000	2241000	So for me, the event did not change my mind, although I was neither unhappy or ecstatic with it.
2241000	2243000	I thought it was, actually, I shouldn't say that.
2243000	2245000	I thought it was fine. I thought it was a good presentation.
2245000	2249000	I liked it that it wasn't just follow ups on all the things they did before.
2250000	2254000	And for the most part, it was really primarily new stuff they were showing.
2254000	2256000	And so I will give them props for that.
2256000	2261000	However, did it change my mind to not get PlayStation 5 day one?
2261000	2263000	It did not change my mind.
2263000	2266000	I did not participate in the PlayStation 5 pre-orders.
2266000	2268000	This is certainly nothing anti-Sony.
2268000	2271000	I'm kind of with that earlier comment I just read.
2271000	2274000	You know by the time Final Fantasy 16 comes out, I'm going to have one of these.
2274000	2275000	There's no question.
2275000	2278000	And it probably will be in the budget for next year.
2278000	2283000	I have opted this year to order a Xbox Series X day one.
2283000	2288000	Now before you guys want to turn this into a Microsoft versus Sony thing, I want to stress, it's not.
2288000	2291000	I'm a fan of everything, including Nintendo.
2291000	2295000	And this is just kind of the ebb and flow of the way things work sometimes.
2295000	2296000	Go back to last gen.
2296000	2300000	I had a PS4 day one, and I got the Xbox One after they detached Kinect.
2300000	2302000	Go back to the gen before that.
2302000	2307000	I had an Xbox 360 as soon as I could get one, and then I got a PlayStation 3 eventually.
2307000	2308000	Go back to the gen before that.
2308000	2309000	It was flipped again.
2309000	2311000	I got the PS2 first, then I got the Xbox later.
2311000	2313000	So my point is, this is just how it flows.
2313000	2321000	And I think the fact that I already have a PlayStation Pro, but my Xbox One is still really early on,
2321000	2323000	is heavily factoring into that decision.
2323000	2330000	I feel like the upgrade for me from Xbox One plane, J in addition, to Xbox Series X
2330000	2334000	is going to be a more monumental upgrade than PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5.
2334000	2343000	And the bottom line, what really sells me on it, I don't think either one of these consoles has a particularly strong day one lineup.
2343000	2344000	That's just the reality.
2344000	2351000	However, COVID and the 2020 situation and the supply chain and all that, I kind of get it.
2351000	2353000	Like, I'm not an angry gamer about it.
2353000	2360000	I'm actually quite surprised both of these systems are still coming out in 2020, to be quite honest.
2360000	2369000	But what pushes Series X just a little ahead for me is how they are embracing the backwards compatibility.
2369000	2379000	And I don't mean just emulating Xbox One and 360 and Xbox, something Sony has declined to do,
2379000	2384000	but they are actually enhancing the backwards compatibility library.
2384000	2392000	So if I get an Xbox Series X day one, and I don't even have to necessarily buy any of the launch day games,
2392000	2398000	I will know, ooh, I'm getting a system that's going to enhance all of these games that I own.
2398000	2405000	Whereas if I bought a PlayStation 5 day one, I feel like the messaging is, well, I can still play my PlayStation 4 games,
2405000	2410000	and they'll be a little faster thanks to the drive, but we haven't done anything to it besides that.
2410000	2412000	And your 3-2-1 games don't work either.
2412000	2419000	So for that reason, I'm waiting for the PlayStation 5 game I have to have to get a PlayStation 5.
2419000	2427000	So that is my reasoning on why I'm saying Xbox Series X for me day one and PlayStation 5 in 2021.
2427000	2433000	So any other comments or follow-up on the PlayStation 5 conference?
2433000	2434000	No?
2434000	2436000	All right, then.
2436000	2438000	I'll play somebody else's, though.
2438000	2444000	Yeah, of course, of course. When it's safe to hang out again, we'll all have to go to Loki's and play his PlayStation 5 if he gets one,
2444000	2447000	and y'all can come over here and play my Xbox.
2447000	2449000	By the way, Rob, pray for me.
2449000	2451000	I signed up for an MMO.
2451000	2453000	Oh, which one?
2453000	2455000	You want to take a guess?
2455000	2457000	Oh, 14. Did you come back to 14?
2457000	2458000	I came back to 14.
2458000	2461000	Oh, wowee. All right. That's going to be fun.
2461000	2462000	Just now.
2462000	2466000	Just now. What tipped the scales on that for you?
2466000	2471000	I had a Twitter poll, and everyone told me to come back to this.
2471000	2472000	Okay.
2472000	2473000	So I said, okay.
2473000	2476000	Well, if you ever need help with Dungeons, you know I got your back.
2476000	2480000	You know I will, because I need to get leveled. I quit after Heavensward.
2480000	2485000	All right. Well, the expansion storylines are really good.
2485000	2487000	So I'll have to see that jerk face again.
2487000	2489000	Excited to see your reaction to that.
2489000	2491000	Let's see. Other comments here.
2492000	2496000	Sj100matt says, it also supports cross saves on some titles.
2496000	2499000	Forza Horizon 4 has cross save transfers to Series X.
2499000	2502000	Oh, yes. That's right. That is a thing.
2502000	2505000	And Sj100matt also said, and I think this is a very good point
2505000	2507000	and something I neglected to say in my argument,
2507000	2510000	Game Pass sold me on sticking with a Series X.
2510000	2515000	That is another thing that definitely weighed into my thought process, too,
2515000	2519000	was like, ooh, I want to play Flight Simulator on console.
2519000	2523000	Somebody correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe a version of Flight Simulator
2523000	2526000	is coming out for consoles, and I'm all about that.
2526000	2529000	Yeah, I'm really excited for that. So there's that.
2529000	2533000	Questbuster says, I'm not mad about either presentation. No hate.
2533000	2535000	Both camps will find something to love,
2535000	2539000	but it's hard not to see how aggressive Microsoft is this time around
2539000	2541000	with their technology and ecosystem.
2541000	2544000	And in my opinion, this is a big difference between
2544000	2547000	Don Mattrick, who led the company when Xbox One came out,
2547000	2550000	and Phil Spencer, and where the company is at now.
2550000	2554000	And I said this on a previous episode of OLR, and I'm going to say it again.
2554000	2558000	Those of you that write Microsoft off with one fell swoop,
2558000	2561000	I really need you to reexamine your approach.
2561000	2564000	And I would tell the exact same thing to anybody trying to write off
2564000	2568000	Nintendo or Sony. They are all doing great things right now,
2568000	2572000	and it's time for all of these game companies to get the respect they deserve.
2572000	2576000	I'm not going to let gaming fans write off Xbox anymore.
2576000	2580000	Now, I understand the golden rule of gaming.
2580000	2582000	A system is only as good as the games that are on it,
2582000	2586000	so I understand that if you're not into the things like Halo,
2586000	2588000	and Call of Duty, and stuff like that,
2588000	2592000	that it's going to shift your opinion and things like that.
2592000	2594000	That is completely understandable.
2594000	2598000	But take a look at Microsoft is super diversifying
2598000	2601000	what people have stereotyped them about before,
2601000	2604000	with games like Tell Me Why in Game Pass,
2604000	2607000	and the strength of the indie games that are on Game Pass as well.
2607000	2611000	That's my honest thought on that stuff.
2611000	2614000	Alright, anyway, but I love all games.
2614000	2616000	This is going to be an exciting generation of games everywhere,
2616000	2621000	including PC, so we all win, except our wallets lose.
2621000	2624000	Alright, anyway, let's get into something more topical.
2624000	2626000	Let's talk about our gaming weeks,
2626000	2629000	and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
2629000	2631000	So, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
2631000	2633000	It was actually eventful.
2633000	2638000	My iPad Pro arrived, so I've been trying out a bunch of different stuff.
2638000	2640000	Of course, I'm back on Patterned.
2640000	2644000	We've got a couple pinball games,
2644000	2646000	Dan's been playing a couple of them.
2646000	2648000	I'm trying to actually think, because I've got a lot of stuff.
2648000	2653000	I actually restarted Final Fantasy V.
2653000	2654000	Oh, cool.
2654000	2657000	I've really just been using it for some of my retro gaming,
2657000	2660000	and it's been pretty cool.
2660000	2665000	The next thing I have to do is hook up my SteelSeries controller,
2665000	2667000	so that I can actually play controller games.
2667000	2669000	Oh, and I also got Among Us.
2669000	2671000	Oh.
2671000	2676000	Now, I just did the free play to kind of get a feel for it,
2676000	2679000	and it was really fun going around just killing people.
2679000	2684000	So, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing that.
2684000	2685000	Seems sus.
2685000	2687000	I don't know who else is playing.
2687000	2689000	Now, after you said that,
2689000	2693000	every time you go in to play a game with anybody from OLR,
2693000	2695000	they're going to be DarkSakura's sus.
2695000	2699000	She's a thrill killer.
2699000	2703000	You know, I really hope that I get to be the imposter.
2703000	2708000	I think sabotaging everyone's fun would be delightful.
2709000	2711000	I mean, did I say that out loud?
2711000	2713000	You need to talk to Shane,
2713000	2715000	because he just jumped on that bandwagon this week, too,
2715000	2719000	and Delvin at VG Realness has been trying to talk me into getting it
2719000	2722000	and playing with him, which I probably will give in and do,
2722000	2723000	so stay tuned.
2723000	2726000	There might be some fun Among Us nights coming soon.
2726000	2731000	But, yeah, I'm almost scared to play that game,
2731000	2732000	because I don't know.
2732000	2737000	I sometimes feel like I'm not a great liar in some of those games.
2737000	2739000	But then again, you know, I won the Survivor game,
2739000	2740000	so maybe I can do it.
2740000	2741000	I don't know. We'll see.
2741000	2742000	Maybe you can do it.
2742000	2743000	Yeah.
2743000	2744000	I have faith in you.
2744000	2747000	I've enjoyed watching the Twitch streams that I've been watching on it.
2747000	2749000	This kind of makes me think of the old Werewolf game
2749000	2752000	that we used to play in DDR Freak.
2752000	2757000	It's totally Werewolf slash Mafia slash The Resistance.
2757000	2759000	It's totally that as a video game.
2759000	2764000	And those guys are smart for taking a very good formula
2764000	2766000	and adapting it into a video game.
2766000	2767000	Yeah.
2767000	2771000	I like that it even does a few things to help you mask the person,
2771000	2775000	but it also kind of gives me a little bit of Danganronpa,
2775000	2778000	as in, you know, you can call, like,
2778000	2780000	I'm going to just nickname this a trial,
2780000	2788000	but like an emergency meeting that you can discuss who might the villain be.
2788000	2791000	The emergency meeting meme is great, too.
2791000	2793000	I'm loving that as a 2020 meme.
2793000	2795000	I haven't seen a meme yet,
2795000	2800000	because I didn't care enough until I decided just to see what it was about.
2800000	2801000	That's all right.
2801000	2802000	Let's see.
2802000	2803000	Other comments in chat.
2803000	2805000	No One Special 77 says,
2805000	2808000	Would that make her dark sus-gura, though?
2808000	2809000	Asking for science.
2809000	2810000	No.
2810000	2811000	Come on, dad joke.
2811000	2814000	I don't know what the sus is.
2814000	2815000	I'm just going to play it.
2815000	2817000	So when people are, like, chatting,
2817000	2819000	because some people talk over the voice,
2819000	2820000	some people type in text,
2821000	2823000	so a very common thing is, like,
2823000	2824000	dark Sakura seems sus.
2824000	2826000	She was by herself, da-da-da.
2826000	2828000	So sus is, like, short for suspect.
2828000	2829000	Suspicious?
2829000	2830000	Yeah, suspicious.
2830000	2832000	Okay, I get that.
2832000	2833000	And let's see.
2833000	2836000	Bobby Black Wolf is pointing out Among Us has kind of grown a lot
2836000	2837000	since it first came out.
2837000	2839000	It's also different now than it was in 2018.
2839000	2843000	They made a lot of updates to get it to the way it is today.
2843000	2845000	And yeah, so this is one of those interesting things
2845000	2848000	where this video game's been around for a few years.
2848000	2852000	It just now is gaining intensity because of things like Twitch.
2852000	2855000	Bobby's saying a big name Twitch streamer got a hold of it.
2855000	2856000	Who knows?
2856000	2857000	Maybe they were sponsored, maybe not.
2857000	2858000	I don't know.
2858000	2860000	But now a lot of people are doing it.
2860000	2864000	That's how Binding of Isaac got popular.
2864000	2865000	I thought...
2865000	2867000	The streamer found it, and yeah.
2867000	2869000	Shit, Minecraft.
2869000	2870000	Yeah.
2870000	2872000	And that actually is according to the devs, so...
2872000	2873000	Yeah.
2873000	2874000	Anyway.
2874000	2876000	Anything else for your gaming week?
2876000	2877000	No.
2877000	2878000	Okay.
2878000	2880000	Then Loki, how was your gaming week?
2880000	2882000	I didn't really play too much.
2882000	2886000	I've been playing a bit of Orna just to do my daily wars,
2886000	2892000	and when I go places I try to capture any territories that I'm near.
2892000	2893000	What else?
2893000	2897000	So I've been playing a little bit of Hot Shots Racing.
2897000	2901000	I think I played a little bit of Minecraft this week as well.
2901000	2903000	Mainly just been working on game development stuff.
2903000	2905000	That's really what I've been doing.
2905000	2909000	I've hired people to write music for me and do sound effects, so...
2909000	2911000	Oh, you're stuck doing this now?
2911000	2913000	You've put money into it.
2913000	2915000	Not much.
2915000	2920000	But yeah, so I've got that going, so I'm expecting to get that stuff hopefully next week.
2920000	2922000	And then...
2922000	2924000	Yeah, just chug it along.
2924000	2925000	Alright, I'm excited for you.
2925000	2928000	What systems are you releasing on?
2930000	2931000	Some of them.
2931000	2932000	Okay, alright.
2932000	2934000	At least one of them.
2934000	2935000	At least PC.
2935000	2937000	Bobby Blocko says Amico. Who knows?
2937000	2938000	Alright.
2938000	2939000	Amico?
2939000	2940000	Anything's possible.
2940000	2942000	I don't even know how you would develop for that.
2942000	2944000	I don't either, but there's got to be a way.
2944000	2948000	If you tweet Tommy Tallarico three times, he'll appear and tell you how to do it.
2948000	2950000	It's like the Candyman.
2950000	2952000	Yeah, it is. It is.
2952000	2954000	The Amica Man.
2954000	2955000	The Amica Man.
2955000	2957000	The Running Man.
2957000	2959000	Shh. Alright.
2959000	2961000	Anyway.
2961000	2963000	Excuse me.
2963000	2965000	My gaming week.
2965000	2967000	Let's talk a little bit about Final Fantasy XIV.
2967000	2970000	Because honestly, I know it's such a meme for me at this point.
2970000	2975000	But I fell on the crafting and gathering bandwagon so hard.
2975000	2978000	I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XIV.
2978000	2982000	I have all of my crafting and gathering jobs past level 65.
2982000	2985000	When less than ten days ago, five of them I hadn't even touched.
2985000	2988000	So I've been playing a lot of crafting and gathering.
2988000	2989000	But it's really fun.
2989000	2992000	And that's where I've been spending, honestly, a lot of my gaming time.
2992000	2994000	I've been playing a little bit of other stuff here and there.
2994000	2997000	Pokemon Go, of course, because today was community day.
2997000	2999000	And so I caught some Porygon shinies.
2999000	3001000	But not a lot.
3001000	3004000	I was reading in Discord, I think SSJ100Mad or somebody was saying,
3004000	3006000	Oh, I caught like 20 of them.
3006000	3008000	And then freaking Shane texted me.
3008000	3012000	He caught over 40 shinies.
3012000	3014000	40! What are you going to do with those?
3014000	3016000	I know.
3016000	3017000	I know. I know.
3017000	3019000	And some things about Shane can't be explained.
3019000	3021000	I really hope he's watching.
3021000	3024000	But yeah, with my luck, though,
3024000	3026000	and maybe this is because I did Bluetooth catching.
3026000	3029000	And Porygons can sometimes be a little bit tougher.
3029000	3030000	I don't know what it is.
3030000	3031000	The CP levels or whatever.
3031000	3034000	But I only got four with my Bluetooth.
3034000	3036000	Now, granted, I didn't play the whole time.
3036000	3038000	I was doing another project this morning.
3038000	3040000	So I really wasn't even out and about until like two o'clock.
3040000	3044000	And I was so low on Pokeballs the way I played.
3044000	3047000	I went downtown to the grid and just used my Bluetooth
3047000	3050000	and drove up and down the grid where I knew all the Poke Stops were.
3050000	3053000	And so that way I was refreshing as I was capturing new stuff.
3053000	3055000	And I only got four shinies that way.
3055000	3057000	But that's okay.
3057000	3060000	I'm more mad that none of them were good.
3060000	3061000	Like, I got a one star.
3061000	3063000	That was my best Porygon.
3063000	3064000	They were all garbage.
3064000	3066000	And I just like to get strong Porygons.
3066000	3067000	That's me.
3067000	3071000	SSJ100Mad says,
3072000	3073000	SSJ100Matt says,
3073000	3074000	I tried to use my Go Plus,
3074000	3078000	but a lot ran away from it because Porygon is a higher tiered Pokemon.
3078000	3080000	So they're more likely to run.
3080000	3081000	And you're right.
3081000	3085000	And I think that was my undoing in this event and why I only got four.
3085000	3088000	Whereas other people I know got over 40.
3088000	3090000	So it just it is what it is.
3090000	3091000	So.
3091000	3092000	All right.
3092000	3093000	Bobby Blackwell says, I got zero.
3093000	3094000	Well, I feel better.
3094000	3095000	Thanks, Bobby.
3095000	3096000	All right.
3096000	3098000	Let's move on from our gaming week.
3098000	3100000	We have a lot of news to get into.
3100000	3101000	Quick housekeeping note.
3101000	3103000	I want to mention this at some point during the show.
3103000	3106000	Some of you probably caught wind of this either on our social media or what have you.
3106000	3111000	I launched a new experiment thing this week at the Voice of Geeks Network called the VoG Roundtable.
3111000	3116000	The idea with this is to try to bring in some new voices into VoG.
3116000	3118000	We have a lot of great voices that are out there already.
3118000	3122000	But I've been meeting a lot of great people through streaming, through networking,
3122000	3125000	and that thing through networking via Dragon Con and other conventions.
3125000	3130000	And we don't often have the ability to, especially when we're all in the same space,
3130000	3133000	have a lot of guests here long term on OLR.
3133000	3135000	So I was thinking, oh, what's something we could do?
3135000	3143000	So we launched the VoG Roundtable to get voices to talk about current trends in geekery.
3143000	3146000	So this week we did one on PlayStation 5.
3146000	3150000	And I did bring Bobby in for one about the Twitch mid-roll ads.
3150000	3154000	I wanted Bobby and I to have a conversation on that because there was a big question about
3154000	3157000	how will this impact VoG? So we kind of talked about that.
3157000	3160000	And then Twitch ended up undoing that for now.
3160000	3165000	But I would say watch it anyway because there's some great alternative ideas to that in there.
3165000	3167000	And hopefully more to come.
3167000	3171000	And in my dream world, I'll do the first some of these.
3171000	3174000	But then pretty soon, Dark Soccer's going to host some roundtables.
3174000	3176000	And Bobby's going to host some roundtables.
3176000	3178000	And all of our VoG people will host some roundtables.
3178000	3180000	That's my hope. My hopes and dreams.
3180000	3183000	You certainly are signing me up for a bunch of stuff, Rob.
3183000	3184000	I'm kidding.
3184000	3186000	Hey now, you know what?
3186000	3194000	But the nice thing about the roundtable is that you don't necessarily have to launch a full podcast
3194000	3197000	if there's just one topic you want to talk about real quick.
3197000	3199000	Like if you want to just talk about...
3199000	3204000	We need to have a whole decompression on this new pinball table that was just announced.
3204000	3206000	Let's do a roundtable about it.
3206000	3209000	And then we can talk for an hour about it and get it out of our system.
3209000	3211000	So anyway.
3211000	3212000	I have luck.
3212000	3215000	Yes, there you go. That's what I like to hear. I have thoughts. Good, good.
3215000	3216000	Anyway.
3216000	3219000	As Joe and Hunter Matt says, kind of like an NPR segment.
3219000	3222000	Just need some smooth jazz and calm talking.
3222000	3226000	Bobby Blackwell says that Final Fantasy VII discussion we wanted to have.
3226000	3229000	Yeah, that never did happen. We might need to make that happen for sure.
3229000	3232000	And then as Joe and Hunter Matt says, it's like a mini cast on a specific topic.
3232000	3236000	Yes, except I do want to stress, it is not a podcast at this time.
3236000	3240000	That was a question I wasn't prepared for, funny enough, that came in when we were doing it live.
3240000	3249000	My original idea was to do it as VODs only on Twitch for subscribers that would then come out later on YouTube.
3249000	3254000	But Bobby kind of talked me into why do just VODs, why not just broadcast it live.
3254000	3256000	And I was like, alright, cool. We'll do it that way.
3256000	3259000	But we're not going to even set a regular date and time for that.
3259000	3262000	But you will be able to see them on Twitch.
3262000	3266000	If you're following here at VOG Network, we'll do those throughout the week.
3266000	3269000	Some weeks there will be none. Some weeks there will be three.
3269000	3271000	It just depends on what the news is like that particular week.
3271000	3276000	And then you can also follow us on YouTube at VOG Network.
3276000	3281000	And we'll be posting everything there and on our website over at vognetwork.com.
3281000	3285000	And yes, Bobby Blackwell says we'll announce ahead of time on Discord. Absolutely.
3285000	3289000	And we're not going to do any on top of other VOG programs like Anime Jam Session.
3289000	3293000	Yes, that is absolutely true as well. We're not going to tiptoe on other programming.
3294000	3298000	Alright, enough about that side project. I just wanted you all to check it out.
3298000	3302000	And you may not have known, VOG Network has a YouTube channel.
3302000	3305000	We have a lot of random ass videos on that channel.
3305000	3312000	And it's pretty cool. If you want to see Bobby showing off the rainbow road trick on a Tesla, there's a video about it.
3312000	3318000	If you want to see Shane and I reviewing the Mass Effect ride like five years ago at Great America, there's a video on that.
3318000	3322000	So, enjoy. There's a lot of random shit on YouTube. You may not even be there.
3322000	3327000	So, alright. Let's move on. More gaming news. It was a busy news week, right, Loki?
3327000	3333000	Yes. So, there was lots of showcases this week. So, we already talked about PlayStation.
3333000	3339000	So, let's talk about Nintendo again. So, Nintendo's got some pretty cool stuff.
3339000	3343000	They did their partner showcase. They've done like three or four of those already this year, I think.
3343000	3353000	So, they talked a little bit about a new Monster Hunter game coming to the Switch, Monster Hunter Rise.
3353000	3357000	And that's going to be coming out March 26, 2021.
3357000	3363000	They also announced that there's going to be a Monster Hunter Stories 2 Wings of Ruin.
3363000	3369000	And that one is going to be kind of like a cel-shaded type of game.
3369000	3376000	And apparently, it is similar to the one that came out on the 3DS in 2017. So, it's kind of interesting.
3376000	3385000	Fitness Boxing 2, Rhythm and Exercise. Definitely a popular subject, especially with everyone being stuck inside from COVID.
3385000	3391000	So, fitness games could be pretty popular, I'd imagine. That's coming out December 4th.
3391000	3396000	Disgaea 6, Defiance of Destiny was announced as well.
3397000	3405000	Apparently, they even have a max level in the game of 100 million. So, that's great.
3405000	3409000	So, you definitely level up a lot there.
3409000	3418000	They've got a game that's a Chicago mob-themed tactical role-playing game called Empire of Sin.
3418000	3424000	And that's going to be coming out, looks like, December 1st, 2020.
3424000	3427000	Sniper Elite 4 is coming out this holiday.
3427000	3433000	The Long Dark is getting a Switch release, or did get a Switch release. It's out now.
3433000	3440000	Hades, which I knew was coming to the Switch, they announced that it was coming out this last week.
3440000	3444000	So, that came out as well after the little announcement there.
3444000	3451000	Balan Wonderland, of course, we knew that was coming to the PlayStation 4, maybe as Xbox.
3451000	3457000	One of those, they had the trailer on, but now it is also confirmed for the Switch on March 26th, 2021.
3457000	3462000	And it's also going to have co-op. That's that game that's done by the folks that did Knights into Dreams.
3462000	3464000	So, it should be pretty awesome.
3464000	3468000	Rune Factory 5 is going to be coming to the Switch at some point.
3468000	3475000	And then they finished it up with Ori and the Will of Wisps is getting a Switch release, which it came out that same day.
3475000	3483000	So, in the year 2020, Nintendo ended a Nintendo event with a Microsoft product.
3483000	3485000	It's interesting. Interesting. That's all.
3485000	3487000	Pretty sure they've done that before, though, with Minecraft.
3487000	3493000	No, they have. They have, but it's still one of those, you gotta see it to believe it type of things, right?
3493000	3498000	It's like playing Sonic on a Nintendo system. None of us were ready for it until it really happened.
3498000	3502000	I will say, though, out of all that, a lot of good stuff in there, really.
3502000	3505000	But I think a lot of attention on Hades having just come out.
3505000	3510000	I didn't pick it up on Switch. I have it on PC, though, and it is really good.
3510000	3514000	For a roguelike game, it's good, and it's got a neat little story to it.
3514000	3518000	So, I highly recommend that one. I think a lot of people are enjoying that for sure.
3518000	3522000	Dark Tetsuya in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says, my wife loves Hades.
3522000	3525000	Quest Buster says, I'm tempted to snag Hades on Steam.
3525000	3527000	Yeah, that's where I got it a few weeks ago.
3528000	3533000	After the first time they showed it in an earlier Partner Direct, I bought Hades on Steam.
3535000	3543000	Phoenix7726 in chat asks, kind of on a related note about roguelikes, have any of you played Spelunky 2?
3543000	3551000	Not yet, but I want to. I loved the first one, and so it's on my to-do list if I ever can clear this backlog.
3551000	3555000	It looks really exciting. What were your thoughts on it, Phoenix?
3556000	3564000	Well, wait. I'll get you those answers later, but for now, let's talk about the Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S,
3564000	3570000	because the pre-orders are happening for that, and we know exactly when and what time,
3570000	3574000	because obviously the PlayStation 5 had some issues with pre-ordering.
3574000	3580000	They've even kind of updated Twitter to talk about that, that, you know, oops, we realize this kind of could have been better.
3580000	3584000	So, Microsoft is doing it all on the same date and the same time.
3584000	3588000	I think overall that's probably a good thing, knowing the when is a good thing.
3588000	3598000	My one concern slash reservation is scalpers, because now that we all know exactly what day and time it's going to happen,
3598000	3601000	I'm worried scalpers are going to really be arming the front lines.
3601000	3607000	So, I really hope some of these retailers have thought of some new surprises to kind of shut down these bots
3607000	3611000	or make it really hard for them to do the scalpio.
3611000	3618000	I've heard that CAPTCHA codes don't really stop it. That's why the CAPTCHA chain, like, you don't type in codes anymore.
3618000	3628000	Now it's click everything that looks like a banana, you know, and then it's like, oops, I clicked a plantain, I gotta do it again.
3628000	3634000	It's still, if you change up, like, something, I mean, it's still harder for them to do it than without it.
3635000	3643000	Yeah. But anyway, the time and date to pre-order your Xbox X or S, or both if you want, is 8 a.m. Pacific,
3643000	3649000	and that's 11 a.m. Eastern Time on September 22nd, so that is coming up on Tuesday, so I know I'm going to be doing it.
3649000	3652000	We'll see how many others do it.
3652000	3661000	The retailers included Amazon, Target, Walmart, Best Buy, Costco, Sam's Club, GameStop, Newegg,
3661000	3667000	and also the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, kind of an interesting way to get the Xboxes around the world
3667000	3671000	to our men and women in the armed forces, so that's kind of interesting.
3671000	3675000	But all those, again, the list varies depending on your country.
3675000	3680000	I read the list here in the U.S., but obviously that list changes a bit depending on your country.
3680000	3684000	I think it's interesting Costco's on there. I feel like that's the one I'm going to try for,
3684000	3689000	because I feel like that's the one that'll have the least amount of people that realize you can pre-order an Xbox at Costco,
3689000	3695000	and I think me saying it here is not suddenly going to make a million more people realize that, but we'll see.
3695000	3699000	I probably am going to have two browsers open, one on the left screen, one on the right screen,
3699000	3705000	this one on Costco, this one on Amazon or something, and figure out where I can get it first, but we'll see.
3705000	3708000	We'll see. So yeah, check that out.
3708000	3715000	Again, the price, these consoles will be out November 10th, Xbox Series X, $499.99 retail,
3715000	3722000	Xbox Series X, $299.99 retail, and of course, again, I'm giving you information here in the States.
3722000	3727000	All right, Pod Culture says, I thought it was 11 a.m. Eastern, or 11 a.m. for you guys.
3727000	3731000	No, it is 8 a.m. for us on the West Coast in California, Oregon, Washington.
3731000	3735000	It is going to be 8 for us and 11 for you East Coasters.
3735000	3740000	Don't get the time wrong, or you'll be sad. All right.
3740000	3745000	DJ Rama S says, hitting Best Buy for mine, them reward zone points, yo.
3745000	3751000	And Pod Culture says what Rama said, I don't blame you, but I do want to caution you.
3751000	3759000	The complaints I saw about PlayStation 5 were a lot about their site and the timing out and all that stuff,
3759000	3763000	so I completely understand your reasoning, and I'm not going to tell you where to buy your stuff,
3763000	3769000	but just be forewarned. You may run into some ever-spinning clock pages and things like that,
3769000	3771000	but hopefully they'll be ready for it.
3771000	3773000	I'll put all of the pages all at once. All of them.
3773000	3775000	Yeah, hopefully they'll be a little more ready for it.
3775000	3779000	I mean, maybe that was a problem with the PlayStation 5 is that it kind of just happened,
3779000	3787000	so maybe Best Buy will have some backups or something, I don't know, whatever they need to do to make it work.
3787000	3791000	All right, Pod Culture says I'll have Amazon open as well, so it sounds like I'm not the only one
3791000	3794000	that's going to kind of be doing two shops at the same time, so we'll see.
3794000	3796000	All right, let's move on. We have more news.
3796000	3798000	Dark Sakura.
3801000	3804000	Dark Sakura, I believe you're muted, so you'll have to go back to the beginning.
3804000	3805000	Well, shit.
3805000	3806000	It happens.
3806000	3811000	There's a game series that a lot of people are very fond of. Some people in my family are.
3811000	3814000	Rayman. How many folks in chat like Rayman?
3814000	3818000	Because I thought it's always been a really neat game, a very pretty game,
3818000	3826000	but the creator of Rayman, Michel Ancel, has decided to quit video games
3826000	3832000	and is going to go to work on a wildlife sanctuary.
3832000	3836000	He's leaving the industry to do it full time.
3836000	3842000	I mean, this is also the person who has brought us Rabbids and Beyond Good and Evil.
3842000	3852000	He did confirm that the current projects active Beyond Good and Evil 2 and Wild would continue without him.
3852000	3857000	He has said, and actually I'll just read part of the quote on here.
3857000	3862000	Today is very special for me. After more than 30 years, I've decided to stop working on video games
3862000	3865000	and fully focus on my second passion, wildlife.
3865000	3870000	My new project takes place in the real world and consists in the wildlife open sanctuary
3870000	3875000	dedicated to education, nature lovers and wild animals.
3875000	3879000	Many of you might want to know what will happen to Wild and BGE2.
3879000	3885000	No worries. Since many months now, the teams are autonomous and the projects are going super well.
3885000	3889000	Beautiful things to be seen soon. May the fox be with you.
3889000	3894000	So, yeah, he had been with Ubisoft.
3895000	3902000	He had worked on, I mean, basically just so, you know, those big three series are well loved.
3902000	3903000	Yeah.
3903000	3915000	And, you know, he announced Wild back at Games Con 2014, which is an open world where you play as, you know, animals.
3915000	3925000	And I guess maybe that might have been sort of a hint that he's really looking more toward working with the real thing.
3925000	3933000	And Ubisoft did confirm the details of the Wildlife Sanctuary project and wished him well.
3933000	3938000	And I'll be honest, I'm really looking forward to see what he does with his wildlife sanctuary.
3938000	3948000	It's Montpellier, France, and I wish him the best with it myself. I think it's a noble cause.
3948000	3952000	Yeah. You know what? Good for him. Like, I know it's a big loss for the gaming industry.
3952000	3957000	This is adjacent to like if Miyamoto ever left Nintendo, heaven forbid.
3957000	3960000	But this is, you know, like that for Ubisoft.
3960000	3964000	You know, we're losing a very big creative force behind many of these games.
3964000	3974000	But at the same time, like, you know, he wants to take a lot of this money that he's earned doing these different projects and now focus on something else that's near and dear to his heart for a little while.
3974000	3978000	And it's kind of hard to be upset about that. It's a good thing.
3978000	3982000	Don't worry to tell someone what to do with their life unless they're, you know, a bigot.
3982000	3983000	Exactly.
3983000	3985000	Don't worry to tell them what to do with their life.
3985000	3993000	Looking in chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network, Quest Buster says, I'm relieved that this departure from Ubisoft was not because of a scandal.
3993000	3995000	Sad but true. Sad but true.
3995000	3997000	Too many of that.
3997000	4002000	S2100 Matt points out John Stewart did the same thing after he left The Daily Show.
4002000	4006000	That's true. You know, sometimes, you know, John Stewart probably could have got another TV show if he wanted.
4007000	4012000	But obviously he's been working a lot with the 9-11 firefighters, if I remember right. Right.
4012000	4020000	And the folks that were losing medical coverage happening to all those people with the fund being drained by, you know, the tyrant.
4020000	4025000	Yeah. So I think that's really cool. You know, he could have done another show if he wanted to.
4025000	4029000	But he's doing this other thing that he wants as well.
4029000	4034000	Bobby Blackoff is also pointing out he has an animal sanctuary in New Jersey that John Stewart works with.
4034000	4036000	So that's pretty cool.
4036000	4045000	And Dark Tetsuya says, I'm always sad whenever Ubisoft does an E3 thing because I always am hoping there'll be a new Rayman sequel.
4045000	4052000	Well, that doesn't mean there won't be another Rayman. It's just it won't have, you know, the same creative minds behind it.
4052000	4058000	But that's okay. You know, not every Mario game has had Miyamoto's direct involvement either.
4058000	4060000	So it happens.
4060000	4068000	Anyway, let's see. One of the people who've left to do other things, Bill Gates and Microsoft. Right.
4068000	4075000	Many people still associate Bill Gates with Microsoft, but he's honestly had nothing to do with Microsoft for some time now.
4075000	4080000	And he does a lot. Him and his wife both do a lot of philanthropy.
4080000	4081000	And, you know, those.
4081000	4083000	Wozniak left Apple ages ago.
4083000	4087000	Yes. Another great example. Yeah. So. All right.
4087000	4089000	He's a pretty cool dude.
4089000	4091000	Oh, yeah. Was is was is a lot of fun to.
4091000	4093000	Why didn't they try to give him a TV show at some point?
4093000	4098000	Am I just confusing that one episode where Kathy Griffin went on a date with him?
4098000	4102000	I think you might be confusing when Kathy Griffin dated was.
4102000	4104000	Yeah, that was dated actually for a while.
4104000	4109000	Yeah, that was an episode or two of the My Life on the D list back in the day.
4109000	4112000	I didn't watch the D list. I just remember being in her stand up.
4112000	4113000	Yeah.
4113000	4117000	About him proving that you can get speeding tickets driving a Prius.
4117000	4122000	If I'm sorry, but Loki's face, if you podcasters listen, I could have seen it.
4122000	4126000	He just looked like mind blown, like what?
4126000	4129000	Kathy Griffin and the was. Yeah, that was a thing.
4129000	4131000	Look it up. It's such an unlikely pairing.
4131000	4133000	No, I mean, I but you know what?
4133000	4138000	That's the stuff in Hollywood that I love when the unlikely people get together.
4138000	4141000	That's awesome to me. So anyway. All right.
4141000	4146000	But it's like that kind of stuff. Like you think that like it's funny hearing stories like that,
4146000	4150000	where it just works really well, like these really unlikely couples.
4150000	4154000	Yeah, right. All right. Anyhow, let's move on. We have more stories.
4154000	4158000	Let's talk about this one, Loki, about EA.
4158000	4161000	Oh, yeah. Look it here. Here's something very unexpected.
4161000	4169000	It's it's EA, you know, killing off another studio. What?
4169000	4173000	Well, not really. Not really, Loki. Don't misrepresent it.
4173000	4178000	Oh, yes, it is. It's exactly the same, you know, so basically like like EA likes to do.
4178000	4183000	They like to purchase companies and then they like to destroy them eventually.
4183000	4192000	So EA origin was kind of pretty much dead anyways, aside from it being their platform for selling games.
4192000	4202000	Well, apparently now they're going to be retiring the origin name and just calling it the wonderful EA desktop app.
4202000	4207000	Wow. What a creative name. That's a creative creative name.
4207000	4214000	Way to weigh the EA that EA much, much like their sports games and stuff.
4214000	4220000	They've put the maximum amount of creativity and development into this brand new name.
4220000	4222000	You know, someone got paid for it, though.
4222000	4230000	It stands by, you know, and much like, you know, the current version of Madden or even the last year's version of Madden,
4230000	4236000	I'm sure we'll go into EA desktop app and see references to origin still.
4236000	4242000	So I can't wait to see that. But eventually, I don't know if they're going to change the name of their.
4242000	4248000	You know, they've already kind of changed their EA access service from origin access. So it makes sense.
4248000	4252000	Yeah. You know, and I think it's kind of a sign of where things are going.
4252000	4255000	And let's be real. Origin had problems from the beginning.
4255000	4263000	Origin had some serious problems in the beginning and had a reputation that it never really was able to shake, you know, origin.
4263000	4268000	And I would say I would dare to say origin really wasn't that bad later on.
4268000	4271000	And they gave away some free games and stuff. And it was it was an OK app to have.
4271000	4276000	And I keep saying, like, the whole thing's going away. It's not it's just a rebranding. Right.
4276000	4279000	But I kind of do feel like even if it's a rebranding,
4279000	4285000	it is also indicative of a shift from EA wanting to go to like the storefront
4285000	4291000	and the steam model that they were kind of going for with origin to that subscription model.
4291000	4298000	And I think that's why things have kind of changed and shifted to what they have,
4298000	4303000	because it's to bring origin closer to where EA really wants to be with EA access,
4303000	4307000	especially now that they have that tie in deal with Microsoft,
4307000	4312000	which is really just the first level of EA access, because, you know,
4312000	4317000	they're going to hope that some of the people they get through with Game Pass are going to be tempted to go a little higher with their EA.
4317000	4320000	That's that's the whole reason why the deals there in the first place,
4320000	4324000	because they're going to really want you to sign up for EA access as well.
4324000	4329000	Some wishful thinking. It's like I could get one hundred and twenty seven games more.
4329000	4333000	I think it's like one hundred seventy two. It's over one hundred games.
4333000	4336000	Or I could get Madden.
4336000	4342000	Now, I will say I do have to just symbolically pour one out for origin.
4342000	4348000	It does make me a little sad to see that name go away because origin is that thing,
4348000	4356000	that brand associated with the Richard Garriott games of the 80s and early 90s and notably the Ultima series.
4356000	4363000	Right now, obviously, origin, the desktop app was nothing to do with that, per se.
4363000	4367000	But it is where the name came from. And you could, you know, get Ultima.
4367000	4372000	I believe you could get like Ultima nine. I think that was one of their free giveaways at one point was Ultima.
4372000	4376000	Pagan was one of the games you could get on origin for free for a month or something like that.
4376000	4381000	So I do have to symbolically pour one out for that reason.
4381000	4385000	No one special. Seventy seven also points out Wing Commander was an origin title back in the day.
4385000	4393000	Yes, yes, yes. So it is it is a name in the gaming industry synonymous with a lot of great 80s and 90s games.
4393000	4397000	Y'all just might not realize it. So pretty cool. All right.
4397000	4401000	Interesting on the rebranding front, because a lot of people talking about plus.
4401000	4404000	And there was the comment that came up that said, I'm surprised.
4404000	4408000	Oh, Tiger class says, I'm surprised it didn't just go with a name such as EA plus,
4408000	4412000	because that's how a lot of services are doing these days, putting a plus next to the name.
4412000	4419000	And obviously, we all think about Disney Plus, but Tiger Claw does call out CBS All Access just announced in the last week or so.
4419000	4423000	They're going to be rebranding to Paramount Plus.
4423000	4430000	So that is where like Star Trek Discovery and stuff is going to be now is Paramount Plus not dead serious.
4430000	4441000	No, no, no, no. See, so this this joke is not going to this only resonates with me because none of you worked in the distribution industry.
4441000	4448000	But back when I used to work at a distribution company, Paramount Plus was the name of our incentive card that we got from Paramount.
4448000	4453000	They'd actually put money on it as like a credit card type thing that they kept loading with money if you did well.
4453000	4457000	So I think that's just kind of funny that they're using that name. Interesting.
4457000	4461000	Oh, that is OK. Oh, that's that's a clever little insight I wouldn't have known about. So that's cool.
4461000	4466000	I always associate Paramount. If you have seen the movie Clue from 1985.
4466000	4472000	And if you haven't, I highly suggest you put some time aside to watch Clue immediately.
4472000	4479000	You can watch it on an Xbox one or PlayStation through. Is it Pluto or is it the other one?
4479000	4484000	One of those free TV apps has Clue on it and you can watch Clue the movie and you need to do it.
4484000	4490000	If you've never seen the movie, it is a Pluto TV. I don't know if it's I feel like it's the other one or not.
4490000	4494000	Or you can just have Netflix on while you're gaming.
4494000	4501000	Yes, I think it's still on Netflix, too. But the reason why that movie comes to mind, the logo at the very beginning, it was a Paramount motion picture.
4501000	4504000	So you see the Paramount logo at the beginning. And of course, a lot of movies in the 80s.
4504000	4509000	Paramount was a huge and still is a huge studio, I think, from the front for movies.
4509000	4513000	So you see that logo in front of a lot of things. So yet to be thank you.
4513000	4518000	That's what I was trying to think of. I think it is actually on to be. So there it is.
4518000	4524000	Although Clue will probably move to Paramount Plus, I imagine, because it is a Paramount. It's part of that library.
4524000	4532000	But they're already, just since I am a CBS All Access subscriber, because I used to like Big Brother, but it's fucking impossible this season.
4532000	4537000	And I enjoy Star Trek a lot. And I'm not shilling for them, I promise.
4537000	4543000	But in the beginning, they didn't have a lot. They had the good fight and Star Trek and that's about it.
4543000	4548000	But they've been going back and now they're really trying to add stuff from Viacom's other stuff.
4548000	4555000	So they have a lot of MTV stuff now. They have VH1 now. They have all of Drag Race is there now.
4555000	4559000	So that's pretty cool. And I'm hoping when the new episodes air, they'll be on there too. So that'll be nice.
4559000	4563000	I'm still probably going to keep watching them through my Apple TV.
4563000	4568000	Well yeah, you'd probably get them uncensored there. I don't know if they'll be uncensored or I'm watching them.
4568000	4570000	I can get them uncensored.
4570000	4575000	Moving on, let's talk about another game expo that happened online this weekend.
4575000	4583000	It was the Game Devs of Color Expo. And the Game Devs of Color Expo happened over the weekend.
4583000	4587000	Of course, it was virtual because, you know, 2020, everything is virtual.
4587000	4595000	But what was getting a lot of attention was that they did a Game Devs of Color Expo Direct before the expo kind of happened.
4595000	4599000	So like, I think it was on Thursday, maybe Friday. Sorry, I forget exactly what day.
4599000	4609000	But they actually did some announcements, Nintendo style, of some great indie games that are going to be coming out soon that were part of what was featured at this Game Devs of Color Expo.
4609000	4616000	If you want to see all the games or you want to see the Direct, you can visit the website GameDevsofColorExpo.com.
4616000	4620000	But I do want to point out two of the ones that really caught my eye.
4620000	4624000	Breakpoint, which is a game that is releasing next week.
4624000	4641000	Breakpoint looks like Geometry Wars, it looks like a version of that, but which I'm sure the devs have heard 100 times.
4641000	4646000	But it does look unique because they've kind of brought like a sword and shield type of mechanic to it.
4646000	4648000	And the soundtrack is awesome.
4648000	4651000	Yeah, it is. So this was definitely a highlight.
4651000	4655000	And honestly, probably a game I'm going to get next week is Breakpoint.
4655000	4657000	So that was a cool one to see.
4657000	4659000	And then I liked this.
4659000	4662000	Jamie, I feel like this game would be up your alley as well.
4662000	4664000	Proto Corgi was the other game.
4664000	4665000	What?
4665000	4669000	It was a retro inspired shoot-em-up, but you are a dog.
4669000	4672000	You play as Bullet, a flying Corgi pup.
4672000	4679000	I get serious Parodius vibes from this game, but it's like a Corgi.
4679000	4683000	I like that it's firing like bark.
4683000	4685000	Yes!
4685000	4687000	Now here's something really cool, Dark Sakura.
4687000	4691000	There is a demo out for this game right now on Steam.
4691000	4694000	So you can, yep, so you can Corgi all the things.
4694000	4697000	Proto Corgi is the name of that game, so check that out.
4697000	4701000	You know what? I'm getting it right the fuck now.
4701000	4703000	There you go.
4703000	4705000	I keep forgetting that I'm not on my Mac,
4705000	4709000	so I'm trying to do Command Space to open Spotlight, to open my Steam,
4709000	4713000	and no PCs don't have that beautifulness.
4713000	4716000	Good life choice. Anyway, obviously the event,
4716000	4718000	technically I think it's still going on tonight,
4718000	4722000	but I imagine most people probably have missed it by this point.
4722000	4724000	However, you can still check out the Direct.
4724000	4727000	Obviously a lot of these demos are coming out on Steam.
4727000	4729000	And yeah, this is pretty cool.
4729000	4733000	I have to admit, this is the fifth annual,
4733000	4736000	and I feel like it might have come up on OLR again last year,
4736000	4739000	but I did not hear about this all five years,
4739000	4741000	so I'm glad that this is getting out there,
4741000	4743000	and this is something I hope someday I could check out in person.
4743000	4745000	It sounds really cool.
4745000	4747000	And a lot of great games.
4747000	4749000	What's that?
4749000	4751000	I changed my background to it.
4751000	4754000	Oh, Loki changed his background to Proto Corgi.
4754000	4756000	That's awesome. Love it.
4756000	4759000	I just downloaded it.
4759000	4761000	All right.
4761000	4762000	And Quest Buster saying,
4762000	4765000	Proto Corgi demo is only 77 megabytes.
4765000	4768000	Yes. Remember when games were a sensible size?
4768000	4770000	It looks wonderfully animated.
4770000	4774000	It's almost like a Paul Robinson type thing.
4774000	4777000	I would be surprised if he's the one that did that,
4777000	4779000	but I don't think it is.
4779000	4781000	Super cool.
4781000	4783000	So props to the folks showing off again.
4783000	4784000	And there's many more.
4784000	4786000	I could spend a three-hour show talking about everything there,
4786000	4788000	but those are just two where I was like,
4788000	4790000	I'm ordering that, I'm ordering that.
4790000	4792000	So those were them.
4792000	4793000	Fifth Dream in chat says,
4793000	4794000	waiting for the sequel.
4794000	4795000	Neo Corgi.
4795000	4796000	Yeah. Cool, cool.
4796000	4797000	All right.
4797000	4800000	Let's move on to, well, another story.
4800000	4801000	It's got to be talked about.
4801000	4803000	Dark Sakura.
4803000	4808000	So the TERF as in T-E-R-F.
4808000	4812000	As I put on the sidebar, Lady Voldemort.
4812000	4815000	No, I'm not going to, I'm not going to go with that.
4815000	4819000	She hasn't killed anybody yet, but.
4819000	4820000	Anyway.
4820000	4821000	Yet.
4821000	4822000	Yeah.
4822000	4829000	But she may end up being indirectly responsible for damaging the mental health of millions
4829000	4832000	of people who are fans of her work.
4832000	4841000	So she is not going to be involved in the latest Harry Potter game.
4841000	4842000	That's Hogwarts legacy.
4842000	4847000	That's supposed to come out on, you know, the next, next gen stuff.
4847000	4852000	But the thing that I need to emphasize a big ass,
4852000	4856000	but like a ceramics lot sitting on it size,
4856000	4864000	but is that she's still going to make money from sales of the game.
4864000	4870000	And she actually just put out a, you know,
4870000	4875000	there's a book out that she did under the pen named Robert Galbraith,
4875000	4883000	who is also the name of the American psychiatrist who pushed gay conversion therapy.
4883000	4892000	Where the there's a murderer who is a, quote, cross dresser.
4892000	4894000	By the way, who I also read.
4894000	4895000	Where's Haji?
4895000	4902000	So it's not just transphobic, but it's Islamophobic as well.
4902000	4910000	So I would strongly, strongly urge people do not give this book any money.
4910000	4912000	Do not give the game any money.
4912000	4915000	Do not give any of it any money.
4915000	4920000	You know, if I even posted this on Twitter, you know, you can be a fan of that universe
4920000	4924000	and not support her, not buy any more things.
4924000	4926000	You don't have to get rid of what you already own.
4926000	4929000	I mean, shit, I went through that with Jeffree Star.
4929000	4934000	You know, I bought all that makeup and then, oh, by the way, he's piece of shit.
4934000	4936000	So, but I didn't throw anything away.
4936000	4937000	I spent money on it.
4937000	4940000	You know, whether or not I throw it away or anything, he still had my fucking money.
4940000	4941000	Same with her.
4941000	4948000	You know, I, you know, I tell people that, you know, I would,
4948000	4952000	I would even say don't support people streaming it
4952000	4956000	because that's just going to encourage more people to purchase the game.
4956000	4964000	And I don't care how little involvement she has with the creation of this game.
4964000	4966000	She's made money from the license.
4966000	4971000	Do not add more because quite likely in these contracts,
4971000	4974000	she's also getting money from continuous profits.
4974000	4977000	Do not fucking buy the game.
4977000	4981000	And if I find out you do, I will teleport to your,
4981000	4987000	I will operate to your house and I don't know,
4987000	4989000	but I'll do some kind of curse that's nasty.
4989000	4993000	I have to, even though I don't necessarily disagree with you,
4993000	4996000	I have to present some popular counterpoints that are going on out there
4996000	5001000	because some would argue that if you are going to take such a hard line on that,
5001000	5005000	Jamie, that you should be inviting people to come to your house
5005000	5009000	and see if you have anything problematic in your house because you probably do.
5009000	5013000	That there are many companies, everything is problematic.
5013000	5015000	There are so many things out there.
5015000	5020000	But when you have something that's right now in front of you,
5020000	5028000	you know, you could get me on a tangent about actually how much veganism harms the environment
5028000	5035000	and how not eating honey harms bees, you know, but I digress.
5036000	5038000	You know, you do have to pick your battles.
5038000	5046000	And this is one that is, it's not just the damage that she's doing with her current work,
5046000	5048000	but it's a betrayal.
5048000	5050000	You know, there's another edge to it.
5050000	5051000	Betrayal is a really good word.
5051000	5052000	Yeah.
5052000	5058000	And it just sucks to see people in power use their power for such crappy things,
5058000	5060000	you know, and that's what's really frustrating.
5060000	5062000	And there's a lot, and the other counterpoint I wanted to bring up
5062000	5065000	because this is one where I was like, well, that's an interesting kind of like, you know,
5065000	5071000	is that for people that really feel like this universe is a part of their essence,
5071000	5074000	it is a part of their childhood, it is a part of them,
5074000	5079000	some people would say that, you know, maybe one way they can kind of rationalize,
5079000	5082000	okay, I'm going to do it, is that I'm going to buy the game,
5082000	5086000	but I'm going to give a sizable amount, either the same cost of the game
5086000	5091000	or at least some, if not more, than what her would get from the game.
5091000	5095000	I'm going to donate to a trans, pro-trans charity.
5095000	5097000	She's still going to get money.
5097000	5101000	It's still going to be money in her pocket.
5101000	5104000	Yeah, but how far to remove must we be from all this stuff?
5104000	5107000	Like, I'm not going to go like try to look at all the background information
5107000	5109000	for all the products I buy for everything.
5109000	5111000	I'm going to buy what I want to buy, honestly,
5111000	5113000	and I'm going to probably buy this game because it looks awesome,
5113000	5114000	my kids want to play it.
5114000	5116000	So, yeah, I get it.
5116000	5119000	I don't support what she says, I don't support that,
5119000	5121000	but your money does.
5121000	5124000	No, my money supports the developers of the game,
5124000	5127000	which then is licensing by Warner Brothers.
5127000	5130000	They have the rights to the actual movie series.
5130000	5134000	They're going to pay her that money regardless if that sells zero copies
5134000	5135000	or a million copies.
5135000	5137000	That money is already paid.
5137000	5141000	It's not already paid because in all of those contracts
5141000	5143000	she gets money for every copy sold.
5143000	5144000	Do you know that?
5144000	5146000	Have you actually looked at her contracts for those games?
5146000	5149000	I'm sorry, but like that's an assumption that you're making.
5149000	5150000	And you know what?
5150000	5151000	You can not support the game.
5151000	5152000	That's fine.
5152000	5156000	But like I'm not at a point here in my life where I just
5156000	5160000	am not going to go do all the background research for everything.
5160000	5162000	Like if that's the case, I'm not buying any more Ubisoft games
5162000	5165000	because I think every single game company out there is problematic.
5165000	5166000	OK.
5166000	5167000	Warner Brothers is problematic.
5167000	5168000	I mean, as it is.
5168000	5172000	So like, I can't, I can't just block myself off
5172000	5175000	because someone said something mean on the Internet or hurtful.
5175000	5176000	OK.
5176000	5177000	Or racist.
5177000	5180000	It's just you got to draw the line somewhere.
5180000	5181000	OK.
5181000	5182000	I don't know.
5182000	5185000	It's like the whole like Chick-fil-A and like not supporting them
5185000	5187000	either because they donate stuff.
5187000	5188000	Let me get.
5188000	5189000	OK.
5189000	5192000	I just want to get some comments from chat here.
5192000	5195000	Some important things here to say, as Joan Hunter-Matt says,
5195000	5197000	to be clear, Jamie is not wrong how she feels.
5197000	5198000	Oh, absolutely not.
5198000	5200000	And there's a lot of people that feel this.
5200000	5201000	Absolutely.
5201000	5202000	Absolutely.
5202000	5206000	But Bobby Blackwell points out Twitch is problematic.
5206000	5207000	Oh, God.
5207000	5208000	Yeah.
5208000	5209000	Remember that whole thing they did this week with the whole.
5209000	5210000	Exactly.
5210000	5212000	The emojis for the Latin.
5212000	5213000	I think it was.
5213000	5214000	And you'll have to excuse me.
5214000	5215000	I'm sorry.
5215000	5217000	I do not remember the official name of the event that they were doing.
5217000	5220000	I think it was like Latin Gaming Week or something.
5220000	5225000	But they were giving like allowing you to modify emojis with sombreros
5225000	5230000	and maracas, which if it is a Mexican pride event is probably fine.
5230000	5234000	Most Mexicans that I've talked to think that kind of stuff is cool,
5234000	5240000	but not when it's all of Latin America, which would be a lot larger than just Mexico.
5240000	5244000	Obviously, that was a problematic thing that Twitch did.
5244000	5248000	Bobby Blackwell says Dragon Con was co-founded by a child molester.
5248000	5249000	I still went.
5249000	5250000	Yeah, that went.
5250000	5252000	That was yikes.
5252000	5257000	Thank God they divorced from him and they finally played some legal chess to do that.
5257000	5260000	As Joe and Matt says, keep in mind, a lot of people worked on this game.
5260000	5262000	People who likely do not agree with her views.
5262000	5265000	These people's careers and development are at stake for this game.
5265000	5272000	And a perfect example of a game that has also very problematic.
5272000	5273000	Minecraft.
5273000	5276000	Notch has said some very terrible things.
5276000	5277000	Oh, God.
5277000	5278000	Oh, he's.
5278000	5283000	The opinions that I want on this are from our trans listeners.
5283000	5284000	Okay.
5284000	5290000	If anybody out there is willing to speak up and chat, I would definitely love to hear it.
5290000	5295000	So and I, you know, again, nobody is wrong in the way they feel.
5295000	5298000	And I think everybody kind of has to evaluate this.
5298000	5307000	And I think one thing we can do and luckily we are doing and I think we need to continue to do on social media is kind of present the facts.
5307000	5315000	You know, did you know she is a problem and she has these views that are hurtful.
5315000	5325000	They're hurting people, especially people that were so in love with this universe, only to find out that, you know, the author behind it doesn't support them as people.
5325000	5326000	That's horrible.
5326000	5332000	At least you can educate people with this information so they can make a decision on what they want to do.
5332000	5335000	And I can still judge people for doing it.
5335000	5345000	I'm sorry, it's as someone who is on that spectrum and I will not elaborate anymore because it's nobody else's business.
5345000	5360000	It, it, it feels like a bigger stab in the heart, you know, and I in you know maybe it is a bit more emotional for me, but I don't.
5360000	5368000	I can't see how it would be right to do anything that's that further supports her work.
5368000	5375000	Okay, and I think we'll leave it at that for now. So let's because, you know, we want to let make sure every gamer has a voice, the voices are out there.
5375000	5379000	Now you have an opportunity to figure out what you want to do.
5379000	5385000	All right, let's move on and talk about social media of sorts of sorts. Right, Loki?
5385000	5389000	Speaking of another problematic company, Facebook.
5389000	5396000	So Facebook Connect, they talked about the new things coming toward or in the Oculus brand.
5396000	5403000	So, of course, the Oculus Quest 2 was announced and, you know, the different games coming to that as well.
5403000	5406000	So, of course, with that, some announcements that were made.
5406000	5413000	They're going to be bringing Star Wars Tales from the Galaxy's Edge, which is from the same developers who did Vader Immortal.
5413000	5416000	So that's pretty awesome. So wish I had played the original.
5416000	5420000	Jurassic World Aftermath, Medal of Honor, above and beyond.
5420000	5425000	Population one, Beat Saber is getting me getting multiplayer as well.
5425000	5426000	So that's kind of cool.
5426000	5429000	Myst, getting, I guess, another VR.
5429000	5434000	I thought they already had a VR version for Myst, but I guess maybe it's now coming to the Quest 2.
5434000	5442000	The Climb 2, Warhammer 40,000 Battle Sister, Pistol Whip 2089, and The Walking Dead Saints and Sinners.
5443000	5450000	So apparently the new, I'm not sure when the Quest 2 is supposed to be out.
5450000	5453000	I'm imagining probably relatively soon.
5453000	5456000	And then, of course, you know, a bit of warning.
5456000	5462000	Starting in October, new Oculus users will have to link their account or they will need a Facebook account.
5462000	5475000	And also existing accounts, existing Oculus accounts will have to be linked to a Facebook account starting January 1st, 2023 to get full functionality.
5475000	5477000	So that's the only thing that sucks there.
5477000	5484000	Otherwise, you know, I have a Rift and, you know, I like my Rift desk, but yeah, I don't know.
5484000	5491000	Facebook, I really wish there was a reason why they were doing that, aside from just spying on people.
5491000	5496000	Yeah, I mean, I have no plans to ever buy an Oculus product, so that's that.
5496000	5499000	And maybe this kind of goes back to the other conversation.
5499000	5500000	I don't know.
5500000	5507000	But just, you know, for me, I'm not loving the idea of that being tied to Facebook accounts and I don't have a Facebook account anymore.
5507000	5509000	So and I'm not getting one.
5509000	5510000	So, yeah.
5510000	5514000	Well, I should clarify, I am still on Messenger and Instagram.
5514000	5517000	However, I don't see myself doing that long term.
5517000	5524000	It is something that has to slowly wean from while I find replacements for things like Messenger, that's for sure.
5524000	5525000	So, all right.
5525000	5526000	Yeah.
5526000	5540000	Well, speaking of things that are ending, we have to talk about the 3DS, because this week it was announced that Nintendo is going to officially be ending Nintendo 3DS production.
5540000	5543000	The official Japanese page for the Nintendo 3DS.
5543000	5549000	And of course, that would also mean the 2DS is going to be involved, because that's kind of where 3DS ended up in its later years.
5549000	5550000	Right.
5550000	5559000	So and then in a statement to Kotaku, Nintendo of America did confirm that the 3DS handhelds are no more, saying in a statement, quote,
5559000	5564000	we can confirm that the manufacturing of the Nintendo 3DS family of systems has ended.
5564000	5573000	Nintendo and third party games for the Nintendo 3DS family of systems will continue to be available in the Nintendo eShop on Nintendo.com and at retail.
5573000	5582000	The existing library of more than 1000 Nintendo 3DS games contains many critically acclaimed titles and can provide years of content to explore and enjoy.
5582000	5588000	So, yeah, basically they're saying, you know, yes, we're no longer going to be making the hardware,
5588000	5594000	but it's not like we are suddenly going to come to your house and take all your 3DS away from you.
5594000	5598000	That is very much not the case and not something they would be capable of doing.
5598000	5604000	However, even though they kind of talk about that things could be available, like digitally and things like that,
5604000	5610000	I'm not sure that would mean that the 3DS store is still going, if I remember right.
5610000	5613000	Right. You still have the option to use the 3DS store.
5613000	5614000	Right.
5614000	5617000	Plus, they still have like codes out there that you can buy or retail.
5617000	5619000	They still sell 3DS games at retail.
5619000	5620000	Yeah.
5620000	5623000	Still full price because I looked.
5623000	5629000	In fact, I actually just picked up my son, the Paper Mario sticker star,
5629000	5636000	because he's getting close to finishing Paper Mario and the Origami King and I thought he'd want another one to play.
5636000	5639000	So I got that for him as well.
5639000	5642000	But yeah, a lot of those games are still full price.
5642000	5646000	I'll wait until Black Friday and that kind of time frame when they mark those down again.
5646000	5648000	But yikes.
5648000	5655000	I'm surprised like this far after that stuff has come out, especially like the latest, like last Pokemon games on 3DS.
5655000	5657000	They're still thirty nine ninety nine.
5657000	5659000	It's ridiculous at this point.
5659000	5663000	And the last official Nintendo first party game for that was the Kirby Robobot.
5663000	5665000	Right. Was the last thing they actually did.
5665000	5667000	I think so.
5667000	5668000	I don't remember.
5668000	5670000	I feel like that was a couple of years ago at this point.
5670000	5675000	But I was going to say with the store, the store is still available for now.
5675000	5681000	But I have to be honest, how long until that ends up going away as well?
5681000	5683000	I mean, the Nintendo like the Wii.
5683000	5685000	Yeah, exactly. Just like the Wii.
5685000	5686000	And we've seen this happen before.
5686000	5691000	I think it's probably a matter of time before the 3DS shop probably gets pulled, too.
5691000	5693000	I don't want to panic anybody.
5693000	5697000	But if you do have titles you're looking at getting and you want to get them electronically,
5697000	5700000	you might want to think about budgeting for those in the next year.
5700000	5704000	You probably still have at least a good year of life left in that shop.
5704000	5707000	But that probably will be the beginning of the end.
5707000	5713000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Me-topia and Radiant Historia were the last two 3DS games I played.
5713000	5715000	Act Def says WarioWare Gold.
5715000	5717000	I think that was the last one.
5717000	5722000	Phoenix 77 26 talks about Shovel Knight also got the final update as well.
5722000	5727000	This is why it might also be a good idea to, I don't know, root your DS and back up your games.
5727000	5732000	Tiger Claw says I could see Nintendo porting some 3DS games to the Switch in the future.
5732000	5738000	You know, I kind of hope that's where some of this ends up because after all, if you just tilt a Switch vertically,
5738000	5745000	you can probably get a very similar real estate on a vertical screen that you would get on a 3DS or a 2DS.
5745000	5748000	I mean, you might have a little bit of cropping, but.
5748000	5754000	I'm still surprised we're in the middle of September and they haven't announced any big changes to Nintendo online.
5754000	5761000	It's just, you know, before they were like, oh, yeah, this year in the Super Nintendo collection or whatever,
5761000	5764000	before the NES collection, there's like no new collections or anything.
5764000	5766000	It's just I get what you mean.
5766000	5769000	I was gonna say we have a minor update later in the show, but I see what you mean.
5769000	5772000	Like a whole new like a Game Boy collection or something.
5772000	5773000	I get it. I get it.
5773000	5775000	Game Boy or something.
5775000	5778000	Like, I'm surprised that they haven't done anything.
5778000	5781000	Well, don't speak too soon.
5781000	5784000	You never know what might be coming. Fingers and toes crossed.
5784000	5787000	Maybe the whole 2020 stuff pushed things back.
5787000	5789000	I know I'm not going to hold my breath either.
5789000	5791000	I'm not going to hold my breath, but well, I mean, it will be it.
5791000	5796000	Let's let it be a nice surprise if we were to suddenly get a Game Boy Advance, you know, library,
5796000	5799000	which I would love a Game Boy Advance library myself.
5799000	5804000	But there's a lot of things I think will be really cool and lend itself well to the system.
5804000	5811000	Anyway, let's go back to a classic time when these games are still alive in our hearts.
5811000	5813000	You know what? You can't take that away from me.
5813000	5815000	My memories and all of that of these games.
5815000	5818000	It's the classic game of the week.
5818000	5822000	And every week Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault to find a game that she thinks,
5822000	5826000	hey, you guys should be playing this game right now.
5826000	5827000	It's the classic game of the week.
5827000	5831000	Dark Sakura, what did you pick for the classic game of the week?
5831000	5835000	I have chosen Cannon's Bike.
5835000	5840000	And the reason being is because I'm on a Dreamcast kick.
5840000	5845000	So I mean, we should all always be on a Dreamcast kick.
5845000	5853000	Well, I mean, the Dreamcast is I mean, it was a pretty amazing little system, you know.
5854000	5863000	The great thing about it is that you had so many direct arcade games that came over on the Dreamcast.
5863000	5868000	And Cannon's Bike is one of them, or as it was known in Japan, Gun's Bike.
5868000	5873000	But at any rate, it is a multi-directional shooter game.
5873000	5883000	And it was released in 2000 by Psycho and later came out in the same year on the Dreamcast and was released by Capcom.
5883000	5886000	It ran on the NAOMI hardware.
5886000	5889000	And remember, it's not NAOMI, it's NAOMI.
5889000	5892000	Same with me, NAOMI.
5892000	5900000	And it is kind of like Commando and Smash TV, although the focus is boss fighting, you know.
5900000	5906000	But at any rate, it is the last game released for the Dreamcast in Europe.
5906000	5911000	It was published by Big Ben Interactive and sold at Game exclusively.
5913000	5917000	So at any rate, you have different playable characters.
5917000	5922000	Although, you know, the game Cannon's Bike was named after one of Cammy's moves.
5922000	5925000	And Cammy is in the game.
5925000	5929000	But you also have Arthur from Ghosts and Goblins or Ghouls and Ghosts.
5929000	5936000	You have Boleta as she was in Japan or Baby Bonnie Hood from Darkstalkers as a hidden character.
5936000	5942000	You have Charlie or Nash as he was in Japan from Street Fighter Alpha.
5942000	5945000	You had Rockman or Mega Man.
5945000	5954000	And then you had Shiba Shintaro from Three Wonders, which I have also done as a classic game before.
5954000	5956000	So there you go.
5956000	5962000	You also have another character who is made for the game.
5962000	5974000	Simone, who actually has a lot similar with Lin Kurosawa from Alien vs. Predator, the arcade beat-em-up.
5974000	5988000	And then as an enemy character, you have Vega, who was known as Balrog in Japan, the bullfighter guy.
5988000	5996000	At any rate, you know, Cannon's Bike had an interesting reception to it.
5996000	5999000	It was very well received in Japan.
6000000	6004000	It was considered by a game machine.
6004000	6008000	It was listed to be the second most successful arcade game of the year.
6008000	6016000	And in the US, it pretty much got average ratings.
6016000	6019000	Hamitsu gave it a 30 out of 40.
6019000	6022000	Game Informer said it was average.
6022000	6025000	Metacritic really rates it as average.
6025000	6028000	But it is one of those little neat games.
6028000	6032000	I personally thought it was really a lot of fun, you know.
6032000	6038000	And the crossover for other Capcom games was always a fun little addition to it.
6038000	6042000	You know, I always thought it was a little bit of fun.
6042000	6048000	It's kind of one of those not super appreciated and not very, I'd say, well-remembered games.
6048000	6052000	But it did get some good ratings from some other resources.
6052000	6058000	It got an 8.8 from IGN.
6058000	6063000	It got an 88% from GameFan.
6063000	6070000	You know, like I said, a 30% from Hamitsu, which Hamitsu is notoriously stingy in their reviews.
6070000	6073000	But, you know, it was a fun one.
6073000	6080000	You know, if you haven't checked it out, you might enjoy it if you have a Dreamcast or a Dreamcast emulator or something.
6080000	6086000	But Cannon Spike was just, I think it really fell under the radar for a lot of people.
6086000	6093000	And, you know, maybe I'll hook up my Dreamcast and see if I can stream it or something because I have a copy.
6093000	6096000	I haven't played it in a while.
6096000	6097000	Sorry, Jamie, I'm going to be honest.
6097000	6100000	I did not know this game before you picked it.
6100000	6101000	What?
6101000	6102000	I did not.
6102000	6104000	And you know what, in looking at chat, I'm not alone.
6104000	6107000	Pixel Pacas, who I know follows games very closely.
6107000	6109000	Cannon Spike looks like great fun.
6109000	6111000	I've never seen it before.
6111000	6118000	Black Come Pat, who I know has been podcasting nearly as long as we have, says this is one I'm not familiar with.
6118000	6119000	We'll have to check it out.
6119000	6124000	Yeah, I mean, when you talk about this game fell under the radar, girl, you're right.
6124000	6127000	That's an underestimation.
6127000	6134000	I think it's really neat that Charlie and Cami and some familiar faces are in it.
6134000	6139000	Maybe somebody showed this to me for a hot minute in college, but I do not remember it.
6139000	6142000	But that's the point of the segment.
6142000	6147000	Well, you know what, Rob, I think you should come over someday when you're feeling safe.
6147000	6148000	Yeah.
6148000	6153000	And we should just hook up the Dreamcast and just stream random Dreamcast shit.
6153000	6154000	We really should.
6154000	6156000	I would really love that.
6156000	6162000	I did risky behavior today because I was on a film set.
6162000	6167000	Everything was protocol followed, but, you know, but maybe in a week or two.
6167000	6170000	Yeah, I'd love to do that.
6170000	6182000	Yeah, but I mean, and the other thing, too, as you can see in the long play that we have going on right now is you have all kinds of different scenarios and scenes as well.
6182000	6195000	Like if my timing is right, looking at this, like we're on a Ghouls and Ghosts themed level, you know, with zombies in the undead and delightful little horrors.
6195000	6205000	But, you know, the questmaster actually put something in chat that I wasn't too aware of because I just thought, you know, this game would be kind of like cheat pile.
6205000	6211000	But apparently it's sought after by collectors and go to copy.
6211000	6214000	So, gosh, maybe I should sell it.
6214000	6215000	I'm kidding.
6215000	6216000	I'm kidding.
6216000	6217000	Kidding.
6217000	6218000	You know, you know what?
6218000	6223000	I just found out that I was looking up Guardian Legend for getting the album art.
6223000	6231000	And apparently, like there's copies of it selling now for for the Bucks and I have mine in the box.
6231000	6236000	But I mean, but this it's just a delightful little piece of fun.
6236000	6239000	You know that that's all I can say about it, you know?
6239000	6249000	And I'll be honest, I truly am surprised that people, at least listeners of our show, haven't haven't heard of it.
6249000	6252000	And I'm not saying that in a judgmental kind of way.
6252000	6256000	Trust me, I will judge you for far many other things than just hearing of this game.
6256000	6257000	Right.
6257000	6265000	But the game, you know, I kind of thought that a lot of people had heard of it, you know, especially with as many Dreamcast aficionados as I know.
6265000	6270000	Well, that's the beautiful thing about this segment is, you know, hey, remember this?
6270000	6274000	And sometimes the answer is going to be, actually, I don't remember this.
6274000	6275000	Yeah.
6275000	6284000	Well, well, then, you know, if if you can find a copy or a way to play it, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, say no more.
6284000	6286000	Not in that manner, though.
6286000	6287000	Give it a try.
6287000	6289000	You know, pretty, pretty fun.
6289000	6290000	Pretty cute.
6290000	6291000	I think I will.
6291000	6294000	Well, three hundred bucks for that really orange.
6294000	6295000	Right.
6295000	6296000	Oh, hey.
6296000	6298000	And you know what?
6298000	6300000	Take a look at your own collections.
6300000	6306000	You never know what you're going to have that'll, you know, pay a quarter of your mortgage one month.
6306000	6307000	Right.
6307000	6308000	No kidding.
6308000	6313000	I think I still have a black stripe Final Fantasy seven somewhere.
6313000	6318000	You know, what's funny about that is that we had loaned mine to somebody and they never gave it back.
6318000	6324000	And then I bought the release of it and then we got another another one.
6324000	6326000	And now I have a Japanese one.
6326000	6327000	Oh, wow.
6327000	6329000	Yeah, I have a black stripe symphony of the night somewhere, too.
6329000	6330000	So it's just.
6330000	6333000	Oh, well, yeah, we know, you know, of course.
6333000	6339000	We also have the Japanese special edition that came with the art book and the music CD and all of that.
6339000	6344000	And I think, you know, this whole little talk about, you know, what you never know in your collection, what's worth.
6345000	6350000	I think that's why some of us and maybe again, this is gamers of a certain age and this is my get off my lawn moment.
6350000	6359000	But I think that's why there's some of us that are a little slower to move to digital, because we do still see a lot of that value in physical stuff.
6359000	6363000	Not to say, you know, folks in the younger generation don't see the value in that.
6363000	6364000	You know what I mean?
6364000	6373000	But it's just kind of one of those like, gosh, you know, like when I do everything digital, I don't have that cool little thing in my collection that I never knew was rare.
6373000	6377000	You know, but I guess at the same time, I'm saying all that.
6377000	6384000	But yet you have companies like Limited Run Games, where the whole point is to make collectibles, you know, of video gaming.
6384000	6388000	So not everything is digital, I suppose.
6388000	6390000	Anyway, there it is.
6390000	6393000	Well, I was also go ahead.
6393000	6401000	Sorry. Well, I was also going to say, you know, on the same token, I know that the games are going to take up some space, though.
6401000	6404000	But, you know, set yourself a dedicated area for it.
6404000	6412000	If you can't collect, you know, have big, massive collections, then pick something that you love and hold on to that.
6412000	6415000	You know, if you're super excited, I'm just going to throw this out there.
6415000	6422000	Say that you love every Final Fantasy game and that's your big love, then definitely get hard copies of everything.
6422000	6424000	You know, that is your collection.
6424000	6429000	You don't have to have a whole room dedicated to it.
6430000	6435000	But you don't necessarily have to not have a room dedicated to it.
6435000	6437000	It's OK if you do.
6437000	6443000	I mean, thankfully Dan's office needs are a lot more minimal than mine.
6443000	6452000	But yeah, his office is in the game room, although now we have two CRTs hooked up and, you know, we still have the Saturn hooked up.
6452000	6456000	The vault is coming along.
6456000	6458000	It's getting some new life.
6458000	6460000	But anyway, Canon Spike.
6460000	6463000	Yes, there it is. Your classic game of the week, Canon Spike. There it is.
6463000	6465000	All right.
6465000	6471000	Speaking of collectibles and collections growing out of hand, do you know what my fucking husband did today?
6471000	6473000	Oh, do tell, do tell.
6473000	6477000	So he had to go to Costco because our Keurig machine finally went kaput.
6477000	6480000	So he was like, all right, I'll get a new one from Costco or whatever.
6480000	6486000	And he sends me a picture in Costco of a super Pac-Man arcade one up machine.
6486000	6491000	And it just says, you know, husband with a super Pac-Man arcade one up machine.
6491000	6495000	And I'm like, OK, you're open. You're opening a door.
6495000	6497000	You do not want to fucking open.
6497000	6500000	Number one, I am telling Dan right now, super Pac-Man.
6500000	6502000	It's a dark soccer.
6502000	6506000	I looked for it online and I couldn't figure out why am I not finding a super Pac-Man online?
6506000	6510000	Super Pac-Man arcade one up is a Costco exclusive.
6510000	6513000	That's why he saw it there.
6513000	6516000	So, yeah, right.
6516000	6522000	So he sent me that picture and I'm like, that is a fucking door you don't want to open.
6522000	6530000	Like, if you tease me with that, we're going to have one of those and you're going to be mad because that's going to come out of the house fund.
6530000	6532000	And that's just that much longer.
6532000	6540000	Listen, this is why we don't have an Xbox Series X is because now I have all of these arcade games behind me.
6540000	6544000	Oh, no. Oh, no, I'd have both.
6544000	6547000	Well, girl, you've seen my house.
6547000	6557000	I know we actually are trying to decide, like we need to get rid of four pins so that our house can kind of go back to normal.
6557000	6568000	Although Dan needs to fix the Mustang and put it somewhere, you know, so we're making some pretty tough decisions about about all that stuff.
6568000	6582000	Yeah, no. And I you know, I and I'm saying this all in good fun because obviously I think it's great that he he finds those things that like triggers my, you know, wallet need to spend money type of thing and taunts me with it.
6582000	6591000	And who knows? Someday, I mean, once we do get past the house stuff, if there's still money left over, I would love nothing more than to fill up the fucking house with more arcade one up cabinets.
6591000	6595000	And you better believe Super Pac-Man towards the top of my list.
6595000	6598000	That's easily in like my top five machines I'd like to have.
6598000	6601000	Looking what Bobby said just now.
6601000	6604000	Yeah, you know what it is, Bobby? Bobby, it's a clone.
6604000	6609000	I believe you might fact check me on this, please. I'm inviting Bobby Black Wolf to check fact check me.
6609000	6618000	It doesn't happen often. I believe it is the same lineup as the 40th anniversary Pac-Man that is being sold on the official website.
6618000	6630000	But they have flipped the arcade art and the cabinet art to be Super Pac-Man as opposed to the wood grain Pac-Man because there already is a Pac-Man one up cabinet, but it has less gains.
6630000	6635000	And I think it's just a plain black cabinet. But the 40th anniversary is like a wood grain thing.
6635000	6640000	And it does look nice, but I believe this isn't reskinned one of those, but it's Super Pac-Man skin.
6640000	6643000	Well, I did tell Dan, so we'll see what happens.
6643000	6648000	And the same thing with NBA Jam. They did a championship edition that was in Costco.
6648000	6651000	Yeah, he sent me a picture of that one, too. And it looks good.
6651000	6659000	If I if I had I would love NBA Jam, but there's you have to draw the fucking line.
6660000	6670000	And yeah, Bobby points out and this is important. It's not just Pac-Man. It also has Galaga, Galaxian and Dig Dug. And those games are fucking awesome, too.
6670000	6676000	Really? So it's OK. I'm I'm glad I had Bobby fact check me. I am wrong. It is not a reskin.
6676000	6684000	The 40th anniversary does not have Galaxian and Dig Dug. It instead has Pac and Pal.
6684000	6689000	And. Which is terrible. Pac-Man Plus, which is also terrible.
6689000	6693000	That Super Pac-Man machine is way better as far as the game lineup goes.
6693000	6697000	It really depends on if you have to have the aesthetic of the wood grain cabinet or not, I think.
6697000	6706000	So for me, again, you make your own damn opinion when it comes to what you're going to spend 400, 500 bucks on, however much these arcade cabinets are.
6706000	6714000	I wonder how much was it? Did he tell me? I got to find out. Sorry, guys, this is excellent live radio.
6714000	6719000	I believe it was four ninety nine. I could be wrong, but let's see on a three ninety nine.
6719000	6723000	Sorry, he said three ninety nine is the price. Maybe we won't get that.
6723000	6729000	Yeah, but I'm I'm wait, wait, wait for those price drops. I hope so. I hope so.
6729000	6732000	All right. Anyway, let's move on from talking about those machines.
6732000	6737000	Maybe, maybe we'll be talking about arcade one up machines again in our rapid fire news segment.
6737000	6742000	Wink, wink, nudge, nudge. Let's get into some rapid fire news we have tonight, starting with Loki.
6742000	6753000	Yes. So there is something that also preordered this week, and that was Mario Kart Live home circuit is one hundred dollars.
6753000	6757000	You got one, though. Congrats. One hundred dollars for each starter set.
6757000	6766000	Yeah. So it's one hundred dollars. You can either choose from Mario or Green Mario and it comes with the different.
6766000	6772000	Hold up, hold up, hold up. What? You can do Mario or Green Mario.
6772000	6775000	It's Luigi. That's Green Mario. It's a joke.
6775000	6781000	Oh, OK. So you can't agree. What is Nintendo calling it? Luigi? Was that your little joke?
6782000	6788000	OK. It was my joke. OK. Because I was about to go off. I was I was like, Jamie, hold my earrings.
6788000	6793000	I'm like, why would you not just do Luigi? OK. All right.
6793000	6797000	It's Mario and Luigi. Each one is is a hundred dollars.
6797000	6803000	You need a separate switch for each one in order to play two players. So, you know, that can happen.
6803000	6810000	But yeah, it comes with like it looks like a bunch of different checkpoint areas and then like some cardboard arrows as well.
6810000	6816000	The car and then a recharge, you know, like a charge cable. I think the software itself is actually going to be free to download.
6816000	6824000	So that's going to be a thing as well. But, yeah, since coming out October 16th.
6824000	6828000	All right. You know what? That's less than I thought it would be, especially when you look at the price of those Legos.
6828000	6834000	I totally thought it was going to be like 40 for the game and then like another likes like,
6834000	6839000	I guess I was about to say 60 for the car, which I guess is the same price. But somehow in my head I had it up to one hundred and twenty dollars.
6839000	6847000	I thought it was going to cost one hundred twenty. Yeah. So those.
6847000	6851000	Yeah, we have almost all of those sets, too. Yeah. Yeah, I know. Right.
6851000	6856000	So you should see we just put together one with King Boo on it today.
6856000	6861000	That was another thing the husband tried to tempt me with last time we were at Target was like, oh, look down this aisle.
6861000	6866000	They have those Nintendo Legos. Don't they look fun? Like, stop it. Stop it.
6866000	6871000	Aren't you? Aren't you? What you're supposed to do is you're supposed to make sure I don't see that.
6871000	6875000	I always supposed to say, oh, look over here at these other things.
6875000	6879000	All right. Anyway, let's see.
6879000	6885000	Bobby Black Wolf talking about collecting, saying I actually worked on the room that we're turning into our arcade this weekend.
6885000	6890000	It's the last storage room from when we moved in. Found some more gaming VHS tapes that I might want to digitize.
6890000	6894000	Maybe I can do a vogue stream playing old video game VHS promo tapes.
6894000	6899000	Pretty cool. All right. Anyway, sorry. Moving on. Rapid fire news. Sorry, Loki.
6899000	6909000	All right. And so aside from that, it looks like we have gotten news that way forward and Arc Systems are going to be bringing out a game based on Ruby,
6909000	6917000	which is, of course, the animation that's by Rooster Teeth and it's been out for quite a while now.
6917000	6924000	But yeah, so that sounds pretty awesome coming from those two and definitely the type of style of a game.
6924000	6929000	I could definitely see that from them. That's supposed to be coming out sometime 2021.
6929000	6935000	So hopefully we'll get some more information about that soon. All right.
6935000	6941000	Well, moving on to some rapid fire I have. This is one of those things where I was like, oh, I saw this and I was like, this is interesting.
6941000	6947000	You guys all know like the lottery, right? They probably they haven't I think almost every state has one some type of lottery.
6947000	6953000	I think there's one or two states that don't. But you probably still familiar with it is that it's like a state state sanctioned gambling, basically.
6953000	6957000	And here in California, we have our own lottery and they have the number picker thing.
6957000	6965000	But they also have these things called scratchers. And again, I'm not advertising for them, especially because it is, again, just basically state sanctioned gambling.
6965000	6975000	However, I would be remiss not to mention this caught my eye was that there is a large advertising push going on here in California with the lottery for Pac-Man scratchers.
6975000	6980000	That's right. So I guess for a limited time, we have some Pac-Man 40th anniversary scratcher cards.
6980000	6985000	And if you want to see these for yourself, again, I hate that I'm doing an advertisement for a gambling thing,
6985000	6993000	but I'm going to say Pac-Man scratchers dot com is where you can see what some of these look like, whether you are or not in California.
6993000	6998000	I it has been brought to my attention. Some other states have also done like Pac-Man things in their lottery.
6998000	7003000	I think Virginia did one last year. I bring this one up because I noticed the advertising push.
7003000	7010000	It was a huge billboard I saw while driving today and also that it's kind of time to the 40th anniversary.
7010000	7015000	But there's some different scratcher cards. So one of them you kind of scratch symbols and goes as a whole Pac-Man theme.
7015000	7019000	There's another one. It's a five dollar scratcher card. Remember when scratch cards were a buck?
7019000	7025000	Now they're like all sorts of numbers. So there's a five dollar maze card where you basically,
7025000	7031000	you know, scratch and as Pac-Man goes through a maze and hopefully you hit money and not a ghost.
7031000	7036000	And then there's a ten dollar card where you play like a bunch of scratcher games all at once. It's all Pac-Man themed.
7036000	7043000	I have to do it. What's that video of me doing one? Oh, do you do a video doing one?
7043000	7048000	No, why not? I might do that. That might be fun. I think you don't win if you don't play.
7048000	7057000	Do you know like there's a huge thing on YouTube for like slot machine YouTubers and basically people that gamble on YouTube?
7057000	7061000	It's like a huge industry. But just be careful y'all play responsibly.
7061000	7066000	And if you think you have a problem, please speak up and don't get a gambling addiction.
7066000	7071000	But I would say just as a collectible, I think it would be fun to own one of these.
7071000	7078000	Wouldn't that be funny if I like had a collectible and I like refused to scratch it off and it's like a grand prize winner?
7078000	7083000	But you would never know it's Schrodinger's cat, except it's Schrodinger's Pac-Man scratcher.
7083000	7088000	You would never know. That's right. That's right. So anyway, let's see.
7088000	7093000	Sometimes it's the anticipation that's the more fun part of doing those things, you know?
7093000	7100000	And then when you finally get whatever, it's like, OK, what's up?
7100000	7107000	Orange right in chat says, oh, yeah, one of the last family parties, one of my aunts sat everyone down to watch someone play a slot machine.
7107000	7110000	I have a friend that's super into this guy that plays slot machines on YouTube.
7110000	7114000	And she goes to like conventions in Vegas about this guy on YouTube.
7114000	7123000	And they they will play they do this thing where they pool their money so that everybody gets one pull on like a high dollar slot machine.
7123000	7127000	And they all split up the prize that comes out. I thought that was interesting.
7127000	7133000	Yeah. Listen, we can we used to do that with with when at my old job, we would do that with a lottery.
7133000	7137000	Yeah. Yeah. Sounds same kind of thing. Like the lottery pool.
7137000	7144000	Yeah. So, guys, if I'm you know, one day I decide to retire from video gaming and, you know, all is behind us and all that stuff.
7144000	7151000	And I'm I'm on Medicare and all that. Would you watch my YouTube videos if I was a slot machine YouTuber?
7151000	7157000	I'd let you get broke. That sounds like the life. We let you get broke, Rob.
7157000	7164000	Grandpa playing Konami slot machines. It's adjacent. It's gaming.
7164000	7171000	All right. You you get on with your bad self. I thought about it. I thought about it.
7171000	7178000	Phoenix 77 in chat says, Rob, you should become a V tuber. What's a V tuber or did you meant to say Y tuber like YouTuber?
7178000	7185000	I know. Well, I'm trying to do more on YouTube and do more stuff for Vogue that will I mean, Twitch is video content, isn't it?
7185000	7191000	All right. Anyway, all virtual YouTuber. Really, I have to learn more about that.
7191000	7199000	Look, look, I'm impressed that we actually got a project off the ground and let's see if it can hold for a couple months here.
7199000	7202000	OK, then we'll talk about new projects. All right.
7203000	7212000	Is that the YouTuber thing where like they you basically have the animation capture thing where you can like make yourself a chibi anime girl if you wanted to or something?
7212000	7215000	I think so. I've seen that on Twitch.
7215000	7222000	You can do a lot of things. You can be a furry. You can be you can be a lot of things. I see people do it on Twitch all the time. It's not just YouTube.
7222000	7228000	All right. Anyhow, I don't know if you can turn yourself into an eight bit character, though, probably.
7228000	7235000	But I know you can. In a game I was talking about last week, Avicii and Vector, right? The music game featuring the music of Avicii.
7235000	7242000	There is a code that has been released. I love shit like this. I love in 2020 we're talking about an unlock code. Fuck yeah.
7242000	7248000	You put in this code on the main menu up, down, down, down, down, down, down, A.
7248000	7253000	So that's up six downs and A. So sorry, it's not up, up, down, down.
7254000	7262000	So you do up, down six times and A and it will unlock an eight bit version of Wake Me Up, probably one of his best known songs.
7262000	7269000	And the little when you play the game with it, it's an eight bit style, which is pretty rad.
7269000	7276000	So yeah, you know what? Kudos for something that you could have done as DLC, but you didn't.
7276000	7281000	You did it as an unlock code, as a throwback. Classy, classy props to you.
7281000	7284000	All right. Moving on, Dark Sakura.
7284000	7294000	Well, there are, you know, we kind of went over the one up thing a little bit earlier, you know, with that Super Pac-Man, like you mentioned.
7294000	7303000	Well, there's another one coming out. It's Golden Axe Arcade One Up, and it's actually already available, actually, as of the 17th.
7303000	7313000	And it includes, dun, dun, dun, Golden Axe, Golden Axe, The Revenge of Death Adder, Shinobi, Altered Beast and Wrestle War.
7313000	7319000	Dude, if I had this, I would want it completely skinned for Shinobi, though. That would just be so rad.
7319000	7329000	And then also they are the arcade ROMs licensed directly from Sega and it's $399.
7330000	7336000	Also, there's a Humble Bundle out that I'm kind of thinking of putting some money into.
7336000	7341000	It's called You Can Pet the Dog for all the good boys.
7341000	7353000	So basically this particular Humble Bundle is offering you a bunch of games that will put the proceeds back to various animal charities.
7353000	7361000	So the $1 unlock will have Scribblenauts Unlimited, Beyond Eyes, Dog Sled Saga and Bulb Boy.
7361000	7370000	If you do over $4.71, you get Shenmue 1 and 2, where the water tastes like wine and death's gambit.
7370000	7373000	Over $12, it gets Blair Witch.
7373000	7378000	Bonuses include Bulb Boy soundtrack and Dog Sled Saga soundtrack.
7378000	7385000	Some of the charities included are Sweet Farm, Humane Society of the United States and Best Friends Animal Society.
7385000	7393000	So I, as a cat person, can buy this because I know cats will be helped as well.
7393000	7400000	All right. What a clever idea for a bundle, quite honestly. I think it's great.
7400000	7404000	I think it's funny that Shenmue is included because, I mean, You Pet the Dog.
7404000	7406000	Yeah. All right.
7406000	7407000	You Pet the Dog.
7407000	7413000	Well, let's move on and see if there's any games coming out this week where you might be able to pet the dog or a cat.
7413000	7416000	Come on. There's cat people too, or maybe other animals as well.
7416000	7421000	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. Let's start with Loki in the US.
7421000	7425000	Yeah. I'm not sure if you can pet dogs in any of these, but let's see what we've got.
7425000	7432000	So we have a Halo 3 ODST. So that's coming to PC and Android.
7432000	7437000	13 Sentinels, a GS rim on PlayStation 4.
7437000	7440000	Giga Force on PC and PlayStation 4.
7440000	7445000	Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 Complete Edition on PC and Nintendo Switch.
7445000	7450000	And if I remember correctly, I believe that is the free game that's going to be next week on the Epic Games Store, by the way.
7450000	7451000	Oh, really?
7451000	7454000	Serious Sam. Yeah, I saw that because I was showing my kids.
7454000	7459000	I was like, Hey, I'm like, you got to put this in your library.
7459000	7462000	Serious Sam 4 on PC and Stadia.
7462000	7470000	Vampire the Masquerade Night Road on PC, Mac and Linux, iOS, Android and Web browser,
7470000	7477000	which I assume would be considered in all of these because I can't think of something that would not be part of those.
7477000	7483000	Mafia Definitive Edition on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7483000	7489000	And last but not least on PC, Panzer Dragoon remake.
7489000	7493000	That's it. I was like, isn't that already out, but not on PC yet.
7493000	7495000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. I gotcha.
7495000	7499000	Well, traveling over to Japan, we have the Japanese releases and coming out.
7499000	7503000	It's been a few weeks of slowness in Japan, but things are starting to pick back up this week.
7503000	7508000	We have quite a few releases on the Nintendo Switch this week, including Wagamama High Spec.
7509000	7514000	KonoSuba, God's blessing on this wonderful world.
7514000	7516000	Love for this tempting attire.
7516000	7522000	Yes, that is the full name of the game and that is coming out in a regular and limited edition this week.
7522000	7525000	I was trying to see, is that like another like manga looking game?
7525000	7527000	Yeah, I think it is.
7527000	7528000	I'm here for it.
7528000	7530000	Yep. All right. So there's that.
7530000	7537000	Let's see. Also out on the Switch this week is Dungreed and Ikaruga is getting a release on the Switch this week in Japan.
7537000	7539000	Cool, cool.
7539000	7541000	Ikaruga is on everything. It's on my toaster.
7541000	7543000	I know. I know.
7543000	7546000	Does it have Doom? Does it have Ikaruga?
7546000	7548000	All right. Does it have Skyrim?
7548000	7556000	All right. And then on the PlayStation 4, we have Date Alive, Ren Dystopia, also on regular and limited edition.
7556000	7560000	Oni Chambara Origin is also out this week.
7560000	7563000	Ikagi 2 in regular and limited edition.
7563000	7566000	Is it Ikagi?
7566000	7568000	I think you're right. I think it's Ikagi.
7568000	7570000	Thank you.
7570000	7572000	Why don't you do Japanese?
7572000	7575000	Have we talked about you doing Japanese releases for the longest time?
7575000	7577000	Just switching.
7577000	7580000	Well, I mean, but it's good practice for you, Rob.
7580000	7582000	For that Japanese class, I'm not taking.
7582000	7584000	Yes. All right.
7584000	7588000	Funny enough, I'm on a 56 day streak on Duolingo, just saying.
7588000	7590000	Oh, good job. Good job.
7590000	7598000	You know what? And I think the listeners have just over the past 10 years we've been doing release dates regularly have just become used to me flubbing all the Japanese words.
7598000	7600000	It's part of the charm, I guess.
7600000	7607000	All right. Anyway, also on the PlayStation 4, F1 2020 and Ikaruga also on the PlayStation 4 this week.
7607000	7609000	All the Ikaruga now available.
7609000	7612000	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
7612000	7615000	Well, let's see if I pronounce it right.
7615000	7617000	Stop it now.
7617000	7622000	On the 22nd, we have 13 Sentinels Aegis Rim.
7622000	7624000	We have, or Aegis.
7624000	7629000	On the 24th, we have Total War Three Kingdoms Royal Edition.
7629000	7632000	On the 25th, a few things. We have Monstrum.
7632000	7636000	We have PGA Tour 2K21.
7636000	7639000	Big Bobby Car, The Big Race.
7639000	7641000	Adam's Venture Origins.
7641000	7647000	We have Do Not Feed the Monkeys, which I think is a great name and I have no idea what it's about.
7647000	7649000	Port Royale 4.
7649000	7656000	Jamie, I'm going to guess that in the game you don't want to feed the monkeys, no matter how bad they ask.
7656000	7660000	Just a guess. Hypothetically.
7660000	7664000	Now I'm thinking of Don't Know What the Monkeys Won't Do from Animaniacs.
7664000	7669000	Wasn't there a game or something or a website or something called Don't Push the Button?
7670000	7672000	I think, yeah.
7672000	7678000	I feel like that's a game somewhere where you just put a big button in the middle and it's Don't Push the Button.
7678000	7681000	If I told you, I'd give you a clue.
7681000	7684000	I think that's how the lyrics went. Oh my god, I love the monkey song.
7684000	7691000	Anyway, Troll Hunters, Defenders of Arcadia, Mafia Definitive Edition, and Mafia Trilogy.
7691000	7694000	Stephanie.
7694000	7695000	Alright.
7695000	7699000	We've got a few more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the listener roundtable for tonight.
7699000	7704000	I know we have a couple emails tonight, so that'll be good, and your other topics as presented in chat.
7704000	7707000	But first, some updates on another game, right, Logie?
7707000	7713000	Yep, so Fall Guys is getting some more updates in between the Season 1 and Season 2 of content.
7713000	7720000	So now for their latest patch, they're actually remixing some of the older levels, so that's pretty cool.
7721000	7730000	So along with that, though, there's going to be some interesting developments regarding cheaters.
7730000	7741000	So what they've been doing with folks cheating in the game is they've been putting them off in their own little island with the other cheaters so they can all play games together.
7741000	7742000	I love how they do that.
7742000	7753000	Grand Theft Auto V, they did that similar with that, and I know there's been other games that have kind of banished cheaters to their own little area with other cheaters, but I think that's kind of funny.
7753000	7759000	I wish I could almost watch people play that, but yeah, so that's a new thing.
7759000	7766000	So hopefully cheaters will be just sent to their own cheater banishment, and you'll never have to see them again.
7766000	7769000	Bye.
7770000	7777000	Although I don't think the cheater island thing lasted very long, sadly. I think everybody on cheater island figured out they were on cheater island.
7777000	7778000	Yeah.
7778000	7785000	Anyway, here's my question for chat, really, and anybody on the panel who wants to answer it.
7786000	7794000	Now that Among Us is like the big craze, are people still crazy on Fall Guys? Or did everybody leave that behind for Among Us?
7794000	7802000	Because I feel like overnight on Twitch, the rankings just changed, and now Among Us is that game that showed up number one.
7802000	7808000	So who out there is still playing Fall Guys on the regular? Just curious.
7808000	7810000	Alright.
7810000	7814000	ActDef says, I still am crazy for Fall Guys. Okay, good. Good.
7814000	7817000	I need to play more Fall Guys. I haven't done it in a while.
7817000	7822000	Yeah. You know, I noticed Alan was playing Fall Guys pretty hardcore for a bit, but you know what?
7822000	7828000	I don't know if I talked about this on a previous show. In fact, I feel like I hear him in the other room, and he's probably playing this game right now.
7828000	7831000	Dead by Daylight is like the thing that he got super into.
7831000	7833000	I got my Steam notification from that.
7833000	7835000	Oh, he plays all the time.
7835000	7836000	Yeah.
7836000	7842000	Blackcompat does point out Fall Guys is still popular though. Yeah, it hasn't fallen out of the top ten or anything.
7842000	7857000	But I'm glad the game is getting updates because I do feel like it's the type of game that kind of needs these regular updates to keep people going back and looking and checking it out and keeping it towards the top of the list in the face of other things and so forth.
7857000	7862000	Shehulk10 in chat says, why do people cheat playing online games?
7862000	7879000	Unfortunately, people just want to troll because they want a reaction. And the problem is, and this is the weird thing for me, in a game like Fall Guys, you're not going to see a reaction, but it's kind of that whole like, you know you're getting one.
7879000	7885000	And it's like, I'm sitting here and I'm trolling and this person's gonna be so mad and it's really funny.
7886000	7889000	So, all right.
7889000	7895000	Anyway, Fifth Dream in chat says, I barely played Fall Guys, but my friend wanted me to play Among Us on Twitch with her today.
7895000	7902000	SHO 100 Matt says, current stats, Among Us, 315k viewers, Fall Guys, 13.3k viewers.
7903000	7918000	But 13.3k is still a lot. Like I kind of, you know, I'm not, now I feel like I've shaded the game and that's not what I'm trying to do. I'm just saying like, I just feel like this game was everywhere last month and now it's like, it's there.
7918000	7922000	It's still there, but you know, PUBG is still there.
7922000	7926000	Anyway, I just sound like I'm being mean and I'm really not trying to be.
7926000	7932000	All right, moving on. Let's talk about, yeah, just wait till the new content update drops, says Questbuster.
7932000	7938000	That's probably the, you're right, when these things drop, it's gonna shoot right back up in the rankings because everybody's gonna be trying to get new costumes, that's for sure.
7938000	7949000	Let's move on and talk about some updates. This was kind of hinted at earlier in the show, but we have more NES and SNES games slated for Nintendo Online.
7949000	7954000	And the Switch Online, the classic console stuff that you should get with your Nintendo Online account.
7954000	7958000	So there are some game updates coming this week on September 23rd.
7958000	7966000	On the Super Nintendo, brand new games you're gonna see in the library are Donkey Kong Country 2, Diddy Kong's Quest.
7966000	7971000	Makes sense, we just got Donkey Kong Country 1 in the last update, so it's time for number 2.
7971000	7974000	Hopefully Bobby Blackwell's paying attention because I know he loves these games.
7974000	7977000	Mario's Super P-Cross.
7977000	7984000	I wasn't even aware they had a P-Cross game on Super Nintendo, but it looks like it's one of those games that was only ever released in Japan.
7984000	7990000	They actually didn't release it here, but they're still putting it on the online service, kind of like Puyo Puyo.
7990000	7994000	They did that with Puyo Puyo, and I feel like one other game they did that with as well.
7994000	7999000	Oh, lost levels on the NES side.
7999000	8005000	They put out the Mario 2 ROM and just made up a lost levels box art for it, so interesting.
8005000	8012000	Anyway, also on the Super Nintendo, the Peacekeepers, which I don't remember this game.
8012000	8016000	Wasn't it? I think it's a take, I think it's like a Final Fight clone, like that type of game.
8016000	8019000	But anyway, I don't remember it, I gotta be honest.
8019000	8024000	And on the NES side, there's one new game, but it's SCAT.
8024000	8030000	That's right, they released a game called SCAT for the 8-bit Nintendo.
8030000	8034000	But it stands for Special Cybernetic Attack Team.
8034000	8039000	I'm sorry, it does not stand for Sacramento's Cosplay and Tournament.
8039000	8043000	Well remembered, oh my god.
8043000	8046000	That was some stuff.
8046000	8049000	That predates OLR, doesn't it?
8049000	8051000	It kind of does.
8051000	8056000	I think the SCAT tournament was, which yes, was Sacramento's Cosplay and Tournament.
8056000	8061000	I believe that was when, yeah, because I was living at the Crazy House then.
8061000	8064000	And OLR didn't start until I was at the next place.
8064000	8065000	Yeah.
8065000	8067000	Wow, wow. Alright.
8067000	8070000	Anyhow, Japan, I want to just kind of add to this.
8070000	8074000	Because, and I've mentioned this a million times on the show, but just if you're not already aware.
8074000	8077000	You can get to Japan's library very easily.
8077000	8082000	You just have to create a Japanese account, which is very easy to do with a throwaway email address.
8082000	8090000	And then you just go into the store and download the Japanese versions of Famicom online and Super Famicom online.
8090000	8096000	And you can play all the Japanese versions, which I would highly recommend you do for things like Metroid.
8096000	8102000	And things that really were different because of the way the Famicom was with the extra sound chip versus the NES.
8102000	8104000	It's really worth looking into.
8104000	8108000	But, if you have the Japanese one, you're going to get some different titles.
8108000	8111000	Donkey Kong Country 2 is still one of them.
8111000	8119000	But they're also going to be getting on the Super Nintendo Fire Emblem, Mystery of the Emblem, Super Tennis, and Wild Guns.
8119000	8122000	I believe Super Tennis and Wild Guns were released in the US previously.
8122000	8127000	But if you want to play that Fire Emblem game, you'll have to do that through the Japanese store.
8127000	8133000	Because that game has some heavy Japanese in it, and I don't think they're going to translate it ever for this side.
8133000	8137000	But if you have working enough knowledge of Japanese, it might be up your alley.
8137000	8139000	Pretty cool.
8139000	8144000	Alright. Moving on. Let's go to Dark Sakura.
8145000	8148000	Well, oh my goodness.
8148000	8154000	So, there is, well, I hope this is real.
8154000	8157000	You know, we've had good things come from it before.
8157000	8168000	But there is a Portuguese retailer that is listing Mass Effect trilogy remastered for PS4, Xbox One, and Switch.
8169000	8175000	I would love a remastered version for PC as well, if that happens.
8175000	8180000	But yeah, it's going to include all three from what it shows.
8180000	8184000	It's EA, girl. The PC thing will happen.
8184000	8189000	Well, it's by a Portuguese retailer named Gaming Replay.
8189000	8193000	And they have an October release window.
8194000	8207000	But it was reported that Electronic Arts would be releasing a Mass Effect trilogy remastered in fiscal year 2021, which would end March 31st, 2021.
8207000	8216000	But the quote was to not expect it on Switch, at least not at first. So, we'll see.
8216000	8222000	So, I'm not sure of a nice way to phrase this, but like, when the fuck are they going to announce this?
8222000	8231000	Like, I know it's rumors and all that stuff, but like, this is like the fifth time we've had a substantial rumor around this Mass Effect trilogy.
8231000	8233000	When are they just going to announce it already?
8233000	8237000	And I thought, okay, they're just waiting for N7 day, whatever. They're trying to be cute.
8237000	8242000	They're going to announce it on November 7th and just release it in a couple weeks, or maybe it'll be available that day.
8242000	8246000	Or something like, it'll be a digital release that's available that day.
8246000	8252000	But now you've got this retailer that's putting October and I'm like, that's just around the corner.
8252000	8255000	When are they going to announce this? I don't know.
8255000	8261000	Which, I mean, maybe that's supposed to be the announced date and put up pre-orders for it. Who knows?
8261000	8262000	Oh, maybe, maybe.
8262000	8265000	With the final release date being November 7th.
8265000	8269000	If I was going to market this shit, that's how I would do it.
8269000	8271000	You know what though?
8271000	8272000	What?
8272000	8278000	I would get it and then definitely wait for mods to come out so I can make my Shepard look the way I want her to again.
8278000	8284000	No OneSpecial77 in chat says, so I'm guessing Rob's getting the Mass Effect trilogy remaster.
8284000	8286000	You better fucking believe I am.
8286000	8288000	Especially if multiplayer's coming back.
8288000	8292000	If they made some polishing to Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.
8292000	8296000	I will be disappointed if they remove multiplayer.
8296000	8298000	I don't know why they do that.
8298000	8304000	I will be disappointed if they do it, but it will not stop me from buying the collection and playing the whole goddamn thing over again.
8304000	8306000	I'll fucking do it.
8306000	8309000	What if they also bring back the phone utilities?
8309000	8312000	Ooh, I didn't even think of that.
8312000	8313000	The war map or something?
8313000	8317000	You're right, the war map on the phone. How are they going to do that?
8317000	8322000	Maybe the phone app will still work. It was all through your EA account.
8322000	8328000	Yeah, I think it would be pretty fun. I honestly think that I'll get it.
8328000	8331000	Oh yeah, I'll get it too. No question.
8331000	8333000	When there's a PC release.
8333000	8338000	Alright, moving on. A few more stories for you guys. Loki.
8338000	8346000	Alright, so let's talk about running games on systems they're not intended for.
8347000	8353000	So Super Mario 64, as you may remember, had its source code reverse engineered.
8353000	8359000	And so now, since they have the original source for the game, they can compile it for different systems.
8359000	8364000	And one of the systems that's been compiled for now is the PlayStation 2.
8364000	8368000	Which, the first iteration of it was extremely buggy.
8368000	8372000	Now there's a better video out there actually of somebody speedrunning the game.
8372000	8379000	And for the most part, aside from some texture issues with some of the transparencies and stuff, it seems to be working pretty good.
8379000	8388000	But late breaking news also, not only is it running on the PlayStation 2, but they have now compiled it for the Dreamcast.
8388000	8391000	It is now running natively on the Dreamcast as well.
8391000	8395000	I saw someone post that to the VOG Network Discord right before the show tonight.
8395000	8397000	It's also on the Dreamcast.
8397000	8400000	And of course, you can join our Discord over at vognetwork.com.
8400000	8402000	vognetwork.com slash Discord.
8402000	8404000	It will get you the invite random customer.
8404000	8406000	The Dreamcast seems to have a whole other set of issues.
8406000	8409000	There's no audio in that and there's a few texture issues as well.
8409000	8413000	But some of the things like the text on screen is actually rendering fine.
8413000	8415000	It's just some of the other stuff is not.
8415000	8419000	So, very interesting to see this stuff kind of working on these systems.
8419000	8424000	I mean, I guess it's not surprising since you can compile it for all these different systems and it's just code at the end of the day.
8424000	8428000	But yeah, pretty interesting.
8428000	8432000	Yeah. I didn't even think about that as a side effect of the leak.
8432000	8436000	Like, you know, because maybe it's just I'm trying to erase that from my mind.
8436000	8439000	Because it is pretty fucked up the source code is out there.
8439000	8441000	No, no, no. This isn't from that.
8441000	8445000	There's actually it's a team of people that actually reverse engineered the whole thing.
8445000	8447000	Down to source.
8447000	8450000	I mean, you're really still not supposed to do that.
8450000	8456000	But it is I will acknowledge it for the technical surprise that it is, I shall say.
8456000	8461000	But yeah, don't ever put that online or Nintendo is going to come to your house and break the door down.
8461000	8463000	That's for sure. All right.
8463000	8465000	Already leaked online.
8465000	8467000	I know. Once on the Internet, always on the Internet.
8467000	8470000	But don't be the don't be the fool to host it exclusively on their site.
8470000	8473000	That's for sure. All right.
8473000	8475000	One more story for you guys tonight.
8475000	8479000	And it's about a doll who here loves dolls.
8479000	8482000	So I know I was going to say dark soccer does.
8482000	8486000	But no, I'm and actually this is pretty fucking cool.
8486000	8490000	Like, you know, if you're a doll fan or not, I know you all are video game fans.
8490000	8493000	You wouldn't be listening to this show, although that is.
8493000	8496000	Is anybody out there not a video game fan listening to all?
8496000	8498000	Because I do find that kind of fascinating.
8498000	8501000	And you should email us participate at orange on radio dot com.
8501000	8507000	Anyway, a doll company and I've never heard of this company, but apparently they make premium dolls.
8507000	8510000	American Girl is the name of the company around.
8510000	8513000	I mean, it's been a big part of a lot of people's childhood.
8513000	8522000	OK. Yeah. You know, when I saw the picture, I was like, oh, that looks it looks a little bit like a much nicer version of kid sister.
8522000	8527000	Do you remember my buddy and kid sister or like Cabbage Patch or something like that?
8527000	8530000	Yeah, but these are way above Cabbage Patch, like that doll.
8531000	8533000	Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I gotcha. I gotcha.
8533000	8537000	The Mercedes. An American Girl doll looks like a Mercedes Benz.
8537000	8540000	And it fucking gets you up to speed.
8540000	8544000	Where we're American girls, then they have book lines.
8544000	8548000	They've had movies. I'm pretty sure they've had TV shows.
8548000	8549000	So it's that's been.
8549000	8554000	And they've done a lot to forward social issues and women's rights issues.
8554000	8556000	It's pretty amazing.
8556000	8563000	And a lot of their the material that they put out, they've done a lot of research to make sure it's culturally accurate,
8563000	8568000	including even getting for their Native American American girl.
8568000	8573000	They've been they worked directly with the tribe she's supposed to represent.
8573000	8576000	And so, yeah, they're they're amazing.
8576000	8579000	But keep going with your story, because I have an addendum to that.
8579000	8585000	I'm learning a lot on this show tonight. I put this in here because I was like, oh, it's dolls meets video games.
8585000	8588000	How often do we get to talk about that? But I'm learning a lot. All right.
8588000	8595000	Anyway, American Girl is releasing an arcade game gal as part of their historical characters line.
8595000	8599000	It is a total 80s girl. The dolly is very old.
8599000	8603000	I know, right. Courtney Moore is the name of the doll.
8603000	8606000	And she definitely looks like a California Valley girl from the 80s.
8606000	8608000	But here's the thing. And this is this is what I'm getting to.
8608000	8612000	She has a Pac-Man machine that she's with.
8612000	8616000	And you would expect that the Pac-Man is machine would just be like, OK, cute.
8616000	8619000	It's a doll with a machine. But here's the thing.
8619000	8623000	Not only is the doll 18 inches tall, which is, you know, a decent size.
8623000	8631000	So is that little arcade machine. And that Pac-Man cabinet actually plays Pac-Man.
8631000	8636000	It is an actual fully operational Pac-Man machine that comes with the doll.
8636000	8639000	And that is really cool. Now, to kind of add to it,
8639000	8643000	dark soccer was saying about some of the get it on its own, by the way, the machine.
8643000	8646000	Oh, I didn't I didn't see that. That's really cool.
8646000	8651000	It's only American Girl website. And I will say and I apologize if this is what you were about to say, Jamie.
8651000	8655000	But it's part of the story I'm looking at American Girl to what you were saying a minute ago.
8655000	8662000	They are going to match all of the customer donations to a maximum of fifty thousand dollars to the association.
8662000	8666000	Girls who code at girls who code dot com.
8666000	8671000	It is a nonprofit org that helps women from diverse backgrounds study computer science,
8671000	8676000	using online resources, scholar sessions and summer events.
8676000	8681000	Also, five thousand dollar scholarships to four of the students in the program.
8681000	8686000	So, wow. Win all around. Not bad for a doll story.
8686000	8691000	Well, there's a little bit more to please know. It was gosh, what was it?
8691000	8698000	A year ago, year and a half ago, they did a character named Julie who had a pinball table.
8698000	8704000	She was the 70s girl. Oh, and the pinball actually plays.
8704000	8709000	And, you know, and hold on, I'll find find the pinball.
8709000	8714000	You can actually buy the pinball by itself, too. But there is the pinball one.
8714000	8717000	And then I don't know if we put it in the in the chat room.
8717000	8721000	But if you just look up American Girl and it's Julie Pinball, you'll find that one.
8721000	8725000	The pinball table is one hundred twenty bucks by itself.
8725000	8730000	Pac-Man is I think it's also about one hundred and fifty.
8730000	8734000	Wow. For the little little Pac-Man.
8734000	8741000	But I mean, it's fully it's fully accurate. You know, I was pretty, pretty interested.
8741000	8745000	Meesh in chat says, shit, I don't want the doll. Just give me the frickin cabinet.
8745000	8751000	Well, you have that option. You can buy both. You can buy one. Yeah, I'll find it and link it in chat.
8751000	8757000	And Bobby Black Wolf in chat says a pinball table I can actually afford and see it.
8757000	8761000	Tiberius says the doll is also pretty cute. Yeah, I'm not not going to lie.
8761000	8768000	It's a cute. I was like dolls have come a long way. And the thing about the American girls dolls is that I mean,
8768000	8771000	you'll find plenty if you were into the doll collecting,
8771000	8775000	you'll find lots of people out there who will make clothes for them and everything.
8775000	8782000	And the one thing that's interesting, if you the the Courtney's Pac-Man machine that I linked in chat,
8782000	8787000	if you look at the last picture that shows the doll next to it and it is fully doll sized,
8787000	8795000	you see the USB connector coming from the back. So that apparently is how it's powered is via USB.
8795000	8798000	Very cool. But yeah, it's all out for preorder right now.
8798000	8805000	And I mean, even, you know, with the pinball one, I know that some of Dan's buddies had a big talk going on,
8805000	8810000	like, and these are men going on about the pinball table.
8810000	8815000	And I mean, I certainly wouldn't wouldn't mind, you know, having it.
8815000	8822000	And it's very, very much 70s style pinball down to having the little digital, not digital,
8822000	8830000	but the little LED, LED display for the score and everything.
8830000	8838000	So. All right. Well, that was I was to say that was much more of a feel good story,
8838000	8842000	especially with everything they're doing for the charities and stuff that I was expecting to end the show on.
8842000	8847000	So that's pretty cool. Yeah. The American Girl Company is actually pretty stellar.
8847000	8853000	I haven't found anything to be upset with them about or anything along those lines.
8853000	8865000	It's you know, the the I would say if you get a chance to go and just read some of the stories about the girls themselves,
8865000	8869000	they've written about them because they tell some pretty compelling stories,
8869000	8875000	especially some of the ones that address the civil rights movement.
8875000	8879000	And during the times of slavery, those stories are really poignant.
8879000	8883000	I bet. All right. All right. Well, I learned about a new company tonight.
8883000	8886000	Wasn't expecting that. All right. Well, moving on.
8886000	8889000	It's the part of the show now that we're done with all the news that we had scheduled,
8889000	8891000	that we're going to get into the listener roundtable.
8891000	8896000	It's your chance to I mean, we try to get you guys to participate throughout the show via our chat.
8896000	8899000	But this is the time for you to interact with our show via the mailbag as well as the chat room.
8899000	8904000	If you have any questions for us or something you want us to talk about that we haven't gotten around to yet.
8904000	8908000	Go ahead and shout it out in our chat over twitch dot TV slash vog and network.
8908000	8913000	And while we wait for some of those questions, I think our soccer has a couple of emails to get to tonight.
8913000	8916000	You guys email us. Participate at Orange Laundry dot com.
8916000	8922000	And this is a great way for those of you that listen on the podcast feed through Spotify, iTunes.
8922000	8925000	Not the Amazon one yet. I'm trying to get us listed on there.
8925000	8929000	But I think the fact we have a custom thing is messing with it.
8929000	8931000	But anyway, trying to get on everything.
8931000	8935000	So for those of you guys that listen on the podcast feed can participate as well.
8935000	8938000	Again, the email is participate at Orange Laundry dot com.
8938000	8941000	Dark soccer. Why don't you kick us off with an email?
8941000	8945000	All right. So first of them. Hello, all our crew.
8945000	8949000	I probably love the show. Probably. OK.
8949000	8955000	Finally, we know the console price is four hundred ninety nine for the high end models is OK.
8955000	8959000	But we can get both high end consoles for only a thousand dollars.
8959000	8964000	That ain't bad. Perhaps one could postpone that PC upgrade. What do you all think?
8964000	8968000	Thank you. Love, Sam. I'm sorry. I love that.
8968000	8975000	It's I probably love the show. Yeah.
8975000	8978000	And I and I tend to read these like they're written.
8978000	8985000	So if there's like lack of, you know, punctuation or things kind of run on, then I will read it exactly that way.
8985000	8990000	No, I think it's great. Like, I'm not I'm not going to it's just funny.
8990000	8995000	Like, I like that it doesn't B.S. us. You don't have to confess your undying love for O.L.R..
8995000	9000000	Like, I get it. For some of you, we're background noise and that's OK.
9000000	9005000	So all right. I probably liked your email. All right.
9005000	9013000	Anyway. So, yeah. It's the pricing of everything and what to do.
9013000	9022000	You know, and there's a lot of people who are taking that perspective of why should I get the consoles when I can just use that money and upgrade my computer?
9022000	9027000	But I really, truly don't think there's a one size fits all answer to this situation.
9027000	9033000	And I'm going to tell you, it's really big for me personally, because I have definitely been confronted with that.
9033000	9039000	When I talk about I'm going to get the Xbox Series X and people go, well, I'm just going to play those games on my PC, whatever.
9039000	9044000	But here's the thing for me. I there are a lot of PC games I do enjoy playing.
9044000	9048000	I play Final Fantasy 14 on PC, a lot of the Blizzard stuff I play on PC.
9048000	9054000	There's no shortage of PC games that I do play. But sometimes y'all and especially in the year 2020,
9054000	9062000	I've got to get out of my office and away from my PC and somewhere else where I can be a vegetable.
9062000	9067000	And that's why console gaming is really attractive here in the year 2020.
9067000	9076000	Because unlike, you know, before, unlike the BC, before COVID, unlike those times when I was actually going into the office using a computer there,
9076000	9080000	I'm in my office for eight hours a day working there.
9080000	9085000	And then I'm continuing to play some games and they're like, I have to get the hell out of that office once in a while.
9085000	9087000	So sometimes for me, that's enough.
9087000	9094000	And, you know, I know you guys out there would be like, well, you should have a separate space for your office and something where you can like close the door.
9094000	9098000	Yeah. OK. But as you all know, we didn't prepare for this.
9098000	9102000	We've had to just make it work with what we've got. And that's what I've got going right now.
9102000	9106000	Now, when we talk about maybe going to a new space or something, I'll have that in mind.
9106000	9113000	But for now, I think being able to separate from the PC sometimes is a necessity for me anyway.
9113000	9117000	So I don't know. Any other thoughts on the email?
9117000	9123000	No. OK. You said it. All right. Let me get some thoughts from chat real quick.
9123000	9132000	Quest Buster in chat says, I love gaming on PCs, but I know people that work with PCs during the day and when they get home, don't want to touch one at all.
9132000	9139000	Yeah. And DJ Ramas points out that five hundred dollars ain't going to do enough to upgrade your PC for next gen console specs.
9139000	9147000	And in a way, that is also true. Like, you know, if you want a high end graphics card that does ray tracing, that's going to be a charge right there.
9147000	9156000	So it just I really think the answer to this question is really dependent on who you are and what you like and what your situation is like.
9156000	9159000	And that's something we as gaming fans have to keep in mind.
9159000	9168000	I think more often than we do is that the answer for me and my house and my gaming configuration is not going to apply one for one to somebody else's.
9168000	9172000	You have to weigh the options. Nothing is one size fits all.
9172000	9177000	Yeah, exactly. And that's that's my thought on that.
9177000	9181000	All right. Just does Stella want to read an email, Loki?
9181000	9184000	No, she's just six. I wasn't looking at her. So.
9184000	9192000	Oh, all right. For those on the podcast feed, Stella, Loki's kitty has decided to grace us with her presence, although it's so funny.
9193000	9200000	Every time Stella's on cam, it's the same pose, but it is the most damn adorable pose you will ever see.
9200000	9204000	Yeah, she doesn't like facing the other way and she can't hear anymore, really.
9204000	9210000	So she just screams at me the entire time. At least I'm pretty sure she can't hear.
9210000	9214000	Yeah, I'm pretty sure she can't hear anything anymore, but I don't know.
9214000	9217000	Did you name her after the Atari emulator?
9217000	9220000	No. Funny enough, she's already named Stella when we got her.
9220000	9224000	OK, I like that. It's kind of like Shermy was named Sherman.
9224000	9228000	Oh, you know, Mr. Smoosh had a name.
9228000	9234000	We found that out. We found that out when we took him to the vet finally in the vet, scanned the little thing.
9234000	9240000	Mr. Smoosh is oh, I don't even want to say it. It's so bad. Mr. Smoosh's former name was Hex.
9240000	9246000	Yeah, I liked it. I don't like that name at all for Mr. Smoosh.
9246000	9252000	But I think it's a cool name for a black cat. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's a cool name for a black cat, but not that black cat.
9252000	9261000	Yeah, if I wasn't naming my cats after, you know, video games, I think Midna would have made a nice Knox or something like N.O.X..
9261000	9266000	So we'll see. Tiger Claws says, I'm surprised Mr. Smoosh isn't like that.
9266000	9272000	Does he not like to cuddle? No, he does. But he's more like a lap cat and he's really attached to Alan.
9272000	9278000	So like if in fact, probably no, because I heard him in the hallway. But if Alan is like gaming or working on the computer long term.
9278000	9282000	Absolutely. Mr. Smoosh will jump on Alan's lap and sit there.
9282000	9288000	He doesn't like walk up on the shoulder like what Stella's doing to Loki, but he'll lie there in the lap.
9288000	9294000	He's too fat to go any higher. He's too fat to fly.
9294000	9298000	That's right. Anyway, sorry. Dark soccer. More emails. All right.
9298000	9303000	All right. So next email. Hello, peoples.
9303000	9310000	In recent weeks, we have seen a lot of stories being spread about the upcoming release of Sony and Microsoft's next gaming consoles.
9310000	9318000	This week, we saw Sony release the announcement about their upcoming consoles. Does their announcement line up with the stories we were told about about it?
9318000	9324000	Honestly, I don't fucking care about this fucking stories and whether or not this fucking stories line up with the fucking reality.
9324000	9332000	I just count those stories as goddamn fucking worthless hoopla from people who know fucking nothing about fucking nothing.
9332000	9336000	Someone's mad and I am not adding in the fucking that was already there.
9336000	9338000	So I think I'm going to hit a limit.
9338000	9348000	Gaming is not alone when it comes to stupid stories being spread around those who have no value in the real world and only serve to drive interest among the stupid and gullible.
9349000	9357000	American culture is rife with this, and we need to stop rewarding it with our attention. By the way, it's not you wrote out and you should have wrote an R.
9357000	9359000	I correct it for you. Thank you.
9359000	9372000	Let me be clear. Speculation is only worthwhile as it relates to gambling and that speculation relates to whether some team is going to cover the spread or some kicker is going to cost you whatever you gambled on when they miss a field goal in the third quarter.
9372000	9377000	Okay, you're talking sports. That's another language. Don't do that again.
9377000	9389000	The only rumors I went to listen to was put out by Fleetwood Mac in 1977. Other than that, get that shit out of my face, any site that pedals and unfounded rumors speculation is worthless to me and people should treat this as such.
9389000	9396000	Do I have standards when it comes to sources Yes I do. I will never apologize for that no matter how much people who are trusted by others will disagree with me.
9396000	9403000	Any source worthy of my trust will stand up to my strenuous scrutiny scrutiny absolutely at least take care of entertainment.
9403000	9410000	Okay. I think that you're mad and I don't know why.
9410000	9420000	I think speculation sometimes is fun. Yeah, you know, respectfully I disagree like calm down.
9420000	9436000	I think that you might need, like, some Valium, or what's the other thing that people take that as a palm. Here's the thing, here's the thing, look, I, I'm gonna say that I get the frustration about like rumors is that, and I do understand that there
9436000	9438000	is too much.
9438000	9452000	People don't fact check and people don't think about some of the things that they spread online. I had a big problem with that on Facebook and I think a lot of us do we all have that one relative who doesn't fucking read the article before they share it
9452000	9465000	or shares these things that were just debunked on Snopes like two weeks ago, you know, three years old. Exactly. It's, it's those types of things and and to some extent like I get that especially when it comes to rumors and things you know and so forth.
9465000	9480000	But on the other hand, like and and having done this show I make no secret. Yes, we do talk about rumors on this show, but we do it because this is a show about video games, gaming culture and the gaming lifestyle and rumors, like it or not, you're part of the
9480000	9492000	culture and if something is gaining a lot of speed and traction so forth on Twitter. It's something I feel like we have to talk about here to reasonably and reasonably debate is this rumor something that is.
9492000	9504000	And remember this when I used to talk about a rumor was plausible. Now you all gave me so much shit over that word I stopped, I tried to take it out of my vocabulary, but I think you still know what I'm getting at is that you know we kind of discuss could there
9504000	9515000	be smoke where there's fire with these rumors. But let's be honest, as much as you hate rumors. The Final Fantasy 16 one at the PS five event spot on. They got it. Yeah, that was that was a true rumor.
9515000	9527000	This Mass Effect trilogy thing. It's gonna happen. And the movie industry is not immune from this, either, you know, it just is a part of what we partake in in our culture.
9527000	9541000	However, any of us called what was happening with Bill and Ted, which by the way. Excellent. Yeah. And, you know, I, and, but on the same token like I don't want to like dismiss what you're saying, I have a feeling like you wouldn't listen to this show
9541000	9555000	if you didn't understand my perspective and entertainment is a frequent emailer of this show so I think he gets that to an extent, but I do so I want to say, I do understand your frustration because there are certain things out there that are so goddamn unbelievable
9555000	9572000	and I don't understand why they gain as much motion as they do online sometimes, and that does happen in gaming as well. So it's, I to that end I do understand the frustration, but there are some things out there that do end up coming true.
9573000	9585000	Also other comments in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network, Bobby Blackwell says if you want to show that has no rumors, check out the Bobby Blackwell show now on Amazon music, look.
9585000	9589000	You didn't have to rub it in with the Amazon music part.
9589000	9600000	Yeah, and you know what I that's that's an editorial choice. And there are, yes, there are differences between our two shows, it's fine. You can have different things.
9600000	9614000	Let's see, also, black compat says one of my aunts keep sharing this picture of Jesus that she loves. It's actually Jonathan Van Ness from queer I, and I don't have the desire to correct her.
9614000	9627000	I know it's fucking hilarious. I love that story because I know exactly what picture you're talking about because I see it on Twitter all the time. And I love that.
9627000	9640000	But it's also black compat, correct me if I'm wrong but isn't it one of those things where it's just kind of like, sh, wink, you know like, don't tell her.
9640000	9653000	Dude, I do this stuff to piss off my mom on purpose. Dan tells me not to antagonize my mother. But when my mother is posting like, you know, tyrant shit. I'm gonna do it.
9653000	9668000	I'm gonna do it. You know, that's my job as a daughter, and I don't, I don't mean to be dark or depressing or anything but there are times when, and please do not misunderstand what I'm about to say, I miss my mother every single day I miss her so much.
9668000	9683000	But at the same time, I'm so happy she doesn't have to deal with this year. I'm so happy I don't have to see how my mom dealt with 2020 on that on that token so sorry I know that seems that's like a dark deep place type of thing but it's just it's just the honest
9683000	9694000	honest to God truth with everything out there on social media and she was starting to use Facebook more and use Twitter. And when she had a Twitter account she made me delete it because she said, I'm being followed by too many porn.
9694000	9698000	There's too much porn on Twitter they all follow me and they're all, they're all.
9698000	9700000	They're all sluts that follow me on Twitter.
9700000	9702000	Rob. What?
9702000	9705000	I'm just saying. Oh.
9705000	9708000	Yeah, but I just instinctively responded.
9708000	9711000	I know I miss her a lot. All right, anyway.
9711000	9713000	On to other topics.
9713000	9720000	My favorite thing to do is send mom like archaeological articles about Jesus not being white.
9720000	9722000	I'm sure she loves it.
9722000	9739000	But I mean, the thing is, okay, so you can not follow rumors all you want to and I always you know make my granddaddy always said consider the source and that's what we do you know, if we're going to post a rumor, we're going to do something that's relevant
9739000	9751000	and trust number one like the mass effect one right right and we're also going to try to find as reliable sources as we can things that have been posted as listings things that could have some credence to them.
9751000	9757000	Yes, so if you don't like it. Well, you can skip that part of the show.
9757000	9768000	Let me, but let me also say something and because you reminded me dark soccer with what you were saying about you know how you kind of process rumors and this is very important because again not every gamer does this but I do.
9768000	9778000	And this is why every time we do talk about a rumor on this show I'm like, take this with a grain of salt, or do not let this be an expectation that is so important.
9778000	9788000	If you're going to talk about a rumor if you're gonna get into a rumor, please do not set that expectation. And yes, that even goes for me and Mass Effect, if they don't ever release the Mass Effect trilogy.
9788000	9804000	They never said they were going to I really don't have a right to be disappointed. The only thing I can be disappointed in is the fact that I fell for all these rumors but there are a lot of rumors about the Mass Effect trilogy Okay, but you cannot set your expectations
9805000	9820000	at the rumor level and that is so important and so many people miss that mark in gaming. They, they, I'm pissed that Sony didn't show this. Well, why did you ever think Sony was going to show it in the first place it was some stupid rumor you read on Twitter, or
9820000	9833000	the Nintendo Direct shit notorious for that right some fake mock up some fake I'm pissed they didn't reveal a smash character today like you know I read about girl somebody lied to you, it happens.
9833000	9841000	Remember we they troll you on fall guys where they can't see your reaction you better believe they troll you on social media where they can.
9841000	9845000	Anyway, moving on sorry. I said to get that point out.
9845000	9858000	Hi, next email. Yes please. Last email. Okay, greetings one and all it's been a while since I dropped an email through and I figured I was long overdue. What I'm about to say has been on my mind for a while.
9858000	9861000	Oh shit everyone's letting it out.
9861000	9869000	A friend of mine said that he was sorry I was getting an Xbox Series X and so the PlayStation five. I mean, why would he be sorry.
9869000	9878000	Because the PS five is better, some systems are basically the same hardware across the board along with similar technology wise man on set a system.
9878000	9886000	I am not a man. Okay, system is as good as the games that are on it. I said that.
9886000	9889000	Jamie, I'm so sorry that you're not me.
9889000	9901000	I'm just so that's what that cool reason the whole like, I'm sorry you're not getting a place by Jamie I'm so sorry you're not me, like, I know everybody wants to be at this level but you just can't.
9901000	9903000	I'm sorry.
9903000	9909000	You know what, what, I don't need your sorry you keep your pity party to yourself.
9909000	9916000	Given the massive history, given the massive library of Xbox games from the last three consoles that can be played on the new system I'm here for it, damn it.
9916000	9927000	To be fair, I really am not impressed with either systems lineup of games sunny fanboys say the SBS x is worthless because first party games are going to be on PC.
9927000	9942000	Hey sunny fanboys PS fives first party games are slowly trickling their way over. There's no such thing as exclusivity either. I mean, think about it, a year after the game comes out it will be on PC or other consoles to have seen Sony fanboys
9942000	9952000	backwards compatibility because no one wants it excuse you they're still allowed demand for it. Just because Sony is too lazy to do that with PS five that does not mean that there's no demand for it.
9952000	9964000	And truthfully, that's why I picked up the Xbox it's. I like the fact that I have one system to play these amazing titles. For the record, I still have my 360 connected for those incompatible games.
9964000	9975000	Also, let us not forget that a lot of gamers don't have the space for all the consoles, and I am no exception to that. Side note for me I wonder if it's going to feel as badly as the last Xbox did in Japan.
9975000	9977000	Anyway, going forward.
9977000	9987000	We're really at that point where there is no dominant console of the generation, each company has their own direction. And while we're on the subject of game pass and Xbox.
9988000	10004000	Sorry, Xbox games on PC. The big thing I hear is Xbox series that s x is worthless since the games you can play on a PC. Listen, I have a high end PC that I can play triple A titles on, but I use it for multimedia streaming and other projects first and gaming.
10004000	10010000	Besides, I'm more comfortable playing video games on a big screen TV and lounging in my gaming chair or bed.
10010000	10026000	Overall, it doesn't matter what console we buy we're all winners we're all going to end up buying both consoles. No, I'm not. I know I am buying a PS five, not now but later because the one game I went for Horizon Forbidden West coming out to PS four.
10026000	10039000	If I wait about a year or so after the game comes out there will be a greatest its version with all the DLC it's a win win for me. Well that's it forgive me for jumping all around in this email and quite a scatterbrain and it's hard for me to keep my thoughts
10039000	10056000	on tangent before do you mean target before derailing into something else I mean my thoughts are always on tangent I mean, listen to me. I mean you have, have you listened to my podcast XD stay, stay safe out there and may the force be with y'all run.
10056000	10068000	Well thank you for the email Rama and honestly like there's there's not a lot for me to argue with I feel like you and I are on the same page here, and we're not always on the same page when it comes to, you know, Microsoft and Sony and all that stuff
10068000	10081000	but that's that's okay and it's really silly that your friend was said what they said because that's really ridiculous everybody has to get what works for them and their situation and that is so different.
10081000	10084000	Rob I'm sorry you're not me.
10084000	10086000	Right.
10086000	10088000	I'm sorry.
10088000	10094000	I'm not I'm not sorry you know I'm not sorry, because I'm fucking amazing and none of y'all can be me.
10094000	10097000	Just saying, I'll try harder, I'll strive every day.
10098000	10109000	Alright, great emails this week you guys loved them all so I probably like that email segment tonight, participate at orange lounge radio.com. If you want to send us more emails for a future week.
10109000	10124000	We do have at least one question from the chat I want to get to for our roundtable tonight. And that question comes from no one special 77 who says, so all of us are gamers, and we have been gaming for what seems like forever probably since the 80s or the 90s
10124000	10140000	maybe even the 70s depending on who you are. I'll pose this question. Do you have any favorite fond gaming memories, first time to an arcade, getting that coveted system for Christmas as a kid, saving up your hard earned money to buy a game or system totally on your own,
10140000	10157000	played a game with a relative that has since passed. Alright, I mean I do feel like over the 800 plus history of this show. We've probably told all these stories before, but I'm fine with indulging it because gaming memories are nice, and in 2020, we need a little more nice.
10157000	10165000	So would anyone like to indulge in no one special with some gaming memories some fond gaming memories, anyone.
10166000	10173000	Pretending that I had the flu so I could stay home and play Final Fantasy six.
10173000	10176000	That was pretty great, because I didn't have to go to school. Yep.
10176000	10179000	How did you fake the flu.
10179000	10191000	Did you know I just sat on the floor and had a blanket on and drink so much hot fluid that they did it registered as a temperature.
10191000	10202000	Since I brought up my mom, I will invoke that with my answer because I she was really not into technology or computers or any of that stuff at all, very much not her.
10202000	10217000	So I really was never going to be able to get her to play a video game with me but the closest I could get would be on the Commodore 64, I could load up Wheel of Fortune or Family Feud, and she would play the game and just tell me what to type.
10217000	10230000	So she would be like, you know, oh we're going to play Family Feud I'll just tell you what to type in. And so we would play games like that and there was a short amount of time where the Atari 2600 was in my mom's bedroom.
10230000	10239000	So if I wanted to play it, I had to go to her bedroom and I know why she did it she did it because she didn't want me playing it too much. So she always wanted to kind of like be there to give me permission.
10239000	10251000	And if the Golden Girls was on we were not going to be playing Atari 2600 at that time which I now that I'm looking back I completely respect that was a good parenting decision.
10251000	10263000	The Golden Girls should come before the Atari 2600, but she would watch me play stuff on Atari 2600 she's kind of, she's like, I don't get it, but she'd still watch and then she'd kind of go back to her magazine or whatever else she was doing in her chair.
10263000	10268000	So, yeah, that's kind of like a gaming memory I remember.
10268000	10270000	You know, oh, go ahead.
10270000	10274000	I also remember when I lived with my lesbian parents.
10274000	10279000	We would, I would play Chrono Trigger and they would watch with me.
10279000	10283000	And that was always really a good memory. Nice.
10284000	10294000	Some reminiscing in chat and then I'll see if Loki has anything. Fifth Dream says my dad seemingly reluctantly once bought us a 2600 I come home from school and he'd be in my room playing a new game sometimes.
10294000	10310000	I didn't realize till later that he bought it so he could play too XD. There was never a game that my dad or my mom would play. Now the Commodore 64 I use that thing by far the most, but my dad would once in a great while.
10310000	10322000	Kick me off so he could try some railroad program my dad worked for the railroad for years and years till he retired, so it either be some railroad thing that he was doing like a railroad spreadsheet I don't know what he did I was, I was a kid.
10322000	10334000	And, or something like a word processing document or genealogy which is the other thing my dad's always Superman into he gets some genealogy software and he want to kick me off computer so you can play genealogy.
10334000	10338000	So, and that's what I called it playing genealogy.
10339000	10351000	Other comments in chat dark to see it says I know I've done this one before but I cut school today we got the original PlayStation and I ran into my tutor, while she was out getting something lol and I did graduate so it didn't hurt me too much.
10351000	10363000	Phoenix in chat says, I remember getting pissed drunk in college and playing battlefield four with a shit ton of people watching me, because apparently my copious and creative use of swear words was hilarious to a bunch of drunk college kids.
10363000	10374000	Good times. Oh, I know I've told the college stories about Duke Nukem in the college dorms in this show before good times at deaf says, my dad actually got me into pinball.
10374000	10380000	We always went to the arcade and while I would play other games he would go to the pinball aisle and play some of the machines.
10381000	10389000	Super Mario Brothers. My mom would sneak into my room when I was a kid to play it. If I woke up she would yell at me that I was dreaming and to go back to sleep.
10389000	10398000	She got so good at the game. She knew where all the warps were and when the hammer brothers would come up and their patterns. She was speed running it before folks were running it.
10398000	10407000	I've saved that copy of Super Mario Brothers and put it on my dresser next to a picture of my mom and me so I can remember her fucking love that story.
10408000	10417000	And no one special says about my dad and the train stuff on the computer saying, Rob, did you derail his train of thought when he was working on that spreadsheet or program?
10420000	10423000	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10423000	10432000	I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I rolled the credits, Jamie. You guys probably couldn't hear it on your side.
10432000	10444000	All right. All right. Anyway, we're done, I guess. All right. Moving on. Loki, you didn't get to share yours.
10445000	10453000	I mean, there's a lot of stuff. It's just like going to like some of the Nickel City stuff. That was pretty fun doing that with my friends.
10453000	10462000	We used to go to all of the different shops that had arcade games back in the 90s. So like we'd stop by the 7-Eleven, play the Street Bear 2.
10462000	10468000	And then there was a Captain Commando at one of the local diners. There was a movie theater that had like a bunch of other games.
10468000	10477000	And we used to stop at Rico's Pizza to play some super off-road and stuff like that. So lots of fun stuff.
10477000	10485000	And then, of course, my modded Grand Theft Auto games, some of the best gaming experiences ever, which never be topped, unfortunately.
10488000	10496000	All right. Good memories. Good times. Love it. Love it. All right. I think with that, we're about at the point where we're gonna wrap this up.
10496000	10504000	So it's time to wrap last minute stories. Oh, God, of course. I'm so sorry. I forgot to ask for last minute stories. Please, Loki, go for it, please.
10504000	10513000	All right. So there's this company, ICE, who stands for Interactive Concepts of Entertainment.
10513000	10524000	And they're an arcade game manufacturing company. They are now going to be doing home arcade games similar to Arcade 1UP.
10524000	10534000	So they've registered a brand new site, homearcadegames.com, and they have kind of a preview, like a picture showing some of the stuff that may be coming.
10534000	10543000	Of this, lots of stuff that you wouldn't normally expect. So, for example, some non-traditional arcade games like Ice Ball, which is skee-ball.
10543000	10557000	They've got, looks like a, I'm pretty excited about this one. So one of my kids' favorite games of playing the arcade is the raw thrills Jurassic Park arcade game.
10557000	10567000	That's one of the cabinets that they're showing there. Wow. And then Super Chex Pro, which is kind of like a ice hockey game that you can play, kind of like a foosball or something like that.
10567000	10577000	They've got the Star Wars home pin, Stearns pinball, Namco Class of 81 with Pac-Man and Galaga.
10577000	10588000	And also there was a, it was a collegiate hoops, which is a basketball arcade game where you, you know, the actual throwing basketballs into the hoops and stuff like that.
10588000	10595000	So that's pretty cool kind of offset of just regular traditional cabinets, but man, that Jurassic Park game.
10595000	10606000	Yeah. PixelPockets in chat, because you brought up arcade cabinets, is asking, did you all hear about that Neo Geo MVSX arcade machine?
10606000	10613000	I do believe it came up a week or two ago in our rapid fire segment. And yeah, that sounds pretty rad too, honestly. Yeah, I kind of want one of those.
10614000	10622000	So they're going to start announcing stuff starting October 2020 is when they're going to have their first set of games available.
10622000	10629000	So it'd be interesting to check out what they're doing with that. Apparently there's going to be more partnerships though with Raw Thrills.
10629000	10635000	So I'm curious to see what comes out of that because they have a lot of interest in games. So interesting. Yeah.
10635000	10642000	And PixelPockets says this home arcade games concept seems cool. Yeah, it's kind of, these arcade collectibles are really growing, huh?
10642000	10651000	Like this whole arcade one up thing, I think kind of showed like, yes, yes, Gen Xers and millennials as they get older, yes, they will pay for this shit.
10651000	10654000	So I think it's, they found something.
10654000	10657000	I mean, our financial futures are already in the toilet, so why not?
10657000	10658000	Exactly.
10658000	10661000	And who knows when arcades are going to open again, so you know.
10661000	10662000	That's right.
10662000	10663000	And that's what it is.
10663000	10665000	I forgot what they are.
10665000	10672000	I have a friend who's moving into a new house and is already planning one of the rooms to be a full on arcade.
10672000	10676000	And the reasoning behind it is that there's no arcades anymore.
10676000	10678000	So you know what? I'm going to put one in my house.
10678000	10680000	And obviously you see a lot of people doing this.
10680000	10690000	There's countless numbers of YouTubers that have tours of their either basement arcade, garage arcade, probably attic arcade, spare bedroom arcades.
10690000	10692000	And you think of it.
10692000	10693000	They've got it.
10693000	10696000	Turning the in-law house into an arcade.
10696000	10697000	All of it.
10697000	10698000	That'd be amazing.
10698000	10699000	Yeah.
10699000	10702000	So and Bobby Bockel says, I'm converting your room into an arcade.
10702000	10704000	It's a storage room right now.
10704000	10712000	Well, I really hope Dragon Con 2021 is back in person and after all of this, so to speak, so that I can come see it.
10712000	10713000	I do hope so.
10713000	10715000	All right.
10715000	10717000	Anyhow, any other last minute stories?
10717000	10719000	That was a good one.
10719000	10720000	No, that's it.
10720000	10722000	Well, I had nothing.
10722000	10724000	All right. Well, then I think we will wrap up the show.
10724000	10727000	We're after nine o'clock or midnight on the East Coast anyway.
10727000	10728000	It's been a long show tonight.
10728000	10729000	We had a lot of news.
10729000	10732000	So anyway, I want to thank you guys for staying up late with us.
10732000	10738000	If you're listening live or listening to the whole thing, if you're on our podcast feed, we appreciate you guys for sticking with us.
10738000	10741000	Rumors and all throughout another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10741000	10745000	If you like what you heard here at the show, tell a friend or 20 about the show.
10745000	10748000	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
10748000	10753000	But if we can't get the voices here to participate with us, we can't get the voices out there.
10753000	10759000	And I think that's one thing we have heard time and time again just on tonight's show is that every gamer is different.
10759000	10761000	And everybody's situation is different.
10761000	10764000	And we've heard that applied all sorts of ways tonight.
10764000	10777000	And that just is important why we need that diversity of opinions here to really try to put our feet in other people's shoes and understand why somebody might think a different way or choose a different system or whatever it is that we're talking about.
10778000	10781000	So, really appreciate that. Thank you guys who help us spread the word.
10781000	10785000	Auto hosting on Twitch for VOG Network goes a very long way.
10785000	10788000	And you can do that anytime. You don't have to just do that on Sunday night.
10788000	10791000	That is super helpful. And thank you so much.
10791000	10797000	And thank you those you guys that leave a nice review to like a five star review on iTunes or wherever it is that you found this show.
10797000	10799000	Those things go an awful long way.
10799000	10805000	And don't forget to participate with us on Discord as well over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
10805000	10816000	All right, enough plugs. I think we can go around and get everybody's final thought. I will start with Jamie because you're on top tonight in the site on the TV so dark soccer you're a final thought tonight.
10816000	10822000	Um, well Rosh Hashanah is already over but to my fellow Jew people.
10822000	10824000	Let's turn out to have.
10824000	10831000	And during if you observe during Yom Kippur have an easy fast.
10831000	10833000	All right.
10833000	10836000	And Loki your final thought.
10836000	10845000	Keep working on I'm still working on stuff. Hopefully I'm trying to get to a point where I can announce something so soon, hopefully.
10845000	10862000	All right. And then my final thought of course I want to say, of course, and I totally agree with folks in chat, rest in power to Ruth Bader Ginsburg and thank you so much for everything, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and a lot of the very important and historic decisions that you've had a part of.
10862000	10868000	And in the very very wise words of a very very talented drag queen.
10868000	10872000	I'm not going to panic, because I don't do that anymore.
10872000	10874000	Everything's gonna be okay.
10874000	10875000	All right.
10875000	10881000	I just don't like the one Rob went in trouble, fear and doubt, run in circles scream and shout.
10881000	10883000	That's fine too. That's fine.
10883000	10887000	Whatever you've got to do to cope with the situation. All right.
10887000	10896000	And on that note, we're going to end Orange Lounge AO for tonight, maybe some of you are going to play some video games to deal with things and get out to get out your feelings over the next seven days with some video games.
10896000	10903000	Have fun, be safe, be kind. Have a good week everybody we'll see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.
