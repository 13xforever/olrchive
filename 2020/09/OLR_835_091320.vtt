WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.800
The masters of getting you to buy the same game multiple times do it again, bringing

00:12.800 --> 00:16.600
the NES Mario Bros. games to the Nintendo Switch with improved graphics, by which they

00:16.600 --> 00:19.880
mean the improved graphics as they had in their first re-release in 1993.

00:19.880 --> 00:23.240
On the 35th anniversary of Mario Bros. we get back an old compilation of games, a new

00:23.240 --> 00:26.760
compilation of less old games, and a brand new Mario Battle Royale, all of which made

00:26.760 --> 00:29.400
for an incredible Mario-centric Nintendo Direct.

00:29.400 --> 00:32.680
These are my plans for the 18th, stay tuned to hear of your host's plans, Rob Roberts,

00:32.680 --> 00:36.120
Jamie Summers, and Loki, recently done and coming soon, starting right now on the show

00:36.120 --> 00:37.120
where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.120 --> 00:48.120
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

00:48.120 --> 00:54.240
every gamer has a voice, once again it is Orange Lounge Radio, back tonight with episode

00:54.240 --> 00:59.720
number 835 for this September the 13th of 2020.

00:59.720 --> 01:03.960
We are back tonight after being gone last week, thanks to Labor Day Holiday here in

01:03.960 --> 01:08.560
the US and Virtual Dragon Con, which I was fortunate enough to participate with, and

01:08.560 --> 01:13.240
I just want to start off by giving a big thank you to everybody over at Dragon Con and the

01:13.240 --> 01:17.560
Digital Media Track for having me on some panels again, wonderful panels, great set

01:17.560 --> 01:21.000
of panelists, I met a lot of great people and got to work with folks, and if anybody

01:21.000 --> 01:26.120
from that group is here listening tonight, whether live or on the feed, then great, welcome,

01:26.120 --> 01:27.120
hope you enjoy the show.

01:27.120 --> 01:32.700
I am Rob Roberts and joining me in studio, nobody, joining me in studio is a brand new

01:32.700 --> 01:36.880
little stuffed pumpkin spice latte, that's what we have here in studio as a new stuffed

01:36.880 --> 01:42.440
animal for the chair, sadly due to the pandemic in the world we are still doing the distance

01:42.440 --> 01:47.360
recording, so joining me via Discord, say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:47.360 --> 01:53.040
Hello, and by the way, the studio now is in the ether, the studio is in our hearts.

01:53.040 --> 01:59.400
Yes, the studio belongs to the people, it's much like the Harry Potter series, it no longer

01:59.400 --> 02:02.240
belongs to one person, it belongs to the people.

02:02.240 --> 02:08.040
Well, except we're not, you know, transphobic assholes.

02:08.040 --> 02:12.000
Alan is yelling from the kitchen, do the people pay rent?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
No.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.880
On our own places, yo.

02:17.400 --> 02:21.160
Hey, hey, you know what, you guys are always very kind enough, actually I see this going

02:21.160 --> 02:25.760
on right now, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv

02:25.760 --> 02:29.920
slash vog network, VOG network, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the

02:29.920 --> 02:35.360
Bobby Black Wolf show, and we may not charge rent, but some of you are very gracious with

02:35.360 --> 02:40.760
the bits and the subs, and if I see people, like Pod Culture, I don't usually read these

02:40.760 --> 02:44.880
out at the top of the show, but I will this time, Pod Culture just gave out 5 subs, thank

02:44.880 --> 02:48.600
you so much, Dark Soccer, you just gave out one, Bobby resubbed, I mean, there's, and

02:48.600 --> 02:52.240
Sia Dabiri as well, there's just lots of subs, there's a hype train going on right now, and

02:52.240 --> 02:56.960
so obviously it's no secret, we get a little bit of kickback from that that we can use

02:56.960 --> 03:01.960
to reinvest into the network, because running a business is expensive, yo, so we really

03:01.960 --> 03:05.360
appreciate all that, so it may not be rent, but we appreciate all the subs, especially

03:05.360 --> 03:10.460
with this month being the September themed month over at twitch.tv where there's discounts

03:10.460 --> 03:12.960
and all that good stuff, so yay!

03:13.920 --> 03:14.920
Sweet.

03:14.920 --> 03:20.320
That's right, alright, also sweet, say hello to, also joining us tonight, Techmaster Loki.

03:20.320 --> 03:21.320
Hello.

03:21.320 --> 03:23.320
Hi, how are you?

03:23.320 --> 03:24.320
Doing pretty good.

03:24.320 --> 03:27.000
Yeah, what do you have going on behind you tonight?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.120
That's not your game, is it?

03:28.120 --> 03:29.120
That's a different racing game.

03:29.120 --> 03:32.160
No, it's Hotshot Racing came out this week.

03:32.160 --> 03:36.560
Oh yeah, it's an Xbox Game Pass thing, isn't it?

03:36.560 --> 03:42.720
I think it might be, I have it on PC, but it's on Steam, and I think it's on the Xbox

03:42.720 --> 03:47.920
PlayStation 4 and the Switch, it's kind of a throwback to the AM2 racing games that Sega

03:47.920 --> 03:48.920
put out.

03:48.920 --> 03:51.160
Yeah, yeah, no, I was looking and I was like, is that Virtua Racing?

03:51.160 --> 03:56.500
It doesn't really look like it, but it could be, and I knew you were doing a racing inspired

03:56.500 --> 04:00.040
game at one point, it was one of your projects, and I was like, ooh, he's come a long way

04:00.040 --> 04:01.640
in the past couple.

04:01.640 --> 04:06.440
I wish, I wish I was releasing a game on consoles and stuff, yeah, that'd be awesome.

04:06.440 --> 04:09.120
Alright, well that game looks pretty cool, I'm gonna have to check that out at some point,

04:09.120 --> 04:11.960
I've missed that this week, but that looks fun, that is like something that might be

04:11.960 --> 04:16.840
up Dark Sakura's alley too, because Dark Sakura, like, hello, 90s Sega racing inspired

04:16.840 --> 04:20.920
game, like, that has to speak to a special part of you, doesn't it?

04:20.920 --> 04:25.800
Possibly, but I have Animal Crossing.

04:25.800 --> 04:28.440
There's other business to be tended to.

04:28.440 --> 04:34.720
I borrowed Horizon Zero Dawn from my friend like a year ago, and never played it because

04:34.720 --> 04:36.680
Animal Crossing.

04:36.680 --> 04:44.080
You can't hear the music from it, the music is also on par with those games as well, it's

04:44.080 --> 04:49.000
kind of a throwback to all that stuff, it's pretty difficult too, but pretty fun game.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.680
I'm gonna have to check out that game at some point, and then one other thing I need to

04:51.680 --> 04:55.960
address here at the top of the show, I know we were out last week, but just a couple of

04:55.960 --> 05:02.180
days ago, Loki, it was your birthday, so happy birthday, Loki, thank you, you have a birthday

05:02.180 --> 05:07.220
that's very easy to remember, unfortunately, yeah, unfortunately, oh, but happy birthday

05:07.220 --> 05:08.220
all the same.

05:08.220 --> 05:10.660
Did you do anything special for your day?

05:10.660 --> 05:14.500
I know it's weird with these whole pandemic times and a lot of places being closed, but

05:14.500 --> 05:16.100
were you able to do anything fun?

05:16.100 --> 05:23.340
Yeah, so like, I know like everything is frowned upon going out and doing things, but it depends

05:23.340 --> 05:24.340
what you're doing.

05:24.340 --> 05:29.540
Yeah, it depends, like, well, California, different counties are open in different capacities,

05:29.540 --> 05:35.740
so just up the hill from us, El Dorado County is a little bit more open, so they have their

05:35.740 --> 05:40.640
theaters open, and some of the restaurants are open for dining, so like, we went out

05:40.640 --> 05:46.620
to breakfast and then went and saw Tenet in the theaters, and there was only like seven

05:46.620 --> 05:49.340
people in there, it was really, you know, empty.

05:49.340 --> 05:52.180
I can't imagine a lot of people are going, you know, y'all were wearing your masks the

05:52.180 --> 05:54.060
whole time, I imagine, except when eating popcorn.

05:54.060 --> 05:57.460
Just in the lobby, I mean, obviously in the theater, you don't have to because you're

05:57.460 --> 06:04.200
spaced out so far, but like in the lobby, they require masks, but yeah, it was all right,

06:04.200 --> 06:08.580
except for the theater, you know, had the volume turned way too high for the movie,

06:08.580 --> 06:13.260
so it was like kind of garbled in parts, and it was like, it was like sitting in a rock

06:13.260 --> 06:17.220
concert, like I had a headache by the end of the movie because it was so loud, like

06:17.220 --> 06:21.380
insanely loud, and I've, I watch a lot of action movies in seven theaters, and like,

06:21.380 --> 06:27.220
I know when it's turned up way too loud, so, but it was an okay movie, I liked it.

06:27.220 --> 06:31.300
My dad's birthday is the week before yours, and as you know, he's had a bit of a year,

06:31.300 --> 06:36.220
and I talked about that on prior shows, and he wanted to go out, we did outdoor dining,

06:36.220 --> 06:41.060
but I felt really like we were at a chain restaurant out in Roseville that like their

06:41.060 --> 06:45.460
parking lot is huge, and they had their table spaced all throughout the parking lot, so

06:45.460 --> 06:48.500
it wasn't like, like when I see outdoor dining, sometimes like downtown, it looks like the

06:48.500 --> 06:51.780
tables are all up on each other, and I'm like, I don't know how that's safe, but this was

06:51.780 --> 06:55.900
not that at all, so I felt like, wow, we have a lot of space between us and the next table,

06:55.900 --> 06:56.900
this is, this is alright.

06:56.900 --> 07:01.460
So I have to ask, is it the place that has C and J in the name?

07:01.460 --> 07:02.940
Yes it is, yes it is.

07:02.940 --> 07:07.380
Yeah, I had a feeling, yeah, they've got a pretty massive parking lot, but I'm glad that

07:07.380 --> 07:12.660
there's social distancing, although now with all the smoke out there, the AQI to date highest

07:12.660 --> 07:13.660
was 325.

07:13.660 --> 07:20.000
Yeah, yeah, this was last week before all those fires began, so it wasn't so bad.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.860
Before the evil gender reveal parties kill people.

07:23.860 --> 07:27.660
And I have to say something here at some point before we get into the gaming news because

07:27.660 --> 07:33.300
there's a lot of it, just our hearts going out to people affected by the fires up in

07:33.300 --> 07:38.420
Northern California, I mean that, I can't profess that I know anybody in Butte Creek

07:38.420 --> 07:42.180
or have even been there, but I do know that's just down the road from where I lived for

07:42.180 --> 07:47.120
a few years in Chico, which is a much bigger college town up in that area, and it's way

07:47.120 --> 07:52.200
too close to Paradise that already went through this three years ago, two, three years ago.

07:52.200 --> 07:56.040
I already know a couple of people who are just permanently moving out of Paradise, they

07:56.040 --> 08:00.520
come back after campfire and then we're like, nope, not doing it again.

08:00.520 --> 08:05.800
We have a mutual friend who left for Oregon, and it's even worse there.

08:05.800 --> 08:10.840
Yes, yes, and I was just about to say Oregon is really going through it right now too,

08:10.840 --> 08:15.820
so I thought I saw one person in chat earlier that said they were from the Oregon area,

08:15.820 --> 08:18.620
so just my heart's going out to everybody affected by this.

08:18.620 --> 08:24.440
This is so terrible, and obviously there's a lot of jokes about the gender reveal party

08:24.440 --> 08:28.060
and all that stuff, but these fires are much more than that.

08:28.060 --> 08:34.460
A fire of many fires was caused by that, but certainly the Oregon fire is a result of essentially

08:34.460 --> 08:41.380
climate change and all that, so it's, I really hope we can, as a society, figure out how

08:41.380 --> 08:43.060
to put it into this.

08:43.060 --> 08:47.180
It's really scary, and I know not a lot of people are out here on the West Coast, sometimes

08:47.180 --> 08:50.900
our news really centers on the East Coast, but let me tell you, this is affecting all

08:50.900 --> 08:51.900
of us out here.

08:51.900 --> 08:57.780
I have not left the house but to maybe go to a Starbucks drive-through in four days

08:57.780 --> 09:00.620
because the smoke quality is so bad.

09:00.620 --> 09:03.740
I can't breathe when I go outside.

09:03.740 --> 09:09.500
I actually picked up a respirator for working on my ball-jointed dolls because the stuff

09:09.500 --> 09:14.500
I have to spray them with is pretty toxic, and I ended up busting it out to go out and

09:14.500 --> 09:19.620
check my mail because since I had pneumonia, or if it was COVID, we don't know because

09:19.620 --> 09:25.060
it would test me, my lungs haven't really recovered from it that much, so I would step

09:25.060 --> 09:30.540
outside and come in and have to grab my rescue inhaler, and so we had to today help Dan's

09:30.540 --> 09:31.540
grandmother.

09:31.540 --> 09:38.500
She was giving us some plates and some old dolls and some 50s-era Pyrex, which yes, 50s-era

09:38.500 --> 09:46.220
Pyrex, but I ended up having to wear my respirator to do all that work, and then we had another

09:46.220 --> 09:50.980
errand to run, and by the time I got back in the house, my head was already throbbing.

09:50.980 --> 09:53.900
My skin is looking bad.

09:53.900 --> 09:59.820
Actually, I've developed a rash from the ashes in the air.

09:59.820 --> 10:05.260
For people out there outside of this area, like, oh, it's just some smoke, whatever,

10:05.260 --> 10:10.700
it's pretty nasty, and I even made a terrible, morbid joke, but I think my friends know me

10:10.700 --> 10:14.940
enough to know that I make this kind of joke, is like, now that we play the new game, is

10:14.940 --> 10:17.300
it COVID or smoke inhalation?

10:17.300 --> 10:18.860
It's pretty morbid, but it's accurate.

10:18.860 --> 10:20.780
But it's accurate, exactly.

10:20.780 --> 10:23.740
I went out to do a Pokemon Go raid, bring you into gaming a little bit.

10:23.740 --> 10:27.060
I went out to do a Pokemon Go raid at the park that's right near me.

10:27.060 --> 10:30.800
You guys know what I'm talking about, and that was it.

10:30.800 --> 10:34.020
That was all I could tolerate, and it was just like the smoke.

10:34.020 --> 10:36.500
It looked like Silent Hill out there.

10:36.500 --> 10:37.540
It looked like it was fog.

10:37.540 --> 10:38.540
The smoke was so low.

10:38.540 --> 10:42.280
It looked like Silent Hill out there, and just like when you're breathing in, it just

10:42.280 --> 10:43.280
smells like that.

10:43.280 --> 10:48.020
It's, I mean, a lot of people like the smell of smoke when it's coming from a Yankee candle

10:48.020 --> 10:50.500
or something, or a scented thing.

10:50.500 --> 10:51.500
Or a bonfire.

10:51.500 --> 10:56.220
But when it's like that, it's the choking kind of smoke, it is not pleasant, I'll tell

10:56.220 --> 10:57.220
you that.

10:57.220 --> 10:58.220
So, yeah.

10:58.220 --> 10:59.220
Anyway, sorry.

10:59.220 --> 11:03.320
Don't mean to deviate too much, but it's just, it is affecting our lives.

11:03.320 --> 11:07.480
I've stayed in and played, I have played so much Final Fantasy XIV this weekend because

11:07.480 --> 11:10.440
of this, it's like disgusting.

11:10.440 --> 11:11.440
But it's what I have to do.

11:11.440 --> 11:15.200
Yeah, I saw your thing on the crafting you were doing.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.320
Yeah, I'll talk about that in my gaming week.

11:17.320 --> 11:18.320
Sorry, Jamie.

11:18.320 --> 11:19.760
I'll share this with people.

11:19.760 --> 11:24.440
I actually have several Instagrams, you know, I have that at Dark Sakura, but I also have

11:24.440 --> 11:30.960
one that's called All With No Spaces or Underscores Where Sakura Is At, and that's where I've

11:30.960 --> 11:37.840
been putting pictures of the skies here and of course, you know, my vegetables and roses.

11:37.840 --> 11:43.080
But you know, it's what I made for going out and walking around when I could go out and

11:43.080 --> 11:44.320
walk around.

11:44.320 --> 11:50.280
But lately, like my last few posts have been what the sky looks like in my neighborhood

11:50.280 --> 11:54.080
and around and actually today when I was out in Folsom.

11:54.080 --> 11:58.000
Yeah, and here it's not really that red and orange stuff you were seeing out of San Francisco

11:58.040 --> 12:01.080
or Southern Oregon, like it doesn't look like that here.

12:01.080 --> 12:02.080
It just looks rust.

12:02.080 --> 12:08.960
Honestly, the Silent Hill comparison to me is it like it really does look like Silent

12:08.960 --> 12:10.020
Hill out there.

12:10.020 --> 12:16.280
So one of the pictures that I have is actually a pano and it shows like I was I was at the

12:16.280 --> 12:21.440
Elk Grove Auto Mall because I had to get my my car my oil change done and the pano was

12:21.440 --> 12:27.680
me going from left to right and you can actually see the thickness of the cloud of smoke and

12:27.680 --> 12:29.920
the difference it makes in the color.

12:29.920 --> 12:30.920
Yikes.

12:30.920 --> 12:33.760
So and I'll be happy to really get in the chat room.

12:33.760 --> 12:40.440
But just if you go to at where Sakura is at on Instagram, then I've got some pretty good

12:40.440 --> 12:42.400
pictures to show people.

12:42.400 --> 12:43.400
All right.

12:43.400 --> 12:46.360
Well, let's get into some gaming news, which we've talked a lot here in the opening about

12:46.360 --> 12:47.360
what's going on.

12:47.360 --> 12:48.360
IRL.

12:48.360 --> 12:51.440
We talked about Silent Hill and Pokemon Go.

12:51.440 --> 12:52.440
All right.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.160
Let's get into some gaming news.

12:54.160 --> 12:58.040
Let's start off with probably the biggest news item from last week.

12:58.040 --> 13:01.800
OK, Loki, do you want to do you want to start us off with the big, big item from last week?

13:01.800 --> 13:04.920
Yeah, I mean, there wasn't really any news over the last few weeks.

13:04.920 --> 13:07.400
It has been completely blown up.

13:07.400 --> 13:14.720
So it's a Nintendo finally put out a direct that was targeting the thirty fifth anniversary

13:14.720 --> 13:16.400
of Super Mario Brothers.

13:16.400 --> 13:21.580
So lots of announcements around that, of course, one of the bigger announcements is the Super

13:21.580 --> 13:28.500
Mario 3D All-Stars, which is coming out this week on the 18th, which is a combination of

13:28.500 --> 13:35.820
Super Mario 64, Mario Sunshine and Super Mario Galaxy one Super Mario Galaxy two doesn't

13:35.820 --> 13:38.860
exist in their world, unfortunately.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.220
I don't know why that isn't in there.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.020
That's kind of weird.

13:42.020 --> 13:43.500
Maybe they couldn't fit in the cartridge.

13:43.500 --> 13:47.220
I don't know, but it's not part of the collection.

13:47.220 --> 13:50.200
So that's going to be coming out soon.

13:50.200 --> 13:56.960
We do have, though, the original Super Mario All-Stars out as part of the Super Nintendo

13:56.960 --> 13:58.520
online library.

13:58.520 --> 14:00.240
So you can actually play that now.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.240
So that's available.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.240
Can I announce?

14:02.240 --> 14:06.080
Can I stop there real quick for you to get another news to talk about the 3D All-Stars

14:06.080 --> 14:08.820
and the original All-Stars a little bit?

14:08.820 --> 14:11.960
Anybody here on the panel picking up the 3D All-Stars planning on it?

14:11.960 --> 14:12.960
Sixty dollars?

14:12.960 --> 14:13.960
Yes.

14:13.960 --> 14:14.960
You are getting it.

14:14.960 --> 14:15.960
Yeah, we are too.

14:15.960 --> 14:16.960
Wow.

14:16.960 --> 14:17.960
I'm I'm in the no camp.

14:17.960 --> 14:18.960
I'm not going to get it.

14:18.960 --> 14:23.400
Well, then you can just you have to come over here and play it, then I'm getting it for

14:23.400 --> 14:24.400
my kids.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.400
That's that's it.

14:25.400 --> 14:26.400
All right.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.840
I know who's really into me.

14:27.840 --> 14:30.200
I am my kid.

14:30.200 --> 14:36.080
Both valid reasons for me, like I and it's not even so much the price tag.

14:36.080 --> 14:41.240
Like I understand that sixty dollars for three rock solid games and I consider Sunshine a

14:41.240 --> 14:42.240
great game.

14:42.240 --> 14:45.120
I know that one is divisive for some reason in the community.

14:45.280 --> 14:50.560
My problem with it is, is that I don't think this collection is deserving of the All-Stars

14:50.560 --> 14:51.560
name.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.440
I said it and I believe that.

14:53.440 --> 14:58.480
And if you want to reference what I'm talking about, go back to the original Super Mario

14:58.480 --> 15:02.720
All-Stars and look at what kind of collection that was.

15:02.720 --> 15:07.680
That was something that they really rebuilt from the ground up and put at a level that

15:07.680 --> 15:13.280
was brand new for that system that they were putting it on at the time on the Super Nintendo.

15:13.600 --> 15:17.120
When it came out, though, those were what they had as All-Stars.

15:18.000 --> 15:18.560
No, no, no.

15:18.560 --> 15:19.520
I understand what he's saying.

15:19.520 --> 15:24.560
He seems basically they didn't just re-release like emulated versions of the game.

15:24.560 --> 15:29.120
They rebuilt the games in newer engines and put it out there.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.840
And yeah, this is like hardly anything.

15:32.560 --> 15:33.840
We upscaled it a little bit.

15:34.960 --> 15:38.640
They turned on a feature on Super Mario Sunshine that was honest.

15:38.640 --> 15:41.440
I want to go back and fact check.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.400
Wasn't that there?

15:42.400 --> 15:43.360
The widescreen thing.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.880
Wasn't that there already?

15:44.880 --> 15:50.560
Because I know some games on GameCube like F-Zero GX AX supported the widescreen thing

15:50.560 --> 15:52.720
on HD TVs at the time.

15:52.720 --> 15:56.320
Now, I don't it's been so long since I played Sunshine, and I definitely didn't play it

15:56.320 --> 15:57.600
on HDTV when I did.

15:57.600 --> 16:03.440
So I don't remember if that was a feature, but I feel like 16 by 9 ratio in that era

16:03.440 --> 16:06.400
of gaming was not exactly unheard of.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.960
So it may be that they built it out and just enable it.

16:08.960 --> 16:09.760
I don't know.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.520
But I'm sorry.

16:11.520 --> 16:19.760
I don't find that that great of an addition compared to what these games deserve, which

16:19.760 --> 16:25.280
is the original All-Stars collection is not just a great collection.

16:25.280 --> 16:31.040
It stands on its own as one of the greatest video game releases of all time, period.

16:31.040 --> 16:35.360
And I would have just hoped that something labeled 3D All-Stars would kind of carry on

16:35.360 --> 16:36.400
in that tradition.

16:36.400 --> 16:40.000
And I know there's a lot of Nintendo fans out there that are going to say, ah, Phooey,

16:40.000 --> 16:41.520
you're just a hater, Rob Roberts.

16:41.520 --> 16:46.400
And I'm going to let my track record on this show speak is that I'm not a hater all the

16:46.400 --> 16:46.960
time.

16:46.960 --> 16:50.880
I will root for Nintendo and Sony and Microsoft when they should be rooted for.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.200
I will be critical when they need to be criticized.

16:53.200 --> 16:59.280
And this is one of those things where I'm like, I'm sorry, this collection feels extremely

16:59.280 --> 17:00.560
half-assed to me.

17:00.560 --> 17:05.680
And it's just they're going to go through on the strength of the original originality

17:05.680 --> 17:12.080
of these titles, many of which they've released before, like Mario 64 has already been released

17:12.080 --> 17:13.120
I don't know how many times.

17:13.120 --> 17:14.560
And I just feel like, you know what?

17:14.560 --> 17:15.760
I have my 3DS.

17:15.760 --> 17:17.440
I can play Mario 64 on that.

17:18.320 --> 17:21.120
I still have my Wii U for whatever reason.

17:21.120 --> 17:26.400
I can still play Galaxy and Galaxy 2 on that because I have those original Wii discs.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.320
I just I'm not about it.

17:28.320 --> 17:30.640
I just don't want to dig out the N64.

17:30.640 --> 17:31.440
And I get it.

17:31.440 --> 17:32.080
I get it.

17:32.080 --> 17:34.720
And again, I'm not to tell anybody else how to spend their money.

17:34.720 --> 17:35.680
And I get it.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.200
And I would lie.

17:37.200 --> 17:42.000
I would be lying if I didn't say I'm kind of tempted.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.240
There's a part, excuse me, I'm sorry.

17:44.960 --> 17:47.360
There's a part of me that's a little bit tempted.

17:47.360 --> 17:53.760
But then I think what really just kind of was like, oh, fuck it was when I heard that

17:53.760 --> 17:59.680
they're doing this artificial, uh, deadline scarcity tactic by turning up.

17:59.680 --> 18:04.960
You have to understand they never, they never purposely make their products scarce.

18:04.960 --> 18:10.720
It's just that they just can't, they just can't import enough, you know, data to just

18:10.720 --> 18:14.160
carry this title for an extended period of time.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.440
So they have to remove it arbitrarily in the end of March for no reason.

18:18.160 --> 18:23.200
This whole thing with them having the artificial scarcity by turning off the digital day.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.920
This makes me go back and really question when into, you know what?

18:28.320 --> 18:33.680
Maybe Loki was onto something all these years and all those times Nintendo said, nah, we've

18:33.680 --> 18:36.160
we're really trying to put out as much hardware as we can.

18:36.160 --> 18:38.720
No, we, we, we, the supply is just outside to me.

18:38.720 --> 18:40.160
We're really trying to put out the hardware.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.080
I feel like, God damn it, Nintendo.

18:42.080 --> 18:46.480
I'd stuck up for you all those times when it came to the hardware and rooting for you.

18:46.480 --> 18:47.200
Yeah, exactly.

18:47.200 --> 18:47.920
Here we go again.

18:47.920 --> 18:48.960
14 years now.

18:48.960 --> 18:54.880
So I mean, like we were rooting for you and now it's like, I, I can no longer say, oh,

18:54.880 --> 19:01.760
maybe Nintendo's trying because they made it very clear, very clear that they are interested

19:01.760 --> 19:06.880
in creating a scarce market to drive up the value of the game and make sure this game

19:06.880 --> 19:12.640
sells a lot this holiday season because Nintendo doesn't really have anything else save for

19:12.640 --> 19:15.040
a third party title we'll get into later.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.920
And I look, I get the COVID screwed everything up.

19:17.920 --> 19:22.960
I get that, but that's not a reason for this game to have the artificial scarcity.

19:22.960 --> 19:23.920
It's ridiculous.

19:23.920 --> 19:24.960
I hate it.

19:24.960 --> 19:26.400
I actually hate it.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.960
And I'm going to vote with my wallet on this one.

19:29.520 --> 19:32.320
Well, and they also said like the physical release of it too.

19:32.320 --> 19:36.880
Like, um, some retailers have been saying that it's extremely scarce, the quantities

19:36.880 --> 19:40.560
that they're going to be getting like of the physical version of this, because they're

19:40.560 --> 19:42.400
trying to drive the price up it.

19:42.400 --> 19:46.400
There's no reason why they can't print more of these cartridges.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.960
And I'm not, I'm no longer going to defend.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.200
I'm going, I'm no longer going to, yeah.

19:51.200 --> 19:54.560
I know there's some Nintendo fanboys and stuff out there that get angry when Loki goes

19:54.560 --> 19:55.360
on these tangents.

19:56.000 --> 20:02.240
Nintendo's action here of making this March scarcity day, I can no longer defend Nintendo

20:02.240 --> 20:03.680
when Loki goes on these tangents.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.200
Yes, I agree.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.960
They're making things artificially scarce.

20:07.680 --> 20:08.000
Yes.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.960
And to go along with that to even more frustration.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.360
So wait, I'm sorry.

20:13.360 --> 20:15.680
I know you want to get to the rest of the news, but I need to get chat comments.

20:15.680 --> 20:16.000
I'm sorry.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.840
Cause I've been ignoring chat and we do tape live every Sunday night at twitch.tv slash

20:19.840 --> 20:21.120
vog network.

20:21.120 --> 20:25.280
And fifth dream is in our chat room saying Nintendo is the Disney of video games.

20:25.280 --> 20:26.160
You know, what's interesting.

20:26.160 --> 20:30.480
I've heard that comparison a lot this week and talking about the scarcity, but guess

20:30.480 --> 20:30.800
what?

20:31.360 --> 20:34.720
Did you know the Disney vault is no more?

20:35.440 --> 20:36.800
There is no larger at all.

20:37.440 --> 20:38.560
What are you not sure at all?

20:38.560 --> 20:42.960
Disney, Disney plus has everything except song of the South, which is a whole nother

20:42.960 --> 20:43.280
Oprah.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.640
I'm not getting into tonight.

20:44.640 --> 20:46.800
No, they're still doing that stuff though with their movies.

20:46.800 --> 20:50.320
In fact, they're doing it now with the Fox movies too, that they're putting them in the

20:50.320 --> 20:51.280
vault, so to speak.

20:52.960 --> 20:57.520
I think it's still around, but yeah, it's less, less prevalent because now of the Disney

20:57.520 --> 21:01.040
plus stuff, but that's what they're, they're selling Disney plus is what they're doing.

21:01.040 --> 21:07.760
But the physical like DVDs and Blu-rays that stuff is it's still same as always.

21:07.760 --> 21:12.880
But, but no, but digital Disney did not make digital scarcity.

21:12.880 --> 21:16.720
In fact, everything is out on digital when it comes to Disney plus with the exception

21:16.720 --> 21:23.440
of, again, if you want to argue bits and pieces, there are certain problematic movies

21:23.440 --> 21:27.360
of the past that have these other separate issues and we're not going to get into that

21:27.360 --> 21:28.000
tonight.

21:28.000 --> 21:33.600
But the thing is, is that these other animated classics in their library, like Snow White,

21:33.600 --> 21:38.960
Cinderella, all this stuff that hasn't been on DVD and Blu-ray in years is now part of

21:38.960 --> 21:40.160
the Disney plus library.

21:40.160 --> 21:42.560
And they kind of tore that down, I suppose.

21:43.520 --> 21:48.560
Um, I was going to say to go into the March, once again, artificial scarcity.

21:48.560 --> 21:53.040
So the other thing that they're doing too, Super Mario Brothers 35, which is like Tetris

21:53.040 --> 22:00.160
99, but now with Super Mario Brothers, that's also only available until March, 2021 for

22:00.160 --> 22:00.800
some reason.

22:02.240 --> 22:03.920
I, you know, it's weird.

22:03.920 --> 22:07.760
This one I let slide because, and when, when that came up first, cause that was the first

22:07.760 --> 22:08.880
thing in the direct, I think.

22:08.880 --> 22:11.360
And when that came up first, I was like, all right, whatever.

22:11.360 --> 22:13.600
Maybe they just feel like the player base won't be there.

22:13.600 --> 22:17.440
Cause you know how sometimes like the player base is all there and then it's like, nobody's

22:17.440 --> 22:18.560
playing it online anymore.

22:18.560 --> 22:20.160
Everybody went on to the next thing.

22:20.160 --> 22:25.360
So maybe they kind of put an end date on it to, um, just kind of have the player base

22:25.360 --> 22:28.720
there for a certain amount of time and then go on to the next thing, whatever it may be.

22:28.720 --> 22:35.120
And plus, since it is a enhancement for Nintendo online, which we need more of those, um, I'm,

22:35.120 --> 22:37.920
I'm oddly okay with it being end dated in that case.

22:38.480 --> 22:43.600
I'm surprised that there hasn't been more announcements of games coming to the service

22:43.600 --> 22:48.320
because this is about the time everybody's, you know, memberships are running up because

22:48.320 --> 22:50.720
of the free memberships that they received with Twitch.

22:51.600 --> 22:53.840
Now's the time when that stuff's kind of coming back.

22:55.280 --> 22:57.120
What new stuff do you have for me?

22:57.120 --> 23:00.800
It's not really, I mean, there's this, but this is only until March.

23:00.800 --> 23:01.680
I mean, I don't know.

23:01.680 --> 23:04.880
There's not really a lot that they've announced that they have coming.

23:05.680 --> 23:08.480
Um, other games that are going to be coming out next year.

23:08.480 --> 23:13.920
So super Mario 3d world is getting, uh, re-released and they're also adding new content

23:13.920 --> 23:16.000
to that in the form of Bowser's fury.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
That's going to be coming out February 12th.

23:18.880 --> 23:20.320
Um, that's cool.

23:20.320 --> 23:21.680
That's a great Mario game.

23:21.680 --> 23:24.000
If you missed it on Wii U, you really should pick it up.

23:24.720 --> 23:25.920
Yeah, it is really good.

23:25.920 --> 23:30.960
Um, they also announced that they're going to be doing a physical gaming watch.

23:30.960 --> 23:36.000
That's going to have Mario or super Mario brothers and my brothers to the loss levels.

23:36.640 --> 23:42.160
As well as, uh, kind of a modified version of ball in there as well.

23:42.160 --> 23:46.800
So that's going to be available, sort of available.

23:46.800 --> 23:52.720
I mean, we're talking to Nintendo here, so probably impossible to find on November 13th.

23:53.360 --> 23:54.640
This is their version.

23:54.640 --> 23:58.240
This is basically what they're doing this year instead of a Nintendo light or what were

23:58.240 --> 24:00.640
those things called the mini Nintendo, the mini super Nintendo.

24:01.200 --> 24:04.240
Everybody thought, Oh, we're going to get them in mini Nintendo 64.

24:04.240 --> 24:07.600
And it's like, Nope, now you're going to get a mini game and watch of sorts.

24:08.240 --> 24:11.280
And maybe next year there'll be a Zelda game and watch of sorts.

24:11.280 --> 24:14.960
I don't think Nintendo is ready to do the 64 collection just yet for whatever.

24:14.960 --> 24:21.600
Well, why, why would they, when they're basically still valuing Mario 64 at 20 bucks in this

24:21.600 --> 24:25.120
other collection they're doing, wouldn't it be silly for them to put out the 3d all-stars

24:25.120 --> 24:27.120
and a mini 64 in the same year?

24:27.120 --> 24:29.440
Cause both are going to have Mario 64 on it.

24:29.440 --> 24:31.680
So I just, I feel like we're still a couple of years away.

24:31.680 --> 24:35.920
I think game and watch is kind of their idea of if this one does well, they'll probably

24:35.920 --> 24:37.120
do a Zelda one next year.

24:37.920 --> 24:43.040
Um, they showed off this new toy that's called a Mario Kart live home circuit.

24:43.040 --> 24:49.120
So it's actually a physical, uh, like RC car that you control with your switch and it uses

24:49.120 --> 24:54.320
AR and a camera that's built into the cars to create tracks and actually drive your car

24:54.320 --> 24:55.360
through the house.

24:55.360 --> 24:58.720
I don't have a house big enough for that, but, uh, my kids want it.

24:58.720 --> 25:00.640
So they're like, we have to get that.

25:00.640 --> 25:04.160
I'm like, uh, I don't know if we're going to be able to, uh, but that's going to be

25:04.160 --> 25:09.120
coming, uh, looks like on October 16th, no price announced for that.

25:09.120 --> 25:10.400
It's 99 99.

25:10.400 --> 25:13.600
Somebody leaked, uh, at least it was like a Walmart listing or something went up.

25:15.600 --> 25:17.440
Now, um, I will say this.

25:17.440 --> 25:21.200
I was very hard on Nintendo earlier, so now I'll give, now I'll give the good news.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.240
The fanboys stuff.

25:22.960 --> 25:24.560
This looks rad.

25:24.560 --> 25:30.560
Like I kind of just don't think I'm going to get it because my house is carpeted.

25:30.560 --> 25:31.680
I'm sure it works on carpet.

25:31.680 --> 25:32.400
Fine.

25:32.400 --> 25:37.440
I just, it would just be me, Alan, I think would walk in and go, that's interesting.

25:37.440 --> 25:38.720
And that would be about it.

25:38.720 --> 25:41.120
The cat would be terrorized by this thing.

25:41.120 --> 25:44.400
So I'm not sure I have a big need for this.

25:44.400 --> 25:46.480
I'm excited to watch other people play it.

25:46.480 --> 25:53.760
If I was the age of Loki's kids, if I was like nine years old or so, I would be all

25:53.840 --> 25:54.720
about this thing.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.200
I would want this so fucking bad.

25:57.200 --> 25:58.640
It is so cool.

25:58.640 --> 26:03.120
Um, but I, I'm not sure I can justify it for me now, but I can still look at it and go,

26:03.120 --> 26:04.560
yeah, that looks neat.

26:04.560 --> 26:09.040
And isn't that funny that the rumors were Nintendo was working on a new Mario Kart game

26:09.040 --> 26:12.640
for the holiday and everybody just assumed it was Mario Kart nine.

26:12.640 --> 26:15.040
Oops, oops.

26:15.600 --> 26:16.720
But this is cool.

26:16.720 --> 26:17.680
You assume.

26:17.680 --> 26:18.160
I know.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.120
Some other smaller things that they announced.

26:21.120 --> 26:25.520
So, uh, they talked about it, some more tie-ins with different things, new animal crossing

26:25.520 --> 26:27.360
content with super Mario brothers theme.

26:27.360 --> 26:29.600
Furniture's not coming out until March.

26:30.240 --> 26:31.440
Um, but it is coming.

26:31.440 --> 26:35.840
They're doing some splat fests that are gonna be in January, uh, Mario themed stuff.

26:35.840 --> 26:40.320
They're also going to have some actual t-shirts and stuff you can get with the splat fest

26:40.320 --> 26:42.000
themes that look kind of cool.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.720
Um, they showed some shoes.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.200
So, oh my God shoes.

26:47.200 --> 26:51.840
Uh, but yeah, I mean, so that, that's pretty much what it was.

26:51.840 --> 26:53.040
Guess what, everybody?

26:53.040 --> 27:00.320
These shoes are $300 on the Nintendo, on the animal crossing thing.

27:00.320 --> 27:03.520
Like obviously I know dark soccer is all about that animal crossing life.

27:03.520 --> 27:05.040
I love me some animal crossing too.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.640
We all do here at OLR.

27:06.640 --> 27:12.240
Um, but you know, let me ask this question because they're, they're remaking, remastering

27:12.240 --> 27:16.800
super Mario brothers one, the original light candy it's on the Nintendo online

27:16.800 --> 27:17.200
service.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.280
They gave it away again in all stars.

27:19.280 --> 27:20.480
It's on the game and watch.

27:20.480 --> 27:23.760
I mean, everywhere you're looking, there's a super Mario brothers one.

27:23.760 --> 27:31.440
So why not just for shits and giggles, put the damn cartridge furniture in animal crossing

27:31.440 --> 27:34.640
and let us enjoy the original super Mario brothers in our house.

27:35.600 --> 27:36.880
That would be a throwback.

27:36.880 --> 27:37.120
Yeah.

27:37.120 --> 27:40.160
Or like, how about have that furniture available?

27:40.160 --> 27:44.640
If you have a Nintendo online account and then like, say it, I mean, obviously you wouldn't

27:44.640 --> 27:47.120
be visiting for the pocket camp stuff.

27:47.680 --> 27:47.920
Yeah.

27:47.920 --> 27:51.840
So obviously they wouldn't have like, you wouldn't say for whatever reason, you didn't

27:51.840 --> 27:55.840
have the online, you could buy the furniture, but maybe you couldn't play it or something

27:55.840 --> 27:56.240
like that.

27:56.240 --> 27:58.880
You would need to have the online or the play this stuff.

27:58.880 --> 28:01.440
But like, yeah, I don't understand why they can't do that.

28:01.440 --> 28:06.640
I mean, it makes sense that it would work, but that would get me really excited if, if

28:06.640 --> 28:10.800
they did something like that would be a true throwback for animal crossing would be the,

28:10.800 --> 28:12.400
you know, NES systems.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.480
I'm not, I'm not even asking for everything.

28:14.480 --> 28:14.800
Okay.

28:14.800 --> 28:19.360
I just, just put the original super Mario brothers in there as a little throwback, which

28:19.360 --> 28:25.920
was that even unlockable and it was, it was rare to unlock it, but yes, it was.

28:25.920 --> 28:26.160
Okay.

28:26.160 --> 28:29.520
Cause I remember Zelda was in there and you actually couldn't get it without like a code

28:29.520 --> 28:30.160
or something like that.

28:30.160 --> 28:34.400
Like you, it never actually unlocked, but it was in there.

28:34.400 --> 28:36.560
And I think there was another game along those lines too.

28:36.560 --> 28:39.680
So yeah, Zelda super Mario brothers.

28:41.600 --> 28:42.960
I can't remember the other ones are like that.

28:42.960 --> 28:47.600
Power 573 says GameCube animal crossing was great with like the 20 NES games built into

28:47.600 --> 28:48.320
the game.

28:48.320 --> 28:51.920
What do you think was the bait that got me hooked?

28:51.920 --> 28:56.400
I wouldn't have, I would have never given animal crossing a second glance back then

28:56.400 --> 28:57.680
if it wasn't for that.

28:58.240 --> 28:59.520
And I actually remember Loki.

28:59.520 --> 29:04.080
That was, that was on you because you had a very nice situation because your work at

29:04.080 --> 29:06.880
the time you were the one that got me animal crossing in the GameCube.

29:06.880 --> 29:09.520
And I'm thankful for that to this day.

29:10.160 --> 29:13.920
But I would have never said dear Santa or dear birthday fairy.

29:13.920 --> 29:18.960
This is what I want if they hadn't said 20 NES games in it.

29:19.600 --> 29:26.240
You know, Rob, what I played animal crossing on Nintendo 64 when they had them on the thing

29:26.240 --> 29:27.440
out in San Francisco.

29:27.440 --> 29:31.120
And if I recall correctly, the Nintendo 64 version didn't have the games in it.

29:31.120 --> 29:31.840
I don't believe it did.

29:32.720 --> 29:34.080
I think it had a reduced number.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.280
I think it had like eight of them.

29:35.280 --> 29:36.080
Yeah, yeah.

29:36.080 --> 29:36.720
But did any.

29:37.600 --> 29:43.840
Yeah, it had Clu Clu Land, Balloon Fight, Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr, Pinball, Tennis,

29:43.840 --> 29:46.320
and it had the B tier games.

29:46.880 --> 29:50.560
And you could get Warriors Woods and Baseball from the island.

29:51.280 --> 29:56.800
And then you could also pick up Soccer, Donkey Kong Jr, Donkey Kong Jr 3, Clu Clu Land D

29:56.800 --> 29:57.440
and Punch Out.

29:58.240 --> 30:05.120
But it also though had in the game, you could do an e-reader for Mario Brothers and Ice

30:05.120 --> 30:05.920
Climber.

30:05.920 --> 30:10.720
And then for Animal Force Plus, you had a Famitsu giveaway for Super Mario Brothers,

30:10.720 --> 30:12.320
and then you could cheat to get the Legend of Zelda.

30:13.760 --> 30:16.320
But these were with the e-reader cards.

30:16.320 --> 30:18.240
They were like loyalty gifts from Tom Nook.

30:19.600 --> 30:27.360
But I mean, I didn't even know that they were in there when I was playing it on demo.

30:27.680 --> 30:31.920
In San Francisco, and I fell in love with it because I love this kind of games.

30:32.720 --> 30:36.400
So yeah, the moment the US one came out, I had it.

30:37.040 --> 30:38.560
You excited for the Mario furniture?

30:40.560 --> 30:45.600
It probably, it'll be more stuff to take up space in my storage, so I'll collect it.

30:46.800 --> 30:51.120
I mean, basically right now I'm selling off everything in my storage that isn't super

30:51.120 --> 30:54.640
expensive because now I can pretty much order anything.

30:54.640 --> 30:56.560
I'm working on my catalog right now.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.760
But yeah, I mean, I'll have it for the catalog.

30:59.760 --> 31:00.800
That'll be fun.

31:00.800 --> 31:04.400
Random Animal Crossing tangent, because that happens sometimes on this show.

31:04.400 --> 31:06.160
I saw the funniest thing on Twitter this week.

31:06.160 --> 31:11.200
It was a screenshot that was clearly done on Harvey's Island, and it had the dog.

31:11.200 --> 31:14.880
I think it's Lucky, the one that's wearing a bandage or looks like a money.

31:14.880 --> 31:15.920
Yeah, that's Lucky.

31:15.920 --> 31:20.240
And he's surrounded by bonfires and campfires, and it just says, this is fine.

31:21.280 --> 31:22.000
Yeah, yeah.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.120
That cracked me up.

31:23.840 --> 31:28.160
Although, um, I posted this a long time ago in my group, which I know you're

31:28.160 --> 31:31.840
not doing that thing anymore, but I'm Facebook free two months now.

31:32.560 --> 31:38.320
Someone made the ending of Midsommar in Animal Crossing, and I'll have to find it in

31:38.320 --> 31:42.240
LinkedIn chat because it's the most hilarious thing I've ever seen, especially, you know,

31:42.240 --> 31:43.360
how much I love that movie.

31:43.360 --> 31:43.840
I know.

31:43.840 --> 31:46.800
Look, I haven't seen it, but I've heard it's been kind of spoiled for me.

31:46.800 --> 31:47.840
I've heard about the ending.

31:47.840 --> 31:48.320
Okay.

31:48.320 --> 31:48.640
Yeah.

31:48.640 --> 31:52.560
And it's kind of like, that's kind of like somebody did that in Animal Crossing.

31:52.560 --> 31:53.600
That's disturbing.

31:54.160 --> 31:56.640
Well, I mean, we have Aika Village is back.

31:58.240 --> 31:58.640
All right.

31:59.200 --> 31:59.760
Moving on.

31:59.760 --> 32:00.000
All right.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.840
Anything else in the Mario Direct that we missed?

32:01.840 --> 32:03.600
We got too tangenty.

32:03.600 --> 32:08.560
Um, no, I think that's pretty much everything that was announced in that direct.

32:09.200 --> 32:09.600
All right.

32:09.600 --> 32:10.400
Awesome.

32:10.400 --> 32:12.080
Uh, let's move into this week.

32:12.080 --> 32:16.160
I mean, I guess we didn't talk about Mario Kart Tour, but I don't really talk about Mario

32:16.160 --> 32:16.880
Kart Tour.

32:16.880 --> 32:18.640
Oh, the cell phone game.

32:18.640 --> 32:22.080
I need to try it again now that you can play it in landscape mode.

32:22.080 --> 32:24.000
It sounds like about time, right?

32:24.800 --> 32:25.280
Yeah.

32:25.280 --> 32:25.520
Yeah.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.680
So they they're doing an event in there as well.

32:27.680 --> 32:32.080
Um, and then there's also something with a Super Mario Maker 2.

32:32.080 --> 32:37.760
They're doing an anniversary themed Ninji speed run course in November.

32:37.760 --> 32:39.680
Um, that's it.

32:39.680 --> 32:40.720
That's everything.

32:40.720 --> 32:45.600
I was hoping for my Mario All-Stars skin in Mario Maker 2.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.520
Wouldn't that have been the nice way to cap it off?

32:49.680 --> 32:51.120
I okay, maybe not.

32:52.720 --> 32:56.960
I would have liked to have seen the Mario All-Stars skin in Mario Maker 2, but whatever.

32:56.960 --> 32:58.560
All right, moving on.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.800
Let's get into what happened this week.

33:00.800 --> 33:07.440
So, uh, when we last left our adventures last week before the big break for, uh, Dragon

33:07.440 --> 33:13.840
Con slash Labor Day, we were still in a stalemate between Sony and Microsoft as to who is going

33:13.840 --> 33:16.880
to unveil the details of their console first.

33:16.880 --> 33:24.320
And in kind of a surprise twist, but not quite a surprise twist, uh, leakers beat them both

33:24.320 --> 33:26.880
to it and forced Microsoft's hand.

33:26.880 --> 33:27.520
Right, Loki?

33:28.400 --> 33:29.760
Yes, that's true.

33:29.760 --> 33:35.840
So, uh, the first thing that was leaked out was information about this brand new console,

33:35.840 --> 33:40.160
the Xbox Series S, which we already know kind of leaked out from those controllers that

33:40.160 --> 33:42.800
came out that were mentioning the Xbox Series S.

33:42.800 --> 33:45.120
So we knew it was a thing that was going to be announced.

33:45.120 --> 33:53.200
It just, you know, when, uh, so it was leaked out that there's video of it and the price

33:53.200 --> 33:54.000
point and everything.

33:54.000 --> 34:00.000
So it was leaked out that it was supposed to be $299 and it was going to be less, less

34:00.000 --> 34:06.240
powerful than the Xbox Series X, but, um, still, you know, going to be a next gen console.

34:06.880 --> 34:13.280
So that kind of, uh, forced then, uh, Microsoft in kind of a hilarious fashion to announce,

34:13.280 --> 34:17.840
to make that announcement, uh, official, uh, later on.

34:17.840 --> 34:22.080
So they finally did come out and say, Oh yes, you know, this is a legit thing.

34:22.720 --> 34:29.440
Um, then they also later on the week announced that the Xbox Series X is going to be $499,

34:29.440 --> 34:31.600
which is what it was rumored to be as well.

34:32.160 --> 34:34.880
Um, so a little bit more details on the Xbox Series X.

34:34.880 --> 34:37.360
Um, no disk drive, it's all digital.

34:37.360 --> 34:42.720
It's going to be, uh, basically targeting, uh, 1440p on the game.

34:42.720 --> 34:43.120
I'm sorry.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.080
I have to back up.

34:44.080 --> 34:46.080
That's not what I'm under the understanding of.

34:46.080 --> 34:50.880
I thought Xbox X has a drive and there's this, I know you're going to get into it, but there's

34:50.880 --> 34:56.080
another rumored spec that is the S the S is, Oh shit.

34:56.080 --> 34:56.480
I'm sorry.

34:57.040 --> 34:57.680
These names.

34:57.680 --> 34:57.840
Yes.

34:57.840 --> 35:00.240
I know S and X sound very similar.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.560
These names aren't great.

35:02.560 --> 35:04.160
These names are really not great.

35:04.160 --> 35:04.480
I'm sorry.

35:04.480 --> 35:06.640
That's like X Ray S like Sierra.

35:06.640 --> 35:06.960
Yes.

35:06.960 --> 35:07.280
Okay.

35:07.280 --> 35:08.480
So sorry.

35:08.480 --> 35:08.800
Yes.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.080
S has no disk drive.

35:10.080 --> 35:10.640
Sorry.

35:10.640 --> 35:11.040
Yes.

35:11.040 --> 35:15.200
S the one that S for speaker, because it looks like a speaker grill.

35:15.200 --> 35:21.760
Um, so the Xbox Series S is going to be targeting 1440p.

35:21.760 --> 35:24.960
Um, that's going to upscale to 4k though.

35:24.960 --> 35:28.960
Um, but this is more for like folks, like if you don't have a 4k TV and you just want

35:29.040 --> 35:32.400
to play the next gen games, um, the graphics are still gonna be better.

35:32.400 --> 35:34.640
It's still gonna have, you know, Ray Tracey and everything.

35:34.640 --> 35:36.720
It's just not going to be native 4k.

35:36.720 --> 35:40.720
It will be up to 120 frames per second though in 1440p.

35:40.720 --> 35:41.600
So that's pretty awesome.

35:42.160 --> 35:44.720
Well, uh, I'm going to tell you, here's the thing.

35:44.720 --> 35:49.280
I would imagine no one here on this panel is interested in Xbox Series S.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.680
I'm curious if anyone in chat is interested in this one.

35:51.680 --> 35:55.840
And I see this question going around Twitter a lot is who is this console for?

35:55.840 --> 35:57.200
Who's going to buy this?

35:57.200 --> 35:59.200
Um, I have two answers to this.

35:59.200 --> 36:05.920
Number one, um, there's going to be other countries where the cost of, uh, consoles

36:05.920 --> 36:12.640
is so expensive that the Xbox Series S is the only one that is like reasonable for people

36:12.640 --> 36:14.000
to probably import.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.600
And so the fact that it still will play kind of the current generation of games, I think

36:17.600 --> 36:19.520
is an important kind of selling factor.

36:19.520 --> 36:20.640
So I think you have that.

36:20.640 --> 36:24.960
I don't think it's just for, um, people in the U S that's for sure.

36:24.960 --> 36:28.720
Um, certainly there's going to be households where it's like, eh, we just want to play

36:28.720 --> 36:29.680
Madden.

36:29.680 --> 36:31.920
Then maybe a Series S will be for them.

36:32.480 --> 36:36.800
And some folks are thinking about, you know, it's like a second console for kids or whatever

36:36.800 --> 36:38.000
maybe for them.

36:38.000 --> 36:43.360
Um, the other thing I don't think many people are talking about, but I think is a very important

36:43.360 --> 36:43.860
point.

36:44.240 --> 36:50.080
Didn't Microsoft say last month, they are no longer making the Xbox One as we know it

36:50.080 --> 36:50.800
today.

36:50.800 --> 36:56.240
They stopped making the Xbox One and that means the Xbox One X, the Xbox One.

36:56.240 --> 37:04.400
So the Xbox Series X, God damn these names, the Xbox Series S is for people who want to

37:04.400 --> 37:05.920
buy a new Xbox One.

37:06.480 --> 37:09.520
And that's not to say that these games aren't going to look good either.

37:09.520 --> 37:13.360
Cause 1440 P upscale to 4k is still going to be pretty good.

37:13.360 --> 37:19.600
I mean, you're sure it's not native 4k, but a lot of games, like, especially out in this

37:19.600 --> 37:24.640
current generation, aren't native 4k anyways, they're upscaled from a lower resolution into

37:24.640 --> 37:25.140
4k.

37:25.760 --> 37:29.600
So it, I don't think it's necessarily going to be a game, you know, deal breaker for a

37:29.600 --> 37:30.160
lot of people.

37:30.160 --> 37:36.400
And to be honest, a lot of folks will rather take the $200 savings than, you know, have

37:36.400 --> 37:41.280
games look a fraction of the, you know, I guess the, the big difference would be, it's

37:41.280 --> 37:49.280
like having a really top of the line and PC running games versus a mid tier gaming PC.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.360
Both are still going to be fine.

37:51.360 --> 37:56.320
You know, granted one may look marginally better than the other one, but overall it's

37:56.320 --> 37:58.000
going to probably play the same.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.600
It just, if you really, really, really care about, you know, the quality and everything,

38:01.600 --> 38:03.840
then you'll get the more expensive system.

38:03.840 --> 38:08.960
And if you don't really care, then you can get the less expensive system and maybe it's,

38:08.960 --> 38:10.240
you know, size or something.

38:10.240 --> 38:12.080
I mean, that system is much smaller.

38:12.080 --> 38:14.960
They're saying it's 60% smaller than the Xbox Series X.

38:15.520 --> 38:18.720
You know, processor wise, it is less powerful.

38:20.880 --> 38:21.280
I don't know.

38:21.280 --> 38:24.800
I mean, I definitely think that there's a home for it with a lot of people.

38:25.520 --> 38:31.040
Plus when you consider that you're looking at the PlayStation 5, which it's got their

38:31.040 --> 38:35.760
all digital version as well, which is marginally smaller.

38:35.760 --> 38:37.280
I mean, it's just looks enormous.

38:37.840 --> 38:39.840
But I guess we'll, you know, learn about that later.

38:39.840 --> 38:46.560
It, I think they're just trying to be competitive pricing wise, because now, like, say, you

38:46.560 --> 38:51.600
know, I mean, we're in the middle of a recession, middle of like COVID, maybe people don't have,

38:51.600 --> 38:53.760
you know, that amount of money to drop on a console.

38:53.760 --> 38:57.920
$299 is a little bit easier of a sell, especially as part of that.

38:57.920 --> 39:00.560
One of the things that they announced is that they're bringing back the program where you

39:00.560 --> 39:02.000
can basically finance it.

39:02.000 --> 39:07.920
So you have like, I think it's like $25 or $35 a month, plus it throws in Xbox Live Gold,

39:07.920 --> 39:13.280
Xbox Game Pass, or I guess it's Xbox Game Pass Ultimate now, which is pretty cool.

39:13.280 --> 39:14.720
So it throws all that together.

39:15.360 --> 39:19.760
And, you know, that's just a really good deal, all that thrown together.

39:19.760 --> 39:25.680
Yeah, that's a really sweet deal, maybe for people that, you know, don't have all the

39:25.680 --> 39:30.400
money necessarily right up front, but are still interested in carry on gaming again,

39:30.400 --> 39:35.840
like Madden sports games or Halo or, you know, those key Xbox exclusives that they want to

39:35.840 --> 39:38.960
play, this deal makes a lot of sense.

39:39.600 --> 39:45.120
Not for me, but for other folks that maybe can't just drop, you know, $300 or haven't

39:45.120 --> 39:46.000
been saving or whatever.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.920
It makes a lot of sense.

39:47.920 --> 39:49.360
So a few more things I forgot to mention.

39:49.360 --> 39:51.840
Pre-orders start on the 22nd of September.

39:51.840 --> 39:57.360
So just a couple of weeks away, the Series X and the Series S are supposed to be out

39:57.360 --> 39:58.800
November 10th.

39:59.440 --> 40:03.360
And then there's still a rumor out there that there's going to be one more console

40:03.360 --> 40:04.880
that's not been announced yet.

40:04.880 --> 40:09.440
The rumor is that there's a Xbox Series V that's supposed to be an all digital version

40:09.440 --> 40:13.920
of the Series X, same spec wise as the X, but just no disk drive.

40:13.920 --> 40:18.640
And that's supposed to be somewhere in between cost from the X and the S.

40:19.600 --> 40:21.200
We'll see if that's a thing or not.

40:21.200 --> 40:23.840
But right now, let's just consider that this is it.

40:23.840 --> 40:27.200
And, you know, we'll wait to see what Sony responds with.

40:27.200 --> 40:30.880
Now the chatters, and I apologize, it scrolled, it way scrolled off the screen before I could

40:30.880 --> 40:31.440
get to it here.

40:31.440 --> 40:36.560
But the chatters were correcting me is that not all of the old Xbox Ones have stopped

40:36.560 --> 40:37.200
production.

40:37.200 --> 40:41.280
The Xbox One X, the kind of highest end one that did stop production.

40:41.280 --> 40:45.360
The one they're still making is the Xbox One S, which I think is kind of the budget

40:45.360 --> 40:49.520
Xbox One, which would continue to be like the budget console.

40:49.520 --> 40:55.520
But this still, I mean, the Xbox Series S still kind of replaces that Xbox One X kind

40:55.520 --> 40:56.720
of in the ecosystem.

40:56.720 --> 40:58.960
I still kind of know what I said.

40:58.960 --> 41:03.120
But Xbox One S is now, because that's like, what, $1.99?

41:03.120 --> 41:05.760
If that, it might be $1.49 at this point.

41:05.760 --> 41:09.520
That is the budget Xbox, which is still going to play a lot of stuff.

41:10.400 --> 41:11.680
And it will play a thing.

41:11.680 --> 41:14.960
A lot of these, at least the first party games are going to be compatible with it.

41:14.960 --> 41:16.400
So, yeah.

41:17.920 --> 41:23.120
Honestly, the only thing, the only problem I really have with Microsoft is doing is the

41:23.120 --> 41:23.520
naming.

41:23.520 --> 41:24.960
I think the naming is really bad.

41:25.920 --> 41:29.760
Like, look how we're confusing S and X, and they're too close.

41:29.760 --> 41:33.040
It just also sounds alike, and that's kind of confusing.

41:33.040 --> 41:40.160
It's not good, but the consoles themselves, I think I will probably, as of today, as of

41:40.160 --> 41:44.560
this moment, I am probably going to get an Xbox Series X on launch day.

41:45.760 --> 41:50.400
I can't say the same about PlayStation 5 today.

41:50.400 --> 41:53.680
Now, obviously, and we'll get to it later in the show, you guys watching live, see it

41:53.680 --> 41:54.640
on the sidebar.

41:54.640 --> 41:57.440
A lot could change this week with the PlayStation 5 showcase.

41:57.440 --> 41:58.320
We'll see.

41:58.320 --> 42:02.160
Something else about my situation that is very important that I think a lot of people

42:02.160 --> 42:04.320
are going to be kind of like, this could sway people.

42:04.320 --> 42:07.520
Either way, I have a PlayStation 4 Pro.

42:08.240 --> 42:09.840
I have an Xbox One.

42:11.520 --> 42:12.080
That's it.

42:12.080 --> 42:12.560
Period.

42:12.560 --> 42:16.240
Xbox One before they started out with all the numbers and the series, all that other

42:16.240 --> 42:16.800
stuff.

42:16.800 --> 42:20.160
So my point is, my Xbox One is kind of gaming technology.

42:20.160 --> 42:21.440
It's a few years behind.

42:21.440 --> 42:24.880
My PlayStation 4 Pro is not lagging behind so much.

42:24.880 --> 42:28.800
Something else that is really kind of wooing me on the Microsoft side is that Microsoft

42:28.800 --> 42:33.840
really kind of made that commitment to the whole library is going to move up and get

42:33.840 --> 42:39.600
upscaled and be new and have a fresh coat of paint, basically, on the Xbox Series X.

42:39.600 --> 42:43.680
And Game Pass is a pretty sweet deal.

42:43.680 --> 42:46.000
I'm a fan, I got to say.

42:46.080 --> 42:52.560
So all of that stuff combined is kind of putting me in Xbox Microsoft's camp today.

42:52.560 --> 42:57.040
Again, a lot could change this week with the Sony event, and I might have to break the

42:57.040 --> 43:02.640
bank and somehow be able to afford two consoles, or maybe I'll change my mind and get the

43:02.640 --> 43:03.840
PlayStation first.

43:03.840 --> 43:08.640
But as of today, in two weeks, I plan to preorder the Xbox Series X.

43:10.480 --> 43:10.960
So we'll see.

43:13.200 --> 43:13.760
Yeah, same.

43:13.760 --> 43:18.720
Just because I haven't really been I mean, right now, I'm not aware of what they're

43:18.720 --> 43:20.880
launching with over there, but like.

43:22.640 --> 43:27.120
I don't know, just seeing how they've handled this generation with as far as like cross

43:27.120 --> 43:32.640
play, mod support, all that stuff, I'm definitely leaning more towards Microsoft.

43:32.640 --> 43:37.840
It is unfortunate, you know, I have a large library of games there, like a huge library

43:37.840 --> 43:38.480
of games there.

43:38.480 --> 43:45.200
But I still have a PlayStation 4 Pro, so I could still play all that stuff.

43:46.560 --> 43:51.360
I'd be curious to see what they do with PlayStation VR a little bit more once we have some more

43:51.360 --> 43:54.640
announcements there, what that's going to do for how the games are going to look on

43:54.640 --> 43:55.140
that.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.960
I'm more interested in that, but that's something that could be later on.

43:58.960 --> 44:02.000
You know, I don't have to jump in on that day one.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.600
It's going to be interesting to see what happens this holiday, because there's a large

44:05.600 --> 44:09.040
segment of gamers out there and that game.

44:09.040 --> 44:10.080
And it's interesting.

44:10.080 --> 44:11.040
I'm just a lot.

44:11.040 --> 44:15.680
I'm not saying I see us all the time, but a lot of times the Nintendo fanboy kind of

44:15.680 --> 44:16.960
overlaps with this group.

44:16.960 --> 44:19.280
And that's the group that says, I don't like Microsoft.

44:19.280 --> 44:20.320
I don't like Xbox.

44:20.320 --> 44:21.600
I don't like what they're doing.

44:21.600 --> 44:23.520
And you kind of go, why?

44:23.520 --> 44:26.720
And it's, well, I don't like first person shooter.

44:26.720 --> 44:29.120
That's the Halo and the Madden and that stuff.

44:29.680 --> 44:34.800
And my comment to all of that is it is a different Microsoft now.

44:34.800 --> 44:36.000
It is 2020.

44:36.800 --> 44:38.400
Wake up, Nintendo fanboy.

44:38.400 --> 44:38.900
Wake up.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.840
And everybody out there, like if you're one of those people that's like, I don't, I just

44:43.840 --> 44:45.040
don't like Microsoft.

44:45.040 --> 44:45.540
Wake up.

44:46.720 --> 44:48.880
Don Mattrick is not running that company anymore.

44:48.880 --> 44:52.080
They have come a long way since Phil Spencer's been at the helm.

44:52.080 --> 44:55.920
Do you know how many indie games are on Game Pass now?

44:55.920 --> 45:01.200
And like what a good reception things like Tell Me Why are getting, which I think a lot

45:01.200 --> 45:04.640
of people are writing off and like forgetting that something like that exists.

45:04.640 --> 45:06.160
In the Microsoft universe.

45:06.800 --> 45:12.480
So I just, I think if you're one of those people that's, I just don't like Microsoft.

45:12.480 --> 45:17.520
I, you may have your valid reasons, but I want to challenge a little bit.

45:17.520 --> 45:21.600
Have you evaluated that stance in the year 2020?

45:21.600 --> 45:23.840
If you have, and you're still kind of not in their camp.

45:23.840 --> 45:24.480
Okay, fine.

45:24.480 --> 45:30.880
You tried, but if you haven't evaluated them in several years, I really think you should

45:30.880 --> 45:32.000
take another look.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.680
And that's, that's my opinion.

45:35.440 --> 45:36.960
There's just not enough out on it.

45:36.960 --> 45:39.120
Then it makes me want to justify the cost of it yet.

45:39.120 --> 45:42.160
There's nothing that has really spoken to me that much.

45:42.720 --> 45:48.320
I, and I, I do understand there's a lot of overlap with Microsoft and Sony, and I understand

45:48.320 --> 45:54.000
that it's kind of like, if you have PlayStation five, then Microsoft really has to, and they,

45:54.000 --> 45:59.920
they have been lagging behind in the first party studio, but I kind of feel like we're

45:59.920 --> 46:01.920
going to see it this generation.

46:02.800 --> 46:08.080
We're going to really see Microsoft push to be at that same level that Sony's out with

46:08.080 --> 46:09.040
their first parties.

46:10.880 --> 46:11.360
But we'll see.

46:12.880 --> 46:13.920
I'll, I'll be honest.

46:13.920 --> 46:21.280
I mean, even for PS five, all the stuff that I really want to play is on switch right now.

46:21.840 --> 46:26.480
I'm kind of like not excited about any of the stuff coming out on any of them.

46:27.440 --> 46:34.480
I mean, this is one of the first launches that I'm not remotely excited about anything

46:34.480 --> 46:35.760
really coming out on them.

46:35.760 --> 46:44.880
I mean, maybe resident evil village might be worthwhile, but yeah, there's just like

46:44.880 --> 46:48.480
not a whole bunch on here that really, really grabs me.

46:48.480 --> 46:49.600
I kind of don't care.

46:50.480 --> 46:55.600
I, I, I mean, like I said, it's one of the first ones where I really don't care.

46:57.120 --> 47:03.600
Not every console has had a bang up launch lineup and sometimes consoles don't really

47:03.600 --> 47:07.360
mature into their life cycle for a year or two.

47:07.360 --> 47:11.840
I didn't get a PlayStation three until little big planet was finally out.

47:11.840 --> 47:12.960
You know, this was it.

47:13.520 --> 47:14.960
You know, that was kind of the game.

47:14.960 --> 47:15.280
Got it.

47:15.840 --> 47:16.240
Yeah.

47:16.240 --> 47:19.040
You know, then yeah, second sign me up.

47:19.040 --> 47:20.480
I love all the Tekken games.

47:20.480 --> 47:22.960
I do think Sony's going to draw.

47:23.200 --> 47:28.800
I think where there's all this rumble, I think there's something to these silent Hill rumors.

47:28.800 --> 47:33.280
And I think that is going to be the thing that makes the PlayStation five highly desirable,

47:33.280 --> 47:35.040
but will it be a launch title?

47:35.040 --> 47:35.760
I don't think so.

47:35.760 --> 47:38.080
I think it's going to be a holiday 2021 thing.

47:38.080 --> 47:43.760
And I think COVID and that whole situation, especially has kind of put the urgency on

47:43.760 --> 47:47.680
adopting these new consoles right away on the back burner a little bit.

47:48.240 --> 47:52.880
But the reason why I still kind of gravitate towards series X in light of me, just saying

47:53.040 --> 47:59.920
all that is that Microsoft in the way that I haven't seen Sony do has made a commitment

47:59.920 --> 48:05.040
to, Hey, not only is this console going to play all the new stuff, but day one, we're

48:05.040 --> 48:10.560
going to play these optimized and new versions and new coats of paint and upscaled and, and

48:11.120 --> 48:14.240
making all your old games look great again.

48:14.240 --> 48:17.200
And that's kind of why I'm a little bit of Microsoft's camp right now.

48:18.000 --> 48:22.240
Cause it kind of adds something sweet to that launch that otherwise is missing.

48:22.960 --> 48:27.840
So I'll be honest, I'm probably going to still stick with, um, a PlayStation.

48:27.840 --> 48:29.520
It's not because of any Microsoft hate.

48:30.080 --> 48:36.720
It's just that, I mean, to be honest, the last couple of, actually all the last systems

48:36.720 --> 48:41.360
have had more games that I've wanted to play and I don't see any sign of that really changing.

48:42.800 --> 48:46.320
So it's, it's not the biggest of priorities to me.

48:46.320 --> 48:50.400
I'm, I'm, I'm probably going to stick with PlayStation.

48:50.400 --> 48:51.200
All right.

48:51.200 --> 48:51.840
And that's fine.

48:52.160 --> 48:55.520
But you know, and you've seen these, these gamers on social media and everything too,

48:55.520 --> 49:01.200
where it's like, I don't like Xbox and it's like, I don't, I don't like Apple because

49:02.880 --> 49:05.520
I don't like this one because I'm like.

49:06.560 --> 49:09.440
Everybody who's a hater, shut up and let people enjoy things.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.040
And we can agree on that.

49:11.600 --> 49:11.920
All right.

49:12.960 --> 49:13.600
All right.

49:13.600 --> 49:15.200
Anything else on the, on the Microsoft stuff?

49:15.440 --> 49:23.040
Um, no, that's pretty much it as far as, um, announcements for, um, Microsoft right now.

49:23.040 --> 49:25.520
So we'll have to wait and see if there's yet another system out there.

49:25.520 --> 49:30.000
Um, I did think it was kind of funny though, that one of the things that was shown on social

49:30.000 --> 49:36.640
media this week, uh, about the Xbox series S is that in the video where they were talking

49:36.640 --> 49:43.440
about the Xbox, um, series X back in June, there was actually an Xbox series S sitting

49:43.440 --> 49:48.640
on the shelf, um, in the back behind, uh, Phil Spencer or whatever.

49:48.640 --> 49:54.960
But, oh yeah, we never saw it because it looked like another book.

49:54.960 --> 49:59.040
Like it's, it's a funny little teehee headline now at this point, but honestly,

49:59.040 --> 50:00.640
how was anybody going to catch that?

50:00.640 --> 50:02.640
It looked like a white book.

50:02.640 --> 50:05.440
So it wasn't like the speaker side was facing out or anything.

50:05.440 --> 50:08.000
It just looked like another book sitting on a shelf, whatever.

50:09.280 --> 50:10.480
It's so funny though.

50:10.480 --> 50:11.120
It's cute.

50:11.120 --> 50:11.760
It's cute.

50:11.760 --> 50:12.000
Yeah.

50:12.560 --> 50:13.200
All right.

50:13.200 --> 50:16.240
Let's talk a little bit about the now and our gaming weeks.

50:16.240 --> 50:17.600
So we've had a little bit of time off.

50:17.600 --> 50:19.680
How was our gaming week or weeks?

50:20.240 --> 50:23.200
If we will, I'm going to just step away for a minute to get more water.

50:23.200 --> 50:24.480
Cause I'm, I'm getting thirsty.

50:24.480 --> 50:28.080
So dark soccer and then Loki, how was your gaming weeks?

50:29.120 --> 50:32.160
Well, I really just played a lot of animal crossing.

50:32.160 --> 50:38.880
Um, I mean, it's been a pretty busy week cause I am, I've got a promotion at work.

50:38.880 --> 50:41.040
I'm starting my new position tomorrow.

50:41.040 --> 50:44.560
So I've had other things on my mind and, you know, family issues,

50:44.560 --> 50:47.760
but animal crossing has always been like my go-to comfort game.

50:48.320 --> 50:51.360
And it's really been necessary as of late.

50:51.360 --> 50:55.440
Um, I, since I finished my other word game, I'm now playing word scapes.

50:56.240 --> 50:59.120
And, um, like they do this like dumb little tournament thing,

50:59.120 --> 51:00.640
like once a week or something.

51:00.640 --> 51:06.560
And I invariably finish in like between five to 10th place when I do it.

51:06.560 --> 51:08.160
So it's a fun little game.

51:09.120 --> 51:13.120
And for me, I like actually testing the vocabulary on these games

51:13.120 --> 51:15.600
and seeing if they actually recognize legitimate words.

51:18.080 --> 51:22.480
So I'm also trying to ease myself back into words with friends too.

51:23.200 --> 51:25.520
Playing with a few people and thank you.

51:25.520 --> 51:27.920
Thank you, Bobby, for the congratulations.

51:28.800 --> 51:30.000
It comes with a raise.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.040
That's makes me happy.

51:31.760 --> 51:41.040
Um, but, um, we also, um, are, uh, we traded off AC DC temporarily for another game,

51:41.040 --> 51:43.280
but I forgot which one it was.

51:43.280 --> 51:44.080
I'll be honest.

51:44.080 --> 51:51.040
So we've been playing some, uh, some pinball in the house and, um, we've got the, uh,

51:51.040 --> 51:52.080
the Saturn hooked up.

51:52.080 --> 51:56.560
So there's been some elevator action returns, uh, gaming going on.

51:57.120 --> 52:01.200
And, uh, some of that, uh, outrun for, for switch that's come out.

52:01.200 --> 52:06.160
And I, I think I played a couple of NES games on the platform on the switch.

52:06.800 --> 52:09.600
So it's been, it's been pretty okay.

52:09.600 --> 52:12.400
And thanks everybody again for the congratulations.

52:12.400 --> 52:13.440
I appreciate it.

52:13.440 --> 52:20.960
Um, but at any rate, um, uh, I, I'm still like, I don't know what it is, but I'm still

52:20.960 --> 52:26.400
so antsy to have an update for pattern that I basically am checking my Apple arcade

52:26.400 --> 52:29.920
every day, give me a new game, give me a new game, you know, update my game.

52:29.920 --> 52:35.840
So, um, yeah, that's it for me.

52:36.480 --> 52:37.120
All right.

52:37.120 --> 52:42.000
Um, so this week I was mainly, uh, just working on game building stuff.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.080
So I haven't played a lot of games.

52:44.080 --> 52:49.280
Um, I did of course play some Orna just to, you know, do that, have to do my daily wars

52:49.280 --> 52:50.160
and whatnot.

52:50.160 --> 52:51.600
Um, so I played a little bit of that.

52:52.160 --> 52:57.840
I played, um, hot shot racing, which is kind of in my background right now.

52:57.840 --> 53:00.720
Um, so pretty fun racing game.

53:00.720 --> 53:03.840
I've been kind of following the development of that for a while now.

53:03.840 --> 53:10.400
Um, it's definitely a throwback to the old Sega racing games and both, you know, in graphics

53:10.400 --> 53:14.880
sound, there's even some tracks that are kind of similar to the old games as well.

53:14.880 --> 53:19.200
Um, so definitely lots of throwback to that and like kind of Ridge racer stuff.

53:19.200 --> 53:20.880
So, uh, very cool.

53:20.880 --> 53:23.280
Um, been playing quite a bit of that.

53:23.840 --> 53:30.800
Uh, I've been having to play some of, uh, super or not super Mario Paper Mario and the

53:30.800 --> 53:31.760
Origami King.

53:31.760 --> 53:34.800
Cause my son wants me to fight the bosses for him.

53:34.800 --> 53:38.000
So I've been having to play some of that and help them out with that.

53:38.560 --> 53:40.800
So I still haven't gotten to play my save in a while.

53:40.800 --> 53:42.240
I'm still way behind him now.

53:42.880 --> 53:44.880
Um, what else?

53:45.840 --> 53:51.680
Uh, very little of Minecraft, although I probably want to get back into that, uh, as well at

53:51.680 --> 53:57.520
some point and maybe do some streaming of that mainly game development stuff that unfortunately

53:57.520 --> 53:59.120
I can't share with you right now.

53:59.760 --> 54:05.280
I really, really want to, but I can't hurry the fuck up and finish a game so we can, we

54:05.280 --> 54:06.720
can hype it here on the show.

54:06.720 --> 54:09.200
Oh, yeah, that's right.

54:10.080 --> 54:11.440
There's still the pizza competition.

54:12.080 --> 54:17.120
I I've shown, I've shown one of our listeners, what I'm working on only because I ha it was

54:17.120 --> 54:18.640
like, it was bothering me so much.

54:18.640 --> 54:20.160
Like I was going to put it out on Twitter.

54:20.160 --> 54:21.120
I didn't want to do that.

54:21.120 --> 54:25.920
Who I'm not saying speak up, who is it?

54:25.920 --> 54:27.920
No privately, right?

54:28.400 --> 54:30.000
Uh, privately except I've shown them.

54:30.000 --> 54:36.480
So, uh, but it's, it's going to be hilarious.

54:36.480 --> 54:38.800
It you're, you're going to love it once it's done.

54:38.800 --> 54:39.840
It's, it's very cool.

54:40.480 --> 54:46.080
So, uh, coming soon, hopefully in the next few weeks, I'm really rushing to get it done.

54:46.080 --> 54:46.560
Oh, I'm sure.

54:46.560 --> 54:52.480
I'm sure that'll bring great things for the project, but don't rush a project.

54:52.480 --> 54:54.160
Make it, make it perfect.

54:54.160 --> 54:55.520
The first time, right, right, right.

54:55.520 --> 54:58.160
No, I'm just saying like, I've been working on it a lot.

54:58.160 --> 55:03.600
I'm not jump, not just been like kinda, you know, an hour here, wait a couple of weeks,

55:03.600 --> 55:06.400
hour again, I've been working on it every single day.

55:06.400 --> 55:09.120
So, um, it's getting there.

55:10.160 --> 55:15.280
No, not like rushing it, like as in bad quality, I'm rushing as in, I want to keep working

55:15.280 --> 55:18.480
on it to get progress done with it, you know, so that it's, it's done.

55:18.480 --> 55:22.000
But, uh, you know, I've been working on gameplay stuff for it.

55:22.000 --> 55:27.360
Um, you'll, you'll understand once I, once I'm done with it, it's completely different

55:27.360 --> 55:29.280
than what I've been working on already.

55:29.280 --> 55:30.400
And it's not in unity.

55:30.400 --> 55:36.400
Well, somebody knows somebody, somebody does know the person that should know knows.

55:36.400 --> 55:37.760
So that's all I can say.

55:37.760 --> 55:38.480
Okay.

55:38.560 --> 55:40.880
Oh, I have an idea what it might be.

55:40.880 --> 55:41.440
All right.

55:41.440 --> 55:46.400
Bobby black open chat says, don't rush the project, but rush telling me what it is.

55:46.400 --> 55:48.320
I just want the listener to know.

55:48.320 --> 55:50.000
And now I think I know who it is.

55:50.000 --> 55:55.280
I think you just gave a clue there, but, uh, I just want that listener to know, you know,

55:55.280 --> 55:57.520
something that Jamie and I don't know.

55:58.080 --> 55:59.200
And that's not okay.

56:02.560 --> 56:05.120
So that'd be cool.

56:05.120 --> 56:06.480
I can't wait to share it for you.

56:06.480 --> 56:06.880
All right.

56:06.880 --> 56:07.600
No, we're excited.

56:07.600 --> 56:08.240
We really are.

56:09.200 --> 56:09.840
Uh, okay.

56:09.840 --> 56:10.560
Mike, give me a week.

56:10.560 --> 56:13.520
Um, I've been playing the, the location based games.

56:13.520 --> 56:18.560
Of course, Ingress, Pogo, Orna, not as much though, honestly, with the, with the heat

56:18.560 --> 56:23.840
wave, I was doing so good on my walk-in for a while and with the heat wave and the smoke

56:23.840 --> 56:26.000
and everything, like I just, I haven't really been outside much.

56:26.000 --> 56:26.800
So that was that.

56:26.800 --> 56:28.160
But I did, I tried to play a little bit.

56:29.040 --> 56:34.240
I fell down a rabbit hole in these past few days of crafting and final fantasy 14.

56:34.240 --> 56:38.000
I talk about that game a lot on this show because I do play it just about every night,

56:38.000 --> 56:39.040
every other night.

56:39.040 --> 56:43.840
Um, I'll get on and run a dungeon or two, usually with Shane, sometimes maybe some other

56:43.840 --> 56:46.000
people as well, just depending on who's around.

56:46.000 --> 56:49.600
Uh, and that's kind of been a thing, but I don't know what happened.

56:49.600 --> 56:53.680
Maybe it's because in this most recent patch, they did a minor update to what they call

56:53.680 --> 56:58.720
the Ishgard restoration in the game, which is a different way that you can level crafting

56:58.720 --> 56:59.680
and kind of contribute.

56:59.680 --> 57:04.560
Basically, it's like, it's kind of like a throwback to the on-carriage thing in World

57:04.560 --> 57:10.720
of Warcraft where everybody contributes projects that they're crafting to this project of hopefully

57:10.720 --> 57:13.840
creating a housing district in Ishgard at some point.

57:13.840 --> 57:20.000
But, uh, I, I have fallen and by falling off the deep end, I mean, I now have spreadsheets

57:20.000 --> 57:26.560
that I've created that I posted on Twitter, uh, uh, that, uh, track my gathering in the

57:26.560 --> 57:30.640
diadem and how many of everything that's the zone where you do all the crafting or do all

57:30.640 --> 57:31.280
the gathering.

57:31.280 --> 57:36.560
So it's like, it tracks and like, how many, uh, culinary, uh, turn-ins can I make based

57:36.560 --> 57:39.920
off these mats that I pulled from the diadem earlier today?

57:39.920 --> 57:42.000
So I have a fucking spreadsheet and everything.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.080
It's pretty nerdy, but also awesome.

57:44.080 --> 57:46.400
So that's been my life in Final Fantasy XIV.

57:46.960 --> 57:48.960
Um, I know, right?

57:50.960 --> 57:51.280
Right.

57:52.640 --> 57:57.840
I use an app, Animal Crossing, actually that app and Animal Crossing.

57:57.840 --> 58:00.640
Now there's like a thing on Twitter.

58:00.640 --> 58:02.400
You send the thing on Twitter.

58:02.400 --> 58:03.120
It's like a bot.

58:03.120 --> 58:08.720
You send it a short video of you scrolling through your catalog and it will send you

58:08.720 --> 58:12.880
a file that you can import into the app to automatically X off everything in your catalog.

58:12.880 --> 58:13.520
It's pretty rad.

58:14.160 --> 58:16.800
So I've just been using Nook Exchange.

58:16.800 --> 58:23.040
So, um, and because now I've got friends and I who are doing like different, uh, like you

58:23.040 --> 58:25.360
remember Gwen from our Final Fantasy free company.

58:25.360 --> 58:25.600
Yeah.

58:25.600 --> 58:26.640
A long time ago.

58:26.640 --> 58:26.880
Wow.

58:26.880 --> 58:27.440
Yeah.

58:27.440 --> 58:32.720
Um, we've got, we, we do exchanges and our friend, Melly, we do exchanges.

58:32.720 --> 58:38.560
And, um, my friend, uh, Chris, who is, uh, sister, Jared, Harry, Ariola.

58:39.360 --> 58:43.840
Um, one of my, my sister, um, we've been doing it and a few other people.

58:43.840 --> 58:47.200
It's actually been, uh, uh, Chris, Megzi, we've been doing them.

58:47.200 --> 58:48.240
It's been pretty cool.

58:48.240 --> 58:49.040
Nice.

58:49.040 --> 58:54.160
Um, VidPower573 in chat says, spreadsheets, Eve Online players say hi.

58:54.160 --> 58:54.480
Yeah.

58:54.480 --> 58:55.680
Yeah, no, I, I get it.

58:55.680 --> 58:56.480
I get it.

58:56.480 --> 58:56.800
All right.

58:56.800 --> 59:02.480
Um, other games in my gaming week, I, I played a lot of Super Mario All-Stars thanks to the,

59:02.480 --> 59:06.880
uh, kind of surprise release on Nintendo switch, because again, it really, and I meant to what

59:06.880 --> 59:10.480
I said earlier, it's really just one of the all-time great game releases.

59:10.480 --> 59:14.480
And I love playing the original Mario brothers and especially Super Mario brothers two.

59:14.480 --> 59:18.400
And I wanted to see if I still had it, if I could still beat Super Mario brothers two.

59:18.400 --> 59:23.760
And the answer is no, or I gave, I got frustrated and turned it off.

59:23.760 --> 59:27.920
Cause I lost all my lives before I had the chance to beat it, but I'll try again this

59:27.920 --> 59:28.160
week.

59:28.160 --> 59:29.200
I'm just a little rusty.

59:29.760 --> 59:35.600
Um, some new things for me that I played this week, I played a game from hello games.

59:35.600 --> 59:39.440
The folks behind no man's sky, they published a game in the past couple of weeks called

59:39.440 --> 59:41.040
the last campfire.

59:41.040 --> 59:42.400
And I checked that game out.

59:42.400 --> 59:45.920
Um, it honestly has nothing to do with no man's sky.

59:45.920 --> 59:50.720
I think, uh, hello games is just publishing something on behalf of a smaller indie studio

59:50.720 --> 59:52.880
that is doing something completely different.

59:52.880 --> 59:57.920
Uh, this game reminds me a little bit more of maybe like say a nineties PC puzzler type

59:57.920 --> 01:00:03.680
thing where basically you go into these different, they're kind of like spirits, but you go into

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:08.000
these different little worlds and try to solve a puzzle to like free the spirit.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.640
And the whole thing is narrated as you played.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:14.480
And I could, I'm like, I know I've seen this trick in a game before.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.880
I know I've, it was Bastion that did that.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:21.680
Say you remember that game Bastion where you're playing the game, except instead of a deep

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:24.480
manly voice narrating the game, like you did in Bastion.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:24.640
Right.

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:31.120
You remember that it's instead, it's, it's more of a whimsical female voice that guides

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:33.440
you through the last campfire.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:38.560
It's that's, that's basically, uh, the narrator in that game, but it's kind of that same twist

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:40.480
where it's being narrated as you're playing.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:44.640
Um, act depth and chat says the one that looks like journey.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:48.960
It kinda has a similar art style, but the games don't really play anything alike.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:54.720
Uh, the game is more of like a, uh, like a platformer, but a puzzler platformer.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:58.400
Maybe, maybe like captain toad, but that's really stretching it.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:02.960
I feel like I've played some nineties PC puzzler games though, that are a lot like this.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.920
Um, so it was, yeah, I've, I've been enjoying that game.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:12.880
Um, then the other game that I've been playing, I did not expect to like this game and I think

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:18.000
it is really good, but this week, uh, the ultimate edition or whatever you want to call

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.520
it of Avicii in vector came out.

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:22.240
Oh yeah.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:22.800
Yeah.

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:27.760
Avicii being the musical artist that passed away, um, a few years ago.

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:33.120
Um, but I think at the time he was working with this company to create a music game based

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:35.280
on his library of music.

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:38.320
And that game is called in vector or Avicii in vector.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:41.680
And I guess it's been out on PlayStation four and Xbox for a little bit.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.680
I kind of missed it, but then a switch version just came out.

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:52.960
And with that came a parody Xbox and PlayStation versions that basically add like 10 new tracks.

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:57.200
It's like some DLC from his last album, Tim.

01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:00.720
And I think there was another album in there as well that it adds some tracks from.

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:05.520
It is all his music, which kind of surprised me how diverse it is.

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:09.360
I mean, of course, of course, I know some Avicii songs, like everybody's heard that,

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:13.520
you know, wait me up when I get, you know, I don't want to, I want to get us muted either

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:15.360
by my bad singing or from copyright.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.640
But everybody knows that song.

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.360
Um, but he has a pretty rich library of other songs.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:23.520
And, uh, it is that type of music that you would expect to hear in music games.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.080
And as a music game, it's pretty fun.

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:31.120
Like it's, um, it's got a very similar, but not same approach to amplitude.

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.320
It's not multiple tracks.

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:34.800
It's just one track, but you're kind of going down this wire.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:40.720
And instead of moving left or right, you're rotating around the tube left or right to

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:42.480
hit different things in there.

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:45.120
Sounds almost like that spin rhythm game that they have.

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:49.360
Maybe a little, but then at certain parts, your ship kind of takes off.

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:52.720
Like when there's an instrumental break, your ship might take off.

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:58.320
And then you're flying your ship through these holes, like a star Fox type game, basically.

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.160
So it's like amplitude meets star Fox.

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:01.040
I'm serious.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.440
And then you actually are flying through the circles in rhythm with the music as well.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.360
And so I thought that was kind of neat and I have to be on, I'm going to be completely

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:10.240
blunt.

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:14.640
This game is what I was hoping amplitude on PlayStation four was going to be.

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:15.200
It's better.

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:16.560
It really is.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:23.920
And I was surprised because usually you kind of go, Oh, it's a music game dedicated to

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:24.960
one artist.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.960
It's probably a cash in.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:29.360
It probably isn't going to be that well thought out.

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:30.720
I was totally wrong.

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.640
It's, it's a well done music game.

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:39.040
My only maybe like minor criticism is that it can be really hard to see which I'm playing

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:43.600
on the PlayStation version and it can be really hard to see like what button you got to press

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:46.240
because the way the arrows are kind of shaped is a little funky.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.160
I wish you could kind of change that.

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:52.080
And especially when you're traveling through the wire, it does these really cool visual

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:55.760
effects where you're kind of going uphill, downhill, uphill, kind of like, um, what's

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:56.560
that other music game?

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:57.200
Thumper.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.720
Thumper does that too, right?

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:02.800
But it can be hard to see what's coming up if you're going uphill and downhill.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:07.120
And so, I mean, I guess that's part of the game design and part of the challenge.

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:11.520
I wish you could kind of chill that out just a little bit, but that is my minor criticism

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:14.320
on what's otherwise a really fun music game in my opinion.

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:18.320
So, uh, VidPower573 in chat says, I've played Avicii and Vector.

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:19.840
I really, really liked the music.

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:20.080
Yeah.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:23.680
I was, you know, being a music game fan, I, I wanted to check it out and I was really

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:24.720
surprised how much I liked it.

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.760
Again, I was expecting it like a cheap title.

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:32.480
You know, I guess though, um, like SingStar Queen and SingStar Abba, those were based

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:34.800
on one musician and they turned out pretty good.

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.400
So there's that.

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:39.360
Um, ActDef says, I really want to try that game.

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:40.160
Well, good news.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.360
There's a demo out.

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:45.680
I know the Switch has a demo and I can't imagine it's not on PlayStation and Xbox as

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:46.080
well.

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:49.040
And it has two tracks in it that you can just check out.

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:50.560
So there you go.

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:51.120
Go for it.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:53.360
So, all right.

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:57.360
Um, that was Avicii and Vector and that's it for my gaming week.

01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.120
So lots of games.

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.760
Let's get into, um, some other gaming news then.

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:04.320
We've been talking a lot here at the top of the show, but we have some other news we want

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:04.880
to get into.

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:06.640
So we will start off with Loki.

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:08.320
Yes.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:12.160
So as we've been hinting at, there's the PlayStation showcase.

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.560
It's just going to be on September 16th.

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:18.640
That's supposed to, they better goddamn unveil the price at this point.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:26.000
Uh, it's supposed to unveil the price of the PlayStation 5 and, um, you know, what's going

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.040
to be, I guess when it's coming out and that type of stuff.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:32.240
So, um, supposed to be 40 minutes long.

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:36.640
It's going to air at, uh, 1 PM Pacific time, September 16th.

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:42.880
And yeah, so I guess we'll have to wait and see what they have to announce there.

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:49.520
Um, I know that as we've been kind of frustrated this week with the whole kind of plain chicken

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:54.400
with announcing pricing and stuff like that, and I'm sure that leaks didn't help with that.

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:59.680
I'm curious to see what they respond with if they're going to try to price themselves

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:00.560
lower.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:05.760
Um, the rumor is that they might not be lower than $4.99 because they're charging a premium

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:06.320
on their system.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:13.120
Um, I just hope for their sake, it's not $599 because all the means will come back, but

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.240
uh, we'll see.

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:19.520
I mean, I'm curious, like, I don't know, like I've been kind of, you know, pro PlayStation

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:24.160
last generation just with, you know, the con that was the only console I has visited for.

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:30.960
Um, and even like this coming up generation, like I have a nicer laptop that could run

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:33.680
probably a lot of those games in decent settings.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.400
But I don't know.

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.720
I still kind of want an Xbox series X.

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:42.640
Um, I am curious to see though what exclusives each are going to have.

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:48.480
Um, I know obviously launch is going to be kind of all over the place, but, um, I don't

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:48.980
know.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:53.200
Yeah, I, I'm, I'm very curious to see what they announced.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:58.480
Like obviously I said before, I'm leaning towards Xbox series X, but I'm well aware.

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:00.320
I know more about that console right now.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:03.120
There could still be some surprises in for PlayStation five.

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:07.600
If Sony announces we got silent Hill and it's out this year, like that is going to

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:11.600
be a very hard thing for me to resist a very, very hard thing for me to resist.

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.680
So I might end up kind of tilting.

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:16.560
Um, so there's still some things that could, it could make you want to get a PlayStation

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.920
five this year for sure.

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.480
So I'm really excited to see what they're going to talk about, what they're going to

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:20.880
announce.

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:23.520
I fully expect the price to be four 99.

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:26.800
I just feel like it's kind of a different ball game this time.

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:30.400
We had that complication last time when we were talking about PlayStation four and Xbox

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:35.280
one where Microsoft under different leadership was convinced they needed to bundle the connect

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:35.840
in.

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:38.160
And, you know, some people were in favor of that.

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:39.200
Some people weren't.

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:40.000
It is what it is.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:40.400
That's good.

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.000
That's not a factor this time around.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.800
So I think because that's kind of out, I think you are looking at two very similar systems.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:50.240
And so I think you're going to be looking at similar prices and I fully expect PlayStation

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.240
five to clock in at four 99.

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:58.240
I also realized cause, um, in, um, on social media, some folks were saying, well, Sony

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.960
doesn't have to announce the price and date.

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:05.120
They don't, they can do whatever the fuck they like, but I think the pressure is not

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:06.640
like they would be foolish not to.

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:12.320
And I will say this, I would argue, yes, they do have to announce the price and date before

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:19.520
September 22nd, because what happens on the 22nd pre-orders for Xbox series X start.

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:24.240
And because, because I mean, if they're not launching this year, then that's gonna kind

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:24.800
of hurt them.

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:31.600
I mean, um, you don't, you don't have to do anything besides die and pay taxes.

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:36.000
And if you're lucky, you might be able to cheat death, but I do think so.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.080
Sony is under a lot of pressure.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.000
Like it kind of has to come out this week.

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.960
It would be very, very foolish.

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:47.360
And I think they will take a lashing, not just on social media, but they will take a

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:52.800
lashing from investors, uh, and that audience, if they do not succumb to the pressure to

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:54.480
put their cards on the table this week.

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.840
So color me shocked if they don't price and date that thing this week.

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:02.800
I would think that they would have to, um, I don't know.

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:07.040
I'm just curious to see, you know, what, what each console has to offer.

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:07.680
Like, I don't know.

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:08.560
I don't like playing this.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:11.280
Like everyone wants to pick a team.

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:12.000
I don't really care.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:17.680
I don't care who the team is because it's just, it's games at the end of the day.

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:22.320
Kind of what I was getting at earlier is that, you know, there are things about all the gaming

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:23.760
companies that I love.

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:26.960
There are things about all the gaming companies that I don't love.

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.800
It is okay to root for everybody.

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:33.520
And even though I'm sitting here saying right now, my brain is kind of tilting like Microsoft

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:38.240
this holiday, that doesn't mean I'm writing PlayStation five off for the entire generation.

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.000
That is completely not the case.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.400
I fully expect I'll end up getting one next year.

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:47.600
Um, and like I said, a million times now, Sony could still definitely announce something

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.400
for this holiday.

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.160
That'll make me go, shit.

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:51.760
I have to have that now.

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:57.440
And we're going to be having a different conversation, but, but like, I doubt that that's

01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:00.400
going to, I don't think we would get like a silent Hill this year or anything.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:03.200
If they announced that they're working on something like that, it would probably be

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.000
next year.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:10.560
And a lot of that stuff, like I just, I don't know, like I can wait on that stuff.

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:15.040
I guess if there's something that's really big, like I'm like, I'm excited about obsidian's

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.720
new RPG that they have coming out.

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:17.040
Oh yeah.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:17.600
That looks good.

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:19.520
That's not anytime soon.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:22.480
I mean, but I know that's coming at some point.

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:26.160
Um, but it's just also like, there's also the, all the game pass stuff.

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:31.520
Like there's a whole library of Xbox games that I haven't played yet, um, that I could

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:32.640
play on this console.

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:36.320
Like, so I'm going to be busy with all that stuff for a very long time.

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:39.680
Plus I still have my library of PlayStation four stuff that all these games I've purchased,

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:44.960
like the final fantasy seven remake or final fantasy 15 or kingdom hearts three all spring

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:49.040
except it's kind of odd, uh, just cause for like all this stuff I can go back and play.

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:52.160
But if I was in the opposite position than I really am.

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:56.880
And if I was in the opposite position where I had a gen one PlayStation four, you know,

01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:02.160
basically early release PlayStation four and an Xbox series X, my brain might be thinking

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:06.720
I need to get PlayStation five because even if I have a large library of PlayStation four

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:10.640
games left to play, we know that PlayStation five is going to have the SSD drive.

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:11.760
Those games are going to run better.

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:15.600
It's going to carry over those enhancements from the pro things will look better.

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:19.520
So I might, I might've answered this question differently if I didn't,

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:21.680
if I had a different configuration today in my own home.

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:24.880
And how are they treating like PlayStation four games?

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.680
Is the PlayStation five going to be playing PlayStation four games?

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:30.160
I think, how's that working with my library and stuff?

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:32.560
Like if I have all my games there, how's that work?

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:34.000
And they, are they going to be upscaled?

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.200
I mean like that, I need all these kind of like questions answered.

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:43.760
Yeah, I think they've given a vague yes because they've demonstrated Spiderman on

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.760
PlayStation four runs better on five.

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:47.280
So they have addressed it.

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:50.640
And you know, there was that whole Mark Cerny talk where then PlayStation kind of had to

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.640
correct it and say, it's going to be more than just a hundred games.

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:53.280
Don't worry.

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.320
But I do agree.

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:58.560
It would be very nice for Sony to answer the question very fucking clearly.

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:00.320
How does backwards compatibility work?

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.560
And I fully expect if the answer is it doesn't, they're going to, when it comes to PlayStation

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:11.040
three, two, and one, I would love for, I would love for them to go the other way.

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.600
And that would be soft leak on that, but I'm prepared for it.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.600
They'll probably dance around it.

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:17.760
If they, if they don't say it, it's not happening.

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:20.240
All right.

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:22.480
Well, we'll wait and see later this week.

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:23.120
Yes, we will.

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:23.760
We sure will.

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:28.880
DJ Rama S says there has been talk that PlayStation five won't be backwards compatible with a

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.240
lot of PlayStation four games.

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:30.960
Hmm.

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.240
Who, who's saying that?

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:34.640
What, what official channel is saying that?

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:41.120
I think what is happening, that is a misinterpretation of the Mark Cerny talk where he said they're

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:47.040
working on the top 100 games, but Sony did correct that and say it will be many more,

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:51.600
which to be fair, that is exactly what happened when the Xbox three, no, I'm sorry.

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:54.480
The Xbox one started backwards compatibility.

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.880
The Xbox three 60 games, they were working on the largest titles and then it had the

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:03.360
side effect of, Oh, but these other titles work too by getting halo three to work.

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:04.000
Oh, guess what?

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.320
That made Barbie horse adventures work too.

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:07.920
That wasn't on our radar, but cool.

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:08.880
We'll add it to the list.

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:13.520
And that's, that's how backwards compatibility worked over there, but I'm, I'm kind of with

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:16.400
She-Hulk 10, keep your PlayStation three in good shape.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:20.720
Cause sadly, I don't think that I, and it should be, but that's, that's a whole nother

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:21.200
thing.

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:21.440
All right.

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:22.800
Anyway, we're going to move on.

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:26.400
Let's go back and talk about game pass for a minute because another thing that came out

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:30.560
this week for Microsoft's camp, some of you guys were yelling this out in chat earlier,

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:34.320
but yes, uh, Xbox game pass is going to be getting a big edition.

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:38.480
EA play is going to be baked into Xbox game pass.

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:39.200
It's still good.

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:41.920
I shouldn't, I shouldn't phrase it that way because it's still going to be a separate

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:47.600
service, but basically as a game pass member, you will have access to the entry level of

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.640
EA play.

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:53.120
I want to point out EA play has like a basic level and an ultimate level.

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:57.040
The ultimate level is the one where I think you get demos of free games or demos of upcoming

01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:58.240
games and stuff like that.

01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:59.520
That is not what you're getting for free.

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:07.120
Based when you get the demos, I think, I think, um, the pro one, you get like the actual games

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:12.400
like games pass does, but I think the, the base one, you get like 10 hours of brand new

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:18.960
games when they come out, uh, 10 hour demos, but then, um, you get libraries of older games,

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:20.880
you know, for free that's included with it.

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:21.120
Yeah.

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:26.000
So, but that is still going to really ramp up the amount of games playable on game pass.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.520
And that's a pretty big deal.

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:31.280
So it didn't start yet, but it's going to start this holiday.

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:35.120
So I would imagine around the time of the release of the consoles probably, uh, and

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:39.120
you're going to get the EA play, which used to be called EA access, which used to be called

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:40.080
origin access.

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:42.880
They've had some troubles branding themselves.

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.760
Um, and that's going to be basically baked into it.

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:52.720
You do have to have game pass ultimate or game pass PC, but I think, wait, I'm sorry.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:57.120
I miss, do you, can you have just playing game pass Xbox and get this?

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:01.040
I don't know.

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:01.520
Or is it?

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:02.880
Yeah, this is okay.

01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:03.280
Yeah.

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:07.120
Microsoft confirmed the game pass ultimate and PC subscribers.

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:10.080
So ultimate is both and PC is just PC.

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:13.120
So it is not saying anything about just having the Xbox version.

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:19.120
So I don't read the fine print, but I don't know about you guys.

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:22.320
I have the ultimate, so I know this is going to be coming with it.

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.080
Not that there's a lot of EA games.

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:30.240
I get super thrilled about, but, um, if it's true that EA is going to be putting out a

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:31.600
mass effect remaster.

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:36.720
And if that is a part of this service, I'll be very happy about that.

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:37.920
That's for sure.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.600
Um, and you know what?

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:44.160
Maybe I would try more things like NHL and some of the sports products.

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.400
If I didn't have to pay 60 bucks for them, I might be inclined to try some of these sports

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:48.720
games.

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:52.800
I otherwise don't usually look at game pass has challenged me to play more games.

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:54.320
I might not usually play.

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:55.360
So there is that.

01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:57.840
So, all right.

01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:00.080
S2100 Matt says, be still my heart, Rob.

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:01.360
Well, why wouldn't I?

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:02.880
I'm already paying for game pass.

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:05.520
So if I can try out the NHL game for free, why wouldn't I?

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:08.000
Free, using my quotey fingers.

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:10.560
Questbuster says, Mirror's Edge is really good.

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.480
Yeah, that would be another one that would be in the library.

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.360
So neat.

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:14.960
All right, let's move on.

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:17.040
How about something from Nintendo's camp, DarkSakura?

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:22.960
Yes, stuff from Nintendo, which is actually pretty, pretty cool.

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:27.120
Um, I actually missed the first Hyrule Warriors and I really wanted to play it because I wanted

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:30.080
just to play around as Linkle because she was cute.

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:38.320
But Nintendo of America did announce recently that there's going to be a new Hyrule Warriors

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:45.280
being worked on by Koei Tecmo and Nintendo and it's Hyrule Warriors Age of Calamity.

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:48.240
It should be out on November 20th of this year.

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:55.680
And it's set right before the 100 years before the events of Legend of Zelda Breath of the

01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:56.180
Wild.

01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:03.280
So you basically are playing the active participants that you're seeing through all these

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:08.640
flashbacks, all the, the, the, uh, the, the heroes that we're working with, Lincoln,

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:11.440
Zelda, the champions, um, you get to play with them.

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:13.200
Zelda will be playable.

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.040
She apparently gets to use the Sheikah Slate.

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.760
Um, you know, stuff like that.

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:22.240
And so the thing that I'm actually interested in for this is just having like hopefully

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:25.520
a little bit more lore because I love the universe of Breath of the Wild.

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:31.840
Um, and, uh, looking at some of the promotional artwork for it, it actually just very gorgeous.

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:36.240
It has the same overall animation style that Breath of the Wild does.

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:38.560
And I think it's going to be a fantastic tie-in.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.060
Yeah.

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:44.320
You know, this isn't technically a first party release, but it feels like it because it's

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.280
a Zelda game.

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:49.520
And I think this is a very smart thing for Nintendo to be pushing this holiday, uh, between

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:52.320
this and the Mario Kart, uh, real life thing.

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:57.040
Uh, I think that's a pretty strong holiday lineup when we were expecting this year to

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:59.280
be pretty quiet due to COVID and so forth.

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:03.120
And we've kind of been getting that sense that Nintendo maybe has been challenged with

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:06.960
this situation more than anybody else, just because of how silent they've been.

01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:10.000
But I think this new Hyrule Warriors is really exciting.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.720
And, and Jamie, I, I would loan you the first game.

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:14.080
I think I've got to have it somewhere.

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:15.440
I don't think I bought it digitally.

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.920
I think I do have it on cart, uh, and I would loan it to you.

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:18.880
It's a fabulous game.

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:21.200
I would, I'd be happy to play it.

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:24.480
I mean, Dan and I could play it together, but you know, right now, what happens with

01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:25.360
games that I borrowed?

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:26.720
Yeah.

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:27.760
They get animal crossed.

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:32.160
Well, maybe this will be something that can be a distraction for a couple of days.

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:37.440
Cause the, the lawyers, I still need to get back into last of us, but, um, but yeah, I,

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:41.040
I would be happy, happy to borrow it when we have a day that isn't on fire.

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:41.440
Yeah.

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:41.680
Right.

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:43.360
Hopefully that'll do.

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:46.720
Weren't they saying it might rain in Oregon next, next week?

01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:48.080
Hopefully I hope that's true.

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:48.800
I really hope so.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:55.280
But, but, um, but who knows, maybe someone in my house will take another stop by a local

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:57.040
C's candy and share the goodness.

01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:58.420
Excellent.

01:18:59.120 --> 01:18:59.840
All right.

01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:04.160
Uh, well, let's move on while we, well, actually I quickly Loki, just a pulse check on you.

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:05.600
What's your thought with Hyrule warriors?

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:08.160
Um, I do want to get it.

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:13.360
My least my, I showed it to my, my son who's been playing, uh, through breath of the wild

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:15.040
and he's like, we got to get that.

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:15.360
Yeah.

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:19.200
I think, I think this might be a three for three type of situation.

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:24.160
Cause I think this is one where even though I wasn't so hot on the 3d all stars, I, I'm,

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.080
I was a fan of the first Hyrule warriors game.

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:30.080
It always impressed me just how many characters are in that game.

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:33.040
You play, it's like 15 different people.

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:34.480
And I'm like, who the fuck is this?

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:37.200
I was always on the fence about buying it.

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:41.040
Like I almost said, purchase it so many times, but I just never did.

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.760
Um, so I may have to do it now.

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:46.800
May have to get the new one and then may go back to the old one as well.

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:51.680
Um, Bobby black Wolf and chat says I'd rather see persona five scramble

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:55.200
than a Hyrule warriors TBH, both muscle games.

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:58.880
Um, yeah, these, these, uh, which is, uh, dynasty warriors, right.

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:01.680
It's basically what all these games are based on essentially.

01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:02.320
Yes.

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:06.480
Um, yes, there is that persona when there was another one, not that long ago too.

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:09.440
That was like a dynasty warriors S type of game.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.600
Um, damn, I can't remember somebody in chat.

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:12.640
Maybe we'll yell it out.

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:16.800
Um, but I remember, I remember playing 99 nights on Xbox 360 and thinking that

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:19.760
was much better than most people gave it fire emblem.

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:20.240
Thank you.

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:23.840
It's fire emblem warriors, but DJ Rama says it was horrible.

01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:28.000
So that was the other one I was trying to think of.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:28.480
All right.

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:30.480
Uh, let's move on more Nintendo news.

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:30.980
Loki.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:32.480
Yes.

01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:35.840
Um, so there's been a rumor for a while now that there's going to be some sort

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:38.080
of switch pro or something coming out.

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:40.160
Um, and that's still a thing.

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:44.320
Apparently though, there's more rumors that there is going to be an upgraded

01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:46.720
switch model coming out in 2021.

01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:51.760
And along with that, apparently Nintendo started asking some of the, uh, game

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:56.160
developer studios out there to start making switch games 4k ready.

01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:01.760
So I think the rumor is that it's going to be a, some sort of upgraded switch.

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:03.920
That's going to be able to output the 4k.

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:08.400
Um, not sure if that necessarily means that they're going to have older titles

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:14.800
as well, but you know, maybe we'll get some sort of news about this in the

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:15.600
next few months.

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:19.520
Um, maybe this coincides with that March 31st date.

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:23.680
Maybe there's a whole reason why those digital games aren't available after

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:24.180
that.

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:26.720
Maybe a new system's coming out.

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:27.280
We'll see.

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:29.840
I guess we'll wait until then take.

01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:33.600
Now I'm just, that would be very interesting if that is the reason why these

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:36.320
games are suddenly unavailable has to do with some type of new system.

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:39.280
But again, I'm not sure logically why that would be the case, especially if

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:43.600
this is supposed to be like a switch pro, but yeah, it wouldn't be.

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:46.960
I, yeah, I can't imagine that that would be the case.

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:49.520
It's probably just, I don't know.

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:52.320
I don't know why you would make a digital game available for a limited

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:52.820
amount of time.

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:57.200
I don't know, but I guess we'll find out.

01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:00.080
I don't know, but I guess we'll find out.

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:02.080
I'm waiting to hear more news about that.

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:04.480
Um, I would like a switch pro.

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:09.680
So I actually have a switch I can play because the rest of my family has mine.

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:13.760
Um, but yeah, I mean, it'd be interesting to see what they do with that.

01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:15.360
I'm excited for a Mario game.

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:17.600
I'm excited at the prospect of them going to 4k.

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:21.680
One other thing I have to worry about buying this holiday is a 4k TV.

01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:26.400
Let me ask you nerds in chat and you nerds here in the, in the room.

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:30.640
I'm, uh, you know, obviously we've all seen there are super cheap 4k TVs right now, right?

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:36.800
Like I can get a 4k TV for $399 or $499, but it's come to my attention that I should really

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:42.320
look into either the OLED or whatever Samsung's version of that is called.

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:46.080
They have something different, but I think I'm right now leaning towards the OLED.

01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:50.240
That is like a $1,400 TV, but damn, it looks good.

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:54.400
Like I saw it in the store at like Costco and I saw another one at Target and I was

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:55.680
like, this looks good.

01:22:55.680 --> 01:23:00.400
And I'm trying to future proof my TV a little bit because the problem with the TV I have

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.320
now, a it's not 4k.

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:05.280
B I bought it right before HDR became a thing.

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:07.120
So my TV doesn't even have HDR.

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:10.320
So it kind of pissed me off when that started taking off because I dropped quite a bit of

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:11.360
money on that old TV.

01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:16.240
So my question to you guys in chat room is, should I just buy the cheap TV to get it done

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:16.640
with?

01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:22.640
Or if I have a nice, if we've been really good at saving this year and you might be

01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:26.560
thinking like, Rob, you're talking about buying a PlayStation or Xbox, a TV, that's

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:27.440
a lot of money.

01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:33.360
Well, I didn't go to any conventions this year, so that has saved quite a bit of money.

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:39.200
So you know, and there's been, I've been very fortunate with circumstances in my day job

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:40.160
and stuff like that.

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:43.200
So should I just invest and get that better TV?

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:46.480
Cause I feel, or what seems like a better TV or is it better?

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:49.600
Because it seems like it might be so.

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:52.240
It depends what you're looking for.

01:23:52.560 --> 01:24:01.040
Really a lot of those, it comes down to like, even just like contrast, HDR, what type of

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.720
features you want in it and stuff.

01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:05.040
Just watch a lot of TV reviews out there.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:07.360
I mean, even some of the cheaper TVs aren't so bad.

01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:12.480
I have a not too expensive TCL TV and it's fine.

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:15.200
It's 4K and it seems okay.

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:20.000
It's just, if you're really like a video file or something, you may want it a little higher

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.320
end, but I wouldn't spend like, I don't think you necessarily need to spend $1,400.

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:26.560
It depends on how big of a TV you want.

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:28.400
55 inch is what I was looking at.

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:29.280
Oh, then yeah.

01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:30.800
Oh God, no, you probably wouldn't.

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:35.200
I think we just bought, we bought a really large one for my mother-in-law that was like,

01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:42.000
I think it was like 600, but it was like, it was like a 60 or 70 inch TV is ridiculously

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:42.320
huge.

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:43.600
I mean, that TV looks huge.

01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:48.160
But so just make sure that the latency on it is low.

01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:50.240
That's definitely important.

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:52.000
A lot of TVs are pretty good about that now.

01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:56.320
Yeah, sure.

01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:56.720
Real quick.

01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:57.200
Sorry.

01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:59.520
Bonds 006 says OLED and QLED.

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:00.720
You can't lose going with either one.

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:02.960
It's QLED was the Samsung one I couldn't think of.

01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:03.440
Sorry guys.

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:03.940
Thank you.

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:09.600
Tiger Claw says if you care about 120 frames per second, then you would need to get a 4K

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:12.080
that has the HDMI 2.1 inputs.

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:14.320
Those TV are 120 megahertz.

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:18.720
So I think he's kind of giving me a hint at how to future proof because 120 frames a second

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:19.520
is where things are going.

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:21.280
It sounds like it is.

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:24.320
S2100 Matt says I could get a 55 inch under 1K.

01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:27.280
I could, but can I get an OLED QLED under 1K?

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:29.120
Actually, I think a QLED is under 1K.

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:34.480
And then some folks saying best time to buy a TV is November.

01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:34.960
Yes.

01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:36.640
A few shout outs for Costco.

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:38.000
That's actually what we were looking at.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.600
Something else that's happened during all this.

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:44.080
We haven't had a Costco membership ever, but Alan finally jumped the shark and got

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:44.720
one.

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:47.520
So we probably will get from them.

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.360
And that's what I've been kind of pricing with.

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:50.160
So we'll see.

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:50.660
We'll see.

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:51.620
All right.

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.520
Anyway, let's move on.

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:56.000
I want to move on and get to some more stories here.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Let's get to a story on an old classic, which is funny because this is a game that I feel

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:08.160
like is going to be 120 frames a second and 4K and all this stuff when it's Minecraft.

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:10.960
But Minecraft is getting...

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:12.080
Hello Minecraft.

01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:12.720
I know.

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:15.120
But hey, it's a solid game.

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:20.720
There's a reason it's lasted this long and it's moving into another new thing.

01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:22.560
And that is PSVR.

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:23.040
That's right.

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:28.240
PlayStation VR is going to be getting a VR version of Minecraft, which when you consider

01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:32.000
that Minecraft is a Microsoft's own thing, it is.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.720
Of course, Minecraft has existed on PlayStation, but you were kind of getting the sense that

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:39.760
it was PlayStation was kind of supported second.

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:45.440
So it's interesting that I think that the PlayStation VR is getting a version of it

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:48.800
because they really could have probably skipped it and no one would have cared.

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:51.600
This is not a new game.

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:56.720
If you own existing Minecraft on PlayStation, you will be given the VR patch for free.

01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:58.000
So that's pretty cool.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.840
We don't know what the date is, though.

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:04.080
There will be two modes for the VR, immersive and living room.

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:06.240
But they don't say how that works.

01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:07.280
My thought is...

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:08.560
I can tell you how it works.

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:09.920
Can I say my guess?

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:16.000
It's going to be like No Man's Sky, where one mode you can use your D-pad to move around

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.200
in full 3D.

01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:20.400
And that's for people that want to have the full VR immersion.

01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:25.200
The other mode is for people that maybe don't do so well with VR and need to take it a little

01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:25.760
easier.

01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:28.160
And that's where you kind of project yourself forward.

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:30.720
You're not actually having the full motion.

01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:33.760
You're moving like it's a game board.

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:36.160
You're moving a couple squares ahead at a time or a couple squares left.

01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:36.960
That's my guess.

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:37.840
You're close.

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:43.840
The way it works is the living room mode is basically a virtual VR living room that you're

01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:46.160
literally playing it on a virtual screen.

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:48.240
So it's just 2D Minecraft in VR.

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:51.280
It's like a VR living room.

01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:53.920
Immersive is actually in VR.

01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:57.680
So the way they have Minecraft, you can actually do two modes.

01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:58.080
They have...

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:03.600
There's a motion mode where you can move with just the controller and move around and everything

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:04.240
independently.

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:07.040
And I think there's also a teleportation option as well.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.640
When I was doing it on Gear VR, it was with just like actually moving around and stuff.

01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:13.280
And it was all right.

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:15.920
I didn't feel like really sick from it or anything.

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:17.760
And it worked fine on the Gear VR.

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:18.880
I think that's also how they work.

01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:23.760
The mixed reality version on Windows 10 works as well as like that.

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.160
So it'd be kind of curious to see...

01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:30.880
I'll definitely play it again because it was fun while I did it.

01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:36.080
But with the Gear VR is kind of hard to play that for a very long time.

01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:41.840
I still got to figure out how to do that with the rip desk right now on the...

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:44.080
Because I have the Windows 10 version, so I should be able to do that.

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:47.440
I just haven't figured out how to do the VR part on that.

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:49.120
Yeah.

01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:52.160
And I didn't even realize the Gear VR version was a thing.

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.800
So I guess they already have a VR...

01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:59.840
So maybe it wasn't as much of an investment to make the PlayStation VR version work.

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:04.160
It's probably some type of adaptation of the Gear VR version.

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:06.640
Maybe not literally, but I'm sure a lot of the code that made the

01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:09.120
Gear VR work is making PlayStation VR work.

01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:09.920
Right.

01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:13.200
Because basically those versions were all based off of Pocket Edition,

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:14.960
which is now what Bedrock is.

01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:17.440
And that's the ones on all the other platforms.

01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:20.080
So it's easier for them to develop for that now.

01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:21.200
It's not straight Java.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.480
I mean, it's probably one of those things I'll try once and go, huh, interesting.

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:27.600
And then never do again.

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.680
That's kind of what I was with No Man's Sky.

01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:32.080
I love No Man's Sky and it is gorgeous in VR.

01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:35.120
I just can't play it in VR for very long because I just get really like,

01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:38.560
this is too much sensory overload.

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:42.960
But that's why I think VR is very much like cell phones for me.

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:48.560
Games that are designed with it in mind are always better than the other games

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:51.680
that kind of like have VR injected into it.

01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:52.400
You know what I mean?

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:53.840
Beat Saber, fun.

01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:57.680
Tetris Effect, fun.

01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:00.880
But these games that kind of inject it after the fact,

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:03.360
like No Man's Sky is kind of like, oh, okay.

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:06.240
That's kind of how I feel about it.

01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:07.840
All right.

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:09.200
Let's move on.

01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:12.080
We have a few more stories for you guys.

01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:12.800
Dark Sakura.

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:13.680
This is kind of a neat one.

01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:15.760
Yeah.

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:19.680
I came across this one and actually posted it in my Animal Crossing community.

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:21.840
I run on Facebook, but I thought it was really great.

01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:25.440
And I'm going to start off by saying how much I love and support the Trevor Project.

01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:33.040
They are for suicide prevention for LGBTQA plus youth, and they do some amazing stuff.

01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:38.000
Their website is thetrevorproject.org.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:44.480
But at any rate, they have released Animal Crossing clothes to help prevent youth suicide.

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:50.320
Basically just to bring awareness out there and put out the colors for the Trevor Project and offer

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:56.640
just a way to keep that awareness going by using their branding.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:07.440
I mean, it was actually stated from a Nielsen survey that 10% of all gamers over 18 identify

01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:16.400
under the rainbow and that they spend more on games than peers in similar age groups.

01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:22.080
So if you want a little bit more about, you know,

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:26.560
helping to, you know, downloading the items first of all,

01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:32.320
but then going in a little bit more for helping youth with their charity.

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:44.560
The creator code is M like Mike, A like Alpha 724817021536.

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:48.320
And you can access by searching the custom design portal inside the Able Sisters.

01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:53.280
And the items will all say TRVR.

01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:58.160
So Tango, Romeo, Victor, Romeo, Cap or overalls or whatever.

01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:03.840
And then if you want a little bit more, you can also go to trvr.org slash care,

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:06.400
C-A-R-E, Charlie Alpha Romeo Echo.

01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:09.600
But I love that they're doing this.

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:12.640
I love that they're reaching out to the community to do this.

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.720
And I'm going to share the link in the chat room.

01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:17.520
I think that's a great thing.

01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:23.360
And it's a great charity because, you know, this these times are really difficult, you know,

01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:26.320
with the pandemic going on and the fires and just everything.

01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:30.080
There's so much and the social justice movement, everything.

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:31.680
There's a lot of stuff going on right now.

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:39.040
And it can really cause people to, you know, have some really bad mental health days like I

01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:40.720
and I've been very open about this on Twitter.

01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:44.720
There's been some days lately where I'm just like, I'm not I'm not having a good day today.

01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:45.840
I just I'm not.

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:48.400
And it's just that constant like, I can't go anywhere.

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:49.680
I can't do anything.

01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:58.240
And imagine if you are a young LGBTQ, et cetera, a young rainbow person that is stuck in a,

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:05.280
we'll just say, abusive environment towards, you know, your gender identity or your sexuality

01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:08.000
or whatever it is in the rainbow community.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:12.160
Like, you know, if you are in a situation and you can't leave it because of everything

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:16.960
else that's going on in the world, that can be very, very troubling for a person's mental

01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:17.520
health.

01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:21.040
So I'm glad we're taking a moment, even if it's through a video game, even as through

01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:25.040
a social phenomenon like Animal Crossing, to kind of bring some attention back to that

01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:27.040
because people be struggling right now.

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:30.240
Yo, and it's and people are struggling in all sorts of different ways.

01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:32.400
So I agreed.

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:38.320
And I mean, and I'll go ahead and I'll be a little bit more open with with this right

01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:48.080
now with the year that we've had with with Dan's mom and, you know, losing my dad a few

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:50.560
months ago and everything else going on.

01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:58.480
You know, it's I'm actually having to take time off to deal with things.

01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:04.560
And I'm going to be going actually into some therapy myself.

01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:06.240
And I encourage everybody.

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:08.240
There is no shame in seeking help.

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:13.360
In fact, if you need it, please reach out to your resources.

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:16.560
There are some free services out there.

01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:22.480
If you're a veteran, you can try to find something through the VA, you know, look to the charities

01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:23.120
out there.

01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:26.240
There are resources out there for you one way or another.

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:33.920
So and just know that there's a phrase that my old manager used to have outside his his

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:38.880
cube that said, be kind for everybody is fighting a hard battle.

01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:43.120
This battle is maybe very private.

01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:46.960
They may be very public, but everyone is struggling and we should be kind.

01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:52.480
And the concept of going to the doctor when you're sick is not one that you should be

01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:56.160
embarrassed of when it when it's, you know, you're in the hospital.

01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:00.880
You have a flu or if you suspect you have covid, nobody gives that a second thought.

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:01.280
Right.

01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:05.200
So why again, the same thing of the saying you go to the doctor when you're sick.

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:08.480
Why shouldn't that apply to all types of sick?

01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:14.800
So well, and you know, it's like, you know, when people are like, oh, you know, I'm having

01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:16.080
a depressive episode.

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:18.880
They're like, well, did you did you try yoga?

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:21.040
Did you try eating fruit?

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:22.960
You know, which I've heard everything under the sun.

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:25.600
Well, I'm sorry about your broken leg.

01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:27.920
Did you try, you know, doing yoga with it?

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:31.360
Yeah, it went through the doctor and you had it set.

01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:37.760
It's it's the equivalent of when I when I have a cold, I had these symptoms.

01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:38.560
Did you take zinc?

01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:47.040
Well, zinc actually does have a medically proven, but still, you understand, you get

01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:48.400
what I'm right.

01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:50.640
And yeah, and I'm actually going to go.

01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:52.240
May I tangent a little bit?

01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:54.080
60 seconds.

01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:58.320
Girl, anyway, and I'll go ahead and let everyone know this.

01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:04.400
I've been on medication for depression and anxiety since I was probably still a late

01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:05.440
teenager.

01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:09.600
And there's people out there like, oh, it's going to change your brain chemistry.

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:11.680
Well, that's the fucking point.

01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:15.840
My brain chemistry was making it hard for me to function around other people.

01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:20.720
I would be dead if not for the drugs that have saved my life by improving my mental

01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:22.800
health and my ability to cope with things.

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:29.360
I had years of undiagnosed autism that once I got my diagnosis, they were able to change

01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:34.560
my medication to tweak it to that so that it assisted with the way I function in life.

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:37.840
And Rob, I think you remember when I decided to quit my meds once.

01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:40.800
And how insufferable I was.

01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:43.140
Yeah.

01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:48.880
Everybody, please thank Rob for his heroic sacrifice, for having experienced that.

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:55.200
So none of you have to, um, but you know, just, just say right now, you know, wasn't

01:36:55.200 --> 01:37:02.080
that, wasn't that a Disneyland trip when that was Disneyland and we had it out and that

01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:03.440
was my birthday.

01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:04.400
It was my birthday.

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:05.200
That was a day.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:11.440
And I think the only reason I didn't kick your ass metaphorically, not, I would never

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:14.720
actually, but, you know, uh, metaphorically was that it was your birthday.

01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:17.680
And I was like, I'm going to be very fucking polite because it's her birthday.

01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:19.440
Oh, then we had it out.

01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:23.600
And I think I went back on my meds, like the, like, right when I got back to Sacramento.

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:24.100
Yeah.

01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:27.520
So, um, but sometimes you fight with your sisters, it happens.

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:29.280
There's a little hair pulling and then you work it out.

01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:35.200
But, but, you know, just to, just to say, you know, the next time, and if you have ever

01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:39.280
said this to somebody, I hope it was so far in the past and that you've learned your lesson.

01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:45.280
But, um, you know, if someone's on medication at the moment, someone says, well, you should

01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:51.440
just try doing this, you know, holistic, blah, blah, whatever, tell them to kindly

01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:52.640
shut the fuck up.

01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:56.080
And you need to try my vagina scented candle from Goop.

01:37:58.160 --> 01:37:58.720
That bitch.

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:05.600
No, just, just tell them to shut the fuck up and actually talk about shit they really

01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:06.160
know about.

01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:06.660
Okay.

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:07.700
That's all.

01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:13.120
If someone doesn't, if you have someone in your life who's suffering, offer to let them

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:15.120
talk about it, but respect if they say no.

01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:16.240
Just let them know that you're there.

01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:20.720
I think I, I broke the break man in chat.

01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:21.920
Who's going, what the fuck?

01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:23.200
It's a real thing, buddy.

01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:25.600
Look it up or don't actually don't look it up.

01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:29.200
I'm coming in hot enough for one night.

01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:30.980
All right.

01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:31.940
Yes.

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:33.920
Gwyneth Paltrow is crazy.

01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:39.040
To be fair though, she feels that it smells like flowers and stuff.

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:44.800
So it doesn't actually smell like, you know, what I, what I actually love is that it's

01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:51.520
labeled as bougie parfumé and she wants $75 for a fucking candle.

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:54.880
Like I can make a candle that smells like a twat and I can make it a lot cheaper.

01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:56.320
All right.

01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:57.680
Moving on, please.

01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:02.480
Anyway, yeah, let's, let's try to get back to the good message we were trying to get

01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:03.280
to at the beginning.

01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:04.560
And that is gave.

01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:08.880
And some of you guys were saying this in chat as well, is that, um, you know, the way animal

01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:10.320
crossing has really kind of helped.

01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:14.560
Um, SHG100 Matt in chat says animal crossing came at the right time for plenty of folks

01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:16.800
who needed that escape and sense of enjoyment.

01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:18.400
2020 has sucked.

01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:22.480
Uh, DJ Rama S says, I truly love how animal crossing has been bringing so many people

01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:22.960
together.

01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:23.680
Yes, for sure.

01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:28.560
Oh, see, now we have pod culture saying that we should have dream merch.

01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:30.480
So the twat candle.

01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:30.720
What?

01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:31.680
Yes to merch.

01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:32.720
No to that candle.

01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:35.440
You want to miss, you want to Mr. Smoosh's litter box candle?

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:36.960
Is that what you want, America?

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:40.400
I'll make a twat candle, but twat's gonna sound, is it gonna stand for something?

01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:41.840
I just haven't decided what yet.

01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:42.340
Yeah.

01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:43.700
All right.

01:39:44.340 --> 01:39:46.900
Anyhow, candle and send it out to somebody.

01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:53.460
Sia Tabiri suggests stroup, drop waffles, stroup, twat waffles.

01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:54.180
All right.

01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:54.500
Okay.

01:39:55.540 --> 01:39:57.620
Moving on, please.

01:39:57.620 --> 01:39:58.100
Yeah.

01:39:58.100 --> 01:39:59.780
We had other big news this week.

01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:03.380
We had a whole third party news thing we haven't even talked about yet.

01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:03.540
Right?

01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:04.100
Logie.

01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:04.500
Yeah.

01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:04.820
Yes.

01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:07.940
Speaking of speaking about twats, let's talk about Ubisoft.

01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:13.540
Uh, so first off, you have their CEO come out and make a separate apology video.

01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:20.500
Of course that wasn't part of this presentation, but he's sorry for stuff and promises that

01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:21.300
things will be done.

01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:24.340
Let's speak louder.

01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:29.300
The words, my friend put your, I mean, I know they're talking about, and some of the things

01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:33.700
they're talking about sounds promising, so actions speak louder than words.

01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:35.220
Let's let's, let's see it happen.

01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:36.020
Make it happen, buddy.

01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:36.520
Yeah.

01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:42.580
But anyways, so during their Ubisoft, uh, forward showcase, they were talking about

01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:45.380
some new games and some older games and stuff like that.

01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:50.500
So some of the things that they're showing off, uh, immortals Phoenix rising, uh, got

01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:51.380
a release date.

01:40:51.380 --> 01:40:56.980
It's now December 3rd as originally a game called gods and monsters, which looked kind

01:40:56.980 --> 01:40:59.700
of interesting, sort of like a Zelda type game.

01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:06.100
Uh, so that's something coming out later this year, uh, a remaster, uh, Prince of Persia,

01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:11.300
sand of times, I guess, or I guess maybe a remake, I don't know it a remake, I guess

01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:13.060
that is going to be coming out at some point.

01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:15.060
Uh, so it's in the works.

01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:19.780
They announced that, uh, Sam Fisher from splinter cells is going to be coming into,

01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:21.860
uh, rainbow six siege.

01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:26.020
Uh, finally going to be remastering and re-release.

01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:30.420
I don't know if it's a necessary remaster, at least re-releasing the Scott Pilgrim versus

01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:36.420
the world game is going to be coming back out now on PlayStation 4, Xbox one PC switch

01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:37.540
and stadia.

01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:39.380
That's coming out this holiday.

01:41:39.380 --> 01:41:41.300
A lot of people really happy about that one.

01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:42.260
And I, I understand.

01:41:43.540 --> 01:41:44.100
Very cool.

01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:48.740
Um, Aiden Pierce is going to be back in watchdog Legion.

01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:51.860
So he is from the very first watchdogs games.

01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:56.100
And apparently that's only as part of their season past DLC or whatever.

01:41:56.100 --> 01:41:57.940
So, uh, neat.

01:41:57.940 --> 01:42:02.820
I guess if you get the DLC or the, the season pass, you also get the original game.

01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:05.140
Funny enough, I actually have the original game.

01:42:05.140 --> 01:42:07.300
Still haven't played it this day.

01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:12.100
I have it in a, in the package, but still haven't played it.

01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:17.460
Um, and then of course they announced a brand new game called writers Republic, which is

01:42:17.460 --> 01:42:18.660
from the makers of steep.

01:42:18.660 --> 01:42:23.700
It definitely looks like steep in a lot of the sense of that game.

01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:28.820
Um, this is kind of more of like an extreme downhill racing game.

01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:33.140
Um, almost a little bit like motor store meets deep.

01:42:33.140 --> 01:42:34.260
Um, I don't know.

01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:36.020
It's interesting.

01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:38.500
So that's something that's going to be coming out a little bit later.

01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:42.260
Uh, also from their pre-show, they are showing off some more stuff as well.

01:42:42.260 --> 01:42:47.300
Far cry is getting a new VR game of far cry VR dive into insanity.

01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:51.220
It's going to be a multiplayer game up to eight people come out in 2021.

01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:57.860
They had this, uh, Damon Paris journey back in time, which is like some VR, um, Notre

01:42:57.860 --> 01:42:58.260
Dame.

01:42:59.380 --> 01:43:00.260
Uh, I don't know.

01:43:01.780 --> 01:43:04.980
Some sort of a game in Notre Dame, right?

01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:06.420
Yeah.

01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:09.460
So it's something that's coming out, I guess, for the Oculus.

01:43:09.460 --> 01:43:14.420
Um, they're showing this game roller champions, which is still coming out next year.

01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:22.180
They talked about, um, this game's a monster prom is getting a SQL monster prom to monster

01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:28.660
camp it's in development and yeah, just more, uh, content coming to the other games to division

01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:31.940
two for honor crew to all getting more content.

01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:33.700
So nice.

01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:35.160
Yeah.

01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:37.780
A lot of good, a lot of good stuff coming.

01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:41.780
I mean, obviously, you know, there's very fair criticisms and how they've been responding

01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:46.580
to, um, some of the criticisms out there, but from strictly a games perspective, um,

01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:48.820
the games are looking pretty, pretty cool out of there.

01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:54.020
So, um, no one special 77 and chat says I probably won't buy the Scott Pilgrim game

01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:59.220
if it's sold exclusively through Uplay, maybe steam, but I prefer GOG TBH.

01:43:59.220 --> 01:44:03.220
I haven't heard of Ubisoft selling anything exclusively through, through Uplay.

01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:05.700
I bet if they do, it won't be for very long.

01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:08.580
It'll probably be for the first month, but it'll be on steam.

01:44:08.580 --> 01:44:13.860
And probably, I don't know if I don't have they been selling stuffs, uh, through Uplay

01:44:13.860 --> 01:44:14.500
exclusively.

01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:17.860
I thought they've been, I don't know about exclusively, but they do sell things to their

01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:18.420
own storefront.

01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:19.060
They sure do.

01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:20.900
Have they been doing stuff through Epic though?

01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:24.180
I can't remember if they're one of the companies that was doing stuff through Epic or if they've

01:44:24.180 --> 01:44:25.300
gone through steam.

01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:30.260
I think recently, I think both, but I could be wrong.

01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:31.540
It's hard to keep track these days.

01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:36.340
Yeah, I don't know, but it's still exciting to see that game coming back.

01:44:36.340 --> 01:44:38.260
So, um, pretty cool.

01:44:38.260 --> 01:44:38.500
Yeah.

01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:39.460
All right.

01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:43.220
Well, moving on, let's talk about, um, this is kind of neat, uh, another company, very

01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:46.340
different company doing kind of a collector's set.

01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:50.660
So it's Annapurna Interactive and you may or may not have heard them.

01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:55.300
They do a lot of kind of, I guess more like artistic and indie games that are available

01:44:55.300 --> 01:44:58.180
on PlayStation four, um, and other systems as well.

01:44:58.180 --> 01:45:01.060
I know they put games out on switch, but this collection we're talking about is for the

01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:02.180
PlayStation four.

01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:05.780
And what's really cool about this is that Annapurna is going to be, uh, teaming up with

01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:11.380
I am 8-bit to do a physical PlayStation four box set with eight games.

01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:17.380
So it's going to include games like what remains of Edith Finch, Sayonara Wild Hearts, Donut

01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:19.060
County and Outer Wilds.

01:45:19.060 --> 01:45:22.420
So, you know, these are all games that they've done, but what's also really cool about this

01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:28.660
is that some games have never been released on a physical format before, including Goroga

01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:33.780
is one of them and Telling Lies, which I talked about on the last OLR because I just got into

01:45:33.780 --> 01:45:36.180
that game a few weeks ago and I really liked it.

01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:39.700
Um, and so it was very different, um, but I really liked it.

01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:43.300
Uh, so it's kind of neat that they're doing this box set and it looks pretty cool.

01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:44.900
Now it's going to set you back.

01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:46.980
It's $179.99.

01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:51.220
So 180 bucks for this, uh, with exclusive cover sheets and anything, but it is meant

01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:53.060
to be a collector's item.

01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:58.260
If you want to spend another 20 bucks, you get the deluxe PS4 limited edition with an

01:45:58.260 --> 01:46:04.260
ultra premium custom designed folio package and a forward from the founder of Annapurna,

01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:09.620
um, Nathan Gary and some statements, uh, with the team behind each game, there will be a

01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:12.340
limited run of 2000 copies for that.

01:46:12.340 --> 01:46:15.700
So that's going to really be for the diehard fans, but you know what?

01:46:15.700 --> 01:46:20.660
That's that company's put out so many good games and just like artsy indie titles that

01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:21.860
really resonate.

01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:24.020
Um, I bet there will be a lot of people to go for that.

01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:26.500
So, all right.

01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:29.380
So now we're going to take a trip back in time.

01:46:29.380 --> 01:46:34.660
We're going to go back to, there was, there was no eight disc collector set of things.

01:46:34.660 --> 01:46:35.540
Well, I don't know.

01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:40.980
Maybe you would have collector sets, but they came with a dish and a spoon or a poster.

01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:46.100
Yeah, no, and not, not those are a, uh, um, uh, pillowcase.

01:46:47.060 --> 01:46:47.700
All right.

01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:51.300
You know, I'm talking about the classic game of the week and every week dark soccer steps

01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:55.860
into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, Hey, you kids should be tech checking

01:46:55.860 --> 01:46:56.740
this game out.

01:46:56.740 --> 01:46:58.660
What is the classic game of the week dark soccer?

01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:03.220
It's tech romancer suggested by my very own Dan.

01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:08.580
So, uh, tech romancer is a, it was an arcade game.

01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:16.580
It's Japanese game was Choko Senki Kikayo, um, which was a 3d fighting game that came

01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:18.340
out in 1998.

01:47:18.420 --> 01:47:22.740
Um, by the way, that name means chronicle of super steel warrior.

01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:25.620
Kikayo Kikayo is a, it means a machine.

01:47:26.420 --> 01:47:33.220
So it was basically a fighting game that was based off of different sub genre of Becca

01:47:33.220 --> 01:47:34.020
anime.

01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:37.860
And of course it did come out to the dream cast as things in that era did.

01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:44.100
Um, so basically you come, you control a giant robot and you fight one-on-one combat with

01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:45.140
another giant robot.

01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:52.660
Um, and the cool thing about this is that the studio new, uh, new eight, which is these,

01:47:52.660 --> 01:47:59.700
it's the same animation studio, uh, that did the mechanical designs for super dimension

01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:04.580
fortress, Macross, which, uh, as we know was Robotech in the U S but they designed the

01:48:04.580 --> 01:48:05.380
robots for the game.

01:48:06.340 --> 01:48:10.660
Um, I mean, that's, it's so funny cause you totally have this one that looks kind of like

01:48:10.660 --> 01:48:13.060
Mazinger Z style and everything is pretty cool.

01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:19.860
Um, so at any rate, um, you are far in the future of earth and you have advanced technology

01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:27.140
and everyone can just like chill, but then a alien tyrant named gold BS invades and you

01:48:27.140 --> 01:48:27.940
got a fight.

01:48:28.580 --> 01:48:31.300
So you have two, uh, primary modes.

01:48:31.300 --> 01:48:33.940
You have story mode and hero challenge mode.

01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:38.660
The dream cast one also had mini games that can be played on the VMU to get more points.

01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:46.820
Um, in Japan, the game was re-released, um, as, uh, Choco Senki Kikayo for matching service,

01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:51.860
which, um, matching services usually for online play and it had online functionality.

01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:58.580
Um, so you have a flat 3d pane with buildings and other things scattered around.

01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:04.100
Um, and if you destroy the terrain, um, by either breaking them or walking through them,

01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:09.860
you get power ups and you, uh, can get three different weapons, armor, or life power ups,

01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:13.540
a hero mode power up, which increases the power of your MECHA attack.

01:49:13.540 --> 01:49:17.140
And you can also get additional abilities and different moves.

01:49:17.140 --> 01:49:22.340
So instead of having a round, your match is decided by your life meter.

01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:27.940
Um, so you have two life meters and when the second one is depleted, then you're done.

01:49:28.580 --> 01:49:34.900
Um, and then you also have an armor gauge that can be broken and lowers your overall defense.

01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:40.180
Then you also have at least two super attacks and a final attack, which, uh, you can use when

01:49:40.180 --> 01:49:46.180
your opponent is down to the last 50% of their second life bar. And it's usually like an insta

01:49:46.180 --> 01:49:55.940
kill. Um, it was actually, uh, listed as one of the most successful arcade games in Japan.

01:49:55.940 --> 01:50:04.340
Um, game machine listed it as the sixth most successful. Um, the dreamcast game, um, in the

01:50:04.340 --> 01:50:13.220
U S it wasn't really seen as, um, as great in the U S as it was in Japan, just because that same level

01:50:13.220 --> 01:50:18.900
of nostalgia, I guess, isn't present here as it would have been for the whole series of MECHA

01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:24.820
anime that had existed since, you know, the sixties. I mean, sixties really, you know,

01:50:24.820 --> 01:50:30.660
you have your tattoo on Adam, you have, uh, Mazinger Z, you had everything leading up then into

01:50:30.660 --> 01:50:37.620
like even, uh, got your mind in the seven early seventies, you had, uh, all kinds of, you know,

01:50:37.620 --> 01:50:41.220
there's a lot more, I think, uh, nostalgia for it in Japan than there was for it here.

01:50:41.780 --> 01:50:49.220
But, um, it got a 29, um, out of 40 from Famitsu is generally, uh, considered favorable. So,

01:50:49.220 --> 01:50:53.540
I mean, and we know how stingy Famitsu is. So yeah, overall it got really,

01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:59.220
really good ratings, uh, anywhere from average to the higher end of, uh, of the scale.

01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:10.260
And that is tech romancer, which there you go. I'm curious before we go out to the show, if, uh,

01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:15.220
Loki has ever, uh, checked this game out. Cause I know you're a big mech person. And so this is

01:51:15.220 --> 01:51:19.300
like a mech fighting game. So I'm curious if this is something that it was ever on your radar, Loki.

01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:25.300
Uh, no, I was unaware of the whole game. Yeah. I have to admit, I was not very familiar with

01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:29.060
this game either. So, but you said it didn't have like a huge reception in the U S really

01:51:29.060 --> 01:51:33.140
compared to Japan, right? Yeah. It was kind of like the people who liked it really liked it.

01:51:33.140 --> 01:51:37.860
I mean, it is sort of, you know, it's a genre game and you know, if you're looking at the, uh,

01:51:38.740 --> 01:51:44.980
the video here, you know, it's, it's like the, each of these Mecca come from their own like

01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:49.300
anime series. They've got little intros and special logos for them and everything.

01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:57.700
So, um, so the game is really, uh, I wouldn't even say a love letter to the, uh, the genre.

01:51:57.700 --> 01:52:01.940
Yeah. Um, sorry, just some quick comments from chat that kind of, uh, along those same lines,

01:52:01.940 --> 01:52:05.940
orange, right. Says, love how everyone has their own logo. Uh, Questbuster says,

01:52:05.940 --> 01:52:08.420
yay, tech romancer. I still have this for my dream cast.

01:52:10.660 --> 01:52:16.500
Well, and, uh, bones double six wants me to keep, uh, you know, naming off, uh,

01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:25.540
mecha anime. So, uh, I was actually thinking though of, um, cyber bots. It's kind of gives

01:52:25.540 --> 01:52:31.780
me a little bit of a cyber bots field, but cyber bots was, uh, was, uh, 2d. But I mean,

01:52:31.780 --> 01:52:39.140
we also had, you know, uh, you know, I mentioned Mazinger Z. We had, um, that was a Go Nagai

01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:44.420
anime, um, who also gave us devil man. You remember that one? Um, we had, uh,

01:52:44.420 --> 01:52:53.380
Tetsujin 28 Go, which we got in the USS Gigantor in 1963. Um, we had, uh, Gundam, the whole Gundam

01:52:53.380 --> 01:52:59.780
series as a big space saga with giant robots. Um, and I'm sure Gundam wing was really, I think

01:52:59.780 --> 01:53:06.020
the one that kicked the Gundam series into popularity here in the U S we had, uh, Dan guard

01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:13.380
ACE. We had for us, we had go lion that turned into the lion Voltron over here. Um, and we also

01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:23.620
had, um, uh, that became vehicle Voltron. Um, Evangelion can even be considered a mecha anime,

01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:29.620
even though that they are not really mecha, they're organic. Um, and then of course all

01:53:29.620 --> 01:53:34.660
these things, you know, I would think that if you released a mecha game now with the advent of

01:53:34.660 --> 01:53:42.660
Pacific rim, for an example, um, you know, and that a lot more people are more well versed in

01:53:42.660 --> 01:53:47.860
various, uh, you know, anime, you know, a lot of people have gone back and tried to discover the

01:53:47.860 --> 01:53:54.500
classics, you know, and that I think that maybe the game might have a better chance right now. I

01:53:54.500 --> 01:54:02.260
mean, we had, we had a Voltron, you know, uh, kind of a redo that was released in the U S um, but I

01:54:02.260 --> 01:54:08.740
mean, I remembered loving my mecha anime and like the nineties, like Palabor, um, even dominion

01:54:08.980 --> 01:54:15.220
police could be considered a mecha anime. Of course. Um, we had, uh,

01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:21.540
gosh, honestly, now I'm just thinking of all, all of the, the various kinds, cause I, I do

01:54:21.540 --> 01:54:28.100
love my mecha anime. I liked, uh, got demo eight, the mess team. Uh, I, I like turn a Gundam was

01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:33.380
actually pretty interesting. Um, even transformers, I think could be considered a, a mecha anime of

01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:40.660
sorts, but I mean, you know, we had our, our introduction to a lot of this when we were a lot

01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:46.820
younger, you know, even with what, um, they did for Robotech over here, we had my cross, we had

01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:53.300
most beta bubblegum prices could be considered a mecha anime. So, which hopefully some of these

01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:59.380
names are actually, you know, familiar to people, you know, fire Robo, all, all, all of that. So,

01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:08.820
all right. Uh, I love me some mecha in chat says I keep reminding people of a PS2 mecha game called

01:55:08.820 --> 01:55:16.420
robot out alchemical drive, which started my obsession with mecha animes. I remember that

01:55:16.420 --> 01:55:21.460
when I was supposed to brings up robot carnival, which was, uh, it was, it was pretty good. Uh,

01:55:21.460 --> 01:55:29.460
metropolis, I think, um, there, cause there was, uh, yeah. Metropolis. There was the, um,

01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:34.100
I can't, why can't I remember her name, her name or the Rose opera singer.

01:55:34.980 --> 01:55:38.660
Bring us back from the classic game segment that I turned off. No, no, it's all good.

01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:42.180
Trip down memory lane, but a tech romancer is your classic game of the week. There you go.

01:55:43.060 --> 01:55:46.660
Tech romancer is awesome. Tastic. And you need to play it. And then, um,

01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:51.620
but also play cyber. All right. We might talk about some of these other games in coming weeks.

01:55:51.620 --> 01:55:55.700
That's for sure. Um, but I know for tonight, uh, dark Sakura, I know we have to let you go

01:55:55.700 --> 01:55:59.860
a little early tonight. She has some family things to take care of, but, um, thank you,

01:55:59.860 --> 01:56:03.620
of course, for being here as if I have to thank you. You've been here every week, but still

01:56:03.620 --> 01:56:10.660
appreciate it. Mostly weeks, real life. Sometimes your life has different, uh, different, uh,

01:56:10.660 --> 01:56:14.260
designs on my time. Yeah. Understandable. There's a lot going on. Um, so

01:56:14.660 --> 01:56:20.260
sorry. Any final thoughts for our listeners before we let you go?

01:56:21.140 --> 01:56:27.540
Um, I encourage everyone here in California, sorry, my glasses are all smoky. Um, number one,

01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:33.700
I have new glasses and I think they're freaking adorable. And yes, I sprung for Prada. Um, second,

01:56:33.700 --> 01:56:41.460
um, if you're out in any area, do not go outside without your mask. Even if you are not sick,

01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:45.220
other people may be, please be respectful of other people by wearing your mask properly,

01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:50.580
covering your nose and your chin, and do not put it to your chin because of the moment you

01:56:50.580 --> 01:56:55.140
pull it back over your face, germs that you have on your skin from your neck will go over your face.

01:56:55.140 --> 01:56:59.700
Second of all, make sure you wash all of your hands. Um, you know, 20 seconds, you know,

01:56:59.700 --> 01:57:05.860
seeing I will survive or something, um, or some belly parton. And also here in California,

01:57:05.860 --> 01:57:12.340
if you can swing getting, uh, filters for your masks or getting a, um, respirator mask,

01:57:13.060 --> 01:57:18.580
please do it. Don't go out there and damage your lungs. Just stay inside and stay safe.

01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:23.220
Play some games. All right. And don't go any concerts. God damn it. Smash mouth.

01:57:23.220 --> 01:57:25.620
All right. Thank you to our soccer. We'll see you next week.

01:57:26.500 --> 01:57:32.900
Boy. All right. Bye. Bye. All right. Let me just, uh, while I fix the, uh, discord there

01:57:32.980 --> 01:57:37.540
so we can see Loki front and center. All right. Let's get into some rapid fire news,

01:57:37.540 --> 01:57:43.300
some quick headlines for the week. Loki. So, yes. So there's, um, some new games coming out.

01:57:43.300 --> 01:57:47.940
So one of those, um, from one of my favorite companies, D three is releasing yet another

01:57:47.940 --> 01:57:54.900
Oni Chambara game. Uh, that's the bikini samurai, uh, zombie Slayer game that's going to be coming

01:57:54.900 --> 01:58:03.620
out October 14th, uh, Oni Chambara origins on PlayStation four and PC. So it, it is what it is.

01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:10.100
It's, uh, they had a very interesting, um, debut like release date trailer for it. I think it had,

01:58:10.100 --> 01:58:15.060
I can't remember which, um, Japanese artist was in, but it's a Japanese metal band. Um,

01:58:16.020 --> 01:58:21.860
so interesting. Um, and then of course, um, another kind of eclectic game like that as well.

01:58:21.860 --> 01:58:28.660
No more heroes three, unfortunately is going to be delayed to 2021 because of course, COVID-19.

01:58:28.660 --> 01:58:34.420
So they've, um, said that because of that, it, their team has been hard hit at a grasshopper

01:58:34.420 --> 01:58:40.740
manufacturer. And so that they've decided to focus on prioritizing quality and to push back

01:58:40.740 --> 01:58:48.100
the final release date. So now it's coming out in 2021. So this year, so I can wait. It looks good.

01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:52.500
Who knew there were so many similarities between no more heroes three and marshmallow peeps.

01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:59.940
Also not coming out this holiday season. Sorry. It's a terrible joke, but it's true

01:58:59.940 --> 01:59:05.700
for this holiday for Halloween. Yeah. You know how they do peeps every now they do peeps,

01:59:05.700 --> 01:59:11.460
like they do pumpkin peeps for Halloween. They'll do like peppermint peeps for Christmas. They'll,

01:59:11.460 --> 01:59:14.820
they'll sell those things to you around for any Europe. You're only supposed to put that

01:59:14.820 --> 01:59:21.540
Easter. No, not anymore. Not anymore. All right. Some rapid fire headlines for me.

01:59:21.540 --> 01:59:28.180
Apparently the Ninja Gaiden trilogy has been registered as a trademark for PlayStation

01:59:28.180 --> 01:59:34.500
four and switch. This is a Hong Kong software distributor game source entertainment listed

01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:39.940
these for Nintendo switch platforms in 2021. Oh, remember the days when things would get spoiled

01:59:39.940 --> 01:59:46.820
from distributor release dates, Loki, remember the times. So this may be a thing. Now, apparently

01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:52.740
the listing was eliminated, but some folks over on a big forum caught that. And there's apparently

01:59:52.740 --> 02:00:00.580
a bundle with Ninja guidance, Sigma Sigma two and Ninja Gaiden three razors edge from 2012.

02:00:00.580 --> 02:00:06.740
So it's a huge so, Oh man, I was thinking it was the original trilogy. I got excited.

02:00:06.740 --> 02:00:11.620
No, no, no, no. All right. So it's the newer games. Well, those are okay.

02:00:11.620 --> 02:00:18.020
Uh, that will be coming out apparently in March for 40 bucks. Okay. So a new Ninja Gaiden trilogy,

02:00:18.020 --> 02:00:24.980
why not? If it's good enough for Mario, why not real? All right. Also another quick headline about

02:00:24.980 --> 02:00:31.620
a mobile release for iOS and Android called Pac-Man geo. It looks like it might be Pokemon go

02:00:31.620 --> 02:00:36.100
meets Pac-Man, but guess what? It's not that I read, I looked into this a little more. It is not

02:00:36.100 --> 02:00:42.100
Pokemon go with Pac-Man because what it is, New York, Paris, Tokyo, make a Pac-Man maze by

02:00:42.100 --> 02:00:47.060
choosing from a variety of real world streets. So you just play Pac-Man on a variety of real world

02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:55.620
streets. You know what this is? Uh huh. It is. It's that Google April fool's joke. It is just like,

02:00:55.620 --> 02:01:01.460
what's interesting. You know, the, the SIM similarity there between Pokemon go is that

02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:08.420
Pokemon go was born of that April fool's joke. Uh, that was the kind of the first kind of

02:01:09.460 --> 02:01:15.220
pebble, if you will, that started the avalanche of Pokemon go was when that Pokemon Google April

02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:20.180
fool's prank happened. It ended up like, wow, this would actually be a really fun type of product in

02:01:20.180 --> 02:01:25.060
the real world. So now that's what they're doing with Pac-Man, except it really is kind of like,

02:01:25.060 --> 02:01:29.540
download the maps and play on these maps. But I mean the Google, the Google integration thing

02:01:29.540 --> 02:01:35.460
was fun. So I'm sure this game will be fine, but it is not Pokemon. Like a lot of outlets

02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:40.500
are just saying it must be Pokemon go meets Pac-Man. It's not that. Yeah. So at least it's

02:01:40.500 --> 02:01:45.700
free. So you can try it out and then immediately delete it off of her devices because it's probably

02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:49.940
not really great. I still think it's interesting how many Google April fool's jokes are becoming

02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:56.900
reality. You want to know what else is funny? Okay. So Ingress Niantic Niantic used to be a

02:01:56.900 --> 02:02:03.780
Google own thing, right? Until they split off on their own. Well, the April fool's joke in Ingress

02:02:03.780 --> 02:02:09.860
one year when Google was over them was that it changed your avatar to Pac-Man and all the XM

02:02:09.860 --> 02:02:15.300
became dots and all the portals or pokey stops, whatever were ghosts. And you could change them

02:02:15.300 --> 02:02:22.660
to green and blue colors. That was the gag in Pokemon or Ingress one year. So it's kind of funny

02:02:22.660 --> 02:02:29.620
how like all these Google jokes come alive in the real world. So SSG100 Matt says, I mean,

02:02:29.620 --> 02:02:39.620
to be fair, how many OLR in jokes have been made into games? Two bungee ferret tossing and pixel

02:02:39.620 --> 02:02:47.460
shits, right? Or pixel poops on the Vita. So, yeah. All right. So that so far, we don't know

02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:52.980
of any mystery projects that may be coming. All right. Moving on. Let's travel around the world

02:02:52.980 --> 02:02:57.540
and check out some release dates of things coming a little sooner than bungee ferret tossing too.

02:02:58.420 --> 02:03:06.420
Yep. So this week we've got BPM bullets per minute. That's that rhythm of FPS that's coming

02:03:06.420 --> 02:03:14.900
out on PC. Fight crab on Nintendo switch. Your crabs and your fighting. Spelunky 2.

02:03:15.540 --> 02:03:20.420
What else do you need to know? I mean, it's literally what it is. You have like

02:03:20.420 --> 02:03:29.140
crabs of weapons. There's Spelunky 2 on PlayStation 4. Welcome to Elk on PC and Xbox One.

02:03:29.780 --> 02:03:38.180
Crisis Remastered on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Super Mario 3D All-Stars on Nintendo Switch

02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:44.820
and WWE 2K Battlegrounds on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Stadia.

02:03:46.340 --> 02:03:51.060
That's it. All right. Let's travel to Japan. We're on the Nintendo Switch this week. You can check

02:03:51.060 --> 02:03:58.180
out Azure Lane. Crosswave comes out on September 17th. Atomic Crops also comes out on September

02:03:58.180 --> 02:04:03.620
17th. And then the Super Mario 3D All-Stars also gets a release in Japan the same day as the rest

02:04:03.620 --> 02:04:09.300
of the world, September 18th. And it looks like a one mother game for the 17th, excuse me. Pro

02:04:09.300 --> 02:04:15.540
Yaku Famitsa 2020, which Loki just mentioned for the US as well. Checking the PlayStation 4. I

02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:22.020
imagine you're going to have some overlap. Atomic Crops is on the PlayStation 4 as well and E-Football

02:04:22.020 --> 02:04:28.500
PES 2021 season update. So literally just a roster update coming for Konami and Pro Evo Soccer in

02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:33.460
Japan. And that is it for the PlayStation 4 this week. A little lighter over there than the Switch.

02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:37.460
So there you go. All right. We have a few more headlines and then we're going to get to the

02:04:37.460 --> 02:04:41.300
listener round table with some emails. We do have two emails tonight to get to.

02:04:41.300 --> 02:04:42.980
Still got the European dates.

02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:46.900
Oh, shit. You're right. I skipped those over because Dark Soccer is not here,

02:04:46.900 --> 02:04:50.260
but yes, usually you will pinch hit for those. So thank you. Please, Loki.

02:04:51.220 --> 02:04:58.260
In Europe, we've got a Pro Evolution Soccer 2021 that's coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:04:58.740 --> 02:05:01.540
No Straight Roads on Nintendo Switch.

02:05:01.540 --> 02:05:02.580
Gay Roads Only.

02:05:04.980 --> 02:05:12.020
Super Mario 3D All-Stars on Nintendo Switch. Void Bastards on PlayStation 4 and the Switch.

02:05:12.020 --> 02:05:20.180
NASCAR Heat 5 on PlayStation 4. Looks like we've got Commandos 2 HD Remaster.

02:05:20.180 --> 02:05:26.340
That's going to be coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.

02:05:27.140 --> 02:05:33.460
WWE 2K Battlegrounds on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch and PC as well.

02:05:34.100 --> 02:05:37.700
Beholder Collector's Edition on Switch. And that's it.

02:05:38.580 --> 02:05:43.300
All right. Thank you for not neglecting our UK audience. Appreciate that.

02:05:43.300 --> 02:05:43.860
Of course.

02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:47.940
All right. But we do have some more headlines we're going to get into, including this one.

02:05:48.660 --> 02:05:51.380
Pretty interesting shift to change coming and something we've been

02:05:51.380 --> 02:05:52.980
talking about for a few weeks. Right, Loki?

02:05:53.620 --> 02:06:00.660
Yeah. So Apple has made some changes to their game streaming rules, which apparently

02:06:01.380 --> 02:06:06.260
could lead the way for Xcloud and Stadia to be allowed onto the App Store.

02:06:06.260 --> 02:06:12.180
However, there's some caveats with that. So streaming games are permitted as long as they

02:06:12.180 --> 02:06:18.260
adhere to all of their guidelines. And I guess each update must be submitted for review.

02:06:18.260 --> 02:06:23.300
Developers must provide appropriate metadata for search and games must use in-app purchases

02:06:23.300 --> 02:06:28.740
to unlock features or functionality. Each streaming game must be submitted

02:06:28.740 --> 02:06:33.700
to the App Store as an individual app. So that's kind of irritating.

02:06:33.700 --> 02:06:39.620
So, for example, if you have Xcloud, Halo would have to be its own app.

02:06:39.620 --> 02:06:43.620
Forza would have to be its own app. Gears of War would have to be its own app,

02:06:43.620 --> 02:06:48.660
which is absolutely stupid. But that's the way that they're forcing it to be done.

02:06:49.860 --> 02:06:56.420
Each game streaming service may offer a catalog app on the App Store to help users sign up for

02:06:56.420 --> 02:07:01.140
the service and find the games on the App Store, provided the apps adhere to all the guidelines.

02:07:01.140 --> 02:07:05.220
So basically you can have a catalog app that basically links you to the other

02:07:05.860 --> 02:07:08.500
individual games that you have to download to your device.

02:07:10.100 --> 02:07:15.700
I have some mixed thoughts on this. Obviously, we know that banning the streaming apps was not the

02:07:15.700 --> 02:07:20.820
direction we wanted to see Apple taking. So it does seem like we might have our first crack in

02:07:20.820 --> 02:07:27.540
the glass. And this is very different from the Apple and Fortnite situation. That's a whole

02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:32.180
other thing. We're not getting into that again tonight. Although things are still happening in

02:07:32.180 --> 02:07:36.260
that space, but it's basically more legal documents. Well, you did this, more legal

02:07:36.260 --> 02:07:40.580
documents. You did that. But anyway, back on this, I think, and I said, I don't think Apple

02:07:40.580 --> 02:07:46.100
is on the right side with this because they don't review every movie on Netflix. They don't review

02:07:46.100 --> 02:07:51.380
every song on Spotify. Why do they want to review every game that's going out on streaming? Which is

02:07:51.380 --> 02:07:58.260
kind of what this policy is, right? They literally want to review every game. And I think the

02:07:58.260 --> 02:08:03.540
companies maybe want to put, and I still don't think this is going to be the final answer

02:08:03.540 --> 02:08:07.300
because perception is everything. And I think the users are still like,

02:08:07.300 --> 02:08:15.220
no, this isn't really what we want. And if Netflix can have Bandersnatch, which is a game,

02:08:15.220 --> 02:08:21.940
and I'm sorry, the Black Mirror Bandersnatch episode, which is a game, and Netflix can have

02:08:21.940 --> 02:08:27.220
the Minecraft story mode, which is a game, and that isn't a problem, then there's kind of like

02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:31.140
a double standard there, right? Yes, there's lots of things like that, yeah.

02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:34.740
Here's the thing. I don't think anybody else, well, it's the internet, probably somebody posted

02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:39.860
on a forum somewhere, but I want to talk about what I think the issue is here, what the real

02:08:39.860 --> 02:08:47.620
sticking point is here, and why Apple's doing this. And here it is. I know a lot of you in

02:08:47.620 --> 02:08:53.460
chat are like, oh, it's money or Apple's selfish. No, come on, come on, get past all that. What is

02:08:53.460 --> 02:09:01.300
the real answer? I'm going to tell you what it is. It's the games on xCloud and the games on Stadia

02:09:01.940 --> 02:09:10.340
that are also mobile phone games. Those are the problem. And that I think is the issue that has

02:09:10.340 --> 02:09:17.460
to be worked out. What do I mean by that? My example is, let's say Microsoft next week is

02:09:17.460 --> 02:09:22.740
going to add Sayonara Wild Hearts to Game Pass. I don't know that that's the case. I'm making it up.

02:09:23.700 --> 02:09:28.180
So Microsoft adds Sayonara Wild Hearts, which great, you can play that with a Game Pass

02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:32.820
subscription, right? With an xCloud subscription and all that, right? So you could download this

02:09:32.820 --> 02:09:38.420
separate app to your phone and play that. Wait a minute. There's a problem. Sayonara Wild Hearts

02:09:38.420 --> 02:09:46.820
is also a standalone Apple game. I'm sorry, not Apple first party game, I'm sorry. Standalone app

02:09:46.820 --> 02:09:51.700
that is available through Apple Arcade, which is another complication, but we'll say is also

02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:57.220
something that stands on its own. That is the problem. And I think-

02:09:57.220 --> 02:10:01.620
Yeah, but I think that's a problem that Apple should have because it's the developer of the

02:10:01.620 --> 02:10:05.380
game should be able to decide, hey, I want my game to be played free with this thing.

02:10:05.380 --> 02:10:09.860
It really isn't up to Apple. I mean, the developer can change the price of their game to free at any

02:10:09.860 --> 02:10:17.380
point. It's not for Apple to decide that. But to say that, Loki, is then saying, well, then we

02:10:17.380 --> 02:10:21.620
should just allow the Epic Store on iOS, which I don't think we should.

02:10:24.020 --> 02:10:29.780
I mean, I don't know. I'm not going to take Apple's defense here. And the reason why,

02:10:29.780 --> 02:10:37.780
aside from this, is just like all of the fuckery that they do with their physical devices and

02:10:37.780 --> 02:10:43.700
making it difficult for independent repair shops to fix that stuff. They purposely go out of the

02:10:43.700 --> 02:10:48.820
way to screw the consumer on a lot of things. But they're always saying it's in the best interest

02:10:48.820 --> 02:10:53.860
of the consumer. It's really just to make themselves money. And I have a feeling that

02:10:53.860 --> 02:11:01.140
the only reason they're changing these guidelines is not necessarily to open it up to Microsoft

02:11:01.140 --> 02:11:08.100
and Google to put these streaming services on this device. It's more to protect them from an

02:11:08.100 --> 02:11:12.180
upcoming lawsuit regarding this stuff. I think it's basically saying that,

02:11:12.180 --> 02:11:17.220
look, we're playing fair. We're allowing them to be on here, but they have to follow our rules.

02:11:17.220 --> 02:11:21.860
And unfortunately, it's just the solution they're providing is not adequate enough for these

02:11:21.860 --> 02:11:30.260
streaming services. I get that angle, Loki, but I think there's a part of this where they are

02:11:30.260 --> 02:11:37.620
listening. They're understanding that they are viewed as in the wrong by the consumer base,

02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:44.820
and they have to listen to their consumers. And I think they are trying to resolve this somehow

02:11:45.460 --> 02:11:53.060
to push this forward so they don't look so crappy. Bobby is elaborating on what I was saying in chat.

02:11:54.340 --> 02:11:58.900
Yes, Bobby, what you're saying is where I'm going with this. Apple gets a cut from the iPhone

02:11:58.900 --> 02:12:03.460
version. Apple would not get a cut of the Game Pass version, even though the consumer pays for

02:12:03.460 --> 02:12:08.420
both versions. So Apple has a vested interest in promoting the app-native version over the

02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:13.060
cloud version. They do have language that says you cannot make sure that the customer has paid

02:12:13.060 --> 02:12:18.500
for an app twice, or rather you have to make sure there are no duplicate purchases. So if someone

02:12:18.500 --> 02:12:26.420
bought Sayonara Wild Hearts, they should not be allowed to play it on Game Pass. This is just my

02:12:26.420 --> 02:12:32.420
honest, trying to take a step back and not be like, oh, I'm team Apple. To try to figure out

02:12:32.420 --> 02:12:39.620
what is the sticking point here, this is it. The games that exist both on Xbox and potentially Game

02:12:39.620 --> 02:12:46.500
Pass and as a standalone iOS Android game, those games that are, and who's to say this isn't going

02:12:46.500 --> 02:12:52.420
to be a problem for Android as well? Maybe they just haven't thought of this yet. The games that

02:12:52.420 --> 02:13:00.180
exist in both places, this has to be figured out. And I kind of think the ultimate resolution to

02:13:00.180 --> 02:13:08.660
this, if Apple does cave on this, there's going to be a clout that will exclude certain games from

02:13:08.660 --> 02:13:16.020
Game Pass. And it's going to be any game that has a standalone app on mobile stores cannot be a part

02:13:16.020 --> 02:13:22.340
of Game Pass or Stadia or any of these. And that is how this resolves. Mark my words. I don't think

02:13:22.340 --> 02:13:26.740
it's going to be a problem though on Android because they already have xCloud on Android and

02:13:26.740 --> 02:13:33.140
it's working just fine. And obviously Stadia is working on Android because it's a Google product.

02:13:33.140 --> 02:13:33.640
Fair.

02:13:34.420 --> 02:13:40.340
So I don't think, obviously, these are not going to be issues. It's just because Apple's being

02:13:40.340 --> 02:13:48.180
Apple. I don't know what, they can do whatever they want. It's their ecosystem. But I don't like

02:13:48.180 --> 02:13:53.140
how their ecosystem is such a closed, it's walled off from everybody else and they're not being

02:13:53.140 --> 02:13:58.180
flexible on anything. But they have, they're well within the right to do that. But I'm also well

02:13:58.180 --> 02:14:02.100
within my right to think that they're stupid for doing it and not buying their products, which is

02:14:02.100 --> 02:14:07.220
what I'm going to continue to do. So yeah, you can still still ultimately vote with your wallet.

02:14:07.220 --> 02:14:12.180
But I do think they're going to end up bending. And I think that's going to be the agreement. I

02:14:12.180 --> 02:14:17.620
think xCloud and Stadia will be allowed on iOS, but the written agreement will be you cannot put

02:14:17.620 --> 02:14:23.540
a game out that exists as a standalone app. And that's, that's that. So clip it because we're

02:14:23.540 --> 02:14:27.780
going to play it again when that ends up happening. Well, I was gonna say, Bobby's saying that many

02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:31.300
consumers like the walled garden because they feel it's safer. And who do you think put that

02:14:31.300 --> 02:14:35.620
into their head that it's safer when it's walled off like that? It's Apple's marketing that said

02:14:35.620 --> 02:14:41.300
that. So you know, that that's what it is. It's the perception put in by Apple saying, well,

02:14:41.300 --> 02:14:45.940
this is why we do is because it's, it's safer for you. You don't want those viruses, do you?

02:14:45.940 --> 02:14:50.900
We check everything. But really, there's no risk to the consumer, you know, for the streaming

02:14:50.900 --> 02:14:55.700
services to put a virus on their phone or something like that. It is a streaming service.

02:14:55.700 --> 02:15:00.740
It's it's just like Netflix, you're not worried about getting a virus on your TV or, or your phone

02:15:00.740 --> 02:15:04.980
from watching Netflix or Hulu or whatever. So why should this be any different? I'm with black and

02:15:04.980 --> 02:15:10.340
pad. I like the walls. I mean, because I feel like with Apple kind of going through with the quality

02:15:10.340 --> 02:15:14.420
check and all that stuff, and not having all the sideloading and all that stuff, like everything

02:15:14.500 --> 02:15:21.700
runs at a certain rate, that your performance isn't degraded. And and Allen uses Android,

02:15:21.700 --> 02:15:25.620
and sometimes I see him run apps. I'm like, why is this frame rate so terrible? Oh, because there's

02:15:25.620 --> 02:15:30.740
other things running on the side and all this other stuff going on. I just know it's because

02:15:30.740 --> 02:15:37.540
that Android unfortunately, unlike Apple doesn't necessarily have a finite amount of systems to

02:15:37.540 --> 02:15:43.380
develop for. And so you have, you know, mixed compatibility, because how do you test your device

02:15:43.380 --> 02:15:48.580
or your program to run on every single possible system that's out there? All right, that's why

02:15:48.580 --> 02:15:53.460
the Apple Android debate is not going to be settled here tonight. Let's move on to the next

02:15:53.460 --> 02:15:58.980
story. You know what, I'm glad there's options. It shouldn't just be one company controlling

02:15:58.980 --> 02:16:04.580
everything. So I'm glad we can have this debate about Apple versus Android. All right. Let's

02:16:04.580 --> 02:16:09.540
talk about a game that has you know, and it shouldn't be one game. That's always the number

02:16:09.540 --> 02:16:14.420
one game on Twitch either, right? It shouldn't be Fortnite forever. And it wasn't it. I mean,

02:16:14.420 --> 02:16:20.420
it used to be for a long time it was PUBG, right? And it's still PUBG still does very well. Of

02:16:20.420 --> 02:16:25.220
course, World of Warcraft was a huge game League of Legends. I mean, not to say those games aren't

02:16:25.220 --> 02:16:30.180
still huge, but you know what I mean? Games come and games go from the number one spot and a new

02:16:30.180 --> 02:16:34.660
game is showing up at the top of Twitch a lot lately. And there are some articles about the

02:16:34.660 --> 02:16:40.820
sudden rise of the game Among Us, which I must admit I haven't played but my understanding is

02:16:40.820 --> 02:16:46.980
it is a social deception game. So social deception games are things like werewolf,

02:16:46.980 --> 02:16:55.300
the resistance. I love me some survivor and that type of stuff. I like the game Big Brother. I

02:16:55.300 --> 02:17:00.180
don't like what it's turned into on TV. There's a lot of ugly shit on the show. But the game is

02:17:00.180 --> 02:17:07.140
a concept. I think it's kind of interesting. So I think these, you know, kind of like social

02:17:07.140 --> 02:17:13.780
deception games. Now we have one that is showing up in and I will admit, I don't know exactly how

02:17:13.780 --> 02:17:18.660
Among Us works. I can tell you exactly how it works. Okay, I've actually seen some of it. So

02:17:18.660 --> 02:17:24.820
the way it works is basically your your crew of 10 that's working on to afford a 10 I should say

02:17:24.820 --> 02:17:33.380
that it's working on you basically preparing a ship for launch. And so you're you're doing

02:17:33.380 --> 02:17:37.940
different tasks that you have in there to basically complete that. So there's little

02:17:37.940 --> 02:17:44.100
mini games and stuff that you do. However, there's some people among you that are actually saboteurs

02:17:44.100 --> 02:17:50.340
that are trying to, to stop everything. And the whole point is, oh, my God, that was the

02:17:50.340 --> 02:17:55.860
it's the greatest reality TV show of all time, the mole, you're telling me it's the mole.

02:17:55.860 --> 02:18:01.300
It's basically the mole. So basically, you do all that. And then after each round, Anderson Cooper

02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:07.620
there? No, necessarily. But like, after each round, you you call a meeting error, I guess

02:18:07.620 --> 02:18:12.740
basically, they can call a meeting vote on who they feel is suspicious. And set, they basically

02:18:12.740 --> 02:18:18.820
kick them through the airlock. So, and so like, if you're a saboteur, you're trying to break stuff,

02:18:18.820 --> 02:18:22.660
you're trying to kill other crew members. But there's folks that are like, you know,

02:18:24.180 --> 02:18:29.860
have like cameras, like a watch stuff. It's basically, it's trying to look like,

02:18:29.860 --> 02:18:34.100
you know, like you're not causing trouble, but also causing trouble at the same time.

02:18:34.100 --> 02:18:40.100
Okay, and it's the mole that way. Yeah. Oh, my God, that's, that's fucking amazing. I'm gonna

02:18:40.100 --> 02:18:44.100
have to check this game out. I really am. So I mean, you can see why just in talking about the

02:18:44.100 --> 02:18:48.580
game. And I can completely see why, especially with the whole like social deception. People love

02:18:48.580 --> 02:18:53.700
to see people fight. That's why a lot of these reality shows are based in social deception and

02:18:53.700 --> 02:18:58.740
why shows like Survivor have been on for 20 years. That's essentially a social deception game. I mean,

02:18:58.740 --> 02:19:03.220
it might not be a mole per se, but it's lying to someone's face. No, no, you and I got to stick

02:19:03.220 --> 02:19:06.500
together and vote this other person out. And then you vote for, you know, them. You know, it's,

02:19:06.500 --> 02:19:10.660
that's the stuff that, you know, these reality shows are at their core. And they're very,

02:19:11.220 --> 02:19:14.820
it's very fast. And then of course, like Werewolf, the classic convention game,

02:19:15.620 --> 02:19:21.860
is a social deception game. And yes, these games are huge. So this has done very, very well on

02:19:21.860 --> 02:19:29.300
Twitch. And apparently, they are saying that the creators behind Among Us is that Mafia,

02:19:29.300 --> 02:19:34.740
which is basically Werewolf, same thing, inspired this game. But apparently, it was originally going

02:19:34.740 --> 02:19:41.700
to be a mobile only local multiplayer experience with just one map. But it didn't do that great

02:19:41.700 --> 02:19:46.820
when it first came out. But based on feedback and some other things, they decided to stick

02:19:46.820 --> 02:19:52.340
with the game, build it up and do these different updates. And now, they have the game to where it

02:19:52.340 --> 02:19:59.700
is now. And it's doing very, very well online. Apparently, it's kind of started to get popularity

02:19:59.700 --> 02:20:05.940
in Korea, then really took off there. YouTuber ran with it. And now it's, it's all over Twitch. And

02:20:05.940 --> 02:20:10.580
now I'm interested in it. I gotta say, I want to check this game out. Although I can be a terrible

02:20:10.580 --> 02:20:15.460
liar. I don't know why. But I'm pretty good at serve. I mean, I joked about when I played that

02:20:15.460 --> 02:20:20.740
fake survivor game online last year, I got really good at the ability to just lie straight up lie to

02:20:20.740 --> 02:20:23.940
somebody and say, Oh, no, we're sticking together. I'm not going to vote you out. And then I wrote

02:20:23.940 --> 02:20:30.500
their name down the next tribal council. But I can be a horrible liar. Sometimes I'm not very

02:20:30.500 --> 02:20:36.100
good at things like the resistance. But I'd be curious to see how I do in a game like this.

02:20:37.060 --> 02:20:39.700
What do you think? Why do you think this game is doing very popular?

02:20:40.340 --> 02:20:46.820
I think it's just because of it's fun to watch people play it. It's also a relatively

02:20:46.820 --> 02:20:52.980
inexpensive games like five bucks on Steam. So go check it out. It's just it's simple to

02:20:54.100 --> 02:20:58.100
get how to play the game. And it's kind of difficult to master because you have to

02:20:58.100 --> 02:21:04.500
be good at lying to people. And I don't know, it's has a lot of opportunity to be pretty funny.

02:21:05.220 --> 02:21:09.540
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says the mole with Anderson Cooper was the greatest reality game

02:21:09.540 --> 02:21:15.300
show ever. Don't at me. Bobby is correct. I need a little I need a little banner. I need a little

02:21:15.300 --> 02:21:19.860
graphic a little doo doo doo doo. When when Bobby says something like that. And I can just say

02:21:19.860 --> 02:21:26.740
Bobby is correct. A little a little floating wolf head surrounded by stars that says Bobby is

02:21:26.740 --> 02:21:32.820
correct. That in comic sans font. That is yes, that factual statement. Well, obviously, the

02:21:32.820 --> 02:21:37.140
mole is the greatest reality show. I would have loved to have gone on a show like that. It was

02:21:37.140 --> 02:21:41.620
here. Let me read this on real people. So let me just elaborate a little bit more about what

02:21:41.620 --> 02:21:46.340
this game is about. So like they're talking about what each like the crew and the imposter. So

02:21:46.340 --> 02:21:49.780
the crew is basically supposed to win by completing tasks to prepare to ship to

02:21:50.420 --> 02:21:56.660
or ejecting all imposters react quickly to undo the imposter sabotages. Check the admin map

02:21:56.660 --> 02:22:01.220
security cameras to keep tabs on other crew members report any dead bodies immediately

02:22:01.220 --> 02:22:06.740
to start discussion who they suspected the imposter is imposters was to kill the crewmates

02:22:06.740 --> 02:22:10.900
or frame bystanders. Pretend to run tasks and blended with crewmates. You can sneak through

02:22:10.900 --> 02:22:16.260
events to move quickly through the ship and sabotage to cause chaos and divide the crew

02:22:16.260 --> 02:22:24.020
closed doors to trap victims and kill in private. So sounds fun. All right, cross play between

02:22:24.020 --> 02:22:29.780
apparently it is on mobile, so Android and iOS. And it's cross played between that and PC. So it

02:22:29.780 --> 02:22:36.660
looks pretty cool. All right, I'm gonna have to check this game out at some point. It sounds like

02:22:36.660 --> 02:22:41.380
I've been missing out. And I'm always late to the party on this shit. I thought I was cool. And I

02:22:41.380 --> 02:22:46.580
kind of discovered fall guys early like everybody else. But now it seems like fall guys has already

02:22:46.580 --> 02:22:51.300
fallen to number two or three on the rankings. Because now there's this new kid in town. So

02:22:51.300 --> 02:22:57.060
yeah, be interesting. All right, let's move on. These updates are somewhat controversial,

02:22:57.060 --> 02:23:04.100
right? Loki because they're coming from a hack that probably should not have happened. I just

02:23:04.100 --> 02:23:10.180
just so you know where my head is at with OLR. We are talking about video games, gaming culture,

02:23:10.180 --> 02:23:17.060
and your lifestyle. And I think whether we like it or not, this happened. And people are talking

02:23:17.060 --> 02:23:22.740
about it. And it's on gaming blogs. It's on news. It's on social media. So I'm bringing it to

02:23:23.300 --> 02:23:28.260
the dinner table or Loki's bringing it to the dinner table tonight. And it is more things that

02:23:28.260 --> 02:23:33.060
have come out of that Nintendo hack. Yeah, so there's more stuff coming out of this tag. They

02:23:33.060 --> 02:23:39.540
call it Giga leak three or whatever. So and they said basically, it evolves a huge lot check. Who's

02:23:39.540 --> 02:23:46.900
they? 4chan, right? Or probably 4chan. Okay. Whoever whoever was that hacked everything and

02:23:46.900 --> 02:23:51.380
got a list. But it's a dump of like Gameboy and Gameboy Color games that were either finished

02:23:51.380 --> 02:23:56.340
or close to being finished and sent off to Nintendo for internal certification. But a

02:23:56.340 --> 02:24:01.380
lot of these games never made it out. So for example, one of the games that was part of the

02:24:01.380 --> 02:24:09.460
hack was Pokemon Picross, which was cancelled game from 1999. So it kind of neat there is a

02:24:09.460 --> 02:24:15.220
gimmick land tomato adventure for the Gameboy Color. There's some Hello Kitty pocket camera

02:24:15.220 --> 02:24:22.100
game for the Gameboy Camera. That's interesting. There is a rock board, which is a game that came

02:24:22.100 --> 02:24:26.260
out on the Famicom as Mega Man board game. But there's also currently a Gameboy version that

02:24:26.260 --> 02:24:33.780
leaked out lots of different games theory because the break man says, so it's a bunch of bad games.

02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:37.940
Well, I mean, the Rockman board game might have been some up some people's alley. And I think

02:24:37.940 --> 02:24:42.660
those Picross games tend to do well. And I think the idea of a Pokemon Picross sounds really cute.

02:24:42.660 --> 02:24:46.980
But the problem, quote unquote, with some of these games is that they were relatively

02:24:46.980 --> 02:24:52.260
late in the Gameboy cycle, right? So it was kind of like, it was not felt the money was

02:24:52.260 --> 02:24:57.140
I mean, we're guessing, sorry, we're theorizing that the reason why they didn't come out was that

02:24:57.140 --> 02:25:02.500
probably Nintendo did not feel it was worth the money to publish, make the cartridges,

02:25:02.500 --> 02:25:06.340
do the advertising campaign, because there was no digital release back then, right? They couldn't

02:25:06.420 --> 02:25:12.580
just release Pokemon Picross digitally, they could now. But they are probably not going to.

02:25:13.700 --> 02:25:18.020
And, you know, because a lot of the Picross games they released digitally now at this point,

02:25:18.020 --> 02:25:21.220
so it wasn't really felt in their best interest, because they were probably moving on to the

02:25:21.220 --> 02:25:26.900
advance and those sorts of things. So it's, um, but I don't necessarily think the games

02:25:26.900 --> 02:25:32.580
looked bad. I mean, the Hello Kitty camera thing is probably a cash in of sorts.

02:25:33.460 --> 02:25:38.900
So like, so if you're interested, check this out. There's a user on Twitch, Luigi blood

02:25:38.900 --> 02:25:44.260
that streamed a three hour long stream, showing off some of these ROMs. So one of the games that

02:25:44.260 --> 02:25:49.220
I'm looking at here almost looks like Star Fox, but it's on the Gameboy, which is kind of crazy.

02:25:49.220 --> 02:25:53.380
So it's almost like vector graphics and stuff. And I'm being corrected by Bobby and chat who

02:25:53.380 --> 02:25:59.620
loves his Picross. It's how I got introduced to Picross Pokemon Picross was on the 3ds.

02:25:59.700 --> 02:26:05.540
It was a free to play game on the 3ds. Well, I, so they may have taken some of the same concepts

02:26:05.540 --> 02:26:10.660
and then reintroduced it later on. So maybe at one point it was this standalone Gameboy color game

02:26:10.660 --> 02:26:15.460
and Nintendo took, I would be curious if some of the designs and things ended up carrying over and

02:26:15.460 --> 02:26:20.180
being the same probably was so Nintendo probably just carried some of it over to the 3ds. So

02:26:20.180 --> 02:26:25.940
that's very interesting. Yeah. There's lots of interesting looking games here, but, um,

02:26:26.660 --> 02:26:29.940
yeah, like I said, you know, if you're interested in checking out, I mean, it's, it's all over

02:26:29.940 --> 02:26:34.580
Twitter and all over, um, it looks like it's at least on Twitch a little bit. So, yeah,

02:26:35.620 --> 02:26:38.740
some of these look kind of cool. It's that weird gray area where it's like,

02:26:38.740 --> 02:26:43.780
it's a part of gaming history, but it also isn't, it wasn't really meant to ever be discovered. So

02:26:44.500 --> 02:26:49.780
I, I don't know, it's a really weird space. I kind of think ultimately these games are going

02:26:49.780 --> 02:26:54.020
to be talked about and buzzed about for a week. And then the internet is going to move on to

02:26:54.020 --> 02:26:58.020
something else because that's what usually happens. It will be interesting to see the

02:26:58.020 --> 02:27:05.140
approach that historians kind of take, but I don't think that they really can like archive

02:27:05.140 --> 02:27:10.100
these actual games because they were never really released, but it would be an interesting chapter

02:27:10.100 --> 02:27:15.860
in a book somewhere. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know how the historians perspective on this.

02:27:15.860 --> 02:27:21.380
I'd really like to invite one on the show and ask, how do you, what, what is you, what is your angle

02:27:21.380 --> 02:27:26.820
with these leaks? Because technically it's all illegal, but it is a part of gaming history.

02:27:26.820 --> 02:27:33.940
How do you file this away? I don't know. I don't know either. It's, it's, it's complicated. That's,

02:27:33.940 --> 02:27:37.860
that's the answer. All right. I know at least like, especially like the emulation scene and

02:27:37.860 --> 02:27:42.180
stuff, there's not a lot that they could do with some of the code and stuff that I remember,

02:27:42.180 --> 02:27:45.460
because like the previous leaks, they have like the official emulators that were on,

02:27:46.420 --> 02:27:53.060
you know, the DS or, you know, the Wii. So they can't really use that for their code

02:27:53.060 --> 02:27:58.420
because they would get in trouble with that. Right. Cause then, then you cross lines from

02:27:58.420 --> 02:28:03.060
it's legal cause you don't have any, you know, commercial ROMs or whatever with it too.

02:28:03.060 --> 02:28:09.140
It's illegal cause you stole it. So yeah, emulator teams have to very much keep themselves

02:28:09.140 --> 02:28:12.180
siloed from this stuff. And that's come up before when we talked about, you know,

02:28:12.180 --> 02:28:17.380
I think the PlayStation, was it the PlayStation mini hack? I think was a part of that or something.

02:28:18.500 --> 02:28:24.340
No, not necessarily with that, but yeah, there's like, I think it was with the DS and the 3DS.

02:28:24.340 --> 02:28:29.140
They had like some hacks with the software for those. Right. All right. Well, moving on to

02:28:29.140 --> 02:28:35.540
something in a little less of a gray area, this is something I think old school fans of this program

02:28:35.540 --> 02:28:39.940
and old school music game fans and new school music game fans will be very excited about. And

02:28:39.940 --> 02:28:43.860
I'm ending the show tonight on a music game. Well, getting to the end of the show tonight on

02:28:43.860 --> 02:28:49.860
a music game related story, and it is the game series, pop and music. And Konami has announced

02:28:49.860 --> 02:28:55.780
yet again, another Bamani series for PC, and it is pop and music, and it's going to be called pop

02:28:55.780 --> 02:29:02.500
and music lively. If you're unfamiliar with pop and music, it is a nine button game. There's five

02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:07.060
in the front, four in the back, and you kind of hit the buttons in line with the music. And these

02:29:07.060 --> 02:29:10.900
are giant buttons. If you ever see an arcade machine in an anime convention or something,

02:29:11.940 --> 02:29:15.620
I always say it's trouble with the pop-o-matic bubble. You know that game with the dice in the

02:29:15.620 --> 02:29:19.460
middle and you hit that. It's like that, but nine of those that are like the buttons that control

02:29:19.460 --> 02:29:23.940
the game. It's a lot of fun to play, but it can't hurt your hands. And it will probably be a lot

02:29:23.940 --> 02:29:30.900
easier on a mechanical keyboard where you're not going to hurt your hands so much. There is a beta

02:29:30.900 --> 02:29:36.980
with five limited time songs in this limited time beta. There are five songs. They are all Japanese

02:29:37.860 --> 02:29:44.180
pop and music games, including pop and music 17, 18, 20, Lapistoria, and pop and music peace.

02:29:44.180 --> 02:29:49.700
So there's just one song selection from those different games. You do have to have a Konami

02:29:49.700 --> 02:29:55.460
account to participate in the beta, and it is on Konami's website. I haven't played it myself.

02:29:55.460 --> 02:29:59.780
I'm just imagining it's all in Japanese at this time, as most of these releases have been.

02:30:00.580 --> 02:30:06.580
But my.konami.net is the place to start, and the beta client is on Japanese website. So you

02:30:06.900 --> 02:30:11.140
will have to have some type of understanding of Japanese to probably get through the game,

02:30:11.140 --> 02:30:15.940
although I'm sure there's going to be guides online somewhere. Dark Tetsuya says,

02:30:15.940 --> 02:30:20.820
admittedly, I really only played pop and once on console back when we all got together to play that

02:30:20.820 --> 02:30:25.380
stuff. But if this ever gets an official release, I'd be down. Yeah, I hope it makes its way here

02:30:26.180 --> 02:30:30.340
stateside. I've played it in the arcade. Conventions are a great way to keep playing

02:30:30.340 --> 02:30:34.580
the game. And round one, you usually will still see at least one pop and music machine at around

02:30:34.580 --> 02:30:39.220
one somewhere. It might not be in the front with the other stuff, but it'll be around there. And

02:30:39.940 --> 02:30:45.300
it's a fun game to play. And you got to learn to play nine button mode. Just go straight into nine

02:30:45.300 --> 02:30:52.340
buttons. It's so much more fun that way. Right, Logie? I was never very good at music to play

02:30:52.340 --> 02:30:58.740
with nine buttons. All right. I think I've tried. Let's move on. This is the part where you guys

02:30:58.740 --> 02:31:02.980
get to have more of your voices on the show. We've been reading some of your chat comments all night.

02:31:02.980 --> 02:31:07.540
But if you have something you'd like to add, please ask away in our chat room over twitch.tv

02:31:07.540 --> 02:31:14.420
slash vog network. That's twitch.tv slash vog network as we are taping along live with our show.

02:31:16.740 --> 02:31:20.820
But I have some emails to get to during the segment as well. Every week, you guys can email us.

02:31:20.820 --> 02:31:26.260
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com and we read some of the emails on the show. So we do have two

02:31:26.260 --> 02:31:32.100
emails tonight. Let me get to our first email, which is from Robert M that says, I'm also

02:31:32.100 --> 02:31:36.340
surprised you hadn't covered Street Fighter 2 the World Warriors for the game of the week. And that

02:31:36.340 --> 02:31:41.940
was the classic game two weeks ago before on our last episode, if you recall. Listening when the

02:31:41.940 --> 02:31:46.900
episode aired on the 30th reminded me how the title theme is always connected in my mind with

02:31:46.900 --> 02:31:53.300
the taste of shock tarts. It's been ages since I've tried to hunt down the candy. That is a very

02:31:53.300 --> 02:31:59.860
interesting association. Are there any video games you associate with food, Logie? I'm trying to

02:31:59.860 --> 02:32:07.460
think if I have associated anything with food. I mean, food that I eat or just food in general.

02:32:07.460 --> 02:32:12.980
I mean, really the only food that you eat, like Street Fighter 2 reminds Robert M of shock tarts.

02:32:13.860 --> 02:32:27.300
Oh, no, not really. I mean, I can say vaguely Halloween candy reminds me of Super Mario 3

02:32:27.380 --> 02:32:32.020
because the night one of my good friends at the time and I stayed up all night long,

02:32:32.580 --> 02:32:37.220
literally all night long playing Super Mario Brothers 3 was on Halloween and we were going

02:32:37.220 --> 02:32:44.340
through Halloween candy like crazy and eating it and playing Mario Brothers 3. So that would be an

02:32:44.340 --> 02:32:50.820
association I have. Dark Tetsuya says, I have one mechanized attack on NES and pepperoni pizza

02:32:50.820 --> 02:32:56.660
combos. No one special says, I pretty much associate any retro arcade game with pizza and

02:32:56.660 --> 02:33:04.740
Pepsi. The break man says, Turkey reminds me of Final Fantasy 3. I love that. She-Hulk 10 says,

02:33:04.740 --> 02:33:11.540
Donkey Kong and bananas. Why not? In Donkey Kong country, you're collecting a ton of them. Why not?

02:33:12.180 --> 02:33:18.500
All right. Let me finish the email here. Robert M continues saying, also, if you're shouting out

02:33:18.500 --> 02:33:27.460
New Horizons dream addresses, mine is DA572727801688. And if you need that again,

02:33:27.460 --> 02:33:34.100
just hit that 15 seconds backward on your player. I believe if the Sakura of Koholint is Jamie,

02:33:34.100 --> 02:33:39.700
I visited last month. It is. And so, yes, you did visit. From what I can remember, really nice. And

02:33:39.700 --> 02:33:42.980
that's from Robert M. And I will have to check out your town at some point, Robert M.

02:33:42.980 --> 02:33:47.540
So the dream codes that they have, because I know like if you visit other towns, like you get more

02:33:47.540 --> 02:33:52.260
stuff in your nook shop, because we're trying to get more stuff in our nook shop because it's the

02:33:52.260 --> 02:33:55.940
same old items that keep cycling through. And I think if you visit other islands, you get more

02:33:55.940 --> 02:34:01.620
stuff. Do you know if that works with the dream stuff? I would probably not. I don't know.

02:34:01.620 --> 02:34:07.300
I haven't a clue. All right. You got to ask Jamie. She's the Animal Crossing guru.

02:34:08.260 --> 02:34:13.620
Yep. All right. A quick note from our chat room before we get to our next email for the round

02:34:13.620 --> 02:34:20.500
table here. SSJ100Matt says, Magfest met their 100K donation goal during the show. Earlier this

02:34:20.500 --> 02:34:25.060
week, they decided to cancel next year's show without force majeure, meaning they were on the

02:34:25.060 --> 02:34:29.060
hook for costs. But thankfully, they met their goal. Well, congratulations to Magfest. Yeah,

02:34:29.060 --> 02:34:34.740
we hadn't gotten to that during the show tonight yet. But they did cancel Magfest for January of

02:34:34.740 --> 02:34:41.540
next year. Obviously, the COVID situation is not going to go away that easy. So even though we may

02:34:41.540 --> 02:34:46.020
be at a point where we can hang out in small groups, at that point, a big convention is

02:34:46.020 --> 02:34:50.900
probably still not going to be doable in January. But the big deal is they went ahead and canceled

02:34:50.900 --> 02:34:54.340
and they didn't wait for the legal force majeure thing. So they kind of had to raise money to save

02:34:54.340 --> 02:34:59.380
Magfest, basically. So they did a telethon and it was still going tonight during the show. And it

02:34:59.380 --> 02:35:03.140
sounds like they made their money. So congratulations. That's great. Bobby Blackwolf is

02:35:03.140 --> 02:35:09.460
reminding AGDQ is also going virtual. Little bit of a different situation. They hadn't actually

02:35:09.460 --> 02:35:14.580
announced a hotel or booked a hotel yet. So they're not having to worry about the fact that

02:35:14.580 --> 02:35:19.460
they canceled on anybody. But they are going ahead and making the call that it's going to be virtual.

02:35:19.460 --> 02:35:25.060
So that's two things now in 2021 that are now going to be virtual. And I would expect it's

02:35:25.060 --> 02:35:29.620
probably still going to be a few months into 2021 before we really start seeing big events again.

02:35:30.180 --> 02:35:34.340
It's probably going to be at least March, right? Get through this thing a year. But we'll see.

02:35:34.980 --> 02:35:41.860
And Bobby says they'll still use a hotel as the main command center, though, in Virginia,

02:35:41.860 --> 02:35:49.940
which they did for summer games done quick. So interesting. Also, virtual packs is going on

02:35:49.940 --> 02:35:56.740
right now. I'm kind of confused as to what is going on when. They have like three different

02:35:56.740 --> 02:36:01.460
rooms. And at the bottom of the page does not list the schedule for what's going on.

02:36:02.100 --> 02:36:06.900
But I tuned into some random stuff and I saw somebody I knew on one of the panels. So that

02:36:06.900 --> 02:36:11.860
was kind of fun. I was like, oh, her. I know her. So it was kind of interesting. But it looks like

02:36:11.860 --> 02:36:16.340
they're doing the virtual panel stuff for PAX right now. But have we gotten any game developer

02:36:16.340 --> 02:36:22.980
companies doing announcements like they sometimes would at PAX? Well, I know, was it that there was

02:36:22.980 --> 02:36:27.860
stuff about Borderlands 3 that Gearbox was talking about? Oh, the multiplayer stuff, right?

02:36:28.820 --> 02:36:32.500
On the same screen on PlayStation five, right? Right, right, right. So PlayStation five and

02:36:32.500 --> 02:36:37.700
Xbox Series X, they're going to have four player split screen and then they're going to also do 4K

02:36:37.700 --> 02:36:46.500
60 FPS, I think, on for single player if you do that. So that's that's kind of cool. And

02:36:46.500 --> 02:36:50.980
apparently also there's going to be a vertical split screen options coming as well to current

02:36:50.980 --> 02:36:56.660
generation games. And apparently they're going to be allowing you to transition. You're going to

02:36:56.660 --> 02:37:02.100
have all your add on content and save files will be supported in the transition as well to the next

02:37:02.100 --> 02:37:08.180
chance. All right. Well, let's do all I've heard so far. Let's do one more email tonight from Yyr

02:37:08.180 --> 02:37:12.820
who says, Hello, LR. On the last episode of the show, there was a bit of confusion as far as the

02:37:12.820 --> 02:37:17.700
way Nintendo handles their digital game licenses. Not that anyone can be blamed. After all, for many

02:37:17.700 --> 02:37:21.780
years, Nintendo's way of handling a digital purchase was to simply assign the license to

02:37:21.780 --> 02:37:26.500
the device on which you purchased the game. However, and fortunately, this policy ended with

02:37:26.500 --> 02:37:31.700
the Wii U and the 3DS. Beginning with Nintendo Switch, licenses are assigned not to your device,

02:37:31.700 --> 02:37:38.500
but to your Nintendo account. Pardon me. As long as you have access to your account, you'll be able

02:37:38.500 --> 02:37:43.860
to redownload your games on any Nintendo Switch. You can assign any single Switch console as the

02:37:43.860 --> 02:37:48.900
primary console on your account, and any user of that primary console can access your downloaded

02:37:48.900 --> 02:37:54.260
content. But you can also access your games from any Switch console that you're logged into,

02:37:54.260 --> 02:37:59.540
regardless of whether it's a primary console. This is actually very similar to the way licenses work

02:37:59.540 --> 02:38:04.740
on Xbox. Thank you for clarifying. Yes, it is complicated because Nintendo's done it several

02:38:04.740 --> 02:38:10.100
different ways. So thank you. I'm looking forward to your opinions and analysis on Microsoft's

02:38:10.100 --> 02:38:15.540
announcements this week. I find the Xbox Series S console to be particularly interesting because

02:38:15.540 --> 02:38:20.020
I'm trying to figure out its target audience, possibly consumers who want to play the newest

02:38:20.020 --> 02:38:24.580
games, who don't care about physical copies anymore, who want to save some money, and who

02:38:24.580 --> 02:38:30.180
also don't care much about 4K resolution or 60 frames a second performance. The real question is

02:38:30.180 --> 02:38:35.140
how many folks fit into those categories? Thanks again for the show and have a great week. Why YR?

02:38:35.940 --> 02:38:41.060
Kind of go back to that again. I think it's mainly it's folks trying to game on a budget right now

02:38:41.060 --> 02:38:47.940
because it's why, you know, there's a market for PCs out there, especially like laptops and stuff

02:38:47.940 --> 02:38:54.260
that are mid tier, I guess, if you will. Like not everybody buys a two thousand dollar gaming PC

02:38:55.140 --> 02:39:01.540
to game on. They have graphics cards out there that aren't like the top of the line for stuff.

02:39:01.540 --> 02:39:05.860
I mean, they just released a whole new series of like the Nvidia 3000 cards or whatever, and they

02:39:05.860 --> 02:39:10.820
have like it's getting more powerful even on those lower tier cards. But not everybody has

02:39:10.820 --> 02:39:16.900
to purchase like the top of the line stuff to game. And that's why even 1440p is still really

02:39:16.900 --> 02:39:22.180
good. Yeah, it's going to look great. Even upscale the 4K is still going to look really good. It's

02:39:22.180 --> 02:39:27.540
great. It's not like the best it could be, but maybe you don't care that it's the best it can be.

02:39:28.820 --> 02:39:33.540
And that's what you're wanting to get in honor. You maybe you're buying it for your kids. You

02:39:33.540 --> 02:39:39.060
don't want to drop that kind of money. So like I I think it's still a very they're going with

02:39:39.060 --> 02:39:44.820
the value proposition there because that bundle of games pass is a really good deal. You're

02:39:44.820 --> 02:39:49.700
getting, you know, really good graphics, you know, all the next gen games at launch, you know,

02:39:49.700 --> 02:39:55.220
from first party next gen games. And you have a library of like 100 plus games to play. I mean,

02:39:55.220 --> 02:40:01.860
like that's a really good, easy sell for $299. I think in my opinion and the probably the shortest

02:40:01.860 --> 02:40:08.580
way I can put it is that the Xbox Series X is a living room console. The Xbox Series S

02:40:08.660 --> 02:40:15.380
is a bedroom console. And it's not going to be that, you know, X, Y, Z, X and S for everybody.

02:40:15.380 --> 02:40:22.660
It's not going to be that binary for everybody. Nothing is. But I think generally, that's kind

02:40:22.660 --> 02:40:26.260
of what it breaks down to. If it's kind of like the household secondary console or whatever,

02:40:26.260 --> 02:40:31.540
a bedroom console or kids console, it's the S is going to be just fine. It's still there's still

02:40:31.540 --> 02:40:36.340
a lot it's going to be capable of doing. But if it's meant to be a beefy powerhouse 4K,

02:40:37.300 --> 02:40:42.340
Bobby Black Wolf's basement theater type of thing, like Bobby Black Wolf is not going to waste his

02:40:42.340 --> 02:40:48.180
time with the Series S. He's going to get the Series X for that setup. That's fine, too. Like,

02:40:48.180 --> 02:40:54.260
I was like looking at replacing one of my monitors or I may have to be both of them to replace it

02:40:54.260 --> 02:41:01.700
with a 4K monitor to 120 frames per second. I'm not going to be able to do that relatively easy.

02:41:01.700 --> 02:41:08.740
So, you know, that might be something that would weigh in whether I get an S or an X. Also,

02:41:10.500 --> 02:41:13.860
I don't know when these are going to be available or if they're going to be available or how fast

02:41:13.860 --> 02:41:17.300
they're going to sell out. So, let's see. All right. Let me get to one more roundtable

02:41:17.300 --> 02:41:20.820
question from chat and then I want to get to any last minute stories you might have tonight.

02:41:20.820 --> 02:41:23.620
Thank you for the emails, by the way. More emails if you want to send them,

02:41:23.620 --> 02:41:29.700
participate at orangelaunchradio.com. Last comment here from noinspecial77 who says,

02:41:29.700 --> 02:41:34.900
I personally think that 1UP Arcade Machines are okay cheap alternatives to actual arcade machines.

02:41:34.900 --> 02:41:38.740
They're not quite as good because you can't drop quarters and tokens into them. And most

02:41:38.740 --> 02:41:44.820
retro games used CRT monitors, not modern displays like a 1UP Arcade Machines. So, given the choice,

02:41:44.820 --> 02:41:49.860
I'd get the honest to goodness retro machine. That said, would you get the retro machine or

02:41:49.860 --> 02:41:58.100
is 1UP Arcade Machines good enough, quote unquote. I think you kind of said it. It just depends on

02:41:58.100 --> 02:42:05.140
what you're looking for. If you are looking for that authentic, reminds me of the pizza place I

02:42:05.140 --> 02:42:12.020
had growing up, I'm okay with dropping tokens or having that whole system in my house, then the old

02:42:12.020 --> 02:42:16.500
school machine is a fine way to go. And I think you make a good point with the CRTs. You're going

02:42:16.500 --> 02:42:23.220
to have a hard time. Well, you can probably find secondary CRTs. They're just, they're not as

02:42:23.220 --> 02:42:30.020
plentiful as they once were. No, they are not. As a person that is speaking with an arcade cabinet

02:42:30.020 --> 02:42:36.260
that has a broken CRT right now, it is not easy to find and they're not easy to repair and they're

02:42:36.260 --> 02:42:42.260
not easy to replace. And they're, they weigh a ton. Like it would probably, I seriously am

02:42:42.260 --> 02:42:49.380
considering replacing it with an LCD screen because even though like I get it, like the old

02:42:49.380 --> 02:42:56.260
low-res screens look pretty nice and stuff, but like I think I can live with it not looking as

02:42:56.260 --> 02:42:59.860
perfect as it used to be. I mean, there's so much more you can do with it. And just like,

02:42:59.860 --> 02:43:03.220
especially if you're going to monitor or something, it makes it so much easier.

02:43:05.220 --> 02:43:11.060
I like, I don't know. I like my machine. I like the arcade 1UP machine. I have the burger time

02:43:11.060 --> 02:43:17.940
one. I like it. The display, I like that it's a little brighter and crisper and is it authentic?

02:43:18.740 --> 02:43:22.900
No, but it's authentic enough, you know, for the price I paid for it.

02:43:24.820 --> 02:43:30.340
Yeah. It would be nice if, if it was, they were still making CRTs, it would be nice to be able

02:43:30.340 --> 02:43:36.420
to replace it. But like at this point you have to find somebody that has one and it, that's probably

02:43:36.420 --> 02:43:41.940
going to be at least like 500 plus dollars, maybe a thousand dollars to replace it. And it's still

02:43:41.940 --> 02:43:46.340
going to be used and it's still going to, you may have burn-in and all that stuff. Like mine has

02:43:46.580 --> 02:43:49.860
burn-in on it. You don't really notice it when you're playing it, but like,

02:43:50.420 --> 02:43:55.380
like, I don't know how to fix it. It's broken. And, you know, you're talking about high voltage

02:43:55.380 --> 02:44:02.180
and stuff in there. Like I'm kind of scared to try to fix it. So like, you know, I just rather

02:44:02.180 --> 02:44:06.420
not mess with it. Rather just would have, it would have been nice just to have an LCD in there and

02:44:06.420 --> 02:44:12.900
then, you know, your place it for like quarter of the price. All right. Well, good question.

02:44:13.540 --> 02:44:17.140
Anyhow, before we get to wrapping up the show tonight, do we have any last minute stories,

02:44:17.140 --> 02:44:22.180
Loki? Yeah, we have a few things to talk about. So a lot of this happened a little bit earlier.

02:44:23.140 --> 02:44:33.460
So EA did some fuckery earlier in the week. So they had added ads in a full screen ads in UFC 4

02:44:34.260 --> 02:44:40.580
for the boys. So there was an ad campaign there. They, they also reskinned some of the stuff in the

02:44:40.660 --> 02:44:45.460
actual arena advertising it, but people got really pissed off about it and they eventually took it

02:44:45.460 --> 02:44:50.020
out. This isn't the first time they've done that though. In fact, they also patched it into EA

02:44:50.020 --> 02:44:56.500
sports, UFC three. They've also tested this in the past as well, just to kind of see response,

02:44:56.500 --> 02:45:00.580
but apparently people didn't like it. I think what happened was is they pulled it out for after

02:45:00.580 --> 02:45:05.140
they got done with their ad campaign because the boys has already launched on Amazon. So

02:45:06.100 --> 02:45:12.980
it doesn't make sense to have ads in it anymore for that, but whatever. But it's EA B and EA.

02:45:12.980 --> 02:45:18.740
Speaking of also more things that are just impossible to do. So you may remember we talked

02:45:18.740 --> 02:45:22.900
about control and five Oh five games and how that they're not going to allow you to have a free path

02:45:22.900 --> 02:45:28.580
to upgrade your existing copies of control because they say it's impossible. We just cannot do that

02:45:28.580 --> 02:45:32.900
because the way of the game, the way the game works. So they're basically saying that in order

02:45:32.900 --> 02:45:37.940
to get the Xbox series X or PlayStation five versions, you have to purchase the ultimate

02:45:37.940 --> 02:45:45.700
edition. So here's the funny part though, that you know what's coming. So apparently earlier this

02:45:45.700 --> 02:45:54.580
week folks that owned copies of the original game and also the DLCs or the season pass notes that

02:45:54.580 --> 02:46:01.460
they also had a free upgrade deluxe edition that was available to download for free.

02:46:01.460 --> 02:46:06.820
That was already attached to their account. So they had noticed that, well, Hey, wait a second.

02:46:06.820 --> 02:46:14.020
I already have this as it is. So, so what the heck? And so apparently five of five games had

02:46:14.020 --> 02:46:19.220
accidentally flipped that switch, but then they realized what they did. And so they revoked it and

02:46:20.580 --> 02:46:28.020
retracted all those. Oh dear. So, so apparently no, it is not impossible to allow you to upgrade

02:46:28.020 --> 02:46:34.340
for free. They're just not wanting to do that. They want to charge you again for the game. So

02:46:34.340 --> 02:46:38.500
just be honest and just come out and say it. But of course they haven't made any sort of

02:46:38.500 --> 02:46:47.460
comment about it, but yeah, it's interesting. Interesting. What a mess. Yeah. Anything else?

02:46:48.740 --> 02:46:55.540
Um, that's pretty much it. All right. Well, that brings us to the end of another episode of orange

02:46:55.540 --> 02:46:59.460
lounge radio. Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show tonight, whether you were listening

02:47:13.380 --> 02:47:18.580
Ontario available, all those places. Uh, so, uh, if you liked what you heard here at the show,

02:47:18.580 --> 02:47:22.580
help us spread the word, leave a nice five star review or tell a friend about orange

02:47:22.580 --> 02:47:27.060
lounge radio, because the more voices that we have here in chat, the more gamer voices and

02:47:27.060 --> 02:47:32.180
opinions and all that good stuff we can get out there in the world. Um, you can continue the

02:47:32.180 --> 02:47:37.540
conversation in our discord server. If you like vog network.com slash discord, we'll get you into

02:47:37.540 --> 02:47:41.540
our discord server where, uh, many folks share stories. And sometimes we discuss some of the

02:47:41.540 --> 02:47:46.100
things, uh, throughout the week. I'm sure there'll be a lot of reaction to the Sony conference this

02:47:46.100 --> 02:47:50.580
week. So I'm looking forward to talking about that on the next episode of OLR. Um, I have to

02:47:50.580 --> 02:47:56.340
get some friends together, uh, at vog, uh, this week to talk about it after it happens. And then

02:47:56.340 --> 02:47:59.540
we'll talk about it on OLR as well. So I'm sure there's gonna be a lot of thoughts with the Sony

02:47:59.540 --> 02:48:04.660
conference. Um, so we'll get into that at some point. Um, and yeah, we'll be back in seven days

02:48:04.660 --> 02:48:10.820
to do it again. Um, Oh, and also a shout out for Twitch and, uh, everybody that, um, subbed gave

02:48:10.820 --> 02:48:14.740
bits, uh, all that good stuff tonight. Thank you. Thank you so much for all that. Um, I'll,

02:48:14.740 --> 02:48:19.220
I'll read you guys out after the show here in a minute. Um, but I also want to say those,

02:48:19.220 --> 02:48:24.100
you guys that host us and I'm really bummed Twitch doesn't show us a list of who is hosting

02:48:24.100 --> 02:48:28.420
us. So I can't thank you individually, but, um, just know that I really appreciate it. I know

02:48:28.420 --> 02:48:34.100
some people do. And, uh, those auto hosts on Twitch go a long way in helping to, uh, show

02:48:34.100 --> 02:48:40.500
that we're live to more people. So I really, really appreciate that stuff. So, um, yeah. Uh,

02:48:40.500 --> 02:48:45.460
that is going to do it for another episode of orange lounge radio. Uh, let's get final

02:48:45.460 --> 02:48:50.740
thoughts for tonight. Uh, Loki, you have any final thoughts tonight? Um, I was going to say

02:48:50.740 --> 02:48:56.020
like they have replacement LCD panels that you can get, but they're super expensive if you want them

02:48:56.020 --> 02:49:02.660
like the old CRTs, the four by three ones. Um, so aside from the arcade cabinet stuff, uh,

02:49:02.660 --> 02:49:07.460
still gonna be working on them on games. So maybe I'll play some more stuff this week.

02:49:07.460 --> 02:49:15.780
Not even a hint. No. All right. Um, so are there any games that are on your radar to try to get

02:49:15.780 --> 02:49:22.980
to this week? Um, I'll probably play, I haven't played super Mario sunshine. So when I get the

02:49:22.980 --> 02:49:29.300
3d collection, I'll have to try that out. Um, I don't know. Like I've got a lot of things I

02:49:29.300 --> 02:49:35.380
need to play. I may play more hotshot racing. Um, yeah, I don't know. I need to stream some more.

02:49:38.420 --> 02:49:46.020
All right. Um, and then my final thought for tonight is, um, I'm excited to get all my

02:49:46.020 --> 02:49:52.260
crafting jobs in, uh, final fantasy to 60, which is probably going to happen. If not tonight,

02:49:52.260 --> 02:49:58.100
then I'll probably happen tomorrow. Um, and then, um, I I'm looking forward to playing more of, uh,

02:49:58.100 --> 02:50:03.300
Avicii and some of the other, uh, games out there in my backlog. I have a lot, I still want to go

02:50:03.380 --> 02:50:09.060
back and play more no man's sky. I want to play that fricking. Um, I see VG realness Delvin

02:50:09.060 --> 02:50:13.540
playing this all the time on his channel spell break. So what it's called the, the Fortnite with

02:50:13.540 --> 02:50:22.180
magicians. I've yeah, I watched. Okay. So earlier in the week, I there's, um, I'm sure a lot of you

02:50:22.180 --> 02:50:27.060
are familiar with the oral knots. They do a bunch of like funny, like star Wars videos and stuff

02:50:27.060 --> 02:50:33.300
like that. Um, so they have this character that they do creepy. Oh, that's like a C3 PO,

02:50:33.300 --> 02:50:37.940
but it's pretty funny. Um, so they had their character creepy out playing that game and it

02:50:37.940 --> 02:50:45.300
looked interesting. Um, definitely a game I I'd like maybe to check out, but, uh, their stream

02:50:45.300 --> 02:50:51.140
is pretty funny. I didn't know they actually streamed stuff. So it was pretty cool. All right.

02:50:51.140 --> 02:50:55.700
Well, we're going to, uh, roll credits and be done here for another episode of orange launch radio.
