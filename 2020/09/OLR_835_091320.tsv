0	12800	The masters of getting you to buy the same game multiple times do it again, bringing
12800	16600	the NES Mario Bros. games to the Nintendo Switch with improved graphics, by which they
16600	19880	mean the improved graphics as they had in their first re-release in 1993.
19880	23240	On the 35th anniversary of Mario Bros. we get back an old compilation of games, a new
23240	26760	compilation of less old games, and a brand new Mario Battle Royale, all of which made
26760	29400	for an incredible Mario-centric Nintendo Direct.
29400	32680	These are my plans for the 18th, stay tuned to hear of your host's plans, Rob Roberts,
32680	36120	Jamie Summers, and Loki, recently done and coming soon, starting right now on the show
36120	37120	where every gamer has a voice.
37120	48120	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where
48120	54240	every gamer has a voice, once again it is Orange Lounge Radio, back tonight with episode
54240	59720	number 835 for this September the 13th of 2020.
59720	63960	We are back tonight after being gone last week, thanks to Labor Day Holiday here in
63960	68560	the US and Virtual Dragon Con, which I was fortunate enough to participate with, and
68560	73240	I just want to start off by giving a big thank you to everybody over at Dragon Con and the
73240	77560	Digital Media Track for having me on some panels again, wonderful panels, great set
77560	81000	of panelists, I met a lot of great people and got to work with folks, and if anybody
81000	86120	from that group is here listening tonight, whether live or on the feed, then great, welcome,
86120	87120	hope you enjoy the show.
87120	92700	I am Rob Roberts and joining me in studio, nobody, joining me in studio is a brand new
92700	96880	little stuffed pumpkin spice latte, that's what we have here in studio as a new stuffed
96880	102440	animal for the chair, sadly due to the pandemic in the world we are still doing the distance
102440	107360	recording, so joining me via Discord, say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
107360	113040	Hello, and by the way, the studio now is in the ether, the studio is in our hearts.
113040	119400	Yes, the studio belongs to the people, it's much like the Harry Potter series, it no longer
119400	122240	belongs to one person, it belongs to the people.
122240	128040	Well, except we're not, you know, transphobic assholes.
128040	132000	Alan is yelling from the kitchen, do the people pay rent?
132000	134000	No.
134000	136880	On our own places, yo.
137400	141160	Hey, hey, you know what, you guys are always very kind enough, actually I see this going
141160	145760	on right now, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv
145760	149920	slash vog network, VOG network, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the
149920	155360	Bobby Black Wolf show, and we may not charge rent, but some of you are very gracious with
155360	160760	the bits and the subs, and if I see people, like Pod Culture, I don't usually read these
160760	164880	out at the top of the show, but I will this time, Pod Culture just gave out 5 subs, thank
164880	168600	you so much, Dark Soccer, you just gave out one, Bobby resubbed, I mean, there's, and
168600	172240	Sia Dabiri as well, there's just lots of subs, there's a hype train going on right now, and
172240	176960	so obviously it's no secret, we get a little bit of kickback from that that we can use
176960	181960	to reinvest into the network, because running a business is expensive, yo, so we really
181960	185360	appreciate all that, so it may not be rent, but we appreciate all the subs, especially
185360	190460	with this month being the September themed month over at twitch.tv where there's discounts
190460	192960	and all that good stuff, so yay!
193920	194920	Sweet.
194920	200320	That's right, alright, also sweet, say hello to, also joining us tonight, Techmaster Loki.
200320	201320	Hello.
201320	203320	Hi, how are you?
203320	204320	Doing pretty good.
204320	207000	Yeah, what do you have going on behind you tonight?
207000	208120	That's not your game, is it?
208120	209120	That's a different racing game.
209120	212160	No, it's Hotshot Racing came out this week.
212160	216560	Oh yeah, it's an Xbox Game Pass thing, isn't it?
216560	222720	I think it might be, I have it on PC, but it's on Steam, and I think it's on the Xbox
222720	227920	PlayStation 4 and the Switch, it's kind of a throwback to the AM2 racing games that Sega
227920	228920	put out.
228920	231160	Yeah, yeah, no, I was looking and I was like, is that Virtua Racing?
231160	236500	It doesn't really look like it, but it could be, and I knew you were doing a racing inspired
236500	240040	game at one point, it was one of your projects, and I was like, ooh, he's come a long way
240040	241640	in the past couple.
241640	246440	I wish, I wish I was releasing a game on consoles and stuff, yeah, that'd be awesome.
246440	249120	Alright, well that game looks pretty cool, I'm gonna have to check that out at some point,
249120	251960	I've missed that this week, but that looks fun, that is like something that might be
251960	256840	up Dark Sakura's alley too, because Dark Sakura, like, hello, 90s Sega racing inspired
256840	260920	game, like, that has to speak to a special part of you, doesn't it?
260920	265800	Possibly, but I have Animal Crossing.
265800	268440	There's other business to be tended to.
268440	274720	I borrowed Horizon Zero Dawn from my friend like a year ago, and never played it because
274720	276680	Animal Crossing.
276680	284080	You can't hear the music from it, the music is also on par with those games as well, it's
284080	289000	kind of a throwback to all that stuff, it's pretty difficult too, but pretty fun game.
289000	291680	I'm gonna have to check out that game at some point, and then one other thing I need to
291680	295960	address here at the top of the show, I know we were out last week, but just a couple of
295960	302180	days ago, Loki, it was your birthday, so happy birthday, Loki, thank you, you have a birthday
302180	307220	that's very easy to remember, unfortunately, yeah, unfortunately, oh, but happy birthday
307220	308220	all the same.
308220	310660	Did you do anything special for your day?
310660	314500	I know it's weird with these whole pandemic times and a lot of places being closed, but
314500	316100	were you able to do anything fun?
316100	323340	Yeah, so like, I know like everything is frowned upon going out and doing things, but it depends
323340	324340	what you're doing.
324340	329540	Yeah, it depends, like, well, California, different counties are open in different capacities,
329540	335740	so just up the hill from us, El Dorado County is a little bit more open, so they have their
335740	340640	theaters open, and some of the restaurants are open for dining, so like, we went out
340640	346620	to breakfast and then went and saw Tenet in the theaters, and there was only like seven
346620	349340	people in there, it was really, you know, empty.
349340	352180	I can't imagine a lot of people are going, you know, y'all were wearing your masks the
352180	354060	whole time, I imagine, except when eating popcorn.
354060	357460	Just in the lobby, I mean, obviously in the theater, you don't have to because you're
357460	364200	spaced out so far, but like in the lobby, they require masks, but yeah, it was all right,
364200	368580	except for the theater, you know, had the volume turned way too high for the movie,
368580	373260	so it was like kind of garbled in parts, and it was like, it was like sitting in a rock
373260	377220	concert, like I had a headache by the end of the movie because it was so loud, like
377220	381380	insanely loud, and I've, I watch a lot of action movies in seven theaters, and like,
381380	387220	I know when it's turned up way too loud, so, but it was an okay movie, I liked it.
387220	391300	My dad's birthday is the week before yours, and as you know, he's had a bit of a year,
391300	396220	and I talked about that on prior shows, and he wanted to go out, we did outdoor dining,
396220	401060	but I felt really like we were at a chain restaurant out in Roseville that like their
401060	405460	parking lot is huge, and they had their table spaced all throughout the parking lot, so
405460	408500	it wasn't like, like when I see outdoor dining, sometimes like downtown, it looks like the
408500	411780	tables are all up on each other, and I'm like, I don't know how that's safe, but this was
411780	415900	not that at all, so I felt like, wow, we have a lot of space between us and the next table,
415900	416900	this is, this is alright.
416900	421460	So I have to ask, is it the place that has C and J in the name?
421460	422940	Yes it is, yes it is.
422940	427380	Yeah, I had a feeling, yeah, they've got a pretty massive parking lot, but I'm glad that
427380	432660	there's social distancing, although now with all the smoke out there, the AQI to date highest
432660	433660	was 325.
433660	440000	Yeah, yeah, this was last week before all those fires began, so it wasn't so bad.
440000	442860	Before the evil gender reveal parties kill people.
443860	447660	And I have to say something here at some point before we get into the gaming news because
447660	453300	there's a lot of it, just our hearts going out to people affected by the fires up in
453300	458420	Northern California, I mean that, I can't profess that I know anybody in Butte Creek
458420	462180	or have even been there, but I do know that's just down the road from where I lived for
462180	467120	a few years in Chico, which is a much bigger college town up in that area, and it's way
467120	472200	too close to Paradise that already went through this three years ago, two, three years ago.
472200	476040	I already know a couple of people who are just permanently moving out of Paradise, they
476040	480520	come back after campfire and then we're like, nope, not doing it again.
480520	485800	We have a mutual friend who left for Oregon, and it's even worse there.
485800	490840	Yes, yes, and I was just about to say Oregon is really going through it right now too,
490840	495820	so I thought I saw one person in chat earlier that said they were from the Oregon area,
495820	498620	so just my heart's going out to everybody affected by this.
498620	504440	This is so terrible, and obviously there's a lot of jokes about the gender reveal party
504440	508060	and all that stuff, but these fires are much more than that.
508060	514460	A fire of many fires was caused by that, but certainly the Oregon fire is a result of essentially
514460	521380	climate change and all that, so it's, I really hope we can, as a society, figure out how
521380	523060	to put it into this.
523060	527180	It's really scary, and I know not a lot of people are out here on the West Coast, sometimes
527180	530900	our news really centers on the East Coast, but let me tell you, this is affecting all
530900	531900	of us out here.
531900	537780	I have not left the house but to maybe go to a Starbucks drive-through in four days
537780	540620	because the smoke quality is so bad.
540620	543740	I can't breathe when I go outside.
543740	549500	I actually picked up a respirator for working on my ball-jointed dolls because the stuff
549500	554500	I have to spray them with is pretty toxic, and I ended up busting it out to go out and
554500	559620	check my mail because since I had pneumonia, or if it was COVID, we don't know because
559620	565060	it would test me, my lungs haven't really recovered from it that much, so I would step
565060	570540	outside and come in and have to grab my rescue inhaler, and so we had to today help Dan's
570540	571540	grandmother.
571540	578500	She was giving us some plates and some old dolls and some 50s-era Pyrex, which yes, 50s-era
578500	586220	Pyrex, but I ended up having to wear my respirator to do all that work, and then we had another
586220	590980	errand to run, and by the time I got back in the house, my head was already throbbing.
590980	593900	My skin is looking bad.
593900	599820	Actually, I've developed a rash from the ashes in the air.
599820	605260	For people out there outside of this area, like, oh, it's just some smoke, whatever,
605260	610700	it's pretty nasty, and I even made a terrible, morbid joke, but I think my friends know me
610700	614940	enough to know that I make this kind of joke, is like, now that we play the new game, is
614940	617300	it COVID or smoke inhalation?
617300	618860	It's pretty morbid, but it's accurate.
618860	620780	But it's accurate, exactly.
620780	623740	I went out to do a Pokemon Go raid, bring you into gaming a little bit.
623740	627060	I went out to do a Pokemon Go raid at the park that's right near me.
627060	630800	You guys know what I'm talking about, and that was it.
630800	634020	That was all I could tolerate, and it was just like the smoke.
634020	636500	It looked like Silent Hill out there.
636500	637540	It looked like it was fog.
637540	638540	The smoke was so low.
638540	642280	It looked like Silent Hill out there, and just like when you're breathing in, it just
642280	643280	smells like that.
643280	648020	It's, I mean, a lot of people like the smell of smoke when it's coming from a Yankee candle
648020	650500	or something, or a scented thing.
650500	651500	Or a bonfire.
651500	656220	But when it's like that, it's the choking kind of smoke, it is not pleasant, I'll tell
656220	657220	you that.
657220	658220	So, yeah.
658220	659220	Anyway, sorry.
659220	663320	Don't mean to deviate too much, but it's just, it is affecting our lives.
663320	667480	I've stayed in and played, I have played so much Final Fantasy XIV this weekend because
667480	670440	of this, it's like disgusting.
670440	671440	But it's what I have to do.
671440	675200	Yeah, I saw your thing on the crafting you were doing.
675200	677320	Yeah, I'll talk about that in my gaming week.
677320	678320	Sorry, Jamie.
678320	679760	I'll share this with people.
679760	684440	I actually have several Instagrams, you know, I have that at Dark Sakura, but I also have
684440	690960	one that's called All With No Spaces or Underscores Where Sakura Is At, and that's where I've
690960	697840	been putting pictures of the skies here and of course, you know, my vegetables and roses.
697840	703080	But you know, it's what I made for going out and walking around when I could go out and
703080	704320	walk around.
704320	710280	But lately, like my last few posts have been what the sky looks like in my neighborhood
710280	714080	and around and actually today when I was out in Folsom.
714080	718000	Yeah, and here it's not really that red and orange stuff you were seeing out of San Francisco
718040	721080	or Southern Oregon, like it doesn't look like that here.
721080	722080	It just looks rust.
722080	728960	Honestly, the Silent Hill comparison to me is it like it really does look like Silent
728960	730020	Hill out there.
730020	736280	So one of the pictures that I have is actually a pano and it shows like I was I was at the
736280	741440	Elk Grove Auto Mall because I had to get my my car my oil change done and the pano was
741440	747680	me going from left to right and you can actually see the thickness of the cloud of smoke and
747680	749920	the difference it makes in the color.
749920	750920	Yikes.
750920	753760	So and I'll be happy to really get in the chat room.
753760	760440	But just if you go to at where Sakura is at on Instagram, then I've got some pretty good
760440	762400	pictures to show people.
762400	763400	All right.
763400	766360	Well, let's get into some gaming news, which we've talked a lot here in the opening about
766360	767360	what's going on.
767360	768360	IRL.
768360	771440	We talked about Silent Hill and Pokemon Go.
771440	772440	All right.
772440	774160	Let's get into some gaming news.
774160	778040	Let's start off with probably the biggest news item from last week.
778040	781800	OK, Loki, do you want to do you want to start us off with the big, big item from last week?
781800	784920	Yeah, I mean, there wasn't really any news over the last few weeks.
784920	787400	It has been completely blown up.
787400	794720	So it's a Nintendo finally put out a direct that was targeting the thirty fifth anniversary
794720	796400	of Super Mario Brothers.
796400	801580	So lots of announcements around that, of course, one of the bigger announcements is the Super
801580	808500	Mario 3D All-Stars, which is coming out this week on the 18th, which is a combination of
808500	815820	Super Mario 64, Mario Sunshine and Super Mario Galaxy one Super Mario Galaxy two doesn't
815820	818860	exist in their world, unfortunately.
818860	820220	I don't know why that isn't in there.
820220	822020	That's kind of weird.
822020	823500	Maybe they couldn't fit in the cartridge.
823500	827220	I don't know, but it's not part of the collection.
827220	830200	So that's going to be coming out soon.
830200	836960	We do have, though, the original Super Mario All-Stars out as part of the Super Nintendo
836960	838520	online library.
838520	840240	So you can actually play that now.
840240	841240	So that's available.
841240	842240	Can I announce?
842240	846080	Can I stop there real quick for you to get another news to talk about the 3D All-Stars
846080	848820	and the original All-Stars a little bit?
848820	851960	Anybody here on the panel picking up the 3D All-Stars planning on it?
851960	852960	Sixty dollars?
852960	853960	Yes.
853960	854960	You are getting it.
854960	855960	Yeah, we are too.
855960	856960	Wow.
856960	857960	I'm I'm in the no camp.
857960	858960	I'm not going to get it.
858960	863400	Well, then you can just you have to come over here and play it, then I'm getting it for
863400	864400	my kids.
864400	865400	That's that's it.
865400	866400	All right.
866400	867840	I know who's really into me.
867840	870200	I am my kid.
870200	876080	Both valid reasons for me, like I and it's not even so much the price tag.
876080	881240	Like I understand that sixty dollars for three rock solid games and I consider Sunshine a
881240	882240	great game.
882240	885120	I know that one is divisive for some reason in the community.
885280	890560	My problem with it is, is that I don't think this collection is deserving of the All-Stars
890560	891560	name.
891560	893440	I said it and I believe that.
893440	898480	And if you want to reference what I'm talking about, go back to the original Super Mario
898480	902720	All-Stars and look at what kind of collection that was.
902720	907680	That was something that they really rebuilt from the ground up and put at a level that
907680	913280	was brand new for that system that they were putting it on at the time on the Super Nintendo.
913600	917120	When it came out, though, those were what they had as All-Stars.
918000	918560	No, no, no.
918560	919520	I understand what he's saying.
919520	924560	He seems basically they didn't just re-release like emulated versions of the game.
924560	929120	They rebuilt the games in newer engines and put it out there.
929120	931840	And yeah, this is like hardly anything.
932560	933840	We upscaled it a little bit.
934960	938640	They turned on a feature on Super Mario Sunshine that was honest.
938640	941440	I want to go back and fact check.
941440	942400	Wasn't that there?
942400	943360	The widescreen thing.
943360	944880	Wasn't that there already?
944880	950560	Because I know some games on GameCube like F-Zero GX AX supported the widescreen thing
950560	952720	on HD TVs at the time.
952720	956320	Now, I don't it's been so long since I played Sunshine, and I definitely didn't play it
956320	957600	on HDTV when I did.
957600	963440	So I don't remember if that was a feature, but I feel like 16 by 9 ratio in that era
963440	966400	of gaming was not exactly unheard of.
966400	968960	So it may be that they built it out and just enable it.
968960	969760	I don't know.
969760	971520	But I'm sorry.
971520	979760	I don't find that that great of an addition compared to what these games deserve, which
979760	985280	is the original All-Stars collection is not just a great collection.
985280	991040	It stands on its own as one of the greatest video game releases of all time, period.
991040	995360	And I would have just hoped that something labeled 3D All-Stars would kind of carry on
995360	996400	in that tradition.
996400	1000000	And I know there's a lot of Nintendo fans out there that are going to say, ah, Phooey,
1000000	1001520	you're just a hater, Rob Roberts.
1001520	1006400	And I'm going to let my track record on this show speak is that I'm not a hater all the
1006400	1006960	time.
1006960	1010880	I will root for Nintendo and Sony and Microsoft when they should be rooted for.
1010880	1013200	I will be critical when they need to be criticized.
1013200	1019280	And this is one of those things where I'm like, I'm sorry, this collection feels extremely
1019280	1020560	half-assed to me.
1020560	1025680	And it's just they're going to go through on the strength of the original originality
1025680	1032080	of these titles, many of which they've released before, like Mario 64 has already been released
1032080	1033120	I don't know how many times.
1033120	1034560	And I just feel like, you know what?
1034560	1035760	I have my 3DS.
1035760	1037440	I can play Mario 64 on that.
1038320	1041120	I still have my Wii U for whatever reason.
1041120	1046400	I can still play Galaxy and Galaxy 2 on that because I have those original Wii discs.
1046400	1048320	I just I'm not about it.
1048320	1050640	I just don't want to dig out the N64.
1050640	1051440	And I get it.
1051440	1052080	I get it.
1052080	1054720	And again, I'm not to tell anybody else how to spend their money.
1054720	1055680	And I get it.
1055680	1057200	And I would lie.
1057200	1062000	I would be lying if I didn't say I'm kind of tempted.
1062000	1064240	There's a part, excuse me, I'm sorry.
1064960	1067360	There's a part of me that's a little bit tempted.
1067360	1073760	But then I think what really just kind of was like, oh, fuck it was when I heard that
1073760	1079680	they're doing this artificial, uh, deadline scarcity tactic by turning up.
1079680	1084960	You have to understand they never, they never purposely make their products scarce.
1084960	1090720	It's just that they just can't, they just can't import enough, you know, data to just
1090720	1094160	carry this title for an extended period of time.
1094160	1097440	So they have to remove it arbitrarily in the end of March for no reason.
1098160	1103200	This whole thing with them having the artificial scarcity by turning off the digital day.
1104000	1107920	This makes me go back and really question when into, you know what?
1108320	1113680	Maybe Loki was onto something all these years and all those times Nintendo said, nah, we've
1113680	1116160	we're really trying to put out as much hardware as we can.
1116160	1118720	No, we, we, we, the supply is just outside to me.
1118720	1120160	We're really trying to put out the hardware.
1120160	1122080	I feel like, God damn it, Nintendo.
1122080	1126480	I'd stuck up for you all those times when it came to the hardware and rooting for you.
1126480	1127200	Yeah, exactly.
1127200	1127920	Here we go again.
1127920	1128960	14 years now.
1128960	1134880	So I mean, like we were rooting for you and now it's like, I, I can no longer say, oh,
1134880	1141760	maybe Nintendo's trying because they made it very clear, very clear that they are interested
1141760	1146880	in creating a scarce market to drive up the value of the game and make sure this game
1146880	1152640	sells a lot this holiday season because Nintendo doesn't really have anything else save for
1152640	1155040	a third party title we'll get into later.
1155040	1157920	And I look, I get the COVID screwed everything up.
1157920	1162960	I get that, but that's not a reason for this game to have the artificial scarcity.
1162960	1163920	It's ridiculous.
1163920	1164960	I hate it.
1164960	1166400	I actually hate it.
1166400	1168960	And I'm going to vote with my wallet on this one.
1169520	1172320	Well, and they also said like the physical release of it too.
1172320	1176880	Like, um, some retailers have been saying that it's extremely scarce, the quantities
1176880	1180560	that they're going to be getting like of the physical version of this, because they're
1180560	1182400	trying to drive the price up it.
1182400	1186400	There's no reason why they can't print more of these cartridges.
1186400	1188960	And I'm not, I'm no longer going to defend.
1189760	1191200	I'm going, I'm no longer going to, yeah.
1191200	1194560	I know there's some Nintendo fanboys and stuff out there that get angry when Loki goes
1194560	1195360	on these tangents.
1196000	1202240	Nintendo's action here of making this March scarcity day, I can no longer defend Nintendo
1202240	1203680	when Loki goes on these tangents.
1204240	1205200	Yes, I agree.
1205200	1206960	They're making things artificially scarce.
1207680	1208000	Yes.
1208000	1210960	And to go along with that to even more frustration.
1210960	1213360	So wait, I'm sorry.
1213360	1215680	I know you want to get to the rest of the news, but I need to get chat comments.
1215680	1216000	I'm sorry.
1216000	1219840	Cause I've been ignoring chat and we do tape live every Sunday night at twitch.tv slash
1219840	1221120	vog network.
1221120	1225280	And fifth dream is in our chat room saying Nintendo is the Disney of video games.
1225280	1226160	You know, what's interesting.
1226160	1230480	I've heard that comparison a lot this week and talking about the scarcity, but guess
1230480	1230800	what?
1231360	1234720	Did you know the Disney vault is no more?
1235440	1236800	There is no larger at all.
1237440	1238560	What are you not sure at all?
1238560	1242960	Disney, Disney plus has everything except song of the South, which is a whole nother
1242960	1243280	Oprah.
1243280	1244640	I'm not getting into tonight.
1244640	1246800	No, they're still doing that stuff though with their movies.
1246800	1250320	In fact, they're doing it now with the Fox movies too, that they're putting them in the
1250320	1251280	vault, so to speak.
1252960	1257520	I think it's still around, but yeah, it's less, less prevalent because now of the Disney
1257520	1261040	plus stuff, but that's what they're, they're selling Disney plus is what they're doing.
1261040	1267760	But the physical like DVDs and Blu-rays that stuff is it's still same as always.
1267760	1272880	But, but no, but digital Disney did not make digital scarcity.
1272880	1276720	In fact, everything is out on digital when it comes to Disney plus with the exception
1276720	1283440	of, again, if you want to argue bits and pieces, there are certain problematic movies
1283440	1287360	of the past that have these other separate issues and we're not going to get into that
1287360	1288000	tonight.
1288000	1293600	But the thing is, is that these other animated classics in their library, like Snow White,
1293600	1298960	Cinderella, all this stuff that hasn't been on DVD and Blu-ray in years is now part of
1298960	1300160	the Disney plus library.
1300160	1302560	And they kind of tore that down, I suppose.
1303520	1308560	Um, I was going to say to go into the March, once again, artificial scarcity.
1308560	1313040	So the other thing that they're doing too, Super Mario Brothers 35, which is like Tetris
1313040	1320160	99, but now with Super Mario Brothers, that's also only available until March, 2021 for
1320160	1320800	some reason.
1322240	1323920	I, you know, it's weird.
1323920	1327760	This one I let slide because, and when, when that came up first, cause that was the first
1327760	1328880	thing in the direct, I think.
1328880	1331360	And when that came up first, I was like, all right, whatever.
1331360	1333600	Maybe they just feel like the player base won't be there.
1333600	1337440	Cause you know how sometimes like the player base is all there and then it's like, nobody's
1337440	1338560	playing it online anymore.
1338560	1340160	Everybody went on to the next thing.
1340160	1345360	So maybe they kind of put an end date on it to, um, just kind of have the player base
1345360	1348720	there for a certain amount of time and then go on to the next thing, whatever it may be.
1348720	1355120	And plus, since it is a enhancement for Nintendo online, which we need more of those, um, I'm,
1355120	1357920	I'm oddly okay with it being end dated in that case.
1358480	1363600	I'm surprised that there hasn't been more announcements of games coming to the service
1363600	1368320	because this is about the time everybody's, you know, memberships are running up because
1368320	1370720	of the free memberships that they received with Twitch.
1371600	1373840	Now's the time when that stuff's kind of coming back.
1375280	1377120	What new stuff do you have for me?
1377120	1380800	It's not really, I mean, there's this, but this is only until March.
1380800	1381680	I mean, I don't know.
1381680	1384880	There's not really a lot that they've announced that they have coming.
1385680	1388480	Um, other games that are going to be coming out next year.
1388480	1393920	So super Mario 3d world is getting, uh, re-released and they're also adding new content
1393920	1396000	to that in the form of Bowser's fury.
1396000	1398000	That's going to be coming out February 12th.
1398880	1400320	Um, that's cool.
1400320	1401680	That's a great Mario game.
1401680	1404000	If you missed it on Wii U, you really should pick it up.
1404720	1405920	Yeah, it is really good.
1405920	1410960	Um, they also announced that they're going to be doing a physical gaming watch.
1410960	1416000	That's going to have Mario or super Mario brothers and my brothers to the loss levels.
1416640	1422160	As well as, uh, kind of a modified version of ball in there as well.
1422160	1426800	So that's going to be available, sort of available.
1426800	1432720	I mean, we're talking to Nintendo here, so probably impossible to find on November 13th.
1433360	1434640	This is their version.
1434640	1438240	This is basically what they're doing this year instead of a Nintendo light or what were
1438240	1440640	those things called the mini Nintendo, the mini super Nintendo.
1441200	1444240	Everybody thought, Oh, we're going to get them in mini Nintendo 64.
1444240	1447600	And it's like, Nope, now you're going to get a mini game and watch of sorts.
1448240	1451280	And maybe next year there'll be a Zelda game and watch of sorts.
1451280	1454960	I don't think Nintendo is ready to do the 64 collection just yet for whatever.
1454960	1461600	Well, why, why would they, when they're basically still valuing Mario 64 at 20 bucks in this
1461600	1465120	other collection they're doing, wouldn't it be silly for them to put out the 3d all-stars
1465120	1467120	and a mini 64 in the same year?
1467120	1469440	Cause both are going to have Mario 64 on it.
1469440	1471680	So I just, I feel like we're still a couple of years away.
1471680	1475920	I think game and watch is kind of their idea of if this one does well, they'll probably
1475920	1477120	do a Zelda one next year.
1477920	1483040	Um, they showed off this new toy that's called a Mario Kart live home circuit.
1483040	1489120	So it's actually a physical, uh, like RC car that you control with your switch and it uses
1489120	1494320	AR and a camera that's built into the cars to create tracks and actually drive your car
1494320	1495360	through the house.
1495360	1498720	I don't have a house big enough for that, but, uh, my kids want it.
1498720	1500640	So they're like, we have to get that.
1500640	1504160	I'm like, uh, I don't know if we're going to be able to, uh, but that's going to be
1504160	1509120	coming, uh, looks like on October 16th, no price announced for that.
1509120	1510400	It's 99 99.
1510400	1513600	Somebody leaked, uh, at least it was like a Walmart listing or something went up.
1515600	1517440	Now, um, I will say this.
1517440	1521200	I was very hard on Nintendo earlier, so now I'll give, now I'll give the good news.
1521200	1522240	The fanboys stuff.
1522960	1524560	This looks rad.
1524560	1530560	Like I kind of just don't think I'm going to get it because my house is carpeted.
1530560	1531680	I'm sure it works on carpet.
1531680	1532400	Fine.
1532400	1537440	I just, it would just be me, Alan, I think would walk in and go, that's interesting.
1537440	1538720	And that would be about it.
1538720	1541120	The cat would be terrorized by this thing.
1541120	1544400	So I'm not sure I have a big need for this.
1544400	1546480	I'm excited to watch other people play it.
1546480	1553760	If I was the age of Loki's kids, if I was like nine years old or so, I would be all
1553840	1554720	about this thing.
1554720	1557200	I would want this so fucking bad.
1557200	1558640	It is so cool.
1558640	1563120	Um, but I, I'm not sure I can justify it for me now, but I can still look at it and go,
1563120	1564560	yeah, that looks neat.
1564560	1569040	And isn't that funny that the rumors were Nintendo was working on a new Mario Kart game
1569040	1572640	for the holiday and everybody just assumed it was Mario Kart nine.
1572640	1575040	Oops, oops.
1575600	1576720	But this is cool.
1576720	1577680	You assume.
1577680	1578160	I know.
1579360	1581120	Some other smaller things that they announced.
1581120	1585520	So, uh, they talked about it, some more tie-ins with different things, new animal crossing
1585520	1587360	content with super Mario brothers theme.
1587360	1589600	Furniture's not coming out until March.
1590240	1591440	Um, but it is coming.
1591440	1595840	They're doing some splat fests that are gonna be in January, uh, Mario themed stuff.
1595840	1600320	They're also going to have some actual t-shirts and stuff you can get with the splat fest
1600320	1602000	themes that look kind of cool.
1602000	1604720	Um, they showed some shoes.
1606160	1607200	So, oh my God shoes.
1607200	1611840	Uh, but yeah, I mean, so that, that's pretty much what it was.
1611840	1613040	Guess what, everybody?
1613040	1620320	These shoes are $300 on the Nintendo, on the animal crossing thing.
1620320	1623520	Like obviously I know dark soccer is all about that animal crossing life.
1623520	1625040	I love me some animal crossing too.
1625040	1626640	We all do here at OLR.
1626640	1632240	Um, but you know, let me ask this question because they're, they're remaking, remastering
1632240	1636800	super Mario brothers one, the original light candy it's on the Nintendo online
1636800	1637200	service.
1637200	1639280	They gave it away again in all stars.
1639280	1640480	It's on the game and watch.
1640480	1643760	I mean, everywhere you're looking, there's a super Mario brothers one.
1643760	1651440	So why not just for shits and giggles, put the damn cartridge furniture in animal crossing
1651440	1654640	and let us enjoy the original super Mario brothers in our house.
1655600	1656880	That would be a throwback.
1656880	1657120	Yeah.
1657120	1660160	Or like, how about have that furniture available?
1660160	1664640	If you have a Nintendo online account and then like, say it, I mean, obviously you wouldn't
1664640	1667120	be visiting for the pocket camp stuff.
1667680	1667920	Yeah.
1667920	1671840	So obviously they wouldn't have like, you wouldn't say for whatever reason, you didn't
1671840	1675840	have the online, you could buy the furniture, but maybe you couldn't play it or something
1675840	1676240	like that.
1676240	1678880	You would need to have the online or the play this stuff.
1678880	1681440	But like, yeah, I don't understand why they can't do that.
1681440	1686640	I mean, it makes sense that it would work, but that would get me really excited if, if
1686640	1690800	they did something like that would be a true throwback for animal crossing would be the,
1690800	1692400	you know, NES systems.
1692400	1694480	I'm not, I'm not even asking for everything.
1694480	1694800	Okay.
1694800	1699360	I just, just put the original super Mario brothers in there as a little throwback, which
1699360	1705920	was that even unlockable and it was, it was rare to unlock it, but yes, it was.
1705920	1706160	Okay.
1706160	1709520	Cause I remember Zelda was in there and you actually couldn't get it without like a code
1709520	1710160	or something like that.
1710160	1714400	Like you, it never actually unlocked, but it was in there.
1714400	1716560	And I think there was another game along those lines too.
1716560	1719680	So yeah, Zelda super Mario brothers.
1721600	1722960	I can't remember the other ones are like that.
1722960	1727600	Power 573 says GameCube animal crossing was great with like the 20 NES games built into
1727600	1728320	the game.
1728320	1731920	What do you think was the bait that got me hooked?
1731920	1736400	I wouldn't have, I would have never given animal crossing a second glance back then
1736400	1737680	if it wasn't for that.
1738240	1739520	And I actually remember Loki.
1739520	1744080	That was, that was on you because you had a very nice situation because your work at
1744080	1746880	the time you were the one that got me animal crossing in the GameCube.
1746880	1749520	And I'm thankful for that to this day.
1750160	1753920	But I would have never said dear Santa or dear birthday fairy.
1753920	1758960	This is what I want if they hadn't said 20 NES games in it.
1759600	1766240	You know, Rob, what I played animal crossing on Nintendo 64 when they had them on the thing
1766240	1767440	out in San Francisco.
1767440	1771120	And if I recall correctly, the Nintendo 64 version didn't have the games in it.
1771120	1771840	I don't believe it did.
1772720	1774080	I think it had a reduced number.
1774080	1775280	I think it had like eight of them.
1775280	1776080	Yeah, yeah.
1776080	1776720	But did any.
1777600	1783840	Yeah, it had Clu Clu Land, Balloon Fight, Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr, Pinball, Tennis,
1783840	1786320	and it had the B tier games.
1786880	1790560	And you could get Warriors Woods and Baseball from the island.
1791280	1796800	And then you could also pick up Soccer, Donkey Kong Jr, Donkey Kong Jr 3, Clu Clu Land D
1796800	1797440	and Punch Out.
1798240	1805120	But it also though had in the game, you could do an e-reader for Mario Brothers and Ice
1805120	1805920	Climber.
1805920	1810720	And then for Animal Force Plus, you had a Famitsu giveaway for Super Mario Brothers,
1810720	1812320	and then you could cheat to get the Legend of Zelda.
1813760	1816320	But these were with the e-reader cards.
1816320	1818240	They were like loyalty gifts from Tom Nook.
1819600	1827360	But I mean, I didn't even know that they were in there when I was playing it on demo.
1827680	1831920	In San Francisco, and I fell in love with it because I love this kind of games.
1832720	1836400	So yeah, the moment the US one came out, I had it.
1837040	1838560	You excited for the Mario furniture?
1840560	1845600	It probably, it'll be more stuff to take up space in my storage, so I'll collect it.
1846800	1851120	I mean, basically right now I'm selling off everything in my storage that isn't super
1851120	1854640	expensive because now I can pretty much order anything.
1854640	1856560	I'm working on my catalog right now.
1857200	1859760	But yeah, I mean, I'll have it for the catalog.
1859760	1860800	That'll be fun.
1860800	1864400	Random Animal Crossing tangent, because that happens sometimes on this show.
1864400	1866160	I saw the funniest thing on Twitter this week.
1866160	1871200	It was a screenshot that was clearly done on Harvey's Island, and it had the dog.
1871200	1874880	I think it's Lucky, the one that's wearing a bandage or looks like a money.
1874880	1875920	Yeah, that's Lucky.
1875920	1880240	And he's surrounded by bonfires and campfires, and it just says, this is fine.
1881280	1882000	Yeah, yeah.
1882080	1883120	That cracked me up.
1883840	1888160	Although, um, I posted this a long time ago in my group, which I know you're
1888160	1891840	not doing that thing anymore, but I'm Facebook free two months now.
1892560	1898320	Someone made the ending of Midsommar in Animal Crossing, and I'll have to find it in
1898320	1902240	LinkedIn chat because it's the most hilarious thing I've ever seen, especially, you know,
1902240	1903360	how much I love that movie.
1903360	1903840	I know.
1903840	1906800	Look, I haven't seen it, but I've heard it's been kind of spoiled for me.
1906800	1907840	I've heard about the ending.
1907840	1908320	Okay.
1908320	1908640	Yeah.
1908640	1912560	And it's kind of like, that's kind of like somebody did that in Animal Crossing.
1912560	1913600	That's disturbing.
1914160	1916640	Well, I mean, we have Aika Village is back.
1918240	1918640	All right.
1919200	1919760	Moving on.
1919760	1920000	All right.
1920000	1921840	Anything else in the Mario Direct that we missed?
1921840	1923600	We got too tangenty.
1923600	1928560	Um, no, I think that's pretty much everything that was announced in that direct.
1929200	1929600	All right.
1929600	1930400	Awesome.
1930400	1932080	Uh, let's move into this week.
1932080	1936160	I mean, I guess we didn't talk about Mario Kart Tour, but I don't really talk about Mario
1936160	1936880	Kart Tour.
1936880	1938640	Oh, the cell phone game.
1938640	1942080	I need to try it again now that you can play it in landscape mode.
1942080	1944000	It sounds like about time, right?
1944800	1945280	Yeah.
1945280	1945520	Yeah.
1945520	1947680	So they they're doing an event in there as well.
1947680	1952080	Um, and then there's also something with a Super Mario Maker 2.
1952080	1957760	They're doing an anniversary themed Ninji speed run course in November.
1957760	1959680	Um, that's it.
1959680	1960720	That's everything.
1960720	1965600	I was hoping for my Mario All-Stars skin in Mario Maker 2.
1965600	1967520	Wouldn't that have been the nice way to cap it off?
1969680	1971120	I okay, maybe not.
1972720	1976960	I would have liked to have seen the Mario All-Stars skin in Mario Maker 2, but whatever.
1976960	1978560	All right, moving on.
1978560	1980800	Let's get into what happened this week.
1980800	1987440	So, uh, when we last left our adventures last week before the big break for, uh, Dragon
1987440	1993840	Con slash Labor Day, we were still in a stalemate between Sony and Microsoft as to who is going
1993840	1996880	to unveil the details of their console first.
1996880	2004320	And in kind of a surprise twist, but not quite a surprise twist, uh, leakers beat them both
2004320	2006880	to it and forced Microsoft's hand.
2006880	2007520	Right, Loki?
2008400	2009760	Yes, that's true.
2009760	2015840	So, uh, the first thing that was leaked out was information about this brand new console,
2015840	2020160	the Xbox Series S, which we already know kind of leaked out from those controllers that
2020160	2022800	came out that were mentioning the Xbox Series S.
2022800	2025120	So we knew it was a thing that was going to be announced.
2025120	2033200	It just, you know, when, uh, so it was leaked out that there's video of it and the price
2033200	2034000	point and everything.
2034000	2040000	So it was leaked out that it was supposed to be $299 and it was going to be less, less
2040000	2046240	powerful than the Xbox Series X, but, um, still, you know, going to be a next gen console.
2046880	2053280	So that kind of, uh, forced then, uh, Microsoft in kind of a hilarious fashion to announce,
2053280	2057840	to make that announcement, uh, official, uh, later on.
2057840	2062080	So they finally did come out and say, Oh yes, you know, this is a legit thing.
2062720	2069440	Um, then they also later on the week announced that the Xbox Series X is going to be $499,
2069440	2071600	which is what it was rumored to be as well.
2072160	2074880	Um, so a little bit more details on the Xbox Series X.
2074880	2077360	Um, no disk drive, it's all digital.
2077360	2082720	It's going to be, uh, basically targeting, uh, 1440p on the game.
2082720	2083120	I'm sorry.
2083120	2084080	I have to back up.
2084080	2086080	That's not what I'm under the understanding of.
2086080	2090880	I thought Xbox X has a drive and there's this, I know you're going to get into it, but there's
2090880	2096080	another rumored spec that is the S the S is, Oh shit.
2096080	2096480	I'm sorry.
2097040	2097680	These names.
2097680	2097840	Yes.
2097840	2100240	I know S and X sound very similar.
2100960	2102560	These names aren't great.
2102560	2104160	These names are really not great.
2104160	2104480	I'm sorry.
2104480	2106640	That's like X Ray S like Sierra.
2106640	2106960	Yes.
2106960	2107280	Okay.
2107280	2108480	So sorry.
2108480	2108800	Yes.
2108800	2110080	S has no disk drive.
2110080	2110640	Sorry.
2110640	2111040	Yes.
2111040	2115200	S the one that S for speaker, because it looks like a speaker grill.
2115200	2121760	Um, so the Xbox Series S is going to be targeting 1440p.
2121760	2124960	Um, that's going to upscale to 4k though.
2124960	2128960	Um, but this is more for like folks, like if you don't have a 4k TV and you just want
2129040	2132400	to play the next gen games, um, the graphics are still gonna be better.
2132400	2134640	It's still gonna have, you know, Ray Tracey and everything.
2134640	2136720	It's just not going to be native 4k.
2136720	2140720	It will be up to 120 frames per second though in 1440p.
2140720	2141600	So that's pretty awesome.
2142160	2144720	Well, uh, I'm going to tell you, here's the thing.
2144720	2149280	I would imagine no one here on this panel is interested in Xbox Series S.
2149280	2151680	I'm curious if anyone in chat is interested in this one.
2151680	2155840	And I see this question going around Twitter a lot is who is this console for?
2155840	2157200	Who's going to buy this?
2157200	2159200	Um, I have two answers to this.
2159200	2165920	Number one, um, there's going to be other countries where the cost of, uh, consoles
2165920	2172640	is so expensive that the Xbox Series S is the only one that is like reasonable for people
2172640	2174000	to probably import.
2174000	2177600	And so the fact that it still will play kind of the current generation of games, I think
2177600	2179520	is an important kind of selling factor.
2179520	2180640	So I think you have that.
2180640	2184960	I don't think it's just for, um, people in the U S that's for sure.
2184960	2188720	Um, certainly there's going to be households where it's like, eh, we just want to play
2188720	2189680	Madden.
2189680	2191920	Then maybe a Series S will be for them.
2192480	2196800	And some folks are thinking about, you know, it's like a second console for kids or whatever
2196800	2198000	maybe for them.
2198000	2203360	Um, the other thing I don't think many people are talking about, but I think is a very important
2203360	2203860	point.
2204240	2210080	Didn't Microsoft say last month, they are no longer making the Xbox One as we know it
2210080	2210800	today.
2210800	2216240	They stopped making the Xbox One and that means the Xbox One X, the Xbox One.
2216240	2224400	So the Xbox Series X, God damn these names, the Xbox Series S is for people who want to
2224400	2225920	buy a new Xbox One.
2226480	2229520	And that's not to say that these games aren't going to look good either.
2229520	2233360	Cause 1440 P upscale to 4k is still going to be pretty good.
2233360	2239600	I mean, you're sure it's not native 4k, but a lot of games, like, especially out in this
2239600	2244640	current generation, aren't native 4k anyways, they're upscaled from a lower resolution into
2244640	2245140	4k.
2245760	2249600	So it, I don't think it's necessarily going to be a game, you know, deal breaker for a
2249600	2250160	lot of people.
2250160	2256400	And to be honest, a lot of folks will rather take the $200 savings than, you know, have
2256400	2261280	games look a fraction of the, you know, I guess the, the big difference would be, it's
2261280	2269280	like having a really top of the line and PC running games versus a mid tier gaming PC.
2269600	2271360	Both are still going to be fine.
2271360	2276320	You know, granted one may look marginally better than the other one, but overall it's
2276320	2278000	going to probably play the same.
2278000	2281600	It just, if you really, really, really care about, you know, the quality and everything,
2281600	2283840	then you'll get the more expensive system.
2283840	2288960	And if you don't really care, then you can get the less expensive system and maybe it's,
2288960	2290240	you know, size or something.
2290240	2292080	I mean, that system is much smaller.
2292080	2294960	They're saying it's 60% smaller than the Xbox Series X.
2295520	2298720	You know, processor wise, it is less powerful.
2300880	2301280	I don't know.
2301280	2304800	I mean, I definitely think that there's a home for it with a lot of people.
2305520	2311040	Plus when you consider that you're looking at the PlayStation 5, which it's got their
2311040	2315760	all digital version as well, which is marginally smaller.
2315760	2317280	I mean, it's just looks enormous.
2317840	2319840	But I guess we'll, you know, learn about that later.
2319840	2326560	It, I think they're just trying to be competitive pricing wise, because now, like, say, you
2326560	2331600	know, I mean, we're in the middle of a recession, middle of like COVID, maybe people don't have,
2331600	2333760	you know, that amount of money to drop on a console.
2333760	2337920	$299 is a little bit easier of a sell, especially as part of that.
2337920	2340560	One of the things that they announced is that they're bringing back the program where you
2340560	2342000	can basically finance it.
2342000	2347920	So you have like, I think it's like $25 or $35 a month, plus it throws in Xbox Live Gold,
2347920	2353280	Xbox Game Pass, or I guess it's Xbox Game Pass Ultimate now, which is pretty cool.
2353280	2354720	So it throws all that together.
2355360	2359760	And, you know, that's just a really good deal, all that thrown together.
2359760	2365680	Yeah, that's a really sweet deal, maybe for people that, you know, don't have all the
2365680	2370400	money necessarily right up front, but are still interested in carry on gaming again,
2370400	2375840	like Madden sports games or Halo or, you know, those key Xbox exclusives that they want to
2375840	2378960	play, this deal makes a lot of sense.
2379600	2385120	Not for me, but for other folks that maybe can't just drop, you know, $300 or haven't
2385120	2386000	been saving or whatever.
2386000	2387920	It makes a lot of sense.
2387920	2389360	So a few more things I forgot to mention.
2389360	2391840	Pre-orders start on the 22nd of September.
2391840	2397360	So just a couple of weeks away, the Series X and the Series S are supposed to be out
2397360	2398800	November 10th.
2399440	2403360	And then there's still a rumor out there that there's going to be one more console
2403360	2404880	that's not been announced yet.
2404880	2409440	The rumor is that there's a Xbox Series V that's supposed to be an all digital version
2409440	2413920	of the Series X, same spec wise as the X, but just no disk drive.
2413920	2418640	And that's supposed to be somewhere in between cost from the X and the S.
2419600	2421200	We'll see if that's a thing or not.
2421200	2423840	But right now, let's just consider that this is it.
2423840	2427200	And, you know, we'll wait to see what Sony responds with.
2427200	2430880	Now the chatters, and I apologize, it scrolled, it way scrolled off the screen before I could
2430880	2431440	get to it here.
2431440	2436560	But the chatters were correcting me is that not all of the old Xbox Ones have stopped
2436560	2437200	production.
2437200	2441280	The Xbox One X, the kind of highest end one that did stop production.
2441280	2445360	The one they're still making is the Xbox One S, which I think is kind of the budget
2445360	2449520	Xbox One, which would continue to be like the budget console.
2449520	2455520	But this still, I mean, the Xbox Series S still kind of replaces that Xbox One X kind
2455520	2456720	of in the ecosystem.
2456720	2458960	I still kind of know what I said.
2458960	2463120	But Xbox One S is now, because that's like, what, $1.99?
2463120	2465760	If that, it might be $1.49 at this point.
2465760	2469520	That is the budget Xbox, which is still going to play a lot of stuff.
2470400	2471680	And it will play a thing.
2471680	2474960	A lot of these, at least the first party games are going to be compatible with it.
2474960	2476400	So, yeah.
2477920	2483120	Honestly, the only thing, the only problem I really have with Microsoft is doing is the
2483120	2483520	naming.
2483520	2484960	I think the naming is really bad.
2485920	2489760	Like, look how we're confusing S and X, and they're too close.
2489760	2493040	It just also sounds alike, and that's kind of confusing.
2493040	2500160	It's not good, but the consoles themselves, I think I will probably, as of today, as of
2500160	2504560	this moment, I am probably going to get an Xbox Series X on launch day.
2505760	2510400	I can't say the same about PlayStation 5 today.
2510400	2513680	Now, obviously, and we'll get to it later in the show, you guys watching live, see it
2513680	2514640	on the sidebar.
2514640	2517440	A lot could change this week with the PlayStation 5 showcase.
2517440	2518320	We'll see.
2518320	2522160	Something else about my situation that is very important that I think a lot of people
2522160	2524320	are going to be kind of like, this could sway people.
2524320	2527520	Either way, I have a PlayStation 4 Pro.
2528240	2529840	I have an Xbox One.
2531520	2532080	That's it.
2532080	2532560	Period.
2532560	2536240	Xbox One before they started out with all the numbers and the series, all that other
2536240	2536800	stuff.
2536800	2540160	So my point is, my Xbox One is kind of gaming technology.
2540160	2541440	It's a few years behind.
2541440	2544880	My PlayStation 4 Pro is not lagging behind so much.
2544880	2548800	Something else that is really kind of wooing me on the Microsoft side is that Microsoft
2548800	2553840	really kind of made that commitment to the whole library is going to move up and get
2553840	2559600	upscaled and be new and have a fresh coat of paint, basically, on the Xbox Series X.
2559600	2563680	And Game Pass is a pretty sweet deal.
2563680	2566000	I'm a fan, I got to say.
2566080	2572560	So all of that stuff combined is kind of putting me in Xbox Microsoft's camp today.
2572560	2577040	Again, a lot could change this week with the Sony event, and I might have to break the
2577040	2582640	bank and somehow be able to afford two consoles, or maybe I'll change my mind and get the
2582640	2583840	PlayStation first.
2583840	2588640	But as of today, in two weeks, I plan to preorder the Xbox Series X.
2590480	2590960	So we'll see.
2593200	2593760	Yeah, same.
2593760	2598720	Just because I haven't really been I mean, right now, I'm not aware of what they're
2598720	2600880	launching with over there, but like.
2602640	2607120	I don't know, just seeing how they've handled this generation with as far as like cross
2607120	2612640	play, mod support, all that stuff, I'm definitely leaning more towards Microsoft.
2612640	2617840	It is unfortunate, you know, I have a large library of games there, like a huge library
2617840	2618480	of games there.
2618480	2625200	But I still have a PlayStation 4 Pro, so I could still play all that stuff.
2626560	2631360	I'd be curious to see what they do with PlayStation VR a little bit more once we have some more
2631360	2634640	announcements there, what that's going to do for how the games are going to look on
2634640	2635140	that.
2636000	2638960	I'm more interested in that, but that's something that could be later on.
2638960	2642000	You know, I don't have to jump in on that day one.
2642000	2645600	It's going to be interesting to see what happens this holiday, because there's a large
2645600	2649040	segment of gamers out there and that game.
2649040	2650080	And it's interesting.
2650080	2651040	I'm just a lot.
2651040	2655680	I'm not saying I see us all the time, but a lot of times the Nintendo fanboy kind of
2655680	2656960	overlaps with this group.
2656960	2659280	And that's the group that says, I don't like Microsoft.
2659280	2660320	I don't like Xbox.
2660320	2661600	I don't like what they're doing.
2661600	2663520	And you kind of go, why?
2663520	2666720	And it's, well, I don't like first person shooter.
2666720	2669120	That's the Halo and the Madden and that stuff.
2669680	2674800	And my comment to all of that is it is a different Microsoft now.
2674800	2676000	It is 2020.
2676800	2678400	Wake up, Nintendo fanboy.
2678400	2678900	Wake up.
2680000	2683840	And everybody out there, like if you're one of those people that's like, I don't, I just
2683840	2685040	don't like Microsoft.
2685040	2685540	Wake up.
2686720	2688880	Don Mattrick is not running that company anymore.
2688880	2692080	They have come a long way since Phil Spencer's been at the helm.
2692080	2695920	Do you know how many indie games are on Game Pass now?
2695920	2701200	And like what a good reception things like Tell Me Why are getting, which I think a lot
2701200	2704640	of people are writing off and like forgetting that something like that exists.
2704640	2706160	In the Microsoft universe.
2706800	2712480	So I just, I think if you're one of those people that's, I just don't like Microsoft.
2712480	2717520	I, you may have your valid reasons, but I want to challenge a little bit.
2717520	2721600	Have you evaluated that stance in the year 2020?
2721600	2723840	If you have, and you're still kind of not in their camp.
2723840	2724480	Okay, fine.
2724480	2730880	You tried, but if you haven't evaluated them in several years, I really think you should
2730880	2732000	take another look.
2732000	2733680	And that's, that's my opinion.
2735440	2736960	There's just not enough out on it.
2736960	2739120	Then it makes me want to justify the cost of it yet.
2739120	2742160	There's nothing that has really spoken to me that much.
2742720	2748320	I, and I, I do understand there's a lot of overlap with Microsoft and Sony, and I understand
2748320	2754000	that it's kind of like, if you have PlayStation five, then Microsoft really has to, and they,
2754000	2759920	they have been lagging behind in the first party studio, but I kind of feel like we're
2759920	2761920	going to see it this generation.
2762800	2768080	We're going to really see Microsoft push to be at that same level that Sony's out with
2768080	2769040	their first parties.
2770880	2771360	But we'll see.
2772880	2773920	I'll, I'll be honest.
2773920	2781280	I mean, even for PS five, all the stuff that I really want to play is on switch right now.
2781840	2786480	I'm kind of like not excited about any of the stuff coming out on any of them.
2787440	2794480	I mean, this is one of the first launches that I'm not remotely excited about anything
2794480	2795760	really coming out on them.
2795760	2804880	I mean, maybe resident evil village might be worthwhile, but yeah, there's just like
2804880	2808480	not a whole bunch on here that really, really grabs me.
2808480	2809600	I kind of don't care.
2810480	2815600	I, I, I mean, like I said, it's one of the first ones where I really don't care.
2817120	2823600	Not every console has had a bang up launch lineup and sometimes consoles don't really
2823600	2827360	mature into their life cycle for a year or two.
2827360	2831840	I didn't get a PlayStation three until little big planet was finally out.
2831840	2832960	You know, this was it.
2833520	2834960	You know, that was kind of the game.
2834960	2835280	Got it.
2835840	2836240	Yeah.
2836240	2839040	You know, then yeah, second sign me up.
2839040	2840480	I love all the Tekken games.
2840480	2842960	I do think Sony's going to draw.
2843200	2848800	I think where there's all this rumble, I think there's something to these silent Hill rumors.
2848800	2853280	And I think that is going to be the thing that makes the PlayStation five highly desirable,
2853280	2855040	but will it be a launch title?
2855040	2855760	I don't think so.
2855760	2858080	I think it's going to be a holiday 2021 thing.
2858080	2863760	And I think COVID and that whole situation, especially has kind of put the urgency on
2863760	2867680	adopting these new consoles right away on the back burner a little bit.
2868240	2872880	But the reason why I still kind of gravitate towards series X in light of me, just saying
2873040	2879920	all that is that Microsoft in the way that I haven't seen Sony do has made a commitment
2879920	2885040	to, Hey, not only is this console going to play all the new stuff, but day one, we're
2885040	2890560	going to play these optimized and new versions and new coats of paint and upscaled and, and
2891120	2894240	making all your old games look great again.
2894240	2897200	And that's kind of why I'm a little bit of Microsoft's camp right now.
2898000	2902240	Cause it kind of adds something sweet to that launch that otherwise is missing.
2902960	2907840	So I'll be honest, I'm probably going to still stick with, um, a PlayStation.
2907840	2909520	It's not because of any Microsoft hate.
2910080	2916720	It's just that, I mean, to be honest, the last couple of, actually all the last systems
2916720	2921360	have had more games that I've wanted to play and I don't see any sign of that really changing.
2922800	2926320	So it's, it's not the biggest of priorities to me.
2926320	2930400	I'm, I'm, I'm probably going to stick with PlayStation.
2930400	2931200	All right.
2931200	2931840	And that's fine.
2932160	2935520	But you know, and you've seen these, these gamers on social media and everything too,
2935520	2941200	where it's like, I don't like Xbox and it's like, I don't, I don't like Apple because
2942880	2945520	I don't like this one because I'm like.
2946560	2949440	Everybody who's a hater, shut up and let people enjoy things.
2950000	2951040	And we can agree on that.
2951600	2951920	All right.
2952960	2953600	All right.
2953600	2955200	Anything else on the, on the Microsoft stuff?
2955440	2963040	Um, no, that's pretty much it as far as, um, announcements for, um, Microsoft right now.
2963040	2965520	So we'll have to wait and see if there's yet another system out there.
2965520	2970000	Um, I did think it was kind of funny though, that one of the things that was shown on social
2970000	2976640	media this week, uh, about the Xbox series S is that in the video where they were talking
2976640	2983440	about the Xbox, um, series X back in June, there was actually an Xbox series S sitting
2983440	2988640	on the shelf, um, in the back behind, uh, Phil Spencer or whatever.
2988640	2994960	But, oh yeah, we never saw it because it looked like another book.
2994960	2999040	Like it's, it's a funny little teehee headline now at this point, but honestly,
2999040	3000640	how was anybody going to catch that?
3000640	3002640	It looked like a white book.
3002640	3005440	So it wasn't like the speaker side was facing out or anything.
3005440	3008000	It just looked like another book sitting on a shelf, whatever.
3009280	3010480	It's so funny though.
3010480	3011120	It's cute.
3011120	3011760	It's cute.
3011760	3012000	Yeah.
3012560	3013200	All right.
3013200	3016240	Let's talk a little bit about the now and our gaming weeks.
3016240	3017600	So we've had a little bit of time off.
3017600	3019680	How was our gaming week or weeks?
3020240	3023200	If we will, I'm going to just step away for a minute to get more water.
3023200	3024480	Cause I'm, I'm getting thirsty.
3024480	3028080	So dark soccer and then Loki, how was your gaming weeks?
3029120	3032160	Well, I really just played a lot of animal crossing.
3032160	3038880	Um, I mean, it's been a pretty busy week cause I am, I've got a promotion at work.
3038880	3041040	I'm starting my new position tomorrow.
3041040	3044560	So I've had other things on my mind and, you know, family issues,
3044560	3047760	but animal crossing has always been like my go-to comfort game.
3048320	3051360	And it's really been necessary as of late.
3051360	3055440	Um, I, since I finished my other word game, I'm now playing word scapes.
3056240	3059120	And, um, like they do this like dumb little tournament thing,
3059120	3060640	like once a week or something.
3060640	3066560	And I invariably finish in like between five to 10th place when I do it.
3066560	3068160	So it's a fun little game.
3069120	3073120	And for me, I like actually testing the vocabulary on these games
3073120	3075600	and seeing if they actually recognize legitimate words.
3078080	3082480	So I'm also trying to ease myself back into words with friends too.
3083200	3085520	Playing with a few people and thank you.
3085520	3087920	Thank you, Bobby, for the congratulations.
3088800	3090000	It comes with a raise.
3090000	3091040	That's makes me happy.
3091760	3101040	Um, but, um, we also, um, are, uh, we traded off AC DC temporarily for another game,
3101040	3103280	but I forgot which one it was.
3103280	3104080	I'll be honest.
3104080	3111040	So we've been playing some, uh, some pinball in the house and, um, we've got the, uh,
3111040	3112080	the Saturn hooked up.
3112080	3116560	So there's been some elevator action returns, uh, gaming going on.
3117120	3121200	And, uh, some of that, uh, outrun for, for switch that's come out.
3121200	3126160	And I, I think I played a couple of NES games on the platform on the switch.
3126800	3129600	So it's been, it's been pretty okay.
3129600	3132400	And thanks everybody again for the congratulations.
3132400	3133440	I appreciate it.
3133440	3140960	Um, but at any rate, um, uh, I, I'm still like, I don't know what it is, but I'm still
3140960	3146400	so antsy to have an update for pattern that I basically am checking my Apple arcade
3146400	3149920	every day, give me a new game, give me a new game, you know, update my game.
3149920	3155840	So, um, yeah, that's it for me.
3156480	3157120	All right.
3157120	3162000	Um, so this week I was mainly, uh, just working on game building stuff.
3162000	3164080	So I haven't played a lot of games.
3164080	3169280	Um, I did of course play some Orna just to, you know, do that, have to do my daily wars
3169280	3170160	and whatnot.
3170160	3171600	Um, so I played a little bit of that.
3172160	3177840	I played, um, hot shot racing, which is kind of in my background right now.
3177840	3180720	Um, so pretty fun racing game.
3180720	3183840	I've been kind of following the development of that for a while now.
3183840	3190400	Um, it's definitely a throwback to the old Sega racing games and both, you know, in graphics
3190400	3194880	sound, there's even some tracks that are kind of similar to the old games as well.
3194880	3199200	Um, so definitely lots of throwback to that and like kind of Ridge racer stuff.
3199200	3200880	So, uh, very cool.
3200880	3203280	Um, been playing quite a bit of that.
3203840	3210800	Uh, I've been having to play some of, uh, super or not super Mario Paper Mario and the
3210800	3211760	Origami King.
3211760	3214800	Cause my son wants me to fight the bosses for him.
3214800	3218000	So I've been having to play some of that and help them out with that.
3218560	3220800	So I still haven't gotten to play my save in a while.
3220800	3222240	I'm still way behind him now.
3222880	3224880	Um, what else?
3225840	3231680	Uh, very little of Minecraft, although I probably want to get back into that, uh, as well at
3231680	3237520	some point and maybe do some streaming of that mainly game development stuff that unfortunately
3237520	3239120	I can't share with you right now.
3239760	3245280	I really, really want to, but I can't hurry the fuck up and finish a game so we can, we
3245280	3246720	can hype it here on the show.
3246720	3249200	Oh, yeah, that's right.
3250080	3251440	There's still the pizza competition.
3252080	3257120	I I've shown, I've shown one of our listeners, what I'm working on only because I ha it was
3257120	3258640	like, it was bothering me so much.
3258640	3260160	Like I was going to put it out on Twitter.
3260160	3261120	I didn't want to do that.
3261120	3265920	Who I'm not saying speak up, who is it?
3265920	3267920	No privately, right?
3268400	3270000	Uh, privately except I've shown them.
3270000	3276480	So, uh, but it's, it's going to be hilarious.
3276480	3278800	It you're, you're going to love it once it's done.
3278800	3279840	It's, it's very cool.
3280480	3286080	So, uh, coming soon, hopefully in the next few weeks, I'm really rushing to get it done.
3286080	3286560	Oh, I'm sure.
3286560	3292480	I'm sure that'll bring great things for the project, but don't rush a project.
3292480	3294160	Make it, make it perfect.
3294160	3295520	The first time, right, right, right.
3295520	3298160	No, I'm just saying like, I've been working on it a lot.
3298160	3303600	I'm not jump, not just been like kinda, you know, an hour here, wait a couple of weeks,
3303600	3306400	hour again, I've been working on it every single day.
3306400	3309120	So, um, it's getting there.
3310160	3315280	No, not like rushing it, like as in bad quality, I'm rushing as in, I want to keep working
3315280	3318480	on it to get progress done with it, you know, so that it's, it's done.
3318480	3322000	But, uh, you know, I've been working on gameplay stuff for it.
3322000	3327360	Um, you'll, you'll understand once I, once I'm done with it, it's completely different
3327360	3329280	than what I've been working on already.
3329280	3330400	And it's not in unity.
3330400	3336400	Well, somebody knows somebody, somebody does know the person that should know knows.
3336400	3337760	So that's all I can say.
3337760	3338480	Okay.
3338560	3340880	Oh, I have an idea what it might be.
3340880	3341440	All right.
3341440	3346400	Bobby black open chat says, don't rush the project, but rush telling me what it is.
3346400	3348320	I just want the listener to know.
3348320	3350000	And now I think I know who it is.
3350000	3355280	I think you just gave a clue there, but, uh, I just want that listener to know, you know,
3355280	3357520	something that Jamie and I don't know.
3358080	3359200	And that's not okay.
3362560	3365120	So that'd be cool.
3365120	3366480	I can't wait to share it for you.
3366480	3366880	All right.
3366880	3367600	No, we're excited.
3367600	3368240	We really are.
3369200	3369840	Uh, okay.
3369840	3370560	Mike, give me a week.
3370560	3373520	Um, I've been playing the, the location based games.
3373520	3378560	Of course, Ingress, Pogo, Orna, not as much though, honestly, with the, with the heat
3378560	3383840	wave, I was doing so good on my walk-in for a while and with the heat wave and the smoke
3383840	3386000	and everything, like I just, I haven't really been outside much.
3386000	3386800	So that was that.
3386800	3388160	But I did, I tried to play a little bit.
3389040	3394240	I fell down a rabbit hole in these past few days of crafting and final fantasy 14.
3394240	3398000	I talk about that game a lot on this show because I do play it just about every night,
3398000	3399040	every other night.
3399040	3403840	Um, I'll get on and run a dungeon or two, usually with Shane, sometimes maybe some other
3403840	3406000	people as well, just depending on who's around.
3406000	3409600	Uh, and that's kind of been a thing, but I don't know what happened.
3409600	3413680	Maybe it's because in this most recent patch, they did a minor update to what they call
3413680	3418720	the Ishgard restoration in the game, which is a different way that you can level crafting
3418720	3419680	and kind of contribute.
3419680	3424560	Basically, it's like, it's kind of like a throwback to the on-carriage thing in World
3424560	3430720	of Warcraft where everybody contributes projects that they're crafting to this project of hopefully
3430720	3433840	creating a housing district in Ishgard at some point.
3433840	3440000	But, uh, I, I have fallen and by falling off the deep end, I mean, I now have spreadsheets
3440000	3446560	that I've created that I posted on Twitter, uh, uh, that, uh, track my gathering in the
3446560	3450640	diadem and how many of everything that's the zone where you do all the crafting or do all
3450640	3451280	the gathering.
3451280	3456560	So it's like, it tracks and like, how many, uh, culinary, uh, turn-ins can I make based
3456560	3459920	off these mats that I pulled from the diadem earlier today?
3459920	3462000	So I have a fucking spreadsheet and everything.
3462000	3464080	It's pretty nerdy, but also awesome.
3464080	3466400	So that's been my life in Final Fantasy XIV.
3466960	3468960	Um, I know, right?
3470960	3471280	Right.
3472640	3477840	I use an app, Animal Crossing, actually that app and Animal Crossing.
3477840	3480640	Now there's like a thing on Twitter.
3480640	3482400	You send the thing on Twitter.
3482400	3483120	It's like a bot.
3483120	3488720	You send it a short video of you scrolling through your catalog and it will send you
3488720	3492880	a file that you can import into the app to automatically X off everything in your catalog.
3492880	3493520	It's pretty rad.
3494160	3496800	So I've just been using Nook Exchange.
3496800	3503040	So, um, and because now I've got friends and I who are doing like different, uh, like you
3503040	3505360	remember Gwen from our Final Fantasy free company.
3505360	3505600	Yeah.
3505600	3506640	A long time ago.
3506640	3506880	Wow.
3506880	3507440	Yeah.
3507440	3512720	Um, we've got, we, we do exchanges and our friend, Melly, we do exchanges.
3512720	3518560	And, um, my friend, uh, Chris, who is, uh, sister, Jared, Harry, Ariola.
3519360	3523840	Um, one of my, my sister, um, we've been doing it and a few other people.
3523840	3527200	It's actually been, uh, uh, Chris, Megzi, we've been doing them.
3527200	3528240	It's been pretty cool.
3528240	3529040	Nice.
3529040	3534160	Um, VidPower573 in chat says, spreadsheets, Eve Online players say hi.
3534160	3534480	Yeah.
3534480	3535680	Yeah, no, I, I get it.
3535680	3536480	I get it.
3536480	3536800	All right.
3536800	3542480	Um, other games in my gaming week, I, I played a lot of Super Mario All-Stars thanks to the,
3542480	3546880	uh, kind of surprise release on Nintendo switch, because again, it really, and I meant to what
3546880	3550480	I said earlier, it's really just one of the all-time great game releases.
3550480	3554480	And I love playing the original Mario brothers and especially Super Mario brothers two.
3554480	3558400	And I wanted to see if I still had it, if I could still beat Super Mario brothers two.
3558400	3563760	And the answer is no, or I gave, I got frustrated and turned it off.
3563760	3567920	Cause I lost all my lives before I had the chance to beat it, but I'll try again this
3567920	3568160	week.
3568160	3569200	I'm just a little rusty.
3569760	3575600	Um, some new things for me that I played this week, I played a game from hello games.
3575600	3579440	The folks behind no man's sky, they published a game in the past couple of weeks called
3579440	3581040	the last campfire.
3581040	3582400	And I checked that game out.
3582400	3585920	Um, it honestly has nothing to do with no man's sky.
3585920	3590720	I think, uh, hello games is just publishing something on behalf of a smaller indie studio
3590720	3592880	that is doing something completely different.
3592880	3597920	Uh, this game reminds me a little bit more of maybe like say a nineties PC puzzler type
3597920	3603680	thing where basically you go into these different, they're kind of like spirits, but you go into
3603680	3608000	these different little worlds and try to solve a puzzle to like free the spirit.
3608000	3610640	And the whole thing is narrated as you played.
3611200	3614480	And I could, I'm like, I know I've seen this trick in a game before.
3614480	3616880	I know I've, it was Bastion that did that.
3616880	3621680	Say you remember that game Bastion where you're playing the game, except instead of a deep
3621680	3624480	manly voice narrating the game, like you did in Bastion.
3624480	3624640	Right.
3624640	3631120	You remember that it's instead, it's, it's more of a whimsical female voice that guides
3631120	3633440	you through the last campfire.
3633440	3638560	It's that's, that's basically, uh, the narrator in that game, but it's kind of that same twist
3638560	3640480	where it's being narrated as you're playing.
3641040	3644640	Um, act depth and chat says the one that looks like journey.
3644640	3648960	It kinda has a similar art style, but the games don't really play anything alike.
3648960	3654720	Uh, the game is more of like a, uh, like a platformer, but a puzzler platformer.
3654720	3658400	Maybe, maybe like captain toad, but that's really stretching it.
3658400	3662960	I feel like I've played some nineties PC puzzler games though, that are a lot like this.
3662960	3665920	Um, so it was, yeah, I've, I've been enjoying that game.
3665920	3672880	Um, then the other game that I've been playing, I did not expect to like this game and I think
3672880	3678000	it is really good, but this week, uh, the ultimate edition or whatever you want to call
3678000	3681520	it of Avicii in vector came out.
3681520	3682240	Oh yeah.
3682240	3682800	Yeah.
3682800	3687760	Avicii being the musical artist that passed away, um, a few years ago.
3687760	3693120	Um, but I think at the time he was working with this company to create a music game based
3693120	3695280	on his library of music.
3695280	3698320	And that game is called in vector or Avicii in vector.
3698320	3701680	And I guess it's been out on PlayStation four and Xbox for a little bit.
3701680	3705680	I kind of missed it, but then a switch version just came out.
3705680	3712960	And with that came a parody Xbox and PlayStation versions that basically add like 10 new tracks.
3712960	3717200	It's like some DLC from his last album, Tim.
3717200	3720720	And I think there was another album in there as well that it adds some tracks from.
3720720	3725520	It is all his music, which kind of surprised me how diverse it is.
3725520	3729360	I mean, of course, of course, I know some Avicii songs, like everybody's heard that,
3729360	3733520	you know, wait me up when I get, you know, I don't want to, I want to get us muted either
3733520	3735360	by my bad singing or from copyright.
3735360	3736640	But everybody knows that song.
3736640	3739360	Um, but he has a pretty rich library of other songs.
3739360	3743520	And, uh, it is that type of music that you would expect to hear in music games.
3743520	3746080	And as a music game, it's pretty fun.
3746080	3751120	Like it's, um, it's got a very similar, but not same approach to amplitude.
3751120	3752320	It's not multiple tracks.
3752320	3754800	It's just one track, but you're kind of going down this wire.
3754800	3760720	And instead of moving left or right, you're rotating around the tube left or right to
3760720	3762480	hit different things in there.
3762480	3765120	Sounds almost like that spin rhythm game that they have.
3765200	3769360	Maybe a little, but then at certain parts, your ship kind of takes off.
3769360	3772720	Like when there's an instrumental break, your ship might take off.
3772720	3778320	And then you're flying your ship through these holes, like a star Fox type game, basically.
3778320	3780160	So it's like amplitude meets star Fox.
3780160	3781040	I'm serious.
3781040	3785440	And then you actually are flying through the circles in rhythm with the music as well.
3786000	3789360	And so I thought that was kind of neat and I have to be on, I'm going to be completely
3789360	3790240	blunt.
3790240	3794640	This game is what I was hoping amplitude on PlayStation four was going to be.
3794720	3795200	It's better.
3795760	3796560	It really is.
3796560	3803920	And I was surprised because usually you kind of go, Oh, it's a music game dedicated to
3803920	3804960	one artist.
3804960	3806960	It's probably a cash in.
3806960	3809360	It probably isn't going to be that well thought out.
3809360	3810720	I was totally wrong.
3810720	3812640	It's, it's a well done music game.
3812640	3819040	My only maybe like minor criticism is that it can be really hard to see which I'm playing
3819040	3823600	on the PlayStation version and it can be really hard to see like what button you got to press
3823600	3826240	because the way the arrows are kind of shaped is a little funky.
3826240	3828160	I wish you could kind of change that.
3828160	3832080	And especially when you're traveling through the wire, it does these really cool visual
3832080	3835760	effects where you're kind of going uphill, downhill, uphill, kind of like, um, what's
3835760	3836560	that other music game?
3836560	3837200	Thumper.
3837200	3838720	Thumper does that too, right?
3838720	3842800	But it can be hard to see what's coming up if you're going uphill and downhill.
3843440	3847120	And so, I mean, I guess that's part of the game design and part of the challenge.
3847120	3851520	I wish you could kind of chill that out just a little bit, but that is my minor criticism
3851520	3854320	on what's otherwise a really fun music game in my opinion.
3854320	3858320	So, uh, VidPower573 in chat says, I've played Avicii and Vector.
3858320	3859840	I really, really liked the music.
3859840	3860080	Yeah.
3860080	3863680	I was, you know, being a music game fan, I, I wanted to check it out and I was really
3863680	3864720	surprised how much I liked it.
3864720	3867760	Again, I was expecting it like a cheap title.
3867760	3872480	You know, I guess though, um, like SingStar Queen and SingStar Abba, those were based
3872480	3874800	on one musician and they turned out pretty good.
3874800	3876400	So there's that.
3876400	3879360	Um, ActDef says, I really want to try that game.
3879360	3880160	Well, good news.
3880160	3881360	There's a demo out.
3881360	3885680	I know the Switch has a demo and I can't imagine it's not on PlayStation and Xbox as
3885680	3886080	well.
3886080	3889040	And it has two tracks in it that you can just check out.
3889040	3890560	So there you go.
3890560	3891120	Go for it.
3891840	3893360	So, all right.
3893360	3897360	Um, that was Avicii and Vector and that's it for my gaming week.
3897360	3899120	So lots of games.
3899120	3901760	Let's get into, um, some other gaming news then.
3901760	3904320	We've been talking a lot here at the top of the show, but we have some other news we want
3904320	3904880	to get into.
3904880	3906640	So we will start off with Loki.
3907920	3908320	Yes.
3908320	3912160	So as we've been hinting at, there's the PlayStation showcase.
3912160	3914560	It's just going to be on September 16th.
3914560	3918640	That's supposed to, they better goddamn unveil the price at this point.
3918640	3926000	Uh, it's supposed to unveil the price of the PlayStation 5 and, um, you know, what's going
3926000	3929040	to be, I guess when it's coming out and that type of stuff.
3929040	3932240	So, um, supposed to be 40 minutes long.
3932240	3936640	It's going to air at, uh, 1 PM Pacific time, September 16th.
3937360	3942880	And yeah, so I guess we'll have to wait and see what they have to announce there.
3942880	3949520	Um, I know that as we've been kind of frustrated this week with the whole kind of plain chicken
3949520	3954400	with announcing pricing and stuff like that, and I'm sure that leaks didn't help with that.
3954400	3959680	I'm curious to see what they respond with if they're going to try to price themselves
3959680	3960560	lower.
3960560	3965760	Um, the rumor is that they might not be lower than $4.99 because they're charging a premium
3965760	3966320	on their system.
3967120	3973120	Um, I just hope for their sake, it's not $599 because all the means will come back, but
3973120	3974240	uh, we'll see.
3974240	3979520	I mean, I'm curious, like, I don't know, like I've been kind of, you know, pro PlayStation
3979520	3984160	last generation just with, you know, the con that was the only console I has visited for.
3984160	3990960	Um, and even like this coming up generation, like I have a nicer laptop that could run
3990960	3993680	probably a lot of those games in decent settings.
3994240	3996400	But I don't know.
3996400	3998720	I still kind of want an Xbox series X.
3998720	4002640	Um, I am curious to see though what exclusives each are going to have.
4002640	4008480	Um, I know obviously launch is going to be kind of all over the place, but, um, I don't
4008480	4008980	know.
4010160	4013200	Yeah, I, I'm, I'm very curious to see what they announced.
4013200	4018480	Like obviously I said before, I'm leaning towards Xbox series X, but I'm well aware.
4018480	4020320	I know more about that console right now.
4020320	4023120	There could still be some surprises in for PlayStation five.
4023120	4027600	If Sony announces we got silent Hill and it's out this year, like that is going to
4027600	4031600	be a very hard thing for me to resist a very, very hard thing for me to resist.
4031600	4033680	So I might end up kind of tilting.
4033680	4036560	Um, so there's still some things that could, it could make you want to get a PlayStation
4036560	4037920	five this year for sure.
4037920	4040480	So I'm really excited to see what they're going to talk about, what they're going to
4040480	4040880	announce.
4040880	4043520	I fully expect the price to be four 99.
4043520	4046800	I just feel like it's kind of a different ball game this time.
4046800	4050400	We had that complication last time when we were talking about PlayStation four and Xbox
4050400	4055280	one where Microsoft under different leadership was convinced they needed to bundle the connect
4055280	4055840	in.
4055840	4058160	And, you know, some people were in favor of that.
4058160	4059200	Some people weren't.
4059200	4060000	It is what it is.
4060000	4060400	That's good.
4060400	4062000	That's not a factor this time around.
4062000	4066800	So I think because that's kind of out, I think you are looking at two very similar systems.
4066800	4070240	And so I think you're going to be looking at similar prices and I fully expect PlayStation
4070240	4072240	five to clock in at four 99.
4072240	4078240	I also realized cause, um, in, um, on social media, some folks were saying, well, Sony
4078240	4080960	doesn't have to announce the price and date.
4080960	4085120	They don't, they can do whatever the fuck they like, but I think the pressure is not
4085120	4086640	like they would be foolish not to.
4086640	4092320	And I will say this, I would argue, yes, they do have to announce the price and date before
4092320	4099520	September 22nd, because what happens on the 22nd pre-orders for Xbox series X start.
4099520	4104240	And because, because I mean, if they're not launching this year, then that's gonna kind
4104240	4104800	of hurt them.
4105360	4111600	I mean, um, you don't, you don't have to do anything besides die and pay taxes.
4111600	4116000	And if you're lucky, you might be able to cheat death, but I do think so.
4116000	4118080	Sony is under a lot of pressure.
4118080	4120000	Like it kind of has to come out this week.
4121040	4122960	It would be very, very foolish.
4122960	4127360	And I think they will take a lashing, not just on social media, but they will take a
4127360	4132800	lashing from investors, uh, and that audience, if they do not succumb to the pressure to
4132800	4134480	put their cards on the table this week.
4134880	4137840	So color me shocked if they don't price and date that thing this week.
4139680	4142800	I would think that they would have to, um, I don't know.
4142800	4147040	I'm just curious to see, you know, what, what each console has to offer.
4147040	4147680	Like, I don't know.
4147680	4148560	I don't like playing this.
4148560	4151280	Like everyone wants to pick a team.
4151280	4152000	I don't really care.
4153120	4157680	I don't care who the team is because it's just, it's games at the end of the day.
4157680	4162320	Kind of what I was getting at earlier is that, you know, there are things about all the gaming
4162320	4163760	companies that I love.
4163760	4166960	There are things about all the gaming companies that I don't love.
4166960	4168800	It is okay to root for everybody.
4168800	4173520	And even though I'm sitting here saying right now, my brain is kind of tilting like Microsoft
4173520	4178240	this holiday, that doesn't mean I'm writing PlayStation five off for the entire generation.
4178240	4180000	That is completely not the case.
4180000	4182400	I fully expect I'll end up getting one next year.
4182400	4187600	Um, and like I said, a million times now, Sony could still definitely announce something
4187600	4188400	for this holiday.
4188400	4190160	That'll make me go, shit.
4190160	4191760	I have to have that now.
4192720	4197440	And we're going to be having a different conversation, but, but like, I doubt that that's
4197440	4200400	going to, I don't think we would get like a silent Hill this year or anything.
4200400	4203200	If they announced that they're working on something like that, it would probably be
4203200	4204000	next year.
4204000	4210560	And a lot of that stuff, like I just, I don't know, like I can wait on that stuff.
4210560	4215040	I guess if there's something that's really big, like I'm like, I'm excited about obsidian's
4215040	4216720	new RPG that they have coming out.
4216720	4217040	Oh yeah.
4217040	4217600	That looks good.
4217600	4219520	That's not anytime soon.
4219520	4222480	I mean, but I know that's coming at some point.
4222480	4226160	Um, but it's just also like, there's also the, all the game pass stuff.
4226160	4231520	Like there's a whole library of Xbox games that I haven't played yet, um, that I could
4231520	4232640	play on this console.
4232640	4236320	Like, so I'm going to be busy with all that stuff for a very long time.
4236320	4239680	Plus I still have my library of PlayStation four stuff that all these games I've purchased,
4239680	4244960	like the final fantasy seven remake or final fantasy 15 or kingdom hearts three all spring
4244960	4249040	except it's kind of odd, uh, just cause for like all this stuff I can go back and play.
4249040	4252160	But if I was in the opposite position than I really am.
4252160	4256880	And if I was in the opposite position where I had a gen one PlayStation four, you know,
4256880	4262160	basically early release PlayStation four and an Xbox series X, my brain might be thinking
4262160	4266720	I need to get PlayStation five because even if I have a large library of PlayStation four
4266720	4270640	games left to play, we know that PlayStation five is going to have the SSD drive.
4270640	4271760	Those games are going to run better.
4271760	4275600	It's going to carry over those enhancements from the pro things will look better.
4275680	4279520	So I might, I might've answered this question differently if I didn't,
4279520	4281680	if I had a different configuration today in my own home.
4282480	4284880	And how are they treating like PlayStation four games?
4284880	4287680	Is the PlayStation five going to be playing PlayStation four games?
4287680	4290160	I think, how's that working with my library and stuff?
4290160	4292560	Like if I have all my games there, how's that work?
4292560	4294000	And they, are they going to be upscaled?
4294000	4297200	I mean like that, I need all these kind of like questions answered.
4297200	4303760	Yeah, I think they've given a vague yes because they've demonstrated Spiderman on
4303760	4305760	PlayStation four runs better on five.
4305760	4307280	So they have addressed it.
4307280	4310640	And you know, there was that whole Mark Cerny talk where then PlayStation kind of had to
4310640	4312640	correct it and say, it's going to be more than just a hundred games.
4312640	4313280	Don't worry.
4313280	4314320	But I do agree.
4314320	4318560	It would be very nice for Sony to answer the question very fucking clearly.
4318560	4320320	How does backwards compatibility work?
4322000	4326560	And I fully expect if the answer is it doesn't, they're going to, when it comes to PlayStation
4326560	4331040	three, two, and one, I would love for, I would love for them to go the other way.
4331040	4333600	And that would be soft leak on that, but I'm prepared for it.
4334000	4335600	They'll probably dance around it.
4335600	4337760	If they, if they don't say it, it's not happening.
4339920	4340240	All right.
4340240	4342480	Well, we'll wait and see later this week.
4342480	4343120	Yes, we will.
4343120	4343760	We sure will.
4344560	4348880	DJ Rama S says there has been talk that PlayStation five won't be backwards compatible with a
4348880	4350240	lot of PlayStation four games.
4350240	4350960	Hmm.
4350960	4352240	Who, who's saying that?
4352240	4354640	What, what official channel is saying that?
4354640	4361120	I think what is happening, that is a misinterpretation of the Mark Cerny talk where he said they're
4361120	4367040	working on the top 100 games, but Sony did correct that and say it will be many more,
4367040	4371600	which to be fair, that is exactly what happened when the Xbox three, no, I'm sorry.
4371600	4374480	The Xbox one started backwards compatibility.
4374480	4378880	The Xbox three 60 games, they were working on the largest titles and then it had the
4378880	4383360	side effect of, Oh, but these other titles work too by getting halo three to work.
4383360	4384000	Oh, guess what?
4384000	4386320	That made Barbie horse adventures work too.
4386320	4387920	That wasn't on our radar, but cool.
4387920	4388880	We'll add it to the list.
4389520	4393520	And that's, that's how backwards compatibility worked over there, but I'm, I'm kind of with
4393520	4396400	She-Hulk 10, keep your PlayStation three in good shape.
4396400	4400720	Cause sadly, I don't think that I, and it should be, but that's, that's a whole nother
4400720	4401200	thing.
4401200	4401440	All right.
4401440	4402800	Anyway, we're going to move on.
4402800	4406400	Let's go back and talk about game pass for a minute because another thing that came out
4406400	4410560	this week for Microsoft's camp, some of you guys were yelling this out in chat earlier,
4410560	4414320	but yes, uh, Xbox game pass is going to be getting a big edition.
4414320	4418480	EA play is going to be baked into Xbox game pass.
4418720	4419200	It's still good.
4419200	4421920	I shouldn't, I shouldn't phrase it that way because it's still going to be a separate
4421920	4427600	service, but basically as a game pass member, you will have access to the entry level of
4427600	4428640	EA play.
4428640	4433120	I want to point out EA play has like a basic level and an ultimate level.
4433120	4437040	The ultimate level is the one where I think you get demos of free games or demos of upcoming
4437040	4438240	games and stuff like that.
4438240	4439520	That is not what you're getting for free.
4440800	4447120	Based when you get the demos, I think, I think, um, the pro one, you get like the actual games
4447120	4452400	like games pass does, but I think the, the base one, you get like 10 hours of brand new
4452400	4458960	games when they come out, uh, 10 hour demos, but then, um, you get libraries of older games,
4458960	4460880	you know, for free that's included with it.
4460880	4461120	Yeah.
4461120	4466000	So, but that is still going to really ramp up the amount of games playable on game pass.
4466000	4467520	And that's a pretty big deal.
4467520	4471280	So it didn't start yet, but it's going to start this holiday.
4471280	4475120	So I would imagine around the time of the release of the consoles probably, uh, and
4475120	4479120	you're going to get the EA play, which used to be called EA access, which used to be called
4479120	4480080	origin access.
4480800	4482880	They've had some troubles branding themselves.
4482880	4485760	Um, and that's going to be basically baked into it.
4485760	4492720	You do have to have game pass ultimate or game pass PC, but I think, wait, I'm sorry.
4492720	4497120	I miss, do you, can you have just playing game pass Xbox and get this?
4500160	4501040	I don't know.
4501040	4501520	Or is it?
4501520	4502880	Yeah, this is okay.
4502880	4503280	Yeah.
4503280	4507120	Microsoft confirmed the game pass ultimate and PC subscribers.
4507120	4510080	So ultimate is both and PC is just PC.
4510080	4513120	So it is not saying anything about just having the Xbox version.
4514400	4519120	So I don't read the fine print, but I don't know about you guys.
4519120	4522320	I have the ultimate, so I know this is going to be coming with it.
4522320	4524080	Not that there's a lot of EA games.
4524080	4530240	I get super thrilled about, but, um, if it's true that EA is going to be putting out a
4530240	4531600	mass effect remaster.
4532240	4536720	And if that is a part of this service, I'll be very happy about that.
4536720	4537920	That's for sure.
4537920	4539600	Um, and you know what?
4539600	4544160	Maybe I would try more things like NHL and some of the sports products.
4544160	4548400	If I didn't have to pay 60 bucks for them, I might be inclined to try some of these sports
4548400	4548720	games.
4548720	4552800	I otherwise don't usually look at game pass has challenged me to play more games.
4552800	4554320	I might not usually play.
4554320	4555360	So there is that.
4556320	4557840	So, all right.
4557840	4560080	S2100 Matt says, be still my heart, Rob.
4560080	4561360	Well, why wouldn't I?
4561360	4562880	I'm already paying for game pass.
4562880	4565520	So if I can try out the NHL game for free, why wouldn't I?
4566720	4568000	Free, using my quotey fingers.
4568560	4570560	Questbuster says, Mirror's Edge is really good.
4570560	4572480	Yeah, that would be another one that would be in the library.
4572480	4573360	So neat.
4574080	4574960	All right, let's move on.
4574960	4577040	How about something from Nintendo's camp, DarkSakura?
4579200	4582960	Yes, stuff from Nintendo, which is actually pretty, pretty cool.
4582960	4587120	Um, I actually missed the first Hyrule Warriors and I really wanted to play it because I wanted
4587120	4590080	just to play around as Linkle because she was cute.
4591360	4598320	But Nintendo of America did announce recently that there's going to be a new Hyrule Warriors
4599360	4605280	being worked on by Koei Tecmo and Nintendo and it's Hyrule Warriors Age of Calamity.
4605280	4608240	It should be out on November 20th of this year.
4609040	4615680	And it's set right before the 100 years before the events of Legend of Zelda Breath of the
4615680	4616180	Wild.
4617120	4623280	So you basically are playing the active participants that you're seeing through all these
4623280	4628640	flashbacks, all the, the, the, uh, the, the heroes that we're working with, Lincoln,
4628640	4631440	Zelda, the champions, um, you get to play with them.
4632080	4633200	Zelda will be playable.
4633200	4635040	She apparently gets to use the Sheikah Slate.
4635760	4637760	Um, you know, stuff like that.
4637760	4642240	And so the thing that I'm actually interested in for this is just having like hopefully
4642240	4645520	a little bit more lore because I love the universe of Breath of the Wild.
4645920	4651840	Um, and, uh, looking at some of the promotional artwork for it, it actually just very gorgeous.
4651840	4656240	It has the same overall animation style that Breath of the Wild does.
4656240	4658560	And I think it's going to be a fantastic tie-in.
4658560	4659060	Yeah.
4659520	4664320	You know, this isn't technically a first party release, but it feels like it because it's
4664320	4665280	a Zelda game.
4665280	4669520	And I think this is a very smart thing for Nintendo to be pushing this holiday, uh, between
4669520	4672320	this and the Mario Kart, uh, real life thing.
4672880	4677040	Uh, I think that's a pretty strong holiday lineup when we were expecting this year to
4677040	4679280	be pretty quiet due to COVID and so forth.
4679280	4683120	And we've kind of been getting that sense that Nintendo maybe has been challenged with
4683120	4686960	this situation more than anybody else, just because of how silent they've been.
4686960	4690000	But I think this new Hyrule Warriors is really exciting.
4690000	4692720	And, and Jamie, I, I would loan you the first game.
4692720	4694080	I think I've got to have it somewhere.
4694080	4695440	I don't think I bought it digitally.
4695440	4697920	I think I do have it on cart, uh, and I would loan it to you.
4697920	4698880	It's a fabulous game.
4699680	4701200	I would, I'd be happy to play it.
4701200	4704480	I mean, Dan and I could play it together, but you know, right now, what happens with
4704480	4705360	games that I borrowed?
4706160	4706720	Yeah.
4706720	4707760	They get animal crossed.
4708800	4712160	Well, maybe this will be something that can be a distraction for a couple of days.
4712160	4717440	Cause the, the lawyers, I still need to get back into last of us, but, um, but yeah, I,
4717440	4721040	I would be happy, happy to borrow it when we have a day that isn't on fire.
4721040	4721440	Yeah.
4721440	4721680	Right.
4722560	4723360	Hopefully that'll do.
4723360	4726720	Weren't they saying it might rain in Oregon next, next week?
4726720	4728080	Hopefully I hope that's true.
4728080	4728800	I really hope so.
4728800	4735280	But, but, um, but who knows, maybe someone in my house will take another stop by a local
4735280	4737040	C's candy and share the goodness.
4737920	4738420	Excellent.
4739120	4739840	All right.
4739840	4744160	Uh, well, let's move on while we, well, actually I quickly Loki, just a pulse check on you.
4744160	4745600	What's your thought with Hyrule warriors?
4746400	4748160	Um, I do want to get it.
4748160	4753360	My least my, I showed it to my, my son who's been playing, uh, through breath of the wild
4753360	4755040	and he's like, we got to get that.
4755040	4755360	Yeah.
4755360	4759200	I think, I think this might be a three for three type of situation.
4759200	4764160	Cause I think this is one where even though I wasn't so hot on the 3d all stars, I, I'm,
4764160	4766080	I was a fan of the first Hyrule warriors game.
4766080	4770080	It always impressed me just how many characters are in that game.
4770080	4773040	You play, it's like 15 different people.
4773040	4774480	And I'm like, who the fuck is this?
4775280	4777200	I was always on the fence about buying it.
4777200	4781040	Like I almost said, purchase it so many times, but I just never did.
4781040	4783760	Um, so I may have to do it now.
4783760	4786800	May have to get the new one and then may go back to the old one as well.
4787360	4791680	Um, Bobby black Wolf and chat says I'd rather see persona five scramble
4791680	4795200	than a Hyrule warriors TBH, both muscle games.
4795200	4798880	Um, yeah, these, these, uh, which is, uh, dynasty warriors, right.
4798880	4801680	It's basically what all these games are based on essentially.
4801680	4802320	Yes.
4802320	4806480	Um, yes, there is that persona when there was another one, not that long ago too.
4807120	4809440	That was like a dynasty warriors S type of game.
4809680	4811600	Um, damn, I can't remember somebody in chat.
4811600	4812640	Maybe we'll yell it out.
4812640	4816800	Um, but I remember, I remember playing 99 nights on Xbox 360 and thinking that
4816800	4819760	was much better than most people gave it fire emblem.
4819760	4820240	Thank you.
4820880	4823840	It's fire emblem warriors, but DJ Rama says it was horrible.
4824640	4828000	So that was the other one I was trying to think of.
4828000	4828480	All right.
4829040	4830480	Uh, let's move on more Nintendo news.
4830480	4830980	Loki.
4832000	4832480	Yes.
4832480	4835840	Um, so there's been a rumor for a while now that there's going to be some sort
4835840	4838080	of switch pro or something coming out.
4838080	4840160	Um, and that's still a thing.
4840560	4844320	Apparently though, there's more rumors that there is going to be an upgraded
4844320	4846720	switch model coming out in 2021.
4846720	4851760	And along with that, apparently Nintendo started asking some of the, uh, game
4851760	4856160	developer studios out there to start making switch games 4k ready.
4856640	4861760	So I think the rumor is that it's going to be a, some sort of upgraded switch.
4861760	4863920	That's going to be able to output the 4k.
4863920	4868400	Um, not sure if that necessarily means that they're going to have older titles
4868400	4874800	as well, but you know, maybe we'll get some sort of news about this in the
4874800	4875600	next few months.
4876080	4879520	Um, maybe this coincides with that March 31st date.
4880720	4883680	Maybe there's a whole reason why those digital games aren't available after
4883680	4884180	that.
4885360	4886720	Maybe a new system's coming out.
4886720	4887280	We'll see.
4887280	4889840	I guess we'll wait until then take.
4890480	4893600	Now I'm just, that would be very interesting if that is the reason why these
4893600	4896320	games are suddenly unavailable has to do with some type of new system.
4896320	4899280	But again, I'm not sure logically why that would be the case, especially if
4899280	4903600	this is supposed to be like a switch pro, but yeah, it wouldn't be.
4903600	4906960	I, yeah, I can't imagine that that would be the case.
4906960	4909520	It's probably just, I don't know.
4909520	4912320	I don't know why you would make a digital game available for a limited
4912320	4912820	amount of time.
4915120	4917200	I don't know, but I guess we'll find out.
4917840	4920080	I don't know, but I guess we'll find out.
4920080	4922080	I'm waiting to hear more news about that.
4922080	4924480	Um, I would like a switch pro.
4924480	4929680	So I actually have a switch I can play because the rest of my family has mine.
4929680	4933760	Um, but yeah, I mean, it'd be interesting to see what they do with that.
4933760	4935360	I'm excited for a Mario game.
4935360	4937600	I'm excited at the prospect of them going to 4k.
4937600	4941680	One other thing I have to worry about buying this holiday is a 4k TV.
4941680	4946400	Let me ask you nerds in chat and you nerds here in the, in the room.
4946400	4950640	I'm, uh, you know, obviously we've all seen there are super cheap 4k TVs right now, right?
4950640	4956800	Like I can get a 4k TV for $399 or $499, but it's come to my attention that I should really
4956800	4962320	look into either the OLED or whatever Samsung's version of that is called.
4962320	4966080	They have something different, but I think I'm right now leaning towards the OLED.
4966080	4970240	That is like a $1,400 TV, but damn, it looks good.
4970240	4974400	Like I saw it in the store at like Costco and I saw another one at Target and I was
4974400	4975680	like, this looks good.
4975680	4980400	And I'm trying to future proof my TV a little bit because the problem with the TV I have
4980400	4982320	now, a it's not 4k.
4982320	4985280	B I bought it right before HDR became a thing.
4985280	4987120	So my TV doesn't even have HDR.
4987120	4990320	So it kind of pissed me off when that started taking off because I dropped quite a bit of
4990320	4991360	money on that old TV.
4991360	4996240	So my question to you guys in chat room is, should I just buy the cheap TV to get it done
4996240	4996640	with?
4996640	5002640	Or if I have a nice, if we've been really good at saving this year and you might be
5002640	5006560	thinking like, Rob, you're talking about buying a PlayStation or Xbox, a TV, that's
5006560	5007440	a lot of money.
5007440	5013360	Well, I didn't go to any conventions this year, so that has saved quite a bit of money.
5013360	5019200	So you know, and there's been, I've been very fortunate with circumstances in my day job
5019200	5020160	and stuff like that.
5020160	5023200	So should I just invest and get that better TV?
5023200	5026480	Cause I feel, or what seems like a better TV or is it better?
5027200	5029600	Because it seems like it might be so.
5030720	5032240	It depends what you're looking for.
5032560	5041040	Really a lot of those, it comes down to like, even just like contrast, HDR, what type of
5041040	5042720	features you want in it and stuff.
5042720	5045040	Just watch a lot of TV reviews out there.
5045040	5047360	I mean, even some of the cheaper TVs aren't so bad.
5047360	5052480	I have a not too expensive TCL TV and it's fine.
5052480	5055200	It's 4K and it seems okay.
5055200	5060000	It's just, if you're really like a video file or something, you may want it a little higher
5060000	5064320	end, but I wouldn't spend like, I don't think you necessarily need to spend $1,400.
5064320	5066560	It depends on how big of a TV you want.
5066560	5068400	55 inch is what I was looking at.
5068400	5069280	Oh, then yeah.
5069280	5070800	Oh God, no, you probably wouldn't.
5070800	5075200	I think we just bought, we bought a really large one for my mother-in-law that was like,
5076080	5082000	I think it was like 600, but it was like, it was like a 60 or 70 inch TV is ridiculously
5082000	5082320	huge.
5082320	5083600	I mean, that TV looks huge.
5084560	5088160	But so just make sure that the latency on it is low.
5088880	5090240	That's definitely important.
5090240	5092000	A lot of TVs are pretty good about that now.
5095680	5096320	Yeah, sure.
5096320	5096720	Real quick.
5096720	5097200	Sorry.
5097200	5099520	Bonds 006 says OLED and QLED.
5099520	5100720	You can't lose going with either one.
5100720	5102960	It's QLED was the Samsung one I couldn't think of.
5102960	5103440	Sorry guys.
5103440	5103940	Thank you.
5104560	5109600	Tiger Claw says if you care about 120 frames per second, then you would need to get a 4K
5109600	5112080	that has the HDMI 2.1 inputs.
5112080	5114320	Those TV are 120 megahertz.
5114320	5118720	So I think he's kind of giving me a hint at how to future proof because 120 frames a second
5118720	5119520	is where things are going.
5119520	5121280	It sounds like it is.
5121280	5124320	S2100 Matt says I could get a 55 inch under 1K.
5124320	5127280	I could, but can I get an OLED QLED under 1K?
5127280	5129120	Actually, I think a QLED is under 1K.
5131120	5134480	And then some folks saying best time to buy a TV is November.
5134480	5134960	Yes.
5134960	5136640	A few shout outs for Costco.
5136640	5138000	That's actually what we were looking at.
5138000	5139600	Something else that's happened during all this.
5139600	5144080	We haven't had a Costco membership ever, but Alan finally jumped the shark and got
5144080	5144720	one.
5144720	5147520	So we probably will get from them.
5147520	5149360	And that's what I've been kind of pricing with.
5149360	5150160	So we'll see.
5150160	5150660	We'll see.
5151120	5151620	All right.
5152080	5153520	Anyway, let's move on.
5153520	5156000	I want to move on and get to some more stories here.
5156000	5162000	Let's get to a story on an old classic, which is funny because this is a game that I feel
5162000	5168160	like is going to be 120 frames a second and 4K and all this stuff when it's Minecraft.
5169760	5170960	But Minecraft is getting...
5170960	5172080	Hello Minecraft.
5172080	5172720	I know.
5172800	5175120	But hey, it's a solid game.
5175920	5180720	There's a reason it's lasted this long and it's moving into another new thing.
5180720	5182560	And that is PSVR.
5182560	5183040	That's right.
5183040	5188240	PlayStation VR is going to be getting a VR version of Minecraft, which when you consider
5188240	5192000	that Minecraft is a Microsoft's own thing, it is.
5192000	5196720	Of course, Minecraft has existed on PlayStation, but you were kind of getting the sense that
5197760	5199760	it was PlayStation was kind of supported second.
5200720	5205440	So it's interesting that I think that the PlayStation VR is getting a version of it
5205440	5208800	because they really could have probably skipped it and no one would have cared.
5209840	5211600	This is not a new game.
5211600	5216720	If you own existing Minecraft on PlayStation, you will be given the VR patch for free.
5216720	5218000	So that's pretty cool.
5218000	5219840	We don't know what the date is, though.
5219840	5224080	There will be two modes for the VR, immersive and living room.
5224080	5226240	But they don't say how that works.
5226240	5227280	My thought is...
5227280	5228560	I can tell you how it works.
5229120	5229920	Can I say my guess?
5231200	5236000	It's going to be like No Man's Sky, where one mode you can use your D-pad to move around
5236000	5237200	in full 3D.
5237200	5240400	And that's for people that want to have the full VR immersion.
5240400	5245200	The other mode is for people that maybe don't do so well with VR and need to take it a little
5245200	5245760	easier.
5245760	5248160	And that's where you kind of project yourself forward.
5248160	5250720	You're not actually having the full motion.
5250720	5253760	You're moving like it's a game board.
5253760	5256160	You're moving a couple squares ahead at a time or a couple squares left.
5256160	5256960	That's my guess.
5256960	5257840	You're close.
5258720	5263840	The way it works is the living room mode is basically a virtual VR living room that you're
5263840	5266160	literally playing it on a virtual screen.
5266160	5268240	So it's just 2D Minecraft in VR.
5269200	5271280	It's like a VR living room.
5271280	5273920	Immersive is actually in VR.
5273920	5277680	So the way they have Minecraft, you can actually do two modes.
5277680	5278080	They have...
5278640	5283600	There's a motion mode where you can move with just the controller and move around and everything
5283600	5284240	independently.
5284240	5287040	And I think there's also a teleportation option as well.
5288000	5292640	When I was doing it on Gear VR, it was with just like actually moving around and stuff.
5292640	5293280	And it was all right.
5293280	5295920	I didn't feel like really sick from it or anything.
5295920	5297760	And it worked fine on the Gear VR.
5297760	5298880	I think that's also how they work.
5299440	5303760	The mixed reality version on Windows 10 works as well as like that.
5304800	5306160	So it'd be kind of curious to see...
5307520	5310880	I'll definitely play it again because it was fun while I did it.
5311680	5316080	But with the Gear VR is kind of hard to play that for a very long time.
5317200	5321840	I still got to figure out how to do that with the rip desk right now on the...
5321840	5324080	Because I have the Windows 10 version, so I should be able to do that.
5324880	5327440	I just haven't figured out how to do the VR part on that.
5328880	5329120	Yeah.
5329120	5332160	And I didn't even realize the Gear VR version was a thing.
5332160	5334800	So I guess they already have a VR...
5334800	5339840	So maybe it wasn't as much of an investment to make the PlayStation VR version work.
5339840	5344160	It's probably some type of adaptation of the Gear VR version.
5344160	5346640	Maybe not literally, but I'm sure a lot of the code that made the
5346640	5349120	Gear VR work is making PlayStation VR work.
5349680	5349920	Right.
5349920	5353200	Because basically those versions were all based off of Pocket Edition,
5353200	5354960	which is now what Bedrock is.
5354960	5357440	And that's the ones on all the other platforms.
5357440	5360080	So it's easier for them to develop for that now.
5360080	5361200	It's not straight Java.
5362000	5366480	I mean, it's probably one of those things I'll try once and go, huh, interesting.
5366480	5367600	And then never do again.
5367600	5369680	That's kind of what I was with No Man's Sky.
5369680	5372080	I love No Man's Sky and it is gorgeous in VR.
5372080	5375120	I just can't play it in VR for very long because I just get really like,
5376240	5378560	this is too much sensory overload.
5378560	5382960	But that's why I think VR is very much like cell phones for me.
5382960	5388560	Games that are designed with it in mind are always better than the other games
5388560	5391680	that kind of like have VR injected into it.
5391680	5392400	You know what I mean?
5392400	5393840	Beat Saber, fun.
5396080	5397680	Tetris Effect, fun.
5397760	5400880	But these games that kind of inject it after the fact,
5400880	5403360	like No Man's Sky is kind of like, oh, okay.
5404720	5406240	That's kind of how I feel about it.
5407520	5407840	All right.
5408480	5409200	Let's move on.
5409200	5412080	We have a few more stories for you guys.
5412080	5412800	Dark Sakura.
5412800	5413680	This is kind of a neat one.
5415120	5415760	Yeah.
5415760	5419680	I came across this one and actually posted it in my Animal Crossing community.
5419680	5421840	I run on Facebook, but I thought it was really great.
5421840	5425440	And I'm going to start off by saying how much I love and support the Trevor Project.
5426400	5433040	They are for suicide prevention for LGBTQA plus youth, and they do some amazing stuff.
5434320	5438000	Their website is thetrevorproject.org.
5438000	5444480	But at any rate, they have released Animal Crossing clothes to help prevent youth suicide.
5445440	5450320	Basically just to bring awareness out there and put out the colors for the Trevor Project and offer
5450320	5456640	just a way to keep that awareness going by using their branding.
5458000	5467440	I mean, it was actually stated from a Nielsen survey that 10% of all gamers over 18 identify
5468160	5476400	under the rainbow and that they spend more on games than peers in similar age groups.
5477200	5482080	So if you want a little bit more about, you know,
5482080	5486560	helping to, you know, downloading the items first of all,
5486560	5492320	but then going in a little bit more for helping youth with their charity.
5494160	5504560	The creator code is M like Mike, A like Alpha 724817021536.
5504560	5508320	And you can access by searching the custom design portal inside the Able Sisters.
5510640	5513280	And the items will all say TRVR.
5513280	5518160	So Tango, Romeo, Victor, Romeo, Cap or overalls or whatever.
5518160	5523840	And then if you want a little bit more, you can also go to trvr.org slash care,
5523840	5526400	C-A-R-E, Charlie Alpha Romeo Echo.
5527440	5529600	But I love that they're doing this.
5529600	5532640	I love that they're reaching out to the community to do this.
5532640	5534720	And I'm going to share the link in the chat room.
5535760	5537520	I think that's a great thing.
5537520	5543360	And it's a great charity because, you know, this these times are really difficult, you know,
5543360	5546320	with the pandemic going on and the fires and just everything.
5546320	5550080	There's so much and the social justice movement, everything.
5550080	5551680	There's a lot of stuff going on right now.
5552240	5559040	And it can really cause people to, you know, have some really bad mental health days like I
5559040	5560720	and I've been very open about this on Twitter.
5560960	5564720	There's been some days lately where I'm just like, I'm not I'm not having a good day today.
5564720	5565840	I just I'm not.
5565840	5568400	And it's just that constant like, I can't go anywhere.
5568400	5569680	I can't do anything.
5569680	5578240	And imagine if you are a young LGBTQ, et cetera, a young rainbow person that is stuck in a,
5579360	5585280	we'll just say, abusive environment towards, you know, your gender identity or your sexuality
5585280	5588000	or whatever it is in the rainbow community.
5588000	5592160	Like, you know, if you are in a situation and you can't leave it because of everything
5592160	5596960	else that's going on in the world, that can be very, very troubling for a person's mental
5596960	5597520	health.
5597520	5601040	So I'm glad we're taking a moment, even if it's through a video game, even as through
5601040	5605040	a social phenomenon like Animal Crossing, to kind of bring some attention back to that
5605040	5607040	because people be struggling right now.
5607040	5610240	Yo, and it's and people are struggling in all sorts of different ways.
5610800	5612400	So I agreed.
5612400	5618320	And I mean, and I'll go ahead and I'll be a little bit more open with with this right
5618320	5628080	now with the year that we've had with with Dan's mom and, you know, losing my dad a few
5628080	5630560	months ago and everything else going on.
5631840	5638480	You know, it's I'm actually having to take time off to deal with things.
5638960	5644560	And I'm going to be going actually into some therapy myself.
5644560	5646240	And I encourage everybody.
5646240	5648240	There is no shame in seeking help.
5650160	5653360	In fact, if you need it, please reach out to your resources.
5654480	5656560	There are some free services out there.
5656560	5662480	If you're a veteran, you can try to find something through the VA, you know, look to the charities
5662480	5663120	out there.
5663120	5666240	There are resources out there for you one way or another.
5667200	5673920	So and just know that there's a phrase that my old manager used to have outside his his
5673920	5678880	cube that said, be kind for everybody is fighting a hard battle.
5681440	5683120	This battle is maybe very private.
5683120	5686960	They may be very public, but everyone is struggling and we should be kind.
5688560	5692480	And the concept of going to the doctor when you're sick is not one that you should be
5692480	5696160	embarrassed of when it when it's, you know, you're in the hospital.
5696160	5700880	You have a flu or if you suspect you have covid, nobody gives that a second thought.
5700880	5701280	Right.
5701280	5705200	So why again, the same thing of the saying you go to the doctor when you're sick.
5705760	5708480	Why shouldn't that apply to all types of sick?
5709200	5714800	So well, and you know, it's like, you know, when people are like, oh, you know, I'm having
5714800	5716080	a depressive episode.
5716080	5718880	They're like, well, did you did you try yoga?
5718880	5721040	Did you try eating fruit?
5721040	5722960	You know, which I've heard everything under the sun.
5723600	5725600	Well, I'm sorry about your broken leg.
5725600	5727920	Did you try, you know, doing yoga with it?
5728640	5731360	Yeah, it went through the doctor and you had it set.
5732400	5737760	It's it's the equivalent of when I when I have a cold, I had these symptoms.
5737760	5738560	Did you take zinc?
5740640	5747040	Well, zinc actually does have a medically proven, but still, you understand, you get
5747040	5748400	what I'm right.
5748400	5750640	And yeah, and I'm actually going to go.
5750640	5752240	May I tangent a little bit?
5753200	5754080	60 seconds.
5755280	5758320	Girl, anyway, and I'll go ahead and let everyone know this.
5758320	5764400	I've been on medication for depression and anxiety since I was probably still a late
5764400	5765440	teenager.
5765440	5769600	And there's people out there like, oh, it's going to change your brain chemistry.
5769600	5771680	Well, that's the fucking point.
5771680	5775840	My brain chemistry was making it hard for me to function around other people.
5775840	5780720	I would be dead if not for the drugs that have saved my life by improving my mental
5780960	5782800	health and my ability to cope with things.
5783360	5789360	I had years of undiagnosed autism that once I got my diagnosis, they were able to change
5789360	5794560	my medication to tweak it to that so that it assisted with the way I function in life.
5794560	5797840	And Rob, I think you remember when I decided to quit my meds once.
5799200	5800800	And how insufferable I was.
5802640	5803140	Yeah.
5804160	5808880	Everybody, please thank Rob for his heroic sacrifice, for having experienced that.
5808960	5815200	So none of you have to, um, but you know, just, just say right now, you know, wasn't
5815200	5822080	that, wasn't that a Disneyland trip when that was Disneyland and we had it out and that
5822080	5823440	was my birthday.
5823440	5824400	It was my birthday.
5824400	5825200	That was a day.
5826000	5831440	And I think the only reason I didn't kick your ass metaphorically, not, I would never
5831440	5834720	actually, but, you know, uh, metaphorically was that it was your birthday.
5834720	5837680	And I was like, I'm going to be very fucking polite because it's her birthday.
5838240	5839440	Oh, then we had it out.
5839440	5843600	And I think I went back on my meds, like the, like, right when I got back to Sacramento.
5843600	5844100	Yeah.
5844240	5847520	So, um, but sometimes you fight with your sisters, it happens.
5847520	5849280	There's a little hair pulling and then you work it out.
5850320	5855200	But, but, you know, just to, just to say, you know, the next time, and if you have ever
5855200	5859280	said this to somebody, I hope it was so far in the past and that you've learned your lesson.
5860080	5865280	But, um, you know, if someone's on medication at the moment, someone says, well, you should
5865280	5871440	just try doing this, you know, holistic, blah, blah, whatever, tell them to kindly
5871440	5872640	shut the fuck up.
5872640	5876080	And you need to try my vagina scented candle from Goop.
5878160	5878720	That bitch.
5880400	5885600	No, just, just tell them to shut the fuck up and actually talk about shit they really
5885600	5886160	know about.
5886160	5886660	Okay.
5887200	5887700	That's all.
5888560	5893120	If someone doesn't, if you have someone in your life who's suffering, offer to let them
5893120	5895120	talk about it, but respect if they say no.
5895120	5896240	Just let them know that you're there.
5898160	5900720	I think I, I broke the break man in chat.
5900720	5901920	Who's going, what the fuck?
5901920	5903200	It's a real thing, buddy.
5903200	5905600	Look it up or don't actually don't look it up.
5907440	5909200	I'm coming in hot enough for one night.
5910480	5910980	All right.
5911440	5911940	Yes.
5912640	5913920	Gwyneth Paltrow is crazy.
5915440	5919040	To be fair though, she feels that it smells like flowers and stuff.
5919040	5924800	So it doesn't actually smell like, you know, what I, what I actually love is that it's
5924800	5931520	labeled as bougie parfumé and she wants $75 for a fucking candle.
5931520	5934880	Like I can make a candle that smells like a twat and I can make it a lot cheaper.
5935520	5936320	All right.
5936320	5937680	Moving on, please.
5937680	5942480	Anyway, yeah, let's, let's try to get back to the good message we were trying to get
5942480	5943280	to at the beginning.
5943280	5944560	And that is gave.
5944560	5948880	And some of you guys were saying this in chat as well, is that, um, you know, the way animal
5948880	5950320	crossing has really kind of helped.
5950320	5954560	Um, SHG100 Matt in chat says animal crossing came at the right time for plenty of folks
5954560	5956800	who needed that escape and sense of enjoyment.
5956800	5958400	2020 has sucked.
5958400	5962480	Uh, DJ Rama S says, I truly love how animal crossing has been bringing so many people
5962480	5962960	together.
5962960	5963680	Yes, for sure.
5964640	5968560	Oh, see, now we have pod culture saying that we should have dream merch.
5969120	5970480	So the twat candle.
5970480	5970720	What?
5970720	5971680	Yes to merch.
5971680	5972720	No to that candle.
5972720	5975440	You want to miss, you want to Mr. Smoosh's litter box candle?
5975440	5976960	Is that what you want, America?
5976960	5980400	I'll make a twat candle, but twat's gonna sound, is it gonna stand for something?
5980400	5981840	I just haven't decided what yet.
5981840	5982340	Yeah.
5983200	5983700	All right.
5984340	5986900	Anyhow, candle and send it out to somebody.
5989300	5993460	Sia Tabiri suggests stroup, drop waffles, stroup, twat waffles.
5993460	5994180	All right.
5994180	5994500	Okay.
5995540	5997620	Moving on, please.
5997620	5998100	Yeah.
5998100	5999780	We had other big news this week.
5999780	6003380	We had a whole third party news thing we haven't even talked about yet.
6003380	6003540	Right?
6003540	6004100	Logie.
6004100	6004500	Yeah.
6004500	6004820	Yes.
6004820	6007940	Speaking of speaking about twats, let's talk about Ubisoft.
6007940	6013540	Uh, so first off, you have their CEO come out and make a separate apology video.
6013700	6020500	Of course that wasn't part of this presentation, but he's sorry for stuff and promises that
6020500	6021300	things will be done.
6022980	6024340	Let's speak louder.
6024340	6029300	The words, my friend put your, I mean, I know they're talking about, and some of the things
6029300	6033700	they're talking about sounds promising, so actions speak louder than words.
6033700	6035220	Let's let's, let's see it happen.
6035220	6036020	Make it happen, buddy.
6036020	6036520	Yeah.
6037140	6042580	But anyways, so during their Ubisoft, uh, forward showcase, they were talking about
6042580	6045380	some new games and some older games and stuff like that.
6045380	6050500	So some of the things that they're showing off, uh, immortals Phoenix rising, uh, got
6050500	6051380	a release date.
6051380	6056980	It's now December 3rd as originally a game called gods and monsters, which looked kind
6056980	6059700	of interesting, sort of like a Zelda type game.
6059700	6066100	Uh, so that's something coming out later this year, uh, a remaster, uh, Prince of Persia,
6066100	6071300	sand of times, I guess, or I guess maybe a remake, I don't know it a remake, I guess
6071300	6073060	that is going to be coming out at some point.
6073620	6075060	Uh, so it's in the works.
6075060	6079780	They announced that, uh, Sam Fisher from splinter cells is going to be coming into,
6079780	6081860	uh, rainbow six siege.
6082900	6086020	Uh, finally going to be remastering and re-release.
6086020	6090420	I don't know if it's a necessary remaster, at least re-releasing the Scott Pilgrim versus
6090420	6096420	the world game is going to be coming back out now on PlayStation 4, Xbox one PC switch
6096420	6097540	and stadia.
6097540	6099380	That's coming out this holiday.
6099380	6101300	A lot of people really happy about that one.
6101300	6102260	And I, I understand.
6103540	6104100	Very cool.
6104100	6108740	Um, Aiden Pierce is going to be back in watchdog Legion.
6108740	6111860	So he is from the very first watchdogs games.
6111860	6116100	And apparently that's only as part of their season past DLC or whatever.
6116100	6117940	So, uh, neat.
6117940	6122820	I guess if you get the DLC or the, the season pass, you also get the original game.
6122820	6125140	Funny enough, I actually have the original game.
6125140	6127300	Still haven't played it this day.
6127300	6132100	I have it in a, in the package, but still haven't played it.
6132660	6137460	Um, and then of course they announced a brand new game called writers Republic, which is
6137460	6138660	from the makers of steep.
6138660	6143700	It definitely looks like steep in a lot of the sense of that game.
6143700	6148820	Um, this is kind of more of like an extreme downhill racing game.
6148820	6153140	Um, almost a little bit like motor store meets deep.
6153140	6154260	Um, I don't know.
6154900	6156020	It's interesting.
6156100	6158500	So that's something that's going to be coming out a little bit later.
6158500	6162260	Uh, also from their pre-show, they are showing off some more stuff as well.
6162260	6167300	Far cry is getting a new VR game of far cry VR dive into insanity.
6167300	6171220	It's going to be a multiplayer game up to eight people come out in 2021.
6171220	6177860	They had this, uh, Damon Paris journey back in time, which is like some VR, um, Notre
6177860	6178260	Dame.
6179380	6180260	Uh, I don't know.
6181780	6184980	Some sort of a game in Notre Dame, right?
6186100	6186420	Yeah.
6186420	6189460	So it's something that's coming out, I guess, for the Oculus.
6189460	6194420	Um, they're showing this game roller champions, which is still coming out next year.
6195060	6202180	They talked about, um, this game's a monster prom is getting a SQL monster prom to monster
6202180	6208660	camp it's in development and yeah, just more, uh, content coming to the other games to division
6208660	6211940	two for honor crew to all getting more content.
6212660	6213700	So nice.
6214660	6215160	Yeah.
6216180	6217780	A lot of good, a lot of good stuff coming.
6217780	6221780	I mean, obviously, you know, there's very fair criticisms and how they've been responding
6221780	6226580	to, um, some of the criticisms out there, but from strictly a games perspective, um,
6226580	6228820	the games are looking pretty, pretty cool out of there.
6228820	6234020	So, um, no one special 77 and chat says I probably won't buy the Scott Pilgrim game
6234020	6239220	if it's sold exclusively through Uplay, maybe steam, but I prefer GOG TBH.
6239220	6243220	I haven't heard of Ubisoft selling anything exclusively through, through Uplay.
6243220	6245700	I bet if they do, it won't be for very long.
6245700	6248580	It'll probably be for the first month, but it'll be on steam.
6248580	6253860	And probably, I don't know if I don't have they been selling stuffs, uh, through Uplay
6253860	6254500	exclusively.
6254500	6257860	I thought they've been, I don't know about exclusively, but they do sell things to their
6257860	6258420	own storefront.
6258420	6259060	They sure do.
6259060	6260900	Have they been doing stuff through Epic though?
6260900	6264180	I can't remember if they're one of the companies that was doing stuff through Epic or if they've
6264180	6265300	gone through steam.
6265300	6270260	I think recently, I think both, but I could be wrong.
6270260	6271540	It's hard to keep track these days.
6271940	6276340	Yeah, I don't know, but it's still exciting to see that game coming back.
6276340	6278260	So, um, pretty cool.
6278260	6278500	Yeah.
6279140	6279460	All right.
6279460	6283220	Well, moving on, let's talk about, um, this is kind of neat, uh, another company, very
6283220	6286340	different company doing kind of a collector's set.
6286340	6290660	So it's Annapurna Interactive and you may or may not have heard them.
6290660	6295300	They do a lot of kind of, I guess more like artistic and indie games that are available
6295300	6298180	on PlayStation four, um, and other systems as well.
6298180	6301060	I know they put games out on switch, but this collection we're talking about is for the
6301060	6302180	PlayStation four.
6302180	6305780	And what's really cool about this is that Annapurna is going to be, uh, teaming up with
6305780	6311380	I am 8-bit to do a physical PlayStation four box set with eight games.
6311380	6317380	So it's going to include games like what remains of Edith Finch, Sayonara Wild Hearts, Donut
6317380	6319060	County and Outer Wilds.
6319060	6322420	So, you know, these are all games that they've done, but what's also really cool about this
6322420	6328660	is that some games have never been released on a physical format before, including Goroga
6328660	6333780	is one of them and Telling Lies, which I talked about on the last OLR because I just got into
6333780	6336180	that game a few weeks ago and I really liked it.
6336180	6339700	Um, and so it was very different, um, but I really liked it.
6339700	6343300	Uh, so it's kind of neat that they're doing this box set and it looks pretty cool.
6343300	6344900	Now it's going to set you back.
6344900	6346980	It's $179.99.
6346980	6351220	So 180 bucks for this, uh, with exclusive cover sheets and anything, but it is meant
6351220	6353060	to be a collector's item.
6353060	6358260	If you want to spend another 20 bucks, you get the deluxe PS4 limited edition with an
6358260	6364260	ultra premium custom designed folio package and a forward from the founder of Annapurna,
6364260	6369620	um, Nathan Gary and some statements, uh, with the team behind each game, there will be a
6369620	6372340	limited run of 2000 copies for that.
6372340	6375700	So that's going to really be for the diehard fans, but you know what?
6375700	6380660	That's that company's put out so many good games and just like artsy indie titles that
6380660	6381860	really resonate.
6381860	6384020	Um, I bet there will be a lot of people to go for that.
6384820	6386500	So, all right.
6386500	6389380	So now we're going to take a trip back in time.
6389380	6394660	We're going to go back to, there was, there was no eight disc collector set of things.
6394660	6395540	Well, I don't know.
6395540	6400980	Maybe you would have collector sets, but they came with a dish and a spoon or a poster.
6401860	6406100	Yeah, no, and not, not those are a, uh, um, uh, pillowcase.
6407060	6407700	All right.
6407700	6411300	You know, I'm talking about the classic game of the week and every week dark soccer steps
6411620	6415860	into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, Hey, you kids should be tech checking
6415860	6416740	this game out.
6416740	6418660	What is the classic game of the week dark soccer?
6419460	6423220	It's tech romancer suggested by my very own Dan.
6424740	6428580	So, uh, tech romancer is a, it was an arcade game.
6429220	6436580	It's Japanese game was Choko Senki Kikayo, um, which was a 3d fighting game that came
6436580	6438340	out in 1998.
6438420	6442740	Um, by the way, that name means chronicle of super steel warrior.
6442740	6445620	Kikayo Kikayo is a, it means a machine.
6446420	6453220	So it was basically a fighting game that was based off of different sub genre of Becca
6453220	6454020	anime.
6454020	6457860	And of course it did come out to the dream cast as things in that era did.
6457860	6464100	Um, so basically you come, you control a giant robot and you fight one-on-one combat with
6464100	6465140	another giant robot.
6465780	6472660	Um, and the cool thing about this is that the studio new, uh, new eight, which is these,
6472660	6479700	it's the same animation studio, uh, that did the mechanical designs for super dimension
6479700	6484580	fortress, Macross, which, uh, as we know was Robotech in the U S but they designed the
6484580	6485380	robots for the game.
6486340	6490660	Um, I mean, that's, it's so funny cause you totally have this one that looks kind of like
6490660	6493060	Mazinger Z style and everything is pretty cool.
6493620	6499860	Um, so at any rate, um, you are far in the future of earth and you have advanced technology
6499860	6507140	and everyone can just like chill, but then a alien tyrant named gold BS invades and you
6507140	6507940	got a fight.
6508580	6511300	So you have two, uh, primary modes.
6511300	6513940	You have story mode and hero challenge mode.
6513940	6518660	The dream cast one also had mini games that can be played on the VMU to get more points.
6519300	6526820	Um, in Japan, the game was re-released, um, as, uh, Choco Senki Kikayo for matching service,
6526820	6531860	which, um, matching services usually for online play and it had online functionality.
6532420	6538580	Um, so you have a flat 3d pane with buildings and other things scattered around.
6539140	6544100	Um, and if you destroy the terrain, um, by either breaking them or walking through them,
6544100	6549860	you get power ups and you, uh, can get three different weapons, armor, or life power ups,
6549860	6553540	a hero mode power up, which increases the power of your MECHA attack.
6553540	6557140	And you can also get additional abilities and different moves.
6557140	6562340	So instead of having a round, your match is decided by your life meter.
6562340	6567940	Um, so you have two life meters and when the second one is depleted, then you're done.
6568580	6574900	Um, and then you also have an armor gauge that can be broken and lowers your overall defense.
6574900	6580180	Then you also have at least two super attacks and a final attack, which, uh, you can use when
6580180	6586180	your opponent is down to the last 50% of their second life bar. And it's usually like an insta
6586180	6595940	kill. Um, it was actually, uh, listed as one of the most successful arcade games in Japan.
6595940	6604340	Um, game machine listed it as the sixth most successful. Um, the dreamcast game, um, in the
6604340	6613220	U S it wasn't really seen as, um, as great in the U S as it was in Japan, just because that same level
6613220	6618900	of nostalgia, I guess, isn't present here as it would have been for the whole series of MECHA
6618900	6624820	anime that had existed since, you know, the sixties. I mean, sixties really, you know,
6624820	6630660	you have your tattoo on Adam, you have, uh, Mazinger Z, you had everything leading up then into
6630660	6637620	like even, uh, got your mind in the seven early seventies, you had, uh, all kinds of, you know,
6637620	6641220	there's a lot more, I think, uh, nostalgia for it in Japan than there was for it here.
6641780	6649220	But, um, it got a 29, um, out of 40 from Famitsu is generally, uh, considered favorable. So,
6649220	6653540	I mean, and we know how stingy Famitsu is. So yeah, overall it got really,
6653540	6659220	really good ratings, uh, anywhere from average to the higher end of, uh, of the scale.
6662260	6670260	And that is tech romancer, which there you go. I'm curious before we go out to the show, if, uh,
6670260	6675220	Loki has ever, uh, checked this game out. Cause I know you're a big mech person. And so this is
6675220	6679300	like a mech fighting game. So I'm curious if this is something that it was ever on your radar, Loki.
6679940	6685300	Uh, no, I was unaware of the whole game. Yeah. I have to admit, I was not very familiar with
6685300	6689060	this game either. So, but you said it didn't have like a huge reception in the U S really
6689060	6693140	compared to Japan, right? Yeah. It was kind of like the people who liked it really liked it.
6693140	6697860	I mean, it is sort of, you know, it's a genre game and you know, if you're looking at the, uh,
6698740	6704980	the video here, you know, it's, it's like the, each of these Mecca come from their own like
6704980	6709300	anime series. They've got little intros and special logos for them and everything.
6709940	6717700	So, um, so the game is really, uh, I wouldn't even say a love letter to the, uh, the genre.
6717700	6721940	Yeah. Um, sorry, just some quick comments from chat that kind of, uh, along those same lines,
6721940	6725940	orange, right. Says, love how everyone has their own logo. Uh, Questbuster says,
6725940	6728420	yay, tech romancer. I still have this for my dream cast.
6730660	6736500	Well, and, uh, bones double six wants me to keep, uh, you know, naming off, uh,
6736500	6745540	mecha anime. So, uh, I was actually thinking though of, um, cyber bots. It's kind of gives
6745540	6751780	me a little bit of a cyber bots field, but cyber bots was, uh, was, uh, 2d. But I mean,
6751780	6759140	we also had, you know, uh, you know, I mentioned Mazinger Z. We had, um, that was a Go Nagai
6759140	6764420	anime, um, who also gave us devil man. You remember that one? Um, we had, uh,
6764420	6773380	Tetsujin 28 Go, which we got in the USS Gigantor in 1963. Um, we had, uh, Gundam, the whole Gundam
6773380	6779780	series as a big space saga with giant robots. Um, and I'm sure Gundam wing was really, I think
6779780	6786020	the one that kicked the Gundam series into popularity here in the U S we had, uh, Dan guard
6786020	6793380	ACE. We had for us, we had go lion that turned into the lion Voltron over here. Um, and we also
6793380	6803620	had, um, uh, that became vehicle Voltron. Um, Evangelion can even be considered a mecha anime,
6803620	6809620	even though that they are not really mecha, they're organic. Um, and then of course all
6809620	6814660	these things, you know, I would think that if you released a mecha game now with the advent of
6814660	6822660	Pacific rim, for an example, um, you know, and that a lot more people are more well versed in
6822660	6827860	various, uh, you know, anime, you know, a lot of people have gone back and tried to discover the
6827860	6834500	classics, you know, and that I think that maybe the game might have a better chance right now. I
6834500	6842260	mean, we had, we had a Voltron, you know, uh, kind of a redo that was released in the U S um, but I
6842260	6848740	mean, I remembered loving my mecha anime and like the nineties, like Palabor, um, even dominion
6848980	6855220	police could be considered a mecha anime. Of course. Um, we had, uh,
6856740	6861540	gosh, honestly, now I'm just thinking of all, all of the, the various kinds, cause I, I do
6861540	6868100	love my mecha anime. I liked, uh, got demo eight, the mess team. Uh, I, I like turn a Gundam was
6868100	6873380	actually pretty interesting. Um, even transformers, I think could be considered a, a mecha anime of
6873380	6880660	sorts, but I mean, you know, we had our, our introduction to a lot of this when we were a lot
6880660	6886820	younger, you know, even with what, um, they did for Robotech over here, we had my cross, we had
6886820	6893300	most beta bubblegum prices could be considered a mecha anime. So, which hopefully some of these
6893300	6899380	names are actually, you know, familiar to people, you know, fire Robo, all, all, all of that. So,
6899460	6908820	all right. Uh, I love me some mecha in chat says I keep reminding people of a PS2 mecha game called
6908820	6916420	robot out alchemical drive, which started my obsession with mecha animes. I remember that
6916420	6921460	when I was supposed to brings up robot carnival, which was, uh, it was, it was pretty good. Uh,
6921460	6929460	metropolis, I think, um, there, cause there was, uh, yeah. Metropolis. There was the, um,
6930580	6934100	I can't, why can't I remember her name, her name or the Rose opera singer.
6934980	6938660	Bring us back from the classic game segment that I turned off. No, no, it's all good.
6938660	6942180	Trip down memory lane, but a tech romancer is your classic game of the week. There you go.
6943060	6946660	Tech romancer is awesome. Tastic. And you need to play it. And then, um,
6947300	6951620	but also play cyber. All right. We might talk about some of these other games in coming weeks.
6951620	6955700	That's for sure. Um, but I know for tonight, uh, dark Sakura, I know we have to let you go
6955700	6959860	a little early tonight. She has some family things to take care of, but, um, thank you,
6959860	6963620	of course, for being here as if I have to thank you. You've been here every week, but still
6963620	6970660	appreciate it. Mostly weeks, real life. Sometimes your life has different, uh, different, uh,
6970660	6974260	designs on my time. Yeah. Understandable. There's a lot going on. Um, so
6974660	6980260	sorry. Any final thoughts for our listeners before we let you go?
6981140	6987540	Um, I encourage everyone here in California, sorry, my glasses are all smoky. Um, number one,
6987540	6993700	I have new glasses and I think they're freaking adorable. And yes, I sprung for Prada. Um, second,
6993700	7001460	um, if you're out in any area, do not go outside without your mask. Even if you are not sick,
7001460	7005220	other people may be, please be respectful of other people by wearing your mask properly,
7005220	7010580	covering your nose and your chin, and do not put it to your chin because of the moment you
7010580	7015140	pull it back over your face, germs that you have on your skin from your neck will go over your face.
7015140	7019700	Second of all, make sure you wash all of your hands. Um, you know, 20 seconds, you know,
7019700	7025860	seeing I will survive or something, um, or some belly parton. And also here in California,
7025860	7032340	if you can swing getting, uh, filters for your masks or getting a, um, respirator mask,
7033060	7038580	please do it. Don't go out there and damage your lungs. Just stay inside and stay safe.
7038580	7043220	Play some games. All right. And don't go any concerts. God damn it. Smash mouth.
7043220	7045620	All right. Thank you to our soccer. We'll see you next week.
7046500	7052900	Boy. All right. Bye. Bye. All right. Let me just, uh, while I fix the, uh, discord there
7052980	7057540	so we can see Loki front and center. All right. Let's get into some rapid fire news,
7057540	7063300	some quick headlines for the week. Loki. So, yes. So there's, um, some new games coming out.
7063300	7067940	So one of those, um, from one of my favorite companies, D three is releasing yet another
7067940	7074900	Oni Chambara game. Uh, that's the bikini samurai, uh, zombie Slayer game that's going to be coming
7074900	7083620	out October 14th, uh, Oni Chambara origins on PlayStation four and PC. So it, it is what it is.
7083620	7090100	It's, uh, they had a very interesting, um, debut like release date trailer for it. I think it had,
7090100	7095060	I can't remember which, um, Japanese artist was in, but it's a Japanese metal band. Um,
7096020	7101860	so interesting. Um, and then of course, um, another kind of eclectic game like that as well.
7101860	7108660	No more heroes three, unfortunately is going to be delayed to 2021 because of course, COVID-19.
7108660	7114420	So they've, um, said that because of that, it, their team has been hard hit at a grasshopper
7114420	7120740	manufacturer. And so that they've decided to focus on prioritizing quality and to push back
7120740	7128100	the final release date. So now it's coming out in 2021. So this year, so I can wait. It looks good.
7128100	7132500	Who knew there were so many similarities between no more heroes three and marshmallow peeps.
7133460	7139940	Also not coming out this holiday season. Sorry. It's a terrible joke, but it's true
7139940	7145700	for this holiday for Halloween. Yeah. You know how they do peeps every now they do peeps,
7145700	7151460	like they do pumpkin peeps for Halloween. They'll do like peppermint peeps for Christmas. They'll,
7151460	7154820	they'll sell those things to you around for any Europe. You're only supposed to put that
7154820	7161540	Easter. No, not anymore. Not anymore. All right. Some rapid fire headlines for me.
7161540	7168180	Apparently the Ninja Gaiden trilogy has been registered as a trademark for PlayStation
7168180	7174500	four and switch. This is a Hong Kong software distributor game source entertainment listed
7174500	7179940	these for Nintendo switch platforms in 2021. Oh, remember the days when things would get spoiled
7179940	7186820	from distributor release dates, Loki, remember the times. So this may be a thing. Now, apparently
7186820	7192740	the listing was eliminated, but some folks over on a big forum caught that. And there's apparently
7192740	7200580	a bundle with Ninja guidance, Sigma Sigma two and Ninja Gaiden three razors edge from 2012.
7200580	7206740	So it's a huge so, Oh man, I was thinking it was the original trilogy. I got excited.
7206740	7211620	No, no, no, no. All right. So it's the newer games. Well, those are okay.
7211620	7218020	Uh, that will be coming out apparently in March for 40 bucks. Okay. So a new Ninja Gaiden trilogy,
7218020	7224980	why not? If it's good enough for Mario, why not real? All right. Also another quick headline about
7224980	7231620	a mobile release for iOS and Android called Pac-Man geo. It looks like it might be Pokemon go
7231620	7236100	meets Pac-Man, but guess what? It's not that I read, I looked into this a little more. It is not
7236100	7242100	Pokemon go with Pac-Man because what it is, New York, Paris, Tokyo, make a Pac-Man maze by
7242100	7247060	choosing from a variety of real world streets. So you just play Pac-Man on a variety of real world
7247060	7255620	streets. You know what this is? Uh huh. It is. It's that Google April fool's joke. It is just like,
7255620	7261460	what's interesting. You know, the, the SIM similarity there between Pokemon go is that
7261460	7268420	Pokemon go was born of that April fool's joke. Uh, that was the kind of the first kind of
7269460	7275220	pebble, if you will, that started the avalanche of Pokemon go was when that Pokemon Google April
7275220	7280180	fool's prank happened. It ended up like, wow, this would actually be a really fun type of product in
7280180	7285060	the real world. So now that's what they're doing with Pac-Man, except it really is kind of like,
7285060	7289540	download the maps and play on these maps. But I mean the Google, the Google integration thing
7289540	7295460	was fun. So I'm sure this game will be fine, but it is not Pokemon. Like a lot of outlets
7295460	7300500	are just saying it must be Pokemon go meets Pac-Man. It's not that. Yeah. So at least it's
7300500	7305700	free. So you can try it out and then immediately delete it off of her devices because it's probably
7305700	7309940	not really great. I still think it's interesting how many Google April fool's jokes are becoming
7309940	7316900	reality. You want to know what else is funny? Okay. So Ingress Niantic Niantic used to be a
7316900	7323780	Google own thing, right? Until they split off on their own. Well, the April fool's joke in Ingress
7323780	7329860	one year when Google was over them was that it changed your avatar to Pac-Man and all the XM
7329860	7335300	became dots and all the portals or pokey stops, whatever were ghosts. And you could change them
7335300	7342660	to green and blue colors. That was the gag in Pokemon or Ingress one year. So it's kind of funny
7342660	7349620	how like all these Google jokes come alive in the real world. So SSG100 Matt says, I mean,
7349620	7359620	to be fair, how many OLR in jokes have been made into games? Two bungee ferret tossing and pixel
7359620	7367460	shits, right? Or pixel poops on the Vita. So, yeah. All right. So that so far, we don't know
7367460	7372980	of any mystery projects that may be coming. All right. Moving on. Let's travel around the world
7372980	7377540	and check out some release dates of things coming a little sooner than bungee ferret tossing too.
7378420	7386420	Yep. So this week we've got BPM bullets per minute. That's that rhythm of FPS that's coming
7386420	7394900	out on PC. Fight crab on Nintendo switch. Your crabs and your fighting. Spelunky 2.
7395540	7400420	What else do you need to know? I mean, it's literally what it is. You have like
7400420	7409140	crabs of weapons. There's Spelunky 2 on PlayStation 4. Welcome to Elk on PC and Xbox One.
7409780	7418180	Crisis Remastered on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Super Mario 3D All-Stars on Nintendo Switch
7418180	7424820	and WWE 2K Battlegrounds on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Stadia.
7426340	7431060	That's it. All right. Let's travel to Japan. We're on the Nintendo Switch this week. You can check
7431060	7438180	out Azure Lane. Crosswave comes out on September 17th. Atomic Crops also comes out on September
7438180	7443620	17th. And then the Super Mario 3D All-Stars also gets a release in Japan the same day as the rest
7443620	7449300	of the world, September 18th. And it looks like a one mother game for the 17th, excuse me. Pro
7449300	7455540	Yaku Famitsa 2020, which Loki just mentioned for the US as well. Checking the PlayStation 4. I
7455540	7462020	imagine you're going to have some overlap. Atomic Crops is on the PlayStation 4 as well and E-Football
7462020	7468500	PES 2021 season update. So literally just a roster update coming for Konami and Pro Evo Soccer in
7468500	7473460	Japan. And that is it for the PlayStation 4 this week. A little lighter over there than the Switch.
7474020	7477460	So there you go. All right. We have a few more headlines and then we're going to get to the
7477460	7481300	listener round table with some emails. We do have two emails tonight to get to.
7481300	7482980	Still got the European dates.
7482980	7486900	Oh, shit. You're right. I skipped those over because Dark Soccer is not here,
7486900	7490260	but yes, usually you will pinch hit for those. So thank you. Please, Loki.
7491220	7498260	In Europe, we've got a Pro Evolution Soccer 2021 that's coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7498740	7501540	No Straight Roads on Nintendo Switch.
7501540	7502580	Gay Roads Only.
7504980	7512020	Super Mario 3D All-Stars on Nintendo Switch. Void Bastards on PlayStation 4 and the Switch.
7512020	7520180	NASCAR Heat 5 on PlayStation 4. Looks like we've got Commandos 2 HD Remaster.
7520180	7526340	That's going to be coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.
7527140	7533460	WWE 2K Battlegrounds on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch and PC as well.
7534100	7537700	Beholder Collector's Edition on Switch. And that's it.
7538580	7543300	All right. Thank you for not neglecting our UK audience. Appreciate that.
7543300	7543860	Of course.
7543860	7547940	All right. But we do have some more headlines we're going to get into, including this one.
7548660	7551380	Pretty interesting shift to change coming and something we've been
7551380	7552980	talking about for a few weeks. Right, Loki?
7553620	7560660	Yeah. So Apple has made some changes to their game streaming rules, which apparently
7561380	7566260	could lead the way for Xcloud and Stadia to be allowed onto the App Store.
7566260	7572180	However, there's some caveats with that. So streaming games are permitted as long as they
7572180	7578260	adhere to all of their guidelines. And I guess each update must be submitted for review.
7578260	7583300	Developers must provide appropriate metadata for search and games must use in-app purchases
7583300	7588740	to unlock features or functionality. Each streaming game must be submitted
7588740	7593700	to the App Store as an individual app. So that's kind of irritating.
7593700	7599620	So, for example, if you have Xcloud, Halo would have to be its own app.
7599620	7603620	Forza would have to be its own app. Gears of War would have to be its own app,
7603620	7608660	which is absolutely stupid. But that's the way that they're forcing it to be done.
7609860	7616420	Each game streaming service may offer a catalog app on the App Store to help users sign up for
7616420	7621140	the service and find the games on the App Store, provided the apps adhere to all the guidelines.
7621140	7625220	So basically you can have a catalog app that basically links you to the other
7625860	7628500	individual games that you have to download to your device.
7630100	7635700	I have some mixed thoughts on this. Obviously, we know that banning the streaming apps was not the
7635700	7640820	direction we wanted to see Apple taking. So it does seem like we might have our first crack in
7640820	7647540	the glass. And this is very different from the Apple and Fortnite situation. That's a whole
7647540	7652180	other thing. We're not getting into that again tonight. Although things are still happening in
7652180	7656260	that space, but it's basically more legal documents. Well, you did this, more legal
7656260	7660580	documents. You did that. But anyway, back on this, I think, and I said, I don't think Apple
7660580	7666100	is on the right side with this because they don't review every movie on Netflix. They don't review
7666100	7671380	every song on Spotify. Why do they want to review every game that's going out on streaming? Which is
7671380	7678260	kind of what this policy is, right? They literally want to review every game. And I think the
7678260	7683540	companies maybe want to put, and I still don't think this is going to be the final answer
7683540	7687300	because perception is everything. And I think the users are still like,
7687300	7695220	no, this isn't really what we want. And if Netflix can have Bandersnatch, which is a game,
7695220	7701940	and I'm sorry, the Black Mirror Bandersnatch episode, which is a game, and Netflix can have
7701940	7707220	the Minecraft story mode, which is a game, and that isn't a problem, then there's kind of like
7707220	7711140	a double standard there, right? Yes, there's lots of things like that, yeah.
7711140	7714740	Here's the thing. I don't think anybody else, well, it's the internet, probably somebody posted
7714740	7719860	on a forum somewhere, but I want to talk about what I think the issue is here, what the real
7719860	7727620	sticking point is here, and why Apple's doing this. And here it is. I know a lot of you in
7727620	7733460	chat are like, oh, it's money or Apple's selfish. No, come on, come on, get past all that. What is
7733460	7741300	the real answer? I'm going to tell you what it is. It's the games on xCloud and the games on Stadia
7741940	7750340	that are also mobile phone games. Those are the problem. And that I think is the issue that has
7750340	7757460	to be worked out. What do I mean by that? My example is, let's say Microsoft next week is
7757460	7762740	going to add Sayonara Wild Hearts to Game Pass. I don't know that that's the case. I'm making it up.
7763700	7768180	So Microsoft adds Sayonara Wild Hearts, which great, you can play that with a Game Pass
7768180	7772820	subscription, right? With an xCloud subscription and all that, right? So you could download this
7772820	7778420	separate app to your phone and play that. Wait a minute. There's a problem. Sayonara Wild Hearts
7778420	7786820	is also a standalone Apple game. I'm sorry, not Apple first party game, I'm sorry. Standalone app
7786820	7791700	that is available through Apple Arcade, which is another complication, but we'll say is also
7791700	7797220	something that stands on its own. That is the problem. And I think-
7797220	7801620	Yeah, but I think that's a problem that Apple should have because it's the developer of the
7801620	7805380	game should be able to decide, hey, I want my game to be played free with this thing.
7805380	7809860	It really isn't up to Apple. I mean, the developer can change the price of their game to free at any
7809860	7817380	point. It's not for Apple to decide that. But to say that, Loki, is then saying, well, then we
7817380	7821620	should just allow the Epic Store on iOS, which I don't think we should.
7824020	7829780	I mean, I don't know. I'm not going to take Apple's defense here. And the reason why,
7829780	7837780	aside from this, is just like all of the fuckery that they do with their physical devices and
7837780	7843700	making it difficult for independent repair shops to fix that stuff. They purposely go out of the
7843700	7848820	way to screw the consumer on a lot of things. But they're always saying it's in the best interest
7848820	7853860	of the consumer. It's really just to make themselves money. And I have a feeling that
7853860	7861140	the only reason they're changing these guidelines is not necessarily to open it up to Microsoft
7861140	7868100	and Google to put these streaming services on this device. It's more to protect them from an
7868100	7872180	upcoming lawsuit regarding this stuff. I think it's basically saying that,
7872180	7877220	look, we're playing fair. We're allowing them to be on here, but they have to follow our rules.
7877220	7881860	And unfortunately, it's just the solution they're providing is not adequate enough for these
7881860	7890260	streaming services. I get that angle, Loki, but I think there's a part of this where they are
7890260	7897620	listening. They're understanding that they are viewed as in the wrong by the consumer base,
7897700	7904820	and they have to listen to their consumers. And I think they are trying to resolve this somehow
7905460	7913060	to push this forward so they don't look so crappy. Bobby is elaborating on what I was saying in chat.
7914340	7918900	Yes, Bobby, what you're saying is where I'm going with this. Apple gets a cut from the iPhone
7918900	7923460	version. Apple would not get a cut of the Game Pass version, even though the consumer pays for
7923460	7928420	both versions. So Apple has a vested interest in promoting the app-native version over the
7928420	7933060	cloud version. They do have language that says you cannot make sure that the customer has paid
7933060	7938500	for an app twice, or rather you have to make sure there are no duplicate purchases. So if someone
7938500	7946420	bought Sayonara Wild Hearts, they should not be allowed to play it on Game Pass. This is just my
7946420	7952420	honest, trying to take a step back and not be like, oh, I'm team Apple. To try to figure out
7952420	7959620	what is the sticking point here, this is it. The games that exist both on Xbox and potentially Game
7959620	7966500	Pass and as a standalone iOS Android game, those games that are, and who's to say this isn't going
7966500	7972420	to be a problem for Android as well? Maybe they just haven't thought of this yet. The games that
7972420	7980180	exist in both places, this has to be figured out. And I kind of think the ultimate resolution to
7980180	7988660	this, if Apple does cave on this, there's going to be a clout that will exclude certain games from
7988660	7996020	Game Pass. And it's going to be any game that has a standalone app on mobile stores cannot be a part
7996020	8002340	of Game Pass or Stadia or any of these. And that is how this resolves. Mark my words. I don't think
8002340	8006740	it's going to be a problem though on Android because they already have xCloud on Android and
8006740	8013140	it's working just fine. And obviously Stadia is working on Android because it's a Google product.
8013140	8013640	Fair.
8014420	8020340	So I don't think, obviously, these are not going to be issues. It's just because Apple's being
8020340	8028180	Apple. I don't know what, they can do whatever they want. It's their ecosystem. But I don't like
8028180	8033140	how their ecosystem is such a closed, it's walled off from everybody else and they're not being
8033140	8038180	flexible on anything. But they have, they're well within the right to do that. But I'm also well
8038180	8042100	within my right to think that they're stupid for doing it and not buying their products, which is
8042100	8047220	what I'm going to continue to do. So yeah, you can still still ultimately vote with your wallet.
8047220	8052180	But I do think they're going to end up bending. And I think that's going to be the agreement. I
8052180	8057620	think xCloud and Stadia will be allowed on iOS, but the written agreement will be you cannot put
8057620	8063540	a game out that exists as a standalone app. And that's, that's that. So clip it because we're
8063540	8067780	going to play it again when that ends up happening. Well, I was gonna say, Bobby's saying that many
8067780	8071300	consumers like the walled garden because they feel it's safer. And who do you think put that
8071300	8075620	into their head that it's safer when it's walled off like that? It's Apple's marketing that said
8075620	8081300	that. So you know, that that's what it is. It's the perception put in by Apple saying, well,
8081300	8085940	this is why we do is because it's, it's safer for you. You don't want those viruses, do you?
8085940	8090900	We check everything. But really, there's no risk to the consumer, you know, for the streaming
8090900	8095700	services to put a virus on their phone or something like that. It is a streaming service.
8095700	8100740	It's it's just like Netflix, you're not worried about getting a virus on your TV or, or your phone
8100740	8104980	from watching Netflix or Hulu or whatever. So why should this be any different? I'm with black and
8104980	8110340	pad. I like the walls. I mean, because I feel like with Apple kind of going through with the quality
8110340	8114420	check and all that stuff, and not having all the sideloading and all that stuff, like everything
8114500	8121700	runs at a certain rate, that your performance isn't degraded. And and Allen uses Android,
8121700	8125620	and sometimes I see him run apps. I'm like, why is this frame rate so terrible? Oh, because there's
8125620	8130740	other things running on the side and all this other stuff going on. I just know it's because
8130740	8137540	that Android unfortunately, unlike Apple doesn't necessarily have a finite amount of systems to
8137540	8143380	develop for. And so you have, you know, mixed compatibility, because how do you test your device
8143380	8148580	or your program to run on every single possible system that's out there? All right, that's why
8148580	8153460	the Apple Android debate is not going to be settled here tonight. Let's move on to the next
8153460	8158980	story. You know what, I'm glad there's options. It shouldn't just be one company controlling
8158980	8164580	everything. So I'm glad we can have this debate about Apple versus Android. All right. Let's
8164580	8169540	talk about a game that has you know, and it shouldn't be one game. That's always the number
8169540	8174420	one game on Twitch either, right? It shouldn't be Fortnite forever. And it wasn't it. I mean,
8174420	8180420	it used to be for a long time it was PUBG, right? And it's still PUBG still does very well. Of
8180420	8185220	course, World of Warcraft was a huge game League of Legends. I mean, not to say those games aren't
8185220	8190180	still huge, but you know what I mean? Games come and games go from the number one spot and a new
8190180	8194660	game is showing up at the top of Twitch a lot lately. And there are some articles about the
8194660	8200820	sudden rise of the game Among Us, which I must admit I haven't played but my understanding is
8200820	8206980	it is a social deception game. So social deception games are things like werewolf,
8206980	8215300	the resistance. I love me some survivor and that type of stuff. I like the game Big Brother. I
8215300	8220180	don't like what it's turned into on TV. There's a lot of ugly shit on the show. But the game is
8220180	8227140	a concept. I think it's kind of interesting. So I think these, you know, kind of like social
8227140	8233780	deception games. Now we have one that is showing up in and I will admit, I don't know exactly how
8233780	8238660	Among Us works. I can tell you exactly how it works. Okay, I've actually seen some of it. So
8238660	8244820	the way it works is basically your your crew of 10 that's working on to afford a 10 I should say
8244820	8253380	that it's working on you basically preparing a ship for launch. And so you're you're doing
8253380	8257940	different tasks that you have in there to basically complete that. So there's little
8257940	8264100	mini games and stuff that you do. However, there's some people among you that are actually saboteurs
8264100	8270340	that are trying to, to stop everything. And the whole point is, oh, my God, that was the
8270340	8275860	it's the greatest reality TV show of all time, the mole, you're telling me it's the mole.
8275860	8281300	It's basically the mole. So basically, you do all that. And then after each round, Anderson Cooper
8281300	8287620	there? No, necessarily. But like, after each round, you you call a meeting error, I guess
8287620	8292740	basically, they can call a meeting vote on who they feel is suspicious. And set, they basically
8292740	8298820	kick them through the airlock. So, and so like, if you're a saboteur, you're trying to break stuff,
8298820	8302660	you're trying to kill other crew members. But there's folks that are like, you know,
8304180	8309860	have like cameras, like a watch stuff. It's basically, it's trying to look like,
8309860	8314100	you know, like you're not causing trouble, but also causing trouble at the same time.
8314100	8320100	Okay, and it's the mole that way. Yeah. Oh, my God, that's, that's fucking amazing. I'm gonna
8320100	8324100	have to check this game out. I really am. So I mean, you can see why just in talking about the
8324100	8328580	game. And I can completely see why, especially with the whole like social deception. People love
8328580	8333700	to see people fight. That's why a lot of these reality shows are based in social deception and
8333700	8338740	why shows like Survivor have been on for 20 years. That's essentially a social deception game. I mean,
8338740	8343220	it might not be a mole per se, but it's lying to someone's face. No, no, you and I got to stick
8343220	8346500	together and vote this other person out. And then you vote for, you know, them. You know, it's,
8346500	8350660	that's the stuff that, you know, these reality shows are at their core. And they're very,
8351220	8354820	it's very fast. And then of course, like Werewolf, the classic convention game,
8355620	8361860	is a social deception game. And yes, these games are huge. So this has done very, very well on
8361860	8369300	Twitch. And apparently, they are saying that the creators behind Among Us is that Mafia,
8369300	8374740	which is basically Werewolf, same thing, inspired this game. But apparently, it was originally going
8374740	8381700	to be a mobile only local multiplayer experience with just one map. But it didn't do that great
8381700	8386820	when it first came out. But based on feedback and some other things, they decided to stick
8386820	8392340	with the game, build it up and do these different updates. And now, they have the game to where it
8392340	8399700	is now. And it's doing very, very well online. Apparently, it's kind of started to get popularity
8399700	8405940	in Korea, then really took off there. YouTuber ran with it. And now it's, it's all over Twitch. And
8405940	8410580	now I'm interested in it. I gotta say, I want to check this game out. Although I can be a terrible
8410580	8415460	liar. I don't know why. But I'm pretty good at serve. I mean, I joked about when I played that
8415460	8420740	fake survivor game online last year, I got really good at the ability to just lie straight up lie to
8420740	8423940	somebody and say, Oh, no, we're sticking together. I'm not going to vote you out. And then I wrote
8423940	8430500	their name down the next tribal council. But I can be a horrible liar. Sometimes I'm not very
8430500	8436100	good at things like the resistance. But I'd be curious to see how I do in a game like this.
8437060	8439700	What do you think? Why do you think this game is doing very popular?
8440340	8446820	I think it's just because of it's fun to watch people play it. It's also a relatively
8446820	8452980	inexpensive games like five bucks on Steam. So go check it out. It's just it's simple to
8454100	8458100	get how to play the game. And it's kind of difficult to master because you have to
8458100	8464500	be good at lying to people. And I don't know, it's has a lot of opportunity to be pretty funny.
8465220	8469540	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says the mole with Anderson Cooper was the greatest reality game
8469540	8475300	show ever. Don't at me. Bobby is correct. I need a little I need a little banner. I need a little
8475300	8479860	graphic a little doo doo doo doo. When when Bobby says something like that. And I can just say
8479860	8486740	Bobby is correct. A little a little floating wolf head surrounded by stars that says Bobby is
8486740	8492820	correct. That in comic sans font. That is yes, that factual statement. Well, obviously, the
8492820	8497140	mole is the greatest reality show. I would have loved to have gone on a show like that. It was
8497140	8501620	here. Let me read this on real people. So let me just elaborate a little bit more about what
8501620	8506340	this game is about. So like they're talking about what each like the crew and the imposter. So
8506340	8509780	the crew is basically supposed to win by completing tasks to prepare to ship to
8510420	8516660	or ejecting all imposters react quickly to undo the imposter sabotages. Check the admin map
8516660	8521220	security cameras to keep tabs on other crew members report any dead bodies immediately
8521220	8526740	to start discussion who they suspected the imposter is imposters was to kill the crewmates
8526740	8530900	or frame bystanders. Pretend to run tasks and blended with crewmates. You can sneak through
8530900	8536260	events to move quickly through the ship and sabotage to cause chaos and divide the crew
8536260	8544020	closed doors to trap victims and kill in private. So sounds fun. All right, cross play between
8544020	8549780	apparently it is on mobile, so Android and iOS. And it's cross played between that and PC. So it
8549780	8556660	looks pretty cool. All right, I'm gonna have to check this game out at some point. It sounds like
8556660	8561380	I've been missing out. And I'm always late to the party on this shit. I thought I was cool. And I
8561380	8566580	kind of discovered fall guys early like everybody else. But now it seems like fall guys has already
8566580	8571300	fallen to number two or three on the rankings. Because now there's this new kid in town. So
8571300	8577060	yeah, be interesting. All right, let's move on. These updates are somewhat controversial,
8577060	8584100	right? Loki because they're coming from a hack that probably should not have happened. I just
8584100	8590180	just so you know where my head is at with OLR. We are talking about video games, gaming culture,
8590180	8597060	and your lifestyle. And I think whether we like it or not, this happened. And people are talking
8597060	8602740	about it. And it's on gaming blogs. It's on news. It's on social media. So I'm bringing it to
8603300	8608260	the dinner table or Loki's bringing it to the dinner table tonight. And it is more things that
8608260	8613060	have come out of that Nintendo hack. Yeah, so there's more stuff coming out of this tag. They
8613060	8619540	call it Giga leak three or whatever. So and they said basically, it evolves a huge lot check. Who's
8619540	8626900	they? 4chan, right? Or probably 4chan. Okay. Whoever whoever was that hacked everything and
8626900	8631380	got a list. But it's a dump of like Gameboy and Gameboy Color games that were either finished
8631380	8636340	or close to being finished and sent off to Nintendo for internal certification. But a
8636340	8641380	lot of these games never made it out. So for example, one of the games that was part of the
8641380	8649460	hack was Pokemon Picross, which was cancelled game from 1999. So it kind of neat there is a
8649460	8655220	gimmick land tomato adventure for the Gameboy Color. There's some Hello Kitty pocket camera
8655220	8662100	game for the Gameboy Camera. That's interesting. There is a rock board, which is a game that came
8662100	8666260	out on the Famicom as Mega Man board game. But there's also currently a Gameboy version that
8666260	8673780	leaked out lots of different games theory because the break man says, so it's a bunch of bad games.
8673780	8677940	Well, I mean, the Rockman board game might have been some up some people's alley. And I think
8677940	8682660	those Picross games tend to do well. And I think the idea of a Pokemon Picross sounds really cute.
8682660	8686980	But the problem, quote unquote, with some of these games is that they were relatively
8686980	8692260	late in the Gameboy cycle, right? So it was kind of like, it was not felt the money was
8692260	8697140	I mean, we're guessing, sorry, we're theorizing that the reason why they didn't come out was that
8697140	8702500	probably Nintendo did not feel it was worth the money to publish, make the cartridges,
8702500	8706340	do the advertising campaign, because there was no digital release back then, right? They couldn't
8706420	8712580	just release Pokemon Picross digitally, they could now. But they are probably not going to.
8713700	8718020	And, you know, because a lot of the Picross games they released digitally now at this point,
8718020	8721220	so it wasn't really felt in their best interest, because they were probably moving on to the
8721220	8726900	advance and those sorts of things. So it's, um, but I don't necessarily think the games
8726900	8732580	looked bad. I mean, the Hello Kitty camera thing is probably a cash in of sorts.
8733460	8738900	So like, so if you're interested, check this out. There's a user on Twitch, Luigi blood
8738900	8744260	that streamed a three hour long stream, showing off some of these ROMs. So one of the games that
8744260	8749220	I'm looking at here almost looks like Star Fox, but it's on the Gameboy, which is kind of crazy.
8749220	8753380	So it's almost like vector graphics and stuff. And I'm being corrected by Bobby and chat who
8753380	8759620	loves his Picross. It's how I got introduced to Picross Pokemon Picross was on the 3ds.
8759700	8765540	It was a free to play game on the 3ds. Well, I, so they may have taken some of the same concepts
8765540	8770660	and then reintroduced it later on. So maybe at one point it was this standalone Gameboy color game
8770660	8775460	and Nintendo took, I would be curious if some of the designs and things ended up carrying over and
8775460	8780180	being the same probably was so Nintendo probably just carried some of it over to the 3ds. So
8780180	8785940	that's very interesting. Yeah. There's lots of interesting looking games here, but, um,
8786660	8789940	yeah, like I said, you know, if you're interested in checking out, I mean, it's, it's all over
8789940	8794580	Twitter and all over, um, it looks like it's at least on Twitch a little bit. So, yeah,
8795620	8798740	some of these look kind of cool. It's that weird gray area where it's like,
8798740	8803780	it's a part of gaming history, but it also isn't, it wasn't really meant to ever be discovered. So
8804500	8809780	I, I don't know, it's a really weird space. I kind of think ultimately these games are going
8809780	8814020	to be talked about and buzzed about for a week. And then the internet is going to move on to
8814020	8818020	something else because that's what usually happens. It will be interesting to see the
8818020	8825140	approach that historians kind of take, but I don't think that they really can like archive
8825140	8830100	these actual games because they were never really released, but it would be an interesting chapter
8830100	8835860	in a book somewhere. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know how the historians perspective on this.
8835860	8841380	I'd really like to invite one on the show and ask, how do you, what, what is you, what is your angle
8841380	8846820	with these leaks? Because technically it's all illegal, but it is a part of gaming history.
8846820	8853940	How do you file this away? I don't know. I don't know either. It's, it's, it's complicated. That's,
8853940	8857860	that's the answer. All right. I know at least like, especially like the emulation scene and
8857860	8862180	stuff, there's not a lot that they could do with some of the code and stuff that I remember,
8862180	8865460	because like the previous leaks, they have like the official emulators that were on,
8866420	8873060	you know, the DS or, you know, the Wii. So they can't really use that for their code
8873060	8878420	because they would get in trouble with that. Right. Cause then, then you cross lines from
8878420	8883060	it's legal cause you don't have any, you know, commercial ROMs or whatever with it too.
8883060	8889140	It's illegal cause you stole it. So yeah, emulator teams have to very much keep themselves
8889140	8892180	siloed from this stuff. And that's come up before when we talked about, you know,
8892180	8897380	I think the PlayStation, was it the PlayStation mini hack? I think was a part of that or something.
8898500	8904340	No, not necessarily with that, but yeah, there's like, I think it was with the DS and the 3DS.
8904340	8909140	They had like some hacks with the software for those. Right. All right. Well, moving on to
8909140	8915540	something in a little less of a gray area, this is something I think old school fans of this program
8915540	8919940	and old school music game fans and new school music game fans will be very excited about. And
8919940	8923860	I'm ending the show tonight on a music game. Well, getting to the end of the show tonight on
8923860	8929860	a music game related story, and it is the game series, pop and music. And Konami has announced
8929860	8935780	yet again, another Bamani series for PC, and it is pop and music, and it's going to be called pop
8935780	8942500	and music lively. If you're unfamiliar with pop and music, it is a nine button game. There's five
8942500	8947060	in the front, four in the back, and you kind of hit the buttons in line with the music. And these
8947060	8950900	are giant buttons. If you ever see an arcade machine in an anime convention or something,
8951940	8955620	I always say it's trouble with the pop-o-matic bubble. You know that game with the dice in the
8955620	8959460	middle and you hit that. It's like that, but nine of those that are like the buttons that control
8959460	8963940	the game. It's a lot of fun to play, but it can't hurt your hands. And it will probably be a lot
8963940	8970900	easier on a mechanical keyboard where you're not going to hurt your hands so much. There is a beta
8970900	8976980	with five limited time songs in this limited time beta. There are five songs. They are all Japanese
8977860	8984180	pop and music games, including pop and music 17, 18, 20, Lapistoria, and pop and music peace.
8984180	8989700	So there's just one song selection from those different games. You do have to have a Konami
8989700	8995460	account to participate in the beta, and it is on Konami's website. I haven't played it myself.
8995460	8999780	I'm just imagining it's all in Japanese at this time, as most of these releases have been.
9000580	9006580	But my.konami.net is the place to start, and the beta client is on Japanese website. So you
9006900	9011140	will have to have some type of understanding of Japanese to probably get through the game,
9011140	9015940	although I'm sure there's going to be guides online somewhere. Dark Tetsuya says,
9015940	9020820	admittedly, I really only played pop and once on console back when we all got together to play that
9020820	9025380	stuff. But if this ever gets an official release, I'd be down. Yeah, I hope it makes its way here
9026180	9030340	stateside. I've played it in the arcade. Conventions are a great way to keep playing
9030340	9034580	the game. And round one, you usually will still see at least one pop and music machine at around
9034580	9039220	one somewhere. It might not be in the front with the other stuff, but it'll be around there. And
9039940	9045300	it's a fun game to play. And you got to learn to play nine button mode. Just go straight into nine
9045300	9052340	buttons. It's so much more fun that way. Right, Logie? I was never very good at music to play
9052340	9058740	with nine buttons. All right. I think I've tried. Let's move on. This is the part where you guys
9058740	9062980	get to have more of your voices on the show. We've been reading some of your chat comments all night.
9062980	9067540	But if you have something you'd like to add, please ask away in our chat room over twitch.tv
9067540	9074420	slash vog network. That's twitch.tv slash vog network as we are taping along live with our show.
9076740	9080820	But I have some emails to get to during the segment as well. Every week, you guys can email us.
9080820	9086260	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com and we read some of the emails on the show. So we do have two
9086260	9092100	emails tonight. Let me get to our first email, which is from Robert M that says, I'm also
9092100	9096340	surprised you hadn't covered Street Fighter 2 the World Warriors for the game of the week. And that
9096340	9101940	was the classic game two weeks ago before on our last episode, if you recall. Listening when the
9101940	9106900	episode aired on the 30th reminded me how the title theme is always connected in my mind with
9106900	9113300	the taste of shock tarts. It's been ages since I've tried to hunt down the candy. That is a very
9113300	9119860	interesting association. Are there any video games you associate with food, Logie? I'm trying to
9119860	9127460	think if I have associated anything with food. I mean, food that I eat or just food in general.
9127460	9132980	I mean, really the only food that you eat, like Street Fighter 2 reminds Robert M of shock tarts.
9133860	9147300	Oh, no, not really. I mean, I can say vaguely Halloween candy reminds me of Super Mario 3
9147380	9152020	because the night one of my good friends at the time and I stayed up all night long,
9152580	9157220	literally all night long playing Super Mario Brothers 3 was on Halloween and we were going
9157220	9164340	through Halloween candy like crazy and eating it and playing Mario Brothers 3. So that would be an
9164340	9170820	association I have. Dark Tetsuya says, I have one mechanized attack on NES and pepperoni pizza
9170820	9176660	combos. No one special says, I pretty much associate any retro arcade game with pizza and
9176660	9184740	Pepsi. The break man says, Turkey reminds me of Final Fantasy 3. I love that. She-Hulk 10 says,
9184740	9191540	Donkey Kong and bananas. Why not? In Donkey Kong country, you're collecting a ton of them. Why not?
9192180	9198500	All right. Let me finish the email here. Robert M continues saying, also, if you're shouting out
9198500	9207460	New Horizons dream addresses, mine is DA572727801688. And if you need that again,
9207460	9214100	just hit that 15 seconds backward on your player. I believe if the Sakura of Koholint is Jamie,
9214100	9219700	I visited last month. It is. And so, yes, you did visit. From what I can remember, really nice. And
9219700	9222980	that's from Robert M. And I will have to check out your town at some point, Robert M.
9222980	9227540	So the dream codes that they have, because I know like if you visit other towns, like you get more
9227540	9232260	stuff in your nook shop, because we're trying to get more stuff in our nook shop because it's the
9232260	9235940	same old items that keep cycling through. And I think if you visit other islands, you get more
9235940	9241620	stuff. Do you know if that works with the dream stuff? I would probably not. I don't know.
9241620	9247300	I haven't a clue. All right. You got to ask Jamie. She's the Animal Crossing guru.
9248260	9253620	Yep. All right. A quick note from our chat room before we get to our next email for the round
9253620	9260500	table here. SSJ100Matt says, Magfest met their 100K donation goal during the show. Earlier this
9260500	9265060	week, they decided to cancel next year's show without force majeure, meaning they were on the
9265060	9269060	hook for costs. But thankfully, they met their goal. Well, congratulations to Magfest. Yeah,
9269060	9274740	we hadn't gotten to that during the show tonight yet. But they did cancel Magfest for January of
9274740	9281540	next year. Obviously, the COVID situation is not going to go away that easy. So even though we may
9281540	9286020	be at a point where we can hang out in small groups, at that point, a big convention is
9286020	9290900	probably still not going to be doable in January. But the big deal is they went ahead and canceled
9290900	9294340	and they didn't wait for the legal force majeure thing. So they kind of had to raise money to save
9294340	9299380	Magfest, basically. So they did a telethon and it was still going tonight during the show. And it
9299380	9303140	sounds like they made their money. So congratulations. That's great. Bobby Blackwolf is
9303140	9309460	reminding AGDQ is also going virtual. Little bit of a different situation. They hadn't actually
9309460	9314580	announced a hotel or booked a hotel yet. So they're not having to worry about the fact that
9314580	9319460	they canceled on anybody. But they are going ahead and making the call that it's going to be virtual.
9319460	9325060	So that's two things now in 2021 that are now going to be virtual. And I would expect it's
9325060	9329620	probably still going to be a few months into 2021 before we really start seeing big events again.
9330180	9334340	It's probably going to be at least March, right? Get through this thing a year. But we'll see.
9334980	9341860	And Bobby says they'll still use a hotel as the main command center, though, in Virginia,
9341860	9349940	which they did for summer games done quick. So interesting. Also, virtual packs is going on
9349940	9356740	right now. I'm kind of confused as to what is going on when. They have like three different
9356740	9361460	rooms. And at the bottom of the page does not list the schedule for what's going on.
9362100	9366900	But I tuned into some random stuff and I saw somebody I knew on one of the panels. So that
9366900	9371860	was kind of fun. I was like, oh, her. I know her. So it was kind of interesting. But it looks like
9371860	9376340	they're doing the virtual panel stuff for PAX right now. But have we gotten any game developer
9376340	9382980	companies doing announcements like they sometimes would at PAX? Well, I know, was it that there was
9382980	9387860	stuff about Borderlands 3 that Gearbox was talking about? Oh, the multiplayer stuff, right?
9388820	9392500	On the same screen on PlayStation five, right? Right, right, right. So PlayStation five and
9392500	9397700	Xbox Series X, they're going to have four player split screen and then they're going to also do 4K
9397700	9406500	60 FPS, I think, on for single player if you do that. So that's that's kind of cool. And
9406500	9410980	apparently also there's going to be a vertical split screen options coming as well to current
9410980	9416660	generation games. And apparently they're going to be allowing you to transition. You're going to
9416660	9422100	have all your add on content and save files will be supported in the transition as well to the next
9422100	9428180	chance. All right. Well, let's do all I've heard so far. Let's do one more email tonight from Yyr
9428180	9432820	who says, Hello, LR. On the last episode of the show, there was a bit of confusion as far as the
9432820	9437700	way Nintendo handles their digital game licenses. Not that anyone can be blamed. After all, for many
9437700	9441780	years, Nintendo's way of handling a digital purchase was to simply assign the license to
9441780	9446500	the device on which you purchased the game. However, and fortunately, this policy ended with
9446500	9451700	the Wii U and the 3DS. Beginning with Nintendo Switch, licenses are assigned not to your device,
9451700	9458500	but to your Nintendo account. Pardon me. As long as you have access to your account, you'll be able
9458500	9463860	to redownload your games on any Nintendo Switch. You can assign any single Switch console as the
9463860	9468900	primary console on your account, and any user of that primary console can access your downloaded
9468900	9474260	content. But you can also access your games from any Switch console that you're logged into,
9474260	9479540	regardless of whether it's a primary console. This is actually very similar to the way licenses work
9479540	9484740	on Xbox. Thank you for clarifying. Yes, it is complicated because Nintendo's done it several
9484740	9490100	different ways. So thank you. I'm looking forward to your opinions and analysis on Microsoft's
9490100	9495540	announcements this week. I find the Xbox Series S console to be particularly interesting because
9495540	9500020	I'm trying to figure out its target audience, possibly consumers who want to play the newest
9500020	9504580	games, who don't care about physical copies anymore, who want to save some money, and who
9504580	9510180	also don't care much about 4K resolution or 60 frames a second performance. The real question is
9510180	9515140	how many folks fit into those categories? Thanks again for the show and have a great week. Why YR?
9515940	9521060	Kind of go back to that again. I think it's mainly it's folks trying to game on a budget right now
9521060	9527940	because it's why, you know, there's a market for PCs out there, especially like laptops and stuff
9527940	9534260	that are mid tier, I guess, if you will. Like not everybody buys a two thousand dollar gaming PC
9535140	9541540	to game on. They have graphics cards out there that aren't like the top of the line for stuff.
9541540	9545860	I mean, they just released a whole new series of like the Nvidia 3000 cards or whatever, and they
9545860	9550820	have like it's getting more powerful even on those lower tier cards. But not everybody has
9550820	9556900	to purchase like the top of the line stuff to game. And that's why even 1440p is still really
9556900	9562180	good. Yeah, it's going to look great. Even upscale the 4K is still going to look really good. It's
9562180	9567540	great. It's not like the best it could be, but maybe you don't care that it's the best it can be.
9568820	9573540	And that's what you're wanting to get in honor. You maybe you're buying it for your kids. You
9573540	9579060	don't want to drop that kind of money. So like I I think it's still a very they're going with
9579060	9584820	the value proposition there because that bundle of games pass is a really good deal. You're
9584820	9589700	getting, you know, really good graphics, you know, all the next gen games at launch, you know,
9589700	9595220	from first party next gen games. And you have a library of like 100 plus games to play. I mean,
9595220	9601860	like that's a really good, easy sell for $299. I think in my opinion and the probably the shortest
9601860	9608580	way I can put it is that the Xbox Series X is a living room console. The Xbox Series S
9608660	9615380	is a bedroom console. And it's not going to be that, you know, X, Y, Z, X and S for everybody.
9615380	9622660	It's not going to be that binary for everybody. Nothing is. But I think generally, that's kind
9622660	9626260	of what it breaks down to. If it's kind of like the household secondary console or whatever,
9626260	9631540	a bedroom console or kids console, it's the S is going to be just fine. It's still there's still
9631540	9636340	a lot it's going to be capable of doing. But if it's meant to be a beefy powerhouse 4K,
9637300	9642340	Bobby Black Wolf's basement theater type of thing, like Bobby Black Wolf is not going to waste his
9642340	9648180	time with the Series S. He's going to get the Series X for that setup. That's fine, too. Like,
9648180	9654260	I was like looking at replacing one of my monitors or I may have to be both of them to replace it
9654260	9661700	with a 4K monitor to 120 frames per second. I'm not going to be able to do that relatively easy.
9661700	9668740	So, you know, that might be something that would weigh in whether I get an S or an X. Also,
9670500	9673860	I don't know when these are going to be available or if they're going to be available or how fast
9673860	9677300	they're going to sell out. So, let's see. All right. Let me get to one more roundtable
9677300	9680820	question from chat and then I want to get to any last minute stories you might have tonight.
9680820	9683620	Thank you for the emails, by the way. More emails if you want to send them,
9683620	9689700	participate at orangelaunchradio.com. Last comment here from noinspecial77 who says,
9689700	9694900	I personally think that 1UP Arcade Machines are okay cheap alternatives to actual arcade machines.
9694900	9698740	They're not quite as good because you can't drop quarters and tokens into them. And most
9698740	9704820	retro games used CRT monitors, not modern displays like a 1UP Arcade Machines. So, given the choice,
9704820	9709860	I'd get the honest to goodness retro machine. That said, would you get the retro machine or
9709860	9718100	is 1UP Arcade Machines good enough, quote unquote. I think you kind of said it. It just depends on
9718100	9725140	what you're looking for. If you are looking for that authentic, reminds me of the pizza place I
9725140	9732020	had growing up, I'm okay with dropping tokens or having that whole system in my house, then the old
9732020	9736500	school machine is a fine way to go. And I think you make a good point with the CRTs. You're going
9736500	9743220	to have a hard time. Well, you can probably find secondary CRTs. They're just, they're not as
9743220	9750020	plentiful as they once were. No, they are not. As a person that is speaking with an arcade cabinet
9750020	9756260	that has a broken CRT right now, it is not easy to find and they're not easy to repair and they're
9756260	9762260	not easy to replace. And they're, they weigh a ton. Like it would probably, I seriously am
9762260	9769380	considering replacing it with an LCD screen because even though like I get it, like the old
9769380	9776260	low-res screens look pretty nice and stuff, but like I think I can live with it not looking as
9776260	9779860	perfect as it used to be. I mean, there's so much more you can do with it. And just like,
9779860	9783220	especially if you're going to monitor or something, it makes it so much easier.
9785220	9791060	I like, I don't know. I like my machine. I like the arcade 1UP machine. I have the burger time
9791060	9797940	one. I like it. The display, I like that it's a little brighter and crisper and is it authentic?
9798740	9802900	No, but it's authentic enough, you know, for the price I paid for it.
9804820	9810340	Yeah. It would be nice if, if it was, they were still making CRTs, it would be nice to be able
9810340	9816420	to replace it. But like at this point you have to find somebody that has one and it, that's probably
9816420	9821940	going to be at least like 500 plus dollars, maybe a thousand dollars to replace it. And it's still
9821940	9826340	going to be used and it's still going to, you may have burn-in and all that stuff. Like mine has
9826580	9829860	burn-in on it. You don't really notice it when you're playing it, but like,
9830420	9835380	like, I don't know how to fix it. It's broken. And, you know, you're talking about high voltage
9835380	9842180	and stuff in there. Like I'm kind of scared to try to fix it. So like, you know, I just rather
9842180	9846420	not mess with it. Rather just would have, it would have been nice just to have an LCD in there and
9846420	9852900	then, you know, your place it for like quarter of the price. All right. Well, good question.
9853540	9857140	Anyhow, before we get to wrapping up the show tonight, do we have any last minute stories,
9857140	9862180	Loki? Yeah, we have a few things to talk about. So a lot of this happened a little bit earlier.
9863140	9873460	So EA did some fuckery earlier in the week. So they had added ads in a full screen ads in UFC 4
9874260	9880580	for the boys. So there was an ad campaign there. They, they also reskinned some of the stuff in the
9880660	9885460	actual arena advertising it, but people got really pissed off about it and they eventually took it
9885460	9890020	out. This isn't the first time they've done that though. In fact, they also patched it into EA
9890020	9896500	sports, UFC three. They've also tested this in the past as well, just to kind of see response,
9896500	9900580	but apparently people didn't like it. I think what happened was is they pulled it out for after
9900580	9905140	they got done with their ad campaign because the boys has already launched on Amazon. So
9906100	9912980	it doesn't make sense to have ads in it anymore for that, but whatever. But it's EA B and EA.
9912980	9918740	Speaking of also more things that are just impossible to do. So you may remember we talked
9918740	9922900	about control and five Oh five games and how that they're not going to allow you to have a free path
9922900	9928580	to upgrade your existing copies of control because they say it's impossible. We just cannot do that
9928580	9932900	because the way of the game, the way the game works. So they're basically saying that in order
9932900	9937940	to get the Xbox series X or PlayStation five versions, you have to purchase the ultimate
9937940	9945700	edition. So here's the funny part though, that you know what's coming. So apparently earlier this
9945700	9954580	week folks that owned copies of the original game and also the DLCs or the season pass notes that
9954580	9961460	they also had a free upgrade deluxe edition that was available to download for free.
9961460	9966820	That was already attached to their account. So they had noticed that, well, Hey, wait a second.
9966820	9974020	I already have this as it is. So, so what the heck? And so apparently five of five games had
9974020	9979220	accidentally flipped that switch, but then they realized what they did. And so they revoked it and
9980580	9988020	retracted all those. Oh dear. So, so apparently no, it is not impossible to allow you to upgrade
9988020	9994340	for free. They're just not wanting to do that. They want to charge you again for the game. So
9994340	9998500	just be honest and just come out and say it. But of course they haven't made any sort of
9998500	10007460	comment about it, but yeah, it's interesting. Interesting. What a mess. Yeah. Anything else?
10008740	10015540	Um, that's pretty much it. All right. Well, that brings us to the end of another episode of orange
10015540	10019460	lounge radio. Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show tonight, whether you were listening

10038580	10042580	help us spread the word, leave a nice five star review or tell a friend about orange
10042580	10047060	lounge radio, because the more voices that we have here in chat, the more gamer voices and
10047060	10052180	opinions and all that good stuff we can get out there in the world. Um, you can continue the
10052180	10057540	conversation in our discord server. If you like vog network.com slash discord, we'll get you into
10057540	10061540	our discord server where, uh, many folks share stories. And sometimes we discuss some of the
10061540	10066100	things, uh, throughout the week. I'm sure there'll be a lot of reaction to the Sony conference this
10066100	10070580	week. So I'm looking forward to talking about that on the next episode of OLR. Um, I have to
10070580	10076340	get some friends together, uh, at vog, uh, this week to talk about it after it happens. And then
10076340	10079540	we'll talk about it on OLR as well. So I'm sure there's gonna be a lot of thoughts with the Sony
10079540	10084660	conference. Um, so we'll get into that at some point. Um, and yeah, we'll be back in seven days
10084660	10090820	to do it again. Um, Oh, and also a shout out for Twitch and, uh, everybody that, um, subbed gave
10090820	10094740	bits, uh, all that good stuff tonight. Thank you. Thank you so much for all that. Um, I'll,
10094740	10099220	I'll read you guys out after the show here in a minute. Um, but I also want to say those,
10099220	10104100	you guys that host us and I'm really bummed Twitch doesn't show us a list of who is hosting
10104100	10108420	us. So I can't thank you individually, but, um, just know that I really appreciate it. I know
10108420	10114100	some people do. And, uh, those auto hosts on Twitch go a long way in helping to, uh, show
10114100	10120500	that we're live to more people. So I really, really appreciate that stuff. So, um, yeah. Uh,
10120500	10125460	that is going to do it for another episode of orange lounge radio. Uh, let's get final
10125460	10130740	thoughts for tonight. Uh, Loki, you have any final thoughts tonight? Um, I was going to say
10130740	10136020	like they have replacement LCD panels that you can get, but they're super expensive if you want them
10136020	10142660	like the old CRTs, the four by three ones. Um, so aside from the arcade cabinet stuff, uh,
10142660	10147460	still gonna be working on them on games. So maybe I'll play some more stuff this week.
10147460	10155780	Not even a hint. No. All right. Um, so are there any games that are on your radar to try to get
10155780	10162980	to this week? Um, I'll probably play, I haven't played super Mario sunshine. So when I get the
10162980	10169300	3d collection, I'll have to try that out. Um, I don't know. Like I've got a lot of things I
10169300	10175380	need to play. I may play more hotshot racing. Um, yeah, I don't know. I need to stream some more.
10178420	10186020	All right. Um, and then my final thought for tonight is, um, I'm excited to get all my
10186020	10192260	crafting jobs in, uh, final fantasy to 60, which is probably going to happen. If not tonight,
10192260	10198100	then I'll probably happen tomorrow. Um, and then, um, I I'm looking forward to playing more of, uh,
10198100	10203300	Avicii and some of the other, uh, games out there in my backlog. I have a lot, I still want to go
10203380	10209060	back and play more no man's sky. I want to play that fricking. Um, I see VG realness Delvin
10209060	10213540	playing this all the time on his channel spell break. So what it's called the, the Fortnite with
10213540	10222180	magicians. I've yeah, I watched. Okay. So earlier in the week, I there's, um, I'm sure a lot of you
10222180	10227060	are familiar with the oral knots. They do a bunch of like funny, like star Wars videos and stuff
10227060	10233300	like that. Um, so they have this character that they do creepy. Oh, that's like a C3 PO,
10233300	10237940	but it's pretty funny. Um, so they had their character creepy out playing that game and it
10237940	10245300	looked interesting. Um, definitely a game I I'd like maybe to check out, but, uh, their stream
10245300	10251140	is pretty funny. I didn't know they actually streamed stuff. So it was pretty cool. All right.
10251140	10255700	Well, we're going to, uh, roll credits and be done here for another episode of orange launch radio.
10255700	10259940	Thanks again as always for listening to show tonight. Really appreciate it. We will be back
10259940	10264580	here to do it all again next week in seven days. Have a good night, everybody. See you next time.
