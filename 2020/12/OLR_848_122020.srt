1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,560
Music games are at a pivot as Rock Band was made compatible in Generation 8, but as of

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,840
yet there's been no big news for Generation 9.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,920
Meanwhile Konami continues to bring the Bomani Suite to PC with five game releases now available

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,280
in Japan.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,200
Music licensing makes releases in the West difficult, but a quick shout out to Taiko

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,680
no Tachi-Gen, Groove Coaster, Project Diva, and Kingdom Hearts, Melody of Memory all on

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,680
the Switch.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,040
This is the 32nd Music Game Update, it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers,

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,000
and Loki with more of this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,120
on the show where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:44,640
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to the weekly show where every

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,920
gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio Live.

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:57,000
Once again tonight for episode number 848, December the 20th of 2020.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,680
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here live every week, I think we may have Dark

15
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08,200
Sakura or Jamie Summers who is having tech difficulties for the show, is she there?

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,760
Okay she's still not with us, but hopefully will be joining us at some point throughout

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:16,480
the show, she was having some problems with her computer beforehand, so I think she was

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,080
trying to reboot or connect from another device or something like that.

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,640
So hopefully we'll be hearing from her shortly, but I know joining us tonight, because I can

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,840
see him on cam, is Techmaster Loki.

21
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,840
Hello.

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,040
Hi Loki, how are you?

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,040
I'm doing good.

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,240
Good, and I see that you're wearing your new OLR shirt that's available at the VoG Network

25
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,240
Shop, plug plug.

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,240
Yes I am.

27
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,040
Yeah, how is it?

28
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,520
It's comfortable.

29
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,840
It's wonderful, it's premium quality, I love it.

30
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,720
If it's not the greatest, I'm gonna be honest, I did not care for the mask with the logo

31
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,200
in the corner, because what happens is that the folding of the mask kind of makes the

32
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,760
logo disappear, so yeah.

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,100
But you can still get it if you want, otherwise it's a quality mask.

34
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,880
We have a different mask that's got like VoG super big on it, so that works too.

35
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,280
But all that available, the shirts are great, I actually, Loki's got the OLR shirt, I have

36
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,640
the VoG Network shirts, and they turned out really good, so quality products over at the

37
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,640
shop.

38
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,080
VoGnetwork.com slash shop, if you want to check that out, ooh, hi, hi DarkSakura, we

39
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,680
hear you, do you hear us?

40
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,320
Okay, she doesn't, this is gonna be very awkward, this is gonna be like the most awkward Zoom

41
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:41,000
holiday thing tonight, anyway, hi, we hear you DarkSakura, loud and clear, can you hear

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
us?

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Okay.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,400
I think that is a no.

45
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,640
She doesn't even know she's coming through on the show.

46
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,880
She's just trying to stress the importance of COVID testing, and you know, we should

47
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:01,560
all be vigilant, especially considering the situation.

48
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,800
I'm texting her right now that we heard you, you just can't hear us, that's right, you're

49
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,580
right, she's stressing the importance of making sure that you get tested, see, testing is

50
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:19,980
so important, COVID testing, exactly, oh, her camp's coming on, so hopefully at some

51
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:27,200
point she'll be able to see and hear us, all right, anyway, Loki, what's the game playing

52
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
behind you tonight?

53
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,820
I'm trying to figure it out, it looks like a 3D King's Quest sort of thing, what is that

54
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,900
playing behind you tonight?

55
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,220
It's visceral cleanup detail, Santa's rampage.

56
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,900
I have not heard of that.

57
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,780
Do you remember visceral cleanup detail is basically, it was you're coming in after like,

58
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:55,300
like a shmup, like an FPS, like shooter, and you're cleaning up all the bodies and blood

59
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,180
and bullets and stuff that are left behind, so that's the premise of the game.

60
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,180
Interesting.

61
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,140
So in this case, you are cleaning up after Santa's rampage through his workshop.

62
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,140
Is this an itch.io game?

63
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,180
This sounds kind of funny, I like that.

64
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:13,820
I think it is on itch.io, but it's definitely on Steam, it's been in a few humble bundles,

65
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,300
so that's where I got it from.

66
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,300
Love it.

67
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,660
I'm also, what was cracking me up too is that when Dark Soccer's cam came on, the room was

68
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:27,140
completely empty, like it's like, what the hell's going on, we were getting ghost Jamie

69
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:32,660
for a minute there, that's what they're saying in chat, over at our chat, can Jamie hear

70
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,660
us now?

71
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,380
I don't know if she can.

72
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:41,220
Okay, so it's still, you gotta love it.

73
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,580
All right, I will give our chat room a plug over at twitch.tv slash vog network because

74
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,520
we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right

75
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,340
after the Bobby Black Wolf show, again, twitch.tv slash vog network, six o'clock Pacific, nine

76
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,340
o'clock Eastern.

77
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,420
Some comments coming in, Quest Buster says the shirt does look comfy, and if we were

78
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:04,180
in Cyberpunk, that shirt just added 180 points of armor.

79
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,940
Yes.

80
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,860
No One Special 77 is talking about, I have the Steam version of that game, the visceral

81
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,740
cleaning, is that what it's called?

82
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:20,940
Yeah, visceral cleanup detail, I think, or duty, yeah, I've played it before, I didn't

83
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:27,580
really know what to do in it, but having watched this video, I kind of have an idea of what

84
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,740
you're supposed to do.

85
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,620
It just, it was hard, it's a very tedious game because you have to mop stuff and you

86
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:40,260
have to move stuff around, but it's silly, a lot of people speed run it, so it's fun.

87
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,500
Is it part of, because I know Bobby was just doing a cheap plug for Awesome Games Done

88
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,260
Quick, it's coming up in just two weeks, where did the time go?

89
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,420
I didn't realize it was only two weeks away, but it's just, I guess it's one of those things,

90
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,780
2020, is this one of the games they're going to be doing?

91
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,580
I know they've done it in the past, I don't know if they were doing it this time, but

92
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:04,020
yeah, because originally I had actually picked Christmas Nights, but I thought that was kind

93
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:09,940
of obvious, and I think I've done that, we've done that in the past, but I wanted to mix

94
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,500
it up a bit, so that's why I was like, oh yeah, there's that game, and I have to remember

95
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:20,420
what the name was, so yeah, let me see if they have it in there, I don't know if it's

96
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,420
probably being done this year, but I know they have done in the past because I've watched

97
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,940
it and some of the crazy stuff they do with that.

98
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,940
Nice.

99
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,140
I think we may have had a breakthrough on the Dark Soccer tech situation, are you with

100
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,140
us now, Jamie?

101
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,780
I am, can you hear me?

102
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,500
You did it, yes, we hear you, all is well, hello.

103
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,900
My headset kind of took a dive and then my computer was having some problems booting

104
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:49,380
it up, so I finally just said fuck it, and set up my new mic.

105
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:54,020
Well it looks nice, you got your whole little pop guard and a little professional mic over

106
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,020
there, it looks nice.

107
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:02,140
It's one of those Audio-Technica ones, rather than like 200 and something bucks, I actually

108
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,580
had a really good deal and got it for 110, so why not?

109
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,700
Well the chat is saying you're a little quieter than usual, so you might just have to work

110
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,540
with the positioning and things like that, maybe get the, uh oh, get the...

111
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,380
Actually I think you have, it could be mixer settings on, perhaps on your side, because

112
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,260
I haven't found a way to increase the sensitivity over on my side.

113
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,700
No, because you guys are filtered through Discord, so if I change anything, it's you

114
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,100
and Loki.

115
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:30,060
My mic setup is for 100%, so I'll see if I've got something else that I can adjust.

116
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,780
Oh yeah, actually, you know what, I can always bump you up in Discord, but when you got close

117
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,620
to the mic there, I think you were good.

118
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,180
Don't you love live tech support?

119
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,180
Alright.

120
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,900
Well, that and my pop filter will not stay where the hell I put it.

121
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,900
It's fine.

122
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,900
Is this any better?

123
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,900
It is to me.

124
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:50,140
Chat, if she's too quiet, let me know, because I can always boost or deafen, I can use Discord

125
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,540
as a mixer too, if I need to.

126
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,100
I think I have the AT2020.

127
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,700
One of my friends recommended it to me, and so that's what I'm using, and I really like

128
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:07,420
their audio output, and so I decided to go for it.

129
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,420
You sound really good to me.

130
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,420
Does this sound any different than my old mic?

131
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,040
You sound a lot better.

132
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,900
It's a lot clearer, and I can hear it fine in my headset, for what it's worth, so I think

133
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,900
you're good.

134
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,700
So tech issues aside, before we get into the big gaming story this week, because of course

135
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,580
we are a video game podcast, and there's a lot of gaming news about one particular

136
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,540
game, and I know it's a game that's not really on your radar, Dark Soccer, and it's not really

137
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,540
on mine.

138
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:34,060
Why the fuck would I play something broken?

139
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,220
This is going to be a Loki segment coming up.

140
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,620
Skyrim is a great game.

141
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,620
True.

142
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:47,460
Let me just ask quickly, I know Hanukkah just finished up, so happy belated Hanukkah I suppose

143
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:54,240
at this point, but I will say I will miss our annual Christmas gathering, because you

144
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,980
and I historically have always gone out for Chinese food or pho, or whatever we can find

145
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:06,940
that's open on Christmas, and we don't get to do that this year because of the situation.

146
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,620
So I'll miss that this year.

147
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,460
Totally, actually.

148
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,020
I had a negative test.

149
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,400
Oh, congrats.

150
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,880
If y'all had negative tests, we can get some damn takeout.

151
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
Maybe we'll see.

152
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,880
We'll see.

153
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,240
We can always eat outdoors or something if it's not too cold.

154
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Do something like that.

155
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
Okay.

156
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,240
It'll be fun.

157
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,240
It's cold.

158
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
All right.

159
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
It is a little cold.

160
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
All right.

161
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
Let's get into video game stuff, though.

162
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,380
Huge, big news this week.

163
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,440
This is kind of shocking, honestly.

164
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,800
And I think y'all know where this is going to go with Cyberpunk.

165
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,540
Let's let Loki kick this off and state the obvious that is in the back of all your minds

166
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,700
with this.

167
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,580
So Cyberpunk's a little bit rough.

168
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:59,280
So especially on the earlier gen consoles, so like a PlayStation 4 and Xbox One hasn't

169
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,520
been running the best.

170
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,520
And that was something that's been kind of...

171
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,760
You're very nice.

172
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,620
You're very nice.

173
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,900
It looks like Saints Row.

174
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:17,140
In fact, it's getting a lot of that Saints Row vibe from it.

175
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,860
But yeah, so it hasn't been running good at all.

176
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,180
And so they've actually come out.

177
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:29,360
CG Prodigy Red has come out and actually apologized with their wonderful yellow text

178
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,860
or yellow background text where they've said, first off, we would like to start by apologizing

179
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:42,100
to you for not showing the game on the base of the last gen consoles before it premiered.

180
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,060
And in consequence, we're not allowing you to make more informed decisions about your

181
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,060
purchase.

182
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:52,500
We should have paid more attention to making it play better on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

183
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Right.

184
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,440
But you knew.

185
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,900
And you also were advertising it in such a way.

186
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:04,900
And you were also preventing people from being able to review it and showcasing that stuff

187
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,940
as well.

188
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:13,860
So yeah, it's a little hard to feel like that's a genuine apology, but whatever.

189
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,700
I'm going to interject because we got a lot to unpack just in that two minutes, okay?

190
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,780
We got a lot to unpack.

191
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,220
So let's get our emotional baggage out here for a minute.

192
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,220
Here's the thing.

193
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,540
And I think this is important to state.

194
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,660
For a lot of people, the game isn't broken.

195
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,180
And I think that's important to put.

196
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,020
It may be kind of broken, but in a Bethesda game way, or as you said, like a Saints Row,

197
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:39,020
like there are character and Bobby showed examples of some of this on his show earlier

198
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,400
because he used his clipping feature to show some of this stuff.

199
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,580
For instance, characters that just walk right through lockers like they're not even there.

200
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,580
Characters that run over street poles because fuck street poles and things like that.

201
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,860
There's a lot of that stuff that's buggy, but otherwise the game is fine.

202
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:02,420
If you are on a high-end PC, you're playing on Google Stadia, you're playing on Xbox Series X,

203
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:09,020
you're playing on PlayStation 5, where we're running into some real tragedies are some

204
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,460
people that are playing on PlayStation 4 and that are playing on Xbox One.

205
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,980
Now, I do think it is important to make that distinction because I think there are a lot

206
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,340
of people out there that are like, what's the problem?

207
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:26,740
Well, the problem is that the game is not running the way people expected it to run

208
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,260
for a game that was advertised for the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One.

209
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:34,340
Here's where the problem gets really fucking complicated.

210
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:39,100
So, Loki, that part you said there, they put out a yellow statement and all this thing

211
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,740
and said, we should have realized that the game wasn't running up to speed or whatever

212
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,860
it was on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

213
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,980
Did I state that correctly?

214
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,460
Is kind of what their line was?

215
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,060
Yeah, yeah.

216
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,340
You fucking knew.

217
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,580
You fucking knew.

218
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:00,100
And not only did they fucking know, they suppressed.

219
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,820
And how did they suppress?

220
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:06,660
When they sent out all these review copies, they told people, you have to play it on a high-end PC.

221
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,620
They didn't give out any review codes for PlayStation or Microsoft.

222
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:19,540
And they put out an NDA that said, you cannot show footage from this game.

223
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,260
You must use our approved footage.

224
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,060
And that should have been the first sign that something was up.

225
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:32,460
Now, I think most of us kind of went, oh, it's because of this whole Day Zero patch they're doing.

226
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,980
There's something really bad in the pre-patch stuff that they don't want out there.

227
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,780
So they want to make sure that what's being shown is a patched version.

228
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,980
I think that's what most of us wrote off that NDA as.

229
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,500
But now we're seeing there was something way more sinister going on here.

230
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:53,820
And what CD Projekt Red was really trying to avoid was the reception that Mass Effect Andromeda got.

231
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:59,100
And I know I'm invoking the Holy Series of Mass Effect here, but I'm doing it for a reason.

232
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,340
Why did that game get shit on?

233
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,140
And I mean shit on just days before it released.

234
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:12,460
Because EA stupidly put that buggy game out on that advance thing through EA.

235
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:23,260
And all these people were ripping their own footage of heads spinning round, bodies flopping on the floor and all these things that made Andromeda look like a buggy ass mess.

236
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,500
So everybody was like, I'm not buying that fucking game.

237
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:32,140
Dark Sakura, I will ask your opinion here because you you follow the holy book of Mass Effect like I do.

238
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:37,460
Isn't that kind of how Mass Effect Andromeda got screwed?

239
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,380
You're muted just so you know, it's a hard mute on Discord.

240
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:47,700
Um, kind of sort of because I don't think Mass Effect Andromeda had nearly the problems that Cyberpunk does.

241
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:58,740
I agree. I actually I definitely agree with that statement, but it's actually a pretty it was actually a pretty finished game.

242
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:04,740
It was lacking like a few touches, like the whole dead eyes thing and some of the dialogue choices.

243
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:10,140
But for the most part, it wasn't super buggy, but the Internet fixated on those bugs.

244
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,380
Right. And so the games there weren't many.

245
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:18,540
Right. But Cyberpunk has plenty even on the high end.

246
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:22,420
Right. And that's what CD Projekt Red was trying to hide.

247
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:28,540
And that's my point is that those few bugs, when they got out, really tanked Mass Effect Andromeda's performance.

248
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:38,460
You really I really can't be convinced that didn't impact the bottom line of of Andromeda and how it sold because of how people responded to that whole thing.

249
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:45,060
I think there were other factors in there, just simply the fact that Bioware was putting more into Anthem at the time,

250
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:53,700
and it wasn't continuing with everybody's favorite characters or their storylines, unlike what Dragon Age four is doing.

251
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:59,940
So I think that might have been more part of it than just the aesthetics of it.

252
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,940
Or, you know, it was it was all like too much, too new.

253
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,300
And then on top of that, adding in just those minor things.

254
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,460
Right. So on that on that, we agree.

255
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,300
But I had something different going for it.

256
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:18,900
Right. And I think we definitely have some common ground here because, yeah, no, I agree with you that Cyberpunk and I haven't played it.

257
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,060
So that's why I feel a little bit hesitant to say something definitively here.

258
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:27,060
But everything that I'm seeing online, all the reaction stuff is that it is a bug year game.

259
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,700
And I do think so I agree with you on that, too.

260
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:40,460
And I think the reason why I invoked Mass Effect Andromeda and the reception that it got with those bugs is that that was the situation CD Projekt Red was trying to avoid by saying you can't take your own video.

261
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,180
You have to show this pre-approved video.

262
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:49,900
You're not going to play it on PlayStation four and Xbox one because we know somebody knows this game doesn't run nearly as well on those platforms.

263
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:56,860
So we are going to try to continue this hype for this game going and not shoot it in the foot.

264
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:04,380
Like I think has been done in the past with other products when they released, you know, early for everybody to look at and then the warts and all kind of show up.

265
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:11,580
And I think it caused this situation now to get worse because they tried to suppress that message.

266
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,420
And it's the truth.

267
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,580
It always comes out, girl.

268
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,380
It always comes out.

269
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,060
That should have been the first clue.

270
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:25,620
I mean, the whole point of a review is honesty, I think it is.

271
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,660
I mean, to the developers, it's the.

272
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:42,180
OK, we want to sell our game and we want it to look a certain way, but the true heart of what a review is, is to say this is what product you are buying.

273
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:46,820
So there's a difference between a review and a sponsorship.

274
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,420
And they were looking for a sponsorship.

275
00:17:48,420 --> 00:18:03,460
Yes, and it's interesting because there was a piece I was reading out there that was being critical of organizations that ran the review with the NDA, calling them corporate sellouts and things like this that I don't agree with that strong of a message.

276
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:08,460
I kind of think most of these review outlets gave you the tools you needed to figure it out for yourself.

277
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:14,460
They were transparent in saying there was an NDA and that there was, you know, they couldn't show actual footage from the game.

278
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:23,500
We assumed and I'll say we as part of that, too, because I remember saying it on the show that, oh, it's because of the day zero patch and they don't want to show like how bad it is.

279
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,260
Little did we know it's much worse.

280
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,140
I don't think the problem for that is with the journalists at all.

281
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:44,420
That problem. And so I think I think people who are writing pieces like that, in my opinion, and you're not going to like this, but in my opinion, you got yourself to blame for setting up that kind of industry that requires day zero reviews.

282
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:51,380
That, you know, feeds on Metacritic scores and my game is better than your game.

283
00:18:51,380 --> 00:19:04,380
And I think that's on you, person that writes that piece about how all of that is bad for creating that type of gaming industry that CD Projekt Red was just playing into.

284
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:19,260
I'm not I'm not letting CD Projekt Red off the hook because I think ultimately at the end of the day, the only satisfactory end to this, the only satisfactory end to this is that the CEOs of CD Projekt Red are finished.

285
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,180
They retire. That's they knew this was going on.

286
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,820
They let the hype keep going.

287
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,380
They put all these constraints on it as it was.

288
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,020
They've got to go, period.

289
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,700
Not gonna though. I mean, think about it.

290
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,980
I, I, I don't dark soccer.

291
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,820
I totally get the pessimistic perspective.

292
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:46,100
I think the investors in Poland, because they are a publicly traded company in Poland, I think the investors are so pissed off.

293
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,260
And at the end of the day, video games are making money.

294
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:57,780
I think the investors are so pissed off about this whole situation that it is now I think it's on the table and good.

295
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,060
It should be on the table.

296
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,940
In my opinion, yeah, this is this sorry, sorry, Loki, I will let you finish.

297
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:08,500
I know there's more to say, I was gonna say this is not the fault of the developers.

298
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,500
This is not the fault of the artist.

299
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:20,420
This is not the fault of the people that were working their asses off on crunch time to try to deliver this game that was promised.

300
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:30,900
This was a fuck up of epic proportions by management, period.

301
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:40,980
And to kind of go along with that also, there is a story out of Bloomberg that is actually talking about the developers asking the leadership, you know, what was going on?

302
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:50,380
You know, basically saying that developers ask blunt questions about the company's reputation, the game's unrealistic deadlines and the relentless overtime in the months and years leading up to the game.

303
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,540
December 10th release.

304
00:20:54,580 --> 00:21:05,660
So, you know, I don't know, it almost feels like like I get that I think releasing on so many platforms all at once was kind of a problem.

305
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:19,780
And I know other consoles, games have done similar things where they've postponed certain versions of it, like say, for example, you know, PC pretty solid right now, maybe release on PC and delay the console a month.

306
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,700
Would have been smart.

307
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,620
Here's what would have been smart.

308
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,380
Sorry, Loki. Here's what would have been smart.

309
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,220
CD Projekt Red should have went to Google.

310
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,100
The minute they knew this was going on, they should have went to Google instead.

311
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:36,980
What if we made you an offer to be exclusive on Stadia and PC for six months?

312
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:43,180
What if we made you that offer and then get the money from Google to go exclusive on Stadia?

313
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:58,820
Because the game's fine on Stadia outside of the bugs, which is which is a whole other episode of OLR about here we are now that like Stadia has got its best use case scenario by a complete use case, by a complete fuck up of another organization.

314
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,420
Right.

315
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,660
Go ahead, Jamie, you've been trying to get away.

316
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:21,340
I was going to make a point just a little bit before, but and actually, it also said it in chat is that this is a big reason why there needs to be unionization for our developers and for people who work in the gaming industry.

317
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,460
Yes, 100 percent agree.

318
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:31,260
This unions would have helped here, I think, quite a bit, especially when it came to the crunch time and things of that sort.

319
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:31,980
Absolutely.

320
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:37,660
So just be mindful, Jamie, if you're talking sideways on the mike, it doesn't pick up quite as much as when you're talking direct.

321
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,220
Sorry.

322
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,100
The chat, you can probably used to it.

323
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,700
You can also probably just drop the pop guard if it's getting in the way.

324
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,260
Oh, there you go.

325
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,940
There we go, because I don't want to, you know, spew on everybody.

326
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,860
So, yeah.

327
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:49,820
All right.

328
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,660
So Jamie's just got to get used to it.

329
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,340
You guys in chat.

330
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,260
She's got a whole new set.

331
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,500
She's not using a headset anymore.

332
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,700
She's using an adult microphone, just like the ones we had here.

333
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:58,940
It's true.

334
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,380
Oh, my gosh.

335
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,740
OK, Loki, I'm sorry.

336
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,860
We keep cutting you off, but this is a very passionate topic, isn't it?

337
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,260
Sure.

338
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:18,780
So aside from, you know, the obvious problems with the leadership, you know, some more stuff talking about like crunch, you know, they were being forced to work six hour day or I'm sorry, six days a week.

339
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:28,740
And even more so after the games, you know, final delay, they were having even more crunch involved with that as well.

340
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:38,020
And then, of course, we get word, you know, about them offering to refund the game if you're unhappy with your purchase.

341
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:45,740
So they set up a email address that is open until, well, tomorrow, they're shutting it off.

342
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:59,820
And also, apparently, you know, with that, because there were so many refunds being issued on the like PlayStation Store, Sony straight up pulled the game from the PlayStation Store.

343
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:06,500
You can't buy it digitally anymore for right now until they sort this stuff out.

344
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,940
So they went ahead and pulled it out.

345
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,980
They said SIE strives to ensure a high level of customer satisfaction.

346
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:19,820
Therefore, we will begin to offer full refunds for all the gamers who have purchased Cyberpunk 2077 via the PlayStation Store.

347
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:26,180
And we will also be removing Cyberpunk 2077 from the PlayStation Store until further notice.

348
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:35,060
It says once we have confirmed you have purchased Cyberpunk 2077 via PlayStation Store, we will process your begin processing your refund.

349
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:42,700
And then, of course, along with that, later on, Xbox also followed suit.

350
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,380
They brought or took it down off their storefront.

351
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:58,060
Best Buy has said basically they're going to offer refunds on the physical copies via their in store by mail through December 21st, which apparently is when there's some sort of patch coming out.

352
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,540
That's why it all seems to end on December 21st.

353
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,620
And then. What else?

354
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:17,420
So we also had a seizure product read saying that they are going to be offering some sort of refunds as well for players who are unable to secure one through the store which they purchased it.

355
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,460
So that'll be limited as well.

356
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:35,140
Also, apparently, the execs came out and apologized again as well, saying that they had ignored signals that the console versions that they hyped were in rough shape.

357
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:46,140
The game launched way below expectations and they ignored the signals that more time was needed to make sure that the games are ready.

358
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,940
It was the wrong approach and against our business philosophy.

359
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:54,740
On top of that, during the campaign, we showed the game mostly on PC.

360
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:59,540
We definitely did not spend enough time looking at PlayStation 4 and Xbox One performance.

361
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:05,580
And this is coming from the vice president, Michael Nowakowski.

362
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:14,420
And the reason we didn't show the game of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is that we were updating the game on last gen consoles until the very last minute.

363
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,460
And we thought we'd make it in time.

364
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:23,660
Unfortunately, this resulted in giving it to reviewers just one day before the release, which is definitely too late.

365
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,660
And the media didn't get the chance to review it properly.

366
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:34,260
Are we are they really blaming the reviewers for the low scores on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One?

367
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,900
Because that's what sort of sounds like.

368
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,980
They said that was not intended.

369
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,820
We were just fixing the game up until the very last moment.

370
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:47,780
And yeah, let me get some comments from chat here.

371
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:58,140
Number one, and most importantly, the chat room is going bananas for Midna, which I think might be our first Dark Soccer's cat, Midna, showing up on stream during the show.

372
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:04,180
But there's Midna in mommy's arms there getting some cuddles.

373
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:12,460
Some other comments in chat talking about, even though Cyberpunk is no longer being sold on Sony Store, it is continuing to be sold on the Microsoft Store.

374
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:19,260
And I've actually seen that myself, because in the rewards app, actually, you get a thing for visiting the Cyberpunk page.

375
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:26,060
And there's a big old thing on there that says note may not currently run best on Xbox One.

376
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,180
Like there's a big old like disclaimer on there.

377
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,420
Hard to miss right now.

378
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,660
I guess they're just doing refunds.

379
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:41,300
I thought they were taking some funny thing that I did see online was folks complaining about the fact that if they did a refund that they still couldn't play the game.

380
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,980
It's like, what do you think a refund is?

381
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,260
You know, it's a game for free.

382
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,420
That is that is that is what a refund is.

383
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,140
You no longer have access to the product.

384
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,460
Stop trying to game the system.

385
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,740
That's not what it's worth.

386
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:59,980
Yeah. So and Bobby Black Wolf in chat saying you can still buy the PlayStation 4 disc version.

387
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,300
They thought it was a refund, but not a return.

388
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,980
So, yeah, like don't game the system, guys.

389
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,540
If you're playing the game and enjoying the game, the refund's not for you.

390
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,500
So knock it off.

391
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:19,180
But obviously, there's some people the part about that that gets me is that email that they're shutting off tomorrow.

392
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:27,180
How convenient when copies of this game are going to be showing up under the tree for many people in four or five days.

393
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,100
So that's kind of shady.

394
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,420
Another bad decision among bad decisions, but it is what it is.

395
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:41,500
Honestly, like I get I get people are unhappy with it, but like I think it will get better.

396
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:46,460
I am hoping that it at least it's got at least it's not a live service game.

397
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,100
So it's got that going for it.

398
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,620
So I think it will get better.

399
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:55,620
I'm hoping it will end up like a no man's sky where eventually it gets patched.

400
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,580
It it really should not have been released this way.

401
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:04,340
And it's it's frustrating to hear like almost every single major game release out there.

402
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:10,140
Now we run into the same thing at launch, some cases much worse than others.

403
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,420
But it's always like patching after the fact, releasing buggy games.

404
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:18,460
It's like, do we not finish a game before releasing it?

405
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,380
It doesn't make any sense.

406
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,620
Maybe the shock and awe of this situation.

407
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,780
And if the CEOs do get ousted by the board, which again, I hope it happens.

408
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,580
I really do.

409
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,780
I got my popcorn ready to go.

410
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,100
But what I don't want to happen is I don't want the studio to go under.

411
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,220
I do not want job loss at that studio.

412
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,740
I do not want the developers to suffer the consequences and the artists and those that that

413
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,260
is what I do not want to happen.

414
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,420
This the cuts need to be made at the top.

415
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,700
That is what has to happen in this situation.

416
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:56,020
And I hope that other companies see this situation and go, oh, you know, maybe you're

417
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:01,140
right, learn something from this and make sure this doesn't happen to future releases.

418
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,300
Now, I will say this, Loki, when you we talk about the game being in a better state and

419
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:09,340
everything again for me, when I do decide to get the game, when that, you know, game of

420
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:14,100
the year edition with all the DLC and all that included, when I finally do buy it, Xbox

421
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:18,980
Series X and PlayStation 5 will be the full on current generation by that point, because

422
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:23,140
we'll be in two years in and the game runs fine on those.

423
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:28,460
Well, so consider this, too, though, like the one version that you're playing right now on

424
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:35,940
the Xbox Series X or whatever is just the Xbox one version that has some additional Xbox

425
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,180
Series X enhancements.

426
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:41,740
It's not the actual Xbox Series X or PlayStation five versions.

427
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,780
Those are supposed to be coming out in March.

428
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,100
So the game will be even better by March.

429
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:53,660
It's just that if I think they were still trying to tune those for that additional, like

430
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:57,620
compatibility with those new systems, but they forgot, it's like, oh, yeah, you know, you

431
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:04,940
also have the base Xbox one, you know, or the Xbox one s, you know, the old stuff that

432
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,300
might not run it as well.

433
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:14,940
And it's we kind of saw this, you know, even way before the days of patching stuff, like we

434
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,140
saw some games that would be released between these consoles, you know, back on like

435
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:25,500
PlayStation two and PlayStation three and then Xbox 360 and like Xbox and all these

436
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:30,300
different consoles, like releasing a nine different consoles, you know, and obviously

437
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:35,020
some versions of the game would be good and some versions of the game would be very rough.

438
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:39,540
Well, I remember a day when like Mortal Kombat came out on the Game Boy.

439
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,620
And if you bought the Game Boy version of Mortal Kombat, you knew you were not going to

440
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:49,500
get the same game that the people on the Super Nintendo like you knew, but they also

441
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,540
didn't try to hide that.

442
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,140
They didn't try to hide it either.

443
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:58,820
You would see Game Boy screenshots in magazines and go, oh, that's a that's a scaled back

444
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,780
version of that game.

445
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,660
Right. And try to hide it.

446
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,260
That's a huge, huge difference.

447
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,220
I want to point out something in chat as well.

448
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,780
Zen Monkey in chat says it's the full game, right?

449
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,300
Nothing is missing. It's just buggy.

450
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,340
So it's not a no man's sky, in my opinion.

451
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,500
I agree with that.

452
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,660
A lot of comparisons to No Man's Sky.

453
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,620
I think these are hugely different scenarios.

454
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:22,620
Now, I'm not just saying that because, yes, I'm a fanboy of No Man's Sky now.

455
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:27,860
But I remember when that game came out, the problem with that game was not that it was a

456
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:32,900
buggy, unplayable mess or that, you know, the problem in that game was that the hype

457
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,220
machine got out of control.

458
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,300
And it's what I'm calling the Molyneux effect.

459
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:44,260
OK, it's the the Peter Molyneux effect, meaning I hyped the shit out of something I

460
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,180
couldn't really deliver on.

461
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:53,820
It didn't necessarily make the game bad fable, but the game was not exactly what we had

462
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,300
promised. In fact, in many ways, it wasn't what we promised.

463
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,460
But I remember when that came out, I remember go back to the episode when that game came

464
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,860
out and I reviewed it and I said, it's not that bad.

465
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:09,940
It's a little bit dry, but I think I enjoy this game more than most because I always

466
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,340
questioned those speeches that they were giving when they were showing off the game.

467
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,900
And I always was the one going, where's the game?

468
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,780
What's the game? And I refused to buy into the hype with that game.

469
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,820
Therefore, when the game came out, I was like, it's OK.

470
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:26,180
And now we're in a spot years and years later where the game is better than OK.

471
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:30,460
In fact, I would say it's a must play if you haven't played it yet, especially when it

472
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:35,220
comes to Series X and PlayStation 5, assuming they ever fix that HDR thing.

473
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,380
But Series X, for sure, it's a must play at this point.

474
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,820
I think it's a very different sort of thing.

475
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:48,700
But I'm not saying, oh, it wasn't a problem at all.

476
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,260
No, it was a problem. It was a different problem.

477
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:58,980
And I'm not even sure this CD Projekt RED, pardon me, Cyberpunk thing is as big of an

478
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,700
issue as one other game I can think of.

479
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:04,060
Actually, can I mention real quick, I know we want to get to other stories tonight.

480
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,420
We don't want the show to run too long.

481
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:10,020
I ran an informal poll on my Twitter account about this whole thing.

482
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,420
So did you see my poll?

483
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,620
Did you guys vote in my poll?

484
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,500
OK, I did not see your poll.

485
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,940
OK, here's the question I asked.

486
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:22,100
Is Cyberpunk and Tigerclaw will find the link and post the poll because he usually

487
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,140
does so I'm not putting them on the spot or anything.

488
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,740
OK, here's the tweet I wrote.

489
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:32,420
It said, is Cyberpunk 2077 the biggest failure of an organization's management and

490
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,180
executives in video game history?

491
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,420
And believe it or not, one hundred and seven people voted in my poll.

492
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,020
So this is very scientific, you guys.

493
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,900
Fifty three percent.

494
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,340
Your question was quite loaded.

495
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,380
Maybe. Well, here's the answer.

496
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,660
Fifty three percent said yes.

497
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,340
Forty seven percent said stop being dramatic.

498
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:55,100
So there's people that do think it's pretty.

499
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,660
Now, looking back and when I wrote that question, obviously it was very tongue in

500
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,020
cheek. It was a tweet, you guys.

501
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,100
It wasn't a scientific poll.

502
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:12,900
I actually think Final Fantasy 14 1.0 was a bigger fuck up that was so bad, so bad that

503
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:18,140
it almost killed an entire franchise dating back to like 1987.

504
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:23,900
But there's there are things about this cyberpunk scenario that make it quite

505
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:30,060
unique. And the good news is in Final Fantasy 14, they were able to fix it years

506
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:34,980
after the fact. But the Final Fantasy 14 now is like not even the same game it was

507
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,380
when it came out. That's how they fixed it.

508
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:39,380
They just released a new game called Final Fantasy 14 that had some of the same

509
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,540
ideas. So.

510
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:47,580
So, Loki, now that you know the question, is this the biggest management fuck up and

511
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,940
specifically management, is this the biggest management fuck up of no time of all

512
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,620
time? Yes. Or stop being dramatic?

513
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,420
Stop being dramatic.

514
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,940
This isn't that. It could be worse.

515
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:05,620
I mean, how like was it last year with WWE, their 2K game?

516
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,140
I mean, that's pretty bad.

517
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:12,620
And then on top of that, you know, they also want to charge for microtransactions.

518
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,420
I mean, geez, it's like.

519
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:21,460
Every few months we have one of these, so I don't think it's the worst anthem.

520
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:26,180
I mean, Fallout 76, anyone?

521
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,300
I mean, there's so many, so many to choose from.

522
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:38,020
And yeah, looking looking back on it, I'm not sure it would be the biggest ever, but

523
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,180
I think it's going to be one of the most memorable.

524
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,700
I think Fallout 76 tops it.

525
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,980
I mean, like that is just.

526
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,500
How ironic. Look at my shirt I'm wearing.

527
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,700
Do you see the shirt I'm wearing today?

528
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,780
One mistake after another.

529
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,900
I mean, it's like over and over and over again.

530
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,540
And it's just like they can't do anything right.

531
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,420
Anything like it was just all sorts of messed up.

532
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,180
I don't know what the state is now.

533
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,420
I'm assuming since I haven't heard about it in a while, it's slightly better.

534
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,340
But like it was just all over the place.

535
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:12,460
OK, of course, some comments and chat coming in on this.

536
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:15,060
No one special says the virtual boy says hi.

537
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:19,340
Let's see, S2100 Matt says this is an E.T.

538
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,780
on the Atari that folks are treating this like.

539
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,340
That is a great.

540
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:28,060
You know what? I'm going to give a gold star chat comment of the week to that comment.

541
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,500
I didn't even think of that.

542
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:34,940
But that is also a brilliant example of how management fucked a game, because I know that

543
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:39,500
Howard Scott Warshaw, who authored that game, worked his fucking ass off to deliver it in

544
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:44,780
six weeks, because that's what management made him do, because that was the deal that

545
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,420
was reached with Steven Spielberg and all that to get the game out for Christmas and

546
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,220
all of that stuff.

547
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:53,740
So I think you gave a real damn good example of something that's almost a bigger

548
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:58,340
management fuck up because and then that game caused the video game crash of 1983.

549
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:04,460
OK, maybe not directly, but things like that decision definitely caused the entire

550
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,980
industry to kablamo.

551
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,620
So let me let me offer something.

552
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,220
This is going back to a previous point.

553
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,060
Last comment on this and then we'll move on.

554
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:16,780
Well, it's kind of a bigger commentary, but I want to offer up this thought.

555
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:22,820
So we talked about, you know, if the industry had been unionized recently or that they

556
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:29,980
should unionize, what if the industry had unionized prior to the 83 crash?

557
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:34,500
Who would we be in a situation like this?

558
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,220
What we have to deal? I mean, I still think we would have things like these, you know,

559
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:46,140
got awful microtransactions or we'd we'd still have to see, you know, rushed releases.

560
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:50,620
But the thing is, it's actually we may not see the rush releases because employees would

561
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:54,620
be set for a certain number of hours, a certain number of privileges for the work they

562
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,820
put into the game.

563
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:01,740
And the the managers, the ones who were basically fucking shit up, they would be the

564
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:06,300
ones who then go and then have to maintain those standards.

565
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,660
So they would be held liable to it as well.

566
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,260
And we might actually get more realistic development cycles.

567
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:19,660
The other thing that I'm thinking of in this one, too, is that now this is you know, I've

568
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:23,060
been putting a lot of thought to this and what you bringing up the crash really made me

569
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,580
want to focus on it more.

570
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,940
The other thing, too, is that just going into the social standpoint of working in the

571
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,460
video game industry, we may not have some of the disparities that we have right now, too.

572
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:41,180
I'm going to give a very blunt response to the question that you may think I'm joking,

573
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:41,860
but I'm not.

574
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:46,340
OK, no, I'm going to give you my very honest answer, and this is going to be something

575
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:50,860
where you're like, I am not happy Rob said that, but it's it's the truth.

576
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:59,460
If video game unions in 1983 meant that cocaine would be forbidden in the workplace, the

577
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,580
industry would not be in the position it's at now.

578
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,980
No, I I understand that.

579
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,540
Trust me.

580
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,460
Like that, that's real talk.

581
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:14,500
Like if that meant there was no cocaine, folks, I'm just saying, how do you think those

582
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:19,140
games got turned around in six weeks, like and the winners?

583
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,300
Why do you think, OK, here we go.

584
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,700
Hello, Pandora's box.

585
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,580
We're going to open you.

586
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,860
We're going to unpack some stuff.

587
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,980
Hello, maybe in the US, Rob.

588
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,420
Why do you think the video game industry then felt such an onus to put these things on

589
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:37,900
their games about FBI warning winners don't use drugs and all this stuff in the 90s

590
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,540
because the video game industry was born from drugs in the 80s?

591
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:46,140
Like so much of it was like and again, I'm sorry, it's not the answer anyone wants to

592
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,900
hear, but it's just the reality.

593
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:53,180
So like I but I guess I'm not I'm not trying to just discredit your point, dark soccer.

594
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:59,060
I just think like games were developed in such a different way in the 1980s versus the

595
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,220
way they're done today.

596
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:06,020
I'm actually I almost feel like the effect a union would have in the 80s would just have

597
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:10,860
completely transformed everything like we wouldn't have E.T., we wouldn't have Yars

598
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,540
Revenge, we would have any of it because we didn't have drugs.

599
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:17,980
That's one thing. But I also do sort of think that and I'd actually have to dig more into

600
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:22,980
that because now I'm curious as to the whole winners don't use drugs, you know, crack.

601
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:29,540
But I'm thinking that maybe there might have been just some sort of subsidy or some sort

602
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,940
of requirement for publishing.

603
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,500
I have to look at what the jurisdiction was when all that was going down, because we

604
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:41,580
don't see it anymore in our very few modern arcade releases that we happen to get.

605
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:47,300
But it's sort of my thought that that might have been some sort of almost subsidizing

606
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,300
like a like our current YouTube ads and crazy things like that.

607
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:51,780
Make sense?

608
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,140
Yeah, no, for sure.

609
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:53,780
For sure.

610
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:57,940
It was it was government subsidy to put a little bit more money into the entertainment

611
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,980
industry. I don't know.

612
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,220
That's that's a theory, a game theory.

613
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,540
Hey, now they didn't pay for that ad.

614
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,660
I know. I was joking.

615
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,340
That's called parody.

616
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,580
I know I can parody.

617
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,180
All right. But anyway, you see what my point was.

618
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,340
I do. I do know that.

619
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:21,660
And that's why. But my brain instantly went to, well, you'd have that, but you wouldn't

620
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,260
have this.

621
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:28,940
No, I imagine they pass some eight balls around, you know, I'm just saying, you know,

622
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,380
had a little line here and there.

623
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,460
No, I've talked to some of those game developers.

624
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,980
I know things, Rob.

625
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,340
Yeah, I know. I know.

626
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:43,300
So this is again, and the reason why I'm hesitant is as I don't want to sound like I'm

627
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:46,260
glamorizing it or endorsing it or any of that stuff.

628
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,420
I'm really not.

629
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:53,780
But I also realize it is a very harsh reality about how we got from point A to point Z.

630
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,500
So, yeah, no, right.

631
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:01,380
It just makes me it's sort of those what ifs.

632
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,100
No, I know. I get it. I get it.

633
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,940
All right. Anyway, let's move on.

634
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:12,260
Let's talk about our gaming weeks, whether it was, you know, affected by substances or

635
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,340
not. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

636
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,940
All right. How is your gaming?

637
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,260
I sure was. I went on a bender this weekend.

638
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,220
Dark Saga, how was your gaming week?

639
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,460
I played something other than Animal Crossing, Rob.

640
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:23,940
What?

641
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,060
Well, I did play Animal Crossing.

642
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,940
I mean, it's like the sufficient amount of my gaming time.

643
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:35,700
But I played around on the Switch online store just trying to, you know, I was looking

644
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,420
around to see what some of the SNES games were.

645
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,700
And I found one of my favorite little shooters on there was just Poppin' Twendy.

646
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:46,460
And I set it for wimp mode and just had a good time playing a couple of stages.

647
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,140
You know, I was like, oh, I remember this.

648
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:54,820
And then I remembered I sprained my thumb and so tapping repeatedly on that button to

649
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:58,260
fire my weapons, you know, and I was like trying to remember what color the bells did

650
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:04,740
what and realized that, you know, I don't like the the purple weapon as much as the

651
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,900
green weapon. And but I had I had a good time playing.

652
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,140
It was a sort of memories.

653
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:14,780
You know, this was back from when I would have my SNES emulator and would, you know,

654
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:21,100
download these ROMs because hello, who didn't and played, you know, these, you know.

655
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:26,980
Japanese SNES games that never, Super Famicom games that never got released in the US.

656
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:31,700
So there's a few others on there, there's Pano de Pon, which I might go back and play.

657
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:38,100
There's Mario P-Cross, which I'm not a P-Cross fan, but, you know, there was there's a

658
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:42,420
few other things on there that I was checking out and I might actually consider finishing

659
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:48,940
my run through of Mother, but I found my my GBA somewhere.

660
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,100
I don't know where it is now.

661
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:58,020
Again, it vanishes it unearths itself like, you know, Internet trolls, but I'm considering

662
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:04,380
playing my translated cart of Mother 3 because there's been like some discussion on it for

663
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:07,180
this. I don't know if we're going to have this in there.

664
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,260
I didn't see it in the show role.

665
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:11,460
I might have overlooked it, but there was a whole thing about how Nintendo doesn't want

666
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,740
to do games that evoke sadness.

667
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:14,580
You can get into it.

668
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:19,460
It that whole thing started like two minutes after I sent out the show role for tonight.

669
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,300
So it's it's breaking news, if you will.

670
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:26,860
Well, and one of one of my people I follow on there was saying, oh, now Mother 3 will

671
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:32,140
never come out on on the switch for any of the releases or anything like that.

672
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:39,820
And I was like, you know, maybe you're taking that out of context, but it did seem very.

673
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:44,300
It's like the toxic positivity thing, does that make sense?

674
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:44,900
Oh, yeah.

675
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:51,860
And I'm like, you if you deny the bad that happens in your life, you can't appreciate

676
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:55,500
the good as much or you're compartmentalizing it, you're not dealing with it.

677
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:00,460
And I think Nintendo, given the fact that the games that they've had that have a vote

678
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:04,420
for those emotions, do it so well and relatively safely.

679
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:10,580
I think that that was a poor choice of something to say, does that make sense?

680
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:10,980
Yep.

681
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,580
Toxic positivity is what I call James Corden.

682
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:15,180
Who?

683
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:16,300
It's fine.

684
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:22,980
OK, if that's a TV thing, I don't get it because I only watch Supernatural and it's

685
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:23,300
gone.

686
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:23,820
Kinda.

687
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:24,260
It's all right.

688
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,180
Anything else for your gaming week?

689
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:29,740
Words.

690
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:30,620
No.

691
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:32,180
All right.

692
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:33,980
Loki, how was your gaming week?

693
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:35,980
It was OK.

694
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:39,580
So I started off working on my game.

695
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:46,100
I've been trying to research how to do animated tiles and haven't had a lot of luck.

696
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:53,180
I did manage to create a really irritating flashing screen that animated tiles, but it's

697
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,340
not the right way to do it.

698
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:59,620
And so it's been a lot of research this week, not a whole lot being made in the game,

699
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,820
just more just figuring out how to do stuff.

700
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:06,180
But I'm realizing I'm getting to the point where, you know, I don't know if it's going

701
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,620
to I'm going to figure it out.

702
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:09,820
There is a way to do it.

703
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,980
I just don't know how code wise.

704
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:15,940
So I'll have to research some more, but I am probably going to work some more on the

705
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:17,340
actual game and other parts.

706
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:23,980
And then I've been playing some more Minecraft with my kids.

707
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,060
So we've been playing on our realm.

708
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:29,180
I've been trying to fix with some of the last updates I've done.

709
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:35,860
It's broken some of my plugins a little bit, so I was trying to reload some stuff and

710
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:43,700
update things, but man, like realms on Minecraft, they're just janky as hell.

711
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:52,780
So they really don't respond well to updating plugins that are in there or add ons into

712
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:53,260
the game.

713
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:59,580
So you have to, I don't know, like I've tried so many times just to like add one more

714
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:03,500
plugin on there and I've removed like several of them, but it's just sometimes they'll

715
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:07,220
just time out or refuse to load or whatever the case may be.

716
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:16,740
So it's, it's just been a struggle, but still built the castle and helped my son with

717
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,060
some redstone stuff.

718
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:20,460
So we've been just doing that, just messing around.

719
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:21,220
Nice.

720
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,820
And a little bit of hornet.

721
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,340
How's Pixel Poops coming along?

722
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:31,180
Well, that's what I was saying, you know, with Pixel Poops, I've been just researching

723
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:39,900
how to do animated tiles in the nest because it's a lot harder than I, well, everything's

724
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:48,380
hard with the NES, but so I was trying to find a way to just up, you know, reload tile

725
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:48,980
sets and stuff.

726
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:52,140
So they'd swap it out, but it takes too long to do that.

727
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:55,940
And so that's where I was getting that weird flickering effect.

728
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,420
I think I posted it on Twitter just to show like the animated tiles.

729
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:05,420
Maybe I just mentioned it, but so now there's another method that you can do that, which

730
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:07,060
is updating the name table.

731
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,780
But in order to do that, I have to read from the name table.

732
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:16,340
And that's also tricky as well, because it's in the the picture processing unit when you're

733
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:16,780
doing that.

734
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:21,780
It's just, it's so complicated, but I may just give up on the animated tiles and just

735
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,900
move on with creating more assets for the game.

736
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:30,020
So I'll probably end up doing that and the other things I want to implement.

737
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,260
But I really would like animated tiles.

738
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:35,340
It would really look nice, but leave it and come back to it later.

739
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,820
You know, maybe I'll have a breakthrough somewhere else that leads to that.

740
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,020
That's what I've been doing.

741
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:43,900
It's just been just trying to understand how things work in the NES and how it loads up

742
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:44,420
and everything.

743
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:47,620
So but yeah, I'll come back to it probably.

744
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,220
OK, my gaming week.

745
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,540
So nothing really new.

746
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:55,740
I've been continuing on with a lot of things I've been talking about here on the show,

747
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,060
continuing on with Dragon Quest 11.

748
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:03,820
I'm even further into that game, probably like 25 hours in at this point, getting making

749
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:04,460
progress on that.

750
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:10,660
And then I was playing quite a bit of Pokemon Go slash Ingress slash Orna, like all the GPS

751
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:10,900
games.

752
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:14,980
I was doing a lot of that yesterday just because, you know, it's Saturday.

753
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:17,420
I didn't have much to do, so I was like, well, let me go walking.

754
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:19,220
I'm going to go on some hikes, some adventure.

755
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:23,180
I'm going to go get some hard to get portals that take, you know, like one of them.

756
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:27,700
I had to do like a mile and a half walk in a mile, half walk back, you know, but that's the

757
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,260
type of stuff where I needed the motivation.

758
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:36,700
And then, of course, since I was doing Pokemon Go with that, I was like, I don't think I

759
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,020
should do this Mr.

760
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:41,940
Rhyme event because they want eight bucks so you can catch a particular.

761
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:47,620
But I did it because I'm a sucker and consumer whore and how Mr.

762
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:52,660
Consumer Whore and but I was like, you know what, I'm so bored and this is like a little

763
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:55,380
incentive to go outside and do some stuff and walk around.

764
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:56,660
And I do like Mr.

765
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:56,980
Rhyme.

766
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:57,660
He's really funny.

767
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:03,900
So I was like, whatever, even though I'm sure he will be obtainable in the game in like three

768
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,580
months because that's what they did with Genesect and some of the other releases that they did

769
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:08,420
in a similar way.

770
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,500
But but but I also don't know because Mr.

771
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:18,820
Rhyme, the base one from Gen one has been a region exclusive to the UK, and we haven't been

772
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:23,780
able to get that here until they did an event here at one point where you were able to get that

773
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:27,620
and Kangaskhan, like you're able to get all the exclusives pretty easy during that event.

774
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:31,260
Yeah, you probably played during that event or maybe you traded whatever.

775
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:36,980
But I don't know if they're going to maybe do the Galarian one differently when they release it

776
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:37,500
or what.

777
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,500
So, yeah.

778
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,300
So I was like, whatever.

779
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:45,660
I didn't feel great about endorsing Niantic doing that, but I was really bored.

780
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,620
So forgive me.

781
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:51,100
Otherwise, how many things do you get away with just because you're bored?

782
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:52,700
Murder?

783
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,180
Why did you kill him?

784
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:54,940
I was bored.

785
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:55,620
All right.

786
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:57,980
But a serious note.

787
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:03,780
So kind of speaking of Pokemon, I think I talked about this on a previous episode, but like I kind of

788
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,380
played even more of it this week.

789
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:07,940
I've been playing a lot of Pokemon Shield.

790
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:11,260
My save file is up to almost 60 hours at this point.

791
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:17,940
And that's because of Pokemon Home and kind of unveiling that central dex kind of motivated me to.

792
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:23,140
And here's the shocking thing about this whole like Rob is suddenly super into the Pokemon

793
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:23,980
mainline games.

794
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:25,900
This isn't a shame thing.

795
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:29,460
And this might shock you like, wait, wait, wait.

796
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,220
He didn't bully you into this somehow?

797
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:36,420
No, like, actually, I don't think he really believes that it's happening.

798
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:42,860
In some ways, but my dex in Shield is up to like 310.

799
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:48,300
At this point, I have a spreadsheet tracking everything I need to get and how I get it and the

800
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,940
ones I need to level up and the ones I need to trade with somebody.

801
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:57,540
I've been using Pokemon Home to do some of the trades like Lunatone is in Shield, but

802
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,900
Solrock is in Sword.

803
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:04,500
So I traded that in Home and you even get stickers for doing some of that stuff for your

804
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,140
profile.

805
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:10,580
And so it's I don't know what finally set me off on the mainline Pokemon games.

806
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:18,940
But I guess Home and Quarantine and Pokemon Go kind of affecting the mainline games that

807
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:24,620
regard kind of all just suddenly gave me this incentive where I'm like, I am going to

808
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:25,420
catch them all.

809
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:26,620
Yes, I am.

810
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:27,860
Just like I'm going to do it.

811
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:29,860
I'm going to catch them all this time.

812
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,060
So that's what I've been working on.

813
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,580
No DLC until I catch them all.

814
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:35,660
That is my rule.

815
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:41,180
So maybe in a couple of weeks on the show, once I've caught them all, I will get into the

816
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:42,700
DLC and all that stuff.

817
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,580
So, all right.

818
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,300
But that's yeah.

819
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,820
So I've been spending a lot of time on Pokemon.

820
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:48,940
Weird, right?

821
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:49,900
All right.

822
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:51,140
Let's see.

823
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:55,660
Sia Tabiri in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says, Rob, catch him right here, folks.

824
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,140
I guess.

825
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,460
I mean, it only took how many years?

826
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:04,860
Isn't Pokemon having like its 20th anniversary, no, 25th anniversary right now.

827
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:06,020
All right.

828
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,580
Anyway, let's move on.

829
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,220
We got a lot of news to get into.

830
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:12,260
We've been talking a lot, so let's get to it.

831
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:14,900
Loki, other big news and announcements this week.

832
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:15,940
Yeah.

833
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:20,900
So they had this cool Nintendo Direct covering the Indies again.

834
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:27,020
So this Indie World Showcase and during their like 15 minute live stream, they had, uh,

835
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:29,980
several different games that they talked about.

836
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:35,700
So some of the more notable stuff, obviously, uh, we had a Super Meat Boy Forever.

837
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:39,860
It's going to be, uh, exclusive to the Switch on December 23rd.

838
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:47,940
Uh, also there was, um, Fist of Fluffs, which is a physics based, uh,

839
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,140
cat fighting game.

840
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:50,180
So that was kind of fun.

841
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:57,780
Um, there's also a course, uh, very, very valet, which reminds me of like those,

842
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:05,860
um, how like the, the cooking games that they have, um, where it's like a cooking

843
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:10,420
party game, so that's supposed to be coming out early 2021, like overcooked

844
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:14,620
those games, yeah, like overcooked, but like parking it's like that.

845
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:19,300
Or, um, there was another one with also like moving, um, boxes and stuff.

846
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:24,180
It's a similar type of kind of, uh, chaotic, uh, four player co-op type thing.

847
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,900
So that's, uh, a valet game that's going to be coming out.

848
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:33,220
And, um, Cyber Shadow, which looks a little like, it looks like it took a

849
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:37,460
little too many cues from Ninja Gaiden, but it's like a cyberpunk, uh, Ninja

850
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:40,580
Gaiden game, and that's coming out, uh, January 26th.

851
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,700
There was, there was another game I played recently cause it was on, is

852
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:44,700
it the last messenger?

853
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:45,380
Is that the game?

854
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:48,140
There's some game on a Xbox game pass.

855
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:52,900
It's it is straight up, not even shy that it's like a Ninja Gaiden game.

856
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:53,140
Yeah.

857
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:55,500
Well that one, that one's like a Ninja Gaiden game.

858
00:55:55,500 --> 00:56:01,420
This one, like the sprites look almost identical and the cut scenes really

859
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,300
resemble the original cut scenes.

860
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:08,940
In fact, like I would almost say that they were copied, but it's not, it's,

861
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:14,300
it's very like, like if you were, if you were to show someone that in like,

862
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:18,540
they may think it's a Ninja Gaiden sequel, like from the original NES.

863
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:18,860
But anyways.

864
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:21,060
And Act F says it is the messenger.

865
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,060
I added another one.

866
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:22,940
Yeah, the messenger.

867
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:23,140
Yeah.

868
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:23,740
I remember that one.

869
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:26,180
So, um, what else?

870
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:32,740
Of course, uh, the very big announcement was that, uh, that Among

871
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:36,620
Us is going to be out that day on the Switch.

872
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,020
So that's pretty cool.

873
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:41,220
Um, some other cool stuff that they're showing off as well.

874
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:43,020
Uh, going back to Cyber Shadow real quick.

875
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:48,540
So, um, if you scan your amiibo for Shovel Knight, it also adds like a power

876
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:49,820
up to the game, which is kind of neat.

877
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:56,660
They showed off also, uh, this game called Alba, the wildlife adventure,

878
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:02,220
which is kind of more of like a calming, uh, you know, not Pokemon snap, but it's

879
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:03,700
a game where you take pictures of wildlife.

880
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,740
I know there's like another game they're showing off for like the

881
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:07,220
PlayStation four is kind of similar.

882
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:10,580
So there's that, um, yeah.

883
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:11,460
Yeah.

884
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:14,900
So lots of cool indie games that were being shown off there.

885
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:21,060
And, uh, uh, Tunchi, or I think that's how to spell that Tucci or Tunchi, uh, which

886
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:27,580
was a 2d beat him up game that's set in the Amazon reinforce also has, um, the

887
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,500
character from hat and time in there as well.

888
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:37,500
And yeah, so lots of cool stuff to be, I mean, I like how they do showcase their

889
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:41,980
Indies every, almost every month or every few months, at least every month, we're

890
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:45,860
getting one of those and the, the among us thing of course, was, was big news

891
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,780
because, uh, you know, just how big that game is.

892
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:52,460
Um, it is kind of interesting though, that even they kind of suggest that, you

893
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:54,660
know, you use a voice chat app.

894
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:55,940
To use it, which is interesting.

895
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:58,860
They don't even say use the Nintendo app and probably because they don't

896
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:02,380
let the third parties use the direct Nintendo app to do voice chatting.

897
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:05,260
Um, but they suggest using a voice chat app.

898
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,860
I wonder if it's interesting cross-play.

899
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:12,620
I, I don't know what they have this version coming out and then there's

900
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:14,380
the one that's on games fast.

901
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:19,020
I wonder if this is all cross-play like PC and, uh, I think PC and Android

902
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:22,180
and stuff are all cross-play as well.

903
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,220
As far as I know.

904
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:23,540
Yes.

905
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:23,900
I'm waiting.

906
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:27,100
I'm hoping somebody in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network will let us

907
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,900
know because I do see a couple of people are saying that they picked up the game

908
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:30,740
on switch this week.

909
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,860
So I'm curious if they played with people on PC.

910
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:34,900
I don't see why it wouldn't be cross-play.

911
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:35,580
Uh, okay.

912
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,300
And act F confirming it is cross-play.

913
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:38,260
Oh, that's good.

914
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,300
Yeah, that's very good.

915
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:41,540
All right.

916
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:45,460
Um, so moving on, let's talk about some other big news that came out this

917
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:50,340
week because it's not often you see Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft all

918
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:52,220
coming together to make a statement.

919
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:56,020
So this was everybody getting together to make one statement.

920
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:57,860
Now, how often do you get that in the gaming industry?

921
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:58,860
Not very often.

922
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:01,140
And that's kind of what made this newsworthy.

923
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:06,540
Now, uh, it was posted on the official X-Box website, the X-Box, uh, newswire.

924
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:11,140
Um, so I don't know if that indicates that they started the conversation or what.

925
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:15,220
It could also just be that they have, you know, um, the, or they were the first to

926
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:16,660
get out the press release or whatever.

927
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:17,140
I don't know.

928
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:22,460
But anyway, uh, it is a statement basically about, uh, kind of reaffirming

929
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,660
that, uh, gaming is for everybody.

930
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:30,260
And we need to basically take efforts to have a shared commitment to safer gaming

931
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:30,860
for everybody.

932
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,980
So that was kind of nice to see coming from all of those companies.

933
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:38,500
Um, so it was a very long, uh, kind of, uh, statement with this, but it was nice to

934
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,500
see them all come together.

935
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:42,260
Let me try to get some of the highlights from this statement here.

936
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:46,580
We believe gaming is for people of all ages, including our youngest and most

937
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:47,500
vulnerable players.

938
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:50,820
Technology makes compelling entertainment experiences possible, and we want to

939
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:54,500
ensure that those experiences, especially when they involve interaction with others

940
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,460
are positive and respectful.

941
00:59:56,980 --> 01:00:02,220
Um, at Xbox, we are aligned with both Nintendo on behalf of the community of

942
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:06,220
Switch players and PlayStation in our belief that protecting players online

943
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:10,660
requires a multi multidisciplinary approach, one that combines the benefits

944
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:14,860
of advanced technology, a supportive community, and skilled human oversight.

945
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:19,380
We can accomplish more when we work toward the same goal, and so we will each

946
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:23,660
continue investing in evolving and amplifying our approaches to user safety.

947
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:27,860
As we continue this work, we will prioritize protecting the safety of our

948
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:30,020
players, especially those most vulnerable.

949
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:33,460
And then they get into principles that will guide their work.

950
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:38,620
The first one is prevention, letting players control or letting, uh, providing

951
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:41,420
controls that will let players customize their gaming experience.

952
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:46,700
Uh, safety features have to be easy to use, inform play parents and players

953
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:50,740
through code of conduct, terms of use, investing in technology to thwart

954
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:51,780
improper conduct.

955
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:54,220
I'm very much summarizing these bullet points for time.

956
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:58,620
Uh, partnership, uh, partnering with the industry regulators and law

957
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:03,540
enforcement, uh, reinforcing a commitment to safety, um, working with industry

958
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:07,820
trade organizations, including and law enforcement and experts, uh, for advanced

959
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:12,660
online safety initiatives, uh, shared research between the big three, for the

960
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:16,860
better of the industry, we believe that hate and harassment or exploitation of

961
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:19,540
younger players in any way have no place in gaming.

962
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:22,420
Um, and then responsibility.

963
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:26,540
We will hold ourselves accountable for making our platforms as safe as possible

964
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:30,820
for all players, making it easy for players to report violations of the code

965
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:35,620
of conduct and removing content and enforcement actions for violation,

966
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:42,180
complying with local laws, publishing rules and requirements, and, um, basically

967
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:47,780
re-restating that the partnership of to work together, uh, is, is going to help

968
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:52,500
everybody and, and protect, uh, children and so forth, uh, and that working

969
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,020
together, they'll accomplish more than alone.

970
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:59,380
So then why don't they also take the same approach and apply it toward, uh, their

971
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:03,460
studios, toward their employees, treating other employees properly and making a

972
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:04,420
safe working environment?

973
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:06,820
Uh, great question.

974
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:12,820
And I think to be fair, I feel like, uh, specifically Microsoft who put out this

975
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:17,500
original release, I feel like, and unfortunately I don't have the, the press

976
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:21,260
release to back, I feel like they have made that kind of commitment previously.

977
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,940
And when we hear about some of these, uh, studios that are, you know, work to the

978
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:27,900
bonus, it's not usually coming out of Microsoft.

979
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:35,260
Um, and some of the Sony stuff too, but then of course we all heard about the,

980
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:40,460
the last of us part two crunch time, but that was naughty dog who is not, are they

981
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:40,940
specific?

982
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:42,060
Are they owned by Sony?

983
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:47,420
But my, my thought is I get what you're saying though, but beyond that, not

984
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:49,980
just internal in their studios, but the fact that they work with some of these

985
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:55,980
studios that have some atrocious, uh, gender issues and, uh, just bigotry in

986
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:56,860
their studios.

987
01:02:56,860 --> 01:03:02,060
Um, I would think that they would also want to apply that standard to, uh, well,

988
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:07,580
if they were being truly adhering to that standard, that they would want to also,

989
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:13,340
uh, not work with companies until they've also committed to it in house and out of

990
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:13,660
house.

991
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:14,620
Does that make sense?

992
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:15,180
Yeah.

993
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:17,260
And Bob coffee confirming they are Sony owned.

994
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:18,940
Sorry, I'm having a brain fog moment.

995
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:23,820
I'm just, I'm kind of, why don't they fall under that same, but anyway, forget it.

996
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:29,020
Um, some also some folks in chat noting that swap note got an update this week,

997
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:32,540
which is relevant to the conversation because Nintendo had patched that because

998
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:35,180
of the whole, you know, kids getting exposed to stuff.

999
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:35,980
So weird.

1000
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,580
So yeah, no, I'm with you, dark soccer.

1001
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:41,100
This, this strikes me as a, um, this is, this is nice.

1002
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:43,420
This is a nice message.

1003
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:47,260
This is, this is a good, um, guiding principles document.

1004
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:50,780
Now back it up right now.

1005
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:55,100
Now, you know, show the action that backs it up, that it's not just words,

1006
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:59,820
but it is nice that the three of them are, are putting a unified front on this.

1007
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:00,460
That's for sure.

1008
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:01,580
Cause you don't see that every day.

1009
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:03,100
I'll give it that.

1010
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:05,260
All right.

1011
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:08,460
Well, with, with that, let's move on to our next story.

1012
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:10,700
Speaking of kids, kinda.

1013
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:15,900
Well, um, China has made some changes.

1014
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:20,060
They didn't really have a formal age rating system for video games.

1015
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:25,420
Whereas here in the U S and in Canada, we've had ESRB and, uh, Europe has

1016
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:28,060
had the Peggy system PGI.

1017
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:35,180
And so they have a new system that was, uh, put together by, uh, I believe

1018
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:41,820
Nico partners that is, uh, one of six measures proposed by the China

1019
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:44,220
state administration of press and publications.

1020
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:49,420
Um, I'll go into the other proposals in a moment, but this system is

1021
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:53,340
supposed to strengthen their current regulation, uh, uh, around minors

1022
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:55,100
to prevent video game addiction.

1023
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:59,580
So now they have, um, and it's been through 41 revisions according to this.

1024
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:04,540
So, uh, it looks like they are being rated eight plus, which is green 12

1025
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:06,940
plus blue 16 plus yellow.

1026
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:09,740
The 18 plus rating is gone.

1027
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:11,820
We don't know what happened to it.

1028
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:14,540
I think it graduated and left the house.

1029
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:20,940
But at any rate, um, uh, publishers have to display the relevant age

1030
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:25,740
rating on the game's website, the login screen and other materials,

1031
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:28,140
including box art manuals, stuff like that.

1032
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:34,060
Um, now in other news, um, and this kind of goes along with it.

1033
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:39,020
Um, other proposals that have gone with this are real name identification

1034
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:41,900
systems, which we know how the fuck that works for people.

1035
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:49,340
Um, playtime cap for minors, uh, the limit spending that a minor can,

1036
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:53,260
can spend in online games, uh, other options to work with parents and

1037
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:55,820
schools, and then working with local regulators.

1038
01:05:56,780 --> 01:06:03,980
So, um, the quote, uh, that the, uh, analyst firm, uh, said is that, uh,

1039
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:08,300
they don't expect any measures to have quote a material impact on game

1040
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:12,220
publisher earnings and growth, especially since miners are a lower

1041
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:13,500
percentage of spenders.

1042
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:17,820
Yeah, but who buys the games for the miners?

1043
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:19,660
Just saying.

1044
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:25,100
So, yeah, it's, it's interesting to see how it plays out.

1045
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:32,140
I mean, in China also has a fairly, um, stringent system anyway, especially

1046
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:34,300
with how they censor things.

1047
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:40,700
Um, I guess it might make more sense for there.

1048
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:45,660
I, you know, and I don't, I, I certainly understand wanting to, um, do playtime

1049
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:50,940
caps to limit the spending, but should that not be the parent's job?

1050
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:58,300
But then again, China has a lot more hands-on approach to, uh, their

1051
01:06:58,300 --> 01:06:58,860
population.

1052
01:06:58,860 --> 01:06:59,360
Mm-hmm.

1053
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:04,940
I was, I was interested, I thought it was interesting.

1054
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:09,820
They didn't already have a rating system similar to, you know, yeah, they did.

1055
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:11,820
It just wasn't an official system.

1056
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:14,300
It was like a suggestion.

1057
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:16,620
Like a suggested system.

1058
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:17,120
Got it.

1059
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:22,940
So, well, technically, I guess technically the, the stuff we see with the ratings here

1060
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:27,340
isn't like a government mandated system, but it was a system that the industry had

1061
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:30,860
to come up with or else the government was going to come up with its own system,

1062
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:33,900
which we know would have been terrible because it was the government's.

1063
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:36,620
So it was, yeah, it was kind of that sort of situation.

1064
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:41,500
So technically the rating system we have here is kind of unofficial, but then I guess

1065
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:45,500
we've also tried to see where they've built laws around it too.

1066
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,260
It's industry official.

1067
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:51,340
So I do consider it to be official, just not federally mandated.

1068
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:51,840
Yeah.

1069
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:56,700
However, there wasn't any sort of uniform system.

1070
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:59,260
They had like, I believe it was a generalized system.

1071
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:02,780
Maybe it was a little bit more uniform, but I think now they are working specifically

1072
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:07,900
with the government because we've seen other stories come out of Japan with, you

1073
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:13,180
know, gaming cafes and kids, you know, spending their parents' money and other

1074
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:13,980
things like that.

1075
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:20,220
And, you know, I know that, of course, under that regime, they've got many

1076
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:24,060
different, I'm trying to be as diplomatic about this as possible.

1077
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:24,620
I gotcha.

1078
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:32,300
Different things culturally and legislatively that are playing into a decision to have

1079
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:34,060
this be nationally mandated.

1080
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:34,560
Yeah.

1081
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:37,660
And, and I don't live there.

1082
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:43,900
I don't really know many people who live in China who are gamers who operate under these systems.

1083
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:50,380
You know, I have personally seen an IQ once in my life, in real life, which we know what

1084
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:51,020
IQ is.

1085
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:53,820
It was Nintendo's way of releasing games in China.

1086
01:08:55,420 --> 01:09:01,260
But overall, it's, I mean, maybe it's a good thing.

1087
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:01,820
We'll see.

1088
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:09,660
I mean, I think that the over here, if parents actually paid attention to the ESRB ratings,

1089
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:13,340
then there'd be probably fewer complaints.

1090
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:18,780
But, but I don't know.

1091
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:22,140
We'll see if we have any listeners in China.

1092
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:26,700
I don't know if we do or how, let us know how, how the system works over there.

1093
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:28,620
I'd be very curious to know more about it.

1094
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:29,840
For sure.

1095
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:31,200
All right.

1096
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:35,360
Well, let's move on to some big changes over here.

1097
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:35,860
Loki.

1098
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:37,060
Yeah.

1099
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:43,520
So apparently there was, um, Codemasters was looking to be purchased and originally they

1100
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:47,680
had a bid from Take-Two Interactive last month for $1 billion.

1101
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:54,880
Well, EA has swooped in and now, uh, purchased or made the agreement to purchase of the company

1102
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,160
for $1.2 billion.

1103
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,720
Of course, that would bring in a lot of racing series to EA.

1104
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:08,960
But then again, it's also EA who they just, they just go in there and just fleece it dry

1105
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:15,120
and stuff it full of microtransactions before they finally kill off the actual company.

1106
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,600
So, all right.

1107
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:21,680
Well, apparently though, uh, it's supposed to, the acquisition is supposed to be completed

1108
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,000
by the first quarter of 2021.

1109
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,640
Um, and of course that'll give them a lot more racing games under their belt, aside

1110
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:33,600
from of course, Need for Speed and, um, Burnout.

1111
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,100
So.

1112
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:35,780
Cool.

1113
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:37,220
Yeah.

1114
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:39,280
Don't know what else to say on that one.

1115
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:42,720
It's kind of one of those hope it goes well for Codemasters.

1116
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:46,240
I mean, certainly it'll get their games out there, I think for broader and there's going

1117
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:49,360
to be a lot more of a, uh, marketing and ad budget.

1118
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,560
Not to say that didn't exist, but I think, you know, with, with as huge of a company

1119
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,760
as EA is, um, there will definitely be a big boost with that.

1120
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:00,400
And I guess if you want to look at it a certain way, that means more Codemasters stuff will

1121
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,840
show up on EA Play, which in turn will go to Game Pass.

1122
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:06,960
Although I think a lot of the Codemasters stuff is already on Game Pass anyway, but,

1123
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,320
you know, kind of interesting.

1124
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:09,780
Whatever.

1125
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,400
It, it is what it is.

1126
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:14,180
All right.

1127
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,920
Well, let's move on and talk about, I think this is cool.

1128
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:22,000
Um, I don't know how many of you guys saw that direct this week of the Super Nintendo

1129
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,440
World theme park.

1130
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:30,160
So Miyamoto actually went out and showed over in Japan at, uh, uh, the, the, um, universal

1131
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,720
studios out there, what this new land is going to look like.

1132
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:34,160
And it looks really cool.

1133
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:37,840
Now I know you probably guys would expect me to play this on Twitch, but, um, remember

1134
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,120
we are trying to record a podcast and I know there's many folks that listen to the audio

1135
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,000
throughout the week.

1136
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,760
So I didn't want to detract from that too much.

1137
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,440
I will just urge everybody to check out this direct, um, when you can get a chance.

1138
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:51,600
It was posted on December 18th called the Super Nintendo World Direct.

1139
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,840
And it looks like really cool.

1140
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:57,760
And it is interesting to hearing them talk about some of the things that had to be considered

1141
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:01,280
for, um, the world that maybe they didn't have to think about before.

1142
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,880
Like, what does the inside of a warp pipe look like?

1143
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,720
They've never really shown that before.

1144
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:10,720
I think maybe it was represented in some of the cartoons and stuff, but that isn't really

1145
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:11,600
canon.

1146
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,160
Um, so what is the inside of a warp pipe look like?

1147
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:15,040
Yeah.

1148
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:18,240
So they actually show looking at the Kenopios pictures.

1149
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:19,920
Oh, have you not seen this yet?

1150
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:20,480
Oh, it's so good.

1151
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:25,920
I've seen some of it, but I'm actually looking at just some of the, the pictures I've seen

1152
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:28,240
a lot of the pictures that were posted on Twitter, but yeah.

1153
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:28,480
Yeah.

1154
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,680
A lot of these are just ridiculously cute.

1155
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,840
And, um, I would get on a plane for this.

1156
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:34,080
Yeah.

1157
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:38,560
It's really that attention to detail that is really stunning with this whole thing.

1158
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:42,320
Uh, and technically dark soccer, you don't really have to get on a plane because this

1159
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:47,680
world will be coming to universal studios, um, in Hollywood, as well as the park in Orlando,

1160
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:48,240
Florida.

1161
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:52,720
So kind of like, um, how, when they got the rights to Harry Potter, they did the wizarding

1162
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:53,600
world in Florida.

1163
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:57,600
They did one in, um, LA and I think Japan has one of those too.

1164
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,560
So it's kind of that concept, um, with this.

1165
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,240
So all the parks right now.

1166
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:03,360
Oh yeah.

1167
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:04,720
It's not a good time.

1168
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,480
No, now is not a good time for theme parks.

1169
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:11,440
I mean, it looks very limited in size, but I know that's the same with the wizarding

1170
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,400
world of Harry Potter.

1171
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,960
There's like maybe one or two attractions there.

1172
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,720
And then that's it, which is kind of disappointing.

1173
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:22,000
If it's super Nintendo world, it's like, well, it's Mario and Mario and done.

1174
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,840
There's no room to put anything else.

1175
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:28,160
Also with the wizard world, it's different in Florida than it is in Hollywood.

1176
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:31,520
And I kind of think it sounds like Florida has the better version because they have more

1177
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:32,020
rides.

1178
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:36,720
Um, but they also have more real, they, they ha they have a boatload of real estate to

1179
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:37,600
play with in Florida.

1180
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,080
That's why there's like five Disney parks in Florida.

1181
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:45,120
And in the, in the U S and Anaheim, it's always like, what are we going to lose to

1182
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,080
get something new?

1183
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:50,480
Like, yes, they're building a whole Avengers section in a Disney California adventure,

1184
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,360
but guess what?

1185
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:55,600
The bugs life stuff is gone now because they had to take something out.

1186
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,720
Nothing was lost.

1187
01:13:56,720 --> 01:14:01,840
Nothing of value was, well, there was that, there was that train with all the sense.

1188
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:02,340
Yeah.

1189
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:03,220
Yeah.

1190
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,240
There's that too.

1191
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:04,740
Yeah.

1192
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:05,760
Hey, you know what?

1193
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:10,800
I still found, uh, I found my, uh, video that I took of them singing happy trails and it

1194
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:11,920
makes me sad.

1195
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:12,420
Yeah.

1196
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:18,640
Well, and, and Bobby, um, made a comment in chat saying now is the best time for theme

1197
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,800
parks to be building new experiences.

1198
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:21,300
Yes.

1199
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:22,880
Um, this is a great time.

1200
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:23,120
Yeah.

1201
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:23,440
Building.

1202
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:23,940
Yes.

1203
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:31,200
Um, opening, not so much, but by the time this gets to California, you know, we're talking

1204
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,560
at this point, 2022, maybe 2023.

1205
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:38,640
And I think theme parks will be back on the table for discussion when we get that far

1206
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,880
out, hopefully they go, Oh God, I hope so.

1207
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,400
So anyway,

1208
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,280
I'm curious to see though what the new, uh, Mario Kart ride is.

1209
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:51,120
Cause it kind of briefly touched on it that it's got like some AR component to it.

1210
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:55,440
Um, but they didn't really show if it's like a rollercoaster or if it's like kind of one

1211
01:14:55,440 --> 01:15:00,640
of those, just motion rides, not like motion ride, but like, you know, trackless motion

1212
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:01,680
ride, I guess.

1213
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,600
Um, or something like that.

1214
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,160
I don't know.

1215
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,360
You know, maybe it is a rollercoaster.

1216
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:07,840
I don't know.

1217
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:12,720
Oh, think cars like California adventure.

1218
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:14,800
I guess.

1219
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:15,600
Yeah.

1220
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,100
Yeah.

1221
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:18,560
That'd be cool.

1222
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,040
Yeah.

1223
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:19,680
That'd be fun.

1224
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:23,120
Especially if you get to throw red shells at people, that'll be the best part.

1225
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:24,480
Yeah.

1226
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:24,800
All right.

1227
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,320
I'm moving on.

1228
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,800
Let's get the spin out when you get hit with the red shell.

1229
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:31,120
Blue shells.

1230
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,440
It just sends everyone to the back of the line to get into the ride.

1231
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:38,800
Um, another thing that's at those theme parks at universal is the Simpsons ride.

1232
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:43,120
Cause the one in a Hollywood, uh, replaced that back to the future ride.

1233
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,240
I don't know if you guys remember that from when we were really young, but, uh, yeah.

1234
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:48,080
Now they have that Simpsons ride.

1235
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,240
Um, and that one, I like that ride.

1236
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:50,960
That one's really fun.

1237
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:54,400
But what makes that ride is like the whole queue and every, there's so many jokes leading

1238
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:54,800
up to it.

1239
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:55,680
It's great.

1240
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:58,640
But, um, dark soccer has some Simpsons related news, right?

1241
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:00,240
I do.

1242
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:04,080
And not only is it Simpsons news, it's Dreamcast news.

1243
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,080
You know, I love me some Dreamcast.

1244
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:06,400
Same.

1245
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:14,320
So, um, there, um, there was a, uh, a dev kit that was found.

1246
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:20,000
Apparently it was a, uh, broken Dreamcast dev kits hard drive that had this.

1247
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:25,200
And it looks like as a playable demo for a game called the Simpsons bug squad.

1248
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:34,800
Um, so as far as we can tell from this video, um, you're playing as a bug and the Simpsons

1249
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:35,920
are walking around.

1250
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:44,800
Um, it was a tech demo, but at any rate, it, it was supposed to be though, for a title

1251
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,760
that was called Simpsons bug squad, I think it's just, you know, setting it up.

1252
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:54,640
It was, uh, by, uh, red lemon studios who is no longer among the, the living.

1253
01:16:54,640 --> 01:17:00,080
Um, and it actually, I mean, for the demo, it looked really good.

1254
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,280
It was all cell shaded.

1255
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,480
It looked very much like the show.

1256
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:08,960
I mean, if it's just, you know, cell shaded, non textured, uh, 3d, then that wouldn't really

1257
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,040
have been too difficult for the Dreamcast to do.

1258
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,920
Um, but it looks pretty cool.

1259
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,440
I watched a little bit of the video.

1260
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:20,640
There are, uh, tools out there to learn how to make it playable.

1261
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:24,320
So you can check it out for the places that still probably have it up.

1262
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,720
Um, but it looks pretty cool.

1263
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:34,160
Um, and I just like when we find more things, uh, little tidbits on these development systems

1264
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:39,920
that people pick up for a song that are able to pull, uh, games out like that or demos

1265
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:40,240
like that.

1266
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:43,600
I just think it's pretty cool stuff, you know, what could have been.

1267
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:49,680
And the guy said that there was some additional, uh, tech demos on there from that same developer.

1268
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:54,320
So it's exciting to see what other things they have considering that they were working

1269
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:57,840
on a lot of games, uh, developed for Fox interactive.

1270
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,680
So it'd be interesting.

1271
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:05,680
And even that like tech demo of the Simpsons game, that looked really good for like a Dreamcast

1272
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:05,920
game.

1273
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:09,840
Like that's, you know, I don't know, it's pretty solid.

1274
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:12,480
Did genuinely have really good looking games.

1275
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:19,680
Um, I mean, yeah, every, every system has its, you know, steaming turds, but in this

1276
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:25,840
case, um, I, it, especially for a game that's, that's a cell shaded game like this.

1277
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:30,960
That, um, you know, like I said, wouldn't have any major textures on it.

1278
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:35,840
It, I would expect it to actually run pretty well in the Dreamcast, depending on, you know,

1279
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:39,200
everything else trying to load in the game, but it looks, it looks, it looks fun.

1280
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:43,600
It looks like it'd be, it would have been a really good, you know, fun outlet if ever

1281
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,440
we'd gotten more goodies on the Dreamcast.

1282
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:46,240
Yeah.

1283
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:47,840
All right.

1284
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:53,280
I, I, I'm a very similar to a dark Tetsuya in our chat who says, uh, love me some unreleased

1285
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:54,080
game stories.

1286
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,040
Hell yeah.

1287
01:18:55,040 --> 01:19:00,160
Over at twitch.tv slash vog network, uh, Zen monkey 11, following that up and in living

1288
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:03,440
color RPG and married with children Sims like game.

1289
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:04,880
Who knows what they may have been working on?

1290
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,680
Maybe your fire, a Firefly game, right?

1291
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:08,240
All right.

1292
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:13,920
I'm still waiting for my, uh, my Jerry Seinfeld point and click game.

1293
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,000
You know, that's supposed to be coming at some point.

1294
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,040
Excuse me while I throw up in my mouth a little bit.

1295
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,160
What's the clicking do?

1296
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:20,660
Nothing.

1297
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,280
No, it, it, it really is.

1298
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:27,440
They remember they were making that Seinfeld, uh, point and click game that someone was

1299
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:27,680
doing.

1300
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:28,960
There's like a fan game.

1301
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:32,480
He has, it's a fan game, not a, not an official product.

1302
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:32,720
Yeah.

1303
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,600
But I would like, I would just, I'd accept any TV show like that.

1304
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,080
Married with children, uh, golden girls.

1305
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:40,880
Why not?

1306
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:45,520
You know, Bobby, uh, chimed in and said there was a homie D clown PC game in the nineties.

1307
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:50,720
I saw that on one of y'all's, uh, games done quick marathon, whether it was awesome or

1308
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:50,960
summer.

1309
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,760
I don't remember what was one of the two, but that was in one of the marathons.

1310
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:57,200
It was in the, um, uh, not great game block.

1311
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,720
So I remember seeing that thing.

1312
01:19:58,720 --> 01:19:58,880
Yeah.

1313
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,160
I remember seeing that thinking.

1314
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:03,200
They had this game and I didn't own it somehow.

1315
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,120
Cause I had a lot of crappy games in the nineties.

1316
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:05,760
I'll tell you that.

1317
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:06,800
So, okay.

1318
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:09,920
It was this most recent summer games done quick says Bobby.

1319
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,360
So interesting.

1320
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:12,400
All right.

1321
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,120
Uh, moving on, let's get to some more news.

1322
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:19,040
Loki, this is, this is one of those things we should have seen coming.

1323
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:30,080
Yeah, well, it, it is the M O of, uh, Epic games and Fortnite to, um, borrow.

1324
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,400
Don't hold back from pop culture.

1325
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:40,960
So they came out with a brand new totally original mode called the spy within.

1326
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:46,720
And with the spy within it is a spinoff of their standard battle royale type game,

1327
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:54,640
where you have to figure out who the imposters are and take your crew and try to complete tasks.

1328
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:58,080
You can't talk to each other unless you call a meeting.

1329
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:01,680
G what could they be possibly ripping off?

1330
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:05,920
So yes, clearly, clearly inspired by among us.

1331
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:10,400
It is, it looks incredibly cheap of them to do that.

1332
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:14,160
But then again, if you think about it, Fortnite pretty much exists as.

1333
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:17,840
You know, pub G was popular at the time and their original game Fortnite.

1334
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,000
Didn't look all that popular.

1335
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Let's make a battle royale game out of it.

1336
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:22,720
Hey, look at that.

1337
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:23,840
It's popular.

1338
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,680
So Fortnite didn't get popular until it ripped off pub G that's right.

1339
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:30,160
Many people forget that wasn't supposed to be Fortnite.

1340
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,520
Battle royale took over and became Fortnite,

1341
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:37,760
but there was actually like a whole single player game that, you know, was like a survival game.

1342
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:38,000
Yeah.

1343
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,560
It was like cookie cutter, you know, like all the other shooters out there.

1344
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:48,000
It wasn't like survival horror, but it had the building elements in it too,

1345
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,600
which they just took from Minecraft.

1346
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:53,040
So, you know, Fortnite is popular from stealing all these other ideas really.

1347
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:54,640
So, yeah.

1348
01:21:54,640 --> 01:22:00,800
And then, of course, they also have they added a 120 hertz mode as well for

1349
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:05,760
the newer consoles, so the Xbox Series X.

1350
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:14,960
And then also you can also do like 1440p on Series X at 120 hertz and 1080p on the Series S.

1351
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:20,240
And I think the PlayStation 5 also got an additional graphics mode as well.

1352
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:27,920
And then also, of course, there is a house party video chat app that you can set up.

1353
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,400
I guess they're using it.

1354
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,640
Do they have like some investment in this or something?

1355
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:36,720
Because I guess this is similar to like using Discord or something.

1356
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:39,200
But I don't know.

1357
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:42,320
It just is such a rip off.

1358
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,320
I don't think this is going to be popular.

1359
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:47,200
Honestly, it does seem like kind of just a cheap rip off.

1360
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:51,600
And I think Among Us isn't all of a sudden going to become unpopular because of this.

1361
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:55,680
But it's just that's just really low.

1362
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:58,080
Well, I guess not for Epic Games.

1363
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:02,240
Also unsurprising, though, like real talk, because haven't we been saying for long?

1364
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,800
Oh, every game's got to put in a battle royale mode.

1365
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:08,480
Every game is going to have this new battle royale thing until the next big thing comes along.

1366
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:11,360
Who knows what the next big thing will be, but it'll show up someday.

1367
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:12,720
And then every game is going to put that.

1368
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:19,200
Oh, it's here, of course, with Among Us being one of the top 10 on Twitch pretty consistently

1369
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:25,680
at this point, with very high profile people like AOC playing Among Us on her Twitch feed.

1370
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:29,360
You know, this is this is a thing now.

1371
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:38,400
So yeah, so I'm just I'm not surprised at all that this got ripped off.

1372
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:44,320
And I think this also begs the question, what's going to be the next game to borrow from Among Us?

1373
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:48,720
Are we going to get Super Mario imposter or what?

1374
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:50,320
What game?

1375
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:51,920
No, I know we don't.

1376
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,160
We haven't done listless in a long time.

1377
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:55,840
But if we did, that would be the game.

1378
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,920
That would be the list I want to do right now.

1379
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:02,400
Game that is most likely to implement an Among Us mode next.

1380
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:06,400
Oh, I can tell you already what they would have what they would probably do.

1381
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,120
It would be an obstacle course that game Fall Guys ish.

1382
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,760
You know, like they would rip off Fall Guys, I think.

1383
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:12,800
I don't know.

1384
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:13,840
No, not for now.

1385
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:14,400
Not what not.

1386
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,560
What does Fortnite rip off next?

1387
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:19,760
What is the next game to rip off Among Us?

1388
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:23,440
Although that's a good answer to what will be the next game to like Call of Duty.

1389
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,160
Yeah, I could see that.

1390
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:26,660
Yeah.

1391
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,200
I don't know.

1392
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:35,840
It they it's it's easily it's because one, I mean, I get it.

1393
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:40,480
You can't necessarily copyright certain gameplay elements.

1394
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:45,040
I'm I'm laughing because they're a small you have to probably get away with it.

1395
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:47,840
Bobby Black Wolf would have won the listless with this answer.

1396
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:50,320
Bobby Black Wolf said Pixel Poops.

1397
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:50,960
Who pooped?

1398
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:56,240
Sure, why not?

1399
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:57,600
We can we can rip them off.

1400
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:08,000
Well, I saw him back behind the taco place, and so I know he was getting the tacos.

1401
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,240
I saw Loki vent.

1402
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:17,440
I just needed fresh air.

1403
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:19,200
Oh, we vented.

1404
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:19,600
All right.

1405
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:22,560
All right.

1406
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:24,320
It was just gas.

1407
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,680
It wasn't it wasn't.

1408
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,800
OK, S2100 Matt says you just delayed the game more with that idea.

1409
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,040
And Bobby says that's the Super Nintendo sequel.

1410
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,080
So all right, let's move on.

1411
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,640
Quest Buster, why do you need to roll a toilet paper right now?

1412
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:47,120
OK, let's talk about League of Legends.

1413
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:49,840
Maybe Riot Games will steal Among Us next.

1414
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:50,320
Who knows?

1415
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:54,960
Because Riot did just announce that they're putting out a new MMO that's going to be tied

1416
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:56,560
into the League of Legends universe.

1417
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:01,440
And it was it was done kind of without a ton of fanfare, which kind of surprised me.

1418
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:06,880
But there was a Twitter exchange going on where a VP at Riot, Greg Street, talked about how

1419
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:12,800
he's been helping to develop the League universe and that this new game he's working on, some

1420
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,640
might call it massive.

1421
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:16,960
And folks have been asking them to create it.

1422
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:22,160
And then, yeah, then there's like a follow up tweet that basically just says it very

1423
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:22,800
plainly.

1424
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,240
An MMO is coming.

1425
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:25,840
There's no teaser trailer.

1426
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:32,320
There's no non-gameplay trailer with concept art or whatever.

1427
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,360
There's nothing.

1428
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,760
Just, you know, we announce things on Twitter now.

1429
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:36,480
Why not?

1430
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,720
The government likes to announce policies on Twitter.

1431
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:42,240
So why don't we just drop game announcements casually on Twitter like they're nothing?

1432
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:44,320
I guess that's the world we live in now.

1433
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:48,480
But I know a lot of people will be very happy to hear this, to hear that the League of Legends

1434
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,920
universe is going to come to an MMO.

1435
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:50,880
It makes a lot of sense.

1436
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:56,400
And Riot has been trying to expand on that universe a little bit, you know, so like things

1437
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,320
like Dauntless and some of the other games they've been putting out.

1438
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:02,000
So this doesn't surprise me, really, to be honest.

1439
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,600
Yeah, so all right.

1440
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:10,400
Well, usually we would take a trip down memory lane to do the classic.

1441
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:11,760
Oh, Dark Soccer is on our way back.

1442
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:14,400
So I think we're going to get settled in here.

1443
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:20,640
OK, so anyway, so Dark Soccer, if you're back, you're back just in time.

1444
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:23,680
Because we're going to get into the classic game of the week.

1445
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:25,040
So good timing.

1446
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:25,840
Hopefully she's good to go.

1447
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,000
I forgot to turn off my cam.

1448
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,880
I noticed you turned it off and then back on somehow.

1449
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:31,680
So anyway.

1450
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:35,600
Yeah, no, I had an emergency party run.

1451
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:36,240
No worries.

1452
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:36,560
All right.

1453
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,320
We're into the classic game of the week tonight.

1454
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:42,080
Every week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault to find a game that she thinks, hey,

1455
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,640
you kids should be checking this game out.

1456
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,440
Stop playing.

1457
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:49,840
Stop playing Among Us and Fortnite and check out a real classic game.

1458
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:53,200
Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game for us.

1459
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,360
I do want to say, though, Dark Soccer, I don't know if you.

1460
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,520
It was something I noticed with the clip of this game.

1461
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:58,560
And I'll let you introduce in a minute.

1462
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,080
But I do just want to warn the listeners.

1463
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,360
There's a lot of flashing in it.

1464
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:05,200
So if you are somebody who's susceptible to flashes,

1465
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:08,480
you may wish to take a moment to minimize the window so you can just listen.

1466
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:12,400
The video will stop when Dark Soccer stops talking about it.

1467
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,720
But I noticed I was like, oh, there's a lot of flashes in this.

1468
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:15,920
I hope it's OK.

1469
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,280
I didn't get a chance to really watch it.

1470
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:18,960
I was actually looking for one that had sound.

1471
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:20,560
Oh, gotcha.

1472
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:22,100
Yeah.

1473
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,640
We were right in the middle of doing something,

1474
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:26,400
and I had to real quick find a video.

1475
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,080
No, I mean, that was the game.

1476
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:31,120
So I've never heard of this game causing problems.

1477
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:32,320
I just want to warn.

1478
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:35,920
If you do not like flashes for whatever reason,

1479
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:38,160
please avert your eyes now because I'm going to start the footage

1480
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:40,320
as soon as Dark Soccer says what the game of the week is.

1481
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:43,280
So the game of the week is called Arabian Fight,

1482
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:49,680
and it was released only in arcades by Sega in 1992.

1483
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:53,920
So it actually was released in January 1992.

1484
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:57,440
So the game was in development through 1991 and copyrighted then.

1485
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:02,080
So this is kind of your standard beat them up

1486
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,840
that went along with the other ones of its generation.

1487
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:08,880
You know, followed kind of like Golden Axe and Streets of Rage,

1488
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:11,920
three action buttons, one punch, one kick, one special attack.

1489
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,840
Although you have magic based attacks,

1490
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:18,960
kind of like how Golden Axe has its special attacks.

1491
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:23,040
You can also throw your opponents and you can collect items from chests

1492
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:28,400
as well as enemies to do different points,

1493
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:32,080
restore health, give you more of your special attack.

1494
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:38,240
The game actually does something a little bit unique for its era.

1495
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:44,800
Basically, with this game is it has these different scaling techniques

1496
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:49,760
to allow the characters to move back and forth in the field.

1497
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:53,280
So sort of think of Fatal Fury, you know,

1498
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:55,040
where you've got your different fields, you can jump back and forth.

1499
01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:03,680
And so it will use the foreground elements for special attacks.

1500
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:08,640
You can have characters perform their attacks very close to the screen

1501
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:11,920
so that only their head and torso fit, kind of like it's animated

1502
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:15,040
and different enemies can jump in from the foreground to fight.

1503
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:18,320
Although they can't be hit during these animated sequences.

1504
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:22,800
And it actually looks like, you know, like an interesting combination

1505
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,320
of a straight up animation and sprite based fighting.

1506
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:31,920
So basically with this game, I mean, it's really fairly simple.

1507
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,800
You play as one of four characters

1508
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:39,680
and you're trying to save the Princess Lurana

1509
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:43,360
from being attacked by a corrupt sheik.

1510
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:48,000
And so you have to travel to the castle to save the princess.

1511
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:57,600
But anyway, your main character is called Sinbat, not Sinbad,

1512
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,720
Ramaya, Goldor or Datta.

1513
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:03,600
Sinbat is the handsome hero.

1514
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:09,920
Ramaya is the token, beautiful, scantily dressed female of the game.

1515
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:14,560
Goldor is the muscle and the brute.

1516
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:19,680
And then Datta is a kind of spiritual looking bald dude.

1517
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:28,240
So it was listed for 1992 by Game Machine in Japan

1518
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:34,000
as being the most, as the seventh most successful table arcade unit of that year.

1519
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:36,400
Now I'm ringing this up because

1520
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:41,840
at SSA100MAT it's not Sinbad, it's Sinbat-T.

1521
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,320
And no, not Goldor from Power Rangers.

1522
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:55,920
So at any rate, the game is actually included on the Astra City Mini,

1523
01:31:56,560 --> 01:32:01,040
the little arcade cabinet being released with all these Sega games.

1524
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:08,720
And so there's a chance that people will be able to play it at home now,

1525
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:13,280
you know, instead of, you know, emulation or anything like that.

1526
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:19,280
Or, you know, MAME again emulation or actually owning a machine.

1527
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:22,400
Because I don't think it's been released on any home compilation.

1528
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,040
So there it is.

1529
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:26,720
Really quick one.

1530
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:27,520
But you know what?

1531
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:30,720
It's a neat game.

1532
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:31,520
It's a neat game.

1533
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:35,360
Yeah, I got to admit, this is not one I was super familiar with before.

1534
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:37,200
Let me take the game down here real quick.

1535
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:38,720
And so that, okay, oops.

1536
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:41,440
I got to the shot that doesn't have my co-host on it.

1537
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:45,200
So the game is now off the screen if you had looked away a moment ago.

1538
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:49,360
Again, I'm not aware of anything that that game caused or any problems,

1539
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:52,480
but I couldn't help when I was looking at the footage.

1540
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:55,440
I was like, oh, this seems like a lot of flashing.

1541
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:59,920
So I just I've admittedly been really over cautious, perhaps with recent events.

1542
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:04,160
Yeah, perhaps with recent events in the industry in the front of my mind.

1543
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:05,520
I was just cyberpunk.

1544
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:06,020
Yeah.

1545
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:07,840
I was just, you know what?

1546
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,760
I'm better safe than sorry when it comes to that stuff.

1547
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:11,600
But there's your classic game.

1548
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:15,040
But I have to say, it was not one I was super familiar with,

1549
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:19,680
but it definitely kind of did some interesting thing with the graphics there.

1550
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:22,560
It was like kind of like this kind of pseudo 3D effect

1551
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:27,200
that's very patently late 90s in it, which I thought was interesting.

1552
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:31,440
I really haven't seen too many other games that do that kind of thing,

1553
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:35,760
using the large sprites and animation as a foreground element.

1554
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:38,160
Not to that extreme.

1555
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:41,040
Like that game takes it to a real extreme.

1556
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:46,320
And I think it's really, really kind of refreshing for its time.

1557
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:47,120
Does that make sense?

1558
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:49,280
I think it would be that's going to be really fun.

1559
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:50,420
Yeah.

1560
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:51,440
All right.

1561
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:55,920
So I honestly would hope that Sega would consider doing some sort of

1562
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:59,040
like Switch release or something for that.

1563
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:00,340
Nice.

1564
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:05,120
I'm going to insert a story here, kind of a breaking story, if you will,

1565
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:08,080
before we get into rapid fire news, because this is about classic games.

1566
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:11,840
Here is something Bobby brought to my attention based on,

1567
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:16,000
get this, we got a YouTube comment because over at VoG Network,

1568
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,440
we actually have a YouTube channel.

1569
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,680
I'm going to admit we don't have a lot of OLR content on there,

1570
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:20,400
at least not right now.

1571
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:24,320
Going through the three hour episodes is a lot to go through to put stuff on YouTube.

1572
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:27,120
But Bobby has put some highlights from his show because he's only an hour.

1573
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,680
So he's put some highlights and some clips from his show up there.

1574
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:33,760
And one of them was that recently he built an outrun cabinet

1575
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:36,640
and he was showing kind of that and what that looked like.

1576
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:39,440
So it was the arcade one up outrun cabinet specifically.

1577
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,280
And he was showing that and that's over on YouTube.

1578
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:45,360
So cheap plug for Bobby's YouTube over VoG Network on YouTube.

1579
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:50,720
But we got a comment that said, oh, there's five games now.

1580
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:51,760
What?

1581
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:56,640
Because in the outrun cabinet that Bobby showed, there's only four games.

1582
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:59,280
And so there was a comment that said there's five games now.

1583
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:02,240
We'll get this over at arcadeoneup.com.

1584
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:07,360
They just announced they put out a firmware update for their outrun cabinet

1585
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,840
that has added a fifth game.

1586
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:13,760
Rad Rally is the new game that's been added to the outrun cabinet.

1587
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:17,280
This is the first time that something like this has been done.

1588
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:24,080
And this explains why potentially there was a USB port on the back of this cabinet

1589
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:26,960
that not all the arcade one up cabinets have had.

1590
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:29,440
Or maybe this is something we're going to see moving forward

1591
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:32,160
is that the USB stuff becomes kind of standard there.

1592
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:34,960
So kind of the breaking news there.

1593
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:41,440
Arcade one up flexing and now adding an additional game to an existing cabinet

1594
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:44,640
with Rad Rally having come to the outrun cabinet.

1595
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:47,120
And you got to love the chat.

1596
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:50,080
The chat is going, oh, it wasn't Spy Hunter.

1597
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:54,160
No, I imagine Spy Hunter will get its own cabinet

1598
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:55,600
when they're ready to put that game out.

1599
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:58,160
I'm not familiar with Rad Rally.

1600
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:02,800
Jamie, is that a title familiar to you

1601
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:04,880
and how that would fit into the outrun universe?

1602
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:09,200
We actually, it came up in conversation last night just from,

1603
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:11,200
gosh, what was it we were looking at?

1604
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:13,200
I think we were trying to watch something for Daytona 2.

1605
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:18,160
And there, well, because I like, I hate playing Daytona.

1606
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:21,200
I hate the attract mode, but I like all the rest of the music in it

1607
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:22,720
because that dude is so enthusiastic.

1608
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:29,360
But I think it was like a, a poster or something that we were looking at,

1609
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:31,840
just like a still picture for something.

1610
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:35,200
It might have been some cabinet art for Daytona 2

1611
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:38,320
that it didn't look like any of the cars in there.

1612
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:41,760
It was something sort of offhand and Dan brought up that game.

1613
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:44,160
Oh, it could be from that, you know, is what it looked like because,

1614
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:48,720
but I don't really remember the whole situation.

1615
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:49,280
I get it.

1616
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:50,960
So I'm looking at more information on it.

1617
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:56,560
It's actually Rad Mobile was a way that this game was often referred to.

1618
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:00,720
And also when it was ported to the Sega Saturn, it was called Gale Racer,

1619
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:03,120
but essentially it's all a very similar game.

1620
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:06,720
And they say that usually it is credit for Yu Suzuki.

1621
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:09,840
It does kind of fall into kind of the outrun family in that way.

1622
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:13,200
And now that I'm looking at it, I'm like, oh, okay, I have seen this before.

1623
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:17,680
So it's just kind of a racing game that had several different names with minor tweaks,

1624
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:18,880
but that's still very interesting.

1625
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:20,180
Kind of neat.

1626
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:22,160
So, all right.

1627
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:27,200
But yeah, I just, it's funny that that came up so randomly in our conversation last night.

1628
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:27,700
Yeah.

1629
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,760
Um, so, and then you mentioned, I was like, oh yeah, Dan, kind of,

1630
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,680
we had that kind of mentioned in, in passing.

1631
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:38,240
And Orange Right says Rad Rally was the sequel to Rad Mobile.

1632
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:40,080
So interesting, interesting.

1633
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:43,520
And Bobby says it's a micro USB port on the back of the cabinet.

1634
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:46,400
So if he wants to add the game, he has to get a little converter to do it.

1635
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:47,600
That's still pretty cool though.

1636
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:49,760
Very interested in that.

1637
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:53,120
Also, hey Bobby, and I'm going to totally use leverage the show.

1638
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:55,200
I meant to ask you this on the call earlier.

1639
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,440
Can you send me the link to where you bought your

1640
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:02,000
Mega 64, the large Commodore 64?

1641
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:02,880
Cause I want one.

1642
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,920
And when I went onto Amazon to get one, all I could find were the minis.

1643
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:11,200
And I think I found like one big one, but I think it might've been out of stock or it

1644
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:13,360
was from a seller name I didn't recognize.

1645
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:15,120
So I was like, is this a resale?

1646
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:15,920
I don't know what it is.

1647
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:18,960
So, um, uh, maybe they don't have it anymore.

1648
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:23,200
I don't know, but I, uh, I'm just going to ask very nicely for that link.

1649
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:23,520
All right.

1650
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:26,320
Cause I want one as a Christmas present to myself.

1651
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:33,200
Let's what was the, um, what was the, the version of rad mobile that came out on Saturn?

1652
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:35,520
I'm just trying to double check something real quick.

1653
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:36,480
Gale racer.

1654
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:37,520
I think I closed the window.

1655
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:39,060
Yeah.

1656
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:39,520
Yeah.

1657
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:40,400
That's what I'm looking for.

1658
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:43,680
There are, there are, they're all technically different games, but they're just kind of

1659
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:46,720
all like spiritual, like, you know, related.

1660
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:49,520
So, yeah, that was the one I was trying to think of.

1661
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:49,840
Got it.

1662
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:50,720
All right.

1663
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:54,800
Uh, let's get to some rapid fire news and some other news around the industry pretty

1664
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:55,360
quickly here.

1665
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:55,860
Loki.

1666
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:57,840
Yeah.

1667
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:03,520
So we've got, um, some more news about control, which is coming, getting a PlayStation five

1668
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:10,160
and Xbox series X and S version with ray tracing that's coming in February on the second.

1669
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:15,920
Um, and then it's going to also have a full retail release on March 2nd.

1670
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:22,880
Um, they're going to have a performance mode, which runs at 60 FPS on both platforms.

1671
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:29,120
Well, I guess the standard version is going to run 30 FPS, but will allow for ray tracing.

1672
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,680
So kind of the standard fare that we've been getting with some of these newer games.

1673
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:40,880
Just remember though, you have to, um, purchase the ultimate edition in order to be able to

1674
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:46,080
get the Xbox series S and X upgrade and PlayStation five upgrade.

1675
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:53,360
So that's annoying because we're unfortunately unable to offer an upgrade path to all existing

1676
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:54,720
control players.

1677
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:57,920
That is a bunch of crap because they accidentally released it.

1678
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:01,440
So that is wrong.

1679
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:04,560
Um, but that is what they're sticking by.

1680
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:09,840
So if you feel it's worth it, honestly, I will just wait for it to hit game pass.

1681
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:17,120
Um, and then cyberpunk 2077 is getting a crossover with death stranding.

1682
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:18,640
Um, Mars is a death strand.

1683
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:24,160
He's got a crossover with cyberpunk, which makes sense since a Kojima did have a cameo

1684
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:26,400
in cyberpunk 2077.

1685
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:26,800
Oh, really?

1686
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,560
But apparently, yes, he did.

1687
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:30,080
Uh, he is in the game.

1688
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:36,960
Um, so you'll be able to get a few different things there, including a silver hand cybernetic

1689
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:37,280
arm.

1690
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:45,440
Um, also there's some, uh, cyberpunk themed holograms and a selection of customization

1691
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,800
and clothing options.

1692
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:53,360
And in addition, you can also equip Sam with a new hacking ability, which allows him to,

1693
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:57,440
um, mess with sensor poles and mule tracks and stuff.

1694
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:01,360
So that's, uh, coming to PC right now.

1695
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:07,200
They haven't announced any sort of, um, update to the PlayStation four version, but at least

1696
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,400
PC is going to be getting that.

1697
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:15,680
And as Joe and Matt saying, you can still unlock the car from cyberpunk in horizon four,

1698
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:16,180
I believe.

1699
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:17,360
Yes.

1700
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:18,080
Oh, that's right.

1701
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:18,480
Yeah.

1702
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:18,980
Yeah.

1703
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:23,600
And I've been seeing that death stranding, um, cyberpunk, uh, thing being promoted in

1704
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:28,160
the Epic game store, because, uh, you know what, despite the fact that we talk, um, a

1705
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:33,520
significant amount of shit about Epic on this show, sometimes look, I love ZZT.

1706
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:34,640
There's something nice.

1707
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:38,720
And I also love free games and they've been giving away a lot of them.

1708
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:41,600
So just a reminder, if you haven't been going in there and getting your free game every

1709
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:43,120
day, uh, get on that.

1710
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:45,680
They'll probably be something real good in the coming days.

1711
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:49,840
Um, usually I think it was last year when they gave away like civ six on the last day

1712
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:50,240
or something.

1713
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:52,560
I remember there was something big they gave away at one point.

1714
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:54,400
Um, so keep an eye on that y'all.

1715
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:55,680
All right.

1716
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:59,440
Meanwhile, though, the other rapid fire news I had for you guys, Jason referenced this

1717
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:00,320
in the intro tonight.

1718
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:01,200
Thank you, Jason.

1719
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:07,280
Uh, but guitar freaks and drum mania, if you will, has officially been released for PC.

1720
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:11,120
Now we talked a little bit about the beta test prior, uh, but the official release has

1721
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:13,520
now come out at least in Japan.

1722
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:18,160
Um, not a big fan of these games, not coming out in the U S I know Jason addressed the

1723
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:20,480
music licensing thing at the top of the show.

1724
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:23,920
Still a little bit disappointing, uh, at least that the originals can't make their

1725
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:25,840
way into some type of U S version.

1726
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:29,680
Uh, but it's probably harder to release games in the U S when you've closed all your U S

1727
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:30,560
offices.

1728
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:35,200
Um, still, if you are the type that is fine reading, uh, enough Japanese to get through

1729
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:40,880
this and you use the Konami online or the Kona suite, uh, uh, online, uh, there's probably

1730
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:45,200
going to be a lot here for you, including over 200 songs that is from the arcade version

1731
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:46,160
of Ghidadora.

1732
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:50,160
Uh, it's a very true to arcade experience, which I would expect it to be cause it's arcade

1733
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:52,960
machines basically run on modified PCs of sorts.

1734
01:42:52,960 --> 01:43:00,960
Uh, and uh, yeah, it's, uh, this, the online service for this game will run you 1,628 yen

1735
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:01,440
a month.

1736
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,360
That's about 15 bucks.

1737
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:05,760
So kind of what you'd pay for an MMO, I suppose.

1738
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:06,880
Yeah, it's not bad.

1739
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:12,560
Um, so check that out music game fans, if that is up your alley and you don't mind having

1740
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:15,440
to do it all in Japanese and they also have a controller.

1741
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:16,960
Oh, that's right.

1742
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:17,200
Yeah.

1743
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:19,200
They got a PC controllers coming out.

1744
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:24,640
That's not going to turn into something, uh, where somebody puts out a freemium type of

1745
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:26,000
thing that uses those controllers.

1746
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,600
I'm sure like a step mania type of thing.

1747
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:30,560
Right.

1748
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:30,880
Yeah.

1749
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:35,760
And well, I'm sure that it looks already very much like a rock band controller or guitar

1750
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:36,960
hero controller.

1751
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,880
Um, and it's expensive.

1752
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:40,480
350 bucks basically.

1753
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:41,840
You know what they need to do?

1754
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:43,200
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1755
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:44,480
You know what they need to do though?

1756
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:48,400
If it looks like one of those controllers, how about putting out a controller that works

1757
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:49,360
with rock band?

1758
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:51,120
Because it's kind of funny.

1759
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,640
Now everybody used to have those plastic instruments shitting up their house everywhere.

1760
01:43:57,280 --> 01:44:01,360
So many of those have been thrown away or gone to the used market or what have you.

1761
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:06,320
Now that like rock band four is backwards compatible, at least on Xbox for sure.

1762
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:08,160
I'm pretty sure it is on PS5 as well.

1763
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:12,240
I don't see why it wouldn't be, uh, people kind of want those plastic instruments again.

1764
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:15,760
They want to be able to play those games again with the instruments and you can't really

1765
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:20,000
do it, uh, without buying, you know, really now, now people are charging an arm and a

1766
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:20,960
leg for those things.

1767
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:22,800
So, uh, probably sell mine.

1768
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:26,240
I mean, well, yeah, if you're not using them, somebody will buy them.

1769
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:28,880
So anyway, just an interesting aside.

1770
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:31,120
I thought I'd kind of bring up cause it's related.

1771
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:37,200
Uh, also worth noting, uh, Hey, uh, we talked previously about during the game awards, Sephiroth

1772
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:40,960
was going to be released as a new character in smash brothers.

1773
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:42,400
When is that going to happen?

1774
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:46,240
Well, for many people, it has already happened because if you can beat him into challenge

1775
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:49,760
mode, even if you do it on Bobby Black Wolf mode, that is very easy mode.

1776
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,200
You will earn Sephiroth.

1777
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:53,520
So most people that really want them have them.

1778
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:56,480
For everybody else, I think it's the 23rd, the 22nd.

1779
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:58,640
Eh, most of you are probably already in there playing with them.

1780
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:03,600
Also, some Mii fighters came out with that, which is pretty cool, but this is, this is

1781
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:04,480
the really funny thing.

1782
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:04,720
Okay.

1783
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:05,600
You ready?

1784
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:08,480
The Mii fighters that came out to go along with Sephiroth.

1785
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,640
Barrett makes sense, right?

1786
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:11,840
Final Fantasy character.

1787
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,760
Tifa, Final Fantasy character.

1788
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:15,600
Aerith, Final Fantasy character.

1789
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,440
Chocobo with a little hat, right?

1790
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:18,720
Cute, Final Fantasy character.

1791
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:21,040
And then the last one that came out, Geno.

1792
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:22,800
That's right.

1793
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:24,800
Geno is now in smash brothers.

1794
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:25,760
Yes.

1795
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:31,440
The beloved super Mario RPG character of all time finally made his way to smash brothers

1796
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:32,640
as a Mii costume.

1797
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:37,680
That's unfortunate.

1798
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:42,480
And the internet fanboys shed a tear for their obscure character that will never come.

1799
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:43,520
Waluigi says hi.

1800
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:45,920
No, Waluigi says,

1801
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:50,400
Now it can be my turn.

1802
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:53,200
All right.

1803
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:57,520
Anyhow, moving on, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

1804
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:01,760
Um, well, some pinball news, which has kind of been,

1805
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:05,280
people have been polarized actually over this.

1806
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:11,360
I've been chatting with some people, but the new stern game that was announced is Led Zeppelin,

1807
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:12,480
which I don't know.

1808
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:15,760
I'm kind of tired of them doing all these like band games.

1809
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:19,680
I mean, but getting the license for Led Zeppelin, that's pretty cool.

1810
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:21,680
And on top of that, it's a Steve Ritchie table.

1811
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:26,640
And Steve is known for his fast action type of games.

1812
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:31,440
I mean, he did Black Knight, Black Knight 2000, Black Knight Sword of Rage,

1813
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:35,840
the newer Star Wars that came out.

1814
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:38,480
So he's known for his fast tables.

1815
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:42,720
And I think it looks pretty good.

1816
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:47,040
I mean, you've got your usual multiple versions of it.

1817
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:52,640
So there is the, you know, the regular production one.

1818
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:56,960
There is the pro and then there's the premium limited edition.

1819
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:59,520
And then you can also get accessories to go for the table.

1820
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:02,880
So, um, I don't know.

1821
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:07,200
I know people who are planning on getting it and I'll play theirs when it comes out.

1822
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:10,240
I'm not in a hurry for it myself, but hey, it's Led Zeppelin.

1823
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:14,400
So also SNK is getting a little bit, uh,

1824
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:22,400
Teasy, they have, uh, teased a console coming out in 2021.

1825
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:31,280
That quote is a system to bridge the needs between passionate fans and console gaming enthusiasts.

1826
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:40,240
So I'm wondering if we might be getting some sort of, uh, AES MVS, like

1827
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:44,800
machine, I guess I have like maybe multiple carts or something, or have the cartridges be on

1828
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:49,920
smaller cartridges and release that simply just for the SNK items.

1829
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:54,000
They had the mini 50 in one, and then they released their own version.

1830
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,920
It's not officially arcade one up.

1831
01:47:55,920 --> 01:48:00,560
It's a clone, basically another company that has like 50 games in it.

1832
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:02,640
So I, but it's ramulated.

1833
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:03,520
Okay.

1834
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:03,840
Yeah.

1835
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:06,000
And this could be something maybe uses cartridges.

1836
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:06,400
I don't know.

1837
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:10,160
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

1838
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:15,680
it's interesting, but I don't know.

1839
01:48:15,680 --> 01:48:17,520
I mean, it can be interesting.

1840
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:21,440
It depends on, uh, on, you know, when they put out more information about it.

1841
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:27,600
Uh, but yeah, I think that, that, uh, I mean, I still would just rather have had like an

1842
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:30,320
all-in-one MVS AES and be done with it.

1843
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:31,200
So we'll see.

1844
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:31,680
Yeah.

1845
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:34,400
I'd like to see that kind of come back, but we'll see.

1846
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:34,640
Yeah.

1847
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:35,600
All right.

1848
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:37,280
Cartridges the size of your head.

1849
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:40,400
That's a cartridge that could kill somebody.

1850
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:43,040
Honestly, I'm not that heavy, but yeah.

1851
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:44,640
All right.

1852
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:45,440
Then you're not using it.

1853
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:45,840
Right.

1854
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:46,160
All right.

1855
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:49,040
Uh, and Dr.

1856
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:52,480
Sues is maybe same idea as their arcade thing, but a console instead.

1857
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:56,000
Either way, it's sure to be better than the VCS.

1858
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:56,800
Just saying.

1859
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:57,200
All right.

1860
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:03,120
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates, which I imagine it's finally

1861
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:08,400
going to start to get quiet this week, seeing as, Oh, it's Christmas this week.

1862
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:12,240
But this has been a weird year all around the board.

1863
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:13,440
So what's coming out this week?

1864
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:16,000
Loki, not a ton of things.

1865
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,040
So you're right.

1866
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:22,880
Um, so double dragon neon on the Nintendo switch, uh, override to super mech league

1867
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:29,280
on PC, Nintendo switch PlayStation four PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series X, uh, super meat

1868
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:32,080
boy forever on PC and Nintendo switch.

1869
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:37,280
Who's your daddy on PC, Mac and Xbox one.

1870
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:43,440
And then last but not least we have, um, actually, no, I take that back.

1871
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:49,600
So we're going to have, looks like, uh, the Hong Kong massacre on Nintendo switch.

1872
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:53,760
And then the last but not least is earth defense force world brothers.

1873
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:59,200
That's that voxel cutesy earth defense force games coming to Nintendo switch and PlayStation

1874
01:49:59,200 --> 01:49:59,840
four.

1875
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:00,560
Neat.

1876
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:01,200
That's it.

1877
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:01,680
All right.

1878
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:02,960
That's it for the year.

1879
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:03,760
That's it for the year.

1880
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:04,080
All right.

1881
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:06,480
Traveling to Japan and checking out the releases there.

1882
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:09,280
Uh, it's, it's a little different Christmas, a little different there.

1883
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:13,360
So here's some games that you can play while you enjoy your cake, uh, on the Nintendo switch

1884
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:16,960
this week, earth defense force world brothers, like Loki just mentioned is out in Japan as

1885
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:17,120
well.

1886
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:24,960
And the 24th fight of gods also out, uh, sniper elite for vampire with a Y, uh, is out, uh,

1887
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:30,240
also the Alistair collection, uh, and metal max Zeno.

1888
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:36,000
Um, and the, uh, that's a peripheral, uh, that's it, but there's, Oh, next week, I'm

1889
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,600
going to spoil next week's just cause I want to get dark soccer's reaction to the fact

1890
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:41,280
that I'm on new year's Eve.

1891
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:44,000
Digimon survive is coming out on the switch in Japan.

1892
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:44,640
That's kind of fun.

1893
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:51,680
Dark soccer was really the only person I knew who, who stand Digimon, um, and maybe

1894
01:50:52,640 --> 01:51:00,880
Digimon zero two, um, that the whole first era Digimon Digimon zero two and, uh, uh,

1895
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:02,000
Digimon try.

1896
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:02,400
Gotcha.

1897
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:05,920
Um, the PlayStation four, pretty similar story.

1898
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:09,920
You're at defense for swirl brothers, vampire, the Alistair collection.

1899
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:12,960
Um, uh, all that same stuff also on the PlayStation four.

1900
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:14,800
So those are your releases for this week.

1901
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:15,600
How about the UK?

1902
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:19,600
Dark soccer is only one, only one.

1903
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:23,520
And it is overdrive to ultimate deluxe edition.

1904
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:31,520
That's it on the 22nd, which is in a day in the UK very soon.

1905
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:33,360
All right.

1906
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:34,800
We have some more stories for you guys.

1907
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:38,720
Then we'll get to the listener round table, but first, uh, Loki.

1908
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:40,400
Yeah.

1909
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:46,880
So, uh, as we've, I don't know, it's, it's just the game industry, I guess, but, you

1910
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:51,520
know, we talked about shady reviews and stuff and not, um, revealing all the information

1911
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:54,880
when, uh, we were talking about cyberpunk and that type of thing.

1912
01:51:54,880 --> 01:52:01,280
Well, now game companies are wisening up to the fact that game reviews come out.

1913
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:04,400
People purchase the game space on those initial reviews.

1914
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:09,200
And sometimes they don't like hearing about how there's microtransactions in the game.

1915
01:52:09,200 --> 01:52:10,160
So what did they do?

1916
01:52:10,160 --> 01:52:15,360
If you're Ubisoft, you wait a month before you start selling those really egregious microtransactions.

1917
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,560
And that's what they do with it.

1918
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:25,120
Or you wait until right before the Chris McQuanzica holiday season, when this gift is going to

1919
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:26,640
start showing up for people.

1920
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:28,400
And that's when you pull the trigger.

1921
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:30,960
And this isn't new for them.

1922
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:33,680
They've done sort of XP booster type things before.

1923
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:38,960
But now Assassin's Creed Valhalla, they've, I guess, updated the game to include them.

1924
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:46,400
And it's going to leave you, um, $10 lighter if you decide to purchase it and it'll allow

1925
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:50,240
you to earn 50% more experience.

1926
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:57,200
And it's, uh, you know, I don't know, clearly.

1927
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:58,080
I mean, I get it.

1928
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:02,080
Sometimes people are in a hurry to play a game and stuff like that, and they don't want

1929
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:07,120
to, um, you know, work through whatever.

1930
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:10,000
But, you know, back in the day that used to be like cheats and stuff.

1931
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:16,640
And let's be honest, if, if this is the type of thing that you like doing, I might suggest

1932
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:20,160
getting a PC because you can just cheat without paying $10.

1933
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:26,960
You can just increase, you know, your levels or whatever, without having to shell out money

1934
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:28,640
for something that would normally be free.

1935
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:30,560
Just use modifications.

1936
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:31,520
Exactly.

1937
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:37,600
You can get double XP and titties in your game through the magic of mods.

1938
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:40,720
This is not the first time, like I said, that they've done this.

1939
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:42,320
They did this in Odyssey as well.

1940
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:48,800
And they had denied before that boosters, um, didn't influence the design of the game.

1941
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:54,880
They, they, they basically say they didn't throttle the game, um, based on this stuff.

1942
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:58,400
However, you may remember there was also, you know, the Lord of the Rings game that

1943
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:06,240
came out that they did like, and a lot of these games do increase the grind to allow

1944
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:10,000
you to, um, be more motivated to purchase these.

1945
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:16,960
So they may say it that didn't influence it, but it influenced it.

1946
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:19,840
Quest busters, uh, quest buster, excuse me, in chat is pointing out.

1947
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:23,200
Um, Oh, come on the experience boost for 10 bucks for Valhalla.

1948
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:24,800
It's not really necessary.

1949
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:28,240
So kind of pointing out that, you know, for this game, it's probably not needed.

1950
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:30,560
Odyssey's leveling was glacial though.

1951
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:32,640
There was definitely a difference there versus origin.

1952
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:38,800
So kind of interesting how you may not need it, but they'll still sell it to you.

1953
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:40,480
Exactly.

1954
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:45,200
Speaking of things that they're going to sell to you as a subscription to their Ubisoft,

1955
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:46,720
uh, game service.

1956
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:51,680
So Ubisoft plus of course, you know, that $15 service that, uh, basically like the EA

1957
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:52,720
play stuff.

1958
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:56,560
Well, now they're going to be offering it to stadia users as well.

1959
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:57,360
So that's right.

1960
01:54:57,360 --> 01:55:00,800
Not only do you get the pay for stadium, but you can also pay for this as well.

1961
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:05,280
If you want to play all these different Ubisoft games, I guess that's slightly better than,

1962
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:14,320
um, pain for each individual game with stadia as that's not very, um, good, uh, value as

1963
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:14,800
it is.

1964
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:20,240
But I mean, this is slightly better, I guess, but it is something that they are offering

1965
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:21,840
because, you know, they want all the money.

1966
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:22,560
So why not?

1967
01:55:24,240 --> 01:55:24,720
Why not?

1968
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:26,160
All right.

1969
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:26,560
Yeah.

1970
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:30,480
Well, let's move on and talk about that streaming service that y'all are going to play this

1971
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:34,880
game on and complain about this DLC on just like we're doing right now here on lovely

1972
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:38,800
Twitch and a Twitch has announced a variety of policy updates this week.

1973
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:41,840
In fact, you've probably been seeing some of them scroll across the bottom for those

1974
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:45,040
of you that are, uh, watching live on Twitch this week.

1975
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:48,720
Um, and, uh, yeah, it has to do with some big policy updates.

1976
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:50,960
They did a town hall earlier this week.

1977
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:54,720
Finally, they had promised that and they did the town hall and they talked about some,

1978
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:59,600
recent policy changes and they address some things about the DMCA sexual harassment ads

1979
01:55:59,600 --> 01:56:01,120
and some of those other issues.

1980
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:07,120
Um, but what was interesting is kind of what everybody kind of was talking about after

1981
01:56:07,120 --> 01:56:14,880
the fact was Twitch has decided to ban words like simp in cell and Virgin, but when used

1982
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:17,360
in derogatory contexts.

1983
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:20,480
So, I mean, like if I was talking about deserve to be

1984
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:29,840
Well, if I'm talking about the Virgin Mary at Christmas or something, then that's, I,

1985
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:30,400
that's fine.

1986
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:36,000
Cause I'm not using it in a derogatory manner, but if I'm calling somebody a Virgin who can't

1987
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,360
drive, then that is using it in a derogatory manner.

1988
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:44,160
But how is Twitch going to understand context of stuff?

1989
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:48,000
Because that's a great question that I think they should answer.

1990
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:55,440
Cause I, if I'm going to guess, I'm going to say they can't because most of these platforms,

1991
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:59,760
when it comes to banning people for different things, you know, they'll cite that you're

1992
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:06,240
violating their rule, but it may be, you know, in the context of it, it may not be egregious.

1993
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:12,400
Um, so I don't all of a sudden believe that they're going to start applying context to

1994
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:12,720
this.

1995
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:15,920
I think they're just going to straight up, just ban it altogether.

1996
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:20,240
In fact, I'm going to stop you because we don't want misinformation out there.

1997
01:57:20,240 --> 01:57:21,520
They did clarify.

1998
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:24,160
These words are not blanket banned.

1999
01:57:24,160 --> 01:57:29,200
They will only incur penalties when they quote negatively refer to another person's sexual

2000
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:30,240
practices.

2001
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:33,760
It does sound like it is.

2002
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:38,320
And Twitch is kind of adding it to their utility belt of reasons.

2003
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:44,000
We could ban you if you're being a douche nozzle in someone's chat, then we can say,

2004
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,880
well, you're not supposed to use words like that in a negative context.

2005
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:50,080
You called somebody a virgin who can't drive in their chat.

2006
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:52,000
And so you're, you're banned for that.

2007
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:56,160
Cause you were in general, you were being an asshole, but this specifically is why you

2008
01:57:56,160 --> 01:57:57,200
got the ban.

2009
01:57:57,200 --> 01:58:02,320
I, I, I kind of feel like that's what they're doing, but I'm not disagreeing with either

2010
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:05,360
of you either because there's so much of it that's subjective.

2011
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:09,600
And how do we know that this is going to be applied appropriately across the board?

2012
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:09,920
Right.

2013
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:14,560
So, um, it should be noted they've already been, uh, removing emotes.

2014
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:20,160
So, um, that's why you don't have a VoG network simp emote is that we're not allowed to have

2015
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:20,480
them.

2016
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:22,320
And it wasn't something we wanted anyway.

2017
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:23,360
Um, but.

2018
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:28,720
We, there, there have been channels that had emotes and, uh, they're no longer there and

2019
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:29,920
they don't approve new ones.

2020
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:35,440
Um, now some people are still calling out some of the other problems that are still

2021
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:40,880
hap- happening on Twitch, such as you can still walk into people's chat and say slurs

2022
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:42,320
with little to no action.

2023
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:46,960
And, uh, where was the, where is the outrage that people are having over these words?

2024
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:48,080
Simp, Incel, and Virgil.

2025
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:52,640
Where was that outrage when black and female streamers were complaining about being harassed

2026
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:53,520
on Twitch?

2027
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:59,440
That comment from a streamer DaPurpleSharpie, where was Twitch's we need to stop harassment

2028
01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:00,400
stance then?

2029
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:03,120
So fair question.

2030
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:11,120
Um, I guess one could say at least they're trying, but this almost goes back to what

2031
01:59:11,120 --> 01:59:15,360
we said at the top of the show with the Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft thing.

2032
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:17,920
It's one thing to put out a statement.

2033
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:20,480
It's another to take the actions to back it up.

2034
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:24,960
And I think that's where we're at here with the Twitch thing.

2035
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:29,440
It, okay, how nice that you have a policy now and you are putting on this front of taking

2036
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:30,720
things seriously.

2037
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:37,200
But until you put the actions behind it to make folks like DaPurpleSharpie feel more

2038
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:44,560
welcome on Twitch, as opposed to the unnecessary bullshit that streamers have to put up with

2039
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:50,160
sometimes, um, then if we just think it's all lip service and I get that.

2040
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:57,360
So I think we need to see Twitch, you know, really do something, uh, besides just, oh,

2041
01:59:57,360 --> 02:00:01,200
we're going to ban for these certain words, like actually do them.

2042
02:00:01,200 --> 02:00:05,920
So, well, here's the funny thing too, is like, like after this announcement came out, there

2043
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:12,880
was actually, um, one of the, uh, team members of, I guess the Atlanta phase who go, his

2044
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:13,760
name is Simp.

2045
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:19,760
And so he's like, uh, I have like some issues with this idea.

2046
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:25,680
Well, but, but also this is also, I honestly, Loki, like I get that, but I think this is

2047
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:30,400
a problem where people are fixated on the headline and the headline going around is

2048
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:32,880
Twitch has banned Simp in cell version.

2049
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:40,160
People aren't reading the fucking article and noticing that it's banned when used in

2050
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:44,800
certain contexts and there's no blanket robot ban on those words.

2051
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:52,640
So that guy who called himself Simp is not by context breaking the rule just by existing.

2052
02:00:53,440 --> 02:01:01,040
It's if somebody decides to take it to a place where they're making fun, you know, then I

2053
02:01:01,040 --> 02:01:05,440
feel like people are reacting to a headline only without really looking at the details

2054
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:05,920
of it.

2055
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:07,040
And that works both ways.

2056
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,360
So, sure.

2057
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:09,680
All right.

2058
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:15,520
Sia Tabiri in chat says, share, you're a Simp in cell virgin who can't drive.

2059
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:21,040
That'll be the remake, Sia Tabiri, the unavoidable remake of Clueless.

2060
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:26,640
I hope, I hope some of you caught my reference there to the holy text of the great Alicia

2061
02:01:26,640 --> 02:01:27,520
Silverstone classic.

2062
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:27,920
Thank you.

2063
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:28,720
Thank you, Dark Sakura.

2064
02:01:28,720 --> 02:01:29,920
I knew if anyone would.

2065
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:30,480
All right.

2066
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:32,960
Rest in peace, Brittany Murphy, Forever in Our Hearts.

2067
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:34,560
All right, moving on.

2068
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:36,240
Let's get to some other stuff.

2069
02:01:36,240 --> 02:01:36,880
Dark Sakura.

2070
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:45,440
Well, we had talked a little bit about, you know, safety and trying to ban whatever.

2071
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:49,840
So we have news from Afghanistan.

2072
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:53,840
They've banned PUBG and called for regulation of video games.

2073
02:01:53,840 --> 02:02:01,280
As the Afghanistan Telecom Regulatory Authority, the ATRA announced that they decided to ban

2074
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:06,080
PUBG temporarily after a comprehensive assessment.

2075
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:11,840
They held meetings with various ministries like their religious affairs, education, public

2076
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:17,840
health, communications and science, psychologists, parents, headmasters of schools, telecom,

2077
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:23,360
civil activists and PUBG gamers before submitting a report to the authority board.

2078
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:28,800
And the quote, the decision was taken to block this game on a temporary basis, considering

2079
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:30,880
social and security perspectives.

2080
02:02:32,160 --> 02:02:37,920
ATRA continues investigations and consultations to find out a permanent solution there, too.

2081
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:45,600
They were saying that the games have negative impacts on children,

2082
02:02:46,160 --> 02:02:54,320
um, that they want to provide support for games that comply with Afghan and social culture,

2083
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:56,080
as well as religious values.

2084
02:02:56,720 --> 02:02:59,840
And so the ban, well, they didn't say so.

2085
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:02,240
It also would apply to, I think, all iterations of PUBG.

2086
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:10,560
And they've now joined the list of other countries like Nepal, Iraq, Jordan, Pakistan, India,

2087
02:03:11,120 --> 02:03:20,000
um, to prevent in some places said negative effects or to be harmful for society and would

2088
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,880
also cause a potential national security threat.

2089
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:34,160
In Pakistan, the ban was temporary with the Islamabad High Court lifting that ban later.

2090
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:41,040
Um, the country, though, in India, there are things saying that their ministry of electronics

2091
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:47,040
and I.T. were alleging that the game was stealing user data in an unauthorized manner for servers

2092
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:48,480
outside of India.

2093
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:51,280
So there you go.

2094
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:52,000
Interesting.

2095
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:56,400
A very real reaction from S.H.A. 100 Matt in our chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network,

2096
02:03:56,400 --> 02:04:00,080
who says the folks who care will fire up those VPNs to play.

2097
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:01,120
Yeah.

2098
02:04:01,120 --> 02:04:03,840
So kind of go outside the ban using that.

2099
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:05,520
And that's that's for sure.

2100
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:09,840
But not every day you hear about a country banning a video game.

2101
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:11,520
So interesting nonetheless.

2102
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:13,760
So all right.

2103
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:14,800
Well, let's move on.

2104
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:15,300
Loki.

2105
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:18,020
All right.

2106
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:24,720
So we it's been a couple of weeks since the game awards, but we have some of the kind

2107
02:04:24,720 --> 02:04:25,840
of numbers and everything.

2108
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:29,920
So not surprising because everybody's stuck at home.

2109
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:36,800
Viewership has increased by 83 percent, and that was over eight point three million viewers

2110
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:39,120
that tuned into the game awards this year.

2111
02:04:39,120 --> 02:04:43,600
So pretty, pretty decent size event, I think.

2112
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:49,520
And so that was all coming from Jeff Keighley on Twitter talking about the viewership for

2113
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:50,000
that.

2114
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:54,800
And of course, you know, I expect it to be even bigger next year.

2115
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:56,160
So pretty awesome.

2116
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:02,560
Yeah, I think you're right that probably the stay at home probably played into that a lot.

2117
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:04,640
There's just more people in general watching TV.

2118
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:07,760
But I think there is something to be said about this particular award show is getting

2119
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:08,880
a lot more credit.

2120
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:12,880
And I think a lot more of the co-streaming is helping, too.

2121
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:15,920
Like, I'm not just saying that to toot our own horns here at VOG Network, but I think

2122
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:20,560
there's a lot of people out there that are creating an event out of this like a watching

2123
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:25,040
event, you know, similar to, you know, an E3 press conference or some other type of

2124
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:30,240
big event watching and doing it live is very important, because if you're not watching

2125
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:33,040
it live, you're going to get it all spoiled for you on Twitter and the newsletter.

2126
02:05:33,040 --> 02:05:36,560
So I think it has become kind of event watching in that regard.

2127
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:42,640
And I think even, you know, when we look at next year and, you know, hopefully by December

2128
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:48,000
some sense of normalcy returning that you're still going to see that this does very well.

2129
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:53,280
So I know I'll still be watching and we'll probably still do another live react like

2130
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:54,240
we did last time.

2131
02:05:54,240 --> 02:05:55,200
It was fun.

2132
02:05:55,200 --> 02:05:55,700
Yeah.

2133
02:05:56,480 --> 02:05:56,980
All right.

2134
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:02,000
For our last story tonight, you knew I had to talk about this at some point because this

2135
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,200
was one of those.

2136
02:06:03,200 --> 02:06:05,600
Maybe I would have chosen my words differently, Doug.

2137
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:07,680
Let's talk about this.

2138
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:09,280
So this was in the interview.

2139
02:06:12,160 --> 02:06:14,960
Yes, I don't know why I saved this one for last night.

2140
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:20,560
I feel like sometimes in the B block, we don't really have, like, great big things

2141
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:21,680
to comment on.

2142
02:06:21,680 --> 02:06:23,760
So I was like, let's save this one for last.

2143
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:32,880
So, Doug, let's talk about what you said this week and who I'm referring to is the Nintendo

2144
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:35,920
of America president, Doug Bowser.

2145
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:38,080
You'll never be Reggie Fils-Aime.

2146
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:38,880
You'll never.

2147
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:41,280
You're just a, you're a CEO.

2148
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:42,800
No one will have the Reggie jawline.

2149
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:44,800
You're a CEO who can't drive.

2150
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:47,840
All right, look, Doug, I'm just being an asshole.

2151
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:54,000
Like, Doug Bowser is fine, but this particular quote in this particular interview and this

2152
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,200
particular answer to this particular question ain't it.

2153
02:06:58,160 --> 02:06:59,280
So what am I talking about?

2154
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:01,200
So he did an interview with Polygon.

2155
02:07:02,240 --> 02:07:04,880
There's a whole other thing I could talk about, but I'm not going to tonight.

2156
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:07,520
He did.

2157
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:13,520
I'm going to just start calling him Porygon, like the really crappy looking Pokemon.

2158
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:20,000
So Bowser did an interview with Porygon and he was talking about special releases like

2159
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,920
Super Mario 3D All-Stars.

2160
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:28,400
And basically the question that came up was, you know, what, what, why are you doing this?

2161
02:07:28,400 --> 02:07:29,680
Why are you end dating?

2162
02:07:29,680 --> 02:07:32,480
It seems like you guys really like March 31st.

2163
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:36,640
You're not going to let people buy Mario 3D All-Stars after that fact and, you know,

2164
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:38,800
Super Mario 35, you know.

2165
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:41,600
So how does Mr. Bowser respond to this?

2166
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:45,920
I think I use a simple word, celebration.

2167
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:52,720
It's just, this is a celebration of Mario's 35th anniversary and we wanted to celebrate

2168
02:07:52,720 --> 02:07:54,880
in unique and different ways.

2169
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:59,680
And we've done that through games like Super Mario 3D All-Stars, or we will be doing that

2170
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:04,320
through future releases like Super Mario 3D World and Bowser's Fury.

2171
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:06,800
That wasn't the question, Doug.

2172
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:13,680
That wasn't an opportunity to sell more copies of Super Mario 3D World, Doug.

2173
02:08:13,680 --> 02:08:16,960
It's not about celebration, Doug.

2174
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:21,840
It's about why are you stopping to sell these games on March 31st?

2175
02:08:23,120 --> 02:08:28,080
So there are various ways that we're celebrating Mario's 35th and with some of these titles,

2176
02:08:28,080 --> 02:08:33,440
we felt it was an opportunity to release them for a limited period of time.

2177
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:35,200
They've done very, very well.

2178
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:39,440
In other words, you stupids bought it.

2179
02:08:44,240 --> 02:08:47,760
Roll credits because that's what it boils down to.

2180
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:51,280
The celebration is we made a lot of fucking money.

2181
02:08:51,920 --> 02:08:53,600
That's the celebration.

2182
02:08:54,240 --> 02:08:59,680
We found when we artificially create shortages that it drives up sales.

2183
02:08:59,680 --> 02:09:03,120
And so now we're moving that to digital products is what he meant to say.

2184
02:09:05,600 --> 02:09:06,800
Shall I continue with a quote?

2185
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:07,520
Oh, yes, I will.

2186
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:14,240
Super Mario 3D All-Stars has sold over 2.6 million units in the US alone.

2187
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:18,880
And so clearly consumers have been able to jump in and enjoy that.

2188
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:22,400
And it's not strategy that we're going to be using widely.

2189
02:09:23,600 --> 02:09:26,320
Notice how he says they might use it again, though.

2190
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:32,560
But it's one we thought was very unique for the actual anniversary.

2191
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:35,520
Yes, Doug, I would call it unique.

2192
02:09:36,240 --> 02:09:37,840
That's a good word.

2193
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:41,360
Oh, Doug, I'm just going to, like, start using Doug.

2194
02:09:41,360 --> 02:09:47,680
Like I don't know why I've decided to just call him Doug.

2195
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:49,200
But that is that is where I'm at.

2196
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:51,440
That is the reaction I had to this whole thing.

2197
02:09:51,440 --> 02:09:56,640
OK, I propose from here out that any time someone in the video game industry

2198
02:09:56,640 --> 02:09:57,680
says something stupid.

2199
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:00,640
They're Doug, like a Karen.

2200
02:10:01,200 --> 02:10:03,200
Sure, Doug.

2201
02:10:03,200 --> 02:10:03,760
You know what?

2202
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:07,200
An amazing 90s Nickelodeon cartoon you are not.

2203
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:10,160
No, you are not quail man.

2204
02:10:10,160 --> 02:10:11,440
Look, here's the thing.

2205
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:15,680
And again, I know I sound like I'm just dumping on him based on this one bad quote.

2206
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:20,720
But this is this is the shit that really annoys us about Nintendo is.

2207
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,440
It's a celebration.

2208
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:27,040
No, it's not as you did this to sell more copies of the game.

2209
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:30,240
And in this interview, you are basically saying it worked.

2210
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:31,600
You bought it, suckers.

2211
02:10:32,160 --> 02:10:37,200
But he can't really say that because Doug is the president of Nintendo.

2212
02:10:37,200 --> 02:10:45,520
And so Doug cannot just say, well, we did this so we would sell as much as possible

2213
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:50,080
this fiscal year with our kind of weaker than usual holiday lineup,

2214
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:55,520
because that's that's not an answer Doug can give Doug.

2215
02:10:55,520 --> 02:11:04,640
Let's see what our our commenters have to say over at twitch.tv.

2216
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:05,360
You okay over there?

2217
02:11:06,160 --> 02:11:12,320
Yeah, I just keep knocking into my thing and I'm showing my gym teacher Dean Winchester.

2218
02:11:13,200 --> 02:11:13,440
Okay.

2219
02:11:14,240 --> 02:11:15,120
To cleanse the palette.

2220
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:19,680
Phoenix7726 says, well, Doug is no Reggie.

2221
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:24,480
Questbuster says it's a celebration of sales numbers.

2222
02:11:25,120 --> 02:11:27,760
Sia Tabiri says, now I have Patty.

2223
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:30,240
You're the mayonnaise for me stuck in my head.

2224
02:11:30,240 --> 02:11:31,040
You're welcome.

2225
02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:35,280
And for the record, that's the only kind of mayonnaise I tolerate is mayonnaise named Patty.

2226
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:38,480
I like mayonnaise on a patty.

2227
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:41,600
And sj100 matt says this isn't funny, Doug.

2228
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:48,480
And sj100 matt says you get no points and may God have mercy on your soul, Doug.

2229
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:53,520
I'm just gonna stick with okay, Doug.

2230
02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:56,160
That's now a thing, but it's a thing in my head.

2231
02:11:56,160 --> 02:11:56,880
It was a thing.

2232
02:11:56,880 --> 02:11:58,400
It was a thing I heard.

2233
02:11:58,400 --> 02:11:58,800
All right.

2234
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:01,680
Thanks for letting us know, Doug.

2235
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:04,400
All right.

2236
02:12:05,200 --> 02:12:07,840
Anyhow, let's get to the listener roundtable.

2237
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:14,720
If you want to say, okay, Rob, I have a question for you or Jamie or Matt.

2238
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:15,920
What's your question?

2239
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:17,440
You can ask that now in our chat room.

2240
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:20,960
It's the listener roundtable we have via chat and emails.

2241
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:22,800
Every week we invite you guys to email us.

2242
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:25,200
Participate at orangelandtrader.com.

2243
02:12:25,200 --> 02:12:28,640
If you'd like to send us an email letting us know your thoughts for the week.

2244
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:30,480
I don't know if we had anything tonight,

2245
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:33,840
but I will ask the queen of the mailbag dark Sakura what she found.

2246
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:36,480
Oh, two emails.

2247
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:37,680
And one of them is from me.

2248
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:39,360
Oh, how nice.

2249
02:12:40,160 --> 02:12:40,400
Yep.

2250
02:12:41,040 --> 02:12:41,680
Hey, Jamie.

2251
02:12:41,680 --> 02:12:43,600
Just a follow-up email from last week.

2252
02:12:43,600 --> 02:12:44,880
See from me.

2253
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:46,400
I finally started Animal Crossing.

2254
02:12:46,480 --> 02:12:48,880
I got to say I'm pretty hooked for some reason.

2255
02:12:48,880 --> 02:12:52,240
I am having an issue where the holiday ornaments will spawn in my trees.

2256
02:12:52,240 --> 02:12:54,080
So I can't craft any holiday stuff.

2257
02:12:54,080 --> 02:12:57,040
I've tried to time travel and try to fix it, but nothing.

2258
02:12:57,040 --> 02:12:58,080
Please don't time travel.

2259
02:12:58,720 --> 02:13:02,960
It seems like every video I find people who already have Isabella unlocked and I don't have her yet.

2260
02:13:04,080 --> 02:13:06,640
I guess she is the one who makes the holiday announcements.

2261
02:13:06,640 --> 02:13:07,120
True.

2262
02:13:07,120 --> 02:13:07,680
Any ideas?

2263
02:13:07,680 --> 02:13:09,520
I hope to visit your island soon and check it out.

2264
02:13:11,280 --> 02:13:12,320
Happy holidays, everyone.

2265
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:14,160
This is from Frodo Swagons.

2266
02:13:14,160 --> 02:13:16,960
The thing is, is that you're not going to be able to do it yet in your own village.

2267
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:27,360
You get the recipes after you have the town center and get more of the DIYs and stuff.

2268
02:13:27,360 --> 02:13:28,960
So you do need Isabel.

2269
02:13:29,680 --> 02:13:37,920
However, I would be more than happy to make you the things that I can if you want to.

2270
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:39,680
I think I got your friend code.

2271
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:45,040
Message me on Twitter, because that's really where I spend most of my social online time.

2272
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:47,280
It's at Dark Sakura.

2273
02:13:47,280 --> 02:13:48,400
S-A-K-U-R-A.

2274
02:13:49,680 --> 02:13:57,680
And we'll work out a time for you to come over and shake my trees, get my ornaments.

2275
02:13:57,680 --> 02:13:59,600
That's very nice of you to offer.

2276
02:13:59,600 --> 02:14:03,520
But yeah, that was to say, that's what my gut was saying, too.

2277
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:08,000
Even though I haven't played Animal Crossing in a few months, I've abandoned my poor villagers.

2278
02:14:08,720 --> 02:14:11,200
You probably got roaches in your house.

2279
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:11,700
Probably.

2280
02:14:13,680 --> 02:14:14,180
What?

2281
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:20,720
I was just gonna say, it's probably the whole, like, it takes 10 days or is it 14 to really

2282
02:14:20,720 --> 02:14:21,920
get your town up and running.

2283
02:14:21,920 --> 02:14:26,400
And that's probably the issue is that that time gating in the beginning is probably stopping

2284
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:27,760
all the events from unlocking.

2285
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:31,680
Unfortunately, it's just not a great time to start, unfortunately.

2286
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:36,880
But you have a great answer there is that if you can't do it in your town, you go to

2287
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:37,760
someone else's town.

2288
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:40,320
You get to do a full cycle of the year, though.

2289
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:44,240
The thing is that you're still not going to be able to get those DIYs unless someone gives

2290
02:14:44,240 --> 02:14:44,740
them to you.

2291
02:14:45,360 --> 02:14:47,600
And I think you're only getting one per.

2292
02:14:48,400 --> 02:14:53,760
So if I happen to somehow get any, because I make Dan give me all the ones that he finds

2293
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:58,720
because I haven't been able to find any myself, let me know.

2294
02:14:58,720 --> 02:15:00,080
I will save what I can for you.

2295
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:05,200
Catch snowflakes in the meantime, if you can catch snowflakes in your early village.

2296
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:13,680
And I'll make you like a snowflake door ornament or a few things that I can with the, you know,

2297
02:15:13,680 --> 02:15:18,960
like a ski wall or something or an iceberg floor, something like that.

2298
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:23,440
I'm still wanting more of those like the holiday decor.

2299
02:15:23,440 --> 02:15:26,800
I mean, even though it's like not my fucking holiday, I'm kind of sick of it already.

2300
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:29,760
Not saying that other people enjoy it.

2301
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:31,840
I just don't like the Jesus stuff.

2302
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:36,160
Um, but I like trees and I like lights and I like all of that.

2303
02:15:36,160 --> 02:15:41,360
So if anyone also gets those recipes and do you do what some of my friends do and call

2304
02:15:41,360 --> 02:15:42,480
them a Hanukkah bush?

2305
02:15:42,480 --> 02:15:44,560
Because I always thought that was no, I do not know.

2306
02:15:44,560 --> 02:15:46,880
That's honestly the stupidest thing I've ever heard of.

2307
02:15:47,680 --> 02:15:48,720
I had a friend who did that.

2308
02:15:48,720 --> 02:15:49,440
I thought it was funny.

2309
02:15:50,080 --> 02:15:55,600
Oh, the thing is, is that and I actually kind of got into it on my Facebook with somebody

2310
02:15:55,600 --> 02:16:01,760
about that big house that was lit up for Hanukkah is that it's kind of like Hanukkah is not

2311
02:16:01,760 --> 02:16:02,800
a big holiday.

2312
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:04,400
It's like pretty tiny.

2313
02:16:05,280 --> 02:16:13,440
And on top of that, it's like, it's kind of not the best thing to try to turn a holiday

2314
02:16:13,440 --> 02:16:19,920
that has nothing in common with, you know, Christmas or all the shit that goes with Christmas

2315
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:21,040
into something that it's not.

2316
02:16:22,160 --> 02:16:22,720
I get it.

2317
02:16:22,720 --> 02:16:23,280
Yeah.

2318
02:16:23,280 --> 02:16:25,600
Like, you know, it's, it's, it's,

2319
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:27,440
this only happened because of kids, right?

2320
02:16:27,440 --> 02:16:30,800
They didn't want kids to feel left out during this, during this part of the year.

2321
02:16:31,520 --> 02:16:33,040
And non-practicing Jews.

2322
02:16:33,040 --> 02:16:33,760
Yeah, I get it.

2323
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:34,240
I get it.

2324
02:16:34,240 --> 02:16:37,520
But the other thing too, is it like, there's this whole commandment about assimilation

2325
02:16:37,520 --> 02:16:38,880
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2326
02:16:38,880 --> 02:16:43,920
Um, because I mean, technically, if you're looking at Christmas, it's a pagan holiday

2327
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:46,000
that was co-opted by early Christians.

2328
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:56,480
So just saying, you know, um, but at the same time, uh, Hanukkah is, I think the only celebrated

2329
02:16:56,480 --> 02:16:59,200
holiday that is not at all in Torah.

2330
02:16:59,840 --> 02:17:01,520
It came from the book of the Maccabees.

2331
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:07,280
And that was, it's more biblical Apocrypha instead of actual Torah.

2332
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:09,920
And there's your Judaism lesson of the season.

2333
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:10,320
Thank you.

2334
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:11,520
All right.

2335
02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:14,960
But I like it because I can set shit on fire and eat potatoes.

2336
02:17:14,960 --> 02:17:20,400
Who knew that an Animal Crossing email would set the only year on Orange L'Andrea.

2337
02:17:20,400 --> 02:17:21,040
Next email.

2338
02:17:22,720 --> 02:17:23,280
All right.

2339
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:26,160
But yeah, Frodo Zwagens just messaged me on Twitter.

2340
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:33,520
Anyway, um, the only other email that we got is Dear OLR, I hope you are all well and managing

2341
02:17:33,520 --> 02:17:38,160
to stay in chipper spirits, even if we may not be able to spend the holidays with companies

2342
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:39,440
would want to this year.

2343
02:17:39,440 --> 02:17:42,480
Personally, this year has been a good time to escape to video games.

2344
02:17:42,480 --> 02:17:46,720
I found myself lately not wanting to leave a game behind right after beating it, which

2345
02:17:46,720 --> 02:17:48,240
brings me to my question.

2346
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:52,160
Are there any games you found yourself so invested in you made it a point to 100% to

2347
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:52,960
complete them?

2348
02:17:53,600 --> 02:17:59,040
In the last couple of days, I got the platinum trophy for God of War, my second platinum

2349
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:01,520
as my first was Nier Automata.

2350
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:07,200
This game was an interesting case because when I started it, I was very half interested.

2351
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:09,360
I thought it would be a slog to get through it.

2352
02:18:09,360 --> 02:18:13,600
And then the story started to really draw me in once some new characters were introduced

2353
02:18:13,600 --> 02:18:16,960
and the world took on a scale I had previously underestimated.

2354
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:21,440
I felt the need to explore all of it, taking on some challenging bosses in the process

2355
02:18:21,440 --> 02:18:23,200
that were incredibly thrilling to fight.

2356
02:18:24,560 --> 02:18:28,320
I will go ahead and pause at that point in the email and say I was like that with Mass

2357
02:18:28,320 --> 02:18:28,720
Effect.

2358
02:18:28,720 --> 02:18:31,520
And then I started doing boundary breaks and trying to see actually how the game was put

2359
02:18:31,520 --> 02:18:32,020
together.

2360
02:18:33,040 --> 02:18:36,160
But I never bothered for platinums on anything.

2361
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:39,600
I usually like, you know, I jump from one game to another.

2362
02:18:39,600 --> 02:18:40,960
I've talked about that a lot on this show.

2363
02:18:40,960 --> 02:18:45,040
It's not often that I get in that mode where I'm like, I will do everything I possibly

2364
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:45,840
can in this game.

2365
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:50,480
Oddly enough, the MMOs kind of end up working that way for me, even though I'll never

2366
02:18:50,480 --> 02:18:51,120
reach the end.

2367
02:18:51,680 --> 02:18:54,960
It's kind of one of those that's and that's maybe why I don't have all the platinum

2368
02:18:54,960 --> 02:18:56,160
trophies to show for it.

2369
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:57,760
As you guys, oftentimes it's the MMOs.

2370
02:18:58,480 --> 02:19:02,480
But I remember one distinctly was Diablo 3 when that came out.

2371
02:19:02,480 --> 02:19:03,680
That was your jam for a while.

2372
02:19:03,680 --> 02:19:04,400
Oh, my God.

2373
02:19:04,400 --> 02:19:05,520
Like, I don't know what happened.

2374
02:19:05,520 --> 02:19:07,920
I was just like, I will get a platinum in this fucking game.

2375
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:09,200
I will get that trophy.

2376
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:09,760
And I did.

2377
02:19:10,400 --> 02:19:12,400
And then they decided to release more trophies.

2378
02:19:12,400 --> 02:19:16,880
So it's funny, even though I have the platinum trophy in Diablo 3, I do not have all the

2379
02:19:16,880 --> 02:19:20,160
trophies because I never bought the Necromancer expansion on PlayStation.

2380
02:19:20,720 --> 02:19:22,880
So it's kind of one of those interesting little.

2381
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:27,200
Oh, I got I got something that I really shouldn't have because I don't have every trophy.

2382
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:37,440
But I did this time kick for a little while where I was trying to get different different

2383
02:19:37,440 --> 02:19:38,400
weird achievements.

2384
02:19:38,400 --> 02:19:44,720
And well, remember when I was trying to get, like, the book achievements and getting, like,

2385
02:19:44,720 --> 02:19:49,600
different like masking potions or whatever to make it into, you know, or sneaking in

2386
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:51,040
through the sewers to get to.

2387
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:54,880
Why can't I think the under city?

2388
02:19:54,880 --> 02:19:56,480
Yeah, that's a great example, though.

2389
02:19:56,480 --> 02:19:57,840
Achievements in the MMOs.

2390
02:19:57,840 --> 02:20:03,040
I do hunt that stuff because, you know, in like in WoW, you would get titles or maybe

2391
02:20:03,040 --> 02:20:04,720
little pets for certain ones.

2392
02:20:04,720 --> 02:20:06,400
And it's the same thing of Final Fantasy.

2393
02:20:06,400 --> 02:20:08,720
Like, there's a lot of minions as your title.

2394
02:20:08,720 --> 02:20:09,680
Yeah, exactly.

2395
02:20:09,680 --> 02:20:12,560
So, yeah, I hunt that stuff in MMOs all the time.

2396
02:20:12,560 --> 02:20:15,760
So I just like the really the really fun, crazy ones.

2397
02:20:15,760 --> 02:20:20,320
But the challenging one for me was getting all of the on an alliance character, getting

2398
02:20:20,320 --> 02:20:21,920
the reading material and under city.

2399
02:20:22,800 --> 02:20:23,600
Loki, what about you?

2400
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:25,040
Is there anything where you sat down?

2401
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:27,040
You said I will fully complete this game.

2402
02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:30,880
There's I don't know.

2403
02:20:30,880 --> 02:20:37,440
Like, I think maybe like a lot of the Lego games all end up getting everything in.

2404
02:20:39,520 --> 02:20:41,440
I don't know if I've done it for Saints Row, though.

2405
02:20:41,440 --> 02:20:44,640
I think there's been some tedious missions that I haven't been able to do.

2406
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:48,560
And then there's also some stuff I think we have to play the game fully co-op, which

2407
02:20:48,560 --> 02:20:49,440
I haven't done.

2408
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:56,080
And also in some games like Saints Row 2, it's impossible because a lot of it had its

2409
02:20:56,080 --> 02:21:00,000
humans that had to do with online play, which doesn't exist anymore.

2410
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:00,500
So.

2411
02:21:02,400 --> 02:21:05,040
Yeah, I think it's just mainly like the Lego games and stuff.

2412
02:21:07,520 --> 02:21:10,240
All right, moving on with the email, then.

2413
02:21:10,240 --> 02:21:13,440
Actually, though, I did have another one that I'm kind of doing it in, and that is Animal

2414
02:21:13,440 --> 02:21:13,940
Crossing.

2415
02:21:14,960 --> 02:21:19,360
Not necessarily their achievements, but there are a lot of I'm trying to finish like some

2416
02:21:19,360 --> 02:21:20,960
of the Nook Mile stuff.

2417
02:21:22,320 --> 02:21:23,200
For the Nook Points.

2418
02:21:24,320 --> 02:21:28,080
So like the redecorating my house a certain number of times, catching certain fish, and

2419
02:21:28,080 --> 02:21:30,080
I'm trying to fill out my inventory.

2420
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:38,080
So I want to have as complete of a catalog as I can and try to get all the fish and all

2421
02:21:38,080 --> 02:21:44,560
of the I already have like a full museum for my fossils, but I want all the artwork.

2422
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:50,160
So it's more like a personal one for me, but I also get my Nook achievements with it.

2423
02:21:50,160 --> 02:21:55,040
So great example, because Animal Crossing and Nintendo in general doesn't have platinum

2424
02:21:55,040 --> 02:22:00,320
trophies or achievements, but it has its own kind of system built into the game.

2425
02:22:00,320 --> 02:22:01,920
So you're kind of working on that.

2426
02:22:01,920 --> 02:22:06,960
Yeah, I kind of don't really give a shit about it, like on a system level, if that makes

2427
02:22:06,960 --> 02:22:11,840
sense, like I don't really care about any character or personal achievement, because

2428
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:15,600
honestly, my life is worth more than what a video game tells me it is.

2429
02:22:16,560 --> 02:22:20,640
So, but for me, this is just something fun that I do to add a little bit more replayability

2430
02:22:20,640 --> 02:22:21,600
to the game.

2431
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:28,800
So to continue on with the email, this year also has had me return to older games to 100%

2432
02:22:28,800 --> 02:22:29,600
them.

2433
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:34,560
I did things like finally getting all 100 gold skulltulas in Ocarina of Time, as well

2434
02:22:34,560 --> 02:22:38,960
as getting the 120 stars in the Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Galaxy.

2435
02:22:38,960 --> 02:22:40,960
Anyway, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.

2436
02:22:40,960 --> 02:22:44,000
Season's greetings and many game beatings, Garth Wolf.

2437
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:45,440
I love that.

2438
02:22:45,440 --> 02:22:46,640
I'm stealing that dude.

2439
02:22:46,640 --> 02:22:47,760
Many game beatings.

2440
02:22:47,760 --> 02:22:48,260
Love that.

2441
02:22:48,800 --> 02:22:50,800
I am actually putting that on my freaking Twitter.

2442
02:22:52,240 --> 02:22:54,800
That is like the coolest thing that I've seen all day.

2443
02:22:54,800 --> 02:22:55,520
All right.

2444
02:22:55,520 --> 02:22:56,320
Thanks for the email.

2445
02:22:57,600 --> 02:22:58,480
Yeah, thanks Garth.

2446
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:00,960
Party on Garth.

2447
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:06,480
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for the future here

2448
02:23:06,480 --> 02:23:07,280
on the show.

2449
02:23:07,280 --> 02:23:08,240
Let me get to chat.

2450
02:23:08,240 --> 02:23:10,160
I thought I saw a question way back.

2451
02:23:10,160 --> 02:23:12,880
We started talking about the, oh, here we go.

2452
02:23:12,880 --> 02:23:15,200
No one special with a round table question for us tonight.

2453
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:19,200
With all the miscellaneous storefronts having started their holiday sales or about to start

2454
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:23,680
them, are any of you planning on getting that one game that you've been eyeing for a while

2455
02:23:23,680 --> 02:23:24,000
now?

2456
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:25,920
If you are, what game?

2457
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:28,880
Oh, I know no one special loves to talk about sales and discounts.

2458
02:23:29,840 --> 02:23:30,800
Good question though.

2459
02:23:30,800 --> 02:23:34,320
Is there something I've been holding out for on a particular sale?

2460
02:23:35,440 --> 02:23:41,120
I've had, this may shock you, but there's like just a lot of weird shit has been, 2020

2461
02:23:41,120 --> 02:23:42,400
has like warped my mind.

2462
02:23:42,960 --> 02:23:46,640
So like all of a sudden I'm super into the Pokemon mainline games.

2463
02:23:46,640 --> 02:23:47,760
When was that going to happen?

2464
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:48,320
Right.

2465
02:23:48,320 --> 02:23:52,640
But the other thing I've had my eye on, I kind of really want to get Mortal Kombat 11.

2466
02:23:53,600 --> 02:24:00,080
So I'm waiting for like the rights, like, but I want the all in one and done package,

2467
02:24:00,080 --> 02:24:03,760
like all the characters, all the story.

2468
02:24:03,760 --> 02:24:08,720
I want one fucking game with it all, which I think is just Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate,

2469
02:24:08,720 --> 02:24:09,840
if I'm not mistaken.

2470
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:13,760
So I'm kind of waiting that to hit the sweet spot and then I'll probably pick it up and

2471
02:24:13,760 --> 02:24:15,600
look away when the fatalities happen.

2472
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:18,480
But I mean, as a fighter game, those games are really solid fighters.

2473
02:24:19,040 --> 02:24:23,040
Um, and I'll wait for an injustice, which will be more up my alley.

2474
02:24:24,080 --> 02:24:27,840
So, um, that's my answer to that.

2475
02:24:27,840 --> 02:24:29,920
Anything you guys are holding out on a good sale for?

2476
02:24:34,240 --> 02:24:36,880
Some stuff I want is actually on sale right now.

2477
02:24:36,880 --> 02:24:42,480
Um, on Steam, um, it's just, it's hard for me to sit down and play anything on my computer

2478
02:24:42,480 --> 02:24:44,400
with some of the back problems I've been having lately.

2479
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:49,760
Um, but like Wadham just got its release and I really wanted to play that.

2480
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:53,840
Um, and, uh, Death Stranding is on sale.

2481
02:24:53,840 --> 02:24:55,600
Hold on, I'm actually looking at my wishlist right now.

2482
02:24:56,400 --> 02:25:01,440
Um, because I got, yeah, Detroit Become Human actually, I think was on sale briefly, but

2483
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:05,120
yeah, Wadham is on and it's on sale for like 10 bucks.

2484
02:25:05,760 --> 02:25:06,260
Nice.

2485
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:07,540
Purchased.

2486
02:25:08,340 --> 02:25:15,300
Um, Epic store has given out those $10 gift card or $10, uh, discounts or whatever.

2487
02:25:15,300 --> 02:25:20,740
And basically if you downloaded city skylines, which is free, um, you got 10 bucks.

2488
02:25:21,300 --> 02:25:22,820
So I don't know.

2489
02:25:22,820 --> 02:25:29,300
I was looking at, um, that last, the harmonics game that you just released, but yeah, fuser.

2490
02:25:29,300 --> 02:25:29,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2491
02:25:29,860 --> 02:25:31,060
I've been looking at it too.

2492
02:25:31,060 --> 02:25:33,060
It's still like, it's still $49.

2493
02:25:34,020 --> 02:25:38,260
And like, I looked at all the DLC and stuff and I'm like, eh, that's so expensive.

2494
02:25:38,260 --> 02:25:40,340
So I may wait on that.

2495
02:25:40,340 --> 02:25:46,820
So, you know how I said I really wanted to do a, um, uh, make a, uh, visual novel.

2496
02:25:48,340 --> 02:25:51,860
And, you know, visual novel maker is like for the whole thing is like 70 bucks.

2497
02:25:51,860 --> 02:25:52,980
Oh, is it on sale?

2498
02:25:53,700 --> 02:25:55,460
75% off.

2499
02:25:56,340 --> 02:25:57,140
You better get on that.

2500
02:25:57,940 --> 02:25:58,440
Yeah.

2501
02:25:58,900 --> 02:25:59,400
Nice.

2502
02:25:59,400 --> 02:26:00,520
I'm going to go broke.

2503
02:26:00,520 --> 02:26:03,480
So maybe my, my book will end up being a visual novel.

2504
02:26:03,480 --> 02:26:06,600
If, uh, somebody wants to help me with your artwork.

2505
02:26:06,600 --> 02:26:07,100
Nice.

2506
02:26:07,100 --> 02:26:11,080
Ooh, I should look in some of that, um, game making software, even though we all know I

2507
02:26:11,080 --> 02:26:12,600
don't have the attention span to do it.

2508
02:26:12,600 --> 02:26:15,560
I'm always kind of looking at that stuff, uh, on steam.

2509
02:26:15,560 --> 02:26:19,240
I'm sure a lot of it's, uh, going on deep discount here and Alan probably has.

2510
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,720
I would just wait for like humble bundles, man.

2511
02:26:23,720 --> 02:26:27,000
They've got so many things that they offer on there.

2512
02:26:27,560 --> 02:26:32,520
Um, like discounts for different, like game making things and like tools.

2513
02:26:32,520 --> 02:26:37,080
In fact, that that's where I was going right now is I was trying to see and like, do I

2514
02:26:37,080 --> 02:26:38,360
have that already?

2515
02:26:38,360 --> 02:26:41,000
Because I very well may have that already.

2516
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:44,600
I'm going to, I'm actually going to, I'm going to ask Alan real quick.

2517
02:26:44,600 --> 02:26:46,200
Cause he's a big PC gamer.

2518
02:26:46,200 --> 02:26:52,040
Um, I won't make him come on cam cause he's not dressed for it, but, um, he just gave

2519
02:26:52,040 --> 02:26:53,880
me this look that was really funny.

2520
02:26:53,880 --> 02:26:55,720
Is there any, yes, I am right.

2521
02:26:55,720 --> 02:27:01,800
Is there any steam sale, any steam game that you're looking forward to since, you know,

2522
02:27:01,800 --> 02:27:04,760
you're, you're playing Skyrim again right now.

2523
02:27:04,760 --> 02:27:07,640
That's, you know, games like what, 10 years old at this point.

2524
02:27:07,640 --> 02:27:12,120
Um, is there anything you've kind of been waiting for the right sale on a game before

2525
02:27:12,120 --> 02:27:13,160
you finally jump into it?

2526
02:27:14,680 --> 02:27:18,120
He's thinking Witcher three, maybe he's suggesting.

2527
02:27:18,680 --> 02:27:19,080
Yeah.

2528
02:27:19,080 --> 02:27:22,200
I mean, you know, now the CD project reds finally moved on.

2529
02:27:22,200 --> 02:27:23,720
They got a whole other problem.

2530
02:27:23,720 --> 02:27:26,360
I think it's safe to say nothing further will be done on Witcher threes.

2531
02:27:26,360 --> 02:27:26,840
There's that.

2532
02:27:26,840 --> 02:27:27,320
Okay.

2533
02:27:27,320 --> 02:27:27,820
Yeah.

2534
02:27:28,280 --> 02:27:34,040
There's a, there's actually some pretty interesting sales, like moonlighter, uh, vigil, uh, resident

2535
02:27:34,040 --> 02:27:36,200
evil resistance, oxygen not included.

2536
02:27:36,200 --> 02:27:37,880
Those all seem to be on sale.

2537
02:27:40,440 --> 02:27:40,920
All right.

2538
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:41,420
Neat.

2539
02:27:42,280 --> 02:27:42,780
All right.

2540
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:47,480
Well, if that's it, then I think we're getting down to last minute stories.

2541
02:27:47,480 --> 02:27:51,720
I don't know if we have any of those before we wrap it all up, uh, dark soccer or Loki.

2542
02:27:52,280 --> 02:27:52,600
Yeah.

2543
02:27:52,600 --> 02:27:53,100
Yeah.

2544
02:27:54,120 --> 02:27:54,620
Yeah.

2545
02:27:55,080 --> 02:27:59,160
So let's talk back about, uh, cyberpunk again.

2546
02:27:59,160 --> 02:28:00,520
Oh, apparently cyberpunk.

2547
02:28:01,160 --> 02:28:02,840
Cyberpunk has a problem.

2548
02:28:04,040 --> 02:28:05,400
They have a dildo problem.

2549
02:28:06,280 --> 02:28:12,360
Distracting number of dildos are apparently appearing in the game as a problem or feature

2550
02:28:14,360 --> 02:28:19,640
both little call may little call and be surrounded by dicks all the time.

2551
02:28:19,640 --> 02:28:20,440
I mean, seriously.

2552
02:28:21,240 --> 02:28:27,800
So apparently they're going to be fine tuning that to see if they can, um, uh, tone it down

2553
02:28:27,800 --> 02:28:30,280
a bit, but yeah, it is.

2554
02:28:30,280 --> 02:28:33,640
It's something, well, in certain districts in the game, they have like a red light district

2555
02:28:33,640 --> 02:28:39,640
that, you know, that stuff's everywhere, but yeah, it's, it's silly.

2556
02:28:42,040 --> 02:28:42,680
All right.

2557
02:28:42,680 --> 02:28:44,760
Anything else besides dildo updates?

2558
02:28:45,640 --> 02:28:46,440
That's it.

2559
02:28:46,440 --> 02:28:46,680
All right.

2560
02:28:46,680 --> 02:28:48,440
Oh, well, that's a good note to end on.

2561
02:28:48,440 --> 02:28:48,940
All right.

2562
02:28:49,900 --> 02:28:51,500
Let's wrap it up then.

2563
02:28:51,500 --> 02:28:54,460
Uh, final thoughts and good night time.

2564

02:29:12,700 --> 02:29:16,700
So help us spread the word, tell a friend or two about the show, leave us a nice review

2571
02:29:16,700 --> 02:29:20,220
wherever it is you found the show and, uh, really appreciate that.

2572
02:29:20,220 --> 02:29:26,940
And of course, um, since we don't have another show until I think the 26th, no 27th will

2573
02:29:26,940 --> 02:29:31,420
be the next show, um, have, have a good holiday, whether it already passed or whether it's

2574
02:29:31,420 --> 02:29:33,980
upcoming, uh, hope everybody's having a good holiday.

2575
02:29:33,980 --> 02:29:37,100
And I know everybody's kind of starting their vacations too.

2576
02:29:37,100 --> 02:29:41,580
Um, please be safe, uh, just because there is a vaccine that doesn't mean the pandemic

2577
02:29:41,580 --> 02:29:41,980
is over.

2578
02:29:42,620 --> 02:29:44,460
Um, they're giving it to all the rich people.

2579
02:29:44,460 --> 02:29:45,180
Yes, that's true.

2580
02:29:45,180 --> 02:29:46,620
They're giving it to all the rich people first.

2581
02:29:47,340 --> 02:29:50,460
Um, so please, uh, please stay safe.

2582
02:29:50,460 --> 02:29:52,620
Um, I'm not doing anything for the holidays this year.

2583
02:29:52,620 --> 02:29:53,820
We canceled all our plans.

2584
02:29:53,820 --> 02:29:55,580
I don't want to do anything.

2585
02:29:55,580 --> 02:29:59,980
So, um, you know, uh, I'll be catching up on some games, maybe try to pour some of that

2586
02:29:59,980 --> 02:30:01,660
energy into creative stuff.

2587
02:30:01,660 --> 02:30:05,180
Um, maybe try to make some more, you know, videos on demand and things like that.

2588
02:30:05,180 --> 02:30:05,900
We'll see.

2589
02:30:05,900 --> 02:30:07,660
Um, so just be safe guys.

2590
02:30:07,660 --> 02:30:10,300
Uh, anyway, let's get everybody's actual final thoughts here.

2591
02:30:10,300 --> 02:30:16,940
Um, I guess I pretty much gave mine, but I will elaborate and say, oh, this holiday

2592
02:30:16,940 --> 02:30:20,220
would be a great time to start a marathon game of civilization.

2593
02:30:20,220 --> 02:30:21,500
I think maybe that's something I'll do.

2594
02:30:21,500 --> 02:30:23,260
Cause I actually have the time to do it.

2595
02:30:23,260 --> 02:30:25,100
Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?

2596
02:30:25,980 --> 02:30:27,980
Uh, just gonna be working more on my game.

2597
02:30:27,980 --> 02:30:30,780
So I'm keep, keep on working on that.

2598
02:30:31,660 --> 02:30:32,300
Great.

2599
02:30:32,300 --> 02:30:34,540
And last but not least, Stark soccer, your final thought.

2600
02:30:34,540 --> 02:30:42,700
I attempted to give you a Duolingo, uh, uh, subscription for Japanese.

2601
02:30:43,340 --> 02:30:43,660
Nah.

2602
02:30:43,660 --> 02:30:45,500
Um, I don't know.

2603
02:30:45,500 --> 02:30:48,140
Um, actually I do have one.

2604
02:30:48,140 --> 02:30:49,660
Be kind to people.

2605
02:30:49,660 --> 02:30:53,660
Don't assume that just because someone looks like they're able-bodied, that they're not

2606
02:30:53,660 --> 02:30:58,060
dealing with some difficulty or disability or something really hard in their life.

2607
02:30:58,700 --> 02:31:00,220
Um, just be kind.

2608
02:31:00,780 --> 02:31:01,260
That's all.

2609
02:31:01,260 --> 02:31:01,900
Be kind.

2610
02:31:02,460 --> 02:31:03,420
Be kind to other people.

2611
02:31:03,420 --> 02:31:04,460
Be kind to yourself.

2612
02:31:05,340 --> 02:31:05,740
All right.

2613
02:31:06,540 --> 02:31:09,660
Or as my mom would say, can't you be fucking nice.

2614
02:31:09,660 --> 02:31:10,380
It's Christmas.

2615
02:31:11,020 --> 02:31:11,420
No, no, no.

2616
02:31:11,420 --> 02:31:14,780
There's a difference between being nice and being kind.

2617
02:31:14,780 --> 02:31:15,420
No, I got you.

2618
02:31:15,420 --> 02:31:16,140
I got you.

2619
02:31:16,140 --> 02:31:18,380
Being kind also means fucking fight.

2620
02:31:19,340 --> 02:31:22,300
I couldn't help but think of that in the spirit of the holiday.

2621
02:31:22,300 --> 02:31:23,420
What my mom used to say.

2622
02:31:23,420 --> 02:31:23,740
All right.

2623
02:31:23,740 --> 02:31:24,940
Your mom was cool.

2624
02:31:24,940 --> 02:31:25,660
Yeah.

2625
02:31:25,660 --> 02:31:26,300
All right.

2626
02:31:26,300 --> 02:31:27,180
Anyway, that's it.

2627
02:31:27,180 --> 02:31:28,700
We're going to have a great night.

2628
02:31:28,700 --> 02:31:29,340
Great week.

2629
02:31:29,340 --> 02:31:30,300
We'll see you next time.

2630
02:31:30,940 --> 02:31:31,500
Bye everyone.

2631
02:31:31,500 --> 02:31:31,900
Good night.
