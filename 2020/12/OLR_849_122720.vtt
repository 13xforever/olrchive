WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.720
Personally, I thought that Apple's Trash Can Mac Pro was generally a great machine,

00:13.720 --> 00:17.120
but I understand that the lack of expandability was a net loss for the form factor. Does that

00:17.120 --> 00:21.520
mean I should be more positive about the KF console? No! No! I don't think it does!

00:21.520 --> 00:25.600
Capturing heat so close to a heat source that it's supposed to be cool sounds awful. Grease

00:25.600 --> 00:29.840
and oil are not ingredients in liquid cooling. This is just one story in a night of lawsuits

00:29.840 --> 00:33.840
anniversary shutdowns and wrap ups. Join your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki

00:33.840 --> 00:36.800
as they discuss this and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show

00:36.800 --> 00:44.320
where every gamer has a voice. Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to

00:44.320 --> 00:49.800
another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and

00:49.800 --> 00:56.360
we are live once again with, if you can believe it, the last show of 2020. It is episode number

00:56.360 --> 01:04.600
849 for tonight, December the 27th of 2020. My name is Rob Roberts, by myself in the studio

01:04.600 --> 01:09.560
as I have been for most of this year since March, and joining me via the Magic Discord

01:09.560 --> 01:16.920
say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers. Welcome to my mess. Your mess looks fine.

01:16.920 --> 01:24.760
It's definitely a nerd cave. It's a work in progress. I've thrown out four trash bags

01:24.760 --> 01:29.160
worth of just garbage. You know, the folks that listen to us on the podcast feed, which

01:29.160 --> 01:32.760
I would always strongly encourage, of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the

01:32.760 --> 01:37.360
Voice of Geeks network, twitch.tv slash VOG network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

01:37.360 --> 01:40.720
at about six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern. But for those that can't be here

01:40.720 --> 01:44.760
live and I understand Sunday's a busy night for a lot of people, we do have the podcast

01:44.760 --> 01:49.240
which has been going for a very long time, which you can check out on iTunes, Spotify,

01:49.240 --> 01:54.560
lots of popular podcast players out there. All the things. The podcast folks can't see

01:54.560 --> 02:00.800
what you're talking about. So you can mess you can lie and say, oh, it's it's this. Everything

02:00.800 --> 02:09.960
is well curated. I own my shit. And I know I have been lazy and sick for most of the

02:09.960 --> 02:16.000
year and the shit piled up and I have years of old cosplay stuff. I found 20 year old

02:16.000 --> 02:24.320
cosplays a few weeks ago, Rob. Oh, my gosh. I finally threw them out. My Leona costume.

02:24.960 --> 02:30.880
OK, the short the cargo shorts I had for my Leona costume, I can now pull on by one leg

02:30.880 --> 02:39.640
over my hips. Yeah. So I was got says something. I was going to say, don't ask me to show the

02:39.640 --> 02:43.760
rest of the studio here and what's happened to this, this outside this little box that

02:43.760 --> 02:49.080
you see me in. Dark Soccer's throne has clean laundry on it. There's a monitor on the table

02:50.080 --> 02:56.880
up to the show and it's seen your laundry on it. So it's a girl don't even try me. It's

02:56.880 --> 03:03.320
a convenient place. But but at any rate, I've only kept one of the old costumes and that

03:03.320 --> 03:09.280
was my Jill costume because it was the first one I did when I moved to California. And

03:09.280 --> 03:14.100
I actually threw away Emmy. Except I saved the striped shirt I had under it was actually

03:14.100 --> 03:23.780
an old Navy pajama shirt and it's really warm. So I kept that. But like the wig, I

03:23.780 --> 03:30.380
didn't know about wig care back then very well. And that poor blue wig was like that.

03:30.380 --> 03:38.260
Yeah, it was ready to go. I kept the hat, the ginormous white tam that she wears. So

03:38.260 --> 03:42.660
and it was actually in really good shape. I mean, I paid 20 bucks for it 20 years ago,

03:42.660 --> 03:51.580
so it had to be good. So yeah, useful stuff and I found a sewing kit. Okay. I also did

03:51.580 --> 03:56.780
get rid of bike in because I can do a lot better. I'm taking a look at our chat room

03:56.780 --> 04:01.060
because of course while we tape live you can participate along in our chat chat over twitch.tv

04:01.060 --> 04:06.860
slash v o g network and SSU 100. Matt says rooms full of mess and piled up stuff much

04:06.860 --> 04:13.820
like many folks Animal Crossing homes. And to answer Phoenix 7726 who says I found cosplay

04:13.820 --> 04:24.340
as old as olr. No, it's older. It's under sedation age. Oh, but grandpa grandpa died

04:24.340 --> 04:30.400
under sedation isn't around anymore. So also to answer ranch on. Travis is fine. He got

04:30.400 --> 04:37.920
an Xbox for Christmas just Tamari costume is in another box. And actually the kimono

04:37.920 --> 04:45.280
is way too big for me but still in great shape. And I'm thinking about taking it in and repurposing

04:45.280 --> 04:54.680
it. It might end up as a certain Shinsengumi character who will remain unnamed. Right?

04:54.680 --> 04:59.400
Well let me I'll let me also introduce as I do every week say hello to tech master Loki.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.960
Hello. Hi. Are you holding on to any old cosplay Loki?

05:02.960 --> 05:10.200
No way. Don't you have Sackboy? He's threw that away.

05:10.200 --> 05:17.120
It was in the garage for a very long time. And I was just afraid that if I put my head

05:17.120 --> 05:23.760
in it that there could be so many spiders. So I was like, I'm not gonna risk it. I'm

05:23.760 --> 05:32.800
just gonna throw it away. Yeah, well, you know, I did actually check it before I threw

05:32.800 --> 05:35.960
it away. But like it was just so dusty and stuff. And I was like, I'm never gonna wear

05:35.960 --> 05:41.920
this again. Yeah. So yeah, I forgot about that Sackboy costume. But that was now that

05:41.920 --> 05:45.580
you mentioned it. That was a legendary episode. Well, our wasn't that like the 10th anniversary

05:45.580 --> 05:49.840
or something like it was a landmark episode, maybe Episode 500. I don't remember. But you

05:49.840 --> 05:56.600
dressed all dark Tetsuya. What episode was it or Misty? I need to ask the real experts

05:56.600 --> 06:03.800
of the show. But you you actually came to the studio. I do remember it was at the house

06:03.800 --> 06:08.840
over. I don't want to give out addresses on the show. I guess I don't live there anymore.

06:08.840 --> 06:12.400
But the ranch is the garage. Yeah, well, yeah, it was in the garage there. Yeah, yeah. And

06:12.400 --> 06:16.760
I remember it was in that studio. You had the neighbor across the street who house caught

06:16.760 --> 06:23.680
on fire. Yes. Did I tell that story on O.L.R.? I don't remember. I may not have. I remember

06:23.680 --> 06:28.880
driving by and seeing the house gutted. And that's always what I remember. Well, I can

06:28.880 --> 06:34.520
tell it now. I probably. And Drew knocking over the table. I probably didn't want to

06:34.520 --> 06:38.560
tell it then, because if I told it on air, it would have given away where I lived. But

06:38.560 --> 06:44.480
I live there anymore. So it doesn't matter. So this true story, the house across the street

06:44.480 --> 06:49.440
from me burned down one day. And I know that sounds really scary. And what's also really

06:49.440 --> 06:55.240
scary about it is that I was napping when it happened. I slept through the whole damn

06:55.240 --> 07:00.160
thing. And I woke up to the sounds of my room. My roommate, Johnny, came home and he was

07:00.160 --> 07:05.480
like, Rob, Rob, are you here? Rob, Rob. And I'm like, what? Are you OK? And he goes, he

07:05.480 --> 07:11.260
just gives me this look like he goes, look outside. And I like peek through the mini

07:11.260 --> 07:17.500
blinds and I just see all these lights and I see the house on smoke. Like, what the fuck?

07:17.500 --> 07:23.360
And yeah, the house across the street burned down. And it was one of those things where

07:23.360 --> 07:29.580
they had a lot of devices and power cords that were going into their garage as if they

07:29.580 --> 07:35.740
were potentially making some things in the garage, allegedly. And that's I'm going to

07:35.740 --> 07:42.460
leave it at that. So, yeah, that was that was an interesting experience. So we moved

07:42.460 --> 07:50.380
either meth or porn. We moved. So, yeah, we should make that a new game show, meth or

07:50.380 --> 07:54.460
porn. Yeah. Who knows what was going on in that house. So, yeah, I probably didn't tell

07:54.460 --> 07:57.400
that story on air at the time, because, you know, if I say, oh, the house across the street

07:57.400 --> 08:02.380
from me burned down, then people would figure out exactly where I live. But I don't live

08:02.380 --> 08:07.660
there anymore. So it's fine. Yeah. Act Defton chat says they blazed it. They sure did.

08:07.660 --> 08:11.420
I you know, I don't like to make fun of it because somebody's house burned down. But

08:11.420 --> 08:17.980
at the same time, if it if it was what we all suspect it was, then how bad do you feel

08:17.980 --> 08:21.620
on a scale of one to ten? You know, yeah. If you can't make a joke about it, what can

08:21.620 --> 08:27.100
you do? Right. So, yes. So that was that was I don't know how we got on this subject from

08:27.100 --> 08:36.140
welcome to our hope. You all had a great holiday. Yes. Yes. I have a new breaking thing

08:36.140 --> 08:45.740
is that a gaming magazine, JYMING has highlighted Rock Rockum Sakura of San Francisco. Oh, fine.

08:45.740 --> 08:52.620
Well, they've got their who is a gaming queen. They have their award show, which I can't

08:52.620 --> 08:56.620
remember the name of off the top of my head. Sorry. But I know they nominated a bunch of

08:56.620 --> 09:01.740
stuff. Oh, well, are not nominated, but that's OK. How very dare they? That's all right.

09:01.740 --> 09:06.580
That's all right. But no, there's a lot of good stuff that was nominated there. I remember

09:06.580 --> 09:11.020
seeing it across the Twitter stuff. And I was thinking like, I guess I because there

09:11.020 --> 09:15.020
was talk about doing that show in person at one point, obviously, even though I think

09:15.020 --> 09:18.580
it's in February, I think I think that talk is still off the table. I don't think people

09:18.580 --> 09:24.180
can really plan on in-person events until at least summer. And even then, there's going

09:24.180 --> 09:33.260
to be footnotes, asterisks and things of that nature. But yeah. So anyway, Phoenix, seventy

09:33.260 --> 09:38.500
seven, twenty six and chat says, wait, is OLR the new Night Vale? I don't know. I don't

09:38.500 --> 09:42.740
know. We probably have more listeners if we were. All right. Let's get it. We are we are

09:42.740 --> 09:48.340
a video game podcast. We love all of our listeners. We do. And we hope you all had a good holiday

09:49.100 --> 09:54.780
I know. I know Hanukkah ended quite some time ago. But Christmas, Christmas was this past

09:54.780 --> 09:58.820
week, which I know a lot of people celebrate. So I hope you all had a good Christmas that

09:58.820 --> 10:05.540
we're celebrating that. Kwanzaa goes for seven days. Right. So we're in that starts the day

10:05.540 --> 10:10.580
after Christmas. So we're in the midst of that. And then Festivus for the rest of us.

10:10.580 --> 10:17.060
I know I saw some posts on that. And if you're Satanist, Sol Invictus. Oh, right. Or paganist

10:17.100 --> 10:24.100
would have solstice. Yule. Or Yule. Yes. Yule or Solstice. But may you have a an unconquerable

10:26.540 --> 10:32.540
Sol Invictus? DJ Rama S in chat says six days. My bad. Six days. For Kwanzaa. Yes, for Kwanzaa.

10:32.540 --> 10:38.700
Yeah. All right. Anyway, let's get into video game news and stuff going on in the game world,

10:38.700 --> 10:42.780
which considering it is a holiday week, like usually this would be the night of nothing

10:42.860 --> 10:49.540
but off topic because there's not a lot happening in the industry. But we can do that. And we

10:49.540 --> 10:55.740
damn well might challenge us, try us. No, but we do have quite a bit of gaming news.

10:55.740 --> 10:59.860
There's still less. I know we have kind of a shorter show role than we usually do just

10:59.860 --> 11:04.100
because less did happen. But I honestly feel like most years we're sitting here this week

11:04.100 --> 11:09.180
going, we ain't found shit. Right. Like there isn't a lot going on in gaming. But this this

11:09.180 --> 11:15.260
week has been pretty busy, all things considered. And it starts with it starts with something

11:15.260 --> 11:20.660
I think we all saw coming. Dark Soccer and Loki going to talk about this one Dark Soccer.

11:20.660 --> 11:27.220
Why did you start us off? What happened? Well, CD Projekt Red, you know, the ones who are

11:27.220 --> 11:36.980
responsible for that clusterfuck that is Cyberpunk 277. They are seeing some lawsuits because

11:36.980 --> 11:47.620
they basically were considered to miss mislead the public. So some of the class action lawsuits

11:47.620 --> 11:55.140
are being brought forward. Actually, one of them is brought on on behalf of Andrew Tramp,

11:55.140 --> 12:02.620
who is one of the investors by the Rosen law firm alleging that CDPR willfully neglected

12:02.620 --> 12:09.060
to inform investors of the nature of how buggy the game was and that the company downplayed

12:09.060 --> 12:15.860
other issues surrounding the game prior to release. They were saying that their public

12:15.860 --> 12:21.600
statements that were made prior to release, and this is a quote, were materially false

12:21.600 --> 12:26.960
and or misleading because they misrepresented facts and the company failed to disclose that

12:26.960 --> 12:33.320
Cyberpunk 277 was virtually unplayable on current generation Xbox or PlayStation systems

12:33.320 --> 12:42.760
due to an enormous amount of bugs. And I'm going to read the comments from the CDPR executives.

12:42.760 --> 12:47.160
This is another quote. After three delays, we as the management board were too focused

12:47.160 --> 12:51.400
on releasing the game. We underestimated the scale and complexity of the issues. We ignored

12:51.400 --> 12:56.760
the signals about the need for additional time to refine the game on the base last gen

12:56.760 --> 13:02.240
consoles. It was the wrong approach and against our business philosophy. On top of that, during

13:02.240 --> 13:07.320
the campaign, we showed the game mostly on PCs. They're basically like, yeah, we were

13:07.320 --> 13:15.640
shitty. There's another lawsuit from the Schall, S-C-H-A-L-L, Schall law firm seeking class

13:15.640 --> 13:23.920
action status for violations. They list the ones for the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

13:23.920 --> 13:29.360
and rule 10B5 promulgated there under blah, blah, blah. It's more had to do with the US

13:29.360 --> 13:34.040
Securities and Exchange Commission basically laying out the same evidence that was presented

13:34.040 --> 13:39.080
by the Rosen law firm, citing the bugs and mere unplayable status of the game for the

13:39.080 --> 13:44.400
earlier consoles. They're quote, based on these facts companies, public statements were

13:44.400 --> 13:48.980
false and materially misleading throughout the class period when the market learned the

13:48.980 --> 13:59.500
truth about CD project investors suffered damages. And there was a hot fix that was

13:59.500 --> 14:06.740
released basically to address bugs and performance issues. There was another one that was released

14:06.740 --> 14:15.220
this week, or I guess by this week, I mean, it's last week to fix the save data corruption

14:15.220 --> 14:20.380
for PC. And it's looking like there's going to be other fixes, but I'm wondering if it's

14:20.380 --> 14:27.820
going to be too little too late for what's going to be on the table. Because I mean,

14:27.820 --> 14:31.300
there are people who can't afford to go right out and buy the new console right when it

14:31.300 --> 14:35.140
comes out and they'd like to be able to enjoy the game. The game was advertised as supposed

14:35.140 --> 14:37.900
to be available and playable on this earlier consoles.

14:37.900 --> 14:41.620
Right. What's interesting though, and you know, we'll talk a little later in the show

14:41.620 --> 14:45.940
as well, because I think Loki has a piece on like how the game is actually doing right

14:45.940 --> 14:49.260
now. We'll talk a little bit about that later in the show, but I think what's important

14:49.260 --> 14:54.500
to note in what you just outlined there with what's going on in the two different class

14:54.500 --> 15:00.180
actions there is that this is an investor piece. So this isn't what this isn't. And

15:00.180 --> 15:04.020
I think where people kind of thought it would go based on some prior class actions that

15:04.020 --> 15:07.960
have happened in the past is that at least in what Dark Soccer is talking about now,

15:07.960 --> 15:13.360
the gears they're turning now, this is not gamer upset at the product they bought. That

15:13.360 --> 15:20.200
is not what this is. This is a lawsuit for investors because yeah, the goal of a company

15:20.200 --> 15:25.840
is to make money for investors, right? Capitalism, woohoo, whatever. But that is what it is.

15:25.840 --> 15:27.640
And so, go ahead.

15:27.640 --> 15:32.480
SSJ 100, Matt actually did sum it up very perfectly and I quote, so the investors are

15:32.480 --> 15:36.720
pretty much suing to reclaim whatever they lost from the stocks they owned in it.

15:37.480 --> 15:43.760
Yeah, that's pretty much it in a nutshell or that basically by perception of money lost

15:43.760 --> 15:48.920
by yeah, perception of money lost by having these various refunds that are going on and

15:48.920 --> 15:56.640
by not releasing by kind of hiding what you did on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, you affected

15:56.640 --> 16:01.120
basically the bottom line, the sales. So that is, that is I think very interesting to note

16:02.000 --> 16:08.560
This is coming from the investor standpoint because I feel like with that playing into

16:08.560 --> 16:16.160
it, the result of this whole thing could have implications in our industry further down,

16:16.160 --> 16:24.640
I think. Too early to say, but you know, everybody in gaming right now, whether you love Cyberpunk,

16:24.640 --> 16:30.040
whether you hate it, whether you don't care, wherever you're at on that, that, you know,

16:30.680 --> 16:37.240
everybody's looking at this because what happens here, I think will have an impact on how games

16:37.240 --> 16:42.600
are marketed, height and so on in the future. Again, this is very, I think what's happening

16:42.600 --> 16:47.400
here is very different from what happened with No Man's Sky, which was the product, not of a

16:47.400 --> 16:51.800
publicly traded company, by the way, and was more rooted in some PR blunders.

16:51.800 --> 16:55.640
You say why I don't go out and buy new games anymore.

16:56.600 --> 17:00.200
I think a lot of us are at that point, to be quite honest. Anyway,

17:00.200 --> 17:02.120
I don't get excited anymore.

17:02.120 --> 17:05.320
Loki, I know this story has been on your radar this week as well. I don't know if there's

17:05.320 --> 17:07.160
anything you want to add or anything from your perspective.

17:08.040 --> 17:13.160
No, not really. I mean, it's pretty much, it's just, you know, investors, um, feeling that they

17:13.160 --> 17:18.840
were misled. And usually if that happened, you get in trouble with the board or, you know, you have

17:18.840 --> 17:23.240
to answer to that. So kind of just more of what we were talking about last week, how probably

17:23.320 --> 17:29.320
leadership's gonna be held accountable for that. Um, and someone may get let go, you never know,

17:29.320 --> 17:33.880
but that's kind of just more coming out of this. I think you're absolutely right on that. Um,

17:33.880 --> 17:40.040
let's see Questbuster in chat says, uh, CD project stock has lost nearly half its value in the past

17:40.040 --> 17:45.960
few months. It lost around 20% around the cyberpunk 2077 fiasco. And I think that's an

17:45.960 --> 17:51.000
important thing to point out is because again, it doesn't really matter how you feel about the game

17:51.000 --> 17:54.920
personally. Cause I also see people in chat that are saying, you know, a Zen monkey 11 says people

17:54.920 --> 18:00.520
will be able to play the game on any platform by March. No worries. Um, Questbuster says it's not

18:00.520 --> 18:05.480
unplayable on a PS4. I finished it, but it could definitely have used more time in the oven and not

18:05.480 --> 18:10.600
everyone will want to deal with the bugs. And again, this isn't about like trying to take a

18:10.600 --> 18:16.200
dump on the game or whatever, like, or, or pour gasoline on a fire. That's already going. This

18:16.200 --> 18:21.480
is more like just facing the kind of the reality of no matter how you personally feel about the

18:21.480 --> 18:29.400
game, because the refund mechanism got triggered because these headlines about Sony pulls a game

18:29.400 --> 18:36.360
from digital sale, you know, whether that was really something that Sony did about the quality

18:36.360 --> 18:42.840
or whether that was a response to Sony did because of something CD project reds leadership did

18:42.920 --> 18:48.280
saying, go to Sony. Yeah. Right. Cause they told them to go to Sony, but they didn't tell Sony

18:48.280 --> 18:53.400
that they were doing that. So that's why they pulled it from the shop. And that again is a

18:53.400 --> 18:57.080
problem of leadership. And that's the point I'm trying to make. Again, you have a problem of

18:57.080 --> 19:03.480
leadership and ultimately what got impacted the stock value and the, the, you know, whether

19:04.600 --> 19:10.120
the refunds were as big as we think they are or not. And that whole thing, it doesn't matter.

19:10.120 --> 19:15.960
The stock value plummeted because of all of the bad press, because Sony pulling your game from

19:15.960 --> 19:21.080
the store is not a great headline. Even if quality didn't have anything to do with it,

19:21.080 --> 19:26.920
because believe me and believe you, cause you've seen it too. There's a lot of shit on the

19:26.920 --> 19:32.360
PlayStation four marketplace. There is some garbage on the PlayStation four marketplace

19:32.360 --> 19:37.080
and the X-Box marketplace and any cell phone marketplace and steam, you name it.

19:37.080 --> 19:44.680
It's got garbage. So quality is not the problem. Ultimately. I know that sounds weird to say.

19:45.800 --> 19:52.520
So the thing is, is that when the garbage is something that's expected to be the utter

19:52.520 --> 20:02.280
opposite of garbage, you know, it's, it's just really bothersome, you know, this whole situation

20:02.520 --> 20:10.840
is very bothersome. And I actually, I mean, I do want to see them held to the fire over it a lot

20:10.840 --> 20:20.920
more, just because I think that we need to stop this whole thing of having these half-baked games

20:20.920 --> 20:28.440
come out. Yeah. You know, if we, if we have, you know, people putting the same care into like what

20:28.440 --> 20:34.360
they would have done for a cartridge based game in the past, because you can't patch a cartridge.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.800
That's true. Well, you, well, I mean, I guess if you had.

20:41.800 --> 20:48.040
The average gamer does not patch a cartridge back in the NES days. Yes.

20:48.680 --> 20:55.320
Unless you were getting, you know, ROM hacks and translated ROMs. I digress. But

20:55.320 --> 21:03.240
it's it's really just a shame and it's something that we need to hold these companies accountable

21:03.240 --> 21:08.600
for, you know, they shouldn't. I'll just say, I, I, I think ultimately,

21:08.600 --> 21:14.040
and just following what I said last week, I think how this ends one or both CEOs will be done.

21:14.040 --> 21:18.760
And that's how this ends. There's, there's no other outcome. I think that could satisfy

21:18.760 --> 21:25.160
the investors at this point. And that's that. I think they're still going to try

21:26.040 --> 21:32.600
to play this. But it won't matter. And I really, I kind of have hope that they do.

21:34.120 --> 21:38.360
And this is just more of me now being a little bit vindictive about it.

21:38.920 --> 21:45.400
But if they try to play it off more, keep trying to do the same thing and then fail after that,

21:45.400 --> 21:51.480
like burn harder, then I think that's really going to get the, the message across. And I mean,

21:52.040 --> 21:58.840
I don't want to bring politics into it, but we're also seeing that it's been just this

21:59.560 --> 22:05.160
ongoing thing in general, in the public of offer this promise, offer this, say this, say that,

22:05.160 --> 22:09.800
and then not being able to pull through or doing the exact opposite. And now,

22:10.680 --> 22:14.680
you know, there's consequences to pay. And I really want to start seeing these consequences

22:15.400 --> 22:20.600
being, this is what I'm thinking of. I want to see them being held to the consequence.

22:20.600 --> 22:25.400
Yeah. I definitely want to see other CEOs looking at this situation going like, Oh,

22:25.400 --> 22:28.920
better make sure that doesn't happen here. I want them all to shit their pants or remember

22:28.920 --> 22:37.800
who pays their bills. That's another way to put it. No. Well, you know me, if I can be blunt about

22:37.800 --> 22:43.880
it, I will. What's that? Let me ask this question before we get into our gaming weeks. And it's kind

22:43.880 --> 22:48.120
of a follow-up to something that came up on Bobby Blackwell's show tonight. Because of course,

22:48.120 --> 22:52.200
you know, as I mentioned at the top of the show, he's on live before us here at the voice of

22:52.200 --> 22:57.480
geeks network. Now, Bobby was talking about some of his highlights from the year of various sorts.

22:57.480 --> 23:01.240
I won't spoil everything. I won't talk about categories and stuff, but one game that he

23:01.240 --> 23:06.120
talked a little bit about was half-life Alex. And I thought it was kind of interesting because he

23:06.120 --> 23:14.120
said half-life Alex, you know, and this is one way you can look at it. Absolutely. Half-life Alex

23:14.120 --> 23:18.520
is basically half-life three. This is it. This is half-life three. This is the game

23:18.520 --> 23:24.440
that folks have been waiting for. This is half-life three, but they knew they could never

23:24.440 --> 23:31.080
live up to the hype that everybody had in their minds built up for half-life three, especially

23:31.080 --> 23:37.080
when you add that additional twist or challenge of the fact that it is VR only based, which limits

23:37.080 --> 23:41.800
your audience and all that stuff. Because they knew they could never really live up to that

23:41.800 --> 23:47.640
half-life three hype. Instead, they tailored the message and made it half-life Alex. And he kind

23:47.640 --> 23:54.040
of made a little joke in there about how cyberpunk, you know, didn't think to do the same thing or

23:54.040 --> 23:57.560
something along those lines. And it did kind of, you know, even though I think he just kind of

23:57.560 --> 24:03.320
said it as a one-off comment, it did kind of make me think, huh, you know, yeah, in many ways what

24:03.320 --> 24:12.120
happened with cyberpunk was kind of a victim of its own hype machine. Like, what if they either

24:12.120 --> 24:17.240
A, had just announced the game a lot later, which maybe the industry wouldn't really allow them to

24:17.240 --> 24:24.120
do, or B, just said, you know what? Cyberpunk 2077, unfortunately, it just wasn't meeting our

24:24.120 --> 24:29.560
expectations. So we've decided, can it? But guess what we have coming out for the PlayStation 5,

24:29.560 --> 24:38.760
PC and Xbox Series X, no mention of prior consoles. We've got this game, Cyber Intruder 2078 is coming

24:38.760 --> 24:45.800
and it's going to be awesome. I don't know. Loki, you're the only one out of us that's

24:45.800 --> 24:50.360
actually played the game. And I think you've enjoyed the game. Did they set themselves up to

24:50.360 --> 24:56.200
fail with the hype or what? I don't know if they, I mean, it was a pretty hyped game. I

24:56.200 --> 25:01.880
just think they had difficulty with releasing on so many platforms at once. I mean, I knew that

25:01.880 --> 25:05.560
everything nowadays that gets released is a little bit buggy, but this was like kind of

25:06.920 --> 25:12.680
an extraordinary case of bugginess. I mean, a Bethesda level of bugginess, if you will,

25:12.680 --> 25:17.720
probably even a little bit beyond that. It just, it obviously needed more time. It'll get better

25:17.720 --> 25:24.760
as it goes along, but it's just, this is just the trend in gaming nowadays that companies release

25:24.760 --> 25:29.240
these half finished products that meet a deadline. And then they keep promising that they're going

25:29.240 --> 25:35.320
to patch it after the fact, or keep fixing it or adding on to it. We'll just have to see if

25:35.320 --> 25:41.800
it actually happens. And some more comments from chat I think are really good and worth reading

25:41.800 --> 25:47.000
here. SSG100Matt says, Cyberpunk had trouble living up to the hype, much like No Man's Sky

25:47.000 --> 25:51.640
did at first. Hopefully they can turn it around like No Man's Sky did. I imagine they will.

25:51.640 --> 25:55.400
I also imagine they will. I don't think they have a choice at this point, but I think that was

25:55.400 --> 26:00.200
probably always in their long game plan, because we know there's Series X and PlayStation 5 versions

26:00.200 --> 26:04.840
that are still coming, like specific to those, not running on backwards compatibility. And of course,

26:04.840 --> 26:09.240
of course they've got DLC in the works and things like that. So there's going to be opportunities

26:09.240 --> 26:14.360
for them to relaunch the game with a game of the year edition. I mean, look at the playbook for

26:14.360 --> 26:19.720
Witcher 3, right? That game has been selling for years and years and years, and they have a long

26:19.720 --> 26:24.440
game on how they're going to continue to sell the game. And it's on Steam sale right now,

26:24.440 --> 26:30.600
by the way. Of course, of course. The Winter Sale, of which I've bought some games. And this is

26:30.600 --> 26:37.400
really important too. Dartetsuya in chat says, To me, Cyberpunk 2077 at least lived up to the hype.

26:37.400 --> 26:42.440
I'm probably close to 60 hours in and I can't get enough. I just absolutely love the setting. And I

26:42.440 --> 26:46.200
think that's something important for us to keep in mind as we're talking about all of this, is that

26:46.760 --> 26:51.160
the problem really is, is that there's a lot of people out there looking at this going,

26:51.160 --> 26:56.840
what the hell's the problem? The game is fine. But then there's other people sitting out there

26:56.840 --> 27:04.520
on their base PlayStation 4s, or maybe that don't buy Bethesda games in the past or buy

27:05.400 --> 27:11.480
other buggy games that are looking at this going, what the hell is this? I waited eight years for

27:11.480 --> 27:18.840
this. And so there's a real disparity there between the groups of where people's expectations

27:18.840 --> 27:23.000
were at. And I think that's why the gaming industry is going to really have a conversation

27:23.000 --> 27:28.520
after this fact about, you know, where's the appropriate place to put expectations? I think

27:28.520 --> 27:33.640
that'll be very interesting. I don't know. Anything else you guys want to add to that?

27:35.400 --> 27:40.520
All right. I knocked over my webcam. You knocked over your webcam. We're going on a ride.

27:40.520 --> 27:46.040
All right. Just because I'm screwing with crap on my desk. All right. I'm a professional. Should

27:46.040 --> 27:52.600
I hide that until you fix it there? Tell me. Nah, I don't care. Okay. All right. Anyway,

27:54.760 --> 28:00.680
Meech in chat, one more comment here. People are so ready to give up the moment shit don't pan out

28:00.680 --> 28:05.800
the way they want because they're so instant gratification. Let me ask one more question.

28:05.800 --> 28:09.480
Think that the truth. One more question that came to mind since, you know, we've been saying

28:09.480 --> 28:14.760
Bethesda gets away with it. Bethesda, Bethesda, and all this stuff. Well, sometimes they get away

28:14.760 --> 28:18.040
with it. I don't know. The reception of Fallout 76, I don't think it was exactly what they were

28:18.040 --> 28:22.440
looking for. But something- Oh no, they got nailed for that one. Well, here's something very

28:22.440 --> 28:28.760
important. Bethesda is no longer, Zenimax is no longer, you know, who owned Bethesda, is no longer

28:28.760 --> 28:37.320
an independent thing. Zenimax is part of Microsoft. Microsoft just had the audacity, and I mean that

28:37.320 --> 28:43.480
in a good way, actually. Microsoft had the audacity to bump back their biggest first-party

28:43.480 --> 28:49.800
title that was supposed to be the highlight of Xbox Series X and S, Halo Infinite, of course.

28:50.920 --> 28:57.560
They just bumped that back an entire year, if not maybe more at this point, because it wasn't

28:57.560 --> 29:03.480
living up to the quality they expected. Could that be the future of Bethesda now that they are

29:03.560 --> 29:10.520
a Microsoft property? What do y'all think of that? Are our joke days of Bethesda done because

29:10.520 --> 29:15.720
they're gonna maybe have a different standard now that, you know, different people are at the

29:15.720 --> 29:26.280
helm of the organization? Namely, Phil Spencer. We will see, but I think, well, possibly. So,

29:27.080 --> 29:33.320
it would have, I would imagine that if they're building a brand new game, like a new,

29:33.880 --> 29:40.120
obviously the new Elder Scrolls game in Starfield, it's probably going to be running on a completely

29:40.120 --> 29:46.360
new engine. I would hope, I hope they're not repurposing the old engine for that. So that,

29:46.360 --> 29:49.960
I think that was a lot of the problems that they had, especially with like Fallout 76,

29:49.960 --> 29:53.720
is they were using like some of the original engine that they were running,

29:54.520 --> 30:01.160
you know, Oblivion or even, I think stuff even older than Oblivion on, and it just kind of adding

30:01.160 --> 30:07.720
to it and repurposing it for things it was never meant to do. And so you were running into like

30:07.720 --> 30:14.760
bugs that have been in place since those early games. And so I would hope that they're going to

30:14.760 --> 30:21.240
start fresh with a new engine to build these new games, because I can't see how these older engines

30:21.240 --> 30:29.320
would support something that massive in that detail. So hopefully that will be behind us.

30:30.360 --> 30:34.760
We'll see though, when it comes out. Cause I mean, I don't know.

30:35.320 --> 30:39.240
All right. Let me read a few more comments from chat. Deja Rama S says, you know,

30:39.240 --> 30:44.440
CD Projekt RED basically abandoned Xbox One PlayStation 4 platforms for next gen.

30:44.440 --> 30:48.760
That and upper management demanding a release. It is what it is. And, you know, Rama, I think

30:48.760 --> 30:53.000
a lot that played into that is that there was probably so many pre-orders on that platform that,

30:53.000 --> 30:57.960
and I think this is what the issue really ultimately boils down to is that CD Projekt RED

30:57.960 --> 31:03.320
probably knew they should walk away from those platforms and focus on PC and the next gen,

31:03.320 --> 31:07.640
because things had come so far along in the eight years, but somewhere along the way,

31:07.640 --> 31:14.680
somebody in that boardroom said, but we have X number of pre-orders on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

31:14.680 --> 31:20.200
If we cancel that, we lose all that. And so somebody made the decision and here's the problem.

31:21.320 --> 31:25.560
Somebody made the decision. Well, we can't have that release it anyway.

31:26.600 --> 31:28.920
That is the problem. It was all down to money.

31:28.920 --> 31:35.160
Yes. I mean, just one less little thing. As much as we like to say that some of these

31:35.160 --> 31:39.560
big companies, they care about the gamers. They want us to have fun. They want us to have a good

31:39.560 --> 31:47.400
quality product. For a lot of them, it's all about the bottom line. How do I profit off of this?

31:48.680 --> 31:54.120
And that's it. A few more comments here. I want to read a comment from Mimsie94 who says,

31:54.120 --> 31:58.280
I don't know if my view on games helps. Hey, every gamer has a voice. All are welcome,

31:58.280 --> 32:02.360
but I'm easily pleased with most games and Cyberpunk is a great game to play in my opinion,

32:02.360 --> 32:07.080
but I can only play the playthrough since I can't own any of the gaming systems, but fantastic to

32:07.080 --> 32:12.360
watch the playthroughs. Well, don't forget, even if you don't have the newest and greatest systems,

32:13.320 --> 32:18.520
Stadia is trying to target folks like you. And that is another way that a lot of people are

32:18.520 --> 32:23.640
enjoying Cyberpunk is through that where you don't necessarily get it on Stadia.

32:23.640 --> 32:27.880
Yeah. Right. Like again, and we kind of got into this last week or the week before is like

32:27.880 --> 32:34.440
Stadia's best use case just happened and Google had nothing to do with it.

32:35.400 --> 32:40.360
Like, it's like this literally fell in their fucking lap and it's a great thing for them.

32:40.360 --> 32:47.320
I got my free Stadia. It arrived. Like, why the hell not should I not try it on that? I mean,

32:47.320 --> 32:52.040
I just got a bunch of games actually because they did a bunch of freebies if you have Stadia Pro.

32:52.040 --> 32:56.200
And then I want to get one more comment here from Bobby Blackwolf because this kind of speaks to all

32:56.200 --> 33:01.640
the, you know, buggy and open world and things we were talking about before, who says, the issue is

33:02.520 --> 33:08.280
that a lot of bugs are really the byproduct of a huge open world game. Yes, QA can find a lot

33:08.280 --> 33:14.200
of things, but there will always be stuff found by players once you let something out. And I'm

33:14.200 --> 33:20.920
going to say something very blunt. Why not? It's the holidays. Uncle Rob's going to tell it like

33:20.920 --> 33:30.200
it is. This is how you can tell the difference between a podcast, a news organization, a Twitter

33:30.200 --> 33:35.480
account, a group. This is how you can tell the difference. A group that is saying,

33:35.480 --> 33:42.120
didn't they test this game? What's happening in QA? What are they doing there? Does CD Project

33:42.120 --> 33:48.440
Red even have a QA? The people that are saying that haven't been following this industry a very

33:48.440 --> 33:53.720
long time or don't have insight into this industry. Because you'll notice that phrase

33:53.720 --> 33:58.600
hasn't left any of our mouths. And most of you in chat either, none of you have been blaming QA on

33:58.600 --> 34:04.280
this. Because I think those of us that have been participating at this table for a while now know,

34:04.280 --> 34:08.760
this isn't the fall of QA. Of course, there's a QA department. Of course, QA told them it was wrong.

34:08.760 --> 34:15.160
Go back to what I just said. And this whole thing is that they knew they had pre-orders on Xbox One

34:15.160 --> 34:21.320
and PlayStation 4. QA tells them it's broken. Boston Boardroom says, doesn't matter, release

34:21.320 --> 34:29.560
it anyway. And that's a story that happens a lot. I liken that to some of those sort of sci-fi

34:29.560 --> 34:39.560
movies about, oh, we've done this magic food item, but it will give 0.1% of people rabies.

34:39.560 --> 34:43.000
I'm just throwing that out there. And they released it anyway. And then you have a rabid

34:43.000 --> 34:47.560
population. And then the army has to go in and fight them. And then Will Smith saves the day.

34:47.720 --> 34:49.480
They're just rabid fans of the product now.

34:53.240 --> 34:57.720
All right. And then Bobby had another follow-up comment here. Oh, yes. Because I like this. I like

34:57.720 --> 35:02.920
this little saying here. Bobby says, one of my sayings in software development is that the moment

35:02.920 --> 35:09.320
you make something idiot-proof, the world will just build a better idiot. I kind of think that

35:09.320 --> 35:14.520
goes hand in hand with the saying, hacker's gonna hack, right? Because that kind of goes... Because

35:14.600 --> 35:18.360
when we talk about oblivion and if it doesn't work, somebody else is going to fix it. And the

35:18.360 --> 35:22.600
whole thing, people will figure out ways to work around something like that. Kind of in some ways

35:22.600 --> 35:27.800
goes hand in hand with that. I did not call hackers idiots for the record. I'm just saying

35:27.800 --> 35:33.080
there are comparisons between those two sayings. I just like the term that you can learn to fail

35:33.080 --> 35:39.640
in new and exciting ways. There is that too. Yes. All right. This saga is far from done. So I'm

35:39.640 --> 35:44.200
sorry if you didn't want to hear anything about cyberpunk. Too bad because this story is not

35:44.200 --> 35:50.360
going to be done. But think of it this way. This is, again, going to have an impact on the industry.

35:50.360 --> 35:56.680
What happens here, others are watching. So let's see where this path leads us. I think it's

35:56.680 --> 36:04.840
interesting. And what's interesting, I was very like, eh, on cyberpunk. There are hundreds,

36:04.840 --> 36:08.760
thousands of games that released in a calendar year. I don't have time to play everything.

36:08.760 --> 36:12.520
So I was like, I'll get to cyberpunk when they have the game of the year

36:13.080 --> 36:16.840
edition with all the DLC included and all that stuff. I'll get to it then. That's still where my

36:16.840 --> 36:23.400
mind is at. I don't need a day one. And I'm not into a game like that too much. I'm still waiting for

36:23.400 --> 36:30.920
Mass Effect. My Mass Effect remaster. Yeah. But I can also still look at it and go, but this shit's

36:30.920 --> 36:36.280
fascinating. What's going down here legally, you know, and all that. All right. Anyway,

36:36.280 --> 36:40.600
let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week,

36:40.600 --> 36:43.800
whether it was cyberpunk or not. Dar Sakura, how was your gaming week?

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
I played Animal Crossing because what else do I do? I play Animal Crossing.

36:50.520 --> 36:57.240
We had another good run on Pop and Twinbee. I fucking love Pop and Twinbee. It's like one of my

36:57.240 --> 37:04.040
favorite old Super Famicom games. And I've had ROMs of it and everything. So I really, really,

37:04.040 --> 37:08.680
really have been playing a decent bit of Pop and Twinbee, but I think I've been doing it under

37:08.680 --> 37:17.080
Dan's account by accident. We actually are talking about getting another pinball. We've

37:17.080 --> 37:20.360
kind of floated around if we're going to get a Black Knight Sword of Rage.

37:22.840 --> 37:30.840
Believe it or not, we have the animated topper for Black Knight Sword of Rage without owning the

37:30.840 --> 37:35.720
table because we bought it for like 500 and something bucks. And now I don't think you can

37:35.720 --> 37:41.480
find them for cheaper than like 150. Why did I say 150? 1,500?

37:41.480 --> 37:45.240
I was like, that doesn't sound like a deal, Jamie. Okay.

37:46.760 --> 37:53.400
And also my World Cup soccer is going to be coming home. Dan's buddy Brian has been doing some work

37:53.400 --> 37:59.480
to it. So I'll get to play my baby again because I love my World Cup soccer pinball. Other than

38:00.040 --> 38:09.480
that, I want to come over and play pinball when I get the jab.

38:11.080 --> 38:17.320
Actually, Rob, if you're getting regularly tested, I'll submit another test. And if everyone's

38:17.320 --> 38:21.480
clear, you can come over and play pinball. You need to send me the info on your thing

38:21.480 --> 38:25.560
you use because I always have to go get my nose violated.

38:26.520 --> 38:30.520
Well, mine is a nose violation, but I get to violate myself.

38:30.520 --> 38:31.880
We'll talk offline.

38:31.880 --> 38:37.480
Yeah, we'll talk offline. Basically, my work doesn't do quest. So at any rate,

38:39.080 --> 38:42.600
okay, Mimsie, you and I are going to have to talk because you're one of my pinball peoples now.

38:43.240 --> 38:55.400
So my house is full of pinball. But at any rate, I've got a few things on my downloads now.

38:55.480 --> 38:58.360
I actually bought some stuff off my Steam wishlist thanks to the sale.

38:59.160 --> 39:09.960
So like I just picked up a Gencho Night Festival, which is a little platformer that just looks like

39:09.960 --> 39:18.040
it was super fun. And I'm also I got what became of Edith Finch on Switch, so I'm going to be

39:18.040 --> 39:21.160
playing through it there. It's a good game. It's a really good game.

39:21.160 --> 39:27.720
I'm also getting Umehara Kawase, which is another kind of interesting platformer

39:27.720 --> 39:37.240
of a girl with a grappling hook. I'm still debating getting Resident Evil 3. But for

39:37.240 --> 39:44.920
right now, there's just enough games out that like I'm also picking up right now the

39:44.920 --> 39:50.040
Suicide of Rachel Foster because I love those narrative games. I've really kind of gotten

39:50.040 --> 39:54.680
out of the kind of open world thing unless it's like more of a fantasy environment.

39:56.440 --> 40:04.280
And I do, of course, Mass Effect. That's kind of like my speed of game. But I'm really,

40:04.280 --> 40:10.200
really loving the narrative games where it may not seem like a game,

40:12.360 --> 40:17.880
but it's got a story and it's really something that one can get into.

40:18.600 --> 40:23.480
Oh, I'm about to talk about one, and I think it would be one that you'd be into for sure.

40:23.480 --> 40:28.840
I'll get into it in a moment here. But those are absolutely games. We've had this discussion

40:28.840 --> 40:34.840
before about the walking simulator and all that. But you know what? If you are to call the Black

40:34.840 --> 40:39.720
Mirror episode on Netflix a game, which the name escapes me right now, whatever the name of that

40:39.720 --> 40:41.560
game was in the episode. Bandersnatch.

40:41.560 --> 40:47.640
Thank you, Bandersnatch. If that's a game, then these are certainly games. There's lots of

40:48.600 --> 40:55.880
choice and things to go back and revisit. I guess I'll get into it in a minute. But I don't like

40:55.880 --> 41:00.600
when people try to dismiss the narrative games. I really don't. They're games. They're games of a

41:00.600 --> 41:08.680
different type. Look at Atari 2600 games. It was usually push button, go ping. There's the most

41:08.680 --> 41:15.240
basic thing. Pong. Beep, boop, beep, boop. If that's a game, then why can't a narrative experience

41:15.240 --> 41:24.760
be a game? Anyway. Yeah. But at any rate, I have a bunch of stuff that I just really want to sit

41:24.760 --> 41:30.360
down. I have another game called When the Past Was Around that I want to sit and play. I finally

41:30.360 --> 41:36.520
though bought... I have Wattam now that it's on Steam. And I'm going to be streaming Hive Swap

41:37.240 --> 41:44.040
probably in the next couple of weeks. So there's stuff on my plate with plans to actually do stuff.

41:44.040 --> 41:50.680
It's just right now the end of the year business. But I am going to be streaming Hive Swap Act 2

41:50.680 --> 41:56.920
because in my heart of hearts, I am still a Homestuck. All right. Well, let's move on and go

41:56.920 --> 42:03.080
to Loki. How was your gaming week? I tried working on my game most of the week. So I've been trying

42:03.080 --> 42:09.720
to... Still trying to code something to do anime tiles. I was trying to do it the right way and

42:09.800 --> 42:14.360
it's not working. Which I try to... Just a heads up, if you've been out for a few weeks,

42:14.360 --> 42:19.640
we now know that Loki's game is a spiritual successor of shorts called To Pixel Poops

42:19.640 --> 42:23.880
on the NES. Him and YYR had a big press announcement a couple of weeks ago. Anyway,

42:23.880 --> 42:28.840
sorry. Yeah. Just to catch up the people who might be behind. Right, right, right. So I've been

42:28.840 --> 42:36.680
working on that. So I'm doing what like plan C now in which it's going to be basically using

42:37.240 --> 42:41.960
techniques that I already use to switch tiles out for when I do like the actual

42:42.920 --> 42:51.240
pooping in the game. So that works, I know. So it's just not the most elegant way I'd like to

42:51.240 --> 42:57.240
do it, but I'm going to try it and see if it works and how the performance is. And so this

42:57.240 --> 43:01.720
is really my last attempt to get it to work because otherwise I've spent way too long on

43:01.720 --> 43:06.040
trying to get it to work. I do want it to work because it looks nice when it does work.

43:07.000 --> 43:15.000
It just takes a lot to get it to work. So that's when I'm finishing up hopefully this week.

43:15.000 --> 43:23.640
And then I would like to have a demo available at some time soon. I would hopefully like to

43:23.640 --> 43:27.720
get done before the end of the year, but we'll see. But that'd be kind of cool if I could do

43:27.720 --> 43:34.760
that. But actual game playing. So I did play more Minecraft this week. I spent an unreasonably long

43:34.760 --> 43:41.880
amount of time making an automated bee farm. Yes, with a bee statue over the top. So you can get

43:45.640 --> 43:52.040
honeycomb blocks and honey bottles. So it's an automated bee farm. They go in there and they

43:53.720 --> 43:57.880
make honey for you and it just automatically collects it. So that was kind of fun. It was

43:57.880 --> 44:01.960
a relaxing thing to do. And then my kids have been trying to get me to play

44:02.840 --> 44:10.360
more stuff with them with Minecraft. So I've been doing some stuff. My kid will make a level and

44:10.360 --> 44:15.720
wants to do like a little scenario. And so we did that for a few hours. So it's been mainly

44:15.720 --> 44:20.680
Minecraft this week. A little bit of Orna as I've been traveling around just taking over areas and

44:20.680 --> 44:28.120
stuff like that. I wish I could take over more areas like just like out like if I could see it,

44:28.120 --> 44:31.400
I should be able to take over it. But I know there's only a certain radius that you can do

44:31.400 --> 44:37.000
that. So that kind of sucks. But I've just been playing a bit more of that. Still not leveling

44:37.000 --> 44:42.040
up very fast at all. I'm still like 182. The leveling curve gets like exponential. It's kind

44:42.040 --> 44:46.200
of like Pokemon Go in that regard. Even though we're talking about, oh, we're level 180, we're

44:46.200 --> 44:50.840
level 100. It doesn't take that long if you're a little bit dedicated to get to three digit levels.

44:50.840 --> 44:56.840
But then once you start hitting about level 180, the XP curve goes up exponentially and it takes

44:56.840 --> 45:02.600
longer and longer for each level, for sure. Yeah. And you don't get new enemies until I think

45:03.400 --> 45:09.960
every 25 levels. So you'll get them at 200. So it's going to be a while. So, yeah, it's just

45:09.960 --> 45:15.400
been kind of grinding that a little bit. And that's about it. I didn't play any more cyberpunk

45:15.400 --> 45:21.640
yet, although I probably will at some point. And I need to definitely go back to my Xbox Series X

45:21.640 --> 45:28.600
because it's sitting there collecting dust. But yeah, so eventually get to that stuff. But I mean,

45:29.960 --> 45:36.280
I can't think of any games in 2021 that I'm necessarily anticipating yet. So I've got time.

45:37.240 --> 45:44.440
Okay. Mike gave me a week. So speaking of GPS based games, I've been playing a lot of Angers

45:44.440 --> 45:50.120
this past week. I kind of took a break for a few weeks and maybe it's one of those things

45:50.120 --> 45:55.160
where taking a break was good because it kind of got me motivated again. And I hit maximum level

45:55.160 --> 46:00.600
in the game for the second time. So I got all the way to level 16, which is max level for the second

46:00.600 --> 46:07.640
time. And so of course I pushed the button to restart for a third time. And I worked pretty

46:07.640 --> 46:11.960
fast to get right back up to level eight because you have to be level eight in the game to use the

46:11.960 --> 46:16.280
highest gear. So I kind of already had things planned out in my head. I was like, because they

46:16.280 --> 46:21.640
have these things called apexes now, which are sold in the shop, but you get them free during

46:21.640 --> 46:25.480
events and things like that. So I had like 10 or 11 of them built up. So I was like, all right,

46:25.480 --> 46:29.640
I'm going to go downtown. I'm going to go to the cemetery. I'm going to just microfield the whole

46:29.640 --> 46:33.960
thing fast and burn an apex. And I do it. And that's what I did. And I was back to level eight

46:33.960 --> 46:39.480
within maybe two hours of gameplay. So I just, just, you know, thinking my strategy through on

46:39.480 --> 46:44.760
how I was going to do it and it worked out. So that was my big GPS game nerd conquer thing of

46:44.760 --> 46:49.000
the week. Um, but it's, I find that it's been kind of a fun thing to do because it gets me out

46:49.000 --> 46:55.000
of the house. I can sit in my car, listen to podcasts or music or whatever, do some driving.

46:55.000 --> 47:00.120
So at least I feel like I'm moving and it's safe. I'm in my little protected bubble, literal iron

47:00.120 --> 47:04.760
bubble that's on the road and playing my little game and still getting to see things. So that's

47:04.760 --> 47:10.360
kind of, I think why I've been kind of into it right now. Um, so other things that I've been up

47:10.360 --> 47:14.200
to, uh, the game I was talking about with dark soccer. So I played a new game this week, uh,

47:14.200 --> 47:19.560
because of Xbox game pass. I started playing a game called tell me why, uh, which came out,

47:19.560 --> 47:24.040
I think back in September. Uh, it's an X, it's an Xbox game studios game. Yeah. I finally got

47:24.040 --> 47:27.560
around to it. You know, just, it was like, Oh, I should play that. I was kind of looking for

47:27.560 --> 47:30.440
something new to play and I'd heard a lot of things about it. A lot of people on Twitter

47:30.440 --> 47:35.240
had spoken very favorite favoritively of it. And so I started playing it. Um, it is, it is

47:35.240 --> 47:40.760
a narrative based game. It's a very story heavy based games. Uh, it, it involves a series of,

47:40.760 --> 47:46.520
it involves twins and they have these kind of like special powers where they can kind of talk

47:46.520 --> 47:50.360
to each other without actually talking to each other. Like, you know, that, that some people

47:50.360 --> 47:55.000
kind of perceive about twins or, or maybe that really is a thing. I don't know. But, uh, that,

47:55.000 --> 47:58.840
that kind of ends up being kind of central to the plot. Uh, I don't want to get too much into

47:58.840 --> 48:04.040
the plot because I just kind of like started it right off the bat and I was really like taken

48:04.040 --> 48:10.280
aback. I was like, Whoa, I didn't know this game was that fucking dark that quickly. Like it's,

48:10.280 --> 48:16.920
it's kind of like, uh, I don't know if I want to say scary, but it's, uh, um, like, Oh, this is

48:16.920 --> 48:22.040
heavy stuff. I think heavy stuff, I think is a good way to say it. Uh, and it's kind of starts

48:22.040 --> 48:26.680
off right that way. And, um, you know, you just kind of then, then of course the story is just

48:26.680 --> 48:31.720
kind of like peeling back the layers of an onion. It gets deeper and deeper and you kind of start

48:31.720 --> 48:36.760
to learn about the character. What was, what was going on here? What was this thing? What did,

48:36.760 --> 48:41.960
was she, was she, was she good? Was she not good? There's all these weird things going on. So, um,

48:41.960 --> 48:46.680
yeah, unsettling is a good way to put it too. Um, dark soccer, I do think a game like this

48:46.680 --> 48:51.240
would be up your alley. Um, there's been a lot of talk of this game as well. You may have heard

48:51.240 --> 48:57.000
of this game because it focuses, uh, there's a lot of, um, uh, the, the, one of the twins,

48:57.000 --> 49:03.880
um, is a trans man. So there's a lot of talk about, um, transgender in the game because it does

49:03.880 --> 49:10.440
end up, um, be it's, it's kind of, how do I say this without it's, it's a plot device,

49:10.440 --> 49:18.360
but not in poor taste. Like they, they actually, the trans man is voiced by a trans man actor.

49:18.360 --> 49:25.320
They had consultants on the game to make sure they got it right. But that whole experience is

49:25.320 --> 49:31.480
kind of integral to the plot. So I thought it was, it's, it's an interesting way to kind of,

49:33.480 --> 49:39.640
I found it was really fascinating because since you are playing some of the game as, um, and now

49:39.640 --> 49:46.200
I can't remember the character's names. There's Allison, Tyler, Allison and Tyler. That's it. So

49:46.200 --> 49:50.760
Tyler is, and that's not really a spoiler. You find that out very, very, very, very, very early

49:50.760 --> 49:56.520
on within the first 10 minutes, probably. Um, Tyler is, um, a trans man. And since you are

49:56.520 --> 50:06.200
forced to play some of the game as Tyler, you get exposed to some of those awkward experiences where,

50:06.200 --> 50:11.240
and there was a really, like, I'll just say it was a flat out like awkward thing that happened

50:11.240 --> 50:18.600
is that you meet one of the villagers who knew you as a child when, you know, before, um, the,

50:18.600 --> 50:23.640
before transitioning and all that. And there's that very awkward conversation that happens

50:23.640 --> 50:27.400
about, you know, where the, the guy is kind of putting his foot in his mouth and it's,

50:27.400 --> 50:32.360
it's one of those like, well, you got to forgive me because I'm older and we can't follow all your

50:32.360 --> 50:37.480
new way. You know, that whole thing. So it was weird. Yes. But I'm ready to be pissed off,

50:37.480 --> 50:41.000
but then I thought that's good. But you know what? I mean, not pissed off at the game,

50:41.000 --> 50:45.640
but pissed off in game. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I get it. I get it. But I thought it was interesting

50:45.640 --> 50:54.520
because that was deaf. That was definitely a way to illustrate an experience through the art of

50:54.520 --> 51:01.960
video games without necessarily having to be beat over the head with a shoe with it. Does that make

51:01.960 --> 51:10.760
sense? Like by even as awkward as that exchange was, I think it illustrated a very real thing

51:10.760 --> 51:14.520
that I think a lot of trans people have been trying to say, this is, this is, this is why

51:14.520 --> 51:19.640
we have challenges. This is some of the BS that we go through. And they were really able to

51:19.640 --> 51:26.200
illustrate that through the game. And I thought that was really neat. So yeah, I think the game

51:26.200 --> 51:32.360
is pretty cool. I'm not, it's in three parts and I'm like, I don't know how far I am because I

51:32.360 --> 51:37.640
refuse to read spoilers on it. So I would guess I've got to be close to the end of the first part

51:37.640 --> 51:42.760
because each part is only supposed to be like two or three hours. And I've, I swear to God,

51:42.760 --> 51:46.840
I feel like I've been playing part one for three hours, but I'm also the type that's like,

51:46.840 --> 51:54.360
I have to check every item and read everything and solve every puzzle. So maybe I'm just slow.

51:54.360 --> 51:55.560
All the things.

51:57.400 --> 52:05.160
So anyway, yeah, yeah. So, um, yeah, I saw, yeah, I, I thought that was a, a, a neat game and just,

52:05.160 --> 52:12.280
I, I, but I will say, and I'll warn you the way I wasn't warned. The subject matter is a lot darker

52:12.280 --> 52:18.040
than I was anticipating. And that's actually, that's nothing to do with, with the trans part

52:18.040 --> 52:23.000
of it. It just happens to be that the character is, you know, a trans man and his twin sister.

52:23.000 --> 52:29.400
That's just another element of the story. So. Yeah, it was, I, I, I, I want to finish more

52:29.400 --> 52:35.560
before I absolutely say I recommend it or I don't recommend it. Um, but so far I'm feeling I, I,

52:35.560 --> 52:39.480
so far I've enjoyed the first two, three hours I've played. So I feel like that's a leaning

52:39.480 --> 52:45.720
towards a positive recommendation. So, well, I just bought it. So there you go. I mean,

52:45.720 --> 52:49.240
I don't know if I'm going to get a chance to play it and I'm probably going to get yelled at,

52:49.240 --> 52:57.400
but I bought it. There you go. Oh, very good point. See a Tiberian chat over Twitch TV slash

52:57.400 --> 53:03.160
vlog network says it also has a lot about indigenous cultures in this fictional area

53:03.160 --> 53:07.800
of Alaska. You're right. It gets into some of that as well. I don't think I'm like heavy,

53:07.800 --> 53:13.160
maybe into some of those storylines and things yet, but I have noticed that for sure. There's

53:13.160 --> 53:17.800
like decorations and things in the house that they come across and stuff like that. So, um,

53:18.840 --> 53:24.360
I'm curious to see more of how that kind of unfolds and develops. So, um, yeah. So there's

53:24.360 --> 53:29.800
that, um, if my shirt that I'm wearing on Twitch with Fennekin on it is any indication, of course,

53:29.800 --> 53:34.760
I've been continuing to play Pokemon, uh, sword and shield, which Fennekin isn't in, but I've

53:34.760 --> 53:41.240
been working on my decks, uh, in those games and I'm up past 300. I'm up to like 320 something.

53:41.240 --> 53:44.920
I think in my short sword and shield decks. So I'm getting closer, I'm getting down. I did a

53:44.920 --> 53:51.640
lot of trades with, um, Shane this past week. So like I got the Zastian in my decks and I got the,

53:51.640 --> 53:57.640
um, the thing like, uh, you have to trade, um, Machomp to get Machoke or did I get that backwards,

53:57.640 --> 54:01.000
but y'all know what I mean? You know, you have to trade certain things. So we did some of that.

54:01.080 --> 54:04.840
And that was like, I had to check off like 12, 13 things off the list there. So that was,

54:04.840 --> 54:09.560
uh, that was good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, yeah, I've been enjoying Pokemon.

54:09.560 --> 54:12.680
I don't think I'm going to get back into Pokemon, uh, anytime soon.

54:12.680 --> 54:17.800
You never, you know what? It just like, for me, it just fucking clicked one day. I just,

54:17.800 --> 54:21.960
and I think I was talking about Pokemon go and Pokemon home and all of that just suddenly made

54:21.960 --> 54:27.320
me go, well, you know what guys, I'm going to catch them all. I'm going to finally do it. I'm

54:27.320 --> 54:32.760
going to go catch them all. And it's, it's a, it's a thing to do now that, you know, quarantine and

54:32.760 --> 54:36.040
COVID and all that crap's going on. Um, and I'm trying to think if there's anything else in my

54:36.040 --> 54:40.280
game a week, I feel like there's one other game. I played a little more destiny to, uh, still been

54:40.280 --> 54:45.480
playing that, uh, joined a clan of Twitter people. Cause I guess our VOG network clan,

54:45.480 --> 54:51.240
like officially got killed because of inactivity. Oops. Uh, so I joined a clan with Twitter people.

54:51.240 --> 54:57.640
Um, and I don't remember, uh, what else notable that I did in that game yet. I think I still have

54:57.640 --> 55:02.680
to do a fire strike and I'm nervous about being, uh, going in there to do all that thing. So

55:02.680 --> 55:07.960
there's that. All right. Um, let's see, we're going to get into, so that's it for my gaming

55:07.960 --> 55:12.360
week. Let's get into gaming news first, before we get to gaming news, I actually have a couple

55:12.360 --> 55:17.640
like housekeeping things to talk about. Um, number one, and Bobby said this in chat, um, but I'll

55:17.640 --> 55:23.000
reemphasize it here during our little housekeeping segment is that, um, next week we will still be

55:23.000 --> 55:27.640
here during OLR. Um, we're not going to like hold the show or anything, but I should point out that

55:27.640 --> 55:34.280
awesome games done quick. Um, the big charity event, uh, does start next Sunday. Um, and VOG

55:34.280 --> 55:38.520
network's own Bobby Black Wolf is now a part of that event. So for the second time, he's going to

55:38.520 --> 55:42.840
be one of the announcers during that event. And he went over the whole schedule on his show. And of

55:42.840 --> 55:50.040
course in the moment, I can't remember everything. I know Devil May Cry 5 was one of the games,

55:50.040 --> 55:56.200
uh, in there. Uh, and then he had, um, did he get the Kings? I can't remember. He says Wednesday and

55:56.200 --> 55:59.720
Friday night. Thank you. Wednesday and Friday night. Sorry. When I'm put on the spot, I can't,

55:59.720 --> 56:03.800
I just go blank. Um, but he's actually gonna be doing some of the hosting. So that's exciting.

56:03.800 --> 56:07.720
Thank you. Devil May Cry 3, Yoshi's Island and Yakuza 6. That's it. Thank you. Thank you. Those

56:07.720 --> 56:11.880
are the games he's going to be hosting. So we'll be checking that out Wednesday and Friday night.

56:11.880 --> 56:20.040
Um, but, uh, I, that all starts on Sunday. So check it out. Um, remember it's about the charity.

56:20.040 --> 56:24.440
So if you're going to donate to try to get Bobby Black Wolf to read your shout out and you can

56:24.440 --> 56:30.760
listen to his show for more details on how that works. Um, but, um, just like I've learned that

56:30.760 --> 56:37.080
I can't say Mr. Smoosh donated 50 bucks because the screeners don't know what Mr. Smoosh is. And

56:37.080 --> 56:41.960
so they assume it's porn, which they have to do. They have to do. So I'll have to take a different

56:41.960 --> 56:47.800
approach, um, next time. So maybe you could do Mr. Smoosh, the cat. Yeah. I think that's what I'm

56:47.800 --> 56:51.720
going to do is next time. Well, I shouldn't say this so openly as I'm trying to surprise Bobby,

56:51.720 --> 56:56.600
but I'll say me and my cat, Mr. Smoosh are watching. And I say, keep up the good work.

56:56.600 --> 57:04.200
And Mr. Smoosh says meow meow and that maybe something like that. Yeah. My bowl is empty.

57:04.200 --> 57:13.320
Feed me. So anyway, she for once is not in here harassing me. You could check that out. Uh, Bobby

57:13.320 --> 57:17.080
has more details on all of that. If you want some insight on how all that works, that's all on his

57:17.080 --> 57:20.680
show, the Bobby Black Wolf show. So check that out during awesome games done quick. Um, another

57:20.680 --> 57:26.920
housekeeping thing, this, this kind of, cause this is the last show of 2020, right? So next week,

57:26.920 --> 57:31.800
we're going to go into 2021. And you know, I was watching a friend of mine was doing a Twitch

57:31.800 --> 57:36.840
stream, somebody who, who watches, um, the, the stuff here at a VOG network. I'll say it was act

57:36.840 --> 57:41.960
deaf. I was watching a stream of his and, um, you know, kind of the subject came up about how

57:43.400 --> 57:47.000
this show has been going for 18 and a half years. That's a very long time.

57:47.000 --> 57:52.120
There's not a lot of shows that do something like that. And, um, this has been a year that's

57:52.120 --> 57:57.320
really old record. This has been a year that's really challenged us in many ways, right? Like,

57:57.320 --> 58:02.680
you know, that I pride this show on, you know, cause people ask like, how have you kept the

58:02.680 --> 58:06.680
show going on so long? How do you guys find the motivation for the show? And my answer has kind

58:06.680 --> 58:10.360
of always been, well, you know, Dark Soccer, Logie, myself, it's kind of our excuse to get

58:10.360 --> 58:14.200
together every week. We get together in person and we, you know, get to hang out. We do this

58:14.200 --> 58:17.960
little show and people listen and it's a good time. And I think we've kind of been writing

58:17.960 --> 58:24.600
that energy, but 2020 and all of its events have really kind of made us rethink some of that

58:24.600 --> 58:28.920
because I've always kind of sat here and gone, we're not going to go to an all virtual show

58:30.200 --> 58:36.680
because that's every other podcast does that. We only got a special thing, lol. 2020 had other

58:36.680 --> 58:40.840
plans in store and we've gone to a virtual format. And I would say for the most part, it's worked.

58:40.840 --> 58:45.160
Now this isn't me about to announce that like, we're going to virtual forever or anything like

58:45.160 --> 58:50.200
that. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that I don't know. Nobody does. Cause we don't know

58:50.200 --> 58:54.360
where these roads are leading into 2021. We hope, you know, there's light at the end of the tunnel

58:54.360 --> 59:03.160
and all that. But I think it's really cool that 2020 threw these curve balls at us. And we were

59:03.160 --> 59:07.640
able to kind of rise up to that and keep this show going. And that, of course, that's not just me.

59:07.640 --> 59:12.520
That's huge. Thanks to Dark Sakura and Loki as well. I mean, Dark Sakura, shit. She might've

59:12.520 --> 59:17.960
had COVID in those early episodes. Like not to make light of it, but you documented it.

59:17.960 --> 59:23.160
But my blood test says I didn't. But then again, they're also like,

59:23.160 --> 59:27.880
oh, and half of the people don't develop antibodies and I'm like, thanks bitch.

59:27.880 --> 59:35.080
Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, and then I had it, I had it twice or it was really pneumonia.

59:35.080 --> 59:40.440
And we know one of the guests we bring on this show all the time, Shane had COVID. He said that

59:40.440 --> 59:45.720
on the show. It's not a secret. And I talked about that because I just went to visit him.

59:45.720 --> 59:49.880
I was basically exposed now to get a test and I was negative and all that. But I mean,

59:49.880 --> 59:54.120
obviously that whole issue has hit close to home here at OLR one way or another.

59:54.680 --> 59:58.840
I've lost two friends this past year. Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. I think, I think

59:59.720 --> 01:00:05.960
if we don't all know somebody directly, we know somebody who's been impacted. I can certainly say

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:12.120
that for sure. And I almost didn't get to see my dad before he died. I mean, yeah, he's in Alabama,

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:19.160
3000 miles away. But when his test came back negative, one of the nurses pulled some strings

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:26.760
for my sister and got him a private room and said that, that she and my mother, I mean, my mom and

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:33.800
dad had been divorced since I was, you know, nine months old, but but my mom was in there too. And

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:41.160
they let them in to have two one hour sessions. And the first session was when dad woke up enough

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:48.440
to, they actually took him off the morphine long enough for him to see me on the phone and wave and

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:56.360
try to say something. And then the next time I saw him on a phone stream, he was dead three hours

01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:05.240
later. So and I almost didn't get that because of COVID. But, you know, his test came back negative

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:09.720
and they pulled some strings. Well, thank gosh, you got that at least. I mean, obviously that's a,

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:14.200
you know, terrible scenario. And I'm sorry that that happened. But, you know, at least there was

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:19.400
that little light that like, at least you got a chance to, you know, communicate in one way or

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:24.200
another. So that is far more than a lot of people have gotten. That's right. One of my friends right

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:31.880
now, her aunt had a stroke and can't be seen by anybody. That was my dad. That was my dad this

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:39.080
summer had that. Her aunt went nonverbal and half paralyzed. So there's no one who can be there with

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:46.680
her and help her with her affairs or help with consent or anything. So, you know, and all these

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:52.680
people who are like that one Karen that they had in that was CVS or something arguing about not

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:58.920
wearing her mask. I can't those people. I can't even watch those videos anymore. I just can't

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:04.840
with something hard and sandpapery. And my dad made a virtual full recovery for the record.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:08.520
He got very lucky in that regard. So thank you. I'm really happy about that. Thank you,

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:14.440
everybody who is thinking through the good guy. Yeah, well, he does have some lingering things

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:19.400
like he clears his throat a lot more. I know it's a weird thing and he coughs. So we're always kind

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:25.640
of like, is it the COVID? Is it COVID? But it's not. It's just some weird lingering thing that's

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:30.840
kind of sitting there. You know what I mean? So anyway, let me get you some more positive vibes

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:36.200
from our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network where SSJ100 Matt says, I would like to say thank

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:41.880
you for all the vog hosts for getting us through this crummy year of 2020. Well, thank you so much

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:45.720
for saying that, because honestly, you know, I can't totally speak for dark soccer and Loki,

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:53.160
but I know for me, the reverse is true for me, like you guys being here on Sunday night gives

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:56.920
me some and throughout the week on the podcast and all that your feedback, emails, tweets and

01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:01.720
all that. It gives me something to look forward to throughout this shithole of the year. You know

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:09.080
what I mean? Right. Like it gives me a sense of at least I got this one thing I can look forward to,

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:15.080
you know, happy hour at Chili's. Nope. Don't get that. But at least I've got happy hour at OLR,

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:21.480
you know? So exactly. It's given me that. So thank you guys for that. I really, really give us life

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:28.280
for sure. For sure. Okay. Um, let's get into, let's get into the video game news. We're really

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:31.800
here for it. But I just kind of wanted to acknowledge that is that like, despite the fact

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:36.440
that we had a shitty year, we've had some curveballs. We did something I said we were

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:43.480
never going to do. Not that that's ever happened on OLR before. And we and we made it and we're

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:48.120
okay. So and big thanks to dark soccer and Loki for navigating these tricky waters. Of course,

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:53.480
I couldn't do it without you guys. Because people say, how have you gone for 18 years? And it's the

01:03:53.480 --> 01:04:00.360
it's it's all of us. It's not just one of us. We've all done it, you know? Yeah. So and it's

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:06.920
it's our thing. Although I really do think maybe we should contact Guinness. Maybe is is perfectly

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:10.520
normal. And this goes back to the original point I had been talking about with Act F.

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:17.720
It is perfectly normal for shows to rotate hosts and have new people. And, you know,

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:21.800
somebody gets burned out. So somebody new comes in or somebody else gets an opportunity. Somebody

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:26.760
new comes in. Look at the look at the view, for fuck's sake, which is probably been going

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:32.360
about as long as this show. How many women have been on that show? A ton, right? And there's lots

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:37.720
of podcasts out there where that's the case. But then and I was telling Act F, we're the weird ones.

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:42.520
We're the weird ones because we haven't changed in 18 and a half years. And I wouldn't have it

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:50.680
any other way. Rotate right now. This chair spins. Yes. Coming to you next week, your new co-host

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:58.040
Sabol is going to be hosting the show. Okay. Forget it. All right. Let's move on. Let's get

01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:00.920
into video games. That's what we're here to talk about the gaming community. Loki,

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:06.600
give us some news, please. So we talked about one of the frustrations before with the PlayStation 5

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:11.560
was playing some of these games that you may own. You're not sure which version of the game you're

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:17.000
actually loading up and playing. I think we're like Spider-Man, Destiny and stuff like that.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.360
There was issues where you have to download multiple copies and stuff like that. Well, now,

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:26.120
thanks to an update, they have a brand new confirmed game version pop up that happens

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:31.800
when you load a multi-generation game that allows you to choose to play the PlayStation 4 version

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:38.520
or to switch to the PlayStation 5 version. Which definitely helps with the confusion there and

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:44.440
why you would ever choose to play the PlayStation 4 version for whatever reason on a PlayStation 5.

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:49.560
I don't know, but it does. They're giving you the option to do that, but at least it kind of

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:56.760
eliminates that confusion that may happen with that. So that's kind of nice. I don't know if

01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:02.280
that necessarily prevents you from having to install multiple versions of a game, but

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:06.040
if they have something similar, if they have something similar like that on the storefront,

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:10.200
you know, the pick which version you want to install, that'd be pretty helpful as well.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.840
PS5 owners, do you guys have insight on that? Like, did this fix the installs both issue?

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:20.680
Because even Bobby's kind of pointing out, I had a monologue about this issue. No Man's Sky

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:25.640
defaulted to the PS4 version when I put the disc in. And yeah, of course, why do I want to play

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:30.200
the old one? I mean, there might be a reason why you want to go back to the old one, maybe a

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:36.200
feature, I don't know, something. But for the most part, people want to play the new one. That's true

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:41.320
in the Xbox world, that's for sure. It is still a work in progress. Like the article is talking

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:47.640
about that, you know, it didn't it worked in Destiny 2, but you didn't see the pop up in

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:54.200
Watchdog legions only until they went to manually install the upgraded PlayStation 5 version. Did

01:06:54.200 --> 01:07:01.480
they get the warning to play the PlayStation 5 version versus the PlayStation 4? So I guess,

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:07.720
no, it does not, you know, address the multiple installs, but at least they'll know when you're

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:13.240
playing the wrong version. They really should just have an option to download which version you want,

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:19.240
or just, you know, hey, it's a PlayStation 5. You know, I'm upgrading to the PlayStation 5 version,

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:24.120
you know, once that's available, and then, hey, would you like to install the PlayStation 4 version?

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:29.080
You know, that would be nice to have that option on there so that you're not filling up your very

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:35.800
limited hard drive. Bobby does point out No Man's Sky VR is only in the PlayStation 4 version,

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:40.520
so there's an excellent illustration. Sometimes the PlayStation 4 may have something that the

01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:45.880
PS5 doesn't have yet. Sorry, Jamie. I guess that makes sense. If you're moving files, you know,

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:51.480
you have, do you want to replace this? Do you want to copy? Yeah, so they have the choice. Yes,

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:56.280
right. Yeah, but why doesn't the PlayStation 5 version have VR? I mean,

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:04.760
great question. Well, do you want it to be pretty or do you want VR? I mean,

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:09.400
pick one. Well, PS5, we all know. That's not necessarily true. Joking, joking, joking.

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:17.720
Just like, you know, with, you know, anything, even like with the PlayStation 4 Pro and stuff,

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:24.360
they had options where you can pick, and I'm sure the same is with Spider-Man and stuff like that,

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:30.600
where you can pick multiple options. So like you have, you know, the ray tracing 60 FPS,

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:35.320
but your resolution slightly reduced, or you can do the full resolution of ray tracing,

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:39.640
but your frame rate slightly reduced, or you can just turn off ray tracing and just have,

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:45.400
you know, the 4K and, you know, 120 FPS or whatever the case may be with that. I don't

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:49.480
know the resolution on that. So why not just have that option there? It's like,

01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:54.040
Hey, I see you're playing on VR. We're going to pipe this through a 1080.

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:58.440
And hold on. Cause I said something about it. Yeah. And this is, this is important too,

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:03.560
is that, and Bobby does say in chat, PSVR is not native to the PS5. It won't be native to

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:08.760
the PS5 until 2022. They decided the market for PSVR wasn't there to put it on the PS5

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:12.440
natively at launch, but they still support it in backwards compatibility mode, right?

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:16.200
Because we had those adapters that you could, you know, contact Sony and you get the adapters for

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:23.400
free. So, and even before Bobby said that I was going to say, um, there, we know PSVR is coming

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:28.440
to the PlayStation 5. It's just not here yet without the adaptor. Forget what it is.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.640
And here's the thing, here's the thing as much as you might kind of tease Sony about the whole

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:40.600
weird VR issue in a sense, I kind of get it because imagine if they had put out PSVR with

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:47.480
the PlayStation 5, I mean, number one, PlayStation fives are hard enough to get. Can you imagine,

01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:52.200
you know, now throw a VR unit into that and how, how hard is that going to be to get with the

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:57.720
production? And then on the other hand. Okay. So you're going to buy a $500 console. And then on

01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:03.560
top of that, a $300, $400 headset, they're going to ask you to buy that day one. Hell no.

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:06.840
In a pandemic where people are unemployed. Yeah. Throw that out there too.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:12.360
People aren't going to do it right. There will be some right, Bobby, there'll be some that would do

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:18.920
it. But I think for the most part, the market in general is not ready for that kind of ask

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:24.360
for another couple of years, because now when we come into 2022, it'll be, oh, okay. It's,

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:27.720
it's been two years since you've dropped your, you know, 500 on the console.

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:33.480
Now we want to sell you this three, $400, uh, VR headset or what have you. That's,

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:38.680
that's the long game Sony's planning. There's no way they could have asked you for 500 bucks twice

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.880
this year, whatever it is. Yeah. So that, that's what it really is. Anyway,

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:44.840
we kind of got off the path of what the story was about, but that's all right.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:54.920
All right. So it it's, um, it's at least something right now, kind of a bandaid for the situation,

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:59.880
but it's not perfect. I don't know if the way they have everything set up right now is perfect

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:04.520
anyways, but obviously that's a problem that sort of goes away as time progresses.

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:10.520
PlayStation's also been very good about like huge firmware updates on their end. So like I,

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:15.000
and you know, I don't have a PlayStation five right now. I probably will get one next year.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.080
Um, in fact, knowing that VR will be a thing in two years, I should probably get my PlayStation

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:23.560
next year, not wait two years to get it. I w I don't see myself being able to wait that long

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:29.240
anyway. Um, but, uh, you know, by the time I get it next year, I feel like the firmware is going

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:32.920
to be in a place where like, none of this is even going to be under discussion anymore.

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:36.120
Like it's going to be a lot smoother and all that good stuff.

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:40.360
We're waiting for next year anyway, before we decide which one we may or may not get.

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:47.080
I think there's a lot of people waiting for next year, period, just for everything, you know?

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:48.040
Yeah, pretty much.

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:54.120
Well, hopefully next year won't be the, you know, the, the, the floating dumpster fire this year

01:11:54.120 --> 01:12:00.280
was. I honestly, truly don't think it will be. And then granted, I've been stupidly optimistic

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:06.280
throughout this whole thing, but I really do think like, for, for, for a lot of us,

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:11.240
uh, there will be a way out of this situation pretty, pretty soon. Well, relatively soon,

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:16.600
four or five, six months, it's going to be some other people and, you know, that are gonna,

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:20.600
you know, make this still a headline for a long time, unfortunately.

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:21.180
Yeah.

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:24.200
But I'll, but I'll be able to go to your house and play pinball.

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:31.560
Yes. Yes. A lot, all the pinballs are, well, I don't know, Dan's got stuff sitting on top

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:34.200
of my theater of magic right now, and I'm kind of mad about it.

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:39.560
Uh oh. All right. Let's move on. Let's talk about our next story, which has to do with,

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:43.320
well, this, this is something that's going to make people sad about 2021.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.000
Not me.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:45.500
Yeah, I know.

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:49.080
That's true. Not Jamie.

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:49.720
Not me.

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:54.360
There's a halo joke there. Okay. So this is about halo. Here's the deal. So a pretty big,

01:12:54.360 --> 01:13:00.920
uh, bombshell was announced this past week, uh, where halo is going to be ending their online

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:09.800
services in December of 2021, meaning the halo games that were for the Xbox 360 original Xbox

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:14.200
actually already ended some time ago. You may or may not have remembered that, but the Xbox

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:21.880
360 games, and there's a lot of them, halo reach halo for halo three halo three ODST halo combat

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:27.160
evolved anniversary, Spartan assault, halo wars, all of those games being sunsetted,

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:32.680
but you have a whole year to enjoy what you've got. Okay. So December, 2021 is when those are

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:41.080
going away. Now some clarity on this. If I am playing the games in backward compatibility mode

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:46.760
on my Xbox one or Xbox series X, will I no longer to be able to play online? And the answer is

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:51.400
you will no longer be able to play online, even in backwards compatibility mode. Okay. Because,

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:56.600
uh, it is actually those three 60 games and their servers that are going away very similar to the,

01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:02.280
uh, OG halo and halo two. When the original Xbox went away, you can, you can play a rich,

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:07.720
some original Xbox games, including halo on the series X. That's, what's pretty rad about the

01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:12.520
Microsoft landscape right now, but you can't play it online. Sorry to say, because the servers are

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:18.520
gone and that's going to be the same case with these games. Now, what it won't impact is, and

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:26.520
here's, here's kind of the aha moment, the master chief collection, which includes halo, halo two,

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:31.800
halo three, halo four, and probably eventually pretty much everything I just named over there,

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:35.320
save maybe the tactical actually, no, I think one of those tactical games already in there,

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:41.880
but anyway, the halo master chief collection, that is not affected. That is technically an Xbox

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:46.040
one title. And so the servers fat. So if you want to play halo two, you have to do it through the

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:49.800
master chief collection, and that's how you're going to be able to do it moving forward. So

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:55.640
that's what you have as opposed to the master chef collection, which I consistently typoed it.

01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:04.600
Um, now, uh, so that, you know, and considering a lot of Microsoft people are on game pass right now

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:10.360
and the master chief collection is with game pass, or you probably bought an Xbox one when

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:15.880
the master chief collection was included. I know I did, um, this, that, that's what you've got. And

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:21.080
that game is still going, uh, and no plans to end that there. So I do think it's, it's interesting.

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:25.560
I mean, there is that moment of, oh, memories with halo three and stuff like that, you know,

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:30.600
in some of these other games, but it's like, eh, is it halo three came out in what, like 2006?

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:35.160
Like it's a, it's an old game, you know, so I'm not terribly surprised.

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:40.360
Say they didn't support their titles. So yeah, this isn't an EA situation. What's that?

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:47.720
Remember when I got married and you came to my bachelorette party? Yes. Dan was having a halo

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:55.640
two land party. Oh yeah. Good times. Yeah. Um, with what we, they had like eight Xboxes hooked up

01:15:55.640 --> 01:16:03.480
to eight CRT TVs in my house. And, and then I think halo three was just on the horizon

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:08.760
after that. So it's been a while. Uh, and Mimsie 94 in chat says they better try remasters,

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:14.040
those games, dammit for what it's worth. I think ODST is in the master chief collection now.

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:17.640
And that is, that is it. So the master chief collection is the remasters. You can play those

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:24.040
in 4k and that's on PC and it's on Xbox one and series X. Um, and if you have game pass,

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:28.280
it's, it's a big part of it. Cause obviously that's Microsoft's big thing. So yeah. I mean,

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:32.760
as, as much of a bummer as this news is, at least they're giving a full year's notice.

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:37.480
So you got a whole year to party hard. Um, and uh, also what I think is interesting,

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:45.320
what they list in phase two. So right now, as of December, 2020 halo Xbox three 60 DLC can still

01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:50.200
be acquired at no cost. I think that's all kind of included in master chief collection anyway.

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.880
So maybe most people didn't notice this, but if for whatever reason you want to go play

01:16:54.760 --> 01:17:00.520
the old 360 versions, the DLC is there for the taken now. So you get a whole year to party hard

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:04.920
and then they're going to pull the plug, but they haven't said exactly what day they just,

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:11.480
it's that vague December, 2021, but no sooner than one year from the date of the blog,

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:17.160
which was December 21st. So maybe for Christmas, that's what you get for Christmas. The plug's

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:24.120
going to get pulled. No, I would, I would assume, I would assume December 31st is just the nice

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:30.920
round day. They're going to pull the plug, but we'll, we'll see. So, all right. So, uh,

01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:36.360
enjoy your halo three 60 while at last I was going to ask if anybody has any halo three 60 memories

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:41.400
they want to share Jamie, I know you don't Loki. Did you play, did you play other than having to

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:46.680
do halo as my classic game, but that wasn't even on the three 60. That's the original box. They

01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:53.240
pulled that one. Like the most halo love one will get from me. I did other than red versus blue. I

01:17:53.240 --> 01:18:00.600
love red versus blue. I played through halo three and I think we played a little bit of multiplayer

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:07.400
in our game room on halo three for a very short period of time. But, uh, that was about it. We

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:13.800
didn't really do that. I don't have a ton of experience with it. I played three when it first

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:18.360
came out for sure, because that was like the three 60 game that was being hyped up, you know,

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:22.920
and I loved halo two. So I was like, all right, I'm gonna play halo three. I remember not enjoying

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:27.800
the multiplayer as much in three. It's the game that every it's, it's the demo that everybody

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:34.520
bought crackdown for. Yes. Yes. There's that too. I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, yeah. So anyway,

01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:39.160
um, good memories, but again, the master chief collection is still around. So halo ain't going

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:45.080
anywhere and then halo infinite's coming out. So eventually, so, um, and by the way,

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:50.200
just to explain to people who are new to the show, I don't really hate halo. I just don't enjoy halo.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.680
It's an inside joke. That's it's a long, admittedly gotten out of hand. All right,

01:18:55.720 --> 01:19:00.760
let's get into speaking of jokes that have gotten out of hand, dark soccer. This ain't a joke. This

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:06.840
is real and I'm excited. This is the console I want to get. It's on the top of my fucking list.

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:14.440
Um, what is the, uh, uh, KFC is doing a gaming console and it has a chicken warmer

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:22.040
and it's called the KF console. Yeah. Um, it's not a joke. I thought it was a joke.

01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:26.120
I thought it was a joke too. It's more of a fancy case than it is the console.

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:34.440
Don't ruin my, my, my, my joy. I'm not saying that it's, it is in your side of the pool. Okay.

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:44.920
No, yeah. Fifth dream is the top of my bucket list. Um, at any rate, um, the, uh, KF console

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:49.000
is going to be coming out, I guess it's going to be out of the Kentucky fried console.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:56.520
That's just so hilarious. Um, but at any rate, um, it is going, it's being made in a partnership

01:19:56.520 --> 01:20:04.840
with a cooler masters, a PC maker. Um, it's going to be, uh, really a customized PC, um,

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:10.920
that will run 4k games with 240 frames per second, which is twice the frame rate of the

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:16.920
Xbox series X and PS five will have twice as much storage as those systems. It's going to be using,

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:24.360
um, an Intel, uh, nine, uh, extreme compute element that will house an Intel core. I nine

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:33.240
has a hot swappable GPU. Um, just it's, it's a PC. It's a, it's a fucking PC where, where if,

01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:40.760
if there's anything, maybe KFC engineers built a Linux branded thing that will show up as the OS,

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:46.440
maybe something like that, essentially it's a PC, but at any rate, it will support ray tracing

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:52.840
VR and has a heated interior chamber for warming your chicken.

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:58.760
So when you play world of Warcraft, you can unironically say, at least I have chicken,

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:06.920
but it's, it's in the whole idea of heating. I wonder if that's just with the,

01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:14.200
it's just going to run fan is coming from the CPU. It'll keep it warm. Here's what I want to know.

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:18.440
Why limit it to just a chicken warmer? Can you put other things in there? Like, like a baby,

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:23.880
like what else can go in there? It just makes me think that I'm going to have something I can play

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:28.760
I'm going to have something I can play games on that smells like fucking fried chicken.

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:32.360
And you know what? I'm enough of a rebel that I would put jolly be in it instead.

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:36.920
Is it like, I can't, I can't wait to see those controllers after everybody. Oh, I'm sorry.

01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:41.480
Keyboard and mouse after everything. We'll have to get those, uh, the grease proof ones that they

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:49.400
had for a, what was it? Pub G is it, is it hot enough where it's like an easy bake oven or you

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:57.240
can make little cookies like in an easy bake oven. Can I bake in it? Can I, can I, can I bake

01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:03.800
in it? But when my fan was busted on, on my computer, on my gaming PC, I used to actually

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:08.840
just leave my cup of coffee sitting on it. Cause it would stay warm. How did, how does the KF

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:16.280
console handle vape smoke? We need to, that's a question we ask in this day and age. That whole,

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:23.000
the vape thing was the dumbest of the dumb. Okay. So one thing though, I'm watching their

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.600
little commercial again and you know what was really awesome about this commercial

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:33.720
Mustang, someone's driving a Mustang. Um, you know, you gotta say, you gotta hand it to, uh,

01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:39.240
Kentucky fried chickens branding and whoever's doing that whole stuff because they, they've

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:44.920
really not slowed down in 2020. I mean, they've got this, there was that lifetime movie that was

01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:51.480
like completely unironically like Mario Lopez or whatever as the, the, um, as the kernel,

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:58.120
even though Reba McEntire is my favorite kernel, but Mario Lopez and some romantic, uh,

01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:04.760
lifetime. Okay. So this thing, I'm looking at their mock-up of it on the little commercial

01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:12.600
and I can't even right now. I mean, I so can't even that. I can't odd even. That's right. I

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:18.040
forgot. I'm finding the tweet to show people. Jopium three one three and Chad is saying they

01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:25.800
had a dating SIM. I forgot about that. Oh yeah. I was, I have, um, the, the dating SIM it's, um,

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:31.160
I love you, Colonel Sanders. So then, you know what, but here's the thing. Here we are. We've

01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:36.680
just given KFC like five, five minutes silver Fox daddy. So that's why I thought they're using

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:42.680
there. They're just exhausting the hot air through the top and the neck blows through event with

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:49.880
chicken. So I can imagine that would be so amazing because now you're going to have somehow hot air

01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:54.760
has got to get in there. So that means that there is some sort of ventilation or holes in there,

01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:58.840
which means if they're going to get through there, then chicken grease can get right through there

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:06.440
as well. So that's going to be a big old mess, but sure. Let's try it. I'm you know what we've

01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:10.760
just given KFC like a free five minute commercial on this show though. So I will say I'm with Jamie

01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:16.280
where I will unironically put my Popeyes chicken sandwich in the warmer. I have just take that

01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:25.240
officially followed the KFC gaming Twitter. Get a free console, Jamie and a terrace of one now,

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:35.480
maybe they've got like a bunch of fun. They're UK based as well. They've got 208,000 followers. So

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:42.040
sure. Why not? SSJ 100 Mountain Chat says KFC tried and succeeded to outdo Arby's Twitter.

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:46.120
What is with like, and this was a thing that's been going for like three, four, maybe five years

01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:53.000
now. These like Twitter brand on Twitter is like, it's gone off the rocker. Like it started with

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Wendy's. That whole thing. You know, it started with Wendy's. It did start with Wendy's.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:07.800
Steakham is on there now. Arby's though, you know, they've got one of us in their PR group who does

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:14.440
all this cardboard. I mean, it's all made from their like materials and it's, I'm living for

01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:19.960
the Arby's Twitter. Now the KFC one is like, I don't know. I don't know. There's good stuff

01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:26.520
coming out of it. And it's not just food chains now. Now Dionne Warwick is back and hey, I have

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:30.600
a lot of love for Dionne Warwick and her Twitter account is fucking fire. Her daughter taught her

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:36.280
how to Twitter. Good. Cause she's brightened up the Twitterverse. It wasn't her knees. Yeah,

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:40.520
her knees. Brittany, somebody. They did, they did, they did a sketch on Saturday Night Live and it

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:43.560
was, it's like one of the funniest things I've seen on Saturday Night Live in a long time where

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:46.760
she goes, can you put a hex on Wendy Williams? You look like a spooky bitch. Can you put a

01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:52.680
hex on Wendy Williams for me? I died. It was great. And Dionne Warwick took the whole thing

01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:58.360
to don't give a fuck. I love it. I'm loving the deal. And now here's the other big thing I just

01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:05.320
saw this week. Eve six, the band from the nineties. Uh, but I would swallow my pride. I would joke.

01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:09.800
I don't want to get shut down. I hate that song. Okay. But go look at their Twitter

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:18.280
because they have just, they have entered the town of no fucks Ville. And what was it?

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:22.280
He wrote a tweet earlier that would have been retweeted a billion times that said,

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:26.840
had a one hit wonder song in the nineties and can't get insurance or something like that. Like,

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:33.000
it's just, it's crazy. Uh, uh, pin tweet. Pretty sure we're going to be huge again.

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:39.400
Anyway. All right. Oh yeah, no. Okay. This is absolutely worth following. This was like my

01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:47.480
kind of, of dry, but don't give a fuck humor. Right. All right. Anyway, let's move on. We got

01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:53.800
from K we got from KFC to, to Twitter talk to the screensaver coming on my Mac, which I hope

01:26:53.800 --> 01:27:01.480
didn't shut down the stream for once. Rob, I think we're good. We went from per instead of being,

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:07.640
uh, distracted by food. We were distracted from food. That is an OLR first.

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:15.000
Maybe the future is a scary place. We've jumped the shark, Rob. We didn't just jump the shark.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:20.120
We blew it up. Let's move on. Let's get into some news, maybe a little, a little, a little

01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:24.360
less scary. Maybe something that we can look forward to in 2021. Uh, Loki, what do you have

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:33.240
for us? All right. Um, yes. So, well, actually, um, the COVID relief bill just passed. Um, they

01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:39.960
just signed it into law. So that's wonderful. And a part of that, of course, because they shoved the

01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:46.520
whole, hold up, hold up. Did, did he actually sign it finally after all the actually signed

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:52.360
it finally about fucking time. Jesus. All right. So he's, that must've happened during the show.

01:27:52.360 --> 01:28:00.280
Cause I missed that. Yeah. It just breaking. So, um, well, I guess it was raining on the

01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:05.560
golf course. Wasn't it anyway? Sorry. Go ahead. You have to do something. I guess he got bored,

01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:15.160
but I already did something today. Um, so with that, of course, so it wasn't just a COVID relief

01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:19.560
bill. It was also their, um, spending bill for the, I can't remember what they call it. They're

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:26.120
like, it's basically this big on the most bill. And as part of the non COVID part of that, they

01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:31.320
shoved a bunch of other stuff in there because it was getting fast tracked. And so it was like,

01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:39.000
you know, 50,000 pages or five, five, 5,000 pages. Cause you know, with two hours,

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:45.800
you know, a few hours to actually look at it and 5,000 pages, it's hard to even see all the stuff

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:53.960
that they're voting, you know, yes on. But one of that was the case act, which is apparently a new,

01:28:53.960 --> 01:29:00.520
um, bill that will propose establishing a new court-like entity within the U S copyright office

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:09.000
to resolve, uh, copyright disputes, which basically it's this, um, new group of, uh,

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:15.800
people that get to make, uh, copyright decisions, whether or not you are liable for a fines, uh,

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:23.640
up to $30,000. And then on top of that, if you are found, um, to be purposefully sharing

01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:31.480
copyright material online, you could be liable, uh, for felony as well. Um, now granted,

01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:36.920
this is not necessarily, I think, directed towards folks on Twitch and YouTube that are

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:43.480
accidentally putting copyright music in their, um, streams or something like that. This is more

01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:51.880
of the sense of like, you know, running a pirate server. That's basically hosting movies and stuff

01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:59.720
like that. It's more of the purposeful, you know, piracy that's out there. That's not to say that,

01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:09.320
you know, stuff will get twisted in a way that overreach, but because I mean, look at the RIA

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:14.120
and what they've done in the past for folks, um, illegally downloading MP3s and stuff,

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:19.560
which really hurts nobody, but they'll find them, you know, so much money on that. So it is

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:23.800
unfortunately something that's already been passed, but is it necessarily going to affect

01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:30.600
everyone? I guess we'll have to see what happens, but it's not, not a positive thing. Definitely.

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:36.760
It's siding with these corporations again, who really need no more protections. Yeah. I think

01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:43.160
that, I think you kind of hit it when you say the intent behind it is for these, you know, big,

01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:48.600
you know, the, the websites where it's like, you don't have HBO max. So you go to this website

01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:53.400
to watch the pirated version of Wonder Woman 84 or whatever. Uh, and, and, uh, you know, that's,

01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:57.160
that's, that's a no, no. Right. It's, you're not supposed to do that. That's, you know, piracy

01:30:57.160 --> 01:31:01.160
laws. They don't have a lot of ways to enforce that. Although I I'm curious, how does that work?

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:05.160
Because most of those websites are overseas, but I digress. I guess that's something they'll have

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:10.600
to figure out. Um, but I think we're worried about how might the language and how might some of that

01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:17.080
be used when the RIAA decides, Oh, we could make more money by shutting down Twitch, you know,

01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:21.800
or something like that. I think that's, that's the worries there. And to like, kind of like,

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:31.800
so right now they do have, there is like felonies or it's like for other types of piracy or other

01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:39.160
types of like, what this is basically doing is bringing the actual streaming part of it up to,

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:45.160
um, equal merits with the other types of piracy they're out there. So the penalties with those

01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:51.560
is what it's basically doing. Cause before I think it was, they couldn't, um, enforce a

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:55.720
heavier penalty on people, which I don't know if they necessarily need to do in the first place,

01:31:55.720 --> 01:32:05.320
but, um, yeah, so we'll see. I mean, it's just, it's basically, it says it's, it's illegal

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:11.400
streaming for commercial profit is what the bill is stipulating and says provide the public digital

01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:20.680
transmission service that is primarily focused on legal streams. Um, I don't know, but we'll see.

01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:27.240
I think it needs more revisions. I mean, that's not to say that they couldn't just do something

01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:32.120
to revise this as well, but we'll have to see when the next administration gets in.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:38.840
At least with politicians starting to get younger and younger, we're going to get more people in

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:43.720
there that get it. So to speak, I mean, obviously you have Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has done her

01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:47.960
own stream and she was joined by Ilhan Omar. So those are two representatives there, right?

01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:52.360
And then, you know, even if you're like, I don't like those extreme left or whatever,

01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:56.520
even on the right, we know Justin Amash was watching. Although I think he's done now. I

01:32:56.520 --> 01:33:00.120
don't think he sought another term, but still, you know, there are people that are on the right

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:05.560
or are watching what's happening. And, you know, I think I hate to say it, but maybe I don't. It's,

01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:10.680
it's kind of an age thing I get, I think. And I think as we get more younger people that have had

01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:15.000
Twitch be a part of their lives and so forth and have had YouTube and stuff, we'll finally start

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:20.440
to see laws that kind of answer that. But right now you got a lot of people in there that just

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:25.240
do what Hollywood wants them to do, even though it's in their best interest, but they don't give

01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:31.240
a rat's ass about Twitch, you know? So that's, I think what it comes down to. I just realized also,

01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:37.480
I opened Pandora's box by uttering the words Wonder Woman 84. Haven't seen the movie. Don't,

01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:41.080
I haven't even seen the first movie. You guys, I watched so little TV and movies.

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:48.440
Apparently they had some anachronisms because there were two video games, two arcade games

01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:51.240
that were in the arcade that didn't come out until like 86 and 87.

01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:57.640
But there are very big opinions. One way I'm seeing people love it. I'm seeing people hate it.

01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:02.840
I'm seeing people kind of like, it's just be respectful. Be respectful of everybody's

01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:07.000
opinions y'all. It's just, I'm here. It's all over the board. I'm seeing it all over the board.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.440
Whatever. I'm not a DC fan, so I'm not in a hurry to watch it anyway.

01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:15.000
Yeah. All right. Yeah. I still haven't forgiven him for Batman versus Superman.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.200
All right. That I did see and I wish I hadn't. Moving on.

01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:23.000
Of course they, of course they greenlit a third movie because you know, it made some money and

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:27.800
it's just unfortunately like for me, like I've gotten out of the whole DC stuff

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:33.880
because I don't know, like they're trying to pull like what the Marvel is cinematic.

01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:37.800
The Marvel Cinematic Universe seems to have more cohesion to it. And it's like, yes,

01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:43.960
it's just going movie to movie. There's like, it's more interesting. Whereas the DC stuff,

01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:48.600
it's just, it's misfire after misfire, which is unfortunate because I liked the DC characters,

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:52.520
but it's just, Oh my God, put the people in charge of the Marvel movies in charge of the

01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:57.720
DC movies. And then we'll see like a night and day difference, but it's just not there yet.

01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:02.280
How did it make? I mean, I, and this is not being being a hater. This is an honest question. How did

01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:05.640
it, how did they know already it made enough money? Was, is that just based off international

01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:10.840
box office and places where theaters are running? Um, or $4 million already.

01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:18.040
Wow. And that's without HBO max. I think so. Okay. And you know, HBO. Okay. Then

01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:22.440
nevermind question answered because, you know, HBO probably paid like 50 million or

01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:27.480
something like that to have it on their service. So it's Warner brothers service though. Warner

01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:33.080
brothers owns HBO. So that's why it's on HBO max. Got it. Got it. Well, still, still the money

01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:36.360
they're getting from monthly subscriptions and probably people that signed up and stuff is

01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:40.680
probably, probably not. Okay. That answers my question actually. Thank you. All right.

01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:44.440
Let's move on. Let's go back to classics. Cause apparently

01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:50.760
I, I don't understand how this newfangled box office works in the age of HBO max.

01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:54.760
Let's talk about classics and a new newer game. That's going classic. Although I don't think

01:35:54.760 --> 01:36:00.200
this surprises anyone. Uh, the game bloodstained ritual of the night has been adding a lot of,

01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:04.840
you know, side modes and extra modes in the game. Uh, for example, some free DLC included

01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:10.600
a randomizer mode, a boss revenge modes, um, allowing you to play as alternate protagonists.

01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:16.200
Well now, um, five Oh five games in our play have announced that there is a classic mode coming to

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:23.400
the game. And when you look at the screenshots of classic mode, it looks exactly like a classic game

01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:27.240
that bloodstained drew a lot of influence from a lot of influence, right? In fact,

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:31.240
because the same creative mind was behind them both. Yes. It looks like a fricking

01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:35.720
Castlevania game. And I don't mean 70 in the night. I mean the old like vampire Hunter

01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:41.560
turned into Castlevania and now thing, uh, it looks like one of those games, but it looks,

01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:47.640
it, it looks like it, but it still has, it's not like retro. Like the interface looks like it,

01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:51.400
but it's not like an eight bit game. All of a sudden that was that, that was that curse of the

01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:56.200
moon side franchise they were doing. No, this is like a classic mode that's built into the game.

01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:02.200
So it's more like 2d platforming action. So that's kind of neat. And again, it's something

01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:06.600
that is just coming to the game next month because of how well the Kickstarter did, uh,

01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:11.160
funded all these extra things. So that's pretty cool. Uh, another reason to visit bloodstained,

01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:16.040
uh, if you haven't visited that in a while, I know I bought it and then it showed up on game pass.

01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:20.760
I backed it actually. And they have a mobile version now too. Oh wow. And honestly,

01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:24.760
I still think that the PS4 version is the best of the home releases.

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:32.040
Yeah. Just played so smoothly from day one. The switch version had some kind of hiccups in it. Um,

01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:35.800
they've patched a lot of that out and ironed a lot of that out, but it was a little rough

01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:41.960
in the beginning there. So, uh, I don't know if it's J opium or Joe PM three, one, three

01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:44.040
said that they announced the sequel for bloodstained today.

01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:49.960
I thought they were already working on one. I thought they were too. Yeah. But they might've,

01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:53.960
they might've done an update or put out something on that. I'm not surprised. I think the game has

01:37:53.960 --> 01:38:00.440
been doing very well. So, um, I'm surprised that a five Oh five games didn't want to charge us again

01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:06.680
for, you know, that classic mode, you know, uh, I think the terms of the original Kickstarter

01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:11.320
didn't, I think it was if we make so much money, then essentially the community's already paid for

01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:17.080
it. I think that's what it works, how it works. So speaking of working, uh, I thought this was

01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:21.800
a neat story. Darsaka. I had no idea something like this was a thing until you, uh, shared it

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:28.040
with me earlier today. And I'll tell you how I came across it is actually, I love to watch,

01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:35.480
did you know, gaming one of my favorite channels and, uh, the fellow who runs it did, um, has a

01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:44.440
game history secrets thing that he does. Um, his, uh, his name is Liam Robertson. And so he did one

01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:51.080
about having tried to research this game boy peripheral, uh, called the work boy. And I don't

01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:55.960
know if you'd ever seen any, any of the pictures or people saying that it was like the Holy grail

01:38:55.960 --> 01:39:02.440
of like old game boy accessories. And, you know, people might remember that I did a year before

01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:08.840
last do, uh, the classic peripheral. And I tried to outline like different peripherals, um,

01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:15.560
including the sewing machine for the game boy. Um, so this one is called the work boy. Um,

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:24.840
it was rumored to have been released in very limited numbers in 1992. Um, it actually never

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:32.200
was released. It was developed by fab tech. Um, and, uh, it was actually fab tech and source

01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:38.040
research and development. So it was a two part item. You have a small little keyboard and a

01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:45.960
cartridge. So, um, and as a rom hack, uh, sorry, not rom hackers, but as people who were looking

01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:54.440
at the code from the big, uh, uh, the giga leak, they found, um, one of the working prototypes of

01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:59.960
the cartridge, but they couldn't get anything to do with it because it was reliant on the

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:06.600
keyboard to make it work. And the video is absolutely worth, worth watching. Um, but at any

01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:13.720
rate, um, Liam and doing research on this actually got in touch with, uh, Franz Balus, who was the

01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:21.960
founder of a fab tech who gave him his prototype, the copy he had of, of the thing, just sent it to

01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:28.920
him. And, um, so, but no one, none of the developers had the cartridge for it. And it

01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:34.120
was the giga leak that made this, uh, available. I mean, through this, there's like people who

01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:41.720
developed games who lost so much of their work that this giga leak returned their work to them

01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:48.200
pretty much. And this is one of the items is included. And so, sorry, that's very interesting

01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:52.920
because there's been a lot of talk about is the giga leak like an ethical thing to cover,

01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:57.080
you know, it's kind of like one tough question we've been faced with as, you know, people that

01:40:57.080 --> 01:41:01.480
are producing gaming media type of thing. Yeah, it is news. And I think that's kind of ultimately

01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:05.720
where it falls is like, you're going to talk about it, whether we do or not. So, you know,

01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:10.920
and we can just say the leaks aren't cool. It's not cool. It happened, but it is interesting,

01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:14.520
Jamie, that now you've kind of got this interesting side to it where it's like,

01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:19.320
well, here's a case where this leak kind of allowed people that thought it was gone,

01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:23.640
people who worked on it, who thought it was gone forever to kind of be reunited with it.

01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:30.040
So it's an interesting, not, not, not that we're saying it's okay, but it is an interesting

01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:34.760
silver lining to the situation. Well, and so if people work on this project and they

01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:39.800
haven't had any way to save any of their assets or any of the work, because technically it's

01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:45.720
owned by the studio that they did it for, you know, for a lot of these people, it was sort of

01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:51.560
like, I guess like a little bit of gold for them, you know, just something that's come back up,

01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:58.600
like finding an heirloom or something. But at any rate, the thing is that this is actually

01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:07.320
pretty cool. This basically does what a lot of stuff that we can do on say our iPhones today,

01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:15.880
but this was created before even PDAs were a big thing. The, the portable digital assistants,

01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:25.320
like Palm, Palm pilot. Yeah. So at any rate, what this does is it has, and it was actually

01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:34.120
pretty cool little thing. It has like a calendar, it has a built-in clock and the clock is reliant

01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:38.120
on the cartridge, you know, so the two things work together because, you know, the Game Boy

01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:47.080
didn't have a built-in clock. It also had like a country locator and it's like, I think it was

01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:59.480
like 16 of the countries would play like the first few stanzas of their anthem. It also had a, like

01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:04.280
a loose translator in there, like for like useful phrases. And I want to say

01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:12.520
eight or 10 different languages, you know, just like useful things like for someone working.

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:19.160
It also had, now it didn't have a number pad on there, but you could use your top line of letters

01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:26.120
that corresponded to a number to add in, to use the calculator, to use the, the phone book. It

01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:34.040
had a phone book built into it, you know, like a little portable Rolodex. And it was actually

01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:41.160
really cool. It had a word processor built into it, you know, it was supposed to have a printer

01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:46.280
capability, but there wasn't a port on, I guess, the prototype for the keyboard yet.

01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:50.120
And the Game Boy printer itself must not have been a thing yet.

01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:56.040
I'd have to check the timeframe, but yeah, this was 1992. But at any rate,

01:43:56.040 --> 01:44:02.920
this thing was supposed to retail for about 90 bucks. What they were saying in the video is that

01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:11.480
the, what initially put the halt on it was the fact that the Game Boy was going to be dropping

01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:17.480
its price. Like they had a price point on this that was set to match the Game Boys price point.

01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:25.800
So you would pay roughly 180, 200 bucks and get this, you know, portable word processor system,

01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:33.800
something that was well ahead of its time. Excuse me. And he just put the hold on it.

01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:38.680
And the thing is, is that there were people after this who were like, we would have paid for this

01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:42.600
thing, no matter what the price difference between this and the Game Boy was, you know,

01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:47.960
and they're like, well, kind of wish we did it. And they actually did remarket it later on.

01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:54.840
They had it in mind to do one for the Game Boy Advance that of course didn't even make it to

01:44:54.840 --> 01:45:05.640
prototype. It was just, you know, drawings. And it actually was, the idea was purchased by Nokia

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:12.520
for one of their PDAs.

01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:14.520
And it became the N-Gage. Just kidding.

01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:21.720
I would have to dig deeper into that, but maybe not. The taco was not the best thing ever to

01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:31.960
happen. And Nintendo hired one of the people who worked on that project as a design consultant

01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:35.720
for the Game Boy Advance. And that's kind of what was leading to the WorkBoy 2,

01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:39.160
the Game Boy Advance one that never saw the light of day.

01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:45.160
So yeah, as of 2.100, Matt says we're getting Classic Game and Classic Peripheral.

01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:55.640
Unreleased Peripheral. Then again, you know, I have done an unreleased game as Classic Game.

01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:59.640
I did Space Fantasy Zone. Maybe there's a 2020 theme in there,

01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:05.320
Classic Unreleased thing or something. I don't want to do that much research.

01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:09.960
Maybe I'll do Classic Controller.

01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:12.520
This is still neat because, you know, yeah,

01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:16.280
it was kind of enhancing the Game Boy to do things that weren't just games.

01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:24.440
Now, there's also a budget thing on here too, which I mean, it's just so, so interesting.

01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:29.480
Now, what is interesting, Rama shared this link in chat of something he remembered,

01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:35.080
and it was like a Game Boy. It was from Infogenius Productivity Pack from Game Tech,

01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:39.480
a personal organizer and phone book. So and it actually had a clock in it and things like that.

01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:43.880
And it looks like there's some other things there. So like a travel guide, a spell checker.

01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:51.800
So this wasn't the only thing to really think of. How can we, you know, make the Game Boy more than

01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:55.240
just games when people are taking this in their pockets? Again, you have to remember,

01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:59.960
early 90s, before cell phones, before, you know, all that stuff.

01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:02.360
Before smartphones.

01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:05.960
Yeah. How do we put that all in our pocket where we go? And so it's interesting.

01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:08.600
Some people took this approach of putting them in game packs,

01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:13.560
although the Work Boy was more going to be not just a game, a game, a program,

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:17.800
but a peripheral with the word processing and all that stuff. It's kind of neat.

01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:28.040
Exactly so. And honestly, absolutely watch the video. I will copy the link and paste it in chat

01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:34.840
because it is absolutely, absolutely worth the watch. I think it was a wonderful video. It went

01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:39.640
into a lot more detail than I did. Of course, don't watch it during the show. Wait till we're

01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:47.320
done. But it's so great. It is just really cool to see the thing in motion. I thought it was really

01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:51.800
something special. And the fact that the dude just gave it to this guy.

01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:52.840
Yeah.

01:47:52.840 --> 01:48:00.760
Yeah. I mean, he's like, I think, like, if I remember the conversation when you won it. Yes.

01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:02.520
Here you go.

01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:09.640
He sent it. And the fact that this ties into the Giga leak as well is just sort of like news upon

01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:17.800
news in history. So, of course, now I would imagine that it would have needed like some

01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:25.320
sort of like holder or rig in there, which they actually had a rig designed for the Work Boy 2

01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:30.840
that would have been with Game Boy Advance. Like it had a clamshell. Because certainly doing the

01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:35.160
word processing on such a tiny thing that could flop over if you were, say, like trying to work

01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:40.520
on a plane or something, you know, that wouldn't be easy.

01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:47.000
All right. Well, you got to do back to back duty tonight because it's time to get to our

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:48.760
classic game of the week. We've just talked about.

01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:50.360
Which has nothing to do with the Game Boy.

01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:54.680
Yeah. It's just a completely different pick. That's okay. It's time for the last classic

01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:59.720
game of 2020. So every week, Dark Sakura jumps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she

01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:09.480
thinks, hey, you brats, get off my lawn. Enough of your PlayStation fives and Xbox X's. You got

01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:14.920
to get a console that didn't even come out in the United States for this one. Sort of, sort of,

01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:17.800
but you'll get into it. Dark Sakura. And this is one of those.

01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:20.520
It did eventually make its way over here in one way or another.

01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:25.160
You've talked about this series before, but not this particular game. And I think this is

01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:32.520
a fascinating one. I'm going to take a halo approach to the sequel by the way that the U.S.

01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:40.920
got, but in Japan, um, Metal Gear got a remake, uh, not a remake, a sequel called Metal Gear 2

01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:49.480
Solid Snake. And this is the actual sequel to Metal Gear, not Snake's Revenge. Um, and the

01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:54.760
good thing for the viewers, we are watching a later port of the game that is in English that

01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:58.360
Jamie will get into later. Just so they understand why they're saying English.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:05.960
And the cool thing about this is that you start seeing a lot of the groundwork for like Metal

01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:10.200
Gear Solid, like we got on PlayStation. It really seems to have quite a bit more,

01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:19.880
you see that evolution into this. So, um, at any rate, um, it was released by Konami for the

01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:28.120
MSX 2 computer in 1990. And it is, like I said, a direct sequel to the MSX 2 version of Metal Gear,

01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:36.680
both written and designed by Hideo Kojima. Um, and he actually did the sequel as a response

01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:43.400
to Snake's Revenge because it was bad and he didn't like it. So he made the real thing.

01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:52.280
Um, so, um, with this one, of course, it only came out in Japan. Um, and it was immediately

01:50:52.280 --> 01:51:02.680
followed up by Metal Gear Solid. Um, this one is, uh, it was interesting. And by the way,

01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:07.800
it did get the rereleases of this. It was released as content in the subsist,

01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:16.280
the subsistence version of Metal Gear Solid 3 for PlayStation 2 in 2005, and included in the HD

01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:22.920
Metal Gear Solid 3 for PS3, Xbox 360, and PlayStation Vita, and then a standalone re-release

01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:32.040
in Japan for mobile phones and the Wii virtual console. Um, but at any rate, it was set in 1999,

01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:39.640
a few years after the original game where Snake has to go into this territory known as Zanzibar

01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:45.960
land to kidnap a scientist and to destroy a new Metal Gear called Metal Gear D. Um,

01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:56.360
it's got a lot more of the stealth, uh, aspect to it. Um, really just, uh, over the top actually,

01:51:56.360 --> 01:52:02.760
because it really evolved that system and it deals with a lot more in terms of the storyline.

01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:09.640
It's really gathered some complexity going over like the nature of what war is and, uh,

01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:15.480
nuclear proliferation. Um, it's on record as one of the best 8-bit games ever made.

01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:22.200
And so with this one, um, it, like I said, it builds on that stealth based gameplay. Um,

01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:26.680
your objective is to infiltrate the enemy stronghold while avoiding detection from

01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:33.640
soldiers, cameras, infrared sensors, and other surveillance devices. Um, and so, uh, one of the

01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:40.520
big changes actually not in, I guess, Snake as much, but as in what the enemies can do.

01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:48.520
So instead of having like this one stationed guard, they now patrol multiple screens on a

01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:53.720
single map and they have expanded vision to 45 degrees. They can turn their heads.

01:52:54.440 --> 01:53:01.480
Um, they can detect sounds. Um, like if you punch a wall or shoot a gun, uh, without a suppressor,

01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:06.520
they'll hear it. Um, and then they'll come investigate. Um, they can hear you walking on

01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:13.880
certain surfaces. And if you're discovered, then you have a counter that goes down until they've

01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:20.600
lost track of you. So then when it reaches zero, then it goes back to normal sound a lot like

01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:26.120
Metal Gear Solid right there, just saying you do have, um, new maneuvers, new tools.

01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:34.280
So you can duck under desks inside air ducts. You have a three by three radar grid so that you can

01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:39.880
see where your position is versus the enemies. Um, of course the radar is disabled in the alert

01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:47.160
phase. Again, we saw this in Metal Gear Solid. Um, you can, uh, increase your health and carrying

01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:53.320
capacity every time you beat a boss. Um, you have robot robotic mice to distract enemies with,

01:53:53.320 --> 01:54:00.840
you have camo, different kinds of rations. Um, the transceiver for your conversations are now,

01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:05.720
uh, they're pro the, this program to be a lot more context sensitive instead of just based on

01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:13.320
where you are and you can see the faces of people that you're talking to. Um, and so, um, you know,

01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:19.960
you get different, uh, codes, different, uh, frequency numbers. You can lure a carrier pigeon

01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:25.000
with certain rations. You got all kinds of different stuff. You can chase a lady spy into

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:32.760
the ladies room. Didn't we see this with Meryl? Um, kind of, um, that again, Metal Gear Solid.

01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:39.800
Um, but the MSX2 version requires, um, either a floppy disk drive or the Game Master 2 utility

01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:45.640
cartridge to save your progress. Um, and in absence of that, the password, you, you have a

01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:52.040
password. Later versions of the game did remove the password favor, uh, the password feature in

01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:59.960
favor of using standardized media, such as memory cards or internal hard disks. So, um, your main

01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:10.440
character, you have a solid snake. Um, you have Roy Campbell. Um, you've got, uh, his, uh,

01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:16.200
commanding officer, McDonald Miller, who I think didn't he become master Miller in the later ones.

01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:24.120
You have, uh, George Kessler. You have Joseph Norden who was renamed to Johan Jacobson in the

01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:31.480
later ones. You have Holly White as a CIA agent posting as a journalist. You've got, uh, all kinds

01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:38.600
of just other characters. Um, uh, just, and some of them we've seen come back. You also have Big Boss

01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:48.280
and Gray Fox, as we saw in, uh, in, uh, Metal Gear, Metal Gear Solid. Um, you've got bosses,

01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:56.120
you have, um, like one called Running Man, Red Blaster, Black Color, who's renamed to Black Ninja.

01:55:56.840 --> 01:56:05.560
Um, Predator, uh, who was also renamed Jungle Evil for some reason. And, you know, so basically

01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:10.440
that's sort of starting the hokey name, uh, thing that went on in later Metal Gear games.

01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:17.720
Um, so, um, I'm not gonna get too much into the story cause I'd say you should go out and play the

01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:23.320
game. Um, there's also translated original MSX versions out there to play, but it was very,

01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:30.520
very successful. Um, uh, Kojima of course was not involved in either of the NES versions

01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:37.960
and he didn't have a plan to do the sequel until he saw that one of his coworkers was assigned to

01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:45.960
work on Snake's Revenge. Um, and he of course wasn't happy about it. And so the, the coworker

01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:51.880
actually encouraged Kojima to do his own. And so, um, Jamie, I just have to say a comparison

01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:57.320
between you and Hideo Kojima and probably why you like him so much is that this game was motivated

01:56:57.320 --> 01:57:06.520
by spite, much like, uh, you, everything that I do. I'm absolutely motivated by spite. I mean,

01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:11.480
that's, that's really what it is. Metal Gear Solid 2, or excuse me, I'm sorry. Metal Gear 2

01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:18.120
is Solid Snake is one of those games that exists out of spite. Maybe, maybe Mega Man 2 being the

01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:21.640
only other I can think of at the top of my head where they, they weren't going to do it until the

01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:30.520
workers just kind of did it on their off time. Well, and, and basically, um, after some business

01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:38.680
trips, Kojima got the execs to approve of it for the MSX. So, um, as I said earlier, the MSX 2

01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:46.920
version of, uh, Metal Gear 2 was released in Japan on July 20th, 1990. Um, no English version

01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:53.960
was produced, um, since Konami, uh, actually discontinued sales of the MSX in Europe because,

01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:59.480
you know, the U S never got the MSX. It was, they did in Europe. There was a fan translation

01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:08.840
done in 1987 by the MSX hobbyist group, G and T international. Um, the first port came on a

01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:16.520
Japanese phone. Um, basically a feature phone was what they're called that had like the, the,

01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:24.840
the like video windows and stuff like that, um, came out October 1st, 2004, uh, for download on

01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:31.000
i-mode easy web and Yahoo mobile services. The guy playing this isn't very good at stealth,

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:38.040
just saying, well, the video is going to loop in a minute here anyway. Sorry. Yeah. I only

01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:44.120
am able to pull about 10 minutes before it loops. But at any rate, um, uh, it included,

01:58:44.120 --> 01:58:50.440
um, an easy mode, a boss rush, uh, that was unlockable after you beat the game. Um,

01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:57.160
and then the portraits in the MSX two version were modeled after like some real celebrities,

01:58:57.160 --> 01:59:03.880
but then they, uh, were redesigned to look like the original character designs in the later

01:59:03.880 --> 01:59:12.040
installations or installments. Um, and these changes also carried over into metal gear,

01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:17.640
solid three subsistence, that version that came in and metal gear solid three snake eater snake

01:59:17.720 --> 01:59:24.680
eater. Anyway, I can't think of snake eater without that song gonna play in my head. Um,

01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:29.640
it did get her a release on the Wii virtual console exclusively in Japan on March 30th,

01:59:29.640 --> 01:59:36.520
2010. Um, and it was of course, emulated off of the MSX two hardware rather than being a port.

01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:46.280
Um, so, uh, the music was done by the Konami, uh, uh, uh, I always mispronounce it Kukeha club.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:55.880
Um, same people that worked on nemesis two and snatcher. Um, and you can actually hear some of

01:59:55.880 --> 02:00:01.480
the arranged music from that in the VR training disc for metal gear, solid integral, or as we

02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:09.000
got it, metal gear, solid VR missions. So, uh, the theme of solid snake was, uh, from that game

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:19.080
was heard in super smash brothers ball. So it was ranked at number one in MSX magazines, top 30 best

02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:28.280
selling MSX games. Uh, it was, I mean, pretty much given some amazing reviews, just even in the,

02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:34.120
the later iterations that we got with, uh, the releases with the later metal gear games,

02:00:34.120 --> 02:00:41.560
the remastered ones. So, and I mean, I didn't play it myself. I watched Dan play through it

02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:47.320
cause he had, um, an emulator for it and he was really getting into it. I think this game is,

02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:55.800
is pretty fantastic. Um, it, it laid this one, I think like while the first model gear might've been

02:00:56.440 --> 02:01:03.080
the foundation for all of the later games, this one really laid out the groundwork.

02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:10.120
This one was the cornerstone, the, the, the, the studs, the, the anchors.

02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:16.600
Well, it's just such a unique release to where, you know, we literally had two different sequels,

02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:21.160
uh, in the U S versus Japan, which doesn't happen all the time. I mean, super Mario

02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:26.360
brothers comes to mind, but it's not, uh, it's not something you, you really have a lot of in,

02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:31.880
in the history of gaming. Um, and, and just the fact that not only like, and, and even with Mario,

02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:35.480
like at least those games were still both Nintendo games, but these are like

02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:40.680
really radically different because metal gear, uh, two was for the longest time,

02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:46.600
only an M I'm sorry, not, not the, not the no snakes revenge is what I call the U S revenge,

02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:51.160
but, uh, metal gear two was a MSX thing, which we didn't even have here in the States.

02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:54.440
And then of course, snakes revenge was an NES game. And yeah, I play, I remember playing a

02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:58.920
little bit of it and it wasn't it, you could tell it was designed by different people. It

02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:03.960
was a different kind of game. Um, but then memories of playing it, but yeah,

02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:11.000
it's not the best game. It's also weird because many of us in the U S our foundation of metal

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:17.000
gear is that original, uh, admittedly subpar version of the game, but we didn't know that,

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:23.560
you know, we didn't know that the last boss exactly. And so it is interesting how, you know,

02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:27.560
here in the U S you know, we just, I think we all just kind of collectively wrote off snakes

02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:31.800
revenge and then, Oh, metal gear solid shows up. And that's really, you know,

02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:35.560
either the first experience in the franchise for a lot of people, whatever, but, but you bring up

02:02:35.560 --> 02:02:42.200
a great point that it's like, but the, the real bridge between metal gear and metal gear solid

02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:48.280
is this. And unless you are a hardcore metal gear collector or whatever, you probably have

02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:53.160
never played it or maybe even heard of it before because of its unique Japanese release. Sorry.

02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:57.960
On top of that, you know, like what I think a lot of people didn't realize when they were

02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:01.640
playing metal gear solid is that when gray Fox shows up and snake knows him

02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:06.120
and everyone's like, who the hell is gray Fox and why does snake know him?

02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:12.200
Yeah. Good point. Yeah. And I really liked that Kojima was like, I reject.

02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:16.360
Wasn't I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Jamie. Wasn't gray Fox in the original metal gear. I know big boss

02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:21.880
was I thought gray. Yeah, I guess, but I think, but he had more of a role to play.

02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:28.440
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's been a lot. I loved the metal gear when I was a kid and I had,

02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:33.480
but I never super got into the solid series. Honestly, they just became too, too stealthy

02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:38.040
for me. Sorry. Well, what I was saying though, with that is this like Kojima said, I reject

02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:47.960
your reality and replace it with my own. And I think that getting those, uh, the subsistence

02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:54.920
and metal gear solid three is the first exposure that people who did not actively look for it here

02:03:54.920 --> 02:04:04.840
in the U S got to, to this game. And I'm really glad that they, uh, they, uh, uh, localized it,

02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:09.400
uh, for, for what we got over here, because it's a fantastic game. I really enjoyed the story.

02:04:09.400 --> 02:04:13.880
Yeah. Um, it's been years since I've done any play of it, but I was just like thinking

02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:19.240
what is something that would be good to end the year on?

02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:23.560
Yeah. And what, you know, I really wish Kami would kind of get their shit together, so to speak and,

02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:29.640
and maybe put, put these, uh, redone versions out again, you know, outside of the, the metal gears,

02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:34.840
you know, where it was just showed up in as bonus content, why not do some rerelease standalone

02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:39.080
content of, uh, on the Nintendo switch or something of the MSX games? I'd be so into that.

02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:44.840
I'd love that. So, oh, we'll see. But, um, with this particular segment over,

02:04:44.840 --> 02:04:52.520
I want to position a question to both of you guys that, um, Dan asked me, and he asked me what semi

02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:59.240
obscure video or video game system or anything that plays video games would I want? So before

02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:03.720
I give you my answer, I want to know what your YouTube would choose. Wait, I don't know who you

02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:10.280
dark soccer would want or who I would know what, what I want. I'm asking you what, what's semi

02:05:10.280 --> 02:05:18.600
obscure or somewhat obscure system that you would want. Um, damn. That's a really good question. Um,

02:05:22.040 --> 02:05:27.320
I know you put me on the spot here. Um, I can do that. Maybe. Yeah, you can. Um,

02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:33.160
I was going to say maybe like, uh, of course my brain is going to like retro stuff

02:05:33.160 --> 02:05:37.000
and I'm kind of torn between like either like an old ass, like Apple to eat. Cause I never had

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:41.800
one of those when I was a kid. Um, and there's a lot of fun stuff to rediscover on that. Or maybe,

02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:46.760
um, straight up a Coleco. I know that's your, your bread and butter, but I never had a Coleco

02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:51.880
and never really got to play with that. Okay. Maybe I have two of them. Do you really?

02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:59.400
Yeah, it's in my garage. No, no, I have to Dan bought one from one of my coworkers and then I

02:05:59.400 --> 02:06:03.960
came back from Alabama with one, although I don't get me wrong. MSX would be bad-ass,

02:06:03.960 --> 02:06:08.520
but the reality is all the games are in Japanese. I, you know, I'm not going to count the Saturn

02:06:08.520 --> 02:06:13.800
as obscure by the way that power I'm talking about things like an FM towns or something like that.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:18.040
I thought of another one, the Panasonic queue, the one that played GameCube games.

02:06:18.680 --> 02:06:26.360
That was kind of rad. Okay. All right. Uh, I don't really have any consoles that I would want. I

02:06:26.360 --> 02:06:32.600
would think, um, well, I'm also counting gaming computers that were standalone systems like

02:06:32.600 --> 02:06:39.560
computers too. So something like the FM towns or something like that. No, I don't really have any

02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:49.160
thing that I would want. Um, yeah, I can't think of anything. I told Dan mine would be the sharp

02:06:49.240 --> 02:07:01.240
X 68,000 or if I can find a duo LT and a PC engine duo LT, wait, why I say duo, it's just a PC engine

02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:08.520
LT. Um, which you remember Chris saying, yeah, I think he has a couple of them. He lost one in a

02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:14.120
movie theater. True story. He's I don't know if he wants me to tell that, but I just did. Um,

02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:18.360
some interesting comments in chat, uh, Bobby saying not obscure, but I want a CDI so I can

02:07:18.360 --> 02:07:25.800
find the Zelda games. Uh, or it has a 3d. Oh, um, Questmaster says not a console to have out an

02:07:25.800 --> 02:07:33.080
arcade cab, like the R three 60. Yeah. Well, the CDI games were, uh, unofficially remastered a few

02:07:33.080 --> 02:07:38.920
weeks ago and they are on the internet if you were looking to play for those on PC. Yeah. So

02:07:38.920 --> 02:07:43.800
that's something, well, we know what Dan's answer was. Oh, what's that? Dan wants the

02:07:43.800 --> 02:07:49.640
Capcom CPS changer, which you can only play like eight games on it. I mean, but they're the arcade

02:07:49.640 --> 02:07:55.880
games. If we can throw arcades into it, then I want a Nintendo pay choice 10, but now the

02:07:55.880 --> 02:08:03.800
changer itself is meant to play the arcade games on a home TV, which is basically just like, I

02:08:03.800 --> 02:08:11.640
think a super gun and yeah. Um, but yeah, Dan said the CPS changer and me, I, I would want the, the

02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:21.240
shark. Okay. All right. Bobby, you send me $4,000. I'll send you a doctor who pinball on my honor,

02:08:22.280 --> 02:08:27.560
including the shipping. All right. Uh, there it is your classic game of the week,

02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:34.680
metal gear two, not to be confused with snakes revenge, the not great sequel we got in the U S

02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:40.440
but the actual MSX sequel done by Hideo Kojima to the original metal gear game. Um, good pick

02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:44.520
dark soccer. I would, I actually thought we'd done it before, but I think we just talked about

02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:47.560
it when we were talking about like the first game or something like that. So, uh, cause I,

02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:52.600
I knew this little bit about gaming history and I, I didn't know for a lot. We were doing this

02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:55.880
show and I learned about it. I was like, what there's, there's a different metal gear two game.

02:08:55.880 --> 02:09:01.320
What I kind of learned that through this show. So, um, yeah, kind of cool. It's a neat little gaming

02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:09.000
story. All right. Uh, let's get into some rapid fire news. We're going to travel around the globe

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:13.240
and, uh, quickly, uh, cover some other things. Actually. I don't think we have as much with the

02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:19.640
holiday week, but we'll get into it. Well, anyways, um, so we have some more games with

02:09:19.640 --> 02:09:26.920
gold for January. So now, uh, it looks like little nightmares, uh, dead rising, the king of fighters

02:09:26.920 --> 02:09:34.120
13 and breakdown will be your games of gold, uh, for January. So that's pretty cool. And then

02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:42.840
another Microsoft titles also getting an update. So the, uh, VR update for Microsoft flight simulator

02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:50.920
is now a thing. Um, it is going to be, of course, I mean, it makes sense. Uh, just the actual like,

02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:56.680
uh, head tracking is basically supported. They don't actually support any of the controllers,

02:09:56.680 --> 02:10:01.240
which makes sense because you're flying a plane. I can't imagine that they'd be able to simplify it

02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:07.000
that, um, that much, but I guess it's got to come to consoles at some point. So they're going to

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:13.000
have to simplify it a little bit, but it is not something that they are supporting right now,

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:19.080
but it does support any open XR compliant headsets. So your Oculus five valve index,

02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:25.320
windows mixed reality headsets are supported. So pretty cool. Wonder how big that download is.

02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:31.720
Um, but yeah, it's going to be big. I have to try that. All right. I just don't want to download the

02:10:31.720 --> 02:10:37.560
whole game. Well, uh, speaking of VR, another, uh, game that's getting VR is Tetris effect

02:10:37.560 --> 02:10:42.360
connected. And you might be thinking, well, wasn't Tetris effect already in DVR. Yes. The PlayStation

02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:47.800
version was in VR, but this is Tetris effect connected. This is the kind of sequel kind of,

02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:52.520
it's more like Tetris effect plus I would call it. Uh, and, uh, that wasn't on PlayStation and

02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:58.840
still isn't, uh, it is actually still exclusive to Xbox and windows 10, but through the Microsoft

02:10:58.840 --> 02:11:04.120
windows 10 store, not through Epic games, which is where I bought it. That's the only game I've

02:11:04.120 --> 02:11:08.600
bought on the Epic store is Tetris effect. And it is not upgraded to connected still

02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:12.680
that will be coming out this summer. So it sounds like Microsoft probably threw some

02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:17.880
coin to have connected be an exclusive for a little bit. But anyway, if you have it on the

02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:24.360
Xbox or windows 10 store, obviously the series X and those that they don't support VR headsets,

02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:30.280
but if you have it on a PC through the Microsoft storefronts, you will get, um, you know, of course,

02:11:30.280 --> 02:11:36.600
4k 60 frame per second output and all this, but in the connected stuff will add, uh, with the 1.10

02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:43.000
patch official support for Vive and Oculus rift headsets. Although the notes for the patch do

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:47.800
indicate it should work with other like steam VR, if it runs that it'll work on the headset.

02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:52.920
So it's should be pretty, uh, pretty open-ended there. And I'm sure, I'm sure if it doesn't

02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:58.200
officially get supported hackers will make it work wink. So, um, there you go. Tetris effect

02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:03.560
connected now in VR, which is a great VR game, by the way, at least the original is so one of the

02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:08.280
few things I've played a lot, a lot, a lot of on the PlayStation 4 VR, uh, dark soccer. How about

02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:19.880
you? Um, how about some home star runner news, but it's 20, 20, 20 X D six anyway. Um, so since

02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:30.120
flash is being officially discontinued, um, on, uh, December 31st, um, they, uh, have, uh, finally

02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:39.720
put out level 10 of a stinko man 20 X D six. So, um, it's, uh, it's basically a flash game.

02:12:39.720 --> 02:12:47.240
It's got multiple levels sort of anime style. Um, and yeah, level, level 10 is out. Um, you can

02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:55.640
play it before it goes away. Um, I might have to, uh, get myself my, uh, flash downloader and just

02:12:55.640 --> 02:13:03.080
save the whole game so I can play it forever. But yeah, some, uh, home star runner stuff.

02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:08.600
Say you got about five days to squeeze it in there before flash has gone forever.

02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:16.280
So, right. Yeah. That's been a whole to do going on with my, uh, day life because flash is how a

02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:19.720
lot of e-learning was built back in the day. And so we have to kind of like convert it all

02:13:19.720 --> 02:13:24.440
to not be flashing. I learned flash in college. Yeah. I learned a little bit of it there too. So

02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:30.840
yeah, I took two whole semesters or not, not semesters, but yeah, semester is learning flash.

02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:36.280
Yeah. And I sucked at it, but the fun thing now is that all that time I spent in learning out flash

02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:43.720
made it really easy for me to learn a motion and DJ Rama S and chat says new grounds created an

02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:49.240
alternative flash player for its website. Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure there will still be ways. Um,

02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:55.400
but for the most part, probably just update this for HTML five. Yeah. Yeah. So by the way, did,

02:13:55.400 --> 02:14:00.440
did what Alan, uh, bring me show up on cam because he went to the store and sometimes they'll bring

02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:06.520
me a little treat. So he brought me, he brought me red vines, but they're not because you know,

02:14:06.520 --> 02:14:11.000
Jamie, I don't think you'll like this. I'm not really into red vines, but it's the black

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:17.480
licorice red vines. Yum. Cause I'm, I am that freak who loves black licorice. I thought you

02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:24.440
like Jaeger too. I do love Jaeger actually. Cause you know what it tastes like? Terrible.

02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:33.000
Malort on the other hand. I'm kidding. All right. So I have to ask, have you ever had a Uzo?

02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:40.920
I don't think so. No, it is an Annie's flavored, uh, uh, liqueur from Greece. Huh?

02:14:41.800 --> 02:14:50.920
So if, if you come over, I might invest in a very small bottle of Uzo to see if you can stand it.

02:14:50.920 --> 02:14:56.200
All right. I hate it. All right. All right. I think that's it for rapid fighting. Absinthe

02:14:56.200 --> 02:15:02.040
is also nasty and I've had the real thing. So I feel like I've had it, but it was the,

02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:07.560
the marketed thing. Like it wasn't the real thing. Like it was the, you know, when after everybody

02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:13.160
saw Moulin Rouge, uh, somebody made a mainstream version of it. So I don't think I've had the real

02:15:13.160 --> 02:15:21.320
thing. All right. When I had it, it was actually on a Creek Indian reservation. Ooh, fun. And so

02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:26.600
it was the real thing. Cause the laws are different. You could bring it in there. Yeah. Um,

02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:34.600
and it was absolutely terrible. It spirits of wormwood it, and it kind of handed me my ass

02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:39.240
cause I had a bunch of it cause I don't even know what the fuck we were doing,

02:15:39.240 --> 02:15:45.400
but absent this terrible pod culture says I had a dragon con and I, I, that's what I kind of thought,

02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:51.240
but I didn't want to commit myself to that, but thank you for that. And I remember, am I wrong?

02:15:51.240 --> 02:15:56.280
It was, it was kind of the, it was the, the, you could buy it at a store stuff, which,

02:15:56.280 --> 02:15:58.680
you know, the stuff Jamie's talking about, you can't really buy it.

02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:03.640
But by, by the way, um, to, to tell Ronma who

02:16:03.640 --> 02:16:08.200
said, uh, Mako Chan would love to have some of the real, the real deal. I was, um,

02:16:10.040 --> 02:16:14.920
18 when I had absence. It's been a little while, but not that long.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:25.320
It's been a while. All right. Let's move on and travel around the world and check out some

02:16:25.320 --> 02:16:29.320
release dates. Although I have a feeling it's going to be a quiet week, but let's check in

02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:34.520
anyway. Got nothing for you. I'm sure there's some digital games coming out, but nothing's

02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:38.920
on the slate. Yeah. We're done for the year at this point. We're pretty much done for the year.

02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:43.000
Um, mine are still loading. Do we want to go to Jamie's UK dates? Do you have those?

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:50.360
They ain't jack shit. Yeah. Uh, okay. There we do have some, some, some things in, uh, Japan,

02:16:50.360 --> 02:16:56.120
just a few Digimon survive is out on the Nintendo switch this week in Japan. So you have that.

02:16:56.120 --> 02:17:02.920
Uh, and I think that's it. I'm leading the PS4 real quick. Did you Mon survive is there too?

02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:08.840
Ninja judge tomorrow collection and shovel Knight gets a retail release in Japan. So that's what you

02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:14.040
have to look forward to this week. Okay. We have a few more stories for you guys, and then we will

02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:22.840
wrap it up. Uh, Loki. All right. So, um, I guess despite all of the bugs and everything, um, with

02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:31.480
the PlayStation four and, um, X-Box one versions of cyberpunk 2077, it is still selling, uh, like

02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:39.480
crazy. They hit 13 million in sales. Um, even with the refunds factored into that as well. So

02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:44.200
it's doing pretty well. I mean, I guess the game is highly anticipated, so that probably

02:17:44.200 --> 02:17:51.080
counts for a lot of it, but it is good to see that it's doing well, just wish it was released

02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:58.120
in the better, uh, state. But as Jamie had mentioned earlier, there was a new patch that was,

02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:05.560
um, released this week. And with that, it fixed one of the bugs that was wiping save files.

02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:11.240
Apparently if your save file hit a certain limit, so eight megabytes, and that could be from just

02:18:11.240 --> 02:18:19.240
having a large amount of crafting items in your inventory. Um, apparently it was causing corruption

02:18:19.240 --> 02:18:26.600
and it would actually, um, erase your progress, but the new apparently 1.06 hot fix claims that

02:18:26.600 --> 02:18:32.200
it will prevent that, uh, from rising, but it won't fix any of your saves that you had that

02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:38.120
were already affected by this bug. So yeah. And then on top of that, it also improves memory

02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:46.520
management and stability, which should result in fear crashes, but we'll have to see. And it's only

02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:54.200
15 gigabytes. So yay. Is that all? Is that that's it? Yeah. I actually think part of the reason I

02:18:54.200 --> 02:18:58.200
decided to jump in and try to tell me why this week is because I was looking at like, how much

02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:04.440
bandwidth have we used? Oh, we're only up to 600 gigs. Okay. We got a ways to go. I have some room.

02:19:04.440 --> 02:19:08.920
So I downloaded some games. It's sad that I have to like manage things on that level now, you know,

02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:20.200
but anyway, he's out of office in like less than a month. Can't wait. Um, and, uh, yeah. So cyberpunk

02:19:20.200 --> 02:19:23.000
it's still selling pretty well. Now, of course, we don't know how many of those were bought and

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:29.400
placed under a Christmas tree or equivalent sort of thing for the holidays. Um, but we can assume

02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:34.760
that maybe not as many as the internet wants us to think are like, you know, returns in waiting,

02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:39.640
so to speak. I think, and I think too, this is probably one of those cases where the internet

02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:43.960
is making a lot more noise than the actual reality of people that are going to the trouble

02:19:43.960 --> 02:19:49.400
to return the game, or maybe even can realize that they can do it. You know, I think there's probably

02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:55.240
a lot of people who are getting it for Christmas, et cetera, who don't even realizing refunded if

02:19:55.240 --> 02:20:00.760
they wanted to. Yeah. Or just, there's a lot of people that realize that. Yeah, that sucks that

02:20:00.760 --> 02:20:06.440
the game is all broken right now, but I also have like 700, 800 games in my backlog. So I'll just

02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:11.880
put this in there with them and come back to it when it's fixed. Well, and then of course also PC

02:20:11.880 --> 02:20:16.920
seems to be the least, uh, of the systems that's getting complaints. It's really about the older

02:20:16.920 --> 02:20:21.800
cons or I hate saying older consoles, but it's really what it is now. The PlayStation 4, Xbox one

02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:26.360
versions, because again, uh, we had that story a couple of weeks ago about how cyberpunk was, was

02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:33.000
shattering the steam concurrent play records by like a lot. And I would imagine those people

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:37.480
generally are having problem free experience. Well, you know, they're having Bethesda bug

02:20:37.480 --> 02:20:42.520
style experiences. They're not having like the, Oh my God, this is broken type of stuff that the

02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:48.520
PlayStation 4, some of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox one folks are experiencing. So, yeah. Yeah.

02:20:49.160 --> 02:20:56.120
All right. Anyhow. Well, speaking of steam, let's talk about steam sales. Has anyone now, and this

02:20:56.120 --> 02:21:01.480
is, this is very much a, uh, no one special question of the week, but, uh, I think it's

02:21:01.480 --> 02:21:07.560
worth asking, but has anyone succumbed to the steam sale or any type of digital sale going on?

02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:11.880
Well, you, you literally bought something during the show, right? I'm waiting for someone though,

02:21:11.880 --> 02:21:18.120
to buy me Detroit because of presence. Oh, I forgot that that's even on PC.

02:21:19.240 --> 02:21:25.080
Yeah. It's at the top of my steam one list. There you go. Um, I w I haven't picked it up yet,

02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:30.200
but of course, uh, the, the great enabler, my friend, Shane, uh, happened to mention to me,

02:21:30.200 --> 02:21:34.200
did you look at the sale on DJ max? And I was like, I don't want to buy that again.

02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:38.120
I already bought on PS4. Oh, it's really, it's down to 20 bucks now. Now it's in,

02:21:38.120 --> 02:21:43.480
now it's in the range where I might buy it again. Uh, so yeah, I haven't, I haven't done it yet,

02:21:43.480 --> 02:21:48.760
but I probably will pull the trigger before the new year and buy myself DJ max on steam again.

02:21:48.760 --> 02:21:52.600
Uh, Loki, have you, have you gotten suckered in any of those, uh, sales yet?

02:21:53.400 --> 02:22:00.600
Um, not really like my son wanted me to buy him, uh, Gary's mod. So I did that, but it wasn't on

02:22:00.600 --> 02:22:04.280
sale. I actually accidentally hit something that played out all through by speaker. So I didn't

02:22:04.280 --> 02:22:08.680
mean to scream into the mic. Oh, you're fine. It didn't come through on our end. So I know,

02:22:08.680 --> 02:22:17.640
but it blew my ears out. Um, I, I'm looking at fuser it's down to $40, but there's still,

02:22:17.640 --> 02:22:21.240
that's still a lot of money, man. And I just noticed like two people in chat were asking

02:22:21.240 --> 02:22:26.040
about that too. Yeah. I have not played fuser myself. That is one of those games where again,

02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:30.280
Shane tried to enable me on that, which most music games he does to be fair. And, and most of the

02:22:30.280 --> 02:22:34.680
time I'm I'm on board. Uh, it's just, I already bought DJ max on PlayStation four when it comes

02:22:34.680 --> 02:22:41.560
to fuser. Yeah. The $60 was a little high now that it's coming down. Uh, I, I might,

02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:46.600
I'm, I must see what my money, well, I guess we're all getting 600 bucks, but I'll let me see

02:22:46.600 --> 02:22:50.760
where my money's at in a couple in a, in a, well, I got to hurry up before the sales.

02:22:51.880 --> 02:22:58.360
Now is that $600? So like, is that like a loan from your tax refund type of thing?

02:22:58.360 --> 02:23:04.520
I, I don't know. I, I don't want to talk about it here. It's just to be determined from other

02:23:04.520 --> 02:23:10.040
places anyway. Oh, good point. Now see pixel pockets with some, with some good like coupon

02:23:10.040 --> 02:23:16.200
clip and tips here. If you buy it on Epic, which I don't love supporting Epic right now, cause I

02:23:16.200 --> 02:23:22.280
really think they're in the wrong on the whole, um, you know, Apple brew ha ha, but, uh, a good

02:23:22.280 --> 02:23:27.400
deal is a good deal. And basically says, if you buy it on Epic with a $10 coupon, it's 10 bucks

02:23:27.400 --> 02:23:32.680
cheaper than steam. I didn't think about that. Yeah. You make a good case. My friend will leave

02:23:32.680 --> 02:23:40.360
it at that. If you, if you and Shane teamed up, it would be deadly. I remember the, it's your free

02:23:40.360 --> 02:23:46.760
games. They have new games on Epic game store every day now for at least the foreseeable future

02:23:46.760 --> 02:23:51.720
that I have no problem taking advantage of. I'm getting it for free. Epic's paying somebody.

02:23:52.280 --> 02:23:56.920
That's not my problem. So yeah, no, I have been stacking up on those games. That's for sure.

02:23:57.480 --> 02:24:04.760
So, all right. Uh, so anyway, Oh, I didn't, God, we, I asked, I asked my no one special

02:24:04.760 --> 02:24:09.400
question and then I didn't even get to the damn story. So let's talk about how valve now has a

02:24:09.400 --> 02:24:14.040
filter. Uh, so you can better hunt for your discounts during the steam sales, which, um,

02:24:14.040 --> 02:24:17.800
again, is one of those things I'm kind of surprised it wasn't there before. Uh, so this is,

02:24:17.800 --> 02:24:22.040
this is good because now you're not overwhelmed with the fact that pretty much the entire store

02:24:22.040 --> 02:24:27.000
is on sale. So they have what's called faceted browsing. So you narrow down what you're looking

02:24:27.640 --> 02:24:34.520
while you're looking for the sales. So you use categories like visuals, themes, mood features,

02:24:34.520 --> 02:24:40.360
and you can of course combine these. It sounds a lot like tab tags on games. So for example,

02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:45.240
if you tell steam, I want to see third person sci-fi games, well, then steam will say, here

02:24:45.240 --> 02:24:50.200
you go, dead space three and star Wars battlefront. It sounds a lot like tabs, but it's not going to

02:24:50.200 --> 02:24:56.840
show every discounted game, but some of the more notable ones. So interesting. Uh, and I'm sure,

02:24:56.840 --> 02:25:00.520
Hey, any way that they can put the games you want to see in front of you? Cause I will say

02:25:00.520 --> 02:25:04.280
it is weird how steam just kind of, I feel like it's throwing everything in the kitchen sink at

02:25:04.280 --> 02:25:08.120
me, uh, when I log into steam and look at some of that stuff. So I think it's a good idea to

02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:16.040
highlight some of the big deals. Um, and, and yeah, otherwise, uh, sharing with friends and

02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:19.560
stuff is a good way to get the news around. Cause that's how I found out about, you know,

02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:26.040
both fuser and, uh, DJ backs going on sale. So, all right, let's move on to dark Sakura.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:34.600
There is a new game being, uh, uh, announced actually being developed by, um,

02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:39.800
arc system works and we know the awesomeness of arc system for their fighting games.

02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:49.640
Um, but they are doing a, uh, dungeon fighter, uh, fighting game, DNF, uh, DNF dual. Um, so it's

02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:57.640
being published by, uh, is it meeple Neopole and developed by arc system works. Um, and aiding,

02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:04.200
uh, they have announced the game, uh, it's based in unreal engine as a spinoff off the RPG dungeon

02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:11.960
fighter online. Um, and so, uh, they haven't announced like platforms, uh, no real release,

02:26:11.960 --> 02:26:19.160
uh, window, but it looks pretty freaking cool. I'm just saying, you know, I, I love practically

02:26:19.160 --> 02:26:28.840
anything that, that arc has done in this one really seems to be no, uh, no, uh, no less

02:26:28.840 --> 02:26:35.640
impressive than any of their guilty gear or any of those games. So, uh, Dr. C and chat says I used

02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:42.680
to play a ton of dungeon fighters. So an arc says fighting game has me curious. Yeah. If I will,

02:26:42.680 --> 02:26:49.000
I will, uh, share the, uh, the video in our chat room for those there. And for folks who are

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:55.000
playing the home version of the game, uh, look it up. All right. Um, one more story here from

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:59.080
Loki, and then we'll open it up to the listener round table and check our mailbag Loki.

02:26:59.720 --> 02:27:04.440
It's a remaster that none of us have been waiting for, but it's still pretty cool. So

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:11.480
probably soon to be featured on, um, games done quick, but I want to be the guy has a brand new

02:27:11.480 --> 02:27:19.640
remaster after 13 years. And so they said this, uh, it's mostly faithfully are the mostly faithful

02:27:19.640 --> 02:27:24.840
remaster of the original. I want to be the guy, uh, trying to balance the spirit of the original

02:27:24.840 --> 02:27:30.920
game with the desire for a consistent physics, like the fan games that came after in fixing some

02:27:30.920 --> 02:27:38.600
of the jank. And so it's available for free. Uh, basically what it is converted the game from the

02:27:38.600 --> 02:27:46.920
original multimedia fusion to project, to the U the U two engine, which apparently is also referred

02:27:46.920 --> 02:27:53.400
to as I want to be the engine. So, uh, kind of fun. They've been using that for a lot of the

02:27:53.400 --> 02:28:00.280
different fan, um, games, which there are quite a few of, and, um, apparently it is officially

02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:04.840
endorsed by the original creator as well, calling it the perfect package for anyone that wants to

02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:11.800
try the game out in 2020. So, uh, definitely go track it down, but, uh, yeah, pretty, pretty

02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:15.960
exciting, especially with it right around the corner. Yeah. Or probably being featured in,

02:28:15.960 --> 02:28:21.160
I know they have the fan game. I want to be the fan game is in, um, games done quick.

02:28:21.160 --> 02:28:25.160
So there's usually one or a few of these that are featured each year.

02:28:26.280 --> 02:28:30.200
Nice. Good note to end on. Cause I know that game's come up quite a few times on this show.

02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:34.920
It's kind of cool to see a remaster after all these years too. So yeah. Very cool. All right.

02:28:34.920 --> 02:28:39.480
Well, that was our last slotted story for tonight. We will take a trip to the listener round table.

02:28:39.480 --> 02:28:43.400
If you guys have any questions or things you want to add in our chat room, now's a great time over

02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:48.200
twitch.tv slash a VOG network. And I'll check in on emails in just a moment, but I want to address

02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:53.240
this round table questions already came in from no one special. Who's saying what's I know. What's

02:28:53.240 --> 02:28:57.880
the best game that came out this year is the easy go-to question, but I want to, what's the worst

02:28:57.880 --> 02:29:02.760
basically. I'm going to hold onto that question actually. Uh, no one's special, sorry. And just

02:29:02.760 --> 02:29:08.280
kind of instead tease next week, since I anticipated it'll be another slow news week with

02:29:08.280 --> 02:29:13.160
new years and everything, although anything can happen next week, we will talk about our favorite

02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:17.720
games of the year. You'll notice the wording I use there is not the best games of the year. It's

02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:22.280
our best games of the year. We will talk about that. And just for, you know, in special, we will

02:29:22.280 --> 02:29:27.080
talk about the worst as well. Um, although I honestly, nothing is jumping to the front of my

02:29:27.080 --> 02:29:30.600
mind, but I'm sure if I check my history of some things I've looked at, I'll find something where

02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:33.800
I was like, Oh yeah, I didn't care for that. So we'll get into that. So I'm going to tease that

02:29:33.800 --> 02:29:41.160
for next week. We will do that. Um. Something, and this was completely my bad. We never did do

02:29:41.160 --> 02:29:45.160
predictions this year. And that was my bad because I kept putting it off in January and then it

02:29:45.160 --> 02:29:51.960
never happened. And then who could have, we did. I thought we didn't. Did we swear we did. Well,

02:29:51.960 --> 02:29:57.560
I was going to say the Darth Vader tin. We did that this year. I thought we didn't do it this

02:29:57.560 --> 02:30:03.640
year. Now we did because the previous year I had re I'd stuck the ones from the previous year in

02:30:03.640 --> 02:30:09.160
there as well. My thought was it's going to have the previous year stuff still in it. So I was

02:30:09.160 --> 02:30:14.440
going to open it anyway. Yeah, it should have. Yeah. All right. Well then we'll open it and

02:30:14.440 --> 02:30:19.320
we'll see, maybe I'll open it and I'll go, it's fucking nothing, but we'll see. I thought, yeah,

02:30:19.320 --> 02:30:23.640
SG100 Matt says we didn't. You see, he's with me. We, I thought we skipped it, but we'll see.

02:30:23.640 --> 02:30:26.840
Was it, maybe you, maybe you just fucking wrote it down and put it in there.

02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:35.080
So anyway, I would have, we will open that up next week as well. And this time we will

02:30:35.080 --> 02:30:39.800
put predictions in next week. I don't know how I let it slip this year. I thought I let it slip,

02:30:39.800 --> 02:30:43.640
but maybe I didn't, but we will make sure we get back on track with that for next year.

02:30:43.640 --> 02:30:47.560
But I admit it's, it's funny because my brain is like, there's no way we could have fucking

02:30:47.560 --> 02:30:55.560
predicted what happened this year. Like, no. Um, so it will be interesting to see for next year.

02:30:55.560 --> 02:31:01.720
Cause you know, I'm thinking things like D did dragon con happen this year or did they put it

02:31:01.720 --> 02:31:05.480
off or did they do a smaller one? Those are some of the interesting questions I have right now.

02:31:05.480 --> 02:31:13.480
So, uh, we'll see. Anyway, next week. So best of, worst of, the rest of, and this gives us one more

02:31:13.480 --> 02:31:19.240
week of holiday time to play some games and just make sure, you know, the lists are where we want

02:31:19.240 --> 02:31:26.200
them to be. So we'll go over that next week. Um, anyway, uh, emails, uh, you guys send us emails

02:31:26.200 --> 02:31:31.160
every week. No, they don't. No, they don't. Not tonight. Well, let me get, let me give the address

02:31:31.160 --> 02:31:35.720
at least for next time. If you want to send us an email for use on a future show, participate

02:31:35.720 --> 02:31:40.040
at orange lounge, radio.com is the place to send us an email. We do keep an eye on the Twitter.

02:31:40.040 --> 02:31:44.200
I know I don't expressly read tweets here on the show. Sometimes I just respond to them.

02:31:44.200 --> 02:31:49.960
Uh, but you could tweet us at OLR, uh, is where you can find us on Twitter. And a lot of us use

02:31:49.960 --> 02:31:54.200
Twitter personally. This would, our soccer is kind of on there full time now. So we're all on Twitter

02:31:54.200 --> 02:31:59.400
as well under our own accounts. Uh, I am at Mr. Rob Roberts because the spammer took Rob Roberts,

02:31:59.400 --> 02:32:03.480
but I'm Mr. Rob Roberts. Dark soccer is that you're just at dark soccer, right? You were

02:32:03.480 --> 02:32:09.560
able to get that name, which I have had forever. Yep. And then Loki is at Loki, OLR, right? Yep.

02:32:09.560 --> 02:32:15.800
And everything. Although I will tell people 90% of what I talk about is still, uh, um,

02:32:15.800 --> 02:32:24.600
supernatural fan link. So just saying, uh, mine is sassy, whatever. And I always say to myself,

02:32:24.600 --> 02:32:28.280
don't tweet anything political, don't tweet anything. And then I do it. I can't keep my

02:32:28.280 --> 02:32:32.760
mouth shut. I can't, I just, there's, there's a lot to say. It just happens. It just happens.

02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:40.600
I just like, like, oops, I politicked again. Yeah. He will write something on his Twitter

02:32:40.600 --> 02:32:45.800
and then I can't help, but write something nasty in response. I just, I can't help myself.

02:32:46.440 --> 02:32:51.480
You know, it's funny. Okay. So first of all, I've never followed it's Twitter because it is

02:32:51.480 --> 02:32:57.800
not a human in my brain. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but I've just been referring to calling it

02:32:57.800 --> 02:33:03.800
the tyrant. Yeah, that's fair. Anyway. Uh, I, I read a great idea somewhere that was,

02:33:04.920 --> 02:33:10.360
if you forgot, if you had one of those, um, Christmas candy calendars that you can like

02:33:10.360 --> 02:33:14.920
pop out all the, is that what they call them? They're called advent calendars. Okay. Yeah.

02:33:14.920 --> 02:33:20.680
And if you forgot to use that this year, if you start, I think it was today or yesterday,

02:33:20.680 --> 02:33:25.880
it can now be a countdown to the inauguration. So you can down for that.

02:33:29.480 --> 02:33:33.640
Oh man, such a good idea. I feel like I could have capitalized on that.

02:33:33.640 --> 02:33:37.960
So dark soccer, you may not celebrate Christmas, but you can celebrate that.

02:33:39.160 --> 02:33:44.440
I celebrate, I celebrate gift-mas. Yeah, that's fair. That's fair. By the way, Rob,

02:33:44.440 --> 02:33:50.760
and I, I know I tagged you in this, but, um, but Dan saw how disappointed I was that we couldn't

02:33:50.760 --> 02:33:59.160
have a gay Joomis. Yeah. And so he tried like four different places to try to get me Chinese food.

02:33:59.160 --> 02:34:04.760
And then last night, bless him, bless his heart in the positive Southern sense,

02:34:05.720 --> 02:34:11.720
he got me Chinese food and I'm still eating it today. There was a feature in the local paper

02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:16.120
about restaurants open on Christmas day. And there seemed to be a lot more this year,

02:34:16.120 --> 02:34:19.800
but it was, it wasn't stuff in suburbia where you and I are, it was stuff downtown.

02:34:19.800 --> 02:34:23.880
Like, um, Bombay, the Indian place apparently was open on Christmas. I never knew they were

02:34:23.880 --> 02:34:27.080
open on Christmas. Apparently they're open every Christmas. I'm like, well,

02:34:27.080 --> 02:34:30.200
shit. That's what dark soccer and I need to change our tradition to Indian food.

02:34:31.400 --> 02:34:37.720
You know what? Hey, it's an Asia. So, uh, and then I think there was,

02:34:37.720 --> 02:34:42.040
there's a lot of places downtown that, that are open, uh, on credit. Cause a lot of restaurants

02:34:42.040 --> 02:34:50.040
need the business. It's really sad, but it's true. You know, it's so, it's so sad. Um, but, uh,

02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:58.680
I, I just, I don't, I don't know, just this whole thing just got me. Like I did not have

02:34:58.680 --> 02:35:03.640
a good Christmas. Dan wasn't into it. It feels like it didn't happen. I didn't,

02:35:03.640 --> 02:35:07.320
I didn't go see my dad. I didn't see Alan's family. Like it just feels like it didn't

02:35:07.320 --> 02:35:15.320
happen this year for me. The other thing too, is that, you know, Dan's mom died at the beginning

02:35:15.320 --> 02:35:24.920
of the year and you know, my dad died and it just neither of us were really in any kind of spirit

02:35:24.920 --> 02:35:29.640
for it. You know, I hear you. It's been, and I think that's okay. I think if Christmas for you

02:35:29.640 --> 02:35:34.120
was just a mental health decompression, I don't want to adult today kind of day.

02:35:35.080 --> 02:35:42.040
I think that's totally fine. That was it. I didn't want to think or exist. I mean,

02:35:42.040 --> 02:35:47.880
and by exist as like, I didn't want to participate in living. Yeah. I mean,

02:35:48.680 --> 02:35:54.280
I guess that makes sense. You're not saying it in a, in a alarming way. You're saying it in a,

02:35:54.280 --> 02:36:03.080
I, today I don't exist to anyone but me. Yeah. It was just like, I, I took myself out of the

02:36:03.080 --> 02:36:07.560
equation. Yeah. I'm a ghost today. You don't see me. This sheet over my body, this blanket means

02:36:07.560 --> 02:36:17.000
you don't see me. I'm John Cena. You can't see me. So anyway, I actually, you want to know,

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:23.160
it's funny. I'm working on Supernatural fan fiction, right? You tweet about it a lot, right?

02:36:23.480 --> 02:36:35.800
I put out published 25 chapters in a month. Dang. That's good. And I wrote three chapters

02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:41.400
and published them in three days. Nice. And I have another one written that I haven't published

02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:48.680
and I'm almost done with another. Busy, busy. Yeah, but that's how much, how little I've

02:36:48.680 --> 02:36:52.760
wanted to participate in the real world right now. But I understand you got to do what you

02:36:52.760 --> 02:36:57.800
got to do. I've been, I've honestly been losing myself in work, but in a good way. Like I, I

02:36:57.800 --> 02:37:00.840
literally enjoys the thing. I get to work on creative projects and stuff. So I've just been

02:37:00.840 --> 02:37:06.200
kind of like going in that and I'm just like, I am happy with this. The only thing, the only thing

02:37:07.720 --> 02:37:11.640
is some of the toys that I get to use at work. I'm like, God, I wish I had this for all our,

02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:16.200
cause I've actually, I have access to creative cloud. I have all of Adobe stuff. So I'm like,

02:37:16.200 --> 02:37:19.880
I want to also has access to creative cloud. Oh, do you, do you have it for yourself? I

02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:24.200
didn't know that. Yeah, cause I still do freelance. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. That's nice.

02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:29.240
So if you ever need to use, I can't have it installed on your computer,

02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:35.080
but you can come over and use premiere or anything. So, um, and by the way, um, back to

02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:43.240
my fanfic thing, if you want it, message me on, uh, Twitter at dark Sakura and I will provide you

02:37:43.240 --> 02:37:48.040
with a link. Sounds good. All right. Well, I guess we're getting to that wrap up time, uh,

02:37:48.040 --> 02:37:51.800
here at the show. So I want to thank everybody for checking out our show tonight, whether you

02:37:51.800 --> 02:37:55.640
were here live or you are participating on the podcast feed. Uh, thank you so much for listening

02:37:55.640 --> 02:38:00.760
to our show. Uh, a nice word, uh, about the show. Word of mouth goes a long way. Tell a friend or

02:38:00.760 --> 02:38:03.720
two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has

02:38:03.720 --> 02:38:08.680
a voice, but without the voices here, uh, we've got nothing to say. Uh, and you know, as I

02:38:08.680 --> 02:38:12.520
mentioned earlier in the show, it's really you guys that have kept us going for 18 and a half

02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:17.720
years throughout all of this and this craziness. Um, we don't ask for your money, but if you do

02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:22.040
feel so inclined to support the show in that kind of way, um, it, it is very helpful and helps us

02:38:22.040 --> 02:38:26.440
to maintain the business, uh, side of things. So a big thank you for the bits and the subs.

02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:30.600
I'll acknowledge those after the program, but I also want to say a quick shout out to the online

02:38:30.600 --> 02:38:36.120
store. Um, so if you want to check out some online merch, go to vog network.com slash shop,

02:38:36.120 --> 02:38:40.200
and you can check out some t-shirts and some stickers so you can make anything in OLR piece

02:38:40.200 --> 02:38:44.120
of merchandise, but make sure you have permission. Don't go, don't go sticking it on archaic phone

02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:48.760
booths and things like that. That's vandalism. Uh, but, uh, you can get stickers and, and there

02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:52.760
will be more to come in the new year. We're going to try to slowly trickle out some things there

02:38:52.760 --> 02:38:58.760
on the shop. So appreciate, uh, all the support there as well. Um, otherwise I think that does it

02:38:58.760 --> 02:39:03.640
and it's time to get everybody's final thoughts. The last final thoughts of 2020, the next time

02:39:03.640 --> 02:39:10.040
we come to you 2021, sadly, new year's day is not going to magically fix all of our problems,

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:15.320
but we see the light. The real year starts on January 24th.

02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:21.480
I well, and, and even more so when I can get the jab quite fresh six weeks after I get the jab,

02:39:21.480 --> 02:39:28.440
quite frankly, but, uh, yes, uh, we'll be, we'll be, there's lots to look forward to in 2021 and

02:39:28.440 --> 02:39:34.360
we'll put it at that. So let's get everybody's final thoughts for the night. Um, Loki,

02:39:34.360 --> 02:39:37.800
I'll start with you. I'm just going to continue working on my game,

02:39:38.760 --> 02:39:42.600
hopefully make progress, more progress than I did release it in 2021.

02:39:44.440 --> 02:39:49.560
It will definitely be released in 2021. I owe you a pizza and probably January. I'd

02:39:49.560 --> 02:39:53.880
see most likely January. I just want to rush through green levels, but you don't rush. Like I,

02:39:54.840 --> 02:39:59.880
I just want to get the animated tiles to look awesome to saying, I know the listeners are

02:39:59.880 --> 02:40:03.720
going to yell at me, but seriously, if cyberpunk has taught us anything, if you need to tell

02:40:04.040 --> 02:40:09.640
February, take till February, you know, take, I can't patch a card. Exactly. Cause you've

02:40:09.640 --> 02:40:13.640
got people that now, now this is becoming more than a, Oh, I'll download it and play it. This

02:40:13.640 --> 02:40:18.440
is becoming a, I want the collector's edition from Loki. So you got to get it right, buddy.

02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:23.320
Well, I got to get suppliers for that stuff anyway. So that may take time. All right. Fair

02:40:23.320 --> 02:40:28.680
enough. Fair enough. All right. Um, so let's move on to, uh, I'll go, I'll go my final thought. Um,

02:40:28.680 --> 02:40:31.720
I don't, I don't have a lot cause I think I already kind of gushed earlier in the show,

02:40:31.720 --> 02:40:35.560
but again, just a big thank you to everybody who supported us throughout this crazy year.

02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:43.320
And, um, I look forward to 2021 and the hopefulness that 2021 brings and, uh,

02:40:43.320 --> 02:40:50.360
the renewed sense of I'm going to have a list of things I want to do. And now I'm going to do them

02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:56.200
because if 2020 taught me anything, it's that one day I might not. So I'm going to do my

02:40:56.200 --> 02:41:01.960
damnedest to try to get them done in 2021 when it's safe to do so. Uh, dark soccer,

02:41:01.960 --> 02:41:10.040
your final thought. I don't know. Uh, if you can be anything,

02:41:10.040 --> 02:41:19.080
be kind. And if you can't be kind, be Batman. Working on it. Have a great week, everybody.

02:41:19.080 --> 02:41:23.880
Happy new year. Be safe. I mean, I shouldn't tell you things like don't drink and drive

02:41:23.880 --> 02:41:28.440
cause you shouldn't be going to parties where there's drinking anyway. Um, but make good

02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:32.680
choices. We'll leave it at that. Um, have a great week. There, there is still a pandemic.

02:41:32.680 --> 02:41:38.520
You wishing it away doesn't change it. Um, so make good choices and, um, let's be here to party

02:41:38.520 --> 02:41:43.960
when we all get vaccinated in 2021. Have a great week, everybody. Good night. Happy gaming.
