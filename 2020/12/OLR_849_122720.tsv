0	13720	Personally, I thought that Apple's Trash Can Mac Pro was generally a great machine,
13720	17120	but I understand that the lack of expandability was a net loss for the form factor. Does that
17120	21520	mean I should be more positive about the KF console? No! No! I don't think it does!
21520	25600	Capturing heat so close to a heat source that it's supposed to be cool sounds awful. Grease
25600	29840	and oil are not ingredients in liquid cooling. This is just one story in a night of lawsuits
29840	33840	anniversary shutdowns and wrap ups. Join your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki
33840	36800	as they discuss this and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show
36800	44320	where every gamer has a voice. Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to
44320	49800	another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and
49800	56360	we are live once again with, if you can believe it, the last show of 2020. It is episode number
56360	64600	849 for tonight, December the 27th of 2020. My name is Rob Roberts, by myself in the studio
64600	69560	as I have been for most of this year since March, and joining me via the Magic Discord
69560	76920	say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers. Welcome to my mess. Your mess looks fine.
76920	84760	It's definitely a nerd cave. It's a work in progress. I've thrown out four trash bags
84760	89160	worth of just garbage. You know, the folks that listen to us on the podcast feed, which
89160	92760	I would always strongly encourage, of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the
92760	97360	Voice of Geeks network, twitch.tv slash VOG network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
97360	100720	at about six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern. But for those that can't be here
100720	104760	live and I understand Sunday's a busy night for a lot of people, we do have the podcast
104760	109240	which has been going for a very long time, which you can check out on iTunes, Spotify,
109240	114560	lots of popular podcast players out there. All the things. The podcast folks can't see
114560	120800	what you're talking about. So you can mess you can lie and say, oh, it's it's this. Everything
120800	129960	is well curated. I own my shit. And I know I have been lazy and sick for most of the
129960	136000	year and the shit piled up and I have years of old cosplay stuff. I found 20 year old
136000	144320	cosplays a few weeks ago, Rob. Oh, my gosh. I finally threw them out. My Leona costume.
144960	150880	OK, the short the cargo shorts I had for my Leona costume, I can now pull on by one leg
150880	159640	over my hips. Yeah. So I was got says something. I was going to say, don't ask me to show the
159640	163760	rest of the studio here and what's happened to this, this outside this little box that
163760	169080	you see me in. Dark Soccer's throne has clean laundry on it. There's a monitor on the table
170080	176880	up to the show and it's seen your laundry on it. So it's a girl don't even try me. It's
176880	183320	a convenient place. But but at any rate, I've only kept one of the old costumes and that
183320	189280	was my Jill costume because it was the first one I did when I moved to California. And
189280	194100	I actually threw away Emmy. Except I saved the striped shirt I had under it was actually
194100	203780	an old Navy pajama shirt and it's really warm. So I kept that. But like the wig, I
203780	210380	didn't know about wig care back then very well. And that poor blue wig was like that.
210380	218260	Yeah, it was ready to go. I kept the hat, the ginormous white tam that she wears. So
218260	222660	and it was actually in really good shape. I mean, I paid 20 bucks for it 20 years ago,
222660	231580	so it had to be good. So yeah, useful stuff and I found a sewing kit. Okay. I also did
231580	236780	get rid of bike in because I can do a lot better. I'm taking a look at our chat room
236780	241060	because of course while we tape live you can participate along in our chat chat over twitch.tv
241060	246860	slash v o g network and SSU 100. Matt says rooms full of mess and piled up stuff much
246860	253820	like many folks Animal Crossing homes. And to answer Phoenix 7726 who says I found cosplay
253820	264340	as old as olr. No, it's older. It's under sedation age. Oh, but grandpa grandpa died
264340	270400	under sedation isn't around anymore. So also to answer ranch on. Travis is fine. He got
270400	277920	an Xbox for Christmas just Tamari costume is in another box. And actually the kimono
277920	285280	is way too big for me but still in great shape. And I'm thinking about taking it in and repurposing
285280	294680	it. It might end up as a certain Shinsengumi character who will remain unnamed. Right?
294680	299400	Well let me I'll let me also introduce as I do every week say hello to tech master Loki.
299400	302960	Hello. Hi. Are you holding on to any old cosplay Loki?
302960	310200	No way. Don't you have Sackboy? He's threw that away.
310200	317120	It was in the garage for a very long time. And I was just afraid that if I put my head
317120	323760	in it that there could be so many spiders. So I was like, I'm not gonna risk it. I'm
323760	332800	just gonna throw it away. Yeah, well, you know, I did actually check it before I threw
332800	335960	it away. But like it was just so dusty and stuff. And I was like, I'm never gonna wear
335960	341920	this again. Yeah. So yeah, I forgot about that Sackboy costume. But that was now that
341920	345580	you mentioned it. That was a legendary episode. Well, our wasn't that like the 10th anniversary
345580	349840	or something like it was a landmark episode, maybe Episode 500. I don't remember. But you
349840	356600	dressed all dark Tetsuya. What episode was it or Misty? I need to ask the real experts
356600	363800	of the show. But you you actually came to the studio. I do remember it was at the house
363800	368840	over. I don't want to give out addresses on the show. I guess I don't live there anymore.
368840	372400	But the ranch is the garage. Yeah, well, yeah, it was in the garage there. Yeah, yeah. And
372400	376760	I remember it was in that studio. You had the neighbor across the street who house caught
376760	383680	on fire. Yes. Did I tell that story on O.L.R.? I don't remember. I may not have. I remember
383680	388880	driving by and seeing the house gutted. And that's always what I remember. Well, I can
388880	394520	tell it now. I probably. And Drew knocking over the table. I probably didn't want to
394520	398560	tell it then, because if I told it on air, it would have given away where I lived. But
398560	404480	I live there anymore. So it doesn't matter. So this true story, the house across the street
404480	409440	from me burned down one day. And I know that sounds really scary. And what's also really
409440	415240	scary about it is that I was napping when it happened. I slept through the whole damn
415240	420160	thing. And I woke up to the sounds of my room. My roommate, Johnny, came home and he was
420160	425480	like, Rob, Rob, are you here? Rob, Rob. And I'm like, what? Are you OK? And he goes, he
425480	431260	just gives me this look like he goes, look outside. And I like peek through the mini
431260	437500	blinds and I just see all these lights and I see the house on smoke. Like, what the fuck?
437500	443360	And yeah, the house across the street burned down. And it was one of those things where
443360	449580	they had a lot of devices and power cords that were going into their garage as if they
449580	455740	were potentially making some things in the garage, allegedly. And that's I'm going to
455740	462460	leave it at that. So, yeah, that was that was an interesting experience. So we moved
462460	470380	either meth or porn. We moved. So, yeah, we should make that a new game show, meth or
470380	474460	porn. Yeah. Who knows what was going on in that house. So, yeah, I probably didn't tell
474460	477400	that story on air at the time, because, you know, if I say, oh, the house across the street
477400	482380	from me burned down, then people would figure out exactly where I live. But I don't live
482380	487660	there anymore. So it's fine. Yeah. Act Defton chat says they blazed it. They sure did.
487660	491420	I you know, I don't like to make fun of it because somebody's house burned down. But
491420	497980	at the same time, if it if it was what we all suspect it was, then how bad do you feel
497980	501620	on a scale of one to ten? You know, yeah. If you can't make a joke about it, what can
501620	507100	you do? Right. So, yes. So that was that was I don't know how we got on this subject from
507100	516140	welcome to our hope. You all had a great holiday. Yes. Yes. I have a new breaking thing
516140	525740	is that a gaming magazine, JYMING has highlighted Rock Rockum Sakura of San Francisco. Oh, fine.
525740	532620	Well, they've got their who is a gaming queen. They have their award show, which I can't
532620	536620	remember the name of off the top of my head. Sorry. But I know they nominated a bunch of
536620	541740	stuff. Oh, well, are not nominated, but that's OK. How very dare they? That's all right.
541740	546580	That's all right. But no, there's a lot of good stuff that was nominated there. I remember
546580	551020	seeing it across the Twitter stuff. And I was thinking like, I guess I because there
551020	555020	was talk about doing that show in person at one point, obviously, even though I think
555020	558580	it's in February, I think I think that talk is still off the table. I don't think people
558580	564180	can really plan on in-person events until at least summer. And even then, there's going
564180	573260	to be footnotes, asterisks and things of that nature. But yeah. So anyway, Phoenix, seventy
573260	578500	seven, twenty six and chat says, wait, is OLR the new Night Vale? I don't know. I don't
578500	582740	know. We probably have more listeners if we were. All right. Let's get it. We are we are
582740	588340	a video game podcast. We love all of our listeners. We do. And we hope you all had a good holiday
589100	594780	I know. I know Hanukkah ended quite some time ago. But Christmas, Christmas was this past
594780	598820	week, which I know a lot of people celebrate. So I hope you all had a good Christmas that
598820	605540	we're celebrating that. Kwanzaa goes for seven days. Right. So we're in that starts the day
605540	610580	after Christmas. So we're in the midst of that. And then Festivus for the rest of us.
610580	617060	I know I saw some posts on that. And if you're Satanist, Sol Invictus. Oh, right. Or paganist
617100	624100	would have solstice. Yule. Or Yule. Yes. Yule or Solstice. But may you have a an unconquerable
626540	632540	Sol Invictus? DJ Rama S in chat says six days. My bad. Six days. For Kwanzaa. Yes, for Kwanzaa.
632540	638700	Yeah. All right. Anyway, let's get into video game news and stuff going on in the game world,
638700	642780	which considering it is a holiday week, like usually this would be the night of nothing
642860	649540	but off topic because there's not a lot happening in the industry. But we can do that. And we
649540	655740	damn well might challenge us, try us. No, but we do have quite a bit of gaming news.
655740	659860	There's still less. I know we have kind of a shorter show role than we usually do just
659860	664100	because less did happen. But I honestly feel like most years we're sitting here this week
664100	669180	going, we ain't found shit. Right. Like there isn't a lot going on in gaming. But this this
669180	675260	week has been pretty busy, all things considered. And it starts with it starts with something
675260	680660	I think we all saw coming. Dark Soccer and Loki going to talk about this one Dark Soccer.
680660	687220	Why did you start us off? What happened? Well, CD Projekt Red, you know, the ones who are
687220	696980	responsible for that clusterfuck that is Cyberpunk 277. They are seeing some lawsuits because
696980	707620	they basically were considered to miss mislead the public. So some of the class action lawsuits
707620	715140	are being brought forward. Actually, one of them is brought on on behalf of Andrew Tramp,
715140	722620	who is one of the investors by the Rosen law firm alleging that CDPR willfully neglected
722620	729060	to inform investors of the nature of how buggy the game was and that the company downplayed
729060	735860	other issues surrounding the game prior to release. They were saying that their public
735860	741600	statements that were made prior to release, and this is a quote, were materially false
741600	746960	and or misleading because they misrepresented facts and the company failed to disclose that
746960	753320	Cyberpunk 277 was virtually unplayable on current generation Xbox or PlayStation systems
753320	762760	due to an enormous amount of bugs. And I'm going to read the comments from the CDPR executives.
762760	767160	This is another quote. After three delays, we as the management board were too focused
767160	771400	on releasing the game. We underestimated the scale and complexity of the issues. We ignored
771400	776760	the signals about the need for additional time to refine the game on the base last gen
776760	782240	consoles. It was the wrong approach and against our business philosophy. On top of that, during
782240	787320	the campaign, we showed the game mostly on PCs. They're basically like, yeah, we were
787320	795640	shitty. There's another lawsuit from the Schall, S-C-H-A-L-L, Schall law firm seeking class
795640	803920	action status for violations. They list the ones for the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
803920	809360	and rule 10B5 promulgated there under blah, blah, blah. It's more had to do with the US
809360	814040	Securities and Exchange Commission basically laying out the same evidence that was presented
814040	819080	by the Rosen law firm, citing the bugs and mere unplayable status of the game for the
819080	824400	earlier consoles. They're quote, based on these facts companies, public statements were
824400	828980	false and materially misleading throughout the class period when the market learned the
828980	839500	truth about CD project investors suffered damages. And there was a hot fix that was
839500	846740	released basically to address bugs and performance issues. There was another one that was released
846740	855220	this week, or I guess by this week, I mean, it's last week to fix the save data corruption
855220	860380	for PC. And it's looking like there's going to be other fixes, but I'm wondering if it's
860380	867820	going to be too little too late for what's going to be on the table. Because I mean,
867820	871300	there are people who can't afford to go right out and buy the new console right when it
871300	875140	comes out and they'd like to be able to enjoy the game. The game was advertised as supposed
875140	877900	to be available and playable on this earlier consoles.
877900	881620	Right. What's interesting though, and you know, we'll talk a little later in the show
881620	885940	as well, because I think Loki has a piece on like how the game is actually doing right
885940	889260	now. We'll talk a little bit about that later in the show, but I think what's important
889260	894500	to note in what you just outlined there with what's going on in the two different class
894500	900180	actions there is that this is an investor piece. So this isn't what this isn't. And
900180	904020	I think where people kind of thought it would go based on some prior class actions that
904020	907960	have happened in the past is that at least in what Dark Soccer is talking about now,
907960	913360	the gears they're turning now, this is not gamer upset at the product they bought. That
913360	920200	is not what this is. This is a lawsuit for investors because yeah, the goal of a company
920200	925840	is to make money for investors, right? Capitalism, woohoo, whatever. But that is what it is.
925840	927640	And so, go ahead.
927640	932480	SSJ 100, Matt actually did sum it up very perfectly and I quote, so the investors are
932480	936720	pretty much suing to reclaim whatever they lost from the stocks they owned in it.
937480	943760	Yeah, that's pretty much it in a nutshell or that basically by perception of money lost
943760	948920	by yeah, perception of money lost by having these various refunds that are going on and
948920	956640	by not releasing by kind of hiding what you did on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, you affected
956640	961120	basically the bottom line, the sales. So that is, that is I think very interesting to note
962000	968560	This is coming from the investor standpoint because I feel like with that playing into
968560	976160	it, the result of this whole thing could have implications in our industry further down,
976160	984640	I think. Too early to say, but you know, everybody in gaming right now, whether you love Cyberpunk,
984640	990040	whether you hate it, whether you don't care, wherever you're at on that, that, you know,
990680	997240	everybody's looking at this because what happens here, I think will have an impact on how games
997240	1002600	are marketed, height and so on in the future. Again, this is very, I think what's happening
1002600	1007400	here is very different from what happened with No Man's Sky, which was the product, not of a
1007400	1011800	publicly traded company, by the way, and was more rooted in some PR blunders.
1011800	1015640	You say why I don't go out and buy new games anymore.
1016600	1020200	I think a lot of us are at that point, to be quite honest. Anyway,
1020200	1022120	I don't get excited anymore.
1022120	1025320	Loki, I know this story has been on your radar this week as well. I don't know if there's
1025320	1027160	anything you want to add or anything from your perspective.
1028040	1033160	No, not really. I mean, it's pretty much, it's just, you know, investors, um, feeling that they
1033160	1038840	were misled. And usually if that happened, you get in trouble with the board or, you know, you have
1038840	1043240	to answer to that. So kind of just more of what we were talking about last week, how probably
1043320	1049320	leadership's gonna be held accountable for that. Um, and someone may get let go, you never know,
1049320	1053880	but that's kind of just more coming out of this. I think you're absolutely right on that. Um,
1053880	1060040	let's see Questbuster in chat says, uh, CD project stock has lost nearly half its value in the past
1060040	1065960	few months. It lost around 20% around the cyberpunk 2077 fiasco. And I think that's an
1065960	1071000	important thing to point out is because again, it doesn't really matter how you feel about the game
1071000	1074920	personally. Cause I also see people in chat that are saying, you know, a Zen monkey 11 says people
1074920	1080520	will be able to play the game on any platform by March. No worries. Um, Questbuster says it's not
1080520	1085480	unplayable on a PS4. I finished it, but it could definitely have used more time in the oven and not
1085480	1090600	everyone will want to deal with the bugs. And again, this isn't about like trying to take a
1090600	1096200	dump on the game or whatever, like, or, or pour gasoline on a fire. That's already going. This
1096200	1101480	is more like just facing the kind of the reality of no matter how you personally feel about the
1101480	1109400	game, because the refund mechanism got triggered because these headlines about Sony pulls a game
1109400	1116360	from digital sale, you know, whether that was really something that Sony did about the quality
1116360	1122840	or whether that was a response to Sony did because of something CD project reds leadership did
1122920	1128280	saying, go to Sony. Yeah. Right. Cause they told them to go to Sony, but they didn't tell Sony
1128280	1133400	that they were doing that. So that's why they pulled it from the shop. And that again is a
1133400	1137080	problem of leadership. And that's the point I'm trying to make. Again, you have a problem of
1137080	1143480	leadership and ultimately what got impacted the stock value and the, the, you know, whether
1144600	1150120	the refunds were as big as we think they are or not. And that whole thing, it doesn't matter.
1150120	1155960	The stock value plummeted because of all of the bad press, because Sony pulling your game from
1155960	1161080	the store is not a great headline. Even if quality didn't have anything to do with it,
1161080	1166920	because believe me and believe you, cause you've seen it too. There's a lot of shit on the
1166920	1172360	PlayStation four marketplace. There is some garbage on the PlayStation four marketplace
1172360	1177080	and the X-Box marketplace and any cell phone marketplace and steam, you name it.
1177080	1184680	It's got garbage. So quality is not the problem. Ultimately. I know that sounds weird to say.
1185800	1192520	So the thing is, is that when the garbage is something that's expected to be the utter
1192520	1202280	opposite of garbage, you know, it's, it's just really bothersome, you know, this whole situation
1202520	1210840	is very bothersome. And I actually, I mean, I do want to see them held to the fire over it a lot
1210840	1220920	more, just because I think that we need to stop this whole thing of having these half-baked games
1220920	1228440	come out. Yeah. You know, if we, if we have, you know, people putting the same care into like what
1228440	1234360	they would have done for a cartridge based game in the past, because you can't patch a cartridge.
1235000	1239800	That's true. Well, you, well, I mean, I guess if you had.
1241800	1248040	The average gamer does not patch a cartridge back in the NES days. Yes.
1248680	1255320	Unless you were getting, you know, ROM hacks and translated ROMs. I digress. But
1255320	1263240	it's it's really just a shame and it's something that we need to hold these companies accountable
1263240	1268600	for, you know, they shouldn't. I'll just say, I, I, I think ultimately,
1268600	1274040	and just following what I said last week, I think how this ends one or both CEOs will be done.
1274040	1278760	And that's how this ends. There's, there's no other outcome. I think that could satisfy
1278760	1285160	the investors at this point. And that's that. I think they're still going to try
1286040	1292600	to play this. But it won't matter. And I really, I kind of have hope that they do.
1294120	1298360	And this is just more of me now being a little bit vindictive about it.
1298920	1305400	But if they try to play it off more, keep trying to do the same thing and then fail after that,
1305400	1311480	like burn harder, then I think that's really going to get the, the message across. And I mean,
1312040	1318840	I don't want to bring politics into it, but we're also seeing that it's been just this
1319560	1325160	ongoing thing in general, in the public of offer this promise, offer this, say this, say that,
1325160	1329800	and then not being able to pull through or doing the exact opposite. And now,
1330680	1334680	you know, there's consequences to pay. And I really want to start seeing these consequences
1335400	1340600	being, this is what I'm thinking of. I want to see them being held to the consequence.
1340600	1345400	Yeah. I definitely want to see other CEOs looking at this situation going like, Oh,
1345400	1348920	better make sure that doesn't happen here. I want them all to shit their pants or remember
1348920	1357800	who pays their bills. That's another way to put it. No. Well, you know me, if I can be blunt about
1357800	1363880	it, I will. What's that? Let me ask this question before we get into our gaming weeks. And it's kind
1363880	1368120	of a follow-up to something that came up on Bobby Blackwell's show tonight. Because of course,
1368120	1372200	you know, as I mentioned at the top of the show, he's on live before us here at the voice of
1372200	1377480	geeks network. Now, Bobby was talking about some of his highlights from the year of various sorts.
1377480	1381240	I won't spoil everything. I won't talk about categories and stuff, but one game that he
1381240	1386120	talked a little bit about was half-life Alex. And I thought it was kind of interesting because he
1386120	1394120	said half-life Alex, you know, and this is one way you can look at it. Absolutely. Half-life Alex
1394120	1398520	is basically half-life three. This is it. This is half-life three. This is the game
1398520	1404440	that folks have been waiting for. This is half-life three, but they knew they could never
1404440	1411080	live up to the hype that everybody had in their minds built up for half-life three, especially
1411080	1417080	when you add that additional twist or challenge of the fact that it is VR only based, which limits
1417080	1421800	your audience and all that stuff. Because they knew they could never really live up to that
1421800	1427640	half-life three hype. Instead, they tailored the message and made it half-life Alex. And he kind
1427640	1434040	of made a little joke in there about how cyberpunk, you know, didn't think to do the same thing or
1434040	1437560	something along those lines. And it did kind of, you know, even though I think he just kind of
1437560	1443320	said it as a one-off comment, it did kind of make me think, huh, you know, yeah, in many ways what
1443320	1452120	happened with cyberpunk was kind of a victim of its own hype machine. Like, what if they either
1452120	1457240	A, had just announced the game a lot later, which maybe the industry wouldn't really allow them to
1457240	1464120	do, or B, just said, you know what? Cyberpunk 2077, unfortunately, it just wasn't meeting our
1464120	1469560	expectations. So we've decided, can it? But guess what we have coming out for the PlayStation 5,
1469560	1478760	PC and Xbox Series X, no mention of prior consoles. We've got this game, Cyber Intruder 2078 is coming
1478760	1485800	and it's going to be awesome. I don't know. Loki, you're the only one out of us that's
1485800	1490360	actually played the game. And I think you've enjoyed the game. Did they set themselves up to
1490360	1496200	fail with the hype or what? I don't know if they, I mean, it was a pretty hyped game. I
1496200	1501880	just think they had difficulty with releasing on so many platforms at once. I mean, I knew that
1501880	1505560	everything nowadays that gets released is a little bit buggy, but this was like kind of
1506920	1512680	an extraordinary case of bugginess. I mean, a Bethesda level of bugginess, if you will,
1512680	1517720	probably even a little bit beyond that. It just, it obviously needed more time. It'll get better
1517720	1524760	as it goes along, but it's just, this is just the trend in gaming nowadays that companies release
1524760	1529240	these half finished products that meet a deadline. And then they keep promising that they're going
1529240	1535320	to patch it after the fact, or keep fixing it or adding on to it. We'll just have to see if
1535320	1541800	it actually happens. And some more comments from chat I think are really good and worth reading
1541800	1547000	here. SSG100Matt says, Cyberpunk had trouble living up to the hype, much like No Man's Sky
1547000	1551640	did at first. Hopefully they can turn it around like No Man's Sky did. I imagine they will.
1551640	1555400	I also imagine they will. I don't think they have a choice at this point, but I think that was
1555400	1560200	probably always in their long game plan, because we know there's Series X and PlayStation 5 versions
1560200	1564840	that are still coming, like specific to those, not running on backwards compatibility. And of course,
1564840	1569240	of course they've got DLC in the works and things like that. So there's going to be opportunities
1569240	1574360	for them to relaunch the game with a game of the year edition. I mean, look at the playbook for
1574360	1579720	Witcher 3, right? That game has been selling for years and years and years, and they have a long
1579720	1584440	game on how they're going to continue to sell the game. And it's on Steam sale right now,
1584440	1590600	by the way. Of course, of course. The Winter Sale, of which I've bought some games. And this is
1590600	1597400	really important too. Dartetsuya in chat says, To me, Cyberpunk 2077 at least lived up to the hype.
1597400	1602440	I'm probably close to 60 hours in and I can't get enough. I just absolutely love the setting. And I
1602440	1606200	think that's something important for us to keep in mind as we're talking about all of this, is that
1606760	1611160	the problem really is, is that there's a lot of people out there looking at this going,
1611160	1616840	what the hell's the problem? The game is fine. But then there's other people sitting out there
1616840	1624520	on their base PlayStation 4s, or maybe that don't buy Bethesda games in the past or buy
1625400	1631480	other buggy games that are looking at this going, what the hell is this? I waited eight years for
1631480	1638840	this. And so there's a real disparity there between the groups of where people's expectations
1638840	1643000	were at. And I think that's why the gaming industry is going to really have a conversation
1643000	1648520	after this fact about, you know, where's the appropriate place to put expectations? I think
1648520	1653640	that'll be very interesting. I don't know. Anything else you guys want to add to that?
1655400	1660520	All right. I knocked over my webcam. You knocked over your webcam. We're going on a ride.
1660520	1666040	All right. Just because I'm screwing with crap on my desk. All right. I'm a professional. Should
1666040	1672600	I hide that until you fix it there? Tell me. Nah, I don't care. Okay. All right. Anyway,
1674760	1680680	Meech in chat, one more comment here. People are so ready to give up the moment shit don't pan out
1680680	1685800	the way they want because they're so instant gratification. Let me ask one more question.
1685800	1689480	Think that the truth. One more question that came to mind since, you know, we've been saying
1689480	1694760	Bethesda gets away with it. Bethesda, Bethesda, and all this stuff. Well, sometimes they get away
1694760	1698040	with it. I don't know. The reception of Fallout 76, I don't think it was exactly what they were
1698040	1702440	looking for. But something- Oh no, they got nailed for that one. Well, here's something very
1702440	1708760	important. Bethesda is no longer, Zenimax is no longer, you know, who owned Bethesda, is no longer
1708760	1717320	an independent thing. Zenimax is part of Microsoft. Microsoft just had the audacity, and I mean that
1717320	1723480	in a good way, actually. Microsoft had the audacity to bump back their biggest first-party
1723480	1729800	title that was supposed to be the highlight of Xbox Series X and S, Halo Infinite, of course.
1730920	1737560	They just bumped that back an entire year, if not maybe more at this point, because it wasn't
1737560	1743480	living up to the quality they expected. Could that be the future of Bethesda now that they are
1743560	1750520	a Microsoft property? What do y'all think of that? Are our joke days of Bethesda done because
1750520	1755720	they're gonna maybe have a different standard now that, you know, different people are at the
1755720	1766280	helm of the organization? Namely, Phil Spencer. We will see, but I think, well, possibly. So,
1767080	1773320	it would have, I would imagine that if they're building a brand new game, like a new,
1773880	1780120	obviously the new Elder Scrolls game in Starfield, it's probably going to be running on a completely
1780120	1786360	new engine. I would hope, I hope they're not repurposing the old engine for that. So that,
1786360	1789960	I think that was a lot of the problems that they had, especially with like Fallout 76,
1789960	1793720	is they were using like some of the original engine that they were running,
1794520	1801160	you know, Oblivion or even, I think stuff even older than Oblivion on, and it just kind of adding
1801160	1807720	to it and repurposing it for things it was never meant to do. And so you were running into like
1807720	1814760	bugs that have been in place since those early games. And so I would hope that they're going to
1814760	1821240	start fresh with a new engine to build these new games, because I can't see how these older engines
1821240	1829320	would support something that massive in that detail. So hopefully that will be behind us.
1830360	1834760	We'll see though, when it comes out. Cause I mean, I don't know.
1835320	1839240	All right. Let me read a few more comments from chat. Deja Rama S says, you know,
1839240	1844440	CD Projekt RED basically abandoned Xbox One PlayStation 4 platforms for next gen.
1844440	1848760	That and upper management demanding a release. It is what it is. And, you know, Rama, I think
1848760	1853000	a lot that played into that is that there was probably so many pre-orders on that platform that,
1853000	1857960	and I think this is what the issue really ultimately boils down to is that CD Projekt RED
1857960	1863320	probably knew they should walk away from those platforms and focus on PC and the next gen,
1863320	1867640	because things had come so far along in the eight years, but somewhere along the way,
1867640	1874680	somebody in that boardroom said, but we have X number of pre-orders on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
1874680	1880200	If we cancel that, we lose all that. And so somebody made the decision and here's the problem.
1881320	1885560	Somebody made the decision. Well, we can't have that release it anyway.
1886600	1888920	That is the problem. It was all down to money.
1888920	1895160	Yes. I mean, just one less little thing. As much as we like to say that some of these
1895160	1899560	big companies, they care about the gamers. They want us to have fun. They want us to have a good
1899560	1907400	quality product. For a lot of them, it's all about the bottom line. How do I profit off of this?
1908680	1914120	And that's it. A few more comments here. I want to read a comment from Mimsie94 who says,
1914120	1918280	I don't know if my view on games helps. Hey, every gamer has a voice. All are welcome,
1918280	1922360	but I'm easily pleased with most games and Cyberpunk is a great game to play in my opinion,
1922360	1927080	but I can only play the playthrough since I can't own any of the gaming systems, but fantastic to
1927080	1932360	watch the playthroughs. Well, don't forget, even if you don't have the newest and greatest systems,
1933320	1938520	Stadia is trying to target folks like you. And that is another way that a lot of people are
1938520	1943640	enjoying Cyberpunk is through that where you don't necessarily get it on Stadia.
1943640	1947880	Yeah. Right. Like again, and we kind of got into this last week or the week before is like
1947880	1954440	Stadia's best use case just happened and Google had nothing to do with it.
1955400	1960360	Like, it's like this literally fell in their fucking lap and it's a great thing for them.
1960360	1967320	I got my free Stadia. It arrived. Like, why the hell not should I not try it on that? I mean,
1967320	1972040	I just got a bunch of games actually because they did a bunch of freebies if you have Stadia Pro.
1972040	1976200	And then I want to get one more comment here from Bobby Blackwolf because this kind of speaks to all
1976200	1981640	the, you know, buggy and open world and things we were talking about before, who says, the issue is
1982520	1988280	that a lot of bugs are really the byproduct of a huge open world game. Yes, QA can find a lot
1988280	1994200	of things, but there will always be stuff found by players once you let something out. And I'm
1994200	2000920	going to say something very blunt. Why not? It's the holidays. Uncle Rob's going to tell it like
2000920	2010200	it is. This is how you can tell the difference between a podcast, a news organization, a Twitter
2010200	2015480	account, a group. This is how you can tell the difference. A group that is saying,
2015480	2022120	didn't they test this game? What's happening in QA? What are they doing there? Does CD Project
2022120	2028440	Red even have a QA? The people that are saying that haven't been following this industry a very
2028440	2033720	long time or don't have insight into this industry. Because you'll notice that phrase
2033720	2038600	hasn't left any of our mouths. And most of you in chat either, none of you have been blaming QA on
2038600	2044280	this. Because I think those of us that have been participating at this table for a while now know,
2044280	2048760	this isn't the fall of QA. Of course, there's a QA department. Of course, QA told them it was wrong.
2048760	2055160	Go back to what I just said. And this whole thing is that they knew they had pre-orders on Xbox One
2055160	2061320	and PlayStation 4. QA tells them it's broken. Boston Boardroom says, doesn't matter, release
2061320	2069560	it anyway. And that's a story that happens a lot. I liken that to some of those sort of sci-fi
2069560	2079560	movies about, oh, we've done this magic food item, but it will give 0.1% of people rabies.
2079560	2083000	I'm just throwing that out there. And they released it anyway. And then you have a rabid
2083000	2087560	population. And then the army has to go in and fight them. And then Will Smith saves the day.
2087720	2089480	They're just rabid fans of the product now.
2093240	2097720	All right. And then Bobby had another follow-up comment here. Oh, yes. Because I like this. I like
2097720	2102920	this little saying here. Bobby says, one of my sayings in software development is that the moment
2102920	2109320	you make something idiot-proof, the world will just build a better idiot. I kind of think that
2109320	2114520	goes hand in hand with the saying, hacker's gonna hack, right? Because that kind of goes... Because
2114600	2118360	when we talk about oblivion and if it doesn't work, somebody else is going to fix it. And the
2118360	2122600	whole thing, people will figure out ways to work around something like that. Kind of in some ways
2122600	2127800	goes hand in hand with that. I did not call hackers idiots for the record. I'm just saying
2127800	2133080	there are comparisons between those two sayings. I just like the term that you can learn to fail
2133080	2139640	in new and exciting ways. There is that too. Yes. All right. This saga is far from done. So I'm
2139640	2144200	sorry if you didn't want to hear anything about cyberpunk. Too bad because this story is not
2144200	2150360	going to be done. But think of it this way. This is, again, going to have an impact on the industry.
2150360	2156680	What happens here, others are watching. So let's see where this path leads us. I think it's
2156680	2164840	interesting. And what's interesting, I was very like, eh, on cyberpunk. There are hundreds,
2164840	2168760	thousands of games that released in a calendar year. I don't have time to play everything.
2168760	2172520	So I was like, I'll get to cyberpunk when they have the game of the year
2173080	2176840	edition with all the DLC included and all that stuff. I'll get to it then. That's still where my
2176840	2183400	mind is at. I don't need a day one. And I'm not into a game like that too much. I'm still waiting for
2183400	2190920	Mass Effect. My Mass Effect remaster. Yeah. But I can also still look at it and go, but this shit's
2190920	2196280	fascinating. What's going down here legally, you know, and all that. All right. Anyway,
2196280	2200600	let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week,
2200600	2203800	whether it was cyberpunk or not. Dar Sakura, how was your gaming week?
2205000	2209000	I played Animal Crossing because what else do I do? I play Animal Crossing.
2210520	2217240	We had another good run on Pop and Twinbee. I fucking love Pop and Twinbee. It's like one of my
2217240	2224040	favorite old Super Famicom games. And I've had ROMs of it and everything. So I really, really,
2224040	2228680	really have been playing a decent bit of Pop and Twinbee, but I think I've been doing it under
2228680	2237080	Dan's account by accident. We actually are talking about getting another pinball. We've
2237080	2240360	kind of floated around if we're going to get a Black Knight Sword of Rage.
2242840	2250840	Believe it or not, we have the animated topper for Black Knight Sword of Rage without owning the
2250840	2255720	table because we bought it for like 500 and something bucks. And now I don't think you can
2255720	2261480	find them for cheaper than like 150. Why did I say 150? 1,500?
2261480	2265240	I was like, that doesn't sound like a deal, Jamie. Okay.
2266760	2273400	And also my World Cup soccer is going to be coming home. Dan's buddy Brian has been doing some work
2273400	2279480	to it. So I'll get to play my baby again because I love my World Cup soccer pinball. Other than
2280040	2289480	that, I want to come over and play pinball when I get the jab.
2291080	2297320	Actually, Rob, if you're getting regularly tested, I'll submit another test. And if everyone's
2297320	2301480	clear, you can come over and play pinball. You need to send me the info on your thing
2301480	2305560	you use because I always have to go get my nose violated.
2306520	2310520	Well, mine is a nose violation, but I get to violate myself.
2310520	2311880	We'll talk offline.
2311880	2317480	Yeah, we'll talk offline. Basically, my work doesn't do quest. So at any rate,
2319080	2322600	okay, Mimsie, you and I are going to have to talk because you're one of my pinball peoples now.
2323240	2335400	So my house is full of pinball. But at any rate, I've got a few things on my downloads now.
2335480	2338360	I actually bought some stuff off my Steam wishlist thanks to the sale.
2339160	2349960	So like I just picked up a Gencho Night Festival, which is a little platformer that just looks like
2349960	2358040	it was super fun. And I'm also I got what became of Edith Finch on Switch, so I'm going to be
2358040	2361160	playing through it there. It's a good game. It's a really good game.
2361160	2367720	I'm also getting Umehara Kawase, which is another kind of interesting platformer
2367720	2377240	of a girl with a grappling hook. I'm still debating getting Resident Evil 3. But for
2377240	2384920	right now, there's just enough games out that like I'm also picking up right now the
2384920	2390040	Suicide of Rachel Foster because I love those narrative games. I've really kind of gotten
2390040	2394680	out of the kind of open world thing unless it's like more of a fantasy environment.
2396440	2404280	And I do, of course, Mass Effect. That's kind of like my speed of game. But I'm really,
2404280	2410200	really loving the narrative games where it may not seem like a game,
2412360	2417880	but it's got a story and it's really something that one can get into.
2418600	2423480	Oh, I'm about to talk about one, and I think it would be one that you'd be into for sure.
2423480	2428840	I'll get into it in a moment here. But those are absolutely games. We've had this discussion
2428840	2434840	before about the walking simulator and all that. But you know what? If you are to call the Black
2434840	2439720	Mirror episode on Netflix a game, which the name escapes me right now, whatever the name of that
2439720	2441560	game was in the episode. Bandersnatch.
2441560	2447640	Thank you, Bandersnatch. If that's a game, then these are certainly games. There's lots of
2448600	2455880	choice and things to go back and revisit. I guess I'll get into it in a minute. But I don't like
2455880	2460600	when people try to dismiss the narrative games. I really don't. They're games. They're games of a
2460600	2468680	different type. Look at Atari 2600 games. It was usually push button, go ping. There's the most
2468680	2475240	basic thing. Pong. Beep, boop, beep, boop. If that's a game, then why can't a narrative experience
2475240	2484760	be a game? Anyway. Yeah. But at any rate, I have a bunch of stuff that I just really want to sit
2484760	2490360	down. I have another game called When the Past Was Around that I want to sit and play. I finally
2490360	2496520	though bought... I have Wattam now that it's on Steam. And I'm going to be streaming Hive Swap
2497240	2504040	probably in the next couple of weeks. So there's stuff on my plate with plans to actually do stuff.
2504040	2510680	It's just right now the end of the year business. But I am going to be streaming Hive Swap Act 2
2510680	2516920	because in my heart of hearts, I am still a Homestuck. All right. Well, let's move on and go
2516920	2523080	to Loki. How was your gaming week? I tried working on my game most of the week. So I've been trying
2523080	2529720	to... Still trying to code something to do anime tiles. I was trying to do it the right way and
2529800	2534360	it's not working. Which I try to... Just a heads up, if you've been out for a few weeks,
2534360	2539640	we now know that Loki's game is a spiritual successor of shorts called To Pixel Poops
2539640	2543880	on the NES. Him and YYR had a big press announcement a couple of weeks ago. Anyway,
2543880	2548840	sorry. Yeah. Just to catch up the people who might be behind. Right, right, right. So I've been
2548840	2556680	working on that. So I'm doing what like plan C now in which it's going to be basically using
2557240	2561960	techniques that I already use to switch tiles out for when I do like the actual
2562920	2571240	pooping in the game. So that works, I know. So it's just not the most elegant way I'd like to
2571240	2577240	do it, but I'm going to try it and see if it works and how the performance is. And so this
2577240	2581720	is really my last attempt to get it to work because otherwise I've spent way too long on
2581720	2586040	trying to get it to work. I do want it to work because it looks nice when it does work.
2587000	2595000	It just takes a lot to get it to work. So that's when I'm finishing up hopefully this week.
2595000	2603640	And then I would like to have a demo available at some time soon. I would hopefully like to
2603640	2607720	get done before the end of the year, but we'll see. But that'd be kind of cool if I could do
2607720	2614760	that. But actual game playing. So I did play more Minecraft this week. I spent an unreasonably long
2614760	2621880	amount of time making an automated bee farm. Yes, with a bee statue over the top. So you can get
2625640	2632040	honeycomb blocks and honey bottles. So it's an automated bee farm. They go in there and they
2633720	2637880	make honey for you and it just automatically collects it. So that was kind of fun. It was
2637880	2641960	a relaxing thing to do. And then my kids have been trying to get me to play
2642840	2650360	more stuff with them with Minecraft. So I've been doing some stuff. My kid will make a level and
2650360	2655720	wants to do like a little scenario. And so we did that for a few hours. So it's been mainly
2655720	2660680	Minecraft this week. A little bit of Orna as I've been traveling around just taking over areas and
2660680	2668120	stuff like that. I wish I could take over more areas like just like out like if I could see it,
2668120	2671400	I should be able to take over it. But I know there's only a certain radius that you can do
2671400	2677000	that. So that kind of sucks. But I've just been playing a bit more of that. Still not leveling
2677000	2682040	up very fast at all. I'm still like 182. The leveling curve gets like exponential. It's kind
2682040	2686200	of like Pokemon Go in that regard. Even though we're talking about, oh, we're level 180, we're
2686200	2690840	level 100. It doesn't take that long if you're a little bit dedicated to get to three digit levels.
2690840	2696840	But then once you start hitting about level 180, the XP curve goes up exponentially and it takes
2696840	2702600	longer and longer for each level, for sure. Yeah. And you don't get new enemies until I think
2703400	2709960	every 25 levels. So you'll get them at 200. So it's going to be a while. So, yeah, it's just
2709960	2715400	been kind of grinding that a little bit. And that's about it. I didn't play any more cyberpunk
2715400	2721640	yet, although I probably will at some point. And I need to definitely go back to my Xbox Series X
2721640	2728600	because it's sitting there collecting dust. But yeah, so eventually get to that stuff. But I mean,
2729960	2736280	I can't think of any games in 2021 that I'm necessarily anticipating yet. So I've got time.
2737240	2744440	Okay. Mike gave me a week. So speaking of GPS based games, I've been playing a lot of Angers
2744440	2750120	this past week. I kind of took a break for a few weeks and maybe it's one of those things
2750120	2755160	where taking a break was good because it kind of got me motivated again. And I hit maximum level
2755160	2760600	in the game for the second time. So I got all the way to level 16, which is max level for the second
2760600	2767640	time. And so of course I pushed the button to restart for a third time. And I worked pretty
2767640	2771960	fast to get right back up to level eight because you have to be level eight in the game to use the
2771960	2776280	highest gear. So I kind of already had things planned out in my head. I was like, because they
2776280	2781640	have these things called apexes now, which are sold in the shop, but you get them free during
2781640	2785480	events and things like that. So I had like 10 or 11 of them built up. So I was like, all right,
2785480	2789640	I'm going to go downtown. I'm going to go to the cemetery. I'm going to just microfield the whole
2789640	2793960	thing fast and burn an apex. And I do it. And that's what I did. And I was back to level eight
2793960	2799480	within maybe two hours of gameplay. So I just, just, you know, thinking my strategy through on
2799480	2804760	how I was going to do it and it worked out. So that was my big GPS game nerd conquer thing of
2804760	2809000	the week. Um, but it's, I find that it's been kind of a fun thing to do because it gets me out
2809000	2815000	of the house. I can sit in my car, listen to podcasts or music or whatever, do some driving.
2815000	2820120	So at least I feel like I'm moving and it's safe. I'm in my little protected bubble, literal iron
2820120	2824760	bubble that's on the road and playing my little game and still getting to see things. So that's
2824760	2830360	kind of, I think why I've been kind of into it right now. Um, so other things that I've been up
2830360	2834200	to, uh, the game I was talking about with dark soccer. So I played a new game this week, uh,
2834200	2839560	because of Xbox game pass. I started playing a game called tell me why, uh, which came out,
2839560	2844040	I think back in September. Uh, it's an X, it's an Xbox game studios game. Yeah. I finally got
2844040	2847560	around to it. You know, just, it was like, Oh, I should play that. I was kind of looking for
2847560	2850440	something new to play and I'd heard a lot of things about it. A lot of people on Twitter
2850440	2855240	had spoken very favorite favoritively of it. And so I started playing it. Um, it is, it is
2855240	2860760	a narrative based game. It's a very story heavy based games. Uh, it, it involves a series of,
2860760	2866520	it involves twins and they have these kind of like special powers where they can kind of talk
2866520	2870360	to each other without actually talking to each other. Like, you know, that, that some people
2870360	2875000	kind of perceive about twins or, or maybe that really is a thing. I don't know. But, uh, that,
2875000	2878840	that kind of ends up being kind of central to the plot. Uh, I don't want to get too much into
2878840	2884040	the plot because I just kind of like started it right off the bat and I was really like taken
2884040	2890280	aback. I was like, Whoa, I didn't know this game was that fucking dark that quickly. Like it's,
2890280	2896920	it's kind of like, uh, I don't know if I want to say scary, but it's, uh, um, like, Oh, this is
2896920	2902040	heavy stuff. I think heavy stuff, I think is a good way to say it. Uh, and it's kind of starts
2902040	2906680	off right that way. And, um, you know, you just kind of then, then of course the story is just
2906680	2911720	kind of like peeling back the layers of an onion. It gets deeper and deeper and you kind of start
2911720	2916760	to learn about the character. What was, what was going on here? What was this thing? What did,
2916760	2921960	was she, was she, was she good? Was she not good? There's all these weird things going on. So, um,
2921960	2926680	yeah, unsettling is a good way to put it too. Um, dark soccer, I do think a game like this
2926680	2931240	would be up your alley. Um, there's been a lot of talk of this game as well. You may have heard
2931240	2937000	of this game because it focuses, uh, there's a lot of, um, uh, the, the, one of the twins,
2937000	2943880	um, is a trans man. So there's a lot of talk about, um, transgender in the game because it does
2943880	2950440	end up, um, be it's, it's kind of, how do I say this without it's, it's a plot device,
2950440	2958360	but not in poor taste. Like they, they actually, the trans man is voiced by a trans man actor.
2958360	2965320	They had consultants on the game to make sure they got it right. But that whole experience is
2965320	2971480	kind of integral to the plot. So I thought it was, it's, it's an interesting way to kind of,
2973480	2979640	I found it was really fascinating because since you are playing some of the game as, um, and now
2979640	2986200	I can't remember the character's names. There's Allison, Tyler, Allison and Tyler. That's it. So
2986200	2990760	Tyler is, and that's not really a spoiler. You find that out very, very, very, very, very early
2990760	2996520	on within the first 10 minutes, probably. Um, Tyler is, um, a trans man. And since you are
2996520	3006200	forced to play some of the game as Tyler, you get exposed to some of those awkward experiences where,
3006200	3011240	and there was a really, like, I'll just say it was a flat out like awkward thing that happened
3011240	3018600	is that you meet one of the villagers who knew you as a child when, you know, before, um, the,
3018600	3023640	before transitioning and all that. And there's that very awkward conversation that happens
3023640	3027400	about, you know, where the, the guy is kind of putting his foot in his mouth and it's,
3027400	3032360	it's one of those like, well, you got to forgive me because I'm older and we can't follow all your
3032360	3037480	new way. You know, that whole thing. So it was weird. Yes. But I'm ready to be pissed off,
3037480	3041000	but then I thought that's good. But you know what? I mean, not pissed off at the game,
3041000	3045640	but pissed off in game. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I get it. I get it. But I thought it was interesting
3045640	3054520	because that was deaf. That was definitely a way to illustrate an experience through the art of
3054520	3061960	video games without necessarily having to be beat over the head with a shoe with it. Does that make
3061960	3070760	sense? Like by even as awkward as that exchange was, I think it illustrated a very real thing
3070760	3074520	that I think a lot of trans people have been trying to say, this is, this is, this is why
3074520	3079640	we have challenges. This is some of the BS that we go through. And they were really able to
3079640	3086200	illustrate that through the game. And I thought that was really neat. So yeah, I think the game
3086200	3092360	is pretty cool. I'm not, it's in three parts and I'm like, I don't know how far I am because I
3092360	3097640	refuse to read spoilers on it. So I would guess I've got to be close to the end of the first part
3097640	3102760	because each part is only supposed to be like two or three hours. And I've, I swear to God,
3102760	3106840	I feel like I've been playing part one for three hours, but I'm also the type that's like,
3106840	3114360	I have to check every item and read everything and solve every puzzle. So maybe I'm just slow.
3114360	3115560	All the things.
3117400	3125160	So anyway, yeah, yeah. So, um, yeah, I saw, yeah, I, I thought that was a, a, a neat game and just,
3125160	3132280	I, I, but I will say, and I'll warn you the way I wasn't warned. The subject matter is a lot darker
3132280	3138040	than I was anticipating. And that's actually, that's nothing to do with, with the trans part
3138040	3143000	of it. It just happens to be that the character is, you know, a trans man and his twin sister.
3143000	3149400	That's just another element of the story. So. Yeah, it was, I, I, I, I want to finish more
3149400	3155560	before I absolutely say I recommend it or I don't recommend it. Um, but so far I'm feeling I, I,
3155560	3159480	so far I've enjoyed the first two, three hours I've played. So I feel like that's a leaning
3159480	3165720	towards a positive recommendation. So, well, I just bought it. So there you go. I mean,
3165720	3169240	I don't know if I'm going to get a chance to play it and I'm probably going to get yelled at,
3169240	3177400	but I bought it. There you go. Oh, very good point. See a Tiberian chat over Twitch TV slash
3177400	3183160	vlog network says it also has a lot about indigenous cultures in this fictional area
3183160	3187800	of Alaska. You're right. It gets into some of that as well. I don't think I'm like heavy,
3187800	3193160	maybe into some of those storylines and things yet, but I have noticed that for sure. There's
3193160	3197800	like decorations and things in the house that they come across and stuff like that. So, um,
3198840	3204360	I'm curious to see more of how that kind of unfolds and develops. So, um, yeah. So there's
3204360	3209800	that, um, if my shirt that I'm wearing on Twitch with Fennekin on it is any indication, of course,
3209800	3214760	I've been continuing to play Pokemon, uh, sword and shield, which Fennekin isn't in, but I've
3214760	3221240	been working on my decks, uh, in those games and I'm up past 300. I'm up to like 320 something.
3221240	3224920	I think in my short sword and shield decks. So I'm getting closer, I'm getting down. I did a
3224920	3231640	lot of trades with, um, Shane this past week. So like I got the Zastian in my decks and I got the,
3231640	3237640	um, the thing like, uh, you have to trade, um, Machomp to get Machoke or did I get that backwards,
3237640	3241000	but y'all know what I mean? You know, you have to trade certain things. So we did some of that.
3241080	3244840	And that was like, I had to check off like 12, 13 things off the list there. So that was,
3244840	3249560	uh, that was good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, yeah, I've been enjoying Pokemon.
3249560	3252680	I don't think I'm going to get back into Pokemon, uh, anytime soon.
3252680	3257800	You never, you know what? It just like, for me, it just fucking clicked one day. I just,
3257800	3261960	and I think I was talking about Pokemon go and Pokemon home and all of that just suddenly made
3261960	3267320	me go, well, you know what guys, I'm going to catch them all. I'm going to finally do it. I'm
3267320	3272760	going to go catch them all. And it's, it's a, it's a thing to do now that, you know, quarantine and
3272760	3276040	COVID and all that crap's going on. Um, and I'm trying to think if there's anything else in my
3276040	3280280	game a week, I feel like there's one other game. I played a little more destiny to, uh, still been
3280280	3285480	playing that, uh, joined a clan of Twitter people. Cause I guess our VOG network clan,
3285480	3291240	like officially got killed because of inactivity. Oops. Uh, so I joined a clan with Twitter people.
3291240	3297640	Um, and I don't remember, uh, what else notable that I did in that game yet. I think I still have
3297640	3302680	to do a fire strike and I'm nervous about being, uh, going in there to do all that thing. So
3302680	3307960	there's that. All right. Um, let's see, we're going to get into, so that's it for my gaming
3307960	3312360	week. Let's get into gaming news first, before we get to gaming news, I actually have a couple
3312360	3317640	like housekeeping things to talk about. Um, number one, and Bobby said this in chat, um, but I'll
3317640	3323000	reemphasize it here during our little housekeeping segment is that, um, next week we will still be
3323000	3327640	here during OLR. Um, we're not going to like hold the show or anything, but I should point out that
3327640	3334280	awesome games done quick. Um, the big charity event, uh, does start next Sunday. Um, and VOG
3334280	3338520	network's own Bobby Black Wolf is now a part of that event. So for the second time, he's going to
3338520	3342840	be one of the announcers during that event. And he went over the whole schedule on his show. And of
3342840	3350040	course in the moment, I can't remember everything. I know Devil May Cry 5 was one of the games,
3350040	3356200	uh, in there. Uh, and then he had, um, did he get the Kings? I can't remember. He says Wednesday and
3356200	3359720	Friday night. Thank you. Wednesday and Friday night. Sorry. When I'm put on the spot, I can't,
3359720	3363800	I just go blank. Um, but he's actually gonna be doing some of the hosting. So that's exciting.
3363800	3367720	Thank you. Devil May Cry 3, Yoshi's Island and Yakuza 6. That's it. Thank you. Thank you. Those
3367720	3371880	are the games he's going to be hosting. So we'll be checking that out Wednesday and Friday night.
3371880	3380040	Um, but, uh, I, that all starts on Sunday. So check it out. Um, remember it's about the charity.
3380040	3384440	So if you're going to donate to try to get Bobby Black Wolf to read your shout out and you can
3384440	3390760	listen to his show for more details on how that works. Um, but, um, just like I've learned that
3390760	3397080	I can't say Mr. Smoosh donated 50 bucks because the screeners don't know what Mr. Smoosh is. And
3397080	3401960	so they assume it's porn, which they have to do. They have to do. So I'll have to take a different
3401960	3407800	approach, um, next time. So maybe you could do Mr. Smoosh, the cat. Yeah. I think that's what I'm
3407800	3411720	going to do is next time. Well, I shouldn't say this so openly as I'm trying to surprise Bobby,
3411720	3416600	but I'll say me and my cat, Mr. Smoosh are watching. And I say, keep up the good work.
3416600	3424200	And Mr. Smoosh says meow meow and that maybe something like that. Yeah. My bowl is empty.
3424200	3433320	Feed me. So anyway, she for once is not in here harassing me. You could check that out. Uh, Bobby
3433320	3437080	has more details on all of that. If you want some insight on how all that works, that's all on his
3437080	3440680	show, the Bobby Black Wolf show. So check that out during awesome games done quick. Um, another
3440680	3446920	housekeeping thing, this, this kind of, cause this is the last show of 2020, right? So next week,
3446920	3451800	we're going to go into 2021. And you know, I was watching a friend of mine was doing a Twitch
3451800	3456840	stream, somebody who, who watches, um, the, the stuff here at a VOG network. I'll say it was act
3456840	3461960	deaf. I was watching a stream of his and, um, you know, kind of the subject came up about how
3463400	3467000	this show has been going for 18 and a half years. That's a very long time.
3467000	3472120	There's not a lot of shows that do something like that. And, um, this has been a year that's
3472120	3477320	really old record. This has been a year that's really challenged us in many ways, right? Like,
3477320	3482680	you know, that I pride this show on, you know, cause people ask like, how have you kept the
3482680	3486680	show going on so long? How do you guys find the motivation for the show? And my answer has kind
3486680	3490360	of always been, well, you know, Dark Soccer, Logie, myself, it's kind of our excuse to get
3490360	3494200	together every week. We get together in person and we, you know, get to hang out. We do this
3494200	3497960	little show and people listen and it's a good time. And I think we've kind of been writing
3497960	3504600	that energy, but 2020 and all of its events have really kind of made us rethink some of that
3504600	3508920	because I've always kind of sat here and gone, we're not going to go to an all virtual show
3510200	3516680	because that's every other podcast does that. We only got a special thing, lol. 2020 had other
3516680	3520840	plans in store and we've gone to a virtual format. And I would say for the most part, it's worked.
3520840	3525160	Now this isn't me about to announce that like, we're going to virtual forever or anything like
3525160	3530200	that. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that I don't know. Nobody does. Cause we don't know
3530200	3534360	where these roads are leading into 2021. We hope, you know, there's light at the end of the tunnel
3534360	3543160	and all that. But I think it's really cool that 2020 threw these curve balls at us. And we were
3543160	3547640	able to kind of rise up to that and keep this show going. And that, of course, that's not just me.
3547640	3552520	That's huge. Thanks to Dark Sakura and Loki as well. I mean, Dark Sakura, shit. She might've
3552520	3557960	had COVID in those early episodes. Like not to make light of it, but you documented it.
3557960	3563160	But my blood test says I didn't. But then again, they're also like,
3563160	3567880	oh, and half of the people don't develop antibodies and I'm like, thanks bitch.
3567880	3575080	Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, and then I had it, I had it twice or it was really pneumonia.
3575080	3580440	And we know one of the guests we bring on this show all the time, Shane had COVID. He said that
3580440	3585720	on the show. It's not a secret. And I talked about that because I just went to visit him.
3585720	3589880	I was basically exposed now to get a test and I was negative and all that. But I mean,
3589880	3594120	obviously that whole issue has hit close to home here at OLR one way or another.
3594680	3598840	I've lost two friends this past year. Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. I think, I think
3599720	3605960	if we don't all know somebody directly, we know somebody who's been impacted. I can certainly say
3605960	3612120	that for sure. And I almost didn't get to see my dad before he died. I mean, yeah, he's in Alabama,
3612120	3619160	3000 miles away. But when his test came back negative, one of the nurses pulled some strings
3619160	3626760	for my sister and got him a private room and said that, that she and my mother, I mean, my mom and
3626760	3633800	dad had been divorced since I was, you know, nine months old, but but my mom was in there too. And
3633800	3641160	they let them in to have two one hour sessions. And the first session was when dad woke up enough
3641160	3648440	to, they actually took him off the morphine long enough for him to see me on the phone and wave and
3648440	3656360	try to say something. And then the next time I saw him on a phone stream, he was dead three hours
3656360	3665240	later. So and I almost didn't get that because of COVID. But, you know, his test came back negative
3665240	3669720	and they pulled some strings. Well, thank gosh, you got that at least. I mean, obviously that's a,
3669720	3674200	you know, terrible scenario. And I'm sorry that that happened. But, you know, at least there was
3674200	3679400	that little light that like, at least you got a chance to, you know, communicate in one way or
3679400	3684200	another. So that is far more than a lot of people have gotten. That's right. One of my friends right
3684200	3691880	now, her aunt had a stroke and can't be seen by anybody. That was my dad. That was my dad this
3691880	3699080	summer had that. Her aunt went nonverbal and half paralyzed. So there's no one who can be there with
3699080	3706680	her and help her with her affairs or help with consent or anything. So, you know, and all these
3706680	3712680	people who are like that one Karen that they had in that was CVS or something arguing about not
3712680	3718920	wearing her mask. I can't those people. I can't even watch those videos anymore. I just can't
3718920	3724840	with something hard and sandpapery. And my dad made a virtual full recovery for the record.
3724840	3728520	He got very lucky in that regard. So thank you. I'm really happy about that. Thank you,
3728520	3734440	everybody who is thinking through the good guy. Yeah, well, he does have some lingering things
3734440	3739400	like he clears his throat a lot more. I know it's a weird thing and he coughs. So we're always kind
3739400	3745640	of like, is it the COVID? Is it COVID? But it's not. It's just some weird lingering thing that's
3745640	3750840	kind of sitting there. You know what I mean? So anyway, let me get you some more positive vibes
3750840	3756200	from our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network where SSJ100 Matt says, I would like to say thank
3756200	3761880	you for all the vog hosts for getting us through this crummy year of 2020. Well, thank you so much
3761880	3765720	for saying that, because honestly, you know, I can't totally speak for dark soccer and Loki,
3765720	3773160	but I know for me, the reverse is true for me, like you guys being here on Sunday night gives
3773160	3776920	me some and throughout the week on the podcast and all that your feedback, emails, tweets and
3776920	3781720	all that. It gives me something to look forward to throughout this shithole of the year. You know
3781720	3789080	what I mean? Right. Like it gives me a sense of at least I got this one thing I can look forward to,
3789080	3795080	you know, happy hour at Chili's. Nope. Don't get that. But at least I've got happy hour at OLR,
3795080	3801480	you know? So exactly. It's given me that. So thank you guys for that. I really, really give us life
3802280	3808280	for sure. For sure. Okay. Um, let's get into, let's get into the video game news. We're really
3808280	3811800	here for it. But I just kind of wanted to acknowledge that is that like, despite the fact
3811800	3816440	that we had a shitty year, we've had some curveballs. We did something I said we were
3816440	3823480	never going to do. Not that that's ever happened on OLR before. And we and we made it and we're
3823480	3828120	okay. So and big thanks to dark soccer and Loki for navigating these tricky waters. Of course,
3828120	3833480	I couldn't do it without you guys. Because people say, how have you gone for 18 years? And it's the
3833480	3840360	it's it's all of us. It's not just one of us. We've all done it, you know? Yeah. So and it's
3840360	3846920	it's our thing. Although I really do think maybe we should contact Guinness. Maybe is is perfectly
3846920	3850520	normal. And this goes back to the original point I had been talking about with Act F.
3850520	3857720	It is perfectly normal for shows to rotate hosts and have new people. And, you know,
3857720	3861800	somebody gets burned out. So somebody new comes in or somebody else gets an opportunity. Somebody
3862200	3866760	new comes in. Look at the look at the view, for fuck's sake, which is probably been going
3866760	3872360	about as long as this show. How many women have been on that show? A ton, right? And there's lots
3872360	3877720	of podcasts out there where that's the case. But then and I was telling Act F, we're the weird ones.
3878440	3882520	We're the weird ones because we haven't changed in 18 and a half years. And I wouldn't have it
3882520	3890680	any other way. Rotate right now. This chair spins. Yes. Coming to you next week, your new co-host
3890680	3898040	Sabol is going to be hosting the show. Okay. Forget it. All right. Let's move on. Let's get
3898040	3900920	into video games. That's what we're here to talk about the gaming community. Loki,
3900920	3906600	give us some news, please. So we talked about one of the frustrations before with the PlayStation 5
3906600	3911560	was playing some of these games that you may own. You're not sure which version of the game you're
3911560	3917000	actually loading up and playing. I think we're like Spider-Man, Destiny and stuff like that.
3917000	3920360	There was issues where you have to download multiple copies and stuff like that. Well, now,
3920360	3926120	thanks to an update, they have a brand new confirmed game version pop up that happens
3926120	3931800	when you load a multi-generation game that allows you to choose to play the PlayStation 4 version
3931800	3938520	or to switch to the PlayStation 5 version. Which definitely helps with the confusion there and
3939400	3944440	why you would ever choose to play the PlayStation 4 version for whatever reason on a PlayStation 5.
3945080	3949560	I don't know, but it does. They're giving you the option to do that, but at least it kind of
3950520	3956760	eliminates that confusion that may happen with that. So that's kind of nice. I don't know if
3956760	3962280	that necessarily prevents you from having to install multiple versions of a game, but
3962280	3966040	if they have something similar, if they have something similar like that on the storefront,
3966040	3970200	you know, the pick which version you want to install, that'd be pretty helpful as well.
3971000	3976840	PS5 owners, do you guys have insight on that? Like, did this fix the installs both issue?
3976840	3980680	Because even Bobby's kind of pointing out, I had a monologue about this issue. No Man's Sky
3980680	3985640	defaulted to the PS4 version when I put the disc in. And yeah, of course, why do I want to play
3985640	3990200	the old one? I mean, there might be a reason why you want to go back to the old one, maybe a
3990200	3996200	feature, I don't know, something. But for the most part, people want to play the new one. That's true
3996200	4001320	in the Xbox world, that's for sure. It is still a work in progress. Like the article is talking
4001320	4007640	about that, you know, it didn't it worked in Destiny 2, but you didn't see the pop up in
4007640	4014200	Watchdog legions only until they went to manually install the upgraded PlayStation 5 version. Did
4014200	4021480	they get the warning to play the PlayStation 5 version versus the PlayStation 4? So I guess,
4021480	4027720	no, it does not, you know, address the multiple installs, but at least they'll know when you're
4027720	4033240	playing the wrong version. They really should just have an option to download which version you want,
4033240	4039240	or just, you know, hey, it's a PlayStation 5. You know, I'm upgrading to the PlayStation 5 version,
4039240	4044120	you know, once that's available, and then, hey, would you like to install the PlayStation 4 version?
4044760	4049080	You know, that would be nice to have that option on there so that you're not filling up your very
4049080	4055800	limited hard drive. Bobby does point out No Man's Sky VR is only in the PlayStation 4 version,
4056360	4060520	so there's an excellent illustration. Sometimes the PlayStation 4 may have something that the
4060520	4065880	PS5 doesn't have yet. Sorry, Jamie. I guess that makes sense. If you're moving files, you know,
4065880	4071480	you have, do you want to replace this? Do you want to copy? Yeah, so they have the choice. Yes,
4071480	4076280	right. Yeah, but why doesn't the PlayStation 5 version have VR? I mean,
4079320	4084760	great question. Well, do you want it to be pretty or do you want VR? I mean,
4084760	4089400	pick one. Well, PS5, we all know. That's not necessarily true. Joking, joking, joking.
4091240	4097720	Just like, you know, with, you know, anything, even like with the PlayStation 4 Pro and stuff,
4098440	4104360	they had options where you can pick, and I'm sure the same is with Spider-Man and stuff like that,
4104360	4110600	where you can pick multiple options. So like you have, you know, the ray tracing 60 FPS,
4110600	4115320	but your resolution slightly reduced, or you can do the full resolution of ray tracing,
4115320	4119640	but your frame rate slightly reduced, or you can just turn off ray tracing and just have,
4119640	4125400	you know, the 4K and, you know, 120 FPS or whatever the case may be with that. I don't
4125400	4129480	know the resolution on that. So why not just have that option there? It's like,
4129480	4134040	Hey, I see you're playing on VR. We're going to pipe this through a 1080.
4134040	4138440	And hold on. Cause I said something about it. Yeah. And this is, this is important too,
4138440	4143560	is that, and Bobby does say in chat, PSVR is not native to the PS5. It won't be native to
4143560	4148760	the PS5 until 2022. They decided the market for PSVR wasn't there to put it on the PS5
4148760	4152440	natively at launch, but they still support it in backwards compatibility mode, right?
4152440	4156200	Because we had those adapters that you could, you know, contact Sony and you get the adapters for
4156200	4163400	free. So, and even before Bobby said that I was going to say, um, there, we know PSVR is coming
4163400	4168440	to the PlayStation 5. It's just not here yet without the adaptor. Forget what it is.
4169000	4173640	And here's the thing, here's the thing as much as you might kind of tease Sony about the whole
4173640	4180600	weird VR issue in a sense, I kind of get it because imagine if they had put out PSVR with
4180600	4187480	the PlayStation 5, I mean, number one, PlayStation fives are hard enough to get. Can you imagine,
4187480	4192200	you know, now throw a VR unit into that and how, how hard is that going to be to get with the
4192200	4197720	production? And then on the other hand. Okay. So you're going to buy a $500 console. And then on
4197720	4203560	top of that, a $300, $400 headset, they're going to ask you to buy that day one. Hell no.
4203560	4206840	In a pandemic where people are unemployed. Yeah. Throw that out there too.
4206840	4212360	People aren't going to do it right. There will be some right, Bobby, there'll be some that would do
4212360	4218920	it. But I think for the most part, the market in general is not ready for that kind of ask
4218920	4224360	for another couple of years, because now when we come into 2022, it'll be, oh, okay. It's,
4224360	4227720	it's been two years since you've dropped your, you know, 500 on the console.
4227720	4233480	Now we want to sell you this three, $400, uh, VR headset or what have you. That's,
4233480	4238680	that's the long game Sony's planning. There's no way they could have asked you for 500 bucks twice
4238680	4241880	this year, whatever it is. Yeah. So that, that's what it really is. Anyway,
4241880	4244840	we kind of got off the path of what the story was about, but that's all right.
4247000	4254920	All right. So it it's, um, it's at least something right now, kind of a bandaid for the situation,
4254920	4259880	but it's not perfect. I don't know if the way they have everything set up right now is perfect
4259880	4264520	anyways, but obviously that's a problem that sort of goes away as time progresses.
4265240	4270520	PlayStation's also been very good about like huge firmware updates on their end. So like I,
4270520	4275000	and you know, I don't have a PlayStation five right now. I probably will get one next year.
4275000	4279080	Um, in fact, knowing that VR will be a thing in two years, I should probably get my PlayStation
4279080	4283560	next year, not wait two years to get it. I w I don't see myself being able to wait that long
4283560	4289240	anyway. Um, but, uh, you know, by the time I get it next year, I feel like the firmware is going
4289240	4292920	to be in a place where like, none of this is even going to be under discussion anymore.
4292920	4296120	Like it's going to be a lot smoother and all that good stuff.
4296120	4300360	We're waiting for next year anyway, before we decide which one we may or may not get.
4301320	4307080	I think there's a lot of people waiting for next year, period, just for everything, you know?
4307080	4308040	Yeah, pretty much.
4308680	4314120	Well, hopefully next year won't be the, you know, the, the, the floating dumpster fire this year
4314120	4320280	was. I honestly, truly don't think it will be. And then granted, I've been stupidly optimistic
4320280	4326280	throughout this whole thing, but I really do think like, for, for, for a lot of us,
4326280	4331240	uh, there will be a way out of this situation pretty, pretty soon. Well, relatively soon,
4331240	4336600	four or five, six months, it's going to be some other people and, you know, that are gonna,
4336600	4340600	you know, make this still a headline for a long time, unfortunately.
4340680	4341180	Yeah.
4341880	4344200	But I'll, but I'll be able to go to your house and play pinball.
4345400	4351560	Yes. Yes. A lot, all the pinballs are, well, I don't know, Dan's got stuff sitting on top
4351560	4354200	of my theater of magic right now, and I'm kind of mad about it.
4354200	4359560	Uh oh. All right. Let's move on. Let's talk about our next story, which has to do with,
4359560	4363320	well, this, this is something that's going to make people sad about 2021.
4364360	4365000	Not me.
4365000	4365500	Yeah, I know.
4367320	4369080	That's true. Not Jamie.
4369080	4369720	Not me.
4369720	4374360	There's a halo joke there. Okay. So this is about halo. Here's the deal. So a pretty big,
4374360	4380920	uh, bombshell was announced this past week, uh, where halo is going to be ending their online
4380920	4389800	services in December of 2021, meaning the halo games that were for the Xbox 360 original Xbox
4389800	4394200	actually already ended some time ago. You may or may not have remembered that, but the Xbox
4394200	4401880	360 games, and there's a lot of them, halo reach halo for halo three halo three ODST halo combat
4401880	4407160	evolved anniversary, Spartan assault, halo wars, all of those games being sunsetted,
4407160	4412680	but you have a whole year to enjoy what you've got. Okay. So December, 2021 is when those are
4412680	4421080	going away. Now some clarity on this. If I am playing the games in backward compatibility mode
4421080	4426760	on my Xbox one or Xbox series X, will I no longer to be able to play online? And the answer is
4426760	4431400	you will no longer be able to play online, even in backwards compatibility mode. Okay. Because,
4431400	4436600	uh, it is actually those three 60 games and their servers that are going away very similar to the,
4436600	4442280	uh, OG halo and halo two. When the original Xbox went away, you can, you can play a rich,
4442280	4447720	some original Xbox games, including halo on the series X. That's, what's pretty rad about the
4447720	4452520	Microsoft landscape right now, but you can't play it online. Sorry to say, because the servers are
4452520	4458520	gone and that's going to be the same case with these games. Now, what it won't impact is, and
4458520	4466520	here's, here's kind of the aha moment, the master chief collection, which includes halo, halo two,
4466520	4471800	halo three, halo four, and probably eventually pretty much everything I just named over there,
4471800	4475320	save maybe the tactical actually, no, I think one of those tactical games already in there,
4475320	4481880	but anyway, the halo master chief collection, that is not affected. That is technically an Xbox
4481880	4486040	one title. And so the servers fat. So if you want to play halo two, you have to do it through the
4486040	4489800	master chief collection, and that's how you're going to be able to do it moving forward. So
4490440	4495640	that's what you have as opposed to the master chef collection, which I consistently typoed it.
4496360	4504600	Um, now, uh, so that, you know, and considering a lot of Microsoft people are on game pass right now
4504600	4510360	and the master chief collection is with game pass, or you probably bought an Xbox one when
4510360	4515880	the master chief collection was included. I know I did, um, this, that, that's what you've got. And
4515880	4521080	that game is still going, uh, and no plans to end that there. So I do think it's, it's interesting.
4521080	4525560	I mean, there is that moment of, oh, memories with halo three and stuff like that, you know,
4525560	4530600	in some of these other games, but it's like, eh, is it halo three came out in what, like 2006?
4530680	4535160	Like it's a, it's an old game, you know, so I'm not terribly surprised.
4536040	4540360	Say they didn't support their titles. So yeah, this isn't an EA situation. What's that?
4541000	4547720	Remember when I got married and you came to my bachelorette party? Yes. Dan was having a halo
4547720	4555640	two land party. Oh yeah. Good times. Yeah. Um, with what we, they had like eight Xboxes hooked up
4555640	4563480	to eight CRT TVs in my house. And, and then I think halo three was just on the horizon
4563480	4568760	after that. So it's been a while. Uh, and Mimsie 94 in chat says they better try remasters,
4568760	4574040	those games, dammit for what it's worth. I think ODST is in the master chief collection now.
4574040	4577640	And that is, that is it. So the master chief collection is the remasters. You can play those
4577640	4584040	in 4k and that's on PC and it's on Xbox one and series X. Um, and if you have game pass,
4584040	4588280	it's, it's a big part of it. Cause obviously that's Microsoft's big thing. So yeah. I mean,
4588280	4592760	as, as much of a bummer as this news is, at least they're giving a full year's notice.
4592760	4597480	So you got a whole year to party hard. Um, and uh, also what I think is interesting,
4597480	4605320	what they list in phase two. So right now, as of December, 2020 halo Xbox three 60 DLC can still
4605320	4610200	be acquired at no cost. I think that's all kind of included in master chief collection anyway.
4610200	4613880	So maybe most people didn't notice this, but if for whatever reason you want to go play
4614760	4620520	the old 360 versions, the DLC is there for the taken now. So you get a whole year to party hard
4620520	4624920	and then they're going to pull the plug, but they haven't said exactly what day they just,
4624920	4631480	it's that vague December, 2021, but no sooner than one year from the date of the blog,
4631480	4637160	which was December 21st. So maybe for Christmas, that's what you get for Christmas. The plug's
4637160	4644120	going to get pulled. No, I would, I would assume, I would assume December 31st is just the nice
4644120	4650920	round day. They're going to pull the plug, but we'll, we'll see. So, all right. So, uh,
4650920	4656360	enjoy your halo three 60 while at last I was going to ask if anybody has any halo three 60 memories
4656360	4661400	they want to share Jamie, I know you don't Loki. Did you play, did you play other than having to
4661400	4666680	do halo as my classic game, but that wasn't even on the three 60. That's the original box. They
4666680	4673240	pulled that one. Like the most halo love one will get from me. I did other than red versus blue. I
4673240	4680600	love red versus blue. I played through halo three and I think we played a little bit of multiplayer
4680600	4687400	in our game room on halo three for a very short period of time. But, uh, that was about it. We
4687400	4693800	didn't really do that. I don't have a ton of experience with it. I played three when it first
4693800	4698360	came out for sure, because that was like the three 60 game that was being hyped up, you know,
4698360	4702920	and I loved halo two. So I was like, all right, I'm gonna play halo three. I remember not enjoying
4702920	4707800	the multiplayer as much in three. It's the game that every it's, it's the demo that everybody
4707800	4714520	bought crackdown for. Yes. Yes. There's that too. I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, yeah. So anyway,
4714520	4719160	um, good memories, but again, the master chief collection is still around. So halo ain't going
4719240	4725080	anywhere and then halo infinite's coming out. So eventually, so, um, and by the way,
4725080	4730200	just to explain to people who are new to the show, I don't really hate halo. I just don't enjoy halo.
4731000	4734680	It's an inside joke. That's it's a long, admittedly gotten out of hand. All right,
4735720	4740760	let's get into speaking of jokes that have gotten out of hand, dark soccer. This ain't a joke. This
4740760	4746840	is real and I'm excited. This is the console I want to get. It's on the top of my fucking list.
4747560	4754440	Um, what is the, uh, uh, KFC is doing a gaming console and it has a chicken warmer
4755080	4762040	and it's called the KF console. Yeah. Um, it's not a joke. I thought it was a joke.
4762040	4766120	I thought it was a joke too. It's more of a fancy case than it is the console.
4767640	4774440	Don't ruin my, my, my, my joy. I'm not saying that it's, it is in your side of the pool. Okay.
4774440	4784920	No, yeah. Fifth dream is the top of my bucket list. Um, at any rate, um, the, uh, KF console
4784920	4789000	is going to be coming out, I guess it's going to be out of the Kentucky fried console.
4789000	4796520	That's just so hilarious. Um, but at any rate, um, it is going, it's being made in a partnership
4796520	4804840	with a cooler masters, a PC maker. Um, it's going to be, uh, really a customized PC, um,
4804840	4810920	that will run 4k games with 240 frames per second, which is twice the frame rate of the
4810920	4816920	Xbox series X and PS five will have twice as much storage as those systems. It's going to be using,
4816920	4824360	um, an Intel, uh, nine, uh, extreme compute element that will house an Intel core. I nine
4825080	4833240	has a hot swappable GPU. Um, just it's, it's a PC. It's a, it's a fucking PC where, where if,
4833240	4840760	if there's anything, maybe KFC engineers built a Linux branded thing that will show up as the OS,
4840760	4846440	maybe something like that, essentially it's a PC, but at any rate, it will support ray tracing
4847240	4852840	VR and has a heated interior chamber for warming your chicken.
4854520	4858760	So when you play world of Warcraft, you can unironically say, at least I have chicken,
4862520	4866920	but it's, it's in the whole idea of heating. I wonder if that's just with the,
4867640	4874200	it's just going to run fan is coming from the CPU. It'll keep it warm. Here's what I want to know.
4874200	4878440	Why limit it to just a chicken warmer? Can you put other things in there? Like, like a baby,
4878440	4883880	like what else can go in there? It just makes me think that I'm going to have something I can play
4884760	4888760	I'm going to have something I can play games on that smells like fucking fried chicken.
4888760	4892360	And you know what? I'm enough of a rebel that I would put jolly be in it instead.
4892360	4896920	Is it like, I can't, I can't wait to see those controllers after everybody. Oh, I'm sorry.
4896920	4901480	Keyboard and mouse after everything. We'll have to get those, uh, the grease proof ones that they
4901480	4909400	had for a, what was it? Pub G is it, is it hot enough where it's like an easy bake oven or you
4909400	4917240	can make little cookies like in an easy bake oven. Can I bake in it? Can I, can I, can I bake
4917240	4923800	in it? But when my fan was busted on, on my computer, on my gaming PC, I used to actually
4923800	4928840	just leave my cup of coffee sitting on it. Cause it would stay warm. How did, how does the KF
4928840	4936280	console handle vape smoke? We need to, that's a question we ask in this day and age. That whole,
4936760	4943000	the vape thing was the dumbest of the dumb. Okay. So one thing though, I'm watching their
4943000	4946600	little commercial again and you know what was really awesome about this commercial
4947880	4953720	Mustang, someone's driving a Mustang. Um, you know, you gotta say, you gotta hand it to, uh,
4953720	4959240	Kentucky fried chickens branding and whoever's doing that whole stuff because they, they've
4959240	4964920	really not slowed down in 2020. I mean, they've got this, there was that lifetime movie that was
4964920	4971480	like completely unironically like Mario Lopez or whatever as the, the, um, as the kernel,
4971480	4978120	even though Reba McEntire is my favorite kernel, but Mario Lopez and some romantic, uh,
4978120	4984760	lifetime. Okay. So this thing, I'm looking at their mock-up of it on the little commercial
4985640	4992600	and I can't even right now. I mean, I so can't even that. I can't odd even. That's right. I
4992600	4998040	forgot. I'm finding the tweet to show people. Jopium three one three and Chad is saying they
4998040	5005800	had a dating SIM. I forgot about that. Oh yeah. I was, I have, um, the, the dating SIM it's, um,
5005800	5011160	I love you, Colonel Sanders. So then, you know what, but here's the thing. Here we are. We've
5011160	5016680	just given KFC like five, five minutes silver Fox daddy. So that's why I thought they're using
5017240	5022680	there. They're just exhausting the hot air through the top and the neck blows through event with
5023240	5029880	chicken. So I can imagine that would be so amazing because now you're going to have somehow hot air
5029880	5034760	has got to get in there. So that means that there is some sort of ventilation or holes in there,
5034760	5038840	which means if they're going to get through there, then chicken grease can get right through there
5038840	5046440	as well. So that's going to be a big old mess, but sure. Let's try it. I'm you know what we've
5046440	5050760	just given KFC like a free five minute commercial on this show though. So I will say I'm with Jamie
5050760	5056280	where I will unironically put my Popeyes chicken sandwich in the warmer. I have just take that
5056280	5065240	officially followed the KFC gaming Twitter. Get a free console, Jamie and a terrace of one now,
5065800	5075480	maybe they've got like a bunch of fun. They're UK based as well. They've got 208,000 followers. So
5076360	5082040	sure. Why not? SSJ 100 Mountain Chat says KFC tried and succeeded to outdo Arby's Twitter.
5082040	5086120	What is with like, and this was a thing that's been going for like three, four, maybe five years
5086120	5093000	now. These like Twitter brand on Twitter is like, it's gone off the rocker. Like it started with
5093000	5099000	Wendy's. That whole thing. You know, it started with Wendy's. It did start with Wendy's.
5099000	5107800	Steakham is on there now. Arby's though, you know, they've got one of us in their PR group who does
5107800	5114440	all this cardboard. I mean, it's all made from their like materials and it's, I'm living for
5114440	5119960	the Arby's Twitter. Now the KFC one is like, I don't know. I don't know. There's good stuff
5119960	5126520	coming out of it. And it's not just food chains now. Now Dionne Warwick is back and hey, I have
5126520	5130600	a lot of love for Dionne Warwick and her Twitter account is fucking fire. Her daughter taught her
5130600	5136280	how to Twitter. Good. Cause she's brightened up the Twitterverse. It wasn't her knees. Yeah,
5136280	5140520	her knees. Brittany, somebody. They did, they did, they did a sketch on Saturday Night Live and it
5140520	5143560	was, it's like one of the funniest things I've seen on Saturday Night Live in a long time where
5143560	5146760	she goes, can you put a hex on Wendy Williams? You look like a spooky bitch. Can you put a
5146760	5152680	hex on Wendy Williams for me? I died. It was great. And Dionne Warwick took the whole thing
5153640	5158360	to don't give a fuck. I love it. I'm loving the deal. And now here's the other big thing I just
5158360	5165320	saw this week. Eve six, the band from the nineties. Uh, but I would swallow my pride. I would joke.
5165320	5169800	I don't want to get shut down. I hate that song. Okay. But go look at their Twitter
5171320	5178280	because they have just, they have entered the town of no fucks Ville. And what was it?
5178520	5182280	He wrote a tweet earlier that would have been retweeted a billion times that said,
5182280	5186840	had a one hit wonder song in the nineties and can't get insurance or something like that. Like,
5186840	5193000	it's just, it's crazy. Uh, uh, pin tweet. Pretty sure we're going to be huge again.
5194680	5199400	Anyway. All right. Oh yeah, no. Okay. This is absolutely worth following. This was like my
5199400	5207480	kind of, of dry, but don't give a fuck humor. Right. All right. Anyway, let's move on. We got
5207480	5213800	from K we got from KFC to, to Twitter talk to the screensaver coming on my Mac, which I hope
5213800	5221480	didn't shut down the stream for once. Rob, I think we're good. We went from per instead of being,
5221480	5227640	uh, distracted by food. We were distracted from food. That is an OLR first.
5229880	5235000	Maybe the future is a scary place. We've jumped the shark, Rob. We didn't just jump the shark.
5235000	5240120	We blew it up. Let's move on. Let's get into some news, maybe a little, a little, a little
5240120	5244360	less scary. Maybe something that we can look forward to in 2021. Uh, Loki, what do you have
5244360	5253240	for us? All right. Um, yes. So, well, actually, um, the COVID relief bill just passed. Um, they
5253240	5259960	just signed it into law. So that's wonderful. And a part of that, of course, because they shoved the
5259960	5266520	whole, hold up, hold up. Did, did he actually sign it finally after all the actually signed
5266520	5272360	it finally about fucking time. Jesus. All right. So he's, that must've happened during the show.
5272360	5280280	Cause I missed that. Yeah. It just breaking. So, um, well, I guess it was raining on the
5280280	5285560	golf course. Wasn't it anyway? Sorry. Go ahead. You have to do something. I guess he got bored,
5286360	5295160	but I already did something today. Um, so with that, of course, so it wasn't just a COVID relief
5295160	5299560	bill. It was also their, um, spending bill for the, I can't remember what they call it. They're
5299560	5306120	like, it's basically this big on the most bill. And as part of the non COVID part of that, they
5306120	5311320	shoved a bunch of other stuff in there because it was getting fast tracked. And so it was like,
5311320	5319000	you know, 50,000 pages or five, five, 5,000 pages. Cause you know, with two hours,
5319000	5325800	you know, a few hours to actually look at it and 5,000 pages, it's hard to even see all the stuff
5325800	5333960	that they're voting, you know, yes on. But one of that was the case act, which is apparently a new,
5333960	5340520	um, bill that will propose establishing a new court-like entity within the U S copyright office
5340520	5349000	to resolve, uh, copyright disputes, which basically it's this, um, new group of, uh,
5349000	5355800	people that get to make, uh, copyright decisions, whether or not you are liable for a fines, uh,
5355800	5363640	up to $30,000. And then on top of that, if you are found, um, to be purposefully sharing
5363640	5371480	copyright material online, you could be liable, uh, for felony as well. Um, now granted,
5371480	5376920	this is not necessarily, I think, directed towards folks on Twitch and YouTube that are
5378040	5383480	accidentally putting copyright music in their, um, streams or something like that. This is more
5383480	5391880	of the sense of like, you know, running a pirate server. That's basically hosting movies and stuff
5391880	5399720	like that. It's more of the purposeful, you know, piracy that's out there. That's not to say that,
5400600	5409320	you know, stuff will get twisted in a way that overreach, but because I mean, look at the RIA
5409320	5414120	and what they've done in the past for folks, um, illegally downloading MP3s and stuff,
5414120	5419560	which really hurts nobody, but they'll find them, you know, so much money on that. So it is
5419560	5423800	unfortunately something that's already been passed, but is it necessarily going to affect
5423800	5430600	everyone? I guess we'll have to see what happens, but it's not, not a positive thing. Definitely.
5430600	5436760	It's siding with these corporations again, who really need no more protections. Yeah. I think
5436760	5443160	that, I think you kind of hit it when you say the intent behind it is for these, you know, big,
5443160	5448600	you know, the, the websites where it's like, you don't have HBO max. So you go to this website
5448600	5453400	to watch the pirated version of Wonder Woman 84 or whatever. Uh, and, and, uh, you know, that's,
5453400	5457160	that's, that's a no, no. Right. It's, you're not supposed to do that. That's, you know, piracy
5457160	5461160	laws. They don't have a lot of ways to enforce that. Although I I'm curious, how does that work?
5461160	5465160	Because most of those websites are overseas, but I digress. I guess that's something they'll have
5465160	5470600	to figure out. Um, but I think we're worried about how might the language and how might some of that
5470600	5477080	be used when the RIAA decides, Oh, we could make more money by shutting down Twitch, you know,
5477080	5481800	or something like that. I think that's, that's the worries there. And to like, kind of like,
5482520	5491800	so right now they do have, there is like felonies or it's like for other types of piracy or other
5491800	5499160	types of like, what this is basically doing is bringing the actual streaming part of it up to,
5499160	5505160	um, equal merits with the other types of piracy they're out there. So the penalties with those
5505160	5511560	is what it's basically doing. Cause before I think it was, they couldn't, um, enforce a
5511560	5515720	heavier penalty on people, which I don't know if they necessarily need to do in the first place,
5515720	5525320	but, um, yeah, so we'll see. I mean, it's just, it's basically, it says it's, it's illegal
5525320	5531400	streaming for commercial profit is what the bill is stipulating and says provide the public digital
5531480	5540680	transmission service that is primarily focused on legal streams. Um, I don't know, but we'll see.
5540680	5547240	I think it needs more revisions. I mean, that's not to say that they couldn't just do something
5547240	5552120	to revise this as well, but we'll have to see when the next administration gets in.
5553000	5558840	At least with politicians starting to get younger and younger, we're going to get more people in
5558840	5563720	there that get it. So to speak, I mean, obviously you have Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has done her
5563720	5567960	own stream and she was joined by Ilhan Omar. So those are two representatives there, right?
5567960	5572360	And then, you know, even if you're like, I don't like those extreme left or whatever,
5572360	5576520	even on the right, we know Justin Amash was watching. Although I think he's done now. I
5576520	5580120	don't think he sought another term, but still, you know, there are people that are on the right
5580120	5585560	or are watching what's happening. And, you know, I think I hate to say it, but maybe I don't. It's,
5585560	5590680	it's kind of an age thing I get, I think. And I think as we get more younger people that have had
5590680	5595000	Twitch be a part of their lives and so forth and have had YouTube and stuff, we'll finally start
5595000	5600440	to see laws that kind of answer that. But right now you got a lot of people in there that just
5600440	5605240	do what Hollywood wants them to do, even though it's in their best interest, but they don't give
5605240	5611240	a rat's ass about Twitch, you know? So that's, I think what it comes down to. I just realized also,
5611240	5617480	I opened Pandora's box by uttering the words Wonder Woman 84. Haven't seen the movie. Don't,
5617480	5621080	I haven't even seen the first movie. You guys, I watched so little TV and movies.
5621960	5628440	Apparently they had some anachronisms because there were two video games, two arcade games
5628440	5631240	that were in the arcade that didn't come out until like 86 and 87.
5631240	5637640	But there are very big opinions. One way I'm seeing people love it. I'm seeing people hate it.
5637640	5642840	I'm seeing people kind of like, it's just be respectful. Be respectful of everybody's
5642840	5647000	opinions y'all. It's just, I'm here. It's all over the board. I'm seeing it all over the board.
5647000	5650440	Whatever. I'm not a DC fan, so I'm not in a hurry to watch it anyway.
5650440	5655000	Yeah. All right. Yeah. I still haven't forgiven him for Batman versus Superman.
5655000	5658200	All right. That I did see and I wish I hadn't. Moving on.
5658200	5663000	Of course they, of course they greenlit a third movie because you know, it made some money and
5663240	5667800	it's just unfortunately like for me, like I've gotten out of the whole DC stuff
5667800	5673880	because I don't know, like they're trying to pull like what the Marvel is cinematic.
5673880	5677800	The Marvel Cinematic Universe seems to have more cohesion to it. And it's like, yes,
5678440	5683960	it's just going movie to movie. There's like, it's more interesting. Whereas the DC stuff,
5683960	5688600	it's just, it's misfire after misfire, which is unfortunate because I liked the DC characters,
5688600	5692520	but it's just, Oh my God, put the people in charge of the Marvel movies in charge of the
5692600	5697720	DC movies. And then we'll see like a night and day difference, but it's just not there yet.
5697720	5702280	How did it make? I mean, I, and this is not being being a hater. This is an honest question. How did
5702280	5705640	it, how did they know already it made enough money? Was, is that just based off international
5705640	5710840	box office and places where theaters are running? Um, or $4 million already.
5711880	5718040	Wow. And that's without HBO max. I think so. Okay. And you know, HBO. Okay. Then
5718040	5722440	nevermind question answered because, you know, HBO probably paid like 50 million or
5722440	5727480	something like that to have it on their service. So it's Warner brothers service though. Warner
5727480	5733080	brothers owns HBO. So that's why it's on HBO max. Got it. Got it. Well, still, still the money
5733080	5736360	they're getting from monthly subscriptions and probably people that signed up and stuff is
5736360	5740680	probably, probably not. Okay. That answers my question actually. Thank you. All right.
5741720	5744440	Let's move on. Let's go back to classics. Cause apparently
5745400	5750760	I, I don't understand how this newfangled box office works in the age of HBO max.
5750760	5754760	Let's talk about classics and a new newer game. That's going classic. Although I don't think
5754760	5760200	this surprises anyone. Uh, the game bloodstained ritual of the night has been adding a lot of,
5760200	5764840	you know, side modes and extra modes in the game. Uh, for example, some free DLC included
5764840	5770600	a randomizer mode, a boss revenge modes, um, allowing you to play as alternate protagonists.
5770680	5776200	Well now, um, five Oh five games in our play have announced that there is a classic mode coming to
5776200	5783400	the game. And when you look at the screenshots of classic mode, it looks exactly like a classic game
5783400	5787240	that bloodstained drew a lot of influence from a lot of influence, right? In fact,
5787240	5791240	because the same creative mind was behind them both. Yes. It looks like a fricking
5791240	5795720	Castlevania game. And I don't mean 70 in the night. I mean the old like vampire Hunter
5796680	5801560	turned into Castlevania and now thing, uh, it looks like one of those games, but it looks,
5801560	5807640	it, it looks like it, but it still has, it's not like retro. Like the interface looks like it,
5807640	5811400	but it's not like an eight bit game. All of a sudden that was that, that was that curse of the
5811400	5816200	moon side franchise they were doing. No, this is like a classic mode that's built into the game.
5816200	5822200	So it's more like 2d platforming action. So that's kind of neat. And again, it's something
5822200	5826600	that is just coming to the game next month because of how well the Kickstarter did, uh,
5826600	5831160	funded all these extra things. So that's pretty cool. Uh, another reason to visit bloodstained,
5831160	5836040	uh, if you haven't visited that in a while, I know I bought it and then it showed up on game pass.
5836040	5840760	I backed it actually. And they have a mobile version now too. Oh wow. And honestly,
5840760	5844760	I still think that the PS4 version is the best of the home releases.
5846840	5852040	Yeah. Just played so smoothly from day one. The switch version had some kind of hiccups in it. Um,
5852440	5855800	they've patched a lot of that out and ironed a lot of that out, but it was a little rough
5855800	5861960	in the beginning there. So, uh, I don't know if it's J opium or Joe PM three, one, three
5861960	5864040	said that they announced the sequel for bloodstained today.
5865480	5869960	I thought they were already working on one. I thought they were too. Yeah. But they might've,
5869960	5873960	they might've done an update or put out something on that. I'm not surprised. I think the game has
5873960	5880440	been doing very well. So, um, I'm surprised that a five Oh five games didn't want to charge us again
5880440	5886680	for, you know, that classic mode, you know, uh, I think the terms of the original Kickstarter
5886680	5891320	didn't, I think it was if we make so much money, then essentially the community's already paid for
5891320	5897080	it. I think that's what it works, how it works. So speaking of working, uh, I thought this was
5897080	5901800	a neat story. Darsaka. I had no idea something like this was a thing until you, uh, shared it
5901800	5908040	with me earlier today. And I'll tell you how I came across it is actually, I love to watch,
5908280	5915480	did you know, gaming one of my favorite channels and, uh, the fellow who runs it did, um, has a
5915480	5924440	game history secrets thing that he does. Um, his, uh, his name is Liam Robertson. And so he did one
5924440	5931080	about having tried to research this game boy peripheral, uh, called the work boy. And I don't
5931080	5935960	know if you'd ever seen any, any of the pictures or people saying that it was like the Holy grail
5935960	5942440	of like old game boy accessories. And, you know, people might remember that I did a year before
5942440	5948840	last do, uh, the classic peripheral. And I tried to outline like different peripherals, um,
5948840	5955560	including the sewing machine for the game boy. Um, so this one is called the work boy. Um,
5956440	5964840	it was rumored to have been released in very limited numbers in 1992. Um, it actually never
5964840	5972200	was released. It was developed by fab tech. Um, and, uh, it was actually fab tech and source
5972200	5978040	research and development. So it was a two part item. You have a small little keyboard and a
5978040	5985960	cartridge. So, um, and as a rom hack, uh, sorry, not rom hackers, but as people who were looking
5985960	5994440	at the code from the big, uh, uh, the giga leak, they found, um, one of the working prototypes of
5994440	5999960	the cartridge, but they couldn't get anything to do with it because it was reliant on the
5999960	6006600	keyboard to make it work. And the video is absolutely worth, worth watching. Um, but at any
6006600	6013720	rate, um, Liam and doing research on this actually got in touch with, uh, Franz Balus, who was the
6013720	6021960	founder of a fab tech who gave him his prototype, the copy he had of, of the thing, just sent it to
6021960	6028920	him. And, um, so, but no one, none of the developers had the cartridge for it. And it
6028920	6034120	was the giga leak that made this, uh, available. I mean, through this, there's like people who
6034120	6041720	developed games who lost so much of their work that this giga leak returned their work to them
6041720	6048200	pretty much. And this is one of the items is included. And so, sorry, that's very interesting
6048200	6052920	because there's been a lot of talk about is the giga leak like an ethical thing to cover,
6052920	6057080	you know, it's kind of like one tough question we've been faced with as, you know, people that
6057080	6061480	are producing gaming media type of thing. Yeah, it is news. And I think that's kind of ultimately
6061480	6065720	where it falls is like, you're going to talk about it, whether we do or not. So, you know,
6065720	6070920	and we can just say the leaks aren't cool. It's not cool. It happened, but it is interesting,
6070920	6074520	Jamie, that now you've kind of got this interesting side to it where it's like,
6074520	6079320	well, here's a case where this leak kind of allowed people that thought it was gone,
6079320	6083640	people who worked on it, who thought it was gone forever to kind of be reunited with it.
6083640	6090040	So it's an interesting, not, not, not that we're saying it's okay, but it is an interesting
6090040	6094760	silver lining to the situation. Well, and so if people work on this project and they
6094760	6099800	haven't had any way to save any of their assets or any of the work, because technically it's
6099800	6105720	owned by the studio that they did it for, you know, for a lot of these people, it was sort of
6105720	6111560	like, I guess like a little bit of gold for them, you know, just something that's come back up,
6111560	6118600	like finding an heirloom or something. But at any rate, the thing is that this is actually
6118600	6127320	pretty cool. This basically does what a lot of stuff that we can do on say our iPhones today,
6127960	6135880	but this was created before even PDAs were a big thing. The, the portable digital assistants,
6135880	6145320	like Palm, Palm pilot. Yeah. So at any rate, what this does is it has, and it was actually
6145320	6154120	pretty cool little thing. It has like a calendar, it has a built-in clock and the clock is reliant
6154120	6158120	on the cartridge, you know, so the two things work together because, you know, the Game Boy
6158120	6167080	didn't have a built-in clock. It also had like a country locator and it's like, I think it was
6167080	6179480	like 16 of the countries would play like the first few stanzas of their anthem. It also had a, like
6179480	6184280	a loose translator in there, like for like useful phrases. And I want to say
6185960	6192520	eight or 10 different languages, you know, just like useful things like for someone working.
6193720	6199160	It also had, now it didn't have a number pad on there, but you could use your top line of letters
6199160	6206120	that corresponded to a number to add in, to use the calculator, to use the, the phone book. It
6206120	6214040	had a phone book built into it, you know, like a little portable Rolodex. And it was actually
6214040	6221160	really cool. It had a word processor built into it, you know, it was supposed to have a printer
6222120	6226280	capability, but there wasn't a port on, I guess, the prototype for the keyboard yet.
6227640	6230120	And the Game Boy printer itself must not have been a thing yet.
6231080	6236040	I'd have to check the timeframe, but yeah, this was 1992. But at any rate,
6236040	6242920	this thing was supposed to retail for about 90 bucks. What they were saying in the video is that
6242920	6251480	the, what initially put the halt on it was the fact that the Game Boy was going to be dropping
6251480	6257480	its price. Like they had a price point on this that was set to match the Game Boys price point.
6258440	6265800	So you would pay roughly 180, 200 bucks and get this, you know, portable word processor system,
6265800	6273800	something that was well ahead of its time. Excuse me. And he just put the hold on it.
6273800	6278680	And the thing is, is that there were people after this who were like, we would have paid for this
6278680	6282600	thing, no matter what the price difference between this and the Game Boy was, you know,
6283240	6287960	and they're like, well, kind of wish we did it. And they actually did remarket it later on.
6288760	6294840	They had it in mind to do one for the Game Boy Advance that of course didn't even make it to
6294840	6305640	prototype. It was just, you know, drawings. And it actually was, the idea was purchased by Nokia
6306600	6312520	for one of their PDAs.
6312520	6314520	And it became the N-Gage. Just kidding.
6315880	6321720	I would have to dig deeper into that, but maybe not. The taco was not the best thing ever to
6321720	6331960	happen. And Nintendo hired one of the people who worked on that project as a design consultant
6331960	6335720	for the Game Boy Advance. And that's kind of what was leading to the WorkBoy 2,
6336520	6339160	the Game Boy Advance one that never saw the light of day.
6341160	6345160	So yeah, as of 2.100, Matt says we're getting Classic Game and Classic Peripheral.
6347080	6355640	Unreleased Peripheral. Then again, you know, I have done an unreleased game as Classic Game.
6355640	6359640	I did Space Fantasy Zone. Maybe there's a 2020 theme in there,
6359640	6365320	Classic Unreleased thing or something. I don't want to do that much research.
6368040	6369960	Maybe I'll do Classic Controller.
6369960	6372520	This is still neat because, you know, yeah,
6372520	6376280	it was kind of enhancing the Game Boy to do things that weren't just games.
6376280	6384440	Now, there's also a budget thing on here too, which I mean, it's just so, so interesting.
6385240	6389480	Now, what is interesting, Rama shared this link in chat of something he remembered,
6389480	6395080	and it was like a Game Boy. It was from Infogenius Productivity Pack from Game Tech,
6395080	6399480	a personal organizer and phone book. So and it actually had a clock in it and things like that.
6399480	6403880	And it looks like there's some other things there. So like a travel guide, a spell checker.
6403880	6411800	So this wasn't the only thing to really think of. How can we, you know, make the Game Boy more than
6411800	6415240	just games when people are taking this in their pockets? Again, you have to remember,
6415240	6419960	early 90s, before cell phones, before, you know, all that stuff.
6421080	6422360	Before smartphones.
6422360	6425960	Yeah. How do we put that all in our pocket where we go? And so it's interesting.
6425960	6428600	Some people took this approach of putting them in game packs,
6428600	6433560	although the Work Boy was more going to be not just a game, a game, a program,
6433560	6437800	but a peripheral with the word processing and all that stuff. It's kind of neat.
6437800	6448040	Exactly so. And honestly, absolutely watch the video. I will copy the link and paste it in chat
6448920	6454840	because it is absolutely, absolutely worth the watch. I think it was a wonderful video. It went
6454840	6459640	into a lot more detail than I did. Of course, don't watch it during the show. Wait till we're
6459640	6467320	done. But it's so great. It is just really cool to see the thing in motion. I thought it was really
6468120	6471800	something special. And the fact that the dude just gave it to this guy.
6472360	6472840	Yeah.
6472840	6480760	Yeah. I mean, he's like, I think, like, if I remember the conversation when you won it. Yes.
6482040	6482520	Here you go.
6482520	6489640	He sent it. And the fact that this ties into the Giga leak as well is just sort of like news upon
6489640	6497800	news in history. So, of course, now I would imagine that it would have needed like some
6497800	6505320	sort of like holder or rig in there, which they actually had a rig designed for the Work Boy 2
6505320	6510840	that would have been with Game Boy Advance. Like it had a clamshell. Because certainly doing the
6510840	6515160	word processing on such a tiny thing that could flop over if you were, say, like trying to work
6515160	6520520	on a plane or something, you know, that wouldn't be easy.
6521400	6527000	All right. Well, you got to do back to back duty tonight because it's time to get to our
6527000	6528760	classic game of the week. We've just talked about.
6528760	6530360	Which has nothing to do with the Game Boy.
6530360	6534680	Yeah. It's just a completely different pick. That's okay. It's time for the last classic
6534680	6539720	game of 2020. So every week, Dark Sakura jumps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she
6539720	6549480	thinks, hey, you brats, get off my lawn. Enough of your PlayStation fives and Xbox X's. You got
6549480	6554920	to get a console that didn't even come out in the United States for this one. Sort of, sort of,
6554920	6557800	but you'll get into it. Dark Sakura. And this is one of those.
6557800	6560520	It did eventually make its way over here in one way or another.
6560520	6565160	You've talked about this series before, but not this particular game. And I think this is
6565160	6572520	a fascinating one. I'm going to take a halo approach to the sequel by the way that the U.S.
6572520	6580920	got, but in Japan, um, Metal Gear got a remake, uh, not a remake, a sequel called Metal Gear 2
6580920	6589480	Solid Snake. And this is the actual sequel to Metal Gear, not Snake's Revenge. Um, and the
6589480	6594760	good thing for the viewers, we are watching a later port of the game that is in English that
6594760	6598360	Jamie will get into later. Just so they understand why they're saying English.
6599000	6605960	And the cool thing about this is that you start seeing a lot of the groundwork for like Metal
6605960	6610200	Gear Solid, like we got on PlayStation. It really seems to have quite a bit more,
6611240	6619880	you see that evolution into this. So, um, at any rate, um, it was released by Konami for the
6619880	6628120	MSX 2 computer in 1990. And it is, like I said, a direct sequel to the MSX 2 version of Metal Gear,
6629480	6636680	both written and designed by Hideo Kojima. Um, and he actually did the sequel as a response
6636680	6643400	to Snake's Revenge because it was bad and he didn't like it. So he made the real thing.
6644360	6652280	Um, so, um, with this one, of course, it only came out in Japan. Um, and it was immediately
6652280	6662680	followed up by Metal Gear Solid. Um, this one is, uh, it was interesting. And by the way,
6662680	6667800	it did get the rereleases of this. It was released as content in the subsist,
6668760	6676280	the subsistence version of Metal Gear Solid 3 for PlayStation 2 in 2005, and included in the HD
6676280	6682920	Metal Gear Solid 3 for PS3, Xbox 360, and PlayStation Vita, and then a standalone re-release
6682920	6692040	in Japan for mobile phones and the Wii virtual console. Um, but at any rate, it was set in 1999,
6692040	6699640	a few years after the original game where Snake has to go into this territory known as Zanzibar
6699640	6705960	land to kidnap a scientist and to destroy a new Metal Gear called Metal Gear D. Um,
6705960	6716360	it's got a lot more of the stealth, uh, aspect to it. Um, really just, uh, over the top actually,
6716360	6722760	because it really evolved that system and it deals with a lot more in terms of the storyline.
6722760	6729640	It's really gathered some complexity going over like the nature of what war is and, uh,
6729640	6735480	nuclear proliferation. Um, it's on record as one of the best 8-bit games ever made.
6736360	6742200	And so with this one, um, it, like I said, it builds on that stealth based gameplay. Um,
6742280	6746680	your objective is to infiltrate the enemy stronghold while avoiding detection from
6746680	6753640	soldiers, cameras, infrared sensors, and other surveillance devices. Um, and so, uh, one of the
6753640	6760520	big changes actually not in, I guess, Snake as much, but as in what the enemies can do.
6761320	6768520	So instead of having like this one stationed guard, they now patrol multiple screens on a
6768520	6773720	single map and they have expanded vision to 45 degrees. They can turn their heads.
6774440	6781480	Um, they can detect sounds. Um, like if you punch a wall or shoot a gun, uh, without a suppressor,
6781480	6786520	they'll hear it. Um, and then they'll come investigate. Um, they can hear you walking on
6786520	6793880	certain surfaces. And if you're discovered, then you have a counter that goes down until they've
6793880	6800600	lost track of you. So then when it reaches zero, then it goes back to normal sound a lot like
6800600	6806120	Metal Gear Solid right there, just saying you do have, um, new maneuvers, new tools.
6806840	6814280	So you can duck under desks inside air ducts. You have a three by three radar grid so that you can
6814280	6819880	see where your position is versus the enemies. Um, of course the radar is disabled in the alert
6819880	6827160	phase. Again, we saw this in Metal Gear Solid. Um, you can, uh, increase your health and carrying
6827160	6833320	capacity every time you beat a boss. Um, you have robot robotic mice to distract enemies with,
6833320	6840840	you have camo, different kinds of rations. Um, the transceiver for your conversations are now,
6840840	6845720	uh, they're pro the, this program to be a lot more context sensitive instead of just based on
6845720	6853320	where you are and you can see the faces of people that you're talking to. Um, and so, um, you know,
6853320	6859960	you get different, uh, codes, different, uh, frequency numbers. You can lure a carrier pigeon
6859960	6865000	with certain rations. You got all kinds of different stuff. You can chase a lady spy into
6865000	6872760	the ladies room. Didn't we see this with Meryl? Um, kind of, um, that again, Metal Gear Solid.
6872760	6879800	Um, but the MSX2 version requires, um, either a floppy disk drive or the Game Master 2 utility
6879800	6885640	cartridge to save your progress. Um, and in absence of that, the password, you, you have a
6885640	6892040	password. Later versions of the game did remove the password favor, uh, the password feature in
6892040	6899960	favor of using standardized media, such as memory cards or internal hard disks. So, um, your main
6899960	6910440	character, you have a solid snake. Um, you have Roy Campbell. Um, you've got, uh, his, uh,
6910440	6916200	commanding officer, McDonald Miller, who I think didn't he become master Miller in the later ones.
6916200	6924120	You have, uh, George Kessler. You have Joseph Norden who was renamed to Johan Jacobson in the
6924120	6931480	later ones. You have Holly White as a CIA agent posting as a journalist. You've got, uh, all kinds
6931480	6938600	of just other characters. Um, uh, just, and some of them we've seen come back. You also have Big Boss
6939480	6948280	and Gray Fox, as we saw in, uh, in, uh, Metal Gear, Metal Gear Solid. Um, you've got bosses,
6948280	6956120	you have, um, like one called Running Man, Red Blaster, Black Color, who's renamed to Black Ninja.
6956840	6965560	Um, Predator, uh, who was also renamed Jungle Evil for some reason. And, you know, so basically
6966200	6970440	that's sort of starting the hokey name, uh, thing that went on in later Metal Gear games.
6971080	6977720	Um, so, um, I'm not gonna get too much into the story cause I'd say you should go out and play the
6977720	6983320	game. Um, there's also translated original MSX versions out there to play, but it was very,
6984040	6990520	very successful. Um, uh, Kojima of course was not involved in either of the NES versions
6991080	6997960	and he didn't have a plan to do the sequel until he saw that one of his coworkers was assigned to
6997960	7005960	work on Snake's Revenge. Um, and he of course wasn't happy about it. And so the, the coworker
7006120	7011880	actually encouraged Kojima to do his own. And so, um, Jamie, I just have to say a comparison
7011880	7017320	between you and Hideo Kojima and probably why you like him so much is that this game was motivated
7017320	7026520	by spite, much like, uh, you, everything that I do. I'm absolutely motivated by spite. I mean,
7026520	7031480	that's, that's really what it is. Metal Gear Solid 2, or excuse me, I'm sorry. Metal Gear 2
7031480	7038120	is Solid Snake is one of those games that exists out of spite. Maybe, maybe Mega Man 2 being the
7038120	7041640	only other I can think of at the top of my head where they, they weren't going to do it until the
7041640	7050520	workers just kind of did it on their off time. Well, and, and basically, um, after some business
7050520	7058680	trips, Kojima got the execs to approve of it for the MSX. So, um, as I said earlier, the MSX 2
7058680	7066920	version of, uh, Metal Gear 2 was released in Japan on July 20th, 1990. Um, no English version
7066920	7073960	was produced, um, since Konami, uh, actually discontinued sales of the MSX in Europe because,
7073960	7079480	you know, the U S never got the MSX. It was, they did in Europe. There was a fan translation
7079480	7088840	done in 1987 by the MSX hobbyist group, G and T international. Um, the first port came on a
7088840	7096520	Japanese phone. Um, basically a feature phone was what they're called that had like the, the,
7098520	7104840	the like video windows and stuff like that, um, came out October 1st, 2004, uh, for download on
7104920	7111000	i-mode easy web and Yahoo mobile services. The guy playing this isn't very good at stealth,
7111000	7118040	just saying, well, the video is going to loop in a minute here anyway. Sorry. Yeah. I only
7118040	7124120	am able to pull about 10 minutes before it loops. But at any rate, um, uh, it included,
7124120	7130440	um, an easy mode, a boss rush, uh, that was unlockable after you beat the game. Um,
7130440	7137160	and then the portraits in the MSX two version were modeled after like some real celebrities,
7137160	7143880	but then they, uh, were redesigned to look like the original character designs in the later
7143880	7152040	installations or installments. Um, and these changes also carried over into metal gear,
7152040	7157640	solid three subsistence, that version that came in and metal gear solid three snake eater snake
7157720	7164680	eater. Anyway, I can't think of snake eater without that song gonna play in my head. Um,
7164680	7169640	it did get her a release on the Wii virtual console exclusively in Japan on March 30th,
7169640	7176520	2010. Um, and it was of course, emulated off of the MSX two hardware rather than being a port.
7177400	7186280	Um, so, uh, the music was done by the Konami, uh, uh, uh, I always mispronounce it Kukeha club.
7187000	7195880	Um, same people that worked on nemesis two and snatcher. Um, and you can actually hear some of
7195880	7201480	the arranged music from that in the VR training disc for metal gear, solid integral, or as we
7201480	7209000	got it, metal gear, solid VR missions. So, uh, the theme of solid snake was, uh, from that game
7209000	7219080	was heard in super smash brothers ball. So it was ranked at number one in MSX magazines, top 30 best
7219080	7228280	selling MSX games. Uh, it was, I mean, pretty much given some amazing reviews, just even in the,
7228280	7234120	the later iterations that we got with, uh, the releases with the later metal gear games,
7234120	7241560	the remastered ones. So, and I mean, I didn't play it myself. I watched Dan play through it
7241560	7247320	cause he had, um, an emulator for it and he was really getting into it. I think this game is,
7247320	7255800	is pretty fantastic. Um, it, it laid this one, I think like while the first model gear might've been
7256440	7263080	the foundation for all of the later games, this one really laid out the groundwork.
7263080	7270120	This one was the cornerstone, the, the, the, the studs, the, the anchors.
7270120	7276600	Well, it's just such a unique release to where, you know, we literally had two different sequels,
7276600	7281160	uh, in the U S versus Japan, which doesn't happen all the time. I mean, super Mario
7281160	7286360	brothers comes to mind, but it's not, uh, it's not something you, you really have a lot of in,
7286360	7291880	in the history of gaming. Um, and, and just the fact that not only like, and, and even with Mario,
7291880	7295480	like at least those games were still both Nintendo games, but these are like
7295480	7300680	really radically different because metal gear, uh, two was for the longest time,
7300680	7306600	only an M I'm sorry, not, not the, not the no snakes revenge is what I call the U S revenge,
7306600	7311160	but, uh, metal gear two was a MSX thing, which we didn't even have here in the States.
7311160	7314440	And then of course, snakes revenge was an NES game. And yeah, I play, I remember playing a
7314440	7318920	little bit of it and it wasn't it, you could tell it was designed by different people. It
7318920	7323960	was a different kind of game. Um, but then memories of playing it, but yeah,
7323960	7331000	it's not the best game. It's also weird because many of us in the U S our foundation of metal
7331000	7337000	gear is that original, uh, admittedly subpar version of the game, but we didn't know that,
7337000	7343560	you know, we didn't know that the last boss exactly. And so it is interesting how, you know,
7343560	7347560	here in the U S you know, we just, I think we all just kind of collectively wrote off snakes
7347640	7351800	revenge and then, Oh, metal gear solid shows up. And that's really, you know,
7351800	7355560	either the first experience in the franchise for a lot of people, whatever, but, but you bring up
7355560	7362200	a great point that it's like, but the, the real bridge between metal gear and metal gear solid
7362200	7368280	is this. And unless you are a hardcore metal gear collector or whatever, you probably have
7368280	7373160	never played it or maybe even heard of it before because of its unique Japanese release. Sorry.
7373800	7377960	On top of that, you know, like what I think a lot of people didn't realize when they were
7377960	7381640	playing metal gear solid is that when gray Fox shows up and snake knows him
7382520	7386120	and everyone's like, who the hell is gray Fox and why does snake know him?
7386120	7392200	Yeah. Good point. Yeah. And I really liked that Kojima was like, I reject.
7392200	7396360	Wasn't I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Jamie. Wasn't gray Fox in the original metal gear. I know big boss
7396360	7401880	was I thought gray. Yeah, I guess, but I think, but he had more of a role to play.
7401960	7408440	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's been a lot. I loved the metal gear when I was a kid and I had,
7408440	7413480	but I never super got into the solid series. Honestly, they just became too, too stealthy
7413480	7418040	for me. Sorry. Well, what I was saying though, with that is this like Kojima said, I reject
7418040	7427960	your reality and replace it with my own. And I think that getting those, uh, the subsistence
7427960	7434920	and metal gear solid three is the first exposure that people who did not actively look for it here
7434920	7444840	in the U S got to, to this game. And I'm really glad that they, uh, they, uh, uh, localized it,
7444840	7449400	uh, for, for what we got over here, because it's a fantastic game. I really enjoyed the story.
7449400	7453880	Yeah. Um, it's been years since I've done any play of it, but I was just like thinking
7454520	7459240	what is something that would be good to end the year on?
7459240	7463560	Yeah. And what, you know, I really wish Kami would kind of get their shit together, so to speak and,
7463560	7469640	and maybe put, put these, uh, redone versions out again, you know, outside of the, the metal gears,
7469640	7474840	you know, where it was just showed up in as bonus content, why not do some rerelease standalone
7474840	7479080	content of, uh, on the Nintendo switch or something of the MSX games? I'd be so into that.
7479080	7484840	I'd love that. So, oh, we'll see. But, um, with this particular segment over,
7484840	7492520	I want to position a question to both of you guys that, um, Dan asked me, and he asked me what semi
7492520	7499240	obscure video or video game system or anything that plays video games would I want? So before
7499240	7503720	I give you my answer, I want to know what your YouTube would choose. Wait, I don't know who you
7503720	7510280	dark soccer would want or who I would know what, what I want. I'm asking you what, what's semi
7510280	7518600	obscure or somewhat obscure system that you would want. Um, damn. That's a really good question. Um,
7522040	7527320	I know you put me on the spot here. Um, I can do that. Maybe. Yeah, you can. Um,
7529160	7533160	I was going to say maybe like, uh, of course my brain is going to like retro stuff
7533160	7537000	and I'm kind of torn between like either like an old ass, like Apple to eat. Cause I never had
7537000	7541800	one of those when I was a kid. Um, and there's a lot of fun stuff to rediscover on that. Or maybe,
7541800	7546760	um, straight up a Coleco. I know that's your, your bread and butter, but I never had a Coleco
7546760	7551880	and never really got to play with that. Okay. Maybe I have two of them. Do you really?
7553160	7559400	Yeah, it's in my garage. No, no, I have to Dan bought one from one of my coworkers and then I
7559400	7563960	came back from Alabama with one, although I don't get me wrong. MSX would be bad-ass,
7563960	7568520	but the reality is all the games are in Japanese. I, you know, I'm not going to count the Saturn
7568520	7573800	as obscure by the way that power I'm talking about things like an FM towns or something like that.
7575000	7578040	I thought of another one, the Panasonic queue, the one that played GameCube games.
7578680	7586360	That was kind of rad. Okay. All right. Uh, I don't really have any consoles that I would want. I
7586360	7592600	would think, um, well, I'm also counting gaming computers that were standalone systems like
7592600	7599560	computers too. So something like the FM towns or something like that. No, I don't really have any
7600200	7609160	thing that I would want. Um, yeah, I can't think of anything. I told Dan mine would be the sharp
7609240	7621240	X 68,000 or if I can find a duo LT and a PC engine duo LT, wait, why I say duo, it's just a PC engine
7621240	7628520	LT. Um, which you remember Chris saying, yeah, I think he has a couple of them. He lost one in a
7628520	7634120	movie theater. True story. He's I don't know if he wants me to tell that, but I just did. Um,
7634120	7638360	some interesting comments in chat, uh, Bobby saying not obscure, but I want a CDI so I can
7638360	7645800	find the Zelda games. Uh, or it has a 3d. Oh, um, Questmaster says not a console to have out an
7645800	7653080	arcade cab, like the R three 60. Yeah. Well, the CDI games were, uh, unofficially remastered a few
7653080	7658920	weeks ago and they are on the internet if you were looking to play for those on PC. Yeah. So
7658920	7663800	that's something, well, we know what Dan's answer was. Oh, what's that? Dan wants the
7663800	7669640	Capcom CPS changer, which you can only play like eight games on it. I mean, but they're the arcade
7669640	7675880	games. If we can throw arcades into it, then I want a Nintendo pay choice 10, but now the
7675880	7683800	changer itself is meant to play the arcade games on a home TV, which is basically just like, I
7683800	7691640	think a super gun and yeah. Um, but yeah, Dan said the CPS changer and me, I, I would want the, the
7691640	7701240	shark. Okay. All right. Bobby, you send me $4,000. I'll send you a doctor who pinball on my honor,
7702280	7707560	including the shipping. All right. Uh, there it is your classic game of the week,
7707560	7714680	metal gear two, not to be confused with snakes revenge, the not great sequel we got in the U S
7714680	7720440	but the actual MSX sequel done by Hideo Kojima to the original metal gear game. Um, good pick
7720440	7724520	dark soccer. I would, I actually thought we'd done it before, but I think we just talked about
7724520	7727560	it when we were talking about like the first game or something like that. So, uh, cause I,
7727560	7732600	I knew this little bit about gaming history and I, I didn't know for a lot. We were doing this
7732600	7735880	show and I learned about it. I was like, what there's, there's a different metal gear two game.
7735880	7741320	What I kind of learned that through this show. So, um, yeah, kind of cool. It's a neat little gaming
7741320	7749000	story. All right. Uh, let's get into some rapid fire news. We're going to travel around the globe
7749000	7753240	and, uh, quickly, uh, cover some other things. Actually. I don't think we have as much with the
7753240	7759640	holiday week, but we'll get into it. Well, anyways, um, so we have some more games with
7759640	7766920	gold for January. So now, uh, it looks like little nightmares, uh, dead rising, the king of fighters
7766920	7774120	13 and breakdown will be your games of gold, uh, for January. So that's pretty cool. And then
7775080	7782840	another Microsoft titles also getting an update. So the, uh, VR update for Microsoft flight simulator
7782840	7790920	is now a thing. Um, it is going to be, of course, I mean, it makes sense. Uh, just the actual like,
7790920	7796680	uh, head tracking is basically supported. They don't actually support any of the controllers,
7796680	7801240	which makes sense because you're flying a plane. I can't imagine that they'd be able to simplify it
7801240	7807000	that, um, that much, but I guess it's got to come to consoles at some point. So they're going to
7807000	7813000	have to simplify it a little bit, but it is not something that they are supporting right now,
7813000	7819080	but it does support any open XR compliant headsets. So your Oculus five valve index,
7819720	7825320	windows mixed reality headsets are supported. So pretty cool. Wonder how big that download is.
7826040	7831720	Um, but yeah, it's going to be big. I have to try that. All right. I just don't want to download the
7831720	7837560	whole game. Well, uh, speaking of VR, another, uh, game that's getting VR is Tetris effect
7837560	7842360	connected. And you might be thinking, well, wasn't Tetris effect already in DVR. Yes. The PlayStation
7842360	7847800	version was in VR, but this is Tetris effect connected. This is the kind of sequel kind of,
7847800	7852520	it's more like Tetris effect plus I would call it. Uh, and, uh, that wasn't on PlayStation and
7852520	7858840	still isn't, uh, it is actually still exclusive to Xbox and windows 10, but through the Microsoft
7858840	7864120	windows 10 store, not through Epic games, which is where I bought it. That's the only game I've
7864120	7868600	bought on the Epic store is Tetris effect. And it is not upgraded to connected still
7868600	7872680	that will be coming out this summer. So it sounds like Microsoft probably threw some
7872680	7877880	coin to have connected be an exclusive for a little bit. But anyway, if you have it on the
7877880	7884360	Xbox or windows 10 store, obviously the series X and those that they don't support VR headsets,
7884360	7890280	but if you have it on a PC through the Microsoft storefronts, you will get, um, you know, of course,
7890280	7896600	4k 60 frame per second output and all this, but in the connected stuff will add, uh, with the 1.10
7896600	7903000	patch official support for Vive and Oculus rift headsets. Although the notes for the patch do
7903000	7907800	indicate it should work with other like steam VR, if it runs that it'll work on the headset.
7907800	7912920	So it's should be pretty, uh, pretty open-ended there. And I'm sure, I'm sure if it doesn't
7912920	7918200	officially get supported hackers will make it work wink. So, um, there you go. Tetris effect
7918200	7923560	connected now in VR, which is a great VR game, by the way, at least the original is so one of the
7923560	7928280	few things I've played a lot, a lot, a lot of on the PlayStation 4 VR, uh, dark soccer. How about
7928280	7939880	you? Um, how about some home star runner news, but it's 20, 20, 20 X D six anyway. Um, so since
7939880	7950120	flash is being officially discontinued, um, on, uh, December 31st, um, they, uh, have, uh, finally
7950120	7959720	put out level 10 of a stinko man 20 X D six. So, um, it's, uh, it's basically a flash game.
7959720	7967240	It's got multiple levels sort of anime style. Um, and yeah, level, level 10 is out. Um, you can
7967240	7975640	play it before it goes away. Um, I might have to, uh, get myself my, uh, flash downloader and just
7975640	7983080	save the whole game so I can play it forever. But yeah, some, uh, home star runner stuff.
7984520	7988600	Say you got about five days to squeeze it in there before flash has gone forever.
7988600	7996280	So, right. Yeah. That's been a whole to do going on with my, uh, day life because flash is how a
7996280	7999720	lot of e-learning was built back in the day. And so we have to kind of like convert it all
7999720	8004440	to not be flashing. I learned flash in college. Yeah. I learned a little bit of it there too. So
8004440	8010840	yeah, I took two whole semesters or not, not semesters, but yeah, semester is learning flash.
8010840	8016280	Yeah. And I sucked at it, but the fun thing now is that all that time I spent in learning out flash
8017480	8023720	made it really easy for me to learn a motion and DJ Rama S and chat says new grounds created an
8023720	8029240	alternative flash player for its website. Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure there will still be ways. Um,
8029320	8035400	but for the most part, probably just update this for HTML five. Yeah. Yeah. So by the way, did,
8035400	8040440	did what Alan, uh, bring me show up on cam because he went to the store and sometimes they'll bring
8040440	8046520	me a little treat. So he brought me, he brought me red vines, but they're not because you know,
8046520	8051000	Jamie, I don't think you'll like this. I'm not really into red vines, but it's the black
8051000	8057480	licorice red vines. Yum. Cause I'm, I am that freak who loves black licorice. I thought you
8057480	8064440	like Jaeger too. I do love Jaeger actually. Cause you know what it tastes like? Terrible.
8067400	8073000	Malort on the other hand. I'm kidding. All right. So I have to ask, have you ever had a Uzo?
8073560	8080920	I don't think so. No, it is an Annie's flavored, uh, uh, liqueur from Greece. Huh?
8081800	8090920	So if, if you come over, I might invest in a very small bottle of Uzo to see if you can stand it.
8090920	8096200	All right. I hate it. All right. All right. I think that's it for rapid fighting. Absinthe
8096200	8102040	is also nasty and I've had the real thing. So I feel like I've had it, but it was the,
8102040	8107560	the marketed thing. Like it wasn't the real thing. Like it was the, you know, when after everybody
8107560	8113160	saw Moulin Rouge, uh, somebody made a mainstream version of it. So I don't think I've had the real
8113160	8121320	thing. All right. When I had it, it was actually on a Creek Indian reservation. Ooh, fun. And so
8121320	8126600	it was the real thing. Cause the laws are different. You could bring it in there. Yeah. Um,
8126600	8134600	and it was absolutely terrible. It spirits of wormwood it, and it kind of handed me my ass
8134600	8139240	cause I had a bunch of it cause I don't even know what the fuck we were doing,
8139240	8145400	but absent this terrible pod culture says I had a dragon con and I, I, that's what I kind of thought,
8145400	8151240	but I didn't want to commit myself to that, but thank you for that. And I remember, am I wrong?
8151240	8156280	It was, it was kind of the, it was the, the, you could buy it at a store stuff, which,
8156280	8158680	you know, the stuff Jamie's talking about, you can't really buy it.
8159480	8163640	But by, by the way, um, to, to tell Ronma who
8163640	8168200	said, uh, Mako Chan would love to have some of the real, the real deal. I was, um,
8170040	8174920	18 when I had absence. It's been a little while, but not that long.
8177000	8185320	It's been a while. All right. Let's move on and travel around the world and check out some
8185320	8189320	release dates. Although I have a feeling it's going to be a quiet week, but let's check in
8189320	8194520	anyway. Got nothing for you. I'm sure there's some digital games coming out, but nothing's
8194520	8198920	on the slate. Yeah. We're done for the year at this point. We're pretty much done for the year.
8198920	8203000	Um, mine are still loading. Do we want to go to Jamie's UK dates? Do you have those?
8203000	8210360	They ain't jack shit. Yeah. Uh, okay. There we do have some, some, some things in, uh, Japan,
8210360	8216120	just a few Digimon survive is out on the Nintendo switch this week in Japan. So you have that.
8216120	8222920	Uh, and I think that's it. I'm leading the PS4 real quick. Did you Mon survive is there too?
8222920	8228840	Ninja judge tomorrow collection and shovel Knight gets a retail release in Japan. So that's what you
8228840	8234040	have to look forward to this week. Okay. We have a few more stories for you guys, and then we will
8234040	8242840	wrap it up. Uh, Loki. All right. So, um, I guess despite all of the bugs and everything, um, with
8242840	8251480	the PlayStation four and, um, X-Box one versions of cyberpunk 2077, it is still selling, uh, like
8251480	8259480	crazy. They hit 13 million in sales. Um, even with the refunds factored into that as well. So
8260040	8264200	it's doing pretty well. I mean, I guess the game is highly anticipated, so that probably
8264200	8271080	counts for a lot of it, but it is good to see that it's doing well, just wish it was released
8271080	8278120	in the better, uh, state. But as Jamie had mentioned earlier, there was a new patch that was,
8278120	8285560	um, released this week. And with that, it fixed one of the bugs that was wiping save files.
8285560	8291240	Apparently if your save file hit a certain limit, so eight megabytes, and that could be from just
8291240	8299240	having a large amount of crafting items in your inventory. Um, apparently it was causing corruption
8299240	8306600	and it would actually, um, erase your progress, but the new apparently 1.06 hot fix claims that
8306600	8312200	it will prevent that, uh, from rising, but it won't fix any of your saves that you had that
8312200	8318120	were already affected by this bug. So yeah. And then on top of that, it also improves memory
8318120	8326520	management and stability, which should result in fear crashes, but we'll have to see. And it's only
8326520	8334200	15 gigabytes. So yay. Is that all? Is that that's it? Yeah. I actually think part of the reason I
8334200	8338200	decided to jump in and try to tell me why this week is because I was looking at like, how much
8338280	8344440	bandwidth have we used? Oh, we're only up to 600 gigs. Okay. We got a ways to go. I have some room.
8344440	8348920	So I downloaded some games. It's sad that I have to like manage things on that level now, you know,
8348920	8360200	but anyway, he's out of office in like less than a month. Can't wait. Um, and, uh, yeah. So cyberpunk
8360200	8363000	it's still selling pretty well. Now, of course, we don't know how many of those were bought and
8363000	8369400	placed under a Christmas tree or equivalent sort of thing for the holidays. Um, but we can assume
8369400	8374760	that maybe not as many as the internet wants us to think are like, you know, returns in waiting,
8374760	8379640	so to speak. I think, and I think too, this is probably one of those cases where the internet
8379640	8383960	is making a lot more noise than the actual reality of people that are going to the trouble
8383960	8389400	to return the game, or maybe even can realize that they can do it. You know, I think there's probably
8389400	8395240	a lot of people who are getting it for Christmas, et cetera, who don't even realizing refunded if
8395240	8400760	they wanted to. Yeah. Or just, there's a lot of people that realize that. Yeah, that sucks that
8400760	8406440	the game is all broken right now, but I also have like 700, 800 games in my backlog. So I'll just
8406440	8411880	put this in there with them and come back to it when it's fixed. Well, and then of course also PC
8411880	8416920	seems to be the least, uh, of the systems that's getting complaints. It's really about the older
8416920	8421800	cons or I hate saying older consoles, but it's really what it is now. The PlayStation 4, Xbox one
8421800	8426360	versions, because again, uh, we had that story a couple of weeks ago about how cyberpunk was, was
8426360	8433000	shattering the steam concurrent play records by like a lot. And I would imagine those people
8433000	8437480	generally are having problem free experience. Well, you know, they're having Bethesda bug
8437480	8442520	style experiences. They're not having like the, Oh my God, this is broken type of stuff that the
8442520	8448520	PlayStation 4, some of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox one folks are experiencing. So, yeah. Yeah.
8449160	8456120	All right. Anyhow. Well, speaking of steam, let's talk about steam sales. Has anyone now, and this
8456120	8461480	is, this is very much a, uh, no one special question of the week, but, uh, I think it's
8461480	8467560	worth asking, but has anyone succumbed to the steam sale or any type of digital sale going on?
8467560	8471880	Well, you, you literally bought something during the show, right? I'm waiting for someone though,
8471880	8478120	to buy me Detroit because of presence. Oh, I forgot that that's even on PC.
8479240	8485080	Yeah. It's at the top of my steam one list. There you go. Um, I w I haven't picked it up yet,
8485080	8490200	but of course, uh, the, the great enabler, my friend, Shane, uh, happened to mention to me,
8490200	8494200	did you look at the sale on DJ max? And I was like, I don't want to buy that again.
8494200	8498120	I already bought on PS4. Oh, it's really, it's down to 20 bucks now. Now it's in,
8498120	8503480	now it's in the range where I might buy it again. Uh, so yeah, I haven't, I haven't done it yet,
8503480	8508760	but I probably will pull the trigger before the new year and buy myself DJ max on steam again.
8508760	8512600	Uh, Loki, have you, have you gotten suckered in any of those, uh, sales yet?
8513400	8520600	Um, not really like my son wanted me to buy him, uh, Gary's mod. So I did that, but it wasn't on
8520600	8524280	sale. I actually accidentally hit something that played out all through by speaker. So I didn't
8524280	8528680	mean to scream into the mic. Oh, you're fine. It didn't come through on our end. So I know,
8528680	8537640	but it blew my ears out. Um, I, I'm looking at fuser it's down to $40, but there's still,
8537640	8541240	that's still a lot of money, man. And I just noticed like two people in chat were asking
8541240	8546040	about that too. Yeah. I have not played fuser myself. That is one of those games where again,
8546040	8550280	Shane tried to enable me on that, which most music games he does to be fair. And, and most of the
8550280	8554680	time I'm I'm on board. Uh, it's just, I already bought DJ max on PlayStation four when it comes
8554680	8561560	to fuser. Yeah. The $60 was a little high now that it's coming down. Uh, I, I might,
8562120	8566600	I'm, I must see what my money, well, I guess we're all getting 600 bucks, but I'll let me see
8566600	8570760	where my money's at in a couple in a, in a, well, I got to hurry up before the sales.
8571880	8578360	Now is that $600? So like, is that like a loan from your tax refund type of thing?
8578360	8584520	I, I don't know. I, I don't want to talk about it here. It's just to be determined from other
8584520	8590040	places anyway. Oh, good point. Now see pixel pockets with some, with some good like coupon
8590040	8596200	clip and tips here. If you buy it on Epic, which I don't love supporting Epic right now, cause I
8596200	8602280	really think they're in the wrong on the whole, um, you know, Apple brew ha ha, but, uh, a good
8602280	8607400	deal is a good deal. And basically says, if you buy it on Epic with a $10 coupon, it's 10 bucks
8607400	8612680	cheaper than steam. I didn't think about that. Yeah. You make a good case. My friend will leave
8612680	8620360	it at that. If you, if you and Shane teamed up, it would be deadly. I remember the, it's your free
8620360	8626760	games. They have new games on Epic game store every day now for at least the foreseeable future
8626760	8631720	that I have no problem taking advantage of. I'm getting it for free. Epic's paying somebody.
8632280	8636920	That's not my problem. So yeah, no, I have been stacking up on those games. That's for sure.
8637480	8644760	So, all right. Uh, so anyway, Oh, I didn't, God, we, I asked, I asked my no one special
8644760	8649400	question and then I didn't even get to the damn story. So let's talk about how valve now has a
8649400	8654040	filter. Uh, so you can better hunt for your discounts during the steam sales, which, um,
8654040	8657800	again, is one of those things I'm kind of surprised it wasn't there before. Uh, so this is,
8657800	8662040	this is good because now you're not overwhelmed with the fact that pretty much the entire store
8662040	8667000	is on sale. So they have what's called faceted browsing. So you narrow down what you're looking
8667640	8674520	while you're looking for the sales. So you use categories like visuals, themes, mood features,
8674520	8680360	and you can of course combine these. It sounds a lot like tab tags on games. So for example,
8680360	8685240	if you tell steam, I want to see third person sci-fi games, well, then steam will say, here
8685240	8690200	you go, dead space three and star Wars battlefront. It sounds a lot like tabs, but it's not going to
8690200	8696840	show every discounted game, but some of the more notable ones. So interesting. Uh, and I'm sure,
8696840	8700520	Hey, any way that they can put the games you want to see in front of you? Cause I will say
8700520	8704280	it is weird how steam just kind of, I feel like it's throwing everything in the kitchen sink at
8704280	8708120	me, uh, when I log into steam and look at some of that stuff. So I think it's a good idea to
8708120	8716040	highlight some of the big deals. Um, and, and yeah, otherwise, uh, sharing with friends and
8716040	8719560	stuff is a good way to get the news around. Cause that's how I found out about, you know,
8719560	8726040	both fuser and, uh, DJ backs going on sale. So, all right, let's move on to dark Sakura.
8729000	8734600	There is a new game being, uh, uh, announced actually being developed by, um,
8734600	8739800	arc system works and we know the awesomeness of arc system for their fighting games.
8739800	8749640	Um, but they are doing a, uh, dungeon fighter, uh, fighting game, DNF, uh, DNF dual. Um, so it's
8749640	8757640	being published by, uh, is it meeple Neopole and developed by arc system works. Um, and aiding,
8757640	8764200	uh, they have announced the game, uh, it's based in unreal engine as a spinoff off the RPG dungeon
8764200	8771960	fighter online. Um, and so, uh, they haven't announced like platforms, uh, no real release,
8771960	8779160	uh, window, but it looks pretty freaking cool. I'm just saying, you know, I, I love practically
8779160	8788840	anything that, that arc has done in this one really seems to be no, uh, no, uh, no less
8788840	8795640	impressive than any of their guilty gear or any of those games. So, uh, Dr. C and chat says I used
8795640	8802680	to play a ton of dungeon fighters. So an arc says fighting game has me curious. Yeah. If I will,
8802680	8809000	I will, uh, share the, uh, the video in our chat room for those there. And for folks who are
8809000	8815000	playing the home version of the game, uh, look it up. All right. Um, one more story here from
8815000	8819080	Loki, and then we'll open it up to the listener round table and check our mailbag Loki.
8819720	8824440	It's a remaster that none of us have been waiting for, but it's still pretty cool. So
8825000	8831480	probably soon to be featured on, um, games done quick, but I want to be the guy has a brand new
8831480	8839640	remaster after 13 years. And so they said this, uh, it's mostly faithfully are the mostly faithful
8839640	8844840	remaster of the original. I want to be the guy, uh, trying to balance the spirit of the original
8844840	8850920	game with the desire for a consistent physics, like the fan games that came after in fixing some
8850920	8858600	of the jank. And so it's available for free. Uh, basically what it is converted the game from the
8858600	8866920	original multimedia fusion to project, to the U the U two engine, which apparently is also referred
8866920	8873400	to as I want to be the engine. So, uh, kind of fun. They've been using that for a lot of the
8873400	8880280	different fan, um, games, which there are quite a few of, and, um, apparently it is officially
8880280	8884840	endorsed by the original creator as well, calling it the perfect package for anyone that wants to
8884840	8891800	try the game out in 2020. So, uh, definitely go track it down, but, uh, yeah, pretty, pretty
8891800	8895960	exciting, especially with it right around the corner. Yeah. Or probably being featured in,
8895960	8901160	I know they have the fan game. I want to be the fan game is in, um, games done quick.
8901160	8905160	So there's usually one or a few of these that are featured each year.
8906280	8910200	Nice. Good note to end on. Cause I know that game's come up quite a few times on this show.
8910200	8914920	It's kind of cool to see a remaster after all these years too. So yeah. Very cool. All right.
8914920	8919480	Well, that was our last slotted story for tonight. We will take a trip to the listener round table.
8919480	8923400	If you guys have any questions or things you want to add in our chat room, now's a great time over
8923400	8928200	twitch.tv slash a VOG network. And I'll check in on emails in just a moment, but I want to address
8928200	8933240	this round table questions already came in from no one special. Who's saying what's I know. What's
8933240	8937880	the best game that came out this year is the easy go-to question, but I want to, what's the worst
8937880	8942760	basically. I'm going to hold onto that question actually. Uh, no one's special, sorry. And just
8942760	8948280	kind of instead tease next week, since I anticipated it'll be another slow news week with
8948280	8953160	new years and everything, although anything can happen next week, we will talk about our favorite
8953160	8957720	games of the year. You'll notice the wording I use there is not the best games of the year. It's
8957720	8962280	our best games of the year. We will talk about that. And just for, you know, in special, we will
8962280	8967080	talk about the worst as well. Um, although I honestly, nothing is jumping to the front of my
8967080	8970600	mind, but I'm sure if I check my history of some things I've looked at, I'll find something where
8970600	8973800	I was like, Oh yeah, I didn't care for that. So we'll get into that. So I'm going to tease that
8973800	8981160	for next week. We will do that. Um. Something, and this was completely my bad. We never did do
8981160	8985160	predictions this year. And that was my bad because I kept putting it off in January and then it
8985160	8991960	never happened. And then who could have, we did. I thought we didn't. Did we swear we did. Well,
8991960	8997560	I was going to say the Darth Vader tin. We did that this year. I thought we didn't do it this
8997560	9003640	year. Now we did because the previous year I had re I'd stuck the ones from the previous year in
9003640	9009160	there as well. My thought was it's going to have the previous year stuff still in it. So I was
9009160	9014440	going to open it anyway. Yeah, it should have. Yeah. All right. Well then we'll open it and
9014440	9019320	we'll see, maybe I'll open it and I'll go, it's fucking nothing, but we'll see. I thought, yeah,
9019320	9023640	SG100 Matt says we didn't. You see, he's with me. We, I thought we skipped it, but we'll see.
9023640	9026840	Was it, maybe you, maybe you just fucking wrote it down and put it in there.
9029720	9035080	So anyway, I would have, we will open that up next week as well. And this time we will
9035080	9039800	put predictions in next week. I don't know how I let it slip this year. I thought I let it slip,
9039800	9043640	but maybe I didn't, but we will make sure we get back on track with that for next year.
9043640	9047560	But I admit it's, it's funny because my brain is like, there's no way we could have fucking
9047560	9055560	predicted what happened this year. Like, no. Um, so it will be interesting to see for next year.
9055560	9061720	Cause you know, I'm thinking things like D did dragon con happen this year or did they put it
9061720	9065480	off or did they do a smaller one? Those are some of the interesting questions I have right now.
9065480	9073480	So, uh, we'll see. Anyway, next week. So best of, worst of, the rest of, and this gives us one more
9073480	9079240	week of holiday time to play some games and just make sure, you know, the lists are where we want
9079240	9086200	them to be. So we'll go over that next week. Um, anyway, uh, emails, uh, you guys send us emails
9086200	9091160	every week. No, they don't. No, they don't. Not tonight. Well, let me get, let me give the address
9091160	9095720	at least for next time. If you want to send us an email for use on a future show, participate
9095720	9100040	at orange lounge, radio.com is the place to send us an email. We do keep an eye on the Twitter.
9100040	9104200	I know I don't expressly read tweets here on the show. Sometimes I just respond to them.
9104200	9109960	Uh, but you could tweet us at OLR, uh, is where you can find us on Twitter. And a lot of us use
9109960	9114200	Twitter personally. This would, our soccer is kind of on there full time now. So we're all on Twitter
9114200	9119400	as well under our own accounts. Uh, I am at Mr. Rob Roberts because the spammer took Rob Roberts,
9119400	9123480	but I'm Mr. Rob Roberts. Dark soccer is that you're just at dark soccer, right? You were
9123480	9129560	able to get that name, which I have had forever. Yep. And then Loki is at Loki, OLR, right? Yep.
9129560	9135800	And everything. Although I will tell people 90% of what I talk about is still, uh, um,
9135800	9144600	supernatural fan link. So just saying, uh, mine is sassy, whatever. And I always say to myself,
9144600	9148280	don't tweet anything political, don't tweet anything. And then I do it. I can't keep my
9148280	9152760	mouth shut. I can't, I just, there's, there's a lot to say. It just happens. It just happens.
9153800	9160600	I just like, like, oops, I politicked again. Yeah. He will write something on his Twitter
9160600	9165800	and then I can't help, but write something nasty in response. I just, I can't help myself.
9166440	9171480	You know, it's funny. Okay. So first of all, I've never followed it's Twitter because it is
9171480	9177800	not a human in my brain. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but I've just been referring to calling it
9177800	9183800	the tyrant. Yeah, that's fair. Anyway. Uh, I, I read a great idea somewhere that was,
9184920	9190360	if you forgot, if you had one of those, um, Christmas candy calendars that you can like
9190360	9194920	pop out all the, is that what they call them? They're called advent calendars. Okay. Yeah.
9194920	9200680	And if you forgot to use that this year, if you start, I think it was today or yesterday,
9200680	9205880	it can now be a countdown to the inauguration. So you can down for that.
9209480	9213640	Oh man, such a good idea. I feel like I could have capitalized on that.
9213640	9217960	So dark soccer, you may not celebrate Christmas, but you can celebrate that.
9219160	9224440	I celebrate, I celebrate gift-mas. Yeah, that's fair. That's fair. By the way, Rob,
9224440	9230760	and I, I know I tagged you in this, but, um, but Dan saw how disappointed I was that we couldn't
9230760	9239160	have a gay Joomis. Yeah. And so he tried like four different places to try to get me Chinese food.
9239160	9244760	And then last night, bless him, bless his heart in the positive Southern sense,
9245720	9251720	he got me Chinese food and I'm still eating it today. There was a feature in the local paper
9251720	9256120	about restaurants open on Christmas day. And there seemed to be a lot more this year,
9256120	9259800	but it was, it wasn't stuff in suburbia where you and I are, it was stuff downtown.
9259800	9263880	Like, um, Bombay, the Indian place apparently was open on Christmas. I never knew they were
9263880	9267080	open on Christmas. Apparently they're open every Christmas. I'm like, well,
9267080	9270200	shit. That's what dark soccer and I need to change our tradition to Indian food.
9271400	9277720	You know what? Hey, it's an Asia. So, uh, and then I think there was,
9277720	9282040	there's a lot of places downtown that, that are open, uh, on credit. Cause a lot of restaurants
9282040	9290040	need the business. It's really sad, but it's true. You know, it's so, it's so sad. Um, but, uh,
9291560	9298680	I, I just, I don't, I don't know, just this whole thing just got me. Like I did not have
9298680	9303640	a good Christmas. Dan wasn't into it. It feels like it didn't happen. I didn't,
9303640	9307320	I didn't go see my dad. I didn't see Alan's family. Like it just feels like it didn't
9307320	9315320	happen this year for me. The other thing too, is that, you know, Dan's mom died at the beginning
9315320	9324920	of the year and you know, my dad died and it just neither of us were really in any kind of spirit
9324920	9329640	for it. You know, I hear you. It's been, and I think that's okay. I think if Christmas for you
9329640	9334120	was just a mental health decompression, I don't want to adult today kind of day.
9335080	9342040	I think that's totally fine. That was it. I didn't want to think or exist. I mean,
9342040	9347880	and by exist as like, I didn't want to participate in living. Yeah. I mean,
9348680	9354280	I guess that makes sense. You're not saying it in a, in a alarming way. You're saying it in a,
9354280	9363080	I, today I don't exist to anyone but me. Yeah. It was just like, I, I took myself out of the
9363080	9367560	equation. Yeah. I'm a ghost today. You don't see me. This sheet over my body, this blanket means
9367560	9377000	you don't see me. I'm John Cena. You can't see me. So anyway, I actually, you want to know,
9377000	9383160	it's funny. I'm working on Supernatural fan fiction, right? You tweet about it a lot, right?
9383480	9395800	I put out published 25 chapters in a month. Dang. That's good. And I wrote three chapters
9395800	9401400	and published them in three days. Nice. And I have another one written that I haven't published
9401400	9408680	and I'm almost done with another. Busy, busy. Yeah, but that's how much, how little I've
9408680	9412760	wanted to participate in the real world right now. But I understand you got to do what you
9412760	9417800	got to do. I've been, I've honestly been losing myself in work, but in a good way. Like I, I
9417800	9420840	literally enjoys the thing. I get to work on creative projects and stuff. So I've just been
9420840	9426200	kind of like going in that and I'm just like, I am happy with this. The only thing, the only thing
9427720	9431640	is some of the toys that I get to use at work. I'm like, God, I wish I had this for all our,
9431640	9436200	cause I've actually, I have access to creative cloud. I have all of Adobe stuff. So I'm like,
9436200	9439880	I want to also has access to creative cloud. Oh, do you, do you have it for yourself? I
9439880	9444200	didn't know that. Yeah, cause I still do freelance. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. That's nice.
9444200	9449240	So if you ever need to use, I can't have it installed on your computer,
9449240	9455080	but you can come over and use premiere or anything. So, um, and by the way, um, back to
9455080	9463240	my fanfic thing, if you want it, message me on, uh, Twitter at dark Sakura and I will provide you
9463240	9468040	with a link. Sounds good. All right. Well, I guess we're getting to that wrap up time, uh,
9468040	9471800	here at the show. So I want to thank everybody for checking out our show tonight, whether you
9471800	9475640	were here live or you are participating on the podcast feed. Uh, thank you so much for listening
9475640	9480760	to our show. Uh, a nice word, uh, about the show. Word of mouth goes a long way. Tell a friend or
9480760	9483720	two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has
9483720	9488680	a voice, but without the voices here, uh, we've got nothing to say. Uh, and you know, as I
9488680	9492520	mentioned earlier in the show, it's really you guys that have kept us going for 18 and a half
9492520	9497720	years throughout all of this and this craziness. Um, we don't ask for your money, but if you do
9497720	9502040	feel so inclined to support the show in that kind of way, um, it, it is very helpful and helps us
9502040	9506440	to maintain the business, uh, side of things. So a big thank you for the bits and the subs.
9506440	9510600	I'll acknowledge those after the program, but I also want to say a quick shout out to the online
9510600	9516120	store. Um, so if you want to check out some online merch, go to vog network.com slash shop,
9516120	9520200	and you can check out some t-shirts and some stickers so you can make anything in OLR piece
9520200	9524120	of merchandise, but make sure you have permission. Don't go, don't go sticking it on archaic phone
9524120	9528760	booths and things like that. That's vandalism. Uh, but, uh, you can get stickers and, and there
9528760	9532760	will be more to come in the new year. We're going to try to slowly trickle out some things there
9532760	9538760	on the shop. So appreciate, uh, all the support there as well. Um, otherwise I think that does it
9538760	9543640	and it's time to get everybody's final thoughts. The last final thoughts of 2020, the next time
9543640	9550040	we come to you 2021, sadly, new year's day is not going to magically fix all of our problems,
9551000	9555320	but we see the light. The real year starts on January 24th.
9555320	9561480	I well, and, and even more so when I can get the jab quite fresh six weeks after I get the jab,
9561480	9568440	quite frankly, but, uh, yes, uh, we'll be, we'll be, there's lots to look forward to in 2021 and
9568440	9574360	we'll put it at that. So let's get everybody's final thoughts for the night. Um, Loki,
9574360	9577800	I'll start with you. I'm just going to continue working on my game,
9578760	9582600	hopefully make progress, more progress than I did release it in 2021.
9584440	9589560	It will definitely be released in 2021. I owe you a pizza and probably January. I'd
9589560	9593880	see most likely January. I just want to rush through green levels, but you don't rush. Like I,
9594840	9599880	I just want to get the animated tiles to look awesome to saying, I know the listeners are
9599880	9603720	going to yell at me, but seriously, if cyberpunk has taught us anything, if you need to tell
9604040	9609640	February, take till February, you know, take, I can't patch a card. Exactly. Cause you've
9609640	9613640	got people that now, now this is becoming more than a, Oh, I'll download it and play it. This
9613640	9618440	is becoming a, I want the collector's edition from Loki. So you got to get it right, buddy.
9618440	9623320	Well, I got to get suppliers for that stuff anyway. So that may take time. All right. Fair
9623320	9628680	enough. Fair enough. All right. Um, so let's move on to, uh, I'll go, I'll go my final thought. Um,
9628680	9631720	I don't, I don't have a lot cause I think I already kind of gushed earlier in the show,
9631720	9635560	but again, just a big thank you to everybody who supported us throughout this crazy year.
9635560	9643320	And, um, I look forward to 2021 and the hopefulness that 2021 brings and, uh,
9643320	9650360	the renewed sense of I'm going to have a list of things I want to do. And now I'm going to do them
9650360	9656200	because if 2020 taught me anything, it's that one day I might not. So I'm going to do my
9656200	9661960	damnedest to try to get them done in 2021 when it's safe to do so. Uh, dark soccer,
9661960	9670040	your final thought. I don't know. Uh, if you can be anything,
9670040	9679080	be kind. And if you can't be kind, be Batman. Working on it. Have a great week, everybody.
9679080	9683880	Happy new year. Be safe. I mean, I shouldn't tell you things like don't drink and drive
9683880	9688440	cause you shouldn't be going to parties where there's drinking anyway. Um, but make good
9688440	9692680	choices. We'll leave it at that. Um, have a great week. There, there is still a pandemic.
9692680	9698520	You wishing it away doesn't change it. Um, so make good choices and, um, let's be here to party
9698520	9703960	when we all get vaccinated in 2021. Have a great week, everybody. Good night. Happy gaming.
