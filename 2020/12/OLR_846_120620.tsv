0	13560	This week on the 30 Second Homebrew Report, Nintendo adds two convenient means for data
13560	17160	access which hackers are no doubt already using to attempt data manipulation and security
17160	18160	bypasses.
18160	21480	The two features, those being wireless QR code and web server based image and video
21480	25740	delivery and direct USB connections are pretty damn convenient so it benefits everyone except
25740	27400	Nintendo's own security team.
27400	29240	That's all for this week's 30 Second Homebrew Report.
29240	32400	Now it's time for Orange Lounge Radio with your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and
32400	35240	Loki to talk more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right
35240	37240	now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
37240	44680	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where
44680	46520	every gamer has a voice.
46520	53960	It is another edition of Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 846 of our
53960	58160	show for this December the 8th of 2020.
58160	62920	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me tonight are my co-hosts, although the video seems
62920	67280	to be messing up which is strange but we'll get that fixed, say hello to DarkSakura or
67280	68280	Jamie Summers.
68280	69280	Hello.
69280	70280	Hi, how are you?
70280	71280	I'm alright.
71280	72280	Good.
72280	73280	It's been a day.
73280	81460	Yes, yes and now it's coming on over to the show here but that's alright because I'm having
81460	85180	massive video problems and we can't see you yet but we will get that fixed.
85180	86180	Really?
86180	89160	No, it's not your guys' fault, it's something weird on my side, I'm not sure what exactly
89160	92140	is going on but I will fix it.
92140	97980	Don't worry, mama will fix it but we missed you last week but I hope Dan had a great birthday.
97980	99760	He did.
99760	108880	We had a chocolate orange cake thanks to Becky and played some games and some pinball and
108880	114040	really just hung around and had cake, there was cake and it was not a lie, it was absolutely
114040	115040	delicious.
115040	116040	Nice.
116040	121160	So I just realized what is wrong and why it's not working on Discord and this is a little
121160	124720	bit of a vulnerability tonight so I have to do some fixing live on air here.
124720	129960	For some reason, we are all in the public chat tonight, not the private chat.
129960	132780	So anyone could join this show at any moment.
132780	138500	So I'm gonna ask my co-host to please switch to the other channel right now and that's
138500	145540	the joy of doing live radio but it also explains why all of a sudden my Discord was like, I
145540	149940	don't see this window because we were in the wrong chat room.
149940	154500	I wasn't paying attention, I just joined a chat that Jamie was in.
154500	155500	You're fine, it happens.
155500	159140	Yeah, I wasn't paying attention, I just joined a chat.
159140	161620	It's fine, it's kind of funny actually.
161620	166020	I know the whole, so we do tape live of course every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network,
166020	170500	twitch.tv slash vog network, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after
170500	175980	the Bobby Blackwell show and the chat is lighting up going, OMG, OMG, we missed our chance.
175980	179220	We could have jumped in there and taken over the show.
179220	181780	Orange Wright says accidental guest star.
181780	184380	Fifth Dream says we could have all been famous.
184380	187620	Bobby Blackwell says it's funny now that it worked out.
187620	192260	Bobby's pointing out he has special privileges but he will not be using them or he will find
192260	195300	the privileges revoked.
195300	197940	We'll go record on a different discord.
197940	199940	But anyway, no, I'm teasing.
199940	202500	Anyway, hi, so now we got all that taken care of.
202500	205300	That's part of the joy of taping live is that sometimes there's a little mess ups.
205300	209340	I actually kind of like that because that was a little clue that something was wrong
209340	212340	and it told us that, hey, we got to go to the other channel.
212340	215660	So it's interesting, human proof.
215660	216660	I love it.
216660	219980	All right, anyway, also joining us of course, Techmaster Loki.
219980	221340	How are you, Loki?
221340	222340	I'm doing good.
222340	223420	I'm overly full.
223420	229460	I made White Castle burgers, well, like homemade White Castle burgers, and I ate way too many
229460	230460	of them.
230460	231660	Now, here's kind of regretting it.
231660	232660	Here's the thing.
232660	235700	I finally tried White Castle for the first time because remember, this is one of those
235700	239860	things that doesn't exist in California, like Waffle House and countless other.
239860	243300	I was going to say Cracker Barrel, but that's not true anymore.
243300	244300	They finally built those here.
244300	245300	Steak and Shake.
245300	247380	They were here for like two minutes and then they were gone.
247380	249220	There's still one in LA.
249220	250220	Who is there?
250220	251220	Northern Northern.
251220	252220	Yeah.
252220	253220	Yeah, downtown LA.
253220	257100	There's a lot of stuff in the rest of the country we don't have in California.
257100	258420	So White Castle is one of them.
258420	263780	So I had it for the very first time when I was in Las Vegas, of all places, apparently
263780	264780	has one.
264780	266400	But Las Vegas is a great place for food.
266400	271300	And this was just like a year, no, it had been over a year ago because it was pre-COVID
271300	272300	and all this stuff.
272300	274340	Maybe it was last fall, last spring.
274340	278700	Whenever I went and saw the Gwen Stefani show, we went to White Castle for the first time.
278700	280540	I thought it was disgusting.
280540	282040	I thought it was disgusting.
282040	284220	I can't stand the way they cook the burgers there.
284220	285880	They're like steam cooked.
285880	286880	That is not the way.
286880	288620	I don't need wet, sloppy meat.
288620	291240	And no wonder only stoners like it.
291240	293640	It wasn't like that at all.
293640	295320	I was tempted.
295320	301760	The reason why I made them is because I bought last week these TGI Friday sliders and they
301760	302760	were just kind of eh.
302760	305100	They look like they're better than the White Castle ones.
305100	310040	I bought the Frozen White Castle ones before and they weren't very good.
310040	312600	They're all like soggy, like you said.
312600	317120	So I looked for a recipe while I was at the store today so that I could make some.
317120	318600	And I mean, it turned out really good.
318600	324040	It's just that I chopped up a whole large onion over the whole thing.
324040	328480	And so I like onions, my family, not so much.
328480	332760	And so it was a little too oniony for them.
332760	336960	I thought it was great though, but the next batch I make just won't have that layer of
336960	337960	onions on top.
337960	340520	I thought that's kind of what makes White Castle burgers anyways.
340520	345240	It might have been OK if it was cooked your way, like in an oven as opposed to steamed.
345240	346920	I think that was the part that turned me off the most.
346920	352620	I was like, and the chat is all yelling at me, telling me how wrong I am, y'all, whatever.
352620	354000	You know, here's the thing.
354000	358520	I'm glad that the California thing is in and out compared to that, because as overrated
358520	363520	as I think in and out is, it's like I would never wait 12 hours in a line or whatever
363520	366720	those people were doing in Colorado.
366720	369640	I agree with Bobby that Crystal is better than White Castle.
369640	370640	I will die on that hill.
370640	371640	I don't know if I've had Crystal.
371640	374420	I don't think I've had that.
374420	378400	Crystal is definitely more of a Southeastern kind of thing.
378400	383680	They're not doing that great financially, but you know, I grew up with Crystal and eating
383680	388880	corn pups and little tiny corn dogs and they had little tiny donuts too.
388880	389880	It was awesome.
389880	392880	It's just, you know, the best micro food.
392880	394940	That sounds like A&W a little bit.
394940	400220	Like if, well, I mean, almost all of them are combined with KFC now, but if you can
400220	404800	find an A&W standalone, there are some out there and that's the kind of stuff they have.
404800	408220	Did you know, fun fact, I didn't know this till recently, A&W started in Sacramento where
408220	409220	our show is based.
409220	410220	Did you know that?
410220	411220	I actually did know that.
411220	412220	Yeah.
412220	413220	No, I never knew that till recently.
413220	414220	I was like, oh, that's fun.
414220	416260	And I'll tell you where I was when I learned it.
416260	419100	In the mall that I worked at in Mobile, Alabama.
419100	420100	Yeah.
420100	424700	One of my friends was a manager there and she, you know, it was actually when I was
424700	427660	going to be moving out here, she's like, oh yeah, that's where the company started
427660	428660	at.
428660	429660	Really?
429660	430660	Yeah.
430660	433620	There's like even old ones out there and they're not in a mall.
433620	434620	What?
434620	440180	I think the most famous thing that was started in Sacramento, okay, and I'm in this mindset
440180	441180	today.
441180	443740	Yes, we are a video game show, but you know what tangents, they happen.
443740	444820	Well, sure.
444820	446220	There's that band.
446220	449780	But I was going to say, because there's a meme going around on Twitter right now that
449780	456980	is, um, describe how old you are with the name of a store.
456980	461060	And a lot of people are saying Montgomery wards, uh, Mervins.
461060	463020	I thought Alan's answer was perfect.
463020	464020	Gemco.
464020	465020	That's a great one.
465020	466020	Merchandise.
466020	467020	What's that?
467020	468020	Service merchandise.
468020	470020	Oh, I didn't even know that one.
470020	471020	It became best.
471020	472020	I think.
472020	473020	Oh, best.
473020	474020	Oh, that's another one.
474020	477100	Um, but I, my answer was Mervins and wine stocks.
477100	478900	My mom's two favorite stores.
479020	480020	Yeah.
480020	481020	That's a, that's a good one.
481020	482740	And wine stocks is another Sacramento thing.
482740	487940	But here's the answer that is being said, uh, that I caught that is a Sacramento icon
487940	491120	tower records was started in Sacramento.
491120	495740	That's why you have, um, down in the old, not an old town, downtown, you have the tower
495740	496740	theater.
496740	497740	Yeah.
497740	498740	The tower cafe.
498740	499740	That's all right there.
499740	503260	The tower records started in the back of the drug store that was there.
503260	504260	Technically not gone.
504260	505740	They still have tower records.
505740	506980	It's just an online site now.
506980	507980	Yeah.
508060	511220	And I think they have standalone still in other countries where it was kind of like
511220	515100	franchised out, but it is, it does not exist in the way that it used to here in the States
515100	519420	because obviously a lot changed with, uh, the record industry when everything went digital.
519420	523980	I think another way I could age myself is Virgin mega store on market street in San
523980	525220	Francisco.
525220	531500	That was, uh, like that was going, that was going to the Mormon temple for me.
531500	532500	Okay.
532500	533500	That was Salt Lake city.
534500	541980	That was the motherland gay first department store, which was more Southern.
541980	542980	All right.
542980	543980	Yeah.
543980	545300	Let's get into video games.
545300	547600	Let's talk about the kickoff topic for tonight.
547600	549740	We have a big event in games this week.
549740	554260	It's kind of like the, it's become the winter E3 over the years of sorts that game awards
554260	555320	are happening this week.
555320	556740	They're happening on Thursday.
556740	561660	Um, I just found out they're earlier than usual, so I may not be able to do it live.
561660	562900	It's four o'clock Pacific.
563300	566780	So it's seven o'clock Eastern, but that's to be a little more worldwide friendly, but
566780	568700	it sounds like it's even earlier than that.
568700	571820	It's says they have a pre-show starting at three 30 Pacific.
571820	575660	So that's when they're going to have five world premiers in there.
575660	580540	So five premiers during the pre-show during the pre-show plus a musical performance.
580540	584300	I have to plug this by the way, at the top of the show, because I think everybody is
584300	585760	aware dark soccer.
585760	588440	You may not be cause you weren't here last week cause of Dan's birthday.
588440	593440	But speaking of premiers, we have one for you on OLR tonight, dark soccer.
593440	596460	You actually do know, cause I told you before the show, but the X prize.
596460	605520	So so our pal YYR has sent an eight minute pixel poops direct that we're going to be
605520	607000	airing during the show tonight.
607000	608840	I only know that's what it's called.
608840	609840	I haven't seen it.
609840	612400	I promised YYR I would not watch it.
612400	617280	So I don't know if he's going to announce a pixel poops thing on steam.
617280	619600	That's my steamy poop.
619600	620600	That's my guess.
620600	621600	Steamy poop.
621600	622600	That's my guess.
622600	625040	That's some cool steamy shit.
625040	626440	There may be something else to it.
626440	627440	I don't know.
627440	629160	So we're going to, we're going to find out live tonight.
629160	632080	We're going to do that after classic game of the week.
632080	638740	So, so how about that y'all the, the pre pre game awards pre-show here with our own reveal
638740	643280	coming up later in the show, we love YYR for sharing his goodness here, creator of the
643280	646040	fabulous game, super multitasking, if you haven't played that yet.
646040	649040	So we'll be doing that after classic game of the week, a little later in the show, that's
649040	653000	where we used to do video segments before I got lazy and stopped making them.
653000	654000	So thank you.
654000	655000	Yeah.
655000	656000	I remember that.
656000	657000	Yeah.
657000	660400	Did you know also next week is our two year anniversary of being on Twitch, give or take
660400	661400	nope.
661400	666000	I did not know that even though our show started back in 2002 and we were on, you know, shout
666000	668200	cast, which was got in a variety of ways.
668200	669960	Some people pulled it in through iTunes.
669960	671940	Some people pulled it in through win app or whatever.
671940	675100	The tune in app was really popular towards the end.
675100	679580	Even though we were on that for years and years, we made the move to Twitch two years
679580	680580	ago.
680580	685180	Well, for the second time we moved to Twitch because remember we were on Justin TV in those
685180	686980	years I lived in that house out in Rancho.
686980	687980	We use the garage.
687980	693080	I remember that we were on Justin for a little bit, but anyway, in its current form, we've
693080	695580	been on Twitch TV for two years coming up next week.
695580	696580	So pretty cool.
696580	697580	All right.
697580	700660	Anyhow, I'm sorry, Loki, we were supposed to talk about the game awards, but I had to
700660	703980	derail with our own announcement, but please tell us a little bit about what we're going
703980	706960	to be expecting on Thursday.
706960	712140	So we're going to get a pre-show that they're going to start at looks like three 30 Pacific
712140	718540	or six 30 Eastern with already within just the pre-show and it's going to have five world
718540	719780	premieres.
719780	722260	So we'll have to see what that means.
722260	726580	And then of course, during the show, I'm sure there'll be a lot more than that, but that's
726580	727580	kind of crazy.
727580	732420	So it's going to be hosted by Sydney Goodman for the pre-show.
732420	737380	And then during the actual show, we know that there's going to be an appearance by Reggie
737380	741660	Fils-Aime, who's going to be a presenter for the show as well.
741660	744860	I'm not sure what category he's presenting, but that'd be pretty interesting.
744860	751200	I think they've already let him do game of the year in the past, but maybe actually no,
751200	754260	maybe not because maybe there was a perceived Nintendo bias if he did that.
754260	756220	So maybe this will be the year he gets to do game of the year.
756220	760500	I honestly can't remember, but I could see where they might be afraid of a Nintendo bias
760500	762500	if they let him do game of the year previously.
762500	766660	So maybe he'll do it this year now that he is technically no longer in the game industry
766660	767660	at that level.
767660	768660	Yes.
768660	769660	I know there's GameStop board of directors.
769660	770660	That's a very different thing.
770660	771660	Yes.
771660	775060	And then, uh, apparently they're going to have a, one of those premieres that we're
775060	777400	going to see is the next dragon age.
777400	782380	They're going to have a special look, um, at the game wards, which I I'm assuming is
782380	786540	a little bit more substantial than they did during the end seven stuff.
786540	789140	I think that's when they were showing off all that.
789140	793420	So, so yeah, we'll, um, have to check it out.
793420	795700	It's just a few days away.
795700	796700	Yeah.
796700	797700	Very excited about that.
797700	802420	Um, any yesterday was unofficial dragon age day.
802420	805660	There was some crazy stuff though, but we'll get to that later in the show.
805660	806660	It's coming up.
806660	807660	Yeah.
807660	810740	When I say BioWare, there was some crazy shit that went down this week, but we will get
810740	811740	to it all in good time.
811740	812740	All in good time.
812740	815380	Um, but, uh, big announcements for game awards.
815380	819760	I mean, I I've been calling it kind of like winter E3 because, you know, Jeff's done a
819760	826460	really good job ever since he kind of took over what spike TV kind of had, um, that thing.
826460	828180	And he tried to really legitimize it.
828180	832380	And I would say, you know, we've, we've been critical of the process sometimes, but the
832380	837580	result where we're at now in the year 2020, or at least, you know, or I should say 2019,
837580	842620	the last one we've actually seen far better than any gaming award show we've really seen
842620	843620	to the present.
843620	846620	Jeff has really transformed the show in, in a great way.
846620	849260	And he's been getting some great game exclusives.
849260	855600	Let's not forget last year's game awards gave us the huge reveal of the name Xbox series
855600	861200	X and what it looked like and the actual reveal of that console, which people were not expecting
861200	862260	that early on.
862260	870580	That was a huge deal could, could we see the often rumored switch pro jump out at us?
870580	871580	This game awards.
871580	874340	I don't want to set expectations at an unreasonable level.
874340	877140	I'm just asking hypotheticals expect nothing.
877140	882060	And you'll always be pleasantly surprised, but any thought could, could Nintendo drop
882060	884620	a huge bombshell on that level?
884620	885620	Any thoughts?
885620	886620	Loki?
886620	890220	I mean, there could always be the new, uh, sure.
890220	891220	Why not?
891220	895580	Um, I don't know what huge announcements they would have.
895580	901340	I mean, maybe, I don't know, because maybe I'm trying to think of something like at the
901340	907220	caliber that they would probably do other than like a direct of their own, um, maybe
907220	912820	a new trailer for the super Mario 3d land or world that they're doing, how they're re-releasing
912820	916700	with some additional content, maybe we'll do something for that.
916700	919780	Maybe they'll put out a fifth Pikmin game.
919780	924820	Um, I could see, you know, Nintendo, I feel like has always been pretty good with the
924820	925820	game awards.
925820	929580	And, and Jeff always, you know, had a great relationship with Reggie Fils-Aime previously.
929700	932900	And I don't see why that hasn't continued with Doug Bowser at the helm now in America.
932900	937020	Um, you know, they, they did a real deep dive on Zelda Breath of the Wild when that was
937020	938020	still anticipated.
938020	942460	Um, maybe we might see some additional footage of Breath of the Wild 2.
942460	944020	It has been quite a while.
944020	947660	Um, I know we're not really expecting that until maybe next holiday, but that would be
947660	949060	quite a treat.
949060	956340	You know, I, what first party games do we know are happening that we've seen footage?
956340	957340	Okay.
957340	958620	There's the Mario 3d land.
958660	962380	So there's, which, which technically we've seen before because it's on Wii U, was on
962380	963380	Wii U.
963380	967700	What Nintendo games at this point do we know are happening and we've seen footage.
967700	968700	Okay.
968700	970500	Breath of the Wild 2 is one of them.
970500	972700	Metroid Prime 4 is not one of them.
972700	973700	We just know it's happening.
973700	975100	We have never seen footage.
975100	982780	Um, there's not a lot, so that's kind of why I'm like, Nintendo might use this opportunity
982780	987380	because yes, they could do their own direct, but this would give them the opportunity to
987380	991420	have a very big audience because you know, the game awards gets, you know, everywhere
991420	995900	and it would kind of relieve the pressure of needing to announce 20 different things
995900	999980	or 10, even 10 different things, five different things by just doing one big thing at the
999980	1000980	game awards.
1000980	1003740	Um, that could be very interesting.
1003740	1006820	Maybe they will announce that there will be a tournament they're going to not cancel in
1006820	1007820	the future.
1007820	1009460	I couldn't resist.
1009460	1010460	Sorry.
1010460	1011460	It's, it's pretty fucked up.
1011460	1013420	We'll get into that later in the show.
1013460	1017620	Uh, I don't know.
1017620	1023420	Um, it would be a good idea for them to announce something because they have a different audience.
1023420	1030020	I think, you know, if you're trying to kind of sway people to come to the Nintendo platform,
1030020	1034600	you know, the Nintendo directs are good, but it's kind of like more like I'm already invested
1034600	1035600	in it.
1035600	1037740	And so I'm curious to what's coming out.
1037740	1042900	Not necessarily, you know, grabbing the attention of someone that might not be, you know, in
1042900	1044620	the Nintendo camp right now.
1044620	1045620	Yeah.
1045620	1050740	Um, in, I don't know, you just made an excellent case on why they should reveal the switch
1050740	1051740	pro this week.
1051740	1055500	Again, I want to be very cautious about where I set the bar for expectations.
1055500	1059840	I am completely would not be a good week to announce the switch pro right before Christmas.
1059840	1061340	Like not a good idea.
1061340	1064600	I think, um, the Xbox was fine.
1064600	1065600	We know.
1065600	1066600	Yeah.
1066600	1069860	But the, but the Xbox, they announced it, but like we knew it was coming already and
1069860	1072700	they announced, we all know the switch pros coming too.
1072700	1073700	Come on.
1073700	1076060	But it's not, it's not confirmed yet.
1076060	1080100	It's not like they were, you know, saying, Hey, we have this project, blah, blah, blah.
1080100	1084140	You know, project, what, you know, Waluigi's never going to be in smash.
1084140	1089120	Um, you know, they don't have something that they're teasing, but then they're like, okay,
1089120	1090900	and here's what we're calling this console.
1090900	1093220	We've already told you kind of that it's coming.
1093220	1096460	They haven't said that they've denied that it's coming so far.
1096460	1100940	Um, I don't think we'll get an announcement for that until after Christmas, after the
1100940	1103780	holiday, because they don't want to cut into their sales immediately.
1103780	1109300	Oh, it's like, Oh yeah, I want to buy the switch for my kids and I've got it all wrapped.
1109300	1110300	It's under the tree.
1110300	1111660	Oh, Hey daddy, guess what?
1111660	1113260	Switch pros coming out.
1113260	1116180	Uh, yo, fuck Santa.
1116180	1117180	Okay.
1117180	1118180	No.
1118180	1119300	Like you very much.
1119300	1120300	All right.
1120300	1122380	You made a good case and then you immediately took that case away.
1122380	1123380	Good job.
1123380	1129940	Um, it's just like Nintendo tournament and Nike.
1129940	1130940	Okay.
1130940	1140900	Uh, but I, I like the idea of Nintendo using the opportunity to show something to an audience
1140900	1142660	they don't normally get.
1142660	1144260	I like that idea.
1144260	1147300	So show a game that might appeal to a very, very broad audiences.
1147300	1148300	It'd be interesting.
1148300	1149300	It'd be interesting to see that.
1149300	1153140	So they'll just announce that games pass is coming to the switch and we'll all be like,
1153140	1155740	Oh, you want to, Oh my God.
1155740	1157180	Wouldn't that be a mic drop?
1157180	1158180	Holy come.
1158180	1159180	Oh my God.
1159420	1160420	I can't even imagine.
1160420	1163060	Like, I re like they're, they're speculating.
1163060	1166980	And then there's living in that world where game pass is coming to the switch.
1166980	1170060	I just, that's a stretch.
1170060	1174180	Like there's a lot of reasons why I think it would work, but there's also like a lot
1174180	1178220	of things where I'm like, I don't know if that would really happen, but we'll see.
1178220	1179220	We'll see.
1179220	1180220	All right.
1180220	1184380	Um, anyhow, so we'll see the game awards scheduled to happen on Thursday.
1184380	1188940	We will be co-streaming the event because Jeff is all about getting us, you know, many
1188940	1190860	people to stream it as possible.
1190860	1194300	So you are allowed to kind of co-stream it with your own commentary.
1194300	1199040	So we are going to do that Thursday night, uh, Bobby Black Wolf will be here for sure.
1199040	1203300	Some combination of Loki and I will be here, maybe dark soccer if she's not working.
1203300	1204300	I don't know.
1204300	1208100	Uh, but that will all be Thursday night, uh, right here at VOG network.
1208100	1212700	And we try, we try to do our commentary in a, in a, in a tasteful way.
1212700	1215340	We're not going to crap on everything we see, right?
1215340	1216340	Loki.
1216340	1218620	We're not going to crap on everything we see.
1219180	1222420	I would hope that it doesn't require that for the record.
1222420	1226020	I, I work until eight 30, so, ah, all right.
1226020	1227020	So no, no dark soccer.
1227020	1229580	So, so Loki and I like paying my bills.
1229580	1230580	That's fair.
1230580	1231580	Fair.
1231580	1233300	Um, now, Ooh, good point in our chat.
1233300	1237800	Y Y R says they did tease big game pass news this month.
1237800	1238800	That's right.
1238800	1241140	Wasn't that, wasn't that control though, coming to the game?
1241140	1243540	No, there's been a tweet after that.
1243540	1246740	That was like, Oh yeah, we're just getting started.
1246740	1249220	And I think it even said something about the game awards.
1249220	1255100	Like they're going to announce another, but like, in my opinion, they could leverage the
1255100	1260400	Bethesda thing to be like Skyrim Oblivion now on game pass.
1260400	1264760	And that would still qualify as a big game drop, even though those games are how old
1264760	1267640	at this point and how many people have played them.
1267640	1271480	But I think it would still make headlines for more of the Bethesda catalog to make its
1271480	1272740	way to game pass.
1272740	1276820	So, so like that's, that's, that's my realistic place to set the bar.
1276820	1279460	The Nintendo thing is living in fantasy land.
1279460	1284620	Let's be, let's be real, but weird things have happened in this industry.
1284620	1286620	So all right.
1286620	1287660	Um, okay.
1287660	1289560	So that'll be the game awards Thursday night.
1289560	1292980	Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games we've been playing
1292980	1293980	this week.
1293980	1297540	Maybe our games of the year, maybe not, uh, dark soccer, why don't we start with you?
1297540	1299700	How was your gaming week?
1299700	1308180	It was Animal Crossing-tastic and, um, uh, I've got Fire Emblem, the, the redone in English
1308180	1309180	Fire Emblem.
1309180	1310180	I haven't started it yet.
1310180	1311180	Yeah.
1311180	1312180	I forgot that came out.
1312180	1313180	Yeah.
1313180	1314180	Yeah.
1314180	1315180	I mean, it wasn't very expensive.
1315180	1316180	Um, yeah.
1316180	1325260	A little cuphead, um, uh, mostly it's just been, um, because of, uh, some goings on,
1325260	1328060	um, you know, and with Dan's birthday and some stuff.
1328060	1332860	So a lot of Animal Crossing, cause that's still, still my jam.
1332860	1338180	Still playing in my little virtual world because it's a lot better than the one that sucks.
1338180	1339180	All good.
1339180	1340660	So when I say, were you playing your game of the year?
1340660	1342260	The answer is yes, you were.
1342260	1343260	Yes, I was.
1343260	1347700	No, no, I'm, I'm, it's, it's game of the year for me.
1347700	1348700	Absolutely.
1348700	1353620	And on top of that though, um, I actually am thinking of getting Ring Fit considering
1353620	1355140	it.
1355140	1357420	It's because it's neat.
1357420	1359340	I have it, but I had a lot of problems.
1359340	1360740	I can't get that.
1360740	1365300	I can't get the strap on to, to stay on my leg.
1365300	1366500	It keeps slipping off.
1366500	1369780	Like, I don't know what I'm, let me borrow it.
1369780	1371700	Let me borrow that top.
1371700	1372700	Let me borrow that strap.
1372700	1381260	I want to use it, but I mean, I've been, um, I, I might have mentioned this before.
1381260	1387340	I've been really putting a lot into, um, personal fitness and I weight train six days a week.
1387340	1395020	So I was looking for something fun that would supplement it either that, or I may be hooking
1395020	1397940	up to play, um, DDR again.
1397940	1398940	You should.
1398940	1399940	One of my home pads.
1399940	1400940	I miss DDR.
1400940	1401940	Yeah.
1401940	1406940	Or maybe Para Para, but that means I'd have to dig out the PS2 and everything, but look,
1406940	1412580	I have the gun show kind of, I still have, is it here in the studio somewhere?
1412580	1414180	You may or may not remember.
1414180	1421660	I have that unopened PlayStation 2 copy of like DDR extreme 2 that also has a dance mat.
1421660	1423740	So there's a brand new dance mat.
1423740	1425640	I don't even know where the hell that came from.
1425640	1426640	I can't remember.
1426640	1432380	Well, if people look behind me on cam, those that are here, we had to clean out our garage
1432380	1436260	because we put in a new floor and there's just like some of the stuff like, Oh, I forgot
1436260	1437260	I had that.
1437260	1438260	Oh, I forgot.
1438260	1439260	I had that too.
1439260	1441440	Oh, look, it's the Dreamcast dance pads, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1441440	1445840	So out of curiosity, did you carpet your garage to give it that pinball arcade feel or no?
1445840	1446840	Oh, I thought you might've.
1446840	1447840	No, no, no.
1447840	1452280	Dan was, Dan was like, yeah, we're going to put up like a brick veneer or something on
1452280	1455880	the walls and, you know, make it look kind of like old school barcade ish.
1455880	1459480	And I'm like, no, if you want to look like an old school arcade, you have to carpet half
1459480	1460480	of the wall.
1460480	1461480	True.
1461480	1462480	True story.
1462480	1463480	True.
1463480	1470040	I, and this has actually happened to me twice in my life from wall carpet.
1470040	1477040	Once I got knocked over by some asshole at, at the time it was the old Aladdin's castle
1477040	1480780	right after my little brother had gotten hit by a car.
1480780	1486120	It was that same night that, um, that we beat teenage mutant turtles with a bunch of strangers
1486120	1487620	where they kept paying for me to play.
1487620	1489600	And then they shut down the game as we won.
1489600	1496600	Um, but I got pushed into the wall and got, um, rug burn on my gene clad legs that tore
1496600	1498040	through the jeans.
1498040	1500560	The only other time that happened was roller skating.
1500560	1504240	Why did some asshole push you into a wall?
1504240	1505240	Fuck those people.
1505240	1510840	He was just a big person that didn't notice, you know, little, and at the time I was shorter,
1510840	1512800	so it was like five foot one or something.
1512800	1514360	I'm five, three now.
1514360	1517360	So yeah, still, I mean, that's still, yeah.
1517360	1522780	Um, now though, someone pushes me up, push him right back, uh, going to our chat for
1522780	1527620	some comments on a dark soccer's gaming week, uh, SGA 100 Matt talking about ring fit, uh,
1527620	1529500	saying I used it a lot during the pandemic.
1529500	1531740	It's a hard workout and really fun to play.
1531740	1534120	I lost some weight playing it earlier in the year.
1534120	1536100	Then I gained some of it back by being lazy.
1536100	1538020	Uh, Misty OLR is cheering.
1538020	1539020	Yay.
1539020	1542940	Bring out the biscuits because, uh, Para Para, uh, the home version had those pink biscuits
1542940	1546060	or you could get that knockoff version for the dream cast where they were like that ugly
1546060	1549860	green that like, yeah, right.
1549860	1552580	Uh, bonds double six says, where's the, we dance pad.
1552580	1555940	Uh, there was one of those too, but that one's a little harder to find it.
1555940	1557860	I drew the line at the week.
1557860	1558860	Yeah.
1558860	1564340	Anyway, uh, no DVR party, no DVR party or Mario.
1564340	1570340	Uh, what was DVR with Mario or whatever it was, uh, SGA 100 Matt suggesting, uh, strap
1570340	1573740	it directly onto your leg and not on workout pants or shorts.
1573740	1574860	I do.
1574860	1578140	And I was like double looping and trying to like, make sure it was like super tight, like
1578140	1580380	cutting off and it was still would like slip off.
1580380	1581380	I don't know.
1581380	1582980	I don't know if I was just doing it wrong, whatever.
1582980	1585500	I think I probably have to do it a little more like above the knee.
1585540	1592060	So it kind of puts it in place, but I just, it didn't put it like on your calf or something.
1592060	1593060	Yeah.
1593060	1594380	That's how it measures you going up and down.
1594380	1595380	Okay.
1595380	1596380	Now that's kind of annoying.
1596380	1598380	Maybe, maybe I won't play that.
1598380	1599380	Try, try.
1599380	1601980	I, I'm the only one that seems to be having problems with it.
1601980	1604540	So, uh, I would say try it.
1604540	1605540	Yeah.
1605540	1606540	Okay.
1606540	1607540	Well, all right.
1607540	1608540	I'll find it somewhere.
1608540	1609540	So, all right.
1609540	1610540	Okay.
1610540	1611540	Uh, let's move on.
1611540	1613580	Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1613620	1615340	Um, I didn't play a whole ton today.
1615340	1618460	My kids got me to play a little bit of, uh, Minecraft.
1618460	1619940	So I did play that.
1619940	1626180	I was also fighting with Microsoft because they have me paying for my realm three times.
1626180	1630980	And so they keep saying, Oh, your, your subscription's about to run out, which is weird because it,
1630980	1633220	it's supposed to auto renew every month.
1633220	1637100	And then, so I like, okay, fine, just, you know, renew.
1637100	1638540	And then, so it starts a new one.
1638540	1643460	So I found out that there was three going concurrently, which it's just, it's all messed
1643460	1644460	up.
1644460	1648180	So I finally got those canceled and hopefully they won't come back, but this is the second
1648180	1649660	month I've had to do that.
1649660	1651460	Um, so it's kind of annoying.
1651460	1654660	Um, but we were able to play a little bit and so that was fun.
1654660	1658460	And mostly this week, like I said, it's just been working on my game and stuff.
1658460	1662100	So I'm still chugging along with that.
1662100	1672020	Um, I also did power up the series X to try to, um, uh, try to acquire certain apps to
1672020	1674060	play games.
1674060	1679940	And apparently there's a lot more steps that I need to do that I, I can't do because, um,
1679940	1685540	apparently Microsoft edge doesn't come preloaded on those systems anymore.
1685540	1690980	Kind of weird, but, um, cause I thought that the Xbox had a web browser, but apparently
1690980	1695100	it does on mine and I can't find it on mine.
1695100	1696620	So go all the way down to the pins.
1696620	1697620	Yeah.
1697620	1698620	That's weird.
1698620	1699620	Maybe I downloaded it in my apps.
1699620	1700620	Yeah.
1700620	1701620	It was down in the pins for me.
1701620	1702920	But did you get it?
1702920	1706900	Did you have it on Xbox one and now you have it?
1706900	1711620	Cause like I did have it on Xbox one, but it didn't just copy things over from my Xbox
1711620	1712620	one.
1712620	1715460	Maybe my Xbox one has been disconnected from the network.
1715460	1716460	Yeah.
1716460	1717460	We'll get into it.
1717460	1718460	We'll soon.
1718460	1720620	We'll get into it soon, but to get retro arch on there.
1720620	1726820	There is a way you can get to run on the retail one, the retail side, not in the dev mode,
1726820	1732820	which we're going to talk about, but, um, it's a workaround that one of the developers
1732820	1733820	has to there.
1733820	1737800	They have to push something out and you have to download it through the browser is so they're
1737800	1740740	trying to block it or Microsoft will be blocking it soon.
1740740	1743980	So I'm trying to get past that before they do that.
1743980	1748220	Uh, Bobby is saying you do have to download the app and YYR is suggesting I might've pinned
1748220	1749460	it on Xbox one.
1749460	1753660	Maybe I don't remember doing that, but I might've, um, because I do remember, um, you could
1753660	1756980	listen to OLR, uh, before we were on Twitch.
1756980	1759860	Cause I I'd mentioned at the top of the show, the whole shout cast thing, you could actually
1759860	1760860	listen to it.
1760860	1764780	I think on Xbox one's browser, uh, I don't remember if that was that vog network.com
1764780	1767380	or if I had to use a different site to do it, but I remember doing that.
1767380	1771940	So maybe I tried searching in the apps because they have a search function to pull up apps
1771940	1772940	and stuff.
1772940	1776960	And I searched Microsoft edge, edge, whatever, nothing came up web browser.
1776960	1781560	So like, I, I can't access it, which I'm like, whatever at this point, it doesn't matter.
1781560	1784240	But like, I just thought I'd try it.
1784240	1787440	Maybe that's their weird workaround until they patched the issue is that you can't get
1787440	1789640	it right now unless you already had it, but that would be strange.
1789640	1790920	Maybe that'd be very strange.
1790920	1791920	That's a weird theory.
1791920	1792920	I know.
1792920	1793920	But all right.
1793920	1794920	Well, that's it for your gaming week.
1794920	1800260	Loki then, uh, my gaming week, um, I've been, um, playing some of the similar things I've
1800260	1804120	been talking about in past weeks, Final Fantasy 14, we get a patch on Tuesdays.
1804120	1805600	That's really exciting to get some new content.
1805640	1806640	I'm excited about that.
1806640	1807640	New dungeon, new story.
1807640	1808640	That'll be cool.
1808640	1810800	Um, continuing to play Pokemon go.
1810800	1816000	Uh, they have that event that just the, the Kalos region, uh, six generation of Pokemon
1816000	1821400	X and Y, uh, those games just got their Pokemon and Pokemon got, well, some of actually only
1821400	1822400	a handful.
1822400	1828360	It's really the starters and a few other trashy mon, uh, and you know, that's about it that
1828360	1829680	they have right now.
1829680	1833200	And uh, for me, I'm finding it's very easy to find chess spin.
1833200	1836000	Like I could probably pull up the game and there'd be two on my house right now.
1836000	1839000	Um, excuse me, Fennekin.
1839000	1843040	Uh, I, those they're around, they're not too bad to find.
1843040	1844040	Froakie?
1844040	1845040	Impossible.
1845040	1846960	Um, I had to use the radar.
1846960	1852640	I went downtown and would keep checking the phone to see if the radar showed the Froakie
1852640	1853880	shadow.
1853880	1854880	This was hilarious.
1854880	1857320	It was at an apartment complex.
1857320	1863360	I have to illegally park my car, jump out of the car, run over to where this fountain
1863360	1867120	was where the Froakie spawn, I don't know if it spawned because it recognized a pokey
1867120	1871860	stop called fountain or what, or if the pool there was enough water to cause the spawn.
1871860	1872900	I don't know.
1872900	1877560	But I get over there and there's fucking construction going on and it's all walled off.
1877560	1878560	There is no fountain.
1878560	1879860	It's just a bunch of construction.
1879860	1882440	So the pokey stop really shouldn't be there anymore.
1882440	1886320	But um, I, and I was like, I was, I was telling Shane, I was like on the phone with Shane
1886320	1889360	or texting him, telling him this entire experience as it was unfolding.
1889360	1892960	Um, and I was like, son of a bitch, there's fucking construction here.
1892960	1896560	And I just illegally parked my car and then the Froakie isn't fucking showing up cause
1896560	1901020	I was only able to see like the Eastern half of what was on the pokey stop.
1901020	1906800	I had to basically walk through the pool area like I live there and deserve to be there.
1906800	1911480	And that allowed me to get just enough to the West side that I got my Froakie.
1911480	1915320	And then after I went through all that, what happens during the quest line, a quest pops
1915320	1918600	up, catch a Froakie mother fucker.
1918600	1923680	I just caught a Froakie and now I don't have the radar anymore to help me.
1923680	1926200	So I had to go find a second Froakie.
1926200	1930700	And what worked for me, I went to, um, if you know the Sacramento area, you might know
1930700	1931700	the fish hatchery.
1931700	1935340	Look, you've got to know this over at Hazel, right?
1935340	1936960	So I was like, okay, water spawns.
1936960	1941520	Well, I was going to go to old town sack on Saturday, but then I heard the protesters
1941520	1942680	are at it again.
1942680	1944440	So I didn't want to touch that.
1944440	1945440	So I was like, where can I go?
1945440	1946440	That's not downtown.
1946440	1949440	So I was like, I'm going to go to the fish hatchery and I did, and it worked.
1949440	1950440	There was a Froakie there.
1950440	1954280	I had to walk all the way down the trail to the very last pokey stop, but there was a
1954280	1955280	Froakie there.
1955280	1957160	Uh, and so I was able to catch that for the quest.
1957160	1958680	So that made me very happy.
1958680	1964140	So, um, we're looking in chat for some of the comments as doing on her mat says I found
1964140	1965520	one in the past few days.
1965520	1970640	Oh, the interesting thing about finally catching that first Froakie, I get back in the car
1970640	1973940	and there's another shadow on my radar.
1973940	1975360	And I'm like, what's this?
1975360	1977540	And apparently it was a noi bat.
1977540	1981880	I might be saying that name wrong, but it's like the rarest of the new spawns.
1981880	1987220	And it was just over by the, um, the, the lady Gaga mirror whole downtown.
1987220	1988380	It's legit legit.
1988380	1990820	There's like, there's like all these murals cause of the wide open walls.
1990820	1995380	It's like a lady Gaga mural over by the Starbucks Starbucks, a golden one.
1995380	1996540	So it was there.
1996540	1999740	So fro, uh, the noi bat is a fan of lady Gaga apparently.
1999740	2004580	So anyway, Bobby Black Wolf says I get back in my car and the tow truck shows up.
2004580	2010060	Now, luckily I was, I was like, can I be in a white zone after six o'clock?
2010060	2011980	And it, as it turns out, no, you cannot.
2011980	2016340	I looked up the regulations later on, but I was like, I'll be back before the tow truck
2016340	2017580	gets here.
2017580	2022020	Um, so anyway, uh, that was, uh, my Pokemon go experience.
2022020	2025940	Now that lended itself to actually playing the mainline Pokemon games.
2025940	2030380	I talked a little bit about like playing Pokemon home and I've actually gotten into
2030380	2031820	that a little bit more.
2031820	2038100	Um, I loaded all of my Mon from sword and shield, uh, into the game from the Pokemon
2038100	2039220	let's go Pikachu.
2039220	2040220	I put them in there.
2040220	2046220	So I have my pokey decks in home up to about 230 or something like that, which is a shamefully
2046220	2050220	no low number when there's probably what, like 800, I think it's eight 98 altogether
2050220	2051220	right now.
2051220	2052780	Um, but it's a start for me.
2052780	2054940	So that's going to allow me to go back into sword and shield.
2054940	2059500	I've, I've actually been playing a shield and I caught maybe like 12 more things from
2059500	2061100	my decks the other day.
2061100	2067180	So it's been a slow process admittedly, but I just got obsessed with sorting my Pokemon
2067180	2069180	and organizing my Pokemon.
2069180	2071060	I made another spreadsheet.
2071060	2072640	Well, I take that back.
2072640	2077580	I stole what Shane was doing and I made a spreadsheet that worked for me from what he
2077580	2078580	started.
2078580	2081420	And, uh, and all of that to track all of my Pokemon in home.
2081420	2082820	So that was, that was kind of fun.
2082820	2084620	Um, so that was that.
2084620	2091820	The other big thing for my gaming week on Xbox game pass, uh, dragon quest 11, the echoes
2091820	2095420	of an elusive age, the definitive edition came out on Xbox.
2095420	2098660	It's the first time that the dragon quest game is out on an Xbox platform.
2098660	2100860	I didn't really realize that, but that is true.
2100860	2106160	Um, and this also came out, I believe on the PlayStation four, and these are versions of
2106160	2108300	a switch title that came out previously.
2108300	2111100	So the definitive edition was first out on the switch.
2111100	2116900	Um, and of course the game itself was out in what I think 2017 on the PlayStation four.
2116900	2122820	And if you're, if you were in Japan, the 3DS, um, so I played it a little bit on the PlayStation
2122820	2125540	four, but the game is very long and I didn't get far enough.
2125540	2130340	I got maybe 12 hours into it the first time and I've put in about the same amount of time
2130340	2134060	now on the Xbox version over the weekend, since, you know, there's nothing else to do
2134060	2136380	in the world right now, I am staying at home.
2136380	2137380	Thank you very much.
2137380	2140660	And so I'm playing, well, besides my walks, that's all I really do.
2140660	2146220	Um, and then, uh, I, I play dragon quest 11, so I'm, I'm back up almost to where I was
2146220	2148380	the first time I was through the game.
2148380	2150980	Um, I, I, I like it.
2150980	2153500	I think it's a great JRPG experience.
2153500	2159300	Um, some of my criticisms, the first time I played the game, I criticized the soundtrack
2159300	2160300	for the game.
2160300	2163700	Uh, they actually did change the soundtrack a little bit.
2163700	2169020	Um, they, instead of having the midi synthesized versions, which I don't know why they thought
2169020	2170180	that was a good decision.
2170180	2174340	I think they thought it would make, there's been a lot of strange decisions in dragon
2174340	2180340	quest 11, where they wanted to throw back to the original or be respectful to the original.
2180340	2183500	And um, that's cute, but it doesn't really work.
2183500	2188820	Like in the year 2017 or 2020, um, I like that it's an option.
2188820	2193160	Uh, you can do that, but you can go back to the synth stuff if you want, but now they
2193160	2197480	have some orchestrated versions that they do sound a whole lot better, but that leads
2197480	2200960	me to the other big problem with this game.
2200960	2204520	And that is that the soundtrack just isn't good.
2204520	2208360	Like the soundtrack's not good.
2208360	2212120	Um, and I know that's, that's weird to say about a game like dragon quest, cause you
2212120	2216920	think of like, Oh my God, the dragon quest has like iconic themes and iconic music.
2216920	2217920	Yeah.
2217920	2222400	That were written for the first dragon quest game, like 30 years ago.
2222400	2227520	It's now the 2010s, the 2020s even, because I say tens cause the game originally came
2227520	2231800	out in 2017, but, but we, we are way past that now.
2231800	2238160	And um, here's the thing, the composer, um, he's gotta be pushing what he's like 89 years
2238160	2239160	old now, I think.
2239160	2242160	So he was making a lot of this soundtrack when he was in his eighties.
2242160	2243700	And I don't want to be ageist or nothing.
2243700	2248320	Like I think it's great that he's still continuing to work in whatever and work on the games.
2248360	2252720	Um, even though he's had some weird stuff personally, but I'm really trying to just
2252720	2255360	like overlook that and, and look, focus on the game.
2255360	2259720	Um, and the reality is like, I don't know if they feel some type of onus to the guy
2259720	2264880	to like, let him continue to be the sole person that works on the series or if he has some
2264880	2271320	type of weird creative control over it, but, um, yo square, it's holding you back.
2271320	2276400	Like we're at the point where the soundtrack is holding the game back.
2276440	2281440	Um, so I really hope for Dragon Quest 12, you're thinking about mixing it up because
2281440	2288160	I'm telling you guys, the battle theme, the world theme, they get really old and really
2288160	2294640	stale because they are the only things you're hearing over and over and over and then recycled
2294640	2296660	town themes over and over.
2296660	2302280	So my fear is that the guy was only contracted to do so much work that does not fill out
2302280	2304200	a hundred hour game appropriately.
2304200	2309080	Um, sometimes you need to ask for help and I think the series needs help as it goes into
2309080	2310320	Dragon Quest 12.
2310320	2314080	Let the guy do the main theme and one or two other songs and let someone else come in and
2314080	2315740	fill out the rest of the soundtrack.
2315740	2318740	You know, look at what's happening with the Final Fantasy series.
2318740	2322800	You know, Nobuo Imatsu, I don't, I don't have a negative thing in my heart to say about
2322800	2325620	Nobuo Imatsu and he's done some great things, great music.
2325620	2329320	He stepped away from a lot of the music making for health reasons some time ago.
2329320	2333240	He still contributes tracks here and there, but for the most part, recent Final Fantasy
2333280	2336880	games, namely 14, have been filled out by other people.
2336880	2342820	And let me tell you, Soken and what he does for Final Fantasy 14 is phenomenal and he's
2342820	2346980	absolutely worthy of creating the music for the Final Fantasy series.
2346980	2352400	It doesn't lessen the value of what Uematsu has done or better or worse or anything like
2352400	2353400	that.
2353400	2358320	It's something that is able to exist and represent the brand still very well alongside what Uematsu
2358320	2359320	did.
2359320	2360800	Let someone do that for Dragon Quest.
2360800	2362680	It's time.
2362680	2367420	So I know I'm like going off on the soundtrack, but you guys, seriously, and I'm curious,
2367420	2371560	I haven't, I haven't really been reading the chat, sorry, I'm going to go back and read
2371560	2378520	some comments here in a minute, but like play the game yourself and tell me that like every
2378520	2386300	other facet of this JRPG is a superior JRPG, but then you find that there's this one element
2386300	2391260	that's like something just grates on me about this game and I don't know what it is.
2391260	2394020	And then you realize, oh, the music, it sucks.
2394020	2398940	I would, I would honestly rather listen to, to, to WAP as the background music and it
2398940	2401020	would be less repetitive.
2401020	2403460	That'd be funny.
2403460	2409420	I would honestly, so now the definitive version will allow you to mix in the Dragon Quest
2409420	2413660	8 soundtrack so you can actually play that in the overworld.
2413660	2419460	That says to me, Square knows it was getting thin and like you have to supplement it with
2419460	2420460	old music.
2420660	2422740	Hello, it's a problem.
2422740	2426820	Bobby Black Wolf says in chat, I'm an hour and a half in and I already am tired of the
2426820	2427820	battle music.
2427820	2428820	It doesn't change.
2428820	2433060	No, there's no boss music either that I've run into yet.
2433060	2436800	Quest Buster says, the thing is the Dragon Quest series is all about being traditional.
2436800	2441180	The fact that people love the series enough to make a DQ11 still as a hit, despite relying
2441180	2443700	on decades old tropes is a testament to that.
2443700	2446980	When you buy a Dragon Quest game, you have to kind of expect that.
2446980	2450860	Not saying the series can't grow, but right now that's pretty much the expectations of
2450860	2453660	what Dragon Quest is.
2453660	2462080	In my opinion, and the remake kind of shows this, you can have all that exist alongside
2462080	2467260	something modern because like, you know, you have the retro mode in this game, which is
2467260	2472420	basically the 3DS 2D portion that is something you can play standalone.
2472420	2474300	I thought I would be super into it.
2474300	2476460	I don't like it.
2476460	2479820	It's missing stuff that the 3D version has, and I didn't like that.
2479820	2483100	I didn't like that there wasn't any voice acting whatsoever.
2483100	2487500	It was, it was, so it's there if you want it, and I found that I didn't really want
2487500	2488500	it.
2488500	2492020	So I, and I think something has to be done with the music as well.
2492020	2494740	So anyway.
2494740	2495740	Let's see.
2495740	2500620	SSJ100Matt says, kind of makes you want to mute the music and find some OC remixes that
2500620	2502700	are made by fans who care.
2502700	2505100	Oh, yup.
2505100	2506100	Let's see.
2506100	2507100	Other comments here.
2507100	2511620	SSJ100Matt says, I feel like this was an issue last game.
2511620	2515220	Well, we never even got 10 here, which is a whole nother issue.
2515220	2520860	But yes, I believe nine was criticized for some similar things as well.
2520860	2521860	And then let's see.
2521860	2526860	YYR in chat says, I think the MIDI soundtrack was because the jerk music director insists
2526860	2527860	on it.
2527860	2531380	He's always done the music and it's always been MIDI across the initial releases.
2531380	2533940	Also, he is actually a jerk.
2533940	2535580	I have heard a lot of that as well.
2535580	2538780	And again, I'm really trying to separate that from my criticisms.
2538780	2543980	But all I'm saying is that those types of decisions that they feel beholden to some
2543980	2549980	sort of traditionalism, when they've allowed Final Fantasy to progress for better, 14 or
2549980	2559900	worse, 15, I don't understand why they feel they must hold it down to a certain standard.
2559900	2563260	Have that version of the game coexist alongside a modern version.
2563260	2569620	There's a lot of things about Dragon Quest XI that are very classic that I like.
2569620	2574220	The fact that it is relatively still a turn-based battle game, that they don't try to do a lot
2574220	2578980	of fancy active time battle stuff where you have to pull the trigger at a certain time
2578980	2582900	or do these, you know, push the directions.
2582900	2586220	You can even walk around the battlefield, but you don't really have to.
2586220	2588900	It doesn't really do anything.
2588900	2589900	I don't mind that.
2589900	2595300	Like that sort of traditional JRPG in that sense, I think a lot of people miss those
2595300	2596300	actually.
2596300	2599460	So none of that bothers me.
2599460	2602400	And the traditional sense of that, that's what I really like about the game.
2602400	2605700	So anyway, even though I sound like I'm very negative because I can't shut up about the
2605700	2607780	soundtrack, I do really enjoy Dragon Quest XI.
2607780	2609180	I really like the story.
2609180	2613300	I like some of the voice acting and some of the character development that goes with it
2613300	2615020	is fine.
2615020	2618140	The voice acting can be a little bit over the top, but I like what they do with some
2618140	2619140	of the characters.
2619180	2622120	Really funny, witty things.
2622120	2623980	There's this thing involving haikus.
2623980	2627780	I don't want to spoil it, but I found it, I'm like, this must have been the biggest
2627780	2630580	pain in the ass for the localization team.
2630580	2632660	And I thought it was very clever.
2632660	2637080	So there's a lot to love about the Dragon Quest XI remake.
2637080	2639680	And if you have Game Pass, download it, check it out.
2639680	2641660	Just have your Spotify ready to go.
2641660	2643380	All right.
2643380	2644380	That's my gaming week.
2644380	2645380	Phew.
2645380	2646380	All right.
2646580	2651100	By the way, before we get into tonight's gaming news, I will point out, if you would like
2651100	2654220	to have, for those of you that are watching live on Twitch, you might notice I'm wearing
2654220	2660340	a lovely blue VOG shirt with Jamie's VOG logo on the corner there.
2660340	2663780	If you would like to get a shirt, you can check it out over at the VOG Network shop,
2663780	2665780	vognetwork.com slash shop.
2665780	2670940	And we just recently added Loki's OLR pixel design.
2670940	2674860	We got a new shirt that's kind of like a baseball shirt with that on it.
2674860	2677780	So I'm curious to see how that turns out because you just bought one of those, right,
2677780	2678780	Loki?
2678780	2679780	I did.
2679780	2680780	I did last week.
2680780	2681780	Yeah.
2681780	2682780	Yeah.
2682780	2683780	So anyway, check that out.
2683780	2684780	Vognetwork.com slash shop.
2684780	2685940	Anyway, let's get into some gaming news.
2685940	2689060	Loki, you were kind of referring to this earlier, right?
2689060	2690060	Yes.
2690060	2700780	So of course, being that the Xbox One and even now the Xbox Series X and Series S had
2700780	2704220	a universal window, a UWP app.
2704220	2708260	So basically these different apps that you could download and run.
2708260	2715820	So it could be anything from applications like Twitch or even like web browsers and
2715820	2717580	other stuff like that.
2717580	2722420	You can download different things onto the system.
2722420	2727300	You may have also forgotten that starting with the Xbox One, you could also turn your
2727300	2730060	console into a development platform.
2730060	2734860	So there's a way to actually put it in dev mode and be able to download things to this
2734860	2737140	and also develop games on it.
2737140	2743420	Well, one of the things that you can download is RetroArch and RetroArch, of course, being
2743420	2748260	a emulator platform for lots of different consoles.
2748260	2754180	And at the very least in dev mode, you can actually emulate quite a few games in this.
2754180	2759420	In fact, it even emulates PlayStation 2 titles a little bit.
2759460	2768380	There's some bugs there because the kernel is still a bit early, but it does emulate
2768380	2772860	stuff really well on many of the other platforms.
2772860	2779460	They also even have a dedicated PlayStation Portable emulator as well outside of RetroArch
2779460	2781260	that you can put on there.
2781260	2784340	Can I get OLRPSP.com on it?
2784340	2785980	I don't think that website's actually up anymore.
2785980	2786980	It's long gone.
2786980	2787980	Sorry.
2787980	2788980	I don't think so.
2789020	2796020	If you go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com slash PSP, I think it's still there.
2796020	2797060	I never got rid of it.
2797060	2799540	Our site hasn't changed in like 20 years.
2799540	2800540	So I...
2800540	2801540	Yes, it is still there.
2801540	2803260	So yeah, if you want to see, it's still there.
2803260	2805380	So it's just not, it doesn't have its own dedicated domain anymore.
2805380	2806380	That's all.
2806380	2807380	Yeah.
2807380	2811100	I don't think it's, uh, it's necessarily, yeah, it hasn't been updated.
2811100	2813900	Well, it still has the feeds in there because it takes our...
2813900	2816100	Yeah, it probably still pulls the RSS.
2816100	2818900	So it probably in that aspect is still up to date.
2819420	2820420	It's still up to date.
2820420	2821420	Yeah.
2821420	2822420	So you can do all that.
2822420	2828340	Um, yeah, I don't think it has the links to the, uh, radio app anymore.
2828340	2832980	We used to have like, I think you can download and you can like get a theme and stuff too.
2832980	2834820	The theme you did was pretty cool.
2834820	2835820	Yeah.
2835820	2841020	So, um, yeah, so that does still exist, but yeah, unfortunately, yeah, you can't access
2841020	2845740	the site through there anymore, but you can play, uh, emulator games now granted in order
2845740	2850340	to do that, you have to switch between retail and dev mode in order to kind of jump between
2850340	2851340	the two.
2851340	2859940	There is a workaround to put it, uh, RetroArch in, um, the actual, uh, retail mode, but it's
2859940	2862300	a little trickier to do that.
2862300	2866780	You actually had to, there's a, a form that you filled out that I guess one of the developers
2866780	2872640	has and he basically whitelists your console for that download and you download it through
2872640	2878560	Edge on the console and you kind of bypass their storefront to get it on there, which
2878560	2881320	I'm certain is going to be patched out soon.
2881320	2884760	So, um, that's just how that works right now.
2884760	2891040	But the dev mode version doesn't necessarily, um, isn't blocked.
2891040	2896440	Still do that, um, right now, and I'm not sure I, there is a little bit of, you know,
2896440	2900040	I think you have to switch back and forth between retail and dev if you want to play
2900040	2905920	your games, like your actual retail games and stuff, but not everyone can just jump
2905920	2906920	into dev.
2906920	2907920	Right.
2907920	2909480	You have to have some sort of license to do that.
2909480	2910480	Right.
2910480	2911520	Cause that was my understanding.
2911520	2915760	Cause there's a lot of paid for license, but it's, I think it's pretty inexpensive though.
2915760	2919800	There's a lot of headlines about this story right now that, you know, for clickbait reasons
2919800	2924080	are making it sound like you can play PlayStation two games on your Xbox.
2924080	2926760	And the reality is it's not really that easy.
2926760	2932280	It just kind of sounds like, okay, the Xbox series X is basically, as we know, you know,
2932280	2937000	a type of PC it's a, it's an optimized PC for gaming, right?
2937000	2938000	It's that kind of thing.
2938000	2939000	Right.
2939000	2943400	Um, so it makes sense that certain things that were built to run on PCs like emulators
2943400	2948240	and yes, PlayStation two emulators exist on, on PC, you know what, PS three and four emulators
2948240	2949860	exist on PC as well.
2949860	2953120	Probably soon a PS five emulator just won't run very fast.
2953120	2955880	Um, somebody's probably already trying to develop one.
2955880	2957420	So all that stuff exists.
2957420	2962000	And I think it's just that, you know, by using this essentially what sounds like a sideloading
2962000	2964240	method is basically what it is, right?
2964240	2969680	You are able to run this emulator and then run the PlayStation games.
2969680	2973200	And I think people are kind of using this to take a cheap shot at Sony.
2973200	2974940	Well, I shouldn't say a cheap shot.
2974940	2980800	I think it's a worthy shot at Sony about how they drag their feet through the mud about
2980800	2985600	backwards compatibility when it comes to PlayStation, PlayStation two and PlayStation three, because
2985600	2987480	it does make an attention grabbing headline.
2987480	2992620	That's like, Hey, Xbox series X can play PlayStation two games, even though it's a lot more nuanced
2992620	2993620	than that headline.
2993620	2997760	That's my point is that it still needles Sony like, so what's your problem?
2997760	2998760	Exactly.
2998760	3003440	And the dev mode isn't necessarily so to, to get the dev mode, you have to pay a one
3003440	3004440	time $19 fee.
3004440	3007760	Um, so that's why, why are echoing some of this in chat?
3007760	3011880	Cause he's developed for, let's not forget some of his games were released on what used
3011880	3018200	to be like the XNA and the, the indie arcade and that, that stuff on the 360.
3018200	3023960	So if there's lots of guides online to, to be able to do that, um, you know, I haven't
3023960	3027720	necessarily mess with it enough yet to, um, check it out.
3027720	3028720	It would be nice.
3028720	3032080	It's kind of a nice added bonus, you know, having this console and stuff, being able
3032080	3034960	to play, um, other games on it.
3034960	3036840	I mean like, sure.
3036840	3041700	It's not like officially sanctioned by Microsoft or something, but it's still a pretty cool
3041700	3042720	thing to be able to do.
3042720	3045500	And like what other cool stuff could you do with this console?
3045500	3049780	I mean, I like that, but I get it.
3049780	3053140	That's if they shut it down, then they shut it down.
3053140	3057660	But right now it seems to be like, they're kind of not really addressing it yet, but
3057660	3063180	if it becomes a problem, maybe if like, you know, Sony or Nintendo complaints, I'm kind
3063180	3068540	of surprised somebody hasn't unleashed the beast with NES games and, and super new Tony
3068540	3072220	is, but at the same time, it does retro arch plays all that.
3072220	3073220	Okay.
3073220	3074220	So, so then, okay.
3074220	3079380	So then the headlines we're seeing about PlayStation two really is to needle Sony because they
3079380	3081380	they're leaving the NES stuff out of it.
3081380	3083340	Well, the PlayStation two let's play this way.
3083340	3086500	The reason why they're, they're highlighting the PlayStation two, because that's a hard
3086500	3087860	to emulate system.
3087860	3092020	It is, it requires that whole emotion engine, powerful, you know?
3092020	3095620	So it'll, it actually emulates GameCube very well.
3095620	3098860	So you could actually run you know, GameCube games on there.
3098860	3104060	You could run and you have zero GX or something like that, you know, lots of cool stuff.
3104060	3111220	So it, yeah, they're highlighting the PlayStation two because it starts, it can run some of
3111220	3112220	the games.
3112220	3117060	They're not perfect yet because that core is still very new, but that's the thing about
3117060	3122660	retro arch is unlike, you know, other emulators out there, this is kind of an all in one.
3122700	3125740	So you get different cores that emulate different systems.
3125740	3127740	And so it can do it all.
3127740	3131480	And each of those cores is kind of independently developed.
3131480	3135180	And so they're adding support for PlayStation two on there.
3135180	3138980	And I got you because I was going to say that, you know, when it comes to emulating something
3138980	3144060	like the NES or the Atari 2600, you could pull up a Microsoft edge browser and open
3144060	3147140	up a tab and run like a web browser based emulator.
3147140	3151260	That's going to be decent enough, decent enough where most people aren't going to be able
3151260	3152260	to tell the difference.
3152260	3153260	Right.
3153260	3154380	So maybe.
3154380	3156420	And so that does kind of lend itself to your point.
3156420	3160000	It's the fact that it's the PlayStation two, which is a lot harder to emulate than these
3160000	3161180	other things.
3161180	3165260	And the fact that it's happening on a Microsoft box, no matter the, you know, sideloading
3165260	3170860	dev mode and all that stuff aside when it's not like when Sony keeps resisting doing their
3170860	3175260	own native emulation on their own box, this is interesting.
3175260	3176260	So, yeah.
3176260	3177260	All right.
3177260	3180780	Well, I'd be curious to see if that's something you decide you're going to check out and get
3180780	3182580	into this week.
3182580	3187180	So what PlayStation two game are you looking forward to playing on Xbox?
3187180	3188180	None of them.
3188180	3189180	I'll be honest.
3189180	3196340	The PlayStation two, like if I was going to pick any of those, I mean, like mania 2d x
3196340	3197780	beat mania 2d x.
3197780	3198780	Oh yeah.
3198780	3199780	With the controller.
3199780	3200780	That'd be just perfect.
3200780	3202580	Couldn't I like map it somehow?
3202580	3203580	I don't know.
3203580	3204580	Yeah, maybe.
3204580	3209980	I mean, um, and I mean, I don't remember if those controllers I used to play, you could
3209980	3211620	play like five key with the controller.
3211620	3213700	You can play a DJ max as a controller game.
3213700	3214700	Yeah, you could do it.
3214700	3215700	Yeah.
3215700	3216700	Where are they?
3216700	3223660	Like, do they have like, um, weren't the PlayStation two, um, beat me a controller's USB or they,
3223660	3226500	um, place just the regular PlayStation two stuff.
3226500	3227940	They were regular PlayStation two.
3227940	3232420	If I recall correctly, you can probably get some type of USB device, but it would be like,
3232420	3235100	I'm going to say there's probably an adapter out there for it.
3235100	3236100	Yeah.
3236100	3237700	I wouldn't be surprised at all if that was the case.
3237700	3238700	So yeah.
3238700	3239700	All right.
3239700	3244020	Um, and, uh, YYR says you don't want to play two DX on a game pad.
3244020	3245980	It's just not two DX anymore.
3245980	3250500	You know, I thought I would dislike DJ max for kind of reasons like that, but it's okay.
3250500	3251780	Like I don't mind DJ max.
3251780	3256620	So all right, well, let's move on to a story about destiny two.
3256620	3262380	And um, this kind of has to do with how these games are upgrading to the next generation.
3263340	3270660	Destiny two right now, uh, in the X-Box universe is not series X and S enhanced.
3270660	3273420	This is important because the game is available on game pass.
3273420	3277620	So if you have an X-Box series X or S you may have downloaded the game to just kind
3277620	3281180	of, I almost did until I saw this story and I was like, wait, hold on.
3281180	3285420	Um, and the long and the short of it is, is that there is a new version of destiny two
3285420	3290860	coming out for not just X-Box X and S, uh, this week on December the eighth, but it's
3290860	3293780	also coming for PlayStation five as well.
3293780	3299000	And here's the thing, if you downloaded the old version of the game, too bad, you're going
3299000	3302060	to have to download the new version of the game.
3302060	3305540	Now there's a lot of that that kind of makes sense, you know, cause you got to get new
3305540	3310460	assets and things of that nature, but it is this very interesting sort of like, Oh, we
3310460	3314620	kind of thought with, with X-Box, you just could kind of like play the old games and
3314620	3316460	they just kind of run with the new stuff.
3316460	3318480	And to some extent that does work.
3318480	3324280	Like again, I've been playing dragon quest 11, which it's very much like a PlayStation
3324280	3331760	four or last gen era game, but it's so smooth, like 60 frames a second smooth.
3331760	3336200	The loading time is, I can't believe I'm gonna say this, the loading time in dragon quest
3336200	3339120	11 is too fast.
3339120	3340120	It's too fast.
3340120	3344060	And the reason why I say that is what they did in the original version was they had tips
3344060	3345760	on the loading screen.
3345760	3348900	And while the area was loading, you could read the tips.
3348900	3351500	You don't have time to read the tips anymore.
3351500	3355060	You can kind of see it, but it's too damn fast on the X-Box.
3355060	3358500	So this is kind of, kind of interesting in that regard anyway.
3358500	3364040	So for destiny to the next gen update on December 8th, which is technically the version 3.0.1
3364040	3369640	update, you will have to download the game again on the X-Box series X or S and the PlayStation
3369640	3370640	five.
3370640	3371640	Why is this important?
3371640	3374000	Well, some of you might have bandwidth concerns, right?
3374000	3378460	I don't know how many of y'all got a new system last month and already almost hit your bandwidth
3378460	3379680	cap for the month.
3379680	3383060	So you might be rationing things out a little bit, which is why I'm glad I didn't get destiny
3383060	3385120	two yet.
3385120	3389680	This download will be about 70 gigs in the X-Box side of things, PlayStation side of
3389680	3392720	things will be about 67 gigs.
3392720	3397160	This is interesting because Bobby was kind of talking about on his show this week, the
3397160	3403400	weird PlayStation four and PlayStation five stuff coexisting.
3403400	3405460	And sometimes it doesn't make sense.
3405460	3410780	Like let's say you put in your disc for no man's sky because you want to play the PlayStation
3410780	3412720	five version of no man's sky.
3412720	3415280	And that's how it verifies that you own the game still is by the disc.
3415280	3419420	Well, guess what, when you put in the disc, it defaults to the PlayStation four version
3419420	3420420	of no man's sky.
3420420	3422720	So you have to switch it.
3422720	3425360	Why you would want to default to that version?
3425360	3426840	Maybe because the HDR bug's still there.
3426840	3427840	I don't know.
3427840	3430160	It still happens.
3430160	3434720	And apparently he was talking about, he downloaded worms, which is the, uh, whatever version
3434720	3437600	of it is the PlayStation plus game of the month right now.
3437600	3442720	And it downloads both the PlayStation four and the PlayStation five version.
3442720	3445320	I think it was, and he'll correct me in chat if I'm wrong.
3445320	3449640	I think it was, he had to download the PlayStation four version first, then get the PlayStation
3449640	3450640	five version.
3450640	3454840	And it was like, okay, well, are these art assets for no, it doesn't, it's not pulling
3454840	3457720	anything from the PlayStation four version.
3457720	3462600	And in my opinion, well thought out, no, it's horribly thought out, which I know you're
3462600	3465720	joking, but it's, it's borderline.
3465720	3471800	I don't want to be too dramatic, but it's borderline disrespectful in this area, in
3471800	3478340	this era, excuse me, of bandwidth caps, the destiny to thing, whatever we were warned,
3478340	3479520	we were cautioned.
3479520	3482040	They did say the next gen version is coming.
3482040	3483040	Okay.
3483040	3484040	So I'm letting that slide.
3484040	3487460	I'm just warning you, you know, wait until the eighth before you grab it.
3487460	3492860	But in the case of this worms thing, when we live in this era of bandwidth caps, it's
3492860	3496420	disrespectful for the systems to be doing this.
3496420	3499280	It's not respecting the bandwidth caps that we have.
3499280	3503920	This needs to be addressed immediately on Sony's end.
3503920	3509200	And if anything like this is happening on Microsoft's end, I don't think it is to that
3509200	3510200	same extent.
3510200	3516340	Like I know with no man's sky, it's not, it's you, you just, you, you get the Xbox X and
3516340	3520180	S version because that is the box you're playing it on.
3520180	3524380	Anyway, I want to go to our chat room and see if we have any feedback on this particular
3524380	3526300	story here.
3526300	3529460	Bobby says it downloaded the PlayStation 4 version first.
3529460	3530740	I canceled it.
3530740	3535100	It added both to my queue and prioritize the PlayStation 4 download.
3535100	3540260	Dejirama S says Sony has always had shitty servers and network management.
3540260	3544100	Fifth Dream says I'm used to like getting a drink or a handful of whatever I'm eating
3544100	3545680	during loading times for some games.
3545680	3548900	And now on PlayStation 5, I keep forgetting it's too fast to do that.
3548900	3555020	Guys, yet again, yet again, I'll remind you, companies store DLC on your drive, even if
3555020	3556500	you never purchase it.
3556500	3557620	That's still a thing.
3557620	3559060	And that is also bad.
3559060	3564500	So I'm not saying the Xbox universe is completely devoid of this stuff.
3564500	3569700	And we all know about the gigantic Call of Duty installs and things like that too.
3569700	3575500	And I get it that part of this is, you know, the transforming to the new generation and
3575500	3576620	all this stuff.
3576620	3581540	But I have to needle Sony on this a little bit.
3581540	3587100	Why the fuck is the PlayStation 4 version downloading to the PlayStation 5?
3587100	3588940	Why?
3588940	3590360	What is the benefit of that?
3590360	3595420	Now if maybe I want to play that version, fine.
3595420	3597100	Let somebody opt in.
3597140	3600380	Press X to download the old version of the game and run it.
3600380	3601220	Cool.
3601220	3603020	At least I opted into it.
3603020	3609340	Why are you bloating up my PlayStation 5 with an old version of the game I don't need?
3609340	3612060	It doesn't make sense.
3612060	3620220	So Sony needs to address this like now, in my opinion, because it's again in this era of
3620220	3625220	bandwidth caps with all of our Zoom meetings and working from home and all this other stuff
3625220	3632340	that takes up our bandwidth, to have bandwidth eaten up by games where it's not needed sucks.
3632340	3635620	And I think all companies, now I know I'm picking on Sony a little bit here because
3635620	3640020	I have the most egregious example right there, but I think all game companies should be looking
3640020	3646040	at is there a way to make our installs smaller?
3646040	3649620	For example, what Cyberpunk 2077 is coming soon, right?
3649620	3651460	Isn't that this week too?
3651460	3652460	The 10th?
3652460	3653720	Same day as the Game Awards?
3653720	3657480	I hear it has a day one patch of 60 gigs.
3657480	3658600	All right.
3658600	3660160	We all knew it was coming.
3660160	3661960	I'm sure there's things in it.
3661960	3664260	They pushed the game back for three weeks for a reason.
3664260	3667560	They probably had to fix some things fine, whatever.
3667560	3672420	Did it need to be 60 gigs?
3672420	3675880	And I think a lot of devs need to ask themselves this question.
3675880	3679320	We need to ask these questions of game devs.
3679320	3686760	Again, I'm willing to let Cyberpunk slide a little bit because it is a very big triple
3686760	3690360	A game and you would expect it's going to have a large footprint.
3690360	3697120	You kind of know a lot of this going into it, but something like Worms, I don't think
3697120	3701940	you expect that same type of, you know, extra four gig download of a PlayStation 4 version
3701940	3703900	you're literally never going to play.
3703900	3705520	So anyway.
3705520	3710560	Or they should be able to handle it like PC installs where you can do, you know, just
3710560	3713400	the express install where it installs everything.
3713400	3719640	Or like, say, for example, I don't know how they necessarily do localization, like say
3719640	3723800	if they had like recorded audio for other languages and stuff like that and say, I don't
3723800	3724800	want.
3724800	3729440	Yeah, I don't need the French audio soundtrack in this, you know, allow me to uncheck that
3729440	3732480	option to save some space or in Call of Duty.
3732480	3737480	I only, and they have this, I think, but like in Call of Duty, for example, like I only
3737480	3738560	want the campaign.
3738560	3743240	I don't want multiplayer or zombies, you know, I just want to download that section.
3743240	3748920	And I think they need to chop it up with that or that way in order to be able to address
3748920	3753460	these bandwidth gaps until we live in a perfect society that has no bandwidth gaps.
3753460	3758200	So Bobby in our chat is calling out Forza Horizon on the Microsoft side as one of the
3758200	3759200	games.
3759200	3762440	And y'all know we love some Forza Horizon, but he is calling it out as one of the games
3762440	3767760	that downloads extra data you don't need, saying Forza Horizon installs all the data
3767760	3773000	for all the cars and the DLC in managed game is just the unlock key.
3773000	3778160	If the DLC is only 10 megs in the managed data list, then it's just an unlock key and
3778160	3779720	not actually any data.
3779720	3782840	Now, and he goes on to clarify, and I think a lot of you guys are probably picking up
3782840	3788040	on this, the car data, that makes sense because if your friend has the DLC and you don't,
3788040	3790440	it's kind of like Mortal Kombat 11.
3790440	3793880	Again, you're going to have all the characters in the game, because if you go online and
3793880	3797960	play online, somebody else may be able to use a character that you don't have unlocked.
3797960	3798960	Fine.
3798960	3804120	So Forza Horizon has to do that for the cars, but do you need that entire Lego continent?
3804120	3807960	Do you need all the art assets for Lego and all that if you haven't bought it?
3807960	3812560	Well, yes, you make a good point, Loki, but you know what I'm asking here, right?
3812560	3815360	If I haven't bought it, why is that downloading?
3815360	3817280	Because I'm never going to be able to use it, right?
3817280	3820920	So I think these are the questions that we need to in turn.
3820920	3825640	So I want to be fair because I did, I kind of dragged Sony a little bit there.
3825640	3828120	There's one that Microsoft can do better on, fine.
3828120	3832320	And then Nintendo just honestly, you know, just needs to look at online in general.
3832320	3837400	We got a whole other list of things they can work on.
3837400	3841360	So there's things that they can be doing better there, especially in this era of bandwidth
3841360	3842360	caps.
3842360	3846400	So let's see, other comments here.
3846520	3850560	DJ Rama SS, part of the reason why Xbox game patches are huge is because sometimes the
3850560	3854440	game is already patched and it's bringing you the full game over again with the patched
3854440	3855440	content.
3855440	3857560	That, that isn't really a patch.
3857560	3860880	That's a re-download and it should be called such.
3860880	3868560	Anyway, so enough, I kind of went on a tangent from the original Destiny 2 story, but it's
3868560	3874920	an important thing to call out in this era of the new generation of consoles, especially
3874920	3881920	when on both fronts, they are really relying heavy on the library from the last generation
3881920	3884480	to be moving these consoles forward.
3884480	3887440	And these are some important questions to be asking on all sides.
3887440	3890040	All right, let's move on to some news.
3890040	3894680	I'm hoping we can all agree as a great thing, right Dark Sakura?
3894680	3895680	In theory.
3895680	3900240	Um, but they have cast a Solid Snake in the Metal Gear Solid film adaption.
3900240	3904360	Um, I'm sorry, adaptation, my, uh, my bad.
3904360	3913080	Um, but, uh, they've, uh, cast, um, Oscar Isaac to play him, which I can, I can kind
3913080	3914080	of see it.
3914080	3919720	You know, I, I, I think I always think of Snake as someone just a little bit more square
3919720	3920720	jaw.
3920720	3921720	Does that make sense?
3921720	3926760	Like I'm thinking like, you know, an eighties Kurt Russell, you know, but, but he'll do
3926760	3927760	good.
3927760	3928800	He'll do well.
3928800	3935360	It's funny you say that when arguably Solid Snake was based off of Kurt Russell and Escape
3935360	3936360	from New York.
3936360	3938920	So it's kind of funny you say that.
3938920	3939920	Yeah.
3939920	3944000	And I wasn't even thinking about it when I said it and then I was like, oh shit.
3944000	3945000	Yeah.
3945000	3951560	Um, you know, but, but that's sort of, you know, I, I, I, I'm going to wait for, you
3951560	3953560	know, to reserve my judgment.
3953560	3954560	He's a great actor.
3954560	3955560	Don't get me wrong.
3955560	3956560	I love Oscar Isaac.
3956560	3959880	I have, I have like Poe is the best part of those new star Wars movies.
3959880	3965920	I have two, I'm looking over here because I have two, uh, Disney infinity figures.
3965920	3969920	I have a Tron one and I have Cora and I have Poe.
3969920	3971100	That's it.
3971100	3976520	So I, I, I may have a crush on Oscar Isaac, so I'm more than happy with his news.
3976520	3982980	Well, um, I'm still going to reserve a little bit of judgment to see, um, you know, when
3982980	3983980	it's out.
3984140	3991100	And again, um, I'm so iffy about video game movies cause we've either had shit or we've
3991100	3993780	had pretty good, you know?
3993780	3998840	And so, um, I'm hoping that, I mean, cause Metal Gear Solid this year, uh, as a game
3998840	4002820	series anyway, each of the games are so cinematic in and of themselves, even the very first
4002820	4003820	one.
4003820	4013500	Um, that it would be very difficult for them to fuck it up because the, the influences
4013500	4016340	there, you know, scene blocking is there.
4016340	4021660	Um, I think it's going to be about how do they squeeze it down to two or two and a half
4021660	4025280	hours or a movie size, you know, even if they let it go three hours, which is pretty long
4025280	4028680	for a movie, Titanic size movie, I doubt it will be that long.
4028680	4029680	How are they doing the whole thing?
4029680	4030680	How are they going to do it?
4030680	4032860	I think it's going to be the shadow Moses, um, story.
4032860	4033860	Okay.
4033860	4038500	I mean, the climbing of the ladder is going to be like 30 minutes as it is.
4038500	4044140	Well, it's being written by Derek Connolly who wrote, uh, uh, the rise of Skywalker and
4044140	4048220	a Jurassic world, which I haven't seen Jurassic world, but I really liked the rise of Skywalker.
4048220	4057980	Um, and, uh, the, uh, director what Jurassic world's kind of, the first one, the first
4057980	4059100	one is good.
4059100	4061180	I have yet to see the second one.
4061180	4067740	I hear it kind of, but, uh, I have, uh, rise of Skywalker is all right.
4067740	4070740	No opinion.
4070740	4073020	I thought the rise of Skywalker was, uh, outstanding.
4073020	4074020	I loved all of them.
4074020	4079700	Um, very, very strong, uh, female oriented movies.
4079700	4086860	Um, but anyway, um, he, uh, we, we get, we get him as snake.
4086860	4090100	Someone better yell snake at some point.
4090100	4094480	Some comments from our chat over at twitch.tv slash a VOG network, DJ Rama S suggests regarding
4094480	4095480	Kurt Russell.
4095480	4096900	He could be old snake.
4096900	4100020	You know, I hate to say it, but he is a little older at this point.
4100020	4103680	He's playing Santa Claus in Netflix films.
4103680	4105380	So maybe that's a good idea.
4105380	4108900	Maybe an old, how would you feel about Caruso's old snake?
4108900	4111740	I think as big boss, you mean?
4111740	4112740	Yes.
4112740	4115620	I mean, depending on the story and how much they reveal.
4115620	4116620	Yes.
4117140	4123220	I mean, I wouldn't mind him being big boss, but they, the thing is, is that he and Isaac
4123220	4127020	look nothing alike.
4127020	4129180	So I don't really see it.
4129180	4134820	I mean, like their, their facial structure, like eye socket down to mouth shape.
4134820	4135820	It's different.
4135820	4141300	So there would be no family resemblance, you know, because, well, spoiler, he's a clone.
4141300	4146540	Um, you know, if you haven't played the game 50 years ago, Questbuster and chat says the
4146540	4149460	Santa Claus role is also Russell's last role.
4149460	4150460	He's retiring.
4150460	4151780	Well, you know what?
4151780	4153300	Rick Moran has said that too.
4153300	4157220	And then he showed up in that, um, cell phone commercial with Ryan Reynolds.
4157220	4158220	So anything's possible.
4158220	4159220	No way.
4159220	4160220	Rick Moran is retired.
4160220	4165500	Oh no, I know why he did, but, but I don't think that that's a fair comparison.
4165500	4166500	Okay.
4166500	4167500	Fine, fine, fine.
4167500	4171300	Um, but well, my point is never say never, you know, it's like wrestling retirement.
4171300	4172300	Yeah.
4172300	4173300	Okay.
4173300	4174300	All right.
4174300	4178420	So the undertaker finally did given, that's probably another plot.
4178420	4183380	Um, no, actually I think it's just, he, he, he's probably tore up.
4183380	4189900	So anyway, um, so now SGA does want to say about Oscar Isaac, uh, as shown her mat says
4189900	4192740	Oscar Isaac is a huge fan of the series.
4192740	4196340	Over a year ago, he asked in a press conference that he wants to play snake.
4196340	4198860	So at least we're getting somebody that kind of knows what they're getting into.
4198860	4200860	Um, so that's nice.
4200860	4202660	I'm not arguing about him at all.
4202660	4206380	It's just, you know, um, I really don't know this director.
4206380	4210780	The only thing I said that that's listed on here is Kong skull Island, which I'll be honest,
4210780	4214580	I don't even think I remember that movie existing.
4214580	4219340	So that was like the King Kong movie that came out after the, uh, Lord of the rings
4219340	4222260	director Peter Jackson's con movie, right?
4222260	4223260	Yeah.
4223260	4224260	Yeah.
4224260	4227000	Cause that's the one that's the new Toho university and the one that they have the new, the two
4227000	4231900	Godzilla movies and they're supposed to be the Godzilla and King Kong movie that's coming
4231940	4232940	out.
4232940	4236060	So that's kind of the prequel to those two or three.
4236060	4237380	I never see movies.
4237380	4242780	I mean, obviously it's 2020, so I can't see them in the theater anyway, but, uh, I was
4242780	4244380	already bad at movies.
4244380	4252020	I am way, I am way outside of the, uh, the whole kaiju movies these days.
4252020	4255380	I have a lot to catch up on, although I'll be honest.
4255380	4259100	Just recently I went back and watched probably one of my favorite of the Godzilla movies,
4259100	4263900	which was, uh, Godzilla versus mecha Ghidra because it had the dude with CD player in
4263900	4264900	his head.
4264900	4269860	I do say though, like I haven't watched it yet, but the last, uh, Godzilla movie that
4269860	4272460	they put out looked pretty amazing.
4272460	4277220	Like I think if you do have to go, if you do want to watch one of those new, new universe,
4277220	4281620	that last one that they put out looked absolutely incredible, but I, I still haven't watched
4281620	4282620	it yet.
4282620	4285460	So the chat is lighting up with some various commentary about the Kong skull Island and
4285460	4290140	how it fits into universal's monster verse, uh, which was kind of like their answer to
4290140	4291460	the Marvel cinematic universe.
4291460	4294820	And I do remember, cause last time I was at universal studios, which was a few years ago
4294820	4299060	at this point, they were already starting to like really promote like universal is the
4299060	4300580	home of these classic monsters.
4300580	4303900	And there's very certain ones that they're promoting that I think are in line with the
4303900	4304900	monster verse.
4304900	4308640	Cause wasn't that, um, I almost said Tim Curry reboot of the mummy.
4308640	4315420	I wish the there's, there's, there's the Godzilla King Kong stuff.
4315420	4321700	That's its own thing, but the classic, the classic do with the invisible man, the reboot
4321700	4325460	of the mummy that were not as great.
4325460	4328940	Um, so there's those that's, that's like, I forgot what they call it.
4328940	4330340	It's like something dark universe.
4330340	4334980	I can't remember what it was called, but like it's, that's its own thing that they do, but
4334980	4335980	my bad.
4335980	4340700	No, I think that the King Kong Godzilla stuff way better than all of that.
4340700	4343500	Um, the other stuff, God, terrible.
4343500	4344900	All right.
4344900	4350380	Well maybe the, um, uh, a solid snake movie, the metal gear movie will start off a Konami
4350380	4355220	cinematic universe, the KCU, and we'll get a DDR movie.
4355220	4356220	All right.
4356220	4357220	Maybe not.
4357220	4361020	Pachinko slots, the movie.
4361020	4362020	Let's move on.
4362020	4363020	Let's move on.
4363020	4364020	Loki.
4364020	4365020	What else do you have for us tonight?
4365020	4368060	Uh, so we have some new updates to our consoles coming out.
4368060	4373340	So Nintendo added some new features to the switch and then brand new firmware update.
4373980	4378940	Uh, so the ability to now be able to take your screenshots that you make on the console
4378940	4383980	and be able to transfer them to your phone or a PC.
4383980	4385300	So that's pretty cool.
4385300	4390340	Um, they use some sort of QR code system to be able to do that.
4390340	4396380	And um, or you can use a via or a USB cable to transfer to your PC.
4396380	4399100	So that's kind of, um, helpful.
4399100	4405260	And then, um, along with that, they also added some more super Mario 30th, fifth anniversary
4405260	4411460	profile icons, just to remind you that the game is going away at the end of March, allegedly.
4411460	4412460	So we'll see.
4412460	4419180	Um, and then of course on the Xbox side of things for the Xbox series, um, S and X and
4419180	4424420	the original Xbox one, they had a new console updates that added some new dynamic background
4424420	4431580	designs, including some that have, uh, kind of some older console looks to them.
4431580	4439660	And then they also did, um, they added some more optimized for X and S series of our badges,
4439660	4444020	which I think they have those already in the, uh, they did on games pass.
4444020	4448500	I guess now this is for your library as well, uh, which is helpful.
4448500	4454620	And I believe there's something also calling out HDR as well, um, which is nice.
4454620	4458620	And then a new family member account set up stuff.
4458620	4462820	And they're also going to have pre-installs for games that are coming soon on Xbox game
4462820	4463820	pass.
4463820	4468340	So if you want to, you know, preload those, you can, uh, for when those are coming out
4468340	4470100	and then, yeah.
4470100	4475220	So if you want to check it out, uh, it should be, I think coming out soon if it's not out
4475220	4476220	already.
4476220	4480980	Otherwise you can, uh, join the Xbox insider program to get access to those updates before
4480980	4483700	they hit the retail side.
4483700	4487980	I'm pretty sure it's out, um, on the Xbox side and then the, the Switch one is certainly
4487980	4492660	out and, uh, it is, it is so convoluted to get pictures.
4492660	4493660	I don't understand.
4493660	4495660	Like I, I understand.
4495660	4499940	And Bobby's explaining the tech side of it in the chat, um, saying the QR code gives
4499940	4503400	you the ability to connect to your Switch's wifi router.
4503400	4505380	The first one is the SSID for the wifi.
4505380	4509300	The second is the internal web server on the Switch to download the photos or videos.
4509300	4512540	And I'm just kind of like, wow.
4512540	4517180	For a company that really doesn't like to get their things hacked, they just blew open
4517180	4520180	the goddamn door to hackers, didn't they?
4520180	4527180	Here use this code to directly tap into your Switch's, like Loki, you know more about that
4527180	4533940	stuff than I do, but using this convoluted method, haven't they just like blown open
4533940	4536180	the door for hackers?
4536180	4542220	Probably not because it's probably just accessing a small portion of the, uh, storage on the,
4542220	4543340	the system itself.
4543340	4548620	They probably have it split up to it kind of like an FTP server where you may have access
4548620	4550100	to certain folders.
4550100	4552100	I'm guessing that's what they're doing.
4552100	4553100	Um, yeah.
4553100	4560640	Bobby says it's giving you access to a web server or webpage basically, but you know,
4560640	4565600	or they could just have it break it and download it with like, plug it into a PC or something
4565600	4566600	and just download it that way.
4566600	4568800	Why does they got to make it super complicated?
4568800	4572720	We have this Nintendo Switch app, why can't it just upload the pictures to the cloud or
4572720	4573720	something like that?
4573720	4580880	And I can download them through the Nintendo app that they have available already.
4580880	4585200	Basically the way that Microsoft's doing it, but that would be so 2020 and that's not Nintendo.
4585200	4587640	We got to work a couple of decades behind.
4587640	4589200	Look, I'm glad it's there.
4589200	4591680	It's going to make the sharing of the photos a lot easier.
4591680	4596240	You know, all the animal crossing, you know, uh, shit posting that we all love to do.
4596240	4602800	Um, but I, it just, it just feels so convoluted to scan two QR codes, but whatever, whatever.
4602800	4603840	All right.
4603840	4609980	Now Bobby does say you can also drag and drop to your PC via a USB cable on the Switch.
4609980	4611600	They added that method too.
4611600	4617720	Well that, that's a little more, you know, makes sense, but again, what else are they
4617720	4620480	going to be able to do once you hook up your Switch via USB cable?
4620480	4622960	I mean, yes, I know it's just a web server, but I don't know.
4622960	4628860	I just, I just feel like these stories inevitably lead to, they got PlayStation two games running
4628860	4633360	on the Switch, you know, it's just saying, all right.
4633360	4635560	I'd never be able to run PlayStation two.
4635560	4636560	That's true.
4636560	4637560	That's true.
4637560	4638560	All right.
4638560	4639560	Shows you how much I know.
4639560	4640560	All right.
4640560	4643840	Let's move on to, uh, speaking of like, like doing things on the older consoles, this kind
4643840	4652200	of came out of nowhere, uh, and it has to do with the classic RPG series Ys, not Ys,
4652200	4659200	although that's what it looks like when you read the name, but Ys by Nihon, Ys, Ys, Ys,
4659200	4660480	I said Ys, Ys.
4660480	4661480	Okay.
4661480	4666160	So that game, uh, by Nihon Falcom is, uh, doing something a little different.
4666160	4669540	They're going to be porting the first and second game in the series.
4669540	4675300	So Ys one and two are going to be ported to the sharp X 68,000.
4675300	4680580	Now dark, Sakurai probably talked about that machine on this show years ago in one of her,
4680580	4682340	uh, did it for a classic console.
4682340	4683340	Yeah.
4683340	4687440	But I mean, all of our listeners may not have been here when that happened.
4687440	4692700	So it's, uh, you know, a, a console that was only out in Japan in the eighties.
4692700	4693700	You could think of the console.
4693700	4694700	It was the computer.
4694700	4695700	I'm sorry.
4695700	4696700	Yeah.
4696700	4697700	It was a home computer.
4697700	4698700	You're right.
4698860	4705700	When I was in train, I equate it to something like Commodore 64, TI 99 4a, um, Apple 2e.
4705700	4706700	Those were kind of like the computers.
4706700	4707700	Hell no.
4707700	4711420	Well, but those, but those were the computers we had in the eighties.
4711420	4713740	So this is kind of like what Japan had.
4713740	4714740	Yeah.
4714740	4719500	And it, it kind of blew the stuff that we had out of the water as far as what it could
4719500	4720500	do for gaming.
4720500	4721500	Yes.
4721500	4726860	Um, I mean, there was also, uh, the FM towns, which also was, I'd say pretty, pretty good
4726900	4732940	for, for gaming as well, but the sharp X 68,000 was the machine that pretty much ran arcade
4732940	4736820	perfect versions of so many games.
4736820	4742180	And it's now kind of like this one Holy grail for collectors that, um, you know, if you
4742180	4747620	can find a system that works and get the, you know, the, the games for it still, you
4747620	4749940	know, still intact, you know, no discreet errors.
4749940	4754660	Um, and on top of that, you know, you could switch like your music synthesizer for different
4754660	4755660	games.
4755660	4762420	You know, sound options, but the, the X 60,000 was like the shit is still kind of the shit.
4762420	4764940	Some of the best versions of games are on that system.
4764940	4769460	Well, and it's interesting now that here we are in 2020 or should I say 2021 when this
4769460	4774700	actually comes out March 9th, 2021 that we have East one and two are going to be released
4774700	4779940	for that console or sorry, I have it on this show, but that computer, uh, that came out
4779940	4786220	in 1987 and it's going to come on 3.5 inch floppy disks like they should for that year.
4786220	4789740	Uh, and you know, there's going to be a smooth in game scrolling.
4789740	4794660	You don't have to swap in floppies to save your progress, but it's, it's a DMA and now
4794660	4800500	we hear about D makes a lot on this show, like, you know, halo 2,600, you know, the,
4800500	4803380	the way I can play halo efficiently, you know, those types of things.
4803380	4807740	We hear that, but those are almost always fan projects.
4807780	4811780	The fact that this is like, uh, this is being done by Nihon Falcom.
4811780	4814780	That's what makes this different, uh, and kind of interesting.
4814780	4818540	Um, so anyhow, we do, I do want to clarify.
4818540	4823940	There was a version of East one that came out in 1991, but they redid like with three
4823940	4826840	pre-rendered, uh, 3d bosses.
4826840	4831540	This is going to be the first time the East two has ever come out on the platform.
4831540	4835860	Uh, and I think it's a, I think it's a different version of East one, but don't quote me on
4835860	4836860	that.
4836860	4839500	Do you want to get both?
4839500	4842780	Just to say, um, one of the other things is a good number of games that I've done for
4842780	4847620	classic game of the week, had some of their first home releases on the strip X, 68,000,
4847620	4854720	uh, Galaga, 88, Emerald dragon, um, uh, uh, it even had like tons of fighting games.
4854720	4861540	So a lot of the SNK and Capcom just saying, Oh, well it's, it's, but it's, do you, um,
4861540	4867940	Why, you know, no, I, I, that all makes sense, but, but why D make for this platform for
4867940	4868940	$84?
4868940	4877100	It still has such a big, big fan following and the people who have their, their, uh,
4877100	4881620	their computers, they will play it regularly because again, these are some of the best
4881620	4883620	versions of some of these games.
4883620	4889740	Um, it actually doesn't really surprise me if there's a big enough audience for it.
4889740	4893980	They do a limited release at a high price point, even people are going to pay for it.
4893980	4897500	I mean, some of those Dreamcast ones were still going true.
4897500	4899680	We see that limited still doing Genesis games.
4899680	4903700	And I feel like we have some story about what limited run games is doing like at least once
4903700	4904860	a month on this show.
4904860	4911700	So if not more often than that, we had one last week about that, um, the Ninja game on
4911700	4917780	NES that was recently put in the, um, uh, no, uh, revenge of the Ninja was the Gameboy
4917780	4918780	one.
4918780	4919780	It was a shadow.
4919780	4924940	Now somebody, somebody, somebody in chattel shouted out, um, I think we own like two physical
4924940	4925940	copies of that game.
4925940	4926940	Well, there you go.
4926940	4928900	Well, if you want to get a third limited run games is doing it, but anyway, actually, and
4928900	4932180	I do want to say this is not, this is not through limited run games because I don't
4932180	4936600	think limited run does Japan centric things.
4936600	4938680	So this is a shadow of the Ninja.
4938680	4939680	Thank you.
4939680	4940680	Dark Tetsuya.
4940680	4944300	Um, so yeah, this is something that Nihon Falcom is doing directly.
4944300	4948580	If it sells out, sells, it's going to be interesting to see what else comes from this
4948580	4949580	in my opinion.
4949580	4952420	So, uh, it could be, it could be, what's old is new again.
4952420	4953420	Right.
4953420	4954420	So, all right.
4954420	4955420	Let's move on.
4955420	4956420	Dark Sakura.
4956420	4962900	Oh, um, another going on actually a little bit outside of the, I guess the more fun aspects
4962900	4969420	of games and, um, especially since, you know, what we've been hearing in, you know, quote,
4969420	4974220	real life has been economy, this, and you know, money, that, and what we're going to
4974220	4975220	do.
4975220	4984340	Um, so, uh, I, um, I thought it was pretty interesting to find that video games, um,
4984340	4991340	by recent reports, um, state that the video game industry in and of itself in 2019 generated
4991340	5004420	90.3 billion in economic output and supported, um, uh, close to, uh, 429,000 jobs, um, with,
5004420	5008740	uh, about a third of that who are actually employed in the industry.
5008740	5016820	Um, and they're really generating a lot of, you know, uh, uh, tax money for, uh, you know,
5016820	5019740	for, uh, their various states.
5019740	5027060	Um, overall, um, California of course has the largest, uh, total economic output and
5027060	5040940	employment with a $51.8 billion and a 218 90, wait, 218,090, uh, jobs.
5040940	5046180	So you think about this, you know, when we were growing, growing up, you know, people
5046180	5051620	say, oh, I want to do this in video games, you know, and they're like, oh, you can't
5051620	5057260	make money in that, uh, excuse you, look at this, you know, you, you can, and people are
5057260	5058260	making money in this deal.
5058260	5060060	Or you have to live in Japan to do that.
5060060	5061060	Yeah.
5061060	5065380	Um, oh, but I mean, but, but think about it that way.
5065380	5072380	You know, this, it is now a very, uh, lucrative industry and a very competitive industry on
5072420	5073420	top of that.
5073420	5080500	And, um, of course, uh, uh, women in the gaming industry are still having a very difficult,
5080500	5087100	uh, you know, ceiling to, I wouldn't say it's like glass, I'm thinking more like the transparent
5087100	5092900	aluminum from, uh, was it, was it Star Trek three, Star Trek four, I think it was Star
5092900	5094900	Trek four, the one with the whales.
5094900	5095900	Anyway.
5095900	5096900	Um, okay, cool.
5097420	5106260	Um, but at any rate, you know, uh, it's, uh, it's really, and I think that now with, um,
5106260	5112940	you know, COVID business going on, I truly believe that it's only going to be a bigger
5112940	5113940	contributor.
5113940	5118780	I'm really looking at, I mean, and me who is not like the most, let's follow the stonks
5118780	5120780	and the economies and all that.
5120780	5125340	I am super interested to see what next year's fiscal reporting looks like.
5125780	5126780	Oh, sorry.
5126780	5131580	I will technically this year's fiscal reporting, which I think is like, what in April.
5131580	5132580	So we'll see.
5132580	5133580	Yeah.
5133580	5137100	Well, I mean, it makes sense that, you know, throughout this pandemic when we're really
5137100	5140860	being encouraged to stay at home, you know, as an aside, I think, you know, cause this
5140860	5144740	show is broadcast around the world and, and a lot of you in the States, you know, see
5144740	5148420	this, and you've probably seen a lot in the news about how California is going to go back
5148420	5150780	on the, the super lockdown or whatever.
5150780	5153420	But what's interesting is that when I see those stories, I'm like, that's what I've
5153500	5158740	been doing ever since March, like nothing, like it's so like people read those stories
5158740	5159740	and go, Oh my gosh.
5159740	5161540	And I look at it and go, nothing's changing.
5161540	5166460	Well, but going into another thing on this though, well, but keep in mind, Rob, people
5166460	5172300	like you and me, we are in the minority, especially as you said, there were people protesting
5172300	5178020	the lockdown by being super spreaders, especially, especially North of here and in the central
5178020	5179020	Valley.
5179020	5182580	And what was the first place to go on lockdown and who's next?
5182740	5186460	Well, technically the most, the most populated area of the state also is on the super lockdown,
5186460	5189620	but who was right after him, the central Valley, who's going to be next?
5189620	5190620	The North state.
5190620	5191620	Yeah.
5191620	5199060	Um, but going, going back to another thing though, is, and I was reading another article
5199060	5205020	today, I think it was by Forbes or business insider, one of the two that whatever happens
5205020	5212260	with, um, you know, with vaccines and, you know, going back to the former normal, um,
5212260	5215980	the way people work has been irrevocably changed.
5215980	5223820	They've proven that you can do, um, uh, that telecommuting is not just, uh, a valid means
5223820	5227820	of work, but people are in a lot of cases, more productive by doing so.
5227820	5232380	My, my work will have a permanent change involving telework due to this whole thing.
5232380	5236700	I'm hoping that that mine does, but they're not expecting us to go eat remotely back into
5236700	5239500	the office until maybe late next year, which I'm fine with that.
5239500	5240500	Yeah.
5240500	5241500	And I'm not saying a hundred percent.
5241500	5242500	I'm saying it's a change.
5242500	5243500	It's going to be a change.
5243500	5245380	It's going to be more open than they were ever talking about before.
5245380	5249340	Well, so, but the other thing too, is that it's also changed things for like the medical
5249340	5250340	field.
5250340	5254780	Um, how many of us have had, um, our doctor's visits now on video?
5254780	5255780	Yeah.
5255780	5259620	You know, um, I mean, just, just saying in general, it's really changed the way a lot
5259620	5263860	of business operates for the better, I think.
5263860	5271300	Um, and if you look at it this way, it's even, I think helping environmentally by hopefully
5271300	5279420	lowering, you know, physical commute time and operating costs of large, uh, large commercial
5279420	5280900	buildings, for example.
5280900	5288420	And so with video games, I'm not sure how many, um, designers, um, well, I mean, sure,
5288420	5293620	I'm pretty sure a designer with a good enough, uh, system at home would be able to, to do
5293620	5297420	a lot of their work from a, a, a home studio.
5297420	5302980	Um, a lot of, a lot are doing it now, just really boosting up their, their home studios
5302980	5303980	that way.
5303980	5311140	And I'm sure that anyone doing any of the more clerical end of this, um, or writing
5311140	5313900	end of this, they're going to be able to do it.
5313900	5320340	So I'm seeing entire studios keep being as productive as they are, but doing it from
5320340	5321940	the safety of their homes.
5321940	5322940	Yeah.
5322940	5323940	I think there's, it's good.
5323940	5327820	You know, that we talk about like the new normal and I don't think the new normal is
5327820	5329780	necessarily a bunch of scary things.
5329780	5333200	I think, um, there's a lot of like, really good.
5333200	5336500	And I think those of us that are tech inclined, and I think if you listen to the show and
5336500	5342020	you are a hardcore or even casual core fan of video games, you are somewhat tech inclined.
5342020	5343660	And I think there's a lot about that new normal.
5343660	5345380	That's going to be very friendly to us.
5345380	5349160	You know, I think like, like web conferencing and these types of things, we were doing this
5349160	5353140	for a long time and back to the original story that, that brought us to this video games
5353140	5358020	being a major part of the economy and a major outlet for release and a thing that we do
5358020	5359920	to bond with other people.
5359920	5363340	You know, we all knew this and I think a lot of people in our generation knew this, but
5363340	5369780	I think even more, especially people older than us have come to things like Jackbox games.
5369780	5370980	Great example, right?
5370980	5375460	I know heck of people that maybe played the occasional phone game, but didn't really play
5375460	5379940	a lot of video games, um, that like, were like, Oh, I love Jackbox games.
5379940	5382340	Let's, let's have a Jackbox night or get together and do that.
5382340	5386980	You know, that's, that's now money in the video game economy that wasn't there before,
5386980	5387980	you know?
5387980	5393220	So I think, I think, uh, and especially people that are developing things like this, um,
5393220	5398420	and among us, can I just go on a quick tangent?
5398420	5399700	Let's talk about among us.
5399700	5401500	Let's do that.
5401500	5402940	Let's talk about among us.
5402940	5408260	I saw an interesting thing on Twitter about how some people really don't want to play
5408260	5413020	among us or our little resistance to that game, because they don't like the element
5413020	5417500	of lying to their friends and getting accused of lying.
5417500	5419940	And I'm, I'm completely sensitive to that.
5419940	5423900	And I get that it's interesting because I haven't played a lot of among us yet.
5423900	5429140	I totally play these survivor games online where I lie and do all this crap that I would
5429140	5430700	never do in real life.
5430700	5433980	But I also understand that really isn't for everybody.
5433980	5435420	And I get that.
5435420	5440060	But I, the reason why I bring up among us and, and it's, even though those critiques
5440060	5446900	are kind of there, like why has that game skyrocketed the way that it has this year?
5446900	5453060	Like that game is a very brilliant example about how I think the, the needs and wants
5453060	5458660	of the gaming community and the types of games that ended up being successful has kind of
5458660	5464540	changed because of the pandemic, you know, among us came out in like 2018 and everybody
5464580	5467340	suddenly asking themselves, well, why now?
5467340	5468940	Why is that game coming out now?
5468940	5476000	Because in a way y'all, among us is like that really short condensed versions of Dungeons
5476000	5477260	and Dragons.
5477260	5484700	Bear with me, D&D fans, I don't mean to sacrilege here, but it's a way of telling a story with
5484700	5490500	your friends in this virtual setting and getting to do what is kind of inherently a social
5490500	5491500	thing.
5491500	5492500	I don't know.
5492540	5496980	Jamie, you got to have some thoughts on this whole like among us and how the pandemic has
5496980	5499420	allowed that game to be so successful.
5499420	5501940	I think I've already had that same discussion with Animal Crossing.
5501940	5502940	Oh, okay.
5502940	5503940	Fair.
5503940	5504940	Fair.
5504940	5510820	It's a little thing to lose yourself in it's, you know, you can be social in it.
5510820	5514460	I mean, it's more for the people who have like the social need, it is a way to get together
5514460	5519100	with your friends and play a game without getting together with your friends.
5519100	5523020	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, yes, but those survivor games are against people you probably
5523020	5525300	never met.
5525300	5527260	Half true.
5527260	5528260	For the most part, yes.
5528260	5530520	I don't want to just like be contrary into your statement.
5530520	5535180	But there were like a couple people in that game that like I knew about, or I kind of
5535180	5537620	knew them through somebody else.
5537620	5541940	But also, like through that process, yes, there was lying and I did a lot of it to win
5541940	5543100	the game.
5543100	5548900	But there are people in that game that like I will talk to, like if certain people that
5548900	5552460	were in that game and they who know who they are, if they ever needed anything from me,
5552460	5554460	I would drop a lot.
5554460	5558500	Like I made some really good lifelong friends out of that process, honestly.
5558500	5559500	So yeah.
5559500	5560500	Anyway.
5560500	5561500	Okay, let's move on.
5561500	5565720	Sorry, we got a lot of tangents and it's my fault.
5565720	5570300	But we have a direct to get to very soon and our classic pinball table of the month.
5570300	5574420	But first, we're going to get to this next story, Loki.
5574420	5576500	All right.
5576500	5584260	So we've got some interesting changes at Sony.
5584260	5596180	So apparently, the creator of Silent Hill and Gravity Rush, Kichiro Toyama, has actually
5596180	5601800	left Sony and formed his own studio.
5601800	5602800	So that's pretty awesome.
5602800	5606400	It seems to be kind of the trend, you know, a lot of these big names, you know, coming
5606400	5607960	out and forming their own studio.
5607960	5612840	So he has a new outfit called Bokeh Game Studios.
5612840	5622880	And yeah, so basically, along with that, he's also got Kazunobu Sato, who designed Puppeteer,
5622880	5626080	if you remember that game on PlayStation 3.
5626080	5628080	Yeah.
5628080	5632200	And then also was the producer of The Last Guardian.
5632200	5638320	And then Junya Okura, who was a designer on Gravity Rush.
5638320	5640560	So pretty nice pedigree there.
5640560	5643880	Be curious to see what they're working on.
5643880	5647360	Yeah, that's interesting.
5647360	5649880	Some big, big departures there.
5649880	5653980	And it certainly kind of gives a swift kick in the butt to all these Silent Hill reboot
5653980	5656920	at Sony rumors that go around every couple months.
5656920	5662000	But well, they have some sketches that's in their little video talking about their new
5662000	5663520	chapter or whatever.
5663520	5666880	And it is certainly horror looking.
5666880	5671180	So maybe we'll see.
5671180	5673200	I mean, so yeah, it's the other game.
5673200	5675260	They also worked on Siren as well.
5675260	5677520	So that's that's pretty interesting.
5677520	5678520	Yeah.
5678520	5679520	Yeah.
5679520	5681720	So I guess we'll wait and see.
5681720	5684280	Perhaps we'll hear something about that at the Game Awards.
5684280	5685280	Perhaps.
5685280	5686280	I was thinking.
5686280	5687280	Yeah.
5687280	5688280	So we'll wait and see.
5688280	5689280	All right.
5689280	5690620	Well, all right.
5690620	5696180	So talking about departures, I know Dark Soccer is really thrilled to talk about this.
5696180	5700780	There are some big departures that happen at BioWare this week and in advance of New
5700780	5706820	Dragon Age news at the Game Awards, Casey Hudson, who at one time was the creative director
5706820	5710400	behind the Mass Effect series, but at one point recently became the general.
5710400	5714340	He left once and then came back as the general manager of BioWare.
5714340	5718100	And now he's leaving again and saying, I'm incredibly fortunate to have had a career
5718100	5722100	where I've been able to work with brilliantly talented people, create entire worlds from
5722100	5725860	our imaginations and see them being enjoyed by millions of people around the world.
5725860	5730080	And now, after nearly 20 years of work at BioWare, I've made the decision to retire
5730080	5733820	from the studio and make way for the next generation of studio leaders.
5733820	5734820	Interesting.
5734820	5737900	He's retiring from the studio, but he didn't say he was retiring from the game industry.
5737900	5740220	Just something I just something I observe.
5740220	5742500	That's all I'm just making observations.
5742500	5746380	But the interesting thing is that would have been news in itself if he'd left.
5746380	5751780	Because the same day that news came out, Dragon Age executive producer Mark Darrah
5751780	5756540	also left, saying, though I remain confident in BioWare's strength and continued place
5756540	5760580	in this conversation, I have decided to retire from my position at BioWare.
5760580	5765740	Again, I can't help but note, not the game industry, but BioWare.
5765740	5771460	Anyway, obviously nothing is going to change with development on the new Dragon Age and
5771460	5775820	the Mass Effect remaster games, whatever the hell is going on with Anthem.
5775820	5781260	Laura Miles, I hope I'm saying her name right, sorry, who is the chief studio officer at
5781260	5786060	Electronic Arts kind of put out her own statement alongside this, pretty much reassuring fans
5786060	5788540	that things are going to be just fine.
5788540	5793520	And it is interesting to note that Christian Daley, who used to be with Blizzard Entertainment,
5793520	5797100	is taking over for the Dragon Age 4 end of things.
5797100	5801620	And Mike Gamble will be taking over on the Mass Effect remaster, which I would imagine
5801620	5803840	is pretty close to completion at this point.
5803840	5811740	So we'll see what happens with the future of the Mass Effect franchise.
5811740	5812740	So I don't know.
5812740	5816800	The fact that they're both happening the same day is a little weird to me.
5816800	5818740	And I don't know if anything's wrong with BioWare.
5818740	5822140	I feel like this smells like an EA thing.
5822140	5823460	I don't know.
5823460	5824900	Could it maybe just be a coincidence?
5824900	5825900	I don't know.
5825900	5826900	Darrah?
5826900	5831580	I'm sure we'll get an article down the road telling us about some shenanigans going on
5831580	5832580	behind the scenes.
5832580	5838120	Well, the shenanigans I want to hear is that those two formed a new studio, or this would
5838120	5839780	be a gag.
5839780	5844680	They joined that studio that the Blizzard folks made, which I...
5844680	5845680	What was the name of it?
5845680	5849240	It had a very tongue in cheek name.
5849240	5851240	Somebody will remember it in chat, but the Blizzard...
5851240	5852240	Very cold weather.
5852240	5854160	No, the Blizzard, it's like ice something.
5854160	5859540	The Blizzard folks made a new studio and I don't know why.
5859540	5862320	Maybe it's just because there's that Blizzard tie in towards the end there, but I don't
5862320	5865220	know why I feel like that would be such a gag.
5865220	5866940	DarkSakura, you are the resident...
5866940	5867940	Oh, thank you.
5867940	5868940	Frost King Games.
5868940	5869940	Thank you.
5869940	5870940	Frost Giant.
5870940	5871940	Frost Giant game.
5871940	5872940	Thank you.
5872940	5873940	I knew there was a play there.
5873940	5877460	DarkSakura, you are the resident BioWare fangirl of many sorts.
5877460	5878460	Your thoughts?
5878460	5879460	Cool.
5879460	5886160	I knew there were shenanigans going on.
5886160	5887160	I don't want to speculate.
5887160	5889420	I just want to see what happens.
5889420	5890420	Show me the product.
5890800	5894440	That's how I've been for just about everything these days.
5894440	5897280	Okay, people have done this stuff.
5897280	5898880	People leave companies all the time.
5898880	5901040	They're just not as high profile, right?
5901040	5903320	Let's see what they're going to do with it.
5903320	5904480	High profile folks leave too.
5904480	5907840	I mean, Blizzard, Mike Morhaime, that's a pretty big deal.
5907840	5913080	Some have noted that Blizzard's quality has dipped a little bit, but that's another story
5913080	5915480	for another day, I suppose.
5915480	5916920	So yeah, interesting.
5916920	5922980	For me, I want to see what happens, not guess about what's going on.
5922980	5928900	There have been way too many times that people have speculated stuff and been wrong, and
5928900	5930900	I don't want to be wrong.
5930900	5932620	I want to be pleased.
5932620	5934620	Sometimes it's fun to be wrong, but only sometimes.
5934620	5935620	All right.
5935620	5936620	From what planet?
5936620	5937620	I'm never wrong.
5937620	5938620	That's why I don't speculate.
5938620	5943620	So I can be right all the time.
5943620	5948320	And let's go to another category that you are certainly an expert on, and that is classic
5948320	5953640	games as we get to the classic game of the week.
5953640	5958600	But of course, as you know, once a month here on this show in a 2020 twist, we go into the
5958600	5962520	archives and choose a pinball game to talk about.
5962520	5968080	So it's time for the classic pinball table of the month, our last one for 2020.
5968080	5971160	Did we determine a 2021 theme?
5971160	5972160	I thought we had.
5973140	5975140	I don't think I did.
5975140	5976140	I don't know.
5976140	5977140	I might think of one.
5977140	5978140	All right.
5978140	5983100	So 2021 twist to be determined unless someone in chat, I'll do, I'll do non classic game
5983100	5984100	of the month.
5984100	5985100	All right.
5985100	5988600	But we still have one more pinball table to get us through the year.
5988600	5992800	So dark soccer, what is December's classic pinball table of the month?
5992800	5998260	I picked a table that is sort of a transitional table, the kind of the end of its particular
5998260	6004560	era and another John Papadook table, because, you know, I love my John Papadook tables.
6004560	6012880	So Circus Voltaire, it came out in 1997, done by John Papadook and released by Williams
6012880	6014960	under their ballet label.
6014960	6021800	And it has the player, the sort of theme of it is doing different quote marvels to join
6021800	6023760	the circus.
6023760	6027800	And it has a few very distinctive things going on with it.
6028340	6032340	One of its features has a neon light that runs along the right hand ramp and a pop bumper
6032340	6038180	that rises up in the middle of the play field and a magnet at the top left ramp that can
6038180	6040860	catch the balls and divert them into locks.
6040860	6043340	They're a ball catcher.
6043340	6048580	And the biggest feature is the ringmaster, which is a head that rises up to taunt the
6048580	6050300	player.
6050300	6051420	And I must apologize.
6051420	6058600	I tried to find the a digital table so we could get better sound on it.
6058600	6062300	And I found sort of like a how to play.
6062300	6069240	So and for anyone who is watching the video while we are live, you might notice that the
6069240	6074560	DMD is interesting, that it's an interesting place.
6074600	6081680	So only two tables had their DMD is in such a place like this.
6081680	6083960	The other one was Capcom's flipper football.
6083960	6092000	You know, Capcom had a kind of a limited run doing pinballs, but the the two of them have
6092000	6098040	their DMD not on the top marquee, but sunken into the play field.
6098040	6104200	It's on the back box in the right, the right back box into the cabinet.
6104200	6111180	So the point of that, as I say, was to not distract the player from gameplay by looking
6111180	6116720	up for their modes and their shots and to see what was going on.
6116720	6127760	And it also does have a little bit more interactivity, like animation that shows a cannonball fired.
6127760	6131000	It has different things that are a little bit more integration.
6131000	6139520	Why I say that this was a bit of a transitional game is that the sunken DMD could be considered
6139520	6149740	a precursor to the pinball 2000 series, where the display was a holographic projection on
6149740	6150740	top of the table.
6150740	6156840	Games like Revenge from Mars and Episode One Racing, Episode One Master, whatever, Star
6156840	6159720	Wars Episode One.
6159720	6164440	And this this was I mean, I'll be honest, it's a little bit actually more distracting
6164440	6166640	me to have it on the back box.
6166640	6172840	I have played the Circus Voltaire a couple of times, kind of an interesting one to find.
6172840	6180480	But yeah, as you were watching the the wizard mode going on right now, right?
6180480	6183340	Yeah, it's a really neat table.
6183340	6188480	The ramps in this are actually pretty, pretty insane, I would think.
6188480	6191760	I really, I really think that the layout of this was really good.
6191760	6195080	Again, I love Papa Duke's design and pinball.
6195080	6202120	So as far as the modes, you have nine quote marvels that you have to complete until you
6202120	6207480	are invited to join the circus and that circus with a Q, C-I-R-Q-U-S.
6207480	6215380	They are in a three by three square grid with the row and column corresponding to C-I-R-Q-U-S.
6215380	6219800	And when you fill the grid, then you get the join the circus wizard mode.
6219800	6227100	So you have juggler and then you can start a juggler multiball with that sideshow random
6227100	6233380	award ringmaster frenzy where you defeat the ringmaster twice to start frenzy multiball
6233380	6243500	menagerie where you hit some targets on the left to do a large plastic captive ball defeated
6243500	6247020	all ringmasters where you can do special multiball.
6247020	6250980	There's high wire multiball where you hit the light lock targets on either side of the
6250980	6256680	left ramp and then shoot the ramp three times to lock the balls and start high wire multiball.
6256680	6259060	Spin is the spinner.
6259060	6265580	Boom is you spell out volt and then once the letters are collected, the third pop bumper
6265580	6271680	pops up and you get that after the timer runs out, you get your marble after the timer runs
6271680	6277720	out and every hit on that bumper counts towards lighting an extra ball.
6277720	6282760	And then you have acrobats where you shoot the right ramp or orbit four times.
6282760	6290020	So you also have the character, the ringmaster that lives under the play field.
6290020	6294260	It's a flat circular platform attached to the top of his head.
6294260	6299840	And he sits directly in front of the W-O-W targets in the upper right hand corner and
6299840	6301880	has a hidden magnet.
6301880	6305100	So once the targets have been hit a total of three times, the magnet catches and holds
6305100	6309100	the ball as the ringmaster will rise to taunt the player.
6309100	6312820	And then the ball is shot off in a random direction.
6312820	6319320	You will have a very brief ball saver if it does go out of play.
6319320	6331320	And basically after after it's stood up, you would have to hit it five times and it will
6331320	6332320	further expose.
6332320	6338120	He's going to expose himself a hole where you can shoot a ball into his hole.
6338120	6339360	Yeah.
6339360	6343240	Like I said before, there are the various multiball modes in order.
6343240	6348760	We have ringmaster frenzy, ringmaster Raz, ringmaster special.
6348760	6355480	And the ringmaster battle, which you get if you have defeated all the ringmasters.
6355480	6360680	So those are your big, big four ringmaster multiballs.
6360680	6365380	The other ones, like I said, are high wire juggler neon, which is one of the sideshow
6365380	6371960	random awards for three balls strike and arc multiball, which is a two ball multi.
6371960	6375320	The ringmaster ones are all two ball as well.
6375320	6379620	High wire juggler neon are all three.
6379620	6385160	And then, of course, when you get after all nine, then you have your your join the circus
6385160	6390360	wizard mode where you have to spell circus unmaskable tear, meet the circus, and then
6390360	6395680	you have party multiball and join the circus ends when either all of them drain in any
6395680	6403080	of the first three phases or when the three balls drain in the fourth arc of it.
6403080	6410000	The circus will tear for anyone who who likes to play the virtual versions.
6410000	6415420	It was formally available in pinball arcade until June 30th, twenty eighteen.
6415420	6418560	Williams Midway license did expire.
6418560	6425140	Then it was licensed to Zen Studios, who had that in pinball effects three and as an unlockable
6425140	6430440	in Williams pinball mobile for iOS and Android.
6430560	6435680	There were unlicensed versions for visual pinball for four windows.
6435680	6439280	But yeah, I really enjoy this one.
6439280	6445080	I mean, I've pretty much have never played a Papa Duke designed table that I don't like.
6445080	6449120	The only thing that freaks me out is that, you know, I'm just like this person that like
6449120	6454080	if a game has like a head on it, it kind of freaks me out.
6454080	6458120	Like maybe this one wasn't as bad as like, say, fun house fun house freaks me the fuck
6458120	6459120	out.
6459240	6465760	It's just it's that Rudy had, you know, but it's a it's a really enjoyable table with
6465760	6469700	with an awesome theme, quite a bit of challenge to it.
6469700	6476920	And I'll be honest, the last time I played a circus Voltaire, I think was in Las Vegas
6476920	6480440	at the pinball museum when I went with Tara.
6480440	6481440	Yeah.
6481440	6482440	Yeah.
6482440	6485040	So there you go.
6485040	6491960	The classic pinball of the of the month of December last one for this year is Circus
6491960	6492960	Voltaire.
6492960	6494660	All right.
6494660	6495660	Awesome choice.
6495660	6500520	I think I remember seeing this one when I went to that same museum in Vegas, which hopefully
6500520	6502480	I'll be able to visit again at some point.
6502480	6504260	So all right.
6504260	6508000	So great choice for I like how you kind of pick something that kind of transition to
6508000	6509200	a new era of pinball.
6509200	6512160	That's a good kind of note to go out on for the classic pinballs.
6512160	6516760	I will point out that the chat has a lot of lovely ideas for twenty twenty one, although
6516760	6518580	ultimately it's up to you.
6518580	6519580	Some of the ideas.
6519580	6520580	Yeah.
6520580	6522640	Some of the ideas that are getting thrown out there.
6522640	6524720	Indie game of the month.
6524720	6526840	Classic remake of the week.
6526840	6529200	A couple of people were suggesting crappy game.
6529200	6532780	In my opinion, you've already kind of been doing crappy like you did Miss Nude World
6532780	6537800	ninety six is a classic game once like crappy games are sometimes classic because they're
6537800	6538800	crappy.
6538800	6539800	Yeah.
6539800	6542880	And the thing is, is it usually when I pick a crappy game, there's like a notability to
6542880	6548800	it, like either in pop culture or that it led to something, you know, or it's like a
6548800	6549800	cult classic.
6549800	6550800	Yeah.
6550800	6555000	Wasn't that like we did that for like one of the it was it one of the numbered episodes
6555000	6556000	like a six.
6556000	6557000	It was like a six.
6557000	6559480	It was like six hundred or five hundred or one of the yeah.
6559480	6560480	It was a anniversary.
6560480	6562280	I was one of those.
6562280	6563760	So yeah.
6563760	6565800	And as pointed out, it was an in-joke from the show.
6565800	6567780	It sure was.
6567780	6571700	Some ideas of my own that weren't said, I'll just throw out there for your consideration.
6571700	6575820	I was thinking classic collectible like you've done peripheral.
6575820	6578780	But then I was thinking of like some of those like crazy things in the vault, like that
6578780	6579780	game that had the dish.
6579780	6580780	I don't know.
6580780	6581780	It's a classic.
6581780	6582780	Yeah.
6582780	6583780	Maybe maybe I'll do that.
6583780	6584780	The classic dish of the week.
6584780	6585780	Classic.
6585780	6587940	I'll do classic recipe.
6587940	6590180	Classic pie of the month.
6590180	6594860	Another idea I had since I know you're all about like books and things actually to now
6594860	6596820	one just popped in my head.
6596860	6602060	I think instruction manual or box art might be a good one where you talk about and I know
6602060	6606340	that might not be great for a podcast, but I think it might be a cool thing to acknowledge,
6606340	6609520	you know, especially because I know you got a design background, so it might be a fun
6609520	6610520	thing to talk about.
6610520	6614540	But I was thinking when I originally thought a book, I was thinking we have all these magazines
6614540	6618220	that have gone by the wayside, you know, and like other like, you know, printed books that
6618220	6619220	we might remember.
6619220	6620220	I don't know.
6620220	6623660	Like the strategy guide that everybody got for Final Fantasy with Nintendo Power, you
6623660	6624660	know, things like that.
6624660	6626320	And I think about it.
6626320	6627320	What was the other one?
6627320	6629320	I had one other one that I thought of.
6629320	6630320	And now I can't remember.
6630320	6631320	Oh, well.
6631320	6632320	But you have a lot to think about for 2021.
6632320	6633320	OK.
6633320	6634320	Yeah.
6634320	6637640	And Bobby did rightly point out that I did Halo as a classic game, but bear in mind,
6637640	6638640	I did it for money.
6638640	6639640	Yes, that is right.
6639640	6640640	That is right.
6640640	6641640	I did it.
6641640	6647480	I put a bounty of five hundred dollars to pay my mother's bills.
6647480	6652000	And I did Halo because of the generosity of our Orange Lounge listeners.
6652000	6655120	Yes, Bobby, you totally paid for that.
6655120	6656320	And my mother thanks you.
6656320	6660800	It kept her in her house and fed for a month.
6660800	6663740	So thank you very much for your kindness to my mom.
6663740	6667480	I like how YYRS going meta here saying a classic OLR clip of the month.
6667480	6670960	We don't have 12 classic moments.
6670960	6672760	Like I remember any shit we've done.
6672760	6673760	I don't remember.
6673760	6674760	Do you remember?
6674760	6675760	I don't remember.
6675760	6678400	Dartits is going to take over the segment because he knows more about this show than
6678400	6679400	I do.
6679520	6685040	I remember laying in your bed, Rob, at the apartment eating Loki's waffles.
6685040	6690280	No, you know who knows more about this show than me, you and Loki combined, Misty.
6690280	6692760	Misty knows more about this show than any of us.
6692760	6698120	Like I think I think the only way you're going to get if the only way you're getting that
6698120	6700560	segment is if Misty volunteers to do it.
6700560	6703960	Maybe I'll do classic OLR listener of the month.
6703960	6705960	Oh, that'd be cute.
6705960	6706960	I like that.
6706960	6709520	Yeah, I mean, but I don't want to leave anybody out.
6709520	6710920	Yeah, that's true.
6710920	6714960	Maybe you could do people that aren't really here anymore.
6714960	6718580	Like that sounds really morbid, you know, like puppy, right?
6718580	6722200	Like he's got like a kid and they're all into Star Wars.
6722200	6730920	The 23rd, Drew and his joke book and their DDR angels streaming now under oh, God, I
6730920	6731920	forgot.
6731920	6732920	Like tech angel.
6732920	6733920	It's tech angel.
6733920	6734920	Thank you.
6734920	6735920	I was almost a complete jerk.
6735920	6736920	So anyway.
6736920	6737920	All right.
6737920	6739920	Look, we got to move on.
6739920	6740920	So.
6740920	6741920	All right.
6741920	6742920	Yeah.
6742920	6744920	Well, Dark Sakura will stew on this question and we'll let you know soon.
6744920	6752960	I'll tell you what for find me on my Twitter at Dark Sakura and, you know, start a thread.
6752960	6753960	Leave me some ideas.
6753960	6754960	Shit.
6754960	6757000	I'll take a look at it because I don't know what to do.
6757000	6758000	All right.
6758000	6764880	Well, speaking of iconic listeners of OLR's past and present and future, YYR, our friend
6764920	6769000	out there on the East Coast, you know, we have these things that are on the Orange Lounge
6769000	6772640	Radio Wiki that are the Orange Lounge Radio Dream Games.
6772640	6774400	So just we haven't had one in a while.
6774400	6778040	I think some things we've kind of just mentioned off the cusp, but especially in some of the
6778040	6781900	earlier days of the of the podcast format of the show and so forth, we've we've kind
6781900	6786360	of thrown out these ideas like that should be a game that needs to be a game.
6786360	6788800	And so a few of these ideas have gone out there.
6788800	6792920	And YYR has put together some of these games as a reality.
6792960	6795240	Like he actually asked, can I make these games a reality?
6795240	6798160	And the first one he ever did was Bungee Ferret Tossing.
6798160	6803640	And that was a game that was available on the Xbox 360 indie arcade.
6803640	6809440	And YYR, a little more recently in the era of the PlayStation Vita, did a game called
6809440	6812340	Pixel Shits, but he had to rename it Pixel Poops.
6812340	6814480	But the dream game was technically Pixel Shits.
6814480	6821040	And this is something that Dark Sakura just verbally pooped here on the show.
6823320	6828800	Sometimes, but well, but look at you, it became a game and everybody listens to the show knows
6828800	6829800	about it.
6829800	6830800	So.
6830800	6833640	And you have your very own direct for your game.
6833640	6836240	Yes, so that's what we're getting to.
6836240	6840440	We're going to get to YYR's official Pixel Poops direct.
6840440	6842760	And now I've been a very good boy and scouts honor.
6842760	6844520	I have no idea what he's going to talk about here.
6844520	6846120	Well, I assume it's Pixel Poops.
6846120	6850040	I don't know if he has any other surprises or what's happening, but we're going to play
6850040	6851040	it.
6851080	6852280	So I'm going to let you guys.
6852280	6854660	So Dark Sakura and Loki, in order for you guys to see it, you're going to need to bring
6854660	6856240	up the feed and watch it on your side.
6856240	6859880	So if you guys can mute yourselves and do that so you can see it.
6859880	6860880	And we will.
6860880	6861880	Hold on.
6861880	6862880	Yeah.
6862880	6865160	I just realized I've inspired YYR to take a big shit on a video game.
6865160	6866160	Yes, you have.
6866160	6867160	Yes, you have.
6867160	6868160	Thanks, dude.
6868160	6869160	All right.
6869160	6872440	So you may mute yourselves, guys, and make your way to the Twitch page so you can see
6872440	6873440	this.
6873440	6874820	And I'm actually gonna be watching this for the first time, too, but I am going to go
6874820	6875820	on mute.
6875820	6879760	I will say for the podcast listeners, this is about an eight and a half minute video.
6879760	6883180	I'm assuming there is going to be gameplay footage of some kind.
6883180	6885580	It may not translate very well to a podcast.
6885580	6887000	I don't know how YYR did this.
6887000	6889580	I don't know because I haven't really seen the video.
6889580	6893440	So if you need to, this segment is about eight and a half minutes.
6893440	6898000	And if you want to see the video, I'm almost certain YYR will put it up on his Twitter
6898000	6903600	at YYR underscore, as well as his website, which is YYR games dot com.
6903600	6904600	Okay.
6904600	6905600	And he says there's voiceover the whole time.
6905600	6906600	So good.
6906600	6909020	He thought of you podcasties and you won't get bored.
6909020	6912900	So if you want to see the video side of it, it will be up on those sites.
6912900	6913900	Absolutely.
6913900	6914900	So it's podcast friendly.
6914900	6915900	All right.
6915900	6919260	Then without further ado, let's get to it.
6919260	6934380	The Pixel Poops Direct from YYR Games.
6934380	6936900	Welcome to Pixel Poops Direct.
6936900	6941460	I'm Aaron Teplitski, creator of Pixel Poops.
6941460	6943460	Let's not mince words here.
6943460	6949020	As you know, 2020 has been the year of shit.
6949020	6954660	Possibly the shittiest year so far in many of our lifetimes.
6954660	6957660	The good news is it's almost over.
6957660	6962020	The bad news is there's one more piece of shit in store for you.
6962020	6966060	Pixel Poops is coming to Steam.
6966060	6967060	That's right.
6967060	6972380	This Atari 2600 inspired pile of shit from 2015 is coming back.
6972380	6977420	Once again, you'll play as an angry human with the highest metabolism imaginable on
6977420	6981700	a mission to exact vengeance on happy, motivated joggers.
6981700	6982700	Why?
6982700	6984040	Because you can.
6984040	6987860	And you're doing it the only way you know how.
6987860	6992700	Small shits will only slow the joggers down, but keep shitting and you'll produce huge
6992700	6994460	piles of shit.
6994460	6996960	These will stop joggers in their tracks.
6996960	6998880	And you'll score a point.
6998880	7004580	And if you manage to combo multiple joggers in a single pile of shit, you get a bonus.
7004580	7005940	Can't shit anymore?
7005940	7006940	No problem.
7006940	7010440	Just head back over to this taco restaurant and eat up.
7010440	7016540	But don't let too many of the joggers get away, or it's game over.
7016540	7019820	So what was the point of bringing this shit back?
7020260	7024820	Well, actually, the Steam version has a lot of new shit.
7024820	7029420	First off, there are three entirely new ways to play.
7029420	7033340	Game two is remix, which switches things up in new ways.
7033340	7036580	Some joggers will now be able to switch direction.
7036580	7039340	You'll also have to look out for this guy.
7039340	7041220	He's a tax collector.
7041220	7042580	His name?
7042580	7044780	Feces.
7044780	7048240	And if he touches you, you'll be fine 10 points.
7048240	7052680	But if you can trap him in a nice warm pile, you'll get double points.
7052680	7058040	Finally, say hello to your ultimate weapon, the poop bomb.
7058040	7062000	Just hold the button down and...
7062000	7065900	This will totally empty your chamber though, so you'll need to hurry and eat some tacos
7065900	7067760	to keep going.
7067760	7072520	And you'll have to score some points before you can use the poop bomb again.
7072520	7077640	Game three is alternate, which allows you to get creative with your shit.
7077640	7082360	Players who reach your small or medium shits will turn 90 degrees to the right.
7082360	7088080	This will allow you to corral them around, hopefully into a nice big steaming pile.
7088080	7093640	Your shits will slowly degrade, but don't worry, you've got more.
7093640	7097640	Last but not least, game four is simple.
7097640	7104440	Many Atari 2600 games have included a mode with simpler gameplay suitable for young children.
7104440	7108640	Poodle Poops now follows in those footsteps so you can share it with your kids.
7108640	7110600	Stuck in poop.
7110600	7113000	Yeah, they went stuck in poop!
7113000	7115160	Isn't that funny?
7115160	7116160	Yeah.
7116160	7117160	More.
7117160	7123480	Joggers are limited to horizontal movement, jumbo shits are easier to make, and trap joggers
7123480	7125200	disappear more quickly.
7125200	7131880	However, this also makes it harder to get combo bonuses, so a challenge still awaits.
7131880	7137160	All four of these games can be enjoyed on normal or hard difficulty levels.
7137160	7140880	And you can also try all of them in time attack mode.
7140880	7146240	In this mode, you'll want to score 200 points as quickly as possible, so combo bonuses are
7146240	7147520	key.
7147520	7151960	There are no penalties for joggers escaping in this mode, so you can also play at whatever
7151960	7153400	pace you like.
7153400	7158440	The game ends when you reach the target score or quit.
7158440	7165040	All told, there are four games, two difficulties, and two modes, adding up to 16 different ways
7165040	7169560	to play, and every one of those will have a Steam leaderboard.
7169560	7172560	There will be achievements to unlock, too.
7172560	7177920	So maybe you're wondering, how much do I need to pay for this shit?
7177920	7182600	Well, Pixel Poops will be free to play!
7182600	7185700	But of course we're gonna do the shitty thing and try to fleece you for money once you try
7185700	7186920	it.
7186920	7189600	So only game one is free.
7189600	7193720	You'll be able to try out the other games briefly, but to complete a full round, you'll
7193720	7197360	need to fork over two dollars.
7197360	7200000	Yep, two dollars.
7200000	7203800	Everything mentioned here is yours for two dollars.
7203800	7204800	But here's the thing.
7204800	7207720	I want to really monetize this shit.
7207720	7210200	So there's other shit for sale, too.
7210200	7212160	Do you like the sound effects?
7212160	7219160	Like and especially.
7219160	7224240	Do you perhaps want to use them in your own projects, in your podcasts, or in your own
7224240	7225240	games?
7225240	7229560	Well, for another two dollars, you can have them and do whatever you like with them.
7229560	7232240	Royalty free.
7232240	7236520	Or maybe you're looking for more shit to play and pay for.
7236520	7239060	Well, I've got you covered there.
7239060	7243580	I would like to proudly introduce Pixel Poops 64.
7243580	7245540	Wait, what?
7245540	7246780	Were you expecting 3D?
7246780	7250340	Oh, oh, you meant that other 64.
7250340	7254780	I was talking about the Commodore 64!
7254780	7258880	This entirely new take on Pixel Poops plays a bit differently.
7258880	7261020	For one thing, there's no restaurant.
7261020	7266940	Instead, you eat food off the ground, like any other self-respecting video game character.
7266940	7271500	There are some other differences as well, mostly due to hardware limitations.
7271500	7275880	I think you'll find it to be a refreshingly shitty new experience.
7275880	7282140	And if you were wondering, yes, this is actually running on an emulated Commodore 64.
7282140	7286180	The game will be distributed as a Commodore 64 disk image.
7286180	7291100	You can play it on an emulator of your choice, or if you've got the right tools, you can
7291100	7295540	make a disk and play it on an actual Commodore 64.
7295540	7297380	And what's the damage?
7297380	7300260	That's right, also $2.
7300260	7305420	And now, if you tell me that you want all this shit, I'll tell you that you're fucking
7305420	7308980	crazy, but also that I'll give you a discount.
7308980	7311140	Five bucks gets it all.
7311140	7314340	I appreciate your support very much.
7314340	7318780	Whether you're looking forward to buying this or not, I'll be posting on the VoG Discord
7318780	7323020	regarding playtesting opportunities, so please look forward to that.
7323020	7328500	You'll be able to try it out for free before it comes out.
7328500	7333780	And as far as when it's hitting the virtual water, it'll be either late December or early
7333780	7338440	January, and if you keep listening to Orange Lounge Radio, you'll be the first to find
7338440	7340540	out for sure.
7340540	7344300	I want to thank you for watching this shitty presentation.
7344300	7352240	We're about to reach its rear end, but there's just one more thing I need to show you.
7352240	7354480	Let's check it out.
7412240	7437920	Yeah, press the Poof button.
7437920	7440100	All right, hold up.
7440100	7442220	I have some questions.
7442220	7445140	Hold up.
7445140	7451940	First off, I just, I have to do this because that was brilliant, YYR.
7451940	7457940	That was so good that I lost the...
7457940	7461700	I no longer regret any of the words that have ever come out of my mouth.
7461700	7463040	You don't regret any of this shit?
7463040	7465040	Is that what you're saying?
7465040	7466040	No.
7466040	7467040	Okay.
7467040	7468040	I...
7468040	7469040	Yeah.
7469040	7470040	Okay.
7470040	7477360	So, am I understanding correctly that Bobby actually made the correct prediction apparently
7477360	7482480	in chat and said this some time ago, that Loki's secret project was so secretive because
7482480	7485680	it kind of like was only part his idea.
7485680	7489760	So Pixel Poops number two is your game, Loki?
7489760	7490760	It is my game.
7490760	7492000	And so here's that.
7492000	7493000	So here's how it started out.
7493000	7501720	So I decided like a while back, like I ran across, like I wanted to make a Nintendo game.
7501720	7502720	Hold up.
7502720	7503720	Hold up.
7503720	7504720	YYR, you get on Discord right now.
7504720	7506600	I know I said the end of the show.
7506600	7511680	You get on Discord right now because you didn't prepare me for that one.
7511680	7512680	That's not fair.
7512680	7513680	It feels like my birthday.
7513680	7518200	It feels like my birthday.
7518200	7519200	It is.
7519200	7520200	It's your late birthday.
7520200	7521200	Join any of the rooms, YYR.
7521200	7522200	I'll pull you in.
7522400	7523400	Okay.
7523400	7524720	So he says he's updating.
7524720	7525720	I'm sorry, Loki.
7525720	7526720	You can continue.
7526720	7527720	Okay.
7527720	7533080	So like, so what it was is that I found the software like called Nest Maker, which is
7533080	7539160	basically it's a kind of a front end to start making Nintendo games, like actual Nintendo
7539160	7540160	games.
7540160	7545920	Granted, the stuff I'm doing, there's a lot of assembly coding, so I had to learn 6502
7545920	7550200	assembler to be able to start doing this, but it's kind of a friend to help you starting
7550200	7551420	not from scratch.
7551420	7554300	So I needed a simple project to do with this.
7554300	7562980	So I thought, okay, I can remake the original Pixel Boost because it's a pretty simple game
7562980	7569300	and that'll help me learn this Nest Maker stuff.
7569300	7571620	But then I decided I wanted to go ahead and do a sequel.
7571620	7577360	So then I like, I kept working on it and originally my plan was I was just going to put it out
7577360	7583000	and say, look, I made this and then like surprise everybody, including YYR, but then I couldn't
7583000	7584400	like keep it a secret.
7584400	7588600	So I had to show him and then he decided, Hey, he's all, Oh, well, I'm also working
7588600	7589600	on this.
7589600	7594360	And then we decided that we're going to kind of work together to do different things.
7594360	7600400	So like I've been working on this completely separate from him, but yeah, it's, it's a
7600400	7601400	Nintendo game.
7601400	7607960	As you saw, it is two players simultaneously, tons of different levels in there, lots of
7607960	7613040	different like themes and stuff, and it's coming along.
7613040	7614040	All right.
7614040	7618800	YYR is here by the way, and he's, he's audio, you're just audio only tonight cause I'm trying
7618800	7620360	to fix the disc, but that's okay.
7620360	7623000	If you're just going to stay audio only, then I don't need to fix it.
7623000	7624000	Yeah.
7624000	7625000	You don't want to see me.
7625000	7627000	I'm not wearing a shirt right now.
7627000	7628000	Okay.
7628000	7629000	That's fine.
7629000	7630000	Keep it off.
7630000	7631000	Keep it off.
7631600	7632600	The webcam is going to look a little messed up.
7632600	7633600	Sorry.
7633600	7634600	During this point, let me just go back.
7634600	7635600	I'll go back to here.
7635600	7636600	You don't have to see me.
7636600	7640480	You can look at, uh, dark soccer, the game idea and Loki, the game maker, which is the,
7640480	7646200	uh, the big gag that we're all just kinda, uh, getting here is that Loki secret game.
7646200	7647800	When did you find out about this YYR?
7647800	7650600	So you've known about Loki secret game project for awhile.
7650600	7657280	And I got, I gotta say with all respect to your game, YYR, you went for a very like kind
7657280	7659240	of old school aesthetic with it.
7659280	7662320	It was a very like Atari 2,600 looking thing.
7662320	7667500	And then when I look at what Loki did, I'm like, this is like way different, but this
7667500	7673380	is like what I would logically expect a graphical upgrade of this sort to look like, if that
7673380	7674380	makes sense.
7674380	7675380	Oh yeah.
7675380	7676600	He really nailed the aesthetic.
7676600	7681640	I the first, that was what I was going for too, yeah.
7681640	7683500	And yes, Bobby, you did call it.
7683500	7685880	It was right before the direct started.
7685880	7690440	He was like, I bet it's actually a YYR game.
7690440	7692720	And I felt I had to respond in chat.
7692720	7694560	Otherwise people would get suspicious.
7694560	7696120	So I was like, that's a stretch.
7696120	7697120	What are you talking about?
7697120	7702720	Well, and to be fair, he had kind of put that out there before when Loki wouldn't talk about
7702720	7704080	it for weeks and weeks.
7704080	7707600	He's like, he's not talking about it cause it's not, it's someone else's game that he's
7707600	7708600	making.
7708600	7711120	And I kind of like, and I honestly, I brushed it off.
7711120	7712960	I was like, what, whose game would he be making?
7712960	7714360	That doesn't make any sense.
7714360	7718140	And now, now that I know it, it's like, Oh my God, of course that, that, that shit was
7718140	7720240	right in front of my face the whole time.
7720240	7723960	So amazing, amazing work YYR.
7723960	7727880	So some folks in chat are saying, I need to see that trailer right now.
7727880	7728880	And I've got you.
7728880	7730880	I'll hook you up in just a sec.
7730880	7731880	Oh, actually.
7731880	7732880	Yeah.
7732880	7733880	Oh, okay.
7733880	7734880	I mean, I have it on YouTube.
7734880	7738600	It's going to go live at midnight Eastern, 9 PM Pacific.
7738600	7742920	And I will post a link if the show is not over by then I'll post a link in chat.
7742920	7747840	Otherwise it'll be on my Twitter, but, uh, if, if you uploaded it also go right ahead.
7747840	7750840	I just feel like this is the best Hanukkah present ever.
7750840	7752340	It's seven nights of shit.
7752340	7755400	I was just about to, I was about to say dark soccer.
7755400	7758400	This whole thing came out of your mouth in the beginning.
7758400	7759400	And how do you feel now?
7759400	7760800	I know I'm already full of shit.
7760800	7764800	Well, but how do you feel knowing not only is it a YYR thing, but this, this is that
7764800	7770800	big mystery you're, you're going to have to buy the man a pizza.
7770800	7777120	By the way, by the way, I'd like to mention that, um, it's also going to be on cartridge.
7777120	7778120	I have cartridges.
7778120	7781120	How are you doing that?
7781120	7783600	I require this to be in my life.
7783600	7784600	Yeah.
7784600	7788680	So, so I have a ROM burner and I've got a cartridges or at least a few.
7788680	7792540	I did a very limited run of those, but, um, I've got that.
7792540	7795240	So once I'm done, I, it will be on physical cartridges.
7795240	7796240	I'm sorry.
7796240	7797240	I'm just going to change the shot.
7797240	7799840	So you can all see how shocked I am right now.
7799840	7800840	Like what?
7800840	7807240	Like Loki just fucking started limited run games too in his basement for his new project.
7807240	7809800	What the hell?
7809800	7810800	This is crazy.
7810800	7816080	But I'm not, I'm never going to be quiet again.
7816080	7819000	Never the first shit that comes to my mind.
7819000	7820760	You never were dark soccer.
7820760	7826560	Let's and that's, that's why we love you and why this show has lasted as long as it has.
7826560	7827560	So, okay.
7827560	7833160	So why we are like, I'm going to be honest, the first part and everything, I kind of expected
7833160	7834160	that.
7834160	7836680	I was like, okay, he's talked about pixel poops going to steam before.
7836680	7837680	Okay.
7837680	7838840	New game modes.
7838840	7844180	Super cool, but like a very Y Y R thing, like a, like a patent thing for your games.
7844180	7846040	You have all these different modes.
7846040	7850700	You've done that since the snake 360 day it's state snake 360 days and it's continued in
7850700	7852160	things like super multitasking.
7852160	7855160	It's like, you can do the multitasking all at once.
7855160	7857160	You can do the multitasking very easy.
7857160	7859200	You can do the multitasking with challenges, right?
7859200	7864560	So like that part, I was like, okay, this is, you know, I'm with it, but now talk me
7864560	7869360	through like the Commodore 64, like where the hell did that come from?
7869360	7875200	Well, so, and it's funny because this, this whole thing started as, as he mentioned, Loki
7875200	7879480	was working on this thing, unbeknownst to anybody, including me.
7879480	7881380	And then, uh, what was that?
7881380	7886320	Maybe like five, six weeks ago, you just like sent me a Twitter message and you were like,
7886320	7893960	Oh, well, by the way, and, and you sent me an animated GIF and we need to talk about
7893960	7906760	intellectual property for a minute, just dump it and release it and it's already dump it.
7906760	7915560	But no, I, I saw that I, he got my full endorsement immediately and, um, yeah, it was like, uh,
7916320	7921340	I had already been toying with the notion of remaking pixel poops and, and putting it
7921340	7922340	on steam.
7922340	7925280	So this just accelerated the process.
7925280	7929640	I literally just dropped everything I was doing with, you know, super multitasking and
7929640	7930640	anything else.
7930640	7933360	I'm like, yeah, you know what, let's do this.
7933360	7936640	And it, it took me a weekend to make the original game.
7936640	7940600	It took me a month to port it to what I'm currently using.
7940600	7944800	And I mean, granted a lot of that was because when I made it, I didn't have a daughter.
7944800	7951800	Um, uh, I was also like, you know, just kind of throwing it together, not publishing it,
7951800	7956320	not really planning around any of the menus or anything that I'm planning on putting in
7956320	7957320	it.
7957320	7961640	But yeah, it, uh, it took a lot longer to, to put that together.
7961640	7967080	And uh, yeah, as far as the extra stuff, uh, I don't know if anyone noticed only people
7967080	7972880	that played games on Atari VCS would notice this, um, the toggling of the difficulty and
7972880	7974520	the toggling of the time attack mode.
7974520	7980240	That is a direct reference to the difficulty A and difficulty B switches on the console
7980240	7981240	itself.
7981240	7984960	I did pick up the way you were saying that like at 16 different gate was a very much
7984960	7986720	like an Atari 2600 thing.
7986720	7988360	Like that would have been on the box art.
7988360	7995080	In fact, I don't want to volunteer Dark Sakura for anything, but I think one way to bring
7995080	7999360	this full circle there, and I don't even know if this is something that's really in your
7999360	8002720	wheelhouse Dark Sakura, but no, not well, yes.
8002720	8009560	That's, that's a given, but like we need classic Atari, 2,600 box art with the thing that says,
8009560	8013200	you know, 16 games that might be, that might be outside your wheelhouse, dark soccer, I
8013200	8018240	don't know, but we need to like commission it or something and I'm willing to do it.
8018240	8019520	You know, I could do it.
8019520	8020520	Okay.
8020520	8025760	I mean, I'd have to break out like my color pencils and do a really fine art shit, but
8025760	8027040	I just, yeah, it was great.
8027040	8031280	And by the way, I lost it cause the chat is bringing up to, I lost it at that text tax
8031280	8033200	collector being named feces.
8033200	8034200	Feces.
8034200	8042120	Now, Loki, did you know about all of the other Pixel Poop stuff or was this all new to you?
8042120	8045200	Did you know about the Pixel Poop 64 where he's actually squatting?
8045200	8046200	Yes.
8046200	8047200	That killed me.
8047200	8048200	Yes.
8048200	8049200	Yes, I did.
8049200	8055640	And, um, I I've actually seen the direct already, but like, um, yeah, he had told me that he
8055640	8058920	was working on the Commodore 64 version and the Steam version stuff.
8058920	8064000	I didn't know about like the, like enhancements or like all of the enhancements and stuff,
8064000	8070640	but, uh, and I hadn't actually seen the Commodore 64 version, but until today and I'll interject
8070640	8077360	the Commodore version existing is a direct result of Pixel Poop's number two existing
8077360	8080040	and me saying, you know what?
8080040	8081560	That sounds like fun.
8081560	8083080	Let me try also.
8083080	8089280	And what I did was I busted out the same exact Gary kitchens game maker that I was using
8089280	8095280	to make games when I was eight and nine and 10 years old and I loaded it up on an emulator
8095280	8097440	and I got to work.
8097440	8098440	Wow.
8098440	8099660	It's awesome.
8099660	8104560	It's just the fact that you're shitting on multi platforms is just killing me.
8104560	8106440	It's it's amazing.
8106440	8107440	Okay.
8107440	8112680	I, I have to see this trailer for the Loki project one more time because I wasn't ready
8112680	8113800	for it.
8113800	8117400	So now I need to watch it one more time now that I have it in my mind.
8117400	8119560	So I think what I can do, and I'm doing this live on the fly.
8119560	8120560	Sorry guys.
8120560	8124080	But I think what I can do if I actually think the movie, I think I can fast forward ahead
8124080	8125080	a little bit here.
8125080	8133240	So here's where, okay, the new game because I can't really go into more details about
8133240	8135200	that either because that would give stuff away.
8135200	8151920	So I, I can't say anything because I can't say any more.
8151920	8152920	I was, I was so shocked.
8152920	8153920	I wasn't even thinking of something.
8153920	8162920	I like the people are actually turning around and there's two, it's a two player game.
8162920	8163920	Yep.
8163920	8182840	And you like a basic fresh in when they're pooping, that's my favorite I'm dying.
8182840	8187720	So here's, here's, so here's my, my next question.
8187720	8193520	If I don't want to play that on a Nintendo, are you doing like a steam release or something?
8193520	8202680	Well, it's supposed to be DLC on the actual pixel poofs one that YR is doing.
8202680	8208280	So you'll be able to, I think it's still going to be a ROM file.
8208280	8214360	There is a way to convert it so that you can play it, you can actually upload it to steam.
8214360	8218360	So there is a way to do that for NES ROM files.
8218360	8223000	I mean, basically what it's doing is it's just including an emulator so that you double
8223040	8227800	click the game in your library and it launches the NES emulator in the game automatically.
8227800	8229840	All right.
8229840	8235160	And Bobby, there are low key, there are a lot of people asking in chat about the cartridge.
8235160	8236760	Like people are freaking out.
8236760	8237760	Yeah.
8237760	8241760	Like I didn't get many, like I said, cause you know, cartridges are not cheap.
8241760	8244960	So I have six, Oh my God right now.
8244960	8249400	But I mean, that's just because I didn't want to like go all in with like a hundred of them
8249400	8250400	or something.
8250400	8252520	Let me hold on a second.
8252520	8255200	So how much do these cartridges run?
8255200	8262840	I don't remember off the hand, I think it's like at least, I think 15 for the board and
8262840	8263840	I don't remember.
8263840	8268480	I'd have to look at my own voices, but basically, so like it's got, it's even got the sleeve,
8268480	8269480	which is kind of cool.
8269480	8271640	So these are from France.
8271640	8275560	So they've got the actual, this is empty.
8275560	8279880	So I actually have the boards right here.
8279880	8284320	So I've got the actual, this is a mapper 30 board.
8284320	8288360	It's green screening out cause it's a green board, but that's all right.
8288360	8289360	It's fine.
8289360	8290880	Well, it's a mapper 30 board.
8290880	8294040	It's got, um, I don't know how to necessarily do it yet.
8294040	8298260	Cause like I said, I'm still kind of new to the nest of stuff, but it has flash memory
8298260	8302560	on it instead of member, like the old Zelda and stuff like that, where it actually had
8302560	8305700	saved memory, but it had like an actual battery on it.
8305700	8309120	This is flash memory now, but it operates in the same manner as that.
8309120	8313640	So you could potentially, if I'm good enough to do that, um, have a high score table or
8313640	8314640	something like that.
8314640	8315640	Wow.
8315640	8318560	I may, may try to add if I get a point to do that.
8318560	8324760	Um, but the mean, you know, right now I wanted to get like the basic, so it's been a challenge
8324760	8329640	obviously with the NES, cause you have to fit everything into the ROM size there.
8329640	8336400	So, um, I have, well, I have an original soundtrack of three songs that I had commissioned done
8336400	8340760	by this guy, cosmic gem, who does a lot of mega man fan games, as you might've noticed
8340760	8345040	that sounds kind of mega man-ish in the trailer.
8345040	8346660	I didn't even think about that music.
8346660	8349320	I just figured you lifted it from free music archive or something.
8349320	8351040	No, no, no, no.
8351040	8352040	Completely original.
8352040	8355040	Oh my God.
8355040	8359280	We're going to be able to have like an OLR soundtrack between what Jamie does, what you
8359280	8360280	do.
8360280	8364880	And by the way, there's a gag coming up at about like 10 minutes when it comes to music
8364880	8369240	and this show that you get, you guys know what I'm talking about, that email we got
8369240	8370240	last week.
8370240	8375320	And when I heard that I was like, Oh my God, this is so much talent around the OLR universe
8375320	8376320	is crazy.
8376320	8378000	So there is one song.
8378000	8382240	So there there's three songs, the title song and two levels songs that commission from
8382240	8387000	somebody that to do those, um, you already have a more diverse soundtrack than dragon
8387000	8388000	quest 11.
8388000	8389960	Good job.
8389960	8392520	And then there is another song that was one of those.
8392520	8395220	It was on, uh, the open game art sites.
8395220	8398780	So it's a, it's a, uh, creative commons, but it's another song.
8398780	8403560	So that's, that's all I could fit in my audio because like I had to create, you know, sound
8403560	8405360	effects for all the poop sound effects.
8405360	8407780	So some of the fun things that are in the game.
8407780	8411800	So like for example, the pause screen, you can still move your character or you can move
8411800	8415640	your characters in place so you can actually like dance around and stuff like that.
8415640	8417040	And the pause screen is just kind of fun.
8417040	8421840	And then at the end of when you beat a level, you actually goes into this little celebration
8421880	8426240	animation, but you can also move around and then do like the, the funny squatting things.
8426240	8427240	Cause I love that face.
8427240	8431160	The face is hilarious and it's just funny to do that.
8431160	8436920	So, um, yeah, there's lots of little Easter eggs.
8436920	8439800	I may have thrown some cheat codes in there as well.
8439800	8440800	Oh my God.
8440800	8441800	Okay.
8441800	8442800	I'm sorry.
8442800	8447480	This is running so long, but like y'all blindsided me with this and her.
8447480	8451320	Now I understand why I got that message from YYR that was like, you're probably gonna want
8451320	8456560	to talk to me right after errors, like for two bucks a pop, by the way.
8456560	8457560	Oh my gosh.
8457560	8458560	All right.
8458560	8463000	So anyway, w the cartridge thing, Loki, you'll have to figure that out on your own.
8463000	8468560	Obviously I was thinking it was, I have to look, but I was trying to target someone cause
8468560	8472360	I also still have to do label printing and all that and packaging.
8472360	8475360	So I was targeting somewhere around 40 bucks, but I don't know.
8475360	8476360	Yeah.
8476360	8480260	I have to, there's easily at least five people in chat that are going to pay that right now.
8480260	8486140	If not, if not more than that person sitting in this chair who will, I would say, go ahead,
8486140	8487140	open pre-orders.
8487140	8491060	I mean, get a number so that you know how many you need to be fair.
8491060	8493700	He says he hasn't completed the, I love how we're just talking.
8493700	8494700	Now.
8494700	8495700	We're all your managers, Loki.
8495700	8496700	All right.
8496700	8500080	So he says he hasn't completed the process yet and hasn't done it.
8500080	8503960	So let him get through that whole process to make sure it's, you know, error free and
8503960	8506220	he has it the way he likes it.
8506220	8509420	Then open up the pre-orders cause you don't want to end up on that Kickstarter thing where
8509420	8513340	you're like, I'm going to get all this money for this thing that I fucked up and I can't
8513340	8514340	make it.
8514340	8515340	So exactly.
8515340	8518860	And as Bobby puts out, let, let me make one exactly.
8518860	8520620	And that's definitely the goal.
8520620	8523980	I still have to learn the, how to do, I've got all the hardware to do.
8523980	8528060	I just have to learn the process and it's the, what's great though is like, if you are
8528060	8534680	interested in this software, so nest maker is, um, what I, I started off using granted.
8534680	8537760	You can build an NES game without coding.
8537760	8542200	If you want a grant, it's going to be incredibly basic, but you could do that.
8542200	8543720	Um, and I highly recommend it.
8543720	8545720	It's like 40 bucks for the software.
8545720	8550000	Granted the stuff I'm doing now I'm completely, there's not a lot of documentation.
8550000	8554200	They do a good job with like some tutorial videos, but it's a lot of intro stuff, like
8554200	8555480	really beginner things.
8555480	8559700	So a lot of stuff I'm having to learn on the fly and figure out how this stuff works.
8559700	8563660	So I'm like rewriting a lot of their like input systems and stuff like that.
8563660	8568580	So you can get and do some pretty complicated things out there, but like it is definitely
8568580	8570540	a fun tool to play around with.
8570540	8575460	Uh, so if you go to the new eight bit heroes, uh, dot com, they sell and that's maker there.
8575460	8580000	There's a link to, you can get started with like the actual hardware, like burning a cart.
8580000	8584980	I did my first cart through there, um, cause it came with the actual writer.
8584980	8590260	Um, but then the other like five additional ones I tried through this French site, um,
8590260	8591260	that just opened up.
8591260	8598340	So, um, but I, like I said, I, I'd have to price it out, but, um, yeah, I highly recommend
8598340	8599340	checking it out.
8599340	8600340	It's a lot of fun.
8600340	8602260	I mean, I've had a lot of fun putting it together.
8602260	8603820	Um, definitely.
8603820	8608980	I'm finally glad I can talk about it now, no progress, cause it's like, I was like,
8608980	8610660	I need to tell somebody.
8610660	8614900	Um, but yeah, it's, it's been ongoing.
8614900	8618220	Like um, was it this, uh, why we are seeing you earlier?
8618220	8621980	He's like, yeah, I don't like, you know, the direction thing's not working well.
8621980	8623660	He needs to move diagonal and stuff like that.
8623660	8628740	So I have to rewrite the input system to allow that, but I finally learned how to do that.
8628740	8629740	It's all assembly.
8629740	8637780	Like I've never programmed in assembly before, but yeah, it's, and it's just a lot of challenges
8637780	8640020	cramming it all in that ROM size.
8640020	8641020	Cramming all that shit in there.
8641020	8643020	Um, did that a documentary?
8643020	8644020	Yeah.
8644020	8645160	Yeah, it is.
8645160	8647380	So yeah, mystic searches is his game that he's got.
8647380	8648380	He did a documentary.
8648380	8649380	It's on Amazon.
8649380	8653260	Um, great community on their Etsy too.
8653260	8654260	Yeah.
8654260	8655260	Yeah.
8655260	8656260	It's a, it's a great community.
8656260	8660340	There's lots of nest maker games out there that people, then there's some guys, um, like
8660340	8665400	there's a cutter cross on there that they have some really like crazy games that they've
8665400	8666400	made with it.
8666400	8668220	Like there's one they're doing right now.
8668220	8673100	It's a point and click adventure game and they've actually gotten, I don't know how
8673100	8678380	they did it, but they've gotten the, the super NES Mario paint mouse to work with it
8678380	8679380	on an NES.
8679380	8680380	I don't know.
8680380	8685540	It's just some crazy stuff, but like the whole, you know, nest dev seems pretty cool.
8685540	8692220	Um, so definitely go check it out, but, um, yeah, it's, I'm definitely excited about it.
8692220	8693540	I'm still working on it.
8693540	8696220	I'm trying to get it done this year.
8696220	8698540	Um, I'm shooting for this year.
8698540	8701780	You know, something I was going to say, like, you know, and you've been talking about, oh,
8701780	8703060	I finally got the playable loop.
8703060	8704060	I've got all this.
8704060	8708100	And when I look at that footage, I'm like, oh my God, this really is like done.
8708100	8713180	Like this isn't like the time to car thing where you, it was not really like, like you
8713180	8716020	had an idea there, but it wasn't like really fleshed out.
8716020	8717060	And I'm looking at it.
8717060	8722160	I'm looking at this and I'm like, this is, this is ready.
8722160	8725180	It's because I did it the right way this time.
8725180	8726180	I did.
8726180	8727180	Yay.
8727180	8728180	Good job.
8728180	8735780	And you, you could say, see, Bobby's been yelling at you for, since day one, you need
8735780	8741020	to make a game based on an existing game.
8741020	8744500	So we're like trying to figure out the storyline for this game.
8744500	8748540	I still haven't quite figured that out and I get it, but like, there's not really a story
8748540	8754460	to it, but like, like we've, I've run across like so many like dumb ideas and I'm definitely
8754460	8758380	going to go with the dumbest of them whenever I figure out what that is.
8758380	8763660	It's just like, like, oh yeah, you know, one of them was like something about like that,
8763660	8767540	the taco stands were actually like, they've taken over the world.
8767540	8768700	There's so many of them.
8768700	8774180	That's why you see in like one of the then the trailer there, there's one in a graveyard,
8774180	8776380	you know, there's, there's your taco stands.
8776380	8780020	Like they actually have to be the Crips.
8780020	8781940	So it's just ridiculous stuff like that.
8781940	8783700	And yeah, there's like different characters.
8783740	8785500	So like there's the ghost you saw there.
8785500	8788940	I don't have an infant mind yet, but it's going to disappear.
8788940	8793460	And so it'll be invisible and you have to like a capture or I'm going to, I started
8793460	8804220	doing like a dog that actually eats the smaller pieces of, so like, you know, strange stuff
8804220	8805220	like that.
8805220	8809140	But yeah, it's, I, like I said, the segment has gone on a very long time, but I'm sorry.
8809140	8816020	I'm blown away because I just did not realize that you two were going to essentially buddy
8816020	8820820	up in a way and really deliver on this idea.
8820820	8823420	And of course not to, I know we're really focusing on Loki's game, but that's because
8823420	8827000	that's been a central plot of this show for like the past year.
8827000	8832180	So to have it just, you know, subtly revealed as a one more thing here is, is I wasn't prepared
8832180	8833180	for that.
8833180	8834180	Thank you.
8834180	8837300	But certainly not to overshadow what you're doing on your own to YYR is that, you know,
8837300	8840620	again, the Commodore 64, you've got the sound effects in there.
8840620	8843820	You're still charging, not nearly enough money for it.
8843820	8847420	And the world is going to thank you for it.
8847420	8849100	This is, this is great.
8849100	8856020	I, you know, I, it's, this is funny because, uh, it's dark soccer's idea.
8856020	8859700	YYR made the game, Loki made the new game.
8859700	8863740	I did literally nothing on this.
8863740	8865580	I still promoted.
8865580	8866580	I guess so.
8866580	8870340	I still feel like there's a part of me.
8870340	8879620	That's so excited about like, I had a hand in this somehow.
8879620	8880620	I did.
8880620	8881620	I had a hand in this somehow.
8881620	8885860	So there's, and Bobby Blackwell says I had nothing to do with this, but you were the,
8885860	8887460	you were the first to figure it out.
8887460	8889380	So you, you know, it's true.
8889380	8890380	So anyway.
8890380	8891380	Okay.
8891380	8894820	I've got to try and move on with the show, obviously says that you had shit to do with
8894820	8895820	it.
8896060	8900420	Well, obviously we're going to hear more about this in the coming months or really weeks,
8900420	8906380	because, uh, you said, I know you said December or January let's set the expectation January.
8906380	8912620	I think in order for it to release in December, it would have had to be out before the winter
8912620	8913620	sale.
8913620	8918740	And like, since, since you have to have the store page completely finished, including
8918740	8923500	the trailers, the screenshots, all the texts, everything, and then it has to be in coming
8923500	8928020	soon status for two weeks before the game comes out, I would literally have to have
8928020	8929020	everything ready.
8929020	8933740	And I think two days, it's just not going to happen.
8933740	8936740	So it's January.
8936740	8942980	And by the way, I have no problem taking a back seat to, I, I was just as blown away
8942980	8947100	by what Loki has been doing as anybody else.
8947100	8949300	I it's amazing.
8949300	8952700	And the graphics are fantastic and the music is great.
8952700	8956700	And I can't wait to, well, I have played it in the early version, but I can't wait to
8956700	8959140	play the final full thing.
8959140	8960180	And it's awesome.
8960180	8962820	And I'm honored to be able to publish it.
8962820	8967180	He couldn't have done it without you and you couldn't have done it without her.
8967180	8971800	So, and I'm just sitting here real happy right now, cause this is all awesome.
8971800	8975860	Like I'm just, I, I feel like I'm on ground, the starting ground of this whole thing.
8975860	8980220	And I'm just like, I, and people in chat are talking about, they need to speed read that
8980220	8982420	at awesome games done quick.
8982420	8984880	It's a perfect candidate for the awful games block.
8984880	8985880	But we mean that with love.
8985880	8990020	The thing is, I don't think it's an awful game, but it would fit in with the Cuso Grande.
8990020	8999900	Well, look, if Loki, if Cuso means shit, Loki, YYR, if that game shows up in the awful games
8999900	9003520	done quick compliment or insult.
9003520	9004520	I would be happy.
9004520	9005520	I don't care.
9005520	9006520	That's what I thought.
9006520	9009380	No publicity is bad publicity.
9009380	9010380	Exactly.
9011380	9015700	I, I'm, I'd be happy that that shit would be getting out in front of more eyeballs and
9015700	9018340	Bob Bobby's volunteer to host it.
9018340	9021580	So now I really, then I better be the one to speed run it.
9021580	9022580	All right.
9025740	9027900	I guess I have a new purpose in life.
9027900	9028900	Oh my gosh.
9028900	9029900	All right.
9029900	9031940	Well, we're going to be hearing more and more about this in the coming weeks.
9031940	9034300	Cause now look, he gets to openly talk about the project.
9034300	9036980	So, and he's talked about some of the things that still need to be done there.
9036980	9039900	YYR, please keep us posted for the release date on Steam.
9039900	9042820	We're going to do all we can to help you out.
9042820	9046620	Please try to, and, and I will help you get into contact with some other podcasts too.
9046620	9048620	If you need it, try to get the word out.
9048620	9053700	Your games are so fucking good and they deserve to be discovered.
9053700	9056940	The success that these indie studios are having, you deserve it as well.
9056940	9058580	And this isn't just with the poopy thing.
9058580	9062700	This is what super multitasking and all the brilliant things you've done.
9062700	9064020	I really hope for the best for you.
9064020	9065020	I really do.
9065020	9066020	Thank you.
9066060	9067060	That's a lot.
9067060	9068060	Well, it's, it's well-deserved.
9068060	9069060	It's awesome.
9069060	9070060	Yeah.
9070060	9071060	You're awesome sauce.
9071060	9072060	Thanks so much.
9072060	9073060	All right.
9073060	9077140	Well, I couldn't have done it without all of you.
9077140	9078140	Even me?
9078140	9079140	Yes.
9079140	9080140	Even you Rob.
9080140	9081140	Even me.
9081140	9082140	All right.
9082140	9083140	All right.
9083140	9084140	Well, thank you so much.
9084140	9085140	Okay.
9085140	9086140	I'm going to let you go.
9086140	9087140	We're going to hear from you in the coming weeks.
9087140	9088140	You'll be back when the game's ready to release.
9088140	9092140	When you, when you're ready to do your big dump on Steam.
9092140	9093420	These jokes are never going to get old.
9093420	9094420	We're 40.
9094420	9097100	I'm in my four all in our forties at this point.
9097100	9098820	And these jokes are not getting old.
9098820	9100820	So there you go.
9100820	9101820	All right.
9101820	9102820	Take care, buddy.
9102820	9103820	I'm going to move back to one of the other channels.
9103820	9104820	Have a good one.
9104820	9105820	Yup.
9105820	9106820	Bye.
9106820	9110260	Does anyone actually have a clip of me talking about the pixel shit?
9110260	9115620	Because I really don't remember why, why are the first trailer video?
9115620	9116620	Yeah.
9116620	9118420	I think the original video had it.
9118420	9119420	Yeah.
9119420	9126380	I'm, I'm like crying from like laughing, but also just like the shock of, of the Loki's
9126380	9128260	game was that.
9128260	9129260	But it makes so much sense.
9129260	9136540	I went from having a really terrible morning with a very hard emotional blow to now riding
9136540	9138820	this weird high.
9138820	9140300	Some sort of in between.
9140300	9143580	I don't, my, my brain's confused on feelings.
9143580	9144980	I know it's good.
9144980	9150300	It's this weird thing where this show has truly come full circle.
9150300	9155760	You know, like we started like talking about gay, I'm talking like it's the last episode.
9155760	9163220	It's not, but yes, it's one of the things we've, we've looped the loop because now the,
9163220	9164220	this really is.
9164220	9169300	And what Loki's doing here, this product, I mean, it's one thing when it was YYR's thing,
9169300	9174460	because, oh, he's, he's, he's like a listener and he's, he's like outside the bubble, so
9174460	9175460	to speak.
9175460	9179820	And he's putting out this product and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, but now Loki's a part
9179820	9180820	of that too.
9180820	9186140	Who's been here since day one on OLR and, and it's like now the show that talks about
9186140	9189640	games has essentially in a way produced a game.
9189640	9194700	And again, even though I'm the one uploading the MP3s every week, I had nothing to do with
9194700	9197140	this.
9197140	9202300	And it feels really good.
9202300	9203820	I just get to play it.
9203820	9204820	That's true.
9204820	9206140	Bobby says, Loki hasn't finished it yet.
9206140	9207140	That's right.
9207140	9208140	We got to give you time.
9208140	9211600	The last 10% is the longest 90% or something like that, right?
9211600	9212600	So it's content.
9212600	9213600	Yeah.
9213600	9215100	I have to add all the content.
9215100	9220680	That's where I had to like rush to get multiple levels because it was just, well, the first
9220680	9225300	level is actually the third level now, but, uh, it's just over and over and over.
9225300	9230000	I, I should really, you guys should see like some of the actual things cause like before
9230000	9236660	each like actual, cause there's worlds technically, um, has like a little like image and stuff.
9236660	9238220	And it's, Oh, that's kind of funny.
9238220	9239220	Some of that.
9239220	9240220	Okay.
9240220	9242100	I have one more question and then we got to, we really have to move on with the show cause
9242100	9243100	it's almost nine o'clock.
9243100	9245140	We're going to have to kind of rapid fire the rest of the show.
9245140	9252100	But my question for Loki is, did the music guy know what he was making music for?
9252100	9253980	Yes, he did.
9253980	9254980	He did.
9255660	9259500	I, he, he, he was just cool with it.
9259500	9263060	Um, like I told him exactly, I gave him a description of what it was.
9263060	9265180	I showed him YYRs game.
9265180	9271620	I had already like some of the graphics and everything done or actually, uh, the, the
9271620	9275500	animated GIF I sent to YYR, I sent to that guy as well.
9275500	9278380	So he well aware of what he was making.
9278380	9279380	Wow.
9279380	9284840	Um, and funny enough, like I actually, that was an investment bringing him in and a smart
9284840	9288600	one because I think that's going to, I think just the music alone there, like YYR said
9288600	9290880	is like music is fantastic.
9290880	9297560	The music is literally good listening to it in my car every day, like every day been listening
9297560	9298560	to it in my car.
9298560	9302360	And like the theme, because the song that played is just one, that's the first level
9302360	9303360	theme.
9303360	9306920	So the, the actual theme song is its own thing too.
9306920	9312080	And then the second level theme, I haven't actually, um, put in a level yet.
9312080	9315640	I'm thinking like a snow level, but, uh, it's all good.
9315640	9316640	All of it.
9316640	9317640	Frozen shit.
9317640	9318640	Brown snow.
9318640	9319640	It's just going to be slippery.
9319640	9324960	Um, so all of it is going to be just, it's such a good soundtrack.
9324960	9328560	I'm excited.
9328560	9329920	Kudos to both of you.
9329920	9334720	I'm, you know, obviously I'm going to buy anything YYR makes because he's, he doesn't
9334720	9339180	charge enough for it and they're always, you know, so, so good, but just knowing that now
9339180	9342460	you've like evolved it, I think is a good word for it.
9342460	9344940	I don't want to, I don't want to say elevated.
9344940	9349700	I would say like evolved, I think is a good word and like made it like a very, you took
9349700	9351460	a very dark soccer idea.
9351460	9358100	You took a YYR execution and then you somehow made these a Loki thing is with, with professional
9358100	9360900	help where you needed it, like with the music and things like that.
9360900	9363620	And maybe areas that weren't your comfort zone.
9363620	9367660	I tried, I've learned enough of, I learned enough of Famitrack because that's the thing
9367660	9368780	about Nest Maker too.
9368780	9374740	Like Nest Maker has its quirks cause it uses this a library called like GG sound or something
9374740	9375740	like that.
9375740	9379140	And it has, it's very quirky on how it works with audio.
9379140	9385300	So I had to fix a lot of things in like so it was, that was a complicated process just
9385300	9389980	to get the music in there and trying to cram it within the ROM size because those songs
9389980	9393980	are very complicated and they take up a lot of space.
9393980	9396420	So I was like, I need more music other than these three songs.
9396420	9403300	I was like, okay, I got to cram like a song in there and it was tricky, but I did manage
9403300	9406980	to get one more song in there and that's about all I can fit without bank switching.
9406980	9410500	And I don't really know how to do that very well.
9410500	9411500	All right.
9411500	9415620	Well, to be continued, this is just the beginning of the saga, I'm sure that's been ongoing
9415620	9416620	on the show.
9416620	9419980	And that's why I'm spending so much time on it because you know, this has been a product
9419980	9421580	you've been talking about for a long time.
9421580	9427420	And I, I just, again, it's the, the answer was so obvious and right in front of our face,
9427420	9433260	but I just, ah, the Loki's got the Loki hat came up with some crazy idea and you did.
9433260	9436700	And it's, it's, yeah, it's great.
9436700	9437700	Love seeing it.
9437700	9438700	So excited to play it.
9438700	9441700	So excited to become the world record speed runner.
9441700	9442700	In the game.
9442700	9448220	Here's, I'll finish it off with the last bit and I don't know if you noticed, but because
9448220	9453860	your character is pooping a lot, I don't know if you noticed, but the character, when he
9453860	9460520	runs up on the screen, you'll notice that there is a hole cut out of the backside where
9460520	9461780	it would be coming out.
9461780	9465900	Cause obviously obviously you can't go through your clothes.
9465900	9473380	So it's the fine details like that.
9473380	9474640	We know what he's doing.
9474640	9477520	He's accidentally.
9477520	9483320	So I just next on your next rewatch of the trailer, be sure to look for that.
9483320	9484320	Hold on.
9484320	9485320	I'm sorry.
9485320	9489320	If it goes till 10 o'clock tonight, I'm not apologizing because we're going to get these
9489320	9490320	answers.
9490320	9494960	You're fucking crazy as far as when it's hitting the road.
9494960	9495960	I'm sorry.
9495960	9496960	I'm sorry.
9496960	9514160	Just on the back.
9514160	9516640	He's either ready for a hot date or a lot of poop.
9516640	9518640	I can't stop crying.
9518640	9519640	Okay.
9519640	9522640	All right.
9522640	9523640	Let's try to get over there.
9523640	9525560	We're going to rapid fire the rest of the show here and try to get through.
9525560	9526560	Oh my God.
9527160	9528160	Another big thing we got to talk about.
9528160	9529160	Oh my God.
9529160	9530160	We got to.
9530160	9531160	Okay.
9531160	9532160	Let's get to it.
9532160	9533160	Rapid fire news.
9533160	9534160	Low key.
9534160	9535160	Mario Kart's getting it.
9535160	9536160	Arcade's getting a mode with infinite shells.
9536160	9537560	That's kind of crazy.
9537560	9540640	So that's going to be something that they're going to be patching into Mario Kart arcade
9540640	9544580	grand Prix DX this week coming December 10th.
9544580	9550360	So if you can find someplace that's not under quarantine, you can go check it out.
9550360	9554380	And then also it looks like the doom guy is going to be coming to fall guys soon.
9554380	9556480	So that's pretty cool.
9556480	9559280	I'm guessing part of the next season.
9559280	9560280	All right.
9560280	9561280	Also coming up.
9561280	9563900	Pax is planning the events for next year.
9563900	9567720	And I know that might seem a little bold when we're still in a pandemic, but with the vaccine
9567720	9571420	on the way, there are folks that are really hoping we might be able to get back to some
9571420	9575500	of that convention spirit who knows next summer, at least that's what they've announced for
9575500	9577060	the next Pax East.
9577060	9581060	This is notable because Pax East is normally around like the March, April timeframe.
9581060	9582620	I think one year it was in February.
9582620	9583620	I'm sorry, guys.
9583860	9587820	I haven't been to Pax East in a few years, so I forget the exact days and timeframe,
9587820	9588820	but it is interesting.
9588820	9592220	They are bumping it back to June so they can hopefully actually have it.
9592220	9593300	I think there's a lot of hope.
9593300	9596860	And you know, when you listen to some things in the government, there's the when I'm talking
9596860	9603260	like Dr. Fauci and you know, those folks that care about COVID actually say that we could
9603260	9605260	see a sense of normalcy by May or June.
9605260	9606580	I hope we are.
9606580	9607580	That is very true.
9607580	9611640	And we can have a Pax East June 3rd through 6th in Boston, but they are going out of their
9611680	9616160	way to say, if it's not safe, we're not doing it.
9616160	9617160	We're only going to do it.
9617160	9619760	But they want to kind of let people clear their calendars for that.
9619760	9621520	So that's pretty cool.
9621520	9627000	September 3rd through the 6th in Seattle, although obviously us here at VOG Network,
9627000	9629120	we tend to go to Dragon Con instead.
9629120	9632840	But if you are in the Seattle area, hey, cool, you can go to that.
9632840	9637160	And then Pax Unplugged will be back in Philadelphia in December.
9637160	9641540	They will not be having a Pax South in 2021.
9641540	9645100	This is just because they had to move the other things around.
9645100	9647420	They're looking to bring that back in 2022.
9647420	9649100	So you know, fingers and toes crossed.
9649100	9657640	I'm trying not to get too hopeful, but hey, if Dr. Fauci and the other doctors of the
9657640	9661100	world out there say, take the vaccine, you know what I'm going to do, I'm going to take
9661100	9662100	the vaccine.
9662100	9667240	So let's hope it helps.
9667240	9670320	Other things to look forward to, WATAM.
9670320	9672720	This is the game from the Katamari Damacy creator.
9672720	9676480	It was an Epic exclusive when it originally came out on PC.
9676480	9682720	But now Keita Takahashi's game WATAM will now be out on Steam as of December 18th.
9682720	9688560	And that's about a year after it originally debuted on the Epic Game Store.
9688560	9691000	So I don't know if Dark Soccer, you ever got a chance to play that game.
9691000	9692000	I never did.
9692000	9693720	I somehow always missed it.
9693720	9697620	But I'll be checking that out probably when it makes its way to Steam, since I'm going
9697620	9700500	to be using Steam to play all these new games that were announced tonight.
9700500	9701500	That's for sure.
9701500	9704860	Dark Soccer, what do you have for Rapid Fire News?
9704860	9712020	I, King of Fighters 15 had a trailer drop with Shunai being the main character coming
9712020	9713020	through.
9713020	9720040	We should be seeing the release coming out on January 7th, 2021.
9720040	9721500	So cool.
9721500	9728660	And other news, um, uh, Sega, um, it will actually, it looks like this might have our,
9728660	9734620	you know, it's still running through from the second until the eighth is, uh, uh, there
9734620	9739580	is a Sega and stand up to cancer or teaming up for live streams to raise awareness and
9739580	9741620	fund for cancer research.
9741620	9748300	So, um, we, on the seventh is the next big one where, uh, Sega Europe is playing Total
9748300	9751020	War Warhammer 2, Alien Isolation and Sonic Mania.
9751020	9758700	Um, and on the eighth, uh, Relic Entertainment will be looking at, uh, some of their games.
9758700	9761940	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
9761940	9764540	I'm, I'm thinking it might finally be slowing down this week.
9764540	9765540	No.
9765540	9766540	No.
9766540	9767540	Oh my God.
9767540	9768540	All right.
9768540	9769540	Let's get through them.

9855620	9857180	If we have anything there.
9857180	9858300	I don't think we do this.
9858300	9862180	Oh, Puyo Puyo Tetris two is also out this week on the PlayStation five and that is the
9862180	9867700	soul release this week on PS five quickly checking the PlayStation four.
9867700	9870780	I doubt we're going to see things that are very different.
9870780	9876160	Um, I do see that cyberpunk 2077 does get a Japanese release as well, so that must be
9876160	9877380	a worldwide thing.

9950060	9951060	All right.
9951060	9954140	We're going to do some more stories for you guys, but as I mentioned, since we're running
9954140	9958460	a little long, because I was not able to plan appropriately because the secret was withheld
9958460	9960060	from me for a very long time.
9960060	9962140	Uh, Oh, I see what you did there.
9962140	9967100	Loki, you switched your footage out because of what pod culture said in chat, huh?
9967100	9970540	So now he's got a footage of the new game running behind him there.
9970540	9971540	Very cute touch.
9971540	9972540	All right.
9972540	9974020	So we're going to do some, uh, quick news stories here.
9974020	9976220	We're just going to kind of run through these rapid fire styles.
9976220	9979900	Cause I definitely want to get to the mailbag because, uh, we have, uh, something really
9979900	9980900	cool in there too.
9980900	9984540	We got to get to, so, uh, uh, Loki, why don't you start us off?
9984540	9988620	Uh, so this was the end of season four, uh, Fortnite.
9988620	9995260	So it ended with a fight against Galactus and a lot of Marvel tie-in stuff and copyright
9995260	9996260	music.
9996260	9998540	Uh, it was pretty cool looking.
9998540	10007180	So after all that, of course, um, you know, the map changed and brought back now, uh,
10007180	10008180	lots of new stuff.
10008180	10014300	So they have season five, which is zero point, and they've got lots of different crossovers
10014300	10016900	going on, including the Mandalorian.
10016900	10024100	Um, they also added a brand new, uh, season pass type thing that you can subscribe to
10024100	10025340	as well.
10025340	10027900	Um, lots of stuff.
10027940	10032780	So, um, yeah, I dunno, it was pretty interesting.
10032780	10037500	And then, um, apparently there is also going to be some more crossovers with different
10037500	10039460	characters from a console.
10039460	10045460	So the first, of course being announced was, uh, Kratos is going to be in Fortnite as well
10045460	10050500	on, uh, the, I'm assuming the PlayStation four version, but maybe the skins can be on
10050500	10056500	all platforms, um, lots of tie-ins they've got lots of crossovers.
10056500	10059460	That's one thing that's really been a thing in a Fortnite.
10059460	10062180	So Fortnite is such a part of pop culture now.
10062180	10063180	Yeah.
10063180	10066940	So I'm curious to see what else is going to be coming soon, but, uh, the thought is that
10066940	10073020	there's going to be more, um, uh, crossovers, including possibly master chief.
10073020	10074980	So we'll have to see.
10074980	10075980	Interesting.
10075980	10076980	All right.
10076980	10081340	Well, um, if you are somebody who plays and streams on Twitch, like I'm sure many of you
10081340	10085300	are getting ready to stream Loki's game on Twitch, whenever it does release next year,
10085300	10090500	uh, will, uh, you might sometimes tag your streams with different categories.
10090500	10095380	Um, and the very first time you stream something, sometimes the community has referred to that
10095380	10100500	historically as a blind playthrough, but it was pointed out by, um, you know, folks in
10100500	10105980	the community who happen to be blind and other folks with disabilities, uh, that maybe blind
10105980	10113140	playthrough is not exactly, um, it's not the best language, you know, it's, it's, uh, and
10113140	10118580	they actually say here, uh, in a comment, yeah, it's ableist, an able game, the able
10118580	10123980	gamer COO, um, explains just as we used to say gay, when something was bad, using disability
10123980	10128340	terms as an alternate word for a negative situation or feeling is common in today's
10128340	10129340	language.
10129340	10133000	But just as we stopped saying gay to mean bad, we can stop saying these words to think
10133000	10135180	about the words that you choose.
10135180	10140260	And they, so this applies to the blind play through tag former, um, on Twitch, they have
10140260	10144340	changed it to a more appropriate name, which would be first play through.
10144340	10146620	And I think that's, I mean, that's what it is anyway.
10146620	10149660	And I think there's probably, you know, there's probably a lot of people that were kind of
10149660	10152020	wondering like, what does that mean anyway?
10152020	10156860	So I honestly, I think from all angles, you know, just the fact that it's, it's a little
10156860	10161740	more sensitive to, um, the disabled community who, who likes to stream games on Twitch and
10161740	10162740	plenty of them.
10162740	10169640	I think it's, I think it's great that we have a better term that just tells what it is.
10169640	10176640	So if you want to stream your first play through of Pixel Poops 64 or Pixel Poops 2 or whatever
10176640	10181480	it is, uh, you can use first play through would be the right, uh, uh, words to use that.
10181480	10184560	So pretty cool, uh, dark soccer.
10184560	10191200	We have, um, I'm not going to go into a lot of detail on this one, but it's talking about
10191200	10199240	how fashion and video games are really starting to discover a sort of a marriage, um, uh,
10199240	10205280	Video games are basically becoming a, a, a virtual runway for different fashion designers.
10205280	10210840	Like, um, and I'll even go back, like back in the day, I used to, um, download like designer
10210840	10218200	clothes for my Sims where the people had put all this effort into, into making, um, and
10218200	10223960	even their own fashion, even actual fashion designers are using games like the Sims or
10223960	10230320	Second Life or anything else to, you know, to, uh, to kind of dress up in their own little
10230320	10231320	fantasy world.
10231320	10237360	And, uh, right now I think that the Sims 4 has a deal going on with Gucci for like legit
10237360	10239360	Gucci items in the game.
10239360	10243080	Um, and you know, and I like it was going back for a previous story where he talked
10243080	10249080	about how video games, uh, are leading one of the biggest leading industries in the U.S.
10249080	10255040	Um, and in fact, in the first nine months of 2020, uh, sales of hardware content accessories
10255040	10261520	grew by 21% to 33.7 billion, um, over the same period of the previous year.
10261520	10270120	Um, so we're getting now, uh, people in Animal Crossing, for example, um, recreating certain,
10270120	10276100	uh, you know, uh, fashion items, um, you know, for the, the Able Sisters store, um, we've
10276100	10283060	had, uh, a Bathing Ape, um, have content out, uh, for, uh, hold on, let me get the game
10283060	10286500	it was in, for, uh, League of Legends for the character Yasuo.
10286500	10294360	Um, in, uh, sorry, in, uh, in League of Legends as well, there's been, uh, a Louis Vuitton
10294360	10302920	designer, uh, doing, uh, uh, skins for Senna, um, so it's actually just really interesting
10302920	10309800	that because, you know, having an actual fashion show or having, uh, these in-person
10309800	10315800	events are becoming harder and harder to do, um, that they are really looking to video
10315800	10316800	games.
10316800	10323200	Like there's, uh, another, uh, uh, a game called Goodbye Volcano High, uh, it's done,
10323200	10331080	uh, by, uh, actually their design team is, uh, predominantly, uh, LGBTQ+, um, and talks
10331080	10339060	about, uh, you know, fashion in this sort of alternate dinosaur populated world, um,
10339060	10343560	you know, of course, again, there's the Animal Crossing ones where people are, are recreating
10343560	10344560	these outfits.
10344560	10351000	Um, and, you know, I think it's actually pretty neat, you know, that they're doing this as
10351000	10358640	a way to, um, to drive that interest and to give back to the market and encouraging, uh,
10359360	10364040	just people, fans of the series, um, of their clothes to get out and do their own designs
10364040	10365040	as well.
10365040	10370000	Um, so yeah, uh, that Gucci pack, by the way, is called Gucci Off the Grid, uh, across
10370000	10374060	the Sims 4, it's a $40, uh, pack.
10374060	10378900	There's the various League of Legends ones, there's Love Nikki Dress Up Queen, uh, came
10378900	10385880	back in 2015, but there's apparently been, uh, like more content put out for it in the
10385880	10386880	fashion industry.
10386880	10392160	Cyberpunk 2077 is even talking about it, uh, with some of the, the character designs and
10392160	10393160	clothing put in it.
10393160	10397920	So I think we're actually starting to see actually not even just the fashion influencing
10397920	10400920	the games, but the games influencing the fashion as well.
10400920	10401920	Hmm.
10401920	10405280	I like that, how video games can influence fashion.
10405280	10409880	And you know, um, I think, uh, a game that, you know, we know is coming out very soon,
10409880	10414120	you know, Cyberpunk is kind of looking, I think fashion is gonna play kind of a role
10414120	10418200	in that as well, especially with all of the character customization options that are in
10418200	10419200	that.
10419200	10421480	And I think we've seen some of the crazy screenshots this week about that game.
10421480	10425440	Uh, I think there's going to be, I think that game is going to get used as an outlet a lot
10425440	10430360	for, um, fashion and what people want to represent themselves in a virtual setting.
10430360	10431880	So it'd be very interesting for sure.
10431880	10432880	For sure.
10432880	10433880	Yeah.
10433880	10434880	All right.
10434880	10435880	Uh, Loki.
10435880	10436880	All right.
10436880	10443400	So Microsoft has purchased the online tournament platform, smash.gg, uh, they made the announcement
10443400	10445360	via Twitter.
10445360	10450680	And basically what's supposed to happen now is that it's just going to be running, uh,
10450680	10452600	kind of as business as usual.
10452600	10458280	They're saying they're going to be, uh, utilizing the additional resources from Microsoft to
10458280	10465240	strengthen the platform and make kind of the destination site for, uh, e-sports, uh, tournaments.
10465240	10469440	But I'm curious to see what additional things they're going to do with this site.
10469440	10475400	Um, so kind of early, they didn't save for the, it looks like it's going to, it was purchased
10475400	10476880	for an undisclosed amount.
10476880	10481760	So they don't know how much the site was purchased for, but I'm kind of curious to see what their
10481760	10487360	strategy is behind this with, um, you know, this acquisition they've been doing a lot
10487360	10489960	of acquisitions.
10489960	10493800	I w I wanted to use the story as a segue and I'm not going to have enough time to get into
10493800	10496480	it, but I wanted to talk about, um, some of the things that are going on with the Nintendo
10496520	10497520	tournament side of things.
10497520	10501520	And I kind of made a tongue in cheek reference at the beginning of the show about how, um, you
10501520	10505240	know, Nintendo ended up canceling that Splatoon tournament because everybody was using the tags
10505240	10506720	with free melee and stuff.
10506720	10508480	Uh, if I understand correctly, they did that.
10508480	10510400	They ended up doing the tournament on their own.
10510400	10513160	The organizers just did it without Nintendo support.
10513160	10516920	Uh, and it probably ended up having more viewers as a result of all the free publicity of Nintendo
10516920	10517880	pulling out.
10517880	10521400	So, um, that, that at least that's how I interpreted it.
10521400	10522360	That's for sure.
10522360	10526520	So, uh, SSJ 100, Matt says there's some breaking news with Nintendo going on right now.
10526520	10527720	Oh, oh fuck.
10527720	10532280	Now what it's another day in 2020.
10532280	10539080	Well, it was someone was, they were selling, um, joy cons that were customized with etiquette
10539080	10541880	stuff on it and they put a stop to it.
10541880	10545880	Nintendo told them to see selling and not too surprised about that.
10545880	10548280	I mean, that's, they're protecting their IP.
10548280	10552280	I would say they have a right to do that stuff, but the tournament scene really, I
10552280	10555320	think, and what's interesting with Microsoft getting involved with this because the tournament
10555320	10561480	scene starting to revolt basically against Nintendo is very fascinating to me.
10561480	10565080	Um, and I'm really curious to see where this ends up considering that they wanted to be
10565080	10569240	e-sports with all the like, um, platoon two and stuff.
10569240	10570760	That's how they kind of positioned that.
10570760	10573800	And now they're kind, I don't know.
10573800	10574600	It's just so bad.
10574600	10577720	It's complicated because again, like, and I talked about this on the show where we talked
10577720	10581000	about the tournament, you know, getting canceled about the melee, you know, kind of having
10581000	10581800	to use an emulator to play.
10581880	10586120	It's like, I kind of get why Nintendo had to do it, but, um, I don't know.
10586120	10590120	Sometimes it's in the way you, you deliver the message and maybe using the lawyers and
10590120	10591880	cease and desist wasn't the best thing.
10591880	10592840	Who knew?
10592840	10597400	Um, Bobby Blackwolf pointing out, it's that term joy con that's an issue.
10597400	10601080	Uh, if they hadn't called them joy cons, they probably wouldn't have gotten cease and desisted
10601080	10607640	because they have just said, Hey, you know, this is a, you know, a protected term, you
10607640	10610200	know, please remove that from your description.
10610200	10613720	And then we're, we're cool instead of like, take it down.
10613720	10615000	I mean, like, I don't know.
10615000	10616280	It just seems ridiculous.
10616280	10620040	Speaking of Nintendo, Bobby wanted me to bring up, um, even though he brought it up on his
10620040	10623960	show and you guys should be listening to both, but Bobby did bring up the whole, uh, that
10623960	10626120	thing in the Nintendo firmware that's hidden.
10626120	10630920	There's some Google analytics tracking data that is turned on by default.
10630920	10634840	And I don't think any of us like these opt in by default sorts of things.
10634840	10638680	So if you aren't already aware, you may want to go into your Nintendo system, into the
10638680	10639080	firmware.
10639080	10640200	It's kind of buried in there.
10640200	10643320	Bobby just put a link in chat, but if you want more information, it's on a lot of the
10643320	10644360	Nintendo blogs.
10644360	10648840	For example, Nintendo life wrote an article about it a couple of days ago, uh, that the
10648840	10653640	Google analytics data collecting is on on the switch firmware in by default, you can
10653640	10654840	go in there and turn it off.
10654840	10659160	If you don't want Google tracking that kind of data, uh, probably if you play a lot of
10659160	10663080	legend of Zelda, then Google's going to know to start selling you, uh, or to start showing
10663080	10665320	you like Zelda shirts and things of that nature.
10665320	10666920	That's probably what they're doing with it.
10666920	10669160	So, um, something to keep in mind.
10670360	10676200	Yeah, but I mean, yeah, I guess, I don't know it being that your Google account's not
10676200	10678280	necessarily tied to that console.
10678280	10678760	I get it.
10678760	10684440	They could probably look at your wifi or something like that, but yeah, it's not really tied
10684440	10685480	to your Google account.
10685480	10687640	So like I would think maybe they're just collecting.
10687640	10691800	Yeah, but if you've ever logged into the website, it might be able to drive that, get that
10691800	10692440	bridge together.
10692440	10692920	Yeah.
10693160	10696760	And a lot of people connect through Facebook and Twitter to get friend requests.
10697400	10699160	So that is built in there.
10699160	10699480	Yeah.
10699480	10700920	So there's ways.
10700920	10701320	All right.
10702040	10705560	Anyway, one more story here, and I may mispronounce the name of this place.
10705560	10710120	So Jamie, you may have to, uh, throw me a life vest here, but, um, this is a sad story
10710120	10714120	about an arcade in Tokyo that is closing pretty much permanently.
10714120	10719000	And it's, uh, because of the pandemic, um, Ikebukuro, I think is the name of it.
10719000	10720360	I say that right?
10720360	10720860	Yes.
10721480	10722040	Okay.
10722040	10728360	They're closing, uh, permanently and, uh, you know, sad, but, um, it's, uh, yeah.
10728360	10729080	So I'm sorry.
10729720	10730280	Hello.
10730280	10731480	That is the district.
10733080	10735560	Yeah, I was like, I didn't think that was the name of.
10736600	10737960	The landmark there.
10737960	10738920	I misstated it.
10738920	10739480	Sorry guys.
10739480	10744360	The landmark silk hat is the arcade, uh, in that district.
10744360	10745720	And that is what is closing.
10745720	10746360	Sorry.
10746360	10747880	A faux pas on my part there.
10747880	10749480	Um, and so that is closing.
10749560	10753240	The reason why I want to bring this up, usually, you know, we've heard of a lot of things closing,
10753240	10757560	but what makes this relevant is that this was the arcade where dance dance revolution
10757560	10759160	was play tested many years ago.
10759880	10763560	So it's kind of sad to see that go away.
10763560	10765720	Um, but they are going to be closing their doors.
10765720	10770600	Uh, they are at the end of sunshine 60 Dori and, uh, going to be closing.
10770600	10774680	So that's silk hat again is the name of the arcade and it's been referenced in some, uh,
10774680	10775960	anime and things like that.
10775960	10777320	So, all right.
10778520	10779080	All right.
10779080	10784280	Um, let's get to the listener round table via our chat room and the mail bag.
10784280	10787240	And I know we have two emails at least to get through tonight.
10787240	10787960	Were you able to get those up?
10787960	10789000	Dark soccer or did you need my help?
10789000	10790680	Yeah, I was, I was.
10790680	10791320	Let's get to it.
10792440	10792920	Okay.
10792920	10797240	So, um, first email is, uh, from Robert M.
10797240	10799240	I'm sure you've gotten this correction quite a bit, but yes.
10799240	10803080	Donkey Kong three is indeed part of the NES online collection.
10803080	10807560	Also, I don't know if everyone being, if it's everyone being home during the holidays or
10807560	10811960	if it's my internet connection, does anyone else had issues connecting to the switch e-shop
10811960	10813480	over the past few past few weeks?
10813480	10814920	That comes from Robert M.
10814920	10816600	And my answer to that is no.
10816600	10820200	Um, so you may have missed the dark soccer, but I did donkey Kong three as the classic
10820200	10821000	game last week.
10821000	10824920	And, uh, I, I misspoke and I said, it's not on the NES collection.
10824920	10826760	Cause then to end it actually is.
10826760	10830440	So let's just point out all of Rob's fuck ups on the night.
10830440	10832680	He didn't contribute anything to the big reveal.
10835160	10836040	Okay.
10836040	10838040	Well, um, thank you for the correction.
10839080	10842520	The next one is actually a pretty, uh, a pretty big one.
10842520	10845720	Um, and it comes from, uh, uh, orange.
10845720	10846200	Right.
10846200	10847800	Um, says, hello, OLR.
10847800	10848120	Hello.
10848120	10851560	I don't really have a question, but I was bored and decided to make a remix of orange
10851560	10853160	Jones radio's intro song.
10853160	10854520	And I might as well share it with you.
10854520	10858440	My transcribing is probably not a hundred percent accurate and it was really good.
10859160	10861480	I'm going to be able to, I think I can play a clip.
10861480	10863080	I'm, I'm doing this live on air.
10863080	10865320	It might be really loud.
10865320	10870280	So please brace yourself because I don't see a volume slider on this, uh, thing.
10870280	10871560	So please brace yourself.
10871560	10873160	This may come through loud.
10873160	10873400	Okay.
10873400	10874440	But it's, it's awesome.
10874440	10875640	I'm going to play a little bit of it here.
10879160	10880760	I actually don't know if it's coming through at all.
10882760	10883560	I don't hear anything.
10883560	10884840	Not darn it.
10886520	10887080	Sorry guys.
10887080	10887800	I thought I had it.
10888600	10892680	Uh, let me try, um, some light.
10892680	10898200	I think I'm going to have to use this old snag here and this, oh, this looks terrible,
10898200	10900760	but let me see if, let me see if it fixes the audio side of things.
10905960	10907720	I actually don't know that.
10907720	10908220	No.
10909880	10915800	Well, unfortunately I'm not able to play it, uh, on the show right now.
10915800	10917240	Um, damn it.
10917240	10920840	I thought that would work cause I used to have stuff come through the web.
10920840	10923480	Let me try one other quick thing here.
10923480	10923720	Sorry.
10923720	10924920	I know that looks terrible.
10924920	10931640	The, uh, visual there, but I want to try doing to make sure it's coming through.
10933720	10936280	I'm just looking on my settings here to see.
10937800	10941400	Yeah, I thought I could get Safari to come through.
10941400	10948600	Maybe if I'm going to add it real quick as a source and see what I can do.
10948600	10953480	Um, yeah, yeah.
10953480	10954200	Live radio.
10955160	10958200	Um, I'm sorry.
10958200	10958520	Orange.
10958520	10959080	Right.
10959080	10961400	You deserve a better debut here.
10963400	10964360	Shucks.
10964360	10968520	Well, why don't we, can we at least post the link in our chat room and then we'll post
10968520	10969000	it.
10969000	10972440	I'm going to post the link to the sound cloud on Twitter if orange right is okay with it,
10972440	10975240	but it is a sweet remix of the opening theme.
10975800	10979800	When I first heard it, I was like, OMG, this is, this is great.
10980600	10985000	And I sent it off to a dark Sakura and a Loki and, and, and.
10986360	10986920	Orange, right.
10986920	10991480	We may want to talk to you about actually using it somewhere on the show, um, on a regular
10991480	10992040	basis.
10992040	10995800	Um, obviously we're going to keep the intro that we have that dark soccer made for us,
10995800	10998200	but we can think of some other places where this would fit in.
10998200	10998520	Great.
10998520	11001480	Um, I think you did an outstanding job and thank you so much.
11001560	11006600	And it's just like, it's like, this was news enough for me tonight between this and knowing
11006600	11008680	that pixel poops was at least going to steam.
11008680	11011160	I like, Oh, those are going to be some cool announcements tonight.
11011160	11014520	And then everything else, uh, was, was just icing on the, on the cake.
11014520	11016120	So, um, great job orange.
11016120	11016360	Right.
11016360	11018280	And thank you so much for that.
11018280	11019720	So yeah, it sounds great.
11020600	11023640	So, uh, and dark soccer that's, that's you.
11023640	11030600	So, so dark soccer, not only did you get your idea released on four different platforms
11030600	11037880	now between, between the Vita, uh, and all of that, but now your, your theme song has
11037880	11038840	been remixed.
11040200	11041400	And what do you think about that?
11042600	11045480	I can't even, I can't odd.
11045480	11047240	I can't, but thank you.
11047800	11048360	It's great.
11048360	11052120	I mean, I worked really hard on it, so thank you.
11052120	11052620	Yeah.
11053320	11054120	All right.
11054120	11058280	Um, let's get to some, uh, final, that was it for the emails tonight, right?
11059080	11059640	Yeah.
11059640	11060760	Participate.
11060760	11061260	Oh, go ahead.
11062040	11065160	I was going to say that I have a last minute story right now.
11065160	11065400	Sure.
11065400	11069160	Let me just quickly say, if anybody wants to email us in a future week, participate
11069160	11072040	at orange launch radio.com is the place to do it.
11072040	11073800	So, um, dark soccer, that being said.
11075480	11079880	So basically someone now has it to where you can run doom on a pregnancy test.
11080920	11082680	Wait, didn't that come up on a prior show?
11082680	11083720	That was a while ago.
11083720	11084440	I did it.
11084440	11084840	Yeah.
11084840	11086440	Cause I thought it was a more recent one.
11087960	11088200	Okay.
11088200	11089240	I might be wrong on it.
11090200	11092040	Or they got it running on a new one.
11092040	11094760	It might, it might be the same one that it was.
11094760	11096280	It had an updated date on it.
11096280	11097480	So nevermind.
11097480	11098440	No worries.
11098440	11103960	Cause I was putting that in, uh, in, uh, uh, you know, playing on a toaster,
11105080	11106200	you know, thing.
11106200	11109080	So I've got a last minute news if you want.
11109080	11109240	Yeah.
11109240	11109740	Please.
11110440	11116520	So it's when galaxies is file a counterclaim against Billy Mitchell over the, uh, his lawsuit,
11116520	11117160	I would believe.
11117160	11123400	So, um, it says both Billy Mitchell and Walter day knew that these score performances were fake,
11123400	11128520	but it still included the scores on twin galaxies score database because of their need for
11128520	11134920	self-aggrandization, their adverse and their desire to create perceived value for the database.
11134920	11140040	So they could one day sell twin galaxies and a twin galaxy score database and take
11140040	11141240	the money for themselves.
11142040	11144520	Um, yeah.
11144520	11149880	So apparently the there's a court hearing set to happen on December 11th.
11149880	11152600	So I guess we'll hear more about this maybe next week.
11153720	11155160	No, I don't want to hear about it.
11155160	11159000	This drama is 40 years old.
11161080	11166200	This drama is 40 years old give or take.
11166200	11172840	Like I, I can't believe that we still have like three hour YouTube and maybe this is
11172840	11175000	a cell phone because of the length of our show.
11175000	11180920	I can't believe they have like three hour YouTubes dedicated to discussing the 99 reasons
11180920	11182760	why Billy Mitchell sucks.
11182760	11189480	Uh, reason number 41 will shock you, you know, in these times, I just like, don't we have
11189480	11193880	other things to do than worry about twin galaxies drama from the past?
11194680	11196280	Like, don't we have other things now?
11196840	11197560	Like, it's just,
11200840	11201880	anyway, sorry, Loki.
11201880	11203000	It's not a dig at you.
11203000	11208520	I realize this is what's going around in gaming culture, but I'm just like, y'all stop.
11211800	11212300	All right.
11213800	11214280	That it?
11214280	11214840	That's it.
11214840	11215320	All right.
11215320	11215800	That's it.
11215800	11216920	I think it's time we wrap up the show.
11216920	11218360	We're over three hours at this point.
11218360	11220360	And like Dar Sakura said, we got to work tomorrow.
11220360	11223160	Um, but, um, y'all made tonight wonderful.
11223160	11223880	Uh, thank you.
11223880	11224520	Orange, right.
11224520	11224920	Thank you.
11224920	11225720	Y Y R.

11239480	11244280	Uh, tonight, this is just a lot of big smiles tonight all over the board.
11244280	11249560	Just kind of like watching, like what has come of, uh, of the culture of this show,
11249560	11254280	even if it's a giant turd, um, that's actually a compliment.
11254280	11258280	Um, it's, it's just great feelings.
11258280	11261080	So, um, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio,
11261080	11263160	please tell a friend or two about the show.
11263160	11266360	Uh, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
11266360	11270920	But if the voices aren't there to put out on air, uh, we have to spread the word of
11270920	11272200	Pixel Poops at the end of the day.
11272200	11273720	That's really what it's all about.
11273720	11277720	Um, and, um, yeah, that's, that's, that's what I got.
11277720	11280040	I don't even remember the rest of what I'm supposed to say at the end of the show.
11280040	11281400	Cause it's just been that kind of night.
11281400	11283720	Five star review wherever you found this podcast.
11283960	11285080	Auto hosting on Twitch.
11285080	11287400	Don't forget the VOG Network Docs.com shop.
11287400	11288920	Uh, I think those are all the highlights.
11288920	11293160	So let's get around to everybody's final thoughts tonight.
11293160	11297560	Uh, Loki, you can start cause you've already, uh, hijacked this show once tonight.
11298360	11302680	Um, I guess I'll just keep you guys updated on, uh, my progress with the game now.
11302680	11305560	So we can now I can openly talk about it.
11305560	11308840	I can show you pictures and stuff of what I'm working on.
11308840	11310200	You can give us the straight shit.
11311000	11311880	Yes, exactly.
11311880	11312280	All right.
11313000	11321640	Um, my final thought tonight is, um, I don't, I just, just, I I'm, I'm feeling great about,
11321640	11326360	uh, just all of you that participate with the show and really interact with it and have
11326360	11330280	made this show a part of all of our lives over the past 18 years.
11330280	11331960	I'm just, I'm, I'm just thrilled.
11331960	11334920	Um, and thank you YYR for that.
11335640	11338440	Pleasant little surprise you dropped on us tonight.
11338440	11339880	Uh, I love it.
11339880	11341960	So, and of course, Loki, but he already knows that.
11342440	11344440	Uh, Jamie, last but not least.
11345640	11347480	Um, shit.
11350360	11350860	Yeah.
11352840	11354520	And that's really all that needs to be said.
11354520	11356600	We hope you have an amazing week, everybody.
