0	13500	This week, the one-two punch of stay-at-home orders a new console launches means the GameStop
13500	16480	might finally turn a profit for the first quarter in multiple years.
16480	19520	It's a shame their forward-looking statements don't acknowledge how short-lived this will
19520	20520	be.
20520	22920	Digital's only getting stronger, especially with new consoles launching with the Diskless
22920	23920	edition.
23920	26800	Customers may buy the console from GameStop, but what happens for the next five or more
26800	27800	years?
27800	31280	With one company continuing its low decline in obsolescence, it's time for your hosts,
31280	34560	Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to give their opinions on this and the rest of the
34560	37920	week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
37920	45360	Hello, my friends out there on this internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
45360	47560	where every gamer has a voice.
47560	54920	It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again tonight with episode number 847 for this December
54920	62200	the 13th of 2020, which kind of marks our two-year anniversary of sorts on Twitch.
62200	65400	Now, granted, this show's been around way too long.
65400	69800	We started in June of 2002, so we've been around about 18 and a half years, if you can
69800	70800	believe it.
70800	75840	We were doing shoutcasts before, but this is the two-year anniversary of Twitch because
75840	81280	we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at VOG Network,
81280	86200	twitch.tv slash VOG Network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
86200	90080	I am Rob Roberts here in studio with you guys joining me.
90080	93240	As always, I'm going to start with tech master Loki tonight.
93240	94240	Hi, Loki.
94240	95240	How are you?
95240	96240	Hello.
96240	97240	Hi.
97240	98240	I'm good.
98240	99240	Good.
99240	100860	So a big shock reveal last night.
100860	105560	So I'm going to spoiler the last episode if you haven't heard yet, but Loki's game was
105560	106560	finally revealed.
106560	108560	Oh, you mean last week?
108560	109560	Yeah.
109560	110560	Actually, just last week, man.
110560	111560	Time is flying.
111560	112560	Time is flying.
112560	113560	Yeah, it was just last week.
113560	117640	Well, we had that extra show, kind of, because we did the Game Awards thing here at VOG on
117640	118640	Thursday night.
118640	123220	But anyway, yeah, it was last week when you kind of shocked us.
123220	129120	You and Aaron shocked us with the reveal that the game you have been talking about for months
129120	133920	and months on the show that you've been working on is actually a version of Pixel Poops.
133920	139740	It's Pixel Poops number two, appropriate, for the NES, or Nintendo Entertainment System.
139740	143100	So great job on that twist reveal.
143100	144860	That was great.
144860	146340	And kudos.
146340	152060	Bobby was the first guest in chat that potentially one reason you were being a little clammed
152060	154960	up about it was that it was kind of someone else's sort of thing.
154960	160460	He didn't guess exactly how it went, but close to coordinate.
160460	165100	We did discuss that we're going to do some sort of direct thing, and it didn't push back,
165100	167540	but we had to coordinate stuff.
167540	168540	So that's why.
169340	174140	Yeah, yeah, no, but you guys did a great job on that direct and really shocked us and the
174140	175980	folks in chat.
175980	180160	So now is the first week where I can officially ask you, how is development on Pixel Poops
180160	181160	number two going?
181160	183460	I haven't done a whole lot this week.
183460	185260	It's mainly just been research.
185260	191340	I've been trying to figure out how to do animated tiles because it's a lot of trickery involving
191340	195980	switching memory banks and stuff on the fly in order to be, I have to reset up all my
196220	199500	graphics if I want to do that or just rearrange my tiles.
199500	202020	So that's what I've been researching this week for part of the week.
202020	206220	And then Cyberpunk came out and nothing got done after that.
206220	209840	So I'll probably go back to it again.
209840	211780	It's mainly just been research this week.
211780	217120	I've been going through the code that's in there for Nest Maker and their libraries that
217120	223280	they have for doing care, the C.H.R. file loads to load the graphic data and just seeing
223280	225520	how they refresh it and stuff.
226520	228080	I know it's possible to do that.
228080	231880	I just have to figure out how to do that and how I need to store my data in there.
232240	237940	It's real complicated when you do Nest stuff, but I kind of give myself to like today to
237940	238640	figure it out.
238640	241720	And if I don't, I'm just going to move forward with it, but I have done other things.
241720	248280	I've got like, so now I also have logic for the joggers to when they hit a solid wall,
248280	249120	they will turn.
249320	254280	So that's going to change some of the level design as well so that it can get a little
254280	256840	bit more complicated with them moving in random directions.
256840	257680	Fancy.
257880	263800	So were you surprised at the amount of people that, you know, or do you even regret saying
263800	266640	that you were thinking about doing some actual cartridge production?
266840	270920	Because obviously you got a pretty warm response in our chat and then, you know, on
270920	274080	your Facebook post, because you made a Facebook post after the show kind of telling
274080	275280	all your friends what was going on.
275480	276920	You got a lot of response there, too.
276920	283520	So the limited run Loki Productions basement printing press is going to be running
283520	285000	over time whenever you get this thing done.
285640	290600	Well, I, you know, to do, yeah, definitely, um, one of the things I need to do is I need
290600	297960	to get an actual, uh, any acid, uh, test on, so I need to get that just to test all the
297960	299880	carts after I burn them.
299920	307320	And then, um, I need to figure out label printing, which has actually been, cause I
307320	310400	have, um, I'm in their forum as well.
310400	313760	They have like a Facebook group and then they also have like their own forums.
314160	317720	So there's people actually discussing label printing as well.
317720	322000	I, I, a lot of them have been talking about just laminating, like any jet printed
322000	324280	thing, but I'd rather just get it done.
324360	329400	Uh, but I have to see how they're doing it and figure out the best way to do that.
329680	330040	All right.
330040	333640	Well, we pretty much it, we look for, we look forward to more updates on your
333640	336960	project as it, um, you know, as it shits out.
336960	341320	Um, yeah, yeah, there would have been more this week if cyberpunk didn't
341320	342480	come out, but then it did.
342680	345320	So, you know, this is why you didn't commit to a release date.
345320	347480	So people need to just be patient this week.
347520	350880	I I'll probably go back to it again, but like, I wanted to at least get a few days
350880	351880	of that in, yeah.
352360	352720	All right.
352760	355200	Uh, also say hello, of course, joining us every week.
355280	357680	Uh, say hello to dark Sakura or Jamie summers.
359600	360840	I had to unmute myself.
361360	361760	Hi.
361760	362360	How are you?
363400	364880	I am tired.
365360	366360	Yeah, I hear ya.
366600	367440	Uh, well, happy.
367840	369480	I was just to say happy Hanukkah to you.
369720	373480	Um, cause I know it's the fourth night and I gotta say, you know, with the whole
373480	377640	pandemic and everything this year in 2020, just generally being a big ball of suck.
377920	380760	I must say I am missing the OLR tradition.
380960	385480	It's the one night where Jamie willingly gets in the kitchen and bakes
385480	388120	latkes here for us on the show.
388120	389360	And I missed that this year.
390000	392080	I fried up some good latkes for us.
392120	393840	Uh, last year I remember.
394320	395640	Made a lot of latkes.
396840	397280	You did.
397280	400800	So, so I was going to say, if you're going to be a little shit, 10 years ago in an
400800	404840	iTunes review and say, Jamie better be in the kitchen, it better be during Hanukkah.
404840	407640	Cause that's the only time that comment is excusable here on this program.
408120	409760	I have cooked other things though.
410040	410880	You know, true.
410880	415240	You have in, in, in the history of the show and, and Loki has too.
415240	417400	I remember the deep fryer bonanza.
417400	418240	We had one episode.
418640	422200	The old deep fried rice balls with cornflake coating.
422320	425680	The old OLR you guys was wild.
425720	431160	Like, that's why I don't talk much about the pre podcast years of OLR, but we did
431160	434080	wild shit for like three hours a night.
434320	437280	And I remember there was that episode where we were deep frying things.
437480	441240	And I also remember the episode where we had the, um, and this, we didn't even have
441240	444960	a, well, I think we had the cam, but it was the camera that would update like once
444960	445920	every 30 seconds.
445920	446880	So you couldn't really see anything.
447480	450000	But that was the technology on the internet way back in the day.
450120	454160	But I remember the night we had the peep jousting live on air and we put the peeps
454160	457520	with the toothpicks and in the microwave, which I wouldn't recommend doing.
457520	458840	Cause it's disgusting.
458840	460160	Cause I hate marshmallows.
460200	461960	I know they do not like peeps.
462000	462720	It's a little funny.
463320	469560	The webcam that was, it was the eye toy run through a capture card.
469560	470160	That's right.
470160	471360	It was an eye toy.
471880	473880	It updated every like few seconds.
474040	476960	So, or it was like every 10, 15 seconds or whatever.
476960	478400	Cause you know, dial up and.
478840	479560	Or no, it wasn't dial up.
479560	482320	No, it wasn't dial up, but it was, uh, you know, there was certainly
482320	486000	nothing like Twitch or I don't even think YouTube had debuted just yet.
486000	488680	It was, it would, this would have been, this would have been when you
488680	491600	and I were roommates, low Loki, which was around, it wasn't the first year
491600	494840	of the show, but it wasn't long after it was about 2003, 2004 was probably when
494840	498040	those, yeah, it's like geo cities.
498640	505600	It was like, yeah, it was really rough, but it's, it's, it's funny
505600	506880	how we've come such a long way.
506880	507960	Anyway, Jamie, sorry.
509720	515680	Oh, we're talking about a lot cause in the chat, but, um, it's, uh, something
515680	521160	that I talk about on, on my own, uh, forums, but I don't really talk about
521160	526600	a whole lot on the show is a chronic fatigue syndrome and, um, it can
526600	528000	really wipe a person out.
528040	532360	And so I just wanted to reach out, basically just put a word out to
532360	536120	others who, who are, uh, are living with this, you are not alone.
536600	540480	Um, and it keeps us from playing copious amounts of DDR when we think
540480	541760	about bringing out the dance pads.
542840	549160	So, um, but, uh, I still have all my Bemani stuff up behind me and I, I'm
549160	551800	actually considering selling my title.
552680	553520	Oh, wow.
553960	555360	Wants to make me a good offer.
555640	559760	The beat mania stuff is going fucking nowhere because I want to figure out how
559760	565280	to, uh, if I can get that sub service that's going on for beat mania, I think
565280	571880	it would be cool, um, I kind of miss playing, um, I've lost like 80% of my
571880	577080	skill at it, you know, like when I, when we like for, uh, California extreme,
577080	582080	I just was pretty much playing, uh, uh, I beat mania three so that I could play
582080	585360	like my favorite songs and just really easy.
585400	587120	Um, but I don't know.
587120	592040	Um, I've been, uh, going hubby and I have been talking over stuff about what we
592120	596280	want to do about getting, um, like a music game room set back up in, in this
596280	601440	office, but then again, I want to do my crafting stuff and actually learn how
601440	606120	to use my sewing machine because, uh, I hand sewed, sewed all my shit in the
606120	609680	back and you know, in, in the old days, now I want to start using my machine
609680	615480	and, you know, get back into making my, uh, uh, costumes and stuff.
615920	618120	Um, but, uh, okay.
618120	620440	So I have to make a comment to the chat room right now, Rob.
621120	621400	Okay.
621440	621760	Please.
621840	627240	So everyone's talking about making latkes and latkes are fucking
627320	628360	easiest shit to make.
628400	628800	Okay.
629800	636480	You have recipes on the internet and they are really matzah meal, you know,
636480	640840	which is basically, you know, dried up, grumbled up matzah, um, you know,
640840	645400	and matzah is basically the, uh, the bulking fiber of the Jewish world.
646400	649680	Um, potatoes, shredded potatoes.
649760	652160	Make sure that you use a nice, good, firm potato.
652160	656680	If you want them to be, you know, have that hash brownie kind of quality egg.
657120	663200	It takes egg and salt and you can make latkes or you can go and buy a box of
663200	667480	the meneshevitz mix and follow the directions and mix that and have latkes.
667520	670640	I thought that the stuff you had, we did last year, just you followed
670640	671840	the recipe on the back of the box.
672520	672840	Yeah.
673200	676280	I didn't feel like shredding all those damn potatoes, although I I've
676280	679080	done it with blue potatoes before and they look really cool.
680440	680720	Yeah.
680840	687120	Um, but, uh, I'm planning on not tonight cause I'm so tired, but tomorrow
687120	691360	night, maybe after work, I'm planning on doing sweet potato latkes.
691840	694360	Oh, sweet potato.
694880	696760	I'm meh on them, but Alan loves them.
697280	701120	Well, tell him, tell Alan to go to the coaster section of the grocery store
701480	703600	and get the box sweet potato latkes.
703600	706120	Cause they're just about as good as doing the real thing.
707200	713280	Um, and, um, I've also decided that neither sour cream or
713280	714840	applesauce are superior.
714920	717720	Neither of them are, you're making me hungry.
717760	718200	All right.
718800	721320	You know, what is superior to either of those toppings?
721400	721760	Yes.
721800	723480	What onion jam.
724920	725360	All right.
725600	726560	Sweet onion jam.
726720	727160	All right.
727360	730120	Sweet is specifically sweet onion jam.
730600	730840	All right.
730880	732520	We can find the Delia onion jam.
732520	733200	You go for it.
733560	735480	We got to get into gaming talk.
735520	736640	Although these are, you know what?
736680	738920	I'm all about snacks while you're a gaming.
738920	742920	So, you know, Hey, uh, let's, uh, let's get into some video game news and what
742920	745440	happened, um, around the gaming world this week.
745520	745840	Yes.
746040	746640	One last thing.
746920	747280	All right.
747280	748840	Curry sauce over latkes.
749160	750040	Also delightful.
750360	751240	I wouldn't have thought of that.
751240	751840	That sounds good.
752320	753600	Curry sauce is good.
754080	754320	Okay.
754360	754840	One last thing.
754840	757560	I get this powdered Curry gravy stuff.
757600	762000	Um, it's British like a B store, I think is the brand, but I order it on some
762000	766800	online service or a touch of Britain down here has it, and that shit is the bomb on
766840	768680	any potato product and that's it.
769360	772400	You know, I'm sure this is already out there somewhere on YouTube, but you need
772400	774560	a nerd cooking show, a geek cooking show.
774560	781000	I'm sure that exists, but not nerdy mummies and all of those, but none with you.
781760	782440	Oh, that's right.
782920	785960	Tiara has a thing going on and her blog is live now.
785960	788480	So Tiara, I know you're not listening right now, but I am
788480	789600	plugging the crap out of you.
789640	792320	Everyone needs to look at their, uh, their blog.
792320	794160	It's, uh, there and bake again.
794720	797280	I'll, I'll find a link for it in the chat room, but they're also
797280	800480	on, uh, on, uh, the YouTubes and stuff.
800640	801680	So, all right.
802560	802880	All right.
803200	804200	Uh, well, let's get in.
804200	807560	Speaking of things to watch, a lot of folks this past Thursday, we're
807560	809880	watching the game awards for this year.
810120	814000	Um, knowing that, you know, previously in previous years, Jeff Keeley's big
814040	818000	event that he's, you know, tried to make the, uh, gaming version of the Oscars.
818000	821040	And he's certainly done a lot better job than, um, some of the early,
821280	824240	uh, forays into that, that were on spike television and so forth.
824480	829240	Um, but, uh, Jeff's really gotten a good balance there and, uh, he's
829240	834240	kind of become to be known for kind of the, the winter big announcement thing.
834240	837960	You know, we have E3 usually in the summer, obviously 2020 was weird this year.
838240	842200	Um, but, uh, the game awards has been known as kind of like the big winter
842200	846640	announcement, uh, event as long, uh, along with the numerous awards that they gave out.
847040	851240	Um, and, uh, this year, obviously the pandemic made that a little
851240	853240	weird, um, but they did the show.
853480	856320	Uh, we were co-streaming it here at VOG network.
856320	858280	So some of y'all were watching the show with us.
858520	861800	Uh, myself, Loki and Bobby Black Wolf were there streaming the event.
861800	863160	I know Dark Soccer had to work.
863400	865640	Um, but, uh, we, we had a good time with it.
865680	868320	Um, and, uh, got to react to some things together.
868480	872800	Y'all saw me almost have a heart attack when that PlayStation five game came up
872840	877560	that had the hallway trailer and I started flip flipping my shit.
877560	878800	Cause I thought it might be PT.
879560	880680	They got me good.
880880	881760	Those bastards.
881760	882360	They got me good.
882360	883480	What, what was that game?
883480	885800	It's a, it's a sci-fi and they've shown it before.
885800	889160	It was at the PS five reveal, the sci-fi game with the female
889160	890280	protagonist of blonde hair.
890800	893440	I don't remember.
893480	894720	Yeah, no, they got me.
894880	895960	They got me good gal.
896960	898200	This is returnal.
898480	899040	That sounds right.
899040	900360	Returnal that, that does sound right.
900360	903400	Yeah, that was the, so dark soccer, if you'd seen this, you would have flipped
903400	908640	out to the game, started out and it shows a hallway with a door and the narrator
908640	913240	talks about like a loop and how I'm going back to where I started again.
913440	918040	And that was my, my, like literal reaction was no, like they did not
918120	922680	like that this can't like that fan wank cannot be real like the Twitter.
923960	925480	Of course they did it on purpose.
925520	928920	That's why I'm calling a little bitches anyway.
928920	930280	So that was probably something fun.
930280	934120	You got to see me react to, um, but anyway, uh, so it was a big event,
934320	940000	nothing big this year, like the X-Box series X reveal, like we got last year,
940000	944280	but all in all before Loki is going to run down the news, but quickly, um,
944400	946840	Loki, what did you think of the show as a whole?
946840	947880	Like, were you a fan?
947880	950800	Were you like, where were you at with the show as a whole?
951080	951800	And then we'll run it down.
952240	952880	It was okay.
952880	958320	But there wasn't really any trailers as like, you know, super excited about,
958600	962120	like, I remember like previous years, we had like no man's sky.
962280	966080	We had, you know, some death stranding gameplay type stuff.
966400	968720	Um, you know, stuff like that.
968720	971520	They were just like, kind of like, wow, you know, that's amazing.
971840	976880	You know, I mean, I guess if I was a fan of certain series, maybe there would be
976880	980800	some trailers that would be kind of like, Ooh, you know, nothing really like
980920	981680	concrete.
981680	983160	I mean, there's some stuff that looks neat.
983160	986160	Some stuff that was just kind of, okay.
986200	987600	That's a thing now, I guess.
987640	991400	And, um, there's a few things that like some of the indie projects
991400	992360	that look really nice.
992440	992720	Yeah.
992840	996760	Um, but nothing like, Oh my God, this is like the next game.
996760	997960	I really am waiting for it.
997960	1000000	Like literally none of the games that they showed.
1001240	1003880	I'm like highly anticipated for, but it's fine.
1003920	1006520	There was a couple I was certainly interested in and we'll get to it when
1006520	1007880	you, when you run down here in a minute.
1007880	1011400	But, um, I will say as a whole, and I said this on the Thursday broadcast,
1011400	1013480	let's kind of repeat it for the folks who missed it.
1013760	1017960	I thought Jeff and company did the best job they could, um, considering the
1017960	1022200	state of this year, considering the fact that the industry is all kind of crazy
1022200	1025560	and, you know, things are getting delayed and pushback and, you know, a lot of
1025560	1028040	things that were going to come out this holiday are now 2021.
1028280	1032040	Um, I think they really did the best job they could in giving us
1032040	1033200	something to look forward to.
1033440	1037200	I think the only kind of disappointment was that one game
1037200	1038800	really ran away with everything.
1039160	1040840	And look, I, and this is not a knock.
1040880	1042360	This is not a knock on last of us.
1042360	1043000	Part two.
1043160	1045760	I realize it's a controversial game in some circles.
1045760	1047280	I ha I have not played it.
1047520	1049080	Therefore I have no opinion.
1049120	1053880	I, it just, you know, some of the thrill is gone a little bit when, and this is
1053880	1058440	even true about the Oscars and that when like one thing really dominates, it's
1058440	1063120	kind of like, Oh, this is really like, like no shit, it was going to win game.
1063800	1066480	If you were paying attention the whole night, like it would have been a real
1066480	1067920	shock if something else had won.
1068200	1070880	Um, which, which has happened at the Oscars once or twice.
1071160	1075000	Um, like, like that year that crash won best motion picture, right.
1075160	1077480	When Brokeback Mountain who won like everything else, right.
1077680	1082080	It happens once in a great while, but for the most part, the shocks like
1082080	1082960	that are really rare.
1082960	1087640	And once a game kind of starts to sweep or a movie or whatever, a Grammy thing,
1087920	1090280	uh, it becomes pretty obvious what's going to happen.
1090600	1095120	Um, so I did like though, you know, and I know there's been a lot of discourse
1095120	1100320	online about some of the, like the crunch time and does that mean last
1100320	1102280	of us two deserves best direction?
1102640	1104680	I, again, haven't played the game.
1104720	1105720	Don't have an opinion.
1106040	1109800	I can say that that conversation, at least we're having that conversation.
1110040	1113040	And I think we've been talking a long time about how the game industry needs
1113040	1117320	to unionize and, um, there needs to probably be a greater conversation in
1117320	1121320	that regard and maybe this kind of becomes a catalyst to continue that
1121320	1122040	conversation.
1122280	1126400	But one thing I will applaud the game awards for is that I did feel like,
1126440	1129880	even though the last of us two really swept the awards and made that part
1129880	1134080	of it not that exciting, I did still feel like there was equal time, so to
1134080	1137040	speak, to hear from other award winners.
1137280	1141920	Like we saw the last of us, uh, team two or three times, probably
1141920	1143800	the developers twice.
1143840	1147320	I think we saw a voice actress as well, and maybe one other person,
1147640	1149200	but we saw the guy twice.
1149360	1153720	Well, we saw the Among Us team twice and they were really pleasant to see
1153720	1157120	because they were just, they were just four kids that were so fucking happy,
1157240	1159640	you know, and that was a real delight to see.
1159880	1163600	And again, that leads to a conversation on should Among Us even have been
1163600	1166600	nominated for best mobile game when it came out in 2018?
1168400	1170400	That's not for me to answer.
1170440	1173320	Uh, it's, I guess it's up to the game awards and that feedback, but.
1173800	1178840	You know, I will say it was, their speech was goddamn pleasant, you know,
1178840	1181560	and I was happy for them and I didn't care when that game released.
1181560	1182080	You know what I mean?
1182360	1187400	So at least I felt like, even if there's this conversation about, uh, you
1187400	1191160	know, Oh, last of us part two was, was toxic in some ways to our industry
1191160	1196680	and so forth, um, I feel like there were lights shined on other things too,
1196880	1200200	where it didn't like ruin, like I'm not sitting here going, Oh, the whole
1200200	1201720	award show is tainted because of it.
1201880	1206480	Because I think it is really awesome that Jeff has an award category to
1206480	1211080	call out accessibility, which is something that last of us two really shined on.
1211080	1216200	And that, that award is hard to fucking argue with that last of us two really
1216200	1218640	went out of their way when it came to accessibility this year, although I
1218640	1222320	thought I was not aware that some of the other games nominated like that grounded
1222320	1226000	game, I didn't know they had a mode where if you're arachnophobic, you
1226000	1229160	turn the spiders into floating disks.
1229240	1231040	You basically remove the legs and the hair.
1231080	1231440	Yeah.
1231600	1233800	I thought I was like, Oh, that's kind of rad.
1233920	1234600	I didn't know that.
1234960	1235160	Yeah.
1235160	1236920	We kind of covered that on the show a while ago.
1236960	1239720	Um, but yeah, it was kind of, I thought it just removed them
1239720	1240800	from the game altogether.
1241040	1246800	I didn't realize it turned to like some, like, you know, uh, animation,
1246840	1251040	like a stand-in type thing, like a blob.
1251360	1251840	Yeah.
1251920	1253880	I don't kind of look funny.
1254040	1254320	Yeah.
1254640	1258560	Um, so some folks in chat, so Bobby in chat says I wanted a Hades to win more.
1258560	1261320	Um, you know, and I, I, I loved Hades.
1261360	1263160	It's, it's probably my game of the year.
1263160	1264520	Stay tuned to find out for sure.
1264800	1270480	Um, but, uh, I, I, on one hand, I kind of get it, you know, if you look at
1270480	1275240	Metacritic, um, not that I put a whole lot of stock in Metacritic, but what
1275240	1278640	was the number one reviewed game on Metacritic that originally released
1278640	1283200	this year, um, because persona five, uh, Royal edition is, is up there.
1283360	1288400	But that is, you know, it's a repackaging, which, you know, who knows if that would
1288440	1292040	have, it should have made it eligible or not, I don't know, but, uh, the next one
1292040	1293840	up there is the last of us part two.
1293880	1294960	So it's, it's not.
1295400	1300160	Surprising, you know, and, uh, we, we know it's done by a panel of
1300160	1303960	journalists that are very similar to the type of people you see on Metacritic.
1304160	1306600	So you can kind of read the tea leaves a little bit there.
1306600	1308960	The audience vote is only like 10% of it.
1309000	1312560	It's not enough to really sway it hard in one direction or another.
1312840	1315840	And of course, lots of people talking about animal crossing, you know, which
1316080	1320080	obviously I don't have to wait two weeks to know that that's dark soccer is game
1320080	1324640	of the year and plenty of other people's as well, just because of, you know, what
1324680	1329200	it brought our 2020 world, you know, and the, and all this stuff.
1329400	1329880	So.
1330280	1334480	I will say at least one kind of nice thing was that even while the last of
1334480	1338200	us to kind of swept the table, it did feel like everything else that was
1338200	1342200	nominated for game of the war game of the year won something like no one
1342200	1343360	really went home empty handed.
1343400	1347600	I don't think like, um, the final fantasy seven remake got best music, right?
1347800	1350880	Hades got best action game, which was actually really surprising.
1351120	1352880	Animal crossing got best family game.
1353160	1354960	Um, I'm missing one of them.
1355240	1359120	Um, I'm a ghost of Sushi mug won something.
1359480	1361640	I don't remember what it was, but they won something as well.
1361760	1364400	So sound design, I think.
1364440	1364800	Yeah.
1364840	1366840	So actually do maternal may have been screwed.
1366880	1368320	I don't think they won anything.
1368640	1370960	Um, but I, they won a lot of hearts.
1370960	1374240	Uh, literally they tore lots of hearts out of demons chests and
1374240	1375440	that's what you do in do maternal.
1375440	1375600	No.
1375640	1380840	Uh, but it did seem like there were like, there was a little bit of, uh, Oprah,
1380840	1383840	you know, you get an award and you get an award, so, you know, I don't know.
1383960	1384280	Anyway.
1384520	1384800	All right.
1384800	1386560	Let's, let's talk about some of the big announcements.
1386560	1386880	I'm sorry.
1386880	1389440	I went on a little tangent there, but it's, it's a lot of the things that
1389600	1390880	gamers are talking about this week.
1390880	1392880	So, but Loki, what were some of the big reveals?
1393680	1399760	Um, so we saw a gameplay trailer for back for blood, which is the new
1399920	1404160	Turok game, the folks behind left for dead, it's basically left for
1404160	1406400	dead without calling it left for dead.
1406640	1411560	So I was, I know when I saw it, I was like, did Val finally make a game
1411560	1415800	with three forgetting that the studio, I forgot that whole thing, even though
1415800	1417960	we talked about it on this show, but we talk about a lot on this show.
1417960	1421160	So, uh, that way it was, it was nice to see that night.
1421160	1422680	I know that game will have its fans for sure.
1423480	1430080	Yeah, there was the, um, dragon combat game, century age of ashes.
1430120	1430920	They look kind of cool.
1430960	1432120	A little bit Panzer drag.
1432120	1437000	I was getting a heavy Panzer dragoon vibe and I was like, Oh, I didn't
1437000	1439000	think it reminds me a lot of layer though.
1439000	1441880	I mean, layer is more like kind of like that, but we'll see.
1441880	1442320	I don't know.
1442440	1444160	It looked neat from the trailer.
1445000	1445480	Yeah.
1445880	1451160	Uh, there was the game season, which was that kind of, uh, foot.
1451440	1454400	It looked like almost like photographing nature or something
1454400	1455400	like that, that really style.
1455400	1455880	Oh yeah.
1455880	1457080	It was very stylized.
1457080	1457560	Very good looking.
1457560	1457800	Yeah.
1458000	1458320	Yeah.
1458320	1459200	So that was cool.
1459560	1465200	Um, there's a, that was at road 96, that game about hitchhiking.
1465200	1468040	It looks like, so that was interesting.
1468080	1470200	Um, a lot of road trip games this year.
1470440	1470920	Yes.
1470920	1475280	Uh, speaking of that, there was also open roads, which was a mother
1475280	1478480	daughter searching for the truth about their deceased grandmother.
1479000	1480680	Um, so that's kind of it.
1480720	1485200	Actually, it looks like, so I believe I need a Wiki expert is dark Tetsuya
1485200	1489960	standing by, didn't we have a dream game called grandma's got a gun or something
1489960	1492720	like that, that was like one of the older, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1492720	1498760	So that one was basically a four player, like shooter game that was starring.
1498840	1501400	I know, but golden girls, but okay.
1501400	1502040	Yes, that was it.
1502040	1502480	But okay.
1502600	1506240	But I still, still, when I saw this trailer, I was like, Oh, they're using
1506240	1508240	gangster granny as a plot device.
1508240	1510400	I'm in it and it's by the gone home people.
1510400	1515760	I'm into this, that look, I, you have my attention.
1515760	1517280	That was my reaction to that trailer.
1517280	1519840	You have my attention and some big, Oh, there was some big Hollywood
1519840	1520640	names in that, right?
1520640	1523120	Carrie Russell, I think was in that, uh, Felicity.
1523120	1523440	Yeah.
1523680	1527080	So it's interesting because, um, you know, there was certainly a big period
1527080	1531240	of time where Hollywood wasn't making anything because of everything going on.
1531400	1535960	So I'm sure you had a lot of celebrities that suddenly became, uh, available
1535960	1538280	for voice acting talent as well.
1538360	1541840	Not to detract from the many voice actors that we, we love in the gaming
1541840	1544360	industry, but, uh, there's tons of projects to go around.
1544360	1544880	That's for sure.
1544880	1549400	So it's interesting to see some, some big, um, uh, TV and film talent
1549400	1550520	coming into voice, some games.
1551200	1556760	And speaking of, uh, talent, uh, we had a, a trailer starring Vin diesel,
1556760	1559720	which I swear to God that that was going to be another Riddick game,
1559720	1561480	but it ended up being arc too.
1561960	1565160	And it's just totally, I was getting to her.
1565200	1567000	I was like, is it a horizon spinoff?
1567040	1569920	Like what, because that, that was the big vibe I was getting, but then
1569920	1573040	when they said it was arc, I was like, oh yeah, like I've played only a
1573040	1573840	little bit of arc.
1573880	1577200	I, I find that it doesn't hold your hand very well in the beginning of the game.
1577200	1578480	I had a hard time following it.
1578800	1582040	Um, but, uh, I have friends that are really into it.
1582040	1585880	So, um, and I know the game's doing very well, so it made sense.
1585880	1588360	Once I heard it was arc, I was like, oh, okay.
1588400	1592000	I guess it could be that, although none of this is gameplay.
1593120	1593400	No.
1594280	1594560	Yeah.
1595400	1599920	Um, and then they had, uh, another trailer for a cult, the Calisto
1599920	1604840	project, which is by the folks that did dead space and it looks very dead space.
1604840	1612320	So, um, violent, nasty, uh, then we've got, uh, a trailer that we had no idea
1612320	1614320	what it was until the very end.
1614360	1617600	And it was revealed to be perfect dark.
1617680	1618960	So they have, oh yeah.
1618960	1619520	Yeah.
1620080	1623120	By the initiative, you know, and that rumor has been out for some time.
1623160	1624880	So it was kind of nice to see that confirmed.
1625720	1626120	Yeah.
1626120	1627240	So that was interesting.
1627280	1631080	Um, predictably master chief coming to Fortnite, they made that announcement.
1631600	1635920	Um, and then kind of some of the other bigger stuff that they had,
1635960	1637680	uh, well, the evil dead game.
1637880	1640120	That's kind of cool, which I totally thought was a dead by
1640120	1642000	daylight expansion or something.
1642440	1643920	Yeah, I thought it was as well.
1643920	1646240	And it's like, oh, that's not a diss.
1646280	1649920	Uh, that's when Alan's favorite games and I know tons of people are into it, but,
1650160	1653040	uh, yeah, it looks like, it looks like they're kind of taken maybe that, well,
1653040	1655920	I shouldn't say taking, cause we don't know how the game plays yet, but that,
1655920	1658320	uh, aesthetic, I guess for an evil dead game.
1659000	1659320	Yep.
1659400	1664360	Um, they had another trailer for fist, which was, uh, it looks like an action
1664360	1670400	game, starring a robot with a robotic fist, they fights with, um, they have
1670400	1675840	the new expansion tees for, uh, the yellow scrolls on line, which is gates of
1675840	1681520	oblivion, and then we've also got, uh, they made, they talk about the season
1681520	1682800	three of fall guys.
1682800	1685960	So it's going to be winter theme comes out on the 15th.
1686000	1687680	So later this week, yeah, a couple of days.
1688600	1690840	And then of course we talked about returnal.
1690840	1696080	That was very much like the, uh, you know, it almost looked way PT, but it wasn't.
1696600	1700120	Um, and then of course, uh, some of the bigger stuff.
1700120	1703200	So of course we knew that they were going to announce a new smash character.
1703480	1707400	So Sephiroth was announced as the new smash character and
1707400	1709320	immediately stabbed Mario.
1710080	1716880	So that was so dark, but I love that the stat stabbing Mario, but it turned out
1716880	1720160	once the light kind of went the other way, you saw that the sword was going
1720160	1723680	through the suspenders kind of like hooking him on it was very, it was very
1723680	1727960	like, like Disney dark humor was, it was, it was good.
1728360	1730800	What do you think of Sephiroth as a character being added?
1730880	1732720	I didn't, that was not one.
1732720	1734960	I saw a lot of people predicting that kind of came out of left
1734960	1736240	field, but it works.
1736280	1736800	It works.
1737640	1738600	It's fine.
1738600	1741960	It could have, I don't know, they could have picked a different series.
1742160	1742600	I'm sorry.
1742600	1743400	I'm just so happy.
1743400	1744440	It wasn't a Fortnite, bro.
1744480	1745120	I'm sorry.
1745160	1746720	I'm sorry, but I'm not sorry.
1746760	1748760	I just, this is kind of one of those.
1748760	1751960	Like I just, I feel like it's gonna happen.
1752080	1754080	I don't want to see it happen, but yeah.
1755240	1756800	Uh, was it, they, they showed off.
1756800	1758520	Is it okay if I rolled my eyes the entire time?
1758880	1760040	What, the Sephiroth bit?
1760640	1761080	Yeah.
1761160	1765680	I mean, my favorite thing though, was the person who did comparison shots for scenes
1765680	1767720	from Advent Children and the games.
1768840	1770240	That actually was really cool.
1770240	1772200	I mean, they recreated a lot of it and then Dan and I went and
1772200	1773080	watched Advent Children.
1773360	1777480	They did, there was one thing they recreated a shot where like he was about
1777480	1782120	to kill Aerith, but, uh, they use Zelda or something in the shot instead.
1782120	1785240	And the trailer, it was pretty, pretty, pretty cool how they did that.
1785320	1787800	It's like, damn, he's thinning out the cast already.
1788080	1793360	Um, was it, they had the new, uh, airship level showed off for among us and they
1793360	1796080	kind of showed the new tasks and gameplay with that, so that was kind of cool.
1796560	1798280	Uh, that'll be coming next year.
1798360	1801200	Uh, Super Meat Boy Forever, completely forgot about that game.
1801240	1802080	Yeah.
1802440	1805640	I thought that was supposed to be out a long time ago, but it
1805640	1807080	might've been 2020.
1808320	1811920	Uh, apparently, uh, games pass is going to be getting all of the Yakuza.
1811960	1817000	So, uh, Yakuza remastered collection three, four and five, and then Yakuza
1817000	1819240	six is going to be coming as well.
1819280	1825080	That's all next year, January 28th for the first three and March 25th for number
1825080	1829880	six, because we're still waiting for some of the final fantasy games they
1829880	1835400	announced last year, just saying, uh, Evil West, which, um, looked like a
1835400	1839760	very familiar PlayStation two game that I don't remember what it was called.
1839920	1843440	Not dark centers, but, um, yeah, they're very similar looking games.
1843440	1846520	So it's kind of a Western horror game, steampunk Western horror.
1846520	1847880	So that, that looked kind of neat.
1848280	1852280	Um, they've got unreal tournament stuff coming into Warframe.
1852280	1854400	So some different weapons and stuff for that.
1854800	1859320	And finally, um, there was a course, some teases from Bioware.
1859320	1864920	So they showed off a teaser trailer for dark or a dragon age four.
1865320	1867120	Uh, so a cinematic for that.
1867480	1867960	All right.
1867960	1869440	Uh, with a solace,
1869600	1871920	uh, you know, we got to talk about that dark soccer.
1871920	1873480	You're the Bioware fangirl.
1873720	1874840	What'd you think of the trailer?
1876080	1876440	All right.
1876480	1878080	I mean, it's pretty much what I expected it to be.
1878080	1881280	It didn't seem like anything too super new.
1881280	1883080	I mean, from the other stuff that they showed us.
1883840	1888240	Um, I didn't really expect anything more than just a couple of teases and everyone
1888240	1891920	who beat dragon Asian acquisition knew that solace was the bad guy.
1891920	1896360	So, yeah, I wasn't really super impressed.
1896800	1899800	I was happy to see something, but I've still got a while to go.
1899960	1903960	I liked the art style a lot now, I guess maybe because I haven't really been
1903960	1906960	digging up on, I didn't know that that was the direction they were going with it.
1907160	1910560	But I really liked that kind of like neon medieval look.
1910600	1914280	It's, it's, it's for, it seems like a different direction for me, like than the
1914280	1918520	other games, the way that kind of looked, I was maybe it's just because of my love.
1918520	1921400	It has to do with the setting of the game.
1921400	1924880	Cause I think it's supposed to be sent, set into vendor, which is like the wizard
1925280	1925880	big thing.
1926440	1934480	So, um, so, um, yeah, I, I think that has more to do with where it's located, but I
1934480	1939960	really do like the stylistic choices, but it also does fit the, the area.
1940280	1940800	Okay.
1941440	1944000	So I, I look forward to when we can see some gameplay.
1945120	1945600	Yeah.
1946440	1951240	Um, and then last but not least, of course, uh, there was a teaser trailer
1951240	1956120	for a new Mass Effect game that's going to be, I guess, set after three.
1956320	1961520	And that was very surprising considering they only really confirmed that they were
1961520	1965200	working on a new Mass Effect beyond the remaster, but when they announced the
1965200	1967040	remaster really not that long ago.
1967400	1971680	Um, and you know, you saw me kind of reacting live to that trailer where I was
1971680	1972640	like, is that Liara?
1972680	1973400	Is that Liara?
1973440	1975400	And it turns out, yes, it was Liara.
1976360	1979880	And that's one of the characters, if you're not aware from the original trilogy.
1979880	1987520	So to me, that trailer seemed to be confirming that this new game is in the
1987880	1993760	same universe, literally, because not as well, there's so much to dive into here,
1993760	1999040	but it is some sort of continuation, I suppose, or perhaps, um, it could be
1999040	2004040	prequel could be interlude, but it exists in the shepherd timeline is my point that
2004040	2009080	it's somewhere it seems to be in there somewhere, although there's been a lot of
2009320	2011560	lot of people tearing that trailer apart.
2011720	2016560	Some people seem to think that Liara looks very aged and that it could be some
2016560	2021080	sort of Liara trying to meet up with the Andromeda storyline, because keep in mind
2021120	2025240	the Andromeda storyline is 600 years ahead of the ship because of the time it takes
2025240	2029440	to travel between, uh, the Milky Way and Andromeda.
2029640	2034040	But, you know, they, they may try to patch that up with, but time travel, but
2034040	2034720	science.
2034760	2035480	So we'll see.
2035480	2041080	And, um, Liara's race, the Asari, they live for like a thousand years, so she could
2041080	2042920	still be alive over six.
2042960	2043520	Yeah, over.
2043600	2046600	So she could still be alive is my point 600 years later.
2046760	2051480	So there is, so there's a lot of theorizing over that 30 seconds that we saw.
2051680	2055960	Um, so I don't, I don't want to go too far down that rabbit hole, but it certainly
2055960	2060880	was exciting to at least know that, okay, this is going to tie into the characters
2060880	2066640	in the first game, unlike Andromeda, which, you know, there's, there's things I like
2066640	2070080	about Andromeda, there's things I don't like about Andromeda, but it exists on its
2070080	2070400	own.
2070440	2074640	You know, it doesn't it like the shepherd and the callbacks to the original trilogy
2074640	2080360	are really just like cameos, but this is really something that shows, okay, y'all
2080360	2084080	wanted something in the trilogy, you know, so, and then of course it leads to the
2084080	2088040	controversy of, are they going to canonize one of the endings of three?
2088440	2092520	I don't think it's a big deal if they do, but other people are really, really
2092520	2095960	passionate on this topic and disagree that they shouldn't be canonizing one of the
2095960	2097960	endings, but we'll see, they might find a way around it.
2097960	2105520	Um, uh, Lyla36 in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network says, love
2105520	2107480	Mass Effect, hopefully it's good.
2107680	2109000	Uh, yeah, big same.
2109000	2113760	And my assumption is that, you know, part of the surprise about seeing that teaser
2113760	2118640	at the Game Awards was I was like, they still haven't given us a date for Dragon
2118640	2118840	Age.
2118840	2122120	Like this Mass Effect game is years out.
2122200	2128200	I'm talking, I would be shocked if this game is out any earlier than 2023.
2128480	2129240	I'm serious.
2129240	2130520	I think it's that far out.
2130520	2134160	It's gotta be, you know, think about how long Andromeda took and all the
2134160	2136000	announces we got over the years with that.
2136360	2139040	We may get a few more teases in that remaster.
2139040	2142280	I think that's what people want to know now is that like, if I go and I beat all
2142280	2145920	three games in that remaster, am I going to get like a Kingdom Hearts esque kind of
2145920	2148360	bonus scene that's going to tie into something new?
2148680	2150600	And I think a lot of people would lose their shit.
2150920	2154920	Um, but we'll see a lot to be determined.
2154960	2155760	That's for sure.
2156400	2163040	So, um, Phoenix 7726 in chat says, wait, Rob, why would they shoot an ending out
2163040	2163720	of a cannon?
2164080	2165440	I would hope you all know what I meant.
2165520	2169080	Um, but that means that obviously you make a big choice at the end of Mass Effect
2169080	2172080	three on how do you want this story to end?
2172360	2176600	And, uh, they may end up saying this is the definitive ending.
2176840	2182920	Now, I would kind of argue that Mass Effect two, you could beat Mass Effect
2182920	2188920	two and kill Shepard spoiler alert for a 10 year old game plus 10 plus, but you
2188920	2192480	could beat Mass Effect two and end up not having Shepard live.
2192880	2197480	And, uh, uh, in that ending, I believe Joker takes over the narration and some
2197480	2200160	of the, um, follow up and tying up the loose ends.
2200400	2206280	So in your, uh, Canon ending of Mass Effect two, Joker might've been the last
2206280	2211000	person standing, but that didn't stop them from saying, nah, but that's like,
2211000	2215640	it's, um, the endings of clue, but how about this?
2215680	2217560	That's, that's one way it could have happened.
2217600	2219880	Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
2220120	2224440	That's exactly how they should start Mass Effect three or sorry, Mass Effect, the
2224440	2227960	new one, they should start Mass Effect, the new one by recapping the three
2227960	2230080	endings, uh, clue the movie style.
2230360	2231160	Absolutely.
2232480	2232920	All right.
2233160	2233560	Anyway.
2233600	2236240	Um, anything else that they announced Loki that we missed?
2237400	2239240	No, that'd be, that's pretty much it.
2239280	2243880	Uh, there are some other advertisements, uh, Facebook did a lot of this, like kind
2243880	2248440	of trying to build Goodwill around, you know, diverse streamers and stuff, but
2248440	2251200	then like the kind of the reaction with all those, it's like, yeah, that's a
2251200	2251880	really good video.
2251960	2252760	Oh, Facebook.
2253560	2253720	Yeah.
2253720	2257840	So yeah, that's the only downside of that.
2257840	2262200	It's like, yeah, thanks that you pointed it out, but nah, not going on your
2262200	2262720	platform yet.
2262760	2266520	That was, that was, you know what, it's one of those things where it's like, I
2266520	2271160	will give a, I will give a singular clap to Facebook gaming.
2271160	2276040	I will get, I will give one clap to Facebook gaming because I thought that
2276040	2279400	was very nice that they spent their money on what they did with those ads.
2279440	2282120	Because, you know, when they started, I was like, oh, I love when the game
2282120	2283400	awards highlight stuff like this.
2283400	2284440	This is really cool.
2284440	2287720	And it's, it's great to see, you know, uh, all sorts of people that are really
2287720	2288920	enthusiastic about gaming.
2289120	2293440	And then it comes up with that Facebook gaming logo and you're like, I feel like
2293440	2295600	I just got just bait and switched.
2297040	2301320	Um, but I will give them the one clap, uh, polite applause for, for paying for
2301320	2301840	those spots.
2301840	2302800	Cause it was nice to see.
2303680	2305360	So, all right.
2305880	2311160	Um, otherwise those paid spots sure blend in with the awards a little too well.
2311160	2311680	Don't they?
2312960	2313400	Yes.
2313600	2316560	I liked how, uh, Devolver used theirs.
2316560	2319600	That was funny to do their own award show within the award show.
2319640	2320280	That was funny.
2320280	2320520	Yeah.
2320520	2321840	That was a very Devolver thing.
2321840	2322120	Yeah.
2322760	2323240	All right.
2323520	2326520	Let's talk about some other things we've done this week besides watching big award
2326520	2328760	shows and talking about our gaming weeks.
2328760	2329960	How was your gaming week?
2329960	2330960	And we'll start with dark Sakura.
2333800	2335360	It would help if I had muted myself.
2335400	2338440	Um, it was, it was animal crossing.
2338480	2341000	I mean, animal crossing and writing fan fiction.
2341640	2342040	Fun.
2342120	2343520	So, yeah.
2343520	2350600	Um, I, in two weeks I have penned 19 chapters of my fanfic.
2350640	2351160	Oh, wow.
2351760	2354280	I'm on my 20th, 18 of them have been posted.
2354600	2359880	So it's supernatural, but if anyone wants to read my writing, um, it is, I'm
2359880	2363680	actually doing this in part, um, to deal with, I guess kind of how I feel about
2363680	2368600	the series, but I'm also hashing out some ideas that are going to go into my novel.
2369560	2375200	So if anyone wants a, a sort of a influential sneak peek on that, let me
2375200	2376360	know, I will give you a link.
2377160	2377480	Cool.
2377760	2381080	But other than that, yeah, it's been lots of, uh, lots of animal crossing
2381160	2385720	and, uh, um, and, and a little bit of pinball, a little bit of pinball.
2385960	2386360	Oh, fun.
2387520	2390280	And I'm still considering getting a ring fit.
2390720	2392160	I'm thinking about it.
2392160	2396840	I just don't know if I want to dedicate to it when I've been focusing so much on
2396880	2399760	weight training instead of the cardio stuff.
2399760	2400720	So we'll see.
2401040	2404560	I need to come ding dong ditch you, um, the things so you can try it.
2404560	2407520	Although there is a part of me that really should pick it back up because
2407520	2410360	I haven't been getting great exercise throughout this whole thing.
2410360	2414920	But, um, you know, been trying to, well, yeah, yeah, I've been trying my best to
2414920	2417800	walking, although there was a few days this week where it didn't happen just due
2417800	2422640	to it was raining or, you know, too much going, like I had to work and then we
2422640	2424840	went right into the game awards from work.
2424880	2427320	And by the time that's over, it's like seven, eight o'clock at
2427320	2428560	night is too dark to go walk.
2428560	2431440	And that's the biggest bummer is that it gets dark too damn early now.
2431720	2432680	It really kind of.
2433480	2436640	Sucks on the walking front, but Oh, well, you ever considered
2436640	2437680	doing what Alan's doing?
2438840	2440600	Um, yes, I considered it.
2440600	2444800	And then I said, no, uh, when, when Jim, I said I wasn't going to do
2444800	2446000	it because of my back problems.
2446360	2450320	When gyms are safe again, I will absolutely cause my work has a nice
2450320	2451040	little deal with you.
2451040	2453320	I will absolutely be taking advantage of that.
2453320	2456160	So that, but that's just going to have to be a 2021 thing.
2456160	2459200	And as we all know, we, we got to wait for that vaccine to travel.
2459200	2464000	So my work has a gym, but I've been buying weight equipment to keep it home.
2464320	2467800	You know, I'm actually borrowing some pretty heavy, uh, free, uh, dumbbells
2468240	2470800	and I bought a kettlebell and RAR.
2471480	2471920	Nice.
2472600	2476080	I was being really good about the gym about, you know, it was last year, but
2476080	2479600	then everything just started happening where I changed jobs and like everything
2479600	2482040	happened at once, I kind of fell out of the habit and I needed to get back into it.
2482080	2482400	Anyway.
2482480	2482720	All right.
2483040	2484360	Get you some resistance bands.
2484400	2484640	Yeah.
2484680	2486640	Well, that's what ring fit basically is really.
2486640	2487760	So, all right.
2487760	2488920	Kind of anyway.
2488960	2490520	Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
2490840	2495120	I mean, well, obviously you kind of got into it earlier, but I want to know about
2495120	2497920	cyberpunk cause I'm, I'm pretty sure dark soccer didn't check it out and I didn't
2497920	2498400	check it out.
2498400	2499880	So I got to know your thoughts.
2500840	2506640	So, yeah, I played, uh, quite a bit of cyberpunk now, so, um, I like it.
2506640	2507560	I really enjoyed it.
2507560	2509200	It's a very immersive game.
2509240	2513880	Um, and I'm, yeah, I'm thoroughly enjoying it.
2513880	2517840	The storyline's really good and I'm just kind of working through that.
2517960	2522120	Been trying to do a lot of side quests, but it has like the, the problem that
2522120	2529000	like, um, Skyrim had where as you are, like you pick a side quest to do it and
2529000	2533080	you'll get another quest kind of in the middle and then it'll jump to that one.
2533080	2535920	It'll get, it kept changing my markers, which was kind of annoying.
2536400	2541280	Um, so Bobby wants to know what system you're doing cyberpunk on a PC.
2541440	2541680	Okay.
2541720	2544040	I'm not crazy enough getting a console yet.
2544400	2548040	Um, no, actually I do want to get it on the Xbox series X at some point, but that
2548040	2549080	doesn't come out until March.
2549360	2553160	And from what I hear the console version's a little bit rough, but yeah, I've been
2553160	2559200	playing on PC, uh, cause I've got a, uh, GTS or I have an RTX, uh, 2070 in my
2559200	2564440	laptop so I can run, um, you know, some of the Ray Tracy on there.
2564440	2569240	I think I've been playing a Ray Tracy medium, which is like the ultra, but you
2569240	2573360	know, kind of a little bit, uh, not super crazy in Ray tracing.
2573360	2580640	And then I dropped the screen resolution down from 4k to 1440 and I, I mean,
2580640	2582320	1440 or 1080, I can't remember.
2582680	2590720	And then also I've been using their, um, DLSS to, uh, up the quality and
2590720	2592080	get some more frames out of it.
2592080	2593920	But yeah, it's been running really smooth.
2594080	2600960	Um, there are bugs, there, there are, there are some weird bugs in the game.
2601000	2605360	Um, nothing really super game breaking so far.
2605360	2606280	I've had it crash.
2606280	2610640	I mean, a few times is the, is the whole penis clipping outside of the jeans thing.
2610640	2612440	Is that a bug or a feature?
2612960	2614200	That's, that's the hard question.
2614200	2616040	That's the hard question I'm asking here.
2616040	2618680	I know a lot of features are in the eye of the bug holder.
2619200	2623240	Maybe one where it, it, he's holding something.
2623560	2629720	I had, I, so I had, um, an issue where my character goes, so it's a,
2629720	2631480	it's a game about hacking, right?
2631480	2633400	So what am I going to do to the game?
2633600	2637840	Of course, I'm going to hack it to try and cheat because that's what I do.
2638200	2640760	Um, so Eddie Guerrero said you cheat to win.
2641240	2644800	So I've been messing around with like, you know, uh, cheat editors and
2644800	2647040	stuff like that to tweak it how I want.
2647160	2651000	But anyways, so I maxed out, um, some armor on some clothes I had.
2651040	2654440	Um, some armor on some clothes I had, like your initial starting clothes.
2654440	2655040	You can do that.
2655400	2661520	And what happened was is on a reload, like they would refuse to appear.
2661520	2666160	So like I put the pants and the shirt and stuff on and it would just be invisible.
2666640	2671120	Um, but it would turn my character into a Ken doll, basically, you know, it just
2671120	2673200	remove all the genitalia whatsoever.
2673560	2678320	Um, but then I ended up, I had to wear like a different pair of clothing.
2678320	2680480	It finally worked and I was able to level that one up.
2680480	2684080	And then I put a jacket on and everything kind of appeared again, but
2684080	2690320	I've had other bugs where, um, objects will just like, like my, uh, sidekick.
2690600	2694520	He was walking through a room and his guns just got stuck in the
2694520	2696760	middle of the air for some reason.
2696920	2698640	And so that was weird.
2698880	2701920	And then there's another one where he had a briefcase and he was holding it
2701920	2703520	and it also got stuck somewhere.
2703720	2704720	It just disappeared.
2704840	2706880	Um, I feel like, okay.
2706880	2710800	I feel like knowing you low key though, this kind of stuff is almost like a
2710800	2715120	feature because like, uh, you know, a lot of games are really buggy when they first
2715120	2718880	came out, like Bethesda games are legendary for this shit, which are three.
2718880	2722000	I seem to recall was pretty buggy when it came out in the beginning too.
2722240	2724160	Um, but you love this buggy stuff.
2724160	2727600	Like driver three was like, you know, a game you played a lot of.
2727840	2731440	Because of the stupid bugs that were in the game, you know?
2731440	2735360	So, so it's one of those, he's like, are the, are the, are the bugs really
2735600	2737200	detracting or are they a feature?
2738200	2739960	No, it's, it's not really bothering me at all.
2739960	2744440	There's like, um, if it starts like interfering to the quests and stuff, like
2744440	2748520	I can't do certain things, like there's some, the, like where they wanted me to
2748520	2750000	go somewhere and do something.
2750040	2753720	And it was kind of, I couldn't figure out what it was that they wanted me to do.
2753920	2754840	So that was kind of annoying.
2754840	2758520	Some of the way markers that they put in there are confusing as well, because it.
2759040	2762600	There was one where they wanted me to steal a van and drive it somewhere.
2762600	2767000	So I, I stole it and I drove through the marker, but what they really wanted me
2767000	2773160	to do was go past the marker into this, like, uh, warehouse type thing.
2773200	2776320	And then a new marker would appear, which didn't make any sense.
2776320	2778640	They should just have the final destination as the marker.
2779160	2782840	Because I tried to park on the marker instead and I'm like, okay, well,
2782840	2785320	I'm on this marker, I don't know what it wants me to do.
2785560	2786600	It's not disappearing.
2786600	2788000	It's not seeing them getting anywhere.
2788120	2791600	So I kind of figured I'm like, Oh, they probably want me to drive into this,
2791600	2794360	like, um, you know, fenced off area.
2794360	2795440	So, okay, I'll do that.
2795480	2800200	So I was sure I drove past it and then it finally let, you know, it put
2800200	2802960	the next marker up and stuff, but it was just a little weird.
2803000	2804080	It was a little awkward.
2804480	2807360	Um, I'm trying to think if there's like, I know there was something I saw
2807360	2810080	that I, I was like, well, that's weird.
2810440	2813280	Um, Oh yeah.
2813560	2819560	Well, I don't want to spoil it, but, um, one there's, there's a main
2819560	2821520	character that dies in the game.
2822080	2823280	At some point.
2823640	2830880	And so he, you, you take what he dies when you're with him in a car.
2831200	2837480	And then, so I got done with this other portion of the game or I
2837480	2839240	reloaded a save or something.
2839720	2844760	And his corpse was like bouncing on top of the car.
2844800	2848280	Like it was clipping through the car and it was just like, he's bouncing.
2848680	2850920	He was bouncing on the, on the roof of the car.
2850920	2854040	And I'm like, I don't think that's supposed to be doing that.
2854840	2857520	The wonderful thing about corpses is corpses are wonderful things.
2860360	2861600	So that was kind of funny.
2861640	2864160	Um, what other stuff do they have?
2864160	2865120	It's kind of funny in there.
2865120	2868840	So, um, I don't know.
2868840	2875960	I mean, like it's a, just like the whole city is so packed full of detail, but
2875960	2880360	because it's like a sprawling metropolis, that's like futuristic, all the roads,
2880360	2883880	like twist around, so like I may have a way point, that's just like a little
2883880	2887920	bit away on my map, but I got to drive way the other side of town and then
2888200	2891600	make a U-turn and come back to hit the road, be able to get up to that spot.
2891840	2896400	But I mean, minor gripes aside though, it's just, it's such a gorgeous game.
2896440	2897680	Like it really is.
2897840	2898440	I get it.
2898480	2901480	And you know, the, the console versions right now are a little bit rough, but
2901480	2905440	like, Oh man, on PC, it looks so gorgeous.
2905920	2908400	So I am really enjoying it despite the bugs.
2908400	2913280	Um, well, we'll talk more about some of those internet reactions and just a
2913280	2915640	little bit here when we finish our gaming weeks, but, um, yeah.
2916760	2917040	Yeah.
2917160	2918440	Anything else to share with your gaming week?
2919120	2919920	Oh yeah, yeah, sorry.
2919960	2923600	Um, so a few other things I did play some more Minecraft.
2923640	2926200	Um, so there'll be something we'll be talking about a little bit later about
2926200	2929560	Minecraft that, um, I got to check out this week.
2929600	2936040	I also, so my son was building a castle and so that led me to go want to check
2936080	2938760	out the old bog Minecraft server.
2938760	2941040	So I had downloaded a copy of that.
2941200	2942680	Like I kept backups of it.
2942880	2943120	Sure.
2943120	2946400	So from the Java version, I tried to reload it.
2946480	2952320	It's I mean, it's from like one 1.08 and we have like, I think we're up to one 16
2952320	2959760	now and I tried loading it in that new Java version and they loads, but
2959760	2962840	everything is broken, like all of the redstone and stuff's broken.
2963080	2966000	And also like it wouldn't load in further chunks out of,
2966080	2967800	outside the initial area.
2968000	2970680	So I don't know if I did, I'm sure I did something wrong importing it.
2970680	2973240	Cause the save files aren't even the same format anymore.
2973640	2978000	Um, so, but I at least got the show, I'm kind of some of the stuff that, you
2978000	2979600	know, everybody created and everything.
2979600	2980320	So that's cool.
2980840	2985400	Um, and then what else I do, um, more Orna.
2985440	2986480	I did play some of that.
2986560	2991080	Um, I talked a little bit about it last week, how I was trying to get, um,
2991840	2994360	the emulators onto my Xbox series X.
2994360	2997760	So I was able to get the developer of that to whitelist my account.
2997760	3000880	So I did get them downloaded the retail versions of those.
3000880	3006960	So now I can actually run emulators on, um, my Xbox series X without having to go
3006960	3009120	into developer mode, which is kind of cool.
3009440	3012920	Um, so I helped to play around with that at some point, but I haven't got a chance
3012920	3017600	to, but I'm very excited about that because I can put even like Wii games
3017600	3020360	on there and stuff, uh, GameCube games around on it.
3020360	3022280	I mean, it's going to be pretty crazy.
3022920	3025440	Um, so we'll play with that a little bit later, but, and then, like I said,
3025440	3029400	I did work a little bit on my game, but not a ton, I will probably work on it
3029400	3032480	more this week though, because I do want to, uh, put some more progress in it.
3032480	3035960	We, I, we were discussing the new level ideas.
3035960	3039520	So one of the things that did come up was a cyber poop 2077.
3039920	3042640	We have to do like a cyberpunk level or something.
3043880	3045720	I appreciate that very much.
3045840	3048280	Um, so, so we may have to do that.
3048280	3050440	Um, so that might be something that's coming.
3050840	3051280	All right.
3051320	3052440	Nice little tease there.
3052480	3053200	Uh, I like that.
3053360	3057280	Are you going to emulate your game on an Xbox series X?
3058520	3059800	Um, if it'll run.
3059800	3062040	So like I had, it depends on what I ended up doing.
3062040	3067240	So if I don't do animated tiles, which, uh, and I don't do any sort of like.
3067880	3068840	Data saving.
3068840	3070960	So I don't have like a high score table that saves.
3071000	3075600	I can change it from a mapper 30 to a mapper two, which is more
3075600	3077560	compatible with emulators.
3077600	3081680	A mapper 30 is really only pop or compatible with a few different types
3081680	3083560	of emulators because it's relatively new.
3083880	3087760	So like probably messin or FC UX, I think.
3088280	3090560	Um, I don't know.
3090560	3093240	I had to check and see what, what it'll work with, but there there's
3093240	3096800	way this, the converted, if I don't use certain features, I can't wait
3096800	3098280	to steal your game and emulate it.
3100120	3103320	Well, I mean, it's emulating right now, so you can definitely do it with messin.
3103320	3107240	I mean, that's what's what's showing on screen, but, um, but yeah.
3107360	3107880	Eventually.
3108000	3108480	All right.
3108680	3109000	All right.
3109040	3113640	Eventually someday we'll find my cart on one of those Chinese bootleg things.
3113960	3114840	I'll see you in the video.
3114840	3116800	One example, what's this pixel poops game.
3116800	3118880	This is weird, stupid.
3119240	3119640	All right.
3119640	3124640	So some Joe Schmoe YouTube video going the 10 stupidest NES games ever made.
3124960	3125360	All right.
3125360	3128480	Uh, anyway, uh, my gaming week.
3128480	3132240	So, um, I've been playing a variety of stuff continuing on dragon quest 11,
3132280	3134520	uh, definitive edition on Xbox series X.
3134520	3135680	I was talking about that last week.
3135920	3138320	I'm definitely way past the point I was on PlayStation four.
3138320	3140840	I'm just about to the 20 hour mark in the game.
3141120	3143800	Um, I just, um, how do I say this spoiler free?
3143960	3151120	I just fought a giant spider as a boss in a cave that was underground, a city that
3151120	3155040	had, so I'll just say that to keep it very vague, that is where I'm at in the game.
3155040	3157560	So I feel like I'm a decent chunk of the game into it.
3157920	3162920	Um, and, uh, I went back cause I was finding some of those little, um, what
3162920	3167440	are the little toggles I think they're called, I forget their name, but that
3167440	3171160	opens up the whole thing that was in the 3DS version of the game, the ticker tin.
3171160	3174200	I'm probably missing up the name, but I went back and did some of that too.
3174200	3175360	Cause that was kind of interesting.
3175360	3177840	And it's, I didn't realize that they all kind of played into each other.
3178000	3182760	Like you might have to get an item for one, like for dragon quest threes,
3182760	3185400	little flashback from dragon quest nine flashbacks.
3185400	3186520	I thought that was kind of interesting.
3186840	3191960	So, um, yeah, that was, uh, my experience with dragon quest 11.
3191960	3192720	Still been playing that.
3192960	3196560	Um, continuing on with, you know, Pokemon go the usual, I got 15
3196560	3198880	Chinese over the weekend cause they had the big community day.
3199120	3200960	Kind of best of was this weekend.
3201240	3203360	And so I played a lot yesterday.
3203360	3206240	I was only able to play for a little bit today, but I did some
3206240	3207840	driving around and Bluetooth catching.
3207840	3210360	I did all Bluetooth catching and that went pretty well.
3211000	3214080	Um, and then other games, one other game that I checked out this week, that's,
3214080	3215840	uh, for me is a little bit newer.
3216160	3219920	Uh, last week we were talking about that the game destiny two was going to be
3219920	3222480	getting its Xbox series S and X upgrade.
3222960	3223360	Week.
3223360	3225480	And I believe it got its PlayStation five upgrade as well.
3225800	3228480	And so I, uh, went in and I downloaded it.
3228520	3232720	Um, after the, you know, a patch came out for next gen and I was
3232720	3235280	checking it out a little bit, you know, and I haven't played it in a while.
3235280	3238640	I played it briefly when stadia had it.
3238880	3241840	Uh, well, it still has it, but when I had stadia, which was when, you know,
3241840	3245280	when Bobby gave me that pass really early on was probably the last time I played
3245280	3247520	maybe like 20 minutes of, of destiny two.
3247840	3251360	Um, but the last time I really, really played it was like when it first came out.
3251600	3255840	So it's interesting to me to see all the changes, because one thing I did notice
3255840	3259640	right away was that kind of the whole opening of the game is, is different than
3259640	3260920	what it used to be.
3261160	3266640	I, I think it was, they used a map that they were still using about two years
3266640	3271040	ago, but they do it differently so that you don't just go right to the big city.
3271040	3276000	That was something I noticed was that in the original, you kind of went right to
3276000	3279840	the big city and you're almost overwhelmed with things to do in this one.
3279840	3284160	You kind of stick to that first little map and you start to learn more about
3284160	3287160	like doing quests and bounties and things within that map.
3287440	3288480	And I thought it was interesting.
3288920	3296240	And, um, honestly, the, uh, other, uh, uh, thing with destiny on Xbox series X.
3296400	3297320	It's gorgeous.
3297520	3300800	It's really, really good looking, uh, and smooth.
3301120	3303520	And I know that I'm terrible at first person shooters, but I
3303520	3304280	know that's important.
3304600	3306280	Um, I w I'm very pleased.
3306600	3311800	I sometimes see just the tiniest bit of texture pop in, but like I have to be on a
3311800	3316680	vehicle and I have to be kind of looking for it, uh, in order to, to see that.
3316720	3320480	Otherwise I think the game runs really smooth and it's, uh, you know, again,
3320480	3322120	considering it's all on game pass.
3322160	3326240	Um, well, I think the game is a free to play thing anyway, at this point.
3326520	3328480	Um, so you can get most of it for free.
3328480	3331800	I know that beyond light expansion, I think is where they're trying to charge
3331800	3332560	people right now.
3332840	3335200	Um, and I don't think that one is free on game pass.
3335200	3338480	I think everything else is, um, but you know, that's still, it's still a good
3338480	3341720	chunk of stuff to experience and, um, yeah, I'm, I'm into it.
3342000	3342720	I think it's pretty neat.
3342840	3347680	So, um, Questbuster in chat says I should reload destiny two to see
3347680	3349080	what's changed one of these days.
3349280	3351440	Well, apparently they got rid of a bunch of maps.
3351720	3355360	Um, so that's interesting in and of itself as well, or they archive them,
3355360	3356480	they sent them to the vault.
3356840	3359720	Um, so maybe they'll come back, uh, for special events or something later.
3359800	3361120	So, all right.
3361400	3362440	So yeah, that was my gaming week.
3362480	3365040	I played a surprising amount of destiny too.
3365080	3366480	Amongst my dragon quest 11.
3366720	3367120	Oh yeah.
3367120	3369160	Final Fantasy 14 got the big story patch.
3369200	3370840	So I was playing that as well, but that's a given.
3371000	3372880	When haven't I talked about that game in a week?
3373000	3375600	I play that game way too much.
3375920	3376200	All right.
3377400	3381720	Oh, black compat is correcting me in chat saying beyond light is on game pass two.
3381960	3383160	I did not realize that.
3383200	3384880	I thought that was something extra you had to buy.
3384920	3385880	I stand corrected.
3386200	3387680	That's part of why we have a live chat.
3387680	3391240	So that's kind of neat that you get the newest expansion through game pass.
3391440	3391720	Huh?
3392200	3394360	Obviously I haven't gotten that far in the game yet.
3394600	3398000	Uh, to where I know, cause I think now you don't just have light, you have dark.
3398200	3401120	I think that's the big twist, but I don't, I'm not far enough.
3401200	3403720	I've, I'm still like basically in the tutorial for God's sake.
3403960	3410280	Um, I've done some things like I, I was, I've gone to like three
3410280	3411720	different areas on that map.
3411760	3414600	So I think I've almost explored that whole map by now.
3414600	3415600	So yeah.
3416080	3419000	Uh, quest buster in chat says the new classes are so fun.
3419000	3419640	I've heard.
3420000	3422720	Um, I mained a warlock, which is what I'm playing too.
3422840	3425920	So the stasis class was added for those and I'm curious to see what it's
3425920	3427720	like, but it's not a free edition.
3427960	3431120	Well, it sounds like they might have some, uh, stuff on game pass.
3431120	3435800	They're worth checking out if you're an Xbox person, um, or a PC person.
3435920	3439800	I don't remember if that whole thing is on PC as well, but yeah, it's,
3439800	3441400	it runs great on, on series X.
3441920	3442240	All right.
3442280	3443280	That's it for my gaming week.
3443560	3446960	Let's get into some gaming news and for the gaming news this week, we
3446960	3451080	have to go right back to cyberpunk because it's what lots of people
3451080	3452000	are talking about, right?
3452800	3453280	Yep.
3453320	3455840	It's what, what everyone's talking about.
3458200	3461480	Well, no, it's not just that it's, it's a little bit buggy.
3461760	3463120	Um, or a lot buggy.
3463160	3465240	It's also that it's breaking records.
3465240	3469560	So it's, uh, breaking the steam records with over 1 million concurrent
3469560	3472120	players, um, during launch week.
3472440	3478600	So peeking out at 1 million, 300 thousand, 264 players.
3479120	3485960	And, uh, previously, apparently the record was, um, held by fallout
3485960	3490080	four, which was 472,962.
3490120	3490680	Wow.
3491520	3492520	That's quite a difference.
3493080	3494000	Quite a difference.
3494000	3494360	Yeah.
3494440	3496240	And I want to say sales wise too.
3496240	3497680	It's, it's doing really well.
3498080	3503400	Um, and I want to say I prior to that, the record was actually, I think the
3503400	3508160	last, um, work world of Warcraft expansion, that Warcraft expansion
3508200	3511680	had the record for like a week and then cyberpunk came in and took it.
3512000	3515120	And so that kind of begs the question, how much of this is the pandemic
3515320	3519320	coming into play and people that are, you know, listening when the folks
3519320	3522280	say stay at home and so they're staying at home playing video games.
3522280	3526360	And I think, I think as far as like the steam concurrent players thing, I
3526360	3528640	think the pandemic plays into that a lot.
3528800	3530560	And that's not to knock the game success.
3530640	3531840	Uh, again, I haven't played it.
3531840	3537360	I have no opinion, but, um, I, I think that part of it certainly
3537360	3541080	helps, you know, especially when you look at the, the, such that you
3541080	3543760	had 470,000 was the old record.
3543760	3545160	And now it's a million.
3545400	3546680	That's a huge difference.
3546680	3548360	And I think the pandemic plays into that a bit.
3548560	3551440	And of course the hype for cyber, it probably would have shattered
3551440	3554880	the record anyway, but to shatter it that much, I guess that's my real
3554880	3557840	point to shatter it that much is certainly part of the pandemic.
3558440	3561040	Well, and I'm curious as though what the launch stuff is.
3561040	3563960	Cause I, I want to say probably all games across the board and
3563960	3567160	steam are probably much higher than they were, you know, at launch before.
3567360	3570040	I don't know if this is necessarily like launch week stuff, or if it's just
3570080	3572440	in total, like this is the highest peak.
3572440	3576120	Cause I got to imagine like among us right now is probably pretty high as well.
3576240	3576560	Sure.
3576600	3580240	Um, I'd be curious to see if like that, if they're talking about like
3580280	3582240	launch week, the numbers on that.
3582760	3587320	Um, so kind of along with that, you know, one thing that's been an
3587320	3592200	industry trend is basing a lot of their, uh, developer bonuses off of
3592200	3597080	Metacritic scores and being that it's been kind of, you know, rough
3597120	3600920	around the edges coming out, you know, that could obviously impact scores.
3601240	3607120	Well, apparently, uh, CJ product red, um, exclusive or executives have said
3607480	3614400	that, um, they take full, um, responsibility for the, uh, complexity of
3614400	3618120	the game or the, uh, you know, the shortcomings basically, and saying
3618120	3621760	that developers are going to be getting, you know, their full bonus.
3622200	3626320	No matter how it reviews, uh, which is really what they should
3626320	3627600	be doing in the first place.
3628080	3633760	Um, also we talked about last week, how there was some issues with epilepsy.
3633880	3640720	Um, you know, no warnings that whatsoever in the game, um, but now
3640720	3644200	they do have a warning that comes up in the beginning of the game.
3644240	3648640	And it says the effect has also been smooth out and the flashes, um,
3648680	3650480	reduced in frequency and magnitude.
3650480	3652680	I didn't notice any flashing in the game.
3653040	3656920	Um, I'm assuming maybe because they patched this stuff out, but, uh, yeah,
3656920	3661880	they patched it out like two days ago, I think, and the original really hurting
3661880	3665560	people, yeah, Bob, Bobby goes into detail somewhat on his show.
3665560	3669040	He does not have the condition that causes seizures, but he has a
3669040	3671400	different neurological condition and he talks about on his show.
3671400	3674920	So a cheap plug for Bobby Blackwell show, but he kind of talked about how
3674920	3679080	he was watching a Twitch play through and had to basically go lie down for
3679080	3682760	a little bit because that sequence came up, uh, on the launch day or the
3682760	3686360	day after and it kinda, you know, it's, it's, it's set off that whole,
3686400	3687680	uh, chain of events there.
3687920	3690400	So, um, yeah, that was a real kinda.
3690720	3695320	How in the heck did you manage to do something so stupid, but at least they
3695320	3700600	patched it out and they were the gal who reported it on Twitter and her
3700600	3703160	tweet got all the traction she didn't.
3703160	3706800	She kind of like, I don't want to say she helped them, but basically she
3706800	3711920	kind of like, she gave her seal of they fixed it, like she gave her yay.
3712040	3712720	I'm so happy.
3712720	3715800	My feedback, uh, helped to fix this whole thing, right?
3715840	3716080	Yeah.
3716120	3718760	Well, there's actually one of the journalists that was, thank you.
3718760	3719920	Bobby says she did help them.
3720640	3722600	I suffered a seizure from it.
3722600	3725720	So, um, yeah, it's good that they fixed that.
3725720	3728360	And some other stuff they also fixed as well, because they didn't patch you
3728360	3730760	in our regular basis, they're already up to a 1.04.
3731040	3732920	So they've done a few patches since launch.
3732960	3740360	Um, they also added that additional, uh, song that was causing DMCA strikes.
3740760	3746080	By the way, uh, a side note here, um, during the game awards, lots of DM,
3746160	3748560	lots of, uh, copyrighted music.
3748760	3753520	Still haven't heard anything about people getting DMCA strikes from the game awards,
3753520	3756920	especially doing co-streaming, but I'd be curious to see what happens
3756920	3760680	to later with that, uh, quite live question for, okay.
3760680	3762520	Bobby says we haven't got struck yet from the co-stream.
3762520	3765480	I know that cause I would have seen that email too, but did, did we
3765480	3769800	archive our Thursday stream because part of me was wondering if maybe we
3769800	3774800	hesitated doing that because I'm the slowest person in the world at archiving
3774800	3776120	a well are I'd lose episodes.
3776120	3779360	If Bobby wasn't poking me on Sunday saying, don't forget, save
3779360	3780360	the archive, you're going to lose it.
3780760	3781240	I did.
3781240	3786720	We not archive Thursday's thing because that might actually be because I don't
3786720	3788320	think a lot of clips were made.
3788560	3791680	So we may not get DMCA'd if it wasn't our, okay.
3791680	3792520	Bobby says it's there.
3792640	3796240	And then, so we'll find out Bobby was seeing with the, uh, calibrating
3796240	3797280	their brain dance machines.
3797280	3800960	So yeah, they, they take out, they've taken out the flashing lights.
3801000	3804440	It's definitely, you know, here's a light on here.
3804480	3805680	Here's a light on here.
3805680	3807640	And then they both go on and fades the white.
3807920	3809720	Um, not really.
3810320	3812680	It's not flashing so that that's good.
3812760	3815960	Um, so that's been taken out of the game.
3816280	3821800	Um, and of course, you know, some other fun, uh, glitches
3821800	3823360	that people are running into.
3823360	3829560	So there is a glitch right now where, um, Apparently people's genitals in the
3829560	3831480	game are popping through their pants.
3831480	3834400	It's clipping through their clothing, which is kind of weird.
3834520	3840360	Um, weird or fun, whatever the case may be.
3840920	3843040	I was like, it's Eric Andre mode.
3843120	3849600	Um, so I've seen the pictures from Dory alley that, that, that does happen.
3852520	3856280	And it's not, it's not just, um, the males having that problem too.
3856320	3862280	Uh, apparently women are also having some of their body parts, uh, as well.
3862280	3864000	So, you know, it's, it's fun.
3864080	3868120	Um, I can't believe you made a Doria Ali reference.
3869480	3872760	I think that's the first, how long, how long?
3872760	3874520	I don't know if anyone else though.
3874800	3877800	I don't know if people in other parts of the country know what Doria Ali is.
3877840	3883560	It's, it's a, it's, it's a festival in San Francisco, and that's probably
3883560	3887120	all I need to say about it in regards to that joke for people to get it.
3887120	3887560	Yes.
3888320	3895560	Um, also apparently I know Sony is issuing refunds for cyberpunk if people
3895560	3899520	are requesting them because of the issues they've been having with the
3899600	3903160	game on like PlayStation four, especially how it looks.
3903440	3907760	So that may be something, if folks are interested, honestly, I would say,
3908040	3914000	especially if you have a PlayStation five or Xbox series X best, if you, if
3914000	3919840	you can just wait until, um, it comes out, you know, specifically for those
3919840	3924640	versions in March, otherwise, I mean, I think it looks okay.
3924640	3926120	I haven't played it on console yet.
3926120	3929440	I was planning on getting on my Xbox at some point, probably not a huge
3929440	3930880	hurry because I have it on PC.
3931200	3934840	But at some point I probably will get it on there as well.
3935120	3939920	Um, but definitely if you can do it on PC, that's probably the platform
3939920	3944160	you want to be on because there's a lot of flexibility with game performance
3944160	3948240	on there, so you can kind of, you can really tweak that to however you want.
3948720	3951640	Um, I'm taking the Allen approach to this whole thing.
3951640	3955360	And, and my, my husband, when it comes to things like cyberpunk is very like,
3955680	3960600	you know, I will play it in two years after the game of the year edition is
3960600	3965520	out after all the mods are out and after, you know, everything is like, it's done.
3965520	3966640	It's a 100%.
3966640	3969480	They're not doing anything else for the game and the modding communities on fire.
3969680	3971240	That is when I'll step in and play cyberpunk.
3971240	3974720	And I think in this case, I'm kinda, I'm kinda right there too.
3974960	3980120	Um, I'm curious about it, but just right now there's this, the gaming backlog
3980120	3982880	struggle is real, there's so much to play.
3983080	3986360	I just, I, I'm, I'm not going to get around to that one anytime soon.
3986360	3986920	I'm really not.
3988160	3988600	Okay.
3988880	3989160	Yeah.
3990320	3992240	So that's all the fun stuff with cyberpunk.
3992240	3995080	I'm sure we'll find some more crazy things.
3995280	4000000	I also saw some, um, some funny glitches where, uh, certain NPC
4000000	4004160	characters would follow you no matter where you went in the game, which was
4004160	4007880	also funny, so they had like this like creepy weird guy that was following you
4007880	4008200	around.
4009200	4012840	Um, looking at some comments in chat, uh, code man in chat says, hi, code man.
4012840	4015800	It's been a while, uh, says, apparently I read an article where they didn't,
4015840	4019920	uh, accolades, I think, I think he wanted to use another word there and voice to
4019920	4023720	text messed him up, uh, maybe, uh, accommodate, uh, VRAM correctly.
4023720	4026680	And that's one of the reasons why it's buggy on PC.
4028240	4031360	I think they could have delayed this game another six months.
4031360	4032600	I think he means allocate.
4032640	4033320	That's it.
4033320	4033880	Allocate.
4033880	4034440	Thank you.
4034680	4037720	Um, and I think they could have delayed this game another six months.
4037720	4040280	And it probably wouldn't have fixed all the bugs, especially on the older
4040280	4045880	consoles, doing a pretty good job of like, you know, going through it and patching
4045880	4046320	stuff.
4046320	4047480	So I don't know.
4049320	4050040	Black ink.
4050760	4051520	It's not so bad.
4051600	4055360	Uh, black and Pat in our chat room says I'm playing it on my series X in
4055360	4057400	performance mode and so far so good.
4057440	4061400	It are pretty, uh, and I'm not surprised to hear that because you know, the series
4061400	4064200	X is basically like a, a real high end PC.
4064200	4066080	It's a dedicated, you know, gaming machine.
4066760	4070440	And I would, I would, especially after my experience with destiny this week, I would
4070440	4075800	expect that it runs like butter on the series X and PlayStation five, I'm sure as
4075800	4077840	well, which I have yet to see.
4078000	4079400	So, all right.
4079840	4081800	Any other cyberpunk notes for this week?
4081880	4082760	I'm sure there'll be more.
4083600	4084400	Uh, that's it.
4084480	4084840	All right.
4085080	4090040	Well, one other place that people are playing cyberpunk, um, where apparently
4090040	4094440	it's a pretty good experience and, you know, uh, despite all the, um, criticisms,
4094440	4099360	I think that have been levied at Google stadia, uh, the people that have decided
4099360	4103440	to play cyberpunk on Google stadia are having a pretty good time, um, assuming,
4103440	4107680	you know, they have the bandwidth to do it because all that cloud, uh, power and
4107680	4110960	everything that goes, it's, it's, it's different, you know, there, everything is
4110960	4113600	running pretty smooth on that end on stadia.
4113600	4120120	So that's kind of interesting that with cyberpunk being so buggy on PlayStation
4120120	4124840	four and, uh, you know, the original X-Box one and all this, it's almost like
4124840	4130800	it's, this is stadia's best kind of limelight right now for their, what
4130800	4135440	they're trying to do, like, well, you see how this game doesn't mishmash well
4135440	4136680	on all these other platforms.
4136840	4141120	It runs great on ours and you don't have to buy a $500 box to do it because, you
4141120	4145040	know, one could argue that series X and PlayStation five are fine as well, or a
4145040	4150000	high end PC, but here's where stadia, uh, can probably make its best argument yet.
4150280	4154720	Um, However, of course that all still comes down to the question about, do you
4154720	4158320	have the bandwidth for it, which is, you know, but that's a whole, whole other
4158320	4158560	thing.
4158560	4160160	You got to figure out what works for you.
4160520	4166640	Um, however, eight more European countries now have access to Google stadia,
4166640	4171400	including Poland, uh, which is important, you know, considering cyberpunk 2077 and
4171400	4175840	where it was made, uh, but also Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, uh,
4175840	4180480	Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and Switzerland now all have access to Google
4180480	4180880	stadia.
4180880	4183040	So that all just rolled out within this last week.
4183320	4186920	Um, and of course you can play things like cyberpunk, Assassin's Creed, Valhalla,
4186920	4189240	Marvel's Avengers, uh, and so forth.
4189640	4194200	Um, something else of note with Google stadia this week is that the use YouTube
4194200	4198320	live streaming actually rolled out this week just in time for cyberpunk.
4198320	4200280	I think they knew that that would be kind of a big deal.
4200400	4204160	So I remember they teased that early on and then it wasn't really in the pro to
4204160	4204720	begin with.
4204960	4208920	Well, now you can actually go, uh, YouTube streaming.
4209160	4213200	Uh, it appears to be rolling out and it's now on the service and you can either
4213320	4217480	stream directly to YouTube or you can use a streaming software to do it.
4217520	4222080	Although it still kind of pushes you to YouTube for obvious reasons, cause both
4222080	4223320	are in the Google universe.
4223680	4228040	Um, so you, you know, you have to still set things like, is it kid appropriate?
4228280	4231680	Uh, there's optional features like crowd choice and crowd play.
4231920	4234520	Uh, you can also pick your audio options.
4234520	4239080	Do you want to stream YouTube and game chat, YouTube only party chat or nobody
4239080	4240880	and just have the game audio going there?
4241200	4245920	Um, so kind of interesting that, uh, that all rolled out just in time for cyberpunk.
4246200	4249120	I have yet to see any streams myself that are using it.
4249440	4251920	Um, but I think that's, I think that's.
4252400	4256400	Again, you know, I've been awfully critical of Google stadia here on the
4256400	4261080	show, but I th this week and everything that's happened with cyberpunk has really
4261120	4265800	given Google an opportunity to say, aha, here's why you need us.
4266120	4270080	And now maybe they can run with that a little bit and injecting new features
4270080	4272600	like the YouTube thing is a, is a decent way to do it and keep people
4272600	4273680	talking about the platform.
4273880	4275200	So we'll see what develops again.
4275200	4277240	I still think the bandwidth issue they're going to have to, especially
4277240	4280160	with Comcast expanding their caps, but we'll see, we'll see.
4280800	4281960	So, all right.
4282320	4283720	Uh, moving on dark soccer.
4284200	4288880	I know that you said caps, but my brain translated it to cats and I
4288920	4290560	I'm thinking of expanding cats.
4290560	4294840	And I don't know that that kind of makes me think of the game where you
4294840	4298160	have like cats that blow up, like the aunt and the Harry Potter movie.
4298600	4301280	And you have to pilot them like across the ocean or something
4301280	4302960	without, you know, deflating your cat.
4303240	4306520	There was that cat game we saw on the PlayStation five reveal.
4306520	4308400	We haven't heard anything on that in a little while.
4308560	4309480	And I don't think it's exclusive.
4309480	4310840	I think my cat game sounds better.
4311240	4312640	You know, your cat game sounds pretty rad.
4313640	4314800	All right, moving on.
4314800	4317320	I'm going to call it ever expanding cats.
4317360	4317840	There we go.
4318560	4323240	Anyway, well, I'm sure we're all familiar with bad robot studio, right?
4323320	4328160	Um, well there is bad robots game studios, which is JJ Abrams company.
4328480	4333320	Um, but they got, uh, valves, uh, Michael booth to, uh, to join in.
4333360	4339120	Um, and he's leading, uh, bad robot games through its first development cycle.
4339520	4344200	So, um, he's going to serve as the creative director, um, and jumping
4344280	4346120	into the video game development.
4346120	4350120	Actually it started the gaming dev, uh, division in 2018 and
4350120	4352520	he's got a pretty good repertoire.
4352520	4354440	I mean, just a lot of stuff under his belt.
4354520	4359560	Um, uh, lead creator for left for dead team fortress to command and conquer
4359560	4364680	generals, uh, some of the counter-strike games, um, and he's been at blizzard,
4364720	4369960	uh, EA, uh, I mean, that was a command and conquer red alert two and knocks.
4370520	4372760	And social VR director at Facebook.
4373000	4381680	Um, but I mean, the thing with bad robot games is that if those licenses carry
4381680	4385760	over for what they did for some of the, the movies we've got then the newer
4385760	4390880	star Trek films, uh, star Wars rise of the rise of the Skywalker Cloverfield.
4391440	4394560	Um, and it could be very possible.
4394560	4397480	Those licenses could expand into video games to have them do the development.
4397520	4402360	So, I mean, it's just a little bit of a musing there on my part, but,
4402360	4408920	um, and I think it's going to be, um, be interesting and also, um, the CEO,
4408960	4414760	uh, who was recently appointed name is Anna Sweet, um, and she was saying
4414760	4418240	basically that their goal, and I'm going to quote here is to focus on cross
4418240	4422280	medium world building in order to create games and step with Abrams
4422280	4423720	television and film projects.
4424280	4427640	So I'm really looking forward to seeing what comes of the studio.
4427640	4429520	I actually have a lot of hope for it.
4430040	4437600	Um, and as far as, um, they are working on a project right now that has just
4437600	4442200	been titled triple a title for PC slash console that is designed to immerse
4442240	4446360	both players and streaming audiences into a co-op cinematic experience.
4446920	4447280	Okay.
4447640	4451680	My money, my money's on Cloverfield and that franchise.
4452480	4456320	Um, but that's, that's just what my gut says.
4456320	4459160	Cause it's not going to be something like star Trek cause that has too many
4459160	4462240	other, so it's gotta be something a little more original and cooked up from
4462240	4465960	the Abrams and so I Cloverfield would make a lot of sense in that whole thing.
4467480	4470160	And, you know, of course you're going to have a lens flare mode.
4470560	4475040	If it's going to be a star Trek, I was going to say like with the Ray tracing
4475040	4478960	powers of these new consoles, you know, I, this is going to be great for the,
4478960	4484120	uh, lens flares that the bad robots games are sure to have Abrams loves his lens
4484120	4488920	flare, but you know, you know, actually what I'm hoping for though is it would
4488920	4494000	be cool if the game is released, that's got a cinematic style that mimics,
4494080	4501080	uh, certain cameras and film, because I mean, one of the things that they, he
4501080	4505080	was, it was specifically when they were shooting, um, the, the star Trek movies
4505480	4510240	is that, uh, he was using, I think it was like an older style of camera and, uh,
4510320	4515320	actually using film just to catch those, those effects, I have to go back and look
4515320	4519640	for it, but I know it had something to do with the, um, with a specific lens
4519640	4520200	used on it.
4520200	4521840	So I thought it was really cool.
4522200	4526600	And I was actually, uh, joking about the lens flare thing, Bobby.
4526840	4528080	Well, let me read Bobby's comment.
4528080	4530840	Cause, uh, Abrams no longer loves his lens flares.
4531120	4534560	Uh, his wife pointed out how bad they were in the second star Trek movie.
4534720	4536440	And he was like, holy shit, you're right.
4536440	4537680	So Gigi lens flare.
4538800	4539120	Yeah.
4540720	4542840	We'll get a sequel to super eight.
4543080	4546880	Remember they did the thing in, um, source engine for super eight back when
4546880	4550920	that came out, super eight was such a good movie too.
4552160	4556360	I think that would be awesome, but yeah, unfortunately, it didn't really tie in
4556360	4560240	with, um, I was hoping that that movie would tie in with Cloverfield, but I
4560240	4560920	don't think it did.
4561280	4561920	No, it didn't.
4562240	4565320	A lot of weird Cloverfield spinoffs that I haven't watched.
4565400	4568680	There was a, yeah, there was the, I've never actually seen any of the
4568680	4571320	Cloverfield at all.
4571320	4574440	I saw the first one and it was interesting.
4575160	4575280	Yeah.
4575280	4580240	The Cloverfield, uh, paradox and then 10 Cloverfield lane and yeah.
4580680	4580840	Yeah.
4580840	4581320	I heard that.
4582320	4585840	I heard that 10 Cloverfield lane is pretty, because John Goodman's in that
4585840	4588480	one and everybody was saying he got robbed, not getting an Oscar nomination
4588480	4591600	for it, which is weird to think of Oscar and Cloverfield, but good
4591600	4592640	acting is good acting, right?
4593480	4593840	Yeah.
4594160	4598480	Like, I don't know, maybe when I get back on to this, that kind of movie kick.
4598720	4602920	To this day, Joan Cusack deserved a Oscar nomination for Adam's Family
4602920	4603440	Values.
4603440	4605640	I don't give a shit what you have to say.
4606480	4608120	She was actually perfect.
4608280	4610960	She elevates, she, she made that movie about a character that
4610960	4612280	wasn't just the Adams family.
4612520	4612920	Sorry.
4612960	4617440	I just, I need a whole podcast to talk about Joan Cusack.
4617760	4619000	What, what?
4619120	4622960	We need to have a Joan Cusack double feature where we watch, uh,
4622960	4624840	Adam's Family Values and toys.
4625360	4626000	Oh, sure.
4626760	4629880	I love toys, toys in years.
4630360	4632160	And that was my Christmas movie right there.
4632160	4636560	Wasn't that Tori Amos that did the soundtrack?
4637040	4637680	I love it.
4637720	4638400	I love that.
4638400	4640080	It's like the title song they have.
4640080	4641120	I don't think it was Tori Amos.
4641120	4644600	I think it was, um, it was someone along those lines.
4644600	4647600	And for the life of me, I can't remember one of those piano divas.
4648920	4651080	Yeah, but not like Kate Bush.
4651080	4651960	She doesn't do anything.
4652440	4655400	Um, Kate, Kate Bush does, does her own.
4655440	4657920	Kate Bush does things when she damn well feels like it.
4657920	4660480	And you will respect that fucking Kate Bush.
4660640	4661320	That's right.
4662120	4664280	She's running up that Hill still for the record.
4664960	4665960	I love Kate Bush.
4665960	4669840	Like she's like when she puts out a record, like stop everything and do it.
4670640	4670960	All right.
4670960	4674240	Another, another artist I really like that might surprise you, who I was just,
4674240	4677360	I was just thinking the other day, dark cycle, maybe you can guess this one.
4677560	4680520	I was just thinking the other day, this artist hasn't released
4680520	4681960	anything in, in several years.
4681960	4683880	Tori Amos, by the way, that did that one song.
4683880	4684520	What is it?
4684560	4685000	I was right.
4685800	4686600	The happy worker.
4687440	4692080	Um, and yeah, and yeah, dark soccer wins and you was in it.
4692840	4694160	And so is grace Jones.
4694680	4695200	Really?
4695800	4698280	No, but any of us, the artists I was thinking of, like where the hell she been?
4698280	4700120	She's she's tied up in her castle with her cats.
4702160	4703120	So jealous of her life.
4703160	4703520	All right.
4703880	4706520	Anyway, uh, let's like our sister better.
4707480	4709040	All right, let's move on.
4709320	4709840	Sorry.
4710040	4712840	Uh, we've, we've diverted the show into Kate Bush and Enya talk.
4713320	4719080	Not divert quick next story.
4719080	4725200	So I know one of the things that was missing at launch for the Xbox series S
4725200	4732560	and X is some solid Microsoft, uh, first party games well, unfortunately,
4732560	4737920	2021 doesn't appear to be much of, there's not much of that either.
4737920	4742440	So apparently, uh, we don't really know of any first party games that
4742440	4744480	are going to be coming in 2021.
4744480	4747800	Cause the release calendar doesn't include, um, that many.
4747800	4748280	So.
4748640	4754040	Halo infinite, uh, was definitely something that I know that was slated
4754040	4756520	for next year, although I'm not sure.
4756640	4758280	I mean, it may be holiday.
4758600	4762080	Uh, Psychonauts two is also supposed to be coming as well.
4762440	4766720	I'm surprised though, like with all the third party or all those, um, first
4766720	4768960	party companies that they have that there's not something else that's coming
4768960	4774240	out, but right now we don't know of a whole lot else that's, um, coming out.
4774240	4777920	I know echo generation, something that's supposed to be on its way.
4777920	4782520	The gunk, uh, the medium, but I don't think we have definitive dates
4782520	4784200	on a lot of that stuff as well.
4784520	4793280	So it's interesting not having like a Microsoft title, like coming very soon.
4793720	4794000	Yeah.
4794000	4796960	Especially with, um, Halo getting pushed all the way back to fall,
4796960	4798520	which, um, I think came up this week.
4798560	4802720	Um, and, uh, you know, but again, take the time to get it right.
4802720	4806040	And if Halo was really, you know, having some issues behind the scenes,
4806440	4811040	I, again, playing destiny two with all its upgrades and everything kind of
4811040	4816920	showed me like just how good a Halo game on Xbox series X can be.
4817160	4819880	So I'm kind of glad they're going to, uh, have it spend a
4819880	4821040	little more time in the oven.
4821520	4823240	Um, but I'm not, I don't know.
4823240	4827960	It's, I can't sit here and go, there's nothing to play on my Xbox series X.
4828160	4830240	Like I'm not, I'm not feeling that way really.
4830240	4833160	And you know, I don't know, maybe the game releases are going to be a
4833160	4841080	little dry early next year, but I feel like what Sony got, like what's Nintendo got.
4841080	4843680	We don't, I think there's a lot of stuff that have really slowed
4843680	4845040	down because of the pandemic.
4845240	4845520	Sure.
4845520	4847160	That's cause there's going to be, and I'm sure you guys are
4847160	4848120	already shouting them out in chat.
4848120	4849120	Well, there's this game, there's this game.
4849320	4849600	Yes.
4849600	4851160	There's going to be a few big ones here and there.
4851160	4856040	But I, I, I think Microsoft being without first party for a few months
4856040	4859200	is not the end of the world, as long as they can keep the steady stream
4859200	4863760	of releases somehow, uh, as long as they can keep game pass exciting, uh, by
4863760	4865000	adding new things here and there.
4865000	4867880	Cause you know, most of the Xbox people have game pass at this point anyway.
4868200	4871160	Um, and so on, I, I kind of feel like it's going to be fine.
4873040	4873400	Yeah.
4873400	4875680	I mean, I'm sure they're going to do fine with games pass.
4876120	4879040	Uh, I just would like to know when some of these games are coming out, especially
4879040	4884440	since we've had a lot of stuff teased, especially during E3 time, uh, this year,
4884480	4887440	you know, they kind of teased a lot of different games that are coming, but.
4888520	4892320	I know a lot of those aren't probably even going to make it in 2021.
4892320	4895640	So it'd be curious to see the, what actually is coming out.
4895880	4898960	And I'm sure that we'll get more and more of these release
4898960	4900720	announcements and stuff coming.
4901200	4905360	Um, I also wish I knew what Nintendo had aside from rereleases of old games.
4905440	4908760	It'd be kind of interesting to hear some more about the next, you know,
4908760	4910400	breath of the wild game or something.
4910440	4913000	Um, we'll just have to wait and see, I guess.
4913520	4918080	Yeah, we don't really know much outside of the, uh, super Mario, uh, 3d lands
4918120	4918960	that's, you know, coming out.
4919000	4924240	So I'm expecting we should be getting a direct probably January or February,
4924240	4929920	which if they wanted to reveal a switch pro would be a good time to do it.
4930040	4933480	Um, you know, obviously we talked about this last week and I had that fan wank
4933480	4938480	scenario of, well, could they do a, um, reveal at the game awards?
4938480	4939840	You brought up a really good counterpoint.
4939840	4942160	They're not going to do that right before Christmas when they're trying to sell
4942160	4945200	switches after Christmas fair game.
4946000	4952560	I think they won't announce anything like that until, um, March until March 31st.
4952920	4955520	I don't think we're going to hear anything from a new switch system.
4955520	4959400	And if anything, I would see them not releasing it during holiday.
4959520	4961640	I could even see them release it during the summer.
4961800	4962080	Yeah.
4962200	4967040	Um, I don't think it necessarily needs to be in March or even around Christmas time.
4967040	4971080	Um, it doesn't matter anyways, no one's going to get one because they can't get
4971080	4976400	their supply chain figured out, however many decades into this we've been.
4976680	4980960	They really should try to figure out how they're going to get that out by next
4980960	4985040	summer or, you know, next fall, because I think you're going to see society, you
4985040	4989520	know, as the coronavirus vaccine starts to get more and more out there and, you
4989520	4993760	know, things start to, you know, get a little, we get, we have big in person,
4993760	4996200	in person gatherings again, we are able to travel again.
4996200	4997760	It's obviously, it's not going to happen overnight.
4998000	5002120	You know, I am being a realist here, but I think you are going to see a big push
5002120	5002800	in society.
5002800	5006000	Like there's going to be lots of people that are like, I want to take that
5006000	5006600	vacation.
5006600	5010520	I've been waiting a year and a half to do, or I want to go on this big trip or the,
5010520	5015400	and I feel like having a switch come out for that type of stuff is going to be
5015400	5018960	like when, when people get moving again and you know, the, the whole country
5019200	5023200	starts to get back to some semblance of normal, even if that normal now has
5023680	5027440	tweaks through these things, like, you know, working from home and masks and so
5027440	5031680	forth, I think you're going to see a big, I think it would be smart of Nintendo
5031680	5035400	too, even if they are a Japanese company, but I don't necessarily think, you
5035400	5038440	know, even though Japan has handled the situation very differently, I don't
5038440	5042240	think it's necessarily unfair to say that, you know, they wouldn't have a big
5042240	5045200	push to, you know, getting back to the way things were in summer and fall as
5045200	5045480	well.
5045480	5048520	And having the switch there would be pretty amazing, I think.
5049880	5050800	Yeah, yeah.
5051760	5054920	Well, wait and see, they're on, they're on time table.
5054920	5057440	So we'll have to figure out what they're planning on doing.
5057680	5061000	SSU 100 Matt in chat says, I hope the national parks get some love again.
5061240	5062120	I'm sure they will.
5062120	5066240	You know, if you're looking at doing any travel in 2021, like I know it's
5066240	5069360	weird, but you want to, you want to try to put that on the calendar sooner
5069360	5072360	rather than later, because I'm going to tell you, these companies have lost
5072360	5075160	a lot of money and they're going to be trying to make it up when everybody
5075160	5076840	wants to travel again, it's going to cost money.
5077080	5082240	So, uh, like I already booked my DragonCon 2021 ticket because, you know, I can
5082240	5086000	refund it if the refund policy allows me to, if we're not able, you know, if
5086040	5089440	Labor Day isn't enough time or, you know, DragonCon is too big of a gathering,
5089440	5093440	then, okay, then I will refund it and roll it over to 2022, but I wanted to
5093440	5097480	lock it in now because I expect those prices to go up when, you know, people
5097480	5099120	are able to get out and do stuff again.
5100080	5102320	You should have let me know so we could fly together.
5103280	5108600	Uh, I, I had to use credit from last time, but I'll give you the info on what it is.
5109200	5109880	Well, we'll see.
5109880	5110360	We'll see.
5110360	5115120	I mean, I, um, but I do, I do very much want to go to DragonCon this year.
5115120	5119280	Cause I've already sworn not to go to RuPaul's DragCon again, because of just
5119320	5126000	some of their shit and a lot of the shit that Ru is doing, but I, I really,
5126000	5128000	really want to go to, to DragonCon.
5128000	5131120	And my thing about that is that afterwards I actually want to just
5131120	5133520	rent a car and drive back to Alabama to visit my family.
5133560	5135040	Oh, that's clever.
5135040	5135680	You should.
5135760	5136200	That'd be cool.
5136200	5139200	I mean, it's from Atlanta to Mobile.
5139200	5141120	I want to say it's about six hours.
5141160	5142760	I know it's about four to Dothan.
5142800	5147200	That's about as far as it was for, um, when I went from X first place
5147200	5150120	in Cary, North Carolina, it was about a six hour drive, so yeah.
5150160	5155640	I think I'd be closer to, um, yeah, that actually, yeah, that's about right.
5155640	5156200	That's about right.
5156360	5156640	Yeah.
5156680	5160120	Um, although a part of me also wants to go to Augusta to visit my grandmother's
5160120	5164040	cousins, who I haven't seen since I was little, um, and Bob Coffey in chat
5164040	5167000	says, I don't see cons being a thing until late 2021 at best.
5167000	5169800	It depends on how well the adults who are taking over our federal
5169800	5173520	government, January 20th can reign in the crazy and actually get some things done.
5173520	5173720	Yeah.
5173720	5177680	I mean, I realize I'm being optimistic.
5177760	5182560	Um, but I, I, if I don't have optimism about the future, like then I just.
5182880	5185000	Well, I have to have something to look forward to damn it.
5185000	5189000	So, you know, but I full well aware in the back of my mind, it may not happen
5189000	5192480	again or DragonCon, maybe a smaller affair this year, they may do something
5192480	5195200	where they actually cap attendance at a certain number or something.
5195200	5195760	I don't know.
5195760	5196480	I have nothing.
5196520	5199800	I, I'm just saying there's a lot of things that could happen.
5200040	5201240	We won't know until we know.
5201440	5204800	So as, as has been the, the theme of this year.
5205080	5205320	All right.
5205320	5207040	Anyway, um, let's move on.
5207040	5208520	Shall we speak?
5208560	5211560	Well, actually, you know what, even though we tangented, it ties
5211560	5212800	right into this next story.
5212800	5215040	So that's, that's a first.
5215080	5216760	Our tangent was a transition.
5217080	5224120	Uh, Epic has no plans to do in-person tournaments for the game Fortnite in 2021.
5224400	5228520	So, you know, uh, as was mentioned by the chatter there, they don't see,
5228560	5231880	uh, real life events coming back until at least late 2021.
5232120	5235840	And even though last week we were talking about Penny arcade, trying to
5235960	5239000	expo, trying to be on the hopeful side of things and scheduling out events
5239000	5242520	for the 2021 year, uh, Epic is taking a different approach.
5242520	5246360	The 2021 Fortnite world cup, uh, will not be held in person.
5246680	5251280	Uh, the Fortnite champions champion series will be the focus for 2021 as the.
5251600	5256280	Constant measure of success in the, uh, landscape of competition for Fortnite.
5256520	5260840	And they're hoping that physical attorneys will return at some point in the future.
5261080	5262080	Uh, it should be noted.
5262080	5266640	This could be part of the fact that the season was going to begin on February 4th.
5266800	5269880	So it was going to be a little early, but they did just decide to do
5269880	5271240	a way with, you know, all of it.
5271240	5276600	Um, it should be noted that other big events, such as Dota two's, the
5276600	5281520	international is still on the table for 2021, um, but we don't know yet.
5281640	5285480	Uh, you know, again, and as a lot of you has said, we just have to see how this
5285480	5291480	whole rollout goes with vaccines and does it give society herd immunity or,
5291480	5292800	you know, what's going to happen with it.
5292800	5294840	So, uh, we shall see.
5294880	5298880	I, I know as soon as they'll let me get it, I'll be getting it because
5299000	5300520	I want to see people again, damn it.
5301320	5304520	So, and obviously you have to get it and then you have to wait.
5304880	5306920	This is not a, it's not a switch that happens overnight.
5306960	5310320	So, cause you have to get one, then you get the other, then you still have
5310320	5313160	to wait like two or three weeks or maybe even a month to build up the antibodies.
5313160	5314520	So, all right.
5315120	5318480	Anyway, uh, let's move on with our next story, Dark Sakura.
5321000	5326200	Well, you know, it's funny, we talked about Abrams before and he did, you
5326200	5329400	know, the star Wars movies, I guess we're kind of rolling back maybe a little bit,
5329400	5334120	but honestly, um, I'm actually really excited about this movie coming out
5334120	5337200	because I want to see what Patty Jenkins does with it and that star Wars, rogue
5337200	5343560	squadron, and it must be said because I've seen this come up in, in my social
5343560	5349680	media several times, but I want to point out then that star Wars rogue squadron.
5350120	5353360	Is not going to be based off of the games.
5353920	5358080	Um, it is not an adaptation and I've seen, I've actually seen people start
5358080	5360600	saying, Oh, it's going to be an adaptation, blah, blah, blah, but no.
5361000	5365920	Um, she did, however, say that, um, you know, Jenkins said it was going to be
5365920	5370440	an original story, but she said that it will be done with quote, great influence
5370440	5376720	from both rogue squadron video games and books, so we might have to see what's
5376720	5380960	coming on on it is she's actually pulling the origin from a comic book series.
5380960	5382560	It was written by Michael Stackpole.
5383160	5389680	Um, that again was directly inspired from, uh, the first two of the star
5389680	5392920	Wars movies, which episode four and five, I'm sorry, I think of them when
5392920	5394280	they were released as what was first.
5394920	5400280	Um, and then, um, and some books called the throng trilogy, which we've heard,
5400280	5404160	uh, if, well, I guess if you're living under a rock and you haven't
5404160	5406800	watched the Mandalorian, I'm not going to say anything else.
5407320	5415040	Um, but, uh, but I think there's going to be a lot that we'll see as
5415080	5418640	homage anyway, but it's still an original story and it's not really
5418640	5421840	going from not an adaptation as I was saying, so that's it.
5422600	5425960	Um, boy, and you know, just as a quick aside, you know, even though it's not
5425960	5430160	directly about gaming, but during the game awards, that same night was when
5430160	5434760	Disney was doing this big dump of, you know, all this stuff they're planning
5434760	5435920	during their investor meeting.
5435920	5439960	And it's, it's pretty shocking how much they're going to crank out.
5439960	5446280	What was an entire clause addressing it in chat, 10 star Wars shows, 10 Marvel
5446280	5451200	shows, and I know there was a shit ton of Disney shows too, um, cause 15, I
5451200	5455400	think, yeah, there was like, I know they were doing one for, um, Tiana, uh,
5455440	5458800	from, uh, um, the, the, oh my God.
5459040	5461440	And I even love this movie and I can't even remember the name of it in the moment.
5461720	5462080	Thank you.
5462080	5468240	The Prince of the Frog, uh, is getting a show and, um, the, um, uh, Zootopia
5468280	5471400	is getting a, um, series, which I know is going to make some friends of mine
5471400	5475760	happy and, and there's like a lot of, uh, stuff that's getting expanded on with
5475760	5476160	series.
5476360	5479400	And then of course I got several text messages alerting me to the fact that
5479400	5483760	sister act three was confirmed, which is important on, so I made this big, like,
5483920	5485840	yay, they're doing sister act three.
5485840	5488120	And then it was like, and Tyler Perry is co-producing it.
5488120	5494600	And I was like, oh, we'll see how that goes.
5494640	5496640	Just, I swear to, is it going to have Whoopi?
5497120	5497400	Oh yeah.
5497400	5501280	Whoopi's Whoopi's like co-producing it and she's very influential in it with
5501280	5502000	Tyler Perry.
5502000	5508080	So my own, my only request, you do not put Medea in that fucking movie.
5508280	5514920	Do not under any circumstance, Medea is not to be in that movie period.
5515360	5521800	Because I just it's let the sister act universe be on its own.
5521800	5523000	It does not need a crossover.
5523160	5524120	Kathy Najimy.
5524200	5524840	Yes.
5525120	5529560	Uh, I don't know if they would be able to get, um, um, Maggie Smith.
5529600	5533000	Um, poor thing is, is very, very old at this point, but I'd love it if she made
5533000	5533800	a cameo somehow.
5534280	5535400	Oh, I love her.
5535840	5536400	Okay.
5536560	5540920	Sia Tabiri says sister act three is just being bankrolled by Tyler Perry.
5540920	5541320	Okay.
5542600	5544360	Well, good, I guess.
5545240	5545520	Oh yeah.
5545520	5548280	And Hocus Pocus too is actually, that was, yeah.
5548840	5549040	Yeah.
5549040	5551560	So I haven't seen the first one and I can actually still quote the movie.
5551560	5552800	I'm the same way with Mean Girls.
5554720	5562840	All, um, all of those announcements and nothing about Tron, nothing.
5562840	5567520	But you know, they did make those mentions, uh, earlier in the year that
5567520	5570360	there was something going on behind the scenes for Tron.
5570360	5572000	Maybe they just turned to a trailer point.
5572000	5574440	Cause this is like trailer stuff, you know.
5574480	5575360	Not everything though.
5575360	5576720	They have a lot of announcements.
5576720	5577800	It had no trailers.
5578120	5582440	They have to just like title cards or we had, we had a teaser about something
5582440	5586240	would care about his Tron, all Tron all the time, but the only thing we had was
5586240	5588640	that tease that Jared Leto was somehow involved.
5588680	5589360	Yay.
5594040	5595400	Excuse me while I go.
5597080	5599240	Why can't we just get a sequel to the last movie?
5599240	5601840	Why, why would that be such a hard thing to do?
5602160	5606760	And it definitely needs a Cillian Anderson in it as, um, cause he's a
5606760	5610240	Derringer's kid and I'm sorry.
5610280	5612240	Murphy's pretty Cillian Murphy.
5612560	5617560	Why I say Murphy, but anyway, he's Jillian Anderson could absolutely be in Tron.
5617560	5620040	If she wanted to be, I meant Cillian Murphy.
5620080	5621320	Yeah, excuse me.
5621480	5626080	I, but, but he's so pretty and I want him to be, um, Derringer.
5626560	5630000	Like takeover, like with an MCP and everything, not like a complete
5630040	5633640	rehash of the first movie, but I would fucking love to see them do something.
5634440	5636840	All right, let's move on from Disney chat.
5636880	5639360	Although I knew it would come up at some point, but there was just, there was a
5639360	5642320	lot of stuff that came out there and I saw the discord blown up with all that
5642320	5644560	too over at vog network.com slash discord.
5644760	5646560	Some of you guys like to share articles throughout the week.
5647240	5650800	Rob, you know what we just need to do is just take a quick, you know, hiatus
5650840	5654920	during the halfway of the show, take an intermission run to Del Taco and get
5654920	5659800	some churros and run back churro chat on orange laundry, churro chat.
5660120	5663640	All right, moving on serious stuff though.
5663680	5668400	Uh, Twitch chat, we've got a couple of stories about Twitch and, um, one,
5668440	5671120	one, I think is generally good news.
5671120	5672680	The other one really not good news.
5672680	5674280	And we'll start with the not good news, right?
5674280	5674560	Logie.
5675520	5676000	Yeah.
5676040	5684000	So right now, um, the, uh, U S government has to pass a spending bill basically
5684000	5687160	to approve the spending for, uh, next year.
5687240	5693720	And with that, what is something that's been happened in the past is that they
5693720	5701320	try to sneak in different, um, measures just that might not be able to pass on
5701320	5705120	their own, but then also might be something that they may not just
5705120	5708920	necessarily vehemently disagree with just to try to get it passed.
5709440	5713800	And that's what we have Republican Senator Thom Tillis doing with a
5713800	5718440	proposal that would turn unauthorized commercial streaming of copyright
5718440	5724640	music, um, into like, for example, an album on YouTube video clip on Twitch
5724640	5730480	or song and Instagram story into a felony offense with possible prison sentence.
5731800	5738040	Uh, apparently, you know, this obviously is not a good thing and it should be of
5738080	5743800	no surprise that Tillis is also being funded by PACS that are, um, have
5743800	5751040	donations with ties to the MPAA, uh, the Sony pictures, universal music group,
5751040	5756560	Comcast, NBC universal, um, the internet and television associations,
5756560	5758400	Salem media group and Warner music.
5758760	5763000	So basically in the pocket of all of those media companies and trying to
5763160	5769680	pass something that would try to basically end all fair use of, you know,
5769680	5773360	copyrighted material, uh, it's a really dangerous thing.
5773360	5778160	And so of course, you know, there has been several folks that have spoken out
5778160	5785000	against it, the EFF and internet archive, uh, the American liberal library
5785000	5790120	association center for democracy and technology collective, um, have all
5790120	5795560	sent letters to the Senate last week as well, but I mean, right now they
5795560	5803120	have kind of a, uh, interim bill that's passed to extend it out to the 18th
5803160	5807520	of December, but they are going to be voting on this pretty soon.
5807520	5811200	So that it's kind of scary that this is not the first time that they've tried
5811200	5812600	to slip something like this in.
5812600	5814600	I think he's done it in the past before.
5815120	5816680	Just, I don't know.
5816720	5819720	I don't understand why this is a thing in our government, how they can just
5819880	5822120	suddenly slap on other bills to existing bills.
5822120	5823120	It's really ridiculous.
5823120	5823320	Yeah.
5823320	5824960	I don't think it should be like that either.
5825080	5830680	Um, but, uh, yeah, I, obviously all of us are sitting here going, this is bad, bad
5830680	5831040	news.
5831280	5836400	Like, I, I understand if, you know, somebody is like filming a movie in a
5836400	5839840	theater with the intention of trying to distribute that on YouTube, you know, the
5839840	5841960	very, very blatant kind of piracy.
5842200	5846480	I can, I kind of understand where maybe they want to, I mean, but I don't know,
5846480	5847920	a felony for God's sake.
5847920	5853360	Like, I don't, I, I, it's, yeah, it's not like, yeah, the, the copyright law needs
5853360	5857440	reform, but this is way too much because it's, it's going to get ugly.
5857640	5860600	It's going to get ugly for things like Twitch, you know, like we, I think it
5860600	5862680	needs reform in the other direction.
5862680	5865200	I think they've gotten away with way too much as it is.
5865400	5870160	And basically, you know, Disney being a big proponent of that, just like really
5870480	5874880	the abuse, what we really need to do is get money out of politics, but that's not
5874880	5876280	going to be a thing for awhile.
5876320	5880040	I mean, that's the problem is you have these people that are basically bought
5880040	5885120	and paid for politicians that are voting on stuff that only benefits, you know,
5885120	5888880	these large companies as if they don't make enough money from their stuff.
5888880	5893960	I really don't, they've always been argued or, you know, piracy's hurting
5893960	5896480	their business, but like, it's just because they don't want to adapt to
5896480	5897800	new business models.
5898200	5903840	Um, I just honestly don't think that like a lot of stuff is really hurt that much
5903840	5906200	by, I mean, these guys are making tons of money.
5906520	5910320	A record profits each year, but it's not enough.
5910320	5911320	They need all of the money.
5911720	5911920	Yeah.
5911960	5916400	It's like with any though, if you think about it, like a physical store, you
5916400	5921480	know, every physical store has a loss prevention group, but they still factor
5921480	5926160	in a certain amount of losses from theft.
5927440	5934680	And I think that they need to, I'm trying to think of how I want to phrase
5934680	5942080	this because also as an artist myself, I do, I've had my work stolen before,
5942720	5949840	you know, and I think that the copyright laws need to be stronger to protect
5950640	5956480	the, the artists, the, that aren't sponsored by some big company.
5957200	5962440	They need to be more stringent for art stolen from the, uh, the independent
5962440	5966880	user, and I think not so much for the company, they need to get rid of the
5966880	5970280	whole corporations as people things so that it doesn't apply in the same manner.
5970440	5971080	Does that make sense?
5971120	5973040	You, you, I do agree.
5973040	5976800	You need to have the ability, like when, when somebody like a, one of these, you
5976800	5981360	know, websites that sits out there that does a lot of Facebook ads, steals a
5981360	5984280	design that you made, and we hear about this type of stuff on social media all
5984280	5988400	the time, you need to have a legal way to go after that company that does not
5988400	5991800	require you to have a super expensive lawyer and all this stuff and things that
5991840	5993280	the normal person can't afford.
5993480	5994200	Absolutely.
5994200	5996920	And that's part of what the copyright law needs to look at.
5996920	6001760	But like a felony, like, I mean, it would, I guess it would depend on the
6001760	6002360	circumstance.
6002360	6003040	That's the problem.
6003240	6006640	And I think what's, what's like, if you have a particular company that's doing
6006640	6010520	this over and over and over again, and that's their whole MO, then maybe I kind
6010520	6010960	of get it.
6011000	6018560	Um, but like, I, I feel like the language in this is too broad and it's gonna get
6018560	6020600	used not the right way.
6020640	6021160	That's the,
6021200	6025840	that's why they leave it so broad is so that they can have it be interpreted in
6025840	6029800	court a different way at a later time when it eventually does come to it.
6029800	6030800	I mean, they bank on this.
6031040	6031320	Yeah.
6031880	6043120	So I, I, I just have very little respect I think for, well, especially, you know,
6043120	6047280	just given the whole state of the Republican party anyway, I look at
6047280	6052200	anything that, honestly, I could look at any type of legislation that's announced
6052200	6058600	by practically anybody right now in, uh, in Congress with a high suspicion, just
6058600	6063120	about there's a few people who I would probably trust on site, but I would still
6063120	6063880	want to look it over.
6065520	6065960	All right.
6066480	6070920	Well, let's move on to something a little more, I think, um, positive for possible
6070920	6071960	Twitch future news.
6072280	6076760	Uh, and, uh, well, I mean, it's not a positive topic, but it is Twitch taking
6076760	6079960	action on something they've been asked to take action on for quite some time.
6080280	6084760	And that is a new policy on hateful conduct and harassment was finally rolled
6084760	6088800	out, uh, this past week, and it will be going into effect on January 22nd.
6089080	6092080	Um, and you might be wondering like, why not now?
6092120	6097920	Um, they did the delay to give streamers and audience members time to be ready for
6097920	6100960	it and basically either adjust their behavior appropriately.
6100960	6103120	I'm assuming provide feedback and so forth.
6103360	6105720	Um, but that's why there's a little bit of a gap there.
6106120	6110760	Um, so, uh, I'm going to try to summarize some of these things happening here.
6110760	6114280	And I think these, these are all things where I'm like, wow, this wasn't there
6114280	6114880	before.
6115240	6116240	I'm glad it's there.
6116480	6120880	Um, Twitch is adding three protected identity characteristics to their list of
6120880	6124760	hateful conduct, caste, color, and immigration status.
6124920	6129040	So if you attack someone based on one of these traits, which other traits that are
6129040	6134000	there already include sex, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, racism, so
6134000	6135000	they're adding these things to it.
6135000	6138840	But if you attack somebody on one of these basis, you basically are risking
6138840	6139640	punishment for that.
6140200	6145600	Um, one that's been getting a lot of like, Oh, interesting kind of reactions is that
6145880	6150080	the Confederate flag is now on Twitch's list of hate symbols and it is banned from
6150080	6150600	streams.
6150920	6156040	Uh, and quote, it is fucking hateful and I'm a southerner quote, given its historic
6156040	6160680	and symbolic association with slavery and white supremacist groups in the U S uh, and
6160720	6166600	also they are, uh, explicitly saying hate groups and propaganda are prohibited as
6166600	6167000	well.
6167280	6173480	Emotes also fall into this policy, so you may not have some type of, um, I don't
6173480	6178520	know, white supremacist sign or whatever code, coded thing in a emote that is
6178520	6179400	against the rules.
6179800	6184960	Other specific behavior, um, claiming the victim of a well-documented tragedy is a
6185040	6192800	crisis actor, encouraging others to docs, hack, SWAT or DDoS somebody and inciting
6192800	6196240	malicious raids of another person's social media profiles.
6196240	6198840	Again, that's all stuff I think that needs to be there.
6199400	6202840	Um, so there's, there's, there's a lot of things here.
6202880	6208120	Um, sexual harassment is now, uh, they are adopting a much lower tolerance for
6208120	6213360	objectifying or harassing behavior specifically repeatedly commenting on
6213360	6217640	someone's attractiveness when they've indicated their discomfort verbally or
6217640	6219640	through timeouts and channel bands.
6219920	6224800	So if you're continuing to say, you know, Loki, you're looking mighty fine in that
6224800	6225720	sweater today.
6225800	6226600	Well, thank you.
6226640	6229120	Well, see, now if you say that, then I'm not going against that.
6229120	6232320	But if you're like, um, you don't need to comment on those things.
6232320	6233440	I wish you wouldn't comment on that.
6233640	6237320	Then if I were to take that for further and continue that, and I don't, I could
6237320	6239400	keep going with the example, but I want to make light of it because it's a very
6239400	6240160	serious situation.
6240520	6241920	Um, it fucking is.
6241960	6242920	Yeah, I'll tell you what.
6242920	6245040	I just ended up being blunt about it to begin with.
6245080	6246840	I'm like, don't say that to me.
6247000	6247200	Yeah.
6247480	6248960	But I'm just finally like that.
6248960	6249720	Don't tell me that.
6250040	6254240	If somebody ignores that and continues with that, they are now in violation of the
6254240	6254720	policy.
6255080	6256840	So that's, yeah, that's good.
6256960	6258920	You know, I'm not going to be fucking polite about it.
6259160	6263520	Um, and if you make explicit comments about someone's sexuality or physical
6263520	6268080	appearance, even if they're a public figure, it's interesting and sharing
6268080	6271480	unsolicited nude images or videos again, I should hope not Christ.
6271880	6278520	Um, so, um, yeah, that's, that's great because I can't tell you how many LGBTQ
6278520	6279480	streamers I see.
6279920	6283560	Um, or, you know, folks are streaming and people go into the streams.
6283560	6286320	They're like, LOL, you're gay.
6287040	6289920	And it's like, yeah, why, why?
6289920	6290520	Yes.
6290680	6292160	Random person on the internet.
6292640	6294360	I am, I am gay.
6295000	6296160	Um, thanks.
6296200	6298240	You know, it's like stupid crap like that.
6298880	6303360	Finally, uh, as part of the statement, I know I'm, I'm reading a lot here, but this
6303360	6304160	is important shit.
6304480	6306400	Uh, Twitch continued in their statement.
6306680	6311680	We know that many people on Twitch, particularly women, members of the LGBTQIA
6311680	6315400	community, black, indigenous, and people of color, unfortunately continue to
6315400	6319400	experience a disproportionate amount of harassment and abuse online, including on
6319400	6319960	our service.
6320240	6324440	Not only is this blatantly unacceptable, it also undermines the community we're
6324440	6327880	building on Twitch and threatens the long-term viability of streaming as a
6327880	6330520	career for everyone who wishes to pursue it.
6330800	6337400	So I think a lot is to be determined in the enforcement of said guidelines.
6337400	6341840	And if we actually see Twitch kind of put in their oomph where their mouth is with
6341840	6347400	this, but in the interim, as I did earlier, I shall award one polite clap for
6347400	6348040	this update.
6349080	6355760	And we will see, uh, I will, uh, uh, award more applause later if they actually,
6355800	6361520	uh, put their, uh, enforcement where their mouth is with this and, uh, help to,
6361640	6365160	with some of the toxicity on the Twitch environment.
6365840	6367920	So, all right.
6369120	6378040	Anyhow, um, black compat in chat says the N Bomb folks finally died down on our
6378040	6379600	stream over the last few weeks.
6379600	6380480	Thank the Lord.
6380480	6384120	See, that's how, it just like, it makes me angry.
6384160	6390000	Like I just, I want to, when I hear that, because I respect you guys so much, and I
6390000	6393640	know you guys work so hard, like I want to know who those people are and I want to
6393640	6394440	beat them up.
6394480	6395280	Like I do.
6395560	6401800	So like, but the, the best I can do on this, this Twitch platform is get the hell
6401800	6402840	off my platform.
6403200	6407920	If you're one of these people that go into streams and type that type of garbage,
6407920	6413720	like it's just completely, we know, we know it's kids.
6413800	6417320	Like 90% of the time, it's kids trying to get a rise out of somebody trying to get a
6417320	6419640	reaction and it's fucking gross and disgusting.
6420520	6424800	Seriously, if only Twitch had the authority to spank these children.
6425120	6432320	Or more like if they had been raised to be respectful, then they wouldn't even need
6432320	6434000	the supervision to not do that.
6435200	6438720	You know, it's clearly a moral failing, I would say.
6439080	6442640	And yes, pod culture, I did mean fuck them with a cheese grater dildo.
6444120	6444840	At least the adults.
6445480	6451000	Um, uh, no one special 77 says in short, don't be a creepy asshole on the internet.
6451000	6451240	Yes.
6451400	6454560	And, and you guys that are watching and viewing, we've been very fortunate that
6454560	6456320	our community is pretty fucking awesome.
6456720	6459120	You, you all know how to conduct yourselves.
6459160	6461160	We don't have problems in the chat room.
6461360	6466320	Whenever we do have problems in chat, our mods take care of it quick, you know, and
6466320	6468040	that, and it's, you know, that's the thing.
6468040	6474080	But also like, and Rob, we're, we're so far, the problematic people in themselves
6474080	6480400	out to what's that you, you cut out so far, the problematic people have thrown
6480400	6482320	themselves out to, that is true too.
6482320	6484600	And let's be real dark soccer.
6485800	6488520	We are three white people sitting here doing this stream.
6488720	6491640	We are not using the LGBT cat tag.
6491680	6493600	So it is not obvious that I am gay.
6493600	6496320	The two out of three of us qualify.
6496320	6499120	It is not, it, that is not something that's there.
6499320	6503000	So that's, you know, that's the reality.
6503040	6511520	Like, so I'm glad at least Twitch is going to these, um, uh, uh, methods
6511520	6515520	to basically ban this for like the, this kind of behavior is unacceptable.
6515840	6518560	Across the board and that they're, you know, they're calling out that there
6518560	6523080	is a problem because there is, you know, nobody's come into this chat.
6523280	6528080	Saying those type of words, especially the one that starts with N.
6528720	6534280	And so I, I think it's, it's just disgusting that it's happening to, um,
6535280	6538120	two people that love the games industry that I respect so much.
6538920	6542320	I got you, I got your back and I will fight those people if I ever see them.
6543080	6547640	And we can cuss like a fucking sailor, but that has nothing
6547640	6549640	to do with being hateful.
6549760	6550120	Yeah.
6550520	6550840	Yes.
6550880	6552800	I can say, fuck you with a cheese grater.
6552880	6553360	Yes.
6553880	6557120	But I'm not going to say, fuck you with a cheese grater, insert slur here.
6557200	6561880	But yeah, and you're not necessarily directing it at a certain individual.
6561880	6566320	You're not going like, fuck you Rob Roberts, but you're not
6566320	6567240	saying it here on the show.
6567280	6567600	All right.
6567640	6569120	Anyway, no, no.
6569280	6569640	All right.
6569920	6570520	Let's move on.
6570560	6576480	I'm, I'm a good girl in public, so Rob, it's a good time next.
6576520	6577040	Yes.
6577080	6581120	Let's, Ooh, let's, uh, let's move on to happier times.
6581120	6585840	We love games and let's talk about, uh, the classic game of the week.
6585880	6589840	And we're going to take a trip down memory lane and, uh, we're going to,
6589840	6593160	uh, have dark soccer, get into the gaming vault and she's going to find
6593160	6598440	a game that she thinks, Hey, you kids, you should be playing this game this week.
6598520	6599680	Uh, it's, it's a classic.
6599680	6600160	Maybe.
6601120	6603240	Well, I don't, maybe this one, I don't know.
6603360	6606720	I think you, the game you picked tonight, you literally can't play.
6606800	6609600	Uh, well you kind of can, but not the way it was, but anyway.
6610000	6613200	Um, I will say a reminder for an important reason.
6613320	6617480	I know I was gonna say a reminder because I think it ties into this, uh, to qualify
6617480	6621280	as a classic game of the week, it usually, unless dark soccer feels like bending
6621280	6625800	the rules, which is very rarely a classic game of the week is 10 years or older.
6626320	6630320	And so the rules once, and that was for halo to pay my mom's bills.
6631040	6631600	No, no.
6631600	6633280	Cause halo was over 10 years older than halo.
6633320	6637480	The halo was my rule of do not do halo had it.
6637600	6638840	It was the halo clause.
6639120	6639520	Yes.
6639560	6639880	Okay.
6639880	6640280	Fair enough.
6640680	6640880	All right.
6640880	6642080	So dark soccer, let's get to it.
6642080	6643200	What is the classic game of the week?
6644360	6645680	World of Warcraft cataclysm.
6646680	6647080	Wow.
6647080	6651000	I'll tell you, I've done world of Warcraft before, but I'm doing cataclysm
6651440	6657280	because it, as an expansion, it was a complete fucking do over for world of
6657280	6657880	Warcraft.
6658200	6663040	And we just had a new story earlier about how the Warcraft expansion for shadow lands
6663040	6666440	was considered the best selling selling PC game for about four days.
6666640	6669160	So it does, they do qualify as separate games.
6669200	6672600	Um, you know, there's, there's another reason I'm bringing this up too.
6672600	6677320	Cause you remember every, I played the first iteration of world of Warcraft,
6677520	6679720	hated it, played the second one.
6679720	6680800	It was okay.
6681200	6687560	I played, it was basically, it wasn't until cataclysm came out that I enjoyed
6687720	6692360	world of Warcraft and you remember my little goat girl who I still have.
6693360	6697960	I, I, so I basically soloed her to 80.
6699320	6704560	I didn't do a single, um, uh, dungeon or anything.
6704560	6708640	I didn't do a single instance until after I level captor.
6710680	6713320	And I think only one time did I ever party.
6713320	6717800	And it was cause one thing in that grand that I couldn't beat by myself and I want
6717800	6719800	to say that it was you and spike.
6720800	6722680	Probably that sounds, sounds, sounds about right.
6722680	6722840	Yeah.
6723720	6729160	Um, uh, the days of danger squad, but anyway, um, world of Warcraft was the
6729160	6733040	third expansion that came out for world of Warcraft, it followed wrath of the
6733040	6733600	Lich King.
6734080	6738600	Um, it had its announcement at Blizzcon on August 21st, 2009.
6739160	6744000	Um, although of course hackers going to hack and people figured shit out and it's
6744040	6747320	a release date was on December 7th, 2010.
6747680	6753960	So I am basically a just short of a week off of the release date to date.
6754280	6761000	So, um, yeah, I kind of hit the line on that one, but at any rate, there was so
6761000	6763400	much shit, by the way, I meant 85 and not 80.
6763680	6768440	So there was a lot of change that happened with this one.
6768440	6776360	So not only did they raise the player level cap to 85, but they completely redid
6776360	6779960	the two main continents because prior to cataclysm, you could not fly.
6780200	6780680	Remember?
6781320	6781720	Oh yeah.
6781800	6782120	Yeah.
6782280	6784360	Not, not in the original world.
6785040	6787760	You said you had like certain flying capable levels.
6787760	6788480	I think it was.
6788480	6792000	And of course you had, you know, your, your travel points like that.
6792440	6801400	Um, but not only, um, did this, uh, create flying areas, uh, basically I think the
6801400	6811360	only areas that were not flyable were the two, um, uh, uh, the blood elf starting
6811360	6820280	area and the draenei, because those were stored, um, like off the main map, which
6820280	6822600	is funny because those two are actually stored on the same map.
6822600	6823040	Did you know?
6824120	6827520	I, I thought I had heard that back in the day, but I forgot.
6828080	6832800	If you, if you boundary break it, you can travel, um, like you fly
6832800	6836480	for a fucking long ass time, but then you end up on the other map.
6836480	6837280	You can actually see them.
6838080	6842920	Um, but any rate, um, it added 10 new dungeons and five new
6842920	6845200	raids and a new skill archeology.
6845680	6848920	I think I always did jewelcrafting cause it like gave me a lot of money.
6849320	6849800	Um, they did.
6849800	6850960	I'm going to step away for a minute.
6850960	6852080	So don't ask me any other questions.
6852120	6853120	Okay, fine.
6853520	6857880	Um, but they did, um, redo the glyph system to have three types of glyphs,
6857880	6860000	which were prime major and minor.
6860480	6862920	And they were permanently learned instead of having to have
6862920	6864720	a reagent to remove the slot.
6865280	6871040	Um, they added two playable races, the worgen, werewolf, werewolf people, uh,
6871080	6873480	for the Alliance and goblins for the horde.
6873640	6877320	I had a goblin named Gabrielle and I actually still have her.
6877320	6878520	If I decided to play again.
6879160	6883880	Um, they did expand some of the classes to be available to more of the races
6884280	6889560	and they completely redid, well, they mostly redid Stormwind and really redid,
6889560	6892960	I think Orgrimmar, even though I fucking hate Orgrimmar cause that place is like
6892960	6897800	a fucking maze, um, and then they overhauled the talent system so that you
6897800	6902960	were awarded your first talent point at 10 and then 11 and then once, uh, per
6902960	6905480	every two levels until you reach 80.
6905960	6910440	And, uh, 81 through 85, you receive a talent point at each level, bringing
6910440	6915440	your total to 41 talent points and lets you choose, um, new and
6915440	6917560	different or improved abilities.
6918320	6924680	Um, and to go ahead and answer you evil protagonist, I am specifically
6924680	6929280	referring to this expansion because it pretty much revamped the whole game.
6929280	6933120	I can almost look at this as a whole separate game with all
6933120	6934160	the changes that they made to it.
6934720	6940320	Um, other, um, so basically the big thing with this game is that Deathwing, the
6940320	6945400	Destroyer, the evil, uh, dragon thing who was originally Maltharion, the
6945400	6949280	earthwarder, um, of the, the, the five, sorry.
6949400	6949640	Yeah.
6949920	6955680	Five, five aspects, um, were, uh, he went crazy and started burning shit,
6956320	6957840	really just started burning shit.
6958480	6964080	Um, and he was last seen in Warcraft two.
6965080	6970840	Um, so basically he just was wondering around, he literally was wandering around
6970840	6972720	the continents, setting shit on fire.
6973520	6976800	Um, and he tore through this dimensional barrier.
6976800	6980800	So there was this huge cataclysm that reshaped everything.
6981560	6985000	Like, uh, there were the Twilight hammer group coming up.
6985000	6990040	There's all kinds of just amazing lore stuff that came into the universe.
6990480	6993760	And then of course it changed a lot of things in the
6993760	6996280	politics of the various factions.
6996800	7000240	Um, so Thrall who was, you know, uh, fucking love Thrall.
7000240	7002600	He was so cool as warchief, but anyway, he stepped down.
7003120	7010880	Um, and this gave us, uh, Garrosh Hellscream who I hated him and, uh, I, I
7010880	7014560	hated him forever and I hated him when he died in the books, cause I actually
7014560	7018160	have the, the trial and everything and I hated him and everything else.
7018640	7023280	And he's like one of my favorite characters to hate, I swear.
7023800	7032400	Um, but anyway, um, we also had, um, the Zandalari, uh, trolls, uh, come back.
7032440	7034120	They were really, really cool.
7034160	7040640	Um, we had the Firelands, which I remember how fucking long we were working through
7040640	7044360	the damn Firelands as our, uh, as our Guild.
7044480	7046720	I mean, I got all kinds of screen caps and everything.
7046720	7048680	That was the most fun I've had in that game.
7049200	7055320	And then, um, they did, uh, the hour of Twilight, um, where one of, it
7055320	7057640	was really such a good raid too.
7057640	7065840	I love doing that where, um, your last battle is on Deathwing's back and you
7065840	7067760	had to really know your shit for this one.
7067760	7069480	It was really a lot of fun.
7069520	7076600	Um, I mean, honestly, that one and, um, the, uh, crap.
7076600	7077320	Now I can't remember.
7077320	7080040	And I also, the one that brought in, uh, demon hunters, cause I played
7080040	7081080	the shit out of that one too.
7081360	7082360	Legion, I'm back.
7083320	7083760	Legion.
7083760	7084000	Yeah.
7084400	7087200	Those two have been my favorite expansions ever.
7087440	7092160	Rise of Pandaria was, eh, but these, the other two were great.
7092160	7095040	I, and I'll tell you what, I tried to play the Void Elf one and
7095040	7096120	fucking, I couldn't get into it.
7096120	7099600	So that was probably the last time I played World of Warcraft.
7100160	7104520	Um, but any rate, um, there was a big environmental change to it as well,
7104520	7111480	because you had an event that was quite literally scarring the, uh, the world
7112080	7118080	that, um, they, uh, they actually started, uh, what was they split?
7118120	7119040	Um, crap.
7119040	7120320	Why can't I think of it now?
7120320	7121120	The barons.
7121160	7121480	Yeah.
7121560	7122400	They split the barons.
7122960	7126560	And for anyone who ever played in vanilla, wow.
7127560	7130760	Barons chat was special.
7131240	7132160	Something else.
7133160	7137080	It was eventually the, cause you're stuck in the barons for like what?
7137080	7138000	40 levels.
7138240	7142240	Not quite that long, but a while, 30, 25, 30 levels.
7142280	7142680	Yeah.
7143360	7147800	And it's some of the slowest levels to go through as well.
7148320	7154880	Um, so this effectively put an end to the, uh, quagmire that was barons chat,
7155240	7157800	because then they split it into the two different sides of it.
7158200	7159880	Um, and Mary, the two shall meet.
7160160	7162800	And just to quickly kind of like address, like, cause a conversation is
7162800	7166920	kind of going on in chat about, you know, this particular expansion
7166920	7168800	being a classic game of the week.
7168800	7172600	I think it's important, you know, to, to note some of the things that World of
7172600	7177600	Warcraft, World of Warcraft Cataclysm did, um, it was really the first MMO
7177600	7181640	expansion, or at least the biggest that I can think of that was really intent
7181640	7187600	on redoing an old world so that you really couldn't revisit the old world
7187640	7192440	in its old form, at least until, you know, wow, classic came out way
7192440	7193920	later, many years later, right?
7194120	7198240	So, um, you know, and some people may point to Final Fantasy 14, but that,
7198240	7200280	that redo didn't happen until a couple of years later.
7200280	7205600	And actually, uh, now Kiyoshita said, uh, when he approached Realm Reborn,
7205600	7209200	he was influenced by World of Warcraft Cataclysm and him and his team played
7209440	7212880	quite a bit of it, um, in just, you know, to get, to get a sense of what's
7212880	7213880	going on in MMOs.
7213880	7217680	And I think a lot of what you see in Realm Reborn kind of comes from World
7217680	7222160	of Warcraft and, you know, part of that, the story certainly seems to have some
7222160	7224800	heavy, uh, parallels with World of Warcraft Cataclysm.
7224800	7227160	So I think, I think that's part of the reason why, you know, this
7227160	7229000	particular expansion is notable.
7230760	7233280	Well, there's, there's still a little bit more, um, you know, like I was
7233280	7237080	saying, flight is unavailable for the Burning Crusade levels, but, um, there
7237080	7239120	were some other big things about this.
7239200	7242160	Um, and I, I did find that leveling was so much better.
7242160	7245560	God, the thing that I hated the most from the old one in the leveling
7245560	7248720	mechanics for having to level your individual weapons or your skills in each
7248720	7253920	of those, I was so fucking glad when that went away, um, because to me, it
7253920	7259680	made the game more of a grind and less fun and the stories were fun.
7259680	7261600	The new quests were freaking hilarious.
7261600	7268560	Some of them were, um, and then you also had, um, uh, some better PVP, I think.
7268720	7274880	So you had your PVP zones that, um, you could, uh, you know, participate
7274880	7276640	in your various PVP activities.
7276640	7280040	But if you didn't want to, you just, you actually, there's a fairly easy
7280040	7281240	way to steer clear of them.
7281720	7285440	Um, as long as you stuck to navigating your flight paths, you know?
7286400	7292960	Um, and yes, uh, Baron's, I think Baron's chat did revive a bit in classic.
7292960	7293920	Rob, you were playing that?
7293960	7295560	I was, but I was Alliance.
7295600	7298360	So I didn't see the Baron's chat when I played classic.
7298400	7302360	Um, so I couldn't tell you, I would assume it's probably still there, but
7302360	7306320	it's, it's probably one of those like, LOL, we're in Baron's chat kind of
7306320	7309200	things where it's the, the meme is self-aware now.
7309480	7309960	Yeah.
7310040	7313600	So I'm not sure it's going to be quite the same as it was before.
7313600	7317080	You probably still have your occasional Chuck Norris joke, but I think it's one
7317080	7321280	of those, the meme has become aware of itself and so just by nature, it's not
7321280	7321840	what it was.
7322480	7326720	But do you remember how fucking long it took me to get, to get stood in the fire?
7328520	7330240	So there's a story about this.
7331040	7333400	So, okay.
7333440	7336320	Remember how I said Deathwing was flying around burning shit, right?
7336960	7342200	He would set the entire instanced area that you were in completely on fire.
7342200	7343680	Oh yeah, I remember that.
7344040	7350720	And three times I was in an area that got set on fire and did not die.
7352800	7353680	And I don't know why.
7353680	7357600	I think one of them was because I had just revived from an earlier death.
7358400	7361880	And the other two, I think had to do like just where I was standing.
7361880	7364040	It was the dumbest thing ever.
7364280	7367000	And you remember how angry I was, right?
7367040	7369680	I'd be like, I'm in fire and I'm not on fire.
7370280	7370560	Right?
7370600	7375720	Like, and I would just go around, like just wandering around the entire world
7375720	7378240	looking for fucking Deathwing so I could get stood in the fire.
7378760	7380680	And then I don't even know what it was.
7380680	7382040	I was like in...
7382080	7384000	When you're not expecting it, it just happens.
7384000	7385040	Cheese ball thing.
7385080	7385400	Yeah.
7385400	7386960	I was, I was, I was mining.
7387000	7387600	That was it.
7387920	7388640	Stood in the fire.
7390480	7392240	And then someone got the thing I was trying to mine for.
7394320	7394800	I got it.
7395160	7398920	I got, I have screenshots to this day of my stood in the fire.
7399400	7402200	Uh, can I tell you one other little side story that, uh, your
7402200	7403640	pick this week made me think of?
7404320	7407480	Um, so the fact that this game is, uh, 10 years old, right?
7407480	7409920	Cause it came out about, uh, just about 10 years ago this week, give
7409920	7411800	or take a week or two, a week or two.
7411800	7412200	It did.
7412440	7412680	Oh yeah.
7412680	7414360	It came out on the 7th of December.
7414400	7415120	Oh, well, there you go.
7415400	7421400	So, um, uh, Horde House, the side project I was doing, uh, at the beginning with
7421400	7426000	Xtaphir and then we added more, uh, cast members later on, Shane and, uh, grandpa
7426000	7428400	for, or, uh, you know, captain Matt from Starboard Power Coupling.
7428720	7431120	Uh, we're all part of the, uh, Horde House.
7431400	7436640	That show started, uh, about six weeks before the Cataclysm patch.
7436640	7437480	No, yeah.
7437480	7439120	Six weeks before the expansion ish.
7439120	7441520	I don't remember the exact day, but I remember it was right at the end of
7441520	7444440	Lich King, because I think in like episode four, we were talking about how
7444440	7445880	we finally killed the Lich King.
7446040	7449120	Thanks to the Cataclysm pre patch and the changes that it had made.
7449480	7455120	Um, so it's just, so, so now Horde House qualifies as a classic podcast of the week.
7455520	7461280	Uh, it just kind of made me stop and pause and go, Oh my gosh, that show is 10 years old.
7461560	7465840	And we did that show for a good, probably like four years.
7465880	7466400	I don't know.
7466400	7466960	I don't remember.
7466960	7472360	Maybe three, four years until we honestly, truly, we all kind of, well,
7472360	7474040	most of us burned out on Warcraft.
7474040	7476080	I think grandpa stuck with it the longest.
7476480	7479120	Uh, and then, uh, Final Fantasy Realm Reborn came out.
7479120	7483600	And so we tried for a good, probably the last 20 episodes or so.
7483640	7488960	We really tried to make it about like all MMOs, but then at that point, the
7488960	7492600	show was just completely losing focus and, and would be the tangent train.
7492600	7495040	And I think everybody kind of burned out sadly.
7495040	7497240	And that, that's the story of, of Horde House.
7497560	7504040	Um, but it was a fun show brings up Leroy Jenkins, which, you know, you cannot
7504040	7505920	get the Jenkins achievement anymore.
7506080	7506760	Not anymore.
7506880	7507480	Not anymore.
7507520	7507800	Nope.
7508240	7509600	I have the Jenkins achievement.
7509760	7510360	I'm happy.
7510680	7513480	I think like I got it on my demon hunter too.
7513480	7515440	Cause they took that out right after Legion.
7515440	7515920	Didn't they?
7516240	7516560	Yeah.
7517160	7517440	Yeah.
7517760	7522600	Um, but you know, one of the cool things though about Cataclysm is that afterwards
7522600	7527400	it really did bring out now people who like to boundary break and, you know, I
7527400	7528240	loved a boundary break.
7528280	7530680	Like I did the non-instant Stratholme.
7531720	7535480	I did, uh, I got to that little hidden part just north of Stratholme.
7535480	7540320	Remember that had like the tower and like the place to sit and no, because it
7540320	7541720	was blocked off for some reason.
7542360	7542880	Yeah.
7542880	7545920	And then, uh, and then I did a boundary.
7545920	7551840	I would go do boundary breaks in, uh, old, uh, an old dungeons, but they, I think
7551840	7553960	now they have them like level matched or something.
7554600	7562080	And then, um, I did, uh, I spent like two hours outside of the, the boundary
7562080	7565840	area for end of time, you know, when you're kind of in that big crater trying
7565840	7569400	to fight, uh, the, who was the time dragon?
7571200	7571560	Chromie?
7571560	7571960	I forget.
7573520	7575800	No, not Chrome, not Chromie, uh, the other one.
7576800	7577760	Chromie worked for him.
7577800	7579240	The one who was the, actually the.
7581000	7584920	I don't remember off the top of my head and all the Warcraft, listen to the show
7584920	7588760	or the hourglass one that was so fucking annoying.
7590360	7591680	Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
7591680	7591960	Yeah.
7592040	7593040	I remember that boss.
7593040	7593280	Yeah.
7594160	7598780	But anyway, and also that expansion gave me my favorite ever fight with the two
7598780	7600820	dragons with the fabulous flames.
7600860	7601460	Oh yeah.
7601460	7602180	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7602860	7607220	That was my favorite fight ever in an MMO.
7607380	7609180	I, to this day, it's my favorite.
7610060	7613300	Um, but at any rate, going back to the game itself, instead of, you
7613300	7614940	know, waxing nostalgic here.
7615460	7619460	Um, it was highly lauded.
7619540	7626700	It, it was, um, it was rated, I think 90 on Metacritic.
7627220	7635660	Um, nine out of 10 on IGM, uh, uh, a critic score of 9.1 out of 10 for GameSpot.
7635700	7641900	I mean, it just, it got so many positive reviews and they were well deserved.
7641900	7644420	It was a really well put together game.
7644940	7648620	I mean, and I've played, you know, a few MMOs in my time.
7648620	7651780	I mean, you know how addicted I was to Ragnarok online for like ever.
7652420	7660420	Um, World of Warcraft, this expansion, the Cataclysm expansion completely
7660460	7664220	breathed the new life into the game.
7664220	7672300	And I would say even into the MMO genre in general, like the fantasy RPG
7672300	7679740	style MMO like this, that it, that the entire thing needed while I'm like,
7679980	7681500	okay, I'm not going to go back to World of Warcraft.
7681540	7683740	I'm done with World of Warcraft and I am done with it.
7684100	7684340	Yeah.
7684500	7691300	I still think that it was one of the biggest things that expanded
7691700	7698020	my love of, of games, because this brought me into playing more
7698020	7700220	adventure games of this variety.
7700620	7703700	I'm not an MMO person that much anymore, although I am planning
7703700	7705580	on going back to, to PSO too.
7705580	7710780	I actually quit Final Fantasy 14 without even touching my sub.
7711860	7714220	After two months of paying for it.
7714380	7715020	Oh yeah.
7715020	7715300	Yeah.
7715340	7716860	That means I'm probably not going to go back to it.
7717020	7717300	Yeah.
7717580	7719460	Um, that that's, you know, 24 bucks.
7719460	7720780	I can't get back or 28 bucks.
7720780	7721460	I can't get back.
7721740	7726180	PSO too has that other, the, the big graphic kind of, kind of a
7726180	7727500	cataclysm of its own coming up.
7727500	7730540	I think it's a, a side game, but it's going to have the enhanced
7730540	7731180	graphics and everything.
7731180	7731940	It looks really exciting.
7731940	7737020	So at least with PSO too, it's a play through your, your cycle and you can be done.
7737340	7737580	Yeah.
7738180	7746540	You know, but, um, but at any rate, I think that World of Warcraft
7746540	7753500	Cataclysm was probably not just for what it did, but for the influence
7753500	7756620	that it had, like you even said for Final Fantasy 14, for so many
7757100	7763580	other games, it really innovated something that was just sort of dry.
7763940	7764100	Yeah.
7764780	7766180	Um, revitalizes what I meant.
7766660	7769100	And I wanted to say quickly, um, thank you for the kind words
7769100	7770940	about, um, Horde House in the chat.
7770980	7773140	Um, and I know some of you found OLR through that.
7773140	7776380	In fact, I got her, I got a really, really kind message this week, um, kind
7776380	7779420	of about Horde House and, and leading to OLR and somebody that's still
7779420	7781340	listening, um, after all this time.
7781340	7784500	And that's just the type of stuff that just like is all the
7784500	7786340	reward I need to do this show.
7786700	7791100	Um, but, um, my point is, uh, through that show, I got really, you know,
7791100	7794820	introduced to the World of Warcraft community, um, you know, and I met
7794860	7796420	a lot of great people through that.
7796460	7798660	Um, both at, you know, in real life events.
7798940	7802660	Like, um, when the, the time I went to BlizzCon and participated in the,
7802660	7805740	the podcast event that was, which I can't remember the con before the
7805740	7809020	storm, I think it was called or something, some, some, uh, event that
7809020	7812780	they had beforehand, that was a lot of fun and, uh, obviously, um, never
7812780	7816180	met in person, but at least worked with online, the, uh, the, the lovely
7816180	7817820	folks over at Girls Gone Wow.
7818100	7820140	Um, you know, Cyl and Raven and EJ.
7820140	7822860	I know, I know Cyl is no longer on that program, but she was back in
7822860	7824220	the days we were doing Horde House.
7824260	7827420	Obviously Raven and EJ have moved on to Warcraft Radio where they are,
7827420	7830460	they are, are doing wonderfully and it's great to see they still do it.
7830740	7835660	Um, but you know, my point is I met a lot of amazing like people through this.
7835860	7840100	And that's why it's like, I try every expansion to like, can I
7840100	7842180	find my love of wow again?
7842180	7843340	Can I, is it there?
7843340	7850180	Can I find, and it's, um, it's, it's, it's a, it's a time in a capsule that
7850180	7853980	I look back fondly on and go, we did some fun fucking things during that
7853980	7858140	time and I I'm really happy that it's, that it's continuing for some people.
7858460	7860580	Um, uh, and yeah.
7861260	7862020	You know what I found?
7862980	7866500	I remember when Slagkick and I were going to do a web comic
7866500	7867660	called Hillsbrad Blues.
7867700	7868220	Yes.
7868860	7872140	I found the, the one comic that I put together.
7872620	7876220	You know, if you really want to find something rare, find the podcast
7876260	7878260	that Slagkick and my husband did.
7878300	7881380	Yes, my husband had a podcast and it was called Fabulous Flames.
7881580	7885700	And I think they had six or they had like six or seven
7885700	7887180	episodes before they flamed out.
7887380	7892820	It's because, so I'm going to say something that I couldn't say like seven
7892820	7896540	years ago, whenever that show was on, it's because their third host was terrible.
7899500	7903500	No, it's, I don't even remember the guy's name, but every episode he
7903500	7905020	was just there to shit on the game.
7905500	7908180	And I, exactly.
7908180	7911220	It's like, I, it's, it's that difference between being
7911220	7915180	critical and like being hateful.
7915220	7916820	And, and you know what I mean?
7916900	7918940	Always be critical of the things that you love.
7918940	7920100	Cause that's how it gets better.
7920180	7920460	Yeah.
7921180	7927020	But don't, don't, you know, open world of Warcraft, put your butt
7927060	7930300	over the receptacle that goes into world of Warcraft and shit in it.
7930620	7930820	Yeah.
7931260	7932060	It is not your toilet.
7932100	7932340	Anyway.
7932500	7932820	All right.
7932860	7936140	This segment has gone on a very long time, dark soccer, and I'm going to
7936140	7937020	get in trouble for what I said.
7937020	7941540	I'm sure, uh, dark soccer, any last words on this, uh, expansion?
7942540	7943740	Um, I miss it.
7943740	7945500	I miss, I miss cataclysm.
7945820	7945980	Yeah.
7946020	7950020	I want to take, if I could take my demon hunter into cataclysm and just play that
7950020	7952060	forever, I'd be fucking happy.
7952060	7953260	It would be my new animal crossing.
7953300	7958740	You never know a world of Warcraft classic may end up, you know, rumor is
7958740	7961700	they may go to burning crusade and Lich King, and then maybe stop there.
7961700	7966060	Cause what, what cataclysm is for you cat a Lich King is for a lot of people,
7966220	7969700	but you never know, uh, if there's demand for it, who knows what may happen.
7969820	7970420	Never say never.
7970780	7971900	We never thought we'd get a classic.
7971900	7972100	Wow.
7972460	7972780	We did.
7972860	7976300	Actually, you know, the other good thing that came out of me playing a cataclysm.
7977340	7978740	Rebecca black, my paladin.
7979380	7979940	All right.
7980220	7982580	We're definitely going back to the show now.
7982700	7983340	So there it is.
7983900	7986700	Your classic game of the week, world of Warcraft cataclysm.
7987540	7987940	All right.
7988260	7990740	I just looked at the time we're running really long tonight.
7990740	7991940	Well, we got a late start, but that's all right.
7992220	7996020	Uh, so let's, let's, uh, let's go right on into our next
7996020	7998500	segment, some rapid fire news and we'll start off with Loki.
8001180	8001860	All right.
8001860	8003980	So it is not a surprise.
8003980	8008780	More, uh, gaming series are coming to Netflix and other streaming services.
8009180	8012140	So now Netflix has announced that they're going to be doing
8012140	8014500	a Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon.
8014980	8022060	So that's set to air in 2022, but, um, not a, not a huge surprise there.
8022100	8023660	Lots of gaming stuff coming.
8024340	8029700	And then, um, what's kind of cool is Spider-Man Miles Morales on PlayStation
8029700	8036180	five was kind of, um, you had basically two options, either a, you could choose
8036180	8041300	a 60 FPS version of the game, or you could play the game with Ray tracing on.
8041300	8045300	Well, now they have a performance Ray tracing visual mode that you can enable.
8045620	8048340	To play with Ray tracing at 60 FPS.
8048420	8053620	However, the trade-off is that the scene resolution will be reduced slightly.
8054060	8057140	So interesting to see that that's a thing now because definitely
8057140	8058540	60 FPS is the way to go.
8058540	8060740	But retracing does look pretty nice.
8062420	8062860	All right.
8063460	8066740	Uh, let's talk about Prince of Persia, the sands of time.
8066740	8069300	You know, there was a remake that was going to be happening for that game.
8069620	8072020	Uh, and it just got bumped back a little bit.
8072020	8074540	This game was originally going to come out January of 2021.
8074740	8078460	It's been bumped back to March, which honestly isn't that much of a bump back.
8078660	8081700	Um, it's not that bad, but it is news.
8081740	8084620	It was delayed that these things happen, but I'm sure it'll
8084620	8085940	be cool once it is released.
8086180	8089540	Uh, it is coming out on PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC as a reminder,
8089540	8093500	this is an upgrade of the original 2003 version from the game cube,
8093500	8098020	PlayStation two, Xbox, PC, and Game Boy advance, although I think this,
8098020	8101300	uh, remake will take less cues from the Game Boy advance version.
8101540	8105180	It's all, it's a complete remake of the Game Boy advance game only.
8106260	8107780	Uh, speaking of delays.
8107940	8109580	Windjammers 2.
8109940	8113820	I know some of you are really, uh, loving your Windjammers.
8113820	8117900	And I'm sad to say that Windjammers 2 is going to be bumped back to 2021.
8117900	8121220	It was supposed to release this year, but it's getting bumped back.
8121260	8122340	And come on.
8122380	8123300	Are we surprised?
8123380	8123940	I doubt it.
8124300	8126340	Delays happen, especially this year.
8126500	8132140	So, uh, a variety of delays, meaning like, uh, online mode is some of the stuff,
8132180	8134780	uh, the rollback and online mode needs to be tweaked.
8135020	8136460	So they're looking at that stuff.
8136460	8139740	They're not saying exactly when they're just saying 2021.
8140140	8143340	And it's probably best, you know, especially, you know what, especially
8143340	8146020	when it comes to the online play and that stuff, take the time to get it right.
8146300	8148540	You know, you, you don't want to launch launch week and have
8148540	8149540	all that stuff be botched.
8149780	8151620	So, uh, best of luck to that team.
8152100	8152580	Dark Saga.
8154140	8158780	Well, um, something coming to the switch this month on December 21st,
8159220	8164940	um, is a game that came out in 2012 originally, uh, Double Dragon neon.
8165220	8169380	Um, it's going to be in the eShop published by Majestico, um, and of
8169380	8170620	course developed by WayForward.
8171100	8175420	Um, but yeah, it first came out, um, on the PS3 and Xbox 360 in September,
8175420	8178420	2012, and then on Steam in 2014.
8179020	8186740	So, uh, yeah, Double Dragon neon and then, um, ah, happiness, um, Scott
8186740	8192380	Pilgrim versus the world, the game complete edition coming out January 2021.
8192860	8195980	Um, and that was announced by, uh, Ubisoft.
8195980	8199900	It's going to be on PlayStation four, Xbox one, Nintendo switch and Stadia.
8200260	8204620	It's going to include Scott Pilgrim versus the world, the game, and then,
8204660	8208460	uh, the DLC Knives Chow and Wallace Wells add on packs.
8208500	8210060	So there you go.
8210300	8210660	Nice.
8210660	8214500	And how, how convenient with Prince of Persia moving out of the way in January.
8214500	8217140	Now, now Ubisoft can just drop Scott Pilgrim in there instead.
8217620	8219420	I know a lot of people excited to see that come back.
8220260	8223700	And if there's, uh, Oh God, why can't I think of it?
8223700	8228300	Who does the, um, the limited run if limited run does, uh, uh, physical
8228300	8229660	version of this, I'm buying it.
8230420	8234380	Uh, Sia Tabiri in chat says originally that game came out in 2010 as well.
8234420	8236740	Did I, yeah, I guess the movie's about 10 years old.
8236740	8241380	Cause they had the, I think the 10 year Blu-ray edition was either this, I feel
8241380	8243380	like it was last year recording.
8243380	8243860	I think.
8244340	8245020	Didn't that happen?
8245020	8246980	The cast redoing maybe.
8247020	8248220	Yeah, I can't, I can't remember.
8248380	8252940	I know we did a screening of it here in SAC, uh, was that 2018?
8252940	8256460	Couple of years ago, we did a nice big screen, uh, cult movie night.
8256460	8257780	We had a, we had a double feature.
8257780	8259020	It was that in Kung Fury.
8259500	8265220	Um, and we actually, we had the guy that played Thor in Kung Fury was there.
8265220	8269380	And so I got to, some of the perks about my hosting thing is that once in a while
8269380	8272100	I get to interview the celebrity on stage and take audience questions, kind of like
8272100	8273900	running a panel, but before a movie.
8274700	8278980	But in this day, I still actually have the Kung Fury soundtrack in my, uh, uh,
8278980	8279500	playlist.
8279620	8281020	It was a good movie and it was a fun night.
8281020	8281980	That was a real fun night.
8282060	8285820	Oh, those are some good, you know, uh, retro new wave there.
8286220	8288740	But you know, what's really upsetting, speaking of all that hosting stuff and
8288740	8294540	panel, you know, what's really upsetting is that I was supposed to in June do
8294580	8297580	clue the movie and we were going to, and you guys know, that's my favorite movie
8297580	8298100	of all time.
8298500	8302620	We were going to have Leslie Ann Warren in person and I was going to get to do the
8302620	8304580	interviewing, uh, for all that.
8304580	8306980	And, uh, thanks, COVID.
8307220	8309100	No, I was actually cast as Mr.
8309100	8309500	Green.
8309540	8313100	I decided that the drag up and all that was going to be too much work.
8313140	8318500	And there was a, it was fun, but, um, what, you know, it's time to let other people
8318500	8320020	do, and I will have fun with Mr.
8320020	8322060	Green, um, assuming I get to do it.
8322060	8324860	Cause I think they're trying to reschedule it for 2021.
8324860	8327980	I think they actually have a date, whether we'll actually get to do it or not.
8327980	8332780	I mean, just depends on what's going on in the world, but, uh, I was really bummed
8332780	8333580	about that one.
8333620	8337220	I mean, I'm very, not to get too tangenty, sorry, especially when we're running
8337220	8341020	along already, but you know, doing the Rocky horror stuff and the cult movie
8341020	8346060	hosting for years, I was fortunate enough to do a panel, um, a couple years ago at
8346060	8347820	one at a convention here in Sacramento.
8347820	8353100	And on that panel was Barry Bostwick, who played Brad, um, little Nell, who played,
8353340	8356220	I'm sorry, I almost said Magenta, little Nell, who played Columbia and Patricia
8356220	8358500	Quinn, who played, uh, Magenta.
8358620	8363420	So I got to do a Q and a with three fucking icons.
8363460	8369460	And that was like the day I was like, if Lady Patricia Quinn, if they, Oh yes,
8369460	8369740	sorry.
8369740	8370700	Yes, I'm very sorry.
8371700	8376260	If all of my opportunities disappeared tomorrow, I will have still made it.
8376700	8379700	I will have done the thing that I don't know if it can ever be topped.
8380420	8385140	So anyway, just a little aside, but it was a very exciting thing for me personally.
8385140	8386780	So, all right.
8386860	8390540	Uh, moving on, uh, let's travel around the world and check out some release
8390540	8391180	dates.
8391380	8392580	What's coming out this week.
8392580	8395140	Loki, not a whole lot of stuff.
8395180	8400780	Um, so we have collection of saga, final fantasy legend on Nintendo switch, uh,
8400820	8407540	MX GP 2020 on PC PlayStation four and X-Box one demo reborn on
8407540	8409540	Nintendo switch, iOS and Android.
8410340	8416180	Uh, it looks like a me sheets do no sacrifice on PC and into the switch and
8416180	8419300	the Tonia reverse on PlayStation five.
8419340	8419780	That's it.
8420780	8422740	It's finally starting to slow down a little bit, huh?
8423580	8424460	Yeah.
8424860	8425140	All right.
8425140	8427300	Heading over to Japan and looking at the releases there.
8427300	8430580	We still have a few things on the switch this week, including kaleidoscope of
8430580	8436700	phantasm prison is out this week on the switch, yokai watch jam, yokai academy Y.
8436700	8439460	And I thought those games were on their way out, but I guess we have the
8439500	8440900	kind of side game that's coming out.
8441180	8446180	Um, the Rayo's work is never done in a regular and limited edition and watch
8446180	8451820	spring three, refine the story of the marionette, which erudy, uh, is out in,
8451900	8456380	uh, uh, a Japanese edition and a edition with other languages as well.
8456620	8460180	Uh, children of Morta is another big release on the switch this week.
8460300	8464780	We have a lot of releases this week in Japan, uh, no SIA and family trainer
8464820	8466900	also out this week in Japan.
8467180	8468660	Taking a look, I could train my family.
8468900	8472380	Uh, PlayStation five has a couple of releases this week in Japan, man eater
8472380	8478140	and overcooked all you can eat edition and go go five GGN game Neptune reverse
8478380	8482700	in regular and limited edition that coming from compile heart.
8482940	8485860	So those are some PlayStation five releases quickly looking at the PlayStation
8485860	8488500	four to see if anything different jumps out there.
8488700	8489940	That's a lot of gogo five.
8490220	8492500	That's the Sentai game, right?
8493420	8494420	Um, I'm not sure.
8494420	8494980	I was just sorry.
8494980	8496780	I w I went to PlayStation four for a minute.
8497460	8500780	Most of the same stuff on the switch is on the PlayStation four this week.
8501100	8502860	Uh, let me look.
8502940	8504620	Um, yeah.
8504700	8506340	Uh, Kiku Sentai go go five.
8506860	8507340	Is that it?
8508460	8510660	It's just like an old though.
8510700	8513580	Um, Sentai Syria will old by a couple of years.
8513620	8516700	It might be because a different world protected by four goddesses.
8516940	8518260	They fought for world supremacy.
8518300	8518500	Okay.
8518500	8518900	Nevermind.
8518900	8520180	That's a, that's the game.
8520180	8521260	Neptunia reverse.
8521260	8524020	The one I just talked about Japanese.
8524580	8524940	All right.
8524980	8530940	I was just like, why are they doing a game on like such a two year old Sentai series?
8531380	8531700	Yeah.
8532620	8533060	Okay.
8533340	8533700	Thank you.
8533700	8534020	I'm sorry.
8534020	8534740	I was confused.
8535060	8535380	All right.
8535380	8536180	We got it figured out.
8536540	8536860	All right.
8536860	8538140	That's it for a, how about the UK?
8539100	8542060	Two games on the 15th for PlayStation and switch.
8542060	8544820	We have five nights at Freddy's, uh, help wanted.
8545580	8550780	And speaking of old stuff, and then on the 18th, uh, Anima arcade edition.
8552940	8554020	That's it on PlayStation.
8555700	8556460	All right.
8556460	8559180	Let's get into some more news and we'll start with Loki.
8560020	8560620	All right.
8560620	8565980	So this isn't exactly like break, you know, big, I mean, it's big news, but
8565980	8572260	it's not unprecedented because GameStop has been closing stores, uh, quite often
8572260	8576820	actually over the last few years as their profits have kind of dropped a little bit.
8577220	8584020	Uh, apparently, you know, they had a 30% drop in profits during the same
8584060	8589540	period last year, so, um, their fourth quarter ending October 31st.
8589700	8595300	And, um, apparently the last course, obviously, because of COVID situation,
8595300	8599940	having the closed source, um, during that time period, they're also seeing
8599940	8604980	though that they're seeing an increase in profits of 16.5%, uh, comparable
8604980	8607860	month to month forum, uh, Thanksgiving.
8607940	8614780	And, um, the over last year, because even still with COVID, uh, and having
8614780	8618820	to have their stores closed on, despite having their stores closed on
8618820	8622580	Thanksgiving, obviously a lot of people are staying home, a lot of, you know,
8622580	8626420	new console launch, so a lot of sales are going up because of that, even
8626420	8631300	still though, they're looking at closing around a thousand retail stores by the
8631300	8634740	end of 2021, and I think that also includes the stores that have been
8634740	8636340	previously closed over the last few years.
8636340	8641780	So they've had, you know, 462 years that are closed over, uh, 462 stores
8641780	8648020	that are closed this year and last year there was like 321, uh, stores.
8648620	8653220	Um, so I think they'll bring that total up to a thousand, but that's
8653220	8654540	still, that's a lot of stores.
8654540	8658260	I know the local store we had over here is closed down, but I mean, to be
8658260	8662260	honest, they had a lot of, um, a lot of these duplicate locations that they
8662260	8667060	kind of took on as they acquire, you know, even years ago, you know, with,
8667060	8671460	uh, fungal land that in, um, EB games and stuff like that, there's a lot of,
8671500	8673060	it was really tightly packed.
8673060	8673220	Yeah.
8673220	8676900	I probably didn't need as many, you know, footprints out there.
8676940	8681380	I remember over by sunrise mall, had they, there was one in the mall and
8681380	8682740	there was the one across the street.
8683300	8686660	So I think only the, I think they closed the one in the mall, if I'm not mistaken.
8687140	8687740	They did.
8687740	8688100	Yeah.
8688100	8693700	So the one that sunrise mall has set, sorry, local job that that place is sad.
8693700	8695820	I mean, it was already that way before the pandemic.
8695860	8698660	They've already, they already have plans to tear it down and they're
8698660	8703580	going to put some housing and they're also putting like a new shopping
8703580	8705420	center type open mall type thing.
8705620	8706820	They're tearing it down.
8707820	8708140	Yeah.
8708140	8710660	I didn't know that like a downtown Plaza type thing.
8710700	8711340	Holy shit.
8712020	8713860	It's not supposed to happen for like five years though.
8713860	8718580	So, but eventually they're going to tear it down and rebuild with, um, like.
8719060	8720780	That was my childhood.
8720780	8724580	Yo, my NES came from that Sears at sunrise mall.
8724700	8726980	I play station two came from that GameStop.
8727500	8730140	My super nest came from the Montgomery ward across the
8730140	8730620	street.
8730620	8731700	That's now a target.
8733220	8734220	Sunrise mall though.
8734220	8738420	Just got so sad that, that, that location though, has been very good
8738420	8739300	to me when it comes to gaming.
8739300	8741860	Now that I think about it, because that was the target that my X series X
8741860	8743540	came from that was able to get in online.
8743980	8746900	Uh, and then my, that was the one where we all waited for the week.
8747260	8747780	Remember that?
8748020	8750260	Well, I didn't wait, but the rest of it was the one.
8751420	8751620	Yeah.
8751620	8755780	That target there used to be a Montgomery ward there back in the day.
8755980	8757300	They tore it down and built the target.
8758100	8760340	So that's bird cage.
8760500	8760700	Yeah.
8760700	8761060	Bird cage.
8761860	8762380	Yeah.
8762660	8764420	So, um, sorry.
8764420	8765620	Local chat, local chat.
8766380	8766620	Yeah.
8766620	8769340	So, so they are, they are eventually tearing it down.
8769340	8772340	I don't know how quickly that's going to happen, but they've had the plans for a
8772340	8777460	while now, um, you know, it kind of sucks that they're still putting out more
8777460	8782860	housing there, but, um, it's supposed to be like some new, like open air mall
8782860	8786340	type thing where they've got, you know, you're still going to have the big
8786340	8791940	stores, like, you know, the JC penny and Macy's and stuff like that are
8791940	8794220	going to still be there, but they're going to have, like, it's going to be
8794220	8796140	like kind of an open air mall or something.
8796380	8800020	The way I see it is like kind of what the downtown Plaza was, but.
8801020	8802780	So basically it's five years away.
8802780	8804260	They're turning it into the bird cage.
8805700	8806100	Yeah.
8806260	8806820	That's sort of it.
8807260	8808860	Local chats that we got to get past local chat.
8808860	8809940	We're running along as it is.
8809940	8811140	Sorry guys who don't live here.
8812460	8812980	All right.
8813340	8813900	Uh, okay.
8813900	8814540	Let me move on.
8814540	8817660	Let's talk about the changes to the Xbox family app.
8817900	8821980	So, um, Microsoft is, uh, building some interesting new things into their app.
8821980	8825980	And I got to say, you know, even though I don't have a need to do family management,
8826300	8827580	uh, I think this is neat.
8827580	8832140	I'd be very curious for, um, Loki's take on this since, um, you know, he has kids
8832140	8834220	who are getting to that age where they're playing a lot of video games.
8834620	8839020	Um, but Microsoft is basically giving, uh, parents ways to monitor their children's
8839020	8841340	gaming, including, uh, on this app.
8841660	8844380	Uh, the, it's the Xbox family settings app.
8844540	8850460	You can go in and one new thing you can now do, you can block the screen time, even
8850460	8852580	if they haven't reached their limit yet, basically.
8852740	8856620	So if you say, you know, let's say, you know, the kids getting grounded or
8856620	8860460	something and time is up right now, you can hit a button and a message pops up on
8860460	8860860	screen.
8860860	8863020	Your time is up and, uh, that's it.
8863020	8864220	No more Xbox thing for them.
8864540	8869740	Uh, there's also a new feature where, uh, you can do ask to buy it's already on the
8869740	8872540	console, but now it goes into the app as well.
8872620	8876860	So basically if a kid says, I want to buy this, then you can review that in the app
8876860	8878940	and, you know, allow or lecture.
8879020	8880620	And I have experience with that.
8880620	8883900	So, uh, yeah, you can do that on PC already.
8884540	8889900	So like, um, I think though the problem, I was having so many problems with my son
8889900	8892540	being able to friend, like even my other son.
8892860	8897740	So I had to like, I think remove a lot of those restrictions, but basically he, if
8897740	8900940	like he wanted to buy something, it would send me an email saying he wants to buy it
8900940	8902140	and then I could approve it or not.
8902700	8906300	Um, but yeah, I mean, that's cool that they have that.
8906700	8906940	Yeah.
8908700	8910700	Um, all right, let's move on dark Sakura.
8911420	8915740	Well, um, for, I have lots of friends.
8915740	8920940	I know a lot of our listeners like to, uh, uh, get these vinyl soundtracks now that
8920940	8923500	we're seeing a big surgeons and having them released.
8923820	8928780	Well, the newest one, um, coming out is the ActRaiser soundtrack, and it's going
8928780	8929740	to be reissued.
8930300	8935020	Um, it had been, um, uh, out of print since 1991.
8935740	8941580	And so this new release is going to have additional tracks and a symphonic suite.
8942140	8944540	Um, and of course, you know, who worked on ActRaiser?
8944540	8945820	That was Yuzo Koshiro.
8945820	8946540	It sure was.
8947500	8957980	Yas, who is one of, I would say among the best sound designers for a video game ever.
8957980	8960060	Music, music creators for a video game.
8960620	8968940	Um, so it is going to be the, the vinyl is quote divine marble blue has illustrated
8968940	8975020	sleeves and both, uh, both versions of it that are coming out, whether or not it's
8975020	8976460	a vinyl or on CD.
8977180	8981980	Um, we'll have an eight page booklet with comments from Yuzo Koshiro, Yusuke
8981980	8985660	Chihada and, uh, Nijahachi Haneda.
8985980	8992140	Um, and then, uh, some other bonuses from, uh, I'm sorry.
8992140	8996300	Some other bonuses are going to be some of the original illustrations done
8996300	8999660	specifically for the soundtrack by, um, Ayano Koshiro.
9000220	9005900	Um, it is going to be, I'm trying to get the release date.
9005900	9013260	So the, um, the vinyl ships on March, 2021, CD January, 2021.
9014060	9020620	Um, uh, I don't see anything about the, uh, you can order it internationally.
9020620	9025500	It's on the WAIO, uh, um, international store.
9025500	9033580	That's W A Y O records.com slash E N um, where amongst some of the other ones
9033580	9040860	they have on there is, uh, some, uh, Uematsu, uh, original recordings, um,
9042540	9045420	and some Sega soundtracks and through the goods.
9045420	9048060	I think one of them is like the Street to Raise soundtrack, some more Yuzo
9048060	9051340	Koshiro, and you can also get a Chrono Cross music box there.
9053420	9054060	Wow.
9054060	9055980	I love the music in Actraiser.
9055980	9059340	So, um, I wish I was more into vinyl collecting and that type of stuff.
9059340	9061900	So I, I, I bought one, Rob.
9062300	9065660	I bought one vinyl and that was ABBA's the visitor's album.
9065660	9067900	And I don't even own a record player, but I just wanted it.
9067900	9069340	Bought you an ABBA record.
9069340	9070940	And I don't know if I've given it to you yet.
9070940	9071580	That's right.
9071580	9072220	No, you did.
9072220	9074300	I got you the other album.
9074300	9076300	I, uh, it's, it's over there with the other.
9076300	9077020	It just fell over.
9077020	9077740	So I can't see it.
9077740	9078780	Did give it to you.
9078780	9079340	Yeah.
9079340	9084700	Um, they actually have like a multi disc grandia Memorial soundtrack, but that's
9084700	9087020	like a 50,000 yen.
9087020	9088300	And I don't know.
9088300	9088940	Oh, sorry.
9088940	9090300	This isn't your, oh, it's a Euro.
9090300	9092220	Nevermind the hell.
9092220	9094060	And so that means it's super expensive.
9094060	9094700	Yeah.
9094700	9095740	So, yeah.
9096780	9099100	But anyway, um, yeah, there you go.
9099100	9100220	The soundtrack was good.
9101500	9102140	Indeed.
9102140	9104780	It was a few more stories for you guys.
9104780	9107580	Uh, Loki coming back to something you talked about at the top of the show.
9108220	9108860	Yes.
9108860	9110940	So, uh, this is pretty exciting.
9110940	9117100	So finally, after the long beta that they have, uh, ray tracing has come to
9117100	9121260	Minecraft, at least it has all the windows 10 bedrock edition.
9121260	9126060	So now you can actually check out, uh, Minecraft with ray tracing.
9126060	9127340	However, there's some caveats.
9127340	9134220	So one, um, they don't officially put out a texture pack or they haven't put out a
9134220	9136300	texture pack yet that supports ray tracing.
9136300	9140780	So you have to find a texture pack that does, and then use that.
9140780	9145660	And then, um, you know, there's obviously some performance stuff with that as well.
9145660	9150620	I did check it out on my world, um, on my realm a little bit and it looks nice.
9150620	9155900	Um, the texture pack that I had didn't have like a lot of, um, it wasn't too fancy.
9155900	9160140	It was just basically kind of the same type of stuff, but the lighting is really nice
9160140	9163820	and it looks, uh, really good, but I'm curious to see what that would look like on.
9163820	9166620	I think they should bring it to console on the Xbox series X.
9167340	9172060	Um, I'd be curious to see what happens there and they also need to officially put out an
9172060	9172940	actual texture pack.
9172940	9178460	This is a little bit difficult to find one because there really isn't, uh, one available
9178460	9182380	on their store, which is where you think that would initially be.
9182380	9189980	You have to go to like Nvidia's page and Nvidia had some partner made, um, texture packs that
9189980	9191180	were from the beta.
9191180	9192860	And so they weren't necessarily great.
9192860	9195180	I had to actually go to some mind sites to find one.
9196300	9199340	A little bit of a ridiculous, uh, stuff to go through.
9199340	9204060	And even then those didn't look as good as some of the ones that were in like the demo
9204060	9206220	levels that they had for the insider program.
9207420	9210300	But I mean, it is something you can check out.
9210300	9212380	Um, you can toggle it on and off and stuff.
9212380	9218140	Um, but like I said, you know, I couldn't get it to, I liked the way it looked, but
9218140	9220300	then my kids are like, well, I want that for mine.
9220300	9225420	I'm like, well, I'm sorry, you can't run on the switch and you can't run it on your laptop.
9225420	9227580	So I'm the only one that gets it.
9227580	9230620	Um, but yeah, it's, it's really cool.
9230620	9231660	I'm glad it's out of beta.
9231660	9232460	So go check it out.
9232460	9235580	If you have a card that's capable of doing a retracing.
9235580	9237340	So it's pretty cool looking.
9237340	9239660	So when are we getting these updates on Xbox series X?
9239660	9241180	Since that can do ray tracing.
9241180	9241740	I don't know.
9241740	9244060	I don't know where the fancy graphics packs going to be.
9244060	9245660	Well, it's that that's gone.
9245660	9248300	I think at this point that's well, yeah, it's basically this.
9248300	9249980	Yeah, it's this instead.
9249980	9253580	So, uh, yeah, I'd be curious to see if we get that on series X.
9253580	9254140	Why not?
9254140	9258540	I mean, not that I play a ton of Minecraft, but every time they do some big change,
9258540	9260300	I'm always like, let me see.
9260300	9262700	It really is pretty moody.
9262700	9269900	Like, um, when you go to the nether, I mean, it's just, it's night and day different for
9269900	9270700	the way it looks.
9270700	9276140	And also just like caves can be really dark, but also like, it's just, it's more realistic.
9276140	9281980	So like you can, um, go into some, like in the vanilla game would be like completely
9281980	9287100	pitch black, but then they're, you know, pretty well lit in the ray tracing or vice
9287100	9287500	versa.
9287500	9291740	You could have some that, you know, some caves that are dark, but your contrast is turned
9291740	9297260	way up, but like it's dark, dark in these, like just pitch black, you know, it it's pretty
9297260	9297980	cool.
9297980	9305100	Um, I think it's a really neat addition if, you know, especially now my card is kind of
9305100	9310140	like the bottom end of ray tracing, but as you know, a couple of years from now, when
9310220	9315100	we're running all cards that have been doing ray tracing for a while, and as they add more,
9315100	9321660	like, you know, that DLSS and stuff like that to it, it's going to really improve, um, the
9321660	9322620	performance of it.
9322620	9325260	And we'll see a lot more games start taking advantage of it.
9325260	9329980	And I think this is definitely one that, because there's not much you can really do with Minecraft
9329980	9330460	graphics.
9330460	9335100	I mean, aside from upping the pixel count and stuff, but like ray tracing really makes
9335100	9335740	a difference.
9335740	9337100	So it's worthwhile.
9337980	9338860	All right.
9338860	9341900	Well, I hope I get to check it out in a series because I don't have a graphics card good
9341900	9344620	enough on my PC and I don't see myself getting one for a while.
9344620	9347980	Not just, not just the shortage problems, but just because I've been buying too much
9347980	9348780	other shit.
9348780	9351580	Uh, but, uh, yeah, let's check that out at some point.
9351580	9351820	All right.
9351820	9353260	Well, one more story for you guys.
9353260	9359020	And that is about the PlayStation 5 controller now being available to use on Steam.
9359020	9362300	And I think we talked about that, like this was coming or people were playing with this,
9362300	9365900	but, uh, this is now available for all Steam gamers.
9365900	9368220	I think it was like in a beta at some point or something.
9368620	9369660	So this is pretty cool.
9369660	9375340	Uh, it has full support on Steam for the led and the controller trackpad rumble, uh, gyro
9375340	9376780	controls and so forth.
9376780	9381260	You had to originally opt into the beta to use it, but now it is just, it is there.
9381260	9387740	Uh, some games that support it on Steam, death stranding, no man's sky and horizon zero
9387740	9388060	dawn.
9388060	9391580	So interesting that those are all games that would, you know, use that stuff anyway through
9391580	9397580	Sony, but, uh, neat still, uh, the controller of course will work with many other titles.
9397580	9402220	It'll be interesting to see if, uh, folks decide to add features into their games.
9402220	9406940	Uh, paging Aaron, can we get the light to go Brown every time you do a pixel poop?
9406940	9407340	I don't know.
9407340	9407660	Anyway.
9407660	9407900	All right.
9407900	9408940	It was worth a shot.
9408940	9409660	All right.
9409660	9410540	We don't have a place.
9410540	9411980	There's no PlayStation 4.
9411980	9414540	Oh, you mean like an on the five through steam.
9414540	9416380	Yeah, that would be funny.
9416380	9420220	Um, I don't, yeah, I don't know about that.
9420220	9420380	Yeah.
9420380	9423420	And I'm, I'm just teasing obviously, but that's kind of cool.
9423980	9424220	All right.
9424300	9427740	Surprised that they don't have the adaptive triggers though in there.
9427740	9431820	Um, that's not, I guess that's a PlayStation 5 exclusive thing.
9431820	9432140	Yeah.
9432140	9434700	It might be something that's difficult to translate to PC too.
9434700	9435580	I don't know.
9435580	9438140	Someone will hack drivers for it and they'll have it.
9438140	9440220	It's a matter of time, but it might not be very well done.
9440220	9444540	I mean, that sounds really mean, but you know, it might not be as smooth as what you are
9444540	9445740	used to on the PlayStation.
9445740	9446540	It's not at first.
9447260	9448380	So, all right.
9448380	9450380	Uh, so we're going to go to listener round table.
9450380	9453820	If you have any questions that you're dying to know the answers to, uh, try to get those
9453820	9457340	in chat, um, because we're, we're running pretty long tonight here.
9457340	9460780	So I don't have a lot, a lot of time, but, uh, I do want to check out on the mailbag
9460780	9463340	dark soccer over at, oh, let's do it.
9463340	9466700	Participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send your emails.
9466700	9467900	And guess what?
9467900	9468780	It's for me.
9470940	9472060	It's from me.
9472060	9472300	All right.
9473580	9475740	Um, so are you going to share with the class?
9476620	9477020	Maybe.
9477660	9479580	What's in it for me anyway?
9479580	9480060	Reaction.
9480060	9481900	Hey, hey, O R.
9481900	9482780	Hey, Jamie.
9482780	9483180	Yay.
9483180	9483420	Hi.
9484060	9487980	I finally bought animal crossing about a month ago, but I haven't started it yet.
9487980	9489980	I know you were basically obsessed.
9489980	9491100	True facts.
9491100	9495500	So I was hoping you could give me a super short and two point review to get me motivated
9495500	9496860	to start playing.
9496860	9501420	I don't really touch my switch too often, but I know I need to super short email, but
9501420	9501980	there you go.
9501980	9502940	Happy holidays.
9502940	9503900	Frodo's wagons.
9504780	9505280	Okay.
9506000	9515120	So my to the point review is, um, you take the untamed wilderness that is your Island
9515120	9516480	and you make it your bitch.
9518400	9523600	You build your town full of ingrates and you bribe them for their love.
9524480	9531280	And then in return, once they adore you, they give you a picture of themselves and you play
9531280	9534960	dress up and you fill your catalog.
9534960	9543440	But mostly it's taking this really this untamed Island and making it into your own little
9543440	9547600	personal paradise and then hitting Ed with a bug net.
9548800	9553840	My quick review would be it's the escapism we all need in this year.
9554560	9558640	Also, you bought it, so you might as well play it.
9559520	9566080	Otherwise, you know what should motivate you is that I will send you my friend code.
9566640	9568480	Oh, that's very nice with me.
9569280	9575680	I will give you the hookup in DIY recipes because go over there and shake all our trees.
9575680	9576800	She loves that.
9576800	9582000	No, don't shake my trees because I get nuts from my trees and the acorns.
9583040	9584960	Lately, I've been catching my snowflakes.
9585280	9590240	Like a good girl and making little douchebag snowboys.
9590240	9591920	Have you built a snowboy yet, Rob?
9591920	9593920	I haven't touched the game since Labor Day.
9595600	9598640	OK, so you make the little snowman thing, right?
9599200	9603120	And if you don't make him like fantastic, he's a little shit to you.
9604240	9608640	So I need to make a fantastic one, but it's just like, I don't know.
9608640	9613600	It's really hard to put like a description on what makes it addictive and fun.
9613680	9615920	It's just an escape is what it is.
9617040	9621520	And it's going in and getting the stuff to build your house the way that you want it.
9621520	9624640	And some people will do like, quote, a livable house.
9624640	9625440	You know what I mean?
9625440	9627920	Like a living room and all this shit, right?
9627920	9629040	Like I have a kitchen.
9629040	9630960	I used to have a bathroom, but I got rid of it
9632480	9635280	because, you know, in Animal Crossing, everyone pees in the woods.
9635280	9643200	So but the but like I have an alt and I made her house into like there's a tea room room.
9643600	9649280	In the basement, I have a cafe and it's just.
9650560	9653920	It's just really fun, you know, and you get to play with me,
9653920	9657760	I'm going to try to get you my friend code and I will respond back to the email with it.
9658320	9658800	All right.
9658800	9659920	Well, thank you for the email.
9659920	9663040	If you'd like to send me my friend code, too bad.
9663040	9665920	Now just message me at Dark Soccer on Twitter.
9665920	9670560	If you'd like to send us an email, I almost said at Dark Soccer on Twitter,
9671200	9674640	you can send us email participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
9674640	9677280	if you want to participate with the next Mailbag segment.
9677840	9680080	We have a couple of quick questions from chat for the roundtable.
9680080	9680800	Let me get to these.
9681680	9686800	No one special 77 in our chat asks of all the games that came out this year
9686800	9690240	or re-released this year and you got or played.
9690240	9693280	Are there any that stick out for you that you really enjoyed?
9694720	9697440	This is almost spoiling our game of the years, I think.
9698000	9701200	But I will continue with an answer that I've said several times
9701200	9703680	and I think Hades is definitely up there.
9704320	9707040	But honestly, for me, even though this is a years old game,
9707040	9709440	I would continue to say Final Fantasy 14
9710400	9713920	gives me that kind of escapism of doing stuff in a virtual world.
9714720	9717760	And I loved Animal Crossing 2, of course, but I know Jamie's gonna say that.
9718640	9724160	But Final Fantasy gave me that way to like kind of hang out with people in a virtual space
9724160	9726400	when I can't hang out with people in a real space.
9727920	9729920	And that was badly needed this year.
9730560	9733280	So that's kind of why I say that even though that game is, you know,
9733280	9737040	is one I've always talked about here on this show, but like, especially in 2020.
9737040	9738800	Dark Sakura, do I need to ask?
9741840	9742480	I'm not saying.
9744640	9747120	Loki, how about you then?
9749200	9750800	I don't know what I played this year.
9750800	9754240	Like it was funny, like a couple of days ago, like I was like, oh yeah,
9754240	9756320	that's definitely gonna be probably like my game of the year
9756400	9758080	because it was before I played Cyberpunk.
9758080	9759520	There was something that I was thinking of.
9759520	9762080	Oh yeah, I played that and that was really good.
9762080	9764880	I'm trying to think what that was and I can't remember anymore.
9766720	9770480	I have to go back and look at what I played recently, but I know that.
9771680	9772180	Go ahead.
9772800	9775200	I know there's got to be some stuff out there
9775760	9779440	that came out earlier in the year that I was really excited for.
9782400	9782880	I don't know.
9782880	9784720	I can't think of anything out of my head.
9784720	9785920	Borderlands was all right.
9786000	9789120	A lot of games I've been losing myself in are older games.
9789120	9792080	Like you guys know, I spent hours and hours on No Man's Sky.
9792080	9794240	I finally got to the point where I kind of stopped that
9794240	9797120	because I got distracted with other games, but I love that.
9797120	9798480	That's an older game.
9798480	9802080	Now Dragon Quest XI, I've sunk like 20 hours in the past couple weeks into that.
9802080	9803840	So, you know, that's an older game,
9803840	9807520	even if it did just get the definitive edition on Xbox for the first time.
9807520	9811520	So I feel like this has almost been a year of discovering old stuff in a way.
9812560	9815600	But when I really sit down and look at a calendar of everything that's come out this year,
9815840	9818960	I'm sure I'm going to have some strong contenders for game of the year.
9818960	9820240	And don't just assume it's Hades.
9820240	9824240	I haven't really sat down and weighed like what did come out in January, February, March,
9824240	9826960	because there was a lot of good stuff that came out right before the pandemic too.
9827680	9828000	All right.
9830400	9832240	Another question real quick here from actdeft.
9833040	9837280	What's a game that was featured or nominated in the game awards that you want to play but haven't?
9839040	9842880	A game that was nominated or featured in the game awards that you want to play but haven't?
9842880	9843760	The New Mass Effect?
9844720	9846960	Yeah, Dragon Age.
9846960	9850800	I think maybe talking about the actual nominated games.
9853440	9855360	I have Hades and haven't touched it yet.
9856240	9856740	Okay.
9857360	9858080	I want to play it.
9861680	9862180	Maybe...
9866640	9870560	I'm gravitating to saying The Last of Us Part II just to see what all the Hubba Balloo is about,
9870640	9874160	but I just I'm not really a zombie person,
9874160	9877600	but I guess the accessibility options might make some of that more bearable.
9877600	9878640	Oh, maybe the...
9878640	9880720	It's not really zombie zombies, you know?
9880720	9883120	Yeah, I know it's different.
9884880	9886640	I mean, I'm playing through the first Last of Us now,
9886640	9888800	and you do fight like regular people a lot.
9889600	9891440	I think I'll steal an answer from chat though,
9891440	9894720	because this game was hyped last year and I didn't get around to it.
9894720	9895760	Disco Elysium.
9895760	9897680	I still really need to get around to and play,
9897680	9900320	and they did announce that Definitive Edition is coming out.
9900320	9903120	So that would probably be on my list.
9904480	9904980	Loki?
9908960	9916480	I can't really think of anything that they announce that I'd be like super enthusiastic.
9916480	9918160	I mean, the Evil Dead game, I guess.
9919680	9922480	As far as like stuff that's nominated for awards.
9926640	9929600	Yeah, I can't really think of anything that I...
9929600	9931520	I mean, Hades, everyone keeps talking about it.
9931520	9932800	I guess that would be interesting.
9933840	9934880	Do I have that?
9934880	9937120	I want to see I have that on the Epic Store,
9937120	9939680	but maybe I don't remember.
9940960	9942880	There's a lot of stuff in my library that I don't remember.
9946160	9948320	I think that was out when the store launched,
9948320	9950240	but I don't know if they gave that out for free.
9953280	9954560	Nope, don't have that.
9954560	9959440	SG100Matt asks one more question here.
9960080	9964400	What game from your lifetimes reminds you the most about the holidays?
9964400	9967280	Like the game that you got over the holidays as a kid
9967280	9969760	that you played the hell out of that gives you fond memories.
9970960	9973520	For me, it was more a game that I rented,
9973520	9976640	but I always associate this around like the new,
9976640	9979360	that little break between Christmas and New Year's.
9979360	9980720	Super Mario Brothers 2.
9981600	9983920	That's right, going all the way back to the NES
9983920	9984960	and Mario Brothers 2.
9984960	9988000	And when I rented that game and I stayed up all night playing it
9988000	9990160	and it was off from school for a little bit
9990160	9992160	and that was like my winter break was that game.
9992160	9994080	So that's my easy answer.
9994080	9995120	How about you guys?
9995120	9995760	Darcyra?
9996720	10001520	I played so much Legend of Zelda Link to the Past
10001520	10003440	and keep in mind it was supposed to be for my brothers,
10003440	10004880	but screw them, it was my game.
10006240	10009840	So I would put that one definitely up there
10009840	10012960	as one of the big holiday things that I remember.
10013600	10014160	And Loki?
10015200	10018480	I don't remember any games I've got for Christmas.
10019120	10022160	So I really don't have anything.
10022160	10025440	I can't think of any that I purchased
10025440	10028320	or that would have been given to me.
10029440	10030480	So I don't know.
10031040	10032560	All right, all right.
10032560	10034880	Well, I think that's going to be our last question for the night
10034880	10037200	because we've got to get to wrapping things up.
10037200	10039520	I will check in though with Loki real quick or Dark Soccer
10039520	10040880	and see if there's any last minute stories.
10040880	10045200	I didn't check for any.
10045200	10048960	I don't think we had anything kind of breaking.
10049680	10052720	Yeah, I think we're getting to closing time.
10052720	10054080	It's about midnight on the East Coast
10054080	10055120	and nine o'clock on the West Coast.
10055120	10056400	So go ahead though with your thoughts.
10056400	10062640	I am planning on doing a test stream to play Hivebent 2.
10064320	10065760	Homestuck Hivebent 2.
10065760	10066640	Oh, okay.
10067280	10072640	So look at my Twitter for when I'm going to do that
10072640	10075680	because it really all just depends on how I feel.
10077520	10081600	But I'm sensitively thinking that I might do it this Wednesday, actually.
10082320	10085680	So my channel, I forgot what my fucking channel is even named.
10087200	10090640	It's a underscore olr.
10090640	10091200	I think it is.
10091920	10092320	Hold on.
10092320	10093840	I'm just going to type to myself.
10093840	10094320	You're fine.
10095120	10099280	Yeah, DarkSakura underscore olr.
10100240	10103760	FatNinjaDM talking about a holiday game says in chat,
10103760	10105920	Fantasy Star for the Master System.
10105920	10110240	I did pick up real recently and I haven't played them yet and I need to.
10110240	10114800	But the Sega Ages collection was like on hell a sale on Nintendo Switch.
10114800	10118640	And so I picked up Fantasy Star, Alex Kidd, and Fantasy Zone.
10118640	10120880	So I have all those games on Switch waiting to play.
10121680	10123280	You know I got Fantasy Zone right away.
10123280	10123920	Oh, I know.
10123920	10125360	And Dan got Outrun.
10126880	10129200	Dan fucking loves Outrun.
10129200	10133680	You know what I want, though, is I want like a different shooter pack.
10134880	10137920	I don't even know if it might already be there, but I freaking want.
10139280	10140160	Yeah, Bobby.
10140160	10143760	Bobby says I got Outrun too, but I paid 500 bucks for it because you got an arcade one up.
10145680	10149360	But I want like a classic shooter thing.
10149360	10157840	Like, like maybe like the first Don Patch or Polestar Blazing Star.
10157840	10160320	But I really, really, really, really want R-Type.
10160320	10161440	Just like R-Type.
10162800	10165760	That has like some of my favorite video game music ever.
10166320	10167840	This freaking R-Type.
10167840	10168400	Good times.
10169360	10171840	All right, Loki, did you find anything?
10172880	10173360	Nope.
10173360	10175120	All right, that's fine.
10175120	10176160	We probably need to wrap up.
10176160	10177200	We've been running.
10177200	10178320	We got a little late start tonight.
10178400	10180800	So I think the runtime on the podcast is still under three hours.
10180800	10183600	But it's now midnight on the East Coast, nine o'clock here.
10183600	10187280	And we still have to wrap a few things up before bedtime.
10187280	10190880	So thank you all, of course, for tuning into the show this week.
10190880	10192480	Thank you so much for supporting the show.
10192480	10196560	Whether you were here live or you listen on the podcast feed, we really appreciated it.
10196560	10200320	If you like this show, you can help us out by spreading the word because we are the show
10200320	10201520	where every gamer has a voice.
10201520	10205760	But if the voices aren't here in studio to put out over the air, then how can we get them?
10205760	10207520	So please tell a friend or two about the show.
10207520	10208320	Help us spread the word.
10208320	10210000	Where the mouth goes a long, long way.
10211600	10214800	What else goes a long, long way is support via Twitch,
10214800	10217120	the auto hosting and things you guys do on Twitch.
10217120	10218160	That is awesome.
10218160	10219360	Really appreciate that.
10219360	10223680	And if you do feel like supporting the show in a financial way, might I point you to the
10223680	10226160	VOG Network shop that just opened recently.
10226160	10228720	There's a few items there you can pick up to support VOG Network,
10228720	10231760	OLR and Bobby Black Wolf and other stuff to come soon.
10231760	10234240	More designs hopefully in the coming months.
10234240	10238000	But that's vognetwork.com slash shop.
10238000	10239120	I was getting to it.
10239120	10240640	So check that out.
10240640	10243600	So I'm going to repost in the chat room.
10243600	10244100	Thank you.
10245120	10247760	And I think that's really it.
10247760	10248880	Otherwise, all I have to say.
10248880	10251600	So let's say you don't even need the post in the chat room.
10251600	10255440	If you scroll down the page a little bit, there's an actual little widget there that you can
10256400	10257200	purchase stuff from.
10257200	10258080	At least it is online.
10258800	10262880	Oh, yeah, I think there is a widget right there on the VOG stream.
10263200	10266400	Bobby's been playing with that shirt that I was requesting, Rob.
10267200	10268320	I forget which one that was.
10269040	10272320	The v-neck women's shirt with the VOG logo.
10272320	10274160	You got to remind me when I'm sitting in front of a computer.
10274160	10274880	And yes, I'll do it.
10275440	10277040	Yes, we'll get it.
10277040	10278640	I said more things come, didn't I?
10278640	10279140	All right.
10280160	10281280	Well, teaser then.
10281280	10283200	And it's going to be in this shop because I want it.
10283840	10284720	That's fine.
10284720	10286560	You get your say.
10287280	10289040	OK, let's wrap up.
10289040	10290640	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
10291440	10293040	Loki, your final thought tonight.
10294160	10296640	My final thought is I'll be working more on my game this week.
10298880	10303760	My final thought is thank you for all the kind words you guys have sent over the years.
10304400	10306160	I really appreciate it.
10306160	10308080	And we have such a good community here at OLR.
10308080	10308880	I'm so thankful.
10308880	10310640	And y'all make it worth it.
10310640	10317200	And they're the fuel that keep this thing going on into almost episode 850, our 19th
10317200	10318080	year coming up.
10318720	10321520	I can't believe that 20 years is really in sight for this show.
10321520	10323680	It's pretty crazy, but I love it.
10324720	10326560	Dark soccer, last but not least, your final thought.
10328080	10330160	It's been a month and I still miss Supernatural.
10332720	10333520	All right.
10333520	10336160	Well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10336160	10337200	Have a great week.
10337200	10338400	Happy gaming.
10338400	10340000	Catch up on your backlog.
10340000	10340560	Have fun.
10341120	10343120	We'll see you next time here on the show in seven days.
