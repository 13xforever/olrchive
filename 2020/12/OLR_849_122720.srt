1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,720
Personally, I thought that Apple's Trash Can Mac Pro was generally a great machine,

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,120
but I understand that the lack of expandability was a net loss for the form factor. Does that

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,520
mean I should be more positive about the KF console? No! No! I don't think it does!

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,600
Capturing heat so close to a heat source that it's supposed to be cool sounds awful. Grease

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,840
and oil are not ingredients in liquid cooling. This is just one story in a night of lawsuits

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,840
anniversary shutdowns and wrap ups. Join your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,800
as they discuss this and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:44,320
where every gamer has a voice. Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,800
another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,360
we are live once again with, if you can believe it, the last show of 2020. It is episode number

11
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:04,600
849 for tonight, December the 27th of 2020. My name is Rob Roberts, by myself in the studio

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,560
as I have been for most of this year since March, and joining me via the Magic Discord

13
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:16,920
say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers. Welcome to my mess. Your mess looks fine.

14
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:24,760
It's definitely a nerd cave. It's a work in progress. I've thrown out four trash bags

15
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,160
worth of just garbage. You know, the folks that listen to us on the podcast feed, which

16
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,760
I would always strongly encourage, of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the

17
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,360
Voice of Geeks network, twitch.tv slash VOG network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

18
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,720
at about six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern. But for those that can't be here

19
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,760
live and I understand Sunday's a busy night for a lot of people, we do have the podcast

20
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,240
which has been going for a very long time, which you can check out on iTunes, Spotify,

21
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,560
lots of popular podcast players out there. All the things. The podcast folks can't see

22
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,800
what you're talking about. So you can mess you can lie and say, oh, it's it's this. Everything

23
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:09,960
is well curated. I own my shit. And I know I have been lazy and sick for most of the

24
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:16,000
year and the shit piled up and I have years of old cosplay stuff. I found 20 year old

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,320
cosplays a few weeks ago, Rob. Oh, my gosh. I finally threw them out. My Leona costume.

26
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,880
OK, the short the cargo shorts I had for my Leona costume, I can now pull on by one leg

27
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:39,640
over my hips. Yeah. So I was got says something. I was going to say, don't ask me to show the

28
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,760
rest of the studio here and what's happened to this, this outside this little box that

29
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,080
you see me in. Dark Soccer's throne has clean laundry on it. There's a monitor on the table

30
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,880
up to the show and it's seen your laundry on it. So it's a girl don't even try me. It's

31
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:03,320
a convenient place. But but at any rate, I've only kept one of the old costumes and that

32
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:09,280
was my Jill costume because it was the first one I did when I moved to California. And

33
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,100
I actually threw away Emmy. Except I saved the striped shirt I had under it was actually

34
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:23,780
an old Navy pajama shirt and it's really warm. So I kept that. But like the wig, I

35
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:30,380
didn't know about wig care back then very well. And that poor blue wig was like that.

36
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:38,260
Yeah, it was ready to go. I kept the hat, the ginormous white tam that she wears. So

37
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,660
and it was actually in really good shape. I mean, I paid 20 bucks for it 20 years ago,

38
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:51,580
so it had to be good. So yeah, useful stuff and I found a sewing kit. Okay. I also did

39
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,780
get rid of bike in because I can do a lot better. I'm taking a look at our chat room

40
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,060
because of course while we tape live you can participate along in our chat chat over twitch.tv

41
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,860
slash v o g network and SSU 100. Matt says rooms full of mess and piled up stuff much

42
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:13,820
like many folks Animal Crossing homes. And to answer Phoenix 7726 who says I found cosplay

43
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:24,340
as old as olr. No, it's older. It's under sedation age. Oh, but grandpa grandpa died

44
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:30,400
under sedation isn't around anymore. So also to answer ranch on. Travis is fine. He got

45
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:37,920
an Xbox for Christmas just Tamari costume is in another box. And actually the kimono

46
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:45,280
is way too big for me but still in great shape. And I'm thinking about taking it in and repurposing

47
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:54,680
it. It might end up as a certain Shinsengumi character who will remain unnamed. Right?

48
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,400
Well let me I'll let me also introduce as I do every week say hello to tech master Loki.

49
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,960
Hello. Hi. Are you holding on to any old cosplay Loki?

50
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:10,200
No way. Don't you have Sackboy? He's threw that away.

51
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:17,120
It was in the garage for a very long time. And I was just afraid that if I put my head

52
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,760
in it that there could be so many spiders. So I was like, I'm not gonna risk it. I'm

53
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:32,800
just gonna throw it away. Yeah, well, you know, I did actually check it before I threw

54
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,960
it away. But like it was just so dusty and stuff. And I was like, I'm never gonna wear

55
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,920
this again. Yeah. So yeah, I forgot about that Sackboy costume. But that was now that

56
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,580
you mentioned it. That was a legendary episode. Well, our wasn't that like the 10th anniversary

57
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,840
or something like it was a landmark episode, maybe Episode 500. I don't remember. But you

58
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,600
dressed all dark Tetsuya. What episode was it or Misty? I need to ask the real experts

59
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:03,800
of the show. But you you actually came to the studio. I do remember it was at the house

60
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,840
over. I don't want to give out addresses on the show. I guess I don't live there anymore.

61
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,400
But the ranch is the garage. Yeah, well, yeah, it was in the garage there. Yeah, yeah. And

62
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,760
I remember it was in that studio. You had the neighbor across the street who house caught

63
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:23,680
on fire. Yes. Did I tell that story on O.L.R.? I don't remember. I may not have. I remember

64
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,880
driving by and seeing the house gutted. And that's always what I remember. Well, I can

65
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,520
tell it now. I probably. And Drew knocking over the table. I probably didn't want to

66
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,560
tell it then, because if I told it on air, it would have given away where I lived. But

67
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,480
I live there anymore. So it doesn't matter. So this true story, the house across the street

68
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,440
from me burned down one day. And I know that sounds really scary. And what's also really

69
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,240
scary about it is that I was napping when it happened. I slept through the whole damn

70
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,160
thing. And I woke up to the sounds of my room. My roommate, Johnny, came home and he was

71
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,480
like, Rob, Rob, are you here? Rob, Rob. And I'm like, what? Are you OK? And he goes, he

72
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:11,260
just gives me this look like he goes, look outside. And I like peek through the mini

73
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:17,500
blinds and I just see all these lights and I see the house on smoke. Like, what the fuck?

74
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:23,360
And yeah, the house across the street burned down. And it was one of those things where

75
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,580
they had a lot of devices and power cords that were going into their garage as if they

76
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:35,740
were potentially making some things in the garage, allegedly. And that's I'm going to

77
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:42,460
leave it at that. So, yeah, that was that was an interesting experience. So we moved

78
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:50,380
either meth or porn. We moved. So, yeah, we should make that a new game show, meth or

79
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,460
porn. Yeah. Who knows what was going on in that house. So, yeah, I probably didn't tell

80
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,400
that story on air at the time, because, you know, if I say, oh, the house across the street

81
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,380
from me burned down, then people would figure out exactly where I live. But I don't live

82
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:07,660
there anymore. So it's fine. Yeah. Act Defton chat says they blazed it. They sure did.

83
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,420
I you know, I don't like to make fun of it because somebody's house burned down. But

84
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:17,980
at the same time, if it if it was what we all suspect it was, then how bad do you feel

85
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,620
on a scale of one to ten? You know, yeah. If you can't make a joke about it, what can

86
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:27,100
you do? Right. So, yes. So that was that was I don't know how we got on this subject from

87
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:36,140
welcome to our hope. You all had a great holiday. Yes. Yes. I have a new breaking thing

88
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:45,740
is that a gaming magazine, JYMING has highlighted Rock Rockum Sakura of San Francisco. Oh, fine.

89
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:52,620
Well, they've got their who is a gaming queen. They have their award show, which I can't

90
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,620
remember the name of off the top of my head. Sorry. But I know they nominated a bunch of

91
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,740
stuff. Oh, well, are not nominated, but that's OK. How very dare they? That's all right.

92
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,580
That's all right. But no, there's a lot of good stuff that was nominated there. I remember

93
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:11,020
seeing it across the Twitter stuff. And I was thinking like, I guess I because there

94
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:15,020
was talk about doing that show in person at one point, obviously, even though I think

95
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,580
it's in February, I think I think that talk is still off the table. I don't think people

96
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:24,180
can really plan on in-person events until at least summer. And even then, there's going

97
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:33,260
to be footnotes, asterisks and things of that nature. But yeah. So anyway, Phoenix, seventy

98
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:38,500
seven, twenty six and chat says, wait, is OLR the new Night Vale? I don't know. I don't

99
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,740
know. We probably have more listeners if we were. All right. Let's get it. We are we are

100
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:48,340
a video game podcast. We love all of our listeners. We do. And we hope you all had a good holiday

101
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:54,780
I know. I know Hanukkah ended quite some time ago. But Christmas, Christmas was this past

102
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,820
week, which I know a lot of people celebrate. So I hope you all had a good Christmas that

103
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:05,540
we're celebrating that. Kwanzaa goes for seven days. Right. So we're in that starts the day

104
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:10,580
after Christmas. So we're in the midst of that. And then Festivus for the rest of us.

105
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:17,060
I know I saw some posts on that. And if you're Satanist, Sol Invictus. Oh, right. Or paganist

106
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:24,100
would have solstice. Yule. Or Yule. Yes. Yule or Solstice. But may you have a an unconquerable

107
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:32,540
Sol Invictus? DJ Rama S in chat says six days. My bad. Six days. For Kwanzaa. Yes, for Kwanzaa.

108
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:38,700
Yeah. All right. Anyway, let's get into video game news and stuff going on in the game world,

109
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,780
which considering it is a holiday week, like usually this would be the night of nothing

110
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:49,540
but off topic because there's not a lot happening in the industry. But we can do that. And we

111
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:55,740
damn well might challenge us, try us. No, but we do have quite a bit of gaming news.

112
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,860
There's still less. I know we have kind of a shorter show role than we usually do just

113
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:04,100
because less did happen. But I honestly feel like most years we're sitting here this week

114
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:09,180
going, we ain't found shit. Right. Like there isn't a lot going on in gaming. But this this

115
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:15,260
week has been pretty busy, all things considered. And it starts with it starts with something

116
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,660
I think we all saw coming. Dark Soccer and Loki going to talk about this one Dark Soccer.

117
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:27,220
Why did you start us off? What happened? Well, CD Projekt Red, you know, the ones who are

118
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:36,980
responsible for that clusterfuck that is Cyberpunk 277. They are seeing some lawsuits because

119
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:47,620
they basically were considered to miss mislead the public. So some of the class action lawsuits

120
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:55,140
are being brought forward. Actually, one of them is brought on on behalf of Andrew Tramp,

121
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:02,620
who is one of the investors by the Rosen law firm alleging that CDPR willfully neglected

122
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:09,060
to inform investors of the nature of how buggy the game was and that the company downplayed

123
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:15,860
other issues surrounding the game prior to release. They were saying that their public

124
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:21,600
statements that were made prior to release, and this is a quote, were materially false

125
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,960
and or misleading because they misrepresented facts and the company failed to disclose that

126
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:33,320
Cyberpunk 277 was virtually unplayable on current generation Xbox or PlayStation systems

127
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:42,760
due to an enormous amount of bugs. And I'm going to read the comments from the CDPR executives.

128
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,160
This is another quote. After three delays, we as the management board were too focused

129
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,400
on releasing the game. We underestimated the scale and complexity of the issues. We ignored

130
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:56,760
the signals about the need for additional time to refine the game on the base last gen

131
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,240
consoles. It was the wrong approach and against our business philosophy. On top of that, during

132
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,320
the campaign, we showed the game mostly on PCs. They're basically like, yeah, we were

133
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:15,640
shitty. There's another lawsuit from the Schall, S-C-H-A-L-L, Schall law firm seeking class

134
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:23,920
action status for violations. They list the ones for the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

135
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,360
and rule 10B5 promulgated there under blah, blah, blah. It's more had to do with the US

136
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,040
Securities and Exchange Commission basically laying out the same evidence that was presented

137
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,080
by the Rosen law firm, citing the bugs and mere unplayable status of the game for the

138
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:44,400
earlier consoles. They're quote, based on these facts companies, public statements were

139
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,980
false and materially misleading throughout the class period when the market learned the

140
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:59,500
truth about CD project investors suffered damages. And there was a hot fix that was

141
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:06,740
released basically to address bugs and performance issues. There was another one that was released

142
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:15,220
this week, or I guess by this week, I mean, it's last week to fix the save data corruption

143
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:20,380
for PC. And it's looking like there's going to be other fixes, but I'm wondering if it's

144
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:27,820
going to be too little too late for what's going to be on the table. Because I mean,

145
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,300
there are people who can't afford to go right out and buy the new console right when it

146
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,140
comes out and they'd like to be able to enjoy the game. The game was advertised as supposed

147
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,900
to be available and playable on this earlier consoles.

148
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,620
Right. What's interesting though, and you know, we'll talk a little later in the show

149
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,940
as well, because I think Loki has a piece on like how the game is actually doing right

150
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,260
now. We'll talk a little bit about that later in the show, but I think what's important

151
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:54,500
to note in what you just outlined there with what's going on in the two different class

152
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:00,180
actions there is that this is an investor piece. So this isn't what this isn't. And

153
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,020
I think where people kind of thought it would go based on some prior class actions that

154
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,960
have happened in the past is that at least in what Dark Soccer is talking about now,

155
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:13,360
the gears they're turning now, this is not gamer upset at the product they bought. That

156
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:20,200
is not what this is. This is a lawsuit for investors because yeah, the goal of a company

157
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,840
is to make money for investors, right? Capitalism, woohoo, whatever. But that is what it is.

158
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,640
And so, go ahead.

159
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:32,480
SSJ 100, Matt actually did sum it up very perfectly and I quote, so the investors are

160
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,720
pretty much suing to reclaim whatever they lost from the stocks they owned in it.

161
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,760
Yeah, that's pretty much it in a nutshell or that basically by perception of money lost

162
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,920
by yeah, perception of money lost by having these various refunds that are going on and

163
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:56,640
by not releasing by kind of hiding what you did on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, you affected

164
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,120
basically the bottom line, the sales. So that is, that is I think very interesting to note

165
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,560
This is coming from the investor standpoint because I feel like with that playing into

166
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:16,160
it, the result of this whole thing could have implications in our industry further down,

167
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:24,640
I think. Too early to say, but you know, everybody in gaming right now, whether you love Cyberpunk,

168
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:30,040
whether you hate it, whether you don't care, wherever you're at on that, that, you know,

169
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:37,240
everybody's looking at this because what happens here, I think will have an impact on how games

170
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,600
are marketed, height and so on in the future. Again, this is very, I think what's happening

171
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,400
here is very different from what happened with No Man's Sky, which was the product, not of a

172
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,800
publicly traded company, by the way, and was more rooted in some PR blunders.

173
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,640
You say why I don't go out and buy new games anymore.

174
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,200
I think a lot of us are at that point, to be quite honest. Anyway,

175
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,120
I don't get excited anymore.

176
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,320
Loki, I know this story has been on your radar this week as well. I don't know if there's

177
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,160
anything you want to add or anything from your perspective.

178
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:13,160
No, not really. I mean, it's pretty much, it's just, you know, investors, um, feeling that they

179
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,840
were misled. And usually if that happened, you get in trouble with the board or, you know, you have

180
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:23,240
to answer to that. So kind of just more of what we were talking about last week, how probably

181
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:29,320
leadership's gonna be held accountable for that. Um, and someone may get let go, you never know,

182
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,880
but that's kind of just more coming out of this. I think you're absolutely right on that. Um,

183
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:40,040
let's see Questbuster in chat says, uh, CD project stock has lost nearly half its value in the past

184
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:45,960
few months. It lost around 20% around the cyberpunk 2077 fiasco. And I think that's an

185
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,000
important thing to point out is because again, it doesn't really matter how you feel about the game

186
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,920
personally. Cause I also see people in chat that are saying, you know, a Zen monkey 11 says people

187
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:00,520
will be able to play the game on any platform by March. No worries. Um, Questbuster says it's not

188
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:05,480
unplayable on a PS4. I finished it, but it could definitely have used more time in the oven and not

189
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,600
everyone will want to deal with the bugs. And again, this isn't about like trying to take a

190
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:16,200
dump on the game or whatever, like, or, or pour gasoline on a fire. That's already going. This

191
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,480
is more like just facing the kind of the reality of no matter how you personally feel about the

192
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:29,400
game, because the refund mechanism got triggered because these headlines about Sony pulls a game

193
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:36,360
from digital sale, you know, whether that was really something that Sony did about the quality

194
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:42,840
or whether that was a response to Sony did because of something CD project reds leadership did

195
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:48,280
saying, go to Sony. Yeah. Right. Cause they told them to go to Sony, but they didn't tell Sony

196
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,400
that they were doing that. So that's why they pulled it from the shop. And that again is a

197
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,080
problem of leadership. And that's the point I'm trying to make. Again, you have a problem of

198
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:03,480
leadership and ultimately what got impacted the stock value and the, the, you know, whether

199
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:10,120
the refunds were as big as we think they are or not. And that whole thing, it doesn't matter.

200
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,960
The stock value plummeted because of all of the bad press, because Sony pulling your game from

201
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,080
the store is not a great headline. Even if quality didn't have anything to do with it,

202
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,920
because believe me and believe you, cause you've seen it too. There's a lot of shit on the

203
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:32,360
PlayStation four marketplace. There is some garbage on the PlayStation four marketplace

204
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:37,080
and the X-Box marketplace and any cell phone marketplace and steam, you name it.

205
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:44,680
It's got garbage. So quality is not the problem. Ultimately. I know that sounds weird to say.

206
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:52,520
So the thing is, is that when the garbage is something that's expected to be the utter

207
00:19:52,520 --> 00:20:02,280
opposite of garbage, you know, it's, it's just really bothersome, you know, this whole situation

208
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:10,840
is very bothersome. And I actually, I mean, I do want to see them held to the fire over it a lot

209
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:20,920
more, just because I think that we need to stop this whole thing of having these half-baked games

210
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:28,440
come out. Yeah. You know, if we, if we have, you know, people putting the same care into like what

211
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,360
they would have done for a cartridge based game in the past, because you can't patch a cartridge.

212
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,800
That's true. Well, you, well, I mean, I guess if you had.

213
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:48,040
The average gamer does not patch a cartridge back in the NES days. Yes.

214
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:55,320
Unless you were getting, you know, ROM hacks and translated ROMs. I digress. But

215
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:03,240
it's it's really just a shame and it's something that we need to hold these companies accountable

216
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,600
for, you know, they shouldn't. I'll just say, I, I, I think ultimately,

217
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,040
and just following what I said last week, I think how this ends one or both CEOs will be done.

218
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,760
And that's how this ends. There's, there's no other outcome. I think that could satisfy

219
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:25,160
the investors at this point. And that's that. I think they're still going to try

220
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:32,600
to play this. But it won't matter. And I really, I kind of have hope that they do.

221
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,360
And this is just more of me now being a little bit vindictive about it.

222
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:45,400
But if they try to play it off more, keep trying to do the same thing and then fail after that,

223
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:51,480
like burn harder, then I think that's really going to get the, the message across. And I mean,

224
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:58,840
I don't want to bring politics into it, but we're also seeing that it's been just this

225
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:05,160
ongoing thing in general, in the public of offer this promise, offer this, say this, say that,

226
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,800
and then not being able to pull through or doing the exact opposite. And now,

227
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,680
you know, there's consequences to pay. And I really want to start seeing these consequences

228
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:20,600
being, this is what I'm thinking of. I want to see them being held to the consequence.

229
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,400
Yeah. I definitely want to see other CEOs looking at this situation going like, Oh,

230
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,920
better make sure that doesn't happen here. I want them all to shit their pants or remember

231
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:37,800
who pays their bills. That's another way to put it. No. Well, you know me, if I can be blunt about

232
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:43,880
it, I will. What's that? Let me ask this question before we get into our gaming weeks. And it's kind

233
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,120
of a follow-up to something that came up on Bobby Blackwell's show tonight. Because of course,

234
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,200
you know, as I mentioned at the top of the show, he's on live before us here at the voice of

235
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,480
geeks network. Now, Bobby was talking about some of his highlights from the year of various sorts.

236
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,240
I won't spoil everything. I won't talk about categories and stuff, but one game that he

237
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:06,120
talked a little bit about was half-life Alex. And I thought it was kind of interesting because he

238
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:14,120
said half-life Alex, you know, and this is one way you can look at it. Absolutely. Half-life Alex

239
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,520
is basically half-life three. This is it. This is half-life three. This is the game

240
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:24,440
that folks have been waiting for. This is half-life three, but they knew they could never

241
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:31,080
live up to the hype that everybody had in their minds built up for half-life three, especially

242
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:37,080
when you add that additional twist or challenge of the fact that it is VR only based, which limits

243
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,800
your audience and all that stuff. Because they knew they could never really live up to that

244
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:47,640
half-life three hype. Instead, they tailored the message and made it half-life Alex. And he kind

245
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:54,040
of made a little joke in there about how cyberpunk, you know, didn't think to do the same thing or

246
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,560
something along those lines. And it did kind of, you know, even though I think he just kind of

247
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:03,320
said it as a one-off comment, it did kind of make me think, huh, you know, yeah, in many ways what

248
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:12,120
happened with cyberpunk was kind of a victim of its own hype machine. Like, what if they either

249
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:17,240
A, had just announced the game a lot later, which maybe the industry wouldn't really allow them to

250
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:24,120
do, or B, just said, you know what? Cyberpunk 2077, unfortunately, it just wasn't meeting our

251
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:29,560
expectations. So we've decided, can it? But guess what we have coming out for the PlayStation 5,

252
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:38,760
PC and Xbox Series X, no mention of prior consoles. We've got this game, Cyber Intruder 2078 is coming

253
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:45,800
and it's going to be awesome. I don't know. Loki, you're the only one out of us that's

254
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,360
actually played the game. And I think you've enjoyed the game. Did they set themselves up to

255
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:56,200
fail with the hype or what? I don't know if they, I mean, it was a pretty hyped game. I

256
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,880
just think they had difficulty with releasing on so many platforms at once. I mean, I knew that

257
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,560
everything nowadays that gets released is a little bit buggy, but this was like kind of

258
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:12,680
an extraordinary case of bugginess. I mean, a Bethesda level of bugginess, if you will,

259
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:17,720
probably even a little bit beyond that. It just, it obviously needed more time. It'll get better

260
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:24,760
as it goes along, but it's just, this is just the trend in gaming nowadays that companies release

261
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,240
these half finished products that meet a deadline. And then they keep promising that they're going

262
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:35,320
to patch it after the fact, or keep fixing it or adding on to it. We'll just have to see if

263
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:41,800
it actually happens. And some more comments from chat I think are really good and worth reading

264
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:47,000
here. SSG100Matt says, Cyberpunk had trouble living up to the hype, much like No Man's Sky

265
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,640
did at first. Hopefully they can turn it around like No Man's Sky did. I imagine they will.

266
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,400
I also imagine they will. I don't think they have a choice at this point, but I think that was

267
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:00,200
probably always in their long game plan, because we know there's Series X and PlayStation 5 versions

268
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,840
that are still coming, like specific to those, not running on backwards compatibility. And of course,

269
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,240
of course they've got DLC in the works and things like that. So there's going to be opportunities

270
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,360
for them to relaunch the game with a game of the year edition. I mean, look at the playbook for

271
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:19,720
Witcher 3, right? That game has been selling for years and years and years, and they have a long

272
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,440
game on how they're going to continue to sell the game. And it's on Steam sale right now,

273
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:30,600
by the way. Of course, of course. The Winter Sale, of which I've bought some games. And this is

274
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:37,400
really important too. Dartetsuya in chat says, To me, Cyberpunk 2077 at least lived up to the hype.

275
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,440
I'm probably close to 60 hours in and I can't get enough. I just absolutely love the setting. And I

276
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,200
think that's something important for us to keep in mind as we're talking about all of this, is that

277
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,160
the problem really is, is that there's a lot of people out there looking at this going,

278
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:56,840
what the hell's the problem? The game is fine. But then there's other people sitting out there

279
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:04,520
on their base PlayStation 4s, or maybe that don't buy Bethesda games in the past or buy

280
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:11,480
other buggy games that are looking at this going, what the hell is this? I waited eight years for

281
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:18,840
this. And so there's a real disparity there between the groups of where people's expectations

282
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,000
were at. And I think that's why the gaming industry is going to really have a conversation

283
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,520
after this fact about, you know, where's the appropriate place to put expectations? I think

284
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:33,640
that'll be very interesting. I don't know. Anything else you guys want to add to that?

285
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,520
All right. I knocked over my webcam. You knocked over your webcam. We're going on a ride.

286
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:46,040
All right. Just because I'm screwing with crap on my desk. All right. I'm a professional. Should

287
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:52,600
I hide that until you fix it there? Tell me. Nah, I don't care. Okay. All right. Anyway,

288
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:00,680
Meech in chat, one more comment here. People are so ready to give up the moment shit don't pan out

289
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:05,800
the way they want because they're so instant gratification. Let me ask one more question.

290
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,480
Think that the truth. One more question that came to mind since, you know, we've been saying

291
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,760
Bethesda gets away with it. Bethesda, Bethesda, and all this stuff. Well, sometimes they get away

292
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,040
with it. I don't know. The reception of Fallout 76, I don't think it was exactly what they were

293
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,440
looking for. But something- Oh no, they got nailed for that one. Well, here's something very

294
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:28,760
important. Bethesda is no longer, Zenimax is no longer, you know, who owned Bethesda, is no longer

295
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:37,320
an independent thing. Zenimax is part of Microsoft. Microsoft just had the audacity, and I mean that

296
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:43,480
in a good way, actually. Microsoft had the audacity to bump back their biggest first-party

297
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:49,800
title that was supposed to be the highlight of Xbox Series X and S, Halo Infinite, of course.

298
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:57,560
They just bumped that back an entire year, if not maybe more at this point, because it wasn't

299
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:03,480
living up to the quality they expected. Could that be the future of Bethesda now that they are

300
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:10,520
a Microsoft property? What do y'all think of that? Are our joke days of Bethesda done because

301
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:15,720
they're gonna maybe have a different standard now that, you know, different people are at the

302
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:26,280
helm of the organization? Namely, Phil Spencer. We will see, but I think, well, possibly. So,

303
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:33,320
it would have, I would imagine that if they're building a brand new game, like a new,

304
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:40,120
obviously the new Elder Scrolls game in Starfield, it's probably going to be running on a completely

305
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:46,360
new engine. I would hope, I hope they're not repurposing the old engine for that. So that,

306
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,960
I think that was a lot of the problems that they had, especially with like Fallout 76,

307
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,720
is they were using like some of the original engine that they were running,

308
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:01,160
you know, Oblivion or even, I think stuff even older than Oblivion on, and it just kind of adding

309
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:07,720
to it and repurposing it for things it was never meant to do. And so you were running into like

310
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:14,760
bugs that have been in place since those early games. And so I would hope that they're going to

311
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:21,240
start fresh with a new engine to build these new games, because I can't see how these older engines

312
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:29,320
would support something that massive in that detail. So hopefully that will be behind us.

313
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,760
We'll see though, when it comes out. Cause I mean, I don't know.

314
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,240
All right. Let me read a few more comments from chat. Deja Rama S says, you know,

315
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,440
CD Projekt RED basically abandoned Xbox One PlayStation 4 platforms for next gen.

316
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,760
That and upper management demanding a release. It is what it is. And, you know, Rama, I think

317
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,000
a lot that played into that is that there was probably so many pre-orders on that platform that,

318
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,960
and I think this is what the issue really ultimately boils down to is that CD Projekt RED

319
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,320
probably knew they should walk away from those platforms and focus on PC and the next gen,

320
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,640
because things had come so far along in the eight years, but somewhere along the way,

321
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:14,680
somebody in that boardroom said, but we have X number of pre-orders on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

322
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:20,200
If we cancel that, we lose all that. And so somebody made the decision and here's the problem.

323
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,560
Somebody made the decision. Well, we can't have that release it anyway.

324
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,920
That is the problem. It was all down to money.

325
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:35,160
Yes. I mean, just one less little thing. As much as we like to say that some of these

326
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,560
big companies, they care about the gamers. They want us to have fun. They want us to have a good

327
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:47,400
quality product. For a lot of them, it's all about the bottom line. How do I profit off of this?

328
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:54,120
And that's it. A few more comments here. I want to read a comment from Mimsie94 who says,

329
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,280
I don't know if my view on games helps. Hey, every gamer has a voice. All are welcome,

330
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:02,360
but I'm easily pleased with most games and Cyberpunk is a great game to play in my opinion,

331
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,080
but I can only play the playthrough since I can't own any of the gaming systems, but fantastic to

332
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:12,360
watch the playthroughs. Well, don't forget, even if you don't have the newest and greatest systems,

333
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:18,520
Stadia is trying to target folks like you. And that is another way that a lot of people are

334
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,640
enjoying Cyberpunk is through that where you don't necessarily get it on Stadia.

335
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,880
Yeah. Right. Like again, and we kind of got into this last week or the week before is like

336
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:34,440
Stadia's best use case just happened and Google had nothing to do with it.

337
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:40,360
Like, it's like this literally fell in their fucking lap and it's a great thing for them.

338
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:47,320
I got my free Stadia. It arrived. Like, why the hell not should I not try it on that? I mean,

339
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:52,040
I just got a bunch of games actually because they did a bunch of freebies if you have Stadia Pro.

340
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,200
And then I want to get one more comment here from Bobby Blackwolf because this kind of speaks to all

341
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,640
the, you know, buggy and open world and things we were talking about before, who says, the issue is

342
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:08,280
that a lot of bugs are really the byproduct of a huge open world game. Yes, QA can find a lot

343
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:14,200
of things, but there will always be stuff found by players once you let something out. And I'm

344
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:20,920
going to say something very blunt. Why not? It's the holidays. Uncle Rob's going to tell it like

345
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:30,200
it is. This is how you can tell the difference between a podcast, a news organization, a Twitter

346
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,480
account, a group. This is how you can tell the difference. A group that is saying,

347
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:42,120
didn't they test this game? What's happening in QA? What are they doing there? Does CD Project

348
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:48,440
Red even have a QA? The people that are saying that haven't been following this industry a very

349
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,720
long time or don't have insight into this industry. Because you'll notice that phrase

350
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:58,600
hasn't left any of our mouths. And most of you in chat either, none of you have been blaming QA on

351
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:04,280
this. Because I think those of us that have been participating at this table for a while now know,

352
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,760
this isn't the fall of QA. Of course, there's a QA department. Of course, QA told them it was wrong.

353
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:15,160
Go back to what I just said. And this whole thing is that they knew they had pre-orders on Xbox One

354
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:21,320
and PlayStation 4. QA tells them it's broken. Boston Boardroom says, doesn't matter, release

355
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:29,560
it anyway. And that's a story that happens a lot. I liken that to some of those sort of sci-fi

356
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:39,560
movies about, oh, we've done this magic food item, but it will give 0.1% of people rabies.

357
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,000
I'm just throwing that out there. And they released it anyway. And then you have a rabid

358
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,560
population. And then the army has to go in and fight them. And then Will Smith saves the day.

359
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,480
They're just rabid fans of the product now.

360
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,720
All right. And then Bobby had another follow-up comment here. Oh, yes. Because I like this. I like

361
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,920
this little saying here. Bobby says, one of my sayings in software development is that the moment

362
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:09,320
you make something idiot-proof, the world will just build a better idiot. I kind of think that

363
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:14,520
goes hand in hand with the saying, hacker's gonna hack, right? Because that kind of goes... Because

364
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,360
when we talk about oblivion and if it doesn't work, somebody else is going to fix it. And the

365
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:22,600
whole thing, people will figure out ways to work around something like that. Kind of in some ways

366
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:27,800
goes hand in hand with that. I did not call hackers idiots for the record. I'm just saying

367
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:33,080
there are comparisons between those two sayings. I just like the term that you can learn to fail

368
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:39,640
in new and exciting ways. There is that too. Yes. All right. This saga is far from done. So I'm

369
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,200
sorry if you didn't want to hear anything about cyberpunk. Too bad because this story is not

370
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:50,360
going to be done. But think of it this way. This is, again, going to have an impact on the industry.

371
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:56,680
What happens here, others are watching. So let's see where this path leads us. I think it's

372
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:04,840
interesting. And what's interesting, I was very like, eh, on cyberpunk. There are hundreds,

373
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,760
thousands of games that released in a calendar year. I don't have time to play everything.

374
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,520
So I was like, I'll get to cyberpunk when they have the game of the year

375
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,840
edition with all the DLC included and all that stuff. I'll get to it then. That's still where my

376
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:23,400
mind is at. I don't need a day one. And I'm not into a game like that too much. I'm still waiting for

377
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:30,920
Mass Effect. My Mass Effect remaster. Yeah. But I can also still look at it and go, but this shit's

378
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:36,280
fascinating. What's going down here legally, you know, and all that. All right. Anyway,

379
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,600
let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week,

380
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,800
whether it was cyberpunk or not. Dar Sakura, how was your gaming week?

381
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I played Animal Crossing because what else do I do? I play Animal Crossing.

382
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:57,240
We had another good run on Pop and Twinbee. I fucking love Pop and Twinbee. It's like one of my

383
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:04,040
favorite old Super Famicom games. And I've had ROMs of it and everything. So I really, really,

384
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:08,680
really have been playing a decent bit of Pop and Twinbee, but I think I've been doing it under

385
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:17,080
Dan's account by accident. We actually are talking about getting another pinball. We've

386
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,360
kind of floated around if we're going to get a Black Knight Sword of Rage.

387
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:30,840
Believe it or not, we have the animated topper for Black Knight Sword of Rage without owning the

388
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:35,720
table because we bought it for like 500 and something bucks. And now I don't think you can

389
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:41,480
find them for cheaper than like 150. Why did I say 150? 1,500?

390
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,240
I was like, that doesn't sound like a deal, Jamie. Okay.

391
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:53,400
And also my World Cup soccer is going to be coming home. Dan's buddy Brian has been doing some work

392
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:59,480
to it. So I'll get to play my baby again because I love my World Cup soccer pinball. Other than

393
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:09,480
that, I want to come over and play pinball when I get the jab.

394
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:17,320
Actually, Rob, if you're getting regularly tested, I'll submit another test. And if everyone's

395
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,480
clear, you can come over and play pinball. You need to send me the info on your thing

396
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,560
you use because I always have to go get my nose violated.

397
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,520
Well, mine is a nose violation, but I get to violate myself.

398
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,880
We'll talk offline.

399
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:37,480
Yeah, we'll talk offline. Basically, my work doesn't do quest. So at any rate,

400
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,600
okay, Mimsie, you and I are going to have to talk because you're one of my pinball peoples now.

401
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:55,400
So my house is full of pinball. But at any rate, I've got a few things on my downloads now.

402
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,360
I actually bought some stuff off my Steam wishlist thanks to the sale.

403
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:09,960
So like I just picked up a Gencho Night Festival, which is a little platformer that just looks like

404
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:18,040
it was super fun. And I'm also I got what became of Edith Finch on Switch, so I'm going to be

405
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,160
playing through it there. It's a good game. It's a really good game.

406
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:27,720
I'm also getting Umehara Kawase, which is another kind of interesting platformer

407
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:37,240
of a girl with a grappling hook. I'm still debating getting Resident Evil 3. But for

408
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:44,920
right now, there's just enough games out that like I'm also picking up right now the

409
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:50,040
Suicide of Rachel Foster because I love those narrative games. I've really kind of gotten

410
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,680
out of the kind of open world thing unless it's like more of a fantasy environment.

411
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:04,280
And I do, of course, Mass Effect. That's kind of like my speed of game. But I'm really,

412
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:10,200
really loving the narrative games where it may not seem like a game,

413
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:17,880
but it's got a story and it's really something that one can get into.

414
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:23,480
Oh, I'm about to talk about one, and I think it would be one that you'd be into for sure.

415
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,840
I'll get into it in a moment here. But those are absolutely games. We've had this discussion

416
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:34,840
before about the walking simulator and all that. But you know what? If you are to call the Black

417
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:39,720
Mirror episode on Netflix a game, which the name escapes me right now, whatever the name of that

418
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,560
game was in the episode. Bandersnatch.

419
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:47,640
Thank you, Bandersnatch. If that's a game, then these are certainly games. There's lots of

420
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:55,880
choice and things to go back and revisit. I guess I'll get into it in a minute. But I don't like

421
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,600
when people try to dismiss the narrative games. I really don't. They're games. They're games of a

422
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:08,680
different type. Look at Atari 2600 games. It was usually push button, go ping. There's the most

423
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:15,240
basic thing. Pong. Beep, boop, beep, boop. If that's a game, then why can't a narrative experience

424
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:24,760
be a game? Anyway. Yeah. But at any rate, I have a bunch of stuff that I just really want to sit

425
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:30,360
down. I have another game called When the Past Was Around that I want to sit and play. I finally

426
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:36,520
though bought... I have Wattam now that it's on Steam. And I'm going to be streaming Hive Swap

427
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:44,040
probably in the next couple of weeks. So there's stuff on my plate with plans to actually do stuff.

428
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:50,680
It's just right now the end of the year business. But I am going to be streaming Hive Swap Act 2

429
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:56,920
because in my heart of hearts, I am still a Homestuck. All right. Well, let's move on and go

430
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:03,080
to Loki. How was your gaming week? I tried working on my game most of the week. So I've been trying

431
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:09,720
to... Still trying to code something to do anime tiles. I was trying to do it the right way and

432
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,360
it's not working. Which I try to... Just a heads up, if you've been out for a few weeks,

433
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:19,640
we now know that Loki's game is a spiritual successor of shorts called To Pixel Poops

434
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,880
on the NES. Him and YYR had a big press announcement a couple of weeks ago. Anyway,

435
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:28,840
sorry. Yeah. Just to catch up the people who might be behind. Right, right, right. So I've been

436
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:36,680
working on that. So I'm doing what like plan C now in which it's going to be basically using

437
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,960
techniques that I already use to switch tiles out for when I do like the actual

438
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:51,240
pooping in the game. So that works, I know. So it's just not the most elegant way I'd like to

439
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:57,240
do it, but I'm going to try it and see if it works and how the performance is. And so this

440
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:01,720
is really my last attempt to get it to work because otherwise I've spent way too long on

441
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:06,040
trying to get it to work. I do want it to work because it looks nice when it does work.

442
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:15,000
It just takes a lot to get it to work. So that's when I'm finishing up hopefully this week.

443
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:23,640
And then I would like to have a demo available at some time soon. I would hopefully like to

444
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,720
get done before the end of the year, but we'll see. But that'd be kind of cool if I could do

445
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:34,760
that. But actual game playing. So I did play more Minecraft this week. I spent an unreasonably long

446
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:41,880
amount of time making an automated bee farm. Yes, with a bee statue over the top. So you can get

447
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:52,040
honeycomb blocks and honey bottles. So it's an automated bee farm. They go in there and they

448
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,880
make honey for you and it just automatically collects it. So that was kind of fun. It was

449
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,960
a relaxing thing to do. And then my kids have been trying to get me to play

450
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:10,360
more stuff with them with Minecraft. So I've been doing some stuff. My kid will make a level and

451
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:15,720
wants to do like a little scenario. And so we did that for a few hours. So it's been mainly

452
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:20,680
Minecraft this week. A little bit of Orna as I've been traveling around just taking over areas and

453
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:28,120
stuff like that. I wish I could take over more areas like just like out like if I could see it,

454
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,400
I should be able to take over it. But I know there's only a certain radius that you can do

455
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:37,000
that. So that kind of sucks. But I've just been playing a bit more of that. Still not leveling

456
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,040
up very fast at all. I'm still like 182. The leveling curve gets like exponential. It's kind

457
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:46,200
of like Pokemon Go in that regard. Even though we're talking about, oh, we're level 180, we're

458
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,840
level 100. It doesn't take that long if you're a little bit dedicated to get to three digit levels.

459
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:56,840
But then once you start hitting about level 180, the XP curve goes up exponentially and it takes

460
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:02,600
longer and longer for each level, for sure. Yeah. And you don't get new enemies until I think

461
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:09,960
every 25 levels. So you'll get them at 200. So it's going to be a while. So, yeah, it's just

462
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:15,400
been kind of grinding that a little bit. And that's about it. I didn't play any more cyberpunk

463
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:21,640
yet, although I probably will at some point. And I need to definitely go back to my Xbox Series X

464
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:28,600
because it's sitting there collecting dust. But yeah, so eventually get to that stuff. But I mean,

465
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:36,280
I can't think of any games in 2021 that I'm necessarily anticipating yet. So I've got time.

466
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:44,440
Okay. Mike gave me a week. So speaking of GPS based games, I've been playing a lot of Angers

467
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:50,120
this past week. I kind of took a break for a few weeks and maybe it's one of those things

468
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:55,160
where taking a break was good because it kind of got me motivated again. And I hit maximum level

469
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:00,600
in the game for the second time. So I got all the way to level 16, which is max level for the second

470
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:07,640
time. And so of course I pushed the button to restart for a third time. And I worked pretty

471
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:11,960
fast to get right back up to level eight because you have to be level eight in the game to use the

472
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,280
highest gear. So I kind of already had things planned out in my head. I was like, because they

473
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:21,640
have these things called apexes now, which are sold in the shop, but you get them free during

474
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:25,480
events and things like that. So I had like 10 or 11 of them built up. So I was like, all right,

475
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,640
I'm going to go downtown. I'm going to go to the cemetery. I'm going to just microfield the whole

476
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:33,960
thing fast and burn an apex. And I do it. And that's what I did. And I was back to level eight

477
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:39,480
within maybe two hours of gameplay. So I just, just, you know, thinking my strategy through on

478
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:44,760
how I was going to do it and it worked out. So that was my big GPS game nerd conquer thing of

479
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,000
the week. Um, but it's, I find that it's been kind of a fun thing to do because it gets me out

480
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,000
of the house. I can sit in my car, listen to podcasts or music or whatever, do some driving.

481
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,120
So at least I feel like I'm moving and it's safe. I'm in my little protected bubble, literal iron

482
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:04,760
bubble that's on the road and playing my little game and still getting to see things. So that's

483
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:10,360
kind of, I think why I've been kind of into it right now. Um, so other things that I've been up

484
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:14,200
to, uh, the game I was talking about with dark soccer. So I played a new game this week, uh,

485
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:19,560
because of Xbox game pass. I started playing a game called tell me why, uh, which came out,

486
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:24,040
I think back in September. Uh, it's an X, it's an Xbox game studios game. Yeah. I finally got

487
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,560
around to it. You know, just, it was like, Oh, I should play that. I was kind of looking for

488
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,440
something new to play and I'd heard a lot of things about it. A lot of people on Twitter

489
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:35,240
had spoken very favorite favoritively of it. And so I started playing it. Um, it is, it is

490
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:40,760
a narrative based game. It's a very story heavy based games. Uh, it, it involves a series of,

491
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:46,520
it involves twins and they have these kind of like special powers where they can kind of talk

492
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:50,360
to each other without actually talking to each other. Like, you know, that, that some people

493
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:55,000
kind of perceive about twins or, or maybe that really is a thing. I don't know. But, uh, that,

494
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,840
that kind of ends up being kind of central to the plot. Uh, I don't want to get too much into

495
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:04,040
the plot because I just kind of like started it right off the bat and I was really like taken

496
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:10,280
aback. I was like, Whoa, I didn't know this game was that fucking dark that quickly. Like it's,

497
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:16,920
it's kind of like, uh, I don't know if I want to say scary, but it's, uh, um, like, Oh, this is

498
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:22,040
heavy stuff. I think heavy stuff, I think is a good way to say it. Uh, and it's kind of starts

499
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:26,680
off right that way. And, um, you know, you just kind of then, then of course the story is just

500
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:31,720
kind of like peeling back the layers of an onion. It gets deeper and deeper and you kind of start

501
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:36,760
to learn about the character. What was, what was going on here? What was this thing? What did,

502
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,960
was she, was she, was she good? Was she not good? There's all these weird things going on. So, um,

503
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,680
yeah, unsettling is a good way to put it too. Um, dark soccer, I do think a game like this

504
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:51,240
would be up your alley. Um, there's been a lot of talk of this game as well. You may have heard

505
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:57,000
of this game because it focuses, uh, there's a lot of, um, uh, the, the, one of the twins,

506
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:03,880
um, is a trans man. So there's a lot of talk about, um, transgender in the game because it does

507
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:10,440
end up, um, be it's, it's kind of, how do I say this without it's, it's a plot device,

508
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:18,360
but not in poor taste. Like they, they actually, the trans man is voiced by a trans man actor.

509
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:25,320
They had consultants on the game to make sure they got it right. But that whole experience is

510
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:31,480
kind of integral to the plot. So I thought it was, it's, it's an interesting way to kind of,

511
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:39,640
I found it was really fascinating because since you are playing some of the game as, um, and now

512
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:46,200
I can't remember the character's names. There's Allison, Tyler, Allison and Tyler. That's it. So

513
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,760
Tyler is, and that's not really a spoiler. You find that out very, very, very, very, very early

514
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:56,520
on within the first 10 minutes, probably. Um, Tyler is, um, a trans man. And since you are

515
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:06,200
forced to play some of the game as Tyler, you get exposed to some of those awkward experiences where,

516
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:11,240
and there was a really, like, I'll just say it was a flat out like awkward thing that happened

517
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:18,600
is that you meet one of the villagers who knew you as a child when, you know, before, um, the,

518
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:23,640
before transitioning and all that. And there's that very awkward conversation that happens

519
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,400
about, you know, where the, the guy is kind of putting his foot in his mouth and it's,

520
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:32,360
it's one of those like, well, you got to forgive me because I'm older and we can't follow all your

521
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:37,480
new way. You know, that whole thing. So it was weird. Yes. But I'm ready to be pissed off,

522
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:41,000
but then I thought that's good. But you know what? I mean, not pissed off at the game,

523
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,640
but pissed off in game. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I get it. I get it. But I thought it was interesting

524
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:54,520
because that was deaf. That was definitely a way to illustrate an experience through the art of

525
00:50:54,520 --> 00:51:01,960
video games without necessarily having to be beat over the head with a shoe with it. Does that make

526
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:10,760
sense? Like by even as awkward as that exchange was, I think it illustrated a very real thing

527
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:14,520
that I think a lot of trans people have been trying to say, this is, this is, this is why

528
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:19,640
we have challenges. This is some of the BS that we go through. And they were really able to

529
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:26,200
illustrate that through the game. And I thought that was really neat. So yeah, I think the game

530
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:32,360
is pretty cool. I'm not, it's in three parts and I'm like, I don't know how far I am because I

531
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:37,640
refuse to read spoilers on it. So I would guess I've got to be close to the end of the first part

532
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:42,760
because each part is only supposed to be like two or three hours. And I've, I swear to God,

533
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,840
I feel like I've been playing part one for three hours, but I'm also the type that's like,

534
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:54,360
I have to check every item and read everything and solve every puzzle. So maybe I'm just slow.

535
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,560
All the things.

536
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:05,160
So anyway, yeah, yeah. So, um, yeah, I saw, yeah, I, I thought that was a, a, a neat game and just,

537
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:12,280
I, I, but I will say, and I'll warn you the way I wasn't warned. The subject matter is a lot darker

538
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:18,040
than I was anticipating. And that's actually, that's nothing to do with, with the trans part

539
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:23,000
of it. It just happens to be that the character is, you know, a trans man and his twin sister.

540
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:29,400
That's just another element of the story. So. Yeah, it was, I, I, I, I want to finish more

541
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:35,560
before I absolutely say I recommend it or I don't recommend it. Um, but so far I'm feeling I, I,

542
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:39,480
so far I've enjoyed the first two, three hours I've played. So I feel like that's a leaning

543
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:45,720
towards a positive recommendation. So, well, I just bought it. So there you go. I mean,

544
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,240
I don't know if I'm going to get a chance to play it and I'm probably going to get yelled at,

545
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:57,400
but I bought it. There you go. Oh, very good point. See a Tiberian chat over Twitch TV slash

546
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:03,160
vlog network says it also has a lot about indigenous cultures in this fictional area

547
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:07,800
of Alaska. You're right. It gets into some of that as well. I don't think I'm like heavy,

548
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:13,160
maybe into some of those storylines and things yet, but I have noticed that for sure. There's

549
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:17,800
like decorations and things in the house that they come across and stuff like that. So, um,

550
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:24,360
I'm curious to see more of how that kind of unfolds and develops. So, um, yeah. So there's

551
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:29,800
that, um, if my shirt that I'm wearing on Twitch with Fennekin on it is any indication, of course,

552
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:34,760
I've been continuing to play Pokemon, uh, sword and shield, which Fennekin isn't in, but I've

553
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:41,240
been working on my decks, uh, in those games and I'm up past 300. I'm up to like 320 something.

554
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:44,920
I think in my short sword and shield decks. So I'm getting closer, I'm getting down. I did a

555
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:51,640
lot of trades with, um, Shane this past week. So like I got the Zastian in my decks and I got the,

556
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:57,640
um, the thing like, uh, you have to trade, um, Machomp to get Machoke or did I get that backwards,

557
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,000
but y'all know what I mean? You know, you have to trade certain things. So we did some of that.

558
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,840
And that was like, I had to check off like 12, 13 things off the list there. So that was,

559
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:09,560
uh, that was good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, yeah, I've been enjoying Pokemon.

560
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,680
I don't think I'm going to get back into Pokemon, uh, anytime soon.

561
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:17,800
You never, you know what? It just like, for me, it just fucking clicked one day. I just,

562
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,960
and I think I was talking about Pokemon go and Pokemon home and all of that just suddenly made

563
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:27,320
me go, well, you know what guys, I'm going to catch them all. I'm going to finally do it. I'm

564
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:32,760
going to go catch them all. And it's, it's a, it's a thing to do now that, you know, quarantine and

565
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,040
COVID and all that crap's going on. Um, and I'm trying to think if there's anything else in my

566
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:40,280
game a week, I feel like there's one other game. I played a little more destiny to, uh, still been

567
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:45,480
playing that, uh, joined a clan of Twitter people. Cause I guess our VOG network clan,

568
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:51,240
like officially got killed because of inactivity. Oops. Uh, so I joined a clan with Twitter people.

569
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:57,640
Um, and I don't remember, uh, what else notable that I did in that game yet. I think I still have

570
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:02,680
to do a fire strike and I'm nervous about being, uh, going in there to do all that thing. So

571
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:07,960
there's that. All right. Um, let's see, we're going to get into, so that's it for my gaming

572
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:12,360
week. Let's get into gaming news first, before we get to gaming news, I actually have a couple

573
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:17,640
like housekeeping things to talk about. Um, number one, and Bobby said this in chat, um, but I'll

574
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:23,000
reemphasize it here during our little housekeeping segment is that, um, next week we will still be

575
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,640
here during OLR. Um, we're not going to like hold the show or anything, but I should point out that

576
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:34,280
awesome games done quick. Um, the big charity event, uh, does start next Sunday. Um, and VOG

577
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:38,520
network's own Bobby Black Wolf is now a part of that event. So for the second time, he's going to

578
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:42,840
be one of the announcers during that event. And he went over the whole schedule on his show. And of

579
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:50,040
course in the moment, I can't remember everything. I know Devil May Cry 5 was one of the games,

580
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:56,200
uh, in there. Uh, and then he had, um, did he get the Kings? I can't remember. He says Wednesday and

581
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,720
Friday night. Thank you. Wednesday and Friday night. Sorry. When I'm put on the spot, I can't,

582
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:03,800
I just go blank. Um, but he's actually gonna be doing some of the hosting. So that's exciting.

583
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,720
Thank you. Devil May Cry 3, Yoshi's Island and Yakuza 6. That's it. Thank you. Thank you. Those

584
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:11,880
are the games he's going to be hosting. So we'll be checking that out Wednesday and Friday night.

585
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:20,040
Um, but, uh, I, that all starts on Sunday. So check it out. Um, remember it's about the charity.

586
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:24,440
So if you're going to donate to try to get Bobby Black Wolf to read your shout out and you can

587
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:30,760
listen to his show for more details on how that works. Um, but, um, just like I've learned that

588
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:37,080
I can't say Mr. Smoosh donated 50 bucks because the screeners don't know what Mr. Smoosh is. And

589
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:41,960
so they assume it's porn, which they have to do. They have to do. So I'll have to take a different

590
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:47,800
approach, um, next time. So maybe you could do Mr. Smoosh, the cat. Yeah. I think that's what I'm

591
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,720
going to do is next time. Well, I shouldn't say this so openly as I'm trying to surprise Bobby,

592
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:56,600
but I'll say me and my cat, Mr. Smoosh are watching. And I say, keep up the good work.

593
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:04,200
And Mr. Smoosh says meow meow and that maybe something like that. Yeah. My bowl is empty.

594
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:13,320
Feed me. So anyway, she for once is not in here harassing me. You could check that out. Uh, Bobby

595
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:17,080
has more details on all of that. If you want some insight on how all that works, that's all on his

596
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:20,680
show, the Bobby Black Wolf show. So check that out during awesome games done quick. Um, another

597
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:26,920
housekeeping thing, this, this kind of, cause this is the last show of 2020, right? So next week,

598
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:31,800
we're going to go into 2021. And you know, I was watching a friend of mine was doing a Twitch

599
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:36,840
stream, somebody who, who watches, um, the, the stuff here at a VOG network. I'll say it was act

600
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:41,960
deaf. I was watching a stream of his and, um, you know, kind of the subject came up about how

601
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:47,000
this show has been going for 18 and a half years. That's a very long time.

602
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,120
There's not a lot of shows that do something like that. And, um, this has been a year that's

603
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:57,320
really old record. This has been a year that's really challenged us in many ways, right? Like,

604
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:02,680
you know, that I pride this show on, you know, cause people ask like, how have you kept the

605
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:06,680
show going on so long? How do you guys find the motivation for the show? And my answer has kind

606
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:10,360
of always been, well, you know, Dark Soccer, Logie, myself, it's kind of our excuse to get

607
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:14,200
together every week. We get together in person and we, you know, get to hang out. We do this

608
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,960
little show and people listen and it's a good time. And I think we've kind of been writing

609
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:24,600
that energy, but 2020 and all of its events have really kind of made us rethink some of that

610
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:28,920
because I've always kind of sat here and gone, we're not going to go to an all virtual show

611
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:36,680
because that's every other podcast does that. We only got a special thing, lol. 2020 had other

612
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:40,840
plans in store and we've gone to a virtual format. And I would say for the most part, it's worked.

613
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:45,160
Now this isn't me about to announce that like, we're going to virtual forever or anything like

614
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:50,200
that. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that I don't know. Nobody does. Cause we don't know

615
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,360
where these roads are leading into 2021. We hope, you know, there's light at the end of the tunnel

616
00:58:54,360 --> 00:59:03,160
and all that. But I think it's really cool that 2020 threw these curve balls at us. And we were

617
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:07,640
able to kind of rise up to that and keep this show going. And that, of course, that's not just me.

618
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:12,520
That's huge. Thanks to Dark Sakura and Loki as well. I mean, Dark Sakura, shit. She might've

619
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:17,960
had COVID in those early episodes. Like not to make light of it, but you documented it.

620
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:23,160
But my blood test says I didn't. But then again, they're also like,

621
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:27,880
oh, and half of the people don't develop antibodies and I'm like, thanks bitch.

622
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:35,080
Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, and then I had it, I had it twice or it was really pneumonia.

623
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:40,440
And we know one of the guests we bring on this show all the time, Shane had COVID. He said that

624
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:45,720
on the show. It's not a secret. And I talked about that because I just went to visit him.

625
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,880
I was basically exposed now to get a test and I was negative and all that. But I mean,

626
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:54,120
obviously that whole issue has hit close to home here at OLR one way or another.

627
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:58,840
I've lost two friends this past year. Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. I think, I think

628
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:05,960
if we don't all know somebody directly, we know somebody who's been impacted. I can certainly say

629
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:12,120
that for sure. And I almost didn't get to see my dad before he died. I mean, yeah, he's in Alabama,

630
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:19,160
3000 miles away. But when his test came back negative, one of the nurses pulled some strings

631
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:26,760
for my sister and got him a private room and said that, that she and my mother, I mean, my mom and

632
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:33,800
dad had been divorced since I was, you know, nine months old, but but my mom was in there too. And

633
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:41,160
they let them in to have two one hour sessions. And the first session was when dad woke up enough

634
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:48,440
to, they actually took him off the morphine long enough for him to see me on the phone and wave and

635
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:56,360
try to say something. And then the next time I saw him on a phone stream, he was dead three hours

636
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:05,240
later. So and I almost didn't get that because of COVID. But, you know, his test came back negative

637
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:09,720
and they pulled some strings. Well, thank gosh, you got that at least. I mean, obviously that's a,

638
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:14,200
you know, terrible scenario. And I'm sorry that that happened. But, you know, at least there was

639
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:19,400
that little light that like, at least you got a chance to, you know, communicate in one way or

640
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:24,200
another. So that is far more than a lot of people have gotten. That's right. One of my friends right

641
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:31,880
now, her aunt had a stroke and can't be seen by anybody. That was my dad. That was my dad this

642
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:39,080
summer had that. Her aunt went nonverbal and half paralyzed. So there's no one who can be there with

643
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:46,680
her and help her with her affairs or help with consent or anything. So, you know, and all these

644
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:52,680
people who are like that one Karen that they had in that was CVS or something arguing about not

645
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:58,920
wearing her mask. I can't those people. I can't even watch those videos anymore. I just can't

646
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:04,840
with something hard and sandpapery. And my dad made a virtual full recovery for the record.

647
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:08,520
He got very lucky in that regard. So thank you. I'm really happy about that. Thank you,

648
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:14,440
everybody who is thinking through the good guy. Yeah, well, he does have some lingering things

649
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:19,400
like he clears his throat a lot more. I know it's a weird thing and he coughs. So we're always kind

650
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:25,640
of like, is it the COVID? Is it COVID? But it's not. It's just some weird lingering thing that's

651
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:30,840
kind of sitting there. You know what I mean? So anyway, let me get you some more positive vibes

652
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:36,200
from our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network where SSJ100 Matt says, I would like to say thank

653
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:41,880
you for all the vog hosts for getting us through this crummy year of 2020. Well, thank you so much

654
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:45,720
for saying that, because honestly, you know, I can't totally speak for dark soccer and Loki,

655
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:53,160
but I know for me, the reverse is true for me, like you guys being here on Sunday night gives

656
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:56,920
me some and throughout the week on the podcast and all that your feedback, emails, tweets and

657
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:01,720
all that. It gives me something to look forward to throughout this shithole of the year. You know

658
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:09,080
what I mean? Right. Like it gives me a sense of at least I got this one thing I can look forward to,

659
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:15,080
you know, happy hour at Chili's. Nope. Don't get that. But at least I've got happy hour at OLR,

660
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:21,480
you know? So exactly. It's given me that. So thank you guys for that. I really, really give us life

661
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:28,280
for sure. For sure. Okay. Um, let's get into, let's get into the video game news. We're really

662
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:31,800
here for it. But I just kind of wanted to acknowledge that is that like, despite the fact

663
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:36,440
that we had a shitty year, we've had some curveballs. We did something I said we were

664
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:43,480
never going to do. Not that that's ever happened on OLR before. And we and we made it and we're

665
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:48,120
okay. So and big thanks to dark soccer and Loki for navigating these tricky waters. Of course,

666
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:53,480
I couldn't do it without you guys. Because people say, how have you gone for 18 years? And it's the

667
01:03:53,480 --> 01:04:00,360
it's it's all of us. It's not just one of us. We've all done it, you know? Yeah. So and it's

668
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:06,920
it's our thing. Although I really do think maybe we should contact Guinness. Maybe is is perfectly

669
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:10,520
normal. And this goes back to the original point I had been talking about with Act F.

670
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:17,720
It is perfectly normal for shows to rotate hosts and have new people. And, you know,

671
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:21,800
somebody gets burned out. So somebody new comes in or somebody else gets an opportunity. Somebody

672
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:26,760
new comes in. Look at the look at the view, for fuck's sake, which is probably been going

673
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:32,360
about as long as this show. How many women have been on that show? A ton, right? And there's lots

674
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:37,720
of podcasts out there where that's the case. But then and I was telling Act F, we're the weird ones.

675
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:42,520
We're the weird ones because we haven't changed in 18 and a half years. And I wouldn't have it

676
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:50,680
any other way. Rotate right now. This chair spins. Yes. Coming to you next week, your new co-host

677
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:58,040
Sabol is going to be hosting the show. Okay. Forget it. All right. Let's move on. Let's get

678
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:00,920
into video games. That's what we're here to talk about the gaming community. Loki,

679
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:06,600
give us some news, please. So we talked about one of the frustrations before with the PlayStation 5

680
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:11,560
was playing some of these games that you may own. You're not sure which version of the game you're

681
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:17,000
actually loading up and playing. I think we're like Spider-Man, Destiny and stuff like that.

682
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,360
There was issues where you have to download multiple copies and stuff like that. Well, now,

683
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:26,120
thanks to an update, they have a brand new confirmed game version pop up that happens

684
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:31,800
when you load a multi-generation game that allows you to choose to play the PlayStation 4 version

685
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:38,520
or to switch to the PlayStation 5 version. Which definitely helps with the confusion there and

686
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:44,440
why you would ever choose to play the PlayStation 4 version for whatever reason on a PlayStation 5.

687
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:49,560
I don't know, but it does. They're giving you the option to do that, but at least it kind of

688
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:56,760
eliminates that confusion that may happen with that. So that's kind of nice. I don't know if

689
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:02,280
that necessarily prevents you from having to install multiple versions of a game, but

690
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:06,040
if they have something similar, if they have something similar like that on the storefront,

691
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:10,200
you know, the pick which version you want to install, that'd be pretty helpful as well.

692
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:16,840
PS5 owners, do you guys have insight on that? Like, did this fix the installs both issue?

693
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,680
Because even Bobby's kind of pointing out, I had a monologue about this issue. No Man's Sky

694
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:25,640
defaulted to the PS4 version when I put the disc in. And yeah, of course, why do I want to play

695
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:30,200
the old one? I mean, there might be a reason why you want to go back to the old one, maybe a

696
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:36,200
feature, I don't know, something. But for the most part, people want to play the new one. That's true

697
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:41,320
in the Xbox world, that's for sure. It is still a work in progress. Like the article is talking

698
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:47,640
about that, you know, it didn't it worked in Destiny 2, but you didn't see the pop up in

699
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:54,200
Watchdog legions only until they went to manually install the upgraded PlayStation 5 version. Did

700
01:06:54,200 --> 01:07:01,480
they get the warning to play the PlayStation 5 version versus the PlayStation 4? So I guess,

701
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:07,720
no, it does not, you know, address the multiple installs, but at least they'll know when you're

702
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:13,240
playing the wrong version. They really should just have an option to download which version you want,

703
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:19,240
or just, you know, hey, it's a PlayStation 5. You know, I'm upgrading to the PlayStation 5 version,

704
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:24,120
you know, once that's available, and then, hey, would you like to install the PlayStation 4 version?

705
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:29,080
You know, that would be nice to have that option on there so that you're not filling up your very

706
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:35,800
limited hard drive. Bobby does point out No Man's Sky VR is only in the PlayStation 4 version,

707
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:40,520
so there's an excellent illustration. Sometimes the PlayStation 4 may have something that the

708
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:45,880
PS5 doesn't have yet. Sorry, Jamie. I guess that makes sense. If you're moving files, you know,

709
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:51,480
you have, do you want to replace this? Do you want to copy? Yeah, so they have the choice. Yes,

710
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:56,280
right. Yeah, but why doesn't the PlayStation 5 version have VR? I mean,

711
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:04,760
great question. Well, do you want it to be pretty or do you want VR? I mean,

712
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:09,400
pick one. Well, PS5, we all know. That's not necessarily true. Joking, joking, joking.

713
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:17,720
Just like, you know, with, you know, anything, even like with the PlayStation 4 Pro and stuff,

714
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:24,360
they had options where you can pick, and I'm sure the same is with Spider-Man and stuff like that,

715
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:30,600
where you can pick multiple options. So like you have, you know, the ray tracing 60 FPS,

716
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:35,320
but your resolution slightly reduced, or you can do the full resolution of ray tracing,

717
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:39,640
but your frame rate slightly reduced, or you can just turn off ray tracing and just have,

718
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:45,400
you know, the 4K and, you know, 120 FPS or whatever the case may be with that. I don't

719
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:49,480
know the resolution on that. So why not just have that option there? It's like,

720
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:54,040
Hey, I see you're playing on VR. We're going to pipe this through a 1080.

721
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:58,440
And hold on. Cause I said something about it. Yeah. And this is, this is important too,

722
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:03,560
is that, and Bobby does say in chat, PSVR is not native to the PS5. It won't be native to

723
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:08,760
the PS5 until 2022. They decided the market for PSVR wasn't there to put it on the PS5

724
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:12,440
natively at launch, but they still support it in backwards compatibility mode, right?

725
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:16,200
Because we had those adapters that you could, you know, contact Sony and you get the adapters for

726
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:23,400
free. So, and even before Bobby said that I was going to say, um, there, we know PSVR is coming

727
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:28,440
to the PlayStation 5. It's just not here yet without the adaptor. Forget what it is.

728
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,640
And here's the thing, here's the thing as much as you might kind of tease Sony about the whole

729
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:40,600
weird VR issue in a sense, I kind of get it because imagine if they had put out PSVR with

730
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:47,480
the PlayStation 5, I mean, number one, PlayStation fives are hard enough to get. Can you imagine,

731
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:52,200
you know, now throw a VR unit into that and how, how hard is that going to be to get with the

732
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:57,720
production? And then on the other hand. Okay. So you're going to buy a $500 console. And then on

733
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:03,560
top of that, a $300, $400 headset, they're going to ask you to buy that day one. Hell no.

734
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,840
In a pandemic where people are unemployed. Yeah. Throw that out there too.

735
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:12,360
People aren't going to do it right. There will be some right, Bobby, there'll be some that would do

736
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:18,920
it. But I think for the most part, the market in general is not ready for that kind of ask

737
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:24,360
for another couple of years, because now when we come into 2022, it'll be, oh, okay. It's,

738
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,720
it's been two years since you've dropped your, you know, 500 on the console.

739
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:33,480
Now we want to sell you this three, $400, uh, VR headset or what have you. That's,

740
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:38,680
that's the long game Sony's planning. There's no way they could have asked you for 500 bucks twice

741
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,880
this year, whatever it is. Yeah. So that, that's what it really is. Anyway,

742
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:44,840
we kind of got off the path of what the story was about, but that's all right.

743
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:54,920
All right. So it it's, um, it's at least something right now, kind of a bandaid for the situation,

744
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:59,880
but it's not perfect. I don't know if the way they have everything set up right now is perfect

745
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:04,520
anyways, but obviously that's a problem that sort of goes away as time progresses.

746
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:10,520
PlayStation's also been very good about like huge firmware updates on their end. So like I,

747
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:15,000
and you know, I don't have a PlayStation five right now. I probably will get one next year.

748
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,080
Um, in fact, knowing that VR will be a thing in two years, I should probably get my PlayStation

749
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:23,560
next year, not wait two years to get it. I w I don't see myself being able to wait that long

750
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:29,240
anyway. Um, but, uh, you know, by the time I get it next year, I feel like the firmware is going

751
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:32,920
to be in a place where like, none of this is even going to be under discussion anymore.

752
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:36,120
Like it's going to be a lot smoother and all that good stuff.

753
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:40,360
We're waiting for next year anyway, before we decide which one we may or may not get.

754
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:47,080
I think there's a lot of people waiting for next year, period, just for everything, you know?

755
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,040
Yeah, pretty much.

756
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:54,120
Well, hopefully next year won't be the, you know, the, the, the floating dumpster fire this year

757
01:11:54,120 --> 01:12:00,280
was. I honestly, truly don't think it will be. And then granted, I've been stupidly optimistic

758
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:06,280
throughout this whole thing, but I really do think like, for, for, for a lot of us,

759
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:11,240
uh, there will be a way out of this situation pretty, pretty soon. Well, relatively soon,

760
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:16,600
four or five, six months, it's going to be some other people and, you know, that are gonna,

761
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:20,600
you know, make this still a headline for a long time, unfortunately.

762
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:21,180
Yeah.

763
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:24,200
But I'll, but I'll be able to go to your house and play pinball.

764
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:31,560
Yes. Yes. A lot, all the pinballs are, well, I don't know, Dan's got stuff sitting on top

765
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:34,200
of my theater of magic right now, and I'm kind of mad about it.

766
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:39,560
Uh oh. All right. Let's move on. Let's talk about our next story, which has to do with,

767
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:43,320
well, this, this is something that's going to make people sad about 2021.

768
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,000
Not me.

769
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:45,500
Yeah, I know.

770
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,080
That's true. Not Jamie.

771
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:49,720
Not me.

772
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:54,360
There's a halo joke there. Okay. So this is about halo. Here's the deal. So a pretty big,

773
01:12:54,360 --> 01:13:00,920
uh, bombshell was announced this past week, uh, where halo is going to be ending their online

774
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:09,800
services in December of 2021, meaning the halo games that were for the Xbox 360 original Xbox

775
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:14,200
actually already ended some time ago. You may or may not have remembered that, but the Xbox

776
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:21,880
360 games, and there's a lot of them, halo reach halo for halo three halo three ODST halo combat

777
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:27,160
evolved anniversary, Spartan assault, halo wars, all of those games being sunsetted,

778
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:32,680
but you have a whole year to enjoy what you've got. Okay. So December, 2021 is when those are

779
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:41,080
going away. Now some clarity on this. If I am playing the games in backward compatibility mode

780
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:46,760
on my Xbox one or Xbox series X, will I no longer to be able to play online? And the answer is

781
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:51,400
you will no longer be able to play online, even in backwards compatibility mode. Okay. Because,

782
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:56,600
uh, it is actually those three 60 games and their servers that are going away very similar to the,

783
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:02,280
uh, OG halo and halo two. When the original Xbox went away, you can, you can play a rich,

784
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:07,720
some original Xbox games, including halo on the series X. That's, what's pretty rad about the

785
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:12,520
Microsoft landscape right now, but you can't play it online. Sorry to say, because the servers are

786
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:18,520
gone and that's going to be the same case with these games. Now, what it won't impact is, and

787
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:26,520
here's, here's kind of the aha moment, the master chief collection, which includes halo, halo two,

788
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:31,800
halo three, halo four, and probably eventually pretty much everything I just named over there,

789
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:35,320
save maybe the tactical actually, no, I think one of those tactical games already in there,

790
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:41,880
but anyway, the halo master chief collection, that is not affected. That is technically an Xbox

791
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:46,040
one title. And so the servers fat. So if you want to play halo two, you have to do it through the

792
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:49,800
master chief collection, and that's how you're going to be able to do it moving forward. So

793
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:55,640
that's what you have as opposed to the master chef collection, which I consistently typoed it.

794
01:14:56,360 --> 01:15:04,600
Um, now, uh, so that, you know, and considering a lot of Microsoft people are on game pass right now

795
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:10,360
and the master chief collection is with game pass, or you probably bought an Xbox one when

796
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:15,880
the master chief collection was included. I know I did, um, this, that, that's what you've got. And

797
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:21,080
that game is still going, uh, and no plans to end that there. So I do think it's, it's interesting.

798
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:25,560
I mean, there is that moment of, oh, memories with halo three and stuff like that, you know,

799
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:30,600
in some of these other games, but it's like, eh, is it halo three came out in what, like 2006?

800
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:35,160
Like it's a, it's an old game, you know, so I'm not terribly surprised.

801
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:40,360
Say they didn't support their titles. So yeah, this isn't an EA situation. What's that?

802
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:47,720
Remember when I got married and you came to my bachelorette party? Yes. Dan was having a halo

803
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:55,640
two land party. Oh yeah. Good times. Yeah. Um, with what we, they had like eight Xboxes hooked up

804
01:15:55,640 --> 01:16:03,480
to eight CRT TVs in my house. And, and then I think halo three was just on the horizon

805
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:08,760
after that. So it's been a while. Uh, and Mimsie 94 in chat says they better try remasters,

806
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:14,040
those games, dammit for what it's worth. I think ODST is in the master chief collection now.

807
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:17,640
And that is, that is it. So the master chief collection is the remasters. You can play those

808
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:24,040
in 4k and that's on PC and it's on Xbox one and series X. Um, and if you have game pass,

809
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:28,280
it's, it's a big part of it. Cause obviously that's Microsoft's big thing. So yeah. I mean,

810
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:32,760
as, as much of a bummer as this news is, at least they're giving a full year's notice.

811
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:37,480
So you got a whole year to party hard. Um, and uh, also what I think is interesting,

812
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:45,320
what they list in phase two. So right now, as of December, 2020 halo Xbox three 60 DLC can still

813
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:50,200
be acquired at no cost. I think that's all kind of included in master chief collection anyway.

814
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:53,880
So maybe most people didn't notice this, but if for whatever reason you want to go play

815
01:16:54,760 --> 01:17:00,520
the old 360 versions, the DLC is there for the taken now. So you get a whole year to party hard

816
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:04,920
and then they're going to pull the plug, but they haven't said exactly what day they just,

817
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:11,480
it's that vague December, 2021, but no sooner than one year from the date of the blog,

818
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:17,160
which was December 21st. So maybe for Christmas, that's what you get for Christmas. The plug's

819
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:24,120
going to get pulled. No, I would, I would assume, I would assume December 31st is just the nice

820
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:30,920
round day. They're going to pull the plug, but we'll, we'll see. So, all right. So, uh,

821
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:36,360
enjoy your halo three 60 while at last I was going to ask if anybody has any halo three 60 memories

822
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:41,400
they want to share Jamie, I know you don't Loki. Did you play, did you play other than having to

823
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:46,680
do halo as my classic game, but that wasn't even on the three 60. That's the original box. They

824
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:53,240
pulled that one. Like the most halo love one will get from me. I did other than red versus blue. I

825
01:17:53,240 --> 01:18:00,600
love red versus blue. I played through halo three and I think we played a little bit of multiplayer

826
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:07,400
in our game room on halo three for a very short period of time. But, uh, that was about it. We

827
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:13,800
didn't really do that. I don't have a ton of experience with it. I played three when it first

828
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:18,360
came out for sure, because that was like the three 60 game that was being hyped up, you know,

829
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:22,920
and I loved halo two. So I was like, all right, I'm gonna play halo three. I remember not enjoying

830
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:27,800
the multiplayer as much in three. It's the game that every it's, it's the demo that everybody

831
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:34,520
bought crackdown for. Yes. Yes. There's that too. I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, yeah. So anyway,

832
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:39,160
um, good memories, but again, the master chief collection is still around. So halo ain't going

833
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:45,080
anywhere and then halo infinite's coming out. So eventually, so, um, and by the way,

834
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:50,200
just to explain to people who are new to the show, I don't really hate halo. I just don't enjoy halo.

835
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,680
It's an inside joke. That's it's a long, admittedly gotten out of hand. All right,

836
01:18:55,720 --> 01:19:00,760
let's get into speaking of jokes that have gotten out of hand, dark soccer. This ain't a joke. This

837
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:06,840
is real and I'm excited. This is the console I want to get. It's on the top of my fucking list.

838
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:14,440
Um, what is the, uh, uh, KFC is doing a gaming console and it has a chicken warmer

839
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:22,040
and it's called the KF console. Yeah. Um, it's not a joke. I thought it was a joke.

840
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:26,120
I thought it was a joke too. It's more of a fancy case than it is the console.

841
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:34,440
Don't ruin my, my, my, my joy. I'm not saying that it's, it is in your side of the pool. Okay.

842
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:44,920
No, yeah. Fifth dream is the top of my bucket list. Um, at any rate, um, the, uh, KF console

843
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:49,000
is going to be coming out, I guess it's going to be out of the Kentucky fried console.

844
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:56,520
That's just so hilarious. Um, but at any rate, um, it is going, it's being made in a partnership

845
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:04,840
with a cooler masters, a PC maker. Um, it's going to be, uh, really a customized PC, um,

846
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:10,920
that will run 4k games with 240 frames per second, which is twice the frame rate of the

847
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:16,920
Xbox series X and PS five will have twice as much storage as those systems. It's going to be using,

848
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:24,360
um, an Intel, uh, nine, uh, extreme compute element that will house an Intel core. I nine

849
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:33,240
has a hot swappable GPU. Um, just it's, it's a PC. It's a, it's a fucking PC where, where if,

850
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:40,760
if there's anything, maybe KFC engineers built a Linux branded thing that will show up as the OS,

851
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:46,440
maybe something like that, essentially it's a PC, but at any rate, it will support ray tracing

852
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:52,840
VR and has a heated interior chamber for warming your chicken.

853
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:58,760
So when you play world of Warcraft, you can unironically say, at least I have chicken,

854
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:06,920
but it's, it's in the whole idea of heating. I wonder if that's just with the,

855
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:14,200
it's just going to run fan is coming from the CPU. It'll keep it warm. Here's what I want to know.

856
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:18,440
Why limit it to just a chicken warmer? Can you put other things in there? Like, like a baby,

857
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:23,880
like what else can go in there? It just makes me think that I'm going to have something I can play

858
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:28,760
I'm going to have something I can play games on that smells like fucking fried chicken.

859
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:32,360
And you know what? I'm enough of a rebel that I would put jolly be in it instead.

860
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:36,920
Is it like, I can't, I can't wait to see those controllers after everybody. Oh, I'm sorry.

861
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:41,480
Keyboard and mouse after everything. We'll have to get those, uh, the grease proof ones that they

862
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:49,400
had for a, what was it? Pub G is it, is it hot enough where it's like an easy bake oven or you

863
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:57,240
can make little cookies like in an easy bake oven. Can I bake in it? Can I, can I, can I bake

864
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:03,800
in it? But when my fan was busted on, on my computer, on my gaming PC, I used to actually

865
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:08,840
just leave my cup of coffee sitting on it. Cause it would stay warm. How did, how does the KF

866
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:16,280
console handle vape smoke? We need to, that's a question we ask in this day and age. That whole,

867
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:23,000
the vape thing was the dumbest of the dumb. Okay. So one thing though, I'm watching their

868
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,600
little commercial again and you know what was really awesome about this commercial

869
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:33,720
Mustang, someone's driving a Mustang. Um, you know, you gotta say, you gotta hand it to, uh,

870
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:39,240
Kentucky fried chickens branding and whoever's doing that whole stuff because they, they've

871
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:44,920
really not slowed down in 2020. I mean, they've got this, there was that lifetime movie that was

872
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:51,480
like completely unironically like Mario Lopez or whatever as the, the, um, as the kernel,

873
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:58,120
even though Reba McEntire is my favorite kernel, but Mario Lopez and some romantic, uh,

874
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:04,760
lifetime. Okay. So this thing, I'm looking at their mock-up of it on the little commercial

875
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:12,600
and I can't even right now. I mean, I so can't even that. I can't odd even. That's right. I

876
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:18,040
forgot. I'm finding the tweet to show people. Jopium three one three and Chad is saying they

877
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:25,800
had a dating SIM. I forgot about that. Oh yeah. I was, I have, um, the, the dating SIM it's, um,

878
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:31,160
I love you, Colonel Sanders. So then, you know what, but here's the thing. Here we are. We've

879
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:36,680
just given KFC like five, five minutes silver Fox daddy. So that's why I thought they're using

880
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:42,680
there. They're just exhausting the hot air through the top and the neck blows through event with

881
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:49,880
chicken. So I can imagine that would be so amazing because now you're going to have somehow hot air

882
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:54,760
has got to get in there. So that means that there is some sort of ventilation or holes in there,

883
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:58,840
which means if they're going to get through there, then chicken grease can get right through there

884
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:06,440
as well. So that's going to be a big old mess, but sure. Let's try it. I'm you know what we've

885
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:10,760
just given KFC like a free five minute commercial on this show though. So I will say I'm with Jamie

886
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:16,280
where I will unironically put my Popeyes chicken sandwich in the warmer. I have just take that

887
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:25,240
officially followed the KFC gaming Twitter. Get a free console, Jamie and a terrace of one now,

888
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:35,480
maybe they've got like a bunch of fun. They're UK based as well. They've got 208,000 followers. So

889
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:42,040
sure. Why not? SSJ 100 Mountain Chat says KFC tried and succeeded to outdo Arby's Twitter.

890
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:46,120
What is with like, and this was a thing that's been going for like three, four, maybe five years

891
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:53,000
now. These like Twitter brand on Twitter is like, it's gone off the rocker. Like it started with

892
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Wendy's. That whole thing. You know, it started with Wendy's. It did start with Wendy's.

893
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:07,800
Steakham is on there now. Arby's though, you know, they've got one of us in their PR group who does

894
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:14,440
all this cardboard. I mean, it's all made from their like materials and it's, I'm living for

895
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:19,960
the Arby's Twitter. Now the KFC one is like, I don't know. I don't know. There's good stuff

896
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:26,520
coming out of it. And it's not just food chains now. Now Dionne Warwick is back and hey, I have

897
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:30,600
a lot of love for Dionne Warwick and her Twitter account is fucking fire. Her daughter taught her

898
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:36,280
how to Twitter. Good. Cause she's brightened up the Twitterverse. It wasn't her knees. Yeah,

899
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:40,520
her knees. Brittany, somebody. They did, they did, they did a sketch on Saturday Night Live and it

900
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:43,560
was, it's like one of the funniest things I've seen on Saturday Night Live in a long time where

901
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:46,760
she goes, can you put a hex on Wendy Williams? You look like a spooky bitch. Can you put a

902
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:52,680
hex on Wendy Williams for me? I died. It was great. And Dionne Warwick took the whole thing

903
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:58,360
to don't give a fuck. I love it. I'm loving the deal. And now here's the other big thing I just

904
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:05,320
saw this week. Eve six, the band from the nineties. Uh, but I would swallow my pride. I would joke.

905
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:09,800
I don't want to get shut down. I hate that song. Okay. But go look at their Twitter

906
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:18,280
because they have just, they have entered the town of no fucks Ville. And what was it?

907
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:22,280
He wrote a tweet earlier that would have been retweeted a billion times that said,

908
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:26,840
had a one hit wonder song in the nineties and can't get insurance or something like that. Like,

909
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:33,000
it's just, it's crazy. Uh, uh, pin tweet. Pretty sure we're going to be huge again.

910
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:39,400
Anyway. All right. Oh yeah, no. Okay. This is absolutely worth following. This was like my

911
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:47,480
kind of, of dry, but don't give a fuck humor. Right. All right. Anyway, let's move on. We got

912
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:53,800
from K we got from KFC to, to Twitter talk to the screensaver coming on my Mac, which I hope

913
01:26:53,800 --> 01:27:01,480
didn't shut down the stream for once. Rob, I think we're good. We went from per instead of being,

914
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:07,640
uh, distracted by food. We were distracted from food. That is an OLR first.

915
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:15,000
Maybe the future is a scary place. We've jumped the shark, Rob. We didn't just jump the shark.

916
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:20,120
We blew it up. Let's move on. Let's get into some news, maybe a little, a little, a little

917
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:24,360
less scary. Maybe something that we can look forward to in 2021. Uh, Loki, what do you have

918
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:33,240
for us? All right. Um, yes. So, well, actually, um, the COVID relief bill just passed. Um, they

919
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:39,960
just signed it into law. So that's wonderful. And a part of that, of course, because they shoved the

920
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:46,520
whole, hold up, hold up. Did, did he actually sign it finally after all the actually signed

921
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:52,360
it finally about fucking time. Jesus. All right. So he's, that must've happened during the show.

922
01:27:52,360 --> 01:28:00,280
Cause I missed that. Yeah. It just breaking. So, um, well, I guess it was raining on the

923
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:05,560
golf course. Wasn't it anyway? Sorry. Go ahead. You have to do something. I guess he got bored,

924
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:15,160
but I already did something today. Um, so with that, of course, so it wasn't just a COVID relief

925
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:19,560
bill. It was also their, um, spending bill for the, I can't remember what they call it. They're

926
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:26,120
like, it's basically this big on the most bill. And as part of the non COVID part of that, they

927
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:31,320
shoved a bunch of other stuff in there because it was getting fast tracked. And so it was like,

928
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:39,000
you know, 50,000 pages or five, five, 5,000 pages. Cause you know, with two hours,

929
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:45,800
you know, a few hours to actually look at it and 5,000 pages, it's hard to even see all the stuff

930
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:53,960
that they're voting, you know, yes on. But one of that was the case act, which is apparently a new,

931
01:28:53,960 --> 01:29:00,520
um, bill that will propose establishing a new court-like entity within the U S copyright office

932
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:09,000
to resolve, uh, copyright disputes, which basically it's this, um, new group of, uh,

933
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:15,800
people that get to make, uh, copyright decisions, whether or not you are liable for a fines, uh,

934
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:23,640
up to $30,000. And then on top of that, if you are found, um, to be purposefully sharing

935
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:31,480
copyright material online, you could be liable, uh, for felony as well. Um, now granted,

936
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:36,920
this is not necessarily, I think, directed towards folks on Twitch and YouTube that are

937
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:43,480
accidentally putting copyright music in their, um, streams or something like that. This is more

938
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:51,880
of the sense of like, you know, running a pirate server. That's basically hosting movies and stuff

939
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:59,720
like that. It's more of the purposeful, you know, piracy that's out there. That's not to say that,

940
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:09,320
you know, stuff will get twisted in a way that overreach, but because I mean, look at the RIA

941
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:14,120
and what they've done in the past for folks, um, illegally downloading MP3s and stuff,

942
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:19,560
which really hurts nobody, but they'll find them, you know, so much money on that. So it is

943
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:23,800
unfortunately something that's already been passed, but is it necessarily going to affect

944
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:30,600
everyone? I guess we'll have to see what happens, but it's not, not a positive thing. Definitely.

945
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:36,760
It's siding with these corporations again, who really need no more protections. Yeah. I think

946
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:43,160
that, I think you kind of hit it when you say the intent behind it is for these, you know, big,

947
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:48,600
you know, the, the websites where it's like, you don't have HBO max. So you go to this website

948
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:53,400
to watch the pirated version of Wonder Woman 84 or whatever. Uh, and, and, uh, you know, that's,

949
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:57,160
that's, that's a no, no. Right. It's, you're not supposed to do that. That's, you know, piracy

950
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:01,160
laws. They don't have a lot of ways to enforce that. Although I I'm curious, how does that work?

951
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:05,160
Because most of those websites are overseas, but I digress. I guess that's something they'll have

952
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:10,600
to figure out. Um, but I think we're worried about how might the language and how might some of that

953
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:17,080
be used when the RIAA decides, Oh, we could make more money by shutting down Twitch, you know,

954
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:21,800
or something like that. I think that's, that's the worries there. And to like, kind of like,

955
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:31,800
so right now they do have, there is like felonies or it's like for other types of piracy or other

956
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:39,160
types of like, what this is basically doing is bringing the actual streaming part of it up to,

957
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:45,160
um, equal merits with the other types of piracy they're out there. So the penalties with those

958
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:51,560
is what it's basically doing. Cause before I think it was, they couldn't, um, enforce a

959
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:55,720
heavier penalty on people, which I don't know if they necessarily need to do in the first place,

960
01:31:55,720 --> 01:32:05,320
but, um, yeah, so we'll see. I mean, it's just, it's basically, it says it's, it's illegal

961
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:11,400
streaming for commercial profit is what the bill is stipulating and says provide the public digital

962
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:20,680
transmission service that is primarily focused on legal streams. Um, I don't know, but we'll see.

963
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:27,240
I think it needs more revisions. I mean, that's not to say that they couldn't just do something

964
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:32,120
to revise this as well, but we'll have to see when the next administration gets in.

965
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:38,840
At least with politicians starting to get younger and younger, we're going to get more people in

966
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:43,720
there that get it. So to speak, I mean, obviously you have Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has done her

967
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:47,960
own stream and she was joined by Ilhan Omar. So those are two representatives there, right?

968
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:52,360
And then, you know, even if you're like, I don't like those extreme left or whatever,

969
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:56,520
even on the right, we know Justin Amash was watching. Although I think he's done now. I

970
01:32:56,520 --> 01:33:00,120
don't think he sought another term, but still, you know, there are people that are on the right

971
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:05,560
or are watching what's happening. And, you know, I think I hate to say it, but maybe I don't. It's,

972
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:10,680
it's kind of an age thing I get, I think. And I think as we get more younger people that have had

973
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:15,000
Twitch be a part of their lives and so forth and have had YouTube and stuff, we'll finally start

974
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:20,440
to see laws that kind of answer that. But right now you got a lot of people in there that just

975
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:25,240
do what Hollywood wants them to do, even though it's in their best interest, but they don't give

976
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:31,240
a rat's ass about Twitch, you know? So that's, I think what it comes down to. I just realized also,

977
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:37,480
I opened Pandora's box by uttering the words Wonder Woman 84. Haven't seen the movie. Don't,

978
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:41,080
I haven't even seen the first movie. You guys, I watched so little TV and movies.

979
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:48,440
Apparently they had some anachronisms because there were two video games, two arcade games

980
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:51,240
that were in the arcade that didn't come out until like 86 and 87.

981
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:57,640
But there are very big opinions. One way I'm seeing people love it. I'm seeing people hate it.

982
01:33:57,640 --> 01:34:02,840
I'm seeing people kind of like, it's just be respectful. Be respectful of everybody's

983
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:07,000
opinions y'all. It's just, I'm here. It's all over the board. I'm seeing it all over the board.

984
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,440
Whatever. I'm not a DC fan, so I'm not in a hurry to watch it anyway.

985
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:15,000
Yeah. All right. Yeah. I still haven't forgiven him for Batman versus Superman.

986
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,200
All right. That I did see and I wish I hadn't. Moving on.

987
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:23,000
Of course they, of course they greenlit a third movie because you know, it made some money and

988
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:27,800
it's just unfortunately like for me, like I've gotten out of the whole DC stuff

989
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:33,880
because I don't know, like they're trying to pull like what the Marvel is cinematic.

990
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:37,800
The Marvel Cinematic Universe seems to have more cohesion to it. And it's like, yes,

991
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:43,960
it's just going movie to movie. There's like, it's more interesting. Whereas the DC stuff,

992
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:48,600
it's just, it's misfire after misfire, which is unfortunate because I liked the DC characters,

993
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:52,520
but it's just, Oh my God, put the people in charge of the Marvel movies in charge of the

994
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:57,720
DC movies. And then we'll see like a night and day difference, but it's just not there yet.

995
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:02,280
How did it make? I mean, I, and this is not being being a hater. This is an honest question. How did

996
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:05,640
it, how did they know already it made enough money? Was, is that just based off international

997
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:10,840
box office and places where theaters are running? Um, or $4 million already.

998
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:18,040
Wow. And that's without HBO max. I think so. Okay. And you know, HBO. Okay. Then

999
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:22,440
nevermind question answered because, you know, HBO probably paid like 50 million or

1000
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:27,480
something like that to have it on their service. So it's Warner brothers service though. Warner

1001
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:33,080
brothers owns HBO. So that's why it's on HBO max. Got it. Got it. Well, still, still the money

1002
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:36,360
they're getting from monthly subscriptions and probably people that signed up and stuff is

1003
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:40,680
probably, probably not. Okay. That answers my question actually. Thank you. All right.

1004
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:44,440
Let's move on. Let's go back to classics. Cause apparently

1005
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:50,760
I, I don't understand how this newfangled box office works in the age of HBO max.

1006
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:54,760
Let's talk about classics and a new newer game. That's going classic. Although I don't think

1007
01:35:54,760 --> 01:36:00,200
this surprises anyone. Uh, the game bloodstained ritual of the night has been adding a lot of,

1008
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:04,840
you know, side modes and extra modes in the game. Uh, for example, some free DLC included

1009
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:10,600
a randomizer mode, a boss revenge modes, um, allowing you to play as alternate protagonists.

1010
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:16,200
Well now, um, five Oh five games in our play have announced that there is a classic mode coming to

1011
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:23,400
the game. And when you look at the screenshots of classic mode, it looks exactly like a classic game

1012
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:27,240
that bloodstained drew a lot of influence from a lot of influence, right? In fact,

1013
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:31,240
because the same creative mind was behind them both. Yes. It looks like a fricking

1014
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:35,720
Castlevania game. And I don't mean 70 in the night. I mean the old like vampire Hunter

1015
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:41,560
turned into Castlevania and now thing, uh, it looks like one of those games, but it looks,

1016
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:47,640
it, it looks like it, but it still has, it's not like retro. Like the interface looks like it,

1017
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:51,400
but it's not like an eight bit game. All of a sudden that was that, that was that curse of the

1018
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:56,200
moon side franchise they were doing. No, this is like a classic mode that's built into the game.

1019
01:36:56,200 --> 01:37:02,200
So it's more like 2d platforming action. So that's kind of neat. And again, it's something

1020
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:06,600
that is just coming to the game next month because of how well the Kickstarter did, uh,

1021
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:11,160
funded all these extra things. So that's pretty cool. Uh, another reason to visit bloodstained,

1022
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:16,040
uh, if you haven't visited that in a while, I know I bought it and then it showed up on game pass.

1023
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:20,760
I backed it actually. And they have a mobile version now too. Oh wow. And honestly,

1024
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:24,760
I still think that the PS4 version is the best of the home releases.

1025
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:32,040
Yeah. Just played so smoothly from day one. The switch version had some kind of hiccups in it. Um,

1026
01:37:32,440 --> 01:37:35,800
they've patched a lot of that out and ironed a lot of that out, but it was a little rough

1027
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:41,960
in the beginning there. So, uh, I don't know if it's J opium or Joe PM three, one, three

1028
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:44,040
said that they announced the sequel for bloodstained today.

1029
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:49,960
I thought they were already working on one. I thought they were too. Yeah. But they might've,

1030
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:53,960
they might've done an update or put out something on that. I'm not surprised. I think the game has

1031
01:37:53,960 --> 01:38:00,440
been doing very well. So, um, I'm surprised that a five Oh five games didn't want to charge us again

1032
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:06,680
for, you know, that classic mode, you know, uh, I think the terms of the original Kickstarter

1033
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:11,320
didn't, I think it was if we make so much money, then essentially the community's already paid for

1034
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:17,080
it. I think that's what it works, how it works. So speaking of working, uh, I thought this was

1035
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:21,800
a neat story. Darsaka. I had no idea something like this was a thing until you, uh, shared it

1036
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:28,040
with me earlier today. And I'll tell you how I came across it is actually, I love to watch,

1037
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:35,480
did you know, gaming one of my favorite channels and, uh, the fellow who runs it did, um, has a

1038
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:44,440
game history secrets thing that he does. Um, his, uh, his name is Liam Robertson. And so he did one

1039
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:51,080
about having tried to research this game boy peripheral, uh, called the work boy. And I don't

1040
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:55,960
know if you'd ever seen any, any of the pictures or people saying that it was like the Holy grail

1041
01:38:55,960 --> 01:39:02,440
of like old game boy accessories. And, you know, people might remember that I did a year before

1042
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:08,840
last do, uh, the classic peripheral. And I tried to outline like different peripherals, um,

1043
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:15,560
including the sewing machine for the game boy. Um, so this one is called the work boy. Um,

1044
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:24,840
it was rumored to have been released in very limited numbers in 1992. Um, it actually never

1045
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:32,200
was released. It was developed by fab tech. Um, and, uh, it was actually fab tech and source

1046
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:38,040
research and development. So it was a two part item. You have a small little keyboard and a

1047
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:45,960
cartridge. So, um, and as a rom hack, uh, sorry, not rom hackers, but as people who were looking

1048
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:54,440
at the code from the big, uh, uh, the giga leak, they found, um, one of the working prototypes of

1049
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:59,960
the cartridge, but they couldn't get anything to do with it because it was reliant on the

1050
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:06,600
keyboard to make it work. And the video is absolutely worth, worth watching. Um, but at any

1051
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:13,720
rate, um, Liam and doing research on this actually got in touch with, uh, Franz Balus, who was the

1052
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:21,960
founder of a fab tech who gave him his prototype, the copy he had of, of the thing, just sent it to

1053
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:28,920
him. And, um, so, but no one, none of the developers had the cartridge for it. And it

1054
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:34,120
was the giga leak that made this, uh, available. I mean, through this, there's like people who

1055
01:40:34,120 --> 01:40:41,720
developed games who lost so much of their work that this giga leak returned their work to them

1056
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:48,200
pretty much. And this is one of the items is included. And so, sorry, that's very interesting

1057
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:52,920
because there's been a lot of talk about is the giga leak like an ethical thing to cover,

1058
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:57,080
you know, it's kind of like one tough question we've been faced with as, you know, people that

1059
01:40:57,080 --> 01:41:01,480
are producing gaming media type of thing. Yeah, it is news. And I think that's kind of ultimately

1060
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:05,720
where it falls is like, you're going to talk about it, whether we do or not. So, you know,

1061
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:10,920
and we can just say the leaks aren't cool. It's not cool. It happened, but it is interesting,

1062
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:14,520
Jamie, that now you've kind of got this interesting side to it where it's like,

1063
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:19,320
well, here's a case where this leak kind of allowed people that thought it was gone,

1064
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:23,640
people who worked on it, who thought it was gone forever to kind of be reunited with it.

1065
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:30,040
So it's an interesting, not, not, not that we're saying it's okay, but it is an interesting

1066
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:34,760
silver lining to the situation. Well, and so if people work on this project and they

1067
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:39,800
haven't had any way to save any of their assets or any of the work, because technically it's

1068
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:45,720
owned by the studio that they did it for, you know, for a lot of these people, it was sort of

1069
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:51,560
like, I guess like a little bit of gold for them, you know, just something that's come back up,

1070
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:58,600
like finding an heirloom or something. But at any rate, the thing is that this is actually

1071
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:07,320
pretty cool. This basically does what a lot of stuff that we can do on say our iPhones today,

1072
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:15,880
but this was created before even PDAs were a big thing. The, the portable digital assistants,

1073
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:25,320
like Palm, Palm pilot. Yeah. So at any rate, what this does is it has, and it was actually

1074
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:34,120
pretty cool little thing. It has like a calendar, it has a built-in clock and the clock is reliant

1075
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:38,120
on the cartridge, you know, so the two things work together because, you know, the Game Boy

1076
01:42:38,120 --> 01:42:47,080
didn't have a built-in clock. It also had like a country locator and it's like, I think it was

1077
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:59,480
like 16 of the countries would play like the first few stanzas of their anthem. It also had a, like

1078
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:04,280
a loose translator in there, like for like useful phrases. And I want to say

1079
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:12,520
eight or 10 different languages, you know, just like useful things like for someone working.

1080
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:19,160
It also had, now it didn't have a number pad on there, but you could use your top line of letters

1081
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:26,120
that corresponded to a number to add in, to use the calculator, to use the, the phone book. It

1082
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:34,040
had a phone book built into it, you know, like a little portable Rolodex. And it was actually

1083
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:41,160
really cool. It had a word processor built into it, you know, it was supposed to have a printer

1084
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:46,280
capability, but there wasn't a port on, I guess, the prototype for the keyboard yet.

1085
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:50,120
And the Game Boy printer itself must not have been a thing yet.

1086
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:56,040
I'd have to check the timeframe, but yeah, this was 1992. But at any rate,

1087
01:43:56,040 --> 01:44:02,920
this thing was supposed to retail for about 90 bucks. What they were saying in the video is that

1088
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:11,480
the, what initially put the halt on it was the fact that the Game Boy was going to be dropping

1089
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:17,480
its price. Like they had a price point on this that was set to match the Game Boys price point.

1090
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:25,800
So you would pay roughly 180, 200 bucks and get this, you know, portable word processor system,

1091
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:33,800
something that was well ahead of its time. Excuse me. And he just put the hold on it.

1092
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:38,680
And the thing is, is that there were people after this who were like, we would have paid for this

1093
01:44:38,680 --> 01:44:42,600
thing, no matter what the price difference between this and the Game Boy was, you know,

1094
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:47,960
and they're like, well, kind of wish we did it. And they actually did remarket it later on.

1095
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:54,840
They had it in mind to do one for the Game Boy Advance that of course didn't even make it to

1096
01:44:54,840 --> 01:45:05,640
prototype. It was just, you know, drawings. And it actually was, the idea was purchased by Nokia

1097
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:12,520
for one of their PDAs.

1098
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:14,520
And it became the N-Gage. Just kidding.

1099
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:21,720
I would have to dig deeper into that, but maybe not. The taco was not the best thing ever to

1100
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:31,960
happen. And Nintendo hired one of the people who worked on that project as a design consultant

1101
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:35,720
for the Game Boy Advance. And that's kind of what was leading to the WorkBoy 2,

1102
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:39,160
the Game Boy Advance one that never saw the light of day.

1103
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:45,160
So yeah, as of 2.100, Matt says we're getting Classic Game and Classic Peripheral.

1104
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:55,640
Unreleased Peripheral. Then again, you know, I have done an unreleased game as Classic Game.

1105
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:59,640
I did Space Fantasy Zone. Maybe there's a 2020 theme in there,

1106
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:05,320
Classic Unreleased thing or something. I don't want to do that much research.

1107
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:09,960
Maybe I'll do Classic Controller.

1108
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:12,520
This is still neat because, you know, yeah,

1109
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:16,280
it was kind of enhancing the Game Boy to do things that weren't just games.

1110
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:24,440
Now, there's also a budget thing on here too, which I mean, it's just so, so interesting.

1111
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:29,480
Now, what is interesting, Rama shared this link in chat of something he remembered,

1112
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:35,080
and it was like a Game Boy. It was from Infogenius Productivity Pack from Game Tech,

1113
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:39,480
a personal organizer and phone book. So and it actually had a clock in it and things like that.

1114
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:43,880
And it looks like there's some other things there. So like a travel guide, a spell checker.

1115
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:51,800
So this wasn't the only thing to really think of. How can we, you know, make the Game Boy more than

1116
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:55,240
just games when people are taking this in their pockets? Again, you have to remember,

1117
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:59,960
early 90s, before cell phones, before, you know, all that stuff.

1118
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:02,360
Before smartphones.

1119
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:05,960
Yeah. How do we put that all in our pocket where we go? And so it's interesting.

1120
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:08,600
Some people took this approach of putting them in game packs,

1121
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:13,560
although the Work Boy was more going to be not just a game, a game, a program,

1122
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:17,800
but a peripheral with the word processing and all that stuff. It's kind of neat.

1123
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:28,040
Exactly so. And honestly, absolutely watch the video. I will copy the link and paste it in chat

1124
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:34,840
because it is absolutely, absolutely worth the watch. I think it was a wonderful video. It went

1125
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:39,640
into a lot more detail than I did. Of course, don't watch it during the show. Wait till we're

1126
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:47,320
done. But it's so great. It is just really cool to see the thing in motion. I thought it was really

1127
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:51,800
something special. And the fact that the dude just gave it to this guy.

1128
01:47:52,360 --> 01:47:52,840
Yeah.

1129
01:47:52,840 --> 01:48:00,760
Yeah. I mean, he's like, I think, like, if I remember the conversation when you won it. Yes.

1130
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:02,520
Here you go.

1131
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:09,640
He sent it. And the fact that this ties into the Giga leak as well is just sort of like news upon

1132
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:17,800
news in history. So, of course, now I would imagine that it would have needed like some

1133
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:25,320
sort of like holder or rig in there, which they actually had a rig designed for the Work Boy 2

1134
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:30,840
that would have been with Game Boy Advance. Like it had a clamshell. Because certainly doing the

1135
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:35,160
word processing on such a tiny thing that could flop over if you were, say, like trying to work

1136
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:40,520
on a plane or something, you know, that wouldn't be easy.

1137
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:47,000
All right. Well, you got to do back to back duty tonight because it's time to get to our

1138
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,760
classic game of the week. We've just talked about.

1139
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:50,360
Which has nothing to do with the Game Boy.

1140
01:48:50,360 --> 01:48:54,680
Yeah. It's just a completely different pick. That's okay. It's time for the last classic

1141
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:59,720
game of 2020. So every week, Dark Sakura jumps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she

1142
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:09,480
thinks, hey, you brats, get off my lawn. Enough of your PlayStation fives and Xbox X's. You got

1143
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:14,920
to get a console that didn't even come out in the United States for this one. Sort of, sort of,

1144
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:17,800
but you'll get into it. Dark Sakura. And this is one of those.

1145
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:20,520
It did eventually make its way over here in one way or another.

1146
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:25,160
You've talked about this series before, but not this particular game. And I think this is

1147
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:32,520
a fascinating one. I'm going to take a halo approach to the sequel by the way that the U.S.

1148
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:40,920
got, but in Japan, um, Metal Gear got a remake, uh, not a remake, a sequel called Metal Gear 2

1149
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:49,480
Solid Snake. And this is the actual sequel to Metal Gear, not Snake's Revenge. Um, and the

1150
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:54,760
good thing for the viewers, we are watching a later port of the game that is in English that

1151
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:58,360
Jamie will get into later. Just so they understand why they're saying English.

1152
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:05,960
And the cool thing about this is that you start seeing a lot of the groundwork for like Metal

1153
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:10,200
Gear Solid, like we got on PlayStation. It really seems to have quite a bit more,

1154
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:19,880
you see that evolution into this. So, um, at any rate, um, it was released by Konami for the

1155
01:50:19,880 --> 01:50:28,120
MSX 2 computer in 1990. And it is, like I said, a direct sequel to the MSX 2 version of Metal Gear,

1156
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:36,680
both written and designed by Hideo Kojima. Um, and he actually did the sequel as a response

1157
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:43,400
to Snake's Revenge because it was bad and he didn't like it. So he made the real thing.

1158
01:50:44,360 --> 01:50:52,280
Um, so, um, with this one, of course, it only came out in Japan. Um, and it was immediately

1159
01:50:52,280 --> 01:51:02,680
followed up by Metal Gear Solid. Um, this one is, uh, it was interesting. And by the way,

1160
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:07,800
it did get the rereleases of this. It was released as content in the subsist,

1161
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:16,280
the subsistence version of Metal Gear Solid 3 for PlayStation 2 in 2005, and included in the HD

1162
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:22,920
Metal Gear Solid 3 for PS3, Xbox 360, and PlayStation Vita, and then a standalone re-release

1163
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:32,040
in Japan for mobile phones and the Wii virtual console. Um, but at any rate, it was set in 1999,

1164
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:39,640
a few years after the original game where Snake has to go into this territory known as Zanzibar

1165
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:45,960
land to kidnap a scientist and to destroy a new Metal Gear called Metal Gear D. Um,

1166
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:56,360
it's got a lot more of the stealth, uh, aspect to it. Um, really just, uh, over the top actually,

1167
01:51:56,360 --> 01:52:02,760
because it really evolved that system and it deals with a lot more in terms of the storyline.

1168
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:09,640
It's really gathered some complexity going over like the nature of what war is and, uh,

1169
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:15,480
nuclear proliferation. Um, it's on record as one of the best 8-bit games ever made.

1170
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:22,200
And so with this one, um, it, like I said, it builds on that stealth based gameplay. Um,

1171
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:26,680
your objective is to infiltrate the enemy stronghold while avoiding detection from

1172
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:33,640
soldiers, cameras, infrared sensors, and other surveillance devices. Um, and so, uh, one of the

1173
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:40,520
big changes actually not in, I guess, Snake as much, but as in what the enemies can do.

1174
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:48,520
So instead of having like this one stationed guard, they now patrol multiple screens on a

1175
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:53,720
single map and they have expanded vision to 45 degrees. They can turn their heads.

1176
01:52:54,440 --> 01:53:01,480
Um, they can detect sounds. Um, like if you punch a wall or shoot a gun, uh, without a suppressor,

1177
01:53:01,480 --> 01:53:06,520
they'll hear it. Um, and then they'll come investigate. Um, they can hear you walking on

1178
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:13,880
certain surfaces. And if you're discovered, then you have a counter that goes down until they've

1179
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:20,600
lost track of you. So then when it reaches zero, then it goes back to normal sound a lot like

1180
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:26,120
Metal Gear Solid right there, just saying you do have, um, new maneuvers, new tools.

1181
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:34,280
So you can duck under desks inside air ducts. You have a three by three radar grid so that you can

1182
01:53:34,280 --> 01:53:39,880
see where your position is versus the enemies. Um, of course the radar is disabled in the alert

1183
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:47,160
phase. Again, we saw this in Metal Gear Solid. Um, you can, uh, increase your health and carrying

1184
01:53:47,160 --> 01:53:53,320
capacity every time you beat a boss. Um, you have robot robotic mice to distract enemies with,

1185
01:53:53,320 --> 01:54:00,840
you have camo, different kinds of rations. Um, the transceiver for your conversations are now,

1186
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:05,720
uh, they're pro the, this program to be a lot more context sensitive instead of just based on

1187
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:13,320
where you are and you can see the faces of people that you're talking to. Um, and so, um, you know,

1188
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:19,960
you get different, uh, codes, different, uh, frequency numbers. You can lure a carrier pigeon

1189
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:25,000
with certain rations. You got all kinds of different stuff. You can chase a lady spy into

1190
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:32,760
the ladies room. Didn't we see this with Meryl? Um, kind of, um, that again, Metal Gear Solid.

1191
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:39,800
Um, but the MSX2 version requires, um, either a floppy disk drive or the Game Master 2 utility

1192
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:45,640
cartridge to save your progress. Um, and in absence of that, the password, you, you have a

1193
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:52,040
password. Later versions of the game did remove the password favor, uh, the password feature in

1194
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:59,960
favor of using standardized media, such as memory cards or internal hard disks. So, um, your main

1195
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:10,440
character, you have a solid snake. Um, you have Roy Campbell. Um, you've got, uh, his, uh,

1196
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:16,200
commanding officer, McDonald Miller, who I think didn't he become master Miller in the later ones.

1197
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:24,120
You have, uh, George Kessler. You have Joseph Norden who was renamed to Johan Jacobson in the

1198
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:31,480
later ones. You have Holly White as a CIA agent posting as a journalist. You've got, uh, all kinds

1199
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:38,600
of just other characters. Um, uh, just, and some of them we've seen come back. You also have Big Boss

1200
01:55:39,480 --> 01:55:48,280
and Gray Fox, as we saw in, uh, in, uh, Metal Gear, Metal Gear Solid. Um, you've got bosses,

1201
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:56,120
you have, um, like one called Running Man, Red Blaster, Black Color, who's renamed to Black Ninja.

1202
01:55:56,840 --> 01:56:05,560
Um, Predator, uh, who was also renamed Jungle Evil for some reason. And, you know, so basically

1203
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:10,440
that's sort of starting the hokey name, uh, thing that went on in later Metal Gear games.

1204
01:56:11,080 --> 01:56:17,720
Um, so, um, I'm not gonna get too much into the story cause I'd say you should go out and play the

1205
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:23,320
game. Um, there's also translated original MSX versions out there to play, but it was very,

1206
01:56:24,040 --> 01:56:30,520
very successful. Um, uh, Kojima of course was not involved in either of the NES versions

1207
01:56:31,080 --> 01:56:37,960
and he didn't have a plan to do the sequel until he saw that one of his coworkers was assigned to

1208
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:45,960
work on Snake's Revenge. Um, and he of course wasn't happy about it. And so the, the coworker

1209
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:51,880
actually encouraged Kojima to do his own. And so, um, Jamie, I just have to say a comparison

1210
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:57,320
between you and Hideo Kojima and probably why you like him so much is that this game was motivated

1211
01:56:57,320 --> 01:57:06,520
by spite, much like, uh, you, everything that I do. I'm absolutely motivated by spite. I mean,

1212
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:11,480
that's, that's really what it is. Metal Gear Solid 2, or excuse me, I'm sorry. Metal Gear 2

1213
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:18,120
is Solid Snake is one of those games that exists out of spite. Maybe, maybe Mega Man 2 being the

1214
01:57:18,120 --> 01:57:21,640
only other I can think of at the top of my head where they, they weren't going to do it until the

1215
01:57:21,640 --> 01:57:30,520
workers just kind of did it on their off time. Well, and, and basically, um, after some business

1216
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:38,680
trips, Kojima got the execs to approve of it for the MSX. So, um, as I said earlier, the MSX 2

1217
01:57:38,680 --> 01:57:46,920
version of, uh, Metal Gear 2 was released in Japan on July 20th, 1990. Um, no English version

1218
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:53,960
was produced, um, since Konami, uh, actually discontinued sales of the MSX in Europe because,

1219
01:57:53,960 --> 01:57:59,480
you know, the U S never got the MSX. It was, they did in Europe. There was a fan translation

1220
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:08,840
done in 1987 by the MSX hobbyist group, G and T international. Um, the first port came on a

1221
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:16,520
Japanese phone. Um, basically a feature phone was what they're called that had like the, the,

1222
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:24,840
the like video windows and stuff like that, um, came out October 1st, 2004, uh, for download on

1223
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:31,000
i-mode easy web and Yahoo mobile services. The guy playing this isn't very good at stealth,

1224
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:38,040
just saying, well, the video is going to loop in a minute here anyway. Sorry. Yeah. I only

1225
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:44,120
am able to pull about 10 minutes before it loops. But at any rate, um, uh, it included,

1226
01:58:44,120 --> 01:58:50,440
um, an easy mode, a boss rush, uh, that was unlockable after you beat the game. Um,

1227
01:58:50,440 --> 01:58:57,160
and then the portraits in the MSX two version were modeled after like some real celebrities,

1228
01:58:57,160 --> 01:59:03,880
but then they, uh, were redesigned to look like the original character designs in the later

1229
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:12,040
installations or installments. Um, and these changes also carried over into metal gear,

1230
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:17,640
solid three subsistence, that version that came in and metal gear solid three snake eater snake

1231
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:24,680
eater. Anyway, I can't think of snake eater without that song gonna play in my head. Um,

1232
01:59:24,680 --> 01:59:29,640
it did get her a release on the Wii virtual console exclusively in Japan on March 30th,

1233
01:59:29,640 --> 01:59:36,520
2010. Um, and it was of course, emulated off of the MSX two hardware rather than being a port.

1234
01:59:37,400 --> 01:59:46,280
Um, so, uh, the music was done by the Konami, uh, uh, uh, I always mispronounce it Kukeha club.

1235
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:55,880
Um, same people that worked on nemesis two and snatcher. Um, and you can actually hear some of

1236
01:59:55,880 --> 02:00:01,480
the arranged music from that in the VR training disc for metal gear, solid integral, or as we

1237
02:00:01,480 --> 02:00:09,000
got it, metal gear, solid VR missions. So, uh, the theme of solid snake was, uh, from that game

1238
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:19,080
was heard in super smash brothers ball. So it was ranked at number one in MSX magazines, top 30 best

1239
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:28,280
selling MSX games. Uh, it was, I mean, pretty much given some amazing reviews, just even in the,

1240
02:00:28,280 --> 02:00:34,120
the later iterations that we got with, uh, the releases with the later metal gear games,

1241
02:00:34,120 --> 02:00:41,560
the remastered ones. So, and I mean, I didn't play it myself. I watched Dan play through it

1242
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:47,320
cause he had, um, an emulator for it and he was really getting into it. I think this game is,

1243
02:00:47,320 --> 02:00:55,800
is pretty fantastic. Um, it, it laid this one, I think like while the first model gear might've been

1244
02:00:56,440 --> 02:01:03,080
the foundation for all of the later games, this one really laid out the groundwork.

1245
02:01:03,080 --> 02:01:10,120
This one was the cornerstone, the, the, the, the studs, the, the anchors.

1246
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:16,600
Well, it's just such a unique release to where, you know, we literally had two different sequels,

1247
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:21,160
uh, in the U S versus Japan, which doesn't happen all the time. I mean, super Mario

1248
02:01:21,160 --> 02:01:26,360
brothers comes to mind, but it's not, uh, it's not something you, you really have a lot of in,

1249
02:01:26,360 --> 02:01:31,880
in the history of gaming. Um, and, and just the fact that not only like, and, and even with Mario,

1250
02:01:31,880 --> 02:01:35,480
like at least those games were still both Nintendo games, but these are like

1251
02:01:35,480 --> 02:01:40,680
really radically different because metal gear, uh, two was for the longest time,

1252
02:01:40,680 --> 02:01:46,600
only an M I'm sorry, not, not the, not the no snakes revenge is what I call the U S revenge,

1253
02:01:46,600 --> 02:01:51,160
but, uh, metal gear two was a MSX thing, which we didn't even have here in the States.

1254
02:01:51,160 --> 02:01:54,440
And then of course, snakes revenge was an NES game. And yeah, I play, I remember playing a

1255
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:58,920
little bit of it and it wasn't it, you could tell it was designed by different people. It

1256
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:03,960
was a different kind of game. Um, but then memories of playing it, but yeah,

1257
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:11,000
it's not the best game. It's also weird because many of us in the U S our foundation of metal

1258
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:17,000
gear is that original, uh, admittedly subpar version of the game, but we didn't know that,

1259
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:23,560
you know, we didn't know that the last boss exactly. And so it is interesting how, you know,

1260
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:27,560
here in the U S you know, we just, I think we all just kind of collectively wrote off snakes

1261
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:31,800
revenge and then, Oh, metal gear solid shows up. And that's really, you know,

1262
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:35,560
either the first experience in the franchise for a lot of people, whatever, but, but you bring up

1263
02:02:35,560 --> 02:02:42,200
a great point that it's like, but the, the real bridge between metal gear and metal gear solid

1264
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:48,280
is this. And unless you are a hardcore metal gear collector or whatever, you probably have

1265
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:53,160
never played it or maybe even heard of it before because of its unique Japanese release. Sorry.

1266
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:57,960
On top of that, you know, like what I think a lot of people didn't realize when they were

1267
02:02:57,960 --> 02:03:01,640
playing metal gear solid is that when gray Fox shows up and snake knows him

1268
02:03:02,520 --> 02:03:06,120
and everyone's like, who the hell is gray Fox and why does snake know him?

1269
02:03:06,120 --> 02:03:12,200
Yeah. Good point. Yeah. And I really liked that Kojima was like, I reject.

1270
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:16,360
Wasn't I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Jamie. Wasn't gray Fox in the original metal gear. I know big boss

1271
02:03:16,360 --> 02:03:21,880
was I thought gray. Yeah, I guess, but I think, but he had more of a role to play.

1272
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:28,440
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's been a lot. I loved the metal gear when I was a kid and I had,

1273
02:03:28,440 --> 02:03:33,480
but I never super got into the solid series. Honestly, they just became too, too stealthy

1274
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:38,040
for me. Sorry. Well, what I was saying though, with that is this like Kojima said, I reject

1275
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:47,960
your reality and replace it with my own. And I think that getting those, uh, the subsistence

1276
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:54,920
and metal gear solid three is the first exposure that people who did not actively look for it here

1277
02:03:54,920 --> 02:04:04,840
in the U S got to, to this game. And I'm really glad that they, uh, they, uh, uh, localized it,

1278
02:04:04,840 --> 02:04:09,400
uh, for, for what we got over here, because it's a fantastic game. I really enjoyed the story.

1279
02:04:09,400 --> 02:04:13,880
Yeah. Um, it's been years since I've done any play of it, but I was just like thinking

1280
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:19,240
what is something that would be good to end the year on?

1281
02:04:19,240 --> 02:04:23,560
Yeah. And what, you know, I really wish Kami would kind of get their shit together, so to speak and,

1282
02:04:23,560 --> 02:04:29,640
and maybe put, put these, uh, redone versions out again, you know, outside of the, the metal gears,

1283
02:04:29,640 --> 02:04:34,840
you know, where it was just showed up in as bonus content, why not do some rerelease standalone

1284
02:04:34,840 --> 02:04:39,080
content of, uh, on the Nintendo switch or something of the MSX games? I'd be so into that.

1285
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:44,840
I'd love that. So, oh, we'll see. But, um, with this particular segment over,

1286
02:04:44,840 --> 02:04:52,520
I want to position a question to both of you guys that, um, Dan asked me, and he asked me what semi

1287
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:59,240
obscure video or video game system or anything that plays video games would I want? So before

1288
02:04:59,240 --> 02:05:03,720
I give you my answer, I want to know what your YouTube would choose. Wait, I don't know who you

1289
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:10,280
dark soccer would want or who I would know what, what I want. I'm asking you what, what's semi

1290
02:05:10,280 --> 02:05:18,600
obscure or somewhat obscure system that you would want. Um, damn. That's a really good question. Um,

1291
02:05:22,040 --> 02:05:27,320
I know you put me on the spot here. Um, I can do that. Maybe. Yeah, you can. Um,

1292
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:33,160
I was going to say maybe like, uh, of course my brain is going to like retro stuff

1293
02:05:33,160 --> 02:05:37,000
and I'm kind of torn between like either like an old ass, like Apple to eat. Cause I never had

1294
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:41,800
one of those when I was a kid. Um, and there's a lot of fun stuff to rediscover on that. Or maybe,

1295
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:46,760
um, straight up a Coleco. I know that's your, your bread and butter, but I never had a Coleco

1296
02:05:46,760 --> 02:05:51,880
and never really got to play with that. Okay. Maybe I have two of them. Do you really?

1297
02:05:53,160 --> 02:05:59,400
Yeah, it's in my garage. No, no, I have to Dan bought one from one of my coworkers and then I

1298
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:03,960
came back from Alabama with one, although I don't get me wrong. MSX would be bad-ass,

1299
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:08,520
but the reality is all the games are in Japanese. I, you know, I'm not going to count the Saturn

1300
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:13,800
as obscure by the way that power I'm talking about things like an FM towns or something like that.

1301
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:18,040
I thought of another one, the Panasonic queue, the one that played GameCube games.

1302
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:26,360
That was kind of rad. Okay. All right. Uh, I don't really have any consoles that I would want. I

1303
02:06:26,360 --> 02:06:32,600
would think, um, well, I'm also counting gaming computers that were standalone systems like

1304
02:06:32,600 --> 02:06:39,560
computers too. So something like the FM towns or something like that. No, I don't really have any

1305
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:49,160
thing that I would want. Um, yeah, I can't think of anything. I told Dan mine would be the sharp

1306
02:06:49,240 --> 02:07:01,240
X 68,000 or if I can find a duo LT and a PC engine duo LT, wait, why I say duo, it's just a PC engine

1307
02:07:01,240 --> 02:07:08,520
LT. Um, which you remember Chris saying, yeah, I think he has a couple of them. He lost one in a

1308
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:14,120
movie theater. True story. He's I don't know if he wants me to tell that, but I just did. Um,

1309
02:07:14,120 --> 02:07:18,360
some interesting comments in chat, uh, Bobby saying not obscure, but I want a CDI so I can

1310
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:25,800
find the Zelda games. Uh, or it has a 3d. Oh, um, Questmaster says not a console to have out an

1311
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:33,080
arcade cab, like the R three 60. Yeah. Well, the CDI games were, uh, unofficially remastered a few

1312
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:38,920
weeks ago and they are on the internet if you were looking to play for those on PC. Yeah. So

1313
02:07:38,920 --> 02:07:43,800
that's something, well, we know what Dan's answer was. Oh, what's that? Dan wants the

1314
02:07:43,800 --> 02:07:49,640
Capcom CPS changer, which you can only play like eight games on it. I mean, but they're the arcade

1315
02:07:49,640 --> 02:07:55,880
games. If we can throw arcades into it, then I want a Nintendo pay choice 10, but now the

1316
02:07:55,880 --> 02:08:03,800
changer itself is meant to play the arcade games on a home TV, which is basically just like, I

1317
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:11,640
think a super gun and yeah. Um, but yeah, Dan said the CPS changer and me, I, I would want the, the

1318
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:21,240
shark. Okay. All right. Bobby, you send me $4,000. I'll send you a doctor who pinball on my honor,

1319
02:08:22,280 --> 02:08:27,560
including the shipping. All right. Uh, there it is your classic game of the week,

1320
02:08:27,560 --> 02:08:34,680
metal gear two, not to be confused with snakes revenge, the not great sequel we got in the U S

1321
02:08:34,680 --> 02:08:40,440
but the actual MSX sequel done by Hideo Kojima to the original metal gear game. Um, good pick

1322
02:08:40,440 --> 02:08:44,520
dark soccer. I would, I actually thought we'd done it before, but I think we just talked about

1323
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:47,560
it when we were talking about like the first game or something like that. So, uh, cause I,

1324
02:08:47,560 --> 02:08:52,600
I knew this little bit about gaming history and I, I didn't know for a lot. We were doing this

1325
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:55,880
show and I learned about it. I was like, what there's, there's a different metal gear two game.

1326
02:08:55,880 --> 02:09:01,320
What I kind of learned that through this show. So, um, yeah, kind of cool. It's a neat little gaming

1327
02:09:01,320 --> 02:09:09,000
story. All right. Uh, let's get into some rapid fire news. We're going to travel around the globe

1328
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:13,240
and, uh, quickly, uh, cover some other things. Actually. I don't think we have as much with the

1329
02:09:13,240 --> 02:09:19,640
holiday week, but we'll get into it. Well, anyways, um, so we have some more games with

1330
02:09:19,640 --> 02:09:26,920
gold for January. So now, uh, it looks like little nightmares, uh, dead rising, the king of fighters

1331
02:09:26,920 --> 02:09:34,120
13 and breakdown will be your games of gold, uh, for January. So that's pretty cool. And then

1332
02:09:35,080 --> 02:09:42,840
another Microsoft titles also getting an update. So the, uh, VR update for Microsoft flight simulator

1333
02:09:42,840 --> 02:09:50,920
is now a thing. Um, it is going to be, of course, I mean, it makes sense. Uh, just the actual like,

1334
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:56,680
uh, head tracking is basically supported. They don't actually support any of the controllers,

1335
02:09:56,680 --> 02:10:01,240
which makes sense because you're flying a plane. I can't imagine that they'd be able to simplify it

1336
02:10:01,240 --> 02:10:07,000
that, um, that much, but I guess it's got to come to consoles at some point. So they're going to

1337
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:13,000
have to simplify it a little bit, but it is not something that they are supporting right now,

1338
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:19,080
but it does support any open XR compliant headsets. So your Oculus five valve index,

1339
02:10:19,720 --> 02:10:25,320
windows mixed reality headsets are supported. So pretty cool. Wonder how big that download is.

1340
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:31,720
Um, but yeah, it's going to be big. I have to try that. All right. I just don't want to download the

1341
02:10:31,720 --> 02:10:37,560
whole game. Well, uh, speaking of VR, another, uh, game that's getting VR is Tetris effect

1342
02:10:37,560 --> 02:10:42,360
connected. And you might be thinking, well, wasn't Tetris effect already in DVR. Yes. The PlayStation

1343
02:10:42,360 --> 02:10:47,800
version was in VR, but this is Tetris effect connected. This is the kind of sequel kind of,

1344
02:10:47,800 --> 02:10:52,520
it's more like Tetris effect plus I would call it. Uh, and, uh, that wasn't on PlayStation and

1345
02:10:52,520 --> 02:10:58,840
still isn't, uh, it is actually still exclusive to Xbox and windows 10, but through the Microsoft

1346
02:10:58,840 --> 02:11:04,120
windows 10 store, not through Epic games, which is where I bought it. That's the only game I've

1347
02:11:04,120 --> 02:11:08,600
bought on the Epic store is Tetris effect. And it is not upgraded to connected still

1348
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:12,680
that will be coming out this summer. So it sounds like Microsoft probably threw some

1349
02:11:12,680 --> 02:11:17,880
coin to have connected be an exclusive for a little bit. But anyway, if you have it on the

1350
02:11:17,880 --> 02:11:24,360
Xbox or windows 10 store, obviously the series X and those that they don't support VR headsets,

1351
02:11:24,360 --> 02:11:30,280
but if you have it on a PC through the Microsoft storefronts, you will get, um, you know, of course,

1352
02:11:30,280 --> 02:11:36,600
4k 60 frame per second output and all this, but in the connected stuff will add, uh, with the 1.10

1353
02:11:36,600 --> 02:11:43,000
patch official support for Vive and Oculus rift headsets. Although the notes for the patch do

1354
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:47,800
indicate it should work with other like steam VR, if it runs that it'll work on the headset.

1355
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:52,920
So it's should be pretty, uh, pretty open-ended there. And I'm sure, I'm sure if it doesn't

1356
02:11:52,920 --> 02:11:58,200
officially get supported hackers will make it work wink. So, um, there you go. Tetris effect

1357
02:11:58,200 --> 02:12:03,560
connected now in VR, which is a great VR game, by the way, at least the original is so one of the

1358
02:12:03,560 --> 02:12:08,280
few things I've played a lot, a lot, a lot of on the PlayStation 4 VR, uh, dark soccer. How about

1359
02:12:08,280 --> 02:12:19,880
you? Um, how about some home star runner news, but it's 20, 20, 20 X D six anyway. Um, so since

1360
02:12:19,880 --> 02:12:30,120
flash is being officially discontinued, um, on, uh, December 31st, um, they, uh, have, uh, finally

1361
02:12:30,120 --> 02:12:39,720
put out level 10 of a stinko man 20 X D six. So, um, it's, uh, it's basically a flash game.

1362
02:12:39,720 --> 02:12:47,240
It's got multiple levels sort of anime style. Um, and yeah, level, level 10 is out. Um, you can

1363
02:12:47,240 --> 02:12:55,640
play it before it goes away. Um, I might have to, uh, get myself my, uh, flash downloader and just

1364
02:12:55,640 --> 02:13:03,080
save the whole game so I can play it forever. But yeah, some, uh, home star runner stuff.

1365
02:13:04,520 --> 02:13:08,600
Say you got about five days to squeeze it in there before flash has gone forever.

1366
02:13:08,600 --> 02:13:16,280
So, right. Yeah. That's been a whole to do going on with my, uh, day life because flash is how a

1367
02:13:16,280 --> 02:13:19,720
lot of e-learning was built back in the day. And so we have to kind of like convert it all

1368
02:13:19,720 --> 02:13:24,440
to not be flashing. I learned flash in college. Yeah. I learned a little bit of it there too. So

1369
02:13:24,440 --> 02:13:30,840
yeah, I took two whole semesters or not, not semesters, but yeah, semester is learning flash.

1370
02:13:30,840 --> 02:13:36,280
Yeah. And I sucked at it, but the fun thing now is that all that time I spent in learning out flash

1371
02:13:37,480 --> 02:13:43,720
made it really easy for me to learn a motion and DJ Rama S and chat says new grounds created an

1372
02:13:43,720 --> 02:13:49,240
alternative flash player for its website. Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure there will still be ways. Um,

1373
02:13:49,320 --> 02:13:55,400
but for the most part, probably just update this for HTML five. Yeah. Yeah. So by the way, did,

1374
02:13:55,400 --> 02:14:00,440
did what Alan, uh, bring me show up on cam because he went to the store and sometimes they'll bring

1375
02:14:00,440 --> 02:14:06,520
me a little treat. So he brought me, he brought me red vines, but they're not because you know,

1376
02:14:06,520 --> 02:14:11,000
Jamie, I don't think you'll like this. I'm not really into red vines, but it's the black

1377
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:17,480
licorice red vines. Yum. Cause I'm, I am that freak who loves black licorice. I thought you

1378
02:14:17,480 --> 02:14:24,440
like Jaeger too. I do love Jaeger actually. Cause you know what it tastes like? Terrible.

1379
02:14:27,400 --> 02:14:33,000
Malort on the other hand. I'm kidding. All right. So I have to ask, have you ever had a Uzo?

1380
02:14:33,560 --> 02:14:40,920
I don't think so. No, it is an Annie's flavored, uh, uh, liqueur from Greece. Huh?

1381
02:14:41,800 --> 02:14:50,920
So if, if you come over, I might invest in a very small bottle of Uzo to see if you can stand it.

1382
02:14:50,920 --> 02:14:56,200
All right. I hate it. All right. All right. I think that's it for rapid fighting. Absinthe

1383
02:14:56,200 --> 02:15:02,040
is also nasty and I've had the real thing. So I feel like I've had it, but it was the,

1384
02:15:02,040 --> 02:15:07,560
the marketed thing. Like it wasn't the real thing. Like it was the, you know, when after everybody

1385
02:15:07,560 --> 02:15:13,160
saw Moulin Rouge, uh, somebody made a mainstream version of it. So I don't think I've had the real

1386
02:15:13,160 --> 02:15:21,320
thing. All right. When I had it, it was actually on a Creek Indian reservation. Ooh, fun. And so

1387
02:15:21,320 --> 02:15:26,600
it was the real thing. Cause the laws are different. You could bring it in there. Yeah. Um,

1388
02:15:26,600 --> 02:15:34,600
and it was absolutely terrible. It spirits of wormwood it, and it kind of handed me my ass

1389
02:15:34,600 --> 02:15:39,240
cause I had a bunch of it cause I don't even know what the fuck we were doing,

1390
02:15:39,240 --> 02:15:45,400
but absent this terrible pod culture says I had a dragon con and I, I, that's what I kind of thought,

1391
02:15:45,400 --> 02:15:51,240
but I didn't want to commit myself to that, but thank you for that. And I remember, am I wrong?

1392
02:15:51,240 --> 02:15:56,280
It was, it was kind of the, it was the, the, you could buy it at a store stuff, which,

1393
02:15:56,280 --> 02:15:58,680
you know, the stuff Jamie's talking about, you can't really buy it.

1394
02:15:59,480 --> 02:16:03,640
But by, by the way, um, to, to tell Ronma who

1395
02:16:03,640 --> 02:16:08,200
said, uh, Mako Chan would love to have some of the real, the real deal. I was, um,

1396
02:16:10,040 --> 02:16:14,920
18 when I had absence. It's been a little while, but not that long.

1397
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:25,320
It's been a while. All right. Let's move on and travel around the world and check out some

1398
02:16:25,320 --> 02:16:29,320
release dates. Although I have a feeling it's going to be a quiet week, but let's check in

1399
02:16:29,320 --> 02:16:34,520
anyway. Got nothing for you. I'm sure there's some digital games coming out, but nothing's

1400
02:16:34,520 --> 02:16:38,920
on the slate. Yeah. We're done for the year at this point. We're pretty much done for the year.

1401
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:43,000
Um, mine are still loading. Do we want to go to Jamie's UK dates? Do you have those?

1402
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:50,360
They ain't jack shit. Yeah. Uh, okay. There we do have some, some, some things in, uh, Japan,

1403
02:16:50,360 --> 02:16:56,120
just a few Digimon survive is out on the Nintendo switch this week in Japan. So you have that.

1404
02:16:56,120 --> 02:17:02,920
Uh, and I think that's it. I'm leading the PS4 real quick. Did you Mon survive is there too?

1405
02:17:02,920 --> 02:17:08,840
Ninja judge tomorrow collection and shovel Knight gets a retail release in Japan. So that's what you

1406
02:17:08,840 --> 02:17:14,040
have to look forward to this week. Okay. We have a few more stories for you guys, and then we will

1407
02:17:14,040 --> 02:17:22,840
wrap it up. Uh, Loki. All right. So, um, I guess despite all of the bugs and everything, um, with

1408
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:31,480
the PlayStation four and, um, X-Box one versions of cyberpunk 2077, it is still selling, uh, like

1409
02:17:31,480 --> 02:17:39,480
crazy. They hit 13 million in sales. Um, even with the refunds factored into that as well. So

1410
02:17:40,040 --> 02:17:44,200
it's doing pretty well. I mean, I guess the game is highly anticipated, so that probably

1411
02:17:44,200 --> 02:17:51,080
counts for a lot of it, but it is good to see that it's doing well, just wish it was released

1412
02:17:51,080 --> 02:17:58,120
in the better, uh, state. But as Jamie had mentioned earlier, there was a new patch that was,

1413
02:17:58,120 --> 02:18:05,560
um, released this week. And with that, it fixed one of the bugs that was wiping save files.

1414
02:18:05,560 --> 02:18:11,240
Apparently if your save file hit a certain limit, so eight megabytes, and that could be from just

1415
02:18:11,240 --> 02:18:19,240
having a large amount of crafting items in your inventory. Um, apparently it was causing corruption

1416
02:18:19,240 --> 02:18:26,600
and it would actually, um, erase your progress, but the new apparently 1.06 hot fix claims that

1417
02:18:26,600 --> 02:18:32,200
it will prevent that, uh, from rising, but it won't fix any of your saves that you had that

1418
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:38,120
were already affected by this bug. So yeah. And then on top of that, it also improves memory

1419
02:18:38,120 --> 02:18:46,520
management and stability, which should result in fear crashes, but we'll have to see. And it's only

1420
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:54,200
15 gigabytes. So yay. Is that all? Is that that's it? Yeah. I actually think part of the reason I

1421
02:18:54,200 --> 02:18:58,200
decided to jump in and try to tell me why this week is because I was looking at like, how much

1422
02:18:58,280 --> 02:19:04,440
bandwidth have we used? Oh, we're only up to 600 gigs. Okay. We got a ways to go. I have some room.

1423
02:19:04,440 --> 02:19:08,920
So I downloaded some games. It's sad that I have to like manage things on that level now, you know,

1424
02:19:08,920 --> 02:19:20,200
but anyway, he's out of office in like less than a month. Can't wait. Um, and, uh, yeah. So cyberpunk

1425
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:23,000
it's still selling pretty well. Now, of course, we don't know how many of those were bought and

1426
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:29,400
placed under a Christmas tree or equivalent sort of thing for the holidays. Um, but we can assume

1427
02:19:29,400 --> 02:19:34,760
that maybe not as many as the internet wants us to think are like, you know, returns in waiting,

1428
02:19:34,760 --> 02:19:39,640
so to speak. I think, and I think too, this is probably one of those cases where the internet

1429
02:19:39,640 --> 02:19:43,960
is making a lot more noise than the actual reality of people that are going to the trouble

1430
02:19:43,960 --> 02:19:49,400
to return the game, or maybe even can realize that they can do it. You know, I think there's probably

1431
02:19:49,400 --> 02:19:55,240
a lot of people who are getting it for Christmas, et cetera, who don't even realizing refunded if

1432
02:19:55,240 --> 02:20:00,760
they wanted to. Yeah. Or just, there's a lot of people that realize that. Yeah, that sucks that

1433
02:20:00,760 --> 02:20:06,440
the game is all broken right now, but I also have like 700, 800 games in my backlog. So I'll just

1434
02:20:06,440 --> 02:20:11,880
put this in there with them and come back to it when it's fixed. Well, and then of course also PC

1435
02:20:11,880 --> 02:20:16,920
seems to be the least, uh, of the systems that's getting complaints. It's really about the older

1436
02:20:16,920 --> 02:20:21,800
cons or I hate saying older consoles, but it's really what it is now. The PlayStation 4, Xbox one

1437
02:20:21,800 --> 02:20:26,360
versions, because again, uh, we had that story a couple of weeks ago about how cyberpunk was, was

1438
02:20:26,360 --> 02:20:33,000
shattering the steam concurrent play records by like a lot. And I would imagine those people

1439
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:37,480
generally are having problem free experience. Well, you know, they're having Bethesda bug

1440
02:20:37,480 --> 02:20:42,520
style experiences. They're not having like the, Oh my God, this is broken type of stuff that the

1441
02:20:42,520 --> 02:20:48,520
PlayStation 4, some of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox one folks are experiencing. So, yeah. Yeah.

1442
02:20:49,160 --> 02:20:56,120
All right. Anyhow. Well, speaking of steam, let's talk about steam sales. Has anyone now, and this

1443
02:20:56,120 --> 02:21:01,480
is, this is very much a, uh, no one special question of the week, but, uh, I think it's

1444
02:21:01,480 --> 02:21:07,560
worth asking, but has anyone succumbed to the steam sale or any type of digital sale going on?

1445
02:21:07,560 --> 02:21:11,880
Well, you, you literally bought something during the show, right? I'm waiting for someone though,

1446
02:21:11,880 --> 02:21:18,120
to buy me Detroit because of presence. Oh, I forgot that that's even on PC.

1447
02:21:19,240 --> 02:21:25,080
Yeah. It's at the top of my steam one list. There you go. Um, I w I haven't picked it up yet,

1448
02:21:25,080 --> 02:21:30,200
but of course, uh, the, the great enabler, my friend, Shane, uh, happened to mention to me,

1449
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:34,200
did you look at the sale on DJ max? And I was like, I don't want to buy that again.

1450
02:21:34,200 --> 02:21:38,120
I already bought on PS4. Oh, it's really, it's down to 20 bucks now. Now it's in,

1451
02:21:38,120 --> 02:21:43,480
now it's in the range where I might buy it again. Uh, so yeah, I haven't, I haven't done it yet,

1452
02:21:43,480 --> 02:21:48,760
but I probably will pull the trigger before the new year and buy myself DJ max on steam again.

1453
02:21:48,760 --> 02:21:52,600
Uh, Loki, have you, have you gotten suckered in any of those, uh, sales yet?

1454
02:21:53,400 --> 02:22:00,600
Um, not really like my son wanted me to buy him, uh, Gary's mod. So I did that, but it wasn't on

1455
02:22:00,600 --> 02:22:04,280
sale. I actually accidentally hit something that played out all through by speaker. So I didn't

1456
02:22:04,280 --> 02:22:08,680
mean to scream into the mic. Oh, you're fine. It didn't come through on our end. So I know,

1457
02:22:08,680 --> 02:22:17,640
but it blew my ears out. Um, I, I'm looking at fuser it's down to $40, but there's still,

1458
02:22:17,640 --> 02:22:21,240
that's still a lot of money, man. And I just noticed like two people in chat were asking

1459
02:22:21,240 --> 02:22:26,040
about that too. Yeah. I have not played fuser myself. That is one of those games where again,

1460
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:30,280
Shane tried to enable me on that, which most music games he does to be fair. And, and most of the

1461
02:22:30,280 --> 02:22:34,680
time I'm I'm on board. Uh, it's just, I already bought DJ max on PlayStation four when it comes

1462
02:22:34,680 --> 02:22:41,560
to fuser. Yeah. The $60 was a little high now that it's coming down. Uh, I, I might,

1463
02:22:42,120 --> 02:22:46,600
I'm, I must see what my money, well, I guess we're all getting 600 bucks, but I'll let me see

1464
02:22:46,600 --> 02:22:50,760
where my money's at in a couple in a, in a, well, I got to hurry up before the sales.

1465
02:22:51,880 --> 02:22:58,360
Now is that $600? So like, is that like a loan from your tax refund type of thing?

1466
02:22:58,360 --> 02:23:04,520
I, I don't know. I, I don't want to talk about it here. It's just to be determined from other

1467
02:23:04,520 --> 02:23:10,040
places anyway. Oh, good point. Now see pixel pockets with some, with some good like coupon

1468
02:23:10,040 --> 02:23:16,200
clip and tips here. If you buy it on Epic, which I don't love supporting Epic right now, cause I

1469
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:22,280
really think they're in the wrong on the whole, um, you know, Apple brew ha ha, but, uh, a good

1470
02:23:22,280 --> 02:23:27,400
deal is a good deal. And basically says, if you buy it on Epic with a $10 coupon, it's 10 bucks

1471
02:23:27,400 --> 02:23:32,680
cheaper than steam. I didn't think about that. Yeah. You make a good case. My friend will leave

1472
02:23:32,680 --> 02:23:40,360
it at that. If you, if you and Shane teamed up, it would be deadly. I remember the, it's your free

1473
02:23:40,360 --> 02:23:46,760
games. They have new games on Epic game store every day now for at least the foreseeable future

1474
02:23:46,760 --> 02:23:51,720
that I have no problem taking advantage of. I'm getting it for free. Epic's paying somebody.

1475
02:23:52,280 --> 02:23:56,920
That's not my problem. So yeah, no, I have been stacking up on those games. That's for sure.

1476
02:23:57,480 --> 02:24:04,760
So, all right. Uh, so anyway, Oh, I didn't, God, we, I asked, I asked my no one special

1477
02:24:04,760 --> 02:24:09,400
question and then I didn't even get to the damn story. So let's talk about how valve now has a

1478
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:14,040
filter. Uh, so you can better hunt for your discounts during the steam sales, which, um,

1479
02:24:14,040 --> 02:24:17,800
again, is one of those things I'm kind of surprised it wasn't there before. Uh, so this is,

1480
02:24:17,800 --> 02:24:22,040
this is good because now you're not overwhelmed with the fact that pretty much the entire store

1481
02:24:22,040 --> 02:24:27,000
is on sale. So they have what's called faceted browsing. So you narrow down what you're looking

1482
02:24:27,640 --> 02:24:34,520
while you're looking for the sales. So you use categories like visuals, themes, mood features,

1483
02:24:34,520 --> 02:24:40,360
and you can of course combine these. It sounds a lot like tab tags on games. So for example,

1484
02:24:40,360 --> 02:24:45,240
if you tell steam, I want to see third person sci-fi games, well, then steam will say, here

1485
02:24:45,240 --> 02:24:50,200
you go, dead space three and star Wars battlefront. It sounds a lot like tabs, but it's not going to

1486
02:24:50,200 --> 02:24:56,840
show every discounted game, but some of the more notable ones. So interesting. Uh, and I'm sure,

1487
02:24:56,840 --> 02:25:00,520
Hey, any way that they can put the games you want to see in front of you? Cause I will say

1488
02:25:00,520 --> 02:25:04,280
it is weird how steam just kind of, I feel like it's throwing everything in the kitchen sink at

1489
02:25:04,280 --> 02:25:08,120
me, uh, when I log into steam and look at some of that stuff. So I think it's a good idea to

1490
02:25:08,120 --> 02:25:16,040
highlight some of the big deals. Um, and, and yeah, otherwise, uh, sharing with friends and

1491
02:25:16,040 --> 02:25:19,560
stuff is a good way to get the news around. Cause that's how I found out about, you know,

1492
02:25:19,560 --> 02:25:26,040
both fuser and, uh, DJ backs going on sale. So, all right, let's move on to dark Sakura.

1493
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:34,600
There is a new game being, uh, uh, announced actually being developed by, um,

1494
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:39,800
arc system works and we know the awesomeness of arc system for their fighting games.

1495
02:25:39,800 --> 02:25:49,640
Um, but they are doing a, uh, dungeon fighter, uh, fighting game, DNF, uh, DNF dual. Um, so it's

1496
02:25:49,640 --> 02:25:57,640
being published by, uh, is it meeple Neopole and developed by arc system works. Um, and aiding,

1497
02:25:57,640 --> 02:26:04,200
uh, they have announced the game, uh, it's based in unreal engine as a spinoff off the RPG dungeon

1498
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:11,960
fighter online. Um, and so, uh, they haven't announced like platforms, uh, no real release,

1499
02:26:11,960 --> 02:26:19,160
uh, window, but it looks pretty freaking cool. I'm just saying, you know, I, I love practically

1500
02:26:19,160 --> 02:26:28,840
anything that, that arc has done in this one really seems to be no, uh, no, uh, no less

1501
02:26:28,840 --> 02:26:35,640
impressive than any of their guilty gear or any of those games. So, uh, Dr. C and chat says I used

1502
02:26:35,640 --> 02:26:42,680
to play a ton of dungeon fighters. So an arc says fighting game has me curious. Yeah. If I will,

1503
02:26:42,680 --> 02:26:49,000
I will, uh, share the, uh, the video in our chat room for those there. And for folks who are

1504
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:55,000
playing the home version of the game, uh, look it up. All right. Um, one more story here from

1505
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:59,080
Loki, and then we'll open it up to the listener round table and check our mailbag Loki.

1506
02:26:59,720 --> 02:27:04,440
It's a remaster that none of us have been waiting for, but it's still pretty cool. So

1507
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:11,480
probably soon to be featured on, um, games done quick, but I want to be the guy has a brand new

1508
02:27:11,480 --> 02:27:19,640
remaster after 13 years. And so they said this, uh, it's mostly faithfully are the mostly faithful

1509
02:27:19,640 --> 02:27:24,840
remaster of the original. I want to be the guy, uh, trying to balance the spirit of the original

1510
02:27:24,840 --> 02:27:30,920
game with the desire for a consistent physics, like the fan games that came after in fixing some

1511
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:38,600
of the jank. And so it's available for free. Uh, basically what it is converted the game from the

1512
02:27:38,600 --> 02:27:46,920
original multimedia fusion to project, to the U the U two engine, which apparently is also referred

1513
02:27:46,920 --> 02:27:53,400
to as I want to be the engine. So, uh, kind of fun. They've been using that for a lot of the

1514
02:27:53,400 --> 02:28:00,280
different fan, um, games, which there are quite a few of, and, um, apparently it is officially

1515
02:28:00,280 --> 02:28:04,840
endorsed by the original creator as well, calling it the perfect package for anyone that wants to

1516
02:28:04,840 --> 02:28:11,800
try the game out in 2020. So, uh, definitely go track it down, but, uh, yeah, pretty, pretty

1517
02:28:11,800 --> 02:28:15,960
exciting, especially with it right around the corner. Yeah. Or probably being featured in,

1518
02:28:15,960 --> 02:28:21,160
I know they have the fan game. I want to be the fan game is in, um, games done quick.

1519
02:28:21,160 --> 02:28:25,160
So there's usually one or a few of these that are featured each year.

1520
02:28:26,280 --> 02:28:30,200
Nice. Good note to end on. Cause I know that game's come up quite a few times on this show.

1521
02:28:30,200 --> 02:28:34,920
It's kind of cool to see a remaster after all these years too. So yeah. Very cool. All right.

1522
02:28:34,920 --> 02:28:39,480
Well, that was our last slotted story for tonight. We will take a trip to the listener round table.

1523
02:28:39,480 --> 02:28:43,400
If you guys have any questions or things you want to add in our chat room, now's a great time over

1524
02:28:43,400 --> 02:28:48,200
twitch.tv slash a VOG network. And I'll check in on emails in just a moment, but I want to address

1525
02:28:48,200 --> 02:28:53,240
this round table questions already came in from no one special. Who's saying what's I know. What's

1526
02:28:53,240 --> 02:28:57,880
the best game that came out this year is the easy go-to question, but I want to, what's the worst

1527
02:28:57,880 --> 02:29:02,760
basically. I'm going to hold onto that question actually. Uh, no one's special, sorry. And just

1528
02:29:02,760 --> 02:29:08,280
kind of instead tease next week, since I anticipated it'll be another slow news week with

1529
02:29:08,280 --> 02:29:13,160
new years and everything, although anything can happen next week, we will talk about our favorite

1530
02:29:13,160 --> 02:29:17,720
games of the year. You'll notice the wording I use there is not the best games of the year. It's

1531
02:29:17,720 --> 02:29:22,280
our best games of the year. We will talk about that. And just for, you know, in special, we will

1532
02:29:22,280 --> 02:29:27,080
talk about the worst as well. Um, although I honestly, nothing is jumping to the front of my

1533
02:29:27,080 --> 02:29:30,600
mind, but I'm sure if I check my history of some things I've looked at, I'll find something where

1534
02:29:30,600 --> 02:29:33,800
I was like, Oh yeah, I didn't care for that. So we'll get into that. So I'm going to tease that

1535
02:29:33,800 --> 02:29:41,160
for next week. We will do that. Um. Something, and this was completely my bad. We never did do

1536
02:29:41,160 --> 02:29:45,160
predictions this year. And that was my bad because I kept putting it off in January and then it

1537
02:29:45,160 --> 02:29:51,960
never happened. And then who could have, we did. I thought we didn't. Did we swear we did. Well,

1538
02:29:51,960 --> 02:29:57,560
I was going to say the Darth Vader tin. We did that this year. I thought we didn't do it this

1539
02:29:57,560 --> 02:30:03,640
year. Now we did because the previous year I had re I'd stuck the ones from the previous year in

1540
02:30:03,640 --> 02:30:09,160
there as well. My thought was it's going to have the previous year stuff still in it. So I was

1541
02:30:09,160 --> 02:30:14,440
going to open it anyway. Yeah, it should have. Yeah. All right. Well then we'll open it and

1542
02:30:14,440 --> 02:30:19,320
we'll see, maybe I'll open it and I'll go, it's fucking nothing, but we'll see. I thought, yeah,

1543
02:30:19,320 --> 02:30:23,640
SG100 Matt says we didn't. You see, he's with me. We, I thought we skipped it, but we'll see.

1544
02:30:23,640 --> 02:30:26,840
Was it, maybe you, maybe you just fucking wrote it down and put it in there.

1545
02:30:29,720 --> 02:30:35,080
So anyway, I would have, we will open that up next week as well. And this time we will

1546
02:30:35,080 --> 02:30:39,800
put predictions in next week. I don't know how I let it slip this year. I thought I let it slip,

1547
02:30:39,800 --> 02:30:43,640
but maybe I didn't, but we will make sure we get back on track with that for next year.

1548
02:30:43,640 --> 02:30:47,560
But I admit it's, it's funny because my brain is like, there's no way we could have fucking

1549
02:30:47,560 --> 02:30:55,560
predicted what happened this year. Like, no. Um, so it will be interesting to see for next year.

1550
02:30:55,560 --> 02:31:01,720
Cause you know, I'm thinking things like D did dragon con happen this year or did they put it

1551
02:31:01,720 --> 02:31:05,480
off or did they do a smaller one? Those are some of the interesting questions I have right now.

1552
02:31:05,480 --> 02:31:13,480
So, uh, we'll see. Anyway, next week. So best of, worst of, the rest of, and this gives us one more

1553
02:31:13,480 --> 02:31:19,240
week of holiday time to play some games and just make sure, you know, the lists are where we want

1554
02:31:19,240 --> 02:31:26,200
them to be. So we'll go over that next week. Um, anyway, uh, emails, uh, you guys send us emails

1555
02:31:26,200 --> 02:31:31,160
every week. No, they don't. No, they don't. Not tonight. Well, let me get, let me give the address

1556
02:31:31,160 --> 02:31:35,720
at least for next time. If you want to send us an email for use on a future show, participate

1557
02:31:35,720 --> 02:31:40,040
at orange lounge, radio.com is the place to send us an email. We do keep an eye on the Twitter.

1558
02:31:40,040 --> 02:31:44,200
I know I don't expressly read tweets here on the show. Sometimes I just respond to them.

1559
02:31:44,200 --> 02:31:49,960
Uh, but you could tweet us at OLR, uh, is where you can find us on Twitter. And a lot of us use

1560
02:31:49,960 --> 02:31:54,200
Twitter personally. This would, our soccer is kind of on there full time now. So we're all on Twitter

1561
02:31:54,200 --> 02:31:59,400
as well under our own accounts. Uh, I am at Mr. Rob Roberts because the spammer took Rob Roberts,

1562
02:31:59,400 --> 02:32:03,480
but I'm Mr. Rob Roberts. Dark soccer is that you're just at dark soccer, right? You were

1563
02:32:03,480 --> 02:32:09,560
able to get that name, which I have had forever. Yep. And then Loki is at Loki, OLR, right? Yep.

1564
02:32:09,560 --> 02:32:15,800
And everything. Although I will tell people 90% of what I talk about is still, uh, um,

1565
02:32:15,800 --> 02:32:24,600
supernatural fan link. So just saying, uh, mine is sassy, whatever. And I always say to myself,

1566
02:32:24,600 --> 02:32:28,280
don't tweet anything political, don't tweet anything. And then I do it. I can't keep my

1567
02:32:28,280 --> 02:32:32,760
mouth shut. I can't, I just, there's, there's a lot to say. It just happens. It just happens.

1568
02:32:33,800 --> 02:32:40,600
I just like, like, oops, I politicked again. Yeah. He will write something on his Twitter

1569
02:32:40,600 --> 02:32:45,800
and then I can't help, but write something nasty in response. I just, I can't help myself.

1570
02:32:46,440 --> 02:32:51,480
You know, it's funny. Okay. So first of all, I've never followed it's Twitter because it is

1571
02:32:51,480 --> 02:32:57,800
not a human in my brain. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but I've just been referring to calling it

1572
02:32:57,800 --> 02:33:03,800
the tyrant. Yeah, that's fair. Anyway. Uh, I, I read a great idea somewhere that was,

1573
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:10,360
if you forgot, if you had one of those, um, Christmas candy calendars that you can like

1574
02:33:10,360 --> 02:33:14,920
pop out all the, is that what they call them? They're called advent calendars. Okay. Yeah.

1575
02:33:14,920 --> 02:33:20,680
And if you forgot to use that this year, if you start, I think it was today or yesterday,

1576
02:33:20,680 --> 02:33:25,880
it can now be a countdown to the inauguration. So you can down for that.

1577
02:33:29,480 --> 02:33:33,640
Oh man, such a good idea. I feel like I could have capitalized on that.

1578
02:33:33,640 --> 02:33:37,960
So dark soccer, you may not celebrate Christmas, but you can celebrate that.

1579
02:33:39,160 --> 02:33:44,440
I celebrate, I celebrate gift-mas. Yeah, that's fair. That's fair. By the way, Rob,

1580
02:33:44,440 --> 02:33:50,760
and I, I know I tagged you in this, but, um, but Dan saw how disappointed I was that we couldn't

1581
02:33:50,760 --> 02:33:59,160
have a gay Joomis. Yeah. And so he tried like four different places to try to get me Chinese food.

1582
02:33:59,160 --> 02:34:04,760
And then last night, bless him, bless his heart in the positive Southern sense,

1583
02:34:05,720 --> 02:34:11,720
he got me Chinese food and I'm still eating it today. There was a feature in the local paper

1584
02:34:11,720 --> 02:34:16,120
about restaurants open on Christmas day. And there seemed to be a lot more this year,

1585
02:34:16,120 --> 02:34:19,800
but it was, it wasn't stuff in suburbia where you and I are, it was stuff downtown.

1586
02:34:19,800 --> 02:34:23,880
Like, um, Bombay, the Indian place apparently was open on Christmas. I never knew they were

1587
02:34:23,880 --> 02:34:27,080
open on Christmas. Apparently they're open every Christmas. I'm like, well,

1588
02:34:27,080 --> 02:34:30,200
shit. That's what dark soccer and I need to change our tradition to Indian food.

1589
02:34:31,400 --> 02:34:37,720
You know what? Hey, it's an Asia. So, uh, and then I think there was,

1590
02:34:37,720 --> 02:34:42,040
there's a lot of places downtown that, that are open, uh, on credit. Cause a lot of restaurants

1591
02:34:42,040 --> 02:34:50,040
need the business. It's really sad, but it's true. You know, it's so, it's so sad. Um, but, uh,

1592
02:34:51,560 --> 02:34:58,680
I, I just, I don't, I don't know, just this whole thing just got me. Like I did not have

1593
02:34:58,680 --> 02:35:03,640
a good Christmas. Dan wasn't into it. It feels like it didn't happen. I didn't,

1594
02:35:03,640 --> 02:35:07,320
I didn't go see my dad. I didn't see Alan's family. Like it just feels like it didn't

1595
02:35:07,320 --> 02:35:15,320
happen this year for me. The other thing too, is that, you know, Dan's mom died at the beginning

1596
02:35:15,320 --> 02:35:24,920
of the year and you know, my dad died and it just neither of us were really in any kind of spirit

1597
02:35:24,920 --> 02:35:29,640
for it. You know, I hear you. It's been, and I think that's okay. I think if Christmas for you

1598
02:35:29,640 --> 02:35:34,120
was just a mental health decompression, I don't want to adult today kind of day.

1599
02:35:35,080 --> 02:35:42,040
I think that's totally fine. That was it. I didn't want to think or exist. I mean,

1600
02:35:42,040 --> 02:35:47,880
and by exist as like, I didn't want to participate in living. Yeah. I mean,

1601
02:35:48,680 --> 02:35:54,280
I guess that makes sense. You're not saying it in a, in a alarming way. You're saying it in a,

1602
02:35:54,280 --> 02:36:03,080
I, today I don't exist to anyone but me. Yeah. It was just like, I, I took myself out of the

1603
02:36:03,080 --> 02:36:07,560
equation. Yeah. I'm a ghost today. You don't see me. This sheet over my body, this blanket means

1604
02:36:07,560 --> 02:36:17,000
you don't see me. I'm John Cena. You can't see me. So anyway, I actually, you want to know,

1605
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:23,160
it's funny. I'm working on Supernatural fan fiction, right? You tweet about it a lot, right?

1606
02:36:23,480 --> 02:36:35,800
I put out published 25 chapters in a month. Dang. That's good. And I wrote three chapters

1607
02:36:35,800 --> 02:36:41,400
and published them in three days. Nice. And I have another one written that I haven't published

1608
02:36:41,400 --> 02:36:48,680
and I'm almost done with another. Busy, busy. Yeah, but that's how much, how little I've

1609
02:36:48,680 --> 02:36:52,760
wanted to participate in the real world right now. But I understand you got to do what you

1610
02:36:52,760 --> 02:36:57,800
got to do. I've been, I've honestly been losing myself in work, but in a good way. Like I, I

1611
02:36:57,800 --> 02:37:00,840
literally enjoys the thing. I get to work on creative projects and stuff. So I've just been

1612
02:37:00,840 --> 02:37:06,200
kind of like going in that and I'm just like, I am happy with this. The only thing, the only thing

1613
02:37:07,720 --> 02:37:11,640
is some of the toys that I get to use at work. I'm like, God, I wish I had this for all our,

1614
02:37:11,640 --> 02:37:16,200
cause I've actually, I have access to creative cloud. I have all of Adobe stuff. So I'm like,

1615
02:37:16,200 --> 02:37:19,880
I want to also has access to creative cloud. Oh, do you, do you have it for yourself? I

1616
02:37:19,880 --> 02:37:24,200
didn't know that. Yeah, cause I still do freelance. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. That's nice.

1617
02:37:24,200 --> 02:37:29,240
So if you ever need to use, I can't have it installed on your computer,

1618
02:37:29,240 --> 02:37:35,080
but you can come over and use premiere or anything. So, um, and by the way, um, back to

1619
02:37:35,080 --> 02:37:43,240
my fanfic thing, if you want it, message me on, uh, Twitter at dark Sakura and I will provide you

1620
02:37:43,240 --> 02:37:48,040
with a link. Sounds good. All right. Well, I guess we're getting to that wrap up time, uh,

1621
02:37:48,040 --> 02:37:51,800
here at the show. So I want to thank everybody for checking out our show tonight, whether you

1622
02:37:51,800 --> 02:37:55,640
were here live or you are participating on the podcast feed. Uh, thank you so much for listening

1623
02:37:55,640 --> 02:38:00,760
to our show. Uh, a nice word, uh, about the show. Word of mouth goes a long way. Tell a friend or

1624
02:38:00,760 --> 02:38:03,720
two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has

1625
02:38:03,720 --> 02:38:08,680
a voice, but without the voices here, uh, we've got nothing to say. Uh, and you know, as I

1626
02:38:08,680 --> 02:38:12,520
mentioned earlier in the show, it's really you guys that have kept us going for 18 and a half

1627
02:38:12,520 --> 02:38:17,720
years throughout all of this and this craziness. Um, we don't ask for your money, but if you do

1628
02:38:17,720 --> 02:38:22,040
feel so inclined to support the show in that kind of way, um, it, it is very helpful and helps us

1629
02:38:22,040 --> 02:38:26,440
to maintain the business, uh, side of things. So a big thank you for the bits and the subs.

1630
02:38:26,440 --> 02:38:30,600
I'll acknowledge those after the program, but I also want to say a quick shout out to the online

1631
02:38:30,600 --> 02:38:36,120
store. Um, so if you want to check out some online merch, go to vog network.com slash shop,

1632
02:38:36,120 --> 02:38:40,200
and you can check out some t-shirts and some stickers so you can make anything in OLR piece

1633
02:38:40,200 --> 02:38:44,120
of merchandise, but make sure you have permission. Don't go, don't go sticking it on archaic phone

1634
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:48,760
booths and things like that. That's vandalism. Uh, but, uh, you can get stickers and, and there

1635
02:38:48,760 --> 02:38:52,760
will be more to come in the new year. We're going to try to slowly trickle out some things there

1636
02:38:52,760 --> 02:38:58,760
on the shop. So appreciate, uh, all the support there as well. Um, otherwise I think that does it

1637
02:38:58,760 --> 02:39:03,640
and it's time to get everybody's final thoughts. The last final thoughts of 2020, the next time

1638
02:39:03,640 --> 02:39:10,040
we come to you 2021, sadly, new year's day is not going to magically fix all of our problems,

1639
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:15,320
but we see the light. The real year starts on January 24th.

1640
02:39:15,320 --> 02:39:21,480
I well, and, and even more so when I can get the jab quite fresh six weeks after I get the jab,

1641
02:39:21,480 --> 02:39:28,440
quite frankly, but, uh, yes, uh, we'll be, we'll be, there's lots to look forward to in 2021 and

1642
02:39:28,440 --> 02:39:34,360
we'll put it at that. So let's get everybody's final thoughts for the night. Um, Loki,

1643
02:39:34,360 --> 02:39:37,800
I'll start with you. I'm just going to continue working on my game,

1644
02:39:38,760 --> 02:39:42,600
hopefully make progress, more progress than I did release it in 2021.

1645
02:39:44,440 --> 02:39:49,560
It will definitely be released in 2021. I owe you a pizza and probably January. I'd

1646
02:39:49,560 --> 02:39:53,880
see most likely January. I just want to rush through green levels, but you don't rush. Like I,

1647
02:39:54,840 --> 02:39:59,880
I just want to get the animated tiles to look awesome to saying, I know the listeners are

1648
02:39:59,880 --> 02:40:03,720
going to yell at me, but seriously, if cyberpunk has taught us anything, if you need to tell

1649
02:40:04,040 --> 02:40:09,640
February, take till February, you know, take, I can't patch a card. Exactly. Cause you've

1650
02:40:09,640 --> 02:40:13,640
got people that now, now this is becoming more than a, Oh, I'll download it and play it. This

1651
02:40:13,640 --> 02:40:18,440
is becoming a, I want the collector's edition from Loki. So you got to get it right, buddy.

1652
02:40:18,440 --> 02:40:23,320
Well, I got to get suppliers for that stuff anyway. So that may take time. All right. Fair

1653
02:40:23,320 --> 02:40:28,680
enough. Fair enough. All right. Um, so let's move on to, uh, I'll go, I'll go my final thought. Um,

1654
02:40:28,680 --> 02:40:31,720
I don't, I don't have a lot cause I think I already kind of gushed earlier in the show,

1655
02:40:31,720 --> 02:40:35,560
but again, just a big thank you to everybody who supported us throughout this crazy year.

1656
02:40:35,560 --> 02:40:43,320
And, um, I look forward to 2021 and the hopefulness that 2021 brings and, uh,

1657
02:40:43,320 --> 02:40:50,360
the renewed sense of I'm going to have a list of things I want to do. And now I'm going to do them

1658
02:40:50,360 --> 02:40:56,200
because if 2020 taught me anything, it's that one day I might not. So I'm going to do my

1659
02:40:56,200 --> 02:41:01,960
damnedest to try to get them done in 2021 when it's safe to do so. Uh, dark soccer,

1660
02:41:01,960 --> 02:41:10,040
your final thought. I don't know. Uh, if you can be anything,

1661
02:41:10,040 --> 02:41:19,080
be kind. And if you can't be kind, be Batman. Working on it. Have a great week, everybody.

1662
02:41:19,080 --> 02:41:23,880
Happy new year. Be safe. I mean, I shouldn't tell you things like don't drink and drive

1663
02:41:23,880 --> 02:41:28,440
cause you shouldn't be going to parties where there's drinking anyway. Um, but make good

1664
02:41:28,440 --> 02:41:32,680
choices. We'll leave it at that. Um, have a great week. There, there is still a pandemic.

1665
02:41:32,680 --> 02:41:38,520
You wishing it away doesn't change it. Um, so make good choices and, um, let's be here to party

1666
02:41:38,520 --> 02:41:43,960
when we all get vaccinated in 2021. Have a great week, everybody. Good night. Happy gaming.
