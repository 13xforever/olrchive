00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,500
This week, the one-two punch of stay-at-home orders a new console launches means the GameStop

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,480
might finally turn a profit for the first quarter in multiple years.

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,520
It's a shame their forward-looking statements don't acknowledge how short-lived this will

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,520
be.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,920
Digital's only getting stronger, especially with new consoles launching with the Diskless

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,920
edition.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,800
Customers may buy the console from GameStop, but what happens for the next five or more

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,800
years?

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,280
With one company continuing its low decline in obsolescence, it's time for your hosts,

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,560
Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to give their opinions on this and the rest of the

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,920
week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,360
Hello, my friends out there on this internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,560
where every gamer has a voice.

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:54,920
It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again tonight with episode number 847 for this December

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:02,200
the 13th of 2020, which kind of marks our two-year anniversary of sorts on Twitch.

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,400
Now, granted, this show's been around way too long.

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,800
We started in June of 2002, so we've been around about 18 and a half years, if you can

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,800
believe it.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,840
We were doing shoutcasts before, but this is the two-year anniversary of Twitch because

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,280
we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at VOG Network,

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,200
twitch.tv slash VOG Network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,080
I am Rob Roberts here in studio with you guys joining me.

23
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,240
As always, I'm going to start with tech master Loki tonight.

24
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,240
Hi, Loki.

25
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,240
How are you?

26
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,240
Hello.

27
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,240
Hi.

28
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,240
I'm good.

29
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,240
Good.

30
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,860
So a big shock reveal last night.

31
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,560
So I'm going to spoiler the last episode if you haven't heard yet, but Loki's game was

32
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,560
finally revealed.

33
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,560
Oh, you mean last week?

34
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,560
Yeah.

35
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
Actually, just last week, man.

36
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,560
Time is flying.

37
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,560
Time is flying.

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
Yeah, it was just last week.

39
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,640
Well, we had that extra show, kind of, because we did the Game Awards thing here at VOG on

40
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,640
Thursday night.

41
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,220
But anyway, yeah, it was last week when you kind of shocked us.

42
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:09,120
You and Aaron shocked us with the reveal that the game you have been talking about for months

43
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,920
and months on the show that you've been working on is actually a version of Pixel Poops.

44
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,740
It's Pixel Poops number two, appropriate, for the NES, or Nintendo Entertainment System.

45
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,100
So great job on that twist reveal.

46
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,860
That was great.

47
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,340
And kudos.

48
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:32,060
Bobby was the first guest in chat that potentially one reason you were being a little clammed

49
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,960
up about it was that it was kind of someone else's sort of thing.

50
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,460
He didn't guess exactly how it went, but close to coordinate.

51
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:45,100
We did discuss that we're going to do some sort of direct thing, and it didn't push back,

52
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,540
but we had to coordinate stuff.

53
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,540
So that's why.

54
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,140
Yeah, yeah, no, but you guys did a great job on that direct and really shocked us and the

55
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,980
folks in chat.

56
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,160
So now is the first week where I can officially ask you, how is development on Pixel Poops

57
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,160
number two going?

58
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,460
I haven't done a whole lot this week.

59
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,260
It's mainly just been research.

60
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:11,340
I've been trying to figure out how to do animated tiles because it's a lot of trickery involving

61
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,980
switching memory banks and stuff on the fly in order to be, I have to reset up all my

62
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,500
graphics if I want to do that or just rearrange my tiles.

63
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,020
So that's what I've been researching this week for part of the week.

64
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,220
And then Cyberpunk came out and nothing got done after that.

65
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,840
So I'll probably go back to it again.

66
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,780
It's mainly just been research this week.

67
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:37,120
I've been going through the code that's in there for Nest Maker and their libraries that

68
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,280
they have for doing care, the C.H.R. file loads to load the graphic data and just seeing

69
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,520
how they refresh it and stuff.

70
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,080
I know it's possible to do that.

71
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,880
I just have to figure out how to do that and how I need to store my data in there.

72
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:57,940
It's real complicated when you do Nest stuff, but I kind of give myself to like today to

73
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,640
figure it out.

74
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,720
And if I don't, I'm just going to move forward with it, but I have done other things.

75
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:08,280
I've got like, so now I also have logic for the joggers to when they hit a solid wall,

76
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,120
they will turn.

77
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:14,280
So that's going to change some of the level design as well so that it can get a little

78
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,840
bit more complicated with them moving in random directions.

79
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,680
Fancy.

80
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,800
So were you surprised at the amount of people that, you know, or do you even regret saying

81
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,640
that you were thinking about doing some actual cartridge production?

82
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,920
Because obviously you got a pretty warm response in our chat and then, you know, on

83
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,080
your Facebook post, because you made a Facebook post after the show kind of telling

84
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,280
all your friends what was going on.

85
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,920
You got a lot of response there, too.

86
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:43,520
So the limited run Loki Productions basement printing press is going to be running

87
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,000
over time whenever you get this thing done.

88
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,600
Well, I, you know, to do, yeah, definitely, um, one of the things I need to do is I need

89
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:57,960
to get an actual, uh, any acid, uh, test on, so I need to get that just to test all the

90
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,880
carts after I burn them.

91
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:07,320
And then, um, I need to figure out label printing, which has actually been, cause I

92
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,400
have, um, I'm in their forum as well.

93
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,760
They have like a Facebook group and then they also have like their own forums.

94
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,720
So there's people actually discussing label printing as well.

95
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,000
I, I, a lot of them have been talking about just laminating, like any jet printed

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,280
thing, but I'd rather just get it done.

97
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,400
Uh, but I have to see how they're doing it and figure out the best way to do that.

98
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,040
All right.

99
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,640
Well, we pretty much it, we look for, we look forward to more updates on your

100
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,960
project as it, um, you know, as it shits out.

101
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,320
Um, yeah, yeah, there would have been more this week if cyberpunk didn't

102
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,480
come out, but then it did.

103
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,320
So, you know, this is why you didn't commit to a release date.

104
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,480
So people need to just be patient this week.

105
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,880
I I'll probably go back to it again, but like, I wanted to at least get a few days

106
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
of that in, yeah.

107
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:52,720
All right.

108
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,200
Uh, also say hello, of course, joining us every week.

109
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,680
Uh, say hello to dark Sakura or Jamie summers.

110
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,840
I had to unmute myself.

111
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:01,760
Hi.

112
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,360
How are you?

113
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,880
I am tired.

114
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
Yeah, I hear ya.

115
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,440
Uh, well, happy.

116
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,480
I was just to say happy Hanukkah to you.

117
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,480
Um, cause I know it's the fourth night and I gotta say, you know, with the whole

118
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,640
pandemic and everything this year in 2020, just generally being a big ball of suck.

119
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,760
I must say I am missing the OLR tradition.

120
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,480
It's the one night where Jamie willingly gets in the kitchen and bakes

121
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,120
latkes here for us on the show.

122
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,360
And I missed that this year.

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,080
I fried up some good latkes for us.

124
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,840
Uh, last year I remember.

125
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,640
Made a lot of latkes.

126
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,280
You did.

127
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,800
So, so I was going to say, if you're going to be a little shit, 10 years ago in an

128
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,840
iTunes review and say, Jamie better be in the kitchen, it better be during Hanukkah.

129
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,640
Cause that's the only time that comment is excusable here on this program.

130
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,760
I have cooked other things though.

131
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,880
You know, true.

132
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,240
You have in, in, in the history of the show and, and Loki has too.

133
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,400
I remember the deep fryer bonanza.

134
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,240
We had one episode.

135
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,200
The old deep fried rice balls with cornflake coating.

136
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,680
The old OLR you guys was wild.

137
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,160
Like, that's why I don't talk much about the pre podcast years of OLR, but we did

138
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,080
wild shit for like three hours a night.

139
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,280
And I remember there was that episode where we were deep frying things.

140
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,240
And I also remember the episode where we had the, um, and this, we didn't even have

141
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,960
a, well, I think we had the cam, but it was the camera that would update like once

142
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,920
every 30 seconds.

143
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,880
So you couldn't really see anything.

144
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,000
But that was the technology on the internet way back in the day.

145
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,160
But I remember the night we had the peep jousting live on air and we put the peeps

146
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,520
with the toothpicks and in the microwave, which I wouldn't recommend doing.

147
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,840
Cause it's disgusting.

148
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,160
Cause I hate marshmallows.

149
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,960
I know they do not like peeps.

150
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,720
It's a little funny.

151
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:49,560
The webcam that was, it was the eye toy run through a capture card.

152
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,160
That's right.

153
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,360
It was an eye toy.

154
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,880
It updated every like few seconds.

155
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,960
So, or it was like every 10, 15 seconds or whatever.

156
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,400
Cause you know, dial up and.

157
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,560
Or no, it wasn't dial up.

158
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,320
No, it wasn't dial up, but it was, uh, you know, there was certainly

159
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,000
nothing like Twitch or I don't even think YouTube had debuted just yet.

160
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,680
It was, it would, this would have been, this would have been when you

161
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,600
and I were roommates, low Loki, which was around, it wasn't the first year

162
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,840
of the show, but it wasn't long after it was about 2003, 2004 was probably when

163
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,040
those, yeah, it's like geo cities.

164
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:25,600
It was like, yeah, it was really rough, but it's, it's, it's funny

165
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,880
how we've come such a long way.

166
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,960
Anyway, Jamie, sorry.

167
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,680
Oh, we're talking about a lot cause in the chat, but, um, it's, uh, something

168
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,160
that I talk about on, on my own, uh, forums, but I don't really talk about

169
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:46,600
a whole lot on the show is a chronic fatigue syndrome and, um, it can

170
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,000
really wipe a person out.

171
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,360
And so I just wanted to reach out, basically just put a word out to

172
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,120
others who, who are, uh, are living with this, you are not alone.

173
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,480
Um, and it keeps us from playing copious amounts of DDR when we think

174
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,760
about bringing out the dance pads.

175
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:09,160
So, um, but, uh, I still have all my Bemani stuff up behind me and I, I'm

176
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,800
actually considering selling my title.

177
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,520
Oh, wow.

178
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,360
Wants to make me a good offer.

179
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,760
The beat mania stuff is going fucking nowhere because I want to figure out how

180
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,280
to, uh, if I can get that sub service that's going on for beat mania, I think

181
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:31,880
it would be cool, um, I kind of miss playing, um, I've lost like 80% of my

182
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:37,080
skill at it, you know, like when I, when we like for, uh, California extreme,

183
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,080
I just was pretty much playing, uh, uh, I beat mania three so that I could play

184
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,360
like my favorite songs and just really easy.

185
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,120
Um, but I don't know.

186
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,040
Um, I've been, uh, going hubby and I have been talking over stuff about what we

187
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,280
want to do about getting, um, like a music game room set back up in, in this

188
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:01,440
office, but then again, I want to do my crafting stuff and actually learn how

189
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,120
to use my sewing machine because, uh, I hand sewed, sewed all my shit in the

190
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,680
back and you know, in, in the old days, now I want to start using my machine

191
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,480
and, you know, get back into making my, uh, uh, costumes and stuff.

192
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,120
Um, but, uh, okay.

193
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,440
So I have to make a comment to the chat room right now, Rob.

194
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,400
Okay.

195
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:21,760
Please.

196
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:27,240
So everyone's talking about making latkes and latkes are fucking

197
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,360
easiest shit to make.

198
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:28,800
Okay.

199
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:36,480
You have recipes on the internet and they are really matzah meal, you know,

200
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,840
which is basically, you know, dried up, grumbled up matzah, um, you know,

201
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,400
and matzah is basically the, uh, the bulking fiber of the Jewish world.

202
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,680
Um, potatoes, shredded potatoes.

203
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,160
Make sure that you use a nice, good, firm potato.

204
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,680
If you want them to be, you know, have that hash brownie kind of quality egg.

205
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,200
It takes egg and salt and you can make latkes or you can go and buy a box of

206
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,480
the meneshevitz mix and follow the directions and mix that and have latkes.

207
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,640
I thought that the stuff you had, we did last year, just you followed

208
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,840
the recipe on the back of the box.

209
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:12,840
Yeah.

210
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,280
I didn't feel like shredding all those damn potatoes, although I I've

211
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,080
done it with blue potatoes before and they look really cool.

212
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:20,720
Yeah.

213
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:27,120
Um, but, uh, I'm planning on not tonight cause I'm so tired, but tomorrow

214
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,360
night, maybe after work, I'm planning on doing sweet potato latkes.

215
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,360
Oh, sweet potato.

216
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,760
I'm meh on them, but Alan loves them.

217
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,120
Well, tell him, tell Alan to go to the coaster section of the grocery store

218
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,600
and get the box sweet potato latkes.

219
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,120
Cause they're just about as good as doing the real thing.

220
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,280
Um, and, um, I've also decided that neither sour cream or

221
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,840
applesauce are superior.

222
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,720
Neither of them are, you're making me hungry.

223
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,200
All right.

224
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,320
You know, what is superior to either of those toppings?

225
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:01,760
Yes.

226
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,480
What onion jam.

227
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,360
All right.

228
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,560
Sweet onion jam.

229
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,160
All right.

230
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,120
Sweet is specifically sweet onion jam.

231
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:10,840
All right.

232
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,520
We can find the Delia onion jam.

233
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,200
You go for it.

234
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,480
We got to get into gaming talk.

235
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,640
Although these are, you know what?

236
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,920
I'm all about snacks while you're a gaming.

237
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,920
So, you know, Hey, uh, let's, uh, let's get into some video game news and what

238
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,440
happened, um, around the gaming world this week.

239
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:25,840
Yes.

240
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,640
One last thing.

241
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,280
All right.

242
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,840
Curry sauce over latkes.

243
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,040
Also delightful.

244
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,240
I wouldn't have thought of that.

245
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,840
That sounds good.

246
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,600
Curry sauce is good.

247
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,320
Okay.

248
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:34,840
One last thing.

249
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,560
I get this powdered Curry gravy stuff.

250
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,000
Um, it's British like a B store, I think is the brand, but I order it on some

251
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,800
online service or a touch of Britain down here has it, and that shit is the bomb on

252
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,680
any potato product and that's it.

253
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,400
You know, I'm sure this is already out there somewhere on YouTube, but you need

254
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,560
a nerd cooking show, a geek cooking show.

255
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm sure that exists, but not nerdy mummies and all of those, but none with you.

256
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,440
Oh, that's right.

257
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,960
Tiara has a thing going on and her blog is live now.

258
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,480
So Tiara, I know you're not listening right now, but I am

259
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,600
plugging the crap out of you.

260
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,320
Everyone needs to look at their, uh, their blog.

261
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,160
It's, uh, there and bake again.

262
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,280
I'll, I'll find a link for it in the chat room, but they're also

263
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,480
on, uh, on, uh, the YouTubes and stuff.

264
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,680
So, all right.

265
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:22,880
All right.

266
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
Uh, well, let's get in.

267
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,560
Speaking of things to watch, a lot of folks this past Thursday, we're

268
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,880
watching the game awards for this year.

269
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,000
Um, knowing that, you know, previously in previous years, Jeff Keeley's big

270
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,000
event that he's, you know, tried to make the, uh, gaming version of the Oscars.

271
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,040
And he's certainly done a lot better job than, um, some of the early,

272
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,240
uh, forays into that, that were on spike television and so forth.

273
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,240
Um, but, uh, Jeff's really gotten a good balance there and, uh, he's

274
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,240
kind of become to be known for kind of the, the winter big announcement thing.

275
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,960
You know, we have E3 usually in the summer, obviously 2020 was weird this year.

276
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,200
Um, but, uh, the game awards has been known as kind of like the big winter

277
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,640
announcement, uh, event as long, uh, along with the numerous awards that they gave out.

278
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,240
Um, and, uh, this year, obviously the pandemic made that a little

279
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,240
weird, um, but they did the show.

280
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,320
Uh, we were co-streaming it here at VOG network.

281
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,280
So some of y'all were watching the show with us.

282
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,800
Uh, myself, Loki and Bobby Black Wolf were there streaming the event.

283
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,160
I know Dark Soccer had to work.

284
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,640
Um, but, uh, we, we had a good time with it.

285
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,320
Um, and, uh, got to react to some things together.

286
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,800
Y'all saw me almost have a heart attack when that PlayStation five game came up

287
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:37,560
that had the hallway trailer and I started flip flipping my shit.

288
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,800
Cause I thought it might be PT.

289
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,680
They got me good.

290
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,760
Those bastards.

291
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,360
They got me good.

292
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,480
What, what was that game?

293
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,800
It's a, it's a sci-fi and they've shown it before.

294
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,160
It was at the PS five reveal, the sci-fi game with the female

295
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,280
protagonist of blonde hair.

296
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,440
I don't remember.

297
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,720
Yeah, no, they got me.

298
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,960
They got me good gal.

299
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,200
This is returnal.

300
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,040
That sounds right.

301
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,360
Returnal that, that does sound right.

302
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,400
Yeah, that was the, so dark soccer, if you'd seen this, you would have flipped

303
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:08,640
out to the game, started out and it shows a hallway with a door and the narrator

304
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,240
talks about like a loop and how I'm going back to where I started again.

305
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,040
And that was my, my, like literal reaction was no, like they did not

306
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,680
like that this can't like that fan wank cannot be real like the Twitter.

307
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,480
Of course they did it on purpose.

308
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,920
That's why I'm calling a little bitches anyway.

309
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,280
So that was probably something fun.

310
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,120
You got to see me react to, um, but anyway, uh, so it was a big event,

311
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,000
nothing big this year, like the X-Box series X reveal, like we got last year,

312
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,280
but all in all before Loki is going to run down the news, but quickly, um,

313
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,840
Loki, what did you think of the show as a whole?

314
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,880
Like, were you a fan?

315
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,800
Were you like, where were you at with the show as a whole?

316
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,800
And then we'll run it down.

317
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,880
It was okay.

318
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,320
But there wasn't really any trailers as like, you know, super excited about,

319
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,120
like, I remember like previous years, we had like no man's sky.

320
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,080
We had, you know, some death stranding gameplay type stuff.

321
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,720
Um, you know, stuff like that.

322
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,520
They were just like, kind of like, wow, you know, that's amazing.

323
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,880
You know, I mean, I guess if I was a fan of certain series, maybe there would be

324
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,800
some trailers that would be kind of like, Ooh, you know, nothing really like

325
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,680
concrete.

326
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,160
I mean, there's some stuff that looks neat.

327
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,160
Some stuff that was just kind of, okay.

328
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,600
That's a thing now, I guess.

329
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,400
And, um, there's a few things that like some of the indie projects

330
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,360
that look really nice.

331
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:32,720
Yeah.

332
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,760
Um, but nothing like, Oh my God, this is like the next game.

333
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,960
I really am waiting for it.

334
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,000
Like literally none of the games that they showed.

335
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,880
I'm like highly anticipated for, but it's fine.

336
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,520
There was a couple I was certainly interested in and we'll get to it when

337
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,880
you, when you run down here in a minute.

338
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,400
But, um, I will say as a whole, and I said this on the Thursday broadcast,

339
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,480
let's kind of repeat it for the folks who missed it.

340
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,960
I thought Jeff and company did the best job they could, um, considering the

341
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,200
state of this year, considering the fact that the industry is all kind of crazy

342
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,560
and, you know, things are getting delayed and pushback and, you know, a lot of

343
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,040
things that were going to come out this holiday are now 2021.

344
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,040
Um, I think they really did the best job they could in giving us

345
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,200
something to look forward to.

346
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,200
I think the only kind of disappointment was that one game

347
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,800
really ran away with everything.

348
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,840
And look, I, and this is not a knock.

349
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,360
This is not a knock on last of us.

350
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,000
Part two.

351
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,760
I realize it's a controversial game in some circles.

352
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,280
I ha I have not played it.

353
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,080
Therefore I have no opinion.

354
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,880
I, it just, you know, some of the thrill is gone a little bit when, and this is

355
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,440
even true about the Oscars and that when like one thing really dominates, it's

356
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,120
kind of like, Oh, this is really like, like no shit, it was going to win game.

357
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,480
If you were paying attention the whole night, like it would have been a real

358
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,920
shock if something else had won.

359
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,880
Um, which, which has happened at the Oscars once or twice.

360
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,000
Um, like, like that year that crash won best motion picture, right.

361
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,480
When Brokeback Mountain who won like everything else, right.

362
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,080
It happens once in a great while, but for the most part, the shocks like

363
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,960
that are really rare.

364
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,640
And once a game kind of starts to sweep or a movie or whatever, a Grammy thing,

365
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,280
uh, it becomes pretty obvious what's going to happen.

366
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,120
Um, so I did like though, you know, and I know there's been a lot of discourse

367
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,320
online about some of the, like the crunch time and does that mean last

368
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,280
of us two deserves best direction?

369
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,680
I, again, haven't played the game.

370
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
Don't have an opinion.

371
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,800
I can say that that conversation, at least we're having that conversation.

372
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,040
And I think we've been talking a long time about how the game industry needs

373
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,320
to unionize and, um, there needs to probably be a greater conversation in

374
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,320
that regard and maybe this kind of becomes a catalyst to continue that

375
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,040
conversation.

376
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,400
But one thing I will applaud the game awards for is that I did feel like,

377
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,880
even though the last of us two really swept the awards and made that part

378
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,080
of it not that exciting, I did still feel like there was equal time, so to

379
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,040
speak, to hear from other award winners.

380
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,920
Like we saw the last of us, uh, team two or three times, probably

381
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,800
the developers twice.

382
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,320
I think we saw a voice actress as well, and maybe one other person,

383
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,200
but we saw the guy twice.

384
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,720
Well, we saw the Among Us team twice and they were really pleasant to see

385
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,120
because they were just, they were just four kids that were so fucking happy,

386
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,640
you know, and that was a real delight to see.

387
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,600
And again, that leads to a conversation on should Among Us even have been

388
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,600
nominated for best mobile game when it came out in 2018?

389
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
That's not for me to answer.

390
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,320
Uh, it's, I guess it's up to the game awards and that feedback, but.

391
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,840
You know, I will say it was, their speech was goddamn pleasant, you know,

392
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,560
and I was happy for them and I didn't care when that game released.

393
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,080
You know what I mean?

394
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,400
So at least I felt like, even if there's this conversation about, uh, you

395
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,160
know, Oh, last of us part two was, was toxic in some ways to our industry

396
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:56,680
and so forth, um, I feel like there were lights shined on other things too,

397
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,200
where it didn't like ruin, like I'm not sitting here going, Oh, the whole

398
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,720
award show is tainted because of it.

399
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,480
Because I think it is really awesome that Jeff has an award category to

400
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,080
call out accessibility, which is something that last of us two really shined on.

401
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,200
And that, that award is hard to fucking argue with that last of us two really

402
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,640
went out of their way when it came to accessibility this year, although I

403
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,320
thought I was not aware that some of the other games nominated like that grounded

404
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,000
game, I didn't know they had a mode where if you're arachnophobic, you

405
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,160
turn the spiders into floating disks.

406
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,040
You basically remove the legs and the hair.

407
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,440
Yeah.

408
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,800
I thought I was like, Oh, that's kind of rad.

409
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,600
I didn't know that.

410
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,160
Yeah.

411
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,920
We kind of covered that on the show a while ago.

412
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,720
Um, but yeah, it was kind of, I thought it just removed them

413
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,800
from the game altogether.

414
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,800
I didn't realize it turned to like some, like, you know, uh, animation,

415
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,040
like a stand-in type thing, like a blob.

416
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,840
Yeah.

417
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,880
I don't kind of look funny.

418
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,320
Yeah.

419
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,560
Um, so some folks in chat, so Bobby in chat says I wanted a Hades to win more.

420
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,320
Um, you know, and I, I, I loved Hades.

421
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,160
It's, it's probably my game of the year.

422
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,520
Stay tuned to find out for sure.

423
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,480
Um, but, uh, I, I, on one hand, I kind of get it, you know, if you look at

424
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,240
Metacritic, um, not that I put a whole lot of stock in Metacritic, but what

425
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,640
was the number one reviewed game on Metacritic that originally released

426
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,200
this year, um, because persona five, uh, Royal edition is, is up there.

427
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,400
But that is, you know, it's a repackaging, which, you know, who knows if that would

428
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,040
have, it should have made it eligible or not, I don't know, but, uh, the next one

429
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,840
up there is the last of us part two.

430
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,960
So it's, it's not.

431
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,160
Surprising, you know, and, uh, we, we know it's done by a panel of

432
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,960
journalists that are very similar to the type of people you see on Metacritic.

433
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,600
So you can kind of read the tea leaves a little bit there.

434
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,960
The audience vote is only like 10% of it.

435
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,560
It's not enough to really sway it hard in one direction or another.

436
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,840
And of course, lots of people talking about animal crossing, you know, which

437
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,080
obviously I don't have to wait two weeks to know that that's dark soccer is game

438
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,640
of the year and plenty of other people's as well, just because of, you know, what

439
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,200
it brought our 2020 world, you know, and the, and all this stuff.

440
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:09,880
So.

441
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,480
I will say at least one kind of nice thing was that even while the last of

442
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,200
us to kind of swept the table, it did feel like everything else that was

443
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,200
nominated for game of the war game of the year won something like no one

444
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,360
really went home empty handed.

445
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,600
I don't think like, um, the final fantasy seven remake got best music, right?

446
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,880
Hades got best action game, which was actually really surprising.

447
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,880
Animal crossing got best family game.

448
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,960
Um, I'm missing one of them.

449
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,120
Um, I'm a ghost of Sushi mug won something.

450
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,640
I don't remember what it was, but they won something as well.

451
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,400
So sound design, I think.

452
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:44,800
Yeah.

453
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,840
So actually do maternal may have been screwed.

454
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,320
I don't think they won anything.

455
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,960
Um, but I, they won a lot of hearts.

456
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,240
Uh, literally they tore lots of hearts out of demons chests and

457
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,440
that's what you do in do maternal.

458
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:55,600
No.

459
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,840
Uh, but it did seem like there were like, there was a little bit of, uh, Oprah,

460
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,840
you know, you get an award and you get an award, so, you know, I don't know.

461
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,280
Anyway.

462
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:04,800
All right.

463
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,560
Let's, let's talk about some of the big announcements.

464
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:06,880
I'm sorry.

465
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,440
I went on a little tangent there, but it's, it's a lot of the things that

466
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,880
gamers are talking about this week.

467
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,880
So, but Loki, what were some of the big reveals?

468
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:19,760
Um, so we saw a gameplay trailer for back for blood, which is the new

469
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:24,160
Turok game, the folks behind left for dead, it's basically left for

470
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,400
dead without calling it left for dead.

471
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,560
So I was, I know when I saw it, I was like, did Val finally make a game

472
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,800
with three forgetting that the studio, I forgot that whole thing, even though

473
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,960
we talked about it on this show, but we talk about a lot on this show.

474
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,160
So, uh, that way it was, it was nice to see that night.

475
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,680
I know that game will have its fans for sure.

476
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:50,080
Yeah, there was the, um, dragon combat game, century age of ashes.

477
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,920
They look kind of cool.

478
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,120
A little bit Panzer drag.

479
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:57,000
I was getting a heavy Panzer dragoon vibe and I was like, Oh, I didn't

480
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
think it reminds me a lot of layer though.

481
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,880
I mean, layer is more like kind of like that, but we'll see.

482
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,320
I don't know.

483
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,160
It looked neat from the trailer.

484
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,480
Yeah.

485
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,160
Uh, there was the game season, which was that kind of, uh, foot.

486
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,400
It looked like almost like photographing nature or something

487
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
like that, that really style.

488
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:15,880
Oh yeah.

489
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,080
It was very stylized.

490
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,560
Very good looking.

491
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:17,800
Yeah.

492
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,320
Yeah.

493
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,200
So that was cool.

494
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:25,200
Um, there's a, that was at road 96, that game about hitchhiking.

495
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,040
It looks like, so that was interesting.

496
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,200
Um, a lot of road trip games this year.

497
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:30,920
Yes.

498
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:35,280
Uh, speaking of that, there was also open roads, which was a mother

499
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,480
daughter searching for the truth about their deceased grandmother.

500
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,680
Um, so that's kind of it.

501
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,200
Actually, it looks like, so I believe I need a Wiki expert is dark Tetsuya

502
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,960
standing by, didn't we have a dream game called grandma's got a gun or something

503
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,720
like that, that was like one of the older, no, no, no, no, no, no.

504
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,760
So that one was basically a four player, like shooter game that was starring.

505
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,400
I know, but golden girls, but okay.

506
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,040
Yes, that was it.

507
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,480
But okay.

508
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,240
But I still, still, when I saw this trailer, I was like, Oh, they're using

509
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,240
gangster granny as a plot device.

510
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,400
I'm in it and it's by the gone home people.

511
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,760
I'm into this, that look, I, you have my attention.

512
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,280
That was my reaction to that trailer.

513
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,840
You have my attention and some big, Oh, there was some big Hollywood

514
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,640
names in that, right?

515
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,120
Carrie Russell, I think was in that, uh, Felicity.

516
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,440
Yeah.

517
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,080
So it's interesting because, um, you know, there was certainly a big period

518
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,240
of time where Hollywood wasn't making anything because of everything going on.

519
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,960
So I'm sure you had a lot of celebrities that suddenly became, uh, available

520
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,280
for voice acting talent as well.

521
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,840
Not to detract from the many voice actors that we, we love in the gaming

522
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,360
industry, but, uh, there's tons of projects to go around.

523
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:44,880
That's for sure.

524
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,400
So it's interesting to see some, some big, um, uh, TV and film talent

525
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,520
coming into voice, some games.

526
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,760
And speaking of, uh, talent, uh, we had a, a trailer starring Vin diesel,

527
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,720
which I swear to God that that was going to be another Riddick game,

528
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,480
but it ended up being arc too.

529
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,160
And it's just totally, I was getting to her.

530
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,000
I was like, is it a horizon spinoff?

531
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,920
Like what, because that, that was the big vibe I was getting, but then

532
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,040
when they said it was arc, I was like, oh yeah, like I've played only a

533
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,840
little bit of arc.

534
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,200
I, I find that it doesn't hold your hand very well in the beginning of the game.

535
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,480
I had a hard time following it.

536
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,040
Um, but, uh, I have friends that are really into it.

537
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,880
So, um, and I know the game's doing very well, so it made sense.

538
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,360
Once I heard it was arc, I was like, oh, okay.

539
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,000
I guess it could be that, although none of this is gameplay.

540
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,400
No.

541
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:34,560
Yeah.

542
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,920
Um, and then they had, uh, another trailer for a cult, the Calisto

543
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,840
project, which is by the folks that did dead space and it looks very dead space.

544
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:52,320
So, um, violent, nasty, uh, then we've got, uh, a trailer that we had no idea

545
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,320
what it was until the very end.

546
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,600
And it was revealed to be perfect dark.

547
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,960
So they have, oh yeah.

548
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,520
Yeah.

549
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,120
By the initiative, you know, and that rumor has been out for some time.

550
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,880
So it was kind of nice to see that confirmed.

551
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,120
Yeah.

552
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,240
So that was interesting.

553
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,080
Um, predictably master chief coming to Fortnite, they made that announcement.

554
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,920
Um, and then kind of some of the other bigger stuff that they had,

555
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,680
uh, well, the evil dead game.

556
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,120
That's kind of cool, which I totally thought was a dead by

557
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,000
daylight expansion or something.

558
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,920
Yeah, I thought it was as well.

559
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,240
And it's like, oh, that's not a diss.

560
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,920
Uh, that's when Alan's favorite games and I know tons of people are into it, but,

561
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,040
uh, yeah, it looks like, it looks like they're kind of taken maybe that, well,

562
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,920
I shouldn't say taking, cause we don't know how the game plays yet, but that,

563
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,320
uh, aesthetic, I guess for an evil dead game.

564
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,320
Yep.

565
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:44,360
Um, they had another trailer for fist, which was, uh, it looks like an action

566
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:50,400
game, starring a robot with a robotic fist, they fights with, um, they have

567
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,840
the new expansion tees for, uh, the yellow scrolls on line, which is gates of

568
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,520
oblivion, and then we've also got, uh, they made, they talk about the season

569
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,800
three of fall guys.

570
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,960
So it's going to be winter theme comes out on the 15th.

571
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,680
So later this week, yeah, a couple of days.

572
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,840
And then of course we talked about returnal.

573
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:16,080
That was very much like the, uh, you know, it almost looked way PT, but it wasn't.

574
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,120
Um, and then of course, uh, some of the bigger stuff.

575
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,200
So of course we knew that they were going to announce a new smash character.

576
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,400
So Sephiroth was announced as the new smash character and

577
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,320
immediately stabbed Mario.

578
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,880
So that was so dark, but I love that the stat stabbing Mario, but it turned out

579
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,160
once the light kind of went the other way, you saw that the sword was going

580
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,680
through the suspenders kind of like hooking him on it was very, it was very

581
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,960
like, like Disney dark humor was, it was, it was good.

582
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,800
What do you think of Sephiroth as a character being added?

583
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,720
I didn't, that was not one.

584
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,960
I saw a lot of people predicting that kind of came out of left

585
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,240
field, but it works.

586
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:56,800
It works.

587
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,600
It's fine.

588
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,960
It could have, I don't know, they could have picked a different series.

589
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,600
I'm sorry.

590
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,400
I'm just so happy.

591
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,440
It wasn't a Fortnite, bro.

592
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,120
I'm sorry.

593
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,720
I'm sorry, but I'm not sorry.

594
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,760
I just, this is kind of one of those.

595
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,960
Like I just, I feel like it's gonna happen.

596
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,080
I don't want to see it happen, but yeah.

597
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,800
Uh, was it, they, they showed off.

598
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,520
Is it okay if I rolled my eyes the entire time?

599
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,040
What, the Sephiroth bit?

600
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,080
Yeah.

601
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,680
I mean, my favorite thing though, was the person who did comparison shots for scenes

602
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,720
from Advent Children and the games.

603
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,240
That actually was really cool.

604
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,200
I mean, they recreated a lot of it and then Dan and I went and

605
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,080
watched Advent Children.

606
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,480
They did, there was one thing they recreated a shot where like he was about

607
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,120
to kill Aerith, but, uh, they use Zelda or something in the shot instead.

608
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,240
And the trailer, it was pretty, pretty, pretty cool how they did that.

609
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,800
It's like, damn, he's thinning out the cast already.

610
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,360
Um, was it, they had the new, uh, airship level showed off for among us and they

611
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,080
kind of showed the new tasks and gameplay with that, so that was kind of cool.

612
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,280
Uh, that'll be coming next year.

613
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,200
Uh, Super Meat Boy Forever, completely forgot about that game.

614
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,080
Yeah.

615
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,640
I thought that was supposed to be out a long time ago, but it

616
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,080
might've been 2020.

617
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,920
Uh, apparently, uh, games pass is going to be getting all of the Yakuza.

618
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:17,000
So, uh, Yakuza remastered collection three, four and five, and then Yakuza

619
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,240
six is going to be coming as well.

620
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:25,080
That's all next year, January 28th for the first three and March 25th for number

621
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,880
six, because we're still waiting for some of the final fantasy games they

622
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,400
announced last year, just saying, uh, Evil West, which, um, looked like a

623
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,760
very familiar PlayStation two game that I don't remember what it was called.

624
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,440
Not dark centers, but, um, yeah, they're very similar looking games.

625
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,520
So it's kind of a Western horror game, steampunk Western horror.

626
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,880
So that, that looked kind of neat.

627
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,280
Um, they've got unreal tournament stuff coming into Warframe.

628
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,400
So some different weapons and stuff for that.

629
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,320
And finally, um, there was a course, some teases from Bioware.

630
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:04,920
So they showed off a teaser trailer for dark or a dragon age four.

631
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,120
Uh, so a cinematic for that.

632
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:07,960
All right.

633
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,440
Uh, with a solace,

634
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,920
uh, you know, we got to talk about that dark soccer.

635
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,480
You're the Bioware fangirl.

636
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,840
What'd you think of the trailer?

637
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,440
All right.

638
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,080
I mean, it's pretty much what I expected it to be.

639
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,280
It didn't seem like anything too super new.

640
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,080
I mean, from the other stuff that they showed us.

641
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,240
Um, I didn't really expect anything more than just a couple of teases and everyone

642
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,920
who beat dragon Asian acquisition knew that solace was the bad guy.

643
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,360
So, yeah, I wasn't really super impressed.

644
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,800
I was happy to see something, but I've still got a while to go.

645
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,960
I liked the art style a lot now, I guess maybe because I haven't really been

646
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,960
digging up on, I didn't know that that was the direction they were going with it.

647
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,560
But I really liked that kind of like neon medieval look.

648
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,280
It's, it's, it's for, it seems like a different direction for me, like than the

649
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,520
other games, the way that kind of looked, I was maybe it's just because of my love.

650
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,400
It has to do with the setting of the game.

651
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,880
Cause I think it's supposed to be sent, set into vendor, which is like the wizard

652
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:05,880
big thing.

653
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:14,480
So, um, so, um, yeah, I, I think that has more to do with where it's located, but I

654
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,960
really do like the stylistic choices, but it also does fit the, the area.

655
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:20,800
Okay.

656
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,000
So I, I look forward to when we can see some gameplay.

657
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,600
Yeah.

658
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,240
Um, and then last but not least, of course, uh, there was a teaser trailer

659
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,120
for a new Mass Effect game that's going to be, I guess, set after three.

660
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,520
And that was very surprising considering they only really confirmed that they were

661
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,200
working on a new Mass Effect beyond the remaster, but when they announced the

662
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,040
remaster really not that long ago.

663
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,680
Um, and you know, you saw me kind of reacting live to that trailer where I was

664
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,640
like, is that Liara?

665
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,400
Is that Liara?

666
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,400
And it turns out, yes, it was Liara.

667
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,880
And that's one of the characters, if you're not aware from the original trilogy.

668
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:07,520
So to me, that trailer seemed to be confirming that this new game is in the

669
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,760
same universe, literally, because not as well, there's so much to dive into here,

670
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,040
but it is some sort of continuation, I suppose, or perhaps, um, it could be

671
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:24,040
prequel could be interlude, but it exists in the shepherd timeline is my point that

672
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:29,080
it's somewhere it seems to be in there somewhere, although there's been a lot of

673
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,560
lot of people tearing that trailer apart.

674
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:36,560
Some people seem to think that Liara looks very aged and that it could be some

675
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:41,080
sort of Liara trying to meet up with the Andromeda storyline, because keep in mind

676
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,240
the Andromeda storyline is 600 years ahead of the ship because of the time it takes

677
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,440
to travel between, uh, the Milky Way and Andromeda.

678
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:54,040
But, you know, they, they may try to patch that up with, but time travel, but

679
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,720
science.

680
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,480
So we'll see.

681
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:01,080
And, um, Liara's race, the Asari, they live for like a thousand years, so she could

682
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,920
still be alive over six.

683
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,520
Yeah, over.

684
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,600
So she could still be alive is my point 600 years later.

685
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,480
So there is, so there's a lot of theorizing over that 30 seconds that we saw.

686
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,960
Um, so I don't, I don't want to go too far down that rabbit hole, but it certainly

687
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,880
was exciting to at least know that, okay, this is going to tie into the characters

688
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:26,640
in the first game, unlike Andromeda, which, you know, there's, there's things I like

689
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,080
about Andromeda, there's things I don't like about Andromeda, but it exists on its

690
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,400
own.

691
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,640
You know, it doesn't it like the shepherd and the callbacks to the original trilogy

692
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:40,360
are really just like cameos, but this is really something that shows, okay, y'all

693
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,080
wanted something in the trilogy, you know, so, and then of course it leads to the

694
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:48,040
controversy of, are they going to canonize one of the endings of three?

695
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,520
I don't think it's a big deal if they do, but other people are really, really

696
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,960
passionate on this topic and disagree that they shouldn't be canonizing one of the

697
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,960
endings, but we'll see, they might find a way around it.

698
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:05,520
Um, uh, Lyla36 in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network says, love

699
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,480
Mass Effect, hopefully it's good.

700
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,000
Uh, yeah, big same.

701
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,760
And my assumption is that, you know, part of the surprise about seeing that teaser

702
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,640
at the Game Awards was I was like, they still haven't given us a date for Dragon

703
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:18,840
Age.

704
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:22,120
Like this Mass Effect game is years out.

705
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:28,200
I'm talking, I would be shocked if this game is out any earlier than 2023.

706
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,240
I'm serious.

707
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,520
I think it's that far out.

708
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,160
It's gotta be, you know, think about how long Andromeda took and all the

709
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,000
announces we got over the years with that.

710
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,040
We may get a few more teases in that remaster.

711
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,280
I think that's what people want to know now is that like, if I go and I beat all

712
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,920
three games in that remaster, am I going to get like a Kingdom Hearts esque kind of

713
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,360
bonus scene that's going to tie into something new?

714
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,600
And I think a lot of people would lose their shit.

715
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,920
Um, but we'll see a lot to be determined.

716
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,760
That's for sure.

717
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:03,040
So, um, Phoenix 7726 in chat says, wait, Rob, why would they shoot an ending out

718
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,720
of a cannon?

719
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,440
I would hope you all know what I meant.

720
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,080
Um, but that means that obviously you make a big choice at the end of Mass Effect

721
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,080
three on how do you want this story to end?

722
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,600
And, uh, they may end up saying this is the definitive ending.

723
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:22,920
Now, I would kind of argue that Mass Effect two, you could beat Mass Effect

724
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:28,920
two and kill Shepard spoiler alert for a 10 year old game plus 10 plus, but you

725
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,480
could beat Mass Effect two and end up not having Shepard live.

726
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,480
And, uh, uh, in that ending, I believe Joker takes over the narration and some

727
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,160
of the, um, follow up and tying up the loose ends.

728
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,280
So in your, uh, Canon ending of Mass Effect two, Joker might've been the last

729
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:51,000
person standing, but that didn't stop them from saying, nah, but that's like,

730
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,640
it's, um, the endings of clue, but how about this?

731
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,560
That's, that's one way it could have happened.

732
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,880
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

733
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,440
That's exactly how they should start Mass Effect three or sorry, Mass Effect, the

734
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,960
new one, they should start Mass Effect, the new one by recapping the three

735
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,080
endings, uh, clue the movie style.

736
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,160
Absolutely.

737
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:12,920
All right.

738
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:13,560
Anyway.

739
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,240
Um, anything else that they announced Loki that we missed?

740
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,240
No, that'd be, that's pretty much it.

741
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,880
Uh, there are some other advertisements, uh, Facebook did a lot of this, like kind

742
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,440
of trying to build Goodwill around, you know, diverse streamers and stuff, but

743
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,200
then like the kind of the reaction with all those, it's like, yeah, that's a

744
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:31,880
really good video.

745
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,760
Oh, Facebook.

746
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:33,720
Yeah.

747
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,840
So yeah, that's the only downside of that.

748
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,200
It's like, yeah, thanks that you pointed it out, but nah, not going on your

749
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,720
platform yet.

750
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,520
That was, that was, you know what, it's one of those things where it's like, I

751
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,160
will give a, I will give a singular clap to Facebook gaming.

752
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:56,040
I will get, I will give one clap to Facebook gaming because I thought that

753
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,400
was very nice that they spent their money on what they did with those ads.

754
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,120
Because, you know, when they started, I was like, oh, I love when the game

755
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,400
awards highlight stuff like this.

756
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,440
This is really cool.

757
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,720
And it's, it's great to see, you know, uh, all sorts of people that are really

758
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,920
enthusiastic about gaming.

759
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,440
And then it comes up with that Facebook gaming logo and you're like, I feel like

760
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,600
I just got just bait and switched.

761
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,320
Um, but I will give them the one clap, uh, polite applause for, for paying for

762
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:21,840
those spots.

763
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,800
Cause it was nice to see.

764
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,360
So, all right.

765
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:31,160
Um, otherwise those paid spots sure blend in with the awards a little too well.

766
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:31,680
Don't they?

767
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,400
Yes.

768
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,560
I liked how, uh, Devolver used theirs.

769
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,600
That was funny to do their own award show within the award show.

770
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,280
That was funny.

771
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:40,520
Yeah.

772
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,840
That was a very Devolver thing.

773
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,120
Yeah.

774
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,240
All right.

775
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,520
Let's talk about some other things we've done this week besides watching big award

776
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,760
shows and talking about our gaming weeks.

777
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,960
How was your gaming week?

778
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,960
And we'll start with dark Sakura.

779
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,360
It would help if I had muted myself.

780
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,440
Um, it was, it was animal crossing.

781
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,000
I mean, animal crossing and writing fan fiction.

782
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,040
Fun.

783
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,520
So, yeah.

784
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:10,600
Um, I, in two weeks I have penned 19 chapters of my fanfic.

785
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,160
Oh, wow.

786
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,280
I'm on my 20th, 18 of them have been posted.

787
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:19,880
So it's supernatural, but if anyone wants to read my writing, um, it is, I'm

788
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,680
actually doing this in part, um, to deal with, I guess kind of how I feel about

789
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,600
the series, but I'm also hashing out some ideas that are going to go into my novel.

790
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:35,200
So if anyone wants a, a sort of a influential sneak peek on that, let me

791
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,360
know, I will give you a link.

792
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,480
Cool.

793
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,080
But other than that, yeah, it's been lots of, uh, lots of animal crossing

794
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:45,720
and, uh, um, and, and a little bit of pinball, a little bit of pinball.

795
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,360
Oh, fun.

796
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,280
And I'm still considering getting a ring fit.

797
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,160
I'm thinking about it.

798
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,840
I just don't know if I want to dedicate to it when I've been focusing so much on

799
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,760
weight training instead of the cardio stuff.

800
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,720
So we'll see.

801
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,560
I need to come ding dong ditch you, um, the things so you can try it.

802
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,520
Although there is a part of me that really should pick it back up because

803
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,360
I haven't been getting great exercise throughout this whole thing.

804
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,920
But, um, you know, been trying to, well, yeah, yeah, I've been trying my best to

805
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,800
walking, although there was a few days this week where it didn't happen just due

806
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:22,640
to it was raining or, you know, too much going, like I had to work and then we

807
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,840
went right into the game awards from work.

808
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,320
And by the time that's over, it's like seven, eight o'clock at

809
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,560
night is too dark to go walk.

810
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,440
And that's the biggest bummer is that it gets dark too damn early now.

811
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,680
It really kind of.

812
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,640
Sucks on the walking front, but Oh, well, you ever considered

813
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,680
doing what Alan's doing?

814
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,600
Um, yes, I considered it.

815
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,800
And then I said, no, uh, when, when Jim, I said I wasn't going to do

816
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,000
it because of my back problems.

817
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:50,320
When gyms are safe again, I will absolutely cause my work has a nice

818
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,040
little deal with you.

819
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,320
I will absolutely be taking advantage of that.

820
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,160
So that, but that's just going to have to be a 2021 thing.

821
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,200
And as we all know, we, we got to wait for that vaccine to travel.

822
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,000
So my work has a gym, but I've been buying weight equipment to keep it home.

823
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,800
You know, I'm actually borrowing some pretty heavy, uh, free, uh, dumbbells

824
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,800
and I bought a kettlebell and RAR.

825
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:11,920
Nice.

826
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,080
I was being really good about the gym about, you know, it was last year, but

827
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,600
then everything just started happening where I changed jobs and like everything

828
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,040
happened at once, I kind of fell out of the habit and I needed to get back into it.

829
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,400
Anyway.

830
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:22,720
All right.

831
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,360
Get you some resistance bands.

832
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:24,640
Yeah.

833
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,640
Well, that's what ring fit basically is really.

834
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,760
So, all right.

835
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,920
Kind of anyway.

836
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,520
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

837
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:35,120
I mean, well, obviously you kind of got into it earlier, but I want to know about

838
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,920
cyberpunk cause I'm, I'm pretty sure dark soccer didn't check it out and I didn't

839
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,400
check it out.

840
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,880
So I got to know your thoughts.

841
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:46,640
So, yeah, I played, uh, quite a bit of cyberpunk now, so, um, I like it.

842
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,560
I really enjoyed it.

843
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,200
It's a very immersive game.

844
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:53,880
Um, and I'm, yeah, I'm thoroughly enjoying it.

845
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,840
The storyline's really good and I'm just kind of working through that.

846
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,120
Been trying to do a lot of side quests, but it has like the, the problem that

847
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:09,000
like, um, Skyrim had where as you are, like you pick a side quest to do it and

848
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,080
you'll get another quest kind of in the middle and then it'll jump to that one.

849
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,920
It'll get, it kept changing my markers, which was kind of annoying.

850
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,280
Um, so Bobby wants to know what system you're doing cyberpunk on a PC.

851
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:21,680
Okay.

852
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,040
I'm not crazy enough getting a console yet.

853
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,040
Um, no, actually I do want to get it on the Xbox series X at some point, but that

854
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,080
doesn't come out until March.

855
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:33,160
And from what I hear the console version's a little bit rough, but yeah, I've been

856
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:39,200
playing on PC, uh, cause I've got a, uh, GTS or I have an RTX, uh, 2070 in my

857
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,440
laptop so I can run, um, you know, some of the Ray Tracy on there.

858
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:49,240
I think I've been playing a Ray Tracy medium, which is like the ultra, but you

859
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:53,360
know, kind of a little bit, uh, not super crazy in Ray tracing.

860
00:42:53,360 --> 00:43:00,640
And then I dropped the screen resolution down from 4k to 1440 and I, I mean,

861
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,320
1440 or 1080, I can't remember.

862
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:10,720
And then also I've been using their, um, DLSS to, uh, up the quality and

863
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,080
get some more frames out of it.

864
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,920
But yeah, it's been running really smooth.

865
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:20,960
Um, there are bugs, there, there are, there are some weird bugs in the game.

866
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,360
Um, nothing really super game breaking so far.

867
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,280
I've had it crash.

868
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,640
I mean, a few times is the, is the whole penis clipping outside of the jeans thing.

869
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,440
Is that a bug or a feature?

870
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,200
That's, that's the hard question.

871
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,040
That's the hard question I'm asking here.

872
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,680
I know a lot of features are in the eye of the bug holder.

873
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,240
Maybe one where it, it, he's holding something.

874
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:49,720
I had, I, so I had, um, an issue where my character goes, so it's a,

875
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,480
it's a game about hacking, right?

876
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,400
So what am I going to do to the game?

877
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:57,840
Of course, I'm going to hack it to try and cheat because that's what I do.

878
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,760
Um, so Eddie Guerrero said you cheat to win.

879
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,800
So I've been messing around with like, you know, uh, cheat editors and

880
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,040
stuff like that to tweak it how I want.

881
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,000
But anyways, so I maxed out, um, some armor on some clothes I had.

882
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,440
Um, some armor on some clothes I had, like your initial starting clothes.

883
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,040
You can do that.

884
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:21,520
And what happened was is on a reload, like they would refuse to appear.

885
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:26,160
So like I put the pants and the shirt and stuff on and it would just be invisible.

886
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,120
Um, but it would turn my character into a Ken doll, basically, you know, it just

887
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,200
remove all the genitalia whatsoever.

888
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:38,320
Um, but then I ended up, I had to wear like a different pair of clothing.

889
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,480
It finally worked and I was able to level that one up.

890
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,080
And then I put a jacket on and everything kind of appeared again, but

891
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:50,320
I've had other bugs where, um, objects will just like, like my, uh, sidekick.

892
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,520
He was walking through a room and his guns just got stuck in the

893
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,760
middle of the air for some reason.

894
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,640
And so that was weird.

895
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,920
And then there's another one where he had a briefcase and he was holding it

896
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,520
and it also got stuck somewhere.

897
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,720
It just disappeared.

898
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,880
Um, I feel like, okay.

899
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,800
I feel like knowing you low key though, this kind of stuff is almost like a

900
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,120
feature because like, uh, you know, a lot of games are really buggy when they first

901
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,880
came out, like Bethesda games are legendary for this shit, which are three.

902
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,000
I seem to recall was pretty buggy when it came out in the beginning too.

903
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,160
Um, but you love this buggy stuff.

904
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,600
Like driver three was like, you know, a game you played a lot of.

905
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,440
Because of the stupid bugs that were in the game, you know?

906
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,360
So, so it's one of those, he's like, are the, are the, are the bugs really

907
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,200
detracting or are they a feature?

908
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,960
No, it's, it's not really bothering me at all.

909
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:44,440
There's like, um, if it starts like interfering to the quests and stuff, like

910
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:48,520
I can't do certain things, like there's some, the, like where they wanted me to

911
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,000
go somewhere and do something.

912
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,720
And it was kind of, I couldn't figure out what it was that they wanted me to do.

913
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,840
So that was kind of annoying.

914
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,520
Some of the way markers that they put in there are confusing as well, because it.

915
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,600
There was one where they wanted me to steal a van and drive it somewhere.

916
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:07,000
So I, I stole it and I drove through the marker, but what they really wanted me

917
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,160
to do was go past the marker into this, like, uh, warehouse type thing.

918
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,320
And then a new marker would appear, which didn't make any sense.

919
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,640
They should just have the final destination as the marker.

920
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,840
Because I tried to park on the marker instead and I'm like, okay, well,

921
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,320
I'm on this marker, I don't know what it wants me to do.

922
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,600
It's not disappearing.

923
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,000
It's not seeing them getting anywhere.

924
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,600
So I kind of figured I'm like, Oh, they probably want me to drive into this,

925
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,360
like, um, you know, fenced off area.

926
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,440
So, okay, I'll do that.

927
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:40,200
So I was sure I drove past it and then it finally let, you know, it put

928
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,960
the next marker up and stuff, but it was just a little weird.

929
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,080
It was a little awkward.

930
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,360
Um, I'm trying to think if there's like, I know there was something I saw

931
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,080
that I, I was like, well, that's weird.

932
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,280
Um, Oh yeah.

933
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:59,560
Well, I don't want to spoil it, but, um, one there's, there's a main

934
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,520
character that dies in the game.

935
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,280
At some point.

936
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:10,880
And so he, you, you take what he dies when you're with him in a car.

937
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:17,480
And then, so I got done with this other portion of the game or I

938
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,240
reloaded a save or something.

939
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:24,760
And his corpse was like bouncing on top of the car.

940
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,280
Like it was clipping through the car and it was just like, he's bouncing.

941
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,920
He was bouncing on the, on the roof of the car.

942
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,040
And I'm like, I don't think that's supposed to be doing that.

943
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,520
The wonderful thing about corpses is corpses are wonderful things.

944
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,600
So that was kind of funny.

945
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,160
Um, what other stuff do they have?

946
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,120
It's kind of funny in there.

947
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,840
So, um, I don't know.

948
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:55,960
I mean, like it's a, just like the whole city is so packed full of detail, but

949
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:00,360
because it's like a sprawling metropolis, that's like futuristic, all the roads,

950
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,880
like twist around, so like I may have a way point, that's just like a little

951
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,920
bit away on my map, but I got to drive way the other side of town and then

952
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,600
make a U-turn and come back to hit the road, be able to get up to that spot.

953
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:16,400
But I mean, minor gripes aside though, it's just, it's such a gorgeous game.

954
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,680
Like it really is.

955
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,440
I get it.

956
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,480
And you know, the, the console versions right now are a little bit rough, but

957
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,440
like, Oh man, on PC, it looks so gorgeous.

958
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,400
So I am really enjoying it despite the bugs.

959
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,280
Um, well, we'll talk more about some of those internet reactions and just a

960
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,640
little bit here when we finish our gaming weeks, but, um, yeah.

961
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,040
Yeah.

962
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,440
Anything else to share with your gaming week?

963
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:39,920
Oh yeah, yeah, sorry.

964
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,600
Um, so a few other things I did play some more Minecraft.

965
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,200
Um, so there'll be something we'll be talking about a little bit later about

966
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,560
Minecraft that, um, I got to check out this week.

967
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:56,040
I also, so my son was building a castle and so that led me to go want to check

968
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,760
out the old bog Minecraft server.

969
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,040
So I had downloaded a copy of that.

970
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,680
Like I kept backups of it.

971
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,120
Sure.

972
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,400
So from the Java version, I tried to reload it.

973
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:12,320
It's I mean, it's from like one 1.08 and we have like, I think we're up to one 16

974
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:19,760
now and I tried loading it in that new Java version and they loads, but

975
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,840
everything is broken, like all of the redstone and stuff's broken.

976
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,000
And also like it wouldn't load in further chunks out of,

977
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,800
outside the initial area.

978
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,680
So I don't know if I did, I'm sure I did something wrong importing it.

979
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,240
Cause the save files aren't even the same format anymore.

980
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:38,000
Um, so, but I at least got the show, I'm kind of some of the stuff that, you

981
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,600
know, everybody created and everything.

982
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,320
So that's cool.

983
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:45,400
Um, and then what else I do, um, more Orna.

984
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,480
I did play some of that.

985
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:51,080
Um, I talked a little bit about it last week, how I was trying to get, um,

986
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,360
the emulators onto my Xbox series X.

987
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,760
So I was able to get the developer of that to whitelist my account.

988
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,880
So I did get them downloaded the retail versions of those.

989
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:06,960
So now I can actually run emulators on, um, my Xbox series X without having to go

990
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,120
into developer mode, which is kind of cool.

991
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,920
Um, so I helped to play around with that at some point, but I haven't got a chance

992
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:17,600
to, but I'm very excited about that because I can put even like Wii games

993
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,360
on there and stuff, uh, GameCube games around on it.

994
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,280
I mean, it's going to be pretty crazy.

995
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,440
Um, so we'll play with that a little bit later, but, and then, like I said,

996
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,400
I did work a little bit on my game, but not a ton, I will probably work on it

997
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,480
more this week though, because I do want to, uh, put some more progress in it.

998
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,960
We, I, we were discussing the new level ideas.

999
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:39,520
So one of the things that did come up was a cyber poop 2077.

1000
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,640
We have to do like a cyberpunk level or something.

1001
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,720
I appreciate that very much.

1002
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,280
Um, so, so we may have to do that.

1003
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,440
Um, so that might be something that's coming.

1004
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,280
All right.

1005
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,440
Nice little tease there.

1006
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,200
Uh, I like that.

1007
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:57,280
Are you going to emulate your game on an Xbox series X?

1008
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,800
Um, if it'll run.

1009
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,040
So like I had, it depends on what I ended up doing.

1010
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:07,240
So if I don't do animated tiles, which, uh, and I don't do any sort of like.

1011
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:08,840
Data saving.

1012
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,960
So I don't have like a high score table that saves.

1013
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,600
I can change it from a mapper 30 to a mapper two, which is more

1014
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,560
compatible with emulators.

1015
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:21,680
A mapper 30 is really only pop or compatible with a few different types

1016
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,560
of emulators because it's relatively new.

1017
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,760
So like probably messin or FC UX, I think.

1018
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,560
Um, I don't know.

1019
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,240
I had to check and see what, what it'll work with, but there there's

1020
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,800
way this, the converted, if I don't use certain features, I can't wait

1021
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,280
to steal your game and emulate it.

1022
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,320
Well, I mean, it's emulating right now, so you can definitely do it with messin.

1023
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:47,240
I mean, that's what's what's showing on screen, but, um, but yeah.

1024
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:47,880
Eventually.

1025
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,480
All right.

1026
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:49,000
All right.

1027
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,640
Eventually someday we'll find my cart on one of those Chinese bootleg things.

1028
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:54,840
I'll see you in the video.

1029
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,800
One example, what's this pixel poops game.

1030
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,880
This is weird, stupid.

1031
00:51:59,240 --> 00:51:59,640
All right.

1032
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:04,640
So some Joe Schmoe YouTube video going the 10 stupidest NES games ever made.

1033
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,360
All right.

1034
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,480
Uh, anyway, uh, my gaming week.

1035
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,240
So, um, I've been playing a variety of stuff continuing on dragon quest 11,

1036
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,520
uh, definitive edition on Xbox series X.

1037
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,680
I was talking about that last week.

1038
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,320
I'm definitely way past the point I was on PlayStation four.

1039
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,840
I'm just about to the 20 hour mark in the game.

1040
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,800
Um, I just, um, how do I say this spoiler free?

1041
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:31,120
I just fought a giant spider as a boss in a cave that was underground, a city that

1042
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:35,040
had, so I'll just say that to keep it very vague, that is where I'm at in the game.

1043
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,560
So I feel like I'm a decent chunk of the game into it.

1044
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,920
Um, and, uh, I went back cause I was finding some of those little, um, what

1045
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:47,440
are the little toggles I think they're called, I forget their name, but that

1046
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,160
opens up the whole thing that was in the 3DS version of the game, the ticker tin.

1047
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:54,200
I'm probably missing up the name, but I went back and did some of that too.

1048
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,360
Cause that was kind of interesting.

1049
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,840
And it's, I didn't realize that they all kind of played into each other.

1050
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,760
Like you might have to get an item for one, like for dragon quest threes,

1051
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,400
little flashback from dragon quest nine flashbacks.

1052
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,520
I thought that was kind of interesting.

1053
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:11,960
So, um, yeah, that was, uh, my experience with dragon quest 11.

1054
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:12,720
Still been playing that.

1055
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,560
Um, continuing on with, you know, Pokemon go the usual, I got 15

1056
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,880
Chinese over the weekend cause they had the big community day.

1057
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,960
Kind of best of was this weekend.

1058
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,360
And so I played a lot yesterday.

1059
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,240
I was only able to play for a little bit today, but I did some

1060
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,840
driving around and Bluetooth catching.

1061
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,360
I did all Bluetooth catching and that went pretty well.

1062
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,080
Um, and then other games, one other game that I checked out this week, that's,

1063
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,840
uh, for me is a little bit newer.

1064
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,920
Uh, last week we were talking about that the game destiny two was going to be

1065
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,480
getting its Xbox series S and X upgrade.

1066
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,360
Week.

1067
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,480
And I believe it got its PlayStation five upgrade as well.

1068
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,480
And so I, uh, went in and I downloaded it.

1069
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,720
Um, after the, you know, a patch came out for next gen and I was

1070
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,280
checking it out a little bit, you know, and I haven't played it in a while.

1071
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,640
I played it briefly when stadia had it.

1072
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,840
Uh, well, it still has it, but when I had stadia, which was when, you know,

1073
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,280
when Bobby gave me that pass really early on was probably the last time I played

1074
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,520
maybe like 20 minutes of, of destiny two.

1075
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,360
Um, but the last time I really, really played it was like when it first came out.

1076
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:15,840
So it's interesting to me to see all the changes, because one thing I did notice

1077
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,640
right away was that kind of the whole opening of the game is, is different than

1078
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,920
what it used to be.

1079
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:26,640
I, I think it was, they used a map that they were still using about two years

1080
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,040
ago, but they do it differently so that you don't just go right to the big city.

1081
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:36,000
That was something I noticed was that in the original, you kind of went right to

1082
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,840
the big city and you're almost overwhelmed with things to do in this one.

1083
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:44,160
You kind of stick to that first little map and you start to learn more about

1084
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,160
like doing quests and bounties and things within that map.

1085
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,480
And I thought it was interesting.

1086
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:56,240
And, um, honestly, the, uh, other, uh, uh, thing with destiny on Xbox series X.

1087
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,320
It's gorgeous.

1088
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,800
It's really, really good looking, uh, and smooth.

1089
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,520
And I know that I'm terrible at first person shooters, but I

1090
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,280
know that's important.

1091
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,280
Um, I w I'm very pleased.

1092
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:11,800
I sometimes see just the tiniest bit of texture pop in, but like I have to be on a

1093
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:16,680
vehicle and I have to be kind of looking for it, uh, in order to, to see that.

1094
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,480
Otherwise I think the game runs really smooth and it's, uh, you know, again,

1095
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,120
considering it's all on game pass.

1096
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,240
Um, well, I think the game is a free to play thing anyway, at this point.

1097
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,480
Um, so you can get most of it for free.

1098
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,800
I know that beyond light expansion, I think is where they're trying to charge

1099
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,560
people right now.

1100
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,200
Um, and I don't think that one is free on game pass.

1101
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,480
I think everything else is, um, but you know, that's still, it's still a good

1102
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,720
chunk of stuff to experience and, um, yeah, I'm, I'm into it.

1103
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:42,720
I think it's pretty neat.

1104
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:47,680
So, um, Questbuster in chat says I should reload destiny two to see

1105
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,080
what's changed one of these days.

1106
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,440
Well, apparently they got rid of a bunch of maps.

1107
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:55,360
Um, so that's interesting in and of itself as well, or they archive them,

1108
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,480
they sent them to the vault.

1109
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,720
Um, so maybe they'll come back, uh, for special events or something later.

1110
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,120
So, all right.

1111
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,440
So yeah, that was my gaming week.

1112
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,040
I played a surprising amount of destiny too.

1113
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,480
Amongst my dragon quest 11.

1114
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,120
Oh yeah.

1115
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,160
Final Fantasy 14 got the big story patch.

1116
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,840
So I was playing that as well, but that's a given.

1117
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,880
When haven't I talked about that game in a week?

1118
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,600
I play that game way too much.

1119
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:16,200
All right.

1120
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:21,720
Oh, black compat is correcting me in chat saying beyond light is on game pass two.

1121
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,160
I did not realize that.

1122
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,880
I thought that was something extra you had to buy.

1123
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:25,880
I stand corrected.

1124
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,680
That's part of why we have a live chat.

1125
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:31,240
So that's kind of neat that you get the newest expansion through game pass.

1126
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:31,720
Huh?

1127
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,360
Obviously I haven't gotten that far in the game yet.

1128
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:38,000
Uh, to where I know, cause I think now you don't just have light, you have dark.

1129
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:41,120
I think that's the big twist, but I don't, I'm not far enough.

1130
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,720
I've, I'm still like basically in the tutorial for God's sake.

1131
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:50,280
Um, I've done some things like I, I was, I've gone to like three

1132
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,720
different areas on that map.

1133
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,600
So I think I've almost explored that whole map by now.

1134
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,600
So yeah.

1135
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:59,000
Uh, quest buster in chat says the new classes are so fun.

1136
00:56:59,000 --> 00:56:59,640
I've heard.

1137
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,720
Um, I mained a warlock, which is what I'm playing too.

1138
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,920
So the stasis class was added for those and I'm curious to see what it's

1139
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,720
like, but it's not a free edition.

1140
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,120
Well, it sounds like they might have some, uh, stuff on game pass.

1141
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:15,800
They're worth checking out if you're an Xbox person, um, or a PC person.

1142
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,800
I don't remember if that whole thing is on PC as well, but yeah, it's,

1143
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,400
it runs great on, on series X.

1144
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:22,240
All right.

1145
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,280
That's it for my gaming week.

1146
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:26,960
Let's get into some gaming news and for the gaming news this week, we

1147
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,080
have to go right back to cyberpunk because it's what lots of people

1148
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,000
are talking about, right?

1149
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,280
Yep.

1150
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,840
It's what, what everyone's talking about.

1151
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,480
Well, no, it's not just that it's, it's a little bit buggy.

1152
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,120
Um, or a lot buggy.

1153
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,240
It's also that it's breaking records.

1154
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:49,560
So it's, uh, breaking the steam records with over 1 million concurrent

1155
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,120
players, um, during launch week.

1156
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:58,600
So peeking out at 1 million, 300 thousand, 264 players.

1157
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:05,960
And, uh, previously, apparently the record was, um, held by fallout

1158
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:10,080
four, which was 472,962.

1159
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:10,680
Wow.

1160
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,520
That's quite a difference.

1161
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,000
Quite a difference.

1162
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:14,360
Yeah.

1163
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,240
And I want to say sales wise too.

1164
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,680
It's, it's doing really well.

1165
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:23,400
Um, and I want to say I prior to that, the record was actually, I think the

1166
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:28,160
last, um, work world of Warcraft expansion, that Warcraft expansion

1167
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,680
had the record for like a week and then cyberpunk came in and took it.

1168
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,120
And so that kind of begs the question, how much of this is the pandemic

1169
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:39,320
coming into play and people that are, you know, listening when the folks

1170
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:42,280
say stay at home and so they're staying at home playing video games.

1171
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:46,360
And I think, I think as far as like the steam concurrent players thing, I

1172
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,640
think the pandemic plays into that a lot.

1173
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,560
And that's not to knock the game success.

1174
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,840
Uh, again, I haven't played it.

1175
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:57,360
I have no opinion, but, um, I, I think that part of it certainly

1176
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:01,080
helps, you know, especially when you look at the, the, such that you

1177
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,760
had 470,000 was the old record.

1178
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,160
And now it's a million.

1179
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,680
That's a huge difference.

1180
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,360
And I think the pandemic plays into that a bit.

1181
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,440
And of course the hype for cyber, it probably would have shattered

1182
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,880
the record anyway, but to shatter it that much, I guess that's my real

1183
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,840
point to shatter it that much is certainly part of the pandemic.

1184
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,040
Well, and I'm curious as though what the launch stuff is.

1185
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,960
Cause I, I want to say probably all games across the board and

1186
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,160
steam are probably much higher than they were, you know, at launch before.

1187
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:30,040
I don't know if this is necessarily like launch week stuff, or if it's just

1188
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,440
in total, like this is the highest peak.

1189
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:36,120
Cause I got to imagine like among us right now is probably pretty high as well.

1190
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:36,560
Sure.

1191
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:40,240
Um, I'd be curious to see if like that, if they're talking about like

1192
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,240
launch week, the numbers on that.

1193
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:47,320
Um, so kind of along with that, you know, one thing that's been an

1194
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:52,200
industry trend is basing a lot of their, uh, developer bonuses off of

1195
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:57,080
Metacritic scores and being that it's been kind of, you know, rough

1196
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:00,920
around the edges coming out, you know, that could obviously impact scores.

1197
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:07,120
Well, apparently, uh, CJ product red, um, exclusive or executives have said

1198
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:14,400
that, um, they take full, um, responsibility for the, uh, complexity of

1199
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,120
the game or the, uh, you know, the shortcomings basically, and saying

1200
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:21,760
that developers are going to be getting, you know, their full bonus.

1201
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:26,320
No matter how it reviews, uh, which is really what they should

1202
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,600
be doing in the first place.

1203
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:33,760
Um, also we talked about last week, how there was some issues with epilepsy.

1204
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:40,720
Um, you know, no warnings that whatsoever in the game, um, but now

1205
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,200
they do have a warning that comes up in the beginning of the game.

1206
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:48,640
And it says the effect has also been smooth out and the flashes, um,

1207
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,480
reduced in frequency and magnitude.

1208
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,680
I didn't notice any flashing in the game.

1209
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,920
Um, I'm assuming maybe because they patched this stuff out, but, uh, yeah,

1210
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:01,880
they patched it out like two days ago, I think, and the original really hurting

1211
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,560
people, yeah, Bob, Bobby goes into detail somewhat on his show.

1212
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:09,040
He does not have the condition that causes seizures, but he has a

1213
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,400
different neurological condition and he talks about on his show.

1214
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:14,920
So a cheap plug for Bobby Blackwell show, but he kind of talked about how

1215
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:19,080
he was watching a Twitch play through and had to basically go lie down for

1216
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,760
a little bit because that sequence came up, uh, on the launch day or the

1217
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:26,360
day after and it kinda, you know, it's, it's, it's set off that whole,

1218
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,680
uh, chain of events there.

1219
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,400
So, um, yeah, that was a real kinda.

1220
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:35,320
How in the heck did you manage to do something so stupid, but at least they

1221
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:40,600
patched it out and they were the gal who reported it on Twitter and her

1222
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,160
tweet got all the traction she didn't.

1223
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,800
She kind of like, I don't want to say she helped them, but basically she

1224
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:51,920
kind of like, she gave her seal of they fixed it, like she gave her yay.

1225
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:52,720
I'm so happy.

1226
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,800
My feedback, uh, helped to fix this whole thing, right?

1227
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:56,080
Yeah.

1228
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,760
Well, there's actually one of the journalists that was, thank you.

1229
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,920
Bobby says she did help them.

1230
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,600
I suffered a seizure from it.

1231
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,720
So, um, yeah, it's good that they fixed that.

1232
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:08,360
And some other stuff they also fixed as well, because they didn't patch you

1233
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,760
in our regular basis, they're already up to a 1.04.

1234
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,920
So they've done a few patches since launch.

1235
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:20,360
Um, they also added that additional, uh, song that was causing DMCA strikes.

1236
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:26,080
By the way, uh, a side note here, um, during the game awards, lots of DM,

1237
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,560
lots of, uh, copyrighted music.

1238
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:33,520
Still haven't heard anything about people getting DMCA strikes from the game awards,

1239
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,920
especially doing co-streaming, but I'd be curious to see what happens

1240
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:40,680
to later with that, uh, quite live question for, okay.

1241
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,520
Bobby says we haven't got struck yet from the co-stream.

1242
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:45,480
I know that cause I would have seen that email too, but did, did we

1243
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:49,800
archive our Thursday stream because part of me was wondering if maybe we

1244
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:54,800
hesitated doing that because I'm the slowest person in the world at archiving

1245
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,120
a well are I'd lose episodes.

1246
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:59,360
If Bobby wasn't poking me on Sunday saying, don't forget, save

1247
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,360
the archive, you're going to lose it.

1248
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:01,240
I did.

1249
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:06,720
We not archive Thursday's thing because that might actually be because I don't

1250
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,320
think a lot of clips were made.

1251
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:11,680
So we may not get DMCA'd if it wasn't our, okay.

1252
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,520
Bobby says it's there.

1253
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:16,240
And then, so we'll find out Bobby was seeing with the, uh, calibrating

1254
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,280
their brain dance machines.

1255
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,960
So yeah, they, they take out, they've taken out the flashing lights.

1256
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,440
It's definitely, you know, here's a light on here.

1257
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:25,680
Here's a light on here.

1258
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,640
And then they both go on and fades the white.

1259
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,720
Um, not really.

1260
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,680
It's not flashing so that that's good.

1261
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,960
Um, so that's been taken out of the game.

1262
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:41,800
Um, and of course, you know, some other fun, uh, glitches

1263
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,360
that people are running into.

1264
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:49,560
So there is a glitch right now where, um, Apparently people's genitals in the

1265
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,480
game are popping through their pants.

1266
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:54,400
It's clipping through their clothing, which is kind of weird.

1267
01:03:54,520 --> 01:04:00,360
Um, weird or fun, whatever the case may be.

1268
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,040
I was like, it's Eric Andre mode.

1269
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:09,600
Um, so I've seen the pictures from Dory alley that, that, that does happen.

1270
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:16,280
And it's not, it's not just, um, the males having that problem too.

1271
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:22,280
Uh, apparently women are also having some of their body parts, uh, as well.

1272
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,000
So, you know, it's, it's fun.

1273
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:28,120
Um, I can't believe you made a Doria Ali reference.

1274
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:32,760
I think that's the first, how long, how long?

1275
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,520
I don't know if anyone else though.

1276
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,800
I don't know if people in other parts of the country know what Doria Ali is.

1277
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:43,560
It's, it's a, it's, it's a festival in San Francisco, and that's probably

1278
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:47,120
all I need to say about it in regards to that joke for people to get it.

1279
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:47,560
Yes.

1280
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:55,560
Um, also apparently I know Sony is issuing refunds for cyberpunk if people

1281
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:59,520
are requesting them because of the issues they've been having with the

1282
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:03,160
game on like PlayStation four, especially how it looks.

1283
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:07,760
So that may be something, if folks are interested, honestly, I would say,

1284
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:14,000
especially if you have a PlayStation five or Xbox series X best, if you, if

1285
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,840
you can just wait until, um, it comes out, you know, specifically for those

1286
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:24,640
versions in March, otherwise, I mean, I think it looks okay.

1287
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,120
I haven't played it on console yet.

1288
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:29,440
I was planning on getting on my Xbox at some point, probably not a huge

1289
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,880
hurry because I have it on PC.

1290
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,840
But at some point I probably will get it on there as well.

1291
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:39,920
Um, but definitely if you can do it on PC, that's probably the platform

1292
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:44,160
you want to be on because there's a lot of flexibility with game performance

1293
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:48,240
on there, so you can kind of, you can really tweak that to however you want.

1294
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,640
Um, I'm taking the Allen approach to this whole thing.

1295
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:55,360
And, and my, my husband, when it comes to things like cyberpunk is very like,

1296
01:05:55,680 --> 01:06:00,600
you know, I will play it in two years after the game of the year edition is

1297
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:05,520
out after all the mods are out and after, you know, everything is like, it's done.

1298
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,640
It's a 100%.

1299
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,480
They're not doing anything else for the game and the modding communities on fire.

1300
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,240
That is when I'll step in and play cyberpunk.

1301
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:14,720
And I think in this case, I'm kinda, I'm kinda right there too.

1302
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:20,120
Um, I'm curious about it, but just right now there's this, the gaming backlog

1303
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,880
struggle is real, there's so much to play.

1304
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:26,360
I just, I, I'm, I'm not going to get around to that one anytime soon.

1305
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:26,920
I'm really not.

1306
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:28,600
Okay.

1307
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:29,160
Yeah.

1308
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,240
So that's all the fun stuff with cyberpunk.

1309
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,080
I'm sure we'll find some more crazy things.

1310
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:40,000
I also saw some, um, some funny glitches where, uh, certain NPC

1311
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,160
characters would follow you no matter where you went in the game, which was

1312
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,880
also funny, so they had like this like creepy weird guy that was following you

1313
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:48,200
around.

1314
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,840
Um, looking at some comments in chat, uh, code man in chat says, hi, code man.

1315
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:55,800
It's been a while, uh, says, apparently I read an article where they didn't,

1316
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:59,920
uh, accolades, I think, I think he wanted to use another word there and voice to

1317
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:03,720
text messed him up, uh, maybe, uh, accommodate, uh, VRAM correctly.

1318
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:06,680
And that's one of the reasons why it's buggy on PC.

1319
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:11,360
I think they could have delayed this game another six months.

1320
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,600
I think he means allocate.

1321
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,320
That's it.

1322
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:13,880
Allocate.

1323
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:14,440
Thank you.

1324
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:17,720
Um, and I think they could have delayed this game another six months.

1325
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:20,280
And it probably wouldn't have fixed all the bugs, especially on the older

1326
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:25,880
consoles, doing a pretty good job of like, you know, going through it and patching

1327
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:26,320
stuff.

1328
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:27,480
So I don't know.

1329
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:30,040
Black ink.

1330
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:31,520
It's not so bad.

1331
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:35,360
Uh, black and Pat in our chat room says I'm playing it on my series X in

1332
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,400
performance mode and so far so good.

1333
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,400
It are pretty, uh, and I'm not surprised to hear that because you know, the series

1334
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,200
X is basically like a, a real high end PC.

1335
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,080
It's a dedicated, you know, gaming machine.

1336
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:50,440
And I would, I would, especially after my experience with destiny this week, I would

1337
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:55,800
expect that it runs like butter on the series X and PlayStation five, I'm sure as

1338
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,840
well, which I have yet to see.

1339
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,400
So, all right.

1340
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,800
Any other cyberpunk notes for this week?

1341
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:02,760
I'm sure there'll be more.

1342
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:04,400
Uh, that's it.

1343
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:04,840
All right.

1344
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:10,040
Well, one other place that people are playing cyberpunk, um, where apparently

1345
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:14,440
it's a pretty good experience and, you know, uh, despite all the, um, criticisms,

1346
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:19,360
I think that have been levied at Google stadia, uh, the people that have decided

1347
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:23,440
to play cyberpunk on Google stadia are having a pretty good time, um, assuming,

1348
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:27,680
you know, they have the bandwidth to do it because all that cloud, uh, power and

1349
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,960
everything that goes, it's, it's, it's different, you know, there, everything is

1350
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,600
running pretty smooth on that end on stadia.

1351
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:40,120
So that's kind of interesting that with cyberpunk being so buggy on PlayStation

1352
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:44,840
four and, uh, you know, the original X-Box one and all this, it's almost like

1353
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:50,800
it's, this is stadia's best kind of limelight right now for their, what

1354
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:55,440
they're trying to do, like, well, you see how this game doesn't mishmash well

1355
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:56,680
on all these other platforms.

1356
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:01,120
It runs great on ours and you don't have to buy a $500 box to do it because, you

1357
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:05,040
know, one could argue that series X and PlayStation five are fine as well, or a

1358
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:10,000
high end PC, but here's where stadia, uh, can probably make its best argument yet.

1359
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:14,720
Um, However, of course that all still comes down to the question about, do you

1360
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:18,320
have the bandwidth for it, which is, you know, but that's a whole, whole other

1361
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:18,560
thing.

1362
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,160
You got to figure out what works for you.

1363
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:26,640
Um, however, eight more European countries now have access to Google stadia,

1364
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:31,400
including Poland, uh, which is important, you know, considering cyberpunk 2077 and

1365
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:35,840
where it was made, uh, but also Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, uh,

1366
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:40,480
Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and Switzerland now all have access to Google

1367
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:40,880
stadia.

1368
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,040
So that all just rolled out within this last week.

1369
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:46,920
Um, and of course you can play things like cyberpunk, Assassin's Creed, Valhalla,

1370
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:49,240
Marvel's Avengers, uh, and so forth.

1371
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:54,200
Um, something else of note with Google stadia this week is that the use YouTube

1372
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:58,320
live streaming actually rolled out this week just in time for cyberpunk.

1373
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,280
I think they knew that that would be kind of a big deal.

1374
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:04,160
So I remember they teased that early on and then it wasn't really in the pro to

1375
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:04,720
begin with.

1376
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,920
Well, now you can actually go, uh, YouTube streaming.

1377
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:13,200
Uh, it appears to be rolling out and it's now on the service and you can either

1378
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:17,480
stream directly to YouTube or you can use a streaming software to do it.

1379
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:22,080
Although it still kind of pushes you to YouTube for obvious reasons, cause both

1380
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,320
are in the Google universe.

1381
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:28,040
Um, so you, you know, you have to still set things like, is it kid appropriate?

1382
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:31,680
Uh, there's optional features like crowd choice and crowd play.

1383
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,520
Uh, you can also pick your audio options.

1384
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:39,080
Do you want to stream YouTube and game chat, YouTube only party chat or nobody

1385
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,880
and just have the game audio going there?

1386
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:45,920
Um, so kind of interesting that, uh, that all rolled out just in time for cyberpunk.

1387
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,120
I have yet to see any streams myself that are using it.

1388
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,920
Um, but I think that's, I think that's.

1389
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:56,400
Again, you know, I've been awfully critical of Google stadia here on the

1390
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:01,080
show, but I th this week and everything that's happened with cyberpunk has really

1391
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:05,800
given Google an opportunity to say, aha, here's why you need us.

1392
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:10,080
And now maybe they can run with that a little bit and injecting new features

1393
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,600
like the YouTube thing is a, is a decent way to do it and keep people

1394
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:13,680
talking about the platform.

1395
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,200
So we'll see what develops again.

1396
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,240
I still think the bandwidth issue they're going to have to, especially

1397
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:20,160
with Comcast expanding their caps, but we'll see, we'll see.

1398
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:21,960
So, all right.

1399
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,720
Uh, moving on dark soccer.

1400
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:28,880
I know that you said caps, but my brain translated it to cats and I

1401
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,560
I'm thinking of expanding cats.

1402
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,840
And I don't know that that kind of makes me think of the game where you

1403
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:38,160
have like cats that blow up, like the aunt and the Harry Potter movie.

1404
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,280
And you have to pilot them like across the ocean or something

1405
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,960
without, you know, deflating your cat.

1406
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:46,520
There was that cat game we saw on the PlayStation five reveal.

1407
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,400
We haven't heard anything on that in a little while.

1408
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:49,480
And I don't think it's exclusive.

1409
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:50,840
I think my cat game sounds better.

1410
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,640
You know, your cat game sounds pretty rad.

1411
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:54,800
All right, moving on.

1412
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,320
I'm going to call it ever expanding cats.

1413
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:57,840
There we go.

1414
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:03,240
Anyway, well, I'm sure we're all familiar with bad robot studio, right?

1415
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:08,160
Um, well there is bad robots game studios, which is JJ Abrams company.

1416
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:13,320
Um, but they got, uh, valves, uh, Michael booth to, uh, to join in.

1417
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:19,120
Um, and he's leading, uh, bad robot games through its first development cycle.

1418
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:24,200
So, um, he's going to serve as the creative director, um, and jumping

1419
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:26,120
into the video game development.

1420
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:30,120
Actually it started the gaming dev, uh, division in 2018 and

1421
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,520
he's got a pretty good repertoire.

1422
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,440
I mean, just a lot of stuff under his belt.

1423
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:39,560
Um, uh, lead creator for left for dead team fortress to command and conquer

1424
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:44,680
generals, uh, some of the counter-strike games, um, and he's been at blizzard,

1425
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:49,960
uh, EA, uh, I mean, that was a command and conquer red alert two and knocks.

1426
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,760
And social VR director at Facebook.

1427
01:12:53,000 --> 01:13:01,680
Um, but I mean, the thing with bad robot games is that if those licenses carry

1428
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:05,760
over for what they did for some of the, the movies we've got then the newer

1429
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:10,880
star Trek films, uh, star Wars rise of the rise of the Skywalker Cloverfield.

1430
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,560
Um, and it could be very possible.

1431
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,480
Those licenses could expand into video games to have them do the development.

1432
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:22,360
So, I mean, it's just a little bit of a musing there on my part, but,

1433
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:28,920
um, and I think it's going to be, um, be interesting and also, um, the CEO,

1434
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:34,760
uh, who was recently appointed name is Anna Sweet, um, and she was saying

1435
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:38,240
basically that their goal, and I'm going to quote here is to focus on cross

1436
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:42,280
medium world building in order to create games and step with Abrams

1437
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:43,720
television and film projects.

1438
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:47,640
So I'm really looking forward to seeing what comes of the studio.

1439
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,520
I actually have a lot of hope for it.

1440
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:57,600
Um, and as far as, um, they are working on a project right now that has just

1441
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:02,200
been titled triple a title for PC slash console that is designed to immerse

1442
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:06,360
both players and streaming audiences into a co-op cinematic experience.

1443
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:07,280
Okay.

1444
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:11,680
My money, my money's on Cloverfield and that franchise.

1445
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:16,320
Um, but that's, that's just what my gut says.

1446
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,160
Cause it's not going to be something like star Trek cause that has too many

1447
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:22,240
other, so it's gotta be something a little more original and cooked up from

1448
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:25,960
the Abrams and so I Cloverfield would make a lot of sense in that whole thing.

1449
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:30,160
And, you know, of course you're going to have a lens flare mode.

1450
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:35,040
If it's going to be a star Trek, I was going to say like with the Ray tracing

1451
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:38,960
powers of these new consoles, you know, I, this is going to be great for the,

1452
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:44,120
uh, lens flares that the bad robots games are sure to have Abrams loves his lens

1453
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:48,920
flare, but you know, you know, actually what I'm hoping for though is it would

1454
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:54,000
be cool if the game is released, that's got a cinematic style that mimics,

1455
01:14:54,080 --> 01:15:01,080
uh, certain cameras and film, because I mean, one of the things that they, he

1456
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:05,080
was, it was specifically when they were shooting, um, the, the star Trek movies

1457
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:10,240
is that, uh, he was using, I think it was like an older style of camera and, uh,

1458
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:15,320
actually using film just to catch those, those effects, I have to go back and look

1459
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:19,640
for it, but I know it had something to do with the, um, with a specific lens

1460
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,200
used on it.

1461
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,840
So I thought it was really cool.

1462
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:26,600
And I was actually, uh, joking about the lens flare thing, Bobby.

1463
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:28,080
Well, let me read Bobby's comment.

1464
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,840
Cause, uh, Abrams no longer loves his lens flares.

1465
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:34,560
Uh, his wife pointed out how bad they were in the second star Trek movie.

1466
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:36,440
And he was like, holy shit, you're right.

1467
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:37,680
So Gigi lens flare.

1468
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,120
Yeah.

1469
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:42,840
We'll get a sequel to super eight.

1470
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,880
Remember they did the thing in, um, source engine for super eight back when

1471
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,920
that came out, super eight was such a good movie too.

1472
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:56,360
I think that would be awesome, but yeah, unfortunately, it didn't really tie in

1473
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:00,240
with, um, I was hoping that that movie would tie in with Cloverfield, but I

1474
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:00,920
don't think it did.

1475
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:01,920
No, it didn't.

1476
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:05,320
A lot of weird Cloverfield spinoffs that I haven't watched.

1477
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:08,680
There was a, yeah, there was the, I've never actually seen any of the

1478
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:11,320
Cloverfield at all.

1479
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:14,440
I saw the first one and it was interesting.

1480
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:15,280
Yeah.

1481
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:20,240
The Cloverfield, uh, paradox and then 10 Cloverfield lane and yeah.

1482
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:20,840
Yeah.

1483
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:21,320
I heard that.

1484
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,840
I heard that 10 Cloverfield lane is pretty, because John Goodman's in that

1485
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,480
one and everybody was saying he got robbed, not getting an Oscar nomination

1486
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:31,600
for it, which is weird to think of Oscar and Cloverfield, but good

1487
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,640
acting is good acting, right?

1488
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:33,840
Yeah.

1489
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:38,480
Like, I don't know, maybe when I get back on to this, that kind of movie kick.

1490
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:42,920
To this day, Joan Cusack deserved a Oscar nomination for Adam's Family

1491
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:43,440
Values.

1492
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,640
I don't give a shit what you have to say.

1493
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,120
She was actually perfect.

1494
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,960
She elevates, she, she made that movie about a character that

1495
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,280
wasn't just the Adams family.

1496
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:52,920
Sorry.

1497
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:57,440
I just, I need a whole podcast to talk about Joan Cusack.

1498
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,000
What, what?

1499
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:02,960
We need to have a Joan Cusack double feature where we watch, uh,

1500
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,840
Adam's Family Values and toys.

1501
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,000
Oh, sure.

1502
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:09,880
I love toys, toys in years.

1503
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,160
And that was my Christmas movie right there.

1504
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:16,560
Wasn't that Tori Amos that did the soundtrack?

1505
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:17,680
I love it.

1506
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:18,400
I love that.

1507
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,080
It's like the title song they have.

1508
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,120
I don't think it was Tori Amos.

1509
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,600
I think it was, um, it was someone along those lines.

1510
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:27,600
And for the life of me, I can't remember one of those piano divas.

1511
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:31,080
Yeah, but not like Kate Bush.

1512
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:31,960
She doesn't do anything.

1513
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:35,400
Um, Kate, Kate Bush does, does her own.

1514
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,920
Kate Bush does things when she damn well feels like it.

1515
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,480
And you will respect that fucking Kate Bush.

1516
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:41,320
That's right.

1517
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:44,280
She's running up that Hill still for the record.

1518
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:45,960
I love Kate Bush.

1519
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:49,840
Like she's like when she puts out a record, like stop everything and do it.

1520
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:50,960
All right.

1521
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:54,240
Another, another artist I really like that might surprise you, who I was just,

1522
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:57,360
I was just thinking the other day, dark cycle, maybe you can guess this one.

1523
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:00,520
I was just thinking the other day, this artist hasn't released

1524
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:01,960
anything in, in several years.

1525
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,880
Tori Amos, by the way, that did that one song.

1526
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:04,520
What is it?

1527
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,000
I was right.

1528
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:06,600
The happy worker.

1529
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:12,080
Um, and yeah, and yeah, dark soccer wins and you was in it.

1530
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:14,160
And so is grace Jones.

1531
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:15,200
Really?

1532
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:18,280
No, but any of us, the artists I was thinking of, like where the hell she been?

1533
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:20,120
She's she's tied up in her castle with her cats.

1534
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:23,120
So jealous of her life.

1535
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:23,520
All right.

1536
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:26,520
Anyway, uh, let's like our sister better.

1537
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:29,040
All right, let's move on.

1538
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:29,840
Sorry.

1539
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:32,840
Uh, we've, we've diverted the show into Kate Bush and Enya talk.

1540
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:39,080
Not divert quick next story.

1541
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:45,200
So I know one of the things that was missing at launch for the Xbox series S

1542
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:52,560
and X is some solid Microsoft, uh, first party games well, unfortunately,

1543
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:57,920
2021 doesn't appear to be much of, there's not much of that either.

1544
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:02,440
So apparently, uh, we don't really know of any first party games that

1545
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,480
are going to be coming in 2021.

1546
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,800
Cause the release calendar doesn't include, um, that many.

1547
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:08,280
So.

1548
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:14,040
Halo infinite, uh, was definitely something that I know that was slated

1549
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,520
for next year, although I'm not sure.

1550
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,280
I mean, it may be holiday.

1551
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:22,080
Uh, Psychonauts two is also supposed to be coming as well.

1552
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:26,720
I'm surprised though, like with all the third party or all those, um, first

1553
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,960
party companies that they have that there's not something else that's coming

1554
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:34,240
out, but right now we don't know of a whole lot else that's, um, coming out.

1555
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:37,920
I know echo generation, something that's supposed to be on its way.

1556
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:42,520
The gunk, uh, the medium, but I don't think we have definitive dates

1557
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:44,200
on a lot of that stuff as well.

1558
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:53,280
So it's interesting not having like a Microsoft title, like coming very soon.

1559
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:54,000
Yeah.

1560
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,960
Especially with, um, Halo getting pushed all the way back to fall,

1561
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,520
which, um, I think came up this week.

1562
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:02,720
Um, and, uh, you know, but again, take the time to get it right.

1563
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:06,040
And if Halo was really, you know, having some issues behind the scenes,

1564
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:11,040
I, again, playing destiny two with all its upgrades and everything kind of

1565
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:16,920
showed me like just how good a Halo game on Xbox series X can be.

1566
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:19,880
So I'm kind of glad they're going to, uh, have it spend a

1567
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:21,040
little more time in the oven.

1568
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,240
Um, but I'm not, I don't know.

1569
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:27,960
It's, I can't sit here and go, there's nothing to play on my Xbox series X.

1570
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,240
Like I'm not, I'm not feeling that way really.

1571
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:33,160
And you know, I don't know, maybe the game releases are going to be a

1572
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:41,080
little dry early next year, but I feel like what Sony got, like what's Nintendo got.

1573
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,680
We don't, I think there's a lot of stuff that have really slowed

1574
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,040
down because of the pandemic.

1575
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:45,520
Sure.

1576
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,160
That's cause there's going to be, and I'm sure you guys are

1577
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:48,120
already shouting them out in chat.

1578
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:49,120
Well, there's this game, there's this game.

1579
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:49,600
Yes.

1580
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,160
There's going to be a few big ones here and there.

1581
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:56,040
But I, I, I think Microsoft being without first party for a few months

1582
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:59,200
is not the end of the world, as long as they can keep the steady stream

1583
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:03,760
of releases somehow, uh, as long as they can keep game pass exciting, uh, by

1584
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,000
adding new things here and there.

1585
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,880
Cause you know, most of the Xbox people have game pass at this point anyway.

1586
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:11,160
Um, and so on, I, I kind of feel like it's going to be fine.

1587
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:13,400
Yeah.

1588
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,680
I mean, I'm sure they're going to do fine with games pass.

1589
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:19,040
Uh, I just would like to know when some of these games are coming out, especially

1590
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:24,440
since we've had a lot of stuff teased, especially during E3 time, uh, this year,

1591
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,440
you know, they kind of teased a lot of different games that are coming, but.

1592
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:32,320
I know a lot of those aren't probably even going to make it in 2021.

1593
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:35,640
So it'd be curious to see the, what actually is coming out.

1594
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,960
And I'm sure that we'll get more and more of these release

1595
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,720
announcements and stuff coming.

1596
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:45,360
Um, I also wish I knew what Nintendo had aside from rereleases of old games.

1597
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:48,760
It'd be kind of interesting to hear some more about the next, you know,

1598
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,400
breath of the wild game or something.

1599
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:53,000
Um, we'll just have to wait and see, I guess.

1600
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:58,080
Yeah, we don't really know much outside of the, uh, super Mario, uh, 3d lands

1601
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:58,960
that's, you know, coming out.

1602
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:04,240
So I'm expecting we should be getting a direct probably January or February,

1603
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:09,920
which if they wanted to reveal a switch pro would be a good time to do it.

1604
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:13,480
Um, you know, obviously we talked about this last week and I had that fan wank

1605
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:18,480
scenario of, well, could they do a, um, reveal at the game awards?

1606
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:19,840
You brought up a really good counterpoint.

1607
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,160
They're not going to do that right before Christmas when they're trying to sell

1608
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:25,200
switches after Christmas fair game.

1609
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:32,560
I think they won't announce anything like that until, um, March until March 31st.

1610
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:35,520
I don't think we're going to hear anything from a new switch system.

1611
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:39,400
And if anything, I would see them not releasing it during holiday.

1612
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,640
I could even see them release it during the summer.

1613
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:42,080
Yeah.

1614
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:47,040
Um, I don't think it necessarily needs to be in March or even around Christmas time.

1615
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:51,080
Um, it doesn't matter anyways, no one's going to get one because they can't get

1616
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:56,400
their supply chain figured out, however many decades into this we've been.

1617
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:00,960
They really should try to figure out how they're going to get that out by next

1618
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:05,040
summer or, you know, next fall, because I think you're going to see society, you

1619
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:09,520
know, as the coronavirus vaccine starts to get more and more out there and, you

1620
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:13,760
know, things start to, you know, get a little, we get, we have big in person,

1621
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:16,200
in person gatherings again, we are able to travel again.

1622
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,760
It's obviously, it's not going to happen overnight.

1623
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,120
You know, I am being a realist here, but I think you are going to see a big push

1624
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:22,800
in society.

1625
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:26,000
Like there's going to be lots of people that are like, I want to take that

1626
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:26,600
vacation.

1627
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:30,520
I've been waiting a year and a half to do, or I want to go on this big trip or the,

1628
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:35,400
and I feel like having a switch come out for that type of stuff is going to be

1629
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:38,960
like when, when people get moving again and you know, the, the whole country

1630
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:43,200
starts to get back to some semblance of normal, even if that normal now has

1631
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:47,440
tweaks through these things, like, you know, working from home and masks and so

1632
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:51,680
forth, I think you're going to see a big, I think it would be smart of Nintendo

1633
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:55,400
too, even if they are a Japanese company, but I don't necessarily think, you

1634
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:58,440
know, even though Japan has handled the situation very differently, I don't

1635
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:02,240
think it's necessarily unfair to say that, you know, they wouldn't have a big

1636
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:05,200
push to, you know, getting back to the way things were in summer and fall as

1637
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:05,480
well.

1638
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:08,520
And having the switch there would be pretty amazing, I think.

1639
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:10,800
Yeah, yeah.

1640
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,920
Well, wait and see, they're on, they're on time table.

1641
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:17,440
So we'll have to figure out what they're planning on doing.

1642
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:21,000
SSU 100 Matt in chat says, I hope the national parks get some love again.

1643
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:22,120
I'm sure they will.

1644
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:26,240
You know, if you're looking at doing any travel in 2021, like I know it's

1645
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:29,360
weird, but you want to, you want to try to put that on the calendar sooner

1646
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:32,360
rather than later, because I'm going to tell you, these companies have lost

1647
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:35,160
a lot of money and they're going to be trying to make it up when everybody

1648
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:36,840
wants to travel again, it's going to cost money.

1649
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:42,240
So, uh, like I already booked my DragonCon 2021 ticket because, you know, I can

1650
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:46,000
refund it if the refund policy allows me to, if we're not able, you know, if

1651
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:49,440
Labor Day isn't enough time or, you know, DragonCon is too big of a gathering,

1652
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:53,440
then, okay, then I will refund it and roll it over to 2022, but I wanted to

1653
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:57,480
lock it in now because I expect those prices to go up when, you know, people

1654
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:59,120
are able to get out and do stuff again.

1655
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:02,320
You should have let me know so we could fly together.

1656
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:08,600
Uh, I, I had to use credit from last time, but I'll give you the info on what it is.

1657
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:09,880
Well, we'll see.

1658
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:10,360
We'll see.

1659
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:15,120
I mean, I, um, but I do, I do very much want to go to DragonCon this year.

1660
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:19,280
Cause I've already sworn not to go to RuPaul's DragCon again, because of just

1661
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:26,000
some of their shit and a lot of the shit that Ru is doing, but I, I really,

1662
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
really want to go to, to DragonCon.

1663
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,120
And my thing about that is that afterwards I actually want to just

1664
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:33,520
rent a car and drive back to Alabama to visit my family.

1665
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:35,040
Oh, that's clever.

1666
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:35,680
You should.

1667
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:36,200
That'd be cool.

1668
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:39,200
I mean, it's from Atlanta to Mobile.

1669
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,120
I want to say it's about six hours.

1670
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:42,760
I know it's about four to Dothan.

1671
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:47,200
That's about as far as it was for, um, when I went from X first place

1672
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:50,120
in Cary, North Carolina, it was about a six hour drive, so yeah.

1673
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:55,640
I think I'd be closer to, um, yeah, that actually, yeah, that's about right.

1674
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:56,200
That's about right.

1675
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:56,640
Yeah.

1676
01:25:56,680 --> 01:26:00,120
Um, although a part of me also wants to go to Augusta to visit my grandmother's

1677
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:04,040
cousins, who I haven't seen since I was little, um, and Bob Coffey in chat

1678
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:07,000
says, I don't see cons being a thing until late 2021 at best.

1679
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,800
It depends on how well the adults who are taking over our federal

1680
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:13,520
government, January 20th can reign in the crazy and actually get some things done.

1681
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:13,720
Yeah.

1682
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:17,680
I mean, I realize I'm being optimistic.

1683
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:22,560
Um, but I, I, if I don't have optimism about the future, like then I just.

1684
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:25,000
Well, I have to have something to look forward to damn it.

1685
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,000
So, you know, but I full well aware in the back of my mind, it may not happen

1686
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,480
again or DragonCon, maybe a smaller affair this year, they may do something

1687
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:35,200
where they actually cap attendance at a certain number or something.

1688
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:35,760
I don't know.

1689
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:36,480
I have nothing.

1690
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:39,800
I, I'm just saying there's a lot of things that could happen.

1691
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:41,240
We won't know until we know.

1692
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:44,800
So as, as has been the, the theme of this year.

1693
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:45,320
All right.

1694
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:47,040
Anyway, um, let's move on.

1695
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,520
Shall we speak?

1696
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:51,560
Well, actually, you know what, even though we tangented, it ties

1697
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:52,800
right into this next story.

1698
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,040
So that's, that's a first.

1699
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:56,760
Our tangent was a transition.

1700
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:04,120
Uh, Epic has no plans to do in-person tournaments for the game Fortnite in 2021.

1701
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:08,520
So, you know, uh, as was mentioned by the chatter there, they don't see,

1702
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:11,880
uh, real life events coming back until at least late 2021.

1703
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:15,840
And even though last week we were talking about Penny arcade, trying to

1704
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:19,000
expo, trying to be on the hopeful side of things and scheduling out events

1705
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,520
for the 2021 year, uh, Epic is taking a different approach.

1706
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:26,360
The 2021 Fortnite world cup, uh, will not be held in person.

1707
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:31,280
Uh, the Fortnite champions champion series will be the focus for 2021 as the.

1708
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:36,280
Constant measure of success in the, uh, landscape of competition for Fortnite.

1709
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:40,840
And they're hoping that physical attorneys will return at some point in the future.

1710
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:42,080
Uh, it should be noted.

1711
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:46,640
This could be part of the fact that the season was going to begin on February 4th.

1712
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,880
So it was going to be a little early, but they did just decide to do

1713
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:51,240
a way with, you know, all of it.

1714
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:56,600
Um, it should be noted that other big events, such as Dota two's, the

1715
01:27:56,600 --> 01:28:01,520
international is still on the table for 2021, um, but we don't know yet.

1716
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:05,480
Uh, you know, again, and as a lot of you has said, we just have to see how this

1717
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:11,480
whole rollout goes with vaccines and does it give society herd immunity or,

1718
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:12,800
you know, what's going to happen with it.

1719
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,840
So, uh, we shall see.

1720
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:18,880
I, I know as soon as they'll let me get it, I'll be getting it because

1721
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,520
I want to see people again, damn it.

1722
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:24,520
So, and obviously you have to get it and then you have to wait.

1723
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:26,920
This is not a, it's not a switch that happens overnight.

1724
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:30,320
So, cause you have to get one, then you get the other, then you still have

1725
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:33,160
to wait like two or three weeks or maybe even a month to build up the antibodies.

1726
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:34,520
So, all right.

1727
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:38,480
Anyway, uh, let's move on with our next story, Dark Sakura.

1728
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:46,200
Well, you know, it's funny, we talked about Abrams before and he did, you

1729
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:49,400
know, the star Wars movies, I guess we're kind of rolling back maybe a little bit,

1730
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:54,120
but honestly, um, I'm actually really excited about this movie coming out

1731
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:57,200
because I want to see what Patty Jenkins does with it and that star Wars, rogue

1732
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:03,560
squadron, and it must be said because I've seen this come up in, in my social

1733
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:09,680
media several times, but I want to point out then that star Wars rogue squadron.

1734
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:13,360
Is not going to be based off of the games.

1735
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:18,080
Um, it is not an adaptation and I've seen, I've actually seen people start

1736
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,600
saying, Oh, it's going to be an adaptation, blah, blah, blah, but no.

1737
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:25,920
Um, she did, however, say that, um, you know, Jenkins said it was going to be

1738
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:30,440
an original story, but she said that it will be done with quote, great influence

1739
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:36,720
from both rogue squadron video games and books, so we might have to see what's

1740
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:40,960
coming on on it is she's actually pulling the origin from a comic book series.

1741
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,560
It was written by Michael Stackpole.

1742
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:49,680
Um, that again was directly inspired from, uh, the first two of the star

1743
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:52,920
Wars movies, which episode four and five, I'm sorry, I think of them when

1744
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,280
they were released as what was first.

1745
01:29:54,920 --> 01:30:00,280
Um, and then, um, and some books called the throng trilogy, which we've heard,

1746
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:04,160
uh, if, well, I guess if you're living under a rock and you haven't

1747
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:06,800
watched the Mandalorian, I'm not going to say anything else.

1748
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:15,040
Um, but, uh, but I think there's going to be a lot that we'll see as

1749
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:18,640
homage anyway, but it's still an original story and it's not really

1750
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:21,840
going from not an adaptation as I was saying, so that's it.

1751
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,960
Um, boy, and you know, just as a quick aside, you know, even though it's not

1752
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:30,160
directly about gaming, but during the game awards, that same night was when

1753
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:34,760
Disney was doing this big dump of, you know, all this stuff they're planning

1754
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:35,920
during their investor meeting.

1755
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:39,960
And it's, it's pretty shocking how much they're going to crank out.

1756
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:46,280
What was an entire clause addressing it in chat, 10 star Wars shows, 10 Marvel

1757
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:51,200
shows, and I know there was a shit ton of Disney shows too, um, cause 15, I

1758
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:55,400
think, yeah, there was like, I know they were doing one for, um, Tiana, uh,

1759
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:58,800
from, uh, um, the, the, oh my God.

1760
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:01,440
And I even love this movie and I can't even remember the name of it in the moment.

1761
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:02,080
Thank you.

1762
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:08,240
The Prince of the Frog, uh, is getting a show and, um, the, um, uh, Zootopia

1763
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:11,400
is getting a, um, series, which I know is going to make some friends of mine

1764
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:15,760
happy and, and there's like a lot of, uh, stuff that's getting expanded on with

1765
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:16,160
series.

1766
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:19,400
And then of course I got several text messages alerting me to the fact that

1767
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:23,760
sister act three was confirmed, which is important on, so I made this big, like,

1768
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,840
yay, they're doing sister act three.

1769
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:28,120
And then it was like, and Tyler Perry is co-producing it.

1770
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:34,600
And I was like, oh, we'll see how that goes.

1771
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:36,640
Just, I swear to, is it going to have Whoopi?

1772
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:37,400
Oh yeah.

1773
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:41,280
Whoopi's Whoopi's like co-producing it and she's very influential in it with

1774
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:42,000
Tyler Perry.

1775
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:48,080
So my own, my only request, you do not put Medea in that fucking movie.

1776
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:54,920
Do not under any circumstance, Medea is not to be in that movie period.

1777
01:31:55,360 --> 01:32:01,800
Because I just it's let the sister act universe be on its own.

1778
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:03,000
It does not need a crossover.

1779
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:04,120
Kathy Najimy.

1780
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:04,840
Yes.

1781
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:09,560
Uh, I don't know if they would be able to get, um, um, Maggie Smith.

1782
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:13,000
Um, poor thing is, is very, very old at this point, but I'd love it if she made

1783
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:13,800
a cameo somehow.

1784
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:15,400
Oh, I love her.

1785
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:16,400
Okay.

1786
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:20,920
Sia Tabiri says sister act three is just being bankrolled by Tyler Perry.

1787
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:21,320
Okay.

1788
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:24,360
Well, good, I guess.

1789
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:25,520
Oh yeah.

1790
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,280
And Hocus Pocus too is actually, that was, yeah.

1791
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:29,040
Yeah.

1792
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,560
So I haven't seen the first one and I can actually still quote the movie.

1793
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:32,800
I'm the same way with Mean Girls.

1794
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:42,840
All, um, all of those announcements and nothing about Tron, nothing.

1795
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:47,520
But you know, they did make those mentions, uh, earlier in the year that

1796
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:50,360
there was something going on behind the scenes for Tron.

1797
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:52,000
Maybe they just turned to a trailer point.

1798
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,440
Cause this is like trailer stuff, you know.

1799
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:55,360
Not everything though.

1800
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:56,720
They have a lot of announcements.

1801
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:57,800
It had no trailers.

1802
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:02,440
They have to just like title cards or we had, we had a teaser about something

1803
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:06,240
would care about his Tron, all Tron all the time, but the only thing we had was

1804
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:08,640
that tease that Jared Leto was somehow involved.

1805
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:09,360
Yay.

1806
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:15,400
Excuse me while I go.

1807
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:19,240
Why can't we just get a sequel to the last movie?

1808
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:21,840
Why, why would that be such a hard thing to do?

1809
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:26,760
And it definitely needs a Cillian Anderson in it as, um, cause he's a

1810
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:30,240
Derringer's kid and I'm sorry.

1811
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:32,240
Murphy's pretty Cillian Murphy.

1812
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:37,560
Why I say Murphy, but anyway, he's Jillian Anderson could absolutely be in Tron.

1813
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:40,040
If she wanted to be, I meant Cillian Murphy.

1814
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:41,320
Yeah, excuse me.

1815
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:46,080
I, but, but he's so pretty and I want him to be, um, Derringer.

1816
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:50,000
Like takeover, like with an MCP and everything, not like a complete

1817
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:53,640
rehash of the first movie, but I would fucking love to see them do something.

1818
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:56,840
All right, let's move on from Disney chat.

1819
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,360
Although I knew it would come up at some point, but there was just, there was a

1820
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:02,320
lot of stuff that came out there and I saw the discord blown up with all that

1821
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:04,560
too over at vog network.com slash discord.

1822
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:06,560
Some of you guys like to share articles throughout the week.

1823
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:10,800
Rob, you know what we just need to do is just take a quick, you know, hiatus

1824
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:14,920
during the halfway of the show, take an intermission run to Del Taco and get

1825
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:19,800
some churros and run back churro chat on orange laundry, churro chat.

1826
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:23,640
All right, moving on serious stuff though.

1827
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:28,400
Uh, Twitch chat, we've got a couple of stories about Twitch and, um, one,

1828
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:31,120
one, I think is generally good news.

1829
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:32,680
The other one really not good news.

1830
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:34,280
And we'll start with the not good news, right?

1831
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:34,560
Logie.

1832
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,000
Yeah.

1833
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:44,000
So right now, um, the, uh, U S government has to pass a spending bill basically

1834
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,160
to approve the spending for, uh, next year.

1835
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:53,720
And with that, what is something that's been happened in the past is that they

1836
01:34:53,720 --> 01:35:01,320
try to sneak in different, um, measures just that might not be able to pass on

1837
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:05,120
their own, but then also might be something that they may not just

1838
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:08,920
necessarily vehemently disagree with just to try to get it passed.

1839
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:13,800
And that's what we have Republican Senator Thom Tillis doing with a

1840
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:18,440
proposal that would turn unauthorized commercial streaming of copyright

1841
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:24,640
music, um, into like, for example, an album on YouTube video clip on Twitch

1842
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:30,480
or song and Instagram story into a felony offense with possible prison sentence.

1843
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:38,040
Uh, apparently, you know, this obviously is not a good thing and it should be of

1844
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:43,800
no surprise that Tillis is also being funded by PACS that are, um, have

1845
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:51,040
donations with ties to the MPAA, uh, the Sony pictures, universal music group,

1846
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:56,560
Comcast, NBC universal, um, the internet and television associations,

1847
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:58,400
Salem media group and Warner music.

1848
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:03,000
So basically in the pocket of all of those media companies and trying to

1849
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:09,680
pass something that would try to basically end all fair use of, you know,

1850
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:13,360
copyrighted material, uh, it's a really dangerous thing.

1851
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:18,160
And so of course, you know, there has been several folks that have spoken out

1852
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:25,000
against it, the EFF and internet archive, uh, the American liberal library

1853
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:30,120
association center for democracy and technology collective, um, have all

1854
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:35,560
sent letters to the Senate last week as well, but I mean, right now they

1855
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:43,120
have kind of a, uh, interim bill that's passed to extend it out to the 18th

1856
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:47,520
of December, but they are going to be voting on this pretty soon.

1857
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:51,200
So that it's kind of scary that this is not the first time that they've tried

1858
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:52,600
to slip something like this in.

1859
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:54,600
I think he's done it in the past before.

1860
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:56,680
Just, I don't know.

1861
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:59,720
I don't understand why this is a thing in our government, how they can just

1862
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:02,120
suddenly slap on other bills to existing bills.

1863
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:03,120
It's really ridiculous.

1864
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:03,320
Yeah.

1865
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:04,960
I don't think it should be like that either.

1866
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:10,680
Um, but, uh, yeah, I, obviously all of us are sitting here going, this is bad, bad

1867
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:11,040
news.

1868
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:16,400
Like, I, I understand if, you know, somebody is like filming a movie in a

1869
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:19,840
theater with the intention of trying to distribute that on YouTube, you know, the

1870
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,960
very, very blatant kind of piracy.

1871
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:26,480
I can, I kind of understand where maybe they want to, I mean, but I don't know,

1872
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:27,920
a felony for God's sake.

1873
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:33,360
Like, I don't, I, I, it's, yeah, it's not like, yeah, the, the copyright law needs

1874
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:37,440
reform, but this is way too much because it's, it's going to get ugly.

1875
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:40,600
It's going to get ugly for things like Twitch, you know, like we, I think it

1876
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:42,680
needs reform in the other direction.

1877
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:45,200
I think they've gotten away with way too much as it is.

1878
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:50,160
And basically, you know, Disney being a big proponent of that, just like really

1879
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:54,880
the abuse, what we really need to do is get money out of politics, but that's not

1880
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:56,280
going to be a thing for awhile.

1881
01:37:56,320 --> 01:38:00,040
I mean, that's the problem is you have these people that are basically bought

1882
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:05,120
and paid for politicians that are voting on stuff that only benefits, you know,

1883
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:08,880
these large companies as if they don't make enough money from their stuff.

1884
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:13,960
I really don't, they've always been argued or, you know, piracy's hurting

1885
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:16,480
their business, but like, it's just because they don't want to adapt to

1886
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:17,800
new business models.

1887
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:23,840
Um, I just honestly don't think that like a lot of stuff is really hurt that much

1888
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:26,200
by, I mean, these guys are making tons of money.

1889
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:30,320
A record profits each year, but it's not enough.

1890
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:31,320
They need all of the money.

1891
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:31,920
Yeah.

1892
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:36,400
It's like with any though, if you think about it, like a physical store, you

1893
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:41,480
know, every physical store has a loss prevention group, but they still factor

1894
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:46,160
in a certain amount of losses from theft.

1895
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:54,680
And I think that they need to, I'm trying to think of how I want to phrase

1896
01:38:54,680 --> 01:39:02,080
this because also as an artist myself, I do, I've had my work stolen before,

1897
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:09,840
you know, and I think that the copyright laws need to be stronger to protect

1898
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:16,480
the, the artists, the, that aren't sponsored by some big company.

1899
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:22,440
They need to be more stringent for art stolen from the, uh, the independent

1900
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:26,880
user, and I think not so much for the company, they need to get rid of the

1901
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:30,280
whole corporations as people things so that it doesn't apply in the same manner.

1902
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:31,080
Does that make sense?

1903
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:33,040
You, you, I do agree.

1904
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:36,800
You need to have the ability, like when, when somebody like a, one of these, you

1905
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:41,360
know, websites that sits out there that does a lot of Facebook ads, steals a

1906
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:44,280
design that you made, and we hear about this type of stuff on social media all

1907
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:48,400
the time, you need to have a legal way to go after that company that does not

1908
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:51,800
require you to have a super expensive lawyer and all this stuff and things that

1909
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:53,280
the normal person can't afford.

1910
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:54,200
Absolutely.

1911
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:56,920
And that's part of what the copyright law needs to look at.

1912
01:39:56,920 --> 01:40:01,760
But like a felony, like, I mean, it would, I guess it would depend on the

1913
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:02,360
circumstance.

1914
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:03,040
That's the problem.

1915
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:06,640
And I think what's, what's like, if you have a particular company that's doing

1916
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:10,520
this over and over and over again, and that's their whole MO, then maybe I kind

1917
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:10,960
of get it.

1918
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:18,560
Um, but like, I, I feel like the language in this is too broad and it's gonna get

1919
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,600
used not the right way.

1920
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:21,160
That's the,

1921
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:25,840
that's why they leave it so broad is so that they can have it be interpreted in

1922
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:29,800
court a different way at a later time when it eventually does come to it.

1923
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:30,800
I mean, they bank on this.

1924
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:31,320
Yeah.

1925
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:43,120
So I, I, I just have very little respect I think for, well, especially, you know,

1926
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:47,280
just given the whole state of the Republican party anyway, I look at

1927
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:52,200
anything that, honestly, I could look at any type of legislation that's announced

1928
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:58,600
by practically anybody right now in, uh, in Congress with a high suspicion, just

1929
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:03,120
about there's a few people who I would probably trust on site, but I would still

1930
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:03,880
want to look it over.

1931
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:05,960
All right.

1932
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:10,920
Well, let's move on to something a little more, I think, um, positive for possible

1933
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:11,960
Twitch future news.

1934
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:16,760
Uh, and, uh, well, I mean, it's not a positive topic, but it is Twitch taking

1935
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:19,960
action on something they've been asked to take action on for quite some time.

1936
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:24,760
And that is a new policy on hateful conduct and harassment was finally rolled

1937
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:28,800
out, uh, this past week, and it will be going into effect on January 22nd.

1938
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:32,080
Um, and you might be wondering like, why not now?

1939
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:37,920
Um, they did the delay to give streamers and audience members time to be ready for

1940
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:40,960
it and basically either adjust their behavior appropriately.

1941
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:43,120
I'm assuming provide feedback and so forth.

1942
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:45,720
Um, but that's why there's a little bit of a gap there.

1943
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:50,760
Um, so, uh, I'm going to try to summarize some of these things happening here.

1944
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:54,280
And I think these, these are all things where I'm like, wow, this wasn't there

1945
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:54,880
before.

1946
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:56,240
I'm glad it's there.

1947
01:41:56,480 --> 01:42:00,880
Um, Twitch is adding three protected identity characteristics to their list of

1948
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:04,760
hateful conduct, caste, color, and immigration status.

1949
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:09,040
So if you attack someone based on one of these traits, which other traits that are

1950
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:14,000
there already include sex, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, racism, so

1951
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
they're adding these things to it.

1952
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,840
But if you attack somebody on one of these basis, you basically are risking

1953
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:19,640
punishment for that.

1954
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:25,600
Um, one that's been getting a lot of like, Oh, interesting kind of reactions is that

1955
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:30,080
the Confederate flag is now on Twitch's list of hate symbols and it is banned from

1956
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:30,600
streams.

1957
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:36,040
Uh, and quote, it is fucking hateful and I'm a southerner quote, given its historic

1958
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:40,680
and symbolic association with slavery and white supremacist groups in the U S uh, and

1959
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:46,600
also they are, uh, explicitly saying hate groups and propaganda are prohibited as

1960
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:47,000
well.

1961
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:53,480
Emotes also fall into this policy, so you may not have some type of, um, I don't

1962
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:58,520
know, white supremacist sign or whatever code, coded thing in a emote that is

1963
01:42:58,520 --> 01:42:59,400
against the rules.

1964
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:04,960
Other specific behavior, um, claiming the victim of a well-documented tragedy is a

1965
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:12,800
crisis actor, encouraging others to docs, hack, SWAT or DDoS somebody and inciting

1966
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:16,240
malicious raids of another person's social media profiles.

1967
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:18,840
Again, that's all stuff I think that needs to be there.

1968
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:22,840
Um, so there's, there's, there's a lot of things here.

1969
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:28,120
Um, sexual harassment is now, uh, they are adopting a much lower tolerance for

1970
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:33,360
objectifying or harassing behavior specifically repeatedly commenting on

1971
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:37,640
someone's attractiveness when they've indicated their discomfort verbally or

1972
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:39,640
through timeouts and channel bands.

1973
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:44,800
So if you're continuing to say, you know, Loki, you're looking mighty fine in that

1974
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:45,720
sweater today.

1975
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:46,600
Well, thank you.

1976
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:49,120
Well, see, now if you say that, then I'm not going against that.

1977
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:52,320
But if you're like, um, you don't need to comment on those things.

1978
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,440
I wish you wouldn't comment on that.

1979
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:57,320
Then if I were to take that for further and continue that, and I don't, I could

1980
01:43:57,320 --> 01:43:59,400
keep going with the example, but I want to make light of it because it's a very

1981
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:00,160
serious situation.

1982
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:01,920
Um, it fucking is.

1983
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:02,920
Yeah, I'll tell you what.

1984
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:05,040
I just ended up being blunt about it to begin with.

1985
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:06,840
I'm like, don't say that to me.

1986
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:07,200
Yeah.

1987
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:08,960
But I'm just finally like that.

1988
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,720
Don't tell me that.

1989
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:14,240
If somebody ignores that and continues with that, they are now in violation of the

1990
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:14,720
policy.

1991
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:16,840
So that's, yeah, that's good.

1992
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:18,920
You know, I'm not going to be fucking polite about it.

1993
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:23,520
Um, and if you make explicit comments about someone's sexuality or physical

1994
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:28,080
appearance, even if they're a public figure, it's interesting and sharing

1995
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:31,480
unsolicited nude images or videos again, I should hope not Christ.

1996
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:38,520
Um, so, um, yeah, that's, that's great because I can't tell you how many LGBTQ

1997
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:39,480
streamers I see.

1998
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:43,560
Um, or, you know, folks are streaming and people go into the streams.

1999
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:46,320
They're like, LOL, you're gay.

2000
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:49,920
And it's like, yeah, why, why?

2001
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:50,520
Yes.

2002
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:52,160
Random person on the internet.

2003
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:54,360
I am, I am gay.

2004
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,160
Um, thanks.

2005
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:58,240
You know, it's like stupid crap like that.

2006
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:03,360
Finally, uh, as part of the statement, I know I'm, I'm reading a lot here, but this

2007
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:04,160
is important shit.

2008
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:06,400
Uh, Twitch continued in their statement.

2009
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:11,680
We know that many people on Twitch, particularly women, members of the LGBTQIA

2010
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:15,400
community, black, indigenous, and people of color, unfortunately continue to

2011
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:19,400
experience a disproportionate amount of harassment and abuse online, including on

2012
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:19,960
our service.

2013
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:24,440
Not only is this blatantly unacceptable, it also undermines the community we're

2014
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:27,880
building on Twitch and threatens the long-term viability of streaming as a

2015
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:30,520
career for everyone who wishes to pursue it.

2016
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:37,400
So I think a lot is to be determined in the enforcement of said guidelines.

2017
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:41,840
And if we actually see Twitch kind of put in their oomph where their mouth is with

2018
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:47,400
this, but in the interim, as I did earlier, I shall award one polite clap for

2019
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:48,040
this update.

2020
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:55,760
And we will see, uh, I will, uh, uh, award more applause later if they actually,

2021
01:45:55,800 --> 01:46:01,520
uh, put their, uh, enforcement where their mouth is with this and, uh, help to,

2022
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:05,160
with some of the toxicity on the Twitch environment.

2023
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:07,920
So, all right.

2024
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:18,040
Anyhow, um, black compat in chat says the N Bomb folks finally died down on our

2025
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:19,600
stream over the last few weeks.

2026
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:20,480
Thank the Lord.

2027
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:24,120
See, that's how, it just like, it makes me angry.

2028
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:30,000
Like I just, I want to, when I hear that, because I respect you guys so much, and I

2029
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,640
know you guys work so hard, like I want to know who those people are and I want to

2030
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:34,440
beat them up.

2031
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:35,280
Like I do.

2032
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:41,800
So like, but the, the best I can do on this, this Twitch platform is get the hell

2033
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:42,840
off my platform.

2034
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:47,920
If you're one of these people that go into streams and type that type of garbage,

2035
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:53,720
like it's just completely, we know, we know it's kids.

2036
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:57,320
Like 90% of the time, it's kids trying to get a rise out of somebody trying to get a

2037
01:46:57,320 --> 01:46:59,640
reaction and it's fucking gross and disgusting.

2038
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:04,800
Seriously, if only Twitch had the authority to spank these children.

2039
01:47:05,120 --> 01:47:12,320
Or more like if they had been raised to be respectful, then they wouldn't even need

2040
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:14,000
the supervision to not do that.

2041
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:18,720
You know, it's clearly a moral failing, I would say.

2042
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:22,640
And yes, pod culture, I did mean fuck them with a cheese grater dildo.

2043
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:24,840
At least the adults.

2044
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:31,000
Um, uh, no one special 77 says in short, don't be a creepy asshole on the internet.

2045
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:31,240
Yes.

2046
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:34,560
And, and you guys that are watching and viewing, we've been very fortunate that

2047
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:36,320
our community is pretty fucking awesome.

2048
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:39,120
You, you all know how to conduct yourselves.

2049
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:41,160
We don't have problems in the chat room.

2050
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:46,320
Whenever we do have problems in chat, our mods take care of it quick, you know, and

2051
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:48,040
that, and it's, you know, that's the thing.

2052
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:54,080
But also like, and Rob, we're, we're so far, the problematic people in themselves

2053
01:47:54,080 --> 01:48:00,400
out to what's that you, you cut out so far, the problematic people have thrown

2054
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:02,320
themselves out to, that is true too.

2055
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:04,600
And let's be real dark soccer.

2056
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:08,520
We are three white people sitting here doing this stream.

2057
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:11,640
We are not using the LGBT cat tag.

2058
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:13,600
So it is not obvious that I am gay.

2059
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:16,320
The two out of three of us qualify.

2060
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:19,120
It is not, it, that is not something that's there.

2061
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:23,000
So that's, you know, that's the reality.

2062
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:31,520
Like, so I'm glad at least Twitch is going to these, um, uh, uh, methods

2063
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:35,520
to basically ban this for like the, this kind of behavior is unacceptable.

2064
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:38,560
Across the board and that they're, you know, they're calling out that there

2065
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:43,080
is a problem because there is, you know, nobody's come into this chat.

2066
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:48,080
Saying those type of words, especially the one that starts with N.

2067
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:54,280
And so I, I think it's, it's just disgusting that it's happening to, um,

2068
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:58,120
two people that love the games industry that I respect so much.

2069
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:02,320
I got you, I got your back and I will fight those people if I ever see them.

2070
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:07,640
And we can cuss like a fucking sailor, but that has nothing

2071
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:09,640
to do with being hateful.

2072
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:10,120
Yeah.

2073
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:10,840
Yes.

2074
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:12,800
I can say, fuck you with a cheese grater.

2075
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:13,360
Yes.

2076
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:17,120
But I'm not going to say, fuck you with a cheese grater, insert slur here.

2077
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:21,880
But yeah, and you're not necessarily directing it at a certain individual.

2078
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:26,320
You're not going like, fuck you Rob Roberts, but you're not

2079
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:27,240
saying it here on the show.

2080
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:27,600
All right.

2081
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:29,120
Anyway, no, no.

2082
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:29,640
All right.

2083
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:30,520
Let's move on.

2084
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:36,480
I'm, I'm a good girl in public, so Rob, it's a good time next.

2085
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:37,040
Yes.

2086
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:41,120
Let's, Ooh, let's, uh, let's move on to happier times.

2087
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:45,840
We love games and let's talk about, uh, the classic game of the week.

2088
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:49,840
And we're going to take a trip down memory lane and, uh, we're going to,

2089
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:53,160
uh, have dark soccer, get into the gaming vault and she's going to find

2090
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:58,440
a game that she thinks, Hey, you kids, you should be playing this game this week.

2091
01:49:58,520 --> 01:49:59,680
Uh, it's, it's a classic.

2092
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:00,160
Maybe.

2093
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:03,240
Well, I don't, maybe this one, I don't know.

2094
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:06,720
I think you, the game you picked tonight, you literally can't play.

2095
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:09,600
Uh, well you kind of can, but not the way it was, but anyway.

2096
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,200
Um, I will say a reminder for an important reason.

2097
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:17,480
I know I was gonna say a reminder because I think it ties into this, uh, to qualify

2098
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:21,280
as a classic game of the week, it usually, unless dark soccer feels like bending

2099
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:25,800
the rules, which is very rarely a classic game of the week is 10 years or older.

2100
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:30,320
And so the rules once, and that was for halo to pay my mom's bills.

2101
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:31,600
No, no.

2102
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:33,280
Cause halo was over 10 years older than halo.

2103
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:37,480
The halo was my rule of do not do halo had it.

2104
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:38,840
It was the halo clause.

2105
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:39,520
Yes.

2106
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:39,880
Okay.

2107
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:40,280
Fair enough.

2108
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:40,880
All right.

2109
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:42,080
So dark soccer, let's get to it.

2110
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:43,200
What is the classic game of the week?

2111
01:50:44,360 --> 01:50:45,680
World of Warcraft cataclysm.

2112
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:47,080
Wow.

2113
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:51,000
I'll tell you, I've done world of Warcraft before, but I'm doing cataclysm

2114
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:57,280
because it, as an expansion, it was a complete fucking do over for world of

2115
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:57,880
Warcraft.

2116
01:50:58,200 --> 01:51:03,040
And we just had a new story earlier about how the Warcraft expansion for shadow lands

2117
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:06,440
was considered the best selling selling PC game for about four days.

2118
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:09,160
So it does, they do qualify as separate games.

2119
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:12,600
Um, you know, there's, there's another reason I'm bringing this up too.

2120
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:17,320
Cause you remember every, I played the first iteration of world of Warcraft,

2121
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:19,720
hated it, played the second one.

2122
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:20,800
It was okay.

2123
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:27,560
I played, it was basically, it wasn't until cataclysm came out that I enjoyed

2124
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:32,360
world of Warcraft and you remember my little goat girl who I still have.

2125
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:37,960
I, I, so I basically soloed her to 80.

2126
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:44,560
I didn't do a single, um, uh, dungeon or anything.

2127
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:48,640
I didn't do a single instance until after I level captor.

2128
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:53,320
And I think only one time did I ever party.

2129
01:51:53,320 --> 01:51:57,800
And it was cause one thing in that grand that I couldn't beat by myself and I want

2130
01:51:57,800 --> 01:51:59,800
to say that it was you and spike.

2131
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:02,680
Probably that sounds, sounds, sounds about right.

2132
01:52:02,680 --> 01:52:02,840
Yeah.

2133
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:09,160
Um, uh, the days of danger squad, but anyway, um, world of Warcraft was the

2134
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:13,040
third expansion that came out for world of Warcraft, it followed wrath of the

2135
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:13,600
Lich King.

2136
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:18,600
Um, it had its announcement at Blizzcon on August 21st, 2009.

2137
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:24,000
Um, although of course hackers going to hack and people figured shit out and it's

2138
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:27,320
a release date was on December 7th, 2010.

2139
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:33,960
So I am basically a just short of a week off of the release date to date.

2140
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:41,000
So, um, yeah, I kind of hit the line on that one, but at any rate, there was so

2141
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,400
much shit, by the way, I meant 85 and not 80.

2142
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:48,440
So there was a lot of change that happened with this one.

2143
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:56,360
So not only did they raise the player level cap to 85, but they completely redid

2144
01:52:56,360 --> 01:52:59,960
the two main continents because prior to cataclysm, you could not fly.

2145
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:00,680
Remember?

2146
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:01,720
Oh yeah.

2147
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:02,120
Yeah.

2148
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:04,360
Not, not in the original world.

2149
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:07,760
You said you had like certain flying capable levels.

2150
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:08,480
I think it was.

2151
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:12,000
And of course you had, you know, your, your travel points like that.

2152
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:21,400
Um, but not only, um, did this, uh, create flying areas, uh, basically I think the

2153
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:31,360
only areas that were not flyable were the two, um, uh, uh, the blood elf starting

2154
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:40,280
area and the draenei, because those were stored, um, like off the main map, which

2155
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:42,600
is funny because those two are actually stored on the same map.

2156
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:43,040
Did you know?

2157
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:47,520
I, I thought I had heard that back in the day, but I forgot.

2158
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:52,800
If you, if you boundary break it, you can travel, um, like you fly

2159
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:56,480
for a fucking long ass time, but then you end up on the other map.

2160
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:57,280
You can actually see them.

2161
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:02,920
Um, but any rate, um, it added 10 new dungeons and five new

2162
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:05,200
raids and a new skill archeology.

2163
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:08,920
I think I always did jewelcrafting cause it like gave me a lot of money.

2164
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:09,800
Um, they did.

2165
01:54:09,800 --> 01:54:10,960
I'm going to step away for a minute.

2166
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:12,080
So don't ask me any other questions.

2167
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:13,120
Okay, fine.

2168
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:17,880
Um, but they did, um, redo the glyph system to have three types of glyphs,

2169
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:20,000
which were prime major and minor.

2170
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:22,920
And they were permanently learned instead of having to have

2171
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:24,720
a reagent to remove the slot.

2172
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:31,040
Um, they added two playable races, the worgen, werewolf, werewolf people, uh,

2173
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:33,480
for the Alliance and goblins for the horde.

2174
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:37,320
I had a goblin named Gabrielle and I actually still have her.

2175
01:54:37,320 --> 01:54:38,520
If I decided to play again.

2176
01:54:39,160 --> 01:54:43,880
Um, they did expand some of the classes to be available to more of the races

2177
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:49,560
and they completely redid, well, they mostly redid Stormwind and really redid,

2178
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:52,960
I think Orgrimmar, even though I fucking hate Orgrimmar cause that place is like

2179
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:57,800
a fucking maze, um, and then they overhauled the talent system so that you

2180
01:54:57,800 --> 01:55:02,960
were awarded your first talent point at 10 and then 11 and then once, uh, per

2181
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:05,480
every two levels until you reach 80.

2182
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:10,440
And, uh, 81 through 85, you receive a talent point at each level, bringing

2183
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:15,440
your total to 41 talent points and lets you choose, um, new and

2184
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:17,560
different or improved abilities.

2185
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:24,680
Um, and to go ahead and answer you evil protagonist, I am specifically

2186
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:29,280
referring to this expansion because it pretty much revamped the whole game.

2187
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:33,120
I can almost look at this as a whole separate game with all

2188
01:55:33,120 --> 01:55:34,160
the changes that they made to it.

2189
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:40,320
Um, other, um, so basically the big thing with this game is that Deathwing, the

2190
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:45,400
Destroyer, the evil, uh, dragon thing who was originally Maltharion, the

2191
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:49,280
earthwarder, um, of the, the, the five, sorry.

2192
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:49,640
Yeah.

2193
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:55,680
Five, five aspects, um, were, uh, he went crazy and started burning shit,

2194
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:57,840
really just started burning shit.

2195
01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:04,080
Um, and he was last seen in Warcraft two.

2196
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:10,840
Um, so basically he just was wondering around, he literally was wandering around

2197
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:12,720
the continents, setting shit on fire.

2198
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:16,800
Um, and he tore through this dimensional barrier.

2199
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:20,800
So there was this huge cataclysm that reshaped everything.

2200
01:56:21,560 --> 01:56:25,000
Like, uh, there were the Twilight hammer group coming up.

2201
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:30,040
There's all kinds of just amazing lore stuff that came into the universe.

2202
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:33,760
And then of course it changed a lot of things in the

2203
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:36,280
politics of the various factions.

2204
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:40,240
Um, so Thrall who was, you know, uh, fucking love Thrall.

2205
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:42,600
He was so cool as warchief, but anyway, he stepped down.

2206
01:56:43,120 --> 01:56:50,880
Um, and this gave us, uh, Garrosh Hellscream who I hated him and, uh, I, I

2207
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:54,560
hated him forever and I hated him when he died in the books, cause I actually

2208
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:58,160
have the, the trial and everything and I hated him and everything else.

2209
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:03,280
And he's like one of my favorite characters to hate, I swear.

2210
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:12,400
Um, but anyway, um, we also had, um, the Zandalari, uh, trolls, uh, come back.

2211
01:57:12,440 --> 01:57:14,120
They were really, really cool.

2212
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:20,640
Um, we had the Firelands, which I remember how fucking long we were working through

2213
01:57:20,640 --> 01:57:24,360
the damn Firelands as our, uh, as our Guild.

2214
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:26,720
I mean, I got all kinds of screen caps and everything.

2215
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:28,680
That was the most fun I've had in that game.

2216
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:35,320
And then, um, they did, uh, the hour of Twilight, um, where one of, it

2217
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:37,640
was really such a good raid too.

2218
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:45,840
I love doing that where, um, your last battle is on Deathwing's back and you

2219
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:47,760
had to really know your shit for this one.

2220
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:49,480
It was really a lot of fun.

2221
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:56,600
Um, I mean, honestly, that one and, um, the, uh, crap.

2222
01:57:56,600 --> 01:57:57,320
Now I can't remember.

2223
01:57:57,320 --> 01:58:00,040
And I also, the one that brought in, uh, demon hunters, cause I played

2224
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:01,080
the shit out of that one too.

2225
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:02,360
Legion, I'm back.

2226
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:03,760
Legion.

2227
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:04,000
Yeah.

2228
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:07,200
Those two have been my favorite expansions ever.

2229
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:12,160
Rise of Pandaria was, eh, but these, the other two were great.

2230
01:58:12,160 --> 01:58:15,040
I, and I'll tell you what, I tried to play the Void Elf one and

2231
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:16,120
fucking, I couldn't get into it.

2232
01:58:16,120 --> 01:58:19,600
So that was probably the last time I played World of Warcraft.

2233
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:24,520
Um, but any rate, um, there was a big environmental change to it as well,

2234
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:31,480
because you had an event that was quite literally scarring the, uh, the world

2235
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:38,080
that, um, they, uh, they actually started, uh, what was they split?

2236
01:58:38,120 --> 01:58:39,040
Um, crap.

2237
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:40,320
Why can't I think of it now?

2238
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:41,120
The barons.

2239
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:41,480
Yeah.

2240
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:42,400
They split the barons.

2241
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:46,560
And for anyone who ever played in vanilla, wow.

2242
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:50,760
Barons chat was special.

2243
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:52,160
Something else.

2244
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:57,080
It was eventually the, cause you're stuck in the barons for like what?

2245
01:58:57,080 --> 01:58:58,000
40 levels.

2246
01:58:58,240 --> 01:59:02,240
Not quite that long, but a while, 30, 25, 30 levels.

2247
01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:02,680
Yeah.

2248
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:07,800
And it's some of the slowest levels to go through as well.

2249
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:14,880
Um, so this effectively put an end to the, uh, quagmire that was barons chat,

2250
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:17,800
because then they split it into the two different sides of it.

2251
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:19,880
Um, and Mary, the two shall meet.

2252
01:59:20,160 --> 01:59:22,800
And just to quickly kind of like address, like, cause a conversation is

2253
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:26,920
kind of going on in chat about, you know, this particular expansion

2254
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:28,800
being a classic game of the week.

2255
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:32,600
I think it's important, you know, to, to note some of the things that World of

2256
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:37,600
Warcraft, World of Warcraft Cataclysm did, um, it was really the first MMO

2257
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:41,640
expansion, or at least the biggest that I can think of that was really intent

2258
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:47,600
on redoing an old world so that you really couldn't revisit the old world

2259
01:59:47,640 --> 01:59:52,440
in its old form, at least until, you know, wow, classic came out way

2260
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:53,920
later, many years later, right?

2261
01:59:54,120 --> 01:59:58,240
So, um, you know, and some people may point to Final Fantasy 14, but that,

2262
01:59:58,240 --> 02:00:00,280
that redo didn't happen until a couple of years later.

2263
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:05,600
And actually, uh, now Kiyoshita said, uh, when he approached Realm Reborn,

2264
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:09,200
he was influenced by World of Warcraft Cataclysm and him and his team played

2265
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:12,880
quite a bit of it, um, in just, you know, to get, to get a sense of what's

2266
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:13,880
going on in MMOs.

2267
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:17,680
And I think a lot of what you see in Realm Reborn kind of comes from World

2268
02:00:17,680 --> 02:00:22,160
of Warcraft and, you know, part of that, the story certainly seems to have some

2269
02:00:22,160 --> 02:00:24,800
heavy, uh, parallels with World of Warcraft Cataclysm.

2270
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:27,160
So I think, I think that's part of the reason why, you know, this

2271
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:29,000
particular expansion is notable.

2272
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:33,280
Well, there's, there's still a little bit more, um, you know, like I was

2273
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:37,080
saying, flight is unavailable for the Burning Crusade levels, but, um, there

2274
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:39,120
were some other big things about this.

2275
02:00:39,200 --> 02:00:42,160
Um, and I, I did find that leveling was so much better.

2276
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:45,560
God, the thing that I hated the most from the old one in the leveling

2277
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:48,720
mechanics for having to level your individual weapons or your skills in each

2278
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:53,920
of those, I was so fucking glad when that went away, um, because to me, it

2279
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:59,680
made the game more of a grind and less fun and the stories were fun.

2280
02:00:59,680 --> 02:01:01,600
The new quests were freaking hilarious.

2281
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:08,560
Some of them were, um, and then you also had, um, uh, some better PVP, I think.

2282
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:14,880
So you had your PVP zones that, um, you could, uh, you know, participate

2283
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:16,640
in your various PVP activities.

2284
02:01:16,640 --> 02:01:20,040
But if you didn't want to, you just, you actually, there's a fairly easy

2285
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:21,240
way to steer clear of them.

2286
02:01:21,720 --> 02:01:25,440
Um, as long as you stuck to navigating your flight paths, you know?

2287
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:32,960
Um, and yes, uh, Baron's, I think Baron's chat did revive a bit in classic.

2288
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:33,920
Rob, you were playing that?

2289
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:35,560
I was, but I was Alliance.

2290
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:38,360
So I didn't see the Baron's chat when I played classic.

2291
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:42,360
Um, so I couldn't tell you, I would assume it's probably still there, but

2292
02:01:42,360 --> 02:01:46,320
it's, it's probably one of those like, LOL, we're in Baron's chat kind of

2293
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:49,200
things where it's the, the meme is self-aware now.

2294
02:01:49,480 --> 02:01:49,960
Yeah.

2295
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:53,600
So I'm not sure it's going to be quite the same as it was before.

2296
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:57,080
You probably still have your occasional Chuck Norris joke, but I think it's one

2297
02:01:57,080 --> 02:02:01,280
of those, the meme has become aware of itself and so just by nature, it's not

2298
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:01,840
what it was.

2299
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:06,720
But do you remember how fucking long it took me to get, to get stood in the fire?

2300
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:10,240
So there's a story about this.

2301
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:13,400
So, okay.

2302
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:16,320
Remember how I said Deathwing was flying around burning shit, right?

2303
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:22,200
He would set the entire instanced area that you were in completely on fire.

2304
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:23,680
Oh yeah, I remember that.

2305
02:02:24,040 --> 02:02:30,720
And three times I was in an area that got set on fire and did not die.

2306
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:33,680
And I don't know why.

2307
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:37,600
I think one of them was because I had just revived from an earlier death.

2308
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:41,880
And the other two, I think had to do like just where I was standing.

2309
02:02:41,880 --> 02:02:44,040
It was the dumbest thing ever.

2310
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:47,000
And you remember how angry I was, right?

2311
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:49,680
I'd be like, I'm in fire and I'm not on fire.

2312
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:50,560
Right?

2313
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:55,720
Like, and I would just go around, like just wandering around the entire world

2314
02:02:55,720 --> 02:02:58,240
looking for fucking Deathwing so I could get stood in the fire.

2315
02:02:58,760 --> 02:03:00,680
And then I don't even know what it was.

2316
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:02,040
I was like in...

2317
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:04,000
When you're not expecting it, it just happens.

2318
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:05,040
Cheese ball thing.

2319
02:03:05,080 --> 02:03:05,400
Yeah.

2320
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:06,960
I was, I was, I was mining.

2321
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:07,600
That was it.

2322
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:08,640
Stood in the fire.

2323
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:12,240
And then someone got the thing I was trying to mine for.

2324
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:14,800
I got it.

2325
02:03:15,160 --> 02:03:18,920
I got, I have screenshots to this day of my stood in the fire.

2326
02:03:19,400 --> 02:03:22,200
Uh, can I tell you one other little side story that, uh, your

2327
02:03:22,200 --> 02:03:23,640
pick this week made me think of?

2328
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:27,480
Um, so the fact that this game is, uh, 10 years old, right?

2329
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:29,920
Cause it came out about, uh, just about 10 years ago this week, give

2330
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:31,800
or take a week or two, a week or two.

2331
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:32,200
It did.

2332
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:32,680
Oh yeah.

2333
02:03:32,680 --> 02:03:34,360
It came out on the 7th of December.

2334
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:35,120
Oh, well, there you go.

2335
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:41,400
So, um, uh, Horde House, the side project I was doing, uh, at the beginning with

2336
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:46,000
Xtaphir and then we added more, uh, cast members later on, Shane and, uh, grandpa

2337
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,400
for, or, uh, you know, captain Matt from Starboard Power Coupling.

2338
02:03:48,720 --> 02:03:51,120
Uh, we're all part of the, uh, Horde House.

2339
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:56,640
That show started, uh, about six weeks before the Cataclysm patch.

2340
02:03:56,640 --> 02:03:57,480
No, yeah.

2341
02:03:57,480 --> 02:03:59,120
Six weeks before the expansion ish.

2342
02:03:59,120 --> 02:04:01,520
I don't remember the exact day, but I remember it was right at the end of

2343
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:04,440
Lich King, because I think in like episode four, we were talking about how

2344
02:04:04,440 --> 02:04:05,880
we finally killed the Lich King.

2345
02:04:06,040 --> 02:04:09,120
Thanks to the Cataclysm pre patch and the changes that it had made.

2346
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:15,120
Um, so it's just, so, so now Horde House qualifies as a classic podcast of the week.

2347
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:21,280
Uh, it just kind of made me stop and pause and go, Oh my gosh, that show is 10 years old.

2348
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:25,840
And we did that show for a good, probably like four years.

2349
02:04:25,880 --> 02:04:26,400
I don't know.

2350
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:26,960
I don't remember.

2351
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:32,360
Maybe three, four years until we honestly, truly, we all kind of, well,

2352
02:04:32,360 --> 02:04:34,040
most of us burned out on Warcraft.

2353
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:36,080
I think grandpa stuck with it the longest.

2354
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:39,120
Uh, and then, uh, Final Fantasy Realm Reborn came out.

2355
02:04:39,120 --> 02:04:43,600
And so we tried for a good, probably the last 20 episodes or so.

2356
02:04:43,640 --> 02:04:48,960
We really tried to make it about like all MMOs, but then at that point, the

2357
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:52,600
show was just completely losing focus and, and would be the tangent train.

2358
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:55,040
And I think everybody kind of burned out sadly.

2359
02:04:55,040 --> 02:04:57,240
And that, that's the story of, of Horde House.

2360
02:04:57,560 --> 02:05:04,040
Um, but it was a fun show brings up Leroy Jenkins, which, you know, you cannot

2361
02:05:04,040 --> 02:05:05,920
get the Jenkins achievement anymore.

2362
02:05:06,080 --> 02:05:06,760
Not anymore.

2363
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:07,480
Not anymore.

2364
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:07,800
Nope.

2365
02:05:08,240 --> 02:05:09,600
I have the Jenkins achievement.

2366
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:10,360
I'm happy.

2367
02:05:10,680 --> 02:05:13,480
I think like I got it on my demon hunter too.

2368
02:05:13,480 --> 02:05:15,440
Cause they took that out right after Legion.

2369
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:15,920
Didn't they?

2370
02:05:16,240 --> 02:05:16,560
Yeah.

2371
02:05:17,160 --> 02:05:17,440
Yeah.

2372
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:22,600
Um, but you know, one of the cool things though about Cataclysm is that afterwards

2373
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:27,400
it really did bring out now people who like to boundary break and, you know, I

2374
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:28,240
loved a boundary break.

2375
02:05:28,280 --> 02:05:30,680
Like I did the non-instant Stratholme.

2376
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:35,480
I did, uh, I got to that little hidden part just north of Stratholme.

2377
02:05:35,480 --> 02:05:40,320
Remember that had like the tower and like the place to sit and no, because it

2378
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:41,720
was blocked off for some reason.

2379
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:42,880
Yeah.

2380
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:45,920
And then, uh, and then I did a boundary.

2381
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:51,840
I would go do boundary breaks in, uh, old, uh, an old dungeons, but they, I think

2382
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:53,960
now they have them like level matched or something.

2383
02:05:54,600 --> 02:06:02,080
And then, um, I did, uh, I spent like two hours outside of the, the boundary

2384
02:06:02,080 --> 02:06:05,840
area for end of time, you know, when you're kind of in that big crater trying

2385
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:09,400
to fight, uh, the, who was the time dragon?

2386
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:11,560
Chromie?

2387
02:06:11,560 --> 02:06:11,960
I forget.

2388
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:15,800
No, not Chrome, not Chromie, uh, the other one.

2389
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:17,760
Chromie worked for him.

2390
02:06:17,800 --> 02:06:19,240
The one who was the, actually the.

2391
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:24,920
I don't remember off the top of my head and all the Warcraft, listen to the show

2392
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:28,760
or the hourglass one that was so fucking annoying.

2393
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:31,680
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

2394
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:31,960
Yeah.

2395
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:33,040
I remember that boss.

2396
02:06:33,040 --> 02:06:33,280
Yeah.

2397
02:06:34,160 --> 02:06:38,780
But anyway, and also that expansion gave me my favorite ever fight with the two

2398
02:06:38,780 --> 02:06:40,820
dragons with the fabulous flames.

2399
02:06:40,860 --> 02:06:41,460
Oh yeah.

2400
02:06:41,460 --> 02:06:42,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2401
02:06:42,860 --> 02:06:47,220
That was my favorite fight ever in an MMO.

2402
02:06:47,380 --> 02:06:49,180
I, to this day, it's my favorite.

2403
02:06:50,060 --> 02:06:53,300
Um, but at any rate, going back to the game itself, instead of, you

2404
02:06:53,300 --> 02:06:54,940
know, waxing nostalgic here.

2405
02:06:55,460 --> 02:06:59,460
Um, it was highly lauded.

2406
02:06:59,540 --> 02:07:06,700
It, it was, um, it was rated, I think 90 on Metacritic.

2407
02:07:07,220 --> 02:07:15,660
Um, nine out of 10 on IGM, uh, uh, a critic score of 9.1 out of 10 for GameSpot.

2408
02:07:15,700 --> 02:07:21,900
I mean, it just, it got so many positive reviews and they were well deserved.

2409
02:07:21,900 --> 02:07:24,420
It was a really well put together game.

2410
02:07:24,940 --> 02:07:28,620
I mean, and I've played, you know, a few MMOs in my time.

2411
02:07:28,620 --> 02:07:31,780
I mean, you know how addicted I was to Ragnarok online for like ever.

2412
02:07:32,420 --> 02:07:40,420
Um, World of Warcraft, this expansion, the Cataclysm expansion completely

2413
02:07:40,460 --> 02:07:44,220
breathed the new life into the game.

2414
02:07:44,220 --> 02:07:52,300
And I would say even into the MMO genre in general, like the fantasy RPG

2415
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:59,740
style MMO like this, that it, that the entire thing needed while I'm like,

2416
02:07:59,980 --> 02:08:01,500
okay, I'm not going to go back to World of Warcraft.

2417
02:08:01,540 --> 02:08:03,740
I'm done with World of Warcraft and I am done with it.

2418
02:08:04,100 --> 02:08:04,340
Yeah.

2419
02:08:04,500 --> 02:08:11,300
I still think that it was one of the biggest things that expanded

2420
02:08:11,700 --> 02:08:18,020
my love of, of games, because this brought me into playing more

2421
02:08:18,020 --> 02:08:20,220
adventure games of this variety.

2422
02:08:20,620 --> 02:08:23,700
I'm not an MMO person that much anymore, although I am planning

2423
02:08:23,700 --> 02:08:25,580
on going back to, to PSO too.

2424
02:08:25,580 --> 02:08:30,780
I actually quit Final Fantasy 14 without even touching my sub.

2425
02:08:31,860 --> 02:08:34,220
After two months of paying for it.

2426
02:08:34,380 --> 02:08:35,020
Oh yeah.

2427
02:08:35,020 --> 02:08:35,300
Yeah.

2428
02:08:35,340 --> 02:08:36,860
That means I'm probably not going to go back to it.

2429
02:08:37,020 --> 02:08:37,300
Yeah.

2430
02:08:37,580 --> 02:08:39,460
Um, that that's, you know, 24 bucks.

2431
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:40,780
I can't get back or 28 bucks.

2432
02:08:40,780 --> 02:08:41,460
I can't get back.

2433
02:08:41,740 --> 02:08:46,180
PSO too has that other, the, the big graphic kind of, kind of a

2434
02:08:46,180 --> 02:08:47,500
cataclysm of its own coming up.

2435
02:08:47,500 --> 02:08:50,540
I think it's a, a side game, but it's going to have the enhanced

2436
02:08:50,540 --> 02:08:51,180
graphics and everything.

2437
02:08:51,180 --> 02:08:51,940
It looks really exciting.

2438
02:08:51,940 --> 02:08:57,020
So at least with PSO too, it's a play through your, your cycle and you can be done.

2439
02:08:57,340 --> 02:08:57,580
Yeah.

2440
02:08:58,180 --> 02:09:06,540
You know, but, um, but at any rate, I think that World of Warcraft

2441
02:09:06,540 --> 02:09:13,500
Cataclysm was probably not just for what it did, but for the influence

2442
02:09:13,500 --> 02:09:16,620
that it had, like you even said for Final Fantasy 14, for so many

2443
02:09:17,100 --> 02:09:23,580
other games, it really innovated something that was just sort of dry.

2444
02:09:23,940 --> 02:09:24,100
Yeah.

2445
02:09:24,780 --> 02:09:26,180
Um, revitalizes what I meant.

2446
02:09:26,660 --> 02:09:29,100
And I wanted to say quickly, um, thank you for the kind words

2447
02:09:29,100 --> 02:09:30,940
about, um, Horde House in the chat.

2448
02:09:30,980 --> 02:09:33,140
Um, and I know some of you found OLR through that.

2449
02:09:33,140 --> 02:09:36,380
In fact, I got her, I got a really, really kind message this week, um, kind

2450
02:09:36,380 --> 02:09:39,420
of about Horde House and, and leading to OLR and somebody that's still

2451
02:09:39,420 --> 02:09:41,340
listening, um, after all this time.

2452
02:09:41,340 --> 02:09:44,500
And that's just the type of stuff that just like is all the

2453
02:09:44,500 --> 02:09:46,340
reward I need to do this show.

2454
02:09:46,700 --> 02:09:51,100
Um, but, um, my point is, uh, through that show, I got really, you know,

2455
02:09:51,100 --> 02:09:54,820
introduced to the World of Warcraft community, um, you know, and I met

2456
02:09:54,860 --> 02:09:56,420
a lot of great people through that.

2457
02:09:56,460 --> 02:09:58,660
Um, both at, you know, in real life events.

2458
02:09:58,940 --> 02:10:02,660
Like, um, when the, the time I went to BlizzCon and participated in the,

2459
02:10:02,660 --> 02:10:05,740
the podcast event that was, which I can't remember the con before the

2460
02:10:05,740 --> 02:10:09,020
storm, I think it was called or something, some, some, uh, event that

2461
02:10:09,020 --> 02:10:12,780
they had beforehand, that was a lot of fun and, uh, obviously, um, never

2462
02:10:12,780 --> 02:10:16,180
met in person, but at least worked with online, the, uh, the, the lovely

2463
02:10:16,180 --> 02:10:17,820
folks over at Girls Gone Wow.

2464
02:10:18,100 --> 02:10:20,140
Um, you know, Cyl and Raven and EJ.

2465
02:10:20,140 --> 02:10:22,860
I know, I know Cyl is no longer on that program, but she was back in

2466
02:10:22,860 --> 02:10:24,220
the days we were doing Horde House.

2467
02:10:24,260 --> 02:10:27,420
Obviously Raven and EJ have moved on to Warcraft Radio where they are,

2468
02:10:27,420 --> 02:10:30,460
they are, are doing wonderfully and it's great to see they still do it.

2469
02:10:30,740 --> 02:10:35,660
Um, but you know, my point is I met a lot of amazing like people through this.

2470
02:10:35,860 --> 02:10:40,100
And that's why it's like, I try every expansion to like, can I

2471
02:10:40,100 --> 02:10:42,180
find my love of wow again?

2472
02:10:42,180 --> 02:10:43,340
Can I, is it there?

2473
02:10:43,340 --> 02:10:50,180
Can I find, and it's, um, it's, it's, it's a, it's a time in a capsule that

2474
02:10:50,180 --> 02:10:53,980
I look back fondly on and go, we did some fun fucking things during that

2475
02:10:53,980 --> 02:10:58,140
time and I I'm really happy that it's, that it's continuing for some people.

2476
02:10:58,460 --> 02:11:00,580
Um, uh, and yeah.

2477
02:11:01,260 --> 02:11:02,020
You know what I found?

2478
02:11:02,980 --> 02:11:06,500
I remember when Slagkick and I were going to do a web comic

2479
02:11:06,500 --> 02:11:07,660
called Hillsbrad Blues.

2480
02:11:07,700 --> 02:11:08,220
Yes.

2481
02:11:08,860 --> 02:11:12,140
I found the, the one comic that I put together.

2482
02:11:12,620 --> 02:11:16,220
You know, if you really want to find something rare, find the podcast

2483
02:11:16,260 --> 02:11:18,260
that Slagkick and my husband did.

2484
02:11:18,300 --> 02:11:21,380
Yes, my husband had a podcast and it was called Fabulous Flames.

2485
02:11:21,580 --> 02:11:25,700
And I think they had six or they had like six or seven

2486
02:11:25,700 --> 02:11:27,180
episodes before they flamed out.

2487
02:11:27,380 --> 02:11:32,820
It's because, so I'm going to say something that I couldn't say like seven

2488
02:11:32,820 --> 02:11:36,540
years ago, whenever that show was on, it's because their third host was terrible.

2489
02:11:39,500 --> 02:11:43,500
No, it's, I don't even remember the guy's name, but every episode he

2490
02:11:43,500 --> 02:11:45,020
was just there to shit on the game.

2491
02:11:45,500 --> 02:11:48,180
And I, exactly.

2492
02:11:48,180 --> 02:11:51,220
It's like, I, it's, it's that difference between being

2493
02:11:51,220 --> 02:11:55,180
critical and like being hateful.

2494
02:11:55,220 --> 02:11:56,820
And, and you know what I mean?

2495
02:11:56,900 --> 02:11:58,940
Always be critical of the things that you love.

2496
02:11:58,940 --> 02:12:00,100
Cause that's how it gets better.

2497
02:12:00,180 --> 02:12:00,460
Yeah.

2498
02:12:01,180 --> 02:12:07,020
But don't, don't, you know, open world of Warcraft, put your butt

2499
02:12:07,060 --> 02:12:10,300
over the receptacle that goes into world of Warcraft and shit in it.

2500
02:12:10,620 --> 02:12:10,820
Yeah.

2501
02:12:11,260 --> 02:12:12,060
It is not your toilet.

2502
02:12:12,100 --> 02:12:12,340
Anyway.

2503
02:12:12,500 --> 02:12:12,820
All right.

2504
02:12:12,860 --> 02:12:16,140
This segment has gone on a very long time, dark soccer, and I'm going to

2505
02:12:16,140 --> 02:12:17,020
get in trouble for what I said.

2506
02:12:17,020 --> 02:12:21,540
I'm sure, uh, dark soccer, any last words on this, uh, expansion?

2507
02:12:22,540 --> 02:12:23,740
Um, I miss it.

2508
02:12:23,740 --> 02:12:25,500
I miss, I miss cataclysm.

2509
02:12:25,820 --> 02:12:25,980
Yeah.

2510
02:12:26,020 --> 02:12:30,020
I want to take, if I could take my demon hunter into cataclysm and just play that

2511
02:12:30,020 --> 02:12:32,060
forever, I'd be fucking happy.

2512
02:12:32,060 --> 02:12:33,260
It would be my new animal crossing.

2513
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:38,740
You never know a world of Warcraft classic may end up, you know, rumor is

2514
02:12:38,740 --> 02:12:41,700
they may go to burning crusade and Lich King, and then maybe stop there.

2515
02:12:41,700 --> 02:12:46,060
Cause what, what cataclysm is for you cat a Lich King is for a lot of people,

2516
02:12:46,220 --> 02:12:49,700
but you never know, uh, if there's demand for it, who knows what may happen.

2517
02:12:49,820 --> 02:12:50,420
Never say never.

2518
02:12:50,780 --> 02:12:51,900
We never thought we'd get a classic.

2519
02:12:51,900 --> 02:12:52,100
Wow.

2520
02:12:52,460 --> 02:12:52,780
We did.

2521
02:12:52,860 --> 02:12:56,300
Actually, you know, the other good thing that came out of me playing a cataclysm.

2522
02:12:57,340 --> 02:12:58,740
Rebecca black, my paladin.

2523
02:12:59,380 --> 02:12:59,940
All right.

2524
02:13:00,220 --> 02:13:02,580
We're definitely going back to the show now.

2525
02:13:02,700 --> 02:13:03,340
So there it is.

2526
02:13:03,900 --> 02:13:06,700
Your classic game of the week, world of Warcraft cataclysm.

2527
02:13:07,540 --> 02:13:07,940
All right.

2528
02:13:08,260 --> 02:13:10,740
I just looked at the time we're running really long tonight.

2529
02:13:10,740 --> 02:13:11,940
Well, we got a late start, but that's all right.

2530
02:13:12,220 --> 02:13:16,020
Uh, so let's, let's, uh, let's go right on into our next

2531
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:18,500
segment, some rapid fire news and we'll start off with Loki.

2532
02:13:21,180 --> 02:13:21,860
All right.

2533
02:13:21,860 --> 02:13:23,980
So it is not a surprise.

2534
02:13:23,980 --> 02:13:28,780
More, uh, gaming series are coming to Netflix and other streaming services.

2535
02:13:29,180 --> 02:13:32,140
So now Netflix has announced that they're going to be doing

2536
02:13:32,140 --> 02:13:34,500
a Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon.

2537
02:13:34,980 --> 02:13:42,060
So that's set to air in 2022, but, um, not a, not a huge surprise there.

2538
02:13:42,100 --> 02:13:43,660
Lots of gaming stuff coming.

2539
02:13:44,340 --> 02:13:49,700
And then, um, what's kind of cool is Spider-Man Miles Morales on PlayStation

2540
02:13:49,700 --> 02:13:56,180
five was kind of, um, you had basically two options, either a, you could choose

2541
02:13:56,180 --> 02:14:01,300
a 60 FPS version of the game, or you could play the game with Ray tracing on.

2542
02:14:01,300 --> 02:14:05,300
Well, now they have a performance Ray tracing visual mode that you can enable.

2543
02:14:05,620 --> 02:14:08,340
To play with Ray tracing at 60 FPS.

2544
02:14:08,420 --> 02:14:13,620
However, the trade-off is that the scene resolution will be reduced slightly.

2545
02:14:14,060 --> 02:14:17,140
So interesting to see that that's a thing now because definitely

2546
02:14:17,140 --> 02:14:18,540
60 FPS is the way to go.

2547
02:14:18,540 --> 02:14:20,740
But retracing does look pretty nice.

2548
02:14:22,420 --> 02:14:22,860
All right.

2549
02:14:23,460 --> 02:14:26,740
Uh, let's talk about Prince of Persia, the sands of time.

2550
02:14:26,740 --> 02:14:29,300
You know, there was a remake that was going to be happening for that game.

2551
02:14:29,620 --> 02:14:32,020
Uh, and it just got bumped back a little bit.

2552
02:14:32,020 --> 02:14:34,540
This game was originally going to come out January of 2021.

2553
02:14:34,740 --> 02:14:38,460
It's been bumped back to March, which honestly isn't that much of a bump back.

2554
02:14:38,660 --> 02:14:41,700
Um, it's not that bad, but it is news.

2555
02:14:41,740 --> 02:14:44,620
It was delayed that these things happen, but I'm sure it'll

2556
02:14:44,620 --> 02:14:45,940
be cool once it is released.

2557
02:14:46,180 --> 02:14:49,540
Uh, it is coming out on PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC as a reminder,

2558
02:14:49,540 --> 02:14:53,500
this is an upgrade of the original 2003 version from the game cube,

2559
02:14:53,500 --> 02:14:58,020
PlayStation two, Xbox, PC, and Game Boy advance, although I think this,

2560
02:14:58,020 --> 02:15:01,300
uh, remake will take less cues from the Game Boy advance version.

2561
02:15:01,540 --> 02:15:05,180
It's all, it's a complete remake of the Game Boy advance game only.

2562
02:15:06,260 --> 02:15:07,780
Uh, speaking of delays.

2563
02:15:07,940 --> 02:15:09,580
Windjammers 2.

2564
02:15:09,940 --> 02:15:13,820
I know some of you are really, uh, loving your Windjammers.

2565
02:15:13,820 --> 02:15:17,900
And I'm sad to say that Windjammers 2 is going to be bumped back to 2021.

2566
02:15:17,900 --> 02:15:21,220
It was supposed to release this year, but it's getting bumped back.

2567
02:15:21,260 --> 02:15:22,340
And come on.

2568
02:15:22,380 --> 02:15:23,300
Are we surprised?

2569
02:15:23,380 --> 02:15:23,940
I doubt it.

2570
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:26,340
Delays happen, especially this year.

2571
02:15:26,500 --> 02:15:32,140
So, uh, a variety of delays, meaning like, uh, online mode is some of the stuff,

2572
02:15:32,180 --> 02:15:34,780
uh, the rollback and online mode needs to be tweaked.

2573
02:15:35,020 --> 02:15:36,460
So they're looking at that stuff.

2574
02:15:36,460 --> 02:15:39,740
They're not saying exactly when they're just saying 2021.

2575
02:15:40,140 --> 02:15:43,340
And it's probably best, you know, especially, you know what, especially

2576
02:15:43,340 --> 02:15:46,020
when it comes to the online play and that stuff, take the time to get it right.

2577
02:15:46,300 --> 02:15:48,540
You know, you, you don't want to launch launch week and have

2578
02:15:48,540 --> 02:15:49,540
all that stuff be botched.

2579
02:15:49,780 --> 02:15:51,620
So, uh, best of luck to that team.

2580
02:15:52,100 --> 02:15:52,580
Dark Saga.

2581
02:15:54,140 --> 02:15:58,780
Well, um, something coming to the switch this month on December 21st,

2582
02:15:59,220 --> 02:16:04,940
um, is a game that came out in 2012 originally, uh, Double Dragon neon.

2583
02:16:05,220 --> 02:16:09,380
Um, it's going to be in the eShop published by Majestico, um, and of

2584
02:16:09,380 --> 02:16:10,620
course developed by WayForward.

2585
02:16:11,100 --> 02:16:15,420
Um, but yeah, it first came out, um, on the PS3 and Xbox 360 in September,

2586
02:16:15,420 --> 02:16:18,420
2012, and then on Steam in 2014.

2587
02:16:19,020 --> 02:16:26,740
So, uh, yeah, Double Dragon neon and then, um, ah, happiness, um, Scott

2588
02:16:26,740 --> 02:16:32,380
Pilgrim versus the world, the game complete edition coming out January 2021.

2589
02:16:32,860 --> 02:16:35,980
Um, and that was announced by, uh, Ubisoft.

2590
02:16:35,980 --> 02:16:39,900
It's going to be on PlayStation four, Xbox one, Nintendo switch and Stadia.

2591
02:16:40,260 --> 02:16:44,620
It's going to include Scott Pilgrim versus the world, the game, and then,

2592
02:16:44,660 --> 02:16:48,460
uh, the DLC Knives Chow and Wallace Wells add on packs.

2593
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:50,060
So there you go.

2594
02:16:50,300 --> 02:16:50,660
Nice.

2595
02:16:50,660 --> 02:16:54,500
And how, how convenient with Prince of Persia moving out of the way in January.

2596
02:16:54,500 --> 02:16:57,140
Now, now Ubisoft can just drop Scott Pilgrim in there instead.

2597
02:16:57,620 --> 02:16:59,420
I know a lot of people excited to see that come back.

2598
02:17:00,260 --> 02:17:03,700
And if there's, uh, Oh God, why can't I think of it?

2599
02:17:03,700 --> 02:17:08,300
Who does the, um, the limited run if limited run does, uh, uh, physical

2600
02:17:08,300 --> 02:17:09,660
version of this, I'm buying it.

2601
02:17:10,420 --> 02:17:14,380
Uh, Sia Tabiri in chat says originally that game came out in 2010 as well.

2602
02:17:14,420 --> 02:17:16,740
Did I, yeah, I guess the movie's about 10 years old.

2603
02:17:16,740 --> 02:17:21,380
Cause they had the, I think the 10 year Blu-ray edition was either this, I feel

2604
02:17:21,380 --> 02:17:23,380
like it was last year recording.

2605
02:17:23,380 --> 02:17:23,860
I think.

2606
02:17:24,340 --> 02:17:25,020
Didn't that happen?

2607
02:17:25,020 --> 02:17:26,980
The cast redoing maybe.

2608
02:17:27,020 --> 02:17:28,220
Yeah, I can't, I can't remember.

2609
02:17:28,380 --> 02:17:32,940
I know we did a screening of it here in SAC, uh, was that 2018?

2610
02:17:32,940 --> 02:17:36,460
Couple of years ago, we did a nice big screen, uh, cult movie night.

2611
02:17:36,460 --> 02:17:37,780
We had a, we had a double feature.

2612
02:17:37,780 --> 02:17:39,020
It was that in Kung Fury.

2613
02:17:39,500 --> 02:17:45,220
Um, and we actually, we had the guy that played Thor in Kung Fury was there.

2614
02:17:45,220 --> 02:17:49,380
And so I got to, some of the perks about my hosting thing is that once in a while

2615
02:17:49,380 --> 02:17:52,100
I get to interview the celebrity on stage and take audience questions, kind of like

2616
02:17:52,100 --> 02:17:53,900
running a panel, but before a movie.

2617
02:17:54,700 --> 02:17:58,980
But in this day, I still actually have the Kung Fury soundtrack in my, uh, uh,

2618
02:17:58,980 --> 02:17:59,500
playlist.

2619
02:17:59,620 --> 02:18:01,020
It was a good movie and it was a fun night.

2620
02:18:01,020 --> 02:18:01,980
That was a real fun night.

2621
02:18:02,060 --> 02:18:05,820
Oh, those are some good, you know, uh, retro new wave there.

2622
02:18:06,220 --> 02:18:08,740
But you know, what's really upsetting, speaking of all that hosting stuff and

2623
02:18:08,740 --> 02:18:14,540
panel, you know, what's really upsetting is that I was supposed to in June do

2624
02:18:14,580 --> 02:18:17,580
clue the movie and we were going to, and you guys know, that's my favorite movie

2625
02:18:17,580 --> 02:18:18,100
of all time.

2626
02:18:18,500 --> 02:18:22,620
We were going to have Leslie Ann Warren in person and I was going to get to do the

2627
02:18:22,620 --> 02:18:24,580
interviewing, uh, for all that.

2628
02:18:24,580 --> 02:18:26,980
And, uh, thanks, COVID.

2629
02:18:27,220 --> 02:18:29,100
No, I was actually cast as Mr.

2630
02:18:29,100 --> 02:18:29,500
Green.

2631
02:18:29,540 --> 02:18:33,100
I decided that the drag up and all that was going to be too much work.

2632
02:18:33,140 --> 02:18:38,500
And there was a, it was fun, but, um, what, you know, it's time to let other people

2633
02:18:38,500 --> 02:18:40,020
do, and I will have fun with Mr.

2634
02:18:40,020 --> 02:18:42,060
Green, um, assuming I get to do it.

2635
02:18:42,060 --> 02:18:44,860
Cause I think they're trying to reschedule it for 2021.

2636
02:18:44,860 --> 02:18:47,980
I think they actually have a date, whether we'll actually get to do it or not.

2637
02:18:47,980 --> 02:18:52,780
I mean, just depends on what's going on in the world, but, uh, I was really bummed

2638
02:18:52,780 --> 02:18:53,580
about that one.

2639
02:18:53,620 --> 02:18:57,220
I mean, I'm very, not to get too tangenty, sorry, especially when we're running

2640
02:18:57,220 --> 02:19:01,020
along already, but you know, doing the Rocky horror stuff and the cult movie

2641
02:19:01,020 --> 02:19:06,060
hosting for years, I was fortunate enough to do a panel, um, a couple years ago at

2642
02:19:06,060 --> 02:19:07,820
one at a convention here in Sacramento.

2643
02:19:07,820 --> 02:19:13,100
And on that panel was Barry Bostwick, who played Brad, um, little Nell, who played,

2644
02:19:13,340 --> 02:19:16,220
I'm sorry, I almost said Magenta, little Nell, who played Columbia and Patricia

2645
02:19:16,220 --> 02:19:18,500
Quinn, who played, uh, Magenta.

2646
02:19:18,620 --> 02:19:23,420
So I got to do a Q and a with three fucking icons.

2647
02:19:23,460 --> 02:19:29,460
And that was like the day I was like, if Lady Patricia Quinn, if they, Oh yes,

2648
02:19:29,460 --> 02:19:29,740
sorry.

2649
02:19:29,740 --> 02:19:30,700
Yes, I'm very sorry.

2650
02:19:31,700 --> 02:19:36,260
If all of my opportunities disappeared tomorrow, I will have still made it.

2651
02:19:36,700 --> 02:19:39,700
I will have done the thing that I don't know if it can ever be topped.

2652
02:19:40,420 --> 02:19:45,140
So anyway, just a little aside, but it was a very exciting thing for me personally.

2653
02:19:45,140 --> 02:19:46,780
So, all right.

2654
02:19:46,860 --> 02:19:50,540
Uh, moving on, uh, let's travel around the world and check out some release

2655
02:19:50,540 --> 02:19:51,180
dates.

2656
02:19:51,380 --> 02:19:52,580
What's coming out this week.

2657
02:19:52,580 --> 02:19:55,140
Loki, not a whole lot of stuff.

2658
02:19:55,180 --> 02:20:00,780
Um, so we have collection of saga, final fantasy legend on Nintendo switch, uh,

2659
02:20:00,820 --> 02:20:07,540
MX GP 2020 on PC PlayStation four and X-Box one demo reborn on

2660
02:20:07,540 --> 02:20:09,540
Nintendo switch, iOS and Android.

2661
02:20:10,340 --> 02:20:16,180
Uh, it looks like a me sheets do no sacrifice on PC and into the switch and

2662
02:20:16,180 --> 02:20:19,300
the Tonia reverse on PlayStation five.

2663
02:20:19,340 --> 02:20:19,780
That's it.

2664
02:20:20,780 --> 02:20:22,740
It's finally starting to slow down a little bit, huh?

2665
02:20:23,580 --> 02:20:24,460
Yeah.

2666
02:20:24,860 --> 02:20:25,140
All right.

2667
02:20:25,140 --> 02:20:27,300
Heading over to Japan and looking at the releases there.

2668
02:20:27,300 --> 02:20:30,580
We still have a few things on the switch this week, including kaleidoscope of

2669
02:20:30,580 --> 02:20:36,700
phantasm prison is out this week on the switch, yokai watch jam, yokai academy Y.

2670
02:20:36,700 --> 02:20:39,460
And I thought those games were on their way out, but I guess we have the

2671
02:20:39,500 --> 02:20:40,900
kind of side game that's coming out.

2672
02:20:41,180 --> 02:20:46,180
Um, the Rayo's work is never done in a regular and limited edition and watch

2674
02:20:51,900 --> 02:20:56,380

2675
02:20:56,620 --> 02:21:00,180
Uh, children of Morta is another big release on the switch this week.

2676
02:21:00,300 --> 02:21:04,780
We have a lot of releases this week in Japan, uh, no SIA and family trainer

2677
02:21:04,820 --> 02:21:06,900
also out this week in Japan.

2678
02:21:07,180 --> 02:21:08,660
Taking a look, I could train my family.

2679
02:21:08,900 --> 02:21:12,380
Uh, PlayStation five has a couple of releases this week in Japan, man eater

2680
02:21:12,380 --> 02:21:18,140
and overcooked all you can eat edition and go go five GGN game Neptune reverse

in regular and limited edition that coming from compile heart.

2682
02:21:22,940 --> 02:21:25,860
So those are some PlayStation five releases quickly looking at the PlayStation

2683
02:21:25,860 --> 02:21:28,500
four to see if anything different jumps out there.

2684
02:21:28,700 --> 02:21:29,940
That's a lot of gogo five.

2685
02:21:30,220 --> 02:21:32,500
That's the Sentai game, right?

2686
02:21:33,420 --> 02:21:34,420
Um, I'm not sure.

2687
02:21:34,420 --> 02:21:34,980
I was just sorry.

2688
02:21:34,980 --> 02:21:36,780
I w I went to PlayStation four for a minute.

2689
02:21:37,460 --> 02:21:40,780
Most of the same stuff on the switch is on the PlayStation four this week.

2690
02:21:41,100 --> 02:21:42,860
Uh, let me look.

2691
02:21:42,940 --> 02:21:44,620
Um, yeah.

2692
02:21:44,700 --> 02:21:46,340
Uh, Kiku Sentai go go five.

2693
02:21:46,860 --> 02:21:47,340
Is that it?

2694
02:21:48,460 --> 02:21:50,660
It's just like an old though.

2695
02:21:50,700 --> 02:21:53,580
Um, Sentai Syria will old by a couple of years.

2696
02:21:53,620 --> 02:21:56,700
It might be because a different world protected by four goddesses.

2697
02:21:56,940 --> 02:21:58,260
They fought for world supremacy.

2698
02:21:58,300 --> 02:21:58,500
Okay.

2699
02:21:58,500 --> 02:21:58,900
Nevermind.

2700
02:21:58,900 --> 02:22:00,180
That's a, that's the game.

2701
02:22:00,180 --> 02:22:01,260
Neptunia reverse.

2702
02:22:01,260 --> 02:22:04,020
The one I just talked about Japanese.

2703
02:22:04,580 --> 02:22:04,940
All right.

2704
02:22:04,980 --> 02:22:10,940
I was just like, why are they doing a game on like such a two year old Sentai series?

2705
02:22:11,380 --> 02:22:11,700
Yeah.

2706
02:22:12,620 --> 02:22:13,060
Okay.

2707
02:22:13,340 --> 02:22:13,700
Thank you.

2708
02:22:13,700 --> 02:22:14,020
I'm sorry.

2709
02:22:14,020 --> 02:22:14,740
I was confused.

2710
02:22:15,060 --> 02:22:15,380
All right.

2711
02:22:15,380 --> 02:22:16,180
We got it figured out.

2712
02:22:16,540 --> 02:22:16,860
All right.

2713
02:22:16,860 --> 02:22:18,140
That's it for a, how about the UK?

2714
02:22:19,100 --> 02:22:22,060
Two games on the 15th for PlayStation and switch.

2715
02:22:22,060 --> 02:22:24,820
We have five nights at Freddy's, uh, help wanted.

2716
02:22:25,580 --> 02:22:30,780
And speaking of old stuff, and then on the 18th, uh, Anima arcade edition.

2717
02:22:32,940 --> 02:22:34,020
That's it on PlayStation.

2718
02:22:35,700 --> 02:22:36,460
All right.

2719
02:22:36,460 --> 02:22:39,180
Let's get into some more news and we'll start with Loki.

2720
02:22:40,020 --> 02:22:40,620
All right.

2721
02:22:40,620 --> 02:22:45,980
So this isn't exactly like break, you know, big, I mean, it's big news, but

2722
02:22:45,980 --> 02:22:52,260
it's not unprecedented because GameStop has been closing stores, uh, quite often

2723
02:22:52,260 --> 02:22:56,820
actually over the last few years as their profits have kind of dropped a little bit.

2724
02:22:57,220 --> 02:23:04,020
Uh, apparently, you know, they had a 30% drop in profits during the same

2725
02:23:04,060 --> 02:23:09,540
period last year, so, um, their fourth quarter ending October 31st.

2726
02:23:09,700 --> 02:23:15,300
And, um, apparently the last course, obviously, because of COVID situation,

2727
02:23:15,300 --> 02:23:19,940
having the closed source, um, during that time period, they're also seeing

2728
02:23:19,940 --> 02:23:24,980
though that they're seeing an increase in profits of 16.5%, uh, comparable

2729
02:23:24,980 --> 02:23:27,860
month to month forum, uh, Thanksgiving.

2730
02:23:27,940 --> 02:23:34,780
And, um, the over last year, because even still with COVID, uh, and having

2731
02:23:34,780 --> 02:23:38,820
to have their stores closed on, despite having their stores closed on

2732
02:23:38,820 --> 02:23:42,580
Thanksgiving, obviously a lot of people are staying home, a lot of, you know,

2733
02:23:42,580 --> 02:23:46,420
new console launch, so a lot of sales are going up because of that, even

2734
02:23:46,420 --> 02:23:51,300
still though, they're looking at closing around a thousand retail stores by the

2735
02:23:51,300 --> 02:23:54,740
end of 2021, and I think that also includes the stores that have been

2736
02:23:54,740 --> 02:23:56,340
previously closed over the last few years.

2737
02:23:56,340 --> 02:24:01,780
So they've had, you know, 462 years that are closed over, uh, 462 stores

2738
02:24:01,780 --> 02:24:08,020
that are closed this year and last year there was like 321, uh, stores.

2739
02:24:08,620 --> 02:24:13,220
Um, so I think they'll bring that total up to a thousand, but that's

2740
02:24:13,220 --> 02:24:14,540
still, that's a lot of stores.

2741
02:24:14,540 --> 02:24:18,260
I know the local store we had over here is closed down, but I mean, to be

2742
02:24:18,260 --> 02:24:22,260
honest, they had a lot of, um, a lot of these duplicate locations that they

2743
02:24:22,260 --> 02:24:27,060
kind of took on as they acquire, you know, even years ago, you know, with,

2744
02:24:27,060 --> 02:24:31,460
uh, fungal land that in, um, EB games and stuff like that, there's a lot of,

2745
02:24:31,500 --> 02:24:33,060
it was really tightly packed.

2746
02:24:33,060 --> 02:24:33,220
Yeah.

2747
02:24:33,220 --> 02:24:36,900
I probably didn't need as many, you know, footprints out there.

2748
02:24:36,940 --> 02:24:41,380
I remember over by sunrise mall, had they, there was one in the mall and

2749
02:24:41,380 --> 02:24:42,740
there was the one across the street.

2750
02:24:43,300 --> 02:24:46,660
So I think only the, I think they closed the one in the mall, if I'm not mistaken.

2751
02:24:47,140 --> 02:24:47,740
They did.

2752
02:24:47,740 --> 02:24:48,100
Yeah.

2753
02:24:48,100 --> 02:24:53,700
So the one that sunrise mall has set, sorry, local job that that place is sad.

2754
02:24:53,700 --> 02:24:55,820
I mean, it was already that way before the pandemic.

2755
02:24:55,860 --> 02:24:58,660
They've already, they already have plans to tear it down and they're

2756
02:24:58,660 --> 02:25:03,580
going to put some housing and they're also putting like a new shopping

2757
02:25:03,580 --> 02:25:05,420
center type open mall type thing.

2758
02:25:05,620 --> 02:25:06,820
They're tearing it down.

2759
02:25:07,820 --> 02:25:08,140
Yeah.

2760
02:25:08,140 --> 02:25:10,660
I didn't know that like a downtown Plaza type thing.

2761
02:25:10,700 --> 02:25:11,340
Holy shit.

2762
02:25:12,020 --> 02:25:13,860
It's not supposed to happen for like five years though.

2763
02:25:13,860 --> 02:25:18,580
So, but eventually they're going to tear it down and rebuild with, um, like.

2764
02:25:19,060 --> 02:25:20,780
That was my childhood.

2765
02:25:20,780 --> 02:25:24,580
Yo, my NES came from that Sears at sunrise mall.

2766
02:25:24,700 --> 02:25:26,980
I play station two came from that GameStop.

2767
02:25:27,500 --> 02:25:30,140
My super nest came from the Montgomery ward across the

2768
02:25:30,140 --> 02:25:30,620
street.

2769
02:25:30,620 --> 02:25:31,700
That's now a target.

2770
02:25:33,220 --> 02:25:34,220
Sunrise mall though.

2771
02:25:34,220 --> 02:25:38,420
Just got so sad that, that, that location though, has been very good

2772
02:25:38,420 --> 02:25:39,300
to me when it comes to gaming.

2773
02:25:39,300 --> 02:25:41,860
Now that I think about it, because that was the target that my X series X

2774
02:25:41,860 --> 02:25:43,540
came from that was able to get in online.

2775
02:25:43,980 --> 02:25:46,900
Uh, and then my, that was the one where we all waited for the week.

2776
02:25:47,260 --> 02:25:47,780
Remember that?

2777
02:25:48,020 --> 02:25:50,260
Well, I didn't wait, but the rest of it was the one.

2778
02:25:51,420 --> 02:25:51,620
Yeah.

2779
02:25:51,620 --> 02:25:55,780
That target there used to be a Montgomery ward there back in the day.

2780
02:25:55,980 --> 02:25:57,300
They tore it down and built the target.

2781
02:25:58,100 --> 02:26:00,340
So that's bird cage.

2782
02:26:00,500 --> 02:26:00,700
Yeah.

2783
02:26:00,700 --> 02:26:01,060
Bird cage.

2784
02:26:01,860 --> 02:26:02,380
Yeah.

2785
02:26:02,660 --> 02:26:04,420
So, um, sorry.

2786
02:26:04,420 --> 02:26:05,620
Local chat, local chat.

2787
02:26:06,380 --> 02:26:06,620
Yeah.

2788
02:26:06,620 --> 02:26:09,340
So, so they are, they are eventually tearing it down.

2789
02:26:09,340 --> 02:26:12,340
I don't know how quickly that's going to happen, but they've had the plans for a

2790
02:26:12,340 --> 02:26:17,460
while now, um, you know, it kind of sucks that they're still putting out more

2791
02:26:17,460 --> 02:26:22,860
housing there, but, um, it's supposed to be like some new, like open air mall

2792
02:26:22,860 --> 02:26:26,340
type thing where they've got, you know, you're still going to have the big

2793
02:26:26,340 --> 02:26:31,940
stores, like, you know, the JC penny and Macy's and stuff like that are

2794
02:26:31,940 --> 02:26:34,220
going to still be there, but they're going to have, like, it's going to be

2795
02:26:34,220 --> 02:26:36,140
like kind of an open air mall or something.

2796
02:26:36,380 --> 02:26:40,020
The way I see it is like kind of what the downtown Plaza was, but.

2797
02:26:41,020 --> 02:26:42,780
So basically it's five years away.

2798
02:26:42,780 --> 02:26:44,260
They're turning it into the bird cage.

2799
02:26:45,700 --> 02:26:46,100
Yeah.

2800
02:26:46,260 --> 02:26:46,820
That's sort of it.

2801
02:26:47,260 --> 02:26:48,860
Local chats that we got to get past local chat.

2802
02:26:48,860 --> 02:26:49,940
We're running along as it is.

2803
02:26:49,940 --> 02:26:51,140
Sorry guys who don't live here.

2804
02:26:52,460 --> 02:26:52,980
All right.

2805
02:26:53,340 --> 02:26:53,900
Uh, okay.

2806
02:26:53,900 --> 02:26:54,540
Let me move on.

2807
02:26:54,540 --> 02:26:57,660
Let's talk about the changes to the Xbox family app.

2808
02:26:57,900 --> 02:27:01,980
So, um, Microsoft is, uh, building some interesting new things into their app.

2809
02:27:01,980 --> 02:27:05,980
And I got to say, you know, even though I don't have a need to do family management,

2810
02:27:06,300 --> 02:27:07,580
uh, I think this is neat.

2811
02:27:07,580 --> 02:27:12,140
I'd be very curious for, um, Loki's take on this since, um, you know, he has kids

2812
02:27:12,140 --> 02:27:14,220
who are getting to that age where they're playing a lot of video games.

2813
02:27:14,620 --> 02:27:19,020
Um, but Microsoft is basically giving, uh, parents ways to monitor their children's

2814
02:27:19,020 --> 02:27:21,340
gaming, including, uh, on this app.

2815
02:27:21,660 --> 02:27:24,380
Uh, the, it's the Xbox family settings app.

2816
02:27:24,540 --> 02:27:30,460
You can go in and one new thing you can now do, you can block the screen time, even

2817
02:27:30,460 --> 02:27:32,580
if they haven't reached their limit yet, basically.

2818
02:27:32,740 --> 02:27:36,620
So if you say, you know, let's say, you know, the kids getting grounded or

2819
02:27:36,620 --> 02:27:40,460
something and time is up right now, you can hit a button and a message pops up on

2820
02:27:40,460 --> 02:27:40,860
screen.

2821
02:27:40,860 --> 02:27:43,020
Your time is up and, uh, that's it.

2822
02:27:43,020 --> 02:27:44,220
No more Xbox thing for them.

2823
02:27:44,540 --> 02:27:49,740
Uh, there's also a new feature where, uh, you can do ask to buy it's already on the

2824
02:27:49,740 --> 02:27:52,540
console, but now it goes into the app as well.

2825
02:27:52,620 --> 02:27:56,860
So basically if a kid says, I want to buy this, then you can review that in the app

2826
02:27:56,860 --> 02:27:58,940
and, you know, allow or lecture.

2827
02:27:59,020 --> 02:28:00,620
And I have experience with that.

2828
02:28:00,620 --> 02:28:03,900
So, uh, yeah, you can do that on PC already.

2829
02:28:04,540 --> 02:28:09,900
So like, um, I think though the problem, I was having so many problems with my son

2830
02:28:09,900 --> 02:28:12,540
being able to friend, like even my other son.

2831
02:28:12,860 --> 02:28:17,740
So I had to like, I think remove a lot of those restrictions, but basically he, if

2832
02:28:17,740 --> 02:28:20,940
like he wanted to buy something, it would send me an email saying he wants to buy it

2833
02:28:20,940 --> 02:28:22,140
and then I could approve it or not.

2834
02:28:22,700 --> 02:28:26,300
Um, but yeah, I mean, that's cool that they have that.

2835
02:28:26,700 --> 02:28:26,940
Yeah.

2836
02:28:28,700 --> 02:28:30,700
Um, all right, let's move on dark Sakura.

2837
02:28:31,420 --> 02:28:35,740
Well, um, for, I have lots of friends.

2838
02:28:35,740 --> 02:28:40,940
I know a lot of our listeners like to, uh, uh, get these vinyl soundtracks now that

2839
02:28:40,940 --> 02:28:43,500
we're seeing a big surgeons and having them released.

2840
02:28:43,820 --> 02:28:48,780
Well, the newest one, um, coming out is the ActRaiser soundtrack, and it's going

2841
02:28:48,780 --> 02:28:49,740
to be reissued.

2842
02:28:50,300 --> 02:28:55,020
Um, it had been, um, uh, out of print since 1991.

2843
02:28:55,740 --> 02:29:01,580
And so this new release is going to have additional tracks and a symphonic suite.

2844
02:29:02,140 --> 02:29:04,540
Um, and of course, you know, who worked on ActRaiser?

2845
02:29:04,540 --> 02:29:05,820
That was Yuzo Koshiro.

2846
02:29:05,820 --> 02:29:06,540
It sure was.

2847
02:29:07,500 --> 02:29:17,980
Yas, who is one of, I would say among the best sound designers for a video game ever.

2848
02:29:17,980 --> 02:29:20,060
Music, music creators for a video game.

2849
02:29:20,620 --> 02:29:28,940
Um, so it is going to be the, the vinyl is quote divine marble blue has illustrated

2850
02:29:28,940 --> 02:29:35,020
sleeves and both, uh, both versions of it that are coming out, whether or not it's

2851
02:29:35,020 --> 02:29:36,460
a vinyl or on CD.

2852
02:29:37,180 --> 02:29:41,980
Um, we'll have an eight page booklet with comments from Yuzo Koshiro, Yusuke

2853
02:29:41,980 --> 02:29:45,660
Chihada and, uh, Nijahachi Haneda.

2854
02:29:45,980 --> 02:29:52,140
Um, and then, uh, some other bonuses from, uh, I'm sorry.

2855
02:29:52,140 --> 02:29:56,300
Some other bonuses are going to be some of the original illustrations done

2856
02:29:56,300 --> 02:29:59,660
specifically for the soundtrack by, um, Ayano Koshiro.

2857
02:30:00,220 --> 02:30:05,900
Um, it is going to be, I'm trying to get the release date.

2858
02:30:05,900 --> 02:30:13,260
So the, um, the vinyl ships on March, 2021, CD January, 2021.

2859
02:30:14,060 --> 02:30:20,620
Um, uh, I don't see anything about the, uh, you can order it internationally.

2860
02:30:20,620 --> 02:30:25,500
It's on the WAIO, uh, um, international store.

2861
02:30:25,500 --> 02:30:33,580
That's W A Y O records.com slash E N um, where amongst some of the other ones

2862
02:30:33,580 --> 02:30:40,860
they have on there is, uh, some, uh, Uematsu, uh, original recordings, um,

2863
02:30:42,540 --> 02:30:45,420
and some Sega soundtracks and through the goods.

2864
02:30:45,420 --> 02:30:48,060
I think one of them is like the Street to Raise soundtrack, some more Yuzo

2865
02:30:48,060 --> 02:30:51,340
Koshiro, and you can also get a Chrono Cross music box there.

2866
02:30:53,420 --> 02:30:54,060
Wow.

2867
02:30:54,060 --> 02:30:55,980
I love the music in Actraiser.

2868
02:30:55,980 --> 02:30:59,340
So, um, I wish I was more into vinyl collecting and that type of stuff.

2869
02:30:59,340 --> 02:31:01,900
So I, I, I bought one, Rob.

2870
02:31:02,300 --> 02:31:05,660
I bought one vinyl and that was ABBA's the visitor's album.

2871
02:31:05,660 --> 02:31:07,900
And I don't even own a record player, but I just wanted it.

2872
02:31:07,900 --> 02:31:09,340
Bought you an ABBA record.

2873
02:31:09,340 --> 02:31:10,940
And I don't know if I've given it to you yet.

2874
02:31:10,940 --> 02:31:11,580
That's right.

2875
02:31:11,580 --> 02:31:12,220
No, you did.

2876
02:31:12,220 --> 02:31:14,300
I got you the other album.

2877
02:31:14,300 --> 02:31:16,300
I, uh, it's, it's over there with the other.

2878
02:31:16,300 --> 02:31:17,020
It just fell over.

2879
02:31:17,020 --> 02:31:17,740
So I can't see it.

2880
02:31:17,740 --> 02:31:18,780
Did give it to you.

2881
02:31:18,780 --> 02:31:19,340
Yeah.

2882
02:31:19,340 --> 02:31:24,700
Um, they actually have like a multi disc grandia Memorial soundtrack, but that's

2883
02:31:24,700 --> 02:31:27,020
like a 50,000 yen.

2884
02:31:27,020 --> 02:31:28,300
And I don't know.

2885
02:31:28,300 --> 02:31:28,940
Oh, sorry.

2886
02:31:28,940 --> 02:31:30,300
This isn't your, oh, it's a Euro.

2887
02:31:30,300 --> 02:31:32,220
Nevermind the hell.

2888
02:31:32,220 --> 02:31:34,060
And so that means it's super expensive.

2889
02:31:34,060 --> 02:31:34,700
Yeah.

2890
02:31:34,700 --> 02:31:35,740
So, yeah.

2891
02:31:36,780 --> 02:31:39,100
But anyway, um, yeah, there you go.

2892
02:31:39,100 --> 02:31:40,220
The soundtrack was good.

2893
02:31:41,500 --> 02:31:42,140
Indeed.

2894
02:31:42,140 --> 02:31:44,780
It was a few more stories for you guys.

2895
02:31:44,780 --> 02:31:47,580
Uh, Loki coming back to something you talked about at the top of the show.

2896
02:31:48,220 --> 02:31:48,860
Yes.

2897
02:31:48,860 --> 02:31:50,940
So, uh, this is pretty exciting.

2898
02:31:50,940 --> 02:31:57,100
So finally, after the long beta that they have, uh, ray tracing has come to

2899
02:31:57,100 --> 02:32:01,260
Minecraft, at least it has all the windows 10 bedrock edition.

2900
02:32:01,260 --> 02:32:06,060
So now you can actually check out, uh, Minecraft with ray tracing.

2901
02:32:06,060 --> 02:32:07,340
However, there's some caveats.

2902
02:32:07,340 --> 02:32:14,220
So one, um, they don't officially put out a texture pack or they haven't put out a

2903
02:32:14,220 --> 02:32:16,300
texture pack yet that supports ray tracing.

2904
02:32:16,300 --> 02:32:20,780
So you have to find a texture pack that does, and then use that.

2905
02:32:20,780 --> 02:32:25,660
And then, um, you know, there's obviously some performance stuff with that as well.

2906
02:32:25,660 --> 02:32:30,620
I did check it out on my world, um, on my realm a little bit and it looks nice.

2907
02:32:30,620 --> 02:32:35,900
Um, the texture pack that I had didn't have like a lot of, um, it wasn't too fancy.

2908
02:32:35,900 --> 02:32:40,140
It was just basically kind of the same type of stuff, but the lighting is really nice

2909
02:32:40,140 --> 02:32:43,820
and it looks, uh, really good, but I'm curious to see what that would look like on.

2910
02:32:43,820 --> 02:32:46,620
I think they should bring it to console on the Xbox series X.

2911
02:32:47,340 --> 02:32:52,060
Um, I'd be curious to see what happens there and they also need to officially put out an

2912
02:32:52,060 --> 02:32:52,940
actual texture pack.

2913
02:32:52,940 --> 02:32:58,460
This is a little bit difficult to find one because there really isn't, uh, one available

2914
02:32:58,460 --> 02:33:02,380
on their store, which is where you think that would initially be.

2915
02:33:02,380 --> 02:33:09,980
You have to go to like Nvidia's page and Nvidia had some partner made, um, texture packs that

2916
02:33:09,980 --> 02:33:11,180
were from the beta.

2917
02:33:11,180 --> 02:33:12,860
And so they weren't necessarily great.

2918
02:33:12,860 --> 02:33:15,180
I had to actually go to some mind sites to find one.

2919
02:33:16,300 --> 02:33:19,340
A little bit of a ridiculous, uh, stuff to go through.

2920
02:33:19,340 --> 02:33:24,060
And even then those didn't look as good as some of the ones that were in like the demo

2921
02:33:24,060 --> 02:33:26,220
levels that they had for the insider program.

2922
02:33:27,420 --> 02:33:30,300
But I mean, it is something you can check out.

2923
02:33:30,300 --> 02:33:32,380
Um, you can toggle it on and off and stuff.

2924
02:33:32,380 --> 02:33:38,140
Um, but like I said, you know, I couldn't get it to, I liked the way it looked, but

2925
02:33:38,140 --> 02:33:40,300
then my kids are like, well, I want that for mine.

2926
02:33:40,300 --> 02:33:45,420
I'm like, well, I'm sorry, you can't run on the switch and you can't run it on your laptop.

2927
02:33:45,420 --> 02:33:47,580
So I'm the only one that gets it.

2928
02:33:47,580 --> 02:33:50,620
Um, but yeah, it's, it's really cool.

2929
02:33:50,620 --> 02:33:51,660
I'm glad it's out of beta.

2930
02:33:51,660 --> 02:33:52,460
So go check it out.

2931
02:33:52,460 --> 02:33:55,580
If you have a card that's capable of doing a retracing.

2932
02:33:55,580 --> 02:33:57,340
So it's pretty cool looking.

2933
02:33:57,340 --> 02:33:59,660
So when are we getting these updates on Xbox series X?

2934
02:33:59,660 --> 02:34:01,180
Since that can do ray tracing.

2935
02:34:01,180 --> 02:34:01,740
I don't know.

2936
02:34:01,740 --> 02:34:04,060
I don't know where the fancy graphics packs going to be.

2937
02:34:04,060 --> 02:34:05,660
Well, it's that that's gone.

2938
02:34:05,660 --> 02:34:08,300
I think at this point that's well, yeah, it's basically this.

2939
02:34:08,300 --> 02:34:09,980
Yeah, it's this instead.

2940
02:34:09,980 --> 02:34:13,580
So, uh, yeah, I'd be curious to see if we get that on series X.

2941
02:34:13,580 --> 02:34:14,140
Why not?

2942
02:34:14,140 --> 02:34:18,540
I mean, not that I play a ton of Minecraft, but every time they do some big change,

2943
02:34:18,540 --> 02:34:20,300
I'm always like, let me see.

2944
02:34:20,300 --> 02:34:22,700
It really is pretty moody.

2945
02:34:22,700 --> 02:34:29,900
Like, um, when you go to the nether, I mean, it's just, it's night and day different for

2946
02:34:29,900 --> 02:34:30,700
the way it looks.

2947
02:34:30,700 --> 02:34:36,140
And also just like caves can be really dark, but also like, it's just, it's more realistic.

2948
02:34:36,140 --> 02:34:41,980
So like you can, um, go into some, like in the vanilla game would be like completely

2949
02:34:41,980 --> 02:34:47,100
pitch black, but then they're, you know, pretty well lit in the ray tracing or vice

2950
02:34:47,100 --> 02:34:47,500
versa.

2951
02:34:47,500 --> 02:34:51,740
You could have some that, you know, some caves that are dark, but your contrast is turned

2952
02:34:51,740 --> 02:34:57,260
way up, but like it's dark, dark in these, like just pitch black, you know, it it's pretty

2953
02:34:57,260 --> 02:34:57,980
cool.

2954
02:34:57,980 --> 02:35:05,100
Um, I think it's a really neat addition if, you know, especially now my card is kind of

2955
02:35:05,100 --> 02:35:10,140
like the bottom end of ray tracing, but as you know, a couple of years from now, when

2956
02:35:10,220 --> 02:35:15,100
we're running all cards that have been doing ray tracing for a while, and as they add more,

2957
02:35:15,100 --> 02:35:21,660
like, you know, that DLSS and stuff like that to it, it's going to really improve, um, the

2958
02:35:21,660 --> 02:35:22,620
performance of it.

2959
02:35:22,620 --> 02:35:25,260
And we'll see a lot more games start taking advantage of it.

2960
02:35:25,260 --> 02:35:29,980
And I think this is definitely one that, because there's not much you can really do with Minecraft

2961
02:35:29,980 --> 02:35:30,460
graphics.

2962
02:35:30,460 --> 02:35:35,100
I mean, aside from upping the pixel count and stuff, but like ray tracing really makes

2963
02:35:35,100 --> 02:35:35,740
a difference.

2964
02:35:35,740 --> 02:35:37,100
So it's worthwhile.

2965
02:35:37,980 --> 02:35:38,860
All right.

2966
02:35:38,860 --> 02:35:41,900
Well, I hope I get to check it out in a series because I don't have a graphics card good

2967
02:35:41,900 --> 02:35:44,620
enough on my PC and I don't see myself getting one for a while.

2968
02:35:44,620 --> 02:35:47,980
Not just, not just the shortage problems, but just because I've been buying too much

2969
02:35:47,980 --> 02:35:48,780
other shit.

2970
02:35:48,780 --> 02:35:51,580
Uh, but, uh, yeah, let's check that out at some point.

2971
02:35:51,580 --> 02:35:51,820
All right.

2972
02:35:51,820 --> 02:35:53,260
Well, one more story for you guys.

2973
02:35:53,260 --> 02:35:59,020
And that is about the PlayStation 5 controller now being available to use on Steam.

2974
02:35:59,020 --> 02:36:02,300
And I think we talked about that, like this was coming or people were playing with this,

2975
02:36:02,300 --> 02:36:05,900
but, uh, this is now available for all Steam gamers.

2976
02:36:05,900 --> 02:36:08,220
I think it was like in a beta at some point or something.

2977
02:36:08,620 --> 02:36:09,660
So this is pretty cool.

2978
02:36:09,660 --> 02:36:15,340
Uh, it has full support on Steam for the led and the controller trackpad rumble, uh, gyro

2979
02:36:15,340 --> 02:36:16,780
controls and so forth.

2980
02:36:16,780 --> 02:36:21,260
You had to originally opt into the beta to use it, but now it is just, it is there.

2981
02:36:21,260 --> 02:36:27,740
Uh, some games that support it on Steam, death stranding, no man's sky and horizon zero

2982
02:36:27,740 --> 02:36:28,060
dawn.

2983
02:36:28,060 --> 02:36:31,580
So interesting that those are all games that would, you know, use that stuff anyway through

2984
02:36:31,580 --> 02:36:37,580
Sony, but, uh, neat still, uh, the controller of course will work with many other titles.

2985
02:36:37,580 --> 02:36:42,220
It'll be interesting to see if, uh, folks decide to add features into their games.

2986
02:36:42,220 --> 02:36:46,940
Uh, paging Aaron, can we get the light to go Brown every time you do a pixel poop?

2987
02:36:46,940 --> 02:36:47,340
I don't know.

2988
02:36:47,340 --> 02:36:47,660
Anyway.

2989
02:36:47,660 --> 02:36:47,900
All right.

2990
02:36:47,900 --> 02:36:48,940
It was worth a shot.

2991
02:36:48,940 --> 02:36:49,660
All right.

2992
02:36:49,660 --> 02:36:50,540
We don't have a place.

2993
02:36:50,540 --> 02:36:51,980
There's no PlayStation 4.

2994
02:36:51,980 --> 02:36:54,540
Oh, you mean like an on the five through steam.

2995
02:36:54,540 --> 02:36:56,380
Yeah, that would be funny.

2996
02:36:56,380 --> 02:37:00,220
Um, I don't, yeah, I don't know about that.

2997
02:37:00,220 --> 02:37:00,380
Yeah.

2998
02:37:00,380 --> 02:37:03,420
And I'm, I'm just teasing obviously, but that's kind of cool.

2999
02:37:03,980 --> 02:37:04,220
All right.

3000
02:37:04,300 --> 02:37:07,740
Surprised that they don't have the adaptive triggers though in there.

3001
02:37:07,740 --> 02:37:11,820
Um, that's not, I guess that's a PlayStation 5 exclusive thing.

3002
02:37:11,820 --> 02:37:12,140
Yeah.

3003
02:37:12,140 --> 02:37:14,700
It might be something that's difficult to translate to PC too.

3004
02:37:14,700 --> 02:37:15,580
I don't know.

3005
02:37:15,580 --> 02:37:18,140
Someone will hack drivers for it and they'll have it.

3006
02:37:18,140 --> 02:37:20,220
It's a matter of time, but it might not be very well done.

3007
02:37:20,220 --> 02:37:24,540
I mean, that sounds really mean, but you know, it might not be as smooth as what you are

3008
02:37:24,540 --> 02:37:25,740
used to on the PlayStation.

3009
02:37:25,740 --> 02:37:26,540
It's not at first.

3010
02:37:27,260 --> 02:37:28,380
So, all right.

3011
02:37:28,380 --> 02:37:30,380
Uh, so we're going to go to listener round table.

3012
02:37:30,380 --> 02:37:33,820
If you have any questions that you're dying to know the answers to, uh, try to get those

3013
02:37:33,820 --> 02:37:37,340
in chat, um, because we're, we're running pretty long tonight here.

3014
02:37:37,340 --> 02:37:40,780
So I don't have a lot, a lot of time, but, uh, I do want to check out on the mailbag

3015
02:37:40,780 --> 02:37:43,340
dark soccer over at, oh, let's do it.

3016
02:37:43,340 --> 02:37:46,700
Participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send your emails.

3017
02:37:46,700 --> 02:37:47,900
And guess what?

3018
02:37:47,900 --> 02:37:48,780
It's for me.

3019
02:37:50,940 --> 02:37:52,060
It's from me.

3020
02:37:52,060 --> 02:37:52,300
All right.

3021
02:37:53,580 --> 02:37:55,740
Um, so are you going to share with the class?

3022
02:37:56,620 --> 02:37:57,020
Maybe.

3023
02:37:57,660 --> 02:37:59,580
What's in it for me anyway?

3024
02:37:59,580 --> 02:38:00,060
Reaction.

3025
02:38:00,060 --> 02:38:01,900
Hey, hey, O R.

3026
02:38:01,900 --> 02:38:02,780
Hey, Jamie.

3027
02:38:02,780 --> 02:38:03,180
Yay.

3028
02:38:03,180 --> 02:38:03,420
Hi.

3029
02:38:04,060 --> 02:38:07,980
I finally bought animal crossing about a month ago, but I haven't started it yet.

3030
02:38:07,980 --> 02:38:09,980
I know you were basically obsessed.

3031
02:38:09,980 --> 02:38:11,100
True facts.

3032
02:38:11,100 --> 02:38:15,500
So I was hoping you could give me a super short and two point review to get me motivated

3033
02:38:15,500 --> 02:38:16,860
to start playing.

3034
02:38:16,860 --> 02:38:21,420
I don't really touch my switch too often, but I know I need to super short email, but

3035
02:38:21,420 --> 02:38:21,980
there you go.

3036
02:38:21,980 --> 02:38:22,940
Happy holidays.

3037
02:38:22,940 --> 02:38:23,900
Frodo's wagons.

3038
02:38:24,780 --> 02:38:25,280
Okay.

3039
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:35,120
So my to the point review is, um, you take the untamed wilderness that is your Island

3040
02:38:35,120 --> 02:38:36,480
and you make it your bitch.

3041
02:38:38,400 --> 02:38:43,600
You build your town full of ingrates and you bribe them for their love.

3042
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:51,280
And then in return, once they adore you, they give you a picture of themselves and you play

3043
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:54,960
dress up and you fill your catalog.

3044
02:38:54,960 --> 02:39:03,440
But mostly it's taking this really this untamed Island and making it into your own little

3045
02:39:03,440 --> 02:39:07,600
personal paradise and then hitting Ed with a bug net.

3046
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:13,840
My quick review would be it's the escapism we all need in this year.

3047
02:39:14,560 --> 02:39:18,640
Also, you bought it, so you might as well play it.

3048
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:26,080
Otherwise, you know what should motivate you is that I will send you my friend code.

3049
02:39:26,640 --> 02:39:28,480
Oh, that's very nice with me.

3050
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:35,680
I will give you the hookup in DIY recipes because go over there and shake all our trees.

3051
02:39:35,680 --> 02:39:36,800
She loves that.

3052
02:39:36,800 --> 02:39:42,000
No, don't shake my trees because I get nuts from my trees and the acorns.

3053
02:39:43,040 --> 02:39:44,960
Lately, I've been catching my snowflakes.

3054
02:39:45,280 --> 02:39:50,240
Like a good girl and making little douchebag snowboys.

3055
02:39:50,240 --> 02:39:51,920
Have you built a snowboy yet, Rob?

3056
02:39:51,920 --> 02:39:53,920
I haven't touched the game since Labor Day.

3057
02:39:55,600 --> 02:39:58,640
OK, so you make the little snowman thing, right?

3058
02:39:59,200 --> 02:40:03,120
And if you don't make him like fantastic, he's a little shit to you.

3059
02:40:04,240 --> 02:40:08,640
So I need to make a fantastic one, but it's just like, I don't know.

3060
02:40:08,640 --> 02:40:13,600
It's really hard to put like a description on what makes it addictive and fun.

3061
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:15,920
It's just an escape is what it is.

3062
02:40:17,040 --> 02:40:21,520
And it's going in and getting the stuff to build your house the way that you want it.

3063
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:24,640
And some people will do like, quote, a livable house.

3064
02:40:24,640 --> 02:40:25,440
You know what I mean?

3065
02:40:25,440 --> 02:40:27,920
Like a living room and all this shit, right?

3066
02:40:27,920 --> 02:40:29,040
Like I have a kitchen.

3067
02:40:29,040 --> 02:40:30,960
I used to have a bathroom, but I got rid of it

3068
02:40:32,480 --> 02:40:35,280
because, you know, in Animal Crossing, everyone pees in the woods.

3069
02:40:35,280 --> 02:40:43,200
So but the but like I have an alt and I made her house into like there's a tea room room.

3070
02:40:43,600 --> 02:40:49,280
In the basement, I have a cafe and it's just.

3071
02:40:50,560 --> 02:40:53,920
It's just really fun, you know, and you get to play with me,

3072
02:40:53,920 --> 02:40:57,760
I'm going to try to get you my friend code and I will respond back to the email with it.

3073
02:40:58,320 --> 02:40:58,800
All right.

3074
02:40:58,800 --> 02:40:59,920
Well, thank you for the email.

3075
02:40:59,920 --> 02:41:03,040
If you'd like to send me my friend code, too bad.

3076
02:41:03,040 --> 02:41:05,920
Now just message me at Dark Soccer on Twitter.

3077
02:41:05,920 --> 02:41:10,560
If you'd like to send us an email, I almost said at Dark Soccer on Twitter,

3078
02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:14,640
you can send us email participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

3079
02:41:14,640 --> 02:41:17,280
if you want to participate with the next Mailbag segment.

3080
02:41:17,840 --> 02:41:20,080
We have a couple of quick questions from chat for the roundtable.

3081
02:41:20,080 --> 02:41:20,800
Let me get to these.

3082
02:41:21,680 --> 02:41:26,800
No one special 77 in our chat asks of all the games that came out this year

3083
02:41:26,800 --> 02:41:30,240
or re-released this year and you got or played.

3084
02:41:30,240 --> 02:41:33,280
Are there any that stick out for you that you really enjoyed?

3085
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:37,440
This is almost spoiling our game of the years, I think.

3086
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:41,200
But I will continue with an answer that I've said several times

3087
02:41:41,200 --> 02:41:43,680
and I think Hades is definitely up there.

3088
02:41:44,320 --> 02:41:47,040
But honestly, for me, even though this is a years old game,

3089
02:41:47,040 --> 02:41:49,440
I would continue to say Final Fantasy 14

3090
02:41:50,400 --> 02:41:53,920
gives me that kind of escapism of doing stuff in a virtual world.

3091
02:41:54,720 --> 02:41:57,760
And I loved Animal Crossing 2, of course, but I know Jamie's gonna say that.

3092
02:41:58,640 --> 02:42:04,160
But Final Fantasy gave me that way to like kind of hang out with people in a virtual space

3093
02:42:04,160 --> 02:42:06,400
when I can't hang out with people in a real space.

3094
02:42:07,920 --> 02:42:09,920
And that was badly needed this year.

3095
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:13,280
So that's kind of why I say that even though that game is, you know,

3096
02:42:13,280 --> 02:42:17,040
is one I've always talked about here on this show, but like, especially in 2020.

3097
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:18,800
Dark Sakura, do I need to ask?

3098
02:42:21,840 --> 02:42:22,480
I'm not saying.

3099
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:27,120
Loki, how about you then?

3100
02:42:29,200 --> 02:42:30,800
I don't know what I played this year.

3101
02:42:30,800 --> 02:42:34,240
Like it was funny, like a couple of days ago, like I was like, oh yeah,

3102
02:42:34,240 --> 02:42:36,320
that's definitely gonna be probably like my game of the year

3103
02:42:36,400 --> 02:42:38,080
because it was before I played Cyberpunk.

3104
02:42:38,080 --> 02:42:39,520
There was something that I was thinking of.

3105
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:42,080
Oh yeah, I played that and that was really good.

3106
02:42:42,080 --> 02:42:44,880
I'm trying to think what that was and I can't remember anymore.

3107
02:42:46,720 --> 02:42:50,480
I have to go back and look at what I played recently, but I know that.

3108
02:42:51,680 --> 02:42:52,180
Go ahead.

3109
02:42:52,800 --> 02:42:55,200
I know there's got to be some stuff out there

3110
02:42:55,760 --> 02:42:59,440
that came out earlier in the year that I was really excited for.

3111
02:43:02,400 --> 02:43:02,880
I don't know.

3112
02:43:02,880 --> 02:43:04,720
I can't think of anything out of my head.

3113
02:43:04,720 --> 02:43:05,920
Borderlands was all right.

3114
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:09,120
A lot of games I've been losing myself in are older games.

3115
02:43:09,120 --> 02:43:12,080
Like you guys know, I spent hours and hours on No Man's Sky.

3116
02:43:12,080 --> 02:43:14,240
I finally got to the point where I kind of stopped that

3117
02:43:14,240 --> 02:43:17,120
because I got distracted with other games, but I love that.

3118
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:18,480
That's an older game.

3119
02:43:18,480 --> 02:43:22,080
Now Dragon Quest XI, I've sunk like 20 hours in the past couple weeks into that.

3120
02:43:22,080 --> 02:43:23,840
So, you know, that's an older game,

3121
02:43:23,840 --> 02:43:27,520
even if it did just get the definitive edition on Xbox for the first time.

3122
02:43:27,520 --> 02:43:31,520
So I feel like this has almost been a year of discovering old stuff in a way.

3123
02:43:32,560 --> 02:43:35,600
But when I really sit down and look at a calendar of everything that's come out this year,

3124
02:43:35,840 --> 02:43:38,960
I'm sure I'm going to have some strong contenders for game of the year.

3125
02:43:38,960 --> 02:43:40,240
And don't just assume it's Hades.

3126
02:43:40,240 --> 02:43:44,240
I haven't really sat down and weighed like what did come out in January, February, March,

3127
02:43:44,240 --> 02:43:46,960
because there was a lot of good stuff that came out right before the pandemic too.

3128
02:43:47,680 --> 02:43:48,000
All right.

3129
02:43:50,400 --> 02:43:52,240
Another question real quick here from actdeft.

3130
02:43:53,040 --> 02:43:57,280
What's a game that was featured or nominated in the game awards that you want to play but haven't?

3131
02:43:59,040 --> 02:44:02,880
A game that was nominated or featured in the game awards that you want to play but haven't?

3132
02:44:02,880 --> 02:44:03,760
The New Mass Effect?

3133
02:44:04,720 --> 02:44:06,960
Yeah, Dragon Age.

3134
02:44:06,960 --> 02:44:10,800
I think maybe talking about the actual nominated games.

3135
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:15,360
I have Hades and haven't touched it yet.

3136
02:44:16,240 --> 02:44:16,740
Okay.

3137
02:44:17,360 --> 02:44:18,080
I want to play it.

3138
02:44:21,680 --> 02:44:22,180
Maybe...

3139
02:44:26,640 --> 02:44:30,560
I'm gravitating to saying The Last of Us Part II just to see what all the Hubba Balloo is about,

3140
02:44:30,640 --> 02:44:34,160
but I just I'm not really a zombie person,

3141
02:44:34,160 --> 02:44:37,600
but I guess the accessibility options might make some of that more bearable.

3142
02:44:37,600 --> 02:44:38,640
Oh, maybe the...

3143
02:44:38,640 --> 02:44:40,720
It's not really zombie zombies, you know?

3144
02:44:40,720 --> 02:44:43,120
Yeah, I know it's different.

3145
02:44:44,880 --> 02:44:46,640
I mean, I'm playing through the first Last of Us now,

3146
02:44:46,640 --> 02:44:48,800
and you do fight like regular people a lot.

3147
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:51,440
I think I'll steal an answer from chat though,

3148
02:44:51,440 --> 02:44:54,720
because this game was hyped last year and I didn't get around to it.

3149
02:44:54,720 --> 02:44:55,760
Disco Elysium.

3150
02:44:55,760 --> 02:44:57,680
I still really need to get around to and play,

3151
02:44:57,680 --> 02:45:00,320
and they did announce that Definitive Edition is coming out.

3152
02:45:00,320 --> 02:45:03,120
So that would probably be on my list.

3153
02:45:04,480 --> 02:45:04,980
Loki?

3154
02:45:08,960 --> 02:45:16,480
I can't really think of anything that they announce that I'd be like super enthusiastic.

3155
02:45:16,480 --> 02:45:18,160
I mean, the Evil Dead game, I guess.

3156
02:45:19,680 --> 02:45:22,480
As far as like stuff that's nominated for awards.

3157
02:45:26,640 --> 02:45:29,600
Yeah, I can't really think of anything that I...

3158
02:45:29,600 --> 02:45:31,520
I mean, Hades, everyone keeps talking about it.

3159
02:45:31,520 --> 02:45:32,800
I guess that would be interesting.

3160
02:45:33,840 --> 02:45:34,880
Do I have that?

3161
02:45:34,880 --> 02:45:37,120
I want to see I have that on the Epic Store,

3162
02:45:37,120 --> 02:45:39,680
but maybe I don't remember.

3163
02:45:40,960 --> 02:45:42,880
There's a lot of stuff in my library that I don't remember.

3164
02:45:46,160 --> 02:45:48,320
I think that was out when the store launched,

3165
02:45:48,320 --> 02:45:50,240
but I don't know if they gave that out for free.

3166
02:45:53,280 --> 02:45:54,560
Nope, don't have that.

3167
02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:59,440
SG100Matt asks one more question here.

3168
02:46:00,080 --> 02:46:04,400
What game from your lifetimes reminds you the most about the holidays?

3169
02:46:04,400 --> 02:46:07,280
Like the game that you got over the holidays as a kid

3170
02:46:07,280 --> 02:46:09,760
that you played the hell out of that gives you fond memories.

3171
02:46:10,960 --> 02:46:13,520
For me, it was more a game that I rented,

3172
02:46:13,520 --> 02:46:16,640
but I always associate this around like the new,

3173
02:46:16,640 --> 02:46:19,360
that little break between Christmas and New Year's.

3174
02:46:19,360 --> 02:46:20,720
Super Mario Brothers 2.

3175
02:46:21,600 --> 02:46:23,920
That's right, going all the way back to the NES

3176
02:46:23,920 --> 02:46:24,960
and Mario Brothers 2.

3177
02:46:24,960 --> 02:46:28,000
And when I rented that game and I stayed up all night playing it

3178
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,160
and it was off from school for a little bit

3179
02:46:30,160 --> 02:46:32,160
and that was like my winter break was that game.

3180
02:46:32,160 --> 02:46:34,080
So that's my easy answer.

3181
02:46:34,080 --> 02:46:35,120
How about you guys?

3182
02:46:35,120 --> 02:46:35,760
Darcyra?

3183
02:46:36,720 --> 02:46:41,520
I played so much Legend of Zelda Link to the Past

3184
02:46:41,520 --> 02:46:43,440
and keep in mind it was supposed to be for my brothers,

3185
02:46:43,440 --> 02:46:44,880
but screw them, it was my game.

3186
02:46:46,240 --> 02:46:49,840
So I would put that one definitely up there

3187
02:46:49,840 --> 02:46:52,960
as one of the big holiday things that I remember.

3188
02:46:53,600 --> 02:46:54,160
And Loki?

3189
02:46:55,200 --> 02:46:58,480
I don't remember any games I've got for Christmas.

3190
02:46:59,120 --> 02:47:02,160
So I really don't have anything.

3191
02:47:02,160 --> 02:47:05,440
I can't think of any that I purchased

3192
02:47:05,440 --> 02:47:08,320
or that would have been given to me.

3193
02:47:09,440 --> 02:47:10,480
So I don't know.

3194
02:47:11,040 --> 02:47:12,560
All right, all right.

3195
02:47:12,560 --> 02:47:14,880
Well, I think that's going to be our last question for the night

3196
02:47:14,880 --> 02:47:17,200
because we've got to get to wrapping things up.

3197
02:47:17,200 --> 02:47:19,520
I will check in though with Loki real quick or Dark Soccer

3198
02:47:19,520 --> 02:47:20,880
and see if there's any last minute stories.

3199
02:47:20,880 --> 02:47:25,200
I didn't check for any.

3200
02:47:25,200 --> 02:47:28,960
I don't think we had anything kind of breaking.

3201
02:47:29,680 --> 02:47:32,720
Yeah, I think we're getting to closing time.

3202
02:47:32,720 --> 02:47:34,080
It's about midnight on the East Coast

3203
02:47:34,080 --> 02:47:35,120
and nine o'clock on the West Coast.

3204
02:47:35,120 --> 02:47:36,400
So go ahead though with your thoughts.

3205
02:47:36,400 --> 02:47:42,640
I am planning on doing a test stream to play Hivebent 2.

3206
02:47:44,320 --> 02:47:45,760
Homestuck Hivebent 2.

3207
02:47:45,760 --> 02:47:46,640
Oh, okay.

3208
02:47:47,280 --> 02:47:52,640
So look at my Twitter for when I'm going to do that

3209
02:47:52,640 --> 02:47:55,680
because it really all just depends on how I feel.

3210
02:47:57,520 --> 02:48:01,600
But I'm sensitively thinking that I might do it this Wednesday, actually.

3211
02:48:02,320 --> 02:48:05,680
So my channel, I forgot what my fucking channel is even named.

3212
02:48:07,200 --> 02:48:10,640
It's a underscore olr.

3213
02:48:10,640 --> 02:48:11,200
I think it is.

3214
02:48:11,920 --> 02:48:12,320
Hold on.

3215
02:48:12,320 --> 02:48:13,840
I'm just going to type to myself.

3216
02:48:13,840 --> 02:48:14,320
You're fine.

3217
02:48:15,120 --> 02:48:19,280
Yeah, DarkSakura underscore olr.

3218
02:48:20,240 --> 02:48:23,760
FatNinjaDM talking about a holiday game says in chat,

3219
02:48:23,760 --> 02:48:25,920
Fantasy Star for the Master System.

3220
02:48:25,920 --> 02:48:30,240
I did pick up real recently and I haven't played them yet and I need to.

3221
02:48:30,240 --> 02:48:34,800
But the Sega Ages collection was like on hell a sale on Nintendo Switch.

3222
02:48:34,800 --> 02:48:38,640
And so I picked up Fantasy Star, Alex Kidd, and Fantasy Zone.

3223
02:48:38,640 --> 02:48:40,880
So I have all those games on Switch waiting to play.

3224
02:48:41,680 --> 02:48:43,280
You know I got Fantasy Zone right away.

3225
02:48:43,280 --> 02:48:43,920
Oh, I know.

3226
02:48:43,920 --> 02:48:45,360
And Dan got Outrun.

3227
02:48:46,880 --> 02:48:49,200
Dan fucking loves Outrun.

3228
02:48:49,200 --> 02:48:53,680
You know what I want, though, is I want like a different shooter pack.

3229
02:48:54,880 --> 02:48:57,920
I don't even know if it might already be there, but I freaking want.

3230
02:48:59,280 --> 02:49:00,160
Yeah, Bobby.

3231
02:49:00,160 --> 02:49:03,760
Bobby says I got Outrun too, but I paid 500 bucks for it because you got an arcade one up.

3232
02:49:05,680 --> 02:49:09,360
But I want like a classic shooter thing.

3233
02:49:09,360 --> 02:49:17,840
Like, like maybe like the first Don Patch or Polestar Blazing Star.

3234
02:49:17,840 --> 02:49:20,320
But I really, really, really, really want R-Type.

3235
02:49:20,320 --> 02:49:21,440
Just like R-Type.

3236
02:49:22,800 --> 02:49:25,760
That has like some of my favorite video game music ever.

3237
02:49:26,320 --> 02:49:27,840
This freaking R-Type.

3238
02:49:27,840 --> 02:49:28,400
Good times.

3239
02:49:29,360 --> 02:49:31,840
All right, Loki, did you find anything?

3240
02:49:32,880 --> 02:49:33,360
Nope.

3241
02:49:33,360 --> 02:49:35,120
All right, that's fine.

3242
02:49:35,120 --> 02:49:36,160
We probably need to wrap up.

3243
02:49:36,160 --> 02:49:37,200
We've been running.

3244
02:49:37,200 --> 02:49:38,320
We got a little late start tonight.

3245
02:49:38,400 --> 02:49:40,800
So I think the runtime on the podcast is still under three hours.

3246
02:49:40,800 --> 02:49:43,600
But it's now midnight on the East Coast, nine o'clock here.

3247
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:47,280
And we still have to wrap a few things up before bedtime.

3248
02:49:47,280 --> 02:49:50,880
So thank you all, of course, for tuning into the show this week.

3249
02:49:50,880 --> 02:49:52,480
Thank you so much for supporting the show.

3250
02:49:52,480 --> 02:49:56,560
Whether you were here live or you listen on the podcast feed, we really appreciated it.

3251
02:49:56,560 --> 02:50:00,320
If you like this show, you can help us out by spreading the word because we are the show

3252
02:50:00,320 --> 02:50:01,520
where every gamer has a voice.

3253
02:50:01,520 --> 02:50:05,760
But if the voices aren't here in studio to put out over the air, then how can we get them?

3254
02:50:05,760 --> 02:50:07,520
So please tell a friend or two about the show.

3255
02:50:07,520 --> 02:50:08,320
Help us spread the word.

3256
02:50:08,320 --> 02:50:10,000
Where the mouth goes a long, long way.

3257
02:50:11,600 --> 02:50:14,800
What else goes a long, long way is support via Twitch,

3258
02:50:14,800 --> 02:50:17,120
the auto hosting and things you guys do on Twitch.

3259
02:50:17,120 --> 02:50:18,160
That is awesome.

3260
02:50:18,160 --> 02:50:19,360
Really appreciate that.

3261
02:50:19,360 --> 02:50:23,680
And if you do feel like supporting the show in a financial way, might I point you to the

3262
02:50:23,680 --> 02:50:26,160
VOG Network shop that just opened recently.

3263
02:50:26,160 --> 02:50:28,720
There's a few items there you can pick up to support VOG Network,

3264
02:50:28,720 --> 02:50:31,760
OLR and Bobby Black Wolf and other stuff to come soon.

3265
02:50:31,760 --> 02:50:34,240
More designs hopefully in the coming months.

3266
02:50:34,240 --> 02:50:38,000
But that's vognetwork.com slash shop.

3267
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:39,120
I was getting to it.

3268
02:50:39,120 --> 02:50:40,640
So check that out.

3269
02:50:40,640 --> 02:50:43,600
So I'm going to repost in the chat room.

3270
02:50:43,600 --> 02:50:44,100
Thank you.

3271
02:50:45,120 --> 02:50:47,760
And I think that's really it.

3272
02:50:47,760 --> 02:50:48,880
Otherwise, all I have to say.

3273
02:50:48,880 --> 02:50:51,600
So let's say you don't even need the post in the chat room.

3274
02:50:51,600 --> 02:50:55,440
If you scroll down the page a little bit, there's an actual little widget there that you can

3275
02:50:56,400 --> 02:50:57,200
purchase stuff from.

3276
02:50:57,200 --> 02:50:58,080
At least it is online.

3277
02:50:58,800 --> 02:51:02,880
Oh, yeah, I think there is a widget right there on the VOG stream.

3278
02:51:03,200 --> 02:51:06,400
Bobby's been playing with that shirt that I was requesting, Rob.

3279
02:51:07,200 --> 02:51:08,320
I forget which one that was.

3280
02:51:09,040 --> 02:51:12,320
The v-neck women's shirt with the VOG logo.

3281
02:51:12,320 --> 02:51:14,160
You got to remind me when I'm sitting in front of a computer.

3282
02:51:14,160 --> 02:51:14,880
And yes, I'll do it.

3283
02:51:15,440 --> 02:51:17,040
Yes, we'll get it.

3284
02:51:17,040 --> 02:51:18,640
I said more things come, didn't I?

3285
02:51:18,640 --> 02:51:19,140
All right.

3286
02:51:20,160 --> 02:51:21,280
Well, teaser then.

3287
02:51:21,280 --> 02:51:23,200
And it's going to be in this shop because I want it.

3288
02:51:23,840 --> 02:51:24,720
That's fine.

3289
02:51:24,720 --> 02:51:26,560
You get your say.

3290
02:51:27,280 --> 02:51:29,040
OK, let's wrap up.

3291
02:51:29,040 --> 02:51:30,640
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

3292
02:51:31,440 --> 02:51:33,040
Loki, your final thought tonight.

3293
02:51:34,160 --> 02:51:36,640
My final thought is I'll be working more on my game this week.

3294
02:51:38,880 --> 02:51:43,760
My final thought is thank you for all the kind words you guys have sent over the years.

3295
02:51:44,400 --> 02:51:46,160
I really appreciate it.

3296
02:51:46,160 --> 02:51:48,080
And we have such a good community here at OLR.

3297
02:51:48,080 --> 02:51:48,880
I'm so thankful.

3298
02:51:48,880 --> 02:51:50,640
And y'all make it worth it.

3299
02:51:50,640 --> 02:51:57,200
And they're the fuel that keep this thing going on into almost episode 850, our 19th

3300
02:51:57,200 --> 02:51:58,080
year coming up.

3301
02:51:58,720 --> 02:52:01,520
I can't believe that 20 years is really in sight for this show.

3302
02:52:01,520 --> 02:52:03,680
It's pretty crazy, but I love it.

3303
02:52:04,720 --> 02:52:06,560
Dark soccer, last but not least, your final thought.

3304
02:52:08,080 --> 02:52:10,160
It's been a month and I still miss Supernatural.

3305
02:52:12,720 --> 02:52:13,520
All right.

3306
02:52:13,520 --> 02:52:16,160
Well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3307
02:52:16,160 --> 02:52:17,200
Have a great week.

3308
02:52:17,200 --> 02:52:18,400
Happy gaming.

3309
02:52:18,400 --> 02:52:20,000
Catch up on your backlog.

3310
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:20,560
Have fun.

3311
02:52:21,120 --> 02:52:23,120
We'll see you next time here on the show in seven days.

3312
02:52:23,120 --> 02:52:23,840
