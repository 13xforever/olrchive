00:00.000 --> 00:13.560
Music games are at a pivot as Rock Band was made compatible in Generation 8, but as of

00:13.560 --> 00:15.840
yet there's been no big news for Generation 9.

00:15.840 --> 00:19.920
Meanwhile Konami continues to bring the Bomani Suite to PC with five game releases now available

00:19.920 --> 00:21.280
in Japan.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.200
Music licensing makes releases in the West difficult, but a quick shout out to Taiko

00:24.200 --> 00:27.680
no Tachi-Gen, Groove Coaster, Project Diva, and Kingdom Hearts, Melody of Memory all on

00:27.680 --> 00:28.680
the Switch.

00:28.680 --> 00:32.040
This is the 32nd Music Game Update, it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers,

00:32.040 --> 00:35.000
and Loki with more of this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now

00:35.000 --> 00:37.120
on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.120 --> 00:44.640
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to the weekly show where every

00:44.640 --> 00:49.920
gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio Live.

00:49.920 --> 00:57.000
Once again tonight for episode number 848, December the 20th of 2020.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.680
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here live every week, I think we may have Dark

01:02.680 --> 01:08.200
Sakura or Jamie Summers who is having tech difficulties for the show, is she there?

01:08.200 --> 01:10.760
Okay she's still not with us, but hopefully will be joining us at some point throughout

01:10.760 --> 01:16.480
the show, she was having some problems with her computer beforehand, so I think she was

01:16.480 --> 01:20.080
trying to reboot or connect from another device or something like that.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.640
So hopefully we'll be hearing from her shortly, but I know joining us tonight, because I can

01:23.640 --> 01:26.840
see him on cam, is Techmaster Loki.

01:26.840 --> 01:27.840
Hello.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.040
Hi Loki, how are you?

01:29.040 --> 01:30.040
I'm doing good.

01:30.040 --> 01:34.240
Good, and I see that you're wearing your new OLR shirt that's available at the VoG Network

01:34.240 --> 01:36.240
Shop, plug plug.

01:36.240 --> 01:37.240
Yes I am.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.040
Yeah, how is it?

01:39.040 --> 01:40.520
It's comfortable.

01:40.520 --> 01:45.840
It's wonderful, it's premium quality, I love it.

01:45.840 --> 01:53.720
If it's not the greatest, I'm gonna be honest, I did not care for the mask with the logo

01:53.720 --> 01:57.200
in the corner, because what happens is that the folding of the mask kind of makes the

01:57.200 --> 01:59.760
logo disappear, so yeah.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.100
But you can still get it if you want, otherwise it's a quality mask.

02:02.100 --> 02:05.880
We have a different mask that's got like VoG super big on it, so that works too.

02:05.880 --> 02:11.280
But all that available, the shirts are great, I actually, Loki's got the OLR shirt, I have

02:11.280 --> 02:16.640
the VoG Network shirts, and they turned out really good, so quality products over at the

02:16.640 --> 02:17.640
shop.

02:17.640 --> 02:23.080
VoGnetwork.com slash shop, if you want to check that out, ooh, hi, hi DarkSakura, we

02:23.080 --> 02:25.680
hear you, do you hear us?

02:25.680 --> 02:30.320
Okay, she doesn't, this is gonna be very awkward, this is gonna be like the most awkward Zoom

02:30.320 --> 02:41.000
holiday thing tonight, anyway, hi, we hear you DarkSakura, loud and clear, can you hear

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
us?

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Okay.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.400
I think that is a no.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.640
She doesn't even know she's coming through on the show.

02:48.640 --> 02:55.880
She's just trying to stress the importance of COVID testing, and you know, we should

02:55.880 --> 03:01.560
all be vigilant, especially considering the situation.

03:01.560 --> 03:07.800
I'm texting her right now that we heard you, you just can't hear us, that's right, you're

03:07.800 --> 03:12.580
right, she's stressing the importance of making sure that you get tested, see, testing is

03:12.580 --> 03:19.980
so important, COVID testing, exactly, oh, her camp's coming on, so hopefully at some

03:19.980 --> 03:27.200
point she'll be able to see and hear us, all right, anyway, Loki, what's the game playing

03:27.200 --> 03:28.200
behind you tonight?

03:28.200 --> 03:33.820
I'm trying to figure it out, it looks like a 3D King's Quest sort of thing, what is that

03:33.820 --> 03:35.900
playing behind you tonight?

03:35.900 --> 03:40.220
It's visceral cleanup detail, Santa's rampage.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.900
I have not heard of that.

03:42.900 --> 03:48.780
Do you remember visceral cleanup detail is basically, it was you're coming in after like,

03:48.780 --> 03:55.300
like a shmup, like an FPS, like shooter, and you're cleaning up all the bodies and blood

03:55.300 --> 03:59.180
and bullets and stuff that are left behind, so that's the premise of the game.

03:59.180 --> 04:00.180
Interesting.

04:00.180 --> 04:05.140
So in this case, you are cleaning up after Santa's rampage through his workshop.

04:05.140 --> 04:06.140
Is this an itch.io game?

04:06.140 --> 04:08.180
This sounds kind of funny, I like that.

04:08.180 --> 04:13.820
I think it is on itch.io, but it's definitely on Steam, it's been in a few humble bundles,

04:13.820 --> 04:15.300
so that's where I got it from.

04:15.300 --> 04:16.300
Love it.

04:16.300 --> 04:20.660
I'm also, what was cracking me up too is that when Dark Soccer's cam came on, the room was

04:20.660 --> 04:27.140
completely empty, like it's like, what the hell's going on, we were getting ghost Jamie

04:27.140 --> 04:32.660
for a minute there, that's what they're saying in chat, over at our chat, can Jamie hear

04:32.660 --> 04:34.660
us now?

04:34.660 --> 04:36.380
I don't know if she can.

04:36.380 --> 04:41.220
Okay, so it's still, you gotta love it.

04:41.220 --> 04:46.580
All right, I will give our chat room a plug over at twitch.tv slash vog network because

04:46.580 --> 04:50.520
we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right

04:50.520 --> 04:55.340
after the Bobby Black Wolf show, again, twitch.tv slash vog network, six o'clock Pacific, nine

04:55.340 --> 04:56.340
o'clock Eastern.

04:56.340 --> 05:00.420
Some comments coming in, Quest Buster says the shirt does look comfy, and if we were

05:00.420 --> 05:04.180
in Cyberpunk, that shirt just added 180 points of armor.

05:04.180 --> 05:05.940
Yes.

05:05.940 --> 05:11.860
No One Special 77 is talking about, I have the Steam version of that game, the visceral

05:11.860 --> 05:13.740
cleaning, is that what it's called?

05:13.740 --> 05:20.940
Yeah, visceral cleanup detail, I think, or duty, yeah, I've played it before, I didn't

05:20.940 --> 05:27.580
really know what to do in it, but having watched this video, I kind of have an idea of what

05:27.580 --> 05:28.740
you're supposed to do.

05:28.740 --> 05:33.620
It just, it was hard, it's a very tedious game because you have to mop stuff and you

05:33.620 --> 05:40.260
have to move stuff around, but it's silly, a lot of people speed run it, so it's fun.

05:40.260 --> 05:44.500
Is it part of, because I know Bobby was just doing a cheap plug for Awesome Games Done

05:44.500 --> 05:47.260
Quick, it's coming up in just two weeks, where did the time go?

05:47.260 --> 05:51.420
I didn't realize it was only two weeks away, but it's just, I guess it's one of those things,

05:51.420 --> 05:54.780
2020, is this one of the games they're going to be doing?

05:54.780 --> 05:58.580
I know they've done it in the past, I don't know if they were doing it this time, but

05:58.580 --> 06:04.020
yeah, because originally I had actually picked Christmas Nights, but I thought that was kind

06:04.020 --> 06:09.940
of obvious, and I think I've done that, we've done that in the past, but I wanted to mix

06:09.940 --> 06:13.500
it up a bit, so that's why I was like, oh yeah, there's that game, and I have to remember

06:13.500 --> 06:20.420
what the name was, so yeah, let me see if they have it in there, I don't know if it's

06:20.420 --> 06:23.420
probably being done this year, but I know they have done in the past because I've watched

06:23.420 --> 06:26.940
it and some of the crazy stuff they do with that.

06:26.940 --> 06:27.940
Nice.

06:27.980 --> 06:31.140
I think we may have had a breakthrough on the Dark Soccer tech situation, are you with

06:31.140 --> 06:32.140
us now, Jamie?

06:32.140 --> 06:33.780
I am, can you hear me?

06:33.780 --> 06:38.500
You did it, yes, we hear you, all is well, hello.

06:38.500 --> 06:42.900
My headset kind of took a dive and then my computer was having some problems booting

06:42.900 --> 06:49.380
it up, so I finally just said fuck it, and set up my new mic.

06:49.380 --> 06:54.020
Well it looks nice, you got your whole little pop guard and a little professional mic over

06:54.020 --> 06:55.020
there, it looks nice.

06:55.460 --> 07:02.140
It's one of those Audio-Technica ones, rather than like 200 and something bucks, I actually

07:02.140 --> 07:05.580
had a really good deal and got it for 110, so why not?

07:05.580 --> 07:08.700
Well the chat is saying you're a little quieter than usual, so you might just have to work

07:08.700 --> 07:11.540
with the positioning and things like that, maybe get the, uh oh, get the...

07:11.540 --> 07:15.380
Actually I think you have, it could be mixer settings on, perhaps on your side, because

07:15.380 --> 07:18.260
I haven't found a way to increase the sensitivity over on my side.

07:18.260 --> 07:22.700
No, because you guys are filtered through Discord, so if I change anything, it's you

07:22.700 --> 07:24.100
and Loki.

07:24.180 --> 07:30.060
My mic setup is for 100%, so I'll see if I've got something else that I can adjust.

07:30.060 --> 07:33.780
Oh yeah, actually, you know what, I can always bump you up in Discord, but when you got close

07:33.780 --> 07:35.620
to the mic there, I think you were good.

07:35.620 --> 07:37.180
Don't you love live tech support?

07:37.180 --> 07:38.180
Alright.

07:38.180 --> 07:41.900
Well, that and my pop filter will not stay where the hell I put it.

07:41.900 --> 07:42.900
It's fine.

07:42.900 --> 07:43.900
Is this any better?

07:43.900 --> 07:44.900
It is to me.

07:44.900 --> 07:50.140
Chat, if she's too quiet, let me know, because I can always boost or deafen, I can use Discord

07:50.140 --> 07:52.540
as a mixer too, if I need to.

07:52.540 --> 07:56.100
I think I have the AT2020.

07:56.100 --> 08:01.700
One of my friends recommended it to me, and so that's what I'm using, and I really like

08:01.700 --> 08:07.420
their audio output, and so I decided to go for it.

08:07.420 --> 08:08.420
You sound really good to me.

08:08.420 --> 08:09.420
Does this sound any different than my old mic?

08:09.420 --> 08:11.040
You sound a lot better.

08:11.040 --> 08:14.900
It's a lot clearer, and I can hear it fine in my headset, for what it's worth, so I think

08:14.900 --> 08:15.900
you're good.

08:15.900 --> 08:20.700
So tech issues aside, before we get into the big gaming story this week, because of course

08:20.700 --> 08:24.580
we are a video game podcast, and there's a lot of gaming news about one particular

08:24.580 --> 08:28.540
game, and I know it's a game that's not really on your radar, Dark Soccer, and it's not really

08:28.540 --> 08:29.540
on mine.

08:29.540 --> 08:34.060
Why the fuck would I play something broken?

08:34.060 --> 08:36.220
This is going to be a Loki segment coming up.

08:36.220 --> 08:38.620
Skyrim is a great game.

08:38.620 --> 08:39.620
True.

08:39.620 --> 08:47.460
Let me just ask quickly, I know Hanukkah just finished up, so happy belated Hanukkah I suppose

08:47.460 --> 08:54.240
at this point, but I will say I will miss our annual Christmas gathering, because you

08:54.240 --> 09:00.980
and I historically have always gone out for Chinese food or pho, or whatever we can find

09:00.980 --> 09:06.940
that's open on Christmas, and we don't get to do that this year because of the situation.

09:06.940 --> 09:09.620
So I'll miss that this year.

09:09.620 --> 09:13.460
Totally, actually.

09:13.460 --> 09:15.020
I had a negative test.

09:15.020 --> 09:16.400
Oh, congrats.

09:16.400 --> 09:19.880
If y'all had negative tests, we can get some damn takeout.

09:19.880 --> 09:20.880
Maybe we'll see.

09:20.880 --> 09:21.880
We'll see.

09:21.880 --> 09:24.240
We can always eat outdoors or something if it's not too cold.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.240
Do something like that.

09:25.240 --> 09:26.240
Okay.

09:26.240 --> 09:27.240
It'll be fun.

09:27.240 --> 09:28.240
It's cold.

09:28.240 --> 09:29.240
All right.

09:29.240 --> 09:30.240
It is a little cold.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.240
All right.

09:31.240 --> 09:32.240
Let's get into video game stuff, though.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.380
Huge, big news this week.

09:34.380 --> 09:38.440
This is kind of shocking, honestly.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.800
And I think y'all know where this is going to go with Cyberpunk.

09:40.800 --> 09:46.540
Let's let Loki kick this off and state the obvious that is in the back of all your minds

09:46.540 --> 09:47.700
with this.

09:47.700 --> 09:51.580
So Cyberpunk's a little bit rough.

09:51.580 --> 09:59.280
So especially on the earlier gen consoles, so like a PlayStation 4 and Xbox One hasn't

09:59.280 --> 10:01.520
been running the best.

10:01.520 --> 10:02.520
And that was something that's been kind of...

10:02.520 --> 10:03.760
You're very nice.

10:03.760 --> 10:07.620
You're very nice.

10:07.620 --> 10:09.900
It looks like Saints Row.

10:09.900 --> 10:17.140
In fact, it's getting a lot of that Saints Row vibe from it.

10:17.140 --> 10:20.860
But yeah, so it hasn't been running good at all.

10:20.860 --> 10:23.180
And so they've actually come out.

10:23.180 --> 10:29.360
CG Prodigy Red has come out and actually apologized with their wonderful yellow text

10:29.360 --> 10:35.860
or yellow background text where they've said, first off, we would like to start by apologizing

10:35.860 --> 10:42.100
to you for not showing the game on the base of the last gen consoles before it premiered.

10:42.100 --> 10:46.060
And in consequence, we're not allowing you to make more informed decisions about your

10:46.060 --> 10:47.060
purchase.

10:47.060 --> 10:52.500
We should have paid more attention to making it play better on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

10:52.500 --> 10:53.500
Right.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.440
But you knew.

10:55.440 --> 10:58.900
And you also were advertising it in such a way.

10:58.900 --> 11:04.900
And you were also preventing people from being able to review it and showcasing that stuff

11:04.940 --> 11:05.940
as well.

11:05.940 --> 11:13.860
So yeah, it's a little hard to feel like that's a genuine apology, but whatever.

11:13.860 --> 11:17.700
I'm going to interject because we got a lot to unpack just in that two minutes, okay?

11:17.700 --> 11:18.780
We got a lot to unpack.

11:18.780 --> 11:22.220
So let's get our emotional baggage out here for a minute.

11:22.220 --> 11:23.220
Here's the thing.

11:23.220 --> 11:25.540
And I think this is important to state.

11:25.540 --> 11:28.660
For a lot of people, the game isn't broken.

11:28.660 --> 11:30.180
And I think that's important to put.

11:30.740 --> 11:35.020
It may be kind of broken, but in a Bethesda game way, or as you said, like a Saints Row,

11:35.020 --> 11:39.020
like there are character and Bobby showed examples of some of this on his show earlier

11:39.020 --> 11:42.400
because he used his clipping feature to show some of this stuff.

11:42.400 --> 11:46.580
For instance, characters that just walk right through lockers like they're not even there.

11:46.580 --> 11:50.580
Characters that run over street poles because fuck street poles and things like that.

11:50.580 --> 11:55.860
There's a lot of that stuff that's buggy, but otherwise the game is fine.

11:55.860 --> 12:02.420
If you are on a high-end PC, you're playing on Google Stadia, you're playing on Xbox Series X,

12:02.420 --> 12:09.020
you're playing on PlayStation 5, where we're running into some real tragedies are some

12:09.020 --> 12:13.460
people that are playing on PlayStation 4 and that are playing on Xbox One.

12:13.460 --> 12:17.980
Now, I do think it is important to make that distinction because I think there are a lot

12:17.980 --> 12:20.340
of people out there that are like, what's the problem?

12:20.660 --> 12:26.740
Well, the problem is that the game is not running the way people expected it to run

12:26.740 --> 12:30.260
for a game that was advertised for the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One.

12:30.260 --> 12:34.340
Here's where the problem gets really fucking complicated.

12:34.340 --> 12:39.100
So, Loki, that part you said there, they put out a yellow statement and all this thing

12:39.100 --> 12:44.740
and said, we should have realized that the game wasn't running up to speed or whatever

12:44.740 --> 12:47.860
it was on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

12:47.860 --> 12:49.980
Did I state that correctly?

12:50.020 --> 12:51.460
Is kind of what their line was?

12:51.460 --> 12:53.060
Yeah, yeah.

12:53.060 --> 12:54.340
You fucking knew.

12:54.340 --> 12:55.580
You fucking knew.

12:55.580 --> 13:00.100
And not only did they fucking know, they suppressed.

13:00.100 --> 13:01.820
And how did they suppress?

13:01.820 --> 13:06.660
When they sent out all these review copies, they told people, you have to play it on a high-end PC.

13:06.660 --> 13:11.620
They didn't give out any review codes for PlayStation or Microsoft.

13:11.620 --> 13:19.540
And they put out an NDA that said, you cannot show footage from this game.

13:19.540 --> 13:23.260
You must use our approved footage.

13:23.260 --> 13:26.060
And that should have been the first sign that something was up.

13:26.060 --> 13:32.460
Now, I think most of us kind of went, oh, it's because of this whole Day Zero patch they're doing.

13:32.460 --> 13:36.980
There's something really bad in the pre-patch stuff that they don't want out there.

13:36.980 --> 13:39.780
So they want to make sure that what's being shown is a patched version.

13:39.780 --> 13:42.980
I think that's what most of us wrote off that NDA as.

13:42.980 --> 13:47.500
But now we're seeing there was something way more sinister going on here.

13:47.500 --> 13:53.820
And what CD Projekt Red was really trying to avoid was the reception that Mass Effect Andromeda got.

13:53.820 --> 13:59.100
And I know I'm invoking the Holy Series of Mass Effect here, but I'm doing it for a reason.

13:59.100 --> 14:01.340
Why did that game get shit on?

14:01.340 --> 14:05.140
And I mean shit on just days before it released.

14:05.140 --> 14:12.460
Because EA stupidly put that buggy game out on that advance thing through EA.

14:12.460 --> 14:23.260
And all these people were ripping their own footage of heads spinning round, bodies flopping on the floor and all these things that made Andromeda look like a buggy ass mess.

14:23.260 --> 14:26.500
So everybody was like, I'm not buying that fucking game.

14:26.500 --> 14:32.140
Dark Sakura, I will ask your opinion here because you you follow the holy book of Mass Effect like I do.

14:32.140 --> 14:37.460
Isn't that kind of how Mass Effect Andromeda got screwed?

14:37.500 --> 14:41.380
You're muted just so you know, it's a hard mute on Discord.

14:41.380 --> 14:47.700
Um, kind of sort of because I don't think Mass Effect Andromeda had nearly the problems that Cyberpunk does.

14:47.700 --> 14:58.740
I agree. I actually I definitely agree with that statement, but it's actually a pretty it was actually a pretty finished game.

14:58.740 --> 15:04.740
It was lacking like a few touches, like the whole dead eyes thing and some of the dialogue choices.

15:04.740 --> 15:10.140
But for the most part, it wasn't super buggy, but the Internet fixated on those bugs.

15:10.140 --> 15:13.380
Right. And so the games there weren't many.

15:13.380 --> 15:18.540
Right. But Cyberpunk has plenty even on the high end.

15:18.540 --> 15:22.420
Right. And that's what CD Projekt Red was trying to hide.

15:22.420 --> 15:28.540
And that's my point is that those few bugs, when they got out, really tanked Mass Effect Andromeda's performance.

15:28.860 --> 15:38.460
You really I really can't be convinced that didn't impact the bottom line of of Andromeda and how it sold because of how people responded to that whole thing.

15:38.460 --> 15:45.060
I think there were other factors in there, just simply the fact that Bioware was putting more into Anthem at the time,

15:45.060 --> 15:53.700
and it wasn't continuing with everybody's favorite characters or their storylines, unlike what Dragon Age four is doing.

15:53.740 --> 15:59.940
So I think that might have been more part of it than just the aesthetics of it.

15:59.940 --> 16:04.940
Or, you know, it was it was all like too much, too new.

16:04.940 --> 16:08.300
And then on top of that, adding in just those minor things.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.460
Right. So on that on that, we agree.

16:10.460 --> 16:12.300
But I had something different going for it.

16:12.300 --> 16:18.900
Right. And I think we definitely have some common ground here because, yeah, no, I agree with you that Cyberpunk and I haven't played it.

16:18.900 --> 16:22.060
So that's why I feel a little bit hesitant to say something definitively here.

16:22.060 --> 16:27.060
But everything that I'm seeing online, all the reaction stuff is that it is a bug year game.

16:27.060 --> 16:29.700
And I do think so I agree with you on that, too.

16:29.700 --> 16:40.460
And I think the reason why I invoked Mass Effect Andromeda and the reception that it got with those bugs is that that was the situation CD Projekt Red was trying to avoid by saying you can't take your own video.

16:40.460 --> 16:42.180
You have to show this pre-approved video.

16:42.180 --> 16:49.900
You're not going to play it on PlayStation four and Xbox one because we know somebody knows this game doesn't run nearly as well on those platforms.

16:49.900 --> 16:56.860
So we are going to try to continue this hype for this game going and not shoot it in the foot.

16:56.860 --> 17:04.380
Like I think has been done in the past with other products when they released, you know, early for everybody to look at and then the warts and all kind of show up.

17:04.380 --> 17:11.580
And I think it caused this situation now to get worse because they tried to suppress that message.

17:11.580 --> 17:13.420
And it's the truth.

17:13.420 --> 17:15.580
It always comes out, girl.

17:15.580 --> 17:17.380
It always comes out.

17:17.380 --> 17:19.060
That should have been the first clue.

17:19.060 --> 17:25.620
I mean, the whole point of a review is honesty, I think it is.

17:25.620 --> 17:29.660
I mean, to the developers, it's the.

17:29.660 --> 17:42.180
OK, we want to sell our game and we want it to look a certain way, but the true heart of what a review is, is to say this is what product you are buying.

17:42.180 --> 17:46.820
So there's a difference between a review and a sponsorship.

17:46.820 --> 17:48.420
And they were looking for a sponsorship.

17:48.420 --> 18:03.460
Yes, and it's interesting because there was a piece I was reading out there that was being critical of organizations that ran the review with the NDA, calling them corporate sellouts and things like this that I don't agree with that strong of a message.

18:03.460 --> 18:08.460
I kind of think most of these review outlets gave you the tools you needed to figure it out for yourself.

18:08.460 --> 18:14.460
They were transparent in saying there was an NDA and that there was, you know, they couldn't show actual footage from the game.

18:14.500 --> 18:23.500
We assumed and I'll say we as part of that, too, because I remember saying it on the show that, oh, it's because of the day zero patch and they don't want to show like how bad it is.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.260
Little did we know it's much worse.

18:25.260 --> 18:29.140
I don't think the problem for that is with the journalists at all.

18:29.140 --> 18:44.420
That problem. And so I think I think people who are writing pieces like that, in my opinion, and you're not going to like this, but in my opinion, you got yourself to blame for setting up that kind of industry that requires day zero reviews.

18:44.420 --> 18:51.380
That, you know, feeds on Metacritic scores and my game is better than your game.

18:51.380 --> 19:04.380
And I think that's on you, person that writes that piece about how all of that is bad for creating that type of gaming industry that CD Projekt Red was just playing into.

19:04.380 --> 19:19.260
I'm not I'm not letting CD Projekt Red off the hook because I think ultimately at the end of the day, the only satisfactory end to this, the only satisfactory end to this is that the CEOs of CD Projekt Red are finished.

19:19.260 --> 19:23.180
They retire. That's they knew this was going on.

19:23.380 --> 19:24.820
They let the hype keep going.

19:24.980 --> 19:27.380
They put all these constraints on it as it was.

19:27.580 --> 19:31.020
They've got to go, period.

19:31.020 --> 19:32.700
Not gonna though. I mean, think about it.

19:32.860 --> 19:34.980
I, I, I don't dark soccer.

19:34.980 --> 19:37.820
I totally get the pessimistic perspective.

19:38.060 --> 19:46.100
I think the investors in Poland, because they are a publicly traded company in Poland, I think the investors are so pissed off.

19:46.260 --> 19:49.260
And at the end of the day, video games are making money.

19:49.540 --> 19:57.780
I think the investors are so pissed off about this whole situation that it is now I think it's on the table and good.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.060
It should be on the table.

20:00.060 --> 20:03.940
In my opinion, yeah, this is this sorry, sorry, Loki, I will let you finish.

20:03.940 --> 20:08.500
I know there's more to say, I was gonna say this is not the fault of the developers.

20:08.900 --> 20:11.500
This is not the fault of the artist.

20:11.700 --> 20:20.420
This is not the fault of the people that were working their asses off on crunch time to try to deliver this game that was promised.

20:20.740 --> 20:30.900
This was a fuck up of epic proportions by management, period.

20:30.900 --> 20:40.980
And to kind of go along with that also, there is a story out of Bloomberg that is actually talking about the developers asking the leadership, you know, what was going on?

20:40.980 --> 20:50.380
You know, basically saying that developers ask blunt questions about the company's reputation, the game's unrealistic deadlines and the relentless overtime in the months and years leading up to the game.

20:51.100 --> 20:52.540
December 10th release.

20:54.580 --> 21:05.660
So, you know, I don't know, it almost feels like like I get that I think releasing on so many platforms all at once was kind of a problem.

21:05.660 --> 21:19.780
And I know other consoles, games have done similar things where they've postponed certain versions of it, like say, for example, you know, PC pretty solid right now, maybe release on PC and delay the console a month.

21:20.700 --> 21:21.700
Would have been smart.

21:22.340 --> 21:23.620
Here's what would have been smart.

21:23.860 --> 21:25.380
Sorry, Loki. Here's what would have been smart.

21:25.820 --> 21:28.220
CD Projekt Red should have went to Google.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.100
The minute they knew this was going on, they should have went to Google instead.

21:31.380 --> 21:36.980
What if we made you an offer to be exclusive on Stadia and PC for six months?

21:37.580 --> 21:43.180
What if we made you that offer and then get the money from Google to go exclusive on Stadia?

21:43.180 --> 21:58.820
Because the game's fine on Stadia outside of the bugs, which is which is a whole other episode of OLR about here we are now that like Stadia has got its best use case scenario by a complete use case, by a complete fuck up of another organization.

21:58.940 --> 21:59.420
Right.

22:02.060 --> 22:03.660
Go ahead, Jamie, you've been trying to get away.

22:04.060 --> 22:21.340
I was going to make a point just a little bit before, but and actually, it also said it in chat is that this is a big reason why there needs to be unionization for our developers and for people who work in the gaming industry.

22:22.860 --> 22:24.460
Yes, 100 percent agree.

22:24.700 --> 22:31.260
This unions would have helped here, I think, quite a bit, especially when it came to the crunch time and things of that sort.

22:31.260 --> 22:31.980
Absolutely.

22:32.300 --> 22:37.660
So just be mindful, Jamie, if you're talking sideways on the mike, it doesn't pick up quite as much as when you're talking direct.

22:37.700 --> 22:38.220
Sorry.

22:39.700 --> 22:41.100
The chat, you can probably used to it.

22:41.220 --> 22:43.700
You can also probably just drop the pop guard if it's getting in the way.

22:43.780 --> 22:44.260
Oh, there you go.

22:44.260 --> 22:47.940
There we go, because I don't want to, you know, spew on everybody.

22:47.940 --> 22:48.860
So, yeah.

22:49.420 --> 22:49.820
All right.

22:50.220 --> 22:51.660
So Jamie's just got to get used to it.

22:51.660 --> 22:52.340
You guys in chat.

22:52.340 --> 22:53.260
She's got a whole new set.

22:53.260 --> 22:54.500
She's not using a headset anymore.

22:54.500 --> 22:58.700
She's using an adult microphone, just like the ones we had here.

22:58.700 --> 22:58.940
It's true.

22:58.940 --> 22:59.380
Oh, my gosh.

22:59.540 --> 23:00.740
OK, Loki, I'm sorry.

23:00.740 --> 23:03.860
We keep cutting you off, but this is a very passionate topic, isn't it?

23:04.780 --> 23:05.260
Sure.

23:05.660 --> 23:18.780
So aside from, you know, the obvious problems with the leadership, you know, some more stuff talking about like crunch, you know, they were being forced to work six hour day or I'm sorry, six days a week.

23:19.100 --> 23:28.740
And even more so after the games, you know, final delay, they were having even more crunch involved with that as well.

23:29.180 --> 23:38.020
And then, of course, we get word, you know, about them offering to refund the game if you're unhappy with your purchase.

23:38.020 --> 23:45.740
So they set up a email address that is open until, well, tomorrow, they're shutting it off.

23:45.740 --> 23:59.820
And also, apparently, you know, with that, because there were so many refunds being issued on the like PlayStation Store, Sony straight up pulled the game from the PlayStation Store.

23:59.820 --> 24:06.500
You can't buy it digitally anymore for right now until they sort this stuff out.

24:06.740 --> 24:08.940
So they went ahead and pulled it out.

24:08.940 --> 24:12.980
They said SIE strives to ensure a high level of customer satisfaction.

24:13.300 --> 24:19.820
Therefore, we will begin to offer full refunds for all the gamers who have purchased Cyberpunk 2077 via the PlayStation Store.

24:20.100 --> 24:26.180
And we will also be removing Cyberpunk 2077 from the PlayStation Store until further notice.

24:28.340 --> 24:35.060
It says once we have confirmed you have purchased Cyberpunk 2077 via PlayStation Store, we will process your begin processing your refund.

24:35.620 --> 24:42.700
And then, of course, along with that, later on, Xbox also followed suit.

24:42.700 --> 24:45.380
They brought or took it down off their storefront.

24:45.940 --> 24:58.060
Best Buy has said basically they're going to offer refunds on the physical copies via their in store by mail through December 21st, which apparently is when there's some sort of patch coming out.

24:58.060 --> 25:01.540
That's why it all seems to end on December 21st.

25:02.140 --> 25:05.620
And then. What else?

25:05.620 --> 25:17.420
So we also had a seizure product read saying that they are going to be offering some sort of refunds as well for players who are unable to secure one through the store which they purchased it.

25:17.900 --> 25:19.460
So that'll be limited as well.

25:20.460 --> 25:35.140
Also, apparently, the execs came out and apologized again as well, saying that they had ignored signals that the console versions that they hyped were in rough shape.

25:36.420 --> 25:46.140
The game launched way below expectations and they ignored the signals that more time was needed to make sure that the games are ready.

25:46.740 --> 25:49.940
It was the wrong approach and against our business philosophy.

25:49.940 --> 25:54.740
On top of that, during the campaign, we showed the game mostly on PC.

25:54.740 --> 25:59.540
We definitely did not spend enough time looking at PlayStation 4 and Xbox One performance.

25:59.940 --> 26:05.580
And this is coming from the vice president, Michael Nowakowski.

26:06.380 --> 26:14.420
And the reason we didn't show the game of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is that we were updating the game on last gen consoles until the very last minute.

26:14.620 --> 26:16.460
And we thought we'd make it in time.

26:16.660 --> 26:23.660
Unfortunately, this resulted in giving it to reviewers just one day before the release, which is definitely too late.

26:23.660 --> 26:26.660
And the media didn't get the chance to review it properly.

26:27.540 --> 26:34.260
Are we are they really blaming the reviewers for the low scores on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One?

26:34.260 --> 26:35.900
Because that's what sort of sounds like.

26:37.340 --> 26:38.980
They said that was not intended.

26:38.980 --> 26:41.820
We were just fixing the game up until the very last moment.

26:42.540 --> 26:47.780
And yeah, let me get some comments from chat here.

26:48.060 --> 26:58.140
Number one, and most importantly, the chat room is going bananas for Midna, which I think might be our first Dark Soccer's cat, Midna, showing up on stream during the show.

26:58.380 --> 27:04.180
But there's Midna in mommy's arms there getting some cuddles.

27:04.700 --> 27:12.460
Some other comments in chat talking about, even though Cyberpunk is no longer being sold on Sony Store, it is continuing to be sold on the Microsoft Store.

27:12.460 --> 27:19.260
And I've actually seen that myself, because in the rewards app, actually, you get a thing for visiting the Cyberpunk page.

27:19.380 --> 27:26.060
And there's a big old thing on there that says note may not currently run best on Xbox One.

27:26.060 --> 27:28.180
Like there's a big old like disclaimer on there.

27:29.020 --> 27:30.420
Hard to miss right now.

27:30.740 --> 27:32.660
I guess they're just doing refunds.

27:32.660 --> 27:41.300
I thought they were taking some funny thing that I did see online was folks complaining about the fact that if they did a refund that they still couldn't play the game.

27:41.300 --> 27:43.980
It's like, what do you think a refund is?

27:43.980 --> 27:45.260
You know, it's a game for free.

27:45.340 --> 27:47.420
That is that is that is what a refund is.

27:47.420 --> 27:49.140
You no longer have access to the product.

27:49.140 --> 27:50.460
Stop trying to game the system.

27:50.740 --> 27:51.740
That's not what it's worth.

27:52.020 --> 27:59.980
Yeah. So and Bobby Black Wolf in chat saying you can still buy the PlayStation 4 disc version.

28:00.140 --> 28:02.300
They thought it was a refund, but not a return.

28:02.340 --> 28:04.980
So, yeah, like don't game the system, guys.

28:04.980 --> 28:08.540
If you're playing the game and enjoying the game, the refund's not for you.

28:08.540 --> 28:09.500
So knock it off.

28:10.900 --> 28:19.180
But obviously, there's some people the part about that that gets me is that email that they're shutting off tomorrow.

28:19.420 --> 28:27.180
How convenient when copies of this game are going to be showing up under the tree for many people in four or five days.

28:27.420 --> 28:30.100
So that's kind of shady.

28:30.700 --> 28:34.420
Another bad decision among bad decisions, but it is what it is.

28:34.460 --> 28:41.500
Honestly, like I get I get people are unhappy with it, but like I think it will get better.

28:41.500 --> 28:46.460
I am hoping that it at least it's got at least it's not a live service game.

28:46.460 --> 28:48.100
So it's got that going for it.

28:48.500 --> 28:51.620
So I think it will get better.

28:51.620 --> 28:55.620
I'm hoping it will end up like a no man's sky where eventually it gets patched.

28:55.980 --> 28:58.580
It it really should not have been released this way.

28:58.580 --> 29:04.340
And it's it's frustrating to hear like almost every single major game release out there.

29:04.340 --> 29:10.140
Now we run into the same thing at launch, some cases much worse than others.

29:10.140 --> 29:14.420
But it's always like patching after the fact, releasing buggy games.

29:14.420 --> 29:18.460
It's like, do we not finish a game before releasing it?

29:18.460 --> 29:19.380
It doesn't make any sense.

29:19.700 --> 29:23.620
Maybe the shock and awe of this situation.

29:23.620 --> 29:27.780
And if the CEOs do get ousted by the board, which again, I hope it happens.

29:27.780 --> 29:28.580
I really do.

29:29.260 --> 29:30.780
I got my popcorn ready to go.

29:31.580 --> 29:35.100
But what I don't want to happen is I don't want the studio to go under.

29:35.100 --> 29:37.220
I do not want job loss at that studio.

29:37.220 --> 29:41.740
I do not want the developers to suffer the consequences and the artists and those that that

29:41.740 --> 29:43.260
is what I do not want to happen.

29:43.500 --> 29:46.420
This the cuts need to be made at the top.

29:47.660 --> 29:49.700
That is what has to happen in this situation.

29:49.820 --> 29:56.020
And I hope that other companies see this situation and go, oh, you know, maybe you're

29:56.020 --> 30:01.140
right, learn something from this and make sure this doesn't happen to future releases.

30:01.140 --> 30:04.300
Now, I will say this, Loki, when you we talk about the game being in a better state and

30:04.300 --> 30:09.340
everything again for me, when I do decide to get the game, when that, you know, game of

30:09.340 --> 30:14.100
the year edition with all the DLC and all that included, when I finally do buy it, Xbox

30:14.100 --> 30:18.980
Series X and PlayStation 5 will be the full on current generation by that point, because

30:18.980 --> 30:23.140
we'll be in two years in and the game runs fine on those.

30:23.540 --> 30:28.460
Well, so consider this, too, though, like the one version that you're playing right now on

30:28.460 --> 30:35.940
the Xbox Series X or whatever is just the Xbox one version that has some additional Xbox

30:35.940 --> 30:37.180
Series X enhancements.

30:37.260 --> 30:41.740
It's not the actual Xbox Series X or PlayStation five versions.

30:41.980 --> 30:43.780
Those are supposed to be coming out in March.

30:43.980 --> 30:47.100
So the game will be even better by March.

30:47.460 --> 30:53.660
It's just that if I think they were still trying to tune those for that additional, like

30:53.660 --> 30:57.620
compatibility with those new systems, but they forgot, it's like, oh, yeah, you know, you

30:57.620 --> 31:04.940
also have the base Xbox one, you know, or the Xbox one s, you know, the old stuff that

31:05.620 --> 31:07.300
might not run it as well.

31:07.340 --> 31:14.940
And it's we kind of saw this, you know, even way before the days of patching stuff, like we

31:14.940 --> 31:19.140
saw some games that would be released between these consoles, you know, back on like

31:19.540 --> 31:25.500
PlayStation two and PlayStation three and then Xbox 360 and like Xbox and all these

31:25.500 --> 31:30.300
different consoles, like releasing a nine different consoles, you know, and obviously

31:30.300 --> 31:35.020
some versions of the game would be good and some versions of the game would be very rough.

31:35.540 --> 31:39.540
Well, I remember a day when like Mortal Kombat came out on the Game Boy.

31:39.900 --> 31:43.620
And if you bought the Game Boy version of Mortal Kombat, you knew you were not going to

31:43.620 --> 31:49.500
get the same game that the people on the Super Nintendo like you knew, but they also

31:49.500 --> 31:50.540
didn't try to hide that.

31:50.860 --> 31:52.140
They didn't try to hide it either.

31:52.140 --> 31:58.820
You would see Game Boy screenshots in magazines and go, oh, that's a that's a scaled back

31:58.820 --> 31:59.780
version of that game.

31:59.980 --> 32:01.660
Right. And try to hide it.

32:01.660 --> 32:03.260
That's a huge, huge difference.

32:03.540 --> 32:05.220
I want to point out something in chat as well.

32:05.620 --> 32:08.780
Zen Monkey in chat says it's the full game, right?

32:08.780 --> 32:10.300
Nothing is missing. It's just buggy.

32:10.300 --> 32:12.340
So it's not a no man's sky, in my opinion.

32:12.540 --> 32:13.500
I agree with that.

32:13.660 --> 32:15.660
A lot of comparisons to No Man's Sky.

32:15.660 --> 32:17.620
I think these are hugely different scenarios.

32:17.820 --> 32:22.620
Now, I'm not just saying that because, yes, I'm a fanboy of No Man's Sky now.

32:23.020 --> 32:27.860
But I remember when that game came out, the problem with that game was not that it was a

32:27.860 --> 32:32.900
buggy, unplayable mess or that, you know, the problem in that game was that the hype

32:32.900 --> 32:35.220
machine got out of control.

32:35.460 --> 32:38.300
And it's what I'm calling the Molyneux effect.

32:38.460 --> 32:44.260
OK, it's the the Peter Molyneux effect, meaning I hyped the shit out of something I

32:44.260 --> 32:46.180
couldn't really deliver on.

32:46.380 --> 32:53.820
It didn't necessarily make the game bad fable, but the game was not exactly what we had

32:53.820 --> 32:56.300
promised. In fact, in many ways, it wasn't what we promised.

32:56.500 --> 33:00.460
But I remember when that came out, I remember go back to the episode when that game came

33:00.460 --> 33:03.860
out and I reviewed it and I said, it's not that bad.

33:04.100 --> 33:09.940
It's a little bit dry, but I think I enjoy this game more than most because I always

33:09.940 --> 33:13.340
questioned those speeches that they were giving when they were showing off the game.

33:13.500 --> 33:15.900
And I always was the one going, where's the game?

33:15.900 --> 33:18.780
What's the game? And I refused to buy into the hype with that game.

33:18.900 --> 33:21.820
Therefore, when the game came out, I was like, it's OK.

33:22.140 --> 33:26.180
And now we're in a spot years and years later where the game is better than OK.

33:26.180 --> 33:30.460
In fact, I would say it's a must play if you haven't played it yet, especially when it

33:30.460 --> 33:35.220
comes to Series X and PlayStation 5, assuming they ever fix that HDR thing.

33:35.220 --> 33:38.380
But Series X, for sure, it's a must play at this point.

33:40.140 --> 33:42.820
I think it's a very different sort of thing.

33:44.180 --> 33:48.700
But I'm not saying, oh, it wasn't a problem at all.

33:48.700 --> 33:50.260
No, it was a problem. It was a different problem.

33:51.780 --> 33:58.980
And I'm not even sure this CD Projekt RED, pardon me, Cyberpunk thing is as big of an

33:58.980 --> 34:00.700
issue as one other game I can think of.

34:01.020 --> 34:04.060
Actually, can I mention real quick, I know we want to get to other stories tonight.

34:04.060 --> 34:05.420
We don't want the show to run too long.

34:05.620 --> 34:10.020
I ran an informal poll on my Twitter account about this whole thing.

34:10.420 --> 34:12.420
So did you see my poll?

34:12.500 --> 34:13.620
Did you guys vote in my poll?

34:13.980 --> 34:15.500
OK, I did not see your poll.

34:15.540 --> 34:16.940
OK, here's the question I asked.

34:17.820 --> 34:22.100
Is Cyberpunk and Tigerclaw will find the link and post the poll because he usually

34:22.100 --> 34:24.140
does so I'm not putting them on the spot or anything.

34:24.300 --> 34:25.740
OK, here's the tweet I wrote.

34:25.740 --> 34:32.420
It said, is Cyberpunk 2077 the biggest failure of an organization's management and

34:32.420 --> 34:34.180
executives in video game history?

34:34.900 --> 34:37.420
And believe it or not, one hundred and seven people voted in my poll.

34:37.420 --> 34:39.020
So this is very scientific, you guys.

34:39.540 --> 34:40.900
Fifty three percent.

34:40.940 --> 34:42.340
Your question was quite loaded.

34:42.700 --> 34:44.380
Maybe. Well, here's the answer.

34:44.580 --> 34:46.660
Fifty three percent said yes.

34:47.500 --> 34:50.340
Forty seven percent said stop being dramatic.

34:52.020 --> 34:55.100
So there's people that do think it's pretty.

34:55.260 --> 34:58.660
Now, looking back and when I wrote that question, obviously it was very tongue in

34:58.660 --> 35:00.020
cheek. It was a tweet, you guys.

35:00.020 --> 35:01.100
It wasn't a scientific poll.

35:03.580 --> 35:12.900
I actually think Final Fantasy 14 1.0 was a bigger fuck up that was so bad, so bad that

35:12.900 --> 35:18.140
it almost killed an entire franchise dating back to like 1987.

35:20.020 --> 35:23.900
But there's there are things about this cyberpunk scenario that make it quite

35:23.900 --> 35:30.060
unique. And the good news is in Final Fantasy 14, they were able to fix it years

35:30.060 --> 35:34.980
after the fact. But the Final Fantasy 14 now is like not even the same game it was

35:34.980 --> 35:36.380
when it came out. That's how they fixed it.

35:36.380 --> 35:39.380
They just released a new game called Final Fantasy 14 that had some of the same

35:39.380 --> 35:40.540
ideas. So.

35:41.940 --> 35:47.580
So, Loki, now that you know the question, is this the biggest management fuck up and

35:47.580 --> 35:50.940
specifically management, is this the biggest management fuck up of no time of all

35:50.940 --> 35:52.620
time? Yes. Or stop being dramatic?

35:53.900 --> 35:55.420
Stop being dramatic.

35:56.940 --> 35:59.940
This isn't that. It could be worse.

36:01.380 --> 36:05.620
I mean, how like was it last year with WWE, their 2K game?

36:07.020 --> 36:08.140
I mean, that's pretty bad.

36:08.140 --> 36:12.620
And then on top of that, you know, they also want to charge for microtransactions.

36:13.980 --> 36:15.420
I mean, geez, it's like.

36:17.380 --> 36:21.460
Every few months we have one of these, so I don't think it's the worst anthem.

36:21.860 --> 36:26.180
I mean, Fallout 76, anyone?

36:26.500 --> 36:30.300
I mean, there's so many, so many to choose from.

36:32.100 --> 36:38.020
And yeah, looking looking back on it, I'm not sure it would be the biggest ever, but

36:38.060 --> 36:40.180
I think it's going to be one of the most memorable.

36:40.780 --> 36:42.700
I think Fallout 76 tops it.

36:42.740 --> 36:43.980
I mean, like that is just.

36:45.060 --> 36:46.500
How ironic. Look at my shirt I'm wearing.

36:46.540 --> 36:47.700
Do you see the shirt I'm wearing today?

36:49.260 --> 36:50.780
One mistake after another.

36:50.780 --> 36:53.900
I mean, it's like over and over and over again.

36:53.900 --> 36:56.540
And it's just like they can't do anything right.

36:57.540 --> 37:00.420
Anything like it was just all sorts of messed up.

37:00.420 --> 37:02.180
I don't know what the state is now.

37:02.180 --> 37:05.420
I'm assuming since I haven't heard about it in a while, it's slightly better.

37:05.420 --> 37:08.340
But like it was just all over the place.

37:08.780 --> 37:12.460
OK, of course, some comments and chat coming in on this.

37:12.460 --> 37:15.060
No one special says the virtual boy says hi.

37:16.060 --> 37:19.340
Let's see, S2100 Matt says this is an E.T.

37:19.340 --> 37:21.780
on the Atari that folks are treating this like.

37:22.060 --> 37:23.340
That is a great.

37:23.580 --> 37:28.060
You know what? I'm going to give a gold star chat comment of the week to that comment.

37:28.340 --> 37:29.500
I didn't even think of that.

37:29.700 --> 37:34.940
But that is also a brilliant example of how management fucked a game, because I know that

37:34.940 --> 37:39.500
Howard Scott Warshaw, who authored that game, worked his fucking ass off to deliver it in

37:39.500 --> 37:44.780
six weeks, because that's what management made him do, because that was the deal that

37:44.900 --> 37:48.420
was reached with Steven Spielberg and all that to get the game out for Christmas and

37:48.420 --> 37:49.220
all of that stuff.

37:49.420 --> 37:53.740
So I think you gave a real damn good example of something that's almost a bigger

37:53.740 --> 37:58.340
management fuck up because and then that game caused the video game crash of 1983.

37:59.020 --> 38:04.460
OK, maybe not directly, but things like that decision definitely caused the entire

38:04.460 --> 38:06.980
industry to kablamo.

38:07.020 --> 38:08.620
So let me let me offer something.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.220
This is going back to a previous point.

38:10.540 --> 38:12.060
Last comment on this and then we'll move on.

38:12.100 --> 38:16.780
Well, it's kind of a bigger commentary, but I want to offer up this thought.

38:16.780 --> 38:22.820
So we talked about, you know, if the industry had been unionized recently or that they

38:22.820 --> 38:29.980
should unionize, what if the industry had unionized prior to the 83 crash?

38:30.860 --> 38:34.500
Who would we be in a situation like this?

38:34.500 --> 38:38.220
What we have to deal? I mean, I still think we would have things like these, you know,

38:38.260 --> 38:46.140
got awful microtransactions or we'd we'd still have to see, you know, rushed releases.

38:46.140 --> 38:50.620
But the thing is, it's actually we may not see the rush releases because employees would

38:50.620 --> 38:54.620
be set for a certain number of hours, a certain number of privileges for the work they

38:54.620 --> 38:55.820
put into the game.

38:55.820 --> 39:01.740
And the the managers, the ones who were basically fucking shit up, they would be the

39:01.740 --> 39:06.300
ones who then go and then have to maintain those standards.

39:06.620 --> 39:08.660
So they would be held liable to it as well.

39:08.660 --> 39:11.260
And we might actually get more realistic development cycles.

39:12.900 --> 39:19.660
The other thing that I'm thinking of in this one, too, is that now this is you know, I've

39:19.660 --> 39:23.060
been putting a lot of thought to this and what you bringing up the crash really made me

39:23.420 --> 39:24.580
want to focus on it more.

39:26.700 --> 39:30.940
The other thing, too, is that just going into the social standpoint of working in the

39:30.940 --> 39:34.460
video game industry, we may not have some of the disparities that we have right now, too.

39:36.780 --> 39:41.180
I'm going to give a very blunt response to the question that you may think I'm joking,

39:41.180 --> 39:41.860
but I'm not.

39:42.860 --> 39:46.340
OK, no, I'm going to give you my very honest answer, and this is going to be something

39:46.340 --> 39:50.860
where you're like, I am not happy Rob said that, but it's it's the truth.

39:51.940 --> 39:59.460
If video game unions in 1983 meant that cocaine would be forbidden in the workplace, the

39:59.460 --> 40:01.580
industry would not be in the position it's at now.

40:02.620 --> 40:04.980
No, I I understand that.

40:04.980 --> 40:05.540
Trust me.

40:06.220 --> 40:08.460
Like that, that's real talk.

40:08.460 --> 40:14.500
Like if that meant there was no cocaine, folks, I'm just saying, how do you think those

40:14.500 --> 40:19.140
games got turned around in six weeks, like and the winners?

40:19.780 --> 40:22.300
Why do you think, OK, here we go.

40:22.380 --> 40:23.700
Hello, Pandora's box.

40:23.700 --> 40:24.580
We're going to open you.

40:24.580 --> 40:25.860
We're going to unpack some stuff.

40:25.860 --> 40:27.980
Hello, maybe in the US, Rob.

40:28.300 --> 40:32.420
Why do you think the video game industry then felt such an onus to put these things on

40:32.420 --> 40:37.900
their games about FBI warning winners don't use drugs and all this stuff in the 90s

40:37.900 --> 40:41.540
because the video game industry was born from drugs in the 80s?

40:41.540 --> 40:46.140
Like so much of it was like and again, I'm sorry, it's not the answer anyone wants to

40:46.140 --> 40:47.900
hear, but it's just the reality.

40:47.940 --> 40:53.180
So like I but I guess I'm not I'm not trying to just discredit your point, dark soccer.

40:53.220 --> 40:59.060
I just think like games were developed in such a different way in the 1980s versus the

40:59.060 --> 41:00.220
way they're done today.

41:00.460 --> 41:06.020
I'm actually I almost feel like the effect a union would have in the 80s would just have

41:06.020 --> 41:10.860
completely transformed everything like we wouldn't have E.T., we wouldn't have Yars

41:10.860 --> 41:13.540
Revenge, we would have any of it because we didn't have drugs.

41:13.580 --> 41:17.980
That's one thing. But I also do sort of think that and I'd actually have to dig more into

41:17.980 --> 41:22.980
that because now I'm curious as to the whole winners don't use drugs, you know, crack.

41:24.340 --> 41:29.540
But I'm thinking that maybe there might have been just some sort of subsidy or some sort

41:29.540 --> 41:30.940
of requirement for publishing.

41:30.980 --> 41:34.500
I have to look at what the jurisdiction was when all that was going down, because we

41:34.500 --> 41:41.580
don't see it anymore in our very few modern arcade releases that we happen to get.

41:42.100 --> 41:47.300
But it's sort of my thought that that might have been some sort of almost subsidizing

41:47.300 --> 41:51.300
like a like our current YouTube ads and crazy things like that.

41:51.300 --> 41:51.780
Make sense?

41:52.060 --> 41:53.140
Yeah, no, for sure.

41:53.300 --> 41:53.780
For sure.

41:53.980 --> 41:57.940
It was it was government subsidy to put a little bit more money into the entertainment

41:57.940 --> 41:58.980
industry. I don't know.

41:59.020 --> 42:01.220
That's that's a theory, a game theory.

42:03.140 --> 42:04.540
Hey, now they didn't pay for that ad.

42:05.220 --> 42:06.660
I know. I was joking.

42:06.660 --> 42:08.340
That's called parody.

42:08.780 --> 42:10.580
I know I can parody.

42:12.580 --> 42:15.180
All right. But anyway, you see what my point was.

42:15.180 --> 42:16.340
I do. I do know that.

42:16.340 --> 42:21.660
And that's why. But my brain instantly went to, well, you'd have that, but you wouldn't

42:21.660 --> 42:22.260
have this.

42:23.620 --> 42:28.940
No, I imagine they pass some eight balls around, you know, I'm just saying, you know,

42:28.940 --> 42:30.380
had a little line here and there.

42:30.380 --> 42:33.460
No, I've talked to some of those game developers.

42:33.460 --> 42:35.980
I know things, Rob.

42:36.060 --> 42:37.340
Yeah, I know. I know.

42:37.740 --> 42:43.300
So this is again, and the reason why I'm hesitant is as I don't want to sound like I'm

42:43.300 --> 42:46.260
glamorizing it or endorsing it or any of that stuff.

42:46.260 --> 42:47.420
I'm really not.

42:47.660 --> 42:53.780
But I also realize it is a very harsh reality about how we got from point A to point Z.

42:54.620 --> 42:57.500
So, yeah, no, right.

42:57.820 --> 43:01.380
It just makes me it's sort of those what ifs.

43:01.580 --> 43:03.100
No, I know. I get it. I get it.

43:03.460 --> 43:05.940
All right. Anyway, let's move on.

43:05.940 --> 43:12.260
Let's talk about our gaming weeks, whether it was, you know, affected by substances or

43:12.260 --> 43:13.340
not. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

43:13.540 --> 43:14.940
All right. How is your gaming?

43:14.940 --> 43:17.260
I sure was. I went on a bender this weekend.

43:18.900 --> 43:20.220
Dark Saga, how was your gaming week?

43:20.620 --> 43:22.460
I played something other than Animal Crossing, Rob.

43:23.060 --> 43:23.940
What?

43:24.540 --> 43:26.060
Well, I did play Animal Crossing.

43:26.100 --> 43:29.940
I mean, it's like the sufficient amount of my gaming time.

43:30.860 --> 43:35.700
But I played around on the Switch online store just trying to, you know, I was looking

43:35.700 --> 43:37.420
around to see what some of the SNES games were.

43:37.420 --> 43:40.700
And I found one of my favorite little shooters on there was just Poppin' Twendy.

43:41.260 --> 43:46.460
And I set it for wimp mode and just had a good time playing a couple of stages.

43:46.460 --> 43:48.140
You know, I was like, oh, I remember this.

43:48.140 --> 43:54.820
And then I remembered I sprained my thumb and so tapping repeatedly on that button to

43:54.820 --> 43:58.260
fire my weapons, you know, and I was like trying to remember what color the bells did

43:58.260 --> 44:04.740
what and realized that, you know, I don't like the the purple weapon as much as the

44:04.740 --> 44:07.900
green weapon. And but I had I had a good time playing.

44:07.900 --> 44:09.140
It was a sort of memories.

44:09.140 --> 44:14.780
You know, this was back from when I would have my SNES emulator and would, you know,

44:14.780 --> 44:21.100
download these ROMs because hello, who didn't and played, you know, these, you know.

44:22.060 --> 44:26.980
Japanese SNES games that never, Super Famicom games that never got released in the US.

44:27.420 --> 44:31.700
So there's a few others on there, there's Pano de Pon, which I might go back and play.

44:33.900 --> 44:38.100
There's Mario P-Cross, which I'm not a P-Cross fan, but, you know, there was there's a

44:38.100 --> 44:42.420
few other things on there that I was checking out and I might actually consider finishing

44:42.420 --> 44:48.940
my run through of Mother, but I found my my GBA somewhere.

44:49.220 --> 44:50.100
I don't know where it is now.

44:50.100 --> 44:58.020
Again, it vanishes it unearths itself like, you know, Internet trolls, but I'm considering

44:58.020 --> 45:04.380
playing my translated cart of Mother 3 because there's been like some discussion on it for

45:04.380 --> 45:07.180
this. I don't know if we're going to have this in there.

45:07.180 --> 45:08.260
I didn't see it in the show role.

45:08.260 --> 45:11.460
I might have overlooked it, but there was a whole thing about how Nintendo doesn't want

45:11.460 --> 45:13.740
to do games that evoke sadness.

45:13.740 --> 45:14.580
You can get into it.

45:14.580 --> 45:19.460
It that whole thing started like two minutes after I sent out the show role for tonight.

45:19.460 --> 45:21.300
So it's it's breaking news, if you will.

45:22.060 --> 45:26.860
Well, and one of one of my people I follow on there was saying, oh, now Mother 3 will

45:26.860 --> 45:32.140
never come out on on the switch for any of the releases or anything like that.

45:32.140 --> 45:39.820
And I was like, you know, maybe you're taking that out of context, but it did seem very.

45:41.020 --> 45:44.300
It's like the toxic positivity thing, does that make sense?

45:44.460 --> 45:44.900
Oh, yeah.

45:45.780 --> 45:51.860
And I'm like, you if you deny the bad that happens in your life, you can't appreciate

45:51.860 --> 45:55.500
the good as much or you're compartmentalizing it, you're not dealing with it.

45:55.780 --> 46:00.460
And I think Nintendo, given the fact that the games that they've had that have a vote

46:00.460 --> 46:04.420
for those emotions, do it so well and relatively safely.

46:05.540 --> 46:10.580
I think that that was a poor choice of something to say, does that make sense?

46:10.700 --> 46:10.980
Yep.

46:11.220 --> 46:13.580
Toxic positivity is what I call James Corden.

46:14.540 --> 46:15.180
Who?

46:15.820 --> 46:16.300
It's fine.

46:17.740 --> 46:22.980
OK, if that's a TV thing, I don't get it because I only watch Supernatural and it's

46:22.980 --> 46:23.300
gone.

46:23.420 --> 46:23.820
Kinda.

46:23.820 --> 46:24.260
It's all right.

46:24.980 --> 46:26.180
Anything else for your gaming week?

46:29.100 --> 46:29.740
Words.

46:30.300 --> 46:30.620
No.

46:31.820 --> 46:32.180
All right.

46:32.940 --> 46:33.980
Loki, how was your gaming week?

46:35.220 --> 46:35.980
It was OK.

46:35.980 --> 46:39.580
So I started off working on my game.

46:39.780 --> 46:46.100
I've been trying to research how to do animated tiles and haven't had a lot of luck.

46:46.220 --> 46:53.180
I did manage to create a really irritating flashing screen that animated tiles, but it's

46:53.180 --> 46:54.340
not the right way to do it.

46:54.820 --> 46:59.620
And so it's been a lot of research this week, not a whole lot being made in the game,

46:59.620 --> 47:01.820
just more just figuring out how to do stuff.

47:02.540 --> 47:06.180
But I'm realizing I'm getting to the point where, you know, I don't know if it's going

47:06.180 --> 47:08.620
to I'm going to figure it out.

47:08.860 --> 47:09.820
There is a way to do it.

47:09.820 --> 47:11.980
I just don't know how code wise.

47:11.980 --> 47:15.940
So I'll have to research some more, but I am probably going to work some more on the

47:15.940 --> 47:17.340
actual game and other parts.

47:17.780 --> 47:23.980
And then I've been playing some more Minecraft with my kids.

47:23.980 --> 47:26.060
So we've been playing on our realm.

47:26.060 --> 47:29.180
I've been trying to fix with some of the last updates I've done.

47:30.100 --> 47:35.860
It's broken some of my plugins a little bit, so I was trying to reload some stuff and

47:35.860 --> 47:43.700
update things, but man, like realms on Minecraft, they're just janky as hell.

47:43.700 --> 47:52.780
So they really don't respond well to updating plugins that are in there or add ons into

47:52.780 --> 47:53.260
the game.

47:53.340 --> 47:59.580
So you have to, I don't know, like I've tried so many times just to like add one more

47:59.580 --> 48:03.500
plugin on there and I've removed like several of them, but it's just sometimes they'll

48:03.500 --> 48:07.220
just time out or refuse to load or whatever the case may be.

48:07.220 --> 48:16.740
So it's, it's just been a struggle, but still built the castle and helped my son with

48:16.740 --> 48:18.060
some redstone stuff.

48:18.340 --> 48:20.460
So we've been just doing that, just messing around.

48:20.860 --> 48:21.220
Nice.

48:21.780 --> 48:23.820
And a little bit of hornet.

48:24.820 --> 48:26.340
How's Pixel Poops coming along?

48:27.260 --> 48:31.180
Well, that's what I was saying, you know, with Pixel Poops, I've been just researching

48:31.180 --> 48:39.900
how to do animated tiles in the nest because it's a lot harder than I, well, everything's

48:39.900 --> 48:48.380
hard with the NES, but so I was trying to find a way to just up, you know, reload tile

48:48.380 --> 48:48.980
sets and stuff.

48:48.980 --> 48:52.140
So they'd swap it out, but it takes too long to do that.

48:52.380 --> 48:55.940
And so that's where I was getting that weird flickering effect.

48:55.980 --> 48:59.420
I think I posted it on Twitter just to show like the animated tiles.

48:59.460 --> 49:05.420
Maybe I just mentioned it, but so now there's another method that you can do that, which

49:05.420 --> 49:07.060
is updating the name table.

49:07.060 --> 49:09.780
But in order to do that, I have to read from the name table.

49:09.780 --> 49:16.340
And that's also tricky as well, because it's in the the picture processing unit when you're

49:16.340 --> 49:16.780
doing that.

49:16.780 --> 49:21.780
It's just, it's so complicated, but I may just give up on the animated tiles and just

49:21.780 --> 49:23.900
move on with creating more assets for the game.

49:24.780 --> 49:30.020
So I'll probably end up doing that and the other things I want to implement.

49:30.020 --> 49:32.260
But I really would like animated tiles.

49:32.260 --> 49:35.340
It would really look nice, but leave it and come back to it later.

49:35.340 --> 49:37.820
You know, maybe I'll have a breakthrough somewhere else that leads to that.

49:37.940 --> 49:39.020
That's what I've been doing.

49:39.020 --> 49:43.900
It's just been just trying to understand how things work in the NES and how it loads up

49:43.900 --> 49:44.420
and everything.

49:44.420 --> 49:47.620
So but yeah, I'll come back to it probably.

49:48.020 --> 49:50.220
OK, my gaming week.

49:50.220 --> 49:52.540
So nothing really new.

49:52.540 --> 49:55.740
I've been continuing on with a lot of things I've been talking about here on the show,

49:56.180 --> 49:58.060
continuing on with Dragon Quest 11.

49:58.820 --> 50:03.820
I'm even further into that game, probably like 25 hours in at this point, getting making

50:03.820 --> 50:04.460
progress on that.

50:05.220 --> 50:10.660
And then I was playing quite a bit of Pokemon Go slash Ingress slash Orna, like all the GPS

50:10.660 --> 50:10.900
games.

50:10.900 --> 50:14.980
I was doing a lot of that yesterday just because, you know, it's Saturday.

50:14.980 --> 50:17.420
I didn't have much to do, so I was like, well, let me go walking.

50:17.420 --> 50:19.220
I'm going to go on some hikes, some adventure.

50:19.460 --> 50:23.180
I'm going to go get some hard to get portals that take, you know, like one of them.

50:23.180 --> 50:27.700
I had to do like a mile and a half walk in a mile, half walk back, you know, but that's the

50:27.700 --> 50:30.260
type of stuff where I needed the motivation.

50:30.900 --> 50:36.700
And then, of course, since I was doing Pokemon Go with that, I was like, I don't think I

50:36.700 --> 50:38.020
should do this Mr.

50:38.020 --> 50:41.940
Rhyme event because they want eight bucks so you can catch a particular.

50:42.140 --> 50:47.620
But I did it because I'm a sucker and consumer whore and how Mr.

50:47.620 --> 50:52.660
Consumer Whore and but I was like, you know what, I'm so bored and this is like a little

50:52.660 --> 50:55.380
incentive to go outside and do some stuff and walk around.

50:55.380 --> 50:56.660
And I do like Mr.

50:56.660 --> 50:56.980
Rhyme.

50:56.980 --> 50:57.660
He's really funny.

50:58.420 --> 51:03.900
So I was like, whatever, even though I'm sure he will be obtainable in the game in like three

51:03.900 --> 51:07.580
months because that's what they did with Genesect and some of the other releases that they did

51:07.580 --> 51:08.420
in a similar way.

51:09.020 --> 51:11.500
But but but I also don't know because Mr.

51:11.500 --> 51:18.820
Rhyme, the base one from Gen one has been a region exclusive to the UK, and we haven't been

51:18.820 --> 51:23.780
able to get that here until they did an event here at one point where you were able to get that

51:23.780 --> 51:27.620
and Kangaskhan, like you're able to get all the exclusives pretty easy during that event.

51:28.220 --> 51:31.260
Yeah, you probably played during that event or maybe you traded whatever.

51:32.020 --> 51:36.980
But I don't know if they're going to maybe do the Galarian one differently when they release it

51:36.980 --> 51:37.500
or what.

51:37.740 --> 51:39.500
So, yeah.

51:39.500 --> 51:41.300
So I was like, whatever.

51:41.300 --> 51:45.660
I didn't feel great about endorsing Niantic doing that, but I was really bored.

51:45.660 --> 51:46.620
So forgive me.

51:48.060 --> 51:51.100
Otherwise, how many things do you get away with just because you're bored?

51:52.140 --> 51:52.700
Murder?

51:53.340 --> 51:54.180
Why did you kill him?

51:54.180 --> 51:54.940
I was bored.

51:55.300 --> 51:55.620
All right.

51:57.060 --> 51:57.980
But a serious note.

51:57.980 --> 52:03.780
So kind of speaking of Pokemon, I think I talked about this on a previous episode, but like I kind of

52:03.780 --> 52:05.380
played even more of it this week.

52:05.380 --> 52:07.940
I've been playing a lot of Pokemon Shield.

52:08.180 --> 52:11.260
My save file is up to almost 60 hours at this point.

52:11.420 --> 52:17.940
And that's because of Pokemon Home and kind of unveiling that central dex kind of motivated me to.

52:18.100 --> 52:23.140
And here's the shocking thing about this whole like Rob is suddenly super into the Pokemon

52:23.140 --> 52:23.980
mainline games.

52:24.460 --> 52:25.900
This isn't a shame thing.

52:26.180 --> 52:29.460
And this might shock you like, wait, wait, wait.

52:29.540 --> 52:31.220
He didn't bully you into this somehow?

52:31.220 --> 52:36.420
No, like, actually, I don't think he really believes that it's happening.

52:37.420 --> 52:42.860
In some ways, but my dex in Shield is up to like 310.

52:43.300 --> 52:48.300
At this point, I have a spreadsheet tracking everything I need to get and how I get it and the

52:48.300 --> 52:51.940
ones I need to level up and the ones I need to trade with somebody.

52:52.060 --> 52:57.540
I've been using Pokemon Home to do some of the trades like Lunatone is in Shield, but

52:57.540 --> 52:58.900
Solrock is in Sword.

52:59.020 --> 53:04.500
So I traded that in Home and you even get stickers for doing some of that stuff for your

53:04.500 --> 53:05.140
profile.

53:05.140 --> 53:10.580
And so it's I don't know what finally set me off on the mainline Pokemon games.

53:11.980 --> 53:18.940
But I guess Home and Quarantine and Pokemon Go kind of affecting the mainline games that

53:18.940 --> 53:24.620
regard kind of all just suddenly gave me this incentive where I'm like, I am going to

53:24.620 --> 53:25.420
catch them all.

53:25.940 --> 53:26.620
Yes, I am.

53:26.620 --> 53:27.860
Just like I'm going to do it.

53:27.860 --> 53:29.860
I'm going to catch them all this time.

53:30.660 --> 53:32.060
So that's what I've been working on.

53:32.220 --> 53:34.580
No DLC until I catch them all.

53:34.820 --> 53:35.660
That is my rule.

53:36.700 --> 53:41.180
So maybe in a couple of weeks on the show, once I've caught them all, I will get into the

53:41.180 --> 53:42.700
DLC and all that stuff.

53:42.900 --> 53:44.580
So, all right.

53:44.700 --> 53:45.300
But that's yeah.

53:45.300 --> 53:46.820
So I've been spending a lot of time on Pokemon.

53:48.220 --> 53:48.940
Weird, right?

53:49.460 --> 53:49.900
All right.

53:50.660 --> 53:51.140
Let's see.

53:51.300 --> 53:55.660
Sia Tabiri in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says, Rob, catch him right here, folks.

53:55.980 --> 53:57.140
I guess.

53:57.380 --> 53:59.460
I mean, it only took how many years?

54:00.460 --> 54:04.860
Isn't Pokemon having like its 20th anniversary, no, 25th anniversary right now.

54:05.500 --> 54:06.020
All right.

54:06.700 --> 54:08.580
Anyway, let's move on.

54:08.620 --> 54:10.220
We got a lot of news to get into.

54:10.220 --> 54:12.260
We've been talking a lot, so let's get to it.

54:12.260 --> 54:14.900
Loki, other big news and announcements this week.

54:15.580 --> 54:15.940
Yeah.

54:15.940 --> 54:20.900
So they had this cool Nintendo Direct covering the Indies again.

54:20.900 --> 54:27.020
So this Indie World Showcase and during their like 15 minute live stream, they had, uh,

54:27.780 --> 54:29.980
several different games that they talked about.

54:30.380 --> 54:35.700
So some of the more notable stuff, obviously, uh, we had a Super Meat Boy Forever.

54:35.700 --> 54:39.860
It's going to be, uh, exclusive to the Switch on December 23rd.

54:40.380 --> 54:47.940
Uh, also there was, um, Fist of Fluffs, which is a physics based, uh,

54:47.940 --> 54:49.140
cat fighting game.

54:49.140 --> 54:50.180
So that was kind of fun.

54:50.580 --> 54:57.780
Um, there's also a course, uh, very, very valet, which reminds me of like those,

54:57.820 --> 55:05.860
um, how like the, the cooking games that they have, um, where it's like a cooking

55:05.860 --> 55:10.420
party game, so that's supposed to be coming out early 2021, like overcooked

55:10.460 --> 55:14.620
those games, yeah, like overcooked, but like parking it's like that.

55:14.620 --> 55:19.300
Or, um, there was another one with also like moving, um, boxes and stuff.

55:19.700 --> 55:24.180
It's a similar type of kind of, uh, chaotic, uh, four player co-op type thing.

55:24.380 --> 55:26.900
So that's, uh, a valet game that's going to be coming out.

55:27.340 --> 55:33.220
And, um, Cyber Shadow, which looks a little like, it looks like it took a

55:33.220 --> 55:37.460
little too many cues from Ninja Gaiden, but it's like a cyberpunk, uh, Ninja

55:37.460 --> 55:40.580
Gaiden game, and that's coming out, uh, January 26th.

55:40.900 --> 55:43.700
There was, there was another game I played recently cause it was on, is

55:43.700 --> 55:44.700
it the last messenger?

55:44.700 --> 55:45.380
Is that the game?

55:45.820 --> 55:48.140
There's some game on a Xbox game pass.

55:48.460 --> 55:52.900
It's it is straight up, not even shy that it's like a Ninja Gaiden game.

55:52.940 --> 55:53.140
Yeah.

55:53.140 --> 55:55.500
Well that one, that one's like a Ninja Gaiden game.

55:55.500 --> 56:01.420
This one, like the sprites look almost identical and the cut scenes really

56:01.420 --> 56:03.300
resemble the original cut scenes.

56:03.340 --> 56:08.940
In fact, like I would almost say that they were copied, but it's not, it's,

56:08.940 --> 56:14.300
it's very like, like if you were, if you were to show someone that in like,

56:15.300 --> 56:18.540
they may think it's a Ninja Gaiden sequel, like from the original NES.

56:18.540 --> 56:18.860
But anyways.

56:18.860 --> 56:21.060
And Act F says it is the messenger.

56:21.300 --> 56:22.060
I added another one.

56:22.060 --> 56:22.940
Yeah, the messenger.

56:22.940 --> 56:23.140
Yeah.

56:23.140 --> 56:23.740
I remember that one.

56:23.740 --> 56:26.180
So, um, what else?

56:26.460 --> 56:32.740
Of course, uh, the very big announcement was that, uh, that Among

56:32.740 --> 56:36.620
Us is going to be out that day on the Switch.

56:36.700 --> 56:38.020
So that's pretty cool.

56:38.500 --> 56:41.220
Um, some other cool stuff that they're showing off as well.

56:41.340 --> 56:43.020
Uh, going back to Cyber Shadow real quick.

56:43.020 --> 56:48.540
So, um, if you scan your amiibo for Shovel Knight, it also adds like a power

56:48.540 --> 56:49.820
up to the game, which is kind of neat.

56:50.460 --> 56:56.660
They showed off also, uh, this game called Alba, the wildlife adventure,

56:56.780 --> 57:02.220
which is kind of more of like a calming, uh, you know, not Pokemon snap, but it's

57:02.220 --> 57:03.700
a game where you take pictures of wildlife.

57:03.780 --> 57:05.740
I know there's like another game they're showing off for like the

57:05.740 --> 57:07.220
PlayStation four is kind of similar.

57:07.620 --> 57:10.580
So there's that, um, yeah.

57:11.260 --> 57:11.460
Yeah.

57:11.460 --> 57:14.900
So lots of cool indie games that were being shown off there.

57:15.660 --> 57:21.060
And, uh, uh, Tunchi, or I think that's how to spell that Tucci or Tunchi, uh, which

57:21.060 --> 57:27.580
was a 2d beat him up game that's set in the Amazon reinforce also has, um, the

57:27.580 --> 57:29.500
character from hat and time in there as well.

57:29.940 --> 57:37.500
And yeah, so lots of cool stuff to be, I mean, I like how they do showcase their

57:37.500 --> 57:41.980
Indies every, almost every month or every few months, at least every month, we're

57:41.980 --> 57:45.860
getting one of those and the, the among us thing of course, was, was big news

57:45.860 --> 57:47.780
because, uh, you know, just how big that game is.

57:48.100 --> 57:52.460
Um, it is kind of interesting though, that even they kind of suggest that, you

57:52.460 --> 57:54.660
know, you use a voice chat app.

57:54.980 --> 57:55.940
To use it, which is interesting.

57:55.940 --> 57:58.860
They don't even say use the Nintendo app and probably because they don't

57:58.860 --> 58:02.380
let the third parties use the direct Nintendo app to do voice chatting.

58:02.660 --> 58:05.260
Um, but they suggest using a voice chat app.

58:05.580 --> 58:07.860
I wonder if it's interesting cross-play.

58:08.540 --> 58:12.620
I, I don't know what they have this version coming out and then there's

58:12.620 --> 58:14.380
the one that's on games fast.

58:14.660 --> 58:19.020
I wonder if this is all cross-play like PC and, uh, I think PC and Android

58:19.020 --> 58:22.180
and stuff are all cross-play as well.

58:22.500 --> 58:23.220
As far as I know.

58:23.220 --> 58:23.540
Yes.

58:23.540 --> 58:23.900
I'm waiting.

58:23.900 --> 58:27.100
I'm hoping somebody in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network will let us

58:27.100 --> 58:29.900
know because I do see a couple of people are saying that they picked up the game

58:29.900 --> 58:30.740
on switch this week.

58:30.740 --> 58:32.860
So I'm curious if they played with people on PC.

58:33.060 --> 58:34.900
I don't see why it wouldn't be cross-play.

58:35.140 --> 58:35.580
Uh, okay.

58:35.580 --> 58:37.300
And act F confirming it is cross-play.

58:37.700 --> 58:38.260
Oh, that's good.

58:38.500 --> 58:39.300
Yeah, that's very good.

58:41.100 --> 58:41.540
All right.

58:42.020 --> 58:45.460
Um, so moving on, let's talk about some other big news that came out this

58:45.460 --> 58:50.340
week because it's not often you see Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft all

58:50.340 --> 58:52.220
coming together to make a statement.

58:52.460 --> 58:56.020
So this was everybody getting together to make one statement.

58:56.020 --> 58:57.860
Now, how often do you get that in the gaming industry?

58:57.860 --> 58:58.860
Not very often.

58:59.060 --> 59:01.140
And that's kind of what made this newsworthy.

59:01.380 --> 59:06.540
Now, uh, it was posted on the official X-Box website, the X-Box, uh, newswire.

59:06.820 --> 59:11.140
Um, so I don't know if that indicates that they started the conversation or what.

59:11.340 --> 59:15.220
It could also just be that they have, you know, um, the, or they were the first to

59:15.220 --> 59:16.660
get out the press release or whatever.

59:16.660 --> 59:17.140
I don't know.

59:17.460 --> 59:22.460
But anyway, uh, it is a statement basically about, uh, kind of reaffirming

59:22.460 --> 59:24.660
that, uh, gaming is for everybody.

59:25.060 --> 59:30.260
And we need to basically take efforts to have a shared commitment to safer gaming

59:30.260 --> 59:30.860
for everybody.

59:30.900 --> 59:33.980
So that was kind of nice to see coming from all of those companies.

59:34.180 --> 59:38.500
Um, so it was a very long, uh, kind of, uh, statement with this, but it was nice to

59:38.500 --> 59:39.500
see them all come together.

59:39.700 --> 59:42.260
Let me try to get some of the highlights from this statement here.

59:42.620 --> 59:46.580
We believe gaming is for people of all ages, including our youngest and most

59:46.580 --> 59:47.500
vulnerable players.

59:47.780 --> 59:50.820
Technology makes compelling entertainment experiences possible, and we want to

59:50.820 --> 59:54.500
ensure that those experiences, especially when they involve interaction with others

59:54.500 --> 59:56.460
are positive and respectful.

59:56.980 --> 01:00:02.220
Um, at Xbox, we are aligned with both Nintendo on behalf of the community of

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:06.220
Switch players and PlayStation in our belief that protecting players online

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:10.660
requires a multi multidisciplinary approach, one that combines the benefits

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:14.860
of advanced technology, a supportive community, and skilled human oversight.

01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:19.380
We can accomplish more when we work toward the same goal, and so we will each

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:23.660
continue investing in evolving and amplifying our approaches to user safety.

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:27.860
As we continue this work, we will prioritize protecting the safety of our

01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:30.020
players, especially those most vulnerable.

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:33.460
And then they get into principles that will guide their work.

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:38.620
The first one is prevention, letting players control or letting, uh, providing

01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:41.420
controls that will let players customize their gaming experience.

01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:46.700
Uh, safety features have to be easy to use, inform play parents and players

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:50.740
through code of conduct, terms of use, investing in technology to thwart

01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:51.780
improper conduct.

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:54.220
I'm very much summarizing these bullet points for time.

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:58.620
Uh, partnership, uh, partnering with the industry regulators and law

01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:03.540
enforcement, uh, reinforcing a commitment to safety, um, working with industry

01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:07.820
trade organizations, including and law enforcement and experts, uh, for advanced

01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:12.660
online safety initiatives, uh, shared research between the big three, for the

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:16.860
better of the industry, we believe that hate and harassment or exploitation of

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:19.540
younger players in any way have no place in gaming.

01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:22.420
Um, and then responsibility.

01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:26.540
We will hold ourselves accountable for making our platforms as safe as possible

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:30.820
for all players, making it easy for players to report violations of the code

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:35.620
of conduct and removing content and enforcement actions for violation,

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:42.180
complying with local laws, publishing rules and requirements, and, um, basically

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:47.780
re-restating that the partnership of to work together, uh, is, is going to help

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:52.500
everybody and, and protect, uh, children and so forth, uh, and that working

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.020
together, they'll accomplish more than alone.

01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:59.380
So then why don't they also take the same approach and apply it toward, uh, their

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:03.460
studios, toward their employees, treating other employees properly and making a

01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:04.420
safe working environment?

01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:06.820
Uh, great question.

01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:12.820
And I think to be fair, I feel like, uh, specifically Microsoft who put out this

01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:17.500
original release, I feel like, and unfortunately I don't have the, the press

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:21.260
release to back, I feel like they have made that kind of commitment previously.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:24.940
And when we hear about some of these, uh, studios that are, you know, work to the

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:27.900
bonus, it's not usually coming out of Microsoft.

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:35.260
Um, and some of the Sony stuff too, but then of course we all heard about the,

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:40.460
the last of us part two crunch time, but that was naughty dog who is not, are they

01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:40.940
specific?

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:42.060
Are they owned by Sony?

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:47.420
But my, my thought is I get what you're saying though, but beyond that, not

01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:49.980
just internal in their studios, but the fact that they work with some of these

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:55.980
studios that have some atrocious, uh, gender issues and, uh, just bigotry in

01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:56.860
their studios.

01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:02.060
Um, I would think that they would also want to apply that standard to, uh, well,

01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:07.580
if they were being truly adhering to that standard, that they would want to also,

01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:13.340
uh, not work with companies until they've also committed to it in house and out of

01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:13.660
house.

01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:14.620
Does that make sense?

01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:15.180
Yeah.

01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:17.260
And Bob coffee confirming they are Sony owned.

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.940
Sorry, I'm having a brain fog moment.

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:23.820
I'm just, I'm kind of, why don't they fall under that same, but anyway, forget it.

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:29.020
Um, some also some folks in chat noting that swap note got an update this week,

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:32.540
which is relevant to the conversation because Nintendo had patched that because

01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:35.180
of the whole, you know, kids getting exposed to stuff.

01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:35.980
So weird.

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:37.580
So yeah, no, I'm with you, dark soccer.

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:41.100
This, this strikes me as a, um, this is, this is nice.

01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:43.420
This is a nice message.

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:47.260
This is, this is a good, um, guiding principles document.

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:50.780
Now back it up right now.

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:55.100
Now, you know, show the action that backs it up, that it's not just words,

01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:59.820
but it is nice that the three of them are, are putting a unified front on this.

01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:00.460
That's for sure.

01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:01.580
Cause you don't see that every day.

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:03.100
I'll give it that.

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:05.260
All right.

01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:08.460
Well, with, with that, let's move on to our next story.

01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:10.700
Speaking of kids, kinda.

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:15.900
Well, um, China has made some changes.

01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:20.060
They didn't really have a formal age rating system for video games.

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:25.420
Whereas here in the U S and in Canada, we've had ESRB and, uh, Europe has

01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:28.060
had the Peggy system PGI.

01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:35.180
And so they have a new system that was, uh, put together by, uh, I believe

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:41.820
Nico partners that is, uh, one of six measures proposed by the China

01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:44.220
state administration of press and publications.

01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:49.420
Um, I'll go into the other proposals in a moment, but this system is

01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:53.340
supposed to strengthen their current regulation, uh, uh, around minors

01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:55.100
to prevent video game addiction.

01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:59.580
So now they have, um, and it's been through 41 revisions according to this.

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:04.540
So, uh, it looks like they are being rated eight plus, which is green 12

01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:06.940
plus blue 16 plus yellow.

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:09.740
The 18 plus rating is gone.

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:11.820
We don't know what happened to it.

01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:14.540
I think it graduated and left the house.

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:20.940
But at any rate, um, uh, publishers have to display the relevant age

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:25.740
rating on the game's website, the login screen and other materials,

01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:28.140
including box art manuals, stuff like that.

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:34.060
Um, now in other news, um, and this kind of goes along with it.

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:39.020
Um, other proposals that have gone with this are real name identification

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:41.900
systems, which we know how the fuck that works for people.

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:49.340
Um, playtime cap for minors, uh, the limit spending that a minor can,

01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:53.260
can spend in online games, uh, other options to work with parents and

01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:55.820
schools, and then working with local regulators.

01:05:56.780 --> 01:06:03.980
So, um, the quote, uh, that the, uh, analyst firm, uh, said is that, uh,

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:08.300
they don't expect any measures to have quote a material impact on game

01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:12.220
publisher earnings and growth, especially since miners are a lower

01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:13.500
percentage of spenders.

01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:17.820
Yeah, but who buys the games for the miners?

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:19.660
Just saying.

01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:25.100
So, yeah, it's, it's interesting to see how it plays out.

01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:32.140
I mean, in China also has a fairly, um, stringent system anyway, especially

01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:34.300
with how they censor things.

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:40.700
Um, I guess it might make more sense for there.

01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:45.660
I, you know, and I don't, I, I certainly understand wanting to, um, do playtime

01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:50.940
caps to limit the spending, but should that not be the parent's job?

01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:58.300
But then again, China has a lot more hands-on approach to, uh, their

01:06:58.300 --> 01:06:58.860
population.

01:06:58.860 --> 01:06:59.360
Mm-hmm.

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:04.940
I was, I was interested, I thought it was interesting.

01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:09.820
They didn't already have a rating system similar to, you know, yeah, they did.

01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:11.820
It just wasn't an official system.

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:14.300
It was like a suggestion.

01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:16.620
Like a suggested system.

01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:17.120
Got it.

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:22.940
So, well, technically, I guess technically the, the stuff we see with the ratings here

01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:27.340
isn't like a government mandated system, but it was a system that the industry had

01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:30.860
to come up with or else the government was going to come up with its own system,

01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:33.900
which we know would have been terrible because it was the government's.

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:36.620
So it was, yeah, it was kind of that sort of situation.

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:41.500
So technically the rating system we have here is kind of unofficial, but then I guess

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:45.500
we've also tried to see where they've built laws around it too.

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.260
It's industry official.

01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:51.340
So I do consider it to be official, just not federally mandated.

01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:51.840
Yeah.

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:56.700
However, there wasn't any sort of uniform system.

01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:59.260
They had like, I believe it was a generalized system.

01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:02.780
Maybe it was a little bit more uniform, but I think now they are working specifically

01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:07.900
with the government because we've seen other stories come out of Japan with, you

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:13.180
know, gaming cafes and kids, you know, spending their parents' money and other

01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:13.980
things like that.

01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:20.220
And, you know, I know that, of course, under that regime, they've got many

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:24.060
different, I'm trying to be as diplomatic about this as possible.

01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:24.620
I gotcha.

01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:32.300
Different things culturally and legislatively that are playing into a decision to have

01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.060
this be nationally mandated.

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:34.560
Yeah.

01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:37.660
And, and I don't live there.

01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:43.900
I don't really know many people who live in China who are gamers who operate under these systems.

01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:50.380
You know, I have personally seen an IQ once in my life, in real life, which we know what

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:51.020
IQ is.

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:53.820
It was Nintendo's way of releasing games in China.

01:08:55.420 --> 01:09:01.260
But overall, it's, I mean, maybe it's a good thing.

01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:01.820
We'll see.

01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:09.660
I mean, I think that the over here, if parents actually paid attention to the ESRB ratings,

01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:13.340
then there'd be probably fewer complaints.

01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:18.780
But, but I don't know.

01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:22.140
We'll see if we have any listeners in China.

01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:26.700
I don't know if we do or how, let us know how, how the system works over there.

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:28.620
I'd be very curious to know more about it.

01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:29.840
For sure.

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:31.200
All right.

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:35.360
Well, let's move on to some big changes over here.

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:35.860
Loki.

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:37.060
Yeah.

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:43.520
So apparently there was, um, Codemasters was looking to be purchased and originally they

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:47.680
had a bid from Take-Two Interactive last month for $1 billion.

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:54.880
Well, EA has swooped in and now, uh, purchased or made the agreement to purchase of the company

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:56.160
for $1.2 billion.

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:00.720
Of course, that would bring in a lot of racing series to EA.

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:08.960
But then again, it's also EA who they just, they just go in there and just fleece it dry

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:15.120
and stuff it full of microtransactions before they finally kill off the actual company.

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:17.600
So, all right.

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:21.680
Well, apparently though, uh, it's supposed to, the acquisition is supposed to be completed

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:24.000
by the first quarter of 2021.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.640
Um, and of course that'll give them a lot more racing games under their belt, aside

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:33.600
from of course, Need for Speed and, um, Burnout.

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:34.100
So.

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:35.780
Cool.

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:37.220
Yeah.

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:39.280
Don't know what else to say on that one.

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:42.720
It's kind of one of those hope it goes well for Codemasters.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:46.240
I mean, certainly it'll get their games out there, I think for broader and there's going

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:49.360
to be a lot more of a, uh, marketing and ad budget.

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:52.560
Not to say that didn't exist, but I think, you know, with, with as huge of a company

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:55.760
as EA is, um, there will definitely be a big boost with that.

01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:00.400
And I guess if you want to look at it a certain way, that means more Codemasters stuff will

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:03.840
show up on EA Play, which in turn will go to Game Pass.

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:06.960
Although I think a lot of the Codemasters stuff is already on Game Pass anyway, but,

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:08.320
you know, kind of interesting.

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:09.780
Whatever.

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.400
It, it is what it is.

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:14.180
All right.

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:17.920
Well, let's move on and talk about, I think this is cool.

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:22.000
Um, I don't know how many of you guys saw that direct this week of the Super Nintendo

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.440
World theme park.

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:30.160
So Miyamoto actually went out and showed over in Japan at, uh, uh, the, the, um, universal

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:32.720
studios out there, what this new land is going to look like.

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:34.160
And it looks really cool.

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:37.840
Now I know you probably guys would expect me to play this on Twitch, but, um, remember

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:41.120
we are trying to record a podcast and I know there's many folks that listen to the audio

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:42.000
throughout the week.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.760
So I didn't want to detract from that too much.

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:47.440
I will just urge everybody to check out this direct, um, when you can get a chance.

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:51.600
It was posted on December 18th called the Super Nintendo World Direct.

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.840
And it looks like really cool.

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:57.760
And it is interesting to hearing them talk about some of the things that had to be considered

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:01.280
for, um, the world that maybe they didn't have to think about before.

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:04.880
Like, what does the inside of a warp pipe look like?

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:06.720
They've never really shown that before.

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:10.720
I think maybe it was represented in some of the cartoons and stuff, but that isn't really

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:11.600
canon.

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:14.160
Um, so what is the inside of a warp pipe look like?

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.040
Yeah.

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:18.240
So they actually show looking at the Kenopios pictures.

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.920
Oh, have you not seen this yet?

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:20.480
Oh, it's so good.

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:25.920
I've seen some of it, but I'm actually looking at just some of the, the pictures I've seen

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:28.240
a lot of the pictures that were posted on Twitter, but yeah.

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:28.480
Yeah.

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:31.680
A lot of these are just ridiculously cute.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.840
And, um, I would get on a plane for this.

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:34.080
Yeah.

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.560
It's really that attention to detail that is really stunning with this whole thing.

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:42.320
Uh, and technically dark soccer, you don't really have to get on a plane because this

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:47.680
world will be coming to universal studios, um, in Hollywood, as well as the park in Orlando,

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:48.240
Florida.

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:52.720
So kind of like, um, how, when they got the rights to Harry Potter, they did the wizarding

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:53.600
world in Florida.

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:57.600
They did one in, um, LA and I think Japan has one of those too.

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:00.560
So it's kind of that concept, um, with this.

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.240
So all the parks right now.

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:03.360
Oh yeah.

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:04.720
It's not a good time.

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.480
No, now is not a good time for theme parks.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:11.440
I mean, it looks very limited in size, but I know that's the same with the wizarding

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:12.400
world of Harry Potter.

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:14.960
There's like maybe one or two attractions there.

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.720
And then that's it, which is kind of disappointing.

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:22.000
If it's super Nintendo world, it's like, well, it's Mario and Mario and done.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.840
There's no room to put anything else.

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:28.160
Also with the wizard world, it's different in Florida than it is in Hollywood.

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:31.520
And I kind of think it sounds like Florida has the better version because they have more

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:32.020
rides.

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:36.720
Um, but they also have more real, they, they ha they have a boatload of real estate to

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:37.600
play with in Florida.

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:40.080
That's why there's like five Disney parks in Florida.

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:45.120
And in the, in the U S and Anaheim, it's always like, what are we going to lose to

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.080
get something new?

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:50.480
Like, yes, they're building a whole Avengers section in a Disney California adventure,

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:51.360
but guess what?

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:55.600
The bugs life stuff is gone now because they had to take something out.

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:56.720
Nothing was lost.

01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:01.840
Nothing of value was, well, there was that, there was that train with all the sense.

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:02.340
Yeah.

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:03.220
Yeah.

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:04.240
There's that too.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:04.740
Yeah.

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:05.760
Hey, you know what?

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:10.800
I still found, uh, I found my, uh, video that I took of them singing happy trails and it

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:11.920
makes me sad.

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:12.420
Yeah.

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:18.640
Well, and, and Bobby, um, made a comment in chat saying now is the best time for theme

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.800
parks to be building new experiences.

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:21.300
Yes.

01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:22.880
Um, this is a great time.

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:23.120
Yeah.

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:23.440
Building.

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:23.940
Yes.

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:31.200
Um, opening, not so much, but by the time this gets to California, you know, we're talking

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:34.560
at this point, 2022, maybe 2023.

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:38.640
And I think theme parks will be back on the table for discussion when we get that far

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.880
out, hopefully they go, Oh God, I hope so.

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:42.400
So anyway,

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:45.280
I'm curious to see though what the new, uh, Mario Kart ride is.

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:51.120
Cause it kind of briefly touched on it that it's got like some AR component to it.

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:55.440
Um, but they didn't really show if it's like a rollercoaster or if it's like kind of one

01:14:55.440 --> 01:15:00.640
of those, just motion rides, not like motion ride, but like, you know, trackless motion

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:01.680
ride, I guess.

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:03.600
Um, or something like that.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:04.160
I don't know.

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:07.360
You know, maybe it is a rollercoaster.

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:07.840
I don't know.

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:12.720
Oh, think cars like California adventure.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:14.800
I guess.

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:15.600
Yeah.

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:16.100
Yeah.

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:18.560
That'd be cool.

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:19.040
Yeah.

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:19.680
That'd be fun.

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:23.120
Especially if you get to throw red shells at people, that'll be the best part.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:24.480
Yeah.

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:24.800
All right.

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:26.320
I'm moving on.

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.800
Let's get the spin out when you get hit with the red shell.

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:31.120
Blue shells.

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:33.440
It just sends everyone to the back of the line to get into the ride.

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:38.800
Um, another thing that's at those theme parks at universal is the Simpsons ride.

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:43.120
Cause the one in a Hollywood, uh, replaced that back to the future ride.

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:46.240
I don't know if you guys remember that from when we were really young, but, uh, yeah.

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:48.080
Now they have that Simpsons ride.

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:50.240
Um, and that one, I like that ride.

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:50.960
That one's really fun.

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:54.400
But what makes that ride is like the whole queue and every, there's so many jokes leading

01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:54.800
up to it.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:55.680
It's great.

01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:58.640
But, um, dark soccer has some Simpsons related news, right?

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:00.240
I do.

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:04.080
And not only is it Simpsons news, it's Dreamcast news.

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:06.080
You know, I love me some Dreamcast.

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:06.400
Same.

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:14.320
So, um, there, um, there was a, uh, a dev kit that was found.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:20.000
Apparently it was a, uh, broken Dreamcast dev kits hard drive that had this.

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:25.200
And it looks like as a playable demo for a game called the Simpsons bug squad.

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:34.800
Um, so as far as we can tell from this video, um, you're playing as a bug and the Simpsons

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:35.920
are walking around.

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:44.800
Um, it was a tech demo, but at any rate, it, it was supposed to be though, for a title

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.760
that was called Simpsons bug squad, I think it's just, you know, setting it up.

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:54.640
It was, uh, by, uh, red lemon studios who is no longer among the, the living.

01:16:54.640 --> 01:17:00.080
Um, and it actually, I mean, for the demo, it looked really good.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.280
It was all cell shaded.

01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:02.480
It looked very much like the show.

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:08.960
I mean, if it's just, you know, cell shaded, non textured, uh, 3d, then that wouldn't really

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:11.040
have been too difficult for the Dreamcast to do.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.920
Um, but it looks pretty cool.

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:15.440
I watched a little bit of the video.

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:20.640
There are, uh, tools out there to learn how to make it playable.

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:24.320
So you can check it out for the places that still probably have it up.

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.720
Um, but it looks pretty cool.

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:34.160
Um, and I just like when we find more things, uh, little tidbits on these development systems

01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:39.920
that people pick up for a song that are able to pull, uh, games out like that or demos

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:40.240
like that.

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:43.600
I just think it's pretty cool stuff, you know, what could have been.

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:49.680
And the guy said that there was some additional, uh, tech demos on there from that same developer.

01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:54.320
So it's exciting to see what other things they have considering that they were working

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:57.840
on a lot of games, uh, developed for Fox interactive.

01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.680
So it'd be interesting.

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:05.680
And even that like tech demo of the Simpsons game, that looked really good for like a Dreamcast

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:05.920
game.

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:09.840
Like that's, you know, I don't know, it's pretty solid.

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:12.480
Did genuinely have really good looking games.

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:19.680
Um, I mean, yeah, every, every system has its, you know, steaming turds, but in this

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:25.840
case, um, I, it, especially for a game that's, that's a cell shaded game like this.

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:30.960
That, um, you know, like I said, wouldn't have any major textures on it.

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:35.840
It, I would expect it to actually run pretty well in the Dreamcast, depending on, you know,

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:39.200
everything else trying to load in the game, but it looks, it looks, it looks fun.

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:43.600
It looks like it'd be, it would have been a really good, you know, fun outlet if ever

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:45.440
we'd gotten more goodies on the Dreamcast.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:46.240
Yeah.

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:47.840
All right.

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:53.280
I, I, I'm a very similar to a dark Tetsuya in our chat who says, uh, love me some unreleased

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:54.080
game stories.

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:55.040
Hell yeah.

01:18:55.040 --> 01:19:00.160
Over at twitch.tv slash vog network, uh, Zen monkey 11, following that up and in living

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:03.440
color RPG and married with children Sims like game.

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:04.880
Who knows what they may have been working on?

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:07.680
Maybe your fire, a Firefly game, right?

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:08.240
All right.

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:13.920
I'm still waiting for my, uh, my Jerry Seinfeld point and click game.

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:16.000
You know, that's supposed to be coming at some point.

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:19.040
Excuse me while I throw up in my mouth a little bit.

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:20.160
What's the clicking do?

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:20.660
Nothing.

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.280
No, it, it, it really is.

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:27.440
They remember they were making that Seinfeld, uh, point and click game that someone was

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:27.680
doing.

01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:28.960
There's like a fan game.

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:32.480
He has, it's a fan game, not a, not an official product.

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:32.720
Yeah.

01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:37.600
But I would like, I would just, I'd accept any TV show like that.

01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:40.080
Married with children, uh, golden girls.

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:40.880
Why not?

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:45.520
You know, Bobby, uh, chimed in and said there was a homie D clown PC game in the nineties.

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:50.720
I saw that on one of y'all's, uh, games done quick marathon, whether it was awesome or

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:50.960
summer.

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:53.760
I don't remember what was one of the two, but that was in one of the marathons.

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:57.200
It was in the, um, uh, not great game block.

01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:58.720
So I remember seeing that thing.

01:19:58.720 --> 01:19:58.880
Yeah.

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.160
I remember seeing that thinking.

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:03.200
They had this game and I didn't own it somehow.

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.120
Cause I had a lot of crappy games in the nineties.

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:05.760
I'll tell you that.

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:06.800
So, okay.

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:09.920
It was this most recent summer games done quick says Bobby.

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:11.360
So interesting.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:12.400
All right.

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:15.120
Uh, moving on, let's get to some more news.

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:19.040
Loki, this is, this is one of those things we should have seen coming.

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:30.080
Yeah, well, it, it is the M O of, uh, Epic games and Fortnite to, um, borrow.

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.400
Don't hold back from pop culture.

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:40.960
So they came out with a brand new totally original mode called the spy within.

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:46.720
And with the spy within it is a spinoff of their standard battle royale type game,

01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:54.640
where you have to figure out who the imposters are and take your crew and try to complete tasks.

01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:58.080
You can't talk to each other unless you call a meeting.

01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:01.680
G what could they be possibly ripping off?

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:05.920
So yes, clearly, clearly inspired by among us.

01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:10.400
It is, it looks incredibly cheap of them to do that.

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:14.160
But then again, if you think about it, Fortnite pretty much exists as.

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.840
You know, pub G was popular at the time and their original game Fortnite.

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:20.000
Didn't look all that popular.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Let's make a battle royale game out of it.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:22.720
Hey, look at that.

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:23.840
It's popular.

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:27.680
So Fortnite didn't get popular until it ripped off pub G that's right.

01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:30.160
Many people forget that wasn't supposed to be Fortnite.

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.520
Battle royale took over and became Fortnite,

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:37.760
but there was actually like a whole single player game that, you know, was like a survival game.

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:38.000
Yeah.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.560
It was like cookie cutter, you know, like all the other shooters out there.

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:48.000
It wasn't like survival horror, but it had the building elements in it too,

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.600
which they just took from Minecraft.

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:53.040
So, you know, Fortnite is popular from stealing all these other ideas really.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:54.640
So, yeah.

01:21:54.640 --> 01:22:00.800
And then, of course, they also have they added a 120 hertz mode as well for

01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:05.760
the newer consoles, so the Xbox Series X.

01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:14.960
And then also you can also do like 1440p on Series X at 120 hertz and 1080p on the Series S.

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:20.240
And I think the PlayStation 5 also got an additional graphics mode as well.

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:27.920
And then also, of course, there is a house party video chat app that you can set up.

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:30.400
I guess they're using it.

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:32.640
Do they have like some investment in this or something?

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:36.720
Because I guess this is similar to like using Discord or something.

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:39.200
But I don't know.

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:42.320
It just is such a rip off.

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:44.320
I don't think this is going to be popular.

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:47.200
Honestly, it does seem like kind of just a cheap rip off.

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:51.600
And I think Among Us isn't all of a sudden going to become unpopular because of this.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:55.680
But it's just that's just really low.

01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:58.080
Well, I guess not for Epic Games.

01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:02.240
Also unsurprising, though, like real talk, because haven't we been saying for long?

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:04.800
Oh, every game's got to put in a battle royale mode.

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:08.480
Every game is going to have this new battle royale thing until the next big thing comes along.

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:11.360
Who knows what the next big thing will be, but it'll show up someday.

01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.720
And then every game is going to put that.

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:19.200
Oh, it's here, of course, with Among Us being one of the top 10 on Twitch pretty consistently

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:25.680
at this point, with very high profile people like AOC playing Among Us on her Twitch feed.

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:29.360
You know, this is this is a thing now.

01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:38.400
So yeah, so I'm just I'm not surprised at all that this got ripped off.

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:44.320
And I think this also begs the question, what's going to be the next game to borrow from Among Us?

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:48.720
Are we going to get Super Mario imposter or what?

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:50.320
What game?

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:51.920
No, I know we don't.

01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:54.160
We haven't done listless in a long time.

01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:55.840
But if we did, that would be the game.

01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:57.920
That would be the list I want to do right now.

01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:02.400
Game that is most likely to implement an Among Us mode next.

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:06.400
Oh, I can tell you already what they would have what they would probably do.

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:09.120
It would be an obstacle course that game Fall Guys ish.

01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:11.760
You know, like they would rip off Fall Guys, I think.

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:12.800
I don't know.

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:13.840
No, not for now.

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:14.400
Not what not.

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:16.560
What does Fortnite rip off next?

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:19.760
What is the next game to rip off Among Us?

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:23.440
Although that's a good answer to what will be the next game to like Call of Duty.

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:26.160
Yeah, I could see that.

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:26.660
Yeah.

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:29.200
I don't know.

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:35.840
It they it's it's easily it's because one, I mean, I get it.

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:40.480
You can't necessarily copyright certain gameplay elements.

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:45.040
I'm I'm laughing because they're a small you have to probably get away with it.

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:47.840
Bobby Black Wolf would have won the listless with this answer.

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:50.320
Bobby Black Wolf said Pixel Poops.

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:50.960
Who pooped?

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.240
Sure, why not?

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:57.600
We can we can rip them off.

01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:08.000
Well, I saw him back behind the taco place, and so I know he was getting the tacos.

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:16.240
I saw Loki vent.

01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:17.440
I just needed fresh air.

01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:19.200
Oh, we vented.

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:19.600
All right.

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:22.560
All right.

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:24.320
It was just gas.

01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:25.680
It wasn't it wasn't.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.800
OK, S2100 Matt says you just delayed the game more with that idea.

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:33.040
And Bobby says that's the Super Nintendo sequel.

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:36.080
So all right, let's move on.

01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:40.640
Quest Buster, why do you need to roll a toilet paper right now?

01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:47.120
OK, let's talk about League of Legends.

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:49.840
Maybe Riot Games will steal Among Us next.

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:50.320
Who knows?

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:54.960
Because Riot did just announce that they're putting out a new MMO that's going to be tied

01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:56.560
into the League of Legends universe.

01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:01.440
And it was it was done kind of without a ton of fanfare, which kind of surprised me.

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:06.880
But there was a Twitter exchange going on where a VP at Riot, Greg Street, talked about how

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:12.800
he's been helping to develop the League universe and that this new game he's working on, some

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:14.640
might call it massive.

01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:16.960
And folks have been asking them to create it.

01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:22.160
And then, yeah, then there's like a follow up tweet that basically just says it very

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:22.800
plainly.

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:24.240
An MMO is coming.

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:25.840
There's no teaser trailer.

01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:32.320
There's no non-gameplay trailer with concept art or whatever.

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:33.360
There's nothing.

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:35.760
Just, you know, we announce things on Twitter now.

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:36.480
Why not?

01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:38.720
The government likes to announce policies on Twitter.

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:42.240
So why don't we just drop game announcements casually on Twitter like they're nothing?

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:44.320
I guess that's the world we live in now.

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:48.480
But I know a lot of people will be very happy to hear this, to hear that the League of Legends

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:49.920
universe is going to come to an MMO.

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:50.880
It makes a lot of sense.

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:56.400
And Riot has been trying to expand on that universe a little bit, you know, so like things

01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:58.320
like Dauntless and some of the other games they've been putting out.

01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:02.000
So this doesn't surprise me, really, to be honest.

01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:05.600
Yeah, so all right.

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:10.400
Well, usually we would take a trip down memory lane to do the classic.

01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:11.760
Oh, Dark Soccer is on our way back.

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:14.400
So I think we're going to get settled in here.

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:20.640
OK, so anyway, so Dark Soccer, if you're back, you're back just in time.

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:23.680
Because we're going to get into the classic game of the week.

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.040
So good timing.

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:25.840
Hopefully she's good to go.

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:28.000
I forgot to turn off my cam.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.880
I noticed you turned it off and then back on somehow.

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:31.680
So anyway.

01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:35.600
Yeah, no, I had an emergency party run.

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:36.240
No worries.

01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:36.560
All right.

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:38.320
We're into the classic game of the week tonight.

01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:42.080
Every week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault to find a game that she thinks, hey,

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.640
you kids should be checking this game out.

01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:45.440
Stop playing.

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:49.840
Stop playing Among Us and Fortnite and check out a real classic game.

01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:53.200
Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game for us.

01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:55.360
I do want to say, though, Dark Soccer, I don't know if you.

01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:57.520
It was something I noticed with the clip of this game.

01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:58.560
And I'll let you introduce in a minute.

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.080
But I do just want to warn the listeners.

01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:01.360
There's a lot of flashing in it.

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:05.200
So if you are somebody who's susceptible to flashes,

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:08.480
you may wish to take a moment to minimize the window so you can just listen.

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:12.400
The video will stop when Dark Soccer stops talking about it.

01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.720
But I noticed I was like, oh, there's a lot of flashes in this.

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:15.920
I hope it's OK.

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:17.280
I didn't get a chance to really watch it.

01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:18.960
I was actually looking for one that had sound.

01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:20.560
Oh, gotcha.

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:22.100
Yeah.

01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:24.640
We were right in the middle of doing something,

01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:26.400
and I had to real quick find a video.

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:28.080
No, I mean, that was the game.

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:31.120
So I've never heard of this game causing problems.

01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:32.320
I just want to warn.

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:35.920
If you do not like flashes for whatever reason,

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:38.160
please avert your eyes now because I'm going to start the footage

01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:40.320
as soon as Dark Soccer says what the game of the week is.

01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:43.280
So the game of the week is called Arabian Fight,

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:49.680
and it was released only in arcades by Sega in 1992.

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:53.920
So it actually was released in January 1992.

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:57.440
So the game was in development through 1991 and copyrighted then.

01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:02.080
So this is kind of your standard beat them up

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:05.840
that went along with the other ones of its generation.

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:08.880
You know, followed kind of like Golden Axe and Streets of Rage,

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:11.920
three action buttons, one punch, one kick, one special attack.

01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:15.840
Although you have magic based attacks,

01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:18.960
kind of like how Golden Axe has its special attacks.

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:23.040
You can also throw your opponents and you can collect items from chests

01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:28.400
as well as enemies to do different points,

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:32.080
restore health, give you more of your special attack.

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:38.240
The game actually does something a little bit unique for its era.

01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:44.800
Basically, with this game is it has these different scaling techniques

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:49.760
to allow the characters to move back and forth in the field.

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:53.280
So sort of think of Fatal Fury, you know,

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:55.040
where you've got your different fields, you can jump back and forth.

01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:03.680
And so it will use the foreground elements for special attacks.

01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:08.640
You can have characters perform their attacks very close to the screen

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:11.920
so that only their head and torso fit, kind of like it's animated

01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:15.040
and different enemies can jump in from the foreground to fight.

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:18.320
Although they can't be hit during these animated sequences.

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:22.800
And it actually looks like, you know, like an interesting combination

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:26.320
of a straight up animation and sprite based fighting.

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:31.920
So basically with this game, I mean, it's really fairly simple.

01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:34.800
You play as one of four characters

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:39.680
and you're trying to save the Princess Lurana

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:43.360
from being attacked by a corrupt sheik.

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:48.000
And so you have to travel to the castle to save the princess.

01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:57.600
But anyway, your main character is called Sinbat, not Sinbad,

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:00.720
Ramaya, Goldor or Datta.

01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:03.600
Sinbat is the handsome hero.

01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:09.920
Ramaya is the token, beautiful, scantily dressed female of the game.

01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:14.560
Goldor is the muscle and the brute.

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:19.680
And then Datta is a kind of spiritual looking bald dude.

01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:28.240
So it was listed for 1992 by Game Machine in Japan

01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:34.000
as being the most, as the seventh most successful table arcade unit of that year.

01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:36.400
Now I'm ringing this up because

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:41.840
at SSA100MAT it's not Sinbad, it's Sinbat-T.

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:46.320
And no, not Goldor from Power Rangers.

01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:55.920
So at any rate, the game is actually included on the Astra City Mini,

01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:01.040
the little arcade cabinet being released with all these Sega games.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:08.720
And so there's a chance that people will be able to play it at home now,

01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:13.280
you know, instead of, you know, emulation or anything like that.

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:19.280
Or, you know, MAME again emulation or actually owning a machine.

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:22.400
Because I don't think it's been released on any home compilation.

01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:25.040
So there it is.

01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:26.720
Really quick one.

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:27.520
But you know what?

01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:30.720
It's a neat game.

01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:31.520
It's a neat game.

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:35.360
Yeah, I got to admit, this is not one I was super familiar with before.

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:37.200
Let me take the game down here real quick.

01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:38.720
And so that, okay, oops.

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:41.440
I got to the shot that doesn't have my co-host on it.

01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:45.200
So the game is now off the screen if you had looked away a moment ago.

01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:49.360
Again, I'm not aware of anything that that game caused or any problems,

01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:52.480
but I couldn't help when I was looking at the footage.

01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:55.440
I was like, oh, this seems like a lot of flashing.

01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:59.920
So I just I've admittedly been really over cautious, perhaps with recent events.

01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:04.160
Yeah, perhaps with recent events in the industry in the front of my mind.

01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:05.520
I was just cyberpunk.

01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:06.020
Yeah.

01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:07.840
I was just, you know what?

01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:09.760
I'm better safe than sorry when it comes to that stuff.

01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:11.600
But there's your classic game.

01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:15.040
But I have to say, it was not one I was super familiar with,

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:19.680
but it definitely kind of did some interesting thing with the graphics there.

01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:22.560
It was like kind of like this kind of pseudo 3D effect

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:27.200
that's very patently late 90s in it, which I thought was interesting.

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:31.440
I really haven't seen too many other games that do that kind of thing,

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:35.760
using the large sprites and animation as a foreground element.

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:38.160
Not to that extreme.

01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:41.040
Like that game takes it to a real extreme.

01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:46.320
And I think it's really, really kind of refreshing for its time.

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:47.120
Does that make sense?

01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:49.280
I think it would be that's going to be really fun.

01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:50.420
Yeah.

01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:51.440
All right.

01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:55.920
So I honestly would hope that Sega would consider doing some sort of

01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:59.040
like Switch release or something for that.

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:00.340
Nice.

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:05.120
I'm going to insert a story here, kind of a breaking story, if you will,

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:08.080
before we get into rapid fire news, because this is about classic games.

01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:11.840
Here is something Bobby brought to my attention based on,

01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:16.000
get this, we got a YouTube comment because over at VoG Network,

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.440
we actually have a YouTube channel.

01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:19.680
I'm going to admit we don't have a lot of OLR content on there,

01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:20.400
at least not right now.

01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:24.320
Going through the three hour episodes is a lot to go through to put stuff on YouTube.

01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:27.120
But Bobby has put some highlights from his show because he's only an hour.

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.680
So he's put some highlights and some clips from his show up there.

01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:33.760
And one of them was that recently he built an outrun cabinet

01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:36.640
and he was showing kind of that and what that looked like.

01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:39.440
So it was the arcade one up outrun cabinet specifically.

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:41.280
And he was showing that and that's over on YouTube.

01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:45.360
So cheap plug for Bobby's YouTube over VoG Network on YouTube.

01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:50.720
But we got a comment that said, oh, there's five games now.

01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:51.760
What?

01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:56.640
Because in the outrun cabinet that Bobby showed, there's only four games.

01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:59.280
And so there was a comment that said there's five games now.

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:02.240
We'll get this over at arcadeoneup.com.

01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:07.360
They just announced they put out a firmware update for their outrun cabinet

01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:09.840
that has added a fifth game.

01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:13.760
Rad Rally is the new game that's been added to the outrun cabinet.

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:17.280
This is the first time that something like this has been done.

01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:24.080
And this explains why potentially there was a USB port on the back of this cabinet

01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:26.960
that not all the arcade one up cabinets have had.

01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:29.440
Or maybe this is something we're going to see moving forward

01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:32.160
is that the USB stuff becomes kind of standard there.

01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:34.960
So kind of the breaking news there.

01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:41.440
Arcade one up flexing and now adding an additional game to an existing cabinet

01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:44.640
with Rad Rally having come to the outrun cabinet.

01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:47.120
And you got to love the chat.

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:50.080
The chat is going, oh, it wasn't Spy Hunter.

01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:54.160
No, I imagine Spy Hunter will get its own cabinet

01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:55.600
when they're ready to put that game out.

01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:58.160
I'm not familiar with Rad Rally.

01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:02.800
Jamie, is that a title familiar to you

01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.880
and how that would fit into the outrun universe?

01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:09.200
We actually, it came up in conversation last night just from,

01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:11.200
gosh, what was it we were looking at?

01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:13.200
I think we were trying to watch something for Daytona 2.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.160
And there, well, because I like, I hate playing Daytona.

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:21.200
I hate the attract mode, but I like all the rest of the music in it

01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:22.720
because that dude is so enthusiastic.

01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:29.360
But I think it was like a, a poster or something that we were looking at,

01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:31.840
just like a still picture for something.

01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:35.200
It might have been some cabinet art for Daytona 2

01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:38.320
that it didn't look like any of the cars in there.

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:41.760
It was something sort of offhand and Dan brought up that game.

01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:44.160
Oh, it could be from that, you know, is what it looked like because,

01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:48.720
but I don't really remember the whole situation.

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:49.280
I get it.

01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:50.960
So I'm looking at more information on it.

01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:56.560
It's actually Rad Mobile was a way that this game was often referred to.

01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:00.720
And also when it was ported to the Sega Saturn, it was called Gale Racer,

01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:03.120
but essentially it's all a very similar game.

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:06.720
And they say that usually it is credit for Yu Suzuki.

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:09.840
It does kind of fall into kind of the outrun family in that way.

01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:13.200
And now that I'm looking at it, I'm like, oh, okay, I have seen this before.

01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:17.680
So it's just kind of a racing game that had several different names with minor tweaks,

01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:18.880
but that's still very interesting.

01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:20.180
Kind of neat.

01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:22.160
So, all right.

01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:27.200
But yeah, I just, it's funny that that came up so randomly in our conversation last night.

01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:27.700
Yeah.

01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:31.760
Um, so, and then you mentioned, I was like, oh yeah, Dan, kind of,

01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:33.680
we had that kind of mentioned in, in passing.

01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:38.240
And Orange Right says Rad Rally was the sequel to Rad Mobile.

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:40.080
So interesting, interesting.

01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:43.520
And Bobby says it's a micro USB port on the back of the cabinet.

01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:46.400
So if he wants to add the game, he has to get a little converter to do it.

01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:47.600
That's still pretty cool though.

01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:49.760
Very interested in that.

01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:53.120
Also, hey Bobby, and I'm going to totally use leverage the show.

01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:55.200
I meant to ask you this on the call earlier.

01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:57.440
Can you send me the link to where you bought your

01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:02.000
Mega 64, the large Commodore 64?

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:02.880
Cause I want one.

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:05.920
And when I went onto Amazon to get one, all I could find were the minis.

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:11.200
And I think I found like one big one, but I think it might've been out of stock or it

01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:13.360
was from a seller name I didn't recognize.

01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:15.120
So I was like, is this a resale?

01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:15.920
I don't know what it is.

01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:18.960
So, um, uh, maybe they don't have it anymore.

01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:23.200
I don't know, but I, uh, I'm just going to ask very nicely for that link.

01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:23.520
All right.

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:26.320
Cause I want one as a Christmas present to myself.

01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:33.200
Let's what was the, um, what was the, the version of rad mobile that came out on Saturn?

01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:35.520
I'm just trying to double check something real quick.

01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:36.480
Gale racer.

01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:37.520
I think I closed the window.

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:39.060
Yeah.

01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:39.520
Yeah.

01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:40.400
That's what I'm looking for.

01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:43.680
There are, there are, they're all technically different games, but they're just kind of

01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:46.720
all like spiritual, like, you know, related.

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:49.520
So, yeah, that was the one I was trying to think of.

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:49.840
Got it.

01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:50.720
All right.

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:54.800
Uh, let's get to some rapid fire news and some other news around the industry pretty

01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:55.360
quickly here.

01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:55.860
Loki.

01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:57.840
Yeah.

01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:03.520
So we've got, um, some more news about control, which is coming, getting a PlayStation five

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:10.160
and Xbox series X and S version with ray tracing that's coming in February on the second.

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:15.920
Um, and then it's going to also have a full retail release on March 2nd.

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:22.880
Um, they're going to have a performance mode, which runs at 60 FPS on both platforms.

01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:29.120
Well, I guess the standard version is going to run 30 FPS, but will allow for ray tracing.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.680
So kind of the standard fare that we've been getting with some of these newer games.

01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:40.880
Just remember though, you have to, um, purchase the ultimate edition in order to be able to

01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:46.080
get the Xbox series S and X upgrade and PlayStation five upgrade.

01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:53.360
So that's annoying because we're unfortunately unable to offer an upgrade path to all existing

01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:54.720
control players.

01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:57.920
That is a bunch of crap because they accidentally released it.

01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:01.440
So that is wrong.

01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:04.560
Um, but that is what they're sticking by.

01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:09.840
So if you feel it's worth it, honestly, I will just wait for it to hit game pass.

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:17.120
Um, and then cyberpunk 2077 is getting a crossover with death stranding.

01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:18.640
Um, Mars is a death strand.

01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:24.160
He's got a crossover with cyberpunk, which makes sense since a Kojima did have a cameo

01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:26.400
in cyberpunk 2077.

01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:26.800
Oh, really?

01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:28.560
But apparently, yes, he did.

01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:30.080
Uh, he is in the game.

01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:36.960
Um, so you'll be able to get a few different things there, including a silver hand cybernetic

01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:37.280
arm.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:45.440
Um, also there's some, uh, cyberpunk themed holograms and a selection of customization

01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:46.800
and clothing options.

01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:53.360
And in addition, you can also equip Sam with a new hacking ability, which allows him to,

01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:57.440
um, mess with sensor poles and mule tracks and stuff.

01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:01.360
So that's, uh, coming to PC right now.

01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:07.200
They haven't announced any sort of, um, update to the PlayStation four version, but at least

01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:08.400
PC is going to be getting that.

01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:15.680
And as Joe and Matt saying, you can still unlock the car from cyberpunk in horizon four,

01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:16.180
I believe.

01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:17.360
Yes.

01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:18.080
Oh, that's right.

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:18.480
Yeah.

01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:18.980
Yeah.

01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:23.600
And I've been seeing that death stranding, um, cyberpunk, uh, thing being promoted in

01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:28.160
the Epic game store, because, uh, you know what, despite the fact that we talk, um, a

01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:33.520
significant amount of shit about Epic on this show, sometimes look, I love ZZT.

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:34.640
There's something nice.

01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:38.720
And I also love free games and they've been giving away a lot of them.

01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:41.600
So just a reminder, if you haven't been going in there and getting your free game every

01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:43.120
day, uh, get on that.

01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:45.680
They'll probably be something real good in the coming days.

01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:49.840
Um, usually I think it was last year when they gave away like civ six on the last day

01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:50.240
or something.

01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:52.560
I remember there was something big they gave away at one point.

01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:54.400
Um, so keep an eye on that y'all.

01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:55.680
All right.

01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:59.440
Meanwhile, though, the other rapid fire news I had for you guys, Jason referenced this

01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:00.320
in the intro tonight.

01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:01.200
Thank you, Jason.

01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:07.280
Uh, but guitar freaks and drum mania, if you will, has officially been released for PC.

01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:11.120
Now we talked a little bit about the beta test prior, uh, but the official release has

01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:13.520
now come out at least in Japan.

01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:18.160
Um, not a big fan of these games, not coming out in the U S I know Jason addressed the

01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:20.480
music licensing thing at the top of the show.

01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:23.920
Still a little bit disappointing, uh, at least that the originals can't make their

01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:25.840
way into some type of U S version.

01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:29.680
Uh, but it's probably harder to release games in the U S when you've closed all your U S

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:30.560
offices.

01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:35.200
Um, still, if you are the type that is fine reading, uh, enough Japanese to get through

01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:40.880
this and you use the Konami online or the Kona suite, uh, uh, online, uh, there's probably

01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:45.200
going to be a lot here for you, including over 200 songs that is from the arcade version

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:46.160
of Ghidadora.

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:50.160
Uh, it's a very true to arcade experience, which I would expect it to be cause it's arcade

01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:52.960
machines basically run on modified PCs of sorts.

01:42:52.960 --> 01:43:00.960
Uh, and uh, yeah, it's, uh, this, the online service for this game will run you 1,628 yen

01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:01.440
a month.

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:03.360
That's about 15 bucks.

01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:05.760
So kind of what you'd pay for an MMO, I suppose.

01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:06.880
Yeah, it's not bad.

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:12.560
Um, so check that out music game fans, if that is up your alley and you don't mind having

01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:15.440
to do it all in Japanese and they also have a controller.

01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:16.960
Oh, that's right.

01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:17.200
Yeah.

01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:19.200
They got a PC controllers coming out.

01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:24.640
That's not going to turn into something, uh, where somebody puts out a freemium type of

01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:26.000
thing that uses those controllers.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:29.600
I'm sure like a step mania type of thing.

01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:30.560
Right.

01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:30.880
Yeah.

01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:35.760
And well, I'm sure that it looks already very much like a rock band controller or guitar

01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:36.960
hero controller.

01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:38.880
Um, and it's expensive.

01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:40.480
350 bucks basically.

01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:41.840
You know what they need to do?

01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:43.200
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:44.480
You know what they need to do though?

01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:48.400
If it looks like one of those controllers, how about putting out a controller that works

01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:49.360
with rock band?

01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:51.120
Because it's kind of funny.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:56.640
Now everybody used to have those plastic instruments shitting up their house everywhere.

01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:01.360
So many of those have been thrown away or gone to the used market or what have you.

01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:06.320
Now that like rock band four is backwards compatible, at least on Xbox for sure.

01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:08.160
I'm pretty sure it is on PS5 as well.

01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:12.240
I don't see why it wouldn't be, uh, people kind of want those plastic instruments again.

01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:15.760
They want to be able to play those games again with the instruments and you can't really

01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:20.000
do it, uh, without buying, you know, really now, now people are charging an arm and a

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:20.960
leg for those things.

01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:22.800
So, uh, probably sell mine.

01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:26.240
I mean, well, yeah, if you're not using them, somebody will buy them.

01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:28.880
So anyway, just an interesting aside.

01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:31.120
I thought I'd kind of bring up cause it's related.

01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:37.200
Uh, also worth noting, uh, Hey, uh, we talked previously about during the game awards, Sephiroth

01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:40.960
was going to be released as a new character in smash brothers.

01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:42.400
When is that going to happen?

01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:46.240
Well, for many people, it has already happened because if you can beat him into challenge

01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:49.760
mode, even if you do it on Bobby Black Wolf mode, that is very easy mode.

01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:51.200
You will earn Sephiroth.

01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:53.520
So most people that really want them have them.

01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:56.480
For everybody else, I think it's the 23rd, the 22nd.

01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:58.640
Eh, most of you are probably already in there playing with them.

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:03.600
Also, some Mii fighters came out with that, which is pretty cool, but this is, this is

01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:04.480
the really funny thing.

01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:04.720
Okay.

01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:05.600
You ready?

01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:08.480
The Mii fighters that came out to go along with Sephiroth.

01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:10.640
Barrett makes sense, right?

01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:11.840
Final Fantasy character.

01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:13.760
Tifa, Final Fantasy character.

01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:15.600
Aerith, Final Fantasy character.

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:17.440
Chocobo with a little hat, right?

01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:18.720
Cute, Final Fantasy character.

01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:21.040
And then the last one that came out, Geno.

01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:22.800
That's right.

01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:24.800
Geno is now in smash brothers.

01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:25.760
Yes.

01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:31.440
The beloved super Mario RPG character of all time finally made his way to smash brothers

01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:32.640
as a Mii costume.

01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:37.680
That's unfortunate.

01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:42.480
And the internet fanboys shed a tear for their obscure character that will never come.

01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:43.520
Waluigi says hi.

01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:45.920
No, Waluigi says,

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:50.400
Now it can be my turn.

01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:53.200
All right.

01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:57.520
Anyhow, moving on, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:01.760
Um, well, some pinball news, which has kind of been,

01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:05.280
people have been polarized actually over this.

01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:11.360
I've been chatting with some people, but the new stern game that was announced is Led Zeppelin,

01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:12.480
which I don't know.

01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:15.760
I'm kind of tired of them doing all these like band games.

01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:19.680
I mean, but getting the license for Led Zeppelin, that's pretty cool.

01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:21.680
And on top of that, it's a Steve Ritchie table.

01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:26.640
And Steve is known for his fast action type of games.

01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:31.440
I mean, he did Black Knight, Black Knight 2000, Black Knight Sword of Rage,

01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:35.840
the newer Star Wars that came out.

01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:38.480
So he's known for his fast tables.

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:42.720
And I think it looks pretty good.

01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:47.040
I mean, you've got your usual multiple versions of it.

01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:52.640
So there is the, you know, the regular production one.

01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:56.960
There is the pro and then there's the premium limited edition.

01:46:56.960 --> 01:46:59.520
And then you can also get accessories to go for the table.

01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:02.880
So, um, I don't know.

01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:07.200
I know people who are planning on getting it and I'll play theirs when it comes out.

01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:10.240
I'm not in a hurry for it myself, but hey, it's Led Zeppelin.

01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:14.400
So also SNK is getting a little bit, uh,

01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:22.400
Teasy, they have, uh, teased a console coming out in 2021.

01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:31.280
That quote is a system to bridge the needs between passionate fans and console gaming enthusiasts.

01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:40.240
So I'm wondering if we might be getting some sort of, uh, AES MVS, like

01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:44.800
machine, I guess I have like maybe multiple carts or something, or have the cartridges be on

01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:49.920
smaller cartridges and release that simply just for the SNK items.

01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:54.000
They had the mini 50 in one, and then they released their own version.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.920
It's not officially arcade one up.

01:47:55.920 --> 01:48:00.560
It's a clone, basically another company that has like 50 games in it.

01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:02.640
So I, but it's ramulated.

01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:03.520
Okay.

01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:03.840
Yeah.

01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:06.000
And this could be something maybe uses cartridges.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:06.400
I don't know.

01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:10.160
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:15.680
it's interesting, but I don't know.

01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:17.520
I mean, it can be interesting.

01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:21.440
It depends on, uh, on, you know, when they put out more information about it.

01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:27.600
Uh, but yeah, I think that, that, uh, I mean, I still would just rather have had like an

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:30.320
all-in-one MVS AES and be done with it.

01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:31.200
So we'll see.

01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:31.680
Yeah.

01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:34.400
I'd like to see that kind of come back, but we'll see.

01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:34.640
Yeah.

01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:35.600
All right.

01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:37.280
Cartridges the size of your head.

01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:40.400
That's a cartridge that could kill somebody.

01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:43.040
Honestly, I'm not that heavy, but yeah.

01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:44.640
All right.

01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:45.440
Then you're not using it.

01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:45.840
Right.

01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:46.160
All right.

01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:49.040
Uh, and Dr.

01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:52.480
Sues is maybe same idea as their arcade thing, but a console instead.

01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:56.000
Either way, it's sure to be better than the VCS.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:56.800
Just saying.

01:48:56.800 --> 01:48:57.200
All right.

01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:03.120
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates, which I imagine it's finally

01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:08.400
going to start to get quiet this week, seeing as, Oh, it's Christmas this week.

01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:12.240
But this has been a weird year all around the board.

01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:13.440
So what's coming out this week?

01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:16.000
Loki, not a ton of things.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.040
So you're right.

01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:22.880
Um, so double dragon neon on the Nintendo switch, uh, override to super mech league

01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:29.280
on PC, Nintendo switch PlayStation four PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series X, uh, super meat

01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:32.080
boy forever on PC and Nintendo switch.

01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:37.280
Who's your daddy on PC, Mac and Xbox one.

01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:43.440
And then last but not least we have, um, actually, no, I take that back.

01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:49.600
So we're going to have, looks like, uh, the Hong Kong massacre on Nintendo switch.

01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:53.760
And then the last but not least is earth defense force world brothers.

01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:59.200
That's that voxel cutesy earth defense force games coming to Nintendo switch and PlayStation

01:49:59.200 --> 01:49:59.840
four.

01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:00.560
Neat.

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:01.200
That's it.

01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:01.680
All right.

01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:02.960
That's it for the year.

01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:03.760
That's it for the year.

01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:04.080
All right.

01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:06.480
Traveling to Japan and checking out the releases there.

01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:09.280
Uh, it's, it's a little different Christmas, a little different there.

01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:13.360
So here's some games that you can play while you enjoy your cake, uh, on the Nintendo switch

01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:16.960
this week, earth defense force world brothers, like Loki just mentioned is out in Japan as

01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:17.120
well.

01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:24.960
And the 24th fight of gods also out, uh, sniper elite for vampire with a Y, uh, is out, uh,

01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:30.240
also the Alistair collection, uh, and metal max Zeno.

01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:36.000
Um, and the, uh, that's a peripheral, uh, that's it, but there's, Oh, next week, I'm

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:39.600
going to spoil next week's just cause I want to get dark soccer's reaction to the fact

01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:41.280
that I'm on new year's Eve.

01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:44.000
Digimon survive is coming out on the switch in Japan.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:44.640
That's kind of fun.

01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:51.680
Dark soccer was really the only person I knew who, who stand Digimon, um, and maybe

01:50:52.640 --> 01:51:00.880
Digimon zero two, um, that the whole first era Digimon Digimon zero two and, uh, uh,

01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:02.000
Digimon try.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:02.400
Gotcha.

01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:05.920
Um, the PlayStation four, pretty similar story.

01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:09.920
You're at defense for swirl brothers, vampire, the Alistair collection.

01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:12.960
Um, uh, all that same stuff also on the PlayStation four.

01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:14.800
So those are your releases for this week.

01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:15.600
How about the UK?

01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:19.600
Dark soccer is only one, only one.

01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:23.520
And it is overdrive to ultimate deluxe edition.

01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:31.520
That's it on the 22nd, which is in a day in the UK very soon.

01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:33.360
All right.

01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:34.800
We have some more stories for you guys.

01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:38.720
Then we'll get to the listener round table, but first, uh, Loki.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:40.400
Yeah.

01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:46.880
So, uh, as we've, I don't know, it's, it's just the game industry, I guess, but, you

01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:51.520
know, we talked about shady reviews and stuff and not, um, revealing all the information

01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:54.880
when, uh, we were talking about cyberpunk and that type of thing.

01:51:54.880 --> 01:52:01.280
Well, now game companies are wisening up to the fact that game reviews come out.

01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:04.400
People purchase the game space on those initial reviews.

01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:09.200
And sometimes they don't like hearing about how there's microtransactions in the game.

01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:10.160
So what did they do?

01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:15.360
If you're Ubisoft, you wait a month before you start selling those really egregious microtransactions.

01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:16.560
And that's what they do with it.

01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:25.120
Or you wait until right before the Chris McQuanzica holiday season, when this gift is going to

01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:26.640
start showing up for people.

01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:28.400
And that's when you pull the trigger.

01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:30.960
And this isn't new for them.

01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:33.680
They've done sort of XP booster type things before.

01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:38.960
But now Assassin's Creed Valhalla, they've, I guess, updated the game to include them.

01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:46.400
And it's going to leave you, um, $10 lighter if you decide to purchase it and it'll allow

01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:50.240
you to earn 50% more experience.

01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:57.200
And it's, uh, you know, I don't know, clearly.

01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:58.080
I mean, I get it.

01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:02.080
Sometimes people are in a hurry to play a game and stuff like that, and they don't want

01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:07.120
to, um, you know, work through whatever.

01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:10.000
But, you know, back in the day that used to be like cheats and stuff.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:16.640
And let's be honest, if, if this is the type of thing that you like doing, I might suggest

01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:20.160
getting a PC because you can just cheat without paying $10.

01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:26.960
You can just increase, you know, your levels or whatever, without having to shell out money

01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:28.640
for something that would normally be free.

01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:30.560
Just use modifications.

01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:31.520
Exactly.

01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:37.600
You can get double XP and titties in your game through the magic of mods.

01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:40.720
This is not the first time, like I said, that they've done this.

01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:42.320
They did this in Odyssey as well.

01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:48.800
And they had denied before that boosters, um, didn't influence the design of the game.

01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:54.880
They, they, they basically say they didn't throttle the game, um, based on this stuff.

01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:58.400
However, you may remember there was also, you know, the Lord of the Rings game that

01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:06.240
came out that they did like, and a lot of these games do increase the grind to allow

01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:10.000
you to, um, be more motivated to purchase these.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:16.960
So they may say it that didn't influence it, but it influenced it.

01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:19.840
Quest busters, uh, quest buster, excuse me, in chat is pointing out.

01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:23.200
Um, Oh, come on the experience boost for 10 bucks for Valhalla.

01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:24.800
It's not really necessary.

01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:28.240
So kind of pointing out that, you know, for this game, it's probably not needed.

01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:30.560
Odyssey's leveling was glacial though.

01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:32.640
There was definitely a difference there versus origin.

01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:38.800
So kind of interesting how you may not need it, but they'll still sell it to you.

01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:40.480
Exactly.

01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:45.200
Speaking of things that they're going to sell to you as a subscription to their Ubisoft,

01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:46.720
uh, game service.

01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:51.680
So Ubisoft plus of course, you know, that $15 service that, uh, basically like the EA

01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:52.720
play stuff.

01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:56.560
Well, now they're going to be offering it to stadia users as well.

01:54:56.560 --> 01:54:57.360
So that's right.

01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:00.800
Not only do you get the pay for stadium, but you can also pay for this as well.

01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:05.280
If you want to play all these different Ubisoft games, I guess that's slightly better than,

01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:14.320
um, pain for each individual game with stadia as that's not very, um, good, uh, value as

01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:14.800
it is.

01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:20.240
But I mean, this is slightly better, I guess, but it is something that they are offering

01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:21.840
because, you know, they want all the money.

01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:22.560
So why not?

01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:24.720
Why not?

01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:26.160
All right.

01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:26.560
Yeah.

01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:30.480
Well, let's move on and talk about that streaming service that y'all are going to play this

01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:34.880
game on and complain about this DLC on just like we're doing right now here on lovely

01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:38.800
Twitch and a Twitch has announced a variety of policy updates this week.

01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:41.840
In fact, you've probably been seeing some of them scroll across the bottom for those

01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:45.040
of you that are, uh, watching live on Twitch this week.

01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:48.720
Um, and, uh, yeah, it has to do with some big policy updates.

01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:50.960
They did a town hall earlier this week.

01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:54.720
Finally, they had promised that and they did the town hall and they talked about some,

01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:59.600
recent policy changes and they address some things about the DMCA sexual harassment ads

01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:01.120
and some of those other issues.

01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:07.120
Um, but what was interesting is kind of what everybody kind of was talking about after

01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:14.880
the fact was Twitch has decided to ban words like simp in cell and Virgin, but when used

01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:17.360
in derogatory contexts.

01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:20.480
So, I mean, like if I was talking about deserve to be

01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:29.840
Well, if I'm talking about the Virgin Mary at Christmas or something, then that's, I,

01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:30.400
that's fine.

01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:36.000
Cause I'm not using it in a derogatory manner, but if I'm calling somebody a Virgin who can't

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.360
drive, then that is using it in a derogatory manner.

01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:44.160
But how is Twitch going to understand context of stuff?

01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:48.000
Because that's a great question that I think they should answer.

01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:55.440
Cause I, if I'm going to guess, I'm going to say they can't because most of these platforms,

01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:59.760
when it comes to banning people for different things, you know, they'll cite that you're

01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:06.240
violating their rule, but it may be, you know, in the context of it, it may not be egregious.

01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:12.400
Um, so I don't all of a sudden believe that they're going to start applying context to

01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:12.720
this.

01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:15.920
I think they're just going to straight up, just ban it altogether.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:20.240
In fact, I'm going to stop you because we don't want misinformation out there.

01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:21.520
They did clarify.

01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:24.160
These words are not blanket banned.

01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:29.200
They will only incur penalties when they quote negatively refer to another person's sexual

01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:30.240
practices.

01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:33.760
It does sound like it is.

01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:38.320
And Twitch is kind of adding it to their utility belt of reasons.

01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:44.000
We could ban you if you're being a douche nozzle in someone's chat, then we can say,

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.880
well, you're not supposed to use words like that in a negative context.

01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:50.080
You called somebody a virgin who can't drive in their chat.

01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:52.000
And so you're, you're banned for that.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:56.160
Cause you were in general, you were being an asshole, but this specifically is why you

01:57:56.160 --> 01:57:57.200
got the ban.

01:57:57.200 --> 01:58:02.320
I, I, I kind of feel like that's what they're doing, but I'm not disagreeing with either

01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:05.360
of you either because there's so much of it that's subjective.

01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:09.600
And how do we know that this is going to be applied appropriately across the board?

01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:09.920
Right.

01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:14.560
So, um, it should be noted they've already been, uh, removing emotes.

01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:20.160
So, um, that's why you don't have a VoG network simp emote is that we're not allowed to have

01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:20.480
them.

01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:22.320
And it wasn't something we wanted anyway.

01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:23.360
Um, but.

01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:28.720
We, there, there have been channels that had emotes and, uh, they're no longer there and

01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:29.920
they don't approve new ones.

01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:35.440
Um, now some people are still calling out some of the other problems that are still

01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:40.880
hap- happening on Twitch, such as you can still walk into people's chat and say slurs

01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:42.320
with little to no action.

01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:46.960
And, uh, where was the, where is the outrage that people are having over these words?

01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:48.080
Simp, Incel, and Virgil.

01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:52.640
Where was that outrage when black and female streamers were complaining about being harassed

01:58:52.640 --> 01:58:53.520
on Twitch?

01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:59.440
That comment from a streamer DaPurpleSharpie, where was Twitch's we need to stop harassment

01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:00.400
stance then?

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:03.120
So fair question.

01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:11.120
Um, I guess one could say at least they're trying, but this almost goes back to what

01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:15.360
we said at the top of the show with the Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft thing.

01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:17.920
It's one thing to put out a statement.

01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:20.480
It's another to take the actions to back it up.

01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:24.960
And I think that's where we're at here with the Twitch thing.

01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:29.440
It, okay, how nice that you have a policy now and you are putting on this front of taking

01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:30.720
things seriously.

01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:37.200
But until you put the actions behind it to make folks like DaPurpleSharpie feel more

01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:44.560
welcome on Twitch, as opposed to the unnecessary bullshit that streamers have to put up with

01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:50.160
sometimes, um, then if we just think it's all lip service and I get that.

01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:57.360
So I think we need to see Twitch, you know, really do something, uh, besides just, oh,

01:59:57.360 --> 02:00:01.200
we're going to ban for these certain words, like actually do them.

02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:05.920
So, well, here's the funny thing too, is like, like after this announcement came out, there

02:00:05.920 --> 02:00:12.880
was actually, um, one of the, uh, team members of, I guess the Atlanta phase who go, his

02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:13.760
name is Simp.

02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:19.760
And so he's like, uh, I have like some issues with this idea.

02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:25.680
Well, but, but also this is also, I honestly, Loki, like I get that, but I think this is

02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:30.400
a problem where people are fixated on the headline and the headline going around is

02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:32.880
Twitch has banned Simp in cell version.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:40.160
People aren't reading the fucking article and noticing that it's banned when used in

02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:44.800
certain contexts and there's no blanket robot ban on those words.

02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:52.640
So that guy who called himself Simp is not by context breaking the rule just by existing.

02:00:53.440 --> 02:01:01.040
It's if somebody decides to take it to a place where they're making fun, you know, then I

02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:05.440
feel like people are reacting to a headline only without really looking at the details

02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:05.920
of it.

02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:07.040
And that works both ways.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:09.360
So, sure.

02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:09.680
All right.

02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:15.520
Sia Tabiri in chat says, share, you're a Simp in cell virgin who can't drive.

02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:21.040
That'll be the remake, Sia Tabiri, the unavoidable remake of Clueless.

02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:26.640
I hope, I hope some of you caught my reference there to the holy text of the great Alicia

02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:27.520
Silverstone classic.

02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:27.920
Thank you.

02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:28.720
Thank you, Dark Sakura.

02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:29.920
I knew if anyone would.

02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:30.480
All right.

02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:32.960
Rest in peace, Brittany Murphy, Forever in Our Hearts.

02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:34.560
All right, moving on.

02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:36.240
Let's get to some other stuff.

02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:36.880
Dark Sakura.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:45.440
Well, we had talked a little bit about, you know, safety and trying to ban whatever.

02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:49.840
So we have news from Afghanistan.

02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:53.840
They've banned PUBG and called for regulation of video games.

02:01:53.840 --> 02:02:01.280
As the Afghanistan Telecom Regulatory Authority, the ATRA announced that they decided to ban

02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:06.080
PUBG temporarily after a comprehensive assessment.

02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:11.840
They held meetings with various ministries like their religious affairs, education, public

02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:17.840
health, communications and science, psychologists, parents, headmasters of schools, telecom,

02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:23.360
civil activists and PUBG gamers before submitting a report to the authority board.

02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:28.800
And the quote, the decision was taken to block this game on a temporary basis, considering

02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:30.880
social and security perspectives.

02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:37.920
ATRA continues investigations and consultations to find out a permanent solution there, too.

02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:45.600
They were saying that the games have negative impacts on children,

02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:54.320
um, that they want to provide support for games that comply with Afghan and social culture,

02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:56.080
as well as religious values.

02:02:56.720 --> 02:02:59.840
And so the ban, well, they didn't say so.

02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:02.240
It also would apply to, I think, all iterations of PUBG.

02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:10.560
And they've now joined the list of other countries like Nepal, Iraq, Jordan, Pakistan, India,

02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:20.000
um, to prevent in some places said negative effects or to be harmful for society and would

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.880
also cause a potential national security threat.

02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:34.160
In Pakistan, the ban was temporary with the Islamabad High Court lifting that ban later.

02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:41.040
Um, the country, though, in India, there are things saying that their ministry of electronics

02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:47.040
and I.T. were alleging that the game was stealing user data in an unauthorized manner for servers

02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:48.480
outside of India.

02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:51.280
So there you go.

02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:52.000
Interesting.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:56.400
A very real reaction from S.H.A. 100 Matt in our chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network,

02:03:56.400 --> 02:04:00.080
who says the folks who care will fire up those VPNs to play.

02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:01.120
Yeah.

02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:03.840
So kind of go outside the ban using that.

02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:05.520
And that's that's for sure.

02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:09.840
But not every day you hear about a country banning a video game.

02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:11.520
So interesting nonetheless.

02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:13.760
So all right.

02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:14.800
Well, let's move on.

02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:15.300
Loki.

02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:18.020
All right.

02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:24.720
So we it's been a couple of weeks since the game awards, but we have some of the kind

02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:25.840
of numbers and everything.

02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:29.920
So not surprising because everybody's stuck at home.

02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:36.800
Viewership has increased by 83 percent, and that was over eight point three million viewers

02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:39.120
that tuned into the game awards this year.

02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:43.600
So pretty, pretty decent size event, I think.

02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:49.520
And so that was all coming from Jeff Keighley on Twitter talking about the viewership for

02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:50.000
that.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:54.800
And of course, you know, I expect it to be even bigger next year.

02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:56.160
So pretty awesome.

02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:02.560
Yeah, I think you're right that probably the stay at home probably played into that a lot.

02:05:02.560 --> 02:05:04.640
There's just more people in general watching TV.

02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:07.760
But I think there is something to be said about this particular award show is getting

02:05:07.760 --> 02:05:08.880
a lot more credit.

02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:12.880
And I think a lot more of the co-streaming is helping, too.

02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:15.920
Like, I'm not just saying that to toot our own horns here at VOG Network, but I think

02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:20.560
there's a lot of people out there that are creating an event out of this like a watching

02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:25.040
event, you know, similar to, you know, an E3 press conference or some other type of

02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:30.240
big event watching and doing it live is very important, because if you're not watching

02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:33.040
it live, you're going to get it all spoiled for you on Twitter and the newsletter.

02:05:33.040 --> 02:05:36.560
So I think it has become kind of event watching in that regard.

02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:42.640
And I think even, you know, when we look at next year and, you know, hopefully by December

02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:48.000
some sense of normalcy returning that you're still going to see that this does very well.

02:05:48.960 --> 02:05:53.280
So I know I'll still be watching and we'll probably still do another live react like

02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:54.240
we did last time.

02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:55.200
It was fun.

02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:55.700
Yeah.

02:05:56.480 --> 02:05:56.980
All right.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:02.000
For our last story tonight, you knew I had to talk about this at some point because this

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:03.200
was one of those.

02:06:03.200 --> 02:06:05.600
Maybe I would have chosen my words differently, Doug.

02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:07.680
Let's talk about this.

02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:09.280
So this was in the interview.

02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:14.960
Yes, I don't know why I saved this one for last night.

02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:20.560
I feel like sometimes in the B block, we don't really have, like, great big things

02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:21.680
to comment on.

02:06:21.680 --> 02:06:23.760
So I was like, let's save this one for last.

02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:32.880
So, Doug, let's talk about what you said this week and who I'm referring to is the Nintendo

02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:35.920
of America president, Doug Bowser.

02:06:35.920 --> 02:06:38.080
You'll never be Reggie Fils-Aime.

02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:38.880
You'll never.

02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:41.280
You're just a, you're a CEO.

02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:42.800
No one will have the Reggie jawline.

02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:44.800
You're a CEO who can't drive.

02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:47.840
All right, look, Doug, I'm just being an asshole.

02:06:47.840 --> 02:06:54.000
Like, Doug Bowser is fine, but this particular quote in this particular interview and this

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:57.200
particular answer to this particular question ain't it.

02:06:58.160 --> 02:06:59.280
So what am I talking about?

02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:01.200
So he did an interview with Polygon.

02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:04.880
There's a whole other thing I could talk about, but I'm not going to tonight.

02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:07.520
He did.

02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:13.520
I'm going to just start calling him Porygon, like the really crappy looking Pokemon.

02:07:13.520 --> 02:07:20.000
So Bowser did an interview with Porygon and he was talking about special releases like

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:21.920
Super Mario 3D All-Stars.

02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:28.400
And basically the question that came up was, you know, what, what, why are you doing this?

02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:29.680
Why are you end dating?

02:07:29.680 --> 02:07:32.480
It seems like you guys really like March 31st.

02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:36.640
You're not going to let people buy Mario 3D All-Stars after that fact and, you know,

02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:38.800
Super Mario 35, you know.

02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:41.600
So how does Mr. Bowser respond to this?

02:07:42.240 --> 02:07:45.920
I think I use a simple word, celebration.

02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:52.720
It's just, this is a celebration of Mario's 35th anniversary and we wanted to celebrate

02:07:52.720 --> 02:07:54.880
in unique and different ways.

02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:59.680
And we've done that through games like Super Mario 3D All-Stars, or we will be doing that

02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:04.320
through future releases like Super Mario 3D World and Bowser's Fury.

02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:06.800
That wasn't the question, Doug.

02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:13.680
That wasn't an opportunity to sell more copies of Super Mario 3D World, Doug.

02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:16.960
It's not about celebration, Doug.

02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:21.840
It's about why are you stopping to sell these games on March 31st?

02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:28.080
So there are various ways that we're celebrating Mario's 35th and with some of these titles,

02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:33.440
we felt it was an opportunity to release them for a limited period of time.

02:08:33.440 --> 02:08:35.200
They've done very, very well.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:39.440
In other words, you stupids bought it.

02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:47.760
Roll credits because that's what it boils down to.

02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:51.280
The celebration is we made a lot of fucking money.

02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:53.600
That's the celebration.

02:08:54.240 --> 02:08:59.680
We found when we artificially create shortages that it drives up sales.

02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:03.120
And so now we're moving that to digital products is what he meant to say.

02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:06.800
Shall I continue with a quote?

02:09:06.800 --> 02:09:07.520
Oh, yes, I will.

02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:14.240
Super Mario 3D All-Stars has sold over 2.6 million units in the US alone.

02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:18.880
And so clearly consumers have been able to jump in and enjoy that.

02:09:18.880 --> 02:09:22.400
And it's not strategy that we're going to be using widely.

02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:26.320
Notice how he says they might use it again, though.

02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:32.560
But it's one we thought was very unique for the actual anniversary.

02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:35.520
Yes, Doug, I would call it unique.

02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:37.840
That's a good word.

02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:41.360
Oh, Doug, I'm just going to, like, start using Doug.

02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:47.680
Like I don't know why I've decided to just call him Doug.

02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:49.200
But that is that is where I'm at.

02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:51.440
That is the reaction I had to this whole thing.

02:09:51.440 --> 02:09:56.640
OK, I propose from here out that any time someone in the video game industry

02:09:56.640 --> 02:09:57.680
says something stupid.

02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:00.640
They're Doug, like a Karen.

02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:03.200
Sure, Doug.

02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:03.760
You know what?

02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:07.200
An amazing 90s Nickelodeon cartoon you are not.

02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:10.160
No, you are not quail man.

02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:11.440
Look, here's the thing.

02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:15.680
And again, I know I sound like I'm just dumping on him based on this one bad quote.

02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:20.720
But this is this is the shit that really annoys us about Nintendo is.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.440
It's a celebration.

02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:27.040
No, it's not as you did this to sell more copies of the game.

02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:30.240
And in this interview, you are basically saying it worked.

02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:31.600
You bought it, suckers.

02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:37.200
But he can't really say that because Doug is the president of Nintendo.

02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:45.520
And so Doug cannot just say, well, we did this so we would sell as much as possible

02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:50.080
this fiscal year with our kind of weaker than usual holiday lineup,

02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:55.520
because that's that's not an answer Doug can give Doug.

02:10:55.520 --> 02:11:04.640
Let's see what our our commenters have to say over at twitch.tv.

02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:05.360
You okay over there?

02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:12.320
Yeah, I just keep knocking into my thing and I'm showing my gym teacher Dean Winchester.

02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:13.440
Okay.

02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:15.120
To cleanse the palette.

02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:19.680
Phoenix7726 says, well, Doug is no Reggie.

02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:24.480
Questbuster says it's a celebration of sales numbers.

02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:27.760
Sia Tabiri says, now I have Patty.

02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:30.240
You're the mayonnaise for me stuck in my head.

02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:31.040
You're welcome.

02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:35.280
And for the record, that's the only kind of mayonnaise I tolerate is mayonnaise named Patty.

02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:38.480
I like mayonnaise on a patty.

02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:41.600
And sj100 matt says this isn't funny, Doug.

02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:48.480
And sj100 matt says you get no points and may God have mercy on your soul, Doug.

02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:53.520
I'm just gonna stick with okay, Doug.

02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:56.160
That's now a thing, but it's a thing in my head.

02:11:56.160 --> 02:11:56.880
It was a thing.

02:11:56.880 --> 02:11:58.400
It was a thing I heard.

02:11:58.400 --> 02:11:58.800
All right.

02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:01.680
Thanks for letting us know, Doug.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:04.400
All right.

02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:07.840
Anyhow, let's get to the listener roundtable.

02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:14.720
If you want to say, okay, Rob, I have a question for you or Jamie or Matt.

02:12:14.720 --> 02:12:15.920
What's your question?

02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:17.440
You can ask that now in our chat room.

02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:20.960
It's the listener roundtable we have via chat and emails.

02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:22.800
Every week we invite you guys to email us.

02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:25.200
Participate at orangelandtrader.com.

02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:28.640
If you'd like to send us an email letting us know your thoughts for the week.

02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:30.480
I don't know if we had anything tonight,

02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:33.840
but I will ask the queen of the mailbag dark Sakura what she found.

02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:36.480
Oh, two emails.

02:12:36.480 --> 02:12:37.680
And one of them is from me.

02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:39.360
Oh, how nice.

02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:40.400
Yep.

02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:41.680
Hey, Jamie.

02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:43.600
Just a follow-up email from last week.

02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:44.880
See from me.

02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:46.400
I finally started Animal Crossing.

02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:48.880
I got to say I'm pretty hooked for some reason.

02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:52.240
I am having an issue where the holiday ornaments will spawn in my trees.

02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:54.080
So I can't craft any holiday stuff.

02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:57.040
I've tried to time travel and try to fix it, but nothing.

02:12:57.040 --> 02:12:58.080
Please don't time travel.

02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:02.960
It seems like every video I find people who already have Isabella unlocked and I don't have her yet.

02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:06.640
I guess she is the one who makes the holiday announcements.

02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:07.120
True.

02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:07.680
Any ideas?

02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:09.520
I hope to visit your island soon and check it out.

02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:12.320
Happy holidays, everyone.

02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:14.160
This is from Frodo Swagons.

02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:16.960
The thing is, is that you're not going to be able to do it yet in your own village.

02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:27.360
You get the recipes after you have the town center and get more of the DIYs and stuff.

02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:28.960
So you do need Isabel.

02:13:29.680 --> 02:13:37.920
However, I would be more than happy to make you the things that I can if you want to.

02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:39.680
I think I got your friend code.

02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:45.040
Message me on Twitter, because that's really where I spend most of my social online time.

02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:47.280
It's at Dark Sakura.

02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:48.400
S-A-K-U-R-A.

02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:57.680
And we'll work out a time for you to come over and shake my trees, get my ornaments.

02:13:57.680 --> 02:13:59.600
That's very nice of you to offer.

02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:03.520
But yeah, that was to say, that's what my gut was saying, too.

02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:08.000
Even though I haven't played Animal Crossing in a few months, I've abandoned my poor villagers.

02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:11.200
You probably got roaches in your house.

02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:11.700
Probably.

02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:14.180
What?

02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:20.720
I was just gonna say, it's probably the whole, like, it takes 10 days or is it 14 to really

02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:21.920
get your town up and running.

02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:26.400
And that's probably the issue is that that time gating in the beginning is probably stopping

02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:27.760
all the events from unlocking.

02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:31.680
Unfortunately, it's just not a great time to start, unfortunately.

02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:36.880
But you have a great answer there is that if you can't do it in your town, you go to

02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:37.760
someone else's town.

02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:40.320
You get to do a full cycle of the year, though.

02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:44.240
The thing is that you're still not going to be able to get those DIYs unless someone gives

02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:44.740
them to you.

02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:47.600
And I think you're only getting one per.

02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:53.760
So if I happen to somehow get any, because I make Dan give me all the ones that he finds

02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:58.720
because I haven't been able to find any myself, let me know.

02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:00.080
I will save what I can for you.

02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:05.200
Catch snowflakes in the meantime, if you can catch snowflakes in your early village.

02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:13.680
And I'll make you like a snowflake door ornament or a few things that I can with the, you know,

02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:18.960
like a ski wall or something or an iceberg floor, something like that.

02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:23.440
I'm still wanting more of those like the holiday decor.

02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:26.800
I mean, even though it's like not my fucking holiday, I'm kind of sick of it already.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:29.760
Not saying that other people enjoy it.

02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:31.840
I just don't like the Jesus stuff.

02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:36.160
Um, but I like trees and I like lights and I like all of that.

02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:41.360
So if anyone also gets those recipes and do you do what some of my friends do and call

02:15:41.360 --> 02:15:42.480
them a Hanukkah bush?

02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:44.560
Because I always thought that was no, I do not know.

02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:46.880
That's honestly the stupidest thing I've ever heard of.

02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:48.720
I had a friend who did that.

02:15:48.720 --> 02:15:49.440
I thought it was funny.

02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:55.600
Oh, the thing is, is that and I actually kind of got into it on my Facebook with somebody

02:15:55.600 --> 02:16:01.760
about that big house that was lit up for Hanukkah is that it's kind of like Hanukkah is not

02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:02.800
a big holiday.

02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:04.400
It's like pretty tiny.

02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:13.440
And on top of that, it's like, it's kind of not the best thing to try to turn a holiday

02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:19.920
that has nothing in common with, you know, Christmas or all the shit that goes with Christmas

02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:21.040
into something that it's not.

02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:22.720
I get it.

02:16:22.720 --> 02:16:23.280
Yeah.

02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:25.600
Like, you know, it's, it's, it's,

02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:27.440
this only happened because of kids, right?

02:16:27.440 --> 02:16:30.800
They didn't want kids to feel left out during this, during this part of the year.

02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:33.040
And non-practicing Jews.

02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:33.760
Yeah, I get it.

02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:34.240
I get it.

02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:37.520
But the other thing too, is it like, there's this whole commandment about assimilation

02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:38.880
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:43.920
Um, because I mean, technically, if you're looking at Christmas, it's a pagan holiday

02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:46.000
that was co-opted by early Christians.

02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:56.480
So just saying, you know, um, but at the same time, uh, Hanukkah is, I think the only celebrated

02:16:56.480 --> 02:16:59.200
holiday that is not at all in Torah.

02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:01.520
It came from the book of the Maccabees.

02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:07.280
And that was, it's more biblical Apocrypha instead of actual Torah.

02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:09.920
And there's your Judaism lesson of the season.

02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:10.320
Thank you.

02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:11.520
All right.

02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:14.960
But I like it because I can set shit on fire and eat potatoes.

02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:20.400
Who knew that an Animal Crossing email would set the only year on Orange L'Andrea.

02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:21.040
Next email.

02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:23.280
All right.

02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:26.160
But yeah, Frodo Zwagens just messaged me on Twitter.

02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:33.520
Anyway, um, the only other email that we got is Dear OLR, I hope you are all well and managing

02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:38.160
to stay in chipper spirits, even if we may not be able to spend the holidays with companies

02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:39.440
would want to this year.

02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:42.480
Personally, this year has been a good time to escape to video games.

02:17:42.480 --> 02:17:46.720
I found myself lately not wanting to leave a game behind right after beating it, which

02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:48.240
brings me to my question.

02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:52.160
Are there any games you found yourself so invested in you made it a point to 100% to

02:17:52.160 --> 02:17:52.960
complete them?

02:17:53.600 --> 02:17:59.040
In the last couple of days, I got the platinum trophy for God of War, my second platinum

02:17:59.040 --> 02:18:01.520
as my first was Nier Automata.

02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:07.200
This game was an interesting case because when I started it, I was very half interested.

02:18:07.200 --> 02:18:09.360
I thought it would be a slog to get through it.

02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:13.600
And then the story started to really draw me in once some new characters were introduced

02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:16.960
and the world took on a scale I had previously underestimated.

02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:21.440
I felt the need to explore all of it, taking on some challenging bosses in the process

02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:23.200
that were incredibly thrilling to fight.

02:18:24.560 --> 02:18:28.320
I will go ahead and pause at that point in the email and say I was like that with Mass

02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:28.720
Effect.

02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:31.520
And then I started doing boundary breaks and trying to see actually how the game was put

02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:32.020
together.

02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:36.160
But I never bothered for platinums on anything.

02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:39.600
I usually like, you know, I jump from one game to another.

02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:40.960
I've talked about that a lot on this show.

02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:45.040
It's not often that I get in that mode where I'm like, I will do everything I possibly

02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:45.840
can in this game.

02:18:46.400 --> 02:18:50.480
Oddly enough, the MMOs kind of end up working that way for me, even though I'll never

02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:51.120
reach the end.

02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:54.960
It's kind of one of those that's and that's maybe why I don't have all the platinum

02:18:54.960 --> 02:18:56.160
trophies to show for it.

02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:57.760
As you guys, oftentimes it's the MMOs.

02:18:58.480 --> 02:19:02.480
But I remember one distinctly was Diablo 3 when that came out.

02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:03.680
That was your jam for a while.

02:19:03.680 --> 02:19:04.400
Oh, my God.

02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:05.520
Like, I don't know what happened.

02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:07.920
I was just like, I will get a platinum in this fucking game.

02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:09.200
I will get that trophy.

02:19:09.200 --> 02:19:09.760
And I did.

02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:12.400
And then they decided to release more trophies.

02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:16.880
So it's funny, even though I have the platinum trophy in Diablo 3, I do not have all the

02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:20.160
trophies because I never bought the Necromancer expansion on PlayStation.

02:19:20.720 --> 02:19:22.880
So it's kind of one of those interesting little.

02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:27.200
Oh, I got I got something that I really shouldn't have because I don't have every trophy.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:37.440
But I did this time kick for a little while where I was trying to get different different

02:19:37.440 --> 02:19:38.400
weird achievements.

02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:44.720
And well, remember when I was trying to get, like, the book achievements and getting, like,

02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:49.600
different like masking potions or whatever to make it into, you know, or sneaking in

02:19:49.600 --> 02:19:51.040
through the sewers to get to.

02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:54.880
Why can't I think the under city?

02:19:54.880 --> 02:19:56.480
Yeah, that's a great example, though.

02:19:56.480 --> 02:19:57.840
Achievements in the MMOs.

02:19:57.840 --> 02:20:03.040
I do hunt that stuff because, you know, in like in WoW, you would get titles or maybe

02:20:03.040 --> 02:20:04.720
little pets for certain ones.

02:20:04.720 --> 02:20:06.400
And it's the same thing of Final Fantasy.

02:20:06.400 --> 02:20:08.720
Like, there's a lot of minions as your title.

02:20:08.720 --> 02:20:09.680
Yeah, exactly.

02:20:09.680 --> 02:20:12.560
So, yeah, I hunt that stuff in MMOs all the time.

02:20:12.560 --> 02:20:15.760
So I just like the really the really fun, crazy ones.

02:20:15.760 --> 02:20:20.320
But the challenging one for me was getting all of the on an alliance character, getting

02:20:20.320 --> 02:20:21.920
the reading material and under city.

02:20:22.800 --> 02:20:23.600
Loki, what about you?

02:20:23.600 --> 02:20:25.040
Is there anything where you sat down?

02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:27.040
You said I will fully complete this game.

02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:30.880
There's I don't know.

02:20:30.880 --> 02:20:37.440
Like, I think maybe like a lot of the Lego games all end up getting everything in.

02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:41.440
I don't know if I've done it for Saints Row, though.

02:20:41.440 --> 02:20:44.640
I think there's been some tedious missions that I haven't been able to do.

02:20:44.640 --> 02:20:48.560
And then there's also some stuff I think we have to play the game fully co-op, which

02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:49.440
I haven't done.

02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:56.080
And also in some games like Saints Row 2, it's impossible because a lot of it had its

02:20:56.080 --> 02:21:00.000
humans that had to do with online play, which doesn't exist anymore.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:00.500
So.

02:21:02.400 --> 02:21:05.040
Yeah, I think it's just mainly like the Lego games and stuff.

02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:10.240
All right, moving on with the email, then.

02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:13.440
Actually, though, I did have another one that I'm kind of doing it in, and that is Animal

02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:13.940
Crossing.

02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:19.360
Not necessarily their achievements, but there are a lot of I'm trying to finish like some

02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:20.960
of the Nook Mile stuff.

02:21:22.320 --> 02:21:23.200
For the Nook Points.

02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:28.080
So like the redecorating my house a certain number of times, catching certain fish, and

02:21:28.080 --> 02:21:30.080
I'm trying to fill out my inventory.

02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:38.080
So I want to have as complete of a catalog as I can and try to get all the fish and all

02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:44.560
of the I already have like a full museum for my fossils, but I want all the artwork.

02:21:44.560 --> 02:21:50.160
So it's more like a personal one for me, but I also get my Nook achievements with it.

02:21:50.160 --> 02:21:55.040
So great example, because Animal Crossing and Nintendo in general doesn't have platinum

02:21:55.040 --> 02:22:00.320
trophies or achievements, but it has its own kind of system built into the game.

02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:01.920
So you're kind of working on that.

02:22:01.920 --> 02:22:06.960
Yeah, I kind of don't really give a shit about it, like on a system level, if that makes

02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:11.840
sense, like I don't really care about any character or personal achievement, because

02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:15.600
honestly, my life is worth more than what a video game tells me it is.

02:22:16.560 --> 02:22:20.640
So, but for me, this is just something fun that I do to add a little bit more replayability

02:22:20.640 --> 02:22:21.600
to the game.

02:22:21.600 --> 02:22:28.800
So to continue on with the email, this year also has had me return to older games to 100%

02:22:28.800 --> 02:22:29.600
them.

02:22:29.600 --> 02:22:34.560
I did things like finally getting all 100 gold skulltulas in Ocarina of Time, as well

02:22:34.560 --> 02:22:38.960
as getting the 120 stars in the Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Galaxy.

02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:40.960
Anyway, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.

02:22:40.960 --> 02:22:44.000
Season's greetings and many game beatings, Garth Wolf.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:45.440
I love that.

02:22:45.440 --> 02:22:46.640
I'm stealing that dude.

02:22:46.640 --> 02:22:47.760
Many game beatings.

02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:48.260
Love that.

02:22:48.800 --> 02:22:50.800
I am actually putting that on my freaking Twitter.

02:22:52.240 --> 02:22:54.800
That is like the coolest thing that I've seen all day.

02:22:54.800 --> 02:22:55.520
All right.

02:22:55.520 --> 02:22:56.320
Thanks for the email.

02:22:57.600 --> 02:22:58.480
Yeah, thanks Garth.

02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:00.960
Party on Garth.

02:23:00.960 --> 02:23:06.480
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for the future here

02:23:06.480 --> 02:23:07.280
on the show.

02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:08.240
Let me get to chat.

02:23:08.240 --> 02:23:10.160
I thought I saw a question way back.

02:23:10.160 --> 02:23:12.880
We started talking about the, oh, here we go.

02:23:12.880 --> 02:23:15.200
No one special with a round table question for us tonight.

02:23:15.200 --> 02:23:19.200
With all the miscellaneous storefronts having started their holiday sales or about to start

02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:23.680
them, are any of you planning on getting that one game that you've been eyeing for a while

02:23:23.680 --> 02:23:24.000
now?

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:25.920
If you are, what game?

02:23:25.920 --> 02:23:28.880
Oh, I know no one special loves to talk about sales and discounts.

02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:30.800
Good question though.

02:23:30.800 --> 02:23:34.320
Is there something I've been holding out for on a particular sale?

02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:41.120
I've had, this may shock you, but there's like just a lot of weird shit has been, 2020

02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:42.400
has like warped my mind.

02:23:42.960 --> 02:23:46.640
So like all of a sudden I'm super into the Pokemon mainline games.

02:23:46.640 --> 02:23:47.760
When was that going to happen?

02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:48.320
Right.

02:23:48.320 --> 02:23:52.640
But the other thing I've had my eye on, I kind of really want to get Mortal Kombat 11.

02:23:53.600 --> 02:24:00.080
So I'm waiting for like the rights, like, but I want the all in one and done package,

02:24:00.080 --> 02:24:03.760
like all the characters, all the story.

02:24:03.760 --> 02:24:08.720
I want one fucking game with it all, which I think is just Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate,

02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:09.840
if I'm not mistaken.

02:24:09.840 --> 02:24:13.760
So I'm kind of waiting that to hit the sweet spot and then I'll probably pick it up and

02:24:13.760 --> 02:24:15.600
look away when the fatalities happen.

02:24:15.600 --> 02:24:18.480
But I mean, as a fighter game, those games are really solid fighters.

02:24:19.040 --> 02:24:23.040
Um, and I'll wait for an injustice, which will be more up my alley.

02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:27.840
So, um, that's my answer to that.

02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:29.920
Anything you guys are holding out on a good sale for?

02:24:34.240 --> 02:24:36.880
Some stuff I want is actually on sale right now.

02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:42.480
Um, on Steam, um, it's just, it's hard for me to sit down and play anything on my computer

02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:44.400
with some of the back problems I've been having lately.

02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:49.760
Um, but like Wadham just got its release and I really wanted to play that.

02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:53.840
Um, and, uh, Death Stranding is on sale.

02:24:53.840 --> 02:24:55.600
Hold on, I'm actually looking at my wishlist right now.

02:24:56.400 --> 02:25:01.440
Um, because I got, yeah, Detroit Become Human actually, I think was on sale briefly, but

02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:05.120
yeah, Wadham is on and it's on sale for like 10 bucks.

02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:06.260
Nice.

02:25:07.040 --> 02:25:07.540
Purchased.

02:25:08.340 --> 02:25:15.300
Um, Epic store has given out those $10 gift card or $10, uh, discounts or whatever.

02:25:15.300 --> 02:25:20.740
And basically if you downloaded city skylines, which is free, um, you got 10 bucks.

02:25:21.300 --> 02:25:22.820
So I don't know.

02:25:22.820 --> 02:25:29.300
I was looking at, um, that last, the harmonics game that you just released, but yeah, fuser.

02:25:29.300 --> 02:25:29.860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:25:29.860 --> 02:25:31.060
I've been looking at it too.

02:25:31.060 --> 02:25:33.060
It's still like, it's still $49.

02:25:34.020 --> 02:25:38.260
And like, I looked at all the DLC and stuff and I'm like, eh, that's so expensive.

02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:40.340
So I may wait on that.

02:25:40.340 --> 02:25:46.820
So, you know how I said I really wanted to do a, um, uh, make a, uh, visual novel.

02:25:48.340 --> 02:25:51.860
And, you know, visual novel maker is like for the whole thing is like 70 bucks.

02:25:51.860 --> 02:25:52.980
Oh, is it on sale?

02:25:53.700 --> 02:25:55.460
75% off.

02:25:56.340 --> 02:25:57.140
You better get on that.

02:25:57.940 --> 02:25:58.440
Yeah.

02:25:58.900 --> 02:25:59.400
Nice.

02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:00.520
I'm going to go broke.

02:26:00.520 --> 02:26:03.480
So maybe my, my book will end up being a visual novel.

02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:06.600
If, uh, somebody wants to help me with your artwork.

02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:07.100
Nice.

02:26:07.100 --> 02:26:11.080
Ooh, I should look in some of that, um, game making software, even though we all know I

02:26:11.080 --> 02:26:12.600
don't have the attention span to do it.

02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:15.560
I'm always kind of looking at that stuff, uh, on steam.

02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:19.240
I'm sure a lot of it's, uh, going on deep discount here and Alan probably has.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.720
I would just wait for like humble bundles, man.

02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:27.000
They've got so many things that they offer on there.

02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:32.520
Um, like discounts for different, like game making things and like tools.

02:26:32.520 --> 02:26:37.080
In fact, that that's where I was going right now is I was trying to see and like, do I

02:26:37.080 --> 02:26:38.360
have that already?

02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:41.000
Because I very well may have that already.

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:44.600
I'm going to, I'm actually going to, I'm going to ask Alan real quick.

02:26:44.600 --> 02:26:46.200
Cause he's a big PC gamer.

02:26:46.200 --> 02:26:52.040
Um, I won't make him come on cam cause he's not dressed for it, but, um, he just gave

02:26:52.040 --> 02:26:53.880
me this look that was really funny.

02:26:53.880 --> 02:26:55.720
Is there any, yes, I am right.

02:26:55.720 --> 02:27:01.800
Is there any steam sale, any steam game that you're looking forward to since, you know,

02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:04.760
you're, you're playing Skyrim again right now.

02:27:04.760 --> 02:27:07.640
That's, you know, games like what, 10 years old at this point.

02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:12.120
Um, is there anything you've kind of been waiting for the right sale on a game before

02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:13.160
you finally jump into it?

02:27:14.680 --> 02:27:18.120
He's thinking Witcher three, maybe he's suggesting.

02:27:18.680 --> 02:27:19.080
Yeah.

02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:22.200
I mean, you know, now the CD project reds finally moved on.

02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:23.720
They got a whole other problem.

02:27:23.720 --> 02:27:26.360
I think it's safe to say nothing further will be done on Witcher threes.

02:27:26.360 --> 02:27:26.840
There's that.

02:27:26.840 --> 02:27:27.320
Okay.

02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:27.820
Yeah.

02:27:28.280 --> 02:27:34.040
There's a, there's actually some pretty interesting sales, like moonlighter, uh, vigil, uh, resident

02:27:34.040 --> 02:27:36.200
evil resistance, oxygen not included.

02:27:36.200 --> 02:27:37.880
Those all seem to be on sale.

02:27:40.440 --> 02:27:40.920
All right.

02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:41.420
Neat.

02:27:42.280 --> 02:27:42.780
All right.

02:27:43.400 --> 02:27:47.480
Well, if that's it, then I think we're getting down to last minute stories.

02:27:47.480 --> 02:27:51.720
I don't know if we have any of those before we wrap it all up, uh, dark soccer or Loki.

02:27:52.280 --> 02:27:52.600
Yeah.

02:27:52.600 --> 02:27:53.100
Yeah.

02:27:54.120 --> 02:27:54.620
Yeah.

02:27:55.080 --> 02:27:59.160
So let's talk back about, uh, cyberpunk again.

02:27:59.160 --> 02:28:00.520
Oh, apparently cyberpunk.

02:28:01.160 --> 02:28:02.840
Cyberpunk has a problem.

02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:05.400
They have a dildo problem.

02:28:06.280 --> 02:28:12.360
Distracting number of dildos are apparently appearing in the game as a problem or feature

02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:19.640
both little call may little call and be surrounded by dicks all the time.

02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:20.440
I mean, seriously.

02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:27.800
So apparently they're going to be fine tuning that to see if they can, um, uh, tone it down

02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:30.280
a bit, but yeah, it is.

02:28:30.280 --> 02:28:33.640
It's something, well, in certain districts in the game, they have like a red light district

02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:39.640
that, you know, that stuff's everywhere, but yeah, it's, it's silly.

02:28:42.040 --> 02:28:42.680
All right.

02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:44.760
Anything else besides dildo updates?

02:28:45.640 --> 02:28:46.440
That's it.

02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:46.680
All right.

02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:48.440
Oh, well, that's a good note to end on.

02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:48.940
All right.

02:28:49.900 --> 02:28:51.500
Let's wrap it up then.

02:28:51.500 --> 02:28:54.460
Uh, final thoughts and good night time.

02:28:54.460 --> 02:28:58.780
So, um, thank you guys, of course, as always for listening to the show, uh, downloading

02:28:58.780 --> 02:29:01.580
our show or listening live, however you consume the show.

02:29:01.580 --> 02:29:03.100
Thank you so much for doing that.

02:29:03.100 --> 02:29:05.180
Uh, and, uh, please help us spread the word.

02:29:05.180 --> 02:29:10.300
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need the, the, the voices out there,

02:29:10.300 --> 02:29:12.700
uh, to come join us on the show.

02:29:12.700 --> 02:29:16.700
So help us spread the word, tell a friend or two about the show, leave us a nice review

02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:20.220
wherever it is you found the show and, uh, really appreciate that.

02:29:20.220 --> 02:29:26.940
And of course, um, since we don't have another show until I think the 26th, no 27th will

02:29:26.940 --> 02:29:31.420
be the next show, um, have, have a good holiday, whether it already passed or whether it's

02:29:31.420 --> 02:29:33.980
upcoming, uh, hope everybody's having a good holiday.

02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:37.100
And I know everybody's kind of starting their vacations too.

02:29:37.100 --> 02:29:41.580
Um, please be safe, uh, just because there is a vaccine that doesn't mean the pandemic

02:29:41.580 --> 02:29:41.980
is over.

02:29:42.620 --> 02:29:44.460
Um, they're giving it to all the rich people.

02:29:44.460 --> 02:29:45.180
Yes, that's true.

02:29:45.180 --> 02:29:46.620
They're giving it to all the rich people first.

02:29:47.340 --> 02:29:50.460
Um, so please, uh, please stay safe.

02:29:50.460 --> 02:29:52.620
Um, I'm not doing anything for the holidays this year.

02:29:52.620 --> 02:29:53.820
We canceled all our plans.

02:29:53.820 --> 02:29:55.580
I don't want to do anything.

02:29:55.580 --> 02:29:59.980
So, um, you know, uh, I'll be catching up on some games, maybe try to pour some of that

02:29:59.980 --> 02:30:01.660
energy into creative stuff.

02:30:01.660 --> 02:30:05.180
Um, maybe try to make some more, you know, videos on demand and things like that.

02:30:05.180 --> 02:30:05.900
We'll see.

02:30:05.900 --> 02:30:07.660
Um, so just be safe guys.

02:30:07.660 --> 02:30:10.300
Uh, anyway, let's get everybody's actual final thoughts here.

02:30:10.300 --> 02:30:16.940
Um, I guess I pretty much gave mine, but I will elaborate and say, oh, this holiday

02:30:16.940 --> 02:30:20.220
would be a great time to start a marathon game of civilization.

02:30:20.220 --> 02:30:21.500
I think maybe that's something I'll do.

02:30:21.500 --> 02:30:23.260
Cause I actually have the time to do it.

02:30:23.260 --> 02:30:25.100
Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:30:25.980 --> 02:30:27.980
Uh, just gonna be working more on my game.

02:30:27.980 --> 02:30:30.780
So I'm keep, keep on working on that.

02:30:31.660 --> 02:30:32.300
Great.

02:30:32.300 --> 02:30:34.540
And last but not least, Stark soccer, your final thought.

02:30:34.540 --> 02:30:42.700
I attempted to give you a Duolingo, uh, uh, subscription for Japanese.

02:30:43.340 --> 02:30:43.660
Nah.

02:30:43.660 --> 02:30:45.500
Um, I don't know.

02:30:45.500 --> 02:30:48.140
Um, actually I do have one.

02:30:48.140 --> 02:30:49.660
Be kind to people.

02:30:49.660 --> 02:30:53.660
Don't assume that just because someone looks like they're able-bodied, that they're not

02:30:53.660 --> 02:30:58.060
dealing with some difficulty or disability or something really hard in their life.

02:30:58.700 --> 02:31:00.220
Um, just be kind.

02:31:00.780 --> 02:31:01.260
That's all.

02:31:01.260 --> 02:31:01.900
Be kind.

02:31:02.460 --> 02:31:03.420
Be kind to other people.

02:31:03.420 --> 02:31:04.460
Be kind to yourself.

02:31:05.340 --> 02:31:05.740
All right.

02:31:06.540 --> 02:31:09.660
Or as my mom would say, can't you be fucking nice.

02:31:09.660 --> 02:31:10.380
It's Christmas.

02:31:11.020 --> 02:31:11.420
No, no, no.

02:31:11.420 --> 02:31:14.780
There's a difference between being nice and being kind.

02:31:14.780 --> 02:31:15.420
No, I got you.

02:31:15.420 --> 02:31:16.140
I got you.

02:31:16.140 --> 02:31:18.380
Being kind also means fucking fight.

02:31:19.340 --> 02:31:22.300
I couldn't help but think of that in the spirit of the holiday.

02:31:22.300 --> 02:31:23.420
What my mom used to say.

02:31:23.420 --> 02:31:23.740
All right.

02:31:23.740 --> 02:31:24.940
Your mom was cool.

02:31:24.940 --> 02:31:25.660
Yeah.

02:31:25.660 --> 02:31:26.300
All right.

02:31:26.300 --> 02:31:27.180
Anyway, that's it.

02:31:27.180 --> 02:31:28.700
We're going to have a great night.

02:31:28.700 --> 02:31:29.340
Great week.

02:31:29.340 --> 02:31:30.300
We'll see you next time.

02:31:30.940 --> 02:31:31.500
Bye everyone.

02:31:31.500 --> 02:31:31.900
Good night.
