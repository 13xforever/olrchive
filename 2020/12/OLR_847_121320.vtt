00:00.000 --> 00:13.500
This week, the one-two punch of stay-at-home orders a new console launches means the GameStop

00:13.500 --> 00:16.480
might finally turn a profit for the first quarter in multiple years.

00:16.480 --> 00:19.520
It's a shame their forward-looking statements don't acknowledge how short-lived this will

00:19.520 --> 00:20.520
be.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.920
Digital's only getting stronger, especially with new consoles launching with the Diskless

00:22.920 --> 00:23.920
edition.

00:23.920 --> 00:26.800
Customers may buy the console from GameStop, but what happens for the next five or more

00:26.800 --> 00:27.800
years?

00:27.800 --> 00:31.280
With one company continuing its low decline in obsolescence, it's time for your hosts,

00:31.280 --> 00:34.560
Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to give their opinions on this and the rest of the

00:34.560 --> 00:37.920
week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.920 --> 00:45.360
Hello, my friends out there on this internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:45.360 --> 00:47.560
where every gamer has a voice.

00:47.560 --> 00:54.920
It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again tonight with episode number 847 for this December

00:54.920 --> 01:02.200
the 13th of 2020, which kind of marks our two-year anniversary of sorts on Twitch.

01:02.200 --> 01:05.400
Now, granted, this show's been around way too long.

01:05.400 --> 01:09.800
We started in June of 2002, so we've been around about 18 and a half years, if you can

01:09.800 --> 01:10.800
believe it.

01:10.800 --> 01:15.840
We were doing shoutcasts before, but this is the two-year anniversary of Twitch because

01:15.840 --> 01:21.280
we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at VOG Network,

01:21.280 --> 01:26.200
twitch.tv slash VOG Network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:26.200 --> 01:30.080
I am Rob Roberts here in studio with you guys joining me.

01:30.080 --> 01:33.240
As always, I'm going to start with tech master Loki tonight.

01:33.240 --> 01:34.240
Hi, Loki.

01:34.240 --> 01:35.240
How are you?

01:35.240 --> 01:36.240
Hello.

01:36.240 --> 01:37.240
Hi.

01:37.240 --> 01:38.240
I'm good.

01:38.240 --> 01:39.240
Good.

01:39.240 --> 01:40.860
So a big shock reveal last night.

01:40.860 --> 01:45.560
So I'm going to spoiler the last episode if you haven't heard yet, but Loki's game was

01:45.560 --> 01:46.560
finally revealed.

01:46.560 --> 01:48.560
Oh, you mean last week?

01:48.560 --> 01:49.560
Yeah.

01:49.560 --> 01:50.560
Actually, just last week, man.

01:50.560 --> 01:51.560
Time is flying.

01:51.560 --> 01:52.560
Time is flying.

01:52.560 --> 01:53.560
Yeah, it was just last week.

01:53.560 --> 01:57.640
Well, we had that extra show, kind of, because we did the Game Awards thing here at VOG on

01:57.640 --> 01:58.640
Thursday night.

01:58.640 --> 02:03.220
But anyway, yeah, it was last week when you kind of shocked us.

02:03.220 --> 02:09.120
You and Aaron shocked us with the reveal that the game you have been talking about for months

02:09.120 --> 02:13.920
and months on the show that you've been working on is actually a version of Pixel Poops.

02:13.920 --> 02:19.740
It's Pixel Poops number two, appropriate, for the NES, or Nintendo Entertainment System.

02:19.740 --> 02:23.100
So great job on that twist reveal.

02:23.100 --> 02:24.860
That was great.

02:24.860 --> 02:26.340
And kudos.

02:26.340 --> 02:32.060
Bobby was the first guest in chat that potentially one reason you were being a little clammed

02:32.060 --> 02:34.960
up about it was that it was kind of someone else's sort of thing.

02:34.960 --> 02:40.460
He didn't guess exactly how it went, but close to coordinate.

02:40.460 --> 02:45.100
We did discuss that we're going to do some sort of direct thing, and it didn't push back,

02:45.100 --> 02:47.540
but we had to coordinate stuff.

02:47.540 --> 02:48.540
So that's why.

02:49.340 --> 02:54.140
Yeah, yeah, no, but you guys did a great job on that direct and really shocked us and the

02:54.140 --> 02:55.980
folks in chat.

02:55.980 --> 03:00.160
So now is the first week where I can officially ask you, how is development on Pixel Poops

03:00.160 --> 03:01.160
number two going?

03:01.160 --> 03:03.460
I haven't done a whole lot this week.

03:03.460 --> 03:05.260
It's mainly just been research.

03:05.260 --> 03:11.340
I've been trying to figure out how to do animated tiles because it's a lot of trickery involving

03:11.340 --> 03:15.980
switching memory banks and stuff on the fly in order to be, I have to reset up all my

03:16.220 --> 03:19.500
graphics if I want to do that or just rearrange my tiles.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.020
So that's what I've been researching this week for part of the week.

03:22.020 --> 03:26.220
And then Cyberpunk came out and nothing got done after that.

03:26.220 --> 03:29.840
So I'll probably go back to it again.

03:29.840 --> 03:31.780
It's mainly just been research this week.

03:31.780 --> 03:37.120
I've been going through the code that's in there for Nest Maker and their libraries that

03:37.120 --> 03:43.280
they have for doing care, the C.H.R. file loads to load the graphic data and just seeing

03:43.280 --> 03:45.520
how they refresh it and stuff.

03:46.520 --> 03:48.080
I know it's possible to do that.

03:48.080 --> 03:51.880
I just have to figure out how to do that and how I need to store my data in there.

03:52.240 --> 03:57.940
It's real complicated when you do Nest stuff, but I kind of give myself to like today to

03:57.940 --> 03:58.640
figure it out.

03:58.640 --> 04:01.720
And if I don't, I'm just going to move forward with it, but I have done other things.

04:01.720 --> 04:08.280
I've got like, so now I also have logic for the joggers to when they hit a solid wall,

04:08.280 --> 04:09.120
they will turn.

04:09.320 --> 04:14.280
So that's going to change some of the level design as well so that it can get a little

04:14.280 --> 04:16.840
bit more complicated with them moving in random directions.

04:16.840 --> 04:17.680
Fancy.

04:17.880 --> 04:23.800
So were you surprised at the amount of people that, you know, or do you even regret saying

04:23.800 --> 04:26.640
that you were thinking about doing some actual cartridge production?

04:26.840 --> 04:30.920
Because obviously you got a pretty warm response in our chat and then, you know, on

04:30.920 --> 04:34.080
your Facebook post, because you made a Facebook post after the show kind of telling

04:34.080 --> 04:35.280
all your friends what was going on.

04:35.480 --> 04:36.920
You got a lot of response there, too.

04:36.920 --> 04:43.520
So the limited run Loki Productions basement printing press is going to be running

04:43.520 --> 04:45.000
over time whenever you get this thing done.

04:45.640 --> 04:50.600
Well, I, you know, to do, yeah, definitely, um, one of the things I need to do is I need

04:50.600 --> 04:57.960
to get an actual, uh, any acid, uh, test on, so I need to get that just to test all the

04:57.960 --> 04:59.880
carts after I burn them.

04:59.920 --> 05:07.320
And then, um, I need to figure out label printing, which has actually been, cause I

05:07.320 --> 05:10.400
have, um, I'm in their forum as well.

05:10.400 --> 05:13.760
They have like a Facebook group and then they also have like their own forums.

05:14.160 --> 05:17.720
So there's people actually discussing label printing as well.

05:17.720 --> 05:22.000
I, I, a lot of them have been talking about just laminating, like any jet printed

05:22.000 --> 05:24.280
thing, but I'd rather just get it done.

05:24.360 --> 05:29.400
Uh, but I have to see how they're doing it and figure out the best way to do that.

05:29.680 --> 05:30.040
All right.

05:30.040 --> 05:33.640
Well, we pretty much it, we look for, we look forward to more updates on your

05:33.640 --> 05:36.960
project as it, um, you know, as it shits out.

05:36.960 --> 05:41.320
Um, yeah, yeah, there would have been more this week if cyberpunk didn't

05:41.320 --> 05:42.480
come out, but then it did.

05:42.680 --> 05:45.320
So, you know, this is why you didn't commit to a release date.

05:45.320 --> 05:47.480
So people need to just be patient this week.

05:47.520 --> 05:50.880
I I'll probably go back to it again, but like, I wanted to at least get a few days

05:50.880 --> 05:51.880
of that in, yeah.

05:52.360 --> 05:52.720
All right.

05:52.760 --> 05:55.200
Uh, also say hello, of course, joining us every week.

05:55.280 --> 05:57.680
Uh, say hello to dark Sakura or Jamie summers.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.840
I had to unmute myself.

06:01.360 --> 06:01.760
Hi.

06:01.760 --> 06:02.360
How are you?

06:03.400 --> 06:04.880
I am tired.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.360
Yeah, I hear ya.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.440
Uh, well, happy.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.480
I was just to say happy Hanukkah to you.

06:09.720 --> 06:13.480
Um, cause I know it's the fourth night and I gotta say, you know, with the whole

06:13.480 --> 06:17.640
pandemic and everything this year in 2020, just generally being a big ball of suck.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.760
I must say I am missing the OLR tradition.

06:20.960 --> 06:25.480
It's the one night where Jamie willingly gets in the kitchen and bakes

06:25.480 --> 06:28.120
latkes here for us on the show.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.360
And I missed that this year.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.080
I fried up some good latkes for us.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.840
Uh, last year I remember.

06:34.320 --> 06:35.640
Made a lot of latkes.

06:36.840 --> 06:37.280
You did.

06:37.280 --> 06:40.800
So, so I was going to say, if you're going to be a little shit, 10 years ago in an

06:40.800 --> 06:44.840
iTunes review and say, Jamie better be in the kitchen, it better be during Hanukkah.

06:44.840 --> 06:47.640
Cause that's the only time that comment is excusable here on this program.

06:48.120 --> 06:49.760
I have cooked other things though.

06:50.040 --> 06:50.880
You know, true.

06:50.880 --> 06:55.240
You have in, in, in the history of the show and, and Loki has too.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.400
I remember the deep fryer bonanza.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.240
We had one episode.

06:58.640 --> 07:02.200
The old deep fried rice balls with cornflake coating.

07:02.320 --> 07:05.680
The old OLR you guys was wild.

07:05.720 --> 07:11.160
Like, that's why I don't talk much about the pre podcast years of OLR, but we did

07:11.160 --> 07:14.080
wild shit for like three hours a night.

07:14.320 --> 07:17.280
And I remember there was that episode where we were deep frying things.

07:17.480 --> 07:21.240
And I also remember the episode where we had the, um, and this, we didn't even have

07:21.240 --> 07:24.960
a, well, I think we had the cam, but it was the camera that would update like once

07:24.960 --> 07:25.920
every 30 seconds.

07:25.920 --> 07:26.880
So you couldn't really see anything.

07:27.480 --> 07:30.000
But that was the technology on the internet way back in the day.

07:30.120 --> 07:34.160
But I remember the night we had the peep jousting live on air and we put the peeps

07:34.160 --> 07:37.520
with the toothpicks and in the microwave, which I wouldn't recommend doing.

07:37.520 --> 07:38.840
Cause it's disgusting.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.160
Cause I hate marshmallows.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.960
I know they do not like peeps.

07:42.000 --> 07:42.720
It's a little funny.

07:43.320 --> 07:49.560
The webcam that was, it was the eye toy run through a capture card.

07:49.560 --> 07:50.160
That's right.

07:50.160 --> 07:51.360
It was an eye toy.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.880
It updated every like few seconds.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.960
So, or it was like every 10, 15 seconds or whatever.

07:56.960 --> 07:58.400
Cause you know, dial up and.

07:58.840 --> 07:59.560
Or no, it wasn't dial up.

07:59.560 --> 08:02.320
No, it wasn't dial up, but it was, uh, you know, there was certainly

08:02.320 --> 08:06.000
nothing like Twitch or I don't even think YouTube had debuted just yet.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.680
It was, it would, this would have been, this would have been when you

08:08.680 --> 08:11.600
and I were roommates, low Loki, which was around, it wasn't the first year

08:11.600 --> 08:14.840
of the show, but it wasn't long after it was about 2003, 2004 was probably when

08:14.840 --> 08:18.040
those, yeah, it's like geo cities.

08:18.640 --> 08:25.600
It was like, yeah, it was really rough, but it's, it's, it's funny

08:25.600 --> 08:26.880
how we've come such a long way.

08:26.880 --> 08:27.960
Anyway, Jamie, sorry.

08:29.720 --> 08:35.680
Oh, we're talking about a lot cause in the chat, but, um, it's, uh, something

08:35.680 --> 08:41.160
that I talk about on, on my own, uh, forums, but I don't really talk about

08:41.160 --> 08:46.600
a whole lot on the show is a chronic fatigue syndrome and, um, it can

08:46.600 --> 08:48.000
really wipe a person out.

08:48.040 --> 08:52.360
And so I just wanted to reach out, basically just put a word out to

08:52.360 --> 08:56.120
others who, who are, uh, are living with this, you are not alone.

08:56.600 --> 09:00.480
Um, and it keeps us from playing copious amounts of DDR when we think

09:00.480 --> 09:01.760
about bringing out the dance pads.

09:02.840 --> 09:09.160
So, um, but, uh, I still have all my Bemani stuff up behind me and I, I'm

09:09.160 --> 09:11.800
actually considering selling my title.

09:12.680 --> 09:13.520
Oh, wow.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.360
Wants to make me a good offer.

09:15.640 --> 09:19.760
The beat mania stuff is going fucking nowhere because I want to figure out how

09:19.760 --> 09:25.280
to, uh, if I can get that sub service that's going on for beat mania, I think

09:25.280 --> 09:31.880
it would be cool, um, I kind of miss playing, um, I've lost like 80% of my

09:31.880 --> 09:37.080
skill at it, you know, like when I, when we like for, uh, California extreme,

09:37.080 --> 09:42.080
I just was pretty much playing, uh, uh, I beat mania three so that I could play

09:42.080 --> 09:45.360
like my favorite songs and just really easy.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.120
Um, but I don't know.

09:47.120 --> 09:52.040
Um, I've been, uh, going hubby and I have been talking over stuff about what we

09:52.120 --> 09:56.280
want to do about getting, um, like a music game room set back up in, in this

09:56.280 --> 10:01.440
office, but then again, I want to do my crafting stuff and actually learn how

10:01.440 --> 10:06.120
to use my sewing machine because, uh, I hand sewed, sewed all my shit in the

10:06.120 --> 10:09.680
back and you know, in, in the old days, now I want to start using my machine

10:09.680 --> 10:15.480
and, you know, get back into making my, uh, uh, costumes and stuff.

10:15.920 --> 10:18.120
Um, but, uh, okay.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.440
So I have to make a comment to the chat room right now, Rob.

10:21.120 --> 10:21.400
Okay.

10:21.440 --> 10:21.760
Please.

10:21.840 --> 10:27.240
So everyone's talking about making latkes and latkes are fucking

10:27.320 --> 10:28.360
easiest shit to make.

10:28.400 --> 10:28.800
Okay.

10:29.800 --> 10:36.480
You have recipes on the internet and they are really matzah meal, you know,

10:36.480 --> 10:40.840
which is basically, you know, dried up, grumbled up matzah, um, you know,

10:40.840 --> 10:45.400
and matzah is basically the, uh, the bulking fiber of the Jewish world.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.680
Um, potatoes, shredded potatoes.

10:49.760 --> 10:52.160
Make sure that you use a nice, good, firm potato.

10:52.160 --> 10:56.680
If you want them to be, you know, have that hash brownie kind of quality egg.

10:57.120 --> 11:03.200
It takes egg and salt and you can make latkes or you can go and buy a box of

11:03.200 --> 11:07.480
the meneshevitz mix and follow the directions and mix that and have latkes.

11:07.520 --> 11:10.640
I thought that the stuff you had, we did last year, just you followed

11:10.640 --> 11:11.840
the recipe on the back of the box.

11:12.520 --> 11:12.840
Yeah.

11:13.200 --> 11:16.280
I didn't feel like shredding all those damn potatoes, although I I've

11:16.280 --> 11:19.080
done it with blue potatoes before and they look really cool.

11:20.440 --> 11:20.720
Yeah.

11:20.840 --> 11:27.120
Um, but, uh, I'm planning on not tonight cause I'm so tired, but tomorrow

11:27.120 --> 11:31.360
night, maybe after work, I'm planning on doing sweet potato latkes.

11:31.840 --> 11:34.360
Oh, sweet potato.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.760
I'm meh on them, but Alan loves them.

11:37.280 --> 11:41.120
Well, tell him, tell Alan to go to the coaster section of the grocery store

11:41.480 --> 11:43.600
and get the box sweet potato latkes.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.120
Cause they're just about as good as doing the real thing.

11:47.200 --> 11:53.280
Um, and, um, I've also decided that neither sour cream or

11:53.280 --> 11:54.840
applesauce are superior.

11:54.920 --> 11:57.720
Neither of them are, you're making me hungry.

11:57.760 --> 11:58.200
All right.

11:58.800 --> 12:01.320
You know, what is superior to either of those toppings?

12:01.400 --> 12:01.760
Yes.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.480
What onion jam.

12:04.920 --> 12:05.360
All right.

12:05.600 --> 12:06.560
Sweet onion jam.

12:06.720 --> 12:07.160
All right.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.120
Sweet is specifically sweet onion jam.

12:10.600 --> 12:10.840
All right.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.520
We can find the Delia onion jam.

12:12.520 --> 12:13.200
You go for it.

12:13.560 --> 12:15.480
We got to get into gaming talk.

12:15.520 --> 12:16.640
Although these are, you know what?

12:16.680 --> 12:18.920
I'm all about snacks while you're a gaming.

12:18.920 --> 12:22.920
So, you know, Hey, uh, let's, uh, let's get into some video game news and what

12:22.920 --> 12:25.440
happened, um, around the gaming world this week.

12:25.520 --> 12:25.840
Yes.

12:26.040 --> 12:26.640
One last thing.

12:26.920 --> 12:27.280
All right.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.840
Curry sauce over latkes.

12:29.160 --> 12:30.040
Also delightful.

12:30.360 --> 12:31.240
I wouldn't have thought of that.

12:31.240 --> 12:31.840
That sounds good.

12:32.320 --> 12:33.600
Curry sauce is good.

12:34.080 --> 12:34.320
Okay.

12:34.360 --> 12:34.840
One last thing.

12:34.840 --> 12:37.560
I get this powdered Curry gravy stuff.

12:37.600 --> 12:42.000
Um, it's British like a B store, I think is the brand, but I order it on some

12:42.000 --> 12:46.800
online service or a touch of Britain down here has it, and that shit is the bomb on

12:46.840 --> 12:48.680
any potato product and that's it.

12:49.360 --> 12:52.400
You know, I'm sure this is already out there somewhere on YouTube, but you need

12:52.400 --> 12:54.560
a nerd cooking show, a geek cooking show.

12:54.560 --> 13:01.000
I'm sure that exists, but not nerdy mummies and all of those, but none with you.

13:01.760 --> 13:02.440
Oh, that's right.

13:02.920 --> 13:05.960
Tiara has a thing going on and her blog is live now.

13:05.960 --> 13:08.480
So Tiara, I know you're not listening right now, but I am

13:08.480 --> 13:09.600
plugging the crap out of you.

13:09.640 --> 13:12.320
Everyone needs to look at their, uh, their blog.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.160
It's, uh, there and bake again.

13:14.720 --> 13:17.280
I'll, I'll find a link for it in the chat room, but they're also

13:17.280 --> 13:20.480
on, uh, on, uh, the YouTubes and stuff.

13:20.640 --> 13:21.680
So, all right.

13:22.560 --> 13:22.880
All right.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.200
Uh, well, let's get in.

13:24.200 --> 13:27.560
Speaking of things to watch, a lot of folks this past Thursday, we're

13:27.560 --> 13:29.880
watching the game awards for this year.

13:30.120 --> 13:34.000
Um, knowing that, you know, previously in previous years, Jeff Keeley's big

13:34.040 --> 13:38.000
event that he's, you know, tried to make the, uh, gaming version of the Oscars.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.040
And he's certainly done a lot better job than, um, some of the early,

13:41.280 --> 13:44.240
uh, forays into that, that were on spike television and so forth.

13:44.480 --> 13:49.240
Um, but, uh, Jeff's really gotten a good balance there and, uh, he's

13:49.240 --> 13:54.240
kind of become to be known for kind of the, the winter big announcement thing.

13:54.240 --> 13:57.960
You know, we have E3 usually in the summer, obviously 2020 was weird this year.

13:58.240 --> 14:02.200
Um, but, uh, the game awards has been known as kind of like the big winter

14:02.200 --> 14:06.640
announcement, uh, event as long, uh, along with the numerous awards that they gave out.

14:07.040 --> 14:11.240
Um, and, uh, this year, obviously the pandemic made that a little

14:11.240 --> 14:13.240
weird, um, but they did the show.

14:13.480 --> 14:16.320
Uh, we were co-streaming it here at VOG network.

14:16.320 --> 14:18.280
So some of y'all were watching the show with us.

14:18.520 --> 14:21.800
Uh, myself, Loki and Bobby Black Wolf were there streaming the event.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.160
I know Dark Soccer had to work.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.640
Um, but, uh, we, we had a good time with it.

14:25.680 --> 14:28.320
Um, and, uh, got to react to some things together.

14:28.480 --> 14:32.800
Y'all saw me almost have a heart attack when that PlayStation five game came up

14:32.840 --> 14:37.560
that had the hallway trailer and I started flip flipping my shit.

14:37.560 --> 14:38.800
Cause I thought it might be PT.

14:39.560 --> 14:40.680
They got me good.

14:40.880 --> 14:41.760
Those bastards.

14:41.760 --> 14:42.360
They got me good.

14:42.360 --> 14:43.480
What, what was that game?

14:43.480 --> 14:45.800
It's a, it's a sci-fi and they've shown it before.

14:45.800 --> 14:49.160
It was at the PS five reveal, the sci-fi game with the female

14:49.160 --> 14:50.280
protagonist of blonde hair.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.440
I don't remember.

14:53.480 --> 14:54.720
Yeah, no, they got me.

14:54.880 --> 14:55.960
They got me good gal.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.200
This is returnal.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.040
That sounds right.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.360
Returnal that, that does sound right.

15:00.360 --> 15:03.400
Yeah, that was the, so dark soccer, if you'd seen this, you would have flipped

15:03.400 --> 15:08.640
out to the game, started out and it shows a hallway with a door and the narrator

15:08.640 --> 15:13.240
talks about like a loop and how I'm going back to where I started again.

15:13.440 --> 15:18.040
And that was my, my, like literal reaction was no, like they did not

15:18.120 --> 15:22.680
like that this can't like that fan wank cannot be real like the Twitter.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.480
Of course they did it on purpose.

15:25.520 --> 15:28.920
That's why I'm calling a little bitches anyway.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.280
So that was probably something fun.

15:30.280 --> 15:34.120
You got to see me react to, um, but anyway, uh, so it was a big event,

15:34.320 --> 15:40.000
nothing big this year, like the X-Box series X reveal, like we got last year,

15:40.000 --> 15:44.280
but all in all before Loki is going to run down the news, but quickly, um,

15:44.400 --> 15:46.840
Loki, what did you think of the show as a whole?

15:46.840 --> 15:47.880
Like, were you a fan?

15:47.880 --> 15:50.800
Were you like, where were you at with the show as a whole?

15:51.080 --> 15:51.800
And then we'll run it down.

15:52.240 --> 15:52.880
It was okay.

15:52.880 --> 15:58.320
But there wasn't really any trailers as like, you know, super excited about,

15:58.600 --> 16:02.120
like, I remember like previous years, we had like no man's sky.

16:02.280 --> 16:06.080
We had, you know, some death stranding gameplay type stuff.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.720
Um, you know, stuff like that.

16:08.720 --> 16:11.520
They were just like, kind of like, wow, you know, that's amazing.

16:11.840 --> 16:16.880
You know, I mean, I guess if I was a fan of certain series, maybe there would be

16:16.880 --> 16:20.800
some trailers that would be kind of like, Ooh, you know, nothing really like

16:20.920 --> 16:21.680
concrete.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.160
I mean, there's some stuff that looks neat.

16:23.160 --> 16:26.160
Some stuff that was just kind of, okay.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.600
That's a thing now, I guess.

16:27.640 --> 16:31.400
And, um, there's a few things that like some of the indie projects

16:31.400 --> 16:32.360
that look really nice.

16:32.440 --> 16:32.720
Yeah.

16:32.840 --> 16:36.760
Um, but nothing like, Oh my God, this is like the next game.

16:36.760 --> 16:37.960
I really am waiting for it.

16:37.960 --> 16:40.000
Like literally none of the games that they showed.

16:41.240 --> 16:43.880
I'm like highly anticipated for, but it's fine.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.520
There was a couple I was certainly interested in and we'll get to it when

16:46.520 --> 16:47.880
you, when you run down here in a minute.

16:47.880 --> 16:51.400
But, um, I will say as a whole, and I said this on the Thursday broadcast,

16:51.400 --> 16:53.480
let's kind of repeat it for the folks who missed it.

16:53.760 --> 16:57.960
I thought Jeff and company did the best job they could, um, considering the

16:57.960 --> 17:02.200
state of this year, considering the fact that the industry is all kind of crazy

17:02.200 --> 17:05.560
and, you know, things are getting delayed and pushback and, you know, a lot of

17:05.560 --> 17:08.040
things that were going to come out this holiday are now 2021.

17:08.280 --> 17:12.040
Um, I think they really did the best job they could in giving us

17:12.040 --> 17:13.200
something to look forward to.

17:13.440 --> 17:17.200
I think the only kind of disappointment was that one game

17:17.200 --> 17:18.800
really ran away with everything.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.840
And look, I, and this is not a knock.

17:20.880 --> 17:22.360
This is not a knock on last of us.

17:22.360 --> 17:23.000
Part two.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.760
I realize it's a controversial game in some circles.

17:25.760 --> 17:27.280
I ha I have not played it.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.080
Therefore I have no opinion.

17:29.120 --> 17:33.880
I, it just, you know, some of the thrill is gone a little bit when, and this is

17:33.880 --> 17:38.440
even true about the Oscars and that when like one thing really dominates, it's

17:38.440 --> 17:43.120
kind of like, Oh, this is really like, like no shit, it was going to win game.

17:43.800 --> 17:46.480
If you were paying attention the whole night, like it would have been a real

17:46.480 --> 17:47.920
shock if something else had won.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.880
Um, which, which has happened at the Oscars once or twice.

17:51.160 --> 17:55.000
Um, like, like that year that crash won best motion picture, right.

17:55.160 --> 17:57.480
When Brokeback Mountain who won like everything else, right.

17:57.680 --> 18:02.080
It happens once in a great while, but for the most part, the shocks like

18:02.080 --> 18:02.960
that are really rare.

18:02.960 --> 18:07.640
And once a game kind of starts to sweep or a movie or whatever, a Grammy thing,

18:07.920 --> 18:10.280
uh, it becomes pretty obvious what's going to happen.

18:10.600 --> 18:15.120
Um, so I did like though, you know, and I know there's been a lot of discourse

18:15.120 --> 18:20.320
online about some of the, like the crunch time and does that mean last

18:20.320 --> 18:22.280
of us two deserves best direction?

18:22.640 --> 18:24.680
I, again, haven't played the game.

18:24.720 --> 18:25.720
Don't have an opinion.

18:26.040 --> 18:29.800
I can say that that conversation, at least we're having that conversation.

18:30.040 --> 18:33.040
And I think we've been talking a long time about how the game industry needs

18:33.040 --> 18:37.320
to unionize and, um, there needs to probably be a greater conversation in

18:37.320 --> 18:41.320
that regard and maybe this kind of becomes a catalyst to continue that

18:41.320 --> 18:42.040
conversation.

18:42.280 --> 18:46.400
But one thing I will applaud the game awards for is that I did feel like,

18:46.440 --> 18:49.880
even though the last of us two really swept the awards and made that part

18:49.880 --> 18:54.080
of it not that exciting, I did still feel like there was equal time, so to

18:54.080 --> 18:57.040
speak, to hear from other award winners.

18:57.280 --> 19:01.920
Like we saw the last of us, uh, team two or three times, probably

19:01.920 --> 19:03.800
the developers twice.

19:03.840 --> 19:07.320
I think we saw a voice actress as well, and maybe one other person,

19:07.640 --> 19:09.200
but we saw the guy twice.

19:09.360 --> 19:13.720
Well, we saw the Among Us team twice and they were really pleasant to see

19:13.720 --> 19:17.120
because they were just, they were just four kids that were so fucking happy,

19:17.240 --> 19:19.640
you know, and that was a real delight to see.

19:19.880 --> 19:23.600
And again, that leads to a conversation on should Among Us even have been

19:23.600 --> 19:26.600
nominated for best mobile game when it came out in 2018?

19:28.400 --> 19:30.400
That's not for me to answer.

19:30.440 --> 19:33.320
Uh, it's, I guess it's up to the game awards and that feedback, but.

19:33.800 --> 19:38.840
You know, I will say it was, their speech was goddamn pleasant, you know,

19:38.840 --> 19:41.560
and I was happy for them and I didn't care when that game released.

19:41.560 --> 19:42.080
You know what I mean?

19:42.360 --> 19:47.400
So at least I felt like, even if there's this conversation about, uh, you

19:47.400 --> 19:51.160
know, Oh, last of us part two was, was toxic in some ways to our industry

19:51.160 --> 19:56.680
and so forth, um, I feel like there were lights shined on other things too,

19:56.880 --> 20:00.200
where it didn't like ruin, like I'm not sitting here going, Oh, the whole

20:00.200 --> 20:01.720
award show is tainted because of it.

20:01.880 --> 20:06.480
Because I think it is really awesome that Jeff has an award category to

20:06.480 --> 20:11.080
call out accessibility, which is something that last of us two really shined on.

20:11.080 --> 20:16.200
And that, that award is hard to fucking argue with that last of us two really

20:16.200 --> 20:18.640
went out of their way when it came to accessibility this year, although I

20:18.640 --> 20:22.320
thought I was not aware that some of the other games nominated like that grounded

20:22.320 --> 20:26.000
game, I didn't know they had a mode where if you're arachnophobic, you

20:26.000 --> 20:29.160
turn the spiders into floating disks.

20:29.240 --> 20:31.040
You basically remove the legs and the hair.

20:31.080 --> 20:31.440
Yeah.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.800
I thought I was like, Oh, that's kind of rad.

20:33.920 --> 20:34.600
I didn't know that.

20:34.960 --> 20:35.160
Yeah.

20:35.160 --> 20:36.920
We kind of covered that on the show a while ago.

20:36.960 --> 20:39.720
Um, but yeah, it was kind of, I thought it just removed them

20:39.720 --> 20:40.800
from the game altogether.

20:41.040 --> 20:46.800
I didn't realize it turned to like some, like, you know, uh, animation,

20:46.840 --> 20:51.040
like a stand-in type thing, like a blob.

20:51.360 --> 20:51.840
Yeah.

20:51.920 --> 20:53.880
I don't kind of look funny.

20:54.040 --> 20:54.320
Yeah.

20:54.640 --> 20:58.560
Um, so some folks in chat, so Bobby in chat says I wanted a Hades to win more.

20:58.560 --> 21:01.320
Um, you know, and I, I, I loved Hades.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.160
It's, it's probably my game of the year.

21:03.160 --> 21:04.520
Stay tuned to find out for sure.

21:04.800 --> 21:10.480
Um, but, uh, I, I, on one hand, I kind of get it, you know, if you look at

21:10.480 --> 21:15.240
Metacritic, um, not that I put a whole lot of stock in Metacritic, but what

21:15.240 --> 21:18.640
was the number one reviewed game on Metacritic that originally released

21:18.640 --> 21:23.200
this year, um, because persona five, uh, Royal edition is, is up there.

21:23.360 --> 21:28.400
But that is, you know, it's a repackaging, which, you know, who knows if that would

21:28.440 --> 21:32.040
have, it should have made it eligible or not, I don't know, but, uh, the next one

21:32.040 --> 21:33.840
up there is the last of us part two.

21:33.880 --> 21:34.960
So it's, it's not.

21:35.400 --> 21:40.160
Surprising, you know, and, uh, we, we know it's done by a panel of

21:40.160 --> 21:43.960
journalists that are very similar to the type of people you see on Metacritic.

21:44.160 --> 21:46.600
So you can kind of read the tea leaves a little bit there.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.960
The audience vote is only like 10% of it.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.560
It's not enough to really sway it hard in one direction or another.

21:52.840 --> 21:55.840
And of course, lots of people talking about animal crossing, you know, which

21:56.080 --> 22:00.080
obviously I don't have to wait two weeks to know that that's dark soccer is game

22:00.080 --> 22:04.640
of the year and plenty of other people's as well, just because of, you know, what

22:04.680 --> 22:09.200
it brought our 2020 world, you know, and the, and all this stuff.

22:09.400 --> 22:09.880
So.

22:10.280 --> 22:14.480
I will say at least one kind of nice thing was that even while the last of

22:14.480 --> 22:18.200
us to kind of swept the table, it did feel like everything else that was

22:18.200 --> 22:22.200
nominated for game of the war game of the year won something like no one

22:22.200 --> 22:23.360
really went home empty handed.

22:23.400 --> 22:27.600
I don't think like, um, the final fantasy seven remake got best music, right?

22:27.800 --> 22:30.880
Hades got best action game, which was actually really surprising.

22:31.120 --> 22:32.880
Animal crossing got best family game.

22:33.160 --> 22:34.960
Um, I'm missing one of them.

22:35.240 --> 22:39.120
Um, I'm a ghost of Sushi mug won something.

22:39.480 --> 22:41.640
I don't remember what it was, but they won something as well.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.400
So sound design, I think.

22:44.440 --> 22:44.800
Yeah.

22:44.840 --> 22:46.840
So actually do maternal may have been screwed.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.320
I don't think they won anything.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.960
Um, but I, they won a lot of hearts.

22:50.960 --> 22:54.240
Uh, literally they tore lots of hearts out of demons chests and

22:54.240 --> 22:55.440
that's what you do in do maternal.

22:55.440 --> 22:55.600
No.

22:55.640 --> 23:00.840
Uh, but it did seem like there were like, there was a little bit of, uh, Oprah,

23:00.840 --> 23:03.840
you know, you get an award and you get an award, so, you know, I don't know.

23:03.960 --> 23:04.280
Anyway.

23:04.520 --> 23:04.800
All right.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.560
Let's, let's talk about some of the big announcements.

23:06.560 --> 23:06.880
I'm sorry.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.440
I went on a little tangent there, but it's, it's a lot of the things that

23:09.600 --> 23:10.880
gamers are talking about this week.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.880
So, but Loki, what were some of the big reveals?

23:13.680 --> 23:19.760
Um, so we saw a gameplay trailer for back for blood, which is the new

23:19.920 --> 23:24.160
Turok game, the folks behind left for dead, it's basically left for

23:24.160 --> 23:26.400
dead without calling it left for dead.

23:26.640 --> 23:31.560
So I was, I know when I saw it, I was like, did Val finally make a game

23:31.560 --> 23:35.800
with three forgetting that the studio, I forgot that whole thing, even though

23:35.800 --> 23:37.960
we talked about it on this show, but we talk about a lot on this show.

23:37.960 --> 23:41.160
So, uh, that way it was, it was nice to see that night.

23:41.160 --> 23:42.680
I know that game will have its fans for sure.

23:43.480 --> 23:50.080
Yeah, there was the, um, dragon combat game, century age of ashes.

23:50.120 --> 23:50.920
They look kind of cool.

23:50.960 --> 23:52.120
A little bit Panzer drag.

23:52.120 --> 23:57.000
I was getting a heavy Panzer dragoon vibe and I was like, Oh, I didn't

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
think it reminds me a lot of layer though.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.880
I mean, layer is more like kind of like that, but we'll see.

24:01.880 --> 24:02.320
I don't know.

24:02.440 --> 24:04.160
It looked neat from the trailer.

24:05.000 --> 24:05.480
Yeah.

24:05.880 --> 24:11.160
Uh, there was the game season, which was that kind of, uh, foot.

24:11.440 --> 24:14.400
It looked like almost like photographing nature or something

24:14.400 --> 24:15.400
like that, that really style.

24:15.400 --> 24:15.880
Oh yeah.

24:15.880 --> 24:17.080
It was very stylized.

24:17.080 --> 24:17.560
Very good looking.

24:17.560 --> 24:17.800
Yeah.

24:18.000 --> 24:18.320
Yeah.

24:18.320 --> 24:19.200
So that was cool.

24:19.560 --> 24:25.200
Um, there's a, that was at road 96, that game about hitchhiking.

24:25.200 --> 24:28.040
It looks like, so that was interesting.

24:28.080 --> 24:30.200
Um, a lot of road trip games this year.

24:30.440 --> 24:30.920
Yes.

24:30.920 --> 24:35.280
Uh, speaking of that, there was also open roads, which was a mother

24:35.280 --> 24:38.480
daughter searching for the truth about their deceased grandmother.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.680
Um, so that's kind of it.

24:40.720 --> 24:45.200
Actually, it looks like, so I believe I need a Wiki expert is dark Tetsuya

24:45.200 --> 24:49.960
standing by, didn't we have a dream game called grandma's got a gun or something

24:49.960 --> 24:52.720
like that, that was like one of the older, no, no, no, no, no, no.

24:52.720 --> 24:58.760
So that one was basically a four player, like shooter game that was starring.

24:58.840 --> 25:01.400
I know, but golden girls, but okay.

25:01.400 --> 25:02.040
Yes, that was it.

25:02.040 --> 25:02.480
But okay.

25:02.600 --> 25:06.240
But I still, still, when I saw this trailer, I was like, Oh, they're using

25:06.240 --> 25:08.240
gangster granny as a plot device.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.400
I'm in it and it's by the gone home people.

25:10.400 --> 25:15.760
I'm into this, that look, I, you have my attention.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.280
That was my reaction to that trailer.

25:17.280 --> 25:19.840
You have my attention and some big, Oh, there was some big Hollywood

25:19.840 --> 25:20.640
names in that, right?

25:20.640 --> 25:23.120
Carrie Russell, I think was in that, uh, Felicity.

25:23.120 --> 25:23.440
Yeah.

25:23.680 --> 25:27.080
So it's interesting because, um, you know, there was certainly a big period

25:27.080 --> 25:31.240
of time where Hollywood wasn't making anything because of everything going on.

25:31.400 --> 25:35.960
So I'm sure you had a lot of celebrities that suddenly became, uh, available

25:35.960 --> 25:38.280
for voice acting talent as well.

25:38.360 --> 25:41.840
Not to detract from the many voice actors that we, we love in the gaming

25:41.840 --> 25:44.360
industry, but, uh, there's tons of projects to go around.

25:44.360 --> 25:44.880
That's for sure.

25:44.880 --> 25:49.400
So it's interesting to see some, some big, um, uh, TV and film talent

25:49.400 --> 25:50.520
coming into voice, some games.

25:51.200 --> 25:56.760
And speaking of, uh, talent, uh, we had a, a trailer starring Vin diesel,

25:56.760 --> 25:59.720
which I swear to God that that was going to be another Riddick game,

25:59.720 --> 26:01.480
but it ended up being arc too.

26:01.960 --> 26:05.160
And it's just totally, I was getting to her.

26:05.200 --> 26:07.000
I was like, is it a horizon spinoff?

26:07.040 --> 26:09.920
Like what, because that, that was the big vibe I was getting, but then

26:09.920 --> 26:13.040
when they said it was arc, I was like, oh yeah, like I've played only a

26:13.040 --> 26:13.840
little bit of arc.

26:13.880 --> 26:17.200
I, I find that it doesn't hold your hand very well in the beginning of the game.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.480
I had a hard time following it.

26:18.800 --> 26:22.040
Um, but, uh, I have friends that are really into it.

26:22.040 --> 26:25.880
So, um, and I know the game's doing very well, so it made sense.

26:25.880 --> 26:28.360
Once I heard it was arc, I was like, oh, okay.

26:28.400 --> 26:32.000
I guess it could be that, although none of this is gameplay.

26:33.120 --> 26:33.400
No.

26:34.280 --> 26:34.560
Yeah.

26:35.400 --> 26:39.920
Um, and then they had, uh, another trailer for a cult, the Calisto

26:39.920 --> 26:44.840
project, which is by the folks that did dead space and it looks very dead space.

26:44.840 --> 26:52.320
So, um, violent, nasty, uh, then we've got, uh, a trailer that we had no idea

26:52.320 --> 26:54.320
what it was until the very end.

26:54.360 --> 26:57.600
And it was revealed to be perfect dark.

26:57.680 --> 26:58.960
So they have, oh yeah.

26:58.960 --> 26:59.520
Yeah.

27:00.080 --> 27:03.120
By the initiative, you know, and that rumor has been out for some time.

27:03.160 --> 27:04.880
So it was kind of nice to see that confirmed.

27:05.720 --> 27:06.120
Yeah.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.240
So that was interesting.

27:07.280 --> 27:11.080
Um, predictably master chief coming to Fortnite, they made that announcement.

27:11.600 --> 27:15.920
Um, and then kind of some of the other bigger stuff that they had,

27:15.960 --> 27:17.680
uh, well, the evil dead game.

27:17.880 --> 27:20.120
That's kind of cool, which I totally thought was a dead by

27:20.120 --> 27:22.000
daylight expansion or something.

27:22.440 --> 27:23.920
Yeah, I thought it was as well.

27:23.920 --> 27:26.240
And it's like, oh, that's not a diss.

27:26.280 --> 27:29.920
Uh, that's when Alan's favorite games and I know tons of people are into it, but,

27:30.160 --> 27:33.040
uh, yeah, it looks like, it looks like they're kind of taken maybe that, well,

27:33.040 --> 27:35.920
I shouldn't say taking, cause we don't know how the game plays yet, but that,

27:35.920 --> 27:38.320
uh, aesthetic, I guess for an evil dead game.

27:39.000 --> 27:39.320
Yep.

27:39.400 --> 27:44.360
Um, they had another trailer for fist, which was, uh, it looks like an action

27:44.360 --> 27:50.400
game, starring a robot with a robotic fist, they fights with, um, they have

27:50.400 --> 27:55.840
the new expansion tees for, uh, the yellow scrolls on line, which is gates of

27:55.840 --> 28:01.520
oblivion, and then we've also got, uh, they made, they talk about the season

28:01.520 --> 28:02.800
three of fall guys.

28:02.800 --> 28:05.960
So it's going to be winter theme comes out on the 15th.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.680
So later this week, yeah, a couple of days.

28:08.600 --> 28:10.840
And then of course we talked about returnal.

28:10.840 --> 28:16.080
That was very much like the, uh, you know, it almost looked way PT, but it wasn't.

28:16.600 --> 28:20.120
Um, and then of course, uh, some of the bigger stuff.

28:20.120 --> 28:23.200
So of course we knew that they were going to announce a new smash character.

28:23.480 --> 28:27.400
So Sephiroth was announced as the new smash character and

28:27.400 --> 28:29.320
immediately stabbed Mario.

28:30.080 --> 28:36.880
So that was so dark, but I love that the stat stabbing Mario, but it turned out

28:36.880 --> 28:40.160
once the light kind of went the other way, you saw that the sword was going

28:40.160 --> 28:43.680
through the suspenders kind of like hooking him on it was very, it was very

28:43.680 --> 28:47.960
like, like Disney dark humor was, it was, it was good.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.800
What do you think of Sephiroth as a character being added?

28:50.880 --> 28:52.720
I didn't, that was not one.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.960
I saw a lot of people predicting that kind of came out of left

28:54.960 --> 28:56.240
field, but it works.

28:56.280 --> 28:56.800
It works.

28:57.640 --> 28:58.600
It's fine.

28:58.600 --> 29:01.960
It could have, I don't know, they could have picked a different series.

29:02.160 --> 29:02.600
I'm sorry.

29:02.600 --> 29:03.400
I'm just so happy.

29:03.400 --> 29:04.440
It wasn't a Fortnite, bro.

29:04.480 --> 29:05.120
I'm sorry.

29:05.160 --> 29:06.720
I'm sorry, but I'm not sorry.

29:06.760 --> 29:08.760
I just, this is kind of one of those.

29:08.760 --> 29:11.960
Like I just, I feel like it's gonna happen.

29:12.080 --> 29:14.080
I don't want to see it happen, but yeah.

29:15.240 --> 29:16.800
Uh, was it, they, they showed off.

29:16.800 --> 29:18.520
Is it okay if I rolled my eyes the entire time?

29:18.880 --> 29:20.040
What, the Sephiroth bit?

29:20.640 --> 29:21.080
Yeah.

29:21.160 --> 29:25.680
I mean, my favorite thing though, was the person who did comparison shots for scenes

29:25.680 --> 29:27.720
from Advent Children and the games.

29:28.840 --> 29:30.240
That actually was really cool.

29:30.240 --> 29:32.200
I mean, they recreated a lot of it and then Dan and I went and

29:32.200 --> 29:33.080
watched Advent Children.

29:33.360 --> 29:37.480
They did, there was one thing they recreated a shot where like he was about

29:37.480 --> 29:42.120
to kill Aerith, but, uh, they use Zelda or something in the shot instead.

29:42.120 --> 29:45.240
And the trailer, it was pretty, pretty, pretty cool how they did that.

29:45.320 --> 29:47.800
It's like, damn, he's thinning out the cast already.

29:48.080 --> 29:53.360
Um, was it, they had the new, uh, airship level showed off for among us and they

29:53.360 --> 29:56.080
kind of showed the new tasks and gameplay with that, so that was kind of cool.

29:56.560 --> 29:58.280
Uh, that'll be coming next year.

29:58.360 --> 30:01.200
Uh, Super Meat Boy Forever, completely forgot about that game.

30:01.240 --> 30:02.080
Yeah.

30:02.440 --> 30:05.640
I thought that was supposed to be out a long time ago, but it

30:05.640 --> 30:07.080
might've been 2020.

30:08.320 --> 30:11.920
Uh, apparently, uh, games pass is going to be getting all of the Yakuza.

30:11.960 --> 30:17.000
So, uh, Yakuza remastered collection three, four and five, and then Yakuza

30:17.000 --> 30:19.240
six is going to be coming as well.

30:19.280 --> 30:25.080
That's all next year, January 28th for the first three and March 25th for number

30:25.080 --> 30:29.880
six, because we're still waiting for some of the final fantasy games they

30:29.880 --> 30:35.400
announced last year, just saying, uh, Evil West, which, um, looked like a

30:35.400 --> 30:39.760
very familiar PlayStation two game that I don't remember what it was called.

30:39.920 --> 30:43.440
Not dark centers, but, um, yeah, they're very similar looking games.

30:43.440 --> 30:46.520
So it's kind of a Western horror game, steampunk Western horror.

30:46.520 --> 30:47.880
So that, that looked kind of neat.

30:48.280 --> 30:52.280
Um, they've got unreal tournament stuff coming into Warframe.

30:52.280 --> 30:54.400
So some different weapons and stuff for that.

30:54.800 --> 30:59.320
And finally, um, there was a course, some teases from Bioware.

30:59.320 --> 31:04.920
So they showed off a teaser trailer for dark or a dragon age four.

31:05.320 --> 31:07.120
Uh, so a cinematic for that.

31:07.480 --> 31:07.960
All right.

31:07.960 --> 31:09.440
Uh, with a solace,

31:09.600 --> 31:11.920
uh, you know, we got to talk about that dark soccer.

31:11.920 --> 31:13.480
You're the Bioware fangirl.

31:13.720 --> 31:14.840
What'd you think of the trailer?

31:16.080 --> 31:16.440
All right.

31:16.480 --> 31:18.080
I mean, it's pretty much what I expected it to be.

31:18.080 --> 31:21.280
It didn't seem like anything too super new.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.080
I mean, from the other stuff that they showed us.

31:23.840 --> 31:28.240
Um, I didn't really expect anything more than just a couple of teases and everyone

31:28.240 --> 31:31.920
who beat dragon Asian acquisition knew that solace was the bad guy.

31:31.920 --> 31:36.360
So, yeah, I wasn't really super impressed.

31:36.800 --> 31:39.800
I was happy to see something, but I've still got a while to go.

31:39.960 --> 31:43.960
I liked the art style a lot now, I guess maybe because I haven't really been

31:43.960 --> 31:46.960
digging up on, I didn't know that that was the direction they were going with it.

31:47.160 --> 31:50.560
But I really liked that kind of like neon medieval look.

31:50.600 --> 31:54.280
It's, it's, it's for, it seems like a different direction for me, like than the

31:54.280 --> 31:58.520
other games, the way that kind of looked, I was maybe it's just because of my love.

31:58.520 --> 32:01.400
It has to do with the setting of the game.

32:01.400 --> 32:04.880
Cause I think it's supposed to be sent, set into vendor, which is like the wizard

32:05.280 --> 32:05.880
big thing.

32:06.440 --> 32:14.480
So, um, so, um, yeah, I, I think that has more to do with where it's located, but I

32:14.480 --> 32:19.960
really do like the stylistic choices, but it also does fit the, the area.

32:20.280 --> 32:20.800
Okay.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.000
So I, I look forward to when we can see some gameplay.

32:25.120 --> 32:25.600
Yeah.

32:26.440 --> 32:31.240
Um, and then last but not least, of course, uh, there was a teaser trailer

32:31.240 --> 32:36.120
for a new Mass Effect game that's going to be, I guess, set after three.

32:36.320 --> 32:41.520
And that was very surprising considering they only really confirmed that they were

32:41.520 --> 32:45.200
working on a new Mass Effect beyond the remaster, but when they announced the

32:45.200 --> 32:47.040
remaster really not that long ago.

32:47.400 --> 32:51.680
Um, and you know, you saw me kind of reacting live to that trailer where I was

32:51.680 --> 32:52.640
like, is that Liara?

32:52.680 --> 32:53.400
Is that Liara?

32:53.440 --> 32:55.400
And it turns out, yes, it was Liara.

32:56.360 --> 32:59.880
And that's one of the characters, if you're not aware from the original trilogy.

32:59.880 --> 33:07.520
So to me, that trailer seemed to be confirming that this new game is in the

33:07.880 --> 33:13.760
same universe, literally, because not as well, there's so much to dive into here,

33:13.760 --> 33:19.040
but it is some sort of continuation, I suppose, or perhaps, um, it could be

33:19.040 --> 33:24.040
prequel could be interlude, but it exists in the shepherd timeline is my point that

33:24.040 --> 33:29.080
it's somewhere it seems to be in there somewhere, although there's been a lot of

33:29.320 --> 33:31.560
lot of people tearing that trailer apart.

33:31.720 --> 33:36.560
Some people seem to think that Liara looks very aged and that it could be some

33:36.560 --> 33:41.080
sort of Liara trying to meet up with the Andromeda storyline, because keep in mind

33:41.120 --> 33:45.240
the Andromeda storyline is 600 years ahead of the ship because of the time it takes

33:45.240 --> 33:49.440
to travel between, uh, the Milky Way and Andromeda.

33:49.640 --> 33:54.040
But, you know, they, they may try to patch that up with, but time travel, but

33:54.040 --> 33:54.720
science.

33:54.760 --> 33:55.480
So we'll see.

33:55.480 --> 34:01.080
And, um, Liara's race, the Asari, they live for like a thousand years, so she could

34:01.080 --> 34:02.920
still be alive over six.

34:02.960 --> 34:03.520
Yeah, over.

34:03.600 --> 34:06.600
So she could still be alive is my point 600 years later.

34:06.760 --> 34:11.480
So there is, so there's a lot of theorizing over that 30 seconds that we saw.

34:11.680 --> 34:15.960
Um, so I don't, I don't want to go too far down that rabbit hole, but it certainly

34:15.960 --> 34:20.880
was exciting to at least know that, okay, this is going to tie into the characters

34:20.880 --> 34:26.640
in the first game, unlike Andromeda, which, you know, there's, there's things I like

34:26.640 --> 34:30.080
about Andromeda, there's things I don't like about Andromeda, but it exists on its

34:30.080 --> 34:30.400
own.

34:30.440 --> 34:34.640
You know, it doesn't it like the shepherd and the callbacks to the original trilogy

34:34.640 --> 34:40.360
are really just like cameos, but this is really something that shows, okay, y'all

34:40.360 --> 34:44.080
wanted something in the trilogy, you know, so, and then of course it leads to the

34:44.080 --> 34:48.040
controversy of, are they going to canonize one of the endings of three?

34:48.440 --> 34:52.520
I don't think it's a big deal if they do, but other people are really, really

34:52.520 --> 34:55.960
passionate on this topic and disagree that they shouldn't be canonizing one of the

34:55.960 --> 34:57.960
endings, but we'll see, they might find a way around it.

34:57.960 --> 35:05.520
Um, uh, Lyla36 in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network says, love

35:05.520 --> 35:07.480
Mass Effect, hopefully it's good.

35:07.680 --> 35:09.000
Uh, yeah, big same.

35:09.000 --> 35:13.760
And my assumption is that, you know, part of the surprise about seeing that teaser

35:13.760 --> 35:18.640
at the Game Awards was I was like, they still haven't given us a date for Dragon

35:18.640 --> 35:18.840
Age.

35:18.840 --> 35:22.120
Like this Mass Effect game is years out.

35:22.200 --> 35:28.200
I'm talking, I would be shocked if this game is out any earlier than 2023.

35:28.480 --> 35:29.240
I'm serious.

35:29.240 --> 35:30.520
I think it's that far out.

35:30.520 --> 35:34.160
It's gotta be, you know, think about how long Andromeda took and all the

35:34.160 --> 35:36.000
announces we got over the years with that.

35:36.360 --> 35:39.040
We may get a few more teases in that remaster.

35:39.040 --> 35:42.280
I think that's what people want to know now is that like, if I go and I beat all

35:42.280 --> 35:45.920
three games in that remaster, am I going to get like a Kingdom Hearts esque kind of

35:45.920 --> 35:48.360
bonus scene that's going to tie into something new?

35:48.680 --> 35:50.600
And I think a lot of people would lose their shit.

35:50.920 --> 35:54.920
Um, but we'll see a lot to be determined.

35:54.960 --> 35:55.760
That's for sure.

35:56.400 --> 36:03.040
So, um, Phoenix 7726 in chat says, wait, Rob, why would they shoot an ending out

36:03.040 --> 36:03.720
of a cannon?

36:04.080 --> 36:05.440
I would hope you all know what I meant.

36:05.520 --> 36:09.080
Um, but that means that obviously you make a big choice at the end of Mass Effect

36:09.080 --> 36:12.080
three on how do you want this story to end?

36:12.360 --> 36:16.600
And, uh, they may end up saying this is the definitive ending.

36:16.840 --> 36:22.920
Now, I would kind of argue that Mass Effect two, you could beat Mass Effect

36:22.920 --> 36:28.920
two and kill Shepard spoiler alert for a 10 year old game plus 10 plus, but you

36:28.920 --> 36:32.480
could beat Mass Effect two and end up not having Shepard live.

36:32.880 --> 36:37.480
And, uh, uh, in that ending, I believe Joker takes over the narration and some

36:37.480 --> 36:40.160
of the, um, follow up and tying up the loose ends.

36:40.400 --> 36:46.280
So in your, uh, Canon ending of Mass Effect two, Joker might've been the last

36:46.280 --> 36:51.000
person standing, but that didn't stop them from saying, nah, but that's like,

36:51.000 --> 36:55.640
it's, um, the endings of clue, but how about this?

36:55.680 --> 36:57.560
That's, that's one way it could have happened.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.880
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

37:00.120 --> 37:04.440
That's exactly how they should start Mass Effect three or sorry, Mass Effect, the

37:04.440 --> 37:07.960
new one, they should start Mass Effect, the new one by recapping the three

37:07.960 --> 37:10.080
endings, uh, clue the movie style.

37:10.360 --> 37:11.160
Absolutely.

37:12.480 --> 37:12.920
All right.

37:13.160 --> 37:13.560
Anyway.

37:13.600 --> 37:16.240
Um, anything else that they announced Loki that we missed?

37:17.400 --> 37:19.240
No, that'd be, that's pretty much it.

37:19.280 --> 37:23.880
Uh, there are some other advertisements, uh, Facebook did a lot of this, like kind

37:23.880 --> 37:28.440
of trying to build Goodwill around, you know, diverse streamers and stuff, but

37:28.440 --> 37:31.200
then like the kind of the reaction with all those, it's like, yeah, that's a

37:31.200 --> 37:31.880
really good video.

37:31.960 --> 37:32.760
Oh, Facebook.

37:33.560 --> 37:33.720
Yeah.

37:33.720 --> 37:37.840
So yeah, that's the only downside of that.

37:37.840 --> 37:42.200
It's like, yeah, thanks that you pointed it out, but nah, not going on your

37:42.200 --> 37:42.720
platform yet.

37:42.760 --> 37:46.520
That was, that was, you know what, it's one of those things where it's like, I

37:46.520 --> 37:51.160
will give a, I will give a singular clap to Facebook gaming.

37:51.160 --> 37:56.040
I will get, I will give one clap to Facebook gaming because I thought that

37:56.040 --> 37:59.400
was very nice that they spent their money on what they did with those ads.

37:59.440 --> 38:02.120
Because, you know, when they started, I was like, oh, I love when the game

38:02.120 --> 38:03.400
awards highlight stuff like this.

38:03.400 --> 38:04.440
This is really cool.

38:04.440 --> 38:07.720
And it's, it's great to see, you know, uh, all sorts of people that are really

38:07.720 --> 38:08.920
enthusiastic about gaming.

38:09.120 --> 38:13.440
And then it comes up with that Facebook gaming logo and you're like, I feel like

38:13.440 --> 38:15.600
I just got just bait and switched.

38:17.040 --> 38:21.320
Um, but I will give them the one clap, uh, polite applause for, for paying for

38:21.320 --> 38:21.840
those spots.

38:21.840 --> 38:22.800
Cause it was nice to see.

38:23.680 --> 38:25.360
So, all right.

38:25.880 --> 38:31.160
Um, otherwise those paid spots sure blend in with the awards a little too well.

38:31.160 --> 38:31.680
Don't they?

38:32.960 --> 38:33.400
Yes.

38:33.600 --> 38:36.560
I liked how, uh, Devolver used theirs.

38:36.560 --> 38:39.600
That was funny to do their own award show within the award show.

38:39.640 --> 38:40.280
That was funny.

38:40.280 --> 38:40.520
Yeah.

38:40.520 --> 38:41.840
That was a very Devolver thing.

38:41.840 --> 38:42.120
Yeah.

38:42.760 --> 38:43.240
All right.

38:43.520 --> 38:46.520
Let's talk about some other things we've done this week besides watching big award

38:46.520 --> 38:48.760
shows and talking about our gaming weeks.

38:48.760 --> 38:49.960
How was your gaming week?

38:49.960 --> 38:50.960
And we'll start with dark Sakura.

38:53.800 --> 38:55.360
It would help if I had muted myself.

38:55.400 --> 38:58.440
Um, it was, it was animal crossing.

38:58.480 --> 39:01.000
I mean, animal crossing and writing fan fiction.

39:01.640 --> 39:02.040
Fun.

39:02.120 --> 39:03.520
So, yeah.

39:03.520 --> 39:10.600
Um, I, in two weeks I have penned 19 chapters of my fanfic.

39:10.640 --> 39:11.160
Oh, wow.

39:11.760 --> 39:14.280
I'm on my 20th, 18 of them have been posted.

39:14.600 --> 39:19.880
So it's supernatural, but if anyone wants to read my writing, um, it is, I'm

39:19.880 --> 39:23.680
actually doing this in part, um, to deal with, I guess kind of how I feel about

39:23.680 --> 39:28.600
the series, but I'm also hashing out some ideas that are going to go into my novel.

39:29.560 --> 39:35.200
So if anyone wants a, a sort of a influential sneak peek on that, let me

39:35.200 --> 39:36.360
know, I will give you a link.

39:37.160 --> 39:37.480
Cool.

39:37.760 --> 39:41.080
But other than that, yeah, it's been lots of, uh, lots of animal crossing

39:41.160 --> 39:45.720
and, uh, um, and, and a little bit of pinball, a little bit of pinball.

39:45.960 --> 39:46.360
Oh, fun.

39:47.520 --> 39:50.280
And I'm still considering getting a ring fit.

39:50.720 --> 39:52.160
I'm thinking about it.

39:52.160 --> 39:56.840
I just don't know if I want to dedicate to it when I've been focusing so much on

39:56.880 --> 39:59.760
weight training instead of the cardio stuff.

39:59.760 --> 40:00.720
So we'll see.

40:01.040 --> 40:04.560
I need to come ding dong ditch you, um, the things so you can try it.

40:04.560 --> 40:07.520
Although there is a part of me that really should pick it back up because

40:07.520 --> 40:10.360
I haven't been getting great exercise throughout this whole thing.

40:10.360 --> 40:14.920
But, um, you know, been trying to, well, yeah, yeah, I've been trying my best to

40:14.920 --> 40:17.800
walking, although there was a few days this week where it didn't happen just due

40:17.800 --> 40:22.640
to it was raining or, you know, too much going, like I had to work and then we

40:22.640 --> 40:24.840
went right into the game awards from work.

40:24.880 --> 40:27.320
And by the time that's over, it's like seven, eight o'clock at

40:27.320 --> 40:28.560
night is too dark to go walk.

40:28.560 --> 40:31.440
And that's the biggest bummer is that it gets dark too damn early now.

40:31.720 --> 40:32.680
It really kind of.

40:33.480 --> 40:36.640
Sucks on the walking front, but Oh, well, you ever considered

40:36.640 --> 40:37.680
doing what Alan's doing?

40:38.840 --> 40:40.600
Um, yes, I considered it.

40:40.600 --> 40:44.800
And then I said, no, uh, when, when Jim, I said I wasn't going to do

40:44.800 --> 40:46.000
it because of my back problems.

40:46.360 --> 40:50.320
When gyms are safe again, I will absolutely cause my work has a nice

40:50.320 --> 40:51.040
little deal with you.

40:51.040 --> 40:53.320
I will absolutely be taking advantage of that.

40:53.320 --> 40:56.160
So that, but that's just going to have to be a 2021 thing.

40:56.160 --> 40:59.200
And as we all know, we, we got to wait for that vaccine to travel.

40:59.200 --> 41:04.000
So my work has a gym, but I've been buying weight equipment to keep it home.

41:04.320 --> 41:07.800
You know, I'm actually borrowing some pretty heavy, uh, free, uh, dumbbells

41:08.240 --> 41:10.800
and I bought a kettlebell and RAR.

41:11.480 --> 41:11.920
Nice.

41:12.600 --> 41:16.080
I was being really good about the gym about, you know, it was last year, but

41:16.080 --> 41:19.600
then everything just started happening where I changed jobs and like everything

41:19.600 --> 41:22.040
happened at once, I kind of fell out of the habit and I needed to get back into it.

41:22.080 --> 41:22.400
Anyway.

41:22.480 --> 41:22.720
All right.

41:23.040 --> 41:24.360
Get you some resistance bands.

41:24.400 --> 41:24.640
Yeah.

41:24.680 --> 41:26.640
Well, that's what ring fit basically is really.

41:26.640 --> 41:27.760
So, all right.

41:27.760 --> 41:28.920
Kind of anyway.

41:28.960 --> 41:30.520
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

41:30.840 --> 41:35.120
I mean, well, obviously you kind of got into it earlier, but I want to know about

41:35.120 --> 41:37.920
cyberpunk cause I'm, I'm pretty sure dark soccer didn't check it out and I didn't

41:37.920 --> 41:38.400
check it out.

41:38.400 --> 41:39.880
So I got to know your thoughts.

41:40.840 --> 41:46.640
So, yeah, I played, uh, quite a bit of cyberpunk now, so, um, I like it.

41:46.640 --> 41:47.560
I really enjoyed it.

41:47.560 --> 41:49.200
It's a very immersive game.

41:49.240 --> 41:53.880
Um, and I'm, yeah, I'm thoroughly enjoying it.

41:53.880 --> 41:57.840
The storyline's really good and I'm just kind of working through that.

41:57.960 --> 42:02.120
Been trying to do a lot of side quests, but it has like the, the problem that

42:02.120 --> 42:09.000
like, um, Skyrim had where as you are, like you pick a side quest to do it and

42:09.000 --> 42:13.080
you'll get another quest kind of in the middle and then it'll jump to that one.

42:13.080 --> 42:15.920
It'll get, it kept changing my markers, which was kind of annoying.

42:16.400 --> 42:21.280
Um, so Bobby wants to know what system you're doing cyberpunk on a PC.

42:21.440 --> 42:21.680
Okay.

42:21.720 --> 42:24.040
I'm not crazy enough getting a console yet.

42:24.400 --> 42:28.040
Um, no, actually I do want to get it on the Xbox series X at some point, but that

42:28.040 --> 42:29.080
doesn't come out until March.

42:29.360 --> 42:33.160
And from what I hear the console version's a little bit rough, but yeah, I've been

42:33.160 --> 42:39.200
playing on PC, uh, cause I've got a, uh, GTS or I have an RTX, uh, 2070 in my

42:39.200 --> 42:44.440
laptop so I can run, um, you know, some of the Ray Tracy on there.

42:44.440 --> 42:49.240
I think I've been playing a Ray Tracy medium, which is like the ultra, but you

42:49.240 --> 42:53.360
know, kind of a little bit, uh, not super crazy in Ray tracing.

42:53.360 --> 43:00.640
And then I dropped the screen resolution down from 4k to 1440 and I, I mean,

43:00.640 --> 43:02.320
1440 or 1080, I can't remember.

43:02.680 --> 43:10.720
And then also I've been using their, um, DLSS to, uh, up the quality and

43:10.720 --> 43:12.080
get some more frames out of it.

43:12.080 --> 43:13.920
But yeah, it's been running really smooth.

43:14.080 --> 43:20.960
Um, there are bugs, there, there are, there are some weird bugs in the game.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.360
Um, nothing really super game breaking so far.

43:25.360 --> 43:26.280
I've had it crash.

43:26.280 --> 43:30.640
I mean, a few times is the, is the whole penis clipping outside of the jeans thing.

43:30.640 --> 43:32.440
Is that a bug or a feature?

43:32.960 --> 43:34.200
That's, that's the hard question.

43:34.200 --> 43:36.040
That's the hard question I'm asking here.

43:36.040 --> 43:38.680
I know a lot of features are in the eye of the bug holder.

43:39.200 --> 43:43.240
Maybe one where it, it, he's holding something.

43:43.560 --> 43:49.720
I had, I, so I had, um, an issue where my character goes, so it's a,

43:49.720 --> 43:51.480
it's a game about hacking, right?

43:51.480 --> 43:53.400
So what am I going to do to the game?

43:53.600 --> 43:57.840
Of course, I'm going to hack it to try and cheat because that's what I do.

43:58.200 --> 44:00.760
Um, so Eddie Guerrero said you cheat to win.

44:01.240 --> 44:04.800
So I've been messing around with like, you know, uh, cheat editors and

44:04.800 --> 44:07.040
stuff like that to tweak it how I want.

44:07.160 --> 44:11.000
But anyways, so I maxed out, um, some armor on some clothes I had.

44:11.040 --> 44:14.440
Um, some armor on some clothes I had, like your initial starting clothes.

44:14.440 --> 44:15.040
You can do that.

44:15.400 --> 44:21.520
And what happened was is on a reload, like they would refuse to appear.

44:21.520 --> 44:26.160
So like I put the pants and the shirt and stuff on and it would just be invisible.

44:26.640 --> 44:31.120
Um, but it would turn my character into a Ken doll, basically, you know, it just

44:31.120 --> 44:33.200
remove all the genitalia whatsoever.

44:33.560 --> 44:38.320
Um, but then I ended up, I had to wear like a different pair of clothing.

44:38.320 --> 44:40.480
It finally worked and I was able to level that one up.

44:40.480 --> 44:44.080
And then I put a jacket on and everything kind of appeared again, but

44:44.080 --> 44:50.320
I've had other bugs where, um, objects will just like, like my, uh, sidekick.

44:50.600 --> 44:54.520
He was walking through a room and his guns just got stuck in the

44:54.520 --> 44:56.760
middle of the air for some reason.

44:56.920 --> 44:58.640
And so that was weird.

44:58.880 --> 45:01.920
And then there's another one where he had a briefcase and he was holding it

45:01.920 --> 45:03.520
and it also got stuck somewhere.

45:03.720 --> 45:04.720
It just disappeared.

45:04.840 --> 45:06.880
Um, I feel like, okay.

45:06.880 --> 45:10.800
I feel like knowing you low key though, this kind of stuff is almost like a

45:10.800 --> 45:15.120
feature because like, uh, you know, a lot of games are really buggy when they first

45:15.120 --> 45:18.880
came out, like Bethesda games are legendary for this shit, which are three.

45:18.880 --> 45:22.000
I seem to recall was pretty buggy when it came out in the beginning too.

45:22.240 --> 45:24.160
Um, but you love this buggy stuff.

45:24.160 --> 45:27.600
Like driver three was like, you know, a game you played a lot of.

45:27.840 --> 45:31.440
Because of the stupid bugs that were in the game, you know?

45:31.440 --> 45:35.360
So, so it's one of those, he's like, are the, are the, are the bugs really

45:35.600 --> 45:37.200
detracting or are they a feature?

45:38.200 --> 45:39.960
No, it's, it's not really bothering me at all.

45:39.960 --> 45:44.440
There's like, um, if it starts like interfering to the quests and stuff, like

45:44.440 --> 45:48.520
I can't do certain things, like there's some, the, like where they wanted me to

45:48.520 --> 45:50.000
go somewhere and do something.

45:50.040 --> 45:53.720
And it was kind of, I couldn't figure out what it was that they wanted me to do.

45:53.920 --> 45:54.840
So that was kind of annoying.

45:54.840 --> 45:58.520
Some of the way markers that they put in there are confusing as well, because it.

45:59.040 --> 46:02.600
There was one where they wanted me to steal a van and drive it somewhere.

46:02.600 --> 46:07.000
So I, I stole it and I drove through the marker, but what they really wanted me

46:07.000 --> 46:13.160
to do was go past the marker into this, like, uh, warehouse type thing.

46:13.200 --> 46:16.320
And then a new marker would appear, which didn't make any sense.

46:16.320 --> 46:18.640
They should just have the final destination as the marker.

46:19.160 --> 46:22.840
Because I tried to park on the marker instead and I'm like, okay, well,

46:22.840 --> 46:25.320
I'm on this marker, I don't know what it wants me to do.

46:25.560 --> 46:26.600
It's not disappearing.

46:26.600 --> 46:28.000
It's not seeing them getting anywhere.

46:28.120 --> 46:31.600
So I kind of figured I'm like, Oh, they probably want me to drive into this,

46:31.600 --> 46:34.360
like, um, you know, fenced off area.

46:34.360 --> 46:35.440
So, okay, I'll do that.

46:35.480 --> 46:40.200
So I was sure I drove past it and then it finally let, you know, it put

46:40.200 --> 46:42.960
the next marker up and stuff, but it was just a little weird.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.080
It was a little awkward.

46:44.480 --> 46:47.360
Um, I'm trying to think if there's like, I know there was something I saw

46:47.360 --> 46:50.080
that I, I was like, well, that's weird.

46:50.440 --> 46:53.280
Um, Oh yeah.

46:53.560 --> 46:59.560
Well, I don't want to spoil it, but, um, one there's, there's a main

46:59.560 --> 47:01.520
character that dies in the game.

47:02.080 --> 47:03.280
At some point.

47:03.640 --> 47:10.880
And so he, you, you take what he dies when you're with him in a car.

47:11.200 --> 47:17.480
And then, so I got done with this other portion of the game or I

47:17.480 --> 47:19.240
reloaded a save or something.

47:19.720 --> 47:24.760
And his corpse was like bouncing on top of the car.

47:24.800 --> 47:28.280
Like it was clipping through the car and it was just like, he's bouncing.

47:28.680 --> 47:30.920
He was bouncing on the, on the roof of the car.

47:30.920 --> 47:34.040
And I'm like, I don't think that's supposed to be doing that.

47:34.840 --> 47:37.520
The wonderful thing about corpses is corpses are wonderful things.

47:40.360 --> 47:41.600
So that was kind of funny.

47:41.640 --> 47:44.160
Um, what other stuff do they have?

47:44.160 --> 47:45.120
It's kind of funny in there.

47:45.120 --> 47:48.840
So, um, I don't know.

47:48.840 --> 47:55.960
I mean, like it's a, just like the whole city is so packed full of detail, but

47:55.960 --> 48:00.360
because it's like a sprawling metropolis, that's like futuristic, all the roads,

48:00.360 --> 48:03.880
like twist around, so like I may have a way point, that's just like a little

48:03.880 --> 48:07.920
bit away on my map, but I got to drive way the other side of town and then

48:08.200 --> 48:11.600
make a U-turn and come back to hit the road, be able to get up to that spot.

48:11.840 --> 48:16.400
But I mean, minor gripes aside though, it's just, it's such a gorgeous game.

48:16.440 --> 48:17.680
Like it really is.

48:17.840 --> 48:18.440
I get it.

48:18.480 --> 48:21.480
And you know, the, the console versions right now are a little bit rough, but

48:21.480 --> 48:25.440
like, Oh man, on PC, it looks so gorgeous.

48:25.920 --> 48:28.400
So I am really enjoying it despite the bugs.

48:28.400 --> 48:33.280
Um, well, we'll talk more about some of those internet reactions and just a

48:33.280 --> 48:35.640
little bit here when we finish our gaming weeks, but, um, yeah.

48:36.760 --> 48:37.040
Yeah.

48:37.160 --> 48:38.440
Anything else to share with your gaming week?

48:39.120 --> 48:39.920
Oh yeah, yeah, sorry.

48:39.960 --> 48:43.600
Um, so a few other things I did play some more Minecraft.

48:43.640 --> 48:46.200
Um, so there'll be something we'll be talking about a little bit later about

48:46.200 --> 48:49.560
Minecraft that, um, I got to check out this week.

48:49.600 --> 48:56.040
I also, so my son was building a castle and so that led me to go want to check

48:56.080 --> 48:58.760
out the old bog Minecraft server.

48:58.760 --> 49:01.040
So I had downloaded a copy of that.

49:01.200 --> 49:02.680
Like I kept backups of it.

49:02.880 --> 49:03.120
Sure.

49:03.120 --> 49:06.400
So from the Java version, I tried to reload it.

49:06.480 --> 49:12.320
It's I mean, it's from like one 1.08 and we have like, I think we're up to one 16

49:12.320 --> 49:19.760
now and I tried loading it in that new Java version and they loads, but

49:19.760 --> 49:22.840
everything is broken, like all of the redstone and stuff's broken.

49:23.080 --> 49:26.000
And also like it wouldn't load in further chunks out of,

49:26.080 --> 49:27.800
outside the initial area.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.680
So I don't know if I did, I'm sure I did something wrong importing it.

49:30.680 --> 49:33.240
Cause the save files aren't even the same format anymore.

49:33.640 --> 49:38.000
Um, so, but I at least got the show, I'm kind of some of the stuff that, you

49:38.000 --> 49:39.600
know, everybody created and everything.

49:39.600 --> 49:40.320
So that's cool.

49:40.840 --> 49:45.400
Um, and then what else I do, um, more Orna.

49:45.440 --> 49:46.480
I did play some of that.

49:46.560 --> 49:51.080
Um, I talked a little bit about it last week, how I was trying to get, um,

49:51.840 --> 49:54.360
the emulators onto my Xbox series X.

49:54.360 --> 49:57.760
So I was able to get the developer of that to whitelist my account.

49:57.760 --> 50:00.880
So I did get them downloaded the retail versions of those.

50:00.880 --> 50:06.960
So now I can actually run emulators on, um, my Xbox series X without having to go

50:06.960 --> 50:09.120
into developer mode, which is kind of cool.

50:09.440 --> 50:12.920
Um, so I helped to play around with that at some point, but I haven't got a chance

50:12.920 --> 50:17.600
to, but I'm very excited about that because I can put even like Wii games

50:17.600 --> 50:20.360
on there and stuff, uh, GameCube games around on it.

50:20.360 --> 50:22.280
I mean, it's going to be pretty crazy.

50:22.920 --> 50:25.440
Um, so we'll play with that a little bit later, but, and then, like I said,

50:25.440 --> 50:29.400
I did work a little bit on my game, but not a ton, I will probably work on it

50:29.400 --> 50:32.480
more this week though, because I do want to, uh, put some more progress in it.

50:32.480 --> 50:35.960
We, I, we were discussing the new level ideas.

50:35.960 --> 50:39.520
So one of the things that did come up was a cyber poop 2077.

50:39.920 --> 50:42.640
We have to do like a cyberpunk level or something.

50:43.880 --> 50:45.720
I appreciate that very much.

50:45.840 --> 50:48.280
Um, so, so we may have to do that.

50:48.280 --> 50:50.440
Um, so that might be something that's coming.

50:50.840 --> 50:51.280
All right.

50:51.320 --> 50:52.440
Nice little tease there.

50:52.480 --> 50:53.200
Uh, I like that.

50:53.360 --> 50:57.280
Are you going to emulate your game on an Xbox series X?

50:58.520 --> 50:59.800
Um, if it'll run.

50:59.800 --> 51:02.040
So like I had, it depends on what I ended up doing.

51:02.040 --> 51:07.240
So if I don't do animated tiles, which, uh, and I don't do any sort of like.

51:07.880 --> 51:08.840
Data saving.

51:08.840 --> 51:10.960
So I don't have like a high score table that saves.

51:11.000 --> 51:15.600
I can change it from a mapper 30 to a mapper two, which is more

51:15.600 --> 51:17.560
compatible with emulators.

51:17.600 --> 51:21.680
A mapper 30 is really only pop or compatible with a few different types

51:21.680 --> 51:23.560
of emulators because it's relatively new.

51:23.880 --> 51:27.760
So like probably messin or FC UX, I think.

51:28.280 --> 51:30.560
Um, I don't know.

51:30.560 --> 51:33.240
I had to check and see what, what it'll work with, but there there's

51:33.240 --> 51:36.800
way this, the converted, if I don't use certain features, I can't wait

51:36.800 --> 51:38.280
to steal your game and emulate it.

51:40.120 --> 51:43.320
Well, I mean, it's emulating right now, so you can definitely do it with messin.

51:43.320 --> 51:47.240
I mean, that's what's what's showing on screen, but, um, but yeah.

51:47.360 --> 51:47.880
Eventually.

51:48.000 --> 51:48.480
All right.

51:48.680 --> 51:49.000
All right.

51:49.040 --> 51:53.640
Eventually someday we'll find my cart on one of those Chinese bootleg things.

51:53.960 --> 51:54.840
I'll see you in the video.

51:54.840 --> 51:56.800
One example, what's this pixel poops game.

51:56.800 --> 51:58.880
This is weird, stupid.

51:59.240 --> 51:59.640
All right.

51:59.640 --> 52:04.640
So some Joe Schmoe YouTube video going the 10 stupidest NES games ever made.

52:04.960 --> 52:05.360
All right.

52:05.360 --> 52:08.480
Uh, anyway, uh, my gaming week.

52:08.480 --> 52:12.240
So, um, I've been playing a variety of stuff continuing on dragon quest 11,

52:12.280 --> 52:14.520
uh, definitive edition on Xbox series X.

52:14.520 --> 52:15.680
I was talking about that last week.

52:15.920 --> 52:18.320
I'm definitely way past the point I was on PlayStation four.

52:18.320 --> 52:20.840
I'm just about to the 20 hour mark in the game.

52:21.120 --> 52:23.800
Um, I just, um, how do I say this spoiler free?

52:23.960 --> 52:31.120
I just fought a giant spider as a boss in a cave that was underground, a city that

52:31.120 --> 52:35.040
had, so I'll just say that to keep it very vague, that is where I'm at in the game.

52:35.040 --> 52:37.560
So I feel like I'm a decent chunk of the game into it.

52:37.920 --> 52:42.920
Um, and, uh, I went back cause I was finding some of those little, um, what

52:42.920 --> 52:47.440
are the little toggles I think they're called, I forget their name, but that

52:47.440 --> 52:51.160
opens up the whole thing that was in the 3DS version of the game, the ticker tin.

52:51.160 --> 52:54.200
I'm probably missing up the name, but I went back and did some of that too.

52:54.200 --> 52:55.360
Cause that was kind of interesting.

52:55.360 --> 52:57.840
And it's, I didn't realize that they all kind of played into each other.

52:58.000 --> 53:02.760
Like you might have to get an item for one, like for dragon quest threes,

53:02.760 --> 53:05.400
little flashback from dragon quest nine flashbacks.

53:05.400 --> 53:06.520
I thought that was kind of interesting.

53:06.840 --> 53:11.960
So, um, yeah, that was, uh, my experience with dragon quest 11.

53:11.960 --> 53:12.720
Still been playing that.

53:12.960 --> 53:16.560
Um, continuing on with, you know, Pokemon go the usual, I got 15

53:16.560 --> 53:18.880
Chinese over the weekend cause they had the big community day.

53:19.120 --> 53:20.960
Kind of best of was this weekend.

53:21.240 --> 53:23.360
And so I played a lot yesterday.

53:23.360 --> 53:26.240
I was only able to play for a little bit today, but I did some

53:26.240 --> 53:27.840
driving around and Bluetooth catching.

53:27.840 --> 53:30.360
I did all Bluetooth catching and that went pretty well.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.080
Um, and then other games, one other game that I checked out this week, that's,

53:34.080 --> 53:35.840
uh, for me is a little bit newer.

53:36.160 --> 53:39.920
Uh, last week we were talking about that the game destiny two was going to be

53:39.920 --> 53:42.480
getting its Xbox series S and X upgrade.

53:42.960 --> 53:43.360
Week.

53:43.360 --> 53:45.480
And I believe it got its PlayStation five upgrade as well.

53:45.800 --> 53:48.480
And so I, uh, went in and I downloaded it.

53:48.520 --> 53:52.720
Um, after the, you know, a patch came out for next gen and I was

53:52.720 --> 53:55.280
checking it out a little bit, you know, and I haven't played it in a while.

53:55.280 --> 53:58.640
I played it briefly when stadia had it.

53:58.880 --> 54:01.840
Uh, well, it still has it, but when I had stadia, which was when, you know,

54:01.840 --> 54:05.280
when Bobby gave me that pass really early on was probably the last time I played

54:05.280 --> 54:07.520
maybe like 20 minutes of, of destiny two.

54:07.840 --> 54:11.360
Um, but the last time I really, really played it was like when it first came out.

54:11.600 --> 54:15.840
So it's interesting to me to see all the changes, because one thing I did notice

54:15.840 --> 54:19.640
right away was that kind of the whole opening of the game is, is different than

54:19.640 --> 54:20.920
what it used to be.

54:21.160 --> 54:26.640
I, I think it was, they used a map that they were still using about two years

54:26.640 --> 54:31.040
ago, but they do it differently so that you don't just go right to the big city.

54:31.040 --> 54:36.000
That was something I noticed was that in the original, you kind of went right to

54:36.000 --> 54:39.840
the big city and you're almost overwhelmed with things to do in this one.

54:39.840 --> 54:44.160
You kind of stick to that first little map and you start to learn more about

54:44.160 --> 54:47.160
like doing quests and bounties and things within that map.

54:47.440 --> 54:48.480
And I thought it was interesting.

54:48.920 --> 54:56.240
And, um, honestly, the, uh, other, uh, uh, thing with destiny on Xbox series X.

54:56.400 --> 54:57.320
It's gorgeous.

54:57.520 --> 55:00.800
It's really, really good looking, uh, and smooth.

55:01.120 --> 55:03.520
And I know that I'm terrible at first person shooters, but I

55:03.520 --> 55:04.280
know that's important.

55:04.600 --> 55:06.280
Um, I w I'm very pleased.

55:06.600 --> 55:11.800
I sometimes see just the tiniest bit of texture pop in, but like I have to be on a

55:11.800 --> 55:16.680
vehicle and I have to be kind of looking for it, uh, in order to, to see that.

55:16.720 --> 55:20.480
Otherwise I think the game runs really smooth and it's, uh, you know, again,

55:20.480 --> 55:22.120
considering it's all on game pass.

55:22.160 --> 55:26.240
Um, well, I think the game is a free to play thing anyway, at this point.

55:26.520 --> 55:28.480
Um, so you can get most of it for free.

55:28.480 --> 55:31.800
I know that beyond light expansion, I think is where they're trying to charge

55:31.800 --> 55:32.560
people right now.

55:32.840 --> 55:35.200
Um, and I don't think that one is free on game pass.

55:35.200 --> 55:38.480
I think everything else is, um, but you know, that's still, it's still a good

55:38.480 --> 55:41.720
chunk of stuff to experience and, um, yeah, I'm, I'm into it.

55:42.000 --> 55:42.720
I think it's pretty neat.

55:42.840 --> 55:47.680
So, um, Questbuster in chat says I should reload destiny two to see

55:47.680 --> 55:49.080
what's changed one of these days.

55:49.280 --> 55:51.440
Well, apparently they got rid of a bunch of maps.

55:51.720 --> 55:55.360
Um, so that's interesting in and of itself as well, or they archive them,

55:55.360 --> 55:56.480
they sent them to the vault.

55:56.840 --> 55:59.720
Um, so maybe they'll come back, uh, for special events or something later.

55:59.800 --> 56:01.120
So, all right.

56:01.400 --> 56:02.440
So yeah, that was my gaming week.

56:02.480 --> 56:05.040
I played a surprising amount of destiny too.

56:05.080 --> 56:06.480
Amongst my dragon quest 11.

56:06.720 --> 56:07.120
Oh yeah.

56:07.120 --> 56:09.160
Final Fantasy 14 got the big story patch.

56:09.200 --> 56:10.840
So I was playing that as well, but that's a given.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.880
When haven't I talked about that game in a week?

56:13.000 --> 56:15.600
I play that game way too much.

56:15.920 --> 56:16.200
All right.

56:17.400 --> 56:21.720
Oh, black compat is correcting me in chat saying beyond light is on game pass two.

56:21.960 --> 56:23.160
I did not realize that.

56:23.200 --> 56:24.880
I thought that was something extra you had to buy.

56:24.920 --> 56:25.880
I stand corrected.

56:26.200 --> 56:27.680
That's part of why we have a live chat.

56:27.680 --> 56:31.240
So that's kind of neat that you get the newest expansion through game pass.

56:31.440 --> 56:31.720
Huh?

56:32.200 --> 56:34.360
Obviously I haven't gotten that far in the game yet.

56:34.600 --> 56:38.000
Uh, to where I know, cause I think now you don't just have light, you have dark.

56:38.200 --> 56:41.120
I think that's the big twist, but I don't, I'm not far enough.

56:41.200 --> 56:43.720
I've, I'm still like basically in the tutorial for God's sake.

56:43.960 --> 56:50.280
Um, I've done some things like I, I was, I've gone to like three

56:50.280 --> 56:51.720
different areas on that map.

56:51.760 --> 56:54.600
So I think I've almost explored that whole map by now.

56:54.600 --> 56:55.600
So yeah.

56:56.080 --> 56:59.000
Uh, quest buster in chat says the new classes are so fun.

56:59.000 --> 56:59.640
I've heard.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.720
Um, I mained a warlock, which is what I'm playing too.

57:02.840 --> 57:05.920
So the stasis class was added for those and I'm curious to see what it's

57:05.920 --> 57:07.720
like, but it's not a free edition.

57:07.960 --> 57:11.120
Well, it sounds like they might have some, uh, stuff on game pass.

57:11.120 --> 57:15.800
They're worth checking out if you're an Xbox person, um, or a PC person.

57:15.920 --> 57:19.800
I don't remember if that whole thing is on PC as well, but yeah, it's,

57:19.800 --> 57:21.400
it runs great on, on series X.

57:21.920 --> 57:22.240
All right.

57:22.280 --> 57:23.280
That's it for my gaming week.

57:23.560 --> 57:26.960
Let's get into some gaming news and for the gaming news this week, we

57:26.960 --> 57:31.080
have to go right back to cyberpunk because it's what lots of people

57:31.080 --> 57:32.000
are talking about, right?

57:32.800 --> 57:33.280
Yep.

57:33.320 --> 57:35.840
It's what, what everyone's talking about.

57:38.200 --> 57:41.480
Well, no, it's not just that it's, it's a little bit buggy.

57:41.760 --> 57:43.120
Um, or a lot buggy.

57:43.160 --> 57:45.240
It's also that it's breaking records.

57:45.240 --> 57:49.560
So it's, uh, breaking the steam records with over 1 million concurrent

57:49.560 --> 57:52.120
players, um, during launch week.

57:52.440 --> 57:58.600
So peeking out at 1 million, 300 thousand, 264 players.

57:59.120 --> 58:05.960
And, uh, previously, apparently the record was, um, held by fallout

58:05.960 --> 58:10.080
four, which was 472,962.

58:10.120 --> 58:10.680
Wow.

58:11.520 --> 58:12.520
That's quite a difference.

58:13.080 --> 58:14.000
Quite a difference.

58:14.000 --> 58:14.360
Yeah.

58:14.440 --> 58:16.240
And I want to say sales wise too.

58:16.240 --> 58:17.680
It's, it's doing really well.

58:18.080 --> 58:23.400
Um, and I want to say I prior to that, the record was actually, I think the

58:23.400 --> 58:28.160
last, um, work world of Warcraft expansion, that Warcraft expansion

58:28.200 --> 58:31.680
had the record for like a week and then cyberpunk came in and took it.

58:32.000 --> 58:35.120
And so that kind of begs the question, how much of this is the pandemic

58:35.320 --> 58:39.320
coming into play and people that are, you know, listening when the folks

58:39.320 --> 58:42.280
say stay at home and so they're staying at home playing video games.

58:42.280 --> 58:46.360
And I think, I think as far as like the steam concurrent players thing, I

58:46.360 --> 58:48.640
think the pandemic plays into that a lot.

58:48.800 --> 58:50.560
And that's not to knock the game success.

58:50.640 --> 58:51.840
Uh, again, I haven't played it.

58:51.840 --> 58:57.360
I have no opinion, but, um, I, I think that part of it certainly

58:57.360 --> 59:01.080
helps, you know, especially when you look at the, the, such that you

59:01.080 --> 59:03.760
had 470,000 was the old record.

59:03.760 --> 59:05.160
And now it's a million.

59:05.400 --> 59:06.680
That's a huge difference.

59:06.680 --> 59:08.360
And I think the pandemic plays into that a bit.

59:08.560 --> 59:11.440
And of course the hype for cyber, it probably would have shattered

59:11.440 --> 59:14.880
the record anyway, but to shatter it that much, I guess that's my real

59:14.880 --> 59:17.840
point to shatter it that much is certainly part of the pandemic.

59:18.440 --> 59:21.040
Well, and I'm curious as though what the launch stuff is.

59:21.040 --> 59:23.960
Cause I, I want to say probably all games across the board and

59:23.960 --> 59:27.160
steam are probably much higher than they were, you know, at launch before.

59:27.360 --> 59:30.040
I don't know if this is necessarily like launch week stuff, or if it's just

59:30.080 --> 59:32.440
in total, like this is the highest peak.

59:32.440 --> 59:36.120
Cause I got to imagine like among us right now is probably pretty high as well.

59:36.240 --> 59:36.560
Sure.

59:36.600 --> 59:40.240
Um, I'd be curious to see if like that, if they're talking about like

59:40.280 --> 59:42.240
launch week, the numbers on that.

59:42.760 --> 59:47.320
Um, so kind of along with that, you know, one thing that's been an

59:47.320 --> 59:52.200
industry trend is basing a lot of their, uh, developer bonuses off of

59:52.200 --> 59:57.080
Metacritic scores and being that it's been kind of, you know, rough

59:57.120 --> 01:00:00.920
around the edges coming out, you know, that could obviously impact scores.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:07.120
Well, apparently, uh, CJ product red, um, exclusive or executives have said

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:14.400
that, um, they take full, um, responsibility for the, uh, complexity of

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:18.120
the game or the, uh, you know, the shortcomings basically, and saying

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:21.760
that developers are going to be getting, you know, their full bonus.

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:26.320
No matter how it reviews, uh, which is really what they should

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.600
be doing in the first place.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:33.760
Um, also we talked about last week, how there was some issues with epilepsy.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:40.720
Um, you know, no warnings that whatsoever in the game, um, but now

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:44.200
they do have a warning that comes up in the beginning of the game.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:48.640
And it says the effect has also been smooth out and the flashes, um,

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.480
reduced in frequency and magnitude.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.680
I didn't notice any flashing in the game.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.920
Um, I'm assuming maybe because they patched this stuff out, but, uh, yeah,

01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:01.880
they patched it out like two days ago, I think, and the original really hurting

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:05.560
people, yeah, Bob, Bobby goes into detail somewhat on his show.

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:09.040
He does not have the condition that causes seizures, but he has a

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.400
different neurological condition and he talks about on his show.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:14.920
So a cheap plug for Bobby Blackwell show, but he kind of talked about how

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:19.080
he was watching a Twitch play through and had to basically go lie down for

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:22.760
a little bit because that sequence came up, uh, on the launch day or the

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:26.360
day after and it kinda, you know, it's, it's, it's set off that whole,

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.680
uh, chain of events there.

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.400
So, um, yeah, that was a real kinda.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:35.320
How in the heck did you manage to do something so stupid, but at least they

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:40.600
patched it out and they were the gal who reported it on Twitter and her

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.160
tweet got all the traction she didn't.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:46.800
She kind of like, I don't want to say she helped them, but basically she

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:51.920
kind of like, she gave her seal of they fixed it, like she gave her yay.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:52.720
I'm so happy.

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.800
My feedback, uh, helped to fix this whole thing, right?

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:56.080
Yeah.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.760
Well, there's actually one of the journalists that was, thank you.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:01:59.920
Bobby says she did help them.

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.600
I suffered a seizure from it.

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:05.720
So, um, yeah, it's good that they fixed that.

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:08.360
And some other stuff they also fixed as well, because they didn't patch you

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.760
in our regular basis, they're already up to a 1.04.

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:12.920
So they've done a few patches since launch.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:20.360
Um, they also added that additional, uh, song that was causing DMCA strikes.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:26.080
By the way, uh, a side note here, um, during the game awards, lots of DM,

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.560
lots of, uh, copyrighted music.

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:33.520
Still haven't heard anything about people getting DMCA strikes from the game awards,

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:36.920
especially doing co-streaming, but I'd be curious to see what happens

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:40.680
to later with that, uh, quite live question for, okay.

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.520
Bobby says we haven't got struck yet from the co-stream.

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:45.480
I know that cause I would have seen that email too, but did, did we

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:49.800
archive our Thursday stream because part of me was wondering if maybe we

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:54.800
hesitated doing that because I'm the slowest person in the world at archiving

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.120
a well are I'd lose episodes.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:59.360
If Bobby wasn't poking me on Sunday saying, don't forget, save

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:00.360
the archive, you're going to lose it.

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:01.240
I did.

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:06.720
We not archive Thursday's thing because that might actually be because I don't

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.320
think a lot of clips were made.

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:11.680
So we may not get DMCA'd if it wasn't our, okay.

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:12.520
Bobby says it's there.

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:16.240
And then, so we'll find out Bobby was seeing with the, uh, calibrating

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:17.280
their brain dance machines.

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:20.960
So yeah, they, they take out, they've taken out the flashing lights.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.440
It's definitely, you know, here's a light on here.

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:25.680
Here's a light on here.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:27.640
And then they both go on and fades the white.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.720
Um, not really.

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.680
It's not flashing so that that's good.

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:35.960
Um, so that's been taken out of the game.

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:41.800
Um, and of course, you know, some other fun, uh, glitches

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.360
that people are running into.

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:49.560
So there is a glitch right now where, um, Apparently people's genitals in the

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:51.480
game are popping through their pants.

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:54.400
It's clipping through their clothing, which is kind of weird.

01:03:54.520 --> 01:04:00.360
Um, weird or fun, whatever the case may be.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.040
I was like, it's Eric Andre mode.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:09.600
Um, so I've seen the pictures from Dory alley that, that, that does happen.

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:16.280
And it's not, it's not just, um, the males having that problem too.

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:22.280
Uh, apparently women are also having some of their body parts, uh, as well.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.000
So, you know, it's, it's fun.

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:28.120
Um, I can't believe you made a Doria Ali reference.

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:32.760
I think that's the first, how long, how long?

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:34.520
I don't know if anyone else though.

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:37.800
I don't know if people in other parts of the country know what Doria Ali is.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:43.560
It's, it's a, it's, it's a festival in San Francisco, and that's probably

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:47.120
all I need to say about it in regards to that joke for people to get it.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:47.560
Yes.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:55.560
Um, also apparently I know Sony is issuing refunds for cyberpunk if people

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:59.520
are requesting them because of the issues they've been having with the

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:03.160
game on like PlayStation four, especially how it looks.

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:07.760
So that may be something, if folks are interested, honestly, I would say,

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:14.000
especially if you have a PlayStation five or Xbox series X best, if you, if

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.840
you can just wait until, um, it comes out, you know, specifically for those

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:24.640
versions in March, otherwise, I mean, I think it looks okay.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.120
I haven't played it on console yet.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:29.440
I was planning on getting on my Xbox at some point, probably not a huge

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.880
hurry because I have it on PC.

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:34.840
But at some point I probably will get it on there as well.

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:39.920
Um, but definitely if you can do it on PC, that's probably the platform

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:44.160
you want to be on because there's a lot of flexibility with game performance

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:48.240
on there, so you can kind of, you can really tweak that to however you want.

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:51.640
Um, I'm taking the Allen approach to this whole thing.

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:55.360
And, and my, my husband, when it comes to things like cyberpunk is very like,

01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:00.600
you know, I will play it in two years after the game of the year edition is

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:05.520
out after all the mods are out and after, you know, everything is like, it's done.

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:06.640
It's a 100%.

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:09.480
They're not doing anything else for the game and the modding communities on fire.

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.240
That is when I'll step in and play cyberpunk.

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:14.720
And I think in this case, I'm kinda, I'm kinda right there too.

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:20.120
Um, I'm curious about it, but just right now there's this, the gaming backlog

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:22.880
struggle is real, there's so much to play.

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:26.360
I just, I, I'm, I'm not going to get around to that one anytime soon.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:26.920
I'm really not.

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:28.600
Okay.

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:29.160
Yeah.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.240
So that's all the fun stuff with cyberpunk.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:35.080
I'm sure we'll find some more crazy things.

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:40.000
I also saw some, um, some funny glitches where, uh, certain NPC

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.160
characters would follow you no matter where you went in the game, which was

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:47.880
also funny, so they had like this like creepy weird guy that was following you

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:48.200
around.

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:52.840
Um, looking at some comments in chat, uh, code man in chat says, hi, code man.

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.800
It's been a while, uh, says, apparently I read an article where they didn't,

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:59.920
uh, accolades, I think, I think he wanted to use another word there and voice to

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:03.720
text messed him up, uh, maybe, uh, accommodate, uh, VRAM correctly.

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:06.680
And that's one of the reasons why it's buggy on PC.

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:11.360
I think they could have delayed this game another six months.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:12.600
I think he means allocate.

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.320
That's it.

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:13.880
Allocate.

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:14.440
Thank you.

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.720
Um, and I think they could have delayed this game another six months.

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:20.280
And it probably wouldn't have fixed all the bugs, especially on the older

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:25.880
consoles, doing a pretty good job of like, you know, going through it and patching

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:26.320
stuff.

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:27.480
So I don't know.

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:30.040
Black ink.

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:31.520
It's not so bad.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:35.360
Uh, black and Pat in our chat room says I'm playing it on my series X in

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:37.400
performance mode and so far so good.

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:41.400
It are pretty, uh, and I'm not surprised to hear that because you know, the series

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:44.200
X is basically like a, a real high end PC.

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:46.080
It's a dedicated, you know, gaming machine.

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:50.440
And I would, I would, especially after my experience with destiny this week, I would

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:55.800
expect that it runs like butter on the series X and PlayStation five, I'm sure as

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.840
well, which I have yet to see.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.400
So, all right.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:01.800
Any other cyberpunk notes for this week?

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:02.760
I'm sure there'll be more.

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:04.400
Uh, that's it.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:04.840
All right.

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:10.040
Well, one other place that people are playing cyberpunk, um, where apparently

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:14.440
it's a pretty good experience and, you know, uh, despite all the, um, criticisms,

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:19.360
I think that have been levied at Google stadia, uh, the people that have decided

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:23.440
to play cyberpunk on Google stadia are having a pretty good time, um, assuming,

01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:27.680
you know, they have the bandwidth to do it because all that cloud, uh, power and

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.960
everything that goes, it's, it's, it's different, you know, there, everything is

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:33.600
running pretty smooth on that end on stadia.

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:40.120
So that's kind of interesting that with cyberpunk being so buggy on PlayStation

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:44.840
four and, uh, you know, the original X-Box one and all this, it's almost like

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:50.800
it's, this is stadia's best kind of limelight right now for their, what

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:55.440
they're trying to do, like, well, you see how this game doesn't mishmash well

01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:56.680
on all these other platforms.

01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:01.120
It runs great on ours and you don't have to buy a $500 box to do it because, you

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:05.040
know, one could argue that series X and PlayStation five are fine as well, or a

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:10.000
high end PC, but here's where stadia, uh, can probably make its best argument yet.

01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:14.720
Um, However, of course that all still comes down to the question about, do you

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:18.320
have the bandwidth for it, which is, you know, but that's a whole, whole other

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:18.560
thing.

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:20.160
You got to figure out what works for you.

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:26.640
Um, however, eight more European countries now have access to Google stadia,

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:31.400
including Poland, uh, which is important, you know, considering cyberpunk 2077 and

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:35.840
where it was made, uh, but also Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, uh,

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:40.480
Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and Switzerland now all have access to Google

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:40.880
stadia.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:43.040
So that all just rolled out within this last week.

01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:46.920
Um, and of course you can play things like cyberpunk, Assassin's Creed, Valhalla,

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:49.240
Marvel's Avengers, uh, and so forth.

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:54.200
Um, something else of note with Google stadia this week is that the use YouTube

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:58.320
live streaming actually rolled out this week just in time for cyberpunk.

01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.280
I think they knew that that would be kind of a big deal.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:04.160
So I remember they teased that early on and then it wasn't really in the pro to

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:04.720
begin with.

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:08.920
Well, now you can actually go, uh, YouTube streaming.

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:13.200
Uh, it appears to be rolling out and it's now on the service and you can either

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:17.480
stream directly to YouTube or you can use a streaming software to do it.

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:22.080
Although it still kind of pushes you to YouTube for obvious reasons, cause both

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:23.320
are in the Google universe.

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:28.040
Um, so you, you know, you have to still set things like, is it kid appropriate?

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:31.680
Uh, there's optional features like crowd choice and crowd play.

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.520
Uh, you can also pick your audio options.

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:39.080
Do you want to stream YouTube and game chat, YouTube only party chat or nobody

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:40.880
and just have the game audio going there?

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:45.920
Um, so kind of interesting that, uh, that all rolled out just in time for cyberpunk.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:49.120
I have yet to see any streams myself that are using it.

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.920
Um, but I think that's, I think that's.

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:56.400
Again, you know, I've been awfully critical of Google stadia here on the

01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:01.080
show, but I th this week and everything that's happened with cyberpunk has really

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:05.800
given Google an opportunity to say, aha, here's why you need us.

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:10.080
And now maybe they can run with that a little bit and injecting new features

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.600
like the YouTube thing is a, is a decent way to do it and keep people

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:13.680
talking about the platform.

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:15.200
So we'll see what develops again.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.240
I still think the bandwidth issue they're going to have to, especially

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:20.160
with Comcast expanding their caps, but we'll see, we'll see.

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:21.960
So, all right.

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.720
Uh, moving on dark soccer.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:28.880
I know that you said caps, but my brain translated it to cats and I

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:30.560
I'm thinking of expanding cats.

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:34.840
And I don't know that that kind of makes me think of the game where you

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:38.160
have like cats that blow up, like the aunt and the Harry Potter movie.

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:41.280
And you have to pilot them like across the ocean or something

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:42.960
without, you know, deflating your cat.

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:46.520
There was that cat game we saw on the PlayStation five reveal.

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.400
We haven't heard anything on that in a little while.

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:49.480
And I don't think it's exclusive.

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:50.840
I think my cat game sounds better.

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.640
You know, your cat game sounds pretty rad.

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:54.800
All right, moving on.

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:57.320
I'm going to call it ever expanding cats.

01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:57.840
There we go.

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:03.240
Anyway, well, I'm sure we're all familiar with bad robot studio, right?

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:08.160
Um, well there is bad robots game studios, which is JJ Abrams company.

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:13.320
Um, but they got, uh, valves, uh, Michael booth to, uh, to join in.

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:19.120
Um, and he's leading, uh, bad robot games through its first development cycle.

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:24.200
So, um, he's going to serve as the creative director, um, and jumping

01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:26.120
into the video game development.

01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:30.120
Actually it started the gaming dev, uh, division in 2018 and

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.520
he's got a pretty good repertoire.

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:34.440
I mean, just a lot of stuff under his belt.

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:39.560
Um, uh, lead creator for left for dead team fortress to command and conquer

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:44.680
generals, uh, some of the counter-strike games, um, and he's been at blizzard,

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:49.960
uh, EA, uh, I mean, that was a command and conquer red alert two and knocks.

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.760
And social VR director at Facebook.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:13:01.680
Um, but I mean, the thing with bad robot games is that if those licenses carry

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:05.760
over for what they did for some of the, the movies we've got then the newer

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:10.880
star Trek films, uh, star Wars rise of the rise of the Skywalker Cloverfield.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:14.560
Um, and it could be very possible.

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:17.480
Those licenses could expand into video games to have them do the development.

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:22.360
So, I mean, it's just a little bit of a musing there on my part, but,

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:28.920
um, and I think it's going to be, um, be interesting and also, um, the CEO,

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:34.760
uh, who was recently appointed name is Anna Sweet, um, and she was saying

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:38.240
basically that their goal, and I'm going to quote here is to focus on cross

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:42.280
medium world building in order to create games and step with Abrams

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:43.720
television and film projects.

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:47.640
So I'm really looking forward to seeing what comes of the studio.

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.520
I actually have a lot of hope for it.

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:57.600
Um, and as far as, um, they are working on a project right now that has just

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:02.200
been titled triple a title for PC slash console that is designed to immerse

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:06.360
both players and streaming audiences into a co-op cinematic experience.

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:07.280
Okay.

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:11.680
My money, my money's on Cloverfield and that franchise.

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:16.320
Um, but that's, that's just what my gut says.

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:19.160
Cause it's not going to be something like star Trek cause that has too many

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:22.240
other, so it's gotta be something a little more original and cooked up from

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:25.960
the Abrams and so I Cloverfield would make a lot of sense in that whole thing.

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:30.160
And, you know, of course you're going to have a lens flare mode.

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:35.040
If it's going to be a star Trek, I was going to say like with the Ray tracing

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:38.960
powers of these new consoles, you know, I, this is going to be great for the,

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:44.120
uh, lens flares that the bad robots games are sure to have Abrams loves his lens

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:48.920
flare, but you know, you know, actually what I'm hoping for though is it would

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:54.000
be cool if the game is released, that's got a cinematic style that mimics,

01:14:54.080 --> 01:15:01.080
uh, certain cameras and film, because I mean, one of the things that they, he

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:05.080
was, it was specifically when they were shooting, um, the, the star Trek movies

01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:10.240
is that, uh, he was using, I think it was like an older style of camera and, uh,

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:15.320
actually using film just to catch those, those effects, I have to go back and look

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:19.640
for it, but I know it had something to do with the, um, with a specific lens

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:20.200
used on it.

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.840
So I thought it was really cool.

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:26.600
And I was actually, uh, joking about the lens flare thing, Bobby.

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:28.080
Well, let me read Bobby's comment.

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:30.840
Cause, uh, Abrams no longer loves his lens flares.

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:34.560
Uh, his wife pointed out how bad they were in the second star Trek movie.

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:36.440
And he was like, holy shit, you're right.

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:37.680
So Gigi lens flare.

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:39.120
Yeah.

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:42.840
We'll get a sequel to super eight.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:46.880
Remember they did the thing in, um, source engine for super eight back when

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:50.920
that came out, super eight was such a good movie too.

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:56.360
I think that would be awesome, but yeah, unfortunately, it didn't really tie in

01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:00.240
with, um, I was hoping that that movie would tie in with Cloverfield, but I

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:00.920
don't think it did.

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:01.920
No, it didn't.

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:05.320
A lot of weird Cloverfield spinoffs that I haven't watched.

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:08.680
There was a, yeah, there was the, I've never actually seen any of the

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:11.320
Cloverfield at all.

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:14.440
I saw the first one and it was interesting.

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:15.280
Yeah.

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:20.240
The Cloverfield, uh, paradox and then 10 Cloverfield lane and yeah.

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:20.840
Yeah.

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:21.320
I heard that.

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:25.840
I heard that 10 Cloverfield lane is pretty, because John Goodman's in that

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:28.480
one and everybody was saying he got robbed, not getting an Oscar nomination

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:31.600
for it, which is weird to think of Oscar and Cloverfield, but good

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:32.640
acting is good acting, right?

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:33.840
Yeah.

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:38.480
Like, I don't know, maybe when I get back on to this, that kind of movie kick.

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:42.920
To this day, Joan Cusack deserved a Oscar nomination for Adam's Family

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:43.440
Values.

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:45.640
I don't give a shit what you have to say.

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.120
She was actually perfect.

01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.960
She elevates, she, she made that movie about a character that

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:52.280
wasn't just the Adams family.

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:52.920
Sorry.

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:57.440
I just, I need a whole podcast to talk about Joan Cusack.

01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.000
What, what?

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:02.960
We need to have a Joan Cusack double feature where we watch, uh,

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:04.840
Adam's Family Values and toys.

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:06.000
Oh, sure.

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:09.880
I love toys, toys in years.

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.160
And that was my Christmas movie right there.

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:16.560
Wasn't that Tori Amos that did the soundtrack?

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:17.680
I love it.

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:18.400
I love that.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.080
It's like the title song they have.

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:21.120
I don't think it was Tori Amos.

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:24.600
I think it was, um, it was someone along those lines.

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:27.600
And for the life of me, I can't remember one of those piano divas.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:31.080
Yeah, but not like Kate Bush.

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:31.960
She doesn't do anything.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:35.400
Um, Kate, Kate Bush does, does her own.

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:37.920
Kate Bush does things when she damn well feels like it.

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:40.480
And you will respect that fucking Kate Bush.

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:41.320
That's right.

01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.280
She's running up that Hill still for the record.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:45.960
I love Kate Bush.

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:49.840
Like she's like when she puts out a record, like stop everything and do it.

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:50.960
All right.

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:54.240
Another, another artist I really like that might surprise you, who I was just,

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:57.360
I was just thinking the other day, dark cycle, maybe you can guess this one.

01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:00.520
I was just thinking the other day, this artist hasn't released

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:01.960
anything in, in several years.

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:03.880
Tori Amos, by the way, that did that one song.

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:04.520
What is it?

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:05.000
I was right.

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:06.600
The happy worker.

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:12.080
Um, and yeah, and yeah, dark soccer wins and you was in it.

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:14.160
And so is grace Jones.

01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:15.200
Really?

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:18.280
No, but any of us, the artists I was thinking of, like where the hell she been?

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:20.120
She's she's tied up in her castle with her cats.

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:23.120
So jealous of her life.

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:23.520
All right.

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:26.520
Anyway, uh, let's like our sister better.

01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:29.040
All right, let's move on.

01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:29.840
Sorry.

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:32.840
Uh, we've, we've diverted the show into Kate Bush and Enya talk.

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:39.080
Not divert quick next story.

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:45.200
So I know one of the things that was missing at launch for the Xbox series S

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:52.560
and X is some solid Microsoft, uh, first party games well, unfortunately,

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:57.920
2021 doesn't appear to be much of, there's not much of that either.

01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:02.440
So apparently, uh, we don't really know of any first party games that

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.480
are going to be coming in 2021.

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:07.800
Cause the release calendar doesn't include, um, that many.

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:08.280
So.

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:14.040
Halo infinite, uh, was definitely something that I know that was slated

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:16.520
for next year, although I'm not sure.

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.280
I mean, it may be holiday.

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:22.080
Uh, Psychonauts two is also supposed to be coming as well.

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:26.720
I'm surprised though, like with all the third party or all those, um, first

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:28.960
party companies that they have that there's not something else that's coming

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:34.240
out, but right now we don't know of a whole lot else that's, um, coming out.

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:37.920
I know echo generation, something that's supposed to be on its way.

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:42.520
The gunk, uh, the medium, but I don't think we have definitive dates

01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:44.200
on a lot of that stuff as well.

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:53.280
So it's interesting not having like a Microsoft title, like coming very soon.

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:54.000
Yeah.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.960
Especially with, um, Halo getting pushed all the way back to fall,

01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:58.520
which, um, I think came up this week.

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:02.720
Um, and, uh, you know, but again, take the time to get it right.

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:06.040
And if Halo was really, you know, having some issues behind the scenes,

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:11.040
I, again, playing destiny two with all its upgrades and everything kind of

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:16.920
showed me like just how good a Halo game on Xbox series X can be.

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:19.880
So I'm kind of glad they're going to, uh, have it spend a

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:21.040
little more time in the oven.

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:23.240
Um, but I'm not, I don't know.

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:27.960
It's, I can't sit here and go, there's nothing to play on my Xbox series X.

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:30.240
Like I'm not, I'm not feeling that way really.

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:33.160
And you know, I don't know, maybe the game releases are going to be a

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:41.080
little dry early next year, but I feel like what Sony got, like what's Nintendo got.

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:43.680
We don't, I think there's a lot of stuff that have really slowed

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:45.040
down because of the pandemic.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:45.520
Sure.

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:47.160
That's cause there's going to be, and I'm sure you guys are

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:48.120
already shouting them out in chat.

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:49.120
Well, there's this game, there's this game.

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:49.600
Yes.

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:51.160
There's going to be a few big ones here and there.

01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:56.040
But I, I, I think Microsoft being without first party for a few months

01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:59.200
is not the end of the world, as long as they can keep the steady stream

01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:03.760
of releases somehow, uh, as long as they can keep game pass exciting, uh, by

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:05.000
adding new things here and there.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.880
Cause you know, most of the Xbox people have game pass at this point anyway.

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:11.160
Um, and so on, I, I kind of feel like it's going to be fine.

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:13.400
Yeah.

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:15.680
I mean, I'm sure they're going to do fine with games pass.

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:19.040
Uh, I just would like to know when some of these games are coming out, especially

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:24.440
since we've had a lot of stuff teased, especially during E3 time, uh, this year,

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:27.440
you know, they kind of teased a lot of different games that are coming, but.

01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:32.320
I know a lot of those aren't probably even going to make it in 2021.

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:35.640
So it'd be curious to see the, what actually is coming out.

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:38.960
And I'm sure that we'll get more and more of these release

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.720
announcements and stuff coming.

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:45.360
Um, I also wish I knew what Nintendo had aside from rereleases of old games.

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:48.760
It'd be kind of interesting to hear some more about the next, you know,

01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:50.400
breath of the wild game or something.

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:53.000
Um, we'll just have to wait and see, I guess.

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:58.080
Yeah, we don't really know much outside of the, uh, super Mario, uh, 3d lands

01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:58.960
that's, you know, coming out.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:04.240
So I'm expecting we should be getting a direct probably January or February,

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:09.920
which if they wanted to reveal a switch pro would be a good time to do it.

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:13.480
Um, you know, obviously we talked about this last week and I had that fan wank

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:18.480
scenario of, well, could they do a, um, reveal at the game awards?

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:19.840
You brought up a really good counterpoint.

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:22.160
They're not going to do that right before Christmas when they're trying to sell

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:25.200
switches after Christmas fair game.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:32.560
I think they won't announce anything like that until, um, March until March 31st.

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:35.520
I don't think we're going to hear anything from a new switch system.

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:39.400
And if anything, I would see them not releasing it during holiday.

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:41.640
I could even see them release it during the summer.

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:42.080
Yeah.

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:47.040
Um, I don't think it necessarily needs to be in March or even around Christmas time.

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:51.080
Um, it doesn't matter anyways, no one's going to get one because they can't get

01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:56.400
their supply chain figured out, however many decades into this we've been.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:23:00.960
They really should try to figure out how they're going to get that out by next

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:05.040
summer or, you know, next fall, because I think you're going to see society, you

01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:09.520
know, as the coronavirus vaccine starts to get more and more out there and, you

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:13.760
know, things start to, you know, get a little, we get, we have big in person,

01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:16.200
in person gatherings again, we are able to travel again.

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.760
It's obviously, it's not going to happen overnight.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.120
You know, I am being a realist here, but I think you are going to see a big push

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:22.800
in society.

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:26.000
Like there's going to be lots of people that are like, I want to take that

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:26.600
vacation.

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:30.520
I've been waiting a year and a half to do, or I want to go on this big trip or the,

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:35.400
and I feel like having a switch come out for that type of stuff is going to be

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:38.960
like when, when people get moving again and you know, the, the whole country

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:43.200
starts to get back to some semblance of normal, even if that normal now has

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:47.440
tweaks through these things, like, you know, working from home and masks and so

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:51.680
forth, I think you're going to see a big, I think it would be smart of Nintendo

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:55.400
too, even if they are a Japanese company, but I don't necessarily think, you

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:58.440
know, even though Japan has handled the situation very differently, I don't

01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:02.240
think it's necessarily unfair to say that, you know, they wouldn't have a big

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:05.200
push to, you know, getting back to the way things were in summer and fall as

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:05.480
well.

01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:08.520
And having the switch there would be pretty amazing, I think.

01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:10.800
Yeah, yeah.

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:14.920
Well, wait and see, they're on, they're on time table.

01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:17.440
So we'll have to figure out what they're planning on doing.

01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:21.000
SSU 100 Matt in chat says, I hope the national parks get some love again.

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:22.120
I'm sure they will.

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:26.240
You know, if you're looking at doing any travel in 2021, like I know it's

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:29.360
weird, but you want to, you want to try to put that on the calendar sooner

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:32.360
rather than later, because I'm going to tell you, these companies have lost

01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:35.160
a lot of money and they're going to be trying to make it up when everybody

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.840
wants to travel again, it's going to cost money.

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:42.240
So, uh, like I already booked my DragonCon 2021 ticket because, you know, I can

01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:46.000
refund it if the refund policy allows me to, if we're not able, you know, if

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:49.440
Labor Day isn't enough time or, you know, DragonCon is too big of a gathering,

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:53.440
then, okay, then I will refund it and roll it over to 2022, but I wanted to

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:57.480
lock it in now because I expect those prices to go up when, you know, people

01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:59.120
are able to get out and do stuff again.

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:02.320
You should have let me know so we could fly together.

01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:08.600
Uh, I, I had to use credit from last time, but I'll give you the info on what it is.

01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:09.880
Well, we'll see.

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:10.360
We'll see.

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:15.120
I mean, I, um, but I do, I do very much want to go to DragonCon this year.

01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:19.280
Cause I've already sworn not to go to RuPaul's DragCon again, because of just

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:26.000
some of their shit and a lot of the shit that Ru is doing, but I, I really,

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
really want to go to, to DragonCon.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.120
And my thing about that is that afterwards I actually want to just

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:33.520
rent a car and drive back to Alabama to visit my family.

01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:35.040
Oh, that's clever.

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:35.680
You should.

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:36.200
That'd be cool.

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:39.200
I mean, it's from Atlanta to Mobile.

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:41.120
I want to say it's about six hours.

01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:42.760
I know it's about four to Dothan.

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:47.200
That's about as far as it was for, um, when I went from X first place

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:50.120
in Cary, North Carolina, it was about a six hour drive, so yeah.

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:55.640
I think I'd be closer to, um, yeah, that actually, yeah, that's about right.

01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:56.200
That's about right.

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:56.640
Yeah.

01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:00.120
Um, although a part of me also wants to go to Augusta to visit my grandmother's

01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:04.040
cousins, who I haven't seen since I was little, um, and Bob Coffey in chat

01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:07.000
says, I don't see cons being a thing until late 2021 at best.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.800
It depends on how well the adults who are taking over our federal

01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:13.520
government, January 20th can reign in the crazy and actually get some things done.

01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:13.720
Yeah.

01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:17.680
I mean, I realize I'm being optimistic.

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:22.560
Um, but I, I, if I don't have optimism about the future, like then I just.

01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:25.000
Well, I have to have something to look forward to damn it.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000
So, you know, but I full well aware in the back of my mind, it may not happen

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.480
again or DragonCon, maybe a smaller affair this year, they may do something

01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:35.200
where they actually cap attendance at a certain number or something.

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:35.760
I don't know.

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:36.480
I have nothing.

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:39.800
I, I'm just saying there's a lot of things that could happen.

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:41.240
We won't know until we know.

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:44.800
So as, as has been the, the theme of this year.

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:45.320
All right.

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:47.040
Anyway, um, let's move on.

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:48.520
Shall we speak?

01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:51.560
Well, actually, you know what, even though we tangented, it ties

01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:52.800
right into this next story.

01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:55.040
So that's, that's a first.

01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:56.760
Our tangent was a transition.

01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:04.120
Uh, Epic has no plans to do in-person tournaments for the game Fortnite in 2021.

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:08.520
So, you know, uh, as was mentioned by the chatter there, they don't see,

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:11.880
uh, real life events coming back until at least late 2021.

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:15.840
And even though last week we were talking about Penny arcade, trying to

01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:19.000
expo, trying to be on the hopeful side of things and scheduling out events

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.520
for the 2021 year, uh, Epic is taking a different approach.

01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:26.360
The 2021 Fortnite world cup, uh, will not be held in person.

01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:31.280
Uh, the Fortnite champions champion series will be the focus for 2021 as the.

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:36.280
Constant measure of success in the, uh, landscape of competition for Fortnite.

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:40.840
And they're hoping that physical attorneys will return at some point in the future.

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:42.080
Uh, it should be noted.

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:46.640
This could be part of the fact that the season was going to begin on February 4th.

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:49.880
So it was going to be a little early, but they did just decide to do

01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:51.240
a way with, you know, all of it.

01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:56.600
Um, it should be noted that other big events, such as Dota two's, the

01:27:56.600 --> 01:28:01.520
international is still on the table for 2021, um, but we don't know yet.

01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:05.480
Uh, you know, again, and as a lot of you has said, we just have to see how this

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:11.480
whole rollout goes with vaccines and does it give society herd immunity or,

01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:12.800
you know, what's going to happen with it.

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:14.840
So, uh, we shall see.

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:18.880
I, I know as soon as they'll let me get it, I'll be getting it because

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.520
I want to see people again, damn it.

01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:24.520
So, and obviously you have to get it and then you have to wait.

01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:26.920
This is not a, it's not a switch that happens overnight.

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:30.320
So, cause you have to get one, then you get the other, then you still have

01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:33.160
to wait like two or three weeks or maybe even a month to build up the antibodies.

01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:34.520
So, all right.

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:38.480
Anyway, uh, let's move on with our next story, Dark Sakura.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:46.200
Well, you know, it's funny, we talked about Abrams before and he did, you

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:49.400
know, the star Wars movies, I guess we're kind of rolling back maybe a little bit,

01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:54.120
but honestly, um, I'm actually really excited about this movie coming out

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:57.200
because I want to see what Patty Jenkins does with it and that star Wars, rogue

01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:03.560
squadron, and it must be said because I've seen this come up in, in my social

01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:09.680
media several times, but I want to point out then that star Wars rogue squadron.

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:13.360
Is not going to be based off of the games.

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:18.080
Um, it is not an adaptation and I've seen, I've actually seen people start

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:20.600
saying, Oh, it's going to be an adaptation, blah, blah, blah, but no.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.920
Um, she did, however, say that, um, you know, Jenkins said it was going to be

01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:30.440
an original story, but she said that it will be done with quote, great influence

01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:36.720
from both rogue squadron video games and books, so we might have to see what's

01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:40.960
coming on on it is she's actually pulling the origin from a comic book series.

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:42.560
It was written by Michael Stackpole.

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:49.680
Um, that again was directly inspired from, uh, the first two of the star

01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:52.920
Wars movies, which episode four and five, I'm sorry, I think of them when

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.280
they were released as what was first.

01:29:54.920 --> 01:30:00.280
Um, and then, um, and some books called the throng trilogy, which we've heard,

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:04.160
uh, if, well, I guess if you're living under a rock and you haven't

01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:06.800
watched the Mandalorian, I'm not going to say anything else.

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:15.040
Um, but, uh, but I think there's going to be a lot that we'll see as

01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:18.640
homage anyway, but it's still an original story and it's not really

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:21.840
going from not an adaptation as I was saying, so that's it.

01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:25.960
Um, boy, and you know, just as a quick aside, you know, even though it's not

01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:30.160
directly about gaming, but during the game awards, that same night was when

01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:34.760
Disney was doing this big dump of, you know, all this stuff they're planning

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:35.920
during their investor meeting.

01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:39.960
And it's, it's pretty shocking how much they're going to crank out.

01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:46.280
What was an entire clause addressing it in chat, 10 star Wars shows, 10 Marvel

01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:51.200
shows, and I know there was a shit ton of Disney shows too, um, cause 15, I

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:55.400
think, yeah, there was like, I know they were doing one for, um, Tiana, uh,

01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:58.800
from, uh, um, the, the, oh my God.

01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:01.440
And I even love this movie and I can't even remember the name of it in the moment.

01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:02.080
Thank you.

01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:08.240
The Prince of the Frog, uh, is getting a show and, um, the, um, uh, Zootopia

01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:11.400
is getting a, um, series, which I know is going to make some friends of mine

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:15.760
happy and, and there's like a lot of, uh, stuff that's getting expanded on with

01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:16.160
series.

01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:19.400
And then of course I got several text messages alerting me to the fact that

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:23.760
sister act three was confirmed, which is important on, so I made this big, like,

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:25.840
yay, they're doing sister act three.

01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:28.120
And then it was like, and Tyler Perry is co-producing it.

01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:34.600
And I was like, oh, we'll see how that goes.

01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:36.640
Just, I swear to, is it going to have Whoopi?

01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:37.400
Oh yeah.

01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:41.280
Whoopi's Whoopi's like co-producing it and she's very influential in it with

01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:42.000
Tyler Perry.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:48.080
So my own, my only request, you do not put Medea in that fucking movie.

01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:54.920
Do not under any circumstance, Medea is not to be in that movie period.

01:31:55.360 --> 01:32:01.800
Because I just it's let the sister act universe be on its own.

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:03.000
It does not need a crossover.

01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:04.120
Kathy Najimy.

01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:04.840
Yes.

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:09.560
Uh, I don't know if they would be able to get, um, um, Maggie Smith.

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:13.000
Um, poor thing is, is very, very old at this point, but I'd love it if she made

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:13.800
a cameo somehow.

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:15.400
Oh, I love her.

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:16.400
Okay.

01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:20.920
Sia Tabiri says sister act three is just being bankrolled by Tyler Perry.

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:21.320
Okay.

01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:24.360
Well, good, I guess.

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:25.520
Oh yeah.

01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:28.280
And Hocus Pocus too is actually, that was, yeah.

01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:29.040
Yeah.

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:31.560
So I haven't seen the first one and I can actually still quote the movie.

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.800
I'm the same way with Mean Girls.

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:42.840
All, um, all of those announcements and nothing about Tron, nothing.

01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:47.520
But you know, they did make those mentions, uh, earlier in the year that

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:50.360
there was something going on behind the scenes for Tron.

01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:52.000
Maybe they just turned to a trailer point.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.440
Cause this is like trailer stuff, you know.

01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:55.360
Not everything though.

01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:56.720
They have a lot of announcements.

01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:57.800
It had no trailers.

01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:02.440
They have to just like title cards or we had, we had a teaser about something

01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:06.240
would care about his Tron, all Tron all the time, but the only thing we had was

01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:08.640
that tease that Jared Leto was somehow involved.

01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:09.360
Yay.

01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:15.400
Excuse me while I go.

01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:19.240
Why can't we just get a sequel to the last movie?

01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:21.840
Why, why would that be such a hard thing to do?

01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:26.760
And it definitely needs a Cillian Anderson in it as, um, cause he's a

01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:30.240
Derringer's kid and I'm sorry.

01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:32.240
Murphy's pretty Cillian Murphy.

01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:37.560
Why I say Murphy, but anyway, he's Jillian Anderson could absolutely be in Tron.

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:40.040
If she wanted to be, I meant Cillian Murphy.

01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:41.320
Yeah, excuse me.

01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:46.080
I, but, but he's so pretty and I want him to be, um, Derringer.

01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:50.000
Like takeover, like with an MCP and everything, not like a complete

01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:53.640
rehash of the first movie, but I would fucking love to see them do something.

01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:56.840
All right, let's move on from Disney chat.

01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:59.360
Although I knew it would come up at some point, but there was just, there was a

01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:02.320
lot of stuff that came out there and I saw the discord blown up with all that

01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:04.560
too over at vog network.com slash discord.

01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:06.560
Some of you guys like to share articles throughout the week.

01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:10.800
Rob, you know what we just need to do is just take a quick, you know, hiatus

01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:14.920
during the halfway of the show, take an intermission run to Del Taco and get

01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:19.800
some churros and run back churro chat on orange laundry, churro chat.

01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:23.640
All right, moving on serious stuff though.

01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:28.400
Uh, Twitch chat, we've got a couple of stories about Twitch and, um, one,

01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:31.120
one, I think is generally good news.

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:32.680
The other one really not good news.

01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:34.280
And we'll start with the not good news, right?

01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:34.560
Logie.

01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:36.000
Yeah.

01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:44.000
So right now, um, the, uh, U S government has to pass a spending bill basically

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.160
to approve the spending for, uh, next year.

01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:53.720
And with that, what is something that's been happened in the past is that they

01:34:53.720 --> 01:35:01.320
try to sneak in different, um, measures just that might not be able to pass on

01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:05.120
their own, but then also might be something that they may not just

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:08.920
necessarily vehemently disagree with just to try to get it passed.

01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:13.800
And that's what we have Republican Senator Thom Tillis doing with a

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:18.440
proposal that would turn unauthorized commercial streaming of copyright

01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:24.640
music, um, into like, for example, an album on YouTube video clip on Twitch

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:30.480
or song and Instagram story into a felony offense with possible prison sentence.

01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:38.040
Uh, apparently, you know, this obviously is not a good thing and it should be of

01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:43.800
no surprise that Tillis is also being funded by PACS that are, um, have

01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:51.040
donations with ties to the MPAA, uh, the Sony pictures, universal music group,

01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:56.560
Comcast, NBC universal, um, the internet and television associations,

01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:58.400
Salem media group and Warner music.

01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:03.000
So basically in the pocket of all of those media companies and trying to

01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:09.680
pass something that would try to basically end all fair use of, you know,

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:13.360
copyrighted material, uh, it's a really dangerous thing.

01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:18.160
And so of course, you know, there has been several folks that have spoken out

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:25.000
against it, the EFF and internet archive, uh, the American liberal library

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.120
association center for democracy and technology collective, um, have all

01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:35.560
sent letters to the Senate last week as well, but I mean, right now they

01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:43.120
have kind of a, uh, interim bill that's passed to extend it out to the 18th

01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:47.520
of December, but they are going to be voting on this pretty soon.

01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:51.200
So that it's kind of scary that this is not the first time that they've tried

01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:52.600
to slip something like this in.

01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:54.600
I think he's done it in the past before.

01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:56.680
Just, I don't know.

01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:59.720
I don't understand why this is a thing in our government, how they can just

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:02.120
suddenly slap on other bills to existing bills.

01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:03.120
It's really ridiculous.

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:03.320
Yeah.

01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:04.960
I don't think it should be like that either.

01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:10.680
Um, but, uh, yeah, I, obviously all of us are sitting here going, this is bad, bad

01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:11.040
news.

01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:16.400
Like, I, I understand if, you know, somebody is like filming a movie in a

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:19.840
theater with the intention of trying to distribute that on YouTube, you know, the

01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:21.960
very, very blatant kind of piracy.

01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:26.480
I can, I kind of understand where maybe they want to, I mean, but I don't know,

01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:27.920
a felony for God's sake.

01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:33.360
Like, I don't, I, I, it's, yeah, it's not like, yeah, the, the copyright law needs

01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:37.440
reform, but this is way too much because it's, it's going to get ugly.

01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:40.600
It's going to get ugly for things like Twitch, you know, like we, I think it

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:42.680
needs reform in the other direction.

01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:45.200
I think they've gotten away with way too much as it is.

01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:50.160
And basically, you know, Disney being a big proponent of that, just like really

01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:54.880
the abuse, what we really need to do is get money out of politics, but that's not

01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:56.280
going to be a thing for awhile.

01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:00.040
I mean, that's the problem is you have these people that are basically bought

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:05.120
and paid for politicians that are voting on stuff that only benefits, you know,

01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:08.880
these large companies as if they don't make enough money from their stuff.

01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:13.960
I really don't, they've always been argued or, you know, piracy's hurting

01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:16.480
their business, but like, it's just because they don't want to adapt to

01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:17.800
new business models.

01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:23.840
Um, I just honestly don't think that like a lot of stuff is really hurt that much

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:26.200
by, I mean, these guys are making tons of money.

01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:30.320
A record profits each year, but it's not enough.

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:31.320
They need all of the money.

01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:31.920
Yeah.

01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:36.400
It's like with any though, if you think about it, like a physical store, you

01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:41.480
know, every physical store has a loss prevention group, but they still factor

01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:46.160
in a certain amount of losses from theft.

01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:54.680
And I think that they need to, I'm trying to think of how I want to phrase

01:38:54.680 --> 01:39:02.080
this because also as an artist myself, I do, I've had my work stolen before,

01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:09.840
you know, and I think that the copyright laws need to be stronger to protect

01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:16.480
the, the artists, the, that aren't sponsored by some big company.

01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:22.440
They need to be more stringent for art stolen from the, uh, the independent

01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:26.880
user, and I think not so much for the company, they need to get rid of the

01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:30.280
whole corporations as people things so that it doesn't apply in the same manner.

01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:31.080
Does that make sense?

01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:33.040
You, you, I do agree.

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:36.800
You need to have the ability, like when, when somebody like a, one of these, you

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:41.360
know, websites that sits out there that does a lot of Facebook ads, steals a

01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:44.280
design that you made, and we hear about this type of stuff on social media all

01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:48.400
the time, you need to have a legal way to go after that company that does not

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:51.800
require you to have a super expensive lawyer and all this stuff and things that

01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:53.280
the normal person can't afford.

01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:54.200
Absolutely.

01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:56.920
And that's part of what the copyright law needs to look at.

01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:01.760
But like a felony, like, I mean, it would, I guess it would depend on the

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:02.360
circumstance.

01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:03.040
That's the problem.

01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:06.640
And I think what's, what's like, if you have a particular company that's doing

01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:10.520
this over and over and over again, and that's their whole MO, then maybe I kind

01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:10.960
of get it.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:18.560
Um, but like, I, I feel like the language in this is too broad and it's gonna get

01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:20.600
used not the right way.

01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:21.160
That's the,

01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:25.840
that's why they leave it so broad is so that they can have it be interpreted in

01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:29.800
court a different way at a later time when it eventually does come to it.

01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:30.800
I mean, they bank on this.

01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:31.320
Yeah.

01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:43.120
So I, I, I just have very little respect I think for, well, especially, you know,

01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:47.280
just given the whole state of the Republican party anyway, I look at

01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:52.200
anything that, honestly, I could look at any type of legislation that's announced

01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:58.600
by practically anybody right now in, uh, in Congress with a high suspicion, just

01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:03.120
about there's a few people who I would probably trust on site, but I would still

01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:03.880
want to look it over.

01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:05.960
All right.

01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:10.920
Well, let's move on to something a little more, I think, um, positive for possible

01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:11.960
Twitch future news.

01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:16.760
Uh, and, uh, well, I mean, it's not a positive topic, but it is Twitch taking

01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:19.960
action on something they've been asked to take action on for quite some time.

01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:24.760
And that is a new policy on hateful conduct and harassment was finally rolled

01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:28.800
out, uh, this past week, and it will be going into effect on January 22nd.

01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:32.080
Um, and you might be wondering like, why not now?

01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:37.920
Um, they did the delay to give streamers and audience members time to be ready for

01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:40.960
it and basically either adjust their behavior appropriately.

01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:43.120
I'm assuming provide feedback and so forth.

01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:45.720
Um, but that's why there's a little bit of a gap there.

01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:50.760
Um, so, uh, I'm going to try to summarize some of these things happening here.

01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:54.280
And I think these, these are all things where I'm like, wow, this wasn't there

01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:54.880
before.

01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:56.240
I'm glad it's there.

01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:00.880
Um, Twitch is adding three protected identity characteristics to their list of

01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:04.760
hateful conduct, caste, color, and immigration status.

01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:09.040
So if you attack someone based on one of these traits, which other traits that are

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:14.000
there already include sex, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, racism, so

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000
they're adding these things to it.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:18.840
But if you attack somebody on one of these basis, you basically are risking

01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:19.640
punishment for that.

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:25.600
Um, one that's been getting a lot of like, Oh, interesting kind of reactions is that

01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:30.080
the Confederate flag is now on Twitch's list of hate symbols and it is banned from

01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:30.600
streams.

01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:36.040
Uh, and quote, it is fucking hateful and I'm a southerner quote, given its historic

01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:40.680
and symbolic association with slavery and white supremacist groups in the U S uh, and

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:46.600
also they are, uh, explicitly saying hate groups and propaganda are prohibited as

01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:47.000
well.

01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:53.480
Emotes also fall into this policy, so you may not have some type of, um, I don't

01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:58.520
know, white supremacist sign or whatever code, coded thing in a emote that is

01:42:58.520 --> 01:42:59.400
against the rules.

01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:04.960
Other specific behavior, um, claiming the victim of a well-documented tragedy is a

01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:12.800
crisis actor, encouraging others to docs, hack, SWAT or DDoS somebody and inciting

01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:16.240
malicious raids of another person's social media profiles.

01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:18.840
Again, that's all stuff I think that needs to be there.

01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:22.840
Um, so there's, there's, there's a lot of things here.

01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:28.120
Um, sexual harassment is now, uh, they are adopting a much lower tolerance for

01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:33.360
objectifying or harassing behavior specifically repeatedly commenting on

01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:37.640
someone's attractiveness when they've indicated their discomfort verbally or

01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:39.640
through timeouts and channel bands.

01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:44.800
So if you're continuing to say, you know, Loki, you're looking mighty fine in that

01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:45.720
sweater today.

01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:46.600
Well, thank you.

01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:49.120
Well, see, now if you say that, then I'm not going against that.

01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:52.320
But if you're like, um, you don't need to comment on those things.

01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:53.440
I wish you wouldn't comment on that.

01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:57.320
Then if I were to take that for further and continue that, and I don't, I could

01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:59.400
keep going with the example, but I want to make light of it because it's a very

01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:00.160
serious situation.

01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:01.920
Um, it fucking is.

01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:02.920
Yeah, I'll tell you what.

01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:05.040
I just ended up being blunt about it to begin with.

01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:06.840
I'm like, don't say that to me.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:07.200
Yeah.

01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:08.960
But I'm just finally like that.

01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:09.720
Don't tell me that.

01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:14.240
If somebody ignores that and continues with that, they are now in violation of the

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:14.720
policy.

01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:16.840
So that's, yeah, that's good.

01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:18.920
You know, I'm not going to be fucking polite about it.

01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:23.520
Um, and if you make explicit comments about someone's sexuality or physical

01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:28.080
appearance, even if they're a public figure, it's interesting and sharing

01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:31.480
unsolicited nude images or videos again, I should hope not Christ.

01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:38.520
Um, so, um, yeah, that's, that's great because I can't tell you how many LGBTQ

01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:39.480
streamers I see.

01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:43.560
Um, or, you know, folks are streaming and people go into the streams.

01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:46.320
They're like, LOL, you're gay.

01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:49.920
And it's like, yeah, why, why?

01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:50.520
Yes.

01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:52.160
Random person on the internet.

01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:54.360
I am, I am gay.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.160
Um, thanks.

01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:58.240
You know, it's like stupid crap like that.

01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:03.360
Finally, uh, as part of the statement, I know I'm, I'm reading a lot here, but this

01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:04.160
is important shit.

01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:06.400
Uh, Twitch continued in their statement.

01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:11.680
We know that many people on Twitch, particularly women, members of the LGBTQIA

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:15.400
community, black, indigenous, and people of color, unfortunately continue to

01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:19.400
experience a disproportionate amount of harassment and abuse online, including on

01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:19.960
our service.

01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:24.440
Not only is this blatantly unacceptable, it also undermines the community we're

01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:27.880
building on Twitch and threatens the long-term viability of streaming as a

01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:30.520
career for everyone who wishes to pursue it.

01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:37.400
So I think a lot is to be determined in the enforcement of said guidelines.

01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:41.840
And if we actually see Twitch kind of put in their oomph where their mouth is with

01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:47.400
this, but in the interim, as I did earlier, I shall award one polite clap for

01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:48.040
this update.

01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:55.760
And we will see, uh, I will, uh, uh, award more applause later if they actually,

01:45:55.800 --> 01:46:01.520
uh, put their, uh, enforcement where their mouth is with this and, uh, help to,

01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:05.160
with some of the toxicity on the Twitch environment.

01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:07.920
So, all right.

01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:18.040
Anyhow, um, black compat in chat says the N Bomb folks finally died down on our

01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:19.600
stream over the last few weeks.

01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:20.480
Thank the Lord.

01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:24.120
See, that's how, it just like, it makes me angry.

01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:30.000
Like I just, I want to, when I hear that, because I respect you guys so much, and I

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.640
know you guys work so hard, like I want to know who those people are and I want to

01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:34.440
beat them up.

01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:35.280
Like I do.

01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:41.800
So like, but the, the best I can do on this, this Twitch platform is get the hell

01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:42.840
off my platform.

01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:47.920
If you're one of these people that go into streams and type that type of garbage,

01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:53.720
like it's just completely, we know, we know it's kids.

01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:57.320
Like 90% of the time, it's kids trying to get a rise out of somebody trying to get a

01:46:57.320 --> 01:46:59.640
reaction and it's fucking gross and disgusting.

01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:04.800
Seriously, if only Twitch had the authority to spank these children.

01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:12.320
Or more like if they had been raised to be respectful, then they wouldn't even need

01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:14.000
the supervision to not do that.

01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:18.720
You know, it's clearly a moral failing, I would say.

01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:22.640
And yes, pod culture, I did mean fuck them with a cheese grater dildo.

01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:24.840
At least the adults.

01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:31.000
Um, uh, no one special 77 says in short, don't be a creepy asshole on the internet.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:31.240
Yes.

01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:34.560
And, and you guys that are watching and viewing, we've been very fortunate that

01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:36.320
our community is pretty fucking awesome.

01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:39.120
You, you all know how to conduct yourselves.

01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:41.160
We don't have problems in the chat room.

01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:46.320
Whenever we do have problems in chat, our mods take care of it quick, you know, and

01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:48.040
that, and it's, you know, that's the thing.

01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:54.080
But also like, and Rob, we're, we're so far, the problematic people in themselves

01:47:54.080 --> 01:48:00.400
out to what's that you, you cut out so far, the problematic people have thrown

01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:02.320
themselves out to, that is true too.

01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:04.600
And let's be real dark soccer.

01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:08.520
We are three white people sitting here doing this stream.

01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:11.640
We are not using the LGBT cat tag.

01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:13.600
So it is not obvious that I am gay.

01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:16.320
The two out of three of us qualify.

01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:19.120
It is not, it, that is not something that's there.

01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:23.000
So that's, you know, that's the reality.

01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:31.520
Like, so I'm glad at least Twitch is going to these, um, uh, uh, methods

01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:35.520
to basically ban this for like the, this kind of behavior is unacceptable.

01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:38.560
Across the board and that they're, you know, they're calling out that there

01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:43.080
is a problem because there is, you know, nobody's come into this chat.

01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:48.080
Saying those type of words, especially the one that starts with N.

01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:54.280
And so I, I think it's, it's just disgusting that it's happening to, um,

01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:58.120
two people that love the games industry that I respect so much.

01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:02.320
I got you, I got your back and I will fight those people if I ever see them.

01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:07.640
And we can cuss like a fucking sailor, but that has nothing

01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:09.640
to do with being hateful.

01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:10.120
Yeah.

01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:10.840
Yes.

01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:12.800
I can say, fuck you with a cheese grater.

01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:13.360
Yes.

01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:17.120
But I'm not going to say, fuck you with a cheese grater, insert slur here.

01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:21.880
But yeah, and you're not necessarily directing it at a certain individual.

01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:26.320
You're not going like, fuck you Rob Roberts, but you're not

01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:27.240
saying it here on the show.

01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:27.600
All right.

01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:29.120
Anyway, no, no.

01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:29.640
All right.

01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:30.520
Let's move on.

01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:36.480
I'm, I'm a good girl in public, so Rob, it's a good time next.

01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:37.040
Yes.

01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:41.120
Let's, Ooh, let's, uh, let's move on to happier times.

01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:45.840
We love games and let's talk about, uh, the classic game of the week.

01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:49.840
And we're going to take a trip down memory lane and, uh, we're going to,

01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:53.160
uh, have dark soccer, get into the gaming vault and she's going to find

01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:58.440
a game that she thinks, Hey, you kids, you should be playing this game this week.

01:49:58.520 --> 01:49:59.680
Uh, it's, it's a classic.

01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:00.160
Maybe.

01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:03.240
Well, I don't, maybe this one, I don't know.

01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:06.720
I think you, the game you picked tonight, you literally can't play.

01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:09.600
Uh, well you kind of can, but not the way it was, but anyway.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.200
Um, I will say a reminder for an important reason.

01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:17.480
I know I was gonna say a reminder because I think it ties into this, uh, to qualify

01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:21.280
as a classic game of the week, it usually, unless dark soccer feels like bending

01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:25.800
the rules, which is very rarely a classic game of the week is 10 years or older.

01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:30.320
And so the rules once, and that was for halo to pay my mom's bills.

01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:31.600
No, no.

01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:33.280
Cause halo was over 10 years older than halo.

01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:37.480
The halo was my rule of do not do halo had it.

01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:38.840
It was the halo clause.

01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:39.520
Yes.

01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:39.880
Okay.

01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:40.280
Fair enough.

01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:40.880
All right.

01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:42.080
So dark soccer, let's get to it.

01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:43.200
What is the classic game of the week?

01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:45.680
World of Warcraft cataclysm.

01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:47.080
Wow.

01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:51.000
I'll tell you, I've done world of Warcraft before, but I'm doing cataclysm

01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:57.280
because it, as an expansion, it was a complete fucking do over for world of

01:50:57.280 --> 01:50:57.880
Warcraft.

01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:03.040
And we just had a new story earlier about how the Warcraft expansion for shadow lands

01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:06.440
was considered the best selling selling PC game for about four days.

01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:09.160
So it does, they do qualify as separate games.

01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:12.600
Um, you know, there's, there's another reason I'm bringing this up too.

01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:17.320
Cause you remember every, I played the first iteration of world of Warcraft,

01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:19.720
hated it, played the second one.

01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:20.800
It was okay.

01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:27.560
I played, it was basically, it wasn't until cataclysm came out that I enjoyed

01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:32.360
world of Warcraft and you remember my little goat girl who I still have.

01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:37.960
I, I, so I basically soloed her to 80.

01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:44.560
I didn't do a single, um, uh, dungeon or anything.

01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:48.640
I didn't do a single instance until after I level captor.

01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:53.320
And I think only one time did I ever party.

01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:57.800
And it was cause one thing in that grand that I couldn't beat by myself and I want

01:51:57.800 --> 01:51:59.800
to say that it was you and spike.

01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:02.680
Probably that sounds, sounds, sounds about right.

01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:02.840
Yeah.

01:52:03.720 --> 01:52:09.160
Um, uh, the days of danger squad, but anyway, um, world of Warcraft was the

01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:13.040
third expansion that came out for world of Warcraft, it followed wrath of the

01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:13.600
Lich King.

01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:18.600
Um, it had its announcement at Blizzcon on August 21st, 2009.

01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:24.000
Um, although of course hackers going to hack and people figured shit out and it's

01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:27.320
a release date was on December 7th, 2010.

01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:33.960
So I am basically a just short of a week off of the release date to date.

01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:41.000
So, um, yeah, I kind of hit the line on that one, but at any rate, there was so

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.400
much shit, by the way, I meant 85 and not 80.

01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:48.440
So there was a lot of change that happened with this one.

01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:56.360
So not only did they raise the player level cap to 85, but they completely redid

01:52:56.360 --> 01:52:59.960
the two main continents because prior to cataclysm, you could not fly.

01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:00.680
Remember?

01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:01.720
Oh yeah.

01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:02.120
Yeah.

01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:04.360
Not, not in the original world.

01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:07.760
You said you had like certain flying capable levels.

01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:08.480
I think it was.

01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:12.000
And of course you had, you know, your, your travel points like that.

01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:21.400
Um, but not only, um, did this, uh, create flying areas, uh, basically I think the

01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:31.360
only areas that were not flyable were the two, um, uh, uh, the blood elf starting

01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:40.280
area and the draenei, because those were stored, um, like off the main map, which

01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:42.600
is funny because those two are actually stored on the same map.

01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:43.040
Did you know?

01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:47.520
I, I thought I had heard that back in the day, but I forgot.

01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:52.800
If you, if you boundary break it, you can travel, um, like you fly

01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:56.480
for a fucking long ass time, but then you end up on the other map.

01:53:56.480 --> 01:53:57.280
You can actually see them.

01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:02.920
Um, but any rate, um, it added 10 new dungeons and five new

01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:05.200
raids and a new skill archeology.

01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:08.920
I think I always did jewelcrafting cause it like gave me a lot of money.

01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:09.800
Um, they did.

01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:10.960
I'm going to step away for a minute.

01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:12.080
So don't ask me any other questions.

01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:13.120
Okay, fine.

01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:17.880
Um, but they did, um, redo the glyph system to have three types of glyphs,

01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:20.000
which were prime major and minor.

01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:22.920
And they were permanently learned instead of having to have

01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:24.720
a reagent to remove the slot.

01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:31.040
Um, they added two playable races, the worgen, werewolf, werewolf people, uh,

01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:33.480
for the Alliance and goblins for the horde.

01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:37.320
I had a goblin named Gabrielle and I actually still have her.

01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:38.520
If I decided to play again.

01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:43.880
Um, they did expand some of the classes to be available to more of the races

01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:49.560
and they completely redid, well, they mostly redid Stormwind and really redid,

01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:52.960
I think Orgrimmar, even though I fucking hate Orgrimmar cause that place is like

01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:57.800
a fucking maze, um, and then they overhauled the talent system so that you

01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:02.960
were awarded your first talent point at 10 and then 11 and then once, uh, per

01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:05.480
every two levels until you reach 80.

01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:10.440
And, uh, 81 through 85, you receive a talent point at each level, bringing

01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:15.440
your total to 41 talent points and lets you choose, um, new and

01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:17.560
different or improved abilities.

01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:24.680
Um, and to go ahead and answer you evil protagonist, I am specifically

01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:29.280
referring to this expansion because it pretty much revamped the whole game.

01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:33.120
I can almost look at this as a whole separate game with all

01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:34.160
the changes that they made to it.

01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:40.320
Um, other, um, so basically the big thing with this game is that Deathwing, the

01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:45.400
Destroyer, the evil, uh, dragon thing who was originally Maltharion, the

01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:49.280
earthwarder, um, of the, the, the five, sorry.

01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:49.640
Yeah.

01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:55.680
Five, five aspects, um, were, uh, he went crazy and started burning shit,

01:55:56.320 --> 01:55:57.840
really just started burning shit.

01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:04.080
Um, and he was last seen in Warcraft two.

01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:10.840
Um, so basically he just was wondering around, he literally was wandering around

01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:12.720
the continents, setting shit on fire.

01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:16.800
Um, and he tore through this dimensional barrier.

01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:20.800
So there was this huge cataclysm that reshaped everything.

01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:25.000
Like, uh, there were the Twilight hammer group coming up.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:30.040
There's all kinds of just amazing lore stuff that came into the universe.

01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:33.760
And then of course it changed a lot of things in the

01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:36.280
politics of the various factions.

01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:40.240
Um, so Thrall who was, you know, uh, fucking love Thrall.

01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:42.600
He was so cool as warchief, but anyway, he stepped down.

01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:50.880
Um, and this gave us, uh, Garrosh Hellscream who I hated him and, uh, I, I

01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:54.560
hated him forever and I hated him when he died in the books, cause I actually

01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:58.160
have the, the trial and everything and I hated him and everything else.

01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:03.280
And he's like one of my favorite characters to hate, I swear.

01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:12.400
Um, but anyway, um, we also had, um, the Zandalari, uh, trolls, uh, come back.

01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:14.120
They were really, really cool.

01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:20.640
Um, we had the Firelands, which I remember how fucking long we were working through

01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:24.360
the damn Firelands as our, uh, as our Guild.

01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:26.720
I mean, I got all kinds of screen caps and everything.

01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:28.680
That was the most fun I've had in that game.

01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:35.320
And then, um, they did, uh, the hour of Twilight, um, where one of, it

01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:37.640
was really such a good raid too.

01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:45.840
I love doing that where, um, your last battle is on Deathwing's back and you

01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:47.760
had to really know your shit for this one.

01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:49.480
It was really a lot of fun.

01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:56.600
Um, I mean, honestly, that one and, um, the, uh, crap.

01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:57.320
Now I can't remember.

01:57:57.320 --> 01:58:00.040
And I also, the one that brought in, uh, demon hunters, cause I played

01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:01.080
the shit out of that one too.

01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:02.360
Legion, I'm back.

01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:03.760
Legion.

01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:04.000
Yeah.

01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:07.200
Those two have been my favorite expansions ever.

01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:12.160
Rise of Pandaria was, eh, but these, the other two were great.

01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:15.040
I, and I'll tell you what, I tried to play the Void Elf one and

01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:16.120
fucking, I couldn't get into it.

01:58:16.120 --> 01:58:19.600
So that was probably the last time I played World of Warcraft.

01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:24.520
Um, but any rate, um, there was a big environmental change to it as well,

01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:31.480
because you had an event that was quite literally scarring the, uh, the world

01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:38.080
that, um, they, uh, they actually started, uh, what was they split?

01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:39.040
Um, crap.

01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:40.320
Why can't I think of it now?

01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:41.120
The barons.

01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:41.480
Yeah.

01:58:41.560 --> 01:58:42.400
They split the barons.

01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:46.560
And for anyone who ever played in vanilla, wow.

01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:50.760
Barons chat was special.

01:58:51.240 --> 01:58:52.160
Something else.

01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:57.080
It was eventually the, cause you're stuck in the barons for like what?

01:58:57.080 --> 01:58:58.000
40 levels.

01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:02.240
Not quite that long, but a while, 30, 25, 30 levels.

01:59:02.280 --> 01:59:02.680
Yeah.

01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:07.800
And it's some of the slowest levels to go through as well.

01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:14.880
Um, so this effectively put an end to the, uh, quagmire that was barons chat,

01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:17.800
because then they split it into the two different sides of it.

01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:19.880
Um, and Mary, the two shall meet.

01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:22.800
And just to quickly kind of like address, like, cause a conversation is

01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:26.920
kind of going on in chat about, you know, this particular expansion

01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:28.800
being a classic game of the week.

01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:32.600
I think it's important, you know, to, to note some of the things that World of

01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:37.600
Warcraft, World of Warcraft Cataclysm did, um, it was really the first MMO

01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:41.640
expansion, or at least the biggest that I can think of that was really intent

01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:47.600
on redoing an old world so that you really couldn't revisit the old world

01:59:47.640 --> 01:59:52.440
in its old form, at least until, you know, wow, classic came out way

01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:53.920
later, many years later, right?

01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:58.240
So, um, you know, and some people may point to Final Fantasy 14, but that,

01:59:58.240 --> 02:00:00.280
that redo didn't happen until a couple of years later.

02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:05.600
And actually, uh, now Kiyoshita said, uh, when he approached Realm Reborn,

02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:09.200
he was influenced by World of Warcraft Cataclysm and him and his team played

02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:12.880
quite a bit of it, um, in just, you know, to get, to get a sense of what's

02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:13.880
going on in MMOs.

02:00:13.880 --> 02:00:17.680
And I think a lot of what you see in Realm Reborn kind of comes from World

02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:22.160
of Warcraft and, you know, part of that, the story certainly seems to have some

02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:24.800
heavy, uh, parallels with World of Warcraft Cataclysm.

02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:27.160
So I think, I think that's part of the reason why, you know, this

02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:29.000
particular expansion is notable.

02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:33.280
Well, there's, there's still a little bit more, um, you know, like I was

02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:37.080
saying, flight is unavailable for the Burning Crusade levels, but, um, there

02:00:37.080 --> 02:00:39.120
were some other big things about this.

02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:42.160
Um, and I, I did find that leveling was so much better.

02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:45.560
God, the thing that I hated the most from the old one in the leveling

02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:48.720
mechanics for having to level your individual weapons or your skills in each

02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:53.920
of those, I was so fucking glad when that went away, um, because to me, it

02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:59.680
made the game more of a grind and less fun and the stories were fun.

02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:01.600
The new quests were freaking hilarious.

02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:08.560
Some of them were, um, and then you also had, um, uh, some better PVP, I think.

02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:14.880
So you had your PVP zones that, um, you could, uh, you know, participate

02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:16.640
in your various PVP activities.

02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:20.040
But if you didn't want to, you just, you actually, there's a fairly easy

02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:21.240
way to steer clear of them.

02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:25.440
Um, as long as you stuck to navigating your flight paths, you know?

02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:32.960
Um, and yes, uh, Baron's, I think Baron's chat did revive a bit in classic.

02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:33.920
Rob, you were playing that?

02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:35.560
I was, but I was Alliance.

02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:38.360
So I didn't see the Baron's chat when I played classic.

02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:42.360
Um, so I couldn't tell you, I would assume it's probably still there, but

02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:46.320
it's, it's probably one of those like, LOL, we're in Baron's chat kind of

02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:49.200
things where it's the, the meme is self-aware now.

02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:49.960
Yeah.

02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:53.600
So I'm not sure it's going to be quite the same as it was before.

02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:57.080
You probably still have your occasional Chuck Norris joke, but I think it's one

02:01:57.080 --> 02:02:01.280
of those, the meme has become aware of itself and so just by nature, it's not

02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:01.840
what it was.

02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:06.720
But do you remember how fucking long it took me to get, to get stood in the fire?

02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:10.240
So there's a story about this.

02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:13.400
So, okay.

02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:16.320
Remember how I said Deathwing was flying around burning shit, right?

02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:22.200
He would set the entire instanced area that you were in completely on fire.

02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:23.680
Oh yeah, I remember that.

02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:30.720
And three times I was in an area that got set on fire and did not die.

02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:33.680
And I don't know why.

02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:37.600
I think one of them was because I had just revived from an earlier death.

02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:41.880
And the other two, I think had to do like just where I was standing.

02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:44.040
It was the dumbest thing ever.

02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:47.000
And you remember how angry I was, right?

02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:49.680
I'd be like, I'm in fire and I'm not on fire.

02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:50.560
Right?

02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:55.720
Like, and I would just go around, like just wandering around the entire world

02:02:55.720 --> 02:02:58.240
looking for fucking Deathwing so I could get stood in the fire.

02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:00.680
And then I don't even know what it was.

02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:02.040
I was like in...

02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:04.000
When you're not expecting it, it just happens.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.040
Cheese ball thing.

02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:05.400
Yeah.

02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:06.960
I was, I was, I was mining.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:07.600
That was it.

02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:08.640
Stood in the fire.

02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:12.240
And then someone got the thing I was trying to mine for.

02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:14.800
I got it.

02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:18.920
I got, I have screenshots to this day of my stood in the fire.

02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:22.200
Uh, can I tell you one other little side story that, uh, your

02:03:22.200 --> 02:03:23.640
pick this week made me think of?

02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:27.480
Um, so the fact that this game is, uh, 10 years old, right?

02:03:27.480 --> 02:03:29.920
Cause it came out about, uh, just about 10 years ago this week, give

02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:31.800
or take a week or two, a week or two.

02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:32.200
It did.

02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:32.680
Oh yeah.

02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:34.360
It came out on the 7th of December.

02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:35.120
Oh, well, there you go.

02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:41.400
So, um, uh, Horde House, the side project I was doing, uh, at the beginning with

02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:46.000
Xtaphir and then we added more, uh, cast members later on, Shane and, uh, grandpa

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.400
for, or, uh, you know, captain Matt from Starboard Power Coupling.

02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:51.120
Uh, we're all part of the, uh, Horde House.

02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:56.640
That show started, uh, about six weeks before the Cataclysm patch.

02:03:56.640 --> 02:03:57.480
No, yeah.

02:03:57.480 --> 02:03:59.120
Six weeks before the expansion ish.

02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:01.520
I don't remember the exact day, but I remember it was right at the end of

02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:04.440
Lich King, because I think in like episode four, we were talking about how

02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:05.880
we finally killed the Lich King.

02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:09.120
Thanks to the Cataclysm pre patch and the changes that it had made.

02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:15.120
Um, so it's just, so, so now Horde House qualifies as a classic podcast of the week.

02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:21.280
Uh, it just kind of made me stop and pause and go, Oh my gosh, that show is 10 years old.

02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:25.840
And we did that show for a good, probably like four years.

02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:26.400
I don't know.

02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:26.960
I don't remember.

02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:32.360
Maybe three, four years until we honestly, truly, we all kind of, well,

02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:34.040
most of us burned out on Warcraft.

02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:36.080
I think grandpa stuck with it the longest.

02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:39.120
Uh, and then, uh, Final Fantasy Realm Reborn came out.

02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:43.600
And so we tried for a good, probably the last 20 episodes or so.

02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:48.960
We really tried to make it about like all MMOs, but then at that point, the

02:04:48.960 --> 02:04:52.600
show was just completely losing focus and, and would be the tangent train.

02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:55.040
And I think everybody kind of burned out sadly.

02:04:55.040 --> 02:04:57.240
And that, that's the story of, of Horde House.

02:04:57.560 --> 02:05:04.040
Um, but it was a fun show brings up Leroy Jenkins, which, you know, you cannot

02:05:04.040 --> 02:05:05.920
get the Jenkins achievement anymore.

02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:06.760
Not anymore.

02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:07.480
Not anymore.

02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:07.800
Nope.

02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:09.600
I have the Jenkins achievement.

02:05:09.760 --> 02:05:10.360
I'm happy.

02:05:10.680 --> 02:05:13.480
I think like I got it on my demon hunter too.

02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:15.440
Cause they took that out right after Legion.

02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:15.920
Didn't they?

02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:16.560
Yeah.

02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:17.440
Yeah.

02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:22.600
Um, but you know, one of the cool things though about Cataclysm is that afterwards

02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:27.400
it really did bring out now people who like to boundary break and, you know, I

02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:28.240
loved a boundary break.

02:05:28.280 --> 02:05:30.680
Like I did the non-instant Stratholme.

02:05:31.720 --> 02:05:35.480
I did, uh, I got to that little hidden part just north of Stratholme.

02:05:35.480 --> 02:05:40.320
Remember that had like the tower and like the place to sit and no, because it

02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:41.720
was blocked off for some reason.

02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:42.880
Yeah.

02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:45.920
And then, uh, and then I did a boundary.

02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:51.840
I would go do boundary breaks in, uh, old, uh, an old dungeons, but they, I think

02:05:51.840 --> 02:05:53.960
now they have them like level matched or something.

02:05:54.600 --> 02:06:02.080
And then, um, I did, uh, I spent like two hours outside of the, the boundary

02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:05.840
area for end of time, you know, when you're kind of in that big crater trying

02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:09.400
to fight, uh, the, who was the time dragon?

02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:11.560
Chromie?

02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:11.960
I forget.

02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:15.800
No, not Chrome, not Chromie, uh, the other one.

02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:17.760
Chromie worked for him.

02:06:17.800 --> 02:06:19.240
The one who was the, actually the.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:24.920
I don't remember off the top of my head and all the Warcraft, listen to the show

02:06:24.920 --> 02:06:28.760
or the hourglass one that was so fucking annoying.

02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:31.680
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:31.960
Yeah.

02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:33.040
I remember that boss.

02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:33.280
Yeah.

02:06:34.160 --> 02:06:38.780
But anyway, and also that expansion gave me my favorite ever fight with the two

02:06:38.780 --> 02:06:40.820
dragons with the fabulous flames.

02:06:40.860 --> 02:06:41.460
Oh yeah.

02:06:41.460 --> 02:06:42.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:06:42.860 --> 02:06:47.220
That was my favorite fight ever in an MMO.

02:06:47.380 --> 02:06:49.180
I, to this day, it's my favorite.

02:06:50.060 --> 02:06:53.300
Um, but at any rate, going back to the game itself, instead of, you

02:06:53.300 --> 02:06:54.940
know, waxing nostalgic here.

02:06:55.460 --> 02:06:59.460
Um, it was highly lauded.

02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:06.700
It, it was, um, it was rated, I think 90 on Metacritic.

02:07:07.220 --> 02:07:15.660
Um, nine out of 10 on IGM, uh, uh, a critic score of 9.1 out of 10 for GameSpot.

02:07:15.700 --> 02:07:21.900
I mean, it just, it got so many positive reviews and they were well deserved.

02:07:21.900 --> 02:07:24.420
It was a really well put together game.

02:07:24.940 --> 02:07:28.620
I mean, and I've played, you know, a few MMOs in my time.

02:07:28.620 --> 02:07:31.780
I mean, you know how addicted I was to Ragnarok online for like ever.

02:07:32.420 --> 02:07:40.420
Um, World of Warcraft, this expansion, the Cataclysm expansion completely

02:07:40.460 --> 02:07:44.220
breathed the new life into the game.

02:07:44.220 --> 02:07:52.300
And I would say even into the MMO genre in general, like the fantasy RPG

02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:59.740
style MMO like this, that it, that the entire thing needed while I'm like,

02:07:59.980 --> 02:08:01.500
okay, I'm not going to go back to World of Warcraft.

02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:03.740
I'm done with World of Warcraft and I am done with it.

02:08:04.100 --> 02:08:04.340
Yeah.

02:08:04.500 --> 02:08:11.300
I still think that it was one of the biggest things that expanded

02:08:11.700 --> 02:08:18.020
my love of, of games, because this brought me into playing more

02:08:18.020 --> 02:08:20.220
adventure games of this variety.

02:08:20.620 --> 02:08:23.700
I'm not an MMO person that much anymore, although I am planning

02:08:23.700 --> 02:08:25.580
on going back to, to PSO too.

02:08:25.580 --> 02:08:30.780
I actually quit Final Fantasy 14 without even touching my sub.

02:08:31.860 --> 02:08:34.220
After two months of paying for it.

02:08:34.380 --> 02:08:35.020
Oh yeah.

02:08:35.020 --> 02:08:35.300
Yeah.

02:08:35.340 --> 02:08:36.860
That means I'm probably not going to go back to it.

02:08:37.020 --> 02:08:37.300
Yeah.

02:08:37.580 --> 02:08:39.460
Um, that that's, you know, 24 bucks.

02:08:39.460 --> 02:08:40.780
I can't get back or 28 bucks.

02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:41.460
I can't get back.

02:08:41.740 --> 02:08:46.180
PSO too has that other, the, the big graphic kind of, kind of a

02:08:46.180 --> 02:08:47.500
cataclysm of its own coming up.

02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:50.540
I think it's a, a side game, but it's going to have the enhanced

02:08:50.540 --> 02:08:51.180
graphics and everything.

02:08:51.180 --> 02:08:51.940
It looks really exciting.

02:08:51.940 --> 02:08:57.020
So at least with PSO too, it's a play through your, your cycle and you can be done.

02:08:57.340 --> 02:08:57.580
Yeah.

02:08:58.180 --> 02:09:06.540
You know, but, um, but at any rate, I think that World of Warcraft

02:09:06.540 --> 02:09:13.500
Cataclysm was probably not just for what it did, but for the influence

02:09:13.500 --> 02:09:16.620
that it had, like you even said for Final Fantasy 14, for so many

02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:23.580
other games, it really innovated something that was just sort of dry.

02:09:23.940 --> 02:09:24.100
Yeah.

02:09:24.780 --> 02:09:26.180
Um, revitalizes what I meant.

02:09:26.660 --> 02:09:29.100
And I wanted to say quickly, um, thank you for the kind words

02:09:29.100 --> 02:09:30.940
about, um, Horde House in the chat.

02:09:30.980 --> 02:09:33.140
Um, and I know some of you found OLR through that.

02:09:33.140 --> 02:09:36.380
In fact, I got her, I got a really, really kind message this week, um, kind

02:09:36.380 --> 02:09:39.420
of about Horde House and, and leading to OLR and somebody that's still

02:09:39.420 --> 02:09:41.340
listening, um, after all this time.

02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:44.500
And that's just the type of stuff that just like is all the

02:09:44.500 --> 02:09:46.340
reward I need to do this show.

02:09:46.700 --> 02:09:51.100
Um, but, um, my point is, uh, through that show, I got really, you know,

02:09:51.100 --> 02:09:54.820
introduced to the World of Warcraft community, um, you know, and I met

02:09:54.860 --> 02:09:56.420
a lot of great people through that.

02:09:56.460 --> 02:09:58.660
Um, both at, you know, in real life events.

02:09:58.940 --> 02:10:02.660
Like, um, when the, the time I went to BlizzCon and participated in the,

02:10:02.660 --> 02:10:05.740
the podcast event that was, which I can't remember the con before the

02:10:05.740 --> 02:10:09.020
storm, I think it was called or something, some, some, uh, event that

02:10:09.020 --> 02:10:12.780
they had beforehand, that was a lot of fun and, uh, obviously, um, never

02:10:12.780 --> 02:10:16.180
met in person, but at least worked with online, the, uh, the, the lovely

02:10:16.180 --> 02:10:17.820
folks over at Girls Gone Wow.

02:10:18.100 --> 02:10:20.140
Um, you know, Cyl and Raven and EJ.

02:10:20.140 --> 02:10:22.860
I know, I know Cyl is no longer on that program, but she was back in

02:10:22.860 --> 02:10:24.220
the days we were doing Horde House.

02:10:24.260 --> 02:10:27.420
Obviously Raven and EJ have moved on to Warcraft Radio where they are,

02:10:27.420 --> 02:10:30.460
they are, are doing wonderfully and it's great to see they still do it.

02:10:30.740 --> 02:10:35.660
Um, but you know, my point is I met a lot of amazing like people through this.

02:10:35.860 --> 02:10:40.100
And that's why it's like, I try every expansion to like, can I

02:10:40.100 --> 02:10:42.180
find my love of wow again?

02:10:42.180 --> 02:10:43.340
Can I, is it there?

02:10:43.340 --> 02:10:50.180
Can I find, and it's, um, it's, it's, it's a, it's a time in a capsule that

02:10:50.180 --> 02:10:53.980
I look back fondly on and go, we did some fun fucking things during that

02:10:53.980 --> 02:10:58.140
time and I I'm really happy that it's, that it's continuing for some people.

02:10:58.460 --> 02:11:00.580
Um, uh, and yeah.

02:11:01.260 --> 02:11:02.020
You know what I found?

02:11:02.980 --> 02:11:06.500
I remember when Slagkick and I were going to do a web comic

02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:07.660
called Hillsbrad Blues.

02:11:07.700 --> 02:11:08.220
Yes.

02:11:08.860 --> 02:11:12.140
I found the, the one comic that I put together.

02:11:12.620 --> 02:11:16.220
You know, if you really want to find something rare, find the podcast

02:11:16.260 --> 02:11:18.260
that Slagkick and my husband did.

02:11:18.300 --> 02:11:21.380
Yes, my husband had a podcast and it was called Fabulous Flames.

02:11:21.580 --> 02:11:25.700
And I think they had six or they had like six or seven

02:11:25.700 --> 02:11:27.180
episodes before they flamed out.

02:11:27.380 --> 02:11:32.820
It's because, so I'm going to say something that I couldn't say like seven

02:11:32.820 --> 02:11:36.540
years ago, whenever that show was on, it's because their third host was terrible.

02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:43.500
No, it's, I don't even remember the guy's name, but every episode he

02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:45.020
was just there to shit on the game.

02:11:45.500 --> 02:11:48.180
And I, exactly.

02:11:48.180 --> 02:11:51.220
It's like, I, it's, it's that difference between being

02:11:51.220 --> 02:11:55.180
critical and like being hateful.

02:11:55.220 --> 02:11:56.820
And, and you know what I mean?

02:11:56.900 --> 02:11:58.940
Always be critical of the things that you love.

02:11:58.940 --> 02:12:00.100
Cause that's how it gets better.

02:12:00.180 --> 02:12:00.460
Yeah.

02:12:01.180 --> 02:12:07.020
But don't, don't, you know, open world of Warcraft, put your butt

02:12:07.060 --> 02:12:10.300
over the receptacle that goes into world of Warcraft and shit in it.

02:12:10.620 --> 02:12:10.820
Yeah.

02:12:11.260 --> 02:12:12.060
It is not your toilet.

02:12:12.100 --> 02:12:12.340
Anyway.

02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:12.820
All right.

02:12:12.860 --> 02:12:16.140
This segment has gone on a very long time, dark soccer, and I'm going to

02:12:16.140 --> 02:12:17.020
get in trouble for what I said.

02:12:17.020 --> 02:12:21.540
I'm sure, uh, dark soccer, any last words on this, uh, expansion?

02:12:22.540 --> 02:12:23.740
Um, I miss it.

02:12:23.740 --> 02:12:25.500
I miss, I miss cataclysm.

02:12:25.820 --> 02:12:25.980
Yeah.

02:12:26.020 --> 02:12:30.020
I want to take, if I could take my demon hunter into cataclysm and just play that

02:12:30.020 --> 02:12:32.060
forever, I'd be fucking happy.

02:12:32.060 --> 02:12:33.260
It would be my new animal crossing.

02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:38.740
You never know a world of Warcraft classic may end up, you know, rumor is

02:12:38.740 --> 02:12:41.700
they may go to burning crusade and Lich King, and then maybe stop there.

02:12:41.700 --> 02:12:46.060
Cause what, what cataclysm is for you cat a Lich King is for a lot of people,

02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:49.700
but you never know, uh, if there's demand for it, who knows what may happen.

02:12:49.820 --> 02:12:50.420
Never say never.

02:12:50.780 --> 02:12:51.900
We never thought we'd get a classic.

02:12:51.900 --> 02:12:52.100
Wow.

02:12:52.460 --> 02:12:52.780
We did.

02:12:52.860 --> 02:12:56.300
Actually, you know, the other good thing that came out of me playing a cataclysm.

02:12:57.340 --> 02:12:58.740
Rebecca black, my paladin.

02:12:59.380 --> 02:12:59.940
All right.

02:13:00.220 --> 02:13:02.580
We're definitely going back to the show now.

02:13:02.700 --> 02:13:03.340
So there it is.

02:13:03.900 --> 02:13:06.700
Your classic game of the week, world of Warcraft cataclysm.

02:13:07.540 --> 02:13:07.940
All right.

02:13:08.260 --> 02:13:10.740
I just looked at the time we're running really long tonight.

02:13:10.740 --> 02:13:11.940
Well, we got a late start, but that's all right.

02:13:12.220 --> 02:13:16.020
Uh, so let's, let's, uh, let's go right on into our next

02:13:16.020 --> 02:13:18.500
segment, some rapid fire news and we'll start off with Loki.

02:13:21.180 --> 02:13:21.860
All right.

02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:23.980
So it is not a surprise.

02:13:23.980 --> 02:13:28.780
More, uh, gaming series are coming to Netflix and other streaming services.

02:13:29.180 --> 02:13:32.140
So now Netflix has announced that they're going to be doing

02:13:32.140 --> 02:13:34.500
a Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon.

02:13:34.980 --> 02:13:42.060
So that's set to air in 2022, but, um, not a, not a huge surprise there.

02:13:42.100 --> 02:13:43.660
Lots of gaming stuff coming.

02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:49.700
And then, um, what's kind of cool is Spider-Man Miles Morales on PlayStation

02:13:49.700 --> 02:13:56.180
five was kind of, um, you had basically two options, either a, you could choose

02:13:56.180 --> 02:14:01.300
a 60 FPS version of the game, or you could play the game with Ray tracing on.

02:14:01.300 --> 02:14:05.300
Well, now they have a performance Ray tracing visual mode that you can enable.

02:14:05.620 --> 02:14:08.340
To play with Ray tracing at 60 FPS.

02:14:08.420 --> 02:14:13.620
However, the trade-off is that the scene resolution will be reduced slightly.

02:14:14.060 --> 02:14:17.140
So interesting to see that that's a thing now because definitely

02:14:17.140 --> 02:14:18.540
60 FPS is the way to go.

02:14:18.540 --> 02:14:20.740
But retracing does look pretty nice.

02:14:22.420 --> 02:14:22.860
All right.

02:14:23.460 --> 02:14:26.740
Uh, let's talk about Prince of Persia, the sands of time.

02:14:26.740 --> 02:14:29.300
You know, there was a remake that was going to be happening for that game.

02:14:29.620 --> 02:14:32.020
Uh, and it just got bumped back a little bit.

02:14:32.020 --> 02:14:34.540
This game was originally going to come out January of 2021.

02:14:34.740 --> 02:14:38.460
It's been bumped back to March, which honestly isn't that much of a bump back.

02:14:38.660 --> 02:14:41.700
Um, it's not that bad, but it is news.

02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:44.620
It was delayed that these things happen, but I'm sure it'll

02:14:44.620 --> 02:14:45.940
be cool once it is released.

02:14:46.180 --> 02:14:49.540
Uh, it is coming out on PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC as a reminder,

02:14:49.540 --> 02:14:53.500
this is an upgrade of the original 2003 version from the game cube,

02:14:53.500 --> 02:14:58.020
PlayStation two, Xbox, PC, and Game Boy advance, although I think this,

02:14:58.020 --> 02:15:01.300
uh, remake will take less cues from the Game Boy advance version.

02:15:01.540 --> 02:15:05.180
It's all, it's a complete remake of the Game Boy advance game only.

02:15:06.260 --> 02:15:07.780
Uh, speaking of delays.

02:15:07.940 --> 02:15:09.580
Windjammers 2.

02:15:09.940 --> 02:15:13.820
I know some of you are really, uh, loving your Windjammers.

02:15:13.820 --> 02:15:17.900
And I'm sad to say that Windjammers 2 is going to be bumped back to 2021.

02:15:17.900 --> 02:15:21.220
It was supposed to release this year, but it's getting bumped back.

02:15:21.260 --> 02:15:22.340
And come on.

02:15:22.380 --> 02:15:23.300
Are we surprised?

02:15:23.380 --> 02:15:23.940
I doubt it.

02:15:24.300 --> 02:15:26.340
Delays happen, especially this year.

02:15:26.500 --> 02:15:32.140
So, uh, a variety of delays, meaning like, uh, online mode is some of the stuff,

02:15:32.180 --> 02:15:34.780
uh, the rollback and online mode needs to be tweaked.

02:15:35.020 --> 02:15:36.460
So they're looking at that stuff.

02:15:36.460 --> 02:15:39.740
They're not saying exactly when they're just saying 2021.

02:15:40.140 --> 02:15:43.340
And it's probably best, you know, especially, you know what, especially

02:15:43.340 --> 02:15:46.020
when it comes to the online play and that stuff, take the time to get it right.

02:15:46.300 --> 02:15:48.540
You know, you, you don't want to launch launch week and have

02:15:48.540 --> 02:15:49.540
all that stuff be botched.

02:15:49.780 --> 02:15:51.620
So, uh, best of luck to that team.

02:15:52.100 --> 02:15:52.580
Dark Saga.

02:15:54.140 --> 02:15:58.780
Well, um, something coming to the switch this month on December 21st,

02:15:59.220 --> 02:16:04.940
um, is a game that came out in 2012 originally, uh, Double Dragon neon.

02:16:05.220 --> 02:16:09.380
Um, it's going to be in the eShop published by Majestico, um, and of

02:16:09.380 --> 02:16:10.620
course developed by WayForward.

02:16:11.100 --> 02:16:15.420
Um, but yeah, it first came out, um, on the PS3 and Xbox 360 in September,

02:16:15.420 --> 02:16:18.420
2012, and then on Steam in 2014.

02:16:19.020 --> 02:16:26.740
So, uh, yeah, Double Dragon neon and then, um, ah, happiness, um, Scott

02:16:26.740 --> 02:16:32.380
Pilgrim versus the world, the game complete edition coming out January 2021.

02:16:32.860 --> 02:16:35.980
Um, and that was announced by, uh, Ubisoft.

02:16:35.980 --> 02:16:39.900
It's going to be on PlayStation four, Xbox one, Nintendo switch and Stadia.

02:16:40.260 --> 02:16:44.620
It's going to include Scott Pilgrim versus the world, the game, and then,

02:16:44.660 --> 02:16:48.460
uh, the DLC Knives Chow and Wallace Wells add on packs.

02:16:48.500 --> 02:16:50.060
So there you go.

02:16:50.300 --> 02:16:50.660
Nice.

02:16:50.660 --> 02:16:54.500
And how, how convenient with Prince of Persia moving out of the way in January.

02:16:54.500 --> 02:16:57.140
Now, now Ubisoft can just drop Scott Pilgrim in there instead.

02:16:57.620 --> 02:16:59.420
I know a lot of people excited to see that come back.

02:17:00.260 --> 02:17:03.700
And if there's, uh, Oh God, why can't I think of it?

02:17:03.700 --> 02:17:08.300
Who does the, um, the limited run if limited run does, uh, uh, physical

02:17:08.300 --> 02:17:09.660
version of this, I'm buying it.

02:17:10.420 --> 02:17:14.380
Uh, Sia Tabiri in chat says originally that game came out in 2010 as well.

02:17:14.420 --> 02:17:16.740
Did I, yeah, I guess the movie's about 10 years old.

02:17:16.740 --> 02:17:21.380
Cause they had the, I think the 10 year Blu-ray edition was either this, I feel

02:17:21.380 --> 02:17:23.380
like it was last year recording.

02:17:23.380 --> 02:17:23.860
I think.

02:17:24.340 --> 02:17:25.020
Didn't that happen?

02:17:25.020 --> 02:17:26.980
The cast redoing maybe.

02:17:27.020 --> 02:17:28.220
Yeah, I can't, I can't remember.

02:17:28.380 --> 02:17:32.940
I know we did a screening of it here in SAC, uh, was that 2018?

02:17:32.940 --> 02:17:36.460
Couple of years ago, we did a nice big screen, uh, cult movie night.

02:17:36.460 --> 02:17:37.780
We had a, we had a double feature.

02:17:37.780 --> 02:17:39.020
It was that in Kung Fury.

02:17:39.500 --> 02:17:45.220
Um, and we actually, we had the guy that played Thor in Kung Fury was there.

02:17:45.220 --> 02:17:49.380
And so I got to, some of the perks about my hosting thing is that once in a while

02:17:49.380 --> 02:17:52.100
I get to interview the celebrity on stage and take audience questions, kind of like

02:17:52.100 --> 02:17:53.900
running a panel, but before a movie.

02:17:54.700 --> 02:17:58.980
But in this day, I still actually have the Kung Fury soundtrack in my, uh, uh,

02:17:58.980 --> 02:17:59.500
playlist.

02:17:59.620 --> 02:18:01.020
It was a good movie and it was a fun night.

02:18:01.020 --> 02:18:01.980
That was a real fun night.

02:18:02.060 --> 02:18:05.820
Oh, those are some good, you know, uh, retro new wave there.

02:18:06.220 --> 02:18:08.740
But you know, what's really upsetting, speaking of all that hosting stuff and

02:18:08.740 --> 02:18:14.540
panel, you know, what's really upsetting is that I was supposed to in June do

02:18:14.580 --> 02:18:17.580
clue the movie and we were going to, and you guys know, that's my favorite movie

02:18:17.580 --> 02:18:18.100
of all time.

02:18:18.500 --> 02:18:22.620
We were going to have Leslie Ann Warren in person and I was going to get to do the

02:18:22.620 --> 02:18:24.580
interviewing, uh, for all that.

02:18:24.580 --> 02:18:26.980
And, uh, thanks, COVID.

02:18:27.220 --> 02:18:29.100
No, I was actually cast as Mr.

02:18:29.100 --> 02:18:29.500
Green.

02:18:29.540 --> 02:18:33.100
I decided that the drag up and all that was going to be too much work.

02:18:33.140 --> 02:18:38.500
And there was a, it was fun, but, um, what, you know, it's time to let other people

02:18:38.500 --> 02:18:40.020
do, and I will have fun with Mr.

02:18:40.020 --> 02:18:42.060
Green, um, assuming I get to do it.

02:18:42.060 --> 02:18:44.860
Cause I think they're trying to reschedule it for 2021.

02:18:44.860 --> 02:18:47.980
I think they actually have a date, whether we'll actually get to do it or not.

02:18:47.980 --> 02:18:52.780
I mean, just depends on what's going on in the world, but, uh, I was really bummed

02:18:52.780 --> 02:18:53.580
about that one.

02:18:53.620 --> 02:18:57.220
I mean, I'm very, not to get too tangenty, sorry, especially when we're running

02:18:57.220 --> 02:19:01.020
along already, but you know, doing the Rocky horror stuff and the cult movie

02:19:01.020 --> 02:19:06.060
hosting for years, I was fortunate enough to do a panel, um, a couple years ago at

02:19:06.060 --> 02:19:07.820
one at a convention here in Sacramento.

02:19:07.820 --> 02:19:13.100
And on that panel was Barry Bostwick, who played Brad, um, little Nell, who played,

02:19:13.340 --> 02:19:16.220
I'm sorry, I almost said Magenta, little Nell, who played Columbia and Patricia

02:19:16.220 --> 02:19:18.500
Quinn, who played, uh, Magenta.

02:19:18.620 --> 02:19:23.420
So I got to do a Q and a with three fucking icons.

02:19:23.460 --> 02:19:29.460
And that was like the day I was like, if Lady Patricia Quinn, if they, Oh yes,

02:19:29.460 --> 02:19:29.740
sorry.

02:19:29.740 --> 02:19:30.700
Yes, I'm very sorry.

02:19:31.700 --> 02:19:36.260
If all of my opportunities disappeared tomorrow, I will have still made it.

02:19:36.700 --> 02:19:39.700
I will have done the thing that I don't know if it can ever be topped.

02:19:40.420 --> 02:19:45.140
So anyway, just a little aside, but it was a very exciting thing for me personally.

02:19:45.140 --> 02:19:46.780
So, all right.

02:19:46.860 --> 02:19:50.540
Uh, moving on, uh, let's travel around the world and check out some release

02:19:50.540 --> 02:19:51.180
dates.

02:19:51.380 --> 02:19:52.580
What's coming out this week.

02:19:52.580 --> 02:19:55.140
Loki, not a whole lot of stuff.

02:19:55.180 --> 02:20:00.780
Um, so we have collection of saga, final fantasy legend on Nintendo switch, uh,

02:20:00.820 --> 02:20:07.540
MX GP 2020 on PC PlayStation four and X-Box one demo reborn on

02:20:07.540 --> 02:20:09.540
Nintendo switch, iOS and Android.

02:20:10.340 --> 02:20:16.180
Uh, it looks like a me sheets do no sacrifice on PC and into the switch and

02:20:16.180 --> 02:20:19.300
the Tonia reverse on PlayStation five.

02:20:19.340 --> 02:20:19.780
That's it.

02:20:20.780 --> 02:20:22.740
It's finally starting to slow down a little bit, huh?

02:20:23.580 --> 02:20:24.460
Yeah.

02:20:24.860 --> 02:20:25.140
All right.

02:20:25.140 --> 02:20:27.300
Heading over to Japan and looking at the releases there.

02:20:27.300 --> 02:20:30.580
We still have a few things on the switch this week, including kaleidoscope of

02:20:30.580 --> 02:20:36.700
phantasm prison is out this week on the switch, yokai watch jam, yokai academy Y.

02:20:36.700 --> 02:20:39.460
And I thought those games were on their way out, but I guess we have the

02:20:39.500 --> 02:20:40.900
kind of side game that's coming out.

02:20:41.180 --> 02:20:46.180
Um, the Rayo's work is never done in a regular and limited edition and watch

02:20:46.180 --> 02:20:51.820
spring three, refine the story of the marionette, which erudy, uh, is out in,

02:20:51.900 --> 02:20:56.380
uh, uh, a Japanese edition and a edition with other languages as well.

02:20:56.620 --> 02:21:00.180
Uh, children of Morta is another big release on the switch this week.

02:21:00.300 --> 02:21:04.780
We have a lot of releases this week in Japan, uh, no SIA and family trainer

02:21:04.820 --> 02:21:06.900
also out this week in Japan.

02:21:07.180 --> 02:21:08.660
Taking a look, I could train my family.

02:21:08.900 --> 02:21:12.380
Uh, PlayStation five has a couple of releases this week in Japan, man eater

02:21:12.380 --> 02:21:18.140
and overcooked all you can eat edition and go go five GGN game Neptune reverse

02:21:18.380 --> 02:21:22.700
in regular and limited edition that coming from compile heart.

02:21:22.940 --> 02:21:25.860
So those are some PlayStation five releases quickly looking at the PlayStation

02:21:25.860 --> 02:21:28.500
four to see if anything different jumps out there.

02:21:28.700 --> 02:21:29.940
That's a lot of gogo five.

02:21:30.220 --> 02:21:32.500
That's the Sentai game, right?

02:21:33.420 --> 02:21:34.420
Um, I'm not sure.

02:21:34.420 --> 02:21:34.980
I was just sorry.

02:21:34.980 --> 02:21:36.780
I w I went to PlayStation four for a minute.

02:21:37.460 --> 02:21:40.780
Most of the same stuff on the switch is on the PlayStation four this week.

02:21:41.100 --> 02:21:42.860
Uh, let me look.

02:21:42.940 --> 02:21:44.620
Um, yeah.

02:21:44.700 --> 02:21:46.340
Uh, Kiku Sentai go go five.

02:21:46.860 --> 02:21:47.340
Is that it?

02:21:48.460 --> 02:21:50.660
It's just like an old though.

02:21:50.700 --> 02:21:53.580
Um, Sentai Syria will old by a couple of years.

02:21:53.620 --> 02:21:56.700
It might be because a different world protected by four goddesses.

02:21:56.940 --> 02:21:58.260
They fought for world supremacy.

02:21:58.300 --> 02:21:58.500
Okay.

02:21:58.500 --> 02:21:58.900
Nevermind.

02:21:58.900 --> 02:22:00.180
That's a, that's the game.

02:22:00.180 --> 02:22:01.260
Neptunia reverse.

02:22:01.260 --> 02:22:04.020
The one I just talked about Japanese.

02:22:04.580 --> 02:22:04.940
All right.

02:22:04.980 --> 02:22:10.940
I was just like, why are they doing a game on like such a two year old Sentai series?

02:22:11.380 --> 02:22:11.700
Yeah.

02:22:12.620 --> 02:22:13.060
Okay.

02:22:13.340 --> 02:22:13.700
Thank you.

02:22:13.700 --> 02:22:14.020
I'm sorry.

02:22:14.020 --> 02:22:14.740
I was confused.

02:22:15.060 --> 02:22:15.380
All right.

02:22:15.380 --> 02:22:16.180
We got it figured out.

02:22:16.540 --> 02:22:16.860
All right.

02:22:16.860 --> 02:22:18.140
That's it for a, how about the UK?

02:22:19.100 --> 02:22:22.060
Two games on the 15th for PlayStation and switch.

02:22:22.060 --> 02:22:24.820
We have five nights at Freddy's, uh, help wanted.

02:22:25.580 --> 02:22:30.780
And speaking of old stuff, and then on the 18th, uh, Anima arcade edition.

02:22:32.940 --> 02:22:34.020
That's it on PlayStation.

02:22:35.700 --> 02:22:36.460
All right.

02:22:36.460 --> 02:22:39.180
Let's get into some more news and we'll start with Loki.

02:22:40.020 --> 02:22:40.620
All right.

02:22:40.620 --> 02:22:45.980
So this isn't exactly like break, you know, big, I mean, it's big news, but

02:22:45.980 --> 02:22:52.260
it's not unprecedented because GameStop has been closing stores, uh, quite often

02:22:52.260 --> 02:22:56.820
actually over the last few years as their profits have kind of dropped a little bit.

02:22:57.220 --> 02:23:04.020
Uh, apparently, you know, they had a 30% drop in profits during the same

02:23:04.060 --> 02:23:09.540
period last year, so, um, their fourth quarter ending October 31st.

02:23:09.700 --> 02:23:15.300
And, um, apparently the last course, obviously, because of COVID situation,

02:23:15.300 --> 02:23:19.940
having the closed source, um, during that time period, they're also seeing

02:23:19.940 --> 02:23:24.980
though that they're seeing an increase in profits of 16.5%, uh, comparable

02:23:24.980 --> 02:23:27.860
month to month forum, uh, Thanksgiving.

02:23:27.940 --> 02:23:34.780
And, um, the over last year, because even still with COVID, uh, and having

02:23:34.780 --> 02:23:38.820
to have their stores closed on, despite having their stores closed on

02:23:38.820 --> 02:23:42.580
Thanksgiving, obviously a lot of people are staying home, a lot of, you know,

02:23:42.580 --> 02:23:46.420
new console launch, so a lot of sales are going up because of that, even

02:23:46.420 --> 02:23:51.300
still though, they're looking at closing around a thousand retail stores by the

02:23:51.300 --> 02:23:54.740
end of 2021, and I think that also includes the stores that have been

02:23:54.740 --> 02:23:56.340
previously closed over the last few years.

02:23:56.340 --> 02:24:01.780
So they've had, you know, 462 years that are closed over, uh, 462 stores

02:24:01.780 --> 02:24:08.020
that are closed this year and last year there was like 321, uh, stores.

02:24:08.620 --> 02:24:13.220
Um, so I think they'll bring that total up to a thousand, but that's

02:24:13.220 --> 02:24:14.540
still, that's a lot of stores.

02:24:14.540 --> 02:24:18.260
I know the local store we had over here is closed down, but I mean, to be

02:24:18.260 --> 02:24:22.260
honest, they had a lot of, um, a lot of these duplicate locations that they

02:24:22.260 --> 02:24:27.060
kind of took on as they acquire, you know, even years ago, you know, with,

02:24:27.060 --> 02:24:31.460
uh, fungal land that in, um, EB games and stuff like that, there's a lot of,

02:24:31.500 --> 02:24:33.060
it was really tightly packed.

02:24:33.060 --> 02:24:33.220
Yeah.

02:24:33.220 --> 02:24:36.900
I probably didn't need as many, you know, footprints out there.

02:24:36.940 --> 02:24:41.380
I remember over by sunrise mall, had they, there was one in the mall and

02:24:41.380 --> 02:24:42.740
there was the one across the street.

02:24:43.300 --> 02:24:46.660
So I think only the, I think they closed the one in the mall, if I'm not mistaken.

02:24:47.140 --> 02:24:47.740
They did.

02:24:47.740 --> 02:24:48.100
Yeah.

02:24:48.100 --> 02:24:53.700
So the one that sunrise mall has set, sorry, local job that that place is sad.

02:24:53.700 --> 02:24:55.820
I mean, it was already that way before the pandemic.

02:24:55.860 --> 02:24:58.660
They've already, they already have plans to tear it down and they're

02:24:58.660 --> 02:25:03.580
going to put some housing and they're also putting like a new shopping

02:25:03.580 --> 02:25:05.420
center type open mall type thing.

02:25:05.620 --> 02:25:06.820
They're tearing it down.

02:25:07.820 --> 02:25:08.140
Yeah.

02:25:08.140 --> 02:25:10.660
I didn't know that like a downtown Plaza type thing.

02:25:10.700 --> 02:25:11.340
Holy shit.

02:25:12.020 --> 02:25:13.860
It's not supposed to happen for like five years though.

02:25:13.860 --> 02:25:18.580
So, but eventually they're going to tear it down and rebuild with, um, like.

02:25:19.060 --> 02:25:20.780
That was my childhood.

02:25:20.780 --> 02:25:24.580
Yo, my NES came from that Sears at sunrise mall.

02:25:24.700 --> 02:25:26.980
I play station two came from that GameStop.

02:25:27.500 --> 02:25:30.140
My super nest came from the Montgomery ward across the

02:25:30.140 --> 02:25:30.620
street.

02:25:30.620 --> 02:25:31.700
That's now a target.

02:25:33.220 --> 02:25:34.220
Sunrise mall though.

02:25:34.220 --> 02:25:38.420
Just got so sad that, that, that location though, has been very good

02:25:38.420 --> 02:25:39.300
to me when it comes to gaming.

02:25:39.300 --> 02:25:41.860
Now that I think about it, because that was the target that my X series X

02:25:41.860 --> 02:25:43.540
came from that was able to get in online.

02:25:43.980 --> 02:25:46.900
Uh, and then my, that was the one where we all waited for the week.

02:25:47.260 --> 02:25:47.780
Remember that?

02:25:48.020 --> 02:25:50.260
Well, I didn't wait, but the rest of it was the one.

02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:51.620
Yeah.

02:25:51.620 --> 02:25:55.780
That target there used to be a Montgomery ward there back in the day.

02:25:55.980 --> 02:25:57.300
They tore it down and built the target.

02:25:58.100 --> 02:26:00.340
So that's bird cage.

02:26:00.500 --> 02:26:00.700
Yeah.

02:26:00.700 --> 02:26:01.060
Bird cage.

02:26:01.860 --> 02:26:02.380
Yeah.

02:26:02.660 --> 02:26:04.420
So, um, sorry.

02:26:04.420 --> 02:26:05.620
Local chat, local chat.

02:26:06.380 --> 02:26:06.620
Yeah.

02:26:06.620 --> 02:26:09.340
So, so they are, they are eventually tearing it down.

02:26:09.340 --> 02:26:12.340
I don't know how quickly that's going to happen, but they've had the plans for a

02:26:12.340 --> 02:26:17.460
while now, um, you know, it kind of sucks that they're still putting out more

02:26:17.460 --> 02:26:22.860
housing there, but, um, it's supposed to be like some new, like open air mall

02:26:22.860 --> 02:26:26.340
type thing where they've got, you know, you're still going to have the big

02:26:26.340 --> 02:26:31.940
stores, like, you know, the JC penny and Macy's and stuff like that are

02:26:31.940 --> 02:26:34.220
going to still be there, but they're going to have, like, it's going to be

02:26:34.220 --> 02:26:36.140
like kind of an open air mall or something.

02:26:36.380 --> 02:26:40.020
The way I see it is like kind of what the downtown Plaza was, but.

02:26:41.020 --> 02:26:42.780
So basically it's five years away.

02:26:42.780 --> 02:26:44.260
They're turning it into the bird cage.

02:26:45.700 --> 02:26:46.100
Yeah.

02:26:46.260 --> 02:26:46.820
That's sort of it.

02:26:47.260 --> 02:26:48.860
Local chats that we got to get past local chat.

02:26:48.860 --> 02:26:49.940
We're running along as it is.

02:26:49.940 --> 02:26:51.140
Sorry guys who don't live here.

02:26:52.460 --> 02:26:52.980
All right.

02:26:53.340 --> 02:26:53.900
Uh, okay.

02:26:53.900 --> 02:26:54.540
Let me move on.

02:26:54.540 --> 02:26:57.660
Let's talk about the changes to the Xbox family app.

02:26:57.900 --> 02:27:01.980
So, um, Microsoft is, uh, building some interesting new things into their app.

02:27:01.980 --> 02:27:05.980
And I got to say, you know, even though I don't have a need to do family management,

02:27:06.300 --> 02:27:07.580
uh, I think this is neat.

02:27:07.580 --> 02:27:12.140
I'd be very curious for, um, Loki's take on this since, um, you know, he has kids

02:27:12.140 --> 02:27:14.220
who are getting to that age where they're playing a lot of video games.

02:27:14.620 --> 02:27:19.020
Um, but Microsoft is basically giving, uh, parents ways to monitor their children's

02:27:19.020 --> 02:27:21.340
gaming, including, uh, on this app.

02:27:21.660 --> 02:27:24.380
Uh, the, it's the Xbox family settings app.

02:27:24.540 --> 02:27:30.460
You can go in and one new thing you can now do, you can block the screen time, even

02:27:30.460 --> 02:27:32.580
if they haven't reached their limit yet, basically.

02:27:32.740 --> 02:27:36.620
So if you say, you know, let's say, you know, the kids getting grounded or

02:27:36.620 --> 02:27:40.460
something and time is up right now, you can hit a button and a message pops up on

02:27:40.460 --> 02:27:40.860
screen.

02:27:40.860 --> 02:27:43.020
Your time is up and, uh, that's it.

02:27:43.020 --> 02:27:44.220
No more Xbox thing for them.

02:27:44.540 --> 02:27:49.740
Uh, there's also a new feature where, uh, you can do ask to buy it's already on the

02:27:49.740 --> 02:27:52.540
console, but now it goes into the app as well.

02:27:52.620 --> 02:27:56.860
So basically if a kid says, I want to buy this, then you can review that in the app

02:27:56.860 --> 02:27:58.940
and, you know, allow or lecture.

02:27:59.020 --> 02:28:00.620
And I have experience with that.

02:28:00.620 --> 02:28:03.900
So, uh, yeah, you can do that on PC already.

02:28:04.540 --> 02:28:09.900
So like, um, I think though the problem, I was having so many problems with my son

02:28:09.900 --> 02:28:12.540
being able to friend, like even my other son.

02:28:12.860 --> 02:28:17.740
So I had to like, I think remove a lot of those restrictions, but basically he, if

02:28:17.740 --> 02:28:20.940
like he wanted to buy something, it would send me an email saying he wants to buy it

02:28:20.940 --> 02:28:22.140
and then I could approve it or not.

02:28:22.700 --> 02:28:26.300
Um, but yeah, I mean, that's cool that they have that.

02:28:26.700 --> 02:28:26.940
Yeah.

02:28:28.700 --> 02:28:30.700
Um, all right, let's move on dark Sakura.

02:28:31.420 --> 02:28:35.740
Well, um, for, I have lots of friends.

02:28:35.740 --> 02:28:40.940
I know a lot of our listeners like to, uh, uh, get these vinyl soundtracks now that

02:28:40.940 --> 02:28:43.500
we're seeing a big surgeons and having them released.

02:28:43.820 --> 02:28:48.780
Well, the newest one, um, coming out is the ActRaiser soundtrack, and it's going

02:28:48.780 --> 02:28:49.740
to be reissued.

02:28:50.300 --> 02:28:55.020
Um, it had been, um, uh, out of print since 1991.

02:28:55.740 --> 02:29:01.580
And so this new release is going to have additional tracks and a symphonic suite.

02:29:02.140 --> 02:29:04.540
Um, and of course, you know, who worked on ActRaiser?

02:29:04.540 --> 02:29:05.820
That was Yuzo Koshiro.

02:29:05.820 --> 02:29:06.540
It sure was.

02:29:07.500 --> 02:29:17.980
Yas, who is one of, I would say among the best sound designers for a video game ever.

02:29:17.980 --> 02:29:20.060
Music, music creators for a video game.

02:29:20.620 --> 02:29:28.940
Um, so it is going to be the, the vinyl is quote divine marble blue has illustrated

02:29:28.940 --> 02:29:35.020
sleeves and both, uh, both versions of it that are coming out, whether or not it's

02:29:35.020 --> 02:29:36.460
a vinyl or on CD.

02:29:37.180 --> 02:29:41.980
Um, we'll have an eight page booklet with comments from Yuzo Koshiro, Yusuke

02:29:41.980 --> 02:29:45.660
Chihada and, uh, Nijahachi Haneda.

02:29:45.980 --> 02:29:52.140
Um, and then, uh, some other bonuses from, uh, I'm sorry.

02:29:52.140 --> 02:29:56.300
Some other bonuses are going to be some of the original illustrations done

02:29:56.300 --> 02:29:59.660
specifically for the soundtrack by, um, Ayano Koshiro.

02:30:00.220 --> 02:30:05.900
Um, it is going to be, I'm trying to get the release date.

02:30:05.900 --> 02:30:13.260
So the, um, the vinyl ships on March, 2021, CD January, 2021.

02:30:14.060 --> 02:30:20.620
Um, uh, I don't see anything about the, uh, you can order it internationally.

02:30:20.620 --> 02:30:25.500
It's on the WAIO, uh, um, international store.

02:30:25.500 --> 02:30:33.580
That's W A Y O records.com slash E N um, where amongst some of the other ones

02:30:33.580 --> 02:30:40.860
they have on there is, uh, some, uh, Uematsu, uh, original recordings, um,

02:30:42.540 --> 02:30:45.420
and some Sega soundtracks and through the goods.

02:30:45.420 --> 02:30:48.060
I think one of them is like the Street to Raise soundtrack, some more Yuzo

02:30:48.060 --> 02:30:51.340
Koshiro, and you can also get a Chrono Cross music box there.

02:30:53.420 --> 02:30:54.060
Wow.

02:30:54.060 --> 02:30:55.980
I love the music in Actraiser.

02:30:55.980 --> 02:30:59.340
So, um, I wish I was more into vinyl collecting and that type of stuff.

02:30:59.340 --> 02:31:01.900
So I, I, I bought one, Rob.

02:31:02.300 --> 02:31:05.660
I bought one vinyl and that was ABBA's the visitor's album.

02:31:05.660 --> 02:31:07.900
And I don't even own a record player, but I just wanted it.

02:31:07.900 --> 02:31:09.340
Bought you an ABBA record.

02:31:09.340 --> 02:31:10.940
And I don't know if I've given it to you yet.

02:31:10.940 --> 02:31:11.580
That's right.

02:31:11.580 --> 02:31:12.220
No, you did.

02:31:12.220 --> 02:31:14.300
I got you the other album.

02:31:14.300 --> 02:31:16.300
I, uh, it's, it's over there with the other.

02:31:16.300 --> 02:31:17.020
It just fell over.

02:31:17.020 --> 02:31:17.740
So I can't see it.

02:31:17.740 --> 02:31:18.780
Did give it to you.

02:31:18.780 --> 02:31:19.340
Yeah.

02:31:19.340 --> 02:31:24.700
Um, they actually have like a multi disc grandia Memorial soundtrack, but that's

02:31:24.700 --> 02:31:27.020
like a 50,000 yen.

02:31:27.020 --> 02:31:28.300
And I don't know.

02:31:28.300 --> 02:31:28.940
Oh, sorry.

02:31:28.940 --> 02:31:30.300
This isn't your, oh, it's a Euro.

02:31:30.300 --> 02:31:32.220
Nevermind the hell.

02:31:32.220 --> 02:31:34.060
And so that means it's super expensive.

02:31:34.060 --> 02:31:34.700
Yeah.

02:31:34.700 --> 02:31:35.740
So, yeah.

02:31:36.780 --> 02:31:39.100
But anyway, um, yeah, there you go.

02:31:39.100 --> 02:31:40.220
The soundtrack was good.

02:31:41.500 --> 02:31:42.140
Indeed.

02:31:42.140 --> 02:31:44.780
It was a few more stories for you guys.

02:31:44.780 --> 02:31:47.580
Uh, Loki coming back to something you talked about at the top of the show.

02:31:48.220 --> 02:31:48.860
Yes.

02:31:48.860 --> 02:31:50.940
So, uh, this is pretty exciting.

02:31:50.940 --> 02:31:57.100
So finally, after the long beta that they have, uh, ray tracing has come to

02:31:57.100 --> 02:32:01.260
Minecraft, at least it has all the windows 10 bedrock edition.

02:32:01.260 --> 02:32:06.060
So now you can actually check out, uh, Minecraft with ray tracing.

02:32:06.060 --> 02:32:07.340
However, there's some caveats.

02:32:07.340 --> 02:32:14.220
So one, um, they don't officially put out a texture pack or they haven't put out a

02:32:14.220 --> 02:32:16.300
texture pack yet that supports ray tracing.

02:32:16.300 --> 02:32:20.780
So you have to find a texture pack that does, and then use that.

02:32:20.780 --> 02:32:25.660
And then, um, you know, there's obviously some performance stuff with that as well.

02:32:25.660 --> 02:32:30.620
I did check it out on my world, um, on my realm a little bit and it looks nice.

02:32:30.620 --> 02:32:35.900
Um, the texture pack that I had didn't have like a lot of, um, it wasn't too fancy.

02:32:35.900 --> 02:32:40.140
It was just basically kind of the same type of stuff, but the lighting is really nice

02:32:40.140 --> 02:32:43.820
and it looks, uh, really good, but I'm curious to see what that would look like on.

02:32:43.820 --> 02:32:46.620
I think they should bring it to console on the Xbox series X.

02:32:47.340 --> 02:32:52.060
Um, I'd be curious to see what happens there and they also need to officially put out an

02:32:52.060 --> 02:32:52.940
actual texture pack.

02:32:52.940 --> 02:32:58.460
This is a little bit difficult to find one because there really isn't, uh, one available

02:32:58.460 --> 02:33:02.380
on their store, which is where you think that would initially be.

02:33:02.380 --> 02:33:09.980
You have to go to like Nvidia's page and Nvidia had some partner made, um, texture packs that

02:33:09.980 --> 02:33:11.180
were from the beta.

02:33:11.180 --> 02:33:12.860
And so they weren't necessarily great.

02:33:12.860 --> 02:33:15.180
I had to actually go to some mind sites to find one.

02:33:16.300 --> 02:33:19.340
A little bit of a ridiculous, uh, stuff to go through.

02:33:19.340 --> 02:33:24.060
And even then those didn't look as good as some of the ones that were in like the demo

02:33:24.060 --> 02:33:26.220
levels that they had for the insider program.

02:33:27.420 --> 02:33:30.300
But I mean, it is something you can check out.

02:33:30.300 --> 02:33:32.380
Um, you can toggle it on and off and stuff.

02:33:32.380 --> 02:33:38.140
Um, but like I said, you know, I couldn't get it to, I liked the way it looked, but

02:33:38.140 --> 02:33:40.300
then my kids are like, well, I want that for mine.

02:33:40.300 --> 02:33:45.420
I'm like, well, I'm sorry, you can't run on the switch and you can't run it on your laptop.

02:33:45.420 --> 02:33:47.580
So I'm the only one that gets it.

02:33:47.580 --> 02:33:50.620
Um, but yeah, it's, it's really cool.

02:33:50.620 --> 02:33:51.660
I'm glad it's out of beta.

02:33:51.660 --> 02:33:52.460
So go check it out.

02:33:52.460 --> 02:33:55.580
If you have a card that's capable of doing a retracing.

02:33:55.580 --> 02:33:57.340
So it's pretty cool looking.

02:33:57.340 --> 02:33:59.660
So when are we getting these updates on Xbox series X?

02:33:59.660 --> 02:34:01.180
Since that can do ray tracing.

02:34:01.180 --> 02:34:01.740
I don't know.

02:34:01.740 --> 02:34:04.060
I don't know where the fancy graphics packs going to be.

02:34:04.060 --> 02:34:05.660
Well, it's that that's gone.

02:34:05.660 --> 02:34:08.300
I think at this point that's well, yeah, it's basically this.

02:34:08.300 --> 02:34:09.980
Yeah, it's this instead.

02:34:09.980 --> 02:34:13.580
So, uh, yeah, I'd be curious to see if we get that on series X.

02:34:13.580 --> 02:34:14.140
Why not?

02:34:14.140 --> 02:34:18.540
I mean, not that I play a ton of Minecraft, but every time they do some big change,

02:34:18.540 --> 02:34:20.300
I'm always like, let me see.

02:34:20.300 --> 02:34:22.700
It really is pretty moody.

02:34:22.700 --> 02:34:29.900
Like, um, when you go to the nether, I mean, it's just, it's night and day different for

02:34:29.900 --> 02:34:30.700
the way it looks.

02:34:30.700 --> 02:34:36.140
And also just like caves can be really dark, but also like, it's just, it's more realistic.

02:34:36.140 --> 02:34:41.980
So like you can, um, go into some, like in the vanilla game would be like completely

02:34:41.980 --> 02:34:47.100
pitch black, but then they're, you know, pretty well lit in the ray tracing or vice

02:34:47.100 --> 02:34:47.500
versa.

02:34:47.500 --> 02:34:51.740
You could have some that, you know, some caves that are dark, but your contrast is turned

02:34:51.740 --> 02:34:57.260
way up, but like it's dark, dark in these, like just pitch black, you know, it it's pretty

02:34:57.260 --> 02:34:57.980
cool.

02:34:57.980 --> 02:35:05.100
Um, I think it's a really neat addition if, you know, especially now my card is kind of

02:35:05.100 --> 02:35:10.140
like the bottom end of ray tracing, but as you know, a couple of years from now, when

02:35:10.220 --> 02:35:15.100
we're running all cards that have been doing ray tracing for a while, and as they add more,

02:35:15.100 --> 02:35:21.660
like, you know, that DLSS and stuff like that to it, it's going to really improve, um, the

02:35:21.660 --> 02:35:22.620
performance of it.

02:35:22.620 --> 02:35:25.260
And we'll see a lot more games start taking advantage of it.

02:35:25.260 --> 02:35:29.980
And I think this is definitely one that, because there's not much you can really do with Minecraft

02:35:29.980 --> 02:35:30.460
graphics.

02:35:30.460 --> 02:35:35.100
I mean, aside from upping the pixel count and stuff, but like ray tracing really makes

02:35:35.100 --> 02:35:35.740
a difference.

02:35:35.740 --> 02:35:37.100
So it's worthwhile.

02:35:37.980 --> 02:35:38.860
All right.

02:35:38.860 --> 02:35:41.900
Well, I hope I get to check it out in a series because I don't have a graphics card good

02:35:41.900 --> 02:35:44.620
enough on my PC and I don't see myself getting one for a while.

02:35:44.620 --> 02:35:47.980
Not just, not just the shortage problems, but just because I've been buying too much

02:35:47.980 --> 02:35:48.780
other shit.

02:35:48.780 --> 02:35:51.580
Uh, but, uh, yeah, let's check that out at some point.

02:35:51.580 --> 02:35:51.820
All right.

02:35:51.820 --> 02:35:53.260
Well, one more story for you guys.

02:35:53.260 --> 02:35:59.020
And that is about the PlayStation 5 controller now being available to use on Steam.

02:35:59.020 --> 02:36:02.300
And I think we talked about that, like this was coming or people were playing with this,

02:36:02.300 --> 02:36:05.900
but, uh, this is now available for all Steam gamers.

02:36:05.900 --> 02:36:08.220
I think it was like in a beta at some point or something.

02:36:08.620 --> 02:36:09.660
So this is pretty cool.

02:36:09.660 --> 02:36:15.340
Uh, it has full support on Steam for the led and the controller trackpad rumble, uh, gyro

02:36:15.340 --> 02:36:16.780
controls and so forth.

02:36:16.780 --> 02:36:21.260
You had to originally opt into the beta to use it, but now it is just, it is there.

02:36:21.260 --> 02:36:27.740
Uh, some games that support it on Steam, death stranding, no man's sky and horizon zero

02:36:27.740 --> 02:36:28.060
dawn.

02:36:28.060 --> 02:36:31.580
So interesting that those are all games that would, you know, use that stuff anyway through

02:36:31.580 --> 02:36:37.580
Sony, but, uh, neat still, uh, the controller of course will work with many other titles.

02:36:37.580 --> 02:36:42.220
It'll be interesting to see if, uh, folks decide to add features into their games.

02:36:42.220 --> 02:36:46.940
Uh, paging Aaron, can we get the light to go Brown every time you do a pixel poop?

02:36:46.940 --> 02:36:47.340
I don't know.

02:36:47.340 --> 02:36:47.660
Anyway.

02:36:47.660 --> 02:36:47.900
All right.

02:36:47.900 --> 02:36:48.940
It was worth a shot.

02:36:48.940 --> 02:36:49.660
All right.

02:36:49.660 --> 02:36:50.540
We don't have a place.

02:36:50.540 --> 02:36:51.980
There's no PlayStation 4.

02:36:51.980 --> 02:36:54.540
Oh, you mean like an on the five through steam.

02:36:54.540 --> 02:36:56.380
Yeah, that would be funny.

02:36:56.380 --> 02:37:00.220
Um, I don't, yeah, I don't know about that.

02:37:00.220 --> 02:37:00.380
Yeah.

02:37:00.380 --> 02:37:03.420
And I'm, I'm just teasing obviously, but that's kind of cool.

02:37:03.980 --> 02:37:04.220
All right.

02:37:04.300 --> 02:37:07.740
Surprised that they don't have the adaptive triggers though in there.

02:37:07.740 --> 02:37:11.820
Um, that's not, I guess that's a PlayStation 5 exclusive thing.

02:37:11.820 --> 02:37:12.140
Yeah.

02:37:12.140 --> 02:37:14.700
It might be something that's difficult to translate to PC too.

02:37:14.700 --> 02:37:15.580
I don't know.

02:37:15.580 --> 02:37:18.140
Someone will hack drivers for it and they'll have it.

02:37:18.140 --> 02:37:20.220
It's a matter of time, but it might not be very well done.

02:37:20.220 --> 02:37:24.540
I mean, that sounds really mean, but you know, it might not be as smooth as what you are

02:37:24.540 --> 02:37:25.740
used to on the PlayStation.

02:37:25.740 --> 02:37:26.540
It's not at first.

02:37:27.260 --> 02:37:28.380
So, all right.

02:37:28.380 --> 02:37:30.380
Uh, so we're going to go to listener round table.

02:37:30.380 --> 02:37:33.820
If you have any questions that you're dying to know the answers to, uh, try to get those

02:37:33.820 --> 02:37:37.340
in chat, um, because we're, we're running pretty long tonight here.

02:37:37.340 --> 02:37:40.780
So I don't have a lot, a lot of time, but, uh, I do want to check out on the mailbag

02:37:40.780 --> 02:37:43.340
dark soccer over at, oh, let's do it.

02:37:43.340 --> 02:37:46.700
Participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send your emails.

02:37:46.700 --> 02:37:47.900
And guess what?

02:37:47.900 --> 02:37:48.780
It's for me.

02:37:50.940 --> 02:37:52.060
It's from me.

02:37:52.060 --> 02:37:52.300
All right.

02:37:53.580 --> 02:37:55.740
Um, so are you going to share with the class?

02:37:56.620 --> 02:37:57.020
Maybe.

02:37:57.660 --> 02:37:59.580
What's in it for me anyway?

02:37:59.580 --> 02:38:00.060
Reaction.

02:38:00.060 --> 02:38:01.900
Hey, hey, O R.

02:38:01.900 --> 02:38:02.780
Hey, Jamie.

02:38:02.780 --> 02:38:03.180
Yay.

02:38:03.180 --> 02:38:03.420
Hi.

02:38:04.060 --> 02:38:07.980
I finally bought animal crossing about a month ago, but I haven't started it yet.

02:38:07.980 --> 02:38:09.980
I know you were basically obsessed.

02:38:09.980 --> 02:38:11.100
True facts.

02:38:11.100 --> 02:38:15.500
So I was hoping you could give me a super short and two point review to get me motivated

02:38:15.500 --> 02:38:16.860
to start playing.

02:38:16.860 --> 02:38:21.420
I don't really touch my switch too often, but I know I need to super short email, but

02:38:21.420 --> 02:38:21.980
there you go.

02:38:21.980 --> 02:38:22.940
Happy holidays.

02:38:22.940 --> 02:38:23.900
Frodo's wagons.

02:38:24.780 --> 02:38:25.280
Okay.

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:35.120
So my to the point review is, um, you take the untamed wilderness that is your Island

02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:36.480
and you make it your bitch.

02:38:38.400 --> 02:38:43.600
You build your town full of ingrates and you bribe them for their love.

02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:51.280
And then in return, once they adore you, they give you a picture of themselves and you play

02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:54.960
dress up and you fill your catalog.

02:38:54.960 --> 02:39:03.440
But mostly it's taking this really this untamed Island and making it into your own little

02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:07.600
personal paradise and then hitting Ed with a bug net.

02:39:08.800 --> 02:39:13.840
My quick review would be it's the escapism we all need in this year.

02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:18.640
Also, you bought it, so you might as well play it.

02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:26.080
Otherwise, you know what should motivate you is that I will send you my friend code.

02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:28.480
Oh, that's very nice with me.

02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:35.680
I will give you the hookup in DIY recipes because go over there and shake all our trees.

02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:36.800
She loves that.

02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:42.000
No, don't shake my trees because I get nuts from my trees and the acorns.

02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:44.960
Lately, I've been catching my snowflakes.

02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:50.240
Like a good girl and making little douchebag snowboys.

02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:51.920
Have you built a snowboy yet, Rob?

02:39:51.920 --> 02:39:53.920
I haven't touched the game since Labor Day.

02:39:55.600 --> 02:39:58.640
OK, so you make the little snowman thing, right?

02:39:59.200 --> 02:40:03.120
And if you don't make him like fantastic, he's a little shit to you.

02:40:04.240 --> 02:40:08.640
So I need to make a fantastic one, but it's just like, I don't know.

02:40:08.640 --> 02:40:13.600
It's really hard to put like a description on what makes it addictive and fun.

02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:15.920
It's just an escape is what it is.

02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:21.520
And it's going in and getting the stuff to build your house the way that you want it.

02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:24.640
And some people will do like, quote, a livable house.

02:40:24.640 --> 02:40:25.440
You know what I mean?

02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:27.920
Like a living room and all this shit, right?

02:40:27.920 --> 02:40:29.040
Like I have a kitchen.

02:40:29.040 --> 02:40:30.960
I used to have a bathroom, but I got rid of it

02:40:32.480 --> 02:40:35.280
because, you know, in Animal Crossing, everyone pees in the woods.

02:40:35.280 --> 02:40:43.200
So but the but like I have an alt and I made her house into like there's a tea room room.

02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:49.280
In the basement, I have a cafe and it's just.

02:40:50.560 --> 02:40:53.920
It's just really fun, you know, and you get to play with me,

02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:57.760
I'm going to try to get you my friend code and I will respond back to the email with it.

02:40:58.320 --> 02:40:58.800
All right.

02:40:58.800 --> 02:40:59.920
Well, thank you for the email.

02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:03.040
If you'd like to send me my friend code, too bad.

02:41:03.040 --> 02:41:05.920
Now just message me at Dark Soccer on Twitter.

02:41:05.920 --> 02:41:10.560
If you'd like to send us an email, I almost said at Dark Soccer on Twitter,

02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:14.640
you can send us email participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:17.280
if you want to participate with the next Mailbag segment.

02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:20.080
We have a couple of quick questions from chat for the roundtable.

02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:20.800
Let me get to these.

02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:26.800
No one special 77 in our chat asks of all the games that came out this year

02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:30.240
or re-released this year and you got or played.

02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:33.280
Are there any that stick out for you that you really enjoyed?

02:41:34.720 --> 02:41:37.440
This is almost spoiling our game of the years, I think.

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:41.200
But I will continue with an answer that I've said several times

02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:43.680
and I think Hades is definitely up there.

02:41:44.320 --> 02:41:47.040
But honestly, for me, even though this is a years old game,

02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:49.440
I would continue to say Final Fantasy 14

02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:53.920
gives me that kind of escapism of doing stuff in a virtual world.

02:41:54.720 --> 02:41:57.760
And I loved Animal Crossing 2, of course, but I know Jamie's gonna say that.

02:41:58.640 --> 02:42:04.160
But Final Fantasy gave me that way to like kind of hang out with people in a virtual space

02:42:04.160 --> 02:42:06.400
when I can't hang out with people in a real space.

02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:09.920
And that was badly needed this year.

02:42:10.560 --> 02:42:13.280
So that's kind of why I say that even though that game is, you know,

02:42:13.280 --> 02:42:17.040
is one I've always talked about here on this show, but like, especially in 2020.

02:42:17.040 --> 02:42:18.800
Dark Sakura, do I need to ask?

02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:22.480
I'm not saying.

02:42:24.640 --> 02:42:27.120
Loki, how about you then?

02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:30.800
I don't know what I played this year.

02:42:30.800 --> 02:42:34.240
Like it was funny, like a couple of days ago, like I was like, oh yeah,

02:42:34.240 --> 02:42:36.320
that's definitely gonna be probably like my game of the year

02:42:36.400 --> 02:42:38.080
because it was before I played Cyberpunk.

02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:39.520
There was something that I was thinking of.

02:42:39.520 --> 02:42:42.080
Oh yeah, I played that and that was really good.

02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:44.880
I'm trying to think what that was and I can't remember anymore.

02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:50.480
I have to go back and look at what I played recently, but I know that.

02:42:51.680 --> 02:42:52.180
Go ahead.

02:42:52.800 --> 02:42:55.200
I know there's got to be some stuff out there

02:42:55.760 --> 02:42:59.440
that came out earlier in the year that I was really excited for.

02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:02.880
I don't know.

02:43:02.880 --> 02:43:04.720
I can't think of anything out of my head.

02:43:04.720 --> 02:43:05.920
Borderlands was all right.

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:09.120
A lot of games I've been losing myself in are older games.

02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:12.080
Like you guys know, I spent hours and hours on No Man's Sky.

02:43:12.080 --> 02:43:14.240
I finally got to the point where I kind of stopped that

02:43:14.240 --> 02:43:17.120
because I got distracted with other games, but I love that.

02:43:17.120 --> 02:43:18.480
That's an older game.

02:43:18.480 --> 02:43:22.080
Now Dragon Quest XI, I've sunk like 20 hours in the past couple weeks into that.

02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:23.840
So, you know, that's an older game,

02:43:23.840 --> 02:43:27.520
even if it did just get the definitive edition on Xbox for the first time.

02:43:27.520 --> 02:43:31.520
So I feel like this has almost been a year of discovering old stuff in a way.

02:43:32.560 --> 02:43:35.600
But when I really sit down and look at a calendar of everything that's come out this year,

02:43:35.840 --> 02:43:38.960
I'm sure I'm going to have some strong contenders for game of the year.

02:43:38.960 --> 02:43:40.240
And don't just assume it's Hades.

02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:44.240
I haven't really sat down and weighed like what did come out in January, February, March,

02:43:44.240 --> 02:43:46.960
because there was a lot of good stuff that came out right before the pandemic too.

02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:48.000
All right.

02:43:50.400 --> 02:43:52.240
Another question real quick here from actdeft.

02:43:53.040 --> 02:43:57.280
What's a game that was featured or nominated in the game awards that you want to play but haven't?

02:43:59.040 --> 02:44:02.880
A game that was nominated or featured in the game awards that you want to play but haven't?

02:44:02.880 --> 02:44:03.760
The New Mass Effect?

02:44:04.720 --> 02:44:06.960
Yeah, Dragon Age.

02:44:06.960 --> 02:44:10.800
I think maybe talking about the actual nominated games.

02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:15.360
I have Hades and haven't touched it yet.

02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:16.740
Okay.

02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:18.080
I want to play it.

02:44:21.680 --> 02:44:22.180
Maybe...

02:44:26.640 --> 02:44:30.560
I'm gravitating to saying The Last of Us Part II just to see what all the Hubba Balloo is about,

02:44:30.640 --> 02:44:34.160
but I just I'm not really a zombie person,

02:44:34.160 --> 02:44:37.600
but I guess the accessibility options might make some of that more bearable.

02:44:37.600 --> 02:44:38.640
Oh, maybe the...

02:44:38.640 --> 02:44:40.720
It's not really zombie zombies, you know?

02:44:40.720 --> 02:44:43.120
Yeah, I know it's different.

02:44:44.880 --> 02:44:46.640
I mean, I'm playing through the first Last of Us now,

02:44:46.640 --> 02:44:48.800
and you do fight like regular people a lot.

02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:51.440
I think I'll steal an answer from chat though,

02:44:51.440 --> 02:44:54.720
because this game was hyped last year and I didn't get around to it.

02:44:54.720 --> 02:44:55.760
Disco Elysium.

02:44:55.760 --> 02:44:57.680
I still really need to get around to and play,

02:44:57.680 --> 02:45:00.320
and they did announce that Definitive Edition is coming out.

02:45:00.320 --> 02:45:03.120
So that would probably be on my list.

02:45:04.480 --> 02:45:04.980
Loki?

02:45:08.960 --> 02:45:16.480
I can't really think of anything that they announce that I'd be like super enthusiastic.

02:45:16.480 --> 02:45:18.160
I mean, the Evil Dead game, I guess.

02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:22.480
As far as like stuff that's nominated for awards.

02:45:26.640 --> 02:45:29.600
Yeah, I can't really think of anything that I...

02:45:29.600 --> 02:45:31.520
I mean, Hades, everyone keeps talking about it.

02:45:31.520 --> 02:45:32.800
I guess that would be interesting.

02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:34.880
Do I have that?

02:45:34.880 --> 02:45:37.120
I want to see I have that on the Epic Store,

02:45:37.120 --> 02:45:39.680
but maybe I don't remember.

02:45:40.960 --> 02:45:42.880
There's a lot of stuff in my library that I don't remember.

02:45:46.160 --> 02:45:48.320
I think that was out when the store launched,

02:45:48.320 --> 02:45:50.240
but I don't know if they gave that out for free.

02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:54.560
Nope, don't have that.

02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:59.440
SG100Matt asks one more question here.

02:46:00.080 --> 02:46:04.400
What game from your lifetimes reminds you the most about the holidays?

02:46:04.400 --> 02:46:07.280
Like the game that you got over the holidays as a kid

02:46:07.280 --> 02:46:09.760
that you played the hell out of that gives you fond memories.

02:46:10.960 --> 02:46:13.520
For me, it was more a game that I rented,

02:46:13.520 --> 02:46:16.640
but I always associate this around like the new,

02:46:16.640 --> 02:46:19.360
that little break between Christmas and New Year's.

02:46:19.360 --> 02:46:20.720
Super Mario Brothers 2.

02:46:21.600 --> 02:46:23.920
That's right, going all the way back to the NES

02:46:23.920 --> 02:46:24.960
and Mario Brothers 2.

02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:28.000
And when I rented that game and I stayed up all night playing it

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.160
and it was off from school for a little bit

02:46:30.160 --> 02:46:32.160
and that was like my winter break was that game.

02:46:32.160 --> 02:46:34.080
So that's my easy answer.

02:46:34.080 --> 02:46:35.120
How about you guys?

02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:35.760
Darcyra?

02:46:36.720 --> 02:46:41.520
I played so much Legend of Zelda Link to the Past

02:46:41.520 --> 02:46:43.440
and keep in mind it was supposed to be for my brothers,

02:46:43.440 --> 02:46:44.880
but screw them, it was my game.

02:46:46.240 --> 02:46:49.840
So I would put that one definitely up there

02:46:49.840 --> 02:46:52.960
as one of the big holiday things that I remember.

02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:54.160
And Loki?

02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:58.480
I don't remember any games I've got for Christmas.

02:46:59.120 --> 02:47:02.160
So I really don't have anything.

02:47:02.160 --> 02:47:05.440
I can't think of any that I purchased

02:47:05.440 --> 02:47:08.320
or that would have been given to me.

02:47:09.440 --> 02:47:10.480
So I don't know.

02:47:11.040 --> 02:47:12.560
All right, all right.

02:47:12.560 --> 02:47:14.880
Well, I think that's going to be our last question for the night

02:47:14.880 --> 02:47:17.200
because we've got to get to wrapping things up.

02:47:17.200 --> 02:47:19.520
I will check in though with Loki real quick or Dark Soccer

02:47:19.520 --> 02:47:20.880
and see if there's any last minute stories.

02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:25.200
I didn't check for any.

02:47:25.200 --> 02:47:28.960
I don't think we had anything kind of breaking.

02:47:29.680 --> 02:47:32.720
Yeah, I think we're getting to closing time.

02:47:32.720 --> 02:47:34.080
It's about midnight on the East Coast

02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:35.120
and nine o'clock on the West Coast.

02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:36.400
So go ahead though with your thoughts.

02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:42.640
I am planning on doing a test stream to play Hivebent 2.

02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:45.760
Homestuck Hivebent 2.

02:47:45.760 --> 02:47:46.640
Oh, okay.

02:47:47.280 --> 02:47:52.640
So look at my Twitter for when I'm going to do that

02:47:52.640 --> 02:47:55.680
because it really all just depends on how I feel.

02:47:57.520 --> 02:48:01.600
But I'm sensitively thinking that I might do it this Wednesday, actually.

02:48:02.320 --> 02:48:05.680
So my channel, I forgot what my fucking channel is even named.

02:48:07.200 --> 02:48:10.640
It's a underscore olr.

02:48:10.640 --> 02:48:11.200
I think it is.

02:48:11.920 --> 02:48:12.320
Hold on.

02:48:12.320 --> 02:48:13.840
I'm just going to type to myself.

02:48:13.840 --> 02:48:14.320
You're fine.

02:48:15.120 --> 02:48:19.280
Yeah, DarkSakura underscore olr.

02:48:20.240 --> 02:48:23.760
FatNinjaDM talking about a holiday game says in chat,

02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:25.920
Fantasy Star for the Master System.

02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:30.240
I did pick up real recently and I haven't played them yet and I need to.

02:48:30.240 --> 02:48:34.800
But the Sega Ages collection was like on hell a sale on Nintendo Switch.

02:48:34.800 --> 02:48:38.640
And so I picked up Fantasy Star, Alex Kidd, and Fantasy Zone.

02:48:38.640 --> 02:48:40.880
So I have all those games on Switch waiting to play.

02:48:41.680 --> 02:48:43.280
You know I got Fantasy Zone right away.

02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:43.920
Oh, I know.

02:48:43.920 --> 02:48:45.360
And Dan got Outrun.

02:48:46.880 --> 02:48:49.200
Dan fucking loves Outrun.

02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:53.680
You know what I want, though, is I want like a different shooter pack.

02:48:54.880 --> 02:48:57.920
I don't even know if it might already be there, but I freaking want.

02:48:59.280 --> 02:49:00.160
Yeah, Bobby.

02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:03.760
Bobby says I got Outrun too, but I paid 500 bucks for it because you got an arcade one up.

02:49:05.680 --> 02:49:09.360
But I want like a classic shooter thing.

02:49:09.360 --> 02:49:17.840
Like, like maybe like the first Don Patch or Polestar Blazing Star.

02:49:17.840 --> 02:49:20.320
But I really, really, really, really want R-Type.

02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:21.440
Just like R-Type.

02:49:22.800 --> 02:49:25.760
That has like some of my favorite video game music ever.

02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:27.840
This freaking R-Type.

02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:28.400
Good times.

02:49:29.360 --> 02:49:31.840
All right, Loki, did you find anything?

02:49:32.880 --> 02:49:33.360
Nope.

02:49:33.360 --> 02:49:35.120
All right, that's fine.

02:49:35.120 --> 02:49:36.160
We probably need to wrap up.

02:49:36.160 --> 02:49:37.200
We've been running.

02:49:37.200 --> 02:49:38.320
We got a little late start tonight.

02:49:38.400 --> 02:49:40.800
So I think the runtime on the podcast is still under three hours.

02:49:40.800 --> 02:49:43.600
But it's now midnight on the East Coast, nine o'clock here.

02:49:43.600 --> 02:49:47.280
And we still have to wrap a few things up before bedtime.

02:49:47.280 --> 02:49:50.880
So thank you all, of course, for tuning into the show this week.

02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:52.480
Thank you so much for supporting the show.

02:49:52.480 --> 02:49:56.560
Whether you were here live or you listen on the podcast feed, we really appreciated it.

02:49:56.560 --> 02:50:00.320
If you like this show, you can help us out by spreading the word because we are the show

02:50:00.320 --> 02:50:01.520
where every gamer has a voice.

02:50:01.520 --> 02:50:05.760
But if the voices aren't here in studio to put out over the air, then how can we get them?

02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:07.520
So please tell a friend or two about the show.

02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:08.320
Help us spread the word.

02:50:08.320 --> 02:50:10.000
Where the mouth goes a long, long way.

02:50:11.600 --> 02:50:14.800
What else goes a long, long way is support via Twitch,

02:50:14.800 --> 02:50:17.120
the auto hosting and things you guys do on Twitch.

02:50:17.120 --> 02:50:18.160
That is awesome.

02:50:18.160 --> 02:50:19.360
Really appreciate that.

02:50:19.360 --> 02:50:23.680
And if you do feel like supporting the show in a financial way, might I point you to the

02:50:23.680 --> 02:50:26.160
VOG Network shop that just opened recently.

02:50:26.160 --> 02:50:28.720
There's a few items there you can pick up to support VOG Network,

02:50:28.720 --> 02:50:31.760
OLR and Bobby Black Wolf and other stuff to come soon.

02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:34.240
More designs hopefully in the coming months.

02:50:34.240 --> 02:50:38.000
But that's vognetwork.com slash shop.

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:39.120
I was getting to it.

02:50:39.120 --> 02:50:40.640
So check that out.

02:50:40.640 --> 02:50:43.600
So I'm going to repost in the chat room.

02:50:43.600 --> 02:50:44.100
Thank you.

02:50:45.120 --> 02:50:47.760
And I think that's really it.

02:50:47.760 --> 02:50:48.880
Otherwise, all I have to say.

02:50:48.880 --> 02:50:51.600
So let's say you don't even need the post in the chat room.

02:50:51.600 --> 02:50:55.440
If you scroll down the page a little bit, there's an actual little widget there that you can

02:50:56.400 --> 02:50:57.200
purchase stuff from.

02:50:57.200 --> 02:50:58.080
At least it is online.

02:50:58.800 --> 02:51:02.880
Oh, yeah, I think there is a widget right there on the VOG stream.

02:51:03.200 --> 02:51:06.400
Bobby's been playing with that shirt that I was requesting, Rob.

02:51:07.200 --> 02:51:08.320
I forget which one that was.

02:51:09.040 --> 02:51:12.320
The v-neck women's shirt with the VOG logo.

02:51:12.320 --> 02:51:14.160
You got to remind me when I'm sitting in front of a computer.

02:51:14.160 --> 02:51:14.880
And yes, I'll do it.

02:51:15.440 --> 02:51:17.040
Yes, we'll get it.

02:51:17.040 --> 02:51:18.640
I said more things come, didn't I?

02:51:18.640 --> 02:51:19.140
All right.

02:51:20.160 --> 02:51:21.280
Well, teaser then.

02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:23.200
And it's going to be in this shop because I want it.

02:51:23.840 --> 02:51:24.720
That's fine.

02:51:24.720 --> 02:51:26.560
You get your say.

02:51:27.280 --> 02:51:29.040
OK, let's wrap up.

02:51:29.040 --> 02:51:30.640
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:51:31.440 --> 02:51:33.040
Loki, your final thought tonight.

02:51:34.160 --> 02:51:36.640
My final thought is I'll be working more on my game this week.

02:51:38.880 --> 02:51:43.760
My final thought is thank you for all the kind words you guys have sent over the years.

02:51:44.400 --> 02:51:46.160
I really appreciate it.

02:51:46.160 --> 02:51:48.080
And we have such a good community here at OLR.

02:51:48.080 --> 02:51:48.880
I'm so thankful.

02:51:48.880 --> 02:51:50.640
And y'all make it worth it.

02:51:50.640 --> 02:51:57.200
And they're the fuel that keep this thing going on into almost episode 850, our 19th

02:51:57.200 --> 02:51:58.080
year coming up.

02:51:58.720 --> 02:52:01.520
I can't believe that 20 years is really in sight for this show.

02:52:01.520 --> 02:52:03.680
It's pretty crazy, but I love it.

02:52:04.720 --> 02:52:06.560
Dark soccer, last but not least, your final thought.

02:52:08.080 --> 02:52:10.160
It's been a month and I still miss Supernatural.

02:52:12.720 --> 02:52:13.520
All right.

02:52:13.520 --> 02:52:16.160
Well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:52:16.160 --> 02:52:17.200
Have a great week.

02:52:17.200 --> 02:52:18.400
Happy gaming.

02:52:18.400 --> 02:52:20.000
Catch up on your backlog.

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:20.560
Have fun.

02:52:21.120 --> 02:52:23.120
We'll see you next time here on the show in seven days.
