00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,560
This week on the 30 Second Homebrew Report, Nintendo adds two convenient means for data

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,160
access which hackers are no doubt already using to attempt data manipulation and security

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,160
bypasses.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,480
The two features, those being wireless QR code and web server based image and video

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,740
delivery and direct USB connections are pretty damn convenient so it benefits everyone except

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,400
Nintendo's own security team.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,240
That's all for this week's 30 Second Homebrew Report.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,400
Now it's time for Orange Lounge Radio with your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,240
Loki to talk more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,240
now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:44,680
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,520
every gamer has a voice.

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:53,960
It is another edition of Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 846 of our

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,160
show for this December the 8th of 2020.

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,920
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me tonight are my co-hosts, although the video seems

16
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,280
to be messing up which is strange but we'll get that fixed, say hello to DarkSakura or

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,280
Jamie Summers.

18
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,280
Hello.

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,280
Hi, how are you?

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,280
I'm alright.

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,280
Good.

22
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,280
It's been a day.

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:21,460
Yes, yes and now it's coming on over to the show here but that's alright because I'm having

24
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,180
massive video problems and we can't see you yet but we will get that fixed.

25
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,180
Really?

26
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,160
No, it's not your guys' fault, it's something weird on my side, I'm not sure what exactly

27
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,140
is going on but I will fix it.

28
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,980
Don't worry, mama will fix it but we missed you last week but I hope Dan had a great birthday.

29
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,760
He did.

30
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:48,880
We had a chocolate orange cake thanks to Becky and played some games and some pinball and

31
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,040
really just hung around and had cake, there was cake and it was not a lie, it was absolutely

32
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,040
delicious.

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,040
Nice.

34
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,160
So I just realized what is wrong and why it's not working on Discord and this is a little

35
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,720
bit of a vulnerability tonight so I have to do some fixing live on air here.

36
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,960
For some reason, we are all in the public chat tonight, not the private chat.

37
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,780
So anyone could join this show at any moment.

38
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:18,500
So I'm gonna ask my co-host to please switch to the other channel right now and that's

39
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:25,540
the joy of doing live radio but it also explains why all of a sudden my Discord was like, I

40
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,940
don't see this window because we were in the wrong chat room.

41
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,500
I wasn't paying attention, I just joined a chat that Jamie was in.

42
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
You're fine, it happens.

43
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,140
Yeah, I wasn't paying attention, I just joined a chat.

44
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,620
It's fine, it's kind of funny actually.

45
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,020
I know the whole, so we do tape live of course every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network,

46
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,500
twitch.tv slash vog network, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after

47
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,980
the Bobby Blackwell show and the chat is lighting up going, OMG, OMG, we missed our chance.

48
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,220
We could have jumped in there and taken over the show.

49
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,780
Orange Wright says accidental guest star.

50
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,380
Fifth Dream says we could have all been famous.

51
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,620
Bobby Blackwell says it's funny now that it worked out.

52
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,260
Bobby's pointing out he has special privileges but he will not be using them or he will find

53
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,300
the privileges revoked.

54
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,940
We'll go record on a different discord.

55
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,940
But anyway, no, I'm teasing.

56
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,500
Anyway, hi, so now we got all that taken care of.

57
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,300
That's part of the joy of taping live is that sometimes there's a little mess ups.

58
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,340
I actually kind of like that because that was a little clue that something was wrong

59
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,340
and it told us that, hey, we got to go to the other channel.

60
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,660
So it's interesting, human proof.

61
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,660
I love it.

62
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,980
All right, anyway, also joining us of course, Techmaster Loki.

63
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,340
How are you, Loki?

64
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,340
I'm doing good.

65
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,420
I'm overly full.

66
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:49,460
I made White Castle burgers, well, like homemade White Castle burgers, and I ate way too many

67
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,460
of them.

68
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,660
Now, here's kind of regretting it.

69
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,660
Here's the thing.

70
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,700
I finally tried White Castle for the first time because remember, this is one of those

71
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,860
things that doesn't exist in California, like Waffle House and countless other.

72
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,300
I was going to say Cracker Barrel, but that's not true anymore.

73
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,300
They finally built those here.

74
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,300
Steak and Shake.

75
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,380
They were here for like two minutes and then they were gone.

76
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,220
There's still one in LA.

77
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,220
Who is there?

78
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,220
Northern Northern.

79
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,220
Yeah.

80
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,220
Yeah, downtown LA.

81
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,100
There's a lot of stuff in the rest of the country we don't have in California.

82
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,420
So White Castle is one of them.

83
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,780
So I had it for the very first time when I was in Las Vegas, of all places, apparently

84
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,780
has one.

85
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,400
But Las Vegas is a great place for food.

86
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,300
And this was just like a year, no, it had been over a year ago because it was pre-COVID

87
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,300
and all this stuff.

88
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,340
Maybe it was last fall, last spring.

89
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,700
Whenever I went and saw the Gwen Stefani show, we went to White Castle for the first time.

90
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,540
I thought it was disgusting.

91
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,040
I thought it was disgusting.

92
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,220
I can't stand the way they cook the burgers there.

93
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,880
They're like steam cooked.

94
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,880
That is not the way.

95
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,620
I don't need wet, sloppy meat.

96
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,240
And no wonder only stoners like it.

97
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,640
It wasn't like that at all.

98
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,320
I was tempted.

99
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:01,760
The reason why I made them is because I bought last week these TGI Friday sliders and they

100
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
were just kind of eh.

101
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,100
They look like they're better than the White Castle ones.

102
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,040
I bought the Frozen White Castle ones before and they weren't very good.

103
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,600
They're all like soggy, like you said.

104
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,120
So I looked for a recipe while I was at the store today so that I could make some.

105
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,600
And I mean, it turned out really good.

106
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,040
It's just that I chopped up a whole large onion over the whole thing.

107
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,480
And so I like onions, my family, not so much.

108
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,760
And so it was a little too oniony for them.

109
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,960
I thought it was great though, but the next batch I make just won't have that layer of

110
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,960
onions on top.

111
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,520
I thought that's kind of what makes White Castle burgers anyways.

112
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,240
It might have been OK if it was cooked your way, like in an oven as opposed to steamed.

113
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,920
I think that was the part that turned me off the most.

114
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:52,620
I was like, and the chat is all yelling at me, telling me how wrong I am, y'all, whatever.

115
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,000
You know, here's the thing.

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,520
I'm glad that the California thing is in and out compared to that, because as overrated

117
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,520
as I think in and out is, it's like I would never wait 12 hours in a line or whatever

118
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,720
those people were doing in Colorado.

119
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,640
I agree with Bobby that Crystal is better than White Castle.

120
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
I will die on that hill.

121
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,640
I don't know if I've had Crystal.

122
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,420
I don't think I've had that.

123
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,400
Crystal is definitely more of a Southeastern kind of thing.

124
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,680
They're not doing that great financially, but you know, I grew up with Crystal and eating

125
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,880
corn pups and little tiny corn dogs and they had little tiny donuts too.

126
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,880
It was awesome.

127
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,880
It's just, you know, the best micro food.

128
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,940
That sounds like A&W a little bit.

129
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:40,220
Like if, well, I mean, almost all of them are combined with KFC now, but if you can

130
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,800
find an A&W standalone, there are some out there and that's the kind of stuff they have.

131
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,220
Did you know, fun fact, I didn't know this till recently, A&W started in Sacramento where

132
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,220
our show is based.

133
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,220
Did you know that?

134
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,220
I actually did know that.

135
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,220
Yeah.

136
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,220
No, I never knew that till recently.

137
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,220
I was like, oh, that's fun.

138
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,260
And I'll tell you where I was when I learned it.

139
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,100
In the mall that I worked at in Mobile, Alabama.

140
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,100
Yeah.

141
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,700
One of my friends was a manager there and she, you know, it was actually when I was

142
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,660
going to be moving out here, she's like, oh yeah, that's where the company started

143
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,660
at.

144
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,660
Really?

145
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,660
Yeah.

146
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,620
There's like even old ones out there and they're not in a mall.

147
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,620
What?

148
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:20,180
I think the most famous thing that was started in Sacramento, okay, and I'm in this mindset

149
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,180
today.

150
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,740
Yes, we are a video game show, but you know what tangents, they happen.

151
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,820
Well, sure.

152
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,220
There's that band.

153
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,780
But I was going to say, because there's a meme going around on Twitter right now that

154
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:36,980
is, um, describe how old you are with the name of a store.

155
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,060
And a lot of people are saying Montgomery wards, uh, Mervins.

156
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,020
I thought Alan's answer was perfect.

157
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,020
Gemco.

158
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,020
That's a great one.

159
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,020
Merchandise.

160
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,020
What's that?

161
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,020
Service merchandise.

162
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,020
Oh, I didn't even know that one.

163
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,020
It became best.

164
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,020
I think.

165
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,020
Oh, best.

166
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,020
Oh, that's another one.

167
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,100
Um, but I, my answer was Mervins and wine stocks.

168
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,900
My mom's two favorite stores.

169
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,020
Yeah.

170
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,020
That's a, that's a good one.

171
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,740
And wine stocks is another Sacramento thing.

172
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,940
But here's the answer that is being said, uh, that I caught that is a Sacramento icon

173
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,120
tower records was started in Sacramento.

174
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,740
That's why you have, um, down in the old, not an old town, downtown, you have the tower

175
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,740
theater.

176
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,740
Yeah.

177
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,740
The tower cafe.

178
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,740
That's all right there.

179
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,260
The tower records started in the back of the drug store that was there.

180
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,260
Technically not gone.

181
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,740
They still have tower records.

182
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,980
It's just an online site now.

183
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,980
Yeah.

184
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,220
And I think they have standalone still in other countries where it was kind of like

185
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,100
franchised out, but it is, it does not exist in the way that it used to here in the States

186
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,420
because obviously a lot changed with, uh, the record industry when everything went digital.

187
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,980
I think another way I could age myself is Virgin mega store on market street in San

188
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,220
Francisco.

189
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:51,500
That was, uh, like that was going, that was going to the Mormon temple for me.

190
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,500
Okay.

191
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,500
That was Salt Lake city.

192
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:01,980
That was the motherland gay first department store, which was more Southern.

193
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,980
All right.

194
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,980
Yeah.

195
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,300
Let's get into video games.

196
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,600
Let's talk about the kickoff topic for tonight.

197
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,740
We have a big event in games this week.

198
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,260
It's kind of like the, it's become the winter E3 over the years of sorts that game awards

199
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,320
are happening this week.

200
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,740
They're happening on Thursday.

201
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,660
Um, I just found out they're earlier than usual, so I may not be able to do it live.

202
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,900
It's four o'clock Pacific.

203
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,780
So it's seven o'clock Eastern, but that's to be a little more worldwide friendly, but

204
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,700
it sounds like it's even earlier than that.

205
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,820
It's says they have a pre-show starting at three 30 Pacific.

206
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,660
So that's when they're going to have five world premiers in there.

207
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:40,540
So five premiers during the pre-show during the pre-show plus a musical performance.

208
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,300
I have to plug this by the way, at the top of the show, because I think everybody is

209
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,760
aware dark soccer.

210
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,440
You may not be cause you weren't here last week cause of Dan's birthday.

211
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,440
But speaking of premiers, we have one for you on OLR tonight, dark soccer.

212
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,460
You actually do know, cause I told you before the show, but the X prize.

213
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:05,520
So so our pal YYR has sent an eight minute pixel poops direct that we're going to be

214
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,000
airing during the show tonight.

215
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,840
I only know that's what it's called.

216
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
I haven't seen it.

217
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,400
I promised YYR I would not watch it.

218
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,280
So I don't know if he's going to announce a pixel poops thing on steam.

219
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,600
That's my steamy poop.

220
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
That's my guess.

221
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Steamy poop.

222
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
That's my guess.

223
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,040
That's some cool steamy shit.

224
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,440
There may be something else to it.

225
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,440
I don't know.

226
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,160
So we're going to, we're going to find out live tonight.

227
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,080
We're going to do that after classic game of the week.

228
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:38,740
So, so how about that y'all the, the pre pre game awards pre-show here with our own reveal

229
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:43,280
coming up later in the show, we love YYR for sharing his goodness here, creator of the

230
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,040
fabulous game, super multitasking, if you haven't played that yet.

231
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,040
So we'll be doing that after classic game of the week, a little later in the show, that's

232
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,000
where we used to do video segments before I got lazy and stopped making them.

233
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So thank you.

234
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yeah.

235
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I remember that.

236
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah.

237
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,400
Did you know also next week is our two year anniversary of being on Twitch, give or take

238
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
nope.

239
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,000
I did not know that even though our show started back in 2002 and we were on, you know, shout

240
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,200
cast, which was got in a variety of ways.

241
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,960
Some people pulled it in through iTunes.

242
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,940
Some people pulled it in through win app or whatever.

243
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,100
The tune in app was really popular towards the end.

244
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,580
Even though we were on that for years and years, we made the move to Twitch two years

245
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,580
ago.

246
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:25,180
Well, for the second time we moved to Twitch because remember we were on Justin TV in those

247
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,980
years I lived in that house out in Rancho.

248
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,980
We use the garage.

249
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:33,080
I remember that we were on Justin for a little bit, but anyway, in its current form, we've

250
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,580
been on Twitch TV for two years coming up next week.

251
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,580
So pretty cool.

252
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,580
All right.

253
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,660
Anyhow, I'm sorry, Loki, we were supposed to talk about the game awards, but I had to

254
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,980
derail with our own announcement, but please tell us a little bit about what we're going

255
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,960
to be expecting on Thursday.

256
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,140
So we're going to get a pre-show that they're going to start at looks like three 30 Pacific

257
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:58,540
or six 30 Eastern with already within just the pre-show and it's going to have five world

258
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,780
premieres.

259
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,260
So we'll have to see what that means.

260
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,580
And then of course, during the show, I'm sure there'll be a lot more than that, but that's

261
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,580
kind of crazy.

262
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:12,420
So it's going to be hosted by Sydney Goodman for the pre-show.

263
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,380
And then during the actual show, we know that there's going to be an appearance by Reggie

264
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,660
Fils-Aime, who's going to be a presenter for the show as well.

265
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,860
I'm not sure what category he's presenting, but that'd be pretty interesting.

266
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:31,200
I think they've already let him do game of the year in the past, but maybe actually no,

267
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,260
maybe not because maybe there was a perceived Nintendo bias if he did that.

268
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,220
So maybe this will be the year he gets to do game of the year.

269
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,500
I honestly can't remember, but I could see where they might be afraid of a Nintendo bias

270
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
if they let him do game of the year previously.

271
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,660
So maybe he'll do it this year now that he is technically no longer in the game industry

272
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,660
at that level.

273
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,660
Yes.

274
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,660
I know there's GameStop board of directors.

275
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,660
That's a very different thing.

276
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,660
Yes.

277
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,060
And then, uh, apparently they're going to have a, one of those premieres that we're

278
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,400
going to see is the next dragon age.

279
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,380
They're going to have a special look, um, at the game wards, which I I'm assuming is

280
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,540
a little bit more substantial than they did during the end seven stuff.

281
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,140
I think that's when they were showing off all that.

282
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:13,420
So, so yeah, we'll, um, have to check it out.

283
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,700
It's just a few days away.

284
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,700
Yeah.

285
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,700
Very excited about that.

286
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:22,420
Um, any yesterday was unofficial dragon age day.

287
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,660
There was some crazy stuff though, but we'll get to that later in the show.

288
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,660
It's coming up.

289
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,660
Yeah.

290
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,740
When I say BioWare, there was some crazy shit that went down this week, but we will get

291
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,740
to it all in good time.

292
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,740
All in good time.

293
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,380
Um, but, uh, big announcements for game awards.

294
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,760
I mean, I I've been calling it kind of like winter E3 because, you know, Jeff's done a

295
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:46,460
really good job ever since he kind of took over what spike TV kind of had, um, that thing.

296
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,180
And he tried to really legitimize it.

297
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:52,380
And I would say, you know, we've, we've been critical of the process sometimes, but the

298
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:57,580
result where we're at now in the year 2020, or at least, you know, or I should say 2019,

299
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,620
the last one we've actually seen far better than any gaming award show we've really seen

300
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,620
to the present.

301
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,620
Jeff has really transformed the show in, in a great way.

302
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,260
And he's been getting some great game exclusives.

303
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:15,600
Let's not forget last year's game awards gave us the huge reveal of the name Xbox series

304
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,200
X and what it looked like and the actual reveal of that console, which people were not expecting

305
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,260
that early on.

306
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:30,580
That was a huge deal could, could we see the often rumored switch pro jump out at us?

307
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,580
This game awards.

308
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,340
I don't want to set expectations at an unreasonable level.

309
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,140
I'm just asking hypotheticals expect nothing.

310
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:42,060
And you'll always be pleasantly surprised, but any thought could, could Nintendo drop

311
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,620
a huge bombshell on that level?

312
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,620
Any thoughts?

313
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,620
Loki?

314
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,220
I mean, there could always be the new, uh, sure.

315
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,220
Why not?

316
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,580
Um, I don't know what huge announcements they would have.

317
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:01,340
I mean, maybe, I don't know, because maybe I'm trying to think of something like at the

318
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:07,220
caliber that they would probably do other than like a direct of their own, um, maybe

319
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:12,820
a new trailer for the super Mario 3d land or world that they're doing, how they're re-releasing

320
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,700
with some additional content, maybe we'll do something for that.

321
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,780
Maybe they'll put out a fifth Pikmin game.

322
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:24,820
Um, I could see, you know, Nintendo, I feel like has always been pretty good with the

323
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,820
game awards.

324
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,580
And, and Jeff always, you know, had a great relationship with Reggie Fils-Aime previously.

325
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,900
And I don't see why that hasn't continued with Doug Bowser at the helm now in America.

326
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:37,020
Um, you know, they, they did a real deep dive on Zelda Breath of the Wild when that was

327
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,020
still anticipated.

328
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,460
Um, maybe we might see some additional footage of Breath of the Wild 2.

329
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,020
It has been quite a while.

330
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,660
Um, I know we're not really expecting that until maybe next holiday, but that would be

331
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,060
quite a treat.

332
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:56,340
You know, I, what first party games do we know are happening that we've seen footage?

333
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,340
Okay.

334
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,620
There's the Mario 3d land.

335
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,380
So there's, which, which technically we've seen before because it's on Wii U, was on

336
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,380
Wii U.

337
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,700
What Nintendo games at this point do we know are happening and we've seen footage.

338
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,700
Okay.

339
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,500
Breath of the Wild 2 is one of them.

340
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,700
Metroid Prime 4 is not one of them.

341
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,700
We just know it's happening.

342
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,100
We have never seen footage.

343
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:22,780
Um, there's not a lot, so that's kind of why I'm like, Nintendo might use this opportunity

344
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:27,380
because yes, they could do their own direct, but this would give them the opportunity to

345
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,420
have a very big audience because you know, the game awards gets, you know, everywhere

346
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,900
and it would kind of relieve the pressure of needing to announce 20 different things

347
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,980
or 10, even 10 different things, five different things by just doing one big thing at the

348
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,980
game awards.

349
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,740
Um, that could be very interesting.

350
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,820
Maybe they will announce that there will be a tournament they're going to not cancel in

351
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,820
the future.

352
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,460
I couldn't resist.

353
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,460
Sorry.

354
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,460
It's, it's pretty fucked up.

355
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,420
We'll get into that later in the show.

356
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:57,620
Uh, I don't know.

357
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:03,420
Um, it would be a good idea for them to announce something because they have a different audience.

358
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:10,020
I think, you know, if you're trying to kind of sway people to come to the Nintendo platform,

359
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:14,600
you know, the Nintendo directs are good, but it's kind of like more like I'm already invested

360
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
in it.

361
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,740
And so I'm curious to what's coming out.

362
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:22,900
Not necessarily, you know, grabbing the attention of someone that might not be, you know, in

363
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,620
the Nintendo camp right now.

364
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,620
Yeah.

365
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:30,740
Um, in, I don't know, you just made an excellent case on why they should reveal the switch

366
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,740
pro this week.

367
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,500
Again, I want to be very cautious about where I set the bar for expectations.

368
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,840
I am completely would not be a good week to announce the switch pro right before Christmas.

369
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,340
Like not a good idea.

370
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,600
I think, um, the Xbox was fine.

371
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
We know.

372
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
Yeah.

373
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,860
But the, but the Xbox, they announced it, but like we knew it was coming already and

374
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,700
they announced, we all know the switch pros coming too.

375
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,700
Come on.

376
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,060
But it's not, it's not confirmed yet.

377
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:00,100
It's not like they were, you know, saying, Hey, we have this project, blah, blah, blah.

378
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,140
You know, project, what, you know, Waluigi's never going to be in smash.

379
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,120
Um, you know, they don't have something that they're teasing, but then they're like, okay,

380
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,900
and here's what we're calling this console.

381
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,220
We've already told you kind of that it's coming.

382
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,460
They haven't said that they've denied that it's coming so far.

383
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,940
Um, I don't think we'll get an announcement for that until after Christmas, after the

384
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,780
holiday, because they don't want to cut into their sales immediately.

385
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:29,300
Oh, it's like, Oh yeah, I want to buy the switch for my kids and I've got it all wrapped.

386
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,300
It's under the tree.

387
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,660
Oh, Hey daddy, guess what?

388
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,260
Switch pros coming out.

389
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,180
Uh, yo, fuck Santa.

390
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,180
Okay.

391
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,180
No.

392
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,300
Like you very much.

393
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,300
All right.

394
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,380
You made a good case and then you immediately took that case away.

395
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,380
Good job.

396
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:49,940
Um, it's just like Nintendo tournament and Nike.

397
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,940
Okay.

398
00:18:50,940 --> 00:19:00,900
Uh, but I, I like the idea of Nintendo using the opportunity to show something to an audience

399
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,660
they don't normally get.

400
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,260
I like that idea.

401
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,300
So show a game that might appeal to a very, very broad audiences.

402
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,300
It'd be interesting.

403
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,300
It'd be interesting to see that.

404
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,140
So they'll just announce that games pass is coming to the switch and we'll all be like,

405
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,740
Oh, you want to, Oh my God.

406
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,180
Wouldn't that be a mic drop?

407
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,180
Holy come.

408
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,180
Oh my God.

409
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,420
I can't even imagine.

410
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,060
Like, I re like they're, they're speculating.

411
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,980
And then there's living in that world where game pass is coming to the switch.

412
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,060
I just, that's a stretch.

413
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:34,180
Like there's a lot of reasons why I think it would work, but there's also like a lot

414
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:38,220
of things where I'm like, I don't know if that would really happen, but we'll see.

415
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,220
We'll see.

416
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,220
All right.

417
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,380
Um, anyhow, so we'll see the game awards scheduled to happen on Thursday.

418
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,940
We will be co-streaming the event because Jeff is all about getting us, you know, many

419
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,860
people to stream it as possible.

420
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,300
So you are allowed to kind of co-stream it with your own commentary.

421
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:59,040
So we are going to do that Thursday night, uh, Bobby Black Wolf will be here for sure.

422
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,300
Some combination of Loki and I will be here, maybe dark soccer if she's not working.

423
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,300
I don't know.

424
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,100
Uh, but that will all be Thursday night, uh, right here at VOG network.

425
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,700
And we try, we try to do our commentary in a, in a, in a tasteful way.

426
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,340
We're not going to crap on everything we see, right?

427
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,340
Loki.

428
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,620
We're not going to crap on everything we see.

429
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,420
I would hope that it doesn't require that for the record.

430
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,020
I, I work until eight 30, so, ah, all right.

431
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,020
So no, no dark soccer.

432
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,580
So, so Loki and I like paying my bills.

433
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,580
That's fair.

434
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,580
Fair.

435
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,300
Um, now, Ooh, good point in our chat.

436
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,800
Y Y R says they did tease big game pass news this month.

437
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
That's right.

438
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,140
Wasn't that, wasn't that control though, coming to the game?

439
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,540
No, there's been a tweet after that.

440
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,740
That was like, Oh yeah, we're just getting started.

441
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,220
And I think it even said something about the game awards.

442
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:55,100
Like they're going to announce another, but like, in my opinion, they could leverage the

443
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:00,400
Bethesda thing to be like Skyrim Oblivion now on game pass.

444
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,760
And that would still qualify as a big game drop, even though those games are how old

445
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,640
at this point and how many people have played them.

446
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,480
But I think it would still make headlines for more of the Bethesda catalog to make its

447
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,740
way to game pass.

448
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,820
So, so like that's, that's, that's my realistic place to set the bar.

449
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,460
The Nintendo thing is living in fantasy land.

450
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,620
Let's be, let's be real, but weird things have happened in this industry.

451
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,620
So all right.

452
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,660
Um, okay.

453
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,560
So that'll be the game awards Thursday night.

454
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,980
Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games we've been playing

455
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,980
this week.

456
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,540
Maybe our games of the year, maybe not, uh, dark soccer, why don't we start with you?

457
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,700
How was your gaming week?

458
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:48,180
It was Animal Crossing-tastic and, um, uh, I've got Fire Emblem, the, the redone in English

459
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,180
Fire Emblem.

460
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,180
I haven't started it yet.

461
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,180
Yeah.

462
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,180
I forgot that came out.

463
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,180
Yeah.

464
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,180
Yeah.

465
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,180
I mean, it wasn't very expensive.

466
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,180
Um, yeah.

467
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:05,260
A little cuphead, um, uh, mostly it's just been, um, because of, uh, some goings on,

468
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,060
um, you know, and with Dan's birthday and some stuff.

469
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:12,860
So a lot of Animal Crossing, cause that's still, still my jam.

470
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:18,180
Still playing in my little virtual world because it's a lot better than the one that sucks.

471
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,180
All good.

472
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,660
So when I say, were you playing your game of the year?

473
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,260
The answer is yes, you were.

474
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,260
Yes, I was.

475
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:27,700
No, no, I'm, I'm, it's, it's game of the year for me.

476
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,700
Absolutely.

477
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,620
And on top of that though, um, I actually am thinking of getting Ring Fit considering

478
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,140
it.

479
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,420
It's because it's neat.

480
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,340
I have it, but I had a lot of problems.

481
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,740
I can't get that.

482
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,300
I can't get the strap on to, to stay on my leg.

483
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,500
It keeps slipping off.

484
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,780
Like, I don't know what I'm, let me borrow it.

485
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,700
Let me borrow that top.

486
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,700
Let me borrow that strap.

487
00:22:52,700 --> 00:23:01,260
I want to use it, but I mean, I've been, um, I, I might have mentioned this before.

488
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:07,340
I've been really putting a lot into, um, personal fitness and I weight train six days a week.

489
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:15,020
So I was looking for something fun that would supplement it either that, or I may be hooking

490
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,940
up to play, um, DDR again.

491
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,940
You should.

492
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,940
One of my home pads.

493
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,940
I miss DDR.

494
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,940
Yeah.

495
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,940
Or maybe Para Para, but that means I'd have to dig out the PS2 and everything, but look,

496
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:32,580
I have the gun show kind of, I still have, is it here in the studio somewhere?

497
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,180
You may or may not remember.

498
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:41,660
I have that unopened PlayStation 2 copy of like DDR extreme 2 that also has a dance mat.

499
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,740
So there's a brand new dance mat.

500
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,640
I don't even know where the hell that came from.

501
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,640
I can't remember.

502
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:52,380
Well, if people look behind me on cam, those that are here, we had to clean out our garage

503
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,260
because we put in a new floor and there's just like some of the stuff like, Oh, I forgot

504
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,260
I had that.

505
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,260
Oh, I forgot.

506
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,260
I had that too.

507
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,440
Oh, look, it's the Dreamcast dance pads, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

508
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,840
So out of curiosity, did you carpet your garage to give it that pinball arcade feel or no?

509
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,840
Oh, I thought you might've.

510
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,840
No, no, no.

511
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,280
Dan was, Dan was like, yeah, we're going to put up like a brick veneer or something on

512
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,880
the walls and, you know, make it look kind of like old school barcade ish.

513
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,480
And I'm like, no, if you want to look like an old school arcade, you have to carpet half

514
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,480
of the wall.

515
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,480
True.

516
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,480
True story.

517
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,480
True.

518
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:30,040
I, and this has actually happened to me twice in my life from wall carpet.

519
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:37,040
Once I got knocked over by some asshole at, at the time it was the old Aladdin's castle

520
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,780
right after my little brother had gotten hit by a car.

521
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:46,120
It was that same night that, um, that we beat teenage mutant turtles with a bunch of strangers

522
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,620
where they kept paying for me to play.

523
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,600
And then they shut down the game as we won.

524
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:56,600
Um, but I got pushed into the wall and got, um, rug burn on my gene clad legs that tore

525
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,040
through the jeans.

526
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,560
The only other time that happened was roller skating.

527
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,240
Why did some asshole push you into a wall?

528
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,240
Fuck those people.

529
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,840
He was just a big person that didn't notice, you know, little, and at the time I was shorter,

530
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,800
so it was like five foot one or something.

531
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,360
I'm five, three now.

532
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,360
So yeah, still, I mean, that's still, yeah.

533
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,780
Um, now though, someone pushes me up, push him right back, uh, going to our chat for

534
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:27,620
some comments on a dark soccer's gaming week, uh, SGA 100 Matt talking about ring fit, uh,

535
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,500
saying I used it a lot during the pandemic.

536
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,740
It's a hard workout and really fun to play.

537
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,120
I lost some weight playing it earlier in the year.

538
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,100
Then I gained some of it back by being lazy.

539
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,020
Uh, Misty OLR is cheering.

540
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,020
Yay.

541
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,940
Bring out the biscuits because, uh, Para Para, uh, the home version had those pink biscuits

542
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,060
or you could get that knockoff version for the dream cast where they were like that ugly

543
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,860
green that like, yeah, right.

544
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,580
Uh, bonds double six says, where's the, we dance pad.

545
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,940
Uh, there was one of those too, but that one's a little harder to find it.

546
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,860
I drew the line at the week.

547
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,860
Yeah.

548
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:04,340
Anyway, uh, no DVR party, no DVR party or Mario.

549
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:10,340
Uh, what was DVR with Mario or whatever it was, uh, SGA 100 Matt suggesting, uh, strap

550
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,740
it directly onto your leg and not on workout pants or shorts.

551
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,860
I do.

552
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,140
And I was like double looping and trying to like, make sure it was like super tight, like

553
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,380
cutting off and it was still would like slip off.

554
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,380
I don't know.

555
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,980
I don't know if I was just doing it wrong, whatever.

556
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,500
I think I probably have to do it a little more like above the knee.

557
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:32,060
So it kind of puts it in place, but I just, it didn't put it like on your calf or something.

558
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,060
Yeah.

559
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,380
That's how it measures you going up and down.

560
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,380
Okay.

561
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,380
Now that's kind of annoying.

562
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,380
Maybe, maybe I won't play that.

563
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,380
Try, try.

564
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,980
I, I'm the only one that seems to be having problems with it.

565
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,540
So, uh, I would say try it.

566
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,540
Yeah.

567
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,540
Okay.

568
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,540
Well, all right.

569
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,540
I'll find it somewhere.

570
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,540
So, all right.

571
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,540
Okay.

572
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,540
Uh, let's move on.

573
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,580
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

574
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,340
Um, I didn't play a whole ton today.

575
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,460
My kids got me to play a little bit of, uh, Minecraft.

576
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,940
So I did play that.

577
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:06,180
I was also fighting with Microsoft because they have me paying for my realm three times.

578
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:10,980
And so they keep saying, Oh, your, your subscription's about to run out, which is weird because it,

579
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,220
it's supposed to auto renew every month.

580
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,100
And then, so I like, okay, fine, just, you know, renew.

581
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,540
And then, so it starts a new one.

582
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:23,460
So I found out that there was three going concurrently, which it's just, it's all messed

583
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,460
up.

584
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,180
So I finally got those canceled and hopefully they won't come back, but this is the second

585
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,660
month I've had to do that.

586
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,460
Um, so it's kind of annoying.

587
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:34,660
Um, but we were able to play a little bit and so that was fun.

588
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,460
And mostly this week, like I said, it's just been working on my game and stuff.

589
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,100
So I'm still chugging along with that.

590
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:52,020
Um, I also did power up the series X to try to, um, uh, try to acquire certain apps to

591
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,060
play games.

592
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:59,940
And apparently there's a lot more steps that I need to do that I, I can't do because, um,

593
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:05,540
apparently Microsoft edge doesn't come preloaded on those systems anymore.

594
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:10,980
Kind of weird, but, um, cause I thought that the Xbox had a web browser, but apparently

595
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,100
it does on mine and I can't find it on mine.

596
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,620
So go all the way down to the pins.

597
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,620
Yeah.

598
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,620
That's weird.

599
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,620
Maybe I downloaded it in my apps.

600
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,620
Yeah.

601
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,620
It was down in the pins for me.

602
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,920
But did you get it?

603
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,900
Did you have it on Xbox one and now you have it?

604
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,620
Cause like I did have it on Xbox one, but it didn't just copy things over from my Xbox

605
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,620
one.

606
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,460
Maybe my Xbox one has been disconnected from the network.

607
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,460
Yeah.

608
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,460
We'll get into it.

609
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,460
We'll soon.

610
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,620
We'll get into it soon, but to get retro arch on there.

611
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:46,820
There is a way you can get to run on the retail one, the retail side, not in the dev mode,

612
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:52,820
which we're going to talk about, but, um, it's a workaround that one of the developers

613
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,820
has to there.

614
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,800
They have to push something out and you have to download it through the browser is so they're

615
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,740
trying to block it or Microsoft will be blocking it soon.

616
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,980
So I'm trying to get past that before they do that.

617
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:08,220
Uh, Bobby is saying you do have to download the app and YYR is suggesting I might've pinned

618
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,460
it on Xbox one.

619
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:13,660
Maybe I don't remember doing that, but I might've, um, because I do remember, um, you could

620
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,980
listen to OLR, uh, before we were on Twitch.

621
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,860
Cause I I'd mentioned at the top of the show, the whole shout cast thing, you could actually

622
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,860
listen to it.

623
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,780
I think on Xbox one's browser, uh, I don't remember if that was that vog network.com

624
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,380
or if I had to use a different site to do it, but I remember doing that.

625
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:31,940
So maybe I tried searching in the apps because they have a search function to pull up apps

626
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,940
and stuff.

627
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,960
And I searched Microsoft edge, edge, whatever, nothing came up web browser.

628
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,560
So like, I, I can't access it, which I'm like, whatever at this point, it doesn't matter.

629
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,240
But like, I just thought I'd try it.

630
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,440
Maybe that's their weird workaround until they patched the issue is that you can't get

631
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,640
it right now unless you already had it, but that would be strange.

632
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,920
Maybe that'd be very strange.

633
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,920
That's a weird theory.

634
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,920
I know.

635
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,920
But all right.

636
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,920
Well, that's it for your gaming week.

637
00:29:54,920 --> 00:30:00,260
Loki then, uh, my gaming week, um, I've been, um, playing some of the similar things I've

638
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,120
been talking about in past weeks, Final Fantasy 14, we get a patch on Tuesdays.

639
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,600
That's really exciting to get some new content.

640
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,640
I'm excited about that.

641
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,640
New dungeon, new story.

642
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,640
That'll be cool.

643
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,800
Um, continuing to play Pokemon go.

644
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:16,000
Uh, they have that event that just the, the Kalos region, uh, six generation of Pokemon

645
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,400
X and Y, uh, those games just got their Pokemon and Pokemon got, well, some of actually only

646
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
a handful.

647
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:28,360
It's really the starters and a few other trashy mon, uh, and you know, that's about it that

648
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,680
they have right now.

649
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,200
And uh, for me, I'm finding it's very easy to find chess spin.

650
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,000
Like I could probably pull up the game and there'd be two on my house right now.

651
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Um, excuse me, Fennekin.

652
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,040
Uh, I, those they're around, they're not too bad to find.

653
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,040
Froakie?

654
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,040
Impossible.

655
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,960
Um, I had to use the radar.

656
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,640
I went downtown and would keep checking the phone to see if the radar showed the Froakie

657
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,880
shadow.

658
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,880
This was hilarious.

659
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,320
It was at an apartment complex.

660
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:03,360
I have to illegally park my car, jump out of the car, run over to where this fountain

661
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,120
was where the Froakie spawn, I don't know if it spawned because it recognized a pokey

662
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,860
stop called fountain or what, or if the pool there was enough water to cause the spawn.

663
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,900
I don't know.

664
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:17,560
But I get over there and there's fucking construction going on and it's all walled off.

665
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,560
There is no fountain.

666
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,860
It's just a bunch of construction.

667
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,440
So the pokey stop really shouldn't be there anymore.

668
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,320
But um, I, and I was like, I was, I was telling Shane, I was like on the phone with Shane

669
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,360
or texting him, telling him this entire experience as it was unfolding.

670
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,960
Um, and I was like, son of a bitch, there's fucking construction here.

671
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,560
And I just illegally parked my car and then the Froakie isn't fucking showing up cause

672
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:41,020
I was only able to see like the Eastern half of what was on the pokey stop.

673
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:46,800
I had to basically walk through the pool area like I live there and deserve to be there.

674
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:51,480
And that allowed me to get just enough to the West side that I got my Froakie.

675
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,320
And then after I went through all that, what happens during the quest line, a quest pops

676
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,600
up, catch a Froakie mother fucker.

677
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,680
I just caught a Froakie and now I don't have the radar anymore to help me.

678
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,200
So I had to go find a second Froakie.

679
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,700
And what worked for me, I went to, um, if you know the Sacramento area, you might know

680
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,700
the fish hatchery.

681
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,340
Look, you've got to know this over at Hazel, right?

682
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,960
So I was like, okay, water spawns.

683
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,520
Well, I was going to go to old town sack on Saturday, but then I heard the protesters

684
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,680
are at it again.

685
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,440
So I didn't want to touch that.

686
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,440
So I was like, where can I go?

687
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,440
That's not downtown.

688
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,440
So I was like, I'm going to go to the fish hatchery and I did, and it worked.

689
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,440
There was a Froakie there.

690
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,280
I had to walk all the way down the trail to the very last pokey stop, but there was a

691
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,280
Froakie there.

692
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,160
Uh, and so I was able to catch that for the quest.

693
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,680
So that made me very happy.

694
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:44,140
So, um, we're looking in chat for some of the comments as doing on her mat says I found

695
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,520
one in the past few days.

696
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:50,640
Oh, the interesting thing about finally catching that first Froakie, I get back in the car

697
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,940
and there's another shadow on my radar.

698
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,360
And I'm like, what's this?

699
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,540
And apparently it was a noi bat.

700
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:01,880
I might be saying that name wrong, but it's like the rarest of the new spawns.

701
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:07,220
And it was just over by the, um, the, the lady Gaga mirror whole downtown.

702
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,380
It's legit legit.

703
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,820
There's like, there's like all these murals cause of the wide open walls.

704
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:15,380
It's like a lady Gaga mural over by the Starbucks Starbucks, a golden one.

705
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,540
So it was there.

706
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,740
So fro, uh, the noi bat is a fan of lady Gaga apparently.

707
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:24,580
So anyway, Bobby Black Wolf says I get back in my car and the tow truck shows up.

708
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:30,060
Now, luckily I was, I was like, can I be in a white zone after six o'clock?

709
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,980
And it, as it turns out, no, you cannot.

710
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:36,340
I looked up the regulations later on, but I was like, I'll be back before the tow truck

711
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,580
gets here.

712
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:42,020
Um, so anyway, uh, that was, uh, my Pokemon go experience.

713
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,940
Now that lended itself to actually playing the mainline Pokemon games.

714
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:50,380
I talked a little bit about like playing Pokemon home and I've actually gotten into

715
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,820
that a little bit more.

716
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:58,100
Um, I loaded all of my Mon from sword and shield, uh, into the game from the Pokemon

717
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,220
let's go Pikachu.

718
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,220
I put them in there.

719
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:06,220
So I have my pokey decks in home up to about 230 or something like that, which is a shamefully

720
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:10,220
no low number when there's probably what, like 800, I think it's eight 98 altogether

721
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,220
right now.

722
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,780
Um, but it's a start for me.

723
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,940
So that's going to allow me to go back into sword and shield.

724
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:19,500
I've, I've actually been playing a shield and I caught maybe like 12 more things from

725
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,100
my decks the other day.

726
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:27,180
So it's been a slow process admittedly, but I just got obsessed with sorting my Pokemon

727
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:29,180
and organizing my Pokemon.

728
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,060
I made another spreadsheet.

729
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,640
Well, I take that back.

730
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:37,580
I stole what Shane was doing and I made a spreadsheet that worked for me from what he

731
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,580
started.

732
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,420
And, uh, and all of that to track all of my Pokemon in home.

733
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,820
So that was, that was kind of fun.

734
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,620
Um, so that was that.

735
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:51,820
The other big thing for my gaming week on Xbox game pass, uh, dragon quest 11, the echoes

736
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:55,420
of an elusive age, the definitive edition came out on Xbox.

737
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:58,660
It's the first time that the dragon quest game is out on an Xbox platform.

738
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,860
I didn't really realize that, but that is true.

739
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:06,160
Um, and this also came out, I believe on the PlayStation four, and these are versions of

740
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,300
a switch title that came out previously.

741
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,100
So the definitive edition was first out on the switch.

742
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:16,900
Um, and of course the game itself was out in what I think 2017 on the PlayStation four.

743
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:22,820
And if you're, if you were in Japan, the 3DS, um, so I played it a little bit on the PlayStation

744
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,540
four, but the game is very long and I didn't get far enough.

745
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:30,340
I got maybe 12 hours into it the first time and I've put in about the same amount of time

746
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:34,060
now on the Xbox version over the weekend, since, you know, there's nothing else to do

747
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,380
in the world right now, I am staying at home.

748
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,380
Thank you very much.

749
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,660
And so I'm playing, well, besides my walks, that's all I really do.

750
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:46,220
Um, and then, uh, I, I play dragon quest 11, so I'm, I'm back up almost to where I was

751
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,380
the first time I was through the game.

752
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,980
Um, I, I, I like it.

753
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,500
I think it's a great JRPG experience.

754
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:59,300
Um, some of my criticisms, the first time I played the game, I criticized the soundtrack

755
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,300
for the game.

756
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,700
Uh, they actually did change the soundtrack a little bit.

757
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:09,020
Um, they, instead of having the midi synthesized versions, which I don't know why they thought

758
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,180
that was a good decision.

759
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,340
I think they thought it would make, there's been a lot of strange decisions in dragon

760
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:20,340
quest 11, where they wanted to throw back to the original or be respectful to the original.

761
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,500
And um, that's cute, but it doesn't really work.

762
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:28,820
Like in the year 2017 or 2020, um, I like that it's an option.

763
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:33,160
Uh, you can do that, but you can go back to the synth stuff if you want, but now they

764
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:37,480
have some orchestrated versions that they do sound a whole lot better, but that leads

765
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,960
me to the other big problem with this game.

766
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,520
And that is that the soundtrack just isn't good.

767
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,360
Like the soundtrack's not good.

768
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,120
Um, and I know that's, that's weird to say about a game like dragon quest, cause you

769
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:56,920
think of like, Oh my God, the dragon quest has like iconic themes and iconic music.

770
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,920
Yeah.

771
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,400
That were written for the first dragon quest game, like 30 years ago.

772
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,520
It's now the 2010s, the 2020s even, because I say tens cause the game originally came

773
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,800
out in 2017, but, but we, we are way past that now.

774
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:18,160
And um, here's the thing, the composer, um, he's gotta be pushing what he's like 89 years

775
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,160
old now, I think.

776
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,160
So he was making a lot of this soundtrack when he was in his eighties.

777
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,700
And I don't want to be ageist or nothing.

778
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:28,320
Like I think it's great that he's still continuing to work in whatever and work on the games.

779
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:32,720
Um, even though he's had some weird stuff personally, but I'm really trying to just

780
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,360
like overlook that and, and look, focus on the game.

781
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,720
Um, and the reality is like, I don't know if they feel some type of onus to the guy

782
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:44,880
to like, let him continue to be the sole person that works on the series or if he has some

783
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:51,320
type of weird creative control over it, but, um, yo square, it's holding you back.

784
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:56,400
Like we're at the point where the soundtrack is holding the game back.

785
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,440
Um, so I really hope for Dragon Quest 12, you're thinking about mixing it up because

786
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:08,160
I'm telling you guys, the battle theme, the world theme, they get really old and really

787
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:14,640
stale because they are the only things you're hearing over and over and over and then recycled

788
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,660
town themes over and over.

789
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:22,280
So my fear is that the guy was only contracted to do so much work that does not fill out

790
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,200
a hundred hour game appropriately.

791
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:29,080
Um, sometimes you need to ask for help and I think the series needs help as it goes into

792
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,320
Dragon Quest 12.

793
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,080
Let the guy do the main theme and one or two other songs and let someone else come in and

794
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,740
fill out the rest of the soundtrack.

795
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,740
You know, look at what's happening with the Final Fantasy series.

796
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:42,800
You know, Nobuo Imatsu, I don't, I don't have a negative thing in my heart to say about

797
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,620
Nobuo Imatsu and he's done some great things, great music.

798
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:49,320
He stepped away from a lot of the music making for health reasons some time ago.

799
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,240
He still contributes tracks here and there, but for the most part, recent Final Fantasy

800
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,880
games, namely 14, have been filled out by other people.

801
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,820
And let me tell you, Soken and what he does for Final Fantasy 14 is phenomenal and he's

802
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,980
absolutely worthy of creating the music for the Final Fantasy series.

803
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:12,400
It doesn't lessen the value of what Uematsu has done or better or worse or anything like

804
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
that.

805
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,320
It's something that is able to exist and represent the brand still very well alongside what Uematsu

806
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,320
did.

807
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,800
Let someone do that for Dragon Quest.

808
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,680
It's time.

809
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:27,420
So I know I'm like going off on the soundtrack, but you guys, seriously, and I'm curious,

810
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:31,560
I haven't, I haven't really been reading the chat, sorry, I'm going to go back and read

811
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:38,520
some comments here in a minute, but like play the game yourself and tell me that like every

812
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:46,300
other facet of this JRPG is a superior JRPG, but then you find that there's this one element

813
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:51,260
that's like something just grates on me about this game and I don't know what it is.

814
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:54,020
And then you realize, oh, the music, it sucks.

815
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:58,940
I would, I would honestly rather listen to, to, to WAP as the background music and it

816
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,020
would be less repetitive.

817
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,460
That'd be funny.

818
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:09,420
I would honestly, so now the definitive version will allow you to mix in the Dragon Quest

819
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:13,660
8 soundtrack so you can actually play that in the overworld.

820
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:19,460
That says to me, Square knows it was getting thin and like you have to supplement it with

821
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,460
old music.

822
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,740
Hello, it's a problem.

823
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:26,820
Bobby Black Wolf says in chat, I'm an hour and a half in and I already am tired of the

824
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,820
battle music.

825
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,820
It doesn't change.

826
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:33,060
No, there's no boss music either that I've run into yet.

827
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,800
Quest Buster says, the thing is the Dragon Quest series is all about being traditional.

828
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,180
The fact that people love the series enough to make a DQ11 still as a hit, despite relying

829
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,700
on decades old tropes is a testament to that.

830
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,980
When you buy a Dragon Quest game, you have to kind of expect that.

831
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,860
Not saying the series can't grow, but right now that's pretty much the expectations of

832
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,660
what Dragon Quest is.

833
00:40:53,660 --> 00:41:02,080
In my opinion, and the remake kind of shows this, you can have all that exist alongside

834
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:07,260
something modern because like, you know, you have the retro mode in this game, which is

835
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:12,420
basically the 3DS 2D portion that is something you can play standalone.

836
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,300
I thought I would be super into it.

837
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,460
I don't like it.

838
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:19,820
It's missing stuff that the 3D version has, and I didn't like that.

839
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,100
I didn't like that there wasn't any voice acting whatsoever.

840
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:27,500
It was, it was, so it's there if you want it, and I found that I didn't really want

841
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,500
it.

842
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,020
So I, and I think something has to be done with the music as well.

843
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,740
So anyway.

844
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,740
Let's see.

845
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:40,620
SSJ100Matt says, kind of makes you want to mute the music and find some OC remixes that

846
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,700
are made by fans who care.

847
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,100
Oh, yup.

848
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,100
Let's see.

849
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,100
Other comments here.

850
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:51,620
SSJ100Matt says, I feel like this was an issue last game.

851
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:55,220
Well, we never even got 10 here, which is a whole nother issue.

852
00:41:55,220 --> 00:42:00,860
But yes, I believe nine was criticized for some similar things as well.

853
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:01,860
And then let's see.

854
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:06,860
YYR in chat says, I think the MIDI soundtrack was because the jerk music director insists

855
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,860
on it.

856
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:11,380
He's always done the music and it's always been MIDI across the initial releases.

857
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,940
Also, he is actually a jerk.

858
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,580
I have heard a lot of that as well.

859
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:18,780
And again, I'm really trying to separate that from my criticisms.

860
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:23,980
But all I'm saying is that those types of decisions that they feel beholden to some

861
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:29,980
sort of traditionalism, when they've allowed Final Fantasy to progress for better, 14 or

862
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:39,900
worse, 15, I don't understand why they feel they must hold it down to a certain standard.

863
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,260
Have that version of the game coexist alongside a modern version.

864
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:49,620
There's a lot of things about Dragon Quest XI that are very classic that I like.

865
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:54,220
The fact that it is relatively still a turn-based battle game, that they don't try to do a lot

866
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,980
of fancy active time battle stuff where you have to pull the trigger at a certain time

867
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:02,900
or do these, you know, push the directions.

868
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,220
You can even walk around the battlefield, but you don't really have to.

869
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,900
It doesn't really do anything.

870
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,900
I don't mind that.

871
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:15,300
Like that sort of traditional JRPG in that sense, I think a lot of people miss those

872
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,300
actually.

873
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,460
So none of that bothers me.

874
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,400
And the traditional sense of that, that's what I really like about the game.

875
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,700
So anyway, even though I sound like I'm very negative because I can't shut up about the

876
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,780
soundtrack, I do really enjoy Dragon Quest XI.

877
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,180
I really like the story.

878
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:33,300
I like some of the voice acting and some of the character development that goes with it

879
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,020
is fine.

880
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,140
The voice acting can be a little bit over the top, but I like what they do with some

881
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,140
of the characters.

882
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:42,120
Really funny, witty things.

883
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,980
There's this thing involving haikus.

884
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,780
I don't want to spoil it, but I found it, I'm like, this must have been the biggest

885
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,580
pain in the ass for the localization team.

886
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,660
And I thought it was very clever.

887
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:57,080
So there's a lot to love about the Dragon Quest XI remake.

888
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,680
And if you have Game Pass, download it, check it out.

889
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,660
Just have your Spotify ready to go.

890
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,380
All right.

891
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,380
That's my gaming week.

892
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,380
Phew.

893
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,380
All right.

894
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:11,100
By the way, before we get into tonight's gaming news, I will point out, if you would like

895
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,220
to have, for those of you that are watching live on Twitch, you might notice I'm wearing

896
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:20,340
a lovely blue VOG shirt with Jamie's VOG logo on the corner there.

897
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:23,780
If you would like to get a shirt, you can check it out over at the VOG Network shop,

898
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,780
vognetwork.com slash shop.

899
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:30,940
And we just recently added Loki's OLR pixel design.

900
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:34,860
We got a new shirt that's kind of like a baseball shirt with that on it.

901
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:37,780
So I'm curious to see how that turns out because you just bought one of those, right,

902
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,780
Loki?

903
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,780
I did.

904
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,780
I did last week.

905
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:41,780
Yeah.

906
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,780
Yeah.

907
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,780
So anyway, check that out.

908
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:44,780
Vognetwork.com slash shop.

909
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:45,940
Anyway, let's get into some gaming news.

910
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:49,060
Loki, you were kind of referring to this earlier, right?

911
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,060
Yes.

912
00:44:50,060 --> 00:45:00,780
So of course, being that the Xbox One and even now the Xbox Series X and Series S had

913
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:04,220
a universal window, a UWP app.

914
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:08,260
So basically these different apps that you could download and run.

915
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:15,820
So it could be anything from applications like Twitch or even like web browsers and

916
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,580
other stuff like that.

917
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:22,420
You can download different things onto the system.

918
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:27,300
You may have also forgotten that starting with the Xbox One, you could also turn your

919
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,060
console into a development platform.

920
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:34,860
So there's a way to actually put it in dev mode and be able to download things to this

921
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,140
and also develop games on it.

922
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:43,420
Well, one of the things that you can download is RetroArch and RetroArch, of course, being

923
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:48,260
a emulator platform for lots of different consoles.

924
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:54,180
And at the very least in dev mode, you can actually emulate quite a few games in this.

925
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:59,420
In fact, it even emulates PlayStation 2 titles a little bit.

926
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:08,380
There's some bugs there because the kernel is still a bit early, but it does emulate

927
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:12,860
stuff really well on many of the other platforms.

928
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:19,460
They also even have a dedicated PlayStation Portable emulator as well outside of RetroArch

929
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,260
that you can put on there.

930
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,340
Can I get OLRPSP.com on it?

931
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:25,980
I don't think that website's actually up anymore.

932
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:26,980
It's long gone.

933
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:27,980
Sorry.

934
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:28,980
I don't think so.

935
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:36,020
If you go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com slash PSP, I think it's still there.

936
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:37,060
I never got rid of it.

937
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,540
Our site hasn't changed in like 20 years.

938
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:40,540
So I...

939
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:41,540
Yes, it is still there.

940
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,260
So yeah, if you want to see, it's still there.

941
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,380
So it's just not, it doesn't have its own dedicated domain anymore.

942
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,380
That's all.

943
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,380
Yeah.

944
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:51,100
I don't think it's, uh, it's necessarily, yeah, it hasn't been updated.

945
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,900
Well, it still has the feeds in there because it takes our...

946
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,100
Yeah, it probably still pulls the RSS.

947
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,900
So it probably in that aspect is still up to date.

948
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,420
It's still up to date.

949
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,420
Yeah.

950
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,420
So you can do all that.

951
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:08,340
Um, yeah, I don't think it has the links to the, uh, radio app anymore.

952
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:12,980
We used to have like, I think you can download and you can like get a theme and stuff too.

953
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,820
The theme you did was pretty cool.

954
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:15,820
Yeah.

955
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:21,020
So, um, yeah, so that does still exist, but yeah, unfortunately, yeah, you can't access

956
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:25,740
the site through there anymore, but you can play, uh, emulator games now granted in order

957
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:30,340
to do that, you have to switch between retail and dev mode in order to kind of jump between

958
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,340
the two.

959
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:39,940
There is a workaround to put it, uh, RetroArch in, um, the actual, uh, retail mode, but it's

960
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,300
a little trickier to do that.

961
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:46,780
You actually had to, there's a, a form that you filled out that I guess one of the developers

962
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:52,640
has and he basically whitelists your console for that download and you download it through

963
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:58,560
Edge on the console and you kind of bypass their storefront to get it on there, which

964
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,320
I'm certain is going to be patched out soon.

965
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,760
So, um, that's just how that works right now.

966
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:11,040
But the dev mode version doesn't necessarily, um, isn't blocked.

967
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,440
Still do that, um, right now, and I'm not sure I, there is a little bit of, you know,

968
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,040
I think you have to switch back and forth between retail and dev if you want to play

969
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:25,920
your games, like your actual retail games and stuff, but not everyone can just jump

970
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:26,920
into dev.

971
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:27,920
Right.

972
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,480
You have to have some sort of license to do that.

973
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,480
Right.

974
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,520
Cause that was my understanding.

975
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,760
Cause there's a lot of paid for license, but it's, I think it's pretty inexpensive though.

976
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,800
There's a lot of headlines about this story right now that, you know, for clickbait reasons

977
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:44,080
are making it sound like you can play PlayStation two games on your Xbox.

978
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,760
And the reality is it's not really that easy.

979
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:52,280
It just kind of sounds like, okay, the Xbox series X is basically, as we know, you know,

980
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:57,000
a type of PC it's a, it's an optimized PC for gaming, right?

981
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
It's that kind of thing.

982
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Right.

983
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,400
Um, so it makes sense that certain things that were built to run on PCs like emulators

984
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:08,240
and yes, PlayStation two emulators exist on, on PC, you know what, PS three and four emulators

985
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,860
exist on PC as well.

986
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:13,120
Probably soon a PS five emulator just won't run very fast.

987
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,880
Um, somebody's probably already trying to develop one.

988
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,420
So all that stuff exists.

989
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:22,000
And I think it's just that, you know, by using this essentially what sounds like a sideloading

990
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,240
method is basically what it is, right?

991
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:29,680
You are able to run this emulator and then run the PlayStation games.

992
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,200
And I think people are kind of using this to take a cheap shot at Sony.

993
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,940
Well, I shouldn't say a cheap shot.

994
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:40,800
I think it's a worthy shot at Sony about how they drag their feet through the mud about

995
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,600
backwards compatibility when it comes to PlayStation, PlayStation two and PlayStation three, because

996
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,480
it does make an attention grabbing headline.

997
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:52,620
That's like, Hey, Xbox series X can play PlayStation two games, even though it's a lot more nuanced

998
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:53,620
than that headline.

999
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:57,760
That's my point is that it still needles Sony like, so what's your problem?

1000
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,760
Exactly.

1001
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,440
And the dev mode isn't necessarily so to, to get the dev mode, you have to pay a one

1002
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,440
time $19 fee.

1003
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,760
Um, so that's why, why are echoing some of this in chat?

1004
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,880
Cause he's developed for, let's not forget some of his games were released on what used

1005
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:18,200
to be like the XNA and the, the indie arcade and that, that stuff on the 360.

1006
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:23,960
So if there's lots of guides online to, to be able to do that, um, you know, I haven't

1007
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,720
necessarily mess with it enough yet to, um, check it out.

1008
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:28,720
It would be nice.

1009
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,080
It's kind of a nice added bonus, you know, having this console and stuff, being able

1010
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,960
to play, um, other games on it.

1011
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,840
I mean like, sure.

1012
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:41,700
It's not like officially sanctioned by Microsoft or something, but it's still a pretty cool

1013
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:42,720
thing to be able to do.

1014
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,500
And like what other cool stuff could you do with this console?

1015
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:49,780
I mean, I like that, but I get it.

1016
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:53,140
That's if they shut it down, then they shut it down.

1017
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:57,660
But right now it seems to be like, they're kind of not really addressing it yet, but

1018
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:03,180
if it becomes a problem, maybe if like, you know, Sony or Nintendo complaints, I'm kind

1019
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:08,540
of surprised somebody hasn't unleashed the beast with NES games and, and super new Tony

1020
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:12,220
is, but at the same time, it does retro arch plays all that.

1021
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:13,220
Okay.

1022
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:14,220
So, so then, okay.

1023
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:19,380
So then the headlines we're seeing about PlayStation two really is to needle Sony because they

1024
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,380
they're leaving the NES stuff out of it.

1025
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,340
Well, the PlayStation two let's play this way.

1026
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:26,500
The reason why they're, they're highlighting the PlayStation two, because that's a hard

1027
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,860
to emulate system.

1028
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:32,020
It is, it requires that whole emotion engine, powerful, you know?

1029
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:35,620
So it'll, it actually emulates GameCube very well.

1030
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:38,860
So you could actually run you know, GameCube games on there.

1031
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:44,060
You could run and you have zero GX or something like that, you know, lots of cool stuff.

1032
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:51,220
So it, yeah, they're highlighting the PlayStation two because it starts, it can run some of

1033
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,220
the games.

1034
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:57,060
They're not perfect yet because that core is still very new, but that's the thing about

1035
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:02,660
retro arch is unlike, you know, other emulators out there, this is kind of an all in one.

1036
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,740
So you get different cores that emulate different systems.

1037
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,740
And so it can do it all.

1038
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:11,480
And each of those cores is kind of independently developed.

1039
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:15,180
And so they're adding support for PlayStation two on there.

1040
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:18,980
And I got you because I was going to say that, you know, when it comes to emulating something

1041
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:24,060
like the NES or the Atari 2600, you could pull up a Microsoft edge browser and open

1042
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:27,140
up a tab and run like a web browser based emulator.

1043
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:31,260
That's going to be decent enough, decent enough where most people aren't going to be able

1044
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,260
to tell the difference.

1045
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,260
Right.

1046
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:34,380
So maybe.

1047
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,420
And so that does kind of lend itself to your point.

1048
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:40,000
It's the fact that it's the PlayStation two, which is a lot harder to emulate than these

1049
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,180
other things.

1050
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:45,260
And the fact that it's happening on a Microsoft box, no matter the, you know, sideloading

1051
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:50,860
dev mode and all that stuff aside when it's not like when Sony keeps resisting doing their

1052
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:55,260
own native emulation on their own box, this is interesting.

1053
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,260
So, yeah.

1054
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,260
All right.

1055
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:00,780
Well, I'd be curious to see if that's something you decide you're going to check out and get

1056
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,580
into this week.

1057
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:07,180
So what PlayStation two game are you looking forward to playing on Xbox?

1058
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:08,180
None of them.

1059
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,180
I'll be honest.

1060
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:16,340
The PlayStation two, like if I was going to pick any of those, I mean, like mania 2d x

1061
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:17,780
beat mania 2d x.

1062
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,780
Oh yeah.

1063
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:19,780
With the controller.

1064
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,780
That'd be just perfect.

1065
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,580
Couldn't I like map it somehow?

1066
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:23,580
I don't know.

1067
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:24,580
Yeah, maybe.

1068
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:29,980
I mean, um, and I mean, I don't remember if those controllers I used to play, you could

1069
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,620
play like five key with the controller.

1070
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,700
You can play a DJ max as a controller game.

1071
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:34,700
Yeah, you could do it.

1072
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:35,700
Yeah.

1073
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:36,700
Where are they?

1074
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:43,660
Like, do they have like, um, weren't the PlayStation two, um, beat me a controller's USB or they,

1075
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:46,500
um, place just the regular PlayStation two stuff.

1076
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,940
They were regular PlayStation two.

1077
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:52,420
If I recall correctly, you can probably get some type of USB device, but it would be like,

1078
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:55,100
I'm going to say there's probably an adapter out there for it.

1079
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,100
Yeah.

1080
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,700
I wouldn't be surprised at all if that was the case.

1081
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:58,700
So yeah.

1082
00:53:58,700 --> 00:53:59,700
All right.

1083
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:04,020
Um, and, uh, YYR says you don't want to play two DX on a game pad.

1084
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,980
It's just not two DX anymore.

1085
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:10,500
You know, I thought I would dislike DJ max for kind of reasons like that, but it's okay.

1086
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,780
Like I don't mind DJ max.

1087
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:16,620
So all right, well, let's move on to a story about destiny two.

1088
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:22,380
And um, this kind of has to do with how these games are upgrading to the next generation.

1089
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:30,660
Destiny two right now, uh, in the X-Box universe is not series X and S enhanced.

1090
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:33,420
This is important because the game is available on game pass.

1091
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:37,620
So if you have an X-Box series X or S you may have downloaded the game to just kind

1092
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:41,180
of, I almost did until I saw this story and I was like, wait, hold on.

1093
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:45,420
Um, and the long and the short of it is, is that there is a new version of destiny two

1094
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:50,860
coming out for not just X-Box X and S, uh, this week on December the eighth, but it's

1095
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:53,780
also coming for PlayStation five as well.

1096
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:59,000
And here's the thing, if you downloaded the old version of the game, too bad, you're going

1097
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,060
to have to download the new version of the game.

1098
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:05,540
Now there's a lot of that that kind of makes sense, you know, cause you got to get new

1099
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:10,460
assets and things of that nature, but it is this very interesting sort of like, Oh, we

1100
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:14,620
kind of thought with, with X-Box, you just could kind of like play the old games and

1101
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:16,460
they just kind of run with the new stuff.

1102
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,480
And to some extent that does work.

1103
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:24,280
Like again, I've been playing dragon quest 11, which it's very much like a PlayStation

1104
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:31,760
four or last gen era game, but it's so smooth, like 60 frames a second smooth.

1105
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:36,200
The loading time is, I can't believe I'm gonna say this, the loading time in dragon quest

1106
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,120
11 is too fast.

1107
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,120
It's too fast.

1108
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:44,060
And the reason why I say that is what they did in the original version was they had tips

1109
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,760
on the loading screen.

1110
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,900
And while the area was loading, you could read the tips.

1111
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,500
You don't have time to read the tips anymore.

1112
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:55,060
You can kind of see it, but it's too damn fast on the X-Box.

1113
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:58,500
So this is kind of, kind of interesting in that regard anyway.

1114
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:04,040
So for destiny to the next gen update on December 8th, which is technically the version 3.0.1

1115
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:09,640
update, you will have to download the game again on the X-Box series X or S and the PlayStation

1116
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,640
five.

1117
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,640
Why is this important?

1118
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,000
Well, some of you might have bandwidth concerns, right?

1119
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,460
I don't know how many of y'all got a new system last month and already almost hit your bandwidth

1120
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:19,680
cap for the month.

1121
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,060
So you might be rationing things out a little bit, which is why I'm glad I didn't get destiny

1122
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,120
two yet.

1123
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:29,680
This download will be about 70 gigs in the X-Box side of things, PlayStation side of

1124
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,720
things will be about 67 gigs.

1125
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:37,160
This is interesting because Bobby was kind of talking about on his show this week, the

1126
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:43,400
weird PlayStation four and PlayStation five stuff coexisting.

1127
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,460
And sometimes it doesn't make sense.

1128
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:50,780
Like let's say you put in your disc for no man's sky because you want to play the PlayStation

1129
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:52,720
five version of no man's sky.

1130
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,280
And that's how it verifies that you own the game still is by the disc.

1131
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,420
Well, guess what, when you put in the disc, it defaults to the PlayStation four version

1132
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:00,420
of no man's sky.

1133
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,720
So you have to switch it.

1134
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,360
Why you would want to default to that version?

1135
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,840
Maybe because the HDR bug's still there.

1136
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,840
I don't know.

1137
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,160
It still happens.

1138
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,720
And apparently he was talking about, he downloaded worms, which is the, uh, whatever version

1139
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,600
of it is the PlayStation plus game of the month right now.

1140
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:22,720
And it downloads both the PlayStation four and the PlayStation five version.

1141
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,320
I think it was, and he'll correct me in chat if I'm wrong.

1142
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:29,640
I think it was, he had to download the PlayStation four version first, then get the PlayStation

1143
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:30,640
five version.

1144
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:34,840
And it was like, okay, well, are these art assets for no, it doesn't, it's not pulling

1145
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,720
anything from the PlayStation four version.

1146
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:42,600
And in my opinion, well thought out, no, it's horribly thought out, which I know you're

1147
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,720
joking, but it's, it's borderline.

1148
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:51,800
I don't want to be too dramatic, but it's borderline disrespectful in this area, in

1149
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:58,340
this era, excuse me, of bandwidth caps, the destiny to thing, whatever we were warned,

1150
00:57:58,340 --> 00:57:59,520
we were cautioned.

1151
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,040
They did say the next gen version is coming.

1152
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,040
Okay.

1153
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,040
So I'm letting that slide.

1154
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:07,460
I'm just warning you, you know, wait until the eighth before you grab it.

1155
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:12,860
But in the case of this worms thing, when we live in this era of bandwidth caps, it's

1156
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:16,420
disrespectful for the systems to be doing this.

1157
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:19,280
It's not respecting the bandwidth caps that we have.

1158
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,920
This needs to be addressed immediately on Sony's end.

1159
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:29,200
And if anything like this is happening on Microsoft's end, I don't think it is to that

1160
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,200
same extent.

1161
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:36,340
Like I know with no man's sky, it's not, it's you, you just, you, you get the Xbox X and

1162
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:40,180
S version because that is the box you're playing it on.

1163
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:44,380
Anyway, I want to go to our chat room and see if we have any feedback on this particular

1164
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:46,300
story here.

1165
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:49,460
Bobby says it downloaded the PlayStation 4 version first.

1166
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,740
I canceled it.

1167
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:55,100
It added both to my queue and prioritize the PlayStation 4 download.

1168
00:58:55,100 --> 00:59:00,260
Dejirama S says Sony has always had shitty servers and network management.

1169
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:04,100
Fifth Dream says I'm used to like getting a drink or a handful of whatever I'm eating

1170
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:05,680
during loading times for some games.

1171
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,900
And now on PlayStation 5, I keep forgetting it's too fast to do that.

1172
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:15,020
Guys, yet again, yet again, I'll remind you, companies store DLC on your drive, even if

1173
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:16,500
you never purchase it.

1174
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,620
That's still a thing.

1175
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,060
And that is also bad.

1176
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:24,500
So I'm not saying the Xbox universe is completely devoid of this stuff.

1177
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:29,700
And we all know about the gigantic Call of Duty installs and things like that too.

1178
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:35,500
And I get it that part of this is, you know, the transforming to the new generation and

1179
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,620
all this stuff.

1180
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:41,540
But I have to needle Sony on this a little bit.

1181
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:47,100
Why the fuck is the PlayStation 4 version downloading to the PlayStation 5?

1182
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,940
Why?

1183
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:50,360
What is the benefit of that?

1184
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:55,420
Now if maybe I want to play that version, fine.

1185
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:57,100
Let somebody opt in.

1186
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:00,380
Press X to download the old version of the game and run it.

1187
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,220
Cool.

1188
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:03,020
At least I opted into it.

1189
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:09,340
Why are you bloating up my PlayStation 5 with an old version of the game I don't need?

1190
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:12,060
It doesn't make sense.

1191
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:20,220
So Sony needs to address this like now, in my opinion, because it's again in this era of

1192
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:25,220
bandwidth caps with all of our Zoom meetings and working from home and all this other stuff

1193
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:32,340
that takes up our bandwidth, to have bandwidth eaten up by games where it's not needed sucks.

1194
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:35,620
And I think all companies, now I know I'm picking on Sony a little bit here because

1195
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:40,020
I have the most egregious example right there, but I think all game companies should be looking

1196
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:46,040
at is there a way to make our installs smaller?

1197
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:49,620
For example, what Cyberpunk 2077 is coming soon, right?

1198
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:51,460
Isn't that this week too?

1199
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:52,460
The 10th?

1200
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:53,720
Same day as the Game Awards?

1201
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:57,480
I hear it has a day one patch of 60 gigs.

1202
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,600
All right.

1203
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,160
We all knew it was coming.

1204
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,960
I'm sure there's things in it.

1205
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,260
They pushed the game back for three weeks for a reason.

1206
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:07,560
They probably had to fix some things fine, whatever.

1207
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:12,420
Did it need to be 60 gigs?

1208
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:15,880
And I think a lot of devs need to ask themselves this question.

1209
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:19,320
We need to ask these questions of game devs.

1210
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:26,760
Again, I'm willing to let Cyberpunk slide a little bit because it is a very big triple

1211
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,360
A game and you would expect it's going to have a large footprint.

1212
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:37,120
You kind of know a lot of this going into it, but something like Worms, I don't think

1213
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:41,940
you expect that same type of, you know, extra four gig download of a PlayStation 4 version

1214
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:43,900
you're literally never going to play.

1215
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,520
So anyway.

1216
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:50,560
Or they should be able to handle it like PC installs where you can do, you know, just

1217
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:53,400
the express install where it installs everything.

1218
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:59,640
Or like, say, for example, I don't know how they necessarily do localization, like say

1219
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:03,800
if they had like recorded audio for other languages and stuff like that and say, I don't

1220
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:04,800
want.

1221
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:09,440
Yeah, I don't need the French audio soundtrack in this, you know, allow me to uncheck that

1222
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:12,480
option to save some space or in Call of Duty.

1223
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,480
I only, and they have this, I think, but like in Call of Duty, for example, like I only

1224
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,560
want the campaign.

1225
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:23,240
I don't want multiplayer or zombies, you know, I just want to download that section.

1226
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:28,920
And I think they need to chop it up with that or that way in order to be able to address

1227
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:33,460
these bandwidth gaps until we live in a perfect society that has no bandwidth gaps.

1228
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:38,200
So Bobby in our chat is calling out Forza Horizon on the Microsoft side as one of the

1229
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,200
games.

1230
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:42,440
And y'all know we love some Forza Horizon, but he is calling it out as one of the games

1231
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:47,760
that downloads extra data you don't need, saying Forza Horizon installs all the data

1232
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:53,000
for all the cars and the DLC in managed game is just the unlock key.

1233
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,160
If the DLC is only 10 megs in the managed data list, then it's just an unlock key and

1234
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,720
not actually any data.

1235
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,840
Now, and he goes on to clarify, and I think a lot of you guys are probably picking up

1236
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:08,040
on this, the car data, that makes sense because if your friend has the DLC and you don't,

1237
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:10,440
it's kind of like Mortal Kombat 11.

1238
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:13,880
Again, you're going to have all the characters in the game, because if you go online and

1239
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:17,960
play online, somebody else may be able to use a character that you don't have unlocked.

1240
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:18,960
Fine.

1241
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:24,120
So Forza Horizon has to do that for the cars, but do you need that entire Lego continent?

1242
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:27,960
Do you need all the art assets for Lego and all that if you haven't bought it?

1243
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:32,560
Well, yes, you make a good point, Loki, but you know what I'm asking here, right?

1244
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:35,360
If I haven't bought it, why is that downloading?

1245
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,280
Because I'm never going to be able to use it, right?

1246
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,920
So I think these are the questions that we need to in turn.

1247
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:45,640
So I want to be fair because I did, I kind of dragged Sony a little bit there.

1248
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,120
There's one that Microsoft can do better on, fine.

1249
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:52,320
And then Nintendo just honestly, you know, just needs to look at online in general.

1250
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:57,400
We got a whole other list of things they can work on.

1251
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:01,360
So there's things that they can be doing better there, especially in this era of bandwidth

1252
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:02,360
caps.

1253
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:06,400
So let's see, other comments here.

1254
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:10,560
DJ Rama SS, part of the reason why Xbox game patches are huge is because sometimes the

1255
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:14,440
game is already patched and it's bringing you the full game over again with the patched

1256
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:15,440
content.

1257
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,560
That, that isn't really a patch.

1258
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:20,880
That's a re-download and it should be called such.

1259
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:28,560
Anyway, so enough, I kind of went on a tangent from the original Destiny 2 story, but it's

1260
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:34,920
an important thing to call out in this era of the new generation of consoles, especially

1261
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:41,920
when on both fronts, they are really relying heavy on the library from the last generation

1262
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,480
to be moving these consoles forward.

1263
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,440
And these are some important questions to be asking on all sides.

1264
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:50,040
All right, let's move on to some news.

1265
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:54,680
I'm hoping we can all agree as a great thing, right Dark Sakura?

1266
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:55,680
In theory.

1267
01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:00,240
Um, but they have cast a Solid Snake in the Metal Gear Solid film adaption.

1268
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:04,360
Um, I'm sorry, adaptation, my, uh, my bad.

1269
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:13,080
Um, but, uh, they've, uh, cast, um, Oscar Isaac to play him, which I can, I can kind

1270
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,080
of see it.

1271
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:19,720
You know, I, I, I think I always think of Snake as someone just a little bit more square

1272
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:20,720
jaw.

1273
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:21,720
Does that make sense?

1274
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:26,760
Like I'm thinking like, you know, an eighties Kurt Russell, you know, but, but he'll do

1275
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:27,760
good.

1276
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:28,800
He'll do well.

1277
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:35,360
It's funny you say that when arguably Solid Snake was based off of Kurt Russell and Escape

1278
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,360
from New York.

1279
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,920
So it's kind of funny you say that.

1280
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:39,920
Yeah.

1281
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:44,000
And I wasn't even thinking about it when I said it and then I was like, oh shit.

1282
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Yeah.

1283
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:51,560
Um, you know, but, but that's sort of, you know, I, I, I, I'm going to wait for, you

1284
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,560
know, to reserve my judgment.

1285
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:54,560
He's a great actor.

1286
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:55,560
Don't get me wrong.

1287
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,560
I love Oscar Isaac.

1288
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:59,880
I have, I have like Poe is the best part of those new star Wars movies.

1289
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:05,920
I have two, I'm looking over here because I have two, uh, Disney infinity figures.

1290
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,920
I have a Tron one and I have Cora and I have Poe.

1291
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,100
That's it.

1292
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:16,520
So I, I, I may have a crush on Oscar Isaac, so I'm more than happy with his news.

1293
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:22,980
Well, um, I'm still going to reserve a little bit of judgment to see, um, you know, when

1294
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:23,980
it's out.

1295
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:31,100
And again, um, I'm so iffy about video game movies cause we've either had shit or we've

1296
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:33,780
had pretty good, you know?

1297
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:38,840
And so, um, I'm hoping that, I mean, cause Metal Gear Solid this year, uh, as a game

1298
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:42,820
series anyway, each of the games are so cinematic in and of themselves, even the very first

1299
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:43,820
one.

1300
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:53,500
Um, that it would be very difficult for them to fuck it up because the, the influences

1301
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:56,340
there, you know, scene blocking is there.

1302
01:06:56,340 --> 01:07:01,660
Um, I think it's going to be about how do they squeeze it down to two or two and a half

1303
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:05,280
hours or a movie size, you know, even if they let it go three hours, which is pretty long

1304
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,680
for a movie, Titanic size movie, I doubt it will be that long.

1305
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:09,680
How are they doing the whole thing?

1306
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:10,680
How are they going to do it?

1307
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,860
I think it's going to be the shadow Moses, um, story.

1308
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:13,860
Okay.

1309
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:18,500
I mean, the climbing of the ladder is going to be like 30 minutes as it is.

1310
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:24,140
Well, it's being written by Derek Connolly who wrote, uh, uh, the rise of Skywalker and

1311
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:28,220
a Jurassic world, which I haven't seen Jurassic world, but I really liked the rise of Skywalker.

1312
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:37,980
Um, and, uh, the, uh, director what Jurassic world's kind of, the first one, the first

1313
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:39,100
one is good.

1314
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,180
I have yet to see the second one.

1315
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:47,740
I hear it kind of, but, uh, I have, uh, rise of Skywalker is all right.

1316
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:50,740
No opinion.

1317
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:53,020
I thought the rise of Skywalker was, uh, outstanding.

1318
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:54,020
I loved all of them.

1319
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:59,700
Um, very, very strong, uh, female oriented movies.

1320
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:06,860
Um, but anyway, um, he, uh, we, we get, we get him as snake.

1321
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:10,100
Someone better yell snake at some point.

1322
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:14,480
Some comments from our chat over at twitch.tv slash a VOG network, DJ Rama S suggests regarding

1323
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,480
Kurt Russell.

1324
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,900
He could be old snake.

1325
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:20,020
You know, I hate to say it, but he is a little older at this point.

1326
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:23,680
He's playing Santa Claus in Netflix films.

1327
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,380
So maybe that's a good idea.

1328
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:28,900
Maybe an old, how would you feel about Caruso's old snake?

1329
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:31,740
I think as big boss, you mean?

1330
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:32,740
Yes.

1331
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:35,620
I mean, depending on the story and how much they reveal.

1332
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:36,620
Yes.

1333
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:43,220
I mean, I wouldn't mind him being big boss, but they, the thing is, is that he and Isaac

1334
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:47,020
look nothing alike.

1335
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:49,180
So I don't really see it.

1336
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:54,820
I mean, like their, their facial structure, like eye socket down to mouth shape.

1337
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:55,820
It's different.

1338
01:08:55,820 --> 01:09:01,300
So there would be no family resemblance, you know, because, well, spoiler, he's a clone.

1339
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:06,540
Um, you know, if you haven't played the game 50 years ago, Questbuster and chat says the

1340
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:09,460
Santa Claus role is also Russell's last role.

1341
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:10,460
He's retiring.

1342
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:11,780
Well, you know what?

1343
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,300
Rick Moran has said that too.

1344
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:17,220
And then he showed up in that, um, cell phone commercial with Ryan Reynolds.

1345
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:18,220
So anything's possible.

1346
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:19,220
No way.

1347
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:20,220
Rick Moran is retired.

1348
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:25,500
Oh no, I know why he did, but, but I don't think that that's a fair comparison.

1349
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:26,500
Okay.

1350
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,500
Fine, fine, fine.

1351
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:31,300
Um, but well, my point is never say never, you know, it's like wrestling retirement.

1352
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:32,300
Yeah.

1353
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,300
Okay.

1354
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:34,300
All right.

1355
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:38,420
So the undertaker finally did given, that's probably another plot.

1356
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:43,380
Um, no, actually I think it's just, he, he, he's probably tore up.

1357
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:49,900
So anyway, um, so now SGA does want to say about Oscar Isaac, uh, as shown her mat says

1358
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:52,740
Oscar Isaac is a huge fan of the series.

1359
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:56,340
Over a year ago, he asked in a press conference that he wants to play snake.

1360
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:58,860
So at least we're getting somebody that kind of knows what they're getting into.

1361
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:00,860
Um, so that's nice.

1362
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,660
I'm not arguing about him at all.

1363
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:06,380
It's just, you know, um, I really don't know this director.

1364
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:10,780
The only thing I said that that's listed on here is Kong skull Island, which I'll be honest,

1365
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:14,580
I don't even think I remember that movie existing.

1366
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:19,340
So that was like the King Kong movie that came out after the, uh, Lord of the rings

1367
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,260
director Peter Jackson's con movie, right?

1368
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:23,260
Yeah.

1369
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:24,260
Yeah.

1370
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:27,000
Cause that's the one that's the new Toho university and the one that they have the new, the two

1371
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,900
Godzilla movies and they're supposed to be the Godzilla and King Kong movie that's coming

1372
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:32,940
out.

1373
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:36,060
So that's kind of the prequel to those two or three.

1374
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:37,380
I never see movies.

1375
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:42,780
I mean, obviously it's 2020, so I can't see them in the theater anyway, but, uh, I was

1376
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:44,380
already bad at movies.

1377
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:52,020
I am way, I am way outside of the, uh, the whole kaiju movies these days.

1378
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:55,380
I have a lot to catch up on, although I'll be honest.

1379
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:59,100
Just recently I went back and watched probably one of my favorite of the Godzilla movies,

1380
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:03,900
which was, uh, Godzilla versus mecha Ghidra because it had the dude with CD player in

1381
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:04,900
his head.

1382
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:09,860
I do say though, like I haven't watched it yet, but the last, uh, Godzilla movie that

1383
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:12,460
they put out looked pretty amazing.

1384
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:17,220
Like I think if you do have to go, if you do want to watch one of those new, new universe,

1385
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:21,620
that last one that they put out looked absolutely incredible, but I, I still haven't watched

1386
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:22,620
it yet.

1387
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:25,460
So the chat is lighting up with some various commentary about the Kong skull Island and

1388
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:30,140
how it fits into universal's monster verse, uh, which was kind of like their answer to

1389
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:31,460
the Marvel cinematic universe.

1390
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:34,820
And I do remember, cause last time I was at universal studios, which was a few years ago

1391
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:39,060
at this point, they were already starting to like really promote like universal is the

1392
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:40,580
home of these classic monsters.

1393
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:43,900
And there's very certain ones that they're promoting that I think are in line with the

1394
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:44,900
monster verse.

1395
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:48,640
Cause wasn't that, um, I almost said Tim Curry reboot of the mummy.

1396
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:55,420
I wish the there's, there's, there's the Godzilla King Kong stuff.

1397
01:11:55,420 --> 01:12:01,700
That's its own thing, but the classic, the classic do with the invisible man, the reboot

1398
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:05,460
of the mummy that were not as great.

1399
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:08,940
Um, so there's those that's, that's like, I forgot what they call it.

1400
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:10,340
It's like something dark universe.

1401
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:14,980
I can't remember what it was called, but like it's, that's its own thing that they do, but

1402
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:15,980
my bad.

1403
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:20,700
No, I think that the King Kong Godzilla stuff way better than all of that.

1404
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:23,500
Um, the other stuff, God, terrible.

1405
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:24,900
All right.

1406
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:30,380
Well maybe the, um, uh, a solid snake movie, the metal gear movie will start off a Konami

1407
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:35,220
cinematic universe, the KCU, and we'll get a DDR movie.

1408
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:36,220
All right.

1409
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:37,220
Maybe not.

1410
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:41,020
Pachinko slots, the movie.

1411
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:42,020
Let's move on.

1412
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:43,020
Let's move on.

1413
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:44,020
Loki.

1414
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:45,020
What else do you have for us tonight?

1415
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:48,060
Uh, so we have some new updates to our consoles coming out.

1416
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:53,340
So Nintendo added some new features to the switch and then brand new firmware update.

1417
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:58,940
Uh, so the ability to now be able to take your screenshots that you make on the console

1418
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:03,980
and be able to transfer them to your phone or a PC.

1419
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,300
So that's pretty cool.

1420
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:10,340
Um, they use some sort of QR code system to be able to do that.

1421
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:16,380
And um, or you can use a via or a USB cable to transfer to your PC.

1422
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:19,100
So that's kind of, um, helpful.

1423
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:25,260
And then, um, along with that, they also added some more super Mario 30th, fifth anniversary

1424
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:31,460
profile icons, just to remind you that the game is going away at the end of March, allegedly.

1425
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:32,460
So we'll see.

1426
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:39,180
Um, and then of course on the Xbox side of things for the Xbox series, um, S and X and

1427
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:44,420
the original Xbox one, they had a new console updates that added some new dynamic background

1428
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:51,580
designs, including some that have, uh, kind of some older console looks to them.

1429
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:59,660
And then they also did, um, they added some more optimized for X and S series of our badges,

1430
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:04,020
which I think they have those already in the, uh, they did on games pass.

1431
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:08,500
I guess now this is for your library as well, uh, which is helpful.

1432
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:14,620
And I believe there's something also calling out HDR as well, um, which is nice.

1433
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:18,620
And then a new family member account set up stuff.

1434
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:22,820
And they're also going to have pre-installs for games that are coming soon on Xbox game

1435
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:23,820
pass.

1436
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:28,340
So if you want to, you know, preload those, you can, uh, for when those are coming out

1437
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:30,100
and then, yeah.

1438
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:35,220
So if you want to check it out, uh, it should be, I think coming out soon if it's not out

1439
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:36,220
already.

1440
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:40,980
Otherwise you can, uh, join the Xbox insider program to get access to those updates before

1441
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:43,700
they hit the retail side.

1442
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:47,980
I'm pretty sure it's out, um, on the Xbox side and then the, the Switch one is certainly

1443
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:52,660
out and, uh, it is, it is so convoluted to get pictures.

1444
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:53,660
I don't understand.

1445
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:55,660
Like I, I understand.

1446
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:59,940
And Bobby's explaining the tech side of it in the chat, um, saying the QR code gives

1447
01:14:59,940 --> 01:15:03,400
you the ability to connect to your Switch's wifi router.

1448
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,380
The first one is the SSID for the wifi.

1449
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:09,300
The second is the internal web server on the Switch to download the photos or videos.

1450
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:12,540
And I'm just kind of like, wow.

1451
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:17,180
For a company that really doesn't like to get their things hacked, they just blew open

1452
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:20,180
the goddamn door to hackers, didn't they?

1453
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:27,180
Here use this code to directly tap into your Switch's, like Loki, you know more about that

1454
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:33,940
stuff than I do, but using this convoluted method, haven't they just like blown open

1455
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:36,180
the door for hackers?

1456
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:42,220
Probably not because it's probably just accessing a small portion of the, uh, storage on the,

1457
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:43,340
the system itself.

1458
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:48,620
They probably have it split up to it kind of like an FTP server where you may have access

1459
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:50,100
to certain folders.

1460
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:52,100
I'm guessing that's what they're doing.

1461
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:53,100
Um, yeah.

1462
01:15:53,100 --> 01:16:00,640
Bobby says it's giving you access to a web server or webpage basically, but you know,

1463
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:05,600
or they could just have it break it and download it with like, plug it into a PC or something

1464
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:06,600
and just download it that way.

1465
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,800
Why does they got to make it super complicated?

1466
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:12,720
We have this Nintendo Switch app, why can't it just upload the pictures to the cloud or

1467
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:13,720
something like that?

1468
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:20,880
And I can download them through the Nintendo app that they have available already.

1469
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:25,200
Basically the way that Microsoft's doing it, but that would be so 2020 and that's not Nintendo.

1470
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,640
We got to work a couple of decades behind.

1471
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:29,200
Look, I'm glad it's there.

1472
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,680
It's going to make the sharing of the photos a lot easier.

1473
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:36,240
You know, all the animal crossing, you know, uh, shit posting that we all love to do.

1474
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:42,800
Um, but I, it just, it just feels so convoluted to scan two QR codes, but whatever, whatever.

1475
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:43,840
All right.

1476
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:49,980
Now Bobby does say you can also drag and drop to your PC via a USB cable on the Switch.

1477
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,600
They added that method too.

1478
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:57,720
Well that, that's a little more, you know, makes sense, but again, what else are they

1479
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:00,480
going to be able to do once you hook up your Switch via USB cable?

1480
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,960
I mean, yes, I know it's just a web server, but I don't know.

1481
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:08,860
I just, I just feel like these stories inevitably lead to, they got PlayStation two games running

1482
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:13,360
on the Switch, you know, it's just saying, all right.

1483
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,560
I'd never be able to run PlayStation two.

1484
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:16,560
That's true.

1485
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,560
That's true.

1486
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:18,560
All right.

1487
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:19,560
Shows you how much I know.

1488
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:20,560
All right.

1489
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,840
Let's move on to, uh, speaking of like, like doing things on the older consoles, this kind

1490
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:32,200
of came out of nowhere, uh, and it has to do with the classic RPG series Ys, not Ys,

1491
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:39,200
although that's what it looks like when you read the name, but Ys by Nihon, Ys, Ys, Ys,

1492
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,480
I said Ys, Ys.

1493
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:41,480
Okay.

1494
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:46,160
So that game, uh, by Nihon Falcom is, uh, doing something a little different.

1495
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:49,540
They're going to be porting the first and second game in the series.

1496
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:55,300
So Ys one and two are going to be ported to the sharp X 68,000.

1497
01:17:55,300 --> 01:18:00,580
Now dark, Sakurai probably talked about that machine on this show years ago in one of her,

1498
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:02,340
uh, did it for a classic console.

1499
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:03,340
Yeah.

1500
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:07,440
But I mean, all of our listeners may not have been here when that happened.

1501
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:12,700
So it's, uh, you know, a, a console that was only out in Japan in the eighties.

1502
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:13,700
You could think of the console.

1503
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:14,700
It was the computer.

1504
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:15,700
I'm sorry.

1505
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:16,700
Yeah.

1506
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:17,700
It was a home computer.

1507
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:18,700
You're right.

1508
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:25,700
When I was in train, I equate it to something like Commodore 64, TI 99 4a, um, Apple 2e.

1509
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:26,700
Those were kind of like the computers.

1510
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:27,700
Hell no.

1511
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:31,420
Well, but those, but those were the computers we had in the eighties.

1512
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:33,740
So this is kind of like what Japan had.

1513
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:34,740
Yeah.

1514
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:39,500
And it, it kind of blew the stuff that we had out of the water as far as what it could

1515
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:40,500
do for gaming.

1516
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:41,500
Yes.

1517
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:46,860
Um, I mean, there was also, uh, the FM towns, which also was, I'd say pretty, pretty good

1518
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:52,940
for, for gaming as well, but the sharp X 68,000 was the machine that pretty much ran arcade

1519
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:56,820
perfect versions of so many games.

1520
01:18:56,820 --> 01:19:02,180
And it's now kind of like this one Holy grail for collectors that, um, you know, if you

1521
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:07,620
can find a system that works and get the, you know, the, the games for it still, you

1522
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:09,940
know, still intact, you know, no discreet errors.

1523
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:14,660
Um, and on top of that, you know, you could switch like your music synthesizer for different

1524
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:15,660
games.

1525
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:22,420
You know, sound options, but the, the X 60,000 was like the shit is still kind of the shit.

1526
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:24,940
Some of the best versions of games are on that system.

1527
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:29,460
Well, and it's interesting now that here we are in 2020 or should I say 2021 when this

1528
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:34,700
actually comes out March 9th, 2021 that we have East one and two are going to be released

1529
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:39,940
for that console or sorry, I have it on this show, but that computer, uh, that came out

1530
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:46,220
in 1987 and it's going to come on 3.5 inch floppy disks like they should for that year.

1531
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:49,740
Uh, and you know, there's going to be a smooth in game scrolling.

1532
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:54,660
You don't have to swap in floppies to save your progress, but it's, it's a DMA and now

1533
01:19:54,660 --> 01:20:00,500
we hear about D makes a lot on this show, like, you know, halo 2,600, you know, the,

1534
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:03,380
the way I can play halo efficiently, you know, those types of things.

1535
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:07,740
We hear that, but those are almost always fan projects.

1536
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:11,780
The fact that this is like, uh, this is being done by Nihon Falcom.

1537
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:14,780
That's what makes this different, uh, and kind of interesting.

1538
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:18,540
Um, so anyhow, we do, I do want to clarify.

1539
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:23,940
There was a version of East one that came out in 1991, but they redid like with three

1540
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:26,840
pre-rendered, uh, 3d bosses.

1541
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:31,540
This is going to be the first time the East two has ever come out on the platform.

1542
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:35,860
Uh, and I think it's a, I think it's a different version of East one, but don't quote me on

1543
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:36,860
that.

1544
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:39,500
Do you want to get both?

1545
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,780
Just to say, um, one of the other things is a good number of games that I've done for

1546
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:47,620
classic game of the week, had some of their first home releases on the strip X, 68,000,

1547
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:54,720
uh, Galaga, 88, Emerald dragon, um, uh, uh, it even had like tons of fighting games.

1548
01:20:54,720 --> 01:21:01,540
So a lot of the SNK and Capcom just saying, Oh, well it's, it's, but it's, do you, um,

1549
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:07,940
Why, you know, no, I, I, that all makes sense, but, but why D make for this platform for

1550
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:08,940
$84?

1551
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:17,100
It still has such a big, big fan following and the people who have their, their, uh,

1552
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:21,620
their computers, they will play it regularly because again, these are some of the best

1553
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:23,620
versions of some of these games.

1554
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:29,740
Um, it actually doesn't really surprise me if there's a big enough audience for it.

1555
01:21:29,740 --> 01:21:33,980
They do a limited release at a high price point, even people are going to pay for it.

1556
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:37,500
I mean, some of those Dreamcast ones were still going true.

1557
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,680
We see that limited still doing Genesis games.

1558
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:43,700
And I feel like we have some story about what limited run games is doing like at least once

1559
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:44,860
a month on this show.

1560
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:51,700
So if not more often than that, we had one last week about that, um, the Ninja game on

1561
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:57,780
NES that was recently put in the, um, uh, no, uh, revenge of the Ninja was the Gameboy

1562
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:58,780
one.

1563
01:21:58,780 --> 01:21:59,780
It was a shadow.

1564
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:04,940
Now somebody, somebody, somebody in chattel shouted out, um, I think we own like two physical

1565
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:05,940
copies of that game.

1566
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:06,940
Well, there you go.

1567
01:22:06,940 --> 01:22:08,900
Well, if you want to get a third limited run games is doing it, but anyway, actually, and

1568
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:12,180
I do want to say this is not, this is not through limited run games because I don't

1569
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:16,600
think limited run does Japan centric things.

1570
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,680
So this is a shadow of the Ninja.

1571
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:19,680
Thank you.

1572
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:20,680
Dark Tetsuya.

1573
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:24,300
Um, so yeah, this is something that Nihon Falcom is doing directly.

1574
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:28,580
If it sells out, sells, it's going to be interesting to see what else comes from this

1575
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:29,580
in my opinion.

1576
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:32,420
So, uh, it could be, it could be, what's old is new again.

1577
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:33,420
Right.

1578
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:34,420
So, all right.

1579
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:35,420
Let's move on.

1580
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:36,420
Dark Sakura.

1581
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:42,900
Oh, um, another going on actually a little bit outside of the, I guess the more fun aspects

1582
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:49,420
of games and, um, especially since, you know, what we've been hearing in, you know, quote,

1583
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:54,220
real life has been economy, this, and you know, money, that, and what we're going to

1584
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:55,220
do.

1585
01:22:55,220 --> 01:23:04,340
Um, so, uh, I, um, I thought it was pretty interesting to find that video games, um,

1586
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:11,340
by recent reports, um, state that the video game industry in and of itself in 2019 generated

1587
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:24,420
90.3 billion in economic output and supported, um, uh, close to, uh, 429,000 jobs, um, with,

1588
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:28,740
uh, about a third of that who are actually employed in the industry.

1589
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:36,820
Um, and they're really generating a lot of, you know, uh, uh, tax money for, uh, you know,

1590
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:39,740
for, uh, their various states.

1591
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:47,060
Um, overall, um, California of course has the largest, uh, total economic output and

1592
01:23:47,060 --> 01:24:00,940
employment with a $51.8 billion and a 218 90, wait, 218,090, uh, jobs.

1593
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:06,180
So you think about this, you know, when we were growing, growing up, you know, people

1594
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:11,620
say, oh, I want to do this in video games, you know, and they're like, oh, you can't

1595
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:17,260
make money in that, uh, excuse you, look at this, you know, you, you can, and people are

1596
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:18,260
making money in this deal.

1597
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:20,060
Or you have to live in Japan to do that.

1598
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:21,060
Yeah.

1599
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:25,380
Um, oh, but I mean, but, but think about it that way.

1600
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:32,380
You know, this, it is now a very, uh, lucrative industry and a very competitive industry on

1601
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:33,420
top of that.

1602
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:40,500
And, um, of course, uh, uh, women in the gaming industry are still having a very difficult,

1603
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:47,100
uh, you know, ceiling to, I wouldn't say it's like glass, I'm thinking more like the transparent

1604
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:52,900
aluminum from, uh, was it, was it Star Trek three, Star Trek four, I think it was Star

1605
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:54,900
Trek four, the one with the whales.

1606
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:55,900
Anyway.

1607
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:56,900
Um, okay, cool.

1608
01:24:57,420 --> 01:25:06,260
Um, but at any rate, you know, uh, it's, uh, it's really, and I think that now with, um,

1609
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:12,940
you know, COVID business going on, I truly believe that it's only going to be a bigger

1610
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:13,940
contributor.

1611
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:18,780
I'm really looking at, I mean, and me who is not like the most, let's follow the stonks

1612
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,780
and the economies and all that.

1613
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:25,340
I am super interested to see what next year's fiscal reporting looks like.

1614
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:26,780
Oh, sorry.

1615
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:31,580
I will technically this year's fiscal reporting, which I think is like, what in April.

1616
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:32,580
So we'll see.

1617
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:33,580
Yeah.

1618
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:37,100
Well, I mean, it makes sense that, you know, throughout this pandemic when we're really

1619
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:40,860
being encouraged to stay at home, you know, as an aside, I think, you know, cause this

1620
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:44,740
show is broadcast around the world and, and a lot of you in the States, you know, see

1621
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:48,420
this, and you've probably seen a lot in the news about how California is going to go back

1622
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:50,780
on the, the super lockdown or whatever.

1623
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:53,420
But what's interesting is that when I see those stories, I'm like, that's what I've

1624
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:58,740
been doing ever since March, like nothing, like it's so like people read those stories

1625
01:25:58,740 --> 01:25:59,740
and go, Oh my gosh.

1626
01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:01,540
And I look at it and go, nothing's changing.

1627
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:06,460
Well, but going into another thing on this though, well, but keep in mind, Rob, people

1628
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:12,300
like you and me, we are in the minority, especially as you said, there were people protesting

1629
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:18,020
the lockdown by being super spreaders, especially, especially North of here and in the central

1630
01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:19,020
Valley.

1631
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:22,580
And what was the first place to go on lockdown and who's next?

1632
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:26,460
Well, technically the most, the most populated area of the state also is on the super lockdown,

1633
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:29,620
but who was right after him, the central Valley, who's going to be next?

1634
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:30,620
The North state.

1635
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:31,620
Yeah.

1636
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:39,060
Um, but going, going back to another thing though, is, and I was reading another article

1637
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:45,020
today, I think it was by Forbes or business insider, one of the two that whatever happens

1638
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:52,260
with, um, you know, with vaccines and, you know, going back to the former normal, um,

1639
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:55,980
the way people work has been irrevocably changed.

1640
01:26:55,980 --> 01:27:03,820
They've proven that you can do, um, uh, that telecommuting is not just, uh, a valid means

1641
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:07,820
of work, but people are in a lot of cases, more productive by doing so.

1642
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:12,380
My, my work will have a permanent change involving telework due to this whole thing.

1643
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:16,700
I'm hoping that that mine does, but they're not expecting us to go eat remotely back into

1644
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:19,500
the office until maybe late next year, which I'm fine with that.

1645
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:20,500
Yeah.

1646
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:21,500
And I'm not saying a hundred percent.

1647
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:22,500
I'm saying it's a change.

1648
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:23,500
It's going to be a change.

1649
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:25,380
It's going to be more open than they were ever talking about before.

1650
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:29,340
Well, so, but the other thing too, is that it's also changed things for like the medical

1651
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:30,340
field.

1652
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:34,780
Um, how many of us have had, um, our doctor's visits now on video?

1653
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:35,780
Yeah.

1654
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:39,620
You know, um, I mean, just, just saying in general, it's really changed the way a lot

1655
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:43,860
of business operates for the better, I think.

1656
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:51,300
Um, and if you look at it this way, it's even, I think helping environmentally by hopefully

1657
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:59,420
lowering, you know, physical commute time and operating costs of large, uh, large commercial

1658
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:00,900
buildings, for example.

1659
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:08,420
And so with video games, I'm not sure how many, um, designers, um, well, I mean, sure,

1660
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:13,620
I'm pretty sure a designer with a good enough, uh, system at home would be able to, to do

1661
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:17,420
a lot of their work from a, a, a home studio.

1662
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:22,980
Um, a lot of, a lot are doing it now, just really boosting up their, their home studios

1663
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:23,980
that way.

1664
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:31,140
And I'm sure that anyone doing any of the more clerical end of this, um, or writing

1665
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:33,900
end of this, they're going to be able to do it.

1666
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:40,340
So I'm seeing entire studios keep being as productive as they are, but doing it from

1667
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:41,940
the safety of their homes.

1668
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:42,940
Yeah.

1669
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:43,940
I think there's, it's good.

1670
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:47,820
You know, that we talk about like the new normal and I don't think the new normal is

1671
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:49,780
necessarily a bunch of scary things.

1672
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:53,200
I think, um, there's a lot of like, really good.

1673
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:56,500
And I think those of us that are tech inclined, and I think if you listen to the show and

1674
01:28:56,500 --> 01:29:02,020
you are a hardcore or even casual core fan of video games, you are somewhat tech inclined.

1675
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:03,660
And I think there's a lot about that new normal.

1676
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:05,380
That's going to be very friendly to us.

1677
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:09,160
You know, I think like, like web conferencing and these types of things, we were doing this

1678
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:13,140
for a long time and back to the original story that, that brought us to this video games

1679
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:18,020
being a major part of the economy and a major outlet for release and a thing that we do

1680
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:19,920
to bond with other people.

1681
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:23,340
You know, we all knew this and I think a lot of people in our generation knew this, but

1682
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:29,780
I think even more, especially people older than us have come to things like Jackbox games.

1683
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:30,980
Great example, right?

1684
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:35,460
I know heck of people that maybe played the occasional phone game, but didn't really play

1685
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:39,940
a lot of video games, um, that like, were like, Oh, I love Jackbox games.

1686
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:42,340
Let's, let's have a Jackbox night or get together and do that.

1687
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:46,980
You know, that's, that's now money in the video game economy that wasn't there before,

1688
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:47,980
you know?

1689
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:53,220
So I think, I think, uh, and especially people that are developing things like this, um,

1690
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:58,420
and among us, can I just go on a quick tangent?

1691
01:29:58,420 --> 01:29:59,700
Let's talk about among us.

1692
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:01,500
Let's do that.

1693
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:02,940
Let's talk about among us.

1694
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:08,260
I saw an interesting thing on Twitter about how some people really don't want to play

1695
01:30:08,260 --> 01:30:13,020
among us or our little resistance to that game, because they don't like the element

1696
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:17,500
of lying to their friends and getting accused of lying.

1697
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,940
And I'm, I'm completely sensitive to that.

1698
01:30:19,940 --> 01:30:23,900
And I get that it's interesting because I haven't played a lot of among us yet.

1699
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:29,140
I totally play these survivor games online where I lie and do all this crap that I would

1700
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:30,700
never do in real life.

1701
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:33,980
But I also understand that really isn't for everybody.

1702
01:30:33,980 --> 01:30:35,420
And I get that.

1703
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:40,060
But I, the reason why I bring up among us and, and it's, even though those critiques

1704
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:46,900
are kind of there, like why has that game skyrocketed the way that it has this year?

1705
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:53,060
Like that game is a very brilliant example about how I think the, the needs and wants

1706
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:58,660
of the gaming community and the types of games that ended up being successful has kind of

1707
01:30:58,660 --> 01:31:04,540
changed because of the pandemic, you know, among us came out in like 2018 and everybody

1708
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:07,340
suddenly asking themselves, well, why now?

1709
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:08,940
Why is that game coming out now?

1710
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:16,000
Because in a way y'all, among us is like that really short condensed versions of Dungeons

1711
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,260
and Dragons.

1712
01:31:17,260 --> 01:31:24,700
Bear with me, D&D fans, I don't mean to sacrilege here, but it's a way of telling a story with

1713
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:30,500
your friends in this virtual setting and getting to do what is kind of inherently a social

1714
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:31,500
thing.

1715
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:32,500
I don't know.

1716
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:36,980
Jamie, you got to have some thoughts on this whole like among us and how the pandemic has

1717
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:39,420
allowed that game to be so successful.

1718
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:41,940
I think I've already had that same discussion with Animal Crossing.

1719
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:42,940
Oh, okay.

1720
01:31:42,940 --> 01:31:43,940
Fair.

1721
01:31:43,940 --> 01:31:44,940
Fair.

1722
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:50,820
It's a little thing to lose yourself in it's, you know, you can be social in it.

1723
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:54,460
I mean, it's more for the people who have like the social need, it is a way to get together

1724
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:59,100
with your friends and play a game without getting together with your friends.

1725
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:03,020
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, yes, but those survivor games are against people you probably

1726
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:05,300
never met.

1727
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:07,260
Half true.

1728
01:32:07,260 --> 01:32:08,260
For the most part, yes.

1729
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:10,520
I don't want to just like be contrary into your statement.

1730
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:15,180
But there were like a couple people in that game that like I knew about, or I kind of

1731
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:17,620
knew them through somebody else.

1732
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:21,940
But also, like through that process, yes, there was lying and I did a lot of it to win

1733
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:23,100
the game.

1734
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:28,900
But there are people in that game that like I will talk to, like if certain people that

1735
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:32,460
were in that game and they who know who they are, if they ever needed anything from me,

1736
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:34,460
I would drop a lot.

1737
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:38,500
Like I made some really good lifelong friends out of that process, honestly.

1738
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:39,500
So yeah.

1739
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:40,500
Anyway.

1740
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:41,500
Okay, let's move on.

1741
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:45,720
Sorry, we got a lot of tangents and it's my fault.

1742
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:50,300
But we have a direct to get to very soon and our classic pinball table of the month.

1743
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:54,420
But first, we're going to get to this next story, Loki.

1744
01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:56,500
All right.

1745
01:32:56,500 --> 01:33:04,260
So we've got some interesting changes at Sony.

1746
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:16,180
So apparently, the creator of Silent Hill and Gravity Rush, Kichiro Toyama, has actually

1747
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:21,800
left Sony and formed his own studio.

1748
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:22,800
So that's pretty awesome.

1749
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:26,400
It seems to be kind of the trend, you know, a lot of these big names, you know, coming

1750
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,960
out and forming their own studio.

1751
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:32,840
So he has a new outfit called Bokeh Game Studios.

1752
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:42,880
And yeah, so basically, along with that, he's also got Kazunobu Sato, who designed Puppeteer,

1753
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,080
if you remember that game on PlayStation 3.

1754
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:48,080
Yeah.

1755
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:52,200
And then also was the producer of The Last Guardian.

1756
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:58,320
And then Junya Okura, who was a designer on Gravity Rush.

1757
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:00,560
So pretty nice pedigree there.

1758
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:03,880
Be curious to see what they're working on.

1759
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:07,360
Yeah, that's interesting.

1760
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,880
Some big, big departures there.

1761
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:13,980
And it certainly kind of gives a swift kick in the butt to all these Silent Hill reboot

1762
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:16,920
at Sony rumors that go around every couple months.

1763
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:22,000
But well, they have some sketches that's in their little video talking about their new

1764
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,520
chapter or whatever.

1765
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:26,880
And it is certainly horror looking.

1766
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:31,180
So maybe we'll see.

1767
01:34:31,180 --> 01:34:33,200
I mean, so yeah, it's the other game.

1768
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:35,260
They also worked on Siren as well.

1769
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:37,520
So that's that's pretty interesting.

1770
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:38,520
Yeah.

1771
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:39,520
Yeah.

1772
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,720
So I guess we'll wait and see.

1773
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:44,280
Perhaps we'll hear something about that at the Game Awards.

1774
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:45,280
Perhaps.

1775
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:46,280
I was thinking.

1776
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:47,280
Yeah.

1777
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:48,280
So we'll wait and see.

1778
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:49,280
All right.

1779
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:50,620
Well, all right.

1780
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:56,180
So talking about departures, I know Dark Soccer is really thrilled to talk about this.

1781
01:34:56,180 --> 01:35:00,780
There are some big departures that happen at BioWare this week and in advance of New

1782
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:06,820
Dragon Age news at the Game Awards, Casey Hudson, who at one time was the creative director

1783
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:10,400
behind the Mass Effect series, but at one point recently became the general.

1784
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:14,340
He left once and then came back as the general manager of BioWare.

1785
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:18,100
And now he's leaving again and saying, I'm incredibly fortunate to have had a career

1786
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:22,100
where I've been able to work with brilliantly talented people, create entire worlds from

1787
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:25,860
our imaginations and see them being enjoyed by millions of people around the world.

1788
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:30,080
And now, after nearly 20 years of work at BioWare, I've made the decision to retire

1789
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:33,820
from the studio and make way for the next generation of studio leaders.

1790
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:34,820
Interesting.

1791
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:37,900
He's retiring from the studio, but he didn't say he was retiring from the game industry.

1792
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:40,220
Just something I just something I observe.

1793
01:35:40,220 --> 01:35:42,500
That's all I'm just making observations.

1794
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:46,380
But the interesting thing is that would have been news in itself if he'd left.

1795
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:51,780
Because the same day that news came out, Dragon Age executive producer Mark Darrah

1796
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:56,540
also left, saying, though I remain confident in BioWare's strength and continued place

1797
01:35:56,540 --> 01:36:00,580
in this conversation, I have decided to retire from my position at BioWare.

1798
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:05,740
Again, I can't help but note, not the game industry, but BioWare.

1799
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:11,460
Anyway, obviously nothing is going to change with development on the new Dragon Age and

1800
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:15,820
the Mass Effect remaster games, whatever the hell is going on with Anthem.

1801
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:21,260
Laura Miles, I hope I'm saying her name right, sorry, who is the chief studio officer at

1802
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:26,060
Electronic Arts kind of put out her own statement alongside this, pretty much reassuring fans

1803
01:36:26,060 --> 01:36:28,540
that things are going to be just fine.

1804
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:33,520
And it is interesting to note that Christian Daley, who used to be with Blizzard Entertainment,

1805
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:37,100
is taking over for the Dragon Age 4 end of things.

1806
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:41,620
And Mike Gamble will be taking over on the Mass Effect remaster, which I would imagine

1807
01:36:41,620 --> 01:36:43,840
is pretty close to completion at this point.

1808
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:51,740
So we'll see what happens with the future of the Mass Effect franchise.

1809
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:52,740
So I don't know.

1810
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:56,800
The fact that they're both happening the same day is a little weird to me.

1811
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:58,740
And I don't know if anything's wrong with BioWare.

1812
01:36:58,740 --> 01:37:02,140
I feel like this smells like an EA thing.

1813
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:03,460
I don't know.

1814
01:37:03,460 --> 01:37:04,900
Could it maybe just be a coincidence?

1815
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:05,900
I don't know.

1816
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:06,900
Darrah?

1817
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:11,580
I'm sure we'll get an article down the road telling us about some shenanigans going on

1818
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:12,580
behind the scenes.

1819
01:37:12,580 --> 01:37:18,120
Well, the shenanigans I want to hear is that those two formed a new studio, or this would

1820
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:19,780
be a gag.

1821
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:24,680
They joined that studio that the Blizzard folks made, which I...

1822
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:25,680
What was the name of it?

1823
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:29,240
It had a very tongue in cheek name.

1824
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:31,240
Somebody will remember it in chat, but the Blizzard...

1825
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:32,240
Very cold weather.

1826
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:34,160
No, the Blizzard, it's like ice something.

1827
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:39,540
The Blizzard folks made a new studio and I don't know why.

1828
01:37:39,540 --> 01:37:42,320
Maybe it's just because there's that Blizzard tie in towards the end there, but I don't

1829
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:45,220
know why I feel like that would be such a gag.

1830
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:46,940
DarkSakura, you are the resident...

1831
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:47,940
Oh, thank you.

1832
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:48,940
Frost King Games.

1833
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:49,940
Thank you.

1834
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:50,940
Frost Giant.

1835
01:37:50,940 --> 01:37:51,940
Frost Giant game.

1836
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:52,940
Thank you.

1837
01:37:52,940 --> 01:37:53,940
I knew there was a play there.

1838
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:57,460
DarkSakura, you are the resident BioWare fangirl of many sorts.

1839
01:37:57,460 --> 01:37:58,460
Your thoughts?

1840
01:37:58,460 --> 01:37:59,460
Cool.

1841
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:06,160
I knew there were shenanigans going on.

1842
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:07,160
I don't want to speculate.

1843
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:09,420
I just want to see what happens.

1844
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:10,420
Show me the product.

1845
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:14,440
That's how I've been for just about everything these days.

1846
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:17,280
Okay, people have done this stuff.

1847
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:18,880
People leave companies all the time.

1848
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:21,040
They're just not as high profile, right?

1849
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:23,320
Let's see what they're going to do with it.

1850
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:24,480
High profile folks leave too.

1851
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:27,840
I mean, Blizzard, Mike Morhaime, that's a pretty big deal.

1852
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:33,080
Some have noted that Blizzard's quality has dipped a little bit, but that's another story

1853
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:35,480
for another day, I suppose.

1854
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:36,920
So yeah, interesting.

1855
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:42,980
For me, I want to see what happens, not guess about what's going on.

1856
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:48,900
There have been way too many times that people have speculated stuff and been wrong, and

1857
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:50,900
I don't want to be wrong.

1858
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:52,620
I want to be pleased.

1859
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:54,620
Sometimes it's fun to be wrong, but only sometimes.

1860
01:38:54,620 --> 01:38:55,620
All right.

1861
01:38:55,620 --> 01:38:56,620
From what planet?

1862
01:38:56,620 --> 01:38:57,620
I'm never wrong.

1863
01:38:57,620 --> 01:38:58,620
That's why I don't speculate.

1864
01:38:58,620 --> 01:39:03,620
So I can be right all the time.

1865
01:39:03,620 --> 01:39:08,320
And let's go to another category that you are certainly an expert on, and that is classic

1866
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:13,640
games as we get to the classic game of the week.

1867
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:18,600
But of course, as you know, once a month here on this show in a 2020 twist, we go into the

1868
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:22,520
archives and choose a pinball game to talk about.

1869
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:28,080
So it's time for the classic pinball table of the month, our last one for 2020.

1870
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:31,160
Did we determine a 2021 theme?

1871
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:32,160
I thought we had.

1872
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:35,140
I don't think I did.

1873
01:39:35,140 --> 01:39:36,140
I don't know.

1874
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:37,140
I might think of one.

1875
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:38,140
All right.

1876
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:43,100
So 2021 twist to be determined unless someone in chat, I'll do, I'll do non classic game

1877
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:44,100
of the month.

1878
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:45,100
All right.

1879
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:48,600
But we still have one more pinball table to get us through the year.

1880
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:52,800
So dark soccer, what is December's classic pinball table of the month?

1881
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:58,260
I picked a table that is sort of a transitional table, the kind of the end of its particular

1882
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:04,560
era and another John Papadook table, because, you know, I love my John Papadook tables.

1883
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:12,880
So Circus Voltaire, it came out in 1997, done by John Papadook and released by Williams

1884
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,960
under their ballet label.

1885
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:21,800
And it has the player, the sort of theme of it is doing different quote marvels to join

1886
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:23,760
the circus.

1887
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:27,800
And it has a few very distinctive things going on with it.

1888
01:40:28,340 --> 01:40:32,340
One of its features has a neon light that runs along the right hand ramp and a pop bumper

1889
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:38,180
that rises up in the middle of the play field and a magnet at the top left ramp that can

1890
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:40,860
catch the balls and divert them into locks.

1891
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:43,340
They're a ball catcher.

1892
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:48,580
And the biggest feature is the ringmaster, which is a head that rises up to taunt the

1893
01:40:48,580 --> 01:40:50,300
player.

1894
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:51,420
And I must apologize.

1895
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:58,600
I tried to find the a digital table so we could get better sound on it.

1896
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:02,300
And I found sort of like a how to play.

1897
01:41:02,300 --> 01:41:09,240
So and for anyone who is watching the video while we are live, you might notice that the

1898
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:14,560
DMD is interesting, that it's an interesting place.

1899
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:21,680
So only two tables had their DMD is in such a place like this.

1900
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:23,960
The other one was Capcom's flipper football.

1901
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:32,000
You know, Capcom had a kind of a limited run doing pinballs, but the the two of them have

1902
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:38,040
their DMD not on the top marquee, but sunken into the play field.

1903
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:44,200
It's on the back box in the right, the right back box into the cabinet.

1904
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:51,180
So the point of that, as I say, was to not distract the player from gameplay by looking

1905
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:56,720
up for their modes and their shots and to see what was going on.

1906
01:41:56,720 --> 01:42:07,760
And it also does have a little bit more interactivity, like animation that shows a cannonball fired.

1907
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:11,000
It has different things that are a little bit more integration.

1908
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:19,520
Why I say that this was a bit of a transitional game is that the sunken DMD could be considered

1909
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:29,740
a precursor to the pinball 2000 series, where the display was a holographic projection on

1910
01:42:29,740 --> 01:42:30,740
top of the table.

1911
01:42:30,740 --> 01:42:36,840
Games like Revenge from Mars and Episode One Racing, Episode One Master, whatever, Star

1912
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:39,720
Wars Episode One.

1913
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:44,440
And this this was I mean, I'll be honest, it's a little bit actually more distracting

1914
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:46,640
me to have it on the back box.

1915
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:52,840
I have played the Circus Voltaire a couple of times, kind of an interesting one to find.

1916
01:42:52,840 --> 01:43:00,480
But yeah, as you were watching the the wizard mode going on right now, right?

1917
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:03,340
Yeah, it's a really neat table.

1918
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:08,480
The ramps in this are actually pretty, pretty insane, I would think.

1919
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:11,760
I really, I really think that the layout of this was really good.

1920
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:15,080
Again, I love Papa Duke's design and pinball.

1921
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:22,120
So as far as the modes, you have nine quote marvels that you have to complete until you

1922
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:27,480
are invited to join the circus and that circus with a Q, C-I-R-Q-U-S.

1923
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:35,380
They are in a three by three square grid with the row and column corresponding to C-I-R-Q-U-S.

1924
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:39,800
And when you fill the grid, then you get the join the circus wizard mode.

1925
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:47,100
So you have juggler and then you can start a juggler multiball with that sideshow random

1926
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:53,380
award ringmaster frenzy where you defeat the ringmaster twice to start frenzy multiball

1927
01:43:53,380 --> 01:44:03,500
menagerie where you hit some targets on the left to do a large plastic captive ball defeated

1928
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:07,020
all ringmasters where you can do special multiball.

1929
01:44:07,020 --> 01:44:10,980
There's high wire multiball where you hit the light lock targets on either side of the

1930
01:44:10,980 --> 01:44:16,680
left ramp and then shoot the ramp three times to lock the balls and start high wire multiball.

1931
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:19,060
Spin is the spinner.

1932
01:44:19,060 --> 01:44:25,580
Boom is you spell out volt and then once the letters are collected, the third pop bumper

1933
01:44:25,580 --> 01:44:31,680
pops up and you get that after the timer runs out, you get your marble after the timer runs

1934
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:37,720
out and every hit on that bumper counts towards lighting an extra ball.

1935
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:42,760
And then you have acrobats where you shoot the right ramp or orbit four times.

1936
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:50,020
So you also have the character, the ringmaster that lives under the play field.

1937
01:44:50,020 --> 01:44:54,260
It's a flat circular platform attached to the top of his head.

1938
01:44:54,260 --> 01:44:59,840
And he sits directly in front of the W-O-W targets in the upper right hand corner and

1939
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,880
has a hidden magnet.

1940
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:05,100
So once the targets have been hit a total of three times, the magnet catches and holds

1941
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:09,100
the ball as the ringmaster will rise to taunt the player.

1942
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:12,820
And then the ball is shot off in a random direction.

1943
01:45:12,820 --> 01:45:19,320
You will have a very brief ball saver if it does go out of play.

1944
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:31,320
And basically after after it's stood up, you would have to hit it five times and it will

1945
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:32,320
further expose.

1946
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:38,120
He's going to expose himself a hole where you can shoot a ball into his hole.

1947
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:39,360
Yeah.

1948
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:43,240
Like I said before, there are the various multiball modes in order.

1949
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:48,760
We have ringmaster frenzy, ringmaster Raz, ringmaster special.

1950
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:55,480
And the ringmaster battle, which you get if you have defeated all the ringmasters.

1951
01:45:55,480 --> 01:46:00,680
So those are your big, big four ringmaster multiballs.

1952
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:05,380
The other ones, like I said, are high wire juggler neon, which is one of the sideshow

1953
01:46:05,380 --> 01:46:11,960
random awards for three balls strike and arc multiball, which is a two ball multi.

1954
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:15,320
The ringmaster ones are all two ball as well.

1955
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:19,620
High wire juggler neon are all three.

1956
01:46:19,620 --> 01:46:25,160
And then, of course, when you get after all nine, then you have your your join the circus

1957
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:30,360
wizard mode where you have to spell circus unmaskable tear, meet the circus, and then

1958
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:35,680
you have party multiball and join the circus ends when either all of them drain in any

1959
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:43,080
of the first three phases or when the three balls drain in the fourth arc of it.

1960
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:50,000
The circus will tear for anyone who who likes to play the virtual versions.

1961
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:55,420
It was formally available in pinball arcade until June 30th, twenty eighteen.

1962
01:46:55,420 --> 01:46:58,560
Williams Midway license did expire.

1963
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:05,140
Then it was licensed to Zen Studios, who had that in pinball effects three and as an unlockable

1964
01:47:05,140 --> 01:47:10,440
in Williams pinball mobile for iOS and Android.

1965
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:15,680
There were unlicensed versions for visual pinball for four windows.

1966
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:19,280
But yeah, I really enjoy this one.

1967
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:25,080
I mean, I've pretty much have never played a Papa Duke designed table that I don't like.

1968
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:29,120
The only thing that freaks me out is that, you know, I'm just like this person that like

1969
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:34,080
if a game has like a head on it, it kind of freaks me out.

1970
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:38,120
Like maybe this one wasn't as bad as like, say, fun house fun house freaks me the fuck

1971
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:39,120
out.

1972
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:45,760
It's just it's that Rudy had, you know, but it's a it's a really enjoyable table with

1973
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:49,700
with an awesome theme, quite a bit of challenge to it.

1974
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:56,920
And I'll be honest, the last time I played a circus Voltaire, I think was in Las Vegas

1975
01:47:56,920 --> 01:48:00,440
at the pinball museum when I went with Tara.

1976
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:01,440
Yeah.

1977
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:02,440
Yeah.

1978
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:05,040
So there you go.

1979
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:11,960
The classic pinball of the of the month of December last one for this year is Circus

1980
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:12,960
Voltaire.

1981
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:14,660
All right.

1982
01:48:14,660 --> 01:48:15,660
Awesome choice.

1983
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:20,520
I think I remember seeing this one when I went to that same museum in Vegas, which hopefully

1984
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:22,480
I'll be able to visit again at some point.

1985
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:24,260
So all right.

1986
01:48:24,260 --> 01:48:28,000
So great choice for I like how you kind of pick something that kind of transition to

1987
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,200
a new era of pinball.

1988
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:32,160
That's a good kind of note to go out on for the classic pinballs.

1989
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:36,760
I will point out that the chat has a lot of lovely ideas for twenty twenty one, although

1990
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:38,580
ultimately it's up to you.

1991
01:48:38,580 --> 01:48:39,580
Some of the ideas.

1992
01:48:39,580 --> 01:48:40,580
Yeah.

1993
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:42,640
Some of the ideas that are getting thrown out there.

1994
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:44,720
Indie game of the month.

1995
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:46,840
Classic remake of the week.

1996
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:49,200
A couple of people were suggesting crappy game.

1997
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:52,780
In my opinion, you've already kind of been doing crappy like you did Miss Nude World

1998
01:48:52,780 --> 01:48:57,800
ninety six is a classic game once like crappy games are sometimes classic because they're

1999
01:48:57,800 --> 01:48:58,800
crappy.

2000
01:48:58,800 --> 01:48:59,800
Yeah.

2001
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:02,880
And the thing is, is it usually when I pick a crappy game, there's like a notability to

2002
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:08,800
it, like either in pop culture or that it led to something, you know, or it's like a

2003
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:09,800
cult classic.

2004
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:10,800
Yeah.

2005
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:15,000
Wasn't that like we did that for like one of the it was it one of the numbered episodes

2006
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,000
like a six.

2007
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,000
It was like a six.

2008
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,480
It was like six hundred or five hundred or one of the yeah.

2009
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:20,480
It was a anniversary.

2010
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:22,280
I was one of those.

2011
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:23,760
So yeah.

2012
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:25,800
And as pointed out, it was an in-joke from the show.

2013
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:27,780
It sure was.

2014
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:31,700
Some ideas of my own that weren't said, I'll just throw out there for your consideration.

2015
01:49:31,700 --> 01:49:35,820
I was thinking classic collectible like you've done peripheral.

2016
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:38,780
But then I was thinking of like some of those like crazy things in the vault, like that

2017
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:39,780
game that had the dish.

2018
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:40,780
I don't know.

2019
01:49:40,780 --> 01:49:41,780
It's a classic.

2020
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:42,780
Yeah.

2021
01:49:42,780 --> 01:49:43,780
Maybe maybe I'll do that.

2022
01:49:43,780 --> 01:49:44,780
The classic dish of the week.

2023
01:49:44,780 --> 01:49:45,780
Classic.

2024
01:49:45,780 --> 01:49:47,940
I'll do classic recipe.

2025
01:49:47,940 --> 01:49:50,180
Classic pie of the month.

2026
01:49:50,180 --> 01:49:54,860
Another idea I had since I know you're all about like books and things actually to now

2027
01:49:54,860 --> 01:49:56,820
one just popped in my head.

2028
01:49:56,860 --> 01:50:02,060
I think instruction manual or box art might be a good one where you talk about and I know

2029
01:50:02,060 --> 01:50:06,340
that might not be great for a podcast, but I think it might be a cool thing to acknowledge,

2030
01:50:06,340 --> 01:50:09,520
you know, especially because I know you got a design background, so it might be a fun

2031
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,520
thing to talk about.

2032
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:14,540
But I was thinking when I originally thought a book, I was thinking we have all these magazines

2033
01:50:14,540 --> 01:50:18,220
that have gone by the wayside, you know, and like other like, you know, printed books that

2034
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:19,220
we might remember.

2035
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:20,220
I don't know.

2036
01:50:20,220 --> 01:50:23,660
Like the strategy guide that everybody got for Final Fantasy with Nintendo Power, you

2037
01:50:23,660 --> 01:50:24,660
know, things like that.

2038
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:26,320
And I think about it.

2039
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:27,320
What was the other one?

2040
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:29,320
I had one other one that I thought of.

2041
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:30,320
And now I can't remember.

2042
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:31,320
Oh, well.

2043
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:32,320
But you have a lot to think about for 2021.

2044
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:33,320
OK.

2045
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:34,320
Yeah.

2046
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:37,640
And Bobby did rightly point out that I did Halo as a classic game, but bear in mind,

2047
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:38,640
I did it for money.

2048
01:50:38,640 --> 01:50:39,640
Yes, that is right.

2049
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:40,640
That is right.

2050
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:41,640
I did it.

2051
01:50:41,640 --> 01:50:47,480
I put a bounty of five hundred dollars to pay my mother's bills.

2052
01:50:47,480 --> 01:50:52,000
And I did Halo because of the generosity of our Orange Lounge listeners.

2053
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,120
Yes, Bobby, you totally paid for that.

2054
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:56,320
And my mother thanks you.

2055
01:50:56,320 --> 01:51:00,800
It kept her in her house and fed for a month.

2056
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:03,740
So thank you very much for your kindness to my mom.

2057
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:07,480
I like how YYRS going meta here saying a classic OLR clip of the month.

2058
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:10,960
We don't have 12 classic moments.

2059
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:12,760
Like I remember any shit we've done.

2060
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:13,760
I don't remember.

2061
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:14,760
Do you remember?

2062
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:15,760
I don't remember.

2063
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:18,400
Dartits is going to take over the segment because he knows more about this show than

2064
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:19,400
I do.

2065
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:25,040
I remember laying in your bed, Rob, at the apartment eating Loki's waffles.

2066
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:30,280
No, you know who knows more about this show than me, you and Loki combined, Misty.

2067
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:32,760
Misty knows more about this show than any of us.

2068
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:38,120
Like I think I think the only way you're going to get if the only way you're getting that

2069
01:51:38,120 --> 01:51:40,560
segment is if Misty volunteers to do it.

2070
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:43,960
Maybe I'll do classic OLR listener of the month.

2071
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:45,960
Oh, that'd be cute.

2072
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:46,960
I like that.

2073
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:49,520
Yeah, I mean, but I don't want to leave anybody out.

2074
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:50,920
Yeah, that's true.

2075
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:54,960
Maybe you could do people that aren't really here anymore.

2076
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:58,580
Like that sounds really morbid, you know, like puppy, right?

2077
01:51:58,580 --> 01:52:02,200
Like he's got like a kid and they're all into Star Wars.

2078
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:10,920
The 23rd, Drew and his joke book and their DDR angels streaming now under oh, God, I

2079
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:11,920
forgot.

2080
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:12,920
Like tech angel.

2081
01:52:12,920 --> 01:52:13,920
It's tech angel.

2082
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:14,920
Thank you.

2083
01:52:14,920 --> 01:52:15,920
I was almost a complete jerk.

2084
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:16,920
So anyway.

2085
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:17,920
All right.

2086
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:19,920
Look, we got to move on.

2087
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:20,920
So.

2088
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:21,920
All right.

2089
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:22,920
Yeah.

2090
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:24,920
Well, Dark Sakura will stew on this question and we'll let you know soon.

2091
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:32,960
I'll tell you what for find me on my Twitter at Dark Sakura and, you know, start a thread.

2092
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:33,960
Leave me some ideas.

2093
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:34,960
Shit.

2094
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:37,000
I'll take a look at it because I don't know what to do.

2095
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,000
All right.

2096
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:44,880
Well, speaking of iconic listeners of OLR's past and present and future, YYR, our friend

2097
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:49,000
out there on the East Coast, you know, we have these things that are on the Orange Lounge

2098
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:52,640
Radio Wiki that are the Orange Lounge Radio Dream Games.

2099
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:54,400
So just we haven't had one in a while.

2100
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:58,040
I think some things we've kind of just mentioned off the cusp, but especially in some of the

2101
01:52:58,040 --> 01:53:01,900
earlier days of the of the podcast format of the show and so forth, we've we've kind

2102
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:06,360
of thrown out these ideas like that should be a game that needs to be a game.

2103
01:53:06,360 --> 01:53:08,800
And so a few of these ideas have gone out there.

2104
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:12,920
And YYR has put together some of these games as a reality.

2105
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:15,240
Like he actually asked, can I make these games a reality?

2106
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:18,160
And the first one he ever did was Bungee Ferret Tossing.

2107
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:23,640
And that was a game that was available on the Xbox 360 indie arcade.

2108
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:29,440
And YYR, a little more recently in the era of the PlayStation Vita, did a game called

2109
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:32,340
Pixel Shits, but he had to rename it Pixel Poops.

2110
01:53:32,340 --> 01:53:34,480
But the dream game was technically Pixel Shits.

2111
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:41,040
And this is something that Dark Sakura just verbally pooped here on the show.

2112
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:48,800
Sometimes, but well, but look at you, it became a game and everybody listens to the show knows

2113
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:49,800
about it.

2114
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:50,800
So.

2115
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:53,640
And you have your very own direct for your game.

2116
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:56,240
Yes, so that's what we're getting to.

2117
01:53:56,240 --> 01:54:00,440
We're going to get to YYR's official Pixel Poops direct.

2118
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:02,760
And now I've been a very good boy and scouts honor.

2119
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:04,520
I have no idea what he's going to talk about here.

2120
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:06,120
Well, I assume it's Pixel Poops.

2121
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:10,040
I don't know if he has any other surprises or what's happening, but we're going to play

2122
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:11,040
it.

2123
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:12,280
So I'm going to let you guys.

2124
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:14,660
So Dark Sakura and Loki, in order for you guys to see it, you're going to need to bring

2125
01:54:14,660 --> 01:54:16,240
up the feed and watch it on your side.

2126
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:19,880
So if you guys can mute yourselves and do that so you can see it.

2127
01:54:19,880 --> 01:54:20,880
And we will.

2128
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:21,880
Hold on.

2129
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:22,880
Yeah.

2130
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:25,160
I just realized I've inspired YYR to take a big shit on a video game.

2131
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:26,160
Yes, you have.

2132
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:27,160
Yes, you have.

2133
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:28,160
Thanks, dude.

2134
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:29,160
All right.

2135
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:32,440
So you may mute yourselves, guys, and make your way to the Twitch page so you can see

2136
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:33,440
this.

2137
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:34,820
And I'm actually gonna be watching this for the first time, too, but I am going to go

2138
01:54:34,820 --> 01:54:35,820
on mute.

2139
01:54:35,820 --> 01:54:39,760
I will say for the podcast listeners, this is about an eight and a half minute video.

2140
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:43,180
I'm assuming there is going to be gameplay footage of some kind.

2141
01:54:43,180 --> 01:54:45,580
It may not translate very well to a podcast.

2142
01:54:45,580 --> 01:54:47,000
I don't know how YYR did this.

2143
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,580
I don't know because I haven't really seen the video.

2144
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:53,440
So if you need to, this segment is about eight and a half minutes.

2145
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:58,000
And if you want to see the video, I'm almost certain YYR will put it up on his Twitter

2146
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:03,600
at YYR underscore, as well as his website, which is YYR games dot com.

2147
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:04,600
Okay.

2148
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:05,600
And he says there's voiceover the whole time.

2149
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:06,600
So good.

2150
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:09,020
He thought of you podcasties and you won't get bored.

2151
01:55:09,020 --> 01:55:12,900
So if you want to see the video side of it, it will be up on those sites.

2152
01:55:12,900 --> 01:55:13,900
Absolutely.

2153
01:55:13,900 --> 01:55:14,900
So it's podcast friendly.

2154
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:15,900
All right.

2155
01:55:15,900 --> 01:55:19,260
Then without further ado, let's get to it.

2156
01:55:19,260 --> 01:55:34,380
The Pixel Poops Direct from YYR Games.

2157
01:55:34,380 --> 01:55:36,900
Welcome to Pixel Poops Direct.

2158
01:55:36,900 --> 01:55:41,460
I'm Aaron Teplitski, creator of Pixel Poops.

2159
01:55:41,460 --> 01:55:43,460
Let's not mince words here.

2160
01:55:43,460 --> 01:55:49,020
As you know, 2020 has been the year of shit.

2161
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:54,660
Possibly the shittiest year so far in many of our lifetimes.

2162
01:55:54,660 --> 01:55:57,660
The good news is it's almost over.

2163
01:55:57,660 --> 01:56:02,020
The bad news is there's one more piece of shit in store for you.

2164
01:56:02,020 --> 01:56:06,060
Pixel Poops is coming to Steam.

2165
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:07,060
That's right.

2166
01:56:07,060 --> 01:56:12,380
This Atari 2600 inspired pile of shit from 2015 is coming back.

2167
01:56:12,380 --> 01:56:17,420
Once again, you'll play as an angry human with the highest metabolism imaginable on

2168
01:56:17,420 --> 01:56:21,700
a mission to exact vengeance on happy, motivated joggers.

2169
01:56:21,700 --> 01:56:22,700
Why?

2170
01:56:22,700 --> 01:56:24,040
Because you can.

2171
01:56:24,040 --> 01:56:27,860
And you're doing it the only way you know how.

2172
01:56:27,860 --> 01:56:32,700
Small shits will only slow the joggers down, but keep shitting and you'll produce huge

2173
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:34,460
piles of shit.

2174
01:56:34,460 --> 01:56:36,960
These will stop joggers in their tracks.

2175
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:38,880
And you'll score a point.

2176
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:44,580
And if you manage to combo multiple joggers in a single pile of shit, you get a bonus.

2177
01:56:44,580 --> 01:56:45,940
Can't shit anymore?

2178
01:56:45,940 --> 01:56:46,940
No problem.

2179
01:56:46,940 --> 01:56:50,440
Just head back over to this taco restaurant and eat up.

2180
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:56,540
But don't let too many of the joggers get away, or it's game over.

2181
01:56:56,540 --> 01:56:59,820
So what was the point of bringing this shit back?

2182
01:57:00,260 --> 01:57:04,820
Well, actually, the Steam version has a lot of new shit.

2183
01:57:04,820 --> 01:57:09,420
First off, there are three entirely new ways to play.

2184
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:13,340
Game two is remix, which switches things up in new ways.

2185
01:57:13,340 --> 01:57:16,580
Some joggers will now be able to switch direction.

2186
01:57:16,580 --> 01:57:19,340
You'll also have to look out for this guy.

2187
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:21,220
He's a tax collector.

2188
01:57:21,220 --> 01:57:22,580
His name?

2189
01:57:22,580 --> 01:57:24,780
Feces.

2190
01:57:24,780 --> 01:57:28,240
And if he touches you, you'll be fine 10 points.

2191
01:57:28,240 --> 01:57:32,680
But if you can trap him in a nice warm pile, you'll get double points.

2192
01:57:32,680 --> 01:57:38,040
Finally, say hello to your ultimate weapon, the poop bomb.

2193
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:42,000
Just hold the button down and...

2194
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,900
This will totally empty your chamber though, so you'll need to hurry and eat some tacos

2195
01:57:45,900 --> 01:57:47,760
to keep going.

2196
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:52,520
And you'll have to score some points before you can use the poop bomb again.

2197
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:57,640
Game three is alternate, which allows you to get creative with your shit.

2198
01:57:57,640 --> 01:58:02,360
Players who reach your small or medium shits will turn 90 degrees to the right.

2199
01:58:02,360 --> 01:58:08,080
This will allow you to corral them around, hopefully into a nice big steaming pile.

2200
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:13,640
Your shits will slowly degrade, but don't worry, you've got more.

2201
01:58:13,640 --> 01:58:17,640
Last but not least, game four is simple.

2202
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:24,440
Many Atari 2600 games have included a mode with simpler gameplay suitable for young children.

2203
01:58:24,440 --> 01:58:28,640
Poodle Poops now follows in those footsteps so you can share it with your kids.

2204
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:30,600
Stuck in poop.

2205
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:33,000
Yeah, they went stuck in poop!

2206
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,160
Isn't that funny?

2207
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:36,160
Yeah.

2208
01:58:36,160 --> 01:58:37,160
More.

2209
01:58:37,160 --> 01:58:43,480
Joggers are limited to horizontal movement, jumbo shits are easier to make, and trap joggers

2210
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:45,200
disappear more quickly.

2211
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:51,880
However, this also makes it harder to get combo bonuses, so a challenge still awaits.

2212
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:57,160
All four of these games can be enjoyed on normal or hard difficulty levels.

2213
01:58:57,160 --> 01:59:00,880
And you can also try all of them in time attack mode.

2214
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:06,240
In this mode, you'll want to score 200 points as quickly as possible, so combo bonuses are

2215
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:07,520
key.

2216
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:11,960
There are no penalties for joggers escaping in this mode, so you can also play at whatever

2217
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:13,400
pace you like.

2218
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:18,440
The game ends when you reach the target score or quit.

2219
01:59:18,440 --> 01:59:25,040
All told, there are four games, two difficulties, and two modes, adding up to 16 different ways

2220
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:29,560
to play, and every one of those will have a Steam leaderboard.

2221
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:32,560
There will be achievements to unlock, too.

2222
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:37,920
So maybe you're wondering, how much do I need to pay for this shit?

2223
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:42,600
Well, Pixel Poops will be free to play!

2224
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:45,700
But of course we're gonna do the shitty thing and try to fleece you for money once you try

2225
01:59:45,700 --> 01:59:46,920
it.

2226
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:49,600
So only game one is free.

2227
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:53,720
You'll be able to try out the other games briefly, but to complete a full round, you'll

2228
01:59:53,720 --> 01:59:57,360
need to fork over two dollars.

2229
01:59:57,360 --> 02:00:00,000
Yep, two dollars.

2230
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,800
Everything mentioned here is yours for two dollars.

2231
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:04,800
But here's the thing.

2232
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:07,720
I want to really monetize this shit.

2233
02:00:07,720 --> 02:00:10,200
So there's other shit for sale, too.

2234
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:12,160
Do you like the sound effects?

2235
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:19,160
Like and especially.

2236
02:00:19,160 --> 02:00:24,240
Do you perhaps want to use them in your own projects, in your podcasts, or in your own

2237
02:00:24,240 --> 02:00:25,240
games?

2238
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:29,560
Well, for another two dollars, you can have them and do whatever you like with them.

2239
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:32,240
Royalty free.

2240
02:00:32,240 --> 02:00:36,520
Or maybe you're looking for more shit to play and pay for.

2241
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:39,060
Well, I've got you covered there.

2242
02:00:39,060 --> 02:00:43,580
I would like to proudly introduce Pixel Poops 64.

2243
02:00:43,580 --> 02:00:45,540
Wait, what?

2244
02:00:45,540 --> 02:00:46,780
Were you expecting 3D?

2245
02:00:46,780 --> 02:00:50,340
Oh, oh, you meant that other 64.

2246
02:00:50,340 --> 02:00:54,780
I was talking about the Commodore 64!

2247
02:00:54,780 --> 02:00:58,880
This entirely new take on Pixel Poops plays a bit differently.

2248
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:01,020
For one thing, there's no restaurant.

2249
02:01:01,020 --> 02:01:06,940
Instead, you eat food off the ground, like any other self-respecting video game character.

2250
02:01:06,940 --> 02:01:11,500
There are some other differences as well, mostly due to hardware limitations.

2251
02:01:11,500 --> 02:01:15,880
I think you'll find it to be a refreshingly shitty new experience.

2252
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:22,140
And if you were wondering, yes, this is actually running on an emulated Commodore 64.

2253
02:01:22,140 --> 02:01:26,180
The game will be distributed as a Commodore 64 disk image.

2254
02:01:26,180 --> 02:01:31,100
You can play it on an emulator of your choice, or if you've got the right tools, you can

2255
02:01:31,100 --> 02:01:35,540
make a disk and play it on an actual Commodore 64.

2256
02:01:35,540 --> 02:01:37,380
And what's the damage?

2257
02:01:37,380 --> 02:01:40,260
That's right, also $2.

2258
02:01:40,260 --> 02:01:45,420
And now, if you tell me that you want all this shit, I'll tell you that you're fucking

2259
02:01:45,420 --> 02:01:48,980
crazy, but also that I'll give you a discount.

2260
02:01:48,980 --> 02:01:51,140
Five bucks gets it all.

2261
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:54,340
I appreciate your support very much.

2262
02:01:54,340 --> 02:01:58,780
Whether you're looking forward to buying this or not, I'll be posting on the VoG Discord

2263
02:01:58,780 --> 02:02:03,020
regarding playtesting opportunities, so please look forward to that.

2264
02:02:03,020 --> 02:02:08,500
You'll be able to try it out for free before it comes out.

2265
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:13,780
And as far as when it's hitting the virtual water, it'll be either late December or early

2266
02:02:13,780 --> 02:02:18,440
January, and if you keep listening to Orange Lounge Radio, you'll be the first to find

2267
02:02:18,440 --> 02:02:20,540
out for sure.

2268
02:02:20,540 --> 02:02:24,300
I want to thank you for watching this shitty presentation.

2269
02:02:24,300 --> 02:02:32,240
We're about to reach its rear end, but there's just one more thing I need to show you.

2270
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:34,480
Let's check it out.

2271
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:57,920
Yeah, press the Poof button.

2272
02:03:57,920 --> 02:04:00,100
All right, hold up.

2273
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:02,220
I have some questions.

2274
02:04:02,220 --> 02:04:05,140
Hold up.

2275
02:04:05,140 --> 02:04:11,940
First off, I just, I have to do this because that was brilliant, YYR.

2276
02:04:11,940 --> 02:04:17,940
That was so good that I lost the...

2277
02:04:17,940 --> 02:04:21,700
I no longer regret any of the words that have ever come out of my mouth.

2278
02:04:21,700 --> 02:04:23,040
You don't regret any of this shit?

2279
02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:25,040
Is that what you're saying?

2280
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:26,040
No.

2281
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:27,040
Okay.

2282
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:28,040
I...

2283
02:04:28,040 --> 02:04:29,040
Yeah.

2284
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:30,040
Okay.

2285
02:04:30,040 --> 02:04:37,360
So, am I understanding correctly that Bobby actually made the correct prediction apparently

2286
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:42,480
in chat and said this some time ago, that Loki's secret project was so secretive because

2287
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:45,680
it kind of like was only part his idea.

2288
02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:49,760
So Pixel Poops number two is your game, Loki?

2289
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:50,760
It is my game.

2290
02:04:50,760 --> 02:04:52,000
And so here's that.

2291
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:53,000
So here's how it started out.

2292
02:04:53,000 --> 02:05:01,720
So I decided like a while back, like I ran across, like I wanted to make a Nintendo game.

2293
02:05:01,720 --> 02:05:02,720
Hold up.

2294
02:05:02,720 --> 02:05:03,720
Hold up.

2295
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:04,720
YYR, you get on Discord right now.

2296
02:05:04,720 --> 02:05:06,600
I know I said the end of the show.

2297
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:11,680
You get on Discord right now because you didn't prepare me for that one.

2298
02:05:11,680 --> 02:05:12,680
That's not fair.

2299
02:05:12,680 --> 02:05:13,680
It feels like my birthday.

2300
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:18,200
It feels like my birthday.

2301
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:19,200
It is.

2302
02:05:19,200 --> 02:05:20,200
It's your late birthday.

2303
02:05:20,200 --> 02:05:21,200
Join any of the rooms, YYR.

2304
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:22,200
I'll pull you in.

2305
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:23,400
Okay.

2306
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:24,720
So he says he's updating.

2307
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:25,720
I'm sorry, Loki.

2308
02:05:25,720 --> 02:05:26,720
You can continue.

2309
02:05:26,720 --> 02:05:27,720
Okay.

2310
02:05:27,720 --> 02:05:33,080
So like, so what it was is that I found the software like called Nest Maker, which is

2311
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:39,160
basically it's a kind of a front end to start making Nintendo games, like actual Nintendo

2312
02:05:39,160 --> 02:05:40,160
games.

2313
02:05:40,160 --> 02:05:45,920
Granted, the stuff I'm doing, there's a lot of assembly coding, so I had to learn 6502

2314
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:50,200
assembler to be able to start doing this, but it's kind of a friend to help you starting

2315
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:51,420
not from scratch.

2316
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:54,300
So I needed a simple project to do with this.

2317
02:05:54,300 --> 02:06:02,980
So I thought, okay, I can remake the original Pixel Boost because it's a pretty simple game

2318
02:06:02,980 --> 02:06:09,300
and that'll help me learn this Nest Maker stuff.

2319
02:06:09,300 --> 02:06:11,620
But then I decided I wanted to go ahead and do a sequel.

2320
02:06:11,620 --> 02:06:17,360
So then I like, I kept working on it and originally my plan was I was just going to put it out

2321
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:23,000
and say, look, I made this and then like surprise everybody, including YYR, but then I couldn't

2322
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,400
like keep it a secret.

2323
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:28,600
So I had to show him and then he decided, Hey, he's all, Oh, well, I'm also working

2324
02:06:28,600 --> 02:06:29,600
on this.

2325
02:06:29,600 --> 02:06:34,360
And then we decided that we're going to kind of work together to do different things.

2326
02:06:34,360 --> 02:06:40,400
So like I've been working on this completely separate from him, but yeah, it's, it's a

2327
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:41,400
Nintendo game.

2328
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:47,960
As you saw, it is two players simultaneously, tons of different levels in there, lots of

2329
02:06:47,960 --> 02:06:53,040
different like themes and stuff, and it's coming along.

2330
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:54,040
All right.

2331
02:06:54,040 --> 02:06:58,800
YYR is here by the way, and he's, he's audio, you're just audio only tonight cause I'm trying

2332
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:00,360
to fix the disc, but that's okay.

2333
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:03,000
If you're just going to stay audio only, then I don't need to fix it.

2334
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Yeah.

2335
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,000
You don't want to see me.

2336
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
I'm not wearing a shirt right now.

2337
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Okay.

2338
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09,000
That's fine.

2339
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Keep it off.

2340
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Keep it off.

2341
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:12,600
The webcam is going to look a little messed up.

2342
02:07:12,600 --> 02:07:13,600
Sorry.

2343
02:07:13,600 --> 02:07:14,600
During this point, let me just go back.

2344
02:07:14,600 --> 02:07:15,600
I'll go back to here.

2345
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:16,600
You don't have to see me.

2346
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:20,480
You can look at, uh, dark soccer, the game idea and Loki, the game maker, which is the,

2347
02:07:20,480 --> 02:07:26,200
uh, the big gag that we're all just kinda, uh, getting here is that Loki secret game.

2348
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:27,800
When did you find out about this YYR?

2349
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:30,600
So you've known about Loki secret game project for awhile.

2350
02:07:30,600 --> 02:07:37,280
And I got, I gotta say with all respect to your game, YYR, you went for a very like kind

2351
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:39,240
of old school aesthetic with it.

2352
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:42,320
It was a very like Atari 2,600 looking thing.

2353
02:07:42,320 --> 02:07:47,500
And then when I look at what Loki did, I'm like, this is like way different, but this

2354
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:53,380
is like what I would logically expect a graphical upgrade of this sort to look like, if that

2355
02:07:53,380 --> 02:07:54,380
makes sense.

2356
02:07:54,380 --> 02:07:55,380
Oh yeah.

2357
02:07:55,380 --> 02:07:56,600
He really nailed the aesthetic.

2358
02:07:56,600 --> 02:08:01,640
I the first, that was what I was going for too, yeah.

2359
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:03,500
And yes, Bobby, you did call it.

2360
02:08:03,500 --> 02:08:05,880
It was right before the direct started.

2361
02:08:05,880 --> 02:08:10,440
He was like, I bet it's actually a YYR game.

2362
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:12,720
And I felt I had to respond in chat.

2363
02:08:12,720 --> 02:08:14,560
Otherwise people would get suspicious.

2364
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:16,120
So I was like, that's a stretch.

2365
02:08:16,120 --> 02:08:17,120
What are you talking about?

2366
02:08:17,120 --> 02:08:22,720
Well, and to be fair, he had kind of put that out there before when Loki wouldn't talk about

2367
02:08:22,720 --> 02:08:24,080
it for weeks and weeks.

2368
02:08:24,080 --> 02:08:27,600
He's like, he's not talking about it cause it's not, it's someone else's game that he's

2369
02:08:27,600 --> 02:08:28,600
making.

2370
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:31,120
And I kind of like, and I honestly, I brushed it off.

2371
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:32,960
I was like, what, whose game would he be making?

2372
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:34,360
That doesn't make any sense.

2373
02:08:34,360 --> 02:08:38,140
And now, now that I know it, it's like, Oh my God, of course that, that, that shit was

2374
02:08:38,140 --> 02:08:40,240
right in front of my face the whole time.

2375
02:08:40,240 --> 02:08:43,960
So amazing, amazing work YYR.

2376
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:47,880
So some folks in chat are saying, I need to see that trailer right now.

2377
02:08:47,880 --> 02:08:48,880
And I've got you.

2378
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:50,880
I'll hook you up in just a sec.

2379
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:51,880
Oh, actually.

2380
02:08:51,880 --> 02:08:52,880
Yeah.

2381
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:53,880
Oh, okay.

2382
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:54,880
I mean, I have it on YouTube.

2383
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:58,600
It's going to go live at midnight Eastern, 9 PM Pacific.

2384
02:08:58,600 --> 02:09:02,920
And I will post a link if the show is not over by then I'll post a link in chat.

2385
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:07,840
Otherwise it'll be on my Twitter, but, uh, if, if you uploaded it also go right ahead.

2386
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:10,840
I just feel like this is the best Hanukkah present ever.

2387
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:12,340
It's seven nights of shit.

2388
02:09:12,340 --> 02:09:15,400
I was just about to, I was about to say dark soccer.

2389
02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:18,400
This whole thing came out of your mouth in the beginning.

2390
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:19,400
And how do you feel now?

2391
02:09:19,400 --> 02:09:20,800
I know I'm already full of shit.

2392
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:24,800
Well, but how do you feel knowing not only is it a YYR thing, but this, this is that

2393
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:30,800
big mystery you're, you're going to have to buy the man a pizza.

2394
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:37,120
By the way, by the way, I'd like to mention that, um, it's also going to be on cartridge.

2395
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:38,120
I have cartridges.

2396
02:09:38,120 --> 02:09:41,120
How are you doing that?

2397
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:43,600
I require this to be in my life.

2398
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:44,600
Yeah.

2399
02:09:44,600 --> 02:09:48,680
So, so I have a ROM burner and I've got a cartridges or at least a few.

2400
02:09:48,680 --> 02:09:52,540
I did a very limited run of those, but, um, I've got that.

2401
02:09:52,540 --> 02:09:55,240
So once I'm done, I, it will be on physical cartridges.

2402
02:09:55,240 --> 02:09:56,240
I'm sorry.

2403
02:09:56,240 --> 02:09:57,240
I'm just going to change the shot.

2404
02:09:57,240 --> 02:09:59,840
So you can all see how shocked I am right now.

2405
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:00,840
Like what?

2406
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:07,240
Like Loki just fucking started limited run games too in his basement for his new project.

2407
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:09,800
What the hell?

2408
02:10:09,800 --> 02:10:10,800
This is crazy.

2409
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:16,080
But I'm not, I'm never going to be quiet again.

2410
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:19,000
Never the first shit that comes to my mind.

2411
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,760
You never were dark soccer.

2412
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:26,560
Let's and that's, that's why we love you and why this show has lasted as long as it has.

2413
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:27,560
So, okay.

2414
02:10:27,560 --> 02:10:33,160
So why we are like, I'm going to be honest, the first part and everything, I kind of expected

2415
02:10:33,160 --> 02:10:34,160
that.

2416
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:36,680
I was like, okay, he's talked about pixel poops going to steam before.

2417
02:10:36,680 --> 02:10:37,680
Okay.

2418
02:10:37,680 --> 02:10:38,840
New game modes.

2419
02:10:38,840 --> 02:10:44,180
Super cool, but like a very Y Y R thing, like a, like a patent thing for your games.

2420
02:10:44,180 --> 02:10:46,040
You have all these different modes.

2421
02:10:46,040 --> 02:10:50,700
You've done that since the snake 360 day it's state snake 360 days and it's continued in

2422
02:10:50,700 --> 02:10:52,160
things like super multitasking.

2423
02:10:52,160 --> 02:10:55,160
It's like, you can do the multitasking all at once.

2424
02:10:55,160 --> 02:10:57,160
You can do the multitasking very easy.

2425
02:10:57,160 --> 02:10:59,200
You can do the multitasking with challenges, right?

2426
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:04,560
So like that part, I was like, okay, this is, you know, I'm with it, but now talk me

2427
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:09,360
through like the Commodore 64, like where the hell did that come from?

2428
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:15,200
Well, so, and it's funny because this, this whole thing started as, as he mentioned, Loki

2429
02:11:15,200 --> 02:11:19,480
was working on this thing, unbeknownst to anybody, including me.

2430
02:11:19,480 --> 02:11:21,380
And then, uh, what was that?

2431
02:11:21,380 --> 02:11:26,320
Maybe like five, six weeks ago, you just like sent me a Twitter message and you were like,

2432
02:11:26,320 --> 02:11:33,960
Oh, well, by the way, and, and you sent me an animated GIF and we need to talk about

2433
02:11:33,960 --> 02:11:46,760
intellectual property for a minute, just dump it and release it and it's already dump it.

2434
02:11:46,760 --> 02:11:55,560
But no, I, I saw that I, he got my full endorsement immediately and, um, yeah, it was like, uh,

2435
02:11:56,320 --> 02:12:01,340
I had already been toying with the notion of remaking pixel poops and, and putting it

2436
02:12:01,340 --> 02:12:02,340
on steam.

2437
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:05,280
So this just accelerated the process.

2438
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:09,640
I literally just dropped everything I was doing with, you know, super multitasking and

2439
02:12:09,640 --> 02:12:10,640
anything else.

2440
02:12:10,640 --> 02:12:13,360
I'm like, yeah, you know what, let's do this.

2441
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:16,640
And it, it took me a weekend to make the original game.

2442
02:12:16,640 --> 02:12:20,600
It took me a month to port it to what I'm currently using.

2443
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:24,800
And I mean, granted a lot of that was because when I made it, I didn't have a daughter.

2444
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:31,800
Um, uh, I was also like, you know, just kind of throwing it together, not publishing it,

2445
02:12:31,800 --> 02:12:36,320
not really planning around any of the menus or anything that I'm planning on putting in

2446
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:37,320
it.

2447
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:41,640
But yeah, it, uh, it took a lot longer to, to put that together.

2448
02:12:41,640 --> 02:12:47,080
And uh, yeah, as far as the extra stuff, uh, I don't know if anyone noticed only people

2449
02:12:47,080 --> 02:12:52,880
that played games on Atari VCS would notice this, um, the toggling of the difficulty and

2450
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:54,520
the toggling of the time attack mode.

2451
02:12:54,520 --> 02:13:00,240
That is a direct reference to the difficulty A and difficulty B switches on the console

2452
02:13:00,240 --> 02:13:01,240
itself.

2453
02:13:01,240 --> 02:13:04,960
I did pick up the way you were saying that like at 16 different gate was a very much

2454
02:13:04,960 --> 02:13:06,720
like an Atari 2600 thing.

2455
02:13:06,720 --> 02:13:08,360
Like that would have been on the box art.

2456
02:13:08,360 --> 02:13:15,080
In fact, I don't want to volunteer Dark Sakura for anything, but I think one way to bring

2457
02:13:15,080 --> 02:13:19,360
this full circle there, and I don't even know if this is something that's really in your

2458
02:13:19,360 --> 02:13:22,720
wheelhouse Dark Sakura, but no, not well, yes.

2459
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:29,560
That's, that's a given, but like we need classic Atari, 2,600 box art with the thing that says,

2460
02:13:29,560 --> 02:13:33,200
you know, 16 games that might be, that might be outside your wheelhouse, dark soccer, I

2461
02:13:33,200 --> 02:13:38,240
don't know, but we need to like commission it or something and I'm willing to do it.

2462
02:13:38,240 --> 02:13:39,520
You know, I could do it.

2463
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:40,520
Okay.

2464
02:13:40,520 --> 02:13:45,760
I mean, I'd have to break out like my color pencils and do a really fine art shit, but

2465
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:47,040
I just, yeah, it was great.

2466
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:51,280
And by the way, I lost it cause the chat is bringing up to, I lost it at that text tax

2467
02:13:51,280 --> 02:13:53,200
collector being named feces.

2468
02:13:53,200 --> 02:13:54,200
Feces.

2469
02:13:54,200 --> 02:14:02,120
Now, Loki, did you know about all of the other Pixel Poop stuff or was this all new to you?

2470
02:14:02,120 --> 02:14:05,200
Did you know about the Pixel Poop 64 where he's actually squatting?

2471
02:14:05,200 --> 02:14:06,200
Yes.

2472
02:14:06,200 --> 02:14:07,200
That killed me.

2473
02:14:07,200 --> 02:14:08,200
Yes.

2474
02:14:08,200 --> 02:14:09,200
Yes, I did.

2475
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:15,640
And, um, I I've actually seen the direct already, but like, um, yeah, he had told me that he

2476
02:14:15,640 --> 02:14:18,920
was working on the Commodore 64 version and the Steam version stuff.

2477
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:24,000
I didn't know about like the, like enhancements or like all of the enhancements and stuff,

2478
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:30,640
but, uh, and I hadn't actually seen the Commodore 64 version, but until today and I'll interject

2479
02:14:30,640 --> 02:14:37,360
the Commodore version existing is a direct result of Pixel Poop's number two existing

2480
02:14:37,360 --> 02:14:40,040
and me saying, you know what?

2481
02:14:40,040 --> 02:14:41,560
That sounds like fun.

2482
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:43,080
Let me try also.

2483
02:14:43,080 --> 02:14:49,280
And what I did was I busted out the same exact Gary kitchens game maker that I was using

2484
02:14:49,280 --> 02:14:55,280
to make games when I was eight and nine and 10 years old and I loaded it up on an emulator

2485
02:14:55,280 --> 02:14:57,440
and I got to work.

2486
02:14:57,440 --> 02:14:58,440
Wow.

2487
02:14:58,440 --> 02:14:59,660
It's awesome.

2488
02:14:59,660 --> 02:15:04,560
It's just the fact that you're shitting on multi platforms is just killing me.

2489
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:06,440
It's it's amazing.

2490
02:15:06,440 --> 02:15:07,440
Okay.

2491
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:12,680
I, I have to see this trailer for the Loki project one more time because I wasn't ready

2492
02:15:12,680 --> 02:15:13,800
for it.

2493
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:17,400
So now I need to watch it one more time now that I have it in my mind.

2494
02:15:17,400 --> 02:15:19,560
So I think what I can do, and I'm doing this live on the fly.

2495
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:20,560
Sorry guys.

2496
02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:24,080
But I think what I can do if I actually think the movie, I think I can fast forward ahead

2497
02:15:24,080 --> 02:15:25,080
a little bit here.

2498
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:33,240
So here's where, okay, the new game because I can't really go into more details about

2499
02:15:33,240 --> 02:15:35,200
that either because that would give stuff away.

2500
02:15:35,200 --> 02:15:51,920
So I, I can't say anything because I can't say any more.

2501
02:15:51,920 --> 02:15:52,920
I was, I was so shocked.

2502
02:15:52,920 --> 02:15:53,920
I wasn't even thinking of something.

2503
02:15:53,920 --> 02:16:02,920
I like the people are actually turning around and there's two, it's a two player game.

2504
02:16:02,920 --> 02:16:03,920
Yep.

2505
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:22,840
And you like a basic fresh in when they're pooping, that's my favorite I'm dying.

2506
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:27,720
So here's, here's, so here's my, my next question.

2507
02:16:27,720 --> 02:16:33,520
If I don't want to play that on a Nintendo, are you doing like a steam release or something?

2508
02:16:33,520 --> 02:16:42,680
Well, it's supposed to be DLC on the actual pixel poofs one that YR is doing.

2509
02:16:42,680 --> 02:16:48,280
So you'll be able to, I think it's still going to be a ROM file.

2510
02:16:48,280 --> 02:16:54,360
There is a way to convert it so that you can play it, you can actually upload it to steam.

2511
02:16:54,360 --> 02:16:58,360
So there is a way to do that for NES ROM files.

2512
02:16:58,360 --> 02:17:03,000
I mean, basically what it's doing is it's just including an emulator so that you double

2513
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:07,800
click the game in your library and it launches the NES emulator in the game automatically.

2514
02:17:07,800 --> 02:17:09,840
All right.

2515
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:15,160
And Bobby, there are low key, there are a lot of people asking in chat about the cartridge.

2516
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:16,760
Like people are freaking out.

2517
02:17:16,760 --> 02:17:17,760
Yeah.

2518
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:21,760
Like I didn't get many, like I said, cause you know, cartridges are not cheap.

2519
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:24,960
So I have six, Oh my God right now.

2520
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:29,400
But I mean, that's just because I didn't want to like go all in with like a hundred of them

2521
02:17:29,400 --> 02:17:30,400
or something.

2522
02:17:30,400 --> 02:17:32,520
Let me hold on a second.

2523
02:17:32,520 --> 02:17:35,200
So how much do these cartridges run?

2524
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:42,840
I don't remember off the hand, I think it's like at least, I think 15 for the board and

2525
02:17:42,840 --> 02:17:43,840
I don't remember.

2526
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:48,480
I'd have to look at my own voices, but basically, so like it's got, it's even got the sleeve,

2527
02:17:48,480 --> 02:17:49,480
which is kind of cool.

2528
02:17:49,480 --> 02:17:51,640
So these are from France.

2529
02:17:51,640 --> 02:17:55,560
So they've got the actual, this is empty.

2530
02:17:55,560 --> 02:17:59,880
So I actually have the boards right here.

2531
02:17:59,880 --> 02:18:04,320
So I've got the actual, this is a mapper 30 board.

2532
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:08,360
It's green screening out cause it's a green board, but that's all right.

2533
02:18:08,360 --> 02:18:09,360
It's fine.

2534
02:18:09,360 --> 02:18:10,880
Well, it's a mapper 30 board.

2535
02:18:10,880 --> 02:18:14,040
It's got, um, I don't know how to necessarily do it yet.

2536
02:18:14,040 --> 02:18:18,260
Cause like I said, I'm still kind of new to the nest of stuff, but it has flash memory

2537
02:18:18,260 --> 02:18:22,560
on it instead of member, like the old Zelda and stuff like that, where it actually had

2538
02:18:22,560 --> 02:18:25,700
saved memory, but it had like an actual battery on it.

2539
02:18:25,700 --> 02:18:29,120
This is flash memory now, but it operates in the same manner as that.

2540
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:33,640
So you could potentially, if I'm good enough to do that, um, have a high score table or

2541
02:18:33,640 --> 02:18:34,640
something like that.

2542
02:18:34,640 --> 02:18:35,640
Wow.

2543
02:18:35,640 --> 02:18:38,560
I may, may try to add if I get a point to do that.

2544
02:18:38,560 --> 02:18:44,760
Um, but the mean, you know, right now I wanted to get like the basic, so it's been a challenge

2545
02:18:44,760 --> 02:18:49,640
obviously with the NES, cause you have to fit everything into the ROM size there.

2546
02:18:49,640 --> 02:18:56,400
So, um, I have, well, I have an original soundtrack of three songs that I had commissioned done

2547
02:18:56,400 --> 02:19:00,760
by this guy, cosmic gem, who does a lot of mega man fan games, as you might've noticed

2548
02:19:00,760 --> 02:19:05,040
that sounds kind of mega man-ish in the trailer.

2549
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:06,660
I didn't even think about that music.

2550
02:19:06,660 --> 02:19:09,320
I just figured you lifted it from free music archive or something.

2551
02:19:09,320 --> 02:19:11,040
No, no, no, no.

2552
02:19:11,040 --> 02:19:12,040
Completely original.

2553
02:19:12,040 --> 02:19:15,040
Oh my God.

2554
02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:19,280
We're going to be able to have like an OLR soundtrack between what Jamie does, what you

2555
02:19:19,280 --> 02:19:20,280
do.

2556
02:19:20,280 --> 02:19:24,880
And by the way, there's a gag coming up at about like 10 minutes when it comes to music

2557
02:19:24,880 --> 02:19:29,240
and this show that you get, you guys know what I'm talking about, that email we got

2558
02:19:29,240 --> 02:19:30,240
last week.

2559
02:19:30,240 --> 02:19:35,320
And when I heard that I was like, Oh my God, this is so much talent around the OLR universe

2560
02:19:35,320 --> 02:19:36,320
is crazy.

2561
02:19:36,320 --> 02:19:38,000
So there is one song.

2562
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:42,240
So there there's three songs, the title song and two levels songs that commission from

2563
02:19:42,240 --> 02:19:47,000
somebody that to do those, um, you already have a more diverse soundtrack than dragon

2564
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:48,000
quest 11.

2565
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:49,960
Good job.

2566
02:19:49,960 --> 02:19:52,520
And then there is another song that was one of those.

2567
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:55,220
It was on, uh, the open game art sites.

2568
02:19:55,220 --> 02:19:58,780
So it's a, it's a, uh, creative commons, but it's another song.

2569
02:19:58,780 --> 02:20:03,560
So that's, that's all I could fit in my audio because like I had to create, you know, sound

2570
02:20:03,560 --> 02:20:05,360
effects for all the poop sound effects.

2571
02:20:05,360 --> 02:20:07,780
So some of the fun things that are in the game.

2572
02:20:07,780 --> 02:20:11,800
So like for example, the pause screen, you can still move your character or you can move

2573
02:20:11,800 --> 02:20:15,640
your characters in place so you can actually like dance around and stuff like that.

2574
02:20:15,640 --> 02:20:17,040
And the pause screen is just kind of fun.

2575
02:20:17,040 --> 02:20:21,840
And then at the end of when you beat a level, you actually goes into this little celebration

2576
02:20:21,880 --> 02:20:26,240
animation, but you can also move around and then do like the, the funny squatting things.

2577
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:27,240
Cause I love that face.

2578
02:20:27,240 --> 02:20:31,160
The face is hilarious and it's just funny to do that.

2579
02:20:31,160 --> 02:20:36,920
So, um, yeah, there's lots of little Easter eggs.

2580
02:20:36,920 --> 02:20:39,800
I may have thrown some cheat codes in there as well.

2581
02:20:39,800 --> 02:20:40,800
Oh my God.

2582
02:20:40,800 --> 02:20:41,800
Okay.

2583
02:20:41,800 --> 02:20:42,800
I'm sorry.

2584
02:20:42,800 --> 02:20:47,480
This is running so long, but like y'all blindsided me with this and her.

2585
02:20:47,480 --> 02:20:51,320
Now I understand why I got that message from YYR that was like, you're probably gonna want

2586
02:20:51,320 --> 02:20:56,560
to talk to me right after errors, like for two bucks a pop, by the way.

2587
02:20:56,560 --> 02:20:57,560
Oh my gosh.

2588
02:20:57,560 --> 02:20:58,560
All right.

2589
02:20:58,560 --> 02:21:03,000
So anyway, w the cartridge thing, Loki, you'll have to figure that out on your own.

2590
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:08,560
Obviously I was thinking it was, I have to look, but I was trying to target someone cause

2591
02:21:08,560 --> 02:21:12,360
I also still have to do label printing and all that and packaging.

2592
02:21:12,360 --> 02:21:15,360
So I was targeting somewhere around 40 bucks, but I don't know.

2593
02:21:15,360 --> 02:21:16,360
Yeah.

2594
02:21:16,360 --> 02:21:20,260
I have to, there's easily at least five people in chat that are going to pay that right now.

2595
02:21:20,260 --> 02:21:26,140
If not, if not more than that person sitting in this chair who will, I would say, go ahead,

2596
02:21:26,140 --> 02:21:27,140
open pre-orders.

2597
02:21:27,140 --> 02:21:31,060
I mean, get a number so that you know how many you need to be fair.

2598
02:21:31,060 --> 02:21:33,700
He says he hasn't completed the, I love how we're just talking.

2599
02:21:33,700 --> 02:21:34,700
Now.

2600
02:21:34,700 --> 02:21:35,700
We're all your managers, Loki.

2601
02:21:35,700 --> 02:21:36,700
All right.

2602
02:21:36,700 --> 02:21:40,080
So he says he hasn't completed the process yet and hasn't done it.

2603
02:21:40,080 --> 02:21:43,960
So let him get through that whole process to make sure it's, you know, error free and

2604
02:21:43,960 --> 02:21:46,220
he has it the way he likes it.

2605
02:21:46,220 --> 02:21:49,420
Then open up the pre-orders cause you don't want to end up on that Kickstarter thing where

2606
02:21:49,420 --> 02:21:53,340
you're like, I'm going to get all this money for this thing that I fucked up and I can't

2607
02:21:53,340 --> 02:21:54,340
make it.

2608
02:21:54,340 --> 02:21:55,340
So exactly.

2609
02:21:55,340 --> 02:21:58,860
And as Bobby puts out, let, let me make one exactly.

2610
02:21:58,860 --> 02:22:00,620
And that's definitely the goal.

2611
02:22:00,620 --> 02:22:03,980
I still have to learn the, how to do, I've got all the hardware to do.

2612
02:22:03,980 --> 02:22:08,060
I just have to learn the process and it's the, what's great though is like, if you are

2613
02:22:08,060 --> 02:22:14,680
interested in this software, so nest maker is, um, what I, I started off using granted.

2614
02:22:14,680 --> 02:22:17,760
You can build an NES game without coding.

2615
02:22:17,760 --> 02:22:22,200
If you want a grant, it's going to be incredibly basic, but you could do that.

2616
02:22:22,200 --> 02:22:23,720
Um, and I highly recommend it.

2617
02:22:23,720 --> 02:22:25,720
It's like 40 bucks for the software.

2618
02:22:25,720 --> 02:22:30,000
Granted the stuff I'm doing now I'm completely, there's not a lot of documentation.

2619
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:34,200
They do a good job with like some tutorial videos, but it's a lot of intro stuff, like

2620
02:22:34,200 --> 02:22:35,480
really beginner things.

2621
02:22:35,480 --> 02:22:39,700
So a lot of stuff I'm having to learn on the fly and figure out how this stuff works.

2622
02:22:39,700 --> 02:22:43,660
So I'm like rewriting a lot of their like input systems and stuff like that.

2623
02:22:43,660 --> 02:22:48,580
So you can get and do some pretty complicated things out there, but like it is definitely

2624
02:22:48,580 --> 02:22:50,540
a fun tool to play around with.

2625
02:22:50,540 --> 02:22:55,460
Uh, so if you go to the new eight bit heroes, uh, dot com, they sell and that's maker there.

2626
02:22:55,460 --> 02:23:00,000
There's a link to, you can get started with like the actual hardware, like burning a cart.

2627
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:04,980
I did my first cart through there, um, cause it came with the actual writer.

2628
02:23:04,980 --> 02:23:10,260
Um, but then the other like five additional ones I tried through this French site, um,

2629
02:23:10,260 --> 02:23:11,260
that just opened up.

2630
02:23:11,260 --> 02:23:18,340
So, um, but I, like I said, I, I'd have to price it out, but, um, yeah, I highly recommend

2631
02:23:18,340 --> 02:23:19,340
checking it out.

2632
02:23:19,340 --> 02:23:20,340
It's a lot of fun.

2633
02:23:20,340 --> 02:23:22,260
I mean, I've had a lot of fun putting it together.

2634
02:23:22,260 --> 02:23:23,820
Um, definitely.

2635
02:23:23,820 --> 02:23:28,980
I'm finally glad I can talk about it now, no progress, cause it's like, I was like,

2636
02:23:28,980 --> 02:23:30,660
I need to tell somebody.

2637
02:23:30,660 --> 02:23:34,900
Um, but yeah, it's, it's been ongoing.

2638
02:23:34,900 --> 02:23:38,220
Like um, was it this, uh, why we are seeing you earlier?

2639
02:23:38,220 --> 02:23:41,980
He's like, yeah, I don't like, you know, the direction thing's not working well.

2640
02:23:41,980 --> 02:23:43,660
He needs to move diagonal and stuff like that.

2641
02:23:43,660 --> 02:23:48,740
So I have to rewrite the input system to allow that, but I finally learned how to do that.

2642
02:23:48,740 --> 02:23:49,740
It's all assembly.

2643
02:23:49,740 --> 02:23:57,780
Like I've never programmed in assembly before, but yeah, it's, and it's just a lot of challenges

2644
02:23:57,780 --> 02:24:00,020
cramming it all in that ROM size.

2645
02:24:00,020 --> 02:24:01,020
Cramming all that shit in there.

2646
02:24:01,020 --> 02:24:03,020
Um, did that a documentary?

2647
02:24:03,020 --> 02:24:04,020
Yeah.

2648
02:24:04,020 --> 02:24:05,160
Yeah, it is.

2649
02:24:05,160 --> 02:24:07,380
So yeah, mystic searches is his game that he's got.

2650
02:24:07,380 --> 02:24:08,380
He did a documentary.

2651
02:24:08,380 --> 02:24:09,380
It's on Amazon.

2652
02:24:09,380 --> 02:24:13,260
Um, great community on their Etsy too.

2653
02:24:13,260 --> 02:24:14,260
Yeah.

2654
02:24:14,260 --> 02:24:15,260
Yeah.

2655
02:24:15,260 --> 02:24:16,260
It's a, it's a great community.

2656
02:24:16,260 --> 02:24:20,340
There's lots of nest maker games out there that people, then there's some guys, um, like

2657
02:24:20,340 --> 02:24:25,400
there's a cutter cross on there that they have some really like crazy games that they've

2658
02:24:25,400 --> 02:24:26,400
made with it.

2659
02:24:26,400 --> 02:24:28,220
Like there's one they're doing right now.

2660
02:24:28,220 --> 02:24:33,100
It's a point and click adventure game and they've actually gotten, I don't know how

2661
02:24:33,100 --> 02:24:38,380
they did it, but they've gotten the, the super NES Mario paint mouse to work with it

2662
02:24:38,380 --> 02:24:39,380
on an NES.

2663
02:24:39,380 --> 02:24:40,380
I don't know.

2664
02:24:40,380 --> 02:24:45,540
It's just some crazy stuff, but like the whole, you know, nest dev seems pretty cool.

2665
02:24:45,540 --> 02:24:52,220
Um, so definitely go check it out, but, um, yeah, it's, I'm definitely excited about it.

2666
02:24:52,220 --> 02:24:53,540
I'm still working on it.

2667
02:24:53,540 --> 02:24:56,220
I'm trying to get it done this year.

2668
02:24:56,220 --> 02:24:58,540
Um, I'm shooting for this year.

2669
02:24:58,540 --> 02:25:01,780
You know, something I was going to say, like, you know, and you've been talking about, oh,

2670
02:25:01,780 --> 02:25:03,060
I finally got the playable loop.

2671
02:25:03,060 --> 02:25:04,060
I've got all this.

2672
02:25:04,060 --> 02:25:08,100
And when I look at that footage, I'm like, oh my God, this really is like done.

2673
02:25:08,100 --> 02:25:13,180
Like this isn't like the time to car thing where you, it was not really like, like you

2674
02:25:13,180 --> 02:25:16,020
had an idea there, but it wasn't like really fleshed out.

2675
02:25:16,020 --> 02:25:17,060
And I'm looking at it.

2676
02:25:17,060 --> 02:25:22,160
I'm looking at this and I'm like, this is, this is ready.

2677
02:25:22,160 --> 02:25:25,180
It's because I did it the right way this time.

2678
02:25:25,180 --> 02:25:26,180
I did.

2679
02:25:26,180 --> 02:25:27,180
Yay.

2680
02:25:27,180 --> 02:25:28,180
Good job.

2681
02:25:28,180 --> 02:25:35,780
And you, you could say, see, Bobby's been yelling at you for, since day one, you need

2682
02:25:35,780 --> 02:25:41,020
to make a game based on an existing game.

2683
02:25:41,020 --> 02:25:44,500
So we're like trying to figure out the storyline for this game.

2684
02:25:44,500 --> 02:25:48,540
I still haven't quite figured that out and I get it, but like, there's not really a story

2685
02:25:48,540 --> 02:25:54,460
to it, but like, like we've, I've run across like so many like dumb ideas and I'm definitely

2686
02:25:54,460 --> 02:25:58,380
going to go with the dumbest of them whenever I figure out what that is.

2687
02:25:58,380 --> 02:26:03,660
It's just like, like, oh yeah, you know, one of them was like something about like that,

2688
02:26:03,660 --> 02:26:07,540
the taco stands were actually like, they've taken over the world.

2689
02:26:07,540 --> 02:26:08,700
There's so many of them.

2690
02:26:08,700 --> 02:26:14,180
That's why you see in like one of the then the trailer there, there's one in a graveyard,

2691
02:26:14,180 --> 02:26:16,380
you know, there's, there's your taco stands.

2692
02:26:16,380 --> 02:26:20,020
Like they actually have to be the Crips.

2693
02:26:20,020 --> 02:26:21,940
So it's just ridiculous stuff like that.

2694
02:26:21,940 --> 02:26:23,700
And yeah, there's like different characters.

2695
02:26:23,740 --> 02:26:25,500
So like there's the ghost you saw there.

2696
02:26:25,500 --> 02:26:28,940
I don't have an infant mind yet, but it's going to disappear.

2697
02:26:28,940 --> 02:26:33,460
And so it'll be invisible and you have to like a capture or I'm going to, I started

2698
02:26:33,460 --> 02:26:44,220
doing like a dog that actually eats the smaller pieces of, so like, you know, strange stuff

2699
02:26:44,220 --> 02:26:45,220
like that.

2700
02:26:45,220 --> 02:26:49,140
But yeah, it's, I, like I said, the segment has gone on a very long time, but I'm sorry.

2701
02:26:49,140 --> 02:26:56,020
I'm blown away because I just did not realize that you two were going to essentially buddy

2702
02:26:56,020 --> 02:27:00,820
up in a way and really deliver on this idea.

2703
02:27:00,820 --> 02:27:03,420
And of course not to, I know we're really focusing on Loki's game, but that's because

2704
02:27:03,420 --> 02:27:07,000
that's been a central plot of this show for like the past year.

2705
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:12,180
So to have it just, you know, subtly revealed as a one more thing here is, is I wasn't prepared

2706
02:27:12,180 --> 02:27:13,180
for that.

2707
02:27:13,180 --> 02:27:14,180
Thank you.

2708
02:27:14,180 --> 02:27:17,300
But certainly not to overshadow what you're doing on your own to YYR is that, you know,

2709
02:27:17,300 --> 02:27:20,620
again, the Commodore 64, you've got the sound effects in there.

2710
02:27:20,620 --> 02:27:23,820
You're still charging, not nearly enough money for it.

2711
02:27:23,820 --> 02:27:27,420
And the world is going to thank you for it.

2712
02:27:27,420 --> 02:27:29,100
This is, this is great.

2713
02:27:29,100 --> 02:27:36,020
I, you know, I, it's, this is funny because, uh, it's dark soccer's idea.

2714
02:27:36,020 --> 02:27:39,700
YYR made the game, Loki made the new game.

2715
02:27:39,700 --> 02:27:43,740
I did literally nothing on this.

2716
02:27:43,740 --> 02:27:45,580
I still promoted.

2717
02:27:45,580 --> 02:27:46,580
I guess so.

2718
02:27:46,580 --> 02:27:50,340
I still feel like there's a part of me.

2719
02:27:50,340 --> 02:27:59,620
That's so excited about like, I had a hand in this somehow.

2720
02:27:59,620 --> 02:28:00,620
I did.

2721
02:28:00,620 --> 02:28:01,620
I had a hand in this somehow.

2722
02:28:01,620 --> 02:28:05,860
So there's, and Bobby Blackwell says I had nothing to do with this, but you were the,

2723
02:28:05,860 --> 02:28:07,460
you were the first to figure it out.

2724
02:28:07,460 --> 02:28:09,380
So you, you know, it's true.

2725
02:28:09,380 --> 02:28:10,380
So anyway.

2726
02:28:10,380 --> 02:28:11,380
Okay.

2727
02:28:11,380 --> 02:28:14,820
I've got to try and move on with the show, obviously says that you had shit to do with

2728
02:28:14,820 --> 02:28:15,820
it.

2729
02:28:16,060 --> 02:28:20,420
Well, obviously we're going to hear more about this in the coming months or really weeks,

2730
02:28:20,420 --> 02:28:26,380
because, uh, you said, I know you said December or January let's set the expectation January.

2731
02:28:26,380 --> 02:28:32,620
I think in order for it to release in December, it would have had to be out before the winter

2732
02:28:32,620 --> 02:28:33,620
sale.

2733
02:28:33,620 --> 02:28:38,740
And like, since, since you have to have the store page completely finished, including

2734
02:28:38,740 --> 02:28:43,500
the trailers, the screenshots, all the texts, everything, and then it has to be in coming

2735
02:28:43,500 --> 02:28:48,020
soon status for two weeks before the game comes out, I would literally have to have

2736
02:28:48,020 --> 02:28:49,020
everything ready.

2737
02:28:49,020 --> 02:28:53,740
And I think two days, it's just not going to happen.

2738
02:28:53,740 --> 02:28:56,740
So it's January.

2739
02:28:56,740 --> 02:29:02,980
And by the way, I have no problem taking a back seat to, I, I was just as blown away

2740
02:29:02,980 --> 02:29:07,100
by what Loki has been doing as anybody else.

2741
02:29:07,100 --> 02:29:09,300
I it's amazing.

2742
02:29:09,300 --> 02:29:12,700
And the graphics are fantastic and the music is great.

2743
02:29:12,700 --> 02:29:16,700
And I can't wait to, well, I have played it in the early version, but I can't wait to

2744
02:29:16,700 --> 02:29:19,140
play the final full thing.

2745
02:29:19,140 --> 02:29:20,180
And it's awesome.

2746
02:29:20,180 --> 02:29:22,820
And I'm honored to be able to publish it.

2747
02:29:22,820 --> 02:29:27,180
He couldn't have done it without you and you couldn't have done it without her.

2748
02:29:27,180 --> 02:29:31,800
So, and I'm just sitting here real happy right now, cause this is all awesome.

2749
02:29:31,800 --> 02:29:35,860
Like I'm just, I, I feel like I'm on ground, the starting ground of this whole thing.

2750
02:29:35,860 --> 02:29:40,220
And I'm just like, I, and people in chat are talking about, they need to speed read that

2751
02:29:40,220 --> 02:29:42,420
at awesome games done quick.

2752
02:29:42,420 --> 02:29:44,880
It's a perfect candidate for the awful games block.

2753
02:29:44,880 --> 02:29:45,880
But we mean that with love.

2754
02:29:45,880 --> 02:29:50,020
The thing is, I don't think it's an awful game, but it would fit in with the Cuso Grande.

2755
02:29:50,020 --> 02:29:59,900
Well, look, if Loki, if Cuso means shit, Loki, YYR, if that game shows up in the awful games

2756
02:29:59,900 --> 02:30:03,520
done quick compliment or insult.

2757
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:04,520
I would be happy.

2758
02:30:04,520 --> 02:30:05,520
I don't care.

2759
02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:06,520
That's what I thought.

2760
02:30:06,520 --> 02:30:09,380
No publicity is bad publicity.

2761
02:30:09,380 --> 02:30:10,380
Exactly.

2762
02:30:11,380 --> 02:30:15,700
I, I'm, I'd be happy that that shit would be getting out in front of more eyeballs and

2763
02:30:15,700 --> 02:30:18,340
Bob Bobby's volunteer to host it.

2764
02:30:18,340 --> 02:30:21,580
So now I really, then I better be the one to speed run it.

2765
02:30:21,580 --> 02:30:22,580
All right.

2766
02:30:25,740 --> 02:30:27,900
I guess I have a new purpose in life.

2767
02:30:27,900 --> 02:30:28,900
Oh my gosh.

2768
02:30:28,900 --> 02:30:29,900
All right.

2769
02:30:29,900 --> 02:30:31,940
Well, we're going to be hearing more and more about this in the coming weeks.

2770
02:30:31,940 --> 02:30:34,300
Cause now look, he gets to openly talk about the project.

2771
02:30:34,300 --> 02:30:36,980
So, and he's talked about some of the things that still need to be done there.

2772
02:30:36,980 --> 02:30:39,900
YYR, please keep us posted for the release date on Steam.

2773
02:30:39,900 --> 02:30:42,820
We're going to do all we can to help you out.

2774
02:30:42,820 --> 02:30:46,620
Please try to, and, and I will help you get into contact with some other podcasts too.

2775
02:30:46,620 --> 02:30:48,620
If you need it, try to get the word out.

2776
02:30:48,620 --> 02:30:53,700
Your games are so fucking good and they deserve to be discovered.

2777
02:30:53,700 --> 02:30:56,940
The success that these indie studios are having, you deserve it as well.

2778
02:30:56,940 --> 02:30:58,580
And this isn't just with the poopy thing.

2779
02:30:58,580 --> 02:31:02,700
This is what super multitasking and all the brilliant things you've done.

2780
02:31:02,700 --> 02:31:04,020
I really hope for the best for you.

2781
02:31:04,020 --> 02:31:05,020
I really do.

2782
02:31:05,020 --> 02:31:06,020
Thank you.

2783
02:31:06,060 --> 02:31:07,060
That's a lot.

2784
02:31:07,060 --> 02:31:08,060
Well, it's, it's well-deserved.

2785
02:31:08,060 --> 02:31:09,060
It's awesome.

2786
02:31:09,060 --> 02:31:10,060
Yeah.

2787
02:31:10,060 --> 02:31:11,060
You're awesome sauce.

2788
02:31:11,060 --> 02:31:12,060
Thanks so much.

2789
02:31:12,060 --> 02:31:13,060
All right.

2790
02:31:13,060 --> 02:31:17,140
Well, I couldn't have done it without all of you.

2791
02:31:17,140 --> 02:31:18,140
Even me?

2792
02:31:18,140 --> 02:31:19,140
Yes.

2793
02:31:19,140 --> 02:31:20,140
Even you Rob.

2794
02:31:20,140 --> 02:31:21,140
Even me.

2795
02:31:21,140 --> 02:31:22,140
All right.

2796
02:31:22,140 --> 02:31:23,140
All right.

2797
02:31:23,140 --> 02:31:24,140
Well, thank you so much.

2798
02:31:24,140 --> 02:31:25,140
Okay.

2799
02:31:25,140 --> 02:31:26,140
I'm going to let you go.

2800
02:31:26,140 --> 02:31:27,140
We're going to hear from you in the coming weeks.

2801
02:31:27,140 --> 02:31:28,140
You'll be back when the game's ready to release.

2802
02:31:28,140 --> 02:31:32,140
When you, when you're ready to do your big dump on Steam.

2803
02:31:32,140 --> 02:31:33,420
These jokes are never going to get old.

2804
02:31:33,420 --> 02:31:34,420
We're 40.

2805
02:31:34,420 --> 02:31:37,100
I'm in my four all in our forties at this point.

2806
02:31:37,100 --> 02:31:38,820
And these jokes are not getting old.

2807
02:31:38,820 --> 02:31:40,820
So there you go.

2808
02:31:40,820 --> 02:31:41,820
All right.

2809
02:31:41,820 --> 02:31:42,820
Take care, buddy.

2810
02:31:42,820 --> 02:31:43,820
I'm going to move back to one of the other channels.

2811
02:31:43,820 --> 02:31:44,820
Have a good one.

2812
02:31:44,820 --> 02:31:45,820
Yup.

2813
02:31:45,820 --> 02:31:46,820
Bye.

2814
02:31:46,820 --> 02:31:50,260
Does anyone actually have a clip of me talking about the pixel shit?

2815
02:31:50,260 --> 02:31:55,620
Because I really don't remember why, why are the first trailer video?

2816
02:31:55,620 --> 02:31:56,620
Yeah.

2817
02:31:56,620 --> 02:31:58,420
I think the original video had it.

2818
02:31:58,420 --> 02:31:59,420
Yeah.

2819
02:31:59,420 --> 02:32:06,380
I'm, I'm like crying from like laughing, but also just like the shock of, of the Loki's

2820
02:32:06,380 --> 02:32:08,260
game was that.

2821
02:32:08,260 --> 02:32:09,260
But it makes so much sense.

2822
02:32:09,260 --> 02:32:16,540
I went from having a really terrible morning with a very hard emotional blow to now riding

2823
02:32:16,540 --> 02:32:18,820
this weird high.

2824
02:32:18,820 --> 02:32:20,300
Some sort of in between.

2825
02:32:20,300 --> 02:32:23,580
I don't, my, my brain's confused on feelings.

2826
02:32:23,580 --> 02:32:24,980
I know it's good.

2827
02:32:24,980 --> 02:32:30,300
It's this weird thing where this show has truly come full circle.

2828
02:32:30,300 --> 02:32:35,760
You know, like we started like talking about gay, I'm talking like it's the last episode.

2829
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:43,220
It's not, but yes, it's one of the things we've, we've looped the loop because now the,

2830
02:32:43,220 --> 02:32:44,220
this really is.

2831
02:32:44,220 --> 02:32:49,300
And what Loki's doing here, this product, I mean, it's one thing when it was YYR's thing,

2832
02:32:49,300 --> 02:32:54,460
because, oh, he's, he's, he's like a listener and he's, he's like outside the bubble, so

2833
02:32:54,460 --> 02:32:55,460
to speak.

2834
02:32:55,460 --> 02:32:59,820
And he's putting out this product and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, but now Loki's a part

2835
02:32:59,820 --> 02:33:00,820
of that too.

2836
02:33:00,820 --> 02:33:06,140
Who's been here since day one on OLR and, and it's like now the show that talks about

2837
02:33:06,140 --> 02:33:09,640
games has essentially in a way produced a game.

2838
02:33:09,640 --> 02:33:14,700
And again, even though I'm the one uploading the MP3s every week, I had nothing to do with

2839
02:33:14,700 --> 02:33:17,140
this.

2840
02:33:17,140 --> 02:33:22,300
And it feels really good.

2841
02:33:22,300 --> 02:33:23,820
I just get to play it.

2842
02:33:23,820 --> 02:33:24,820
That's true.

2843
02:33:24,820 --> 02:33:26,140
Bobby says, Loki hasn't finished it yet.

2844
02:33:26,140 --> 02:33:27,140
That's right.

2845
02:33:27,140 --> 02:33:28,140
We got to give you time.

2846
02:33:28,140 --> 02:33:31,600
The last 10% is the longest 90% or something like that, right?

2847
02:33:31,600 --> 02:33:32,600
So it's content.

2848
02:33:32,600 --> 02:33:33,600
Yeah.

2849
02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:35,100
I have to add all the content.

2850
02:33:35,100 --> 02:33:40,680
That's where I had to like rush to get multiple levels because it was just, well, the first

2851
02:33:40,680 --> 02:33:45,300
level is actually the third level now, but, uh, it's just over and over and over.

2852
02:33:45,300 --> 02:33:50,000
I, I should really, you guys should see like some of the actual things cause like before

2853
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:56,660
each like actual, cause there's worlds technically, um, has like a little like image and stuff.

2854
02:33:56,660 --> 02:33:58,220
And it's, Oh, that's kind of funny.

2855
02:33:58,220 --> 02:33:59,220
Some of that.

2856
02:33:59,220 --> 02:34:00,220
Okay.

2857
02:34:00,220 --> 02:34:02,100
I have one more question and then we got to, we really have to move on with the show cause

2858
02:34:02,100 --> 02:34:03,100
it's almost nine o'clock.

2859
02:34:03,100 --> 02:34:05,140
We're going to have to kind of rapid fire the rest of the show.

2860
02:34:05,140 --> 02:34:12,100
But my question for Loki is, did the music guy know what he was making music for?

2861
02:34:12,100 --> 02:34:13,980
Yes, he did.

2862
02:34:13,980 --> 02:34:14,980
He did.

2863
02:34:15,660 --> 02:34:19,500
I, he, he, he was just cool with it.

2864
02:34:19,500 --> 02:34:23,060
Um, like I told him exactly, I gave him a description of what it was.

2865
02:34:23,060 --> 02:34:25,180
I showed him YYRs game.

2866
02:34:25,180 --> 02:34:31,620
I had already like some of the graphics and everything done or actually, uh, the, the

2867
02:34:31,620 --> 02:34:35,500
animated GIF I sent to YYR, I sent to that guy as well.

2868
02:34:35,500 --> 02:34:38,380
So he well aware of what he was making.

2869
02:34:38,380 --> 02:34:39,380
Wow.

2870
02:34:39,380 --> 02:34:44,840
Um, and funny enough, like I actually, that was an investment bringing him in and a smart

2871
02:34:44,840 --> 02:34:48,600
one because I think that's going to, I think just the music alone there, like YYR said

2872
02:34:48,600 --> 02:34:50,880
is like music is fantastic.

2873
02:34:50,880 --> 02:34:57,560
The music is literally good listening to it in my car every day, like every day been listening

2874
02:34:57,560 --> 02:34:58,560
to it in my car.

2875
02:34:58,560 --> 02:35:02,360
And like the theme, because the song that played is just one, that's the first level

2876
02:35:02,360 --> 02:35:03,360
theme.

2877
02:35:03,360 --> 02:35:06,920
So the, the actual theme song is its own thing too.

2878
02:35:06,920 --> 02:35:12,080
And then the second level theme, I haven't actually, um, put in a level yet.

2879
02:35:12,080 --> 02:35:15,640
I'm thinking like a snow level, but, uh, it's all good.

2880
02:35:15,640 --> 02:35:16,640
All of it.

2881
02:35:16,640 --> 02:35:17,640
Frozen shit.

2882
02:35:17,640 --> 02:35:18,640
Brown snow.

2883
02:35:18,640 --> 02:35:19,640
It's just going to be slippery.

2884
02:35:19,640 --> 02:35:24,960
Um, so all of it is going to be just, it's such a good soundtrack.

2885
02:35:24,960 --> 02:35:28,560
I'm excited.

2886
02:35:28,560 --> 02:35:29,920
Kudos to both of you.

2887
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:34,720
I'm, you know, obviously I'm going to buy anything YYR makes because he's, he doesn't

2888
02:35:34,720 --> 02:35:39,180
charge enough for it and they're always, you know, so, so good, but just knowing that now

2889
02:35:39,180 --> 02:35:42,460
you've like evolved it, I think is a good word for it.

2890
02:35:42,460 --> 02:35:44,940
I don't want to, I don't want to say elevated.

2891
02:35:44,940 --> 02:35:49,700
I would say like evolved, I think is a good word and like made it like a very, you took

2892
02:35:49,700 --> 02:35:51,460
a very dark soccer idea.

2893
02:35:51,460 --> 02:35:58,100
You took a YYR execution and then you somehow made these a Loki thing is with, with professional

2894
02:35:58,100 --> 02:36:00,900
help where you needed it, like with the music and things like that.

2895
02:36:00,900 --> 02:36:03,620
And maybe areas that weren't your comfort zone.

2896
02:36:03,620 --> 02:36:07,660
I tried, I've learned enough of, I learned enough of Famitrack because that's the thing

2897
02:36:07,660 --> 02:36:08,780
about Nest Maker too.

2898
02:36:08,780 --> 02:36:14,740
Like Nest Maker has its quirks cause it uses this a library called like GG sound or something

2899
02:36:14,740 --> 02:36:15,740
like that.

2900
02:36:15,740 --> 02:36:19,140
And it has, it's very quirky on how it works with audio.

2901
02:36:19,140 --> 02:36:25,300
So I had to fix a lot of things in like so it was, that was a complicated process just

2902
02:36:25,300 --> 02:36:29,980
to get the music in there and trying to cram it within the ROM size because those songs

2903
02:36:29,980 --> 02:36:33,980
are very complicated and they take up a lot of space.

2904
02:36:33,980 --> 02:36:36,420
So I was like, I need more music other than these three songs.

2905
02:36:36,420 --> 02:36:43,300
I was like, okay, I got to cram like a song in there and it was tricky, but I did manage

2906
02:36:43,300 --> 02:36:46,980
to get one more song in there and that's about all I can fit without bank switching.

2907
02:36:46,980 --> 02:36:50,500
And I don't really know how to do that very well.

2908
02:36:50,500 --> 02:36:51,500
All right.

2909
02:36:51,500 --> 02:36:55,620
Well, to be continued, this is just the beginning of the saga, I'm sure that's been ongoing

2910
02:36:55,620 --> 02:36:56,620
on the show.

2911
02:36:56,620 --> 02:36:59,980
And that's why I'm spending so much time on it because you know, this has been a product

2912
02:36:59,980 --> 02:37:01,580
you've been talking about for a long time.

2913
02:37:01,580 --> 02:37:07,420
And I, I just, again, it's the, the answer was so obvious and right in front of our face,

2914
02:37:07,420 --> 02:37:13,260
but I just, ah, the Loki's got the Loki hat came up with some crazy idea and you did.

2915
02:37:13,260 --> 02:37:16,700
And it's, it's, yeah, it's great.

2916
02:37:16,700 --> 02:37:17,700
Love seeing it.

2917
02:37:17,700 --> 02:37:18,700
So excited to play it.

2918
02:37:18,700 --> 02:37:21,700
So excited to become the world record speed runner.

2919
02:37:21,700 --> 02:37:22,700
In the game.

2920
02:37:22,700 --> 02:37:28,220
Here's, I'll finish it off with the last bit and I don't know if you noticed, but because

2921
02:37:28,220 --> 02:37:33,860
your character is pooping a lot, I don't know if you noticed, but the character, when he

2922
02:37:33,860 --> 02:37:40,520
runs up on the screen, you'll notice that there is a hole cut out of the backside where

2923
02:37:40,520 --> 02:37:41,780
it would be coming out.

2924
02:37:41,780 --> 02:37:45,900
Cause obviously obviously you can't go through your clothes.

2925
02:37:45,900 --> 02:37:53,380
So it's the fine details like that.

2926
02:37:53,380 --> 02:37:54,640
We know what he's doing.

2927
02:37:54,640 --> 02:37:57,520
He's accidentally.

2928
02:37:57,520 --> 02:38:03,320
So I just next on your next rewatch of the trailer, be sure to look for that.

2929
02:38:03,320 --> 02:38:04,320
Hold on.

2930
02:38:04,320 --> 02:38:05,320
I'm sorry.

2931
02:38:05,320 --> 02:38:09,320
If it goes till 10 o'clock tonight, I'm not apologizing because we're going to get these

2932
02:38:09,320 --> 02:38:10,320
answers.

2933
02:38:10,320 --> 02:38:14,960
You're fucking crazy as far as when it's hitting the road.

2934
02:38:14,960 --> 02:38:15,960
I'm sorry.

2935
02:38:15,960 --> 02:38:16,960
I'm sorry.

2936
02:38:16,960 --> 02:38:34,160
Just on the back.

2937
02:38:34,160 --> 02:38:36,640
He's either ready for a hot date or a lot of poop.

2938
02:38:36,640 --> 02:38:38,640
I can't stop crying.

2939
02:38:38,640 --> 02:38:39,640
Okay.

2940
02:38:39,640 --> 02:38:42,640
All right.

2941
02:38:42,640 --> 02:38:43,640
Let's try to get over there.

2942
02:38:43,640 --> 02:38:45,560
We're going to rapid fire the rest of the show here and try to get through.

2943
02:38:45,560 --> 02:38:46,560
Oh my God.

2944
02:38:47,160 --> 02:38:48,160
Another big thing we got to talk about.

2945
02:38:48,160 --> 02:38:49,160
Oh my God.

2946
02:38:49,160 --> 02:38:50,160
We got to.

2947
02:38:50,160 --> 02:38:51,160
Okay.

2948
02:38:51,160 --> 02:38:52,160
Let's get to it.

2949
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:53,160
Rapid fire news.

2950
02:38:53,160 --> 02:38:54,160
Low key.

2951
02:38:54,160 --> 02:38:55,160
Mario Kart's getting it.

2952
02:38:55,160 --> 02:38:56,160
Arcade's getting a mode with infinite shells.

2953
02:38:56,160 --> 02:38:57,560
That's kind of crazy.

2954
02:38:57,560 --> 02:39:00,640
So that's going to be something that they're going to be patching into Mario Kart arcade

2955
02:39:00,640 --> 02:39:04,580
grand Prix DX this week coming December 10th.

2956
02:39:04,580 --> 02:39:10,360
So if you can find someplace that's not under quarantine, you can go check it out.

2957
02:39:10,360 --> 02:39:14,380
And then also it looks like the doom guy is going to be coming to fall guys soon.

2958
02:39:14,380 --> 02:39:16,480
So that's pretty cool.

2959
02:39:16,480 --> 02:39:19,280
I'm guessing part of the next season.

2960
02:39:19,280 --> 02:39:20,280
All right.

2961
02:39:20,280 --> 02:39:21,280
Also coming up.

2962
02:39:21,280 --> 02:39:23,900
Pax is planning the events for next year.

2963
02:39:23,900 --> 02:39:27,720
And I know that might seem a little bold when we're still in a pandemic, but with the vaccine

2964
02:39:27,720 --> 02:39:31,420
on the way, there are folks that are really hoping we might be able to get back to some

2965
02:39:31,420 --> 02:39:35,500
of that convention spirit who knows next summer, at least that's what they've announced for

2966
02:39:35,500 --> 02:39:37,060
the next Pax East.

2967
02:39:37,060 --> 02:39:41,060
This is notable because Pax East is normally around like the March, April timeframe.

2968
02:39:41,060 --> 02:39:42,620
I think one year it was in February.

2969
02:39:42,620 --> 02:39:43,620
I'm sorry, guys.

2970
02:39:43,860 --> 02:39:47,820
I haven't been to Pax East in a few years, so I forget the exact days and timeframe,

2971
02:39:47,820 --> 02:39:48,820
but it is interesting.

2972
02:39:48,820 --> 02:39:52,220
They are bumping it back to June so they can hopefully actually have it.

2973
02:39:52,220 --> 02:39:53,300
I think there's a lot of hope.

2974
02:39:53,300 --> 02:39:56,860
And you know, when you listen to some things in the government, there's the when I'm talking

2975
02:39:56,860 --> 02:40:03,260
like Dr. Fauci and you know, those folks that care about COVID actually say that we could

2976
02:40:03,260 --> 02:40:05,260
see a sense of normalcy by May or June.

2977
02:40:05,260 --> 02:40:06,580
I hope we are.

2978
02:40:06,580 --> 02:40:07,580
That is very true.

2979
02:40:07,580 --> 02:40:11,640
And we can have a Pax East June 3rd through 6th in Boston, but they are going out of their

2980
02:40:11,680 --> 02:40:16,160
way to say, if it's not safe, we're not doing it.

2981
02:40:16,160 --> 02:40:17,160
We're only going to do it.

2982
02:40:17,160 --> 02:40:19,760
But they want to kind of let people clear their calendars for that.

2983
02:40:19,760 --> 02:40:21,520
So that's pretty cool.

2984
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:27,000
September 3rd through the 6th in Seattle, although obviously us here at VOG Network,

2985
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,120
we tend to go to Dragon Con instead.

2986
02:40:29,120 --> 02:40:32,840
But if you are in the Seattle area, hey, cool, you can go to that.

2987
02:40:32,840 --> 02:40:37,160
And then Pax Unplugged will be back in Philadelphia in December.

2988
02:40:37,160 --> 02:40:41,540
They will not be having a Pax South in 2021.

2989
02:40:41,540 --> 02:40:45,100
This is just because they had to move the other things around.

2990
02:40:45,100 --> 02:40:47,420
They're looking to bring that back in 2022.

2991
02:40:47,420 --> 02:40:49,100
So you know, fingers and toes crossed.

2992
02:40:49,100 --> 02:40:57,640
I'm trying not to get too hopeful, but hey, if Dr. Fauci and the other doctors of the

2993
02:40:57,640 --> 02:41:01,100
world out there say, take the vaccine, you know what I'm going to do, I'm going to take

2994
02:41:01,100 --> 02:41:02,100
the vaccine.

2995
02:41:02,100 --> 02:41:07,240
So let's hope it helps.

2996
02:41:07,240 --> 02:41:10,320
Other things to look forward to, WATAM.

2997
02:41:10,320 --> 02:41:12,720
This is the game from the Katamari Damacy creator.

2998
02:41:12,720 --> 02:41:16,480
It was an Epic exclusive when it originally came out on PC.

2999
02:41:16,480 --> 02:41:22,720
But now Keita Takahashi's game WATAM will now be out on Steam as of December 18th.

3000
02:41:22,720 --> 02:41:28,560
And that's about a year after it originally debuted on the Epic Game Store.

3001
02:41:28,560 --> 02:41:31,000
So I don't know if Dark Soccer, you ever got a chance to play that game.

3002
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:32,000
I never did.

3003
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:33,720
I somehow always missed it.

3004
02:41:33,720 --> 02:41:37,620
But I'll be checking that out probably when it makes its way to Steam, since I'm going

3005
02:41:37,620 --> 02:41:40,500
to be using Steam to play all these new games that were announced tonight.

3006
02:41:40,500 --> 02:41:41,500
That's for sure.

3007
02:41:41,500 --> 02:41:44,860
Dark Soccer, what do you have for Rapid Fire News?

3008
02:41:44,860 --> 02:41:52,020
I, King of Fighters 15 had a trailer drop with Shunai being the main character coming

3009
02:41:52,020 --> 02:41:53,020
through.

3010
02:41:53,020 --> 02:42:00,040
We should be seeing the release coming out on January 7th, 2021.

3011
02:42:00,040 --> 02:42:01,500
So cool.

3012
02:42:01,500 --> 02:42:08,660
And other news, um, uh, Sega, um, it will actually, it looks like this might have our,

3013
02:42:08,660 --> 02:42:14,620
you know, it's still running through from the second until the eighth is, uh, uh, there

3014
02:42:14,620 --> 02:42:19,580
is a Sega and stand up to cancer or teaming up for live streams to raise awareness and

3015
02:42:19,580 --> 02:42:21,620
fund for cancer research.

3016
02:42:21,620 --> 02:42:28,300
So, um, we, on the seventh is the next big one where, uh, Sega Europe is playing Total

3017
02:42:28,300 --> 02:42:31,020
War Warhammer 2, Alien Isolation and Sonic Mania.

3018
02:42:31,020 --> 02:42:38,700
Um, and on the eighth, uh, Relic Entertainment will be looking at, uh, some of their games.

3019
02:42:38,700 --> 02:42:41,940
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

3020
02:42:41,940 --> 02:42:44,540
I'm, I'm thinking it might finally be slowing down this week.

3021
02:42:44,540 --> 02:42:45,540
No.

3022
02:42:45,540 --> 02:42:46,540
No.

3023
02:42:46,540 --> 02:42:47,540
Oh my God.

3024
02:42:47,540 --> 02:42:48,540
All right.

3025
02:42:48,540 --> 02:42:49,540
Let's get through them.

3026
02:42:49,540 --> 02:42:53,980
No, this, this week we've got a drawn to life, uh, two realms that's coming out on PC, Nintendo

02:43:46,980 --> 02:43:47,980
All right.

3037
02:43:47,980 --> 02:43:50,620
Heading over to Japan, checking out some of the releases there.

3038
02:43:50,620 --> 02:43:56,420
Uh, we have on the Nintendo switch, a doc upon up, a Mugen, no roulette in a regular

We also have Puyo Puyo Tetris two getting its release, although they do say this is

3041
02:44:01,440 --> 02:44:04,580
an English version, but that is being released in Japan this week.

3042
02:44:04,580 --> 02:44:09,300

02:44:15,620 --> 02:44:17,180
If we have anything there.

3046
02:44:17,180 --> 02:44:18,300
I don't think we do this.

3047
02:44:18,300 --> 02:44:22,180
Oh, Puyo Puyo Tetris two is also out this week on the PlayStation five and that is the

soul release this week on PS five quickly checking the PlayStation four.

3049
02:44:27,700 --> 02:44:30,780
I doubt we're going to see things that are very different.

3050
02:44:30,780 --> 02:44:36,160
Um, I do see that cyberpunk 2077 does get a Japanese release as well, so that must be

3051
02:44:36,160 --> 02:44:37,380
a worldwide thing.

3052
02:44:37,380 --> 02:44:42,700

02:45:44,180 --> 02:45:50,060
We have arc survival evolved, um, and that is it through the next week.

3068
02:45:50,060 --> 02:45:51,060
All right.

3069
02:45:51,060 --> 02:45:54,140
We're going to do some more stories for you guys, but as I mentioned, since we're running

3070
02:45:54,140 --> 02:45:58,460
a little long, because I was not able to plan appropriately because the secret was withheld

3071
02:45:58,460 --> 02:46:00,060
from me for a very long time.

3072
02:46:00,060 --> 02:46:02,140
Uh, Oh, I see what you did there.

3073
02:46:02,140 --> 02:46:07,100
Loki, you switched your footage out because of what pod culture said in chat, huh?

3074
02:46:07,100 --> 02:46:10,540
So now he's got a footage of the new game running behind him there.

3075
02:46:10,540 --> 02:46:11,540
Very cute touch.

3076
02:46:11,540 --> 02:46:12,540
All right.

3077
02:46:12,540 --> 02:46:14,020
So we're going to do some, uh, quick news stories here.

3078
02:46:14,020 --> 02:46:16,220
We're just going to kind of run through these rapid fire styles.

3079
02:46:16,220 --> 02:46:19,900
Cause I definitely want to get to the mailbag because, uh, we have, uh, something really

3080
02:46:19,900 --> 02:46:20,900
cool in there too.

3081
02:46:20,900 --> 02:46:24,540
We got to get to, so, uh, uh, Loki, why don't you start us off?

3082
02:46:24,540 --> 02:46:28,620
Uh, so this was the end of season four, uh, Fortnite.

3083
02:46:28,620 --> 02:46:35,260
So it ended with a fight against Galactus and a lot of Marvel tie-in stuff and copyright

3084
02:46:35,260 --> 02:46:36,260
music.

3085
02:46:36,260 --> 02:46:38,540
Uh, it was pretty cool looking.

3086
02:46:38,540 --> 02:46:47,180
So after all that, of course, um, you know, the map changed and brought back now, uh,

3087
02:46:47,180 --> 02:46:48,180
lots of new stuff.

3088
02:46:48,180 --> 02:46:54,300
So they have season five, which is zero point, and they've got lots of different crossovers

3089
02:46:54,300 --> 02:46:56,900
going on, including the Mandalorian.

3090
02:46:56,900 --> 02:47:04,100
Um, they also added a brand new, uh, season pass type thing that you can subscribe to

3091
02:47:04,100 --> 02:47:05,340
as well.

3092
02:47:05,340 --> 02:47:07,900
Um, lots of stuff.

3093
02:47:07,940 --> 02:47:12,780
So, um, yeah, I dunno, it was pretty interesting.

3094
02:47:12,780 --> 02:47:17,500
And then, um, apparently there is also going to be some more crossovers with different

3095
02:47:17,500 --> 02:47:19,460
characters from a console.

3096
02:47:19,460 --> 02:47:25,460
So the first, of course being announced was, uh, Kratos is going to be in Fortnite as well

3097
02:47:25,460 --> 02:47:30,500
on, uh, the, I'm assuming the PlayStation four version, but maybe the skins can be on

3098
02:47:30,500 --> 02:47:36,500
all platforms, um, lots of tie-ins they've got lots of crossovers.

3099
02:47:36,500 --> 02:47:39,460
That's one thing that's really been a thing in a Fortnite.

3100
02:47:39,460 --> 02:47:42,180
So Fortnite is such a part of pop culture now.

3101
02:47:42,180 --> 02:47:43,180
Yeah.

3102
02:47:43,180 --> 02:47:46,940
So I'm curious to see what else is going to be coming soon, but, uh, the thought is that

3103
02:47:46,940 --> 02:47:53,020
there's going to be more, um, uh, crossovers, including possibly master chief.

3104
02:47:53,020 --> 02:47:54,980
So we'll have to see.

3105
02:47:54,980 --> 02:47:55,980
Interesting.

3106
02:47:55,980 --> 02:47:56,980
All right.

3107
02:47:56,980 --> 02:48:01,340
Well, um, if you are somebody who plays and streams on Twitch, like I'm sure many of you

3108
02:48:01,340 --> 02:48:05,300
are getting ready to stream Loki's game on Twitch, whenever it does release next year,

3109
02:48:05,300 --> 02:48:10,500
uh, will, uh, you might sometimes tag your streams with different categories.

3110
02:48:10,500 --> 02:48:15,380
Um, and the very first time you stream something, sometimes the community has referred to that

3111
02:48:15,380 --> 02:48:20,500
historically as a blind playthrough, but it was pointed out by, um, you know, folks in

3112
02:48:20,500 --> 02:48:25,980
the community who happen to be blind and other folks with disabilities, uh, that maybe blind

3113
02:48:25,980 --> 02:48:33,140
playthrough is not exactly, um, it's not the best language, you know, it's, it's, uh, and

3114
02:48:33,140 --> 02:48:38,580
they actually say here, uh, in a comment, yeah, it's ableist, an able game, the able

3115
02:48:38,580 --> 02:48:43,980
gamer COO, um, explains just as we used to say gay, when something was bad, using disability

3116
02:48:43,980 --> 02:48:48,340
terms as an alternate word for a negative situation or feeling is common in today's

3117
02:48:48,340 --> 02:48:49,340
language.

3118
02:48:49,340 --> 02:48:53,000
But just as we stopped saying gay to mean bad, we can stop saying these words to think

3119
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,180
about the words that you choose.

3120
02:48:55,180 --> 02:49:00,260
And they, so this applies to the blind play through tag former, um, on Twitch, they have

3121
02:49:00,260 --> 02:49:04,340
changed it to a more appropriate name, which would be first play through.

3122
02:49:04,340 --> 02:49:06,620
And I think that's, I mean, that's what it is anyway.

3123
02:49:06,620 --> 02:49:09,660
And I think there's probably, you know, there's probably a lot of people that were kind of

3124
02:49:09,660 --> 02:49:12,020
wondering like, what does that mean anyway?

3125
02:49:12,020 --> 02:49:16,860
So I honestly, I think from all angles, you know, just the fact that it's, it's a little

3126
02:49:16,860 --> 02:49:21,740
more sensitive to, um, the disabled community who, who likes to stream games on Twitch and

3127
02:49:21,740 --> 02:49:22,740
plenty of them.

3128
02:49:22,740 --> 02:49:29,640
I think it's, I think it's great that we have a better term that just tells what it is.

3129
02:49:29,640 --> 02:49:36,640
So if you want to stream your first play through of Pixel Poops 64 or Pixel Poops 2 or whatever

3130
02:49:36,640 --> 02:49:41,480
it is, uh, you can use first play through would be the right, uh, uh, words to use that.

3131
02:49:41,480 --> 02:49:44,560
So pretty cool, uh, dark soccer.

3132
02:49:44,560 --> 02:49:51,200
We have, um, I'm not going to go into a lot of detail on this one, but it's talking about

3133
02:49:51,200 --> 02:49:59,240
how fashion and video games are really starting to discover a sort of a marriage, um, uh,

3134
02:49:59,240 --> 02:50:05,280
Video games are basically becoming a, a, a virtual runway for different fashion designers.

3135
02:50:05,280 --> 02:50:10,840
Like, um, and I'll even go back, like back in the day, I used to, um, download like designer

3136
02:50:10,840 --> 02:50:18,200
clothes for my Sims where the people had put all this effort into, into making, um, and

3137
02:50:18,200 --> 02:50:23,960
even their own fashion, even actual fashion designers are using games like the Sims or

3138
02:50:23,960 --> 02:50:30,320
Second Life or anything else to, you know, to, uh, to kind of dress up in their own little

3139
02:50:30,320 --> 02:50:31,320
fantasy world.

3140
02:50:31,320 --> 02:50:37,360
And, uh, right now I think that the Sims 4 has a deal going on with Gucci for like legit

3141
02:50:37,360 --> 02:50:39,360
Gucci items in the game.

3142
02:50:39,360 --> 02:50:43,080
Um, and you know, and I like it was going back for a previous story where he talked

3143
02:50:43,080 --> 02:50:49,080
about how video games, uh, are leading one of the biggest leading industries in the U.S.

3144
02:50:49,080 --> 02:50:55,040
Um, and in fact, in the first nine months of 2020, uh, sales of hardware content accessories

3145
02:50:55,040 --> 02:51:01,520
grew by 21% to 33.7 billion, um, over the same period of the previous year.

3146
02:51:01,520 --> 02:51:10,120
Um, so we're getting now, uh, people in Animal Crossing, for example, um, recreating certain,

3147
02:51:10,120 --> 02:51:16,100
uh, you know, uh, fashion items, um, you know, for the, the Able Sisters store, um, we've

3148
02:51:16,100 --> 02:51:23,060
had, uh, a Bathing Ape, um, have content out, uh, for, uh, hold on, let me get the game

3149
02:51:23,060 --> 02:51:26,500
it was in, for, uh, League of Legends for the character Yasuo.

3150
02:51:26,500 --> 02:51:34,360
Um, in, uh, sorry, in, uh, in League of Legends as well, there's been, uh, a Louis Vuitton

3151
02:51:34,360 --> 02:51:42,920
designer, uh, doing, uh, uh, skins for Senna, um, so it's actually just really interesting

3152
02:51:42,920 --> 02:51:49,800
that because, you know, having an actual fashion show or having, uh, these in-person

3153
02:51:49,800 --> 02:51:55,800
events are becoming harder and harder to do, um, that they are really looking to video

3154
02:51:55,800 --> 02:51:56,800
games.

3155
02:51:56,800 --> 02:52:03,200
Like there's, uh, another, uh, uh, a game called Goodbye Volcano High, uh, it's done,

3156
02:52:03,200 --> 02:52:11,080
uh, by, uh, actually their design team is, uh, predominantly, uh, LGBTQ+, um, and talks

3157
02:52:11,080 --> 02:52:19,060
about, uh, you know, fashion in this sort of alternate dinosaur populated world, um,

3158
02:52:19,060 --> 02:52:23,560
you know, of course, again, there's the Animal Crossing ones where people are, are recreating

3159
02:52:23,560 --> 02:52:24,560
these outfits.

3160
02:52:24,560 --> 02:52:31,000
Um, and, you know, I think it's actually pretty neat, you know, that they're doing this as

3161
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:38,640
a way to, um, to drive that interest and to give back to the market and encouraging, uh,

3162
02:52:39,360 --> 02:52:44,040
just people, fans of the series, um, of their clothes to get out and do their own designs

3163
02:52:44,040 --> 02:52:45,040
as well.

3164
02:52:45,040 --> 02:52:50,000
Um, so yeah, uh, that Gucci pack, by the way, is called Gucci Off the Grid, uh, across

3165
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:54,060
the Sims 4, it's a $40, uh, pack.

3166
02:52:54,060 --> 02:52:58,900
There's the various League of Legends ones, there's Love Nikki Dress Up Queen, uh, came

3167
02:52:58,900 --> 02:53:05,880
back in 2015, but there's apparently been, uh, like more content put out for it in the

3168
02:53:05,880 --> 02:53:06,880
fashion industry.

3169
02:53:06,880 --> 02:53:12,160
Cyberpunk 2077 is even talking about it, uh, with some of the, the character designs and

3170
02:53:12,160 --> 02:53:13,160
clothing put in it.

3171
02:53:13,160 --> 02:53:17,920
So I think we're actually starting to see actually not even just the fashion influencing

3172
02:53:17,920 --> 02:53:20,920
the games, but the games influencing the fashion as well.

3173
02:53:20,920 --> 02:53:21,920
Hmm.

3174
02:53:21,920 --> 02:53:25,280
I like that, how video games can influence fashion.

3175
02:53:25,280 --> 02:53:29,880
And you know, um, I think, uh, a game that, you know, we know is coming out very soon,

3176
02:53:29,880 --> 02:53:34,120
you know, Cyberpunk is kind of looking, I think fashion is gonna play kind of a role

3177
02:53:34,120 --> 02:53:38,200
in that as well, especially with all of the character customization options that are in

3178
02:53:38,200 --> 02:53:39,200
that.

3179
02:53:39,200 --> 02:53:41,480
And I think we've seen some of the crazy screenshots this week about that game.

3180
02:53:41,480 --> 02:53:45,440
Uh, I think there's going to be, I think that game is going to get used as an outlet a lot

3181
02:53:45,440 --> 02:53:50,360
for, um, fashion and what people want to represent themselves in a virtual setting.

3182
02:53:50,360 --> 02:53:51,880
So it'd be very interesting for sure.

3183
02:53:51,880 --> 02:53:52,880
For sure.

3184
02:53:52,880 --> 02:53:53,880
Yeah.

3185
02:53:53,880 --> 02:53:54,880
All right.

3186
02:53:54,880 --> 02:53:55,880
Uh, Loki.

3187
02:53:55,880 --> 02:53:56,880
All right.

3188
02:53:56,880 --> 02:54:03,400
So Microsoft has purchased the online tournament platform, smash.gg, uh, they made the announcement

3189
02:54:03,400 --> 02:54:05,360
via Twitter.

3190
02:54:05,360 --> 02:54:10,680
And basically what's supposed to happen now is that it's just going to be running, uh,

3191
02:54:10,680 --> 02:54:12,600
kind of as business as usual.

3192
02:54:12,600 --> 02:54:18,280
They're saying they're going to be, uh, utilizing the additional resources from Microsoft to

3193
02:54:18,280 --> 02:54:25,240
strengthen the platform and make kind of the destination site for, uh, e-sports, uh, tournaments.

3194
02:54:25,240 --> 02:54:29,440
But I'm curious to see what additional things they're going to do with this site.

3195
02:54:29,440 --> 02:54:35,400
Um, so kind of early, they didn't save for the, it looks like it's going to, it was purchased

3196
02:54:35,400 --> 02:54:36,880
for an undisclosed amount.

3197
02:54:36,880 --> 02:54:41,760
So they don't know how much the site was purchased for, but I'm kind of curious to see what their

3198
02:54:41,760 --> 02:54:47,360
strategy is behind this with, um, you know, this acquisition they've been doing a lot

3199
02:54:47,360 --> 02:54:49,960
of acquisitions.

3200
02:54:49,960 --> 02:54:53,800
I w I wanted to use the story as a segue and I'm not going to have enough time to get into

3201
02:54:53,800 --> 02:54:56,480
it, but I wanted to talk about, um, some of the things that are going on with the Nintendo

3202
02:54:56,520 --> 02:54:57,520
tournament side of things.

3203
02:54:57,520 --> 02:55:01,520
And I kind of made a tongue in cheek reference at the beginning of the show about how, um, you

3204
02:55:01,520 --> 02:55:05,240
know, Nintendo ended up canceling that Splatoon tournament because everybody was using the tags

3205
02:55:05,240 --> 02:55:06,720
with free melee and stuff.

3206
02:55:06,720 --> 02:55:08,480
Uh, if I understand correctly, they did that.

3207
02:55:08,480 --> 02:55:10,400
They ended up doing the tournament on their own.

3208
02:55:10,400 --> 02:55:13,160
The organizers just did it without Nintendo support.

3209
02:55:13,160 --> 02:55:16,920
Uh, and it probably ended up having more viewers as a result of all the free publicity of Nintendo

3210
02:55:16,920 --> 02:55:17,880
pulling out.

3211
02:55:17,880 --> 02:55:21,400
So, um, that, that at least that's how I interpreted it.

3212
02:55:21,400 --> 02:55:22,360
That's for sure.

3213
02:55:22,360 --> 02:55:26,520
So, uh, SSJ 100, Matt says there's some breaking news with Nintendo going on right now.

3214
02:55:26,520 --> 02:55:27,720
Oh, oh fuck.

3215
02:55:27,720 --> 02:55:32,280
Now what it's another day in 2020.

3216
02:55:32,280 --> 02:55:39,080
Well, it was someone was, they were selling, um, joy cons that were customized with etiquette

3217
02:55:39,080 --> 02:55:41,880
stuff on it and they put a stop to it.

3218
02:55:41,880 --> 02:55:45,880
Nintendo told them to see selling and not too surprised about that.

3219
02:55:45,880 --> 02:55:48,280
I mean, that's, they're protecting their IP.

3220
02:55:48,280 --> 02:55:52,280
I would say they have a right to do that stuff, but the tournament scene really, I

3221
02:55:52,280 --> 02:55:55,320
think, and what's interesting with Microsoft getting involved with this because the tournament

3222
02:55:55,320 --> 02:56:01,480
scene starting to revolt basically against Nintendo is very fascinating to me.

3223
02:56:01,480 --> 02:56:05,080
Um, and I'm really curious to see where this ends up considering that they wanted to be

3224
02:56:05,080 --> 02:56:09,240
e-sports with all the like, um, platoon two and stuff.

3225
02:56:09,240 --> 02:56:10,760
That's how they kind of positioned that.

3226
02:56:10,760 --> 02:56:13,800
And now they're kind, I don't know.

3227
02:56:13,800 --> 02:56:14,600
It's just so bad.

3228
02:56:14,600 --> 02:56:17,720
It's complicated because again, like, and I talked about this on the show where we talked

3229
02:56:17,720 --> 02:56:21,000
about the tournament, you know, getting canceled about the melee, you know, kind of having

3230
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:21,800
to use an emulator to play.

3231
02:56:21,880 --> 02:56:26,120
It's like, I kind of get why Nintendo had to do it, but, um, I don't know.

3232
02:56:26,120 --> 02:56:30,120
Sometimes it's in the way you, you deliver the message and maybe using the lawyers and

3233
02:56:30,120 --> 02:56:31,880
cease and desist wasn't the best thing.

3234
02:56:31,880 --> 02:56:32,840
Who knew?

3235
02:56:32,840 --> 02:56:37,400
Um, Bobby Blackwolf pointing out, it's that term joy con that's an issue.

3236
02:56:37,400 --> 02:56:41,080
Uh, if they hadn't called them joy cons, they probably wouldn't have gotten cease and desisted

3237
02:56:41,080 --> 02:56:47,640
because they have just said, Hey, you know, this is a, you know, a protected term, you

3238
02:56:47,640 --> 02:56:50,200
know, please remove that from your description.

3239
02:56:50,200 --> 02:56:53,720
And then we're, we're cool instead of like, take it down.

3240
02:56:53,720 --> 02:56:55,000
I mean, like, I don't know.

3241
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:56,280
It just seems ridiculous.

3242
02:56:56,280 --> 02:57:00,040
Speaking of Nintendo, Bobby wanted me to bring up, um, even though he brought it up on his

3243
02:57:00,040 --> 02:57:03,960
show and you guys should be listening to both, but Bobby did bring up the whole, uh, that

3244
02:57:03,960 --> 02:57:06,120
thing in the Nintendo firmware that's hidden.

3245
02:57:06,120 --> 02:57:10,920
There's some Google analytics tracking data that is turned on by default.

3246
02:57:10,920 --> 02:57:14,840
And I don't think any of us like these opt in by default sorts of things.

3247
02:57:14,840 --> 02:57:18,680
So if you aren't already aware, you may want to go into your Nintendo system, into the

3248
02:57:18,680 --> 02:57:19,080
firmware.

3249
02:57:19,080 --> 02:57:20,200
It's kind of buried in there.

3250
02:57:20,200 --> 02:57:23,320
Bobby just put a link in chat, but if you want more information, it's on a lot of the

3251
02:57:23,320 --> 02:57:24,360
Nintendo blogs.

3252
02:57:24,360 --> 02:57:28,840
For example, Nintendo life wrote an article about it a couple of days ago, uh, that the

3253
02:57:28,840 --> 02:57:33,640
Google analytics data collecting is on on the switch firmware in by default, you can

3254
02:57:33,640 --> 02:57:34,840
go in there and turn it off.

3255
02:57:34,840 --> 02:57:39,160
If you don't want Google tracking that kind of data, uh, probably if you play a lot of

3256
02:57:39,160 --> 02:57:43,080
legend of Zelda, then Google's going to know to start selling you, uh, or to start showing

3257
02:57:43,080 --> 02:57:45,320
you like Zelda shirts and things of that nature.

3258
02:57:45,320 --> 02:57:46,920
That's probably what they're doing with it.

3259
02:57:46,920 --> 02:57:49,160
So, um, something to keep in mind.

3260
02:57:50,360 --> 02:57:56,200
Yeah, but I mean, yeah, I guess, I don't know it being that your Google account's not

3261
02:57:56,200 --> 02:57:58,280
necessarily tied to that console.

3262
02:57:58,280 --> 02:57:58,760
I get it.

3263
02:57:58,760 --> 02:58:04,440
They could probably look at your wifi or something like that, but yeah, it's not really tied

3264
02:58:04,440 --> 02:58:05,480
to your Google account.

3265
02:58:05,480 --> 02:58:07,640
So like I would think maybe they're just collecting.

3266
02:58:07,640 --> 02:58:11,800
Yeah, but if you've ever logged into the website, it might be able to drive that, get that

3267
02:58:11,800 --> 02:58:12,440
bridge together.

3268
02:58:12,440 --> 02:58:12,920
Yeah.

3269
02:58:13,160 --> 02:58:16,760
And a lot of people connect through Facebook and Twitter to get friend requests.

3270
02:58:17,400 --> 02:58:19,160
So that is built in there.

3271
02:58:19,160 --> 02:58:19,480
Yeah.

3272
02:58:19,480 --> 02:58:20,920
So there's ways.

3273
02:58:20,920 --> 02:58:21,320
All right.

3274
02:58:22,040 --> 02:58:25,560
Anyway, one more story here, and I may mispronounce the name of this place.

3275
02:58:25,560 --> 02:58:30,120
So Jamie, you may have to, uh, throw me a life vest here, but, um, this is a sad story

3276
02:58:30,120 --> 02:58:34,120
about an arcade in Tokyo that is closing pretty much permanently.

3277
02:58:34,120 --> 02:58:39,000
And it's, uh, because of the pandemic, um, Ikebukuro, I think is the name of it.

3278
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:40,360
I say that right?

3279
02:58:40,360 --> 02:58:40,860
Yes.

3280
02:58:41,480 --> 02:58:42,040
Okay.

3281
02:58:42,040 --> 02:58:48,360
They're closing, uh, permanently and, uh, you know, sad, but, um, it's, uh, yeah.

3282
02:58:48,360 --> 02:58:49,080
So I'm sorry.

3283
02:58:49,720 --> 02:58:50,280
Hello.

3284
02:58:50,280 --> 02:58:51,480
That is the district.

3285
02:58:53,080 --> 02:58:55,560
Yeah, I was like, I didn't think that was the name of.

3286
02:58:56,600 --> 02:58:57,960
The landmark there.

3287
02:58:57,960 --> 02:58:58,920
I misstated it.

3288
02:58:58,920 --> 02:58:59,480
Sorry guys.

3289
02:58:59,480 --> 02:59:04,360
The landmark silk hat is the arcade, uh, in that district.

3290
02:59:04,360 --> 02:59:05,720
And that is what is closing.

3291
02:59:05,720 --> 02:59:06,360
Sorry.

3292
02:59:06,360 --> 02:59:07,880
A faux pas on my part there.

3293
02:59:07,880 --> 02:59:09,480
Um, and so that is closing.

3294
02:59:09,560 --> 02:59:13,240
The reason why I want to bring this up, usually, you know, we've heard of a lot of things closing,

3295
02:59:13,240 --> 02:59:17,560
but what makes this relevant is that this was the arcade where dance dance revolution

3296
02:59:17,560 --> 02:59:19,160
was play tested many years ago.

3297
02:59:19,880 --> 02:59:23,560
So it's kind of sad to see that go away.

3298
02:59:23,560 --> 02:59:25,720
Um, but they are going to be closing their doors.

3299
02:59:25,720 --> 02:59:30,600
Uh, they are at the end of sunshine 60 Dori and, uh, going to be closing.

3300
02:59:30,600 --> 02:59:34,680
So that's silk hat again is the name of the arcade and it's been referenced in some, uh,

3301
02:59:34,680 --> 02:59:35,960
anime and things like that.

3302
02:59:35,960 --> 02:59:37,320
So, all right.

3303
02:59:38,520 --> 02:59:39,080
All right.

3304
02:59:39,080 --> 02:59:44,280
Um, let's get to the listener round table via our chat room and the mail bag.

3305
02:59:44,280 --> 02:59:47,240
And I know we have two emails at least to get through tonight.

3306
02:59:47,240 --> 02:59:47,960
Were you able to get those up?

3307
02:59:47,960 --> 02:59:49,000
Dark soccer or did you need my help?

3308
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:50,680
Yeah, I was, I was.

3309
02:59:50,680 --> 02:59:51,320
Let's get to it.

3310
02:59:52,440 --> 02:59:52,920
Okay.

3311
02:59:52,920 --> 02:59:57,240
So, um, first email is, uh, from Robert M.

3312
02:59:57,240 --> 02:59:59,240
I'm sure you've gotten this correction quite a bit, but yes.

3313
02:59:59,240 --> 03:00:03,080
Donkey Kong three is indeed part of the NES online collection.

3314
03:00:03,080 --> 03:00:07,560
Also, I don't know if everyone being, if it's everyone being home during the holidays or

3315
03:00:07,560 --> 03:00:11,960
if it's my internet connection, does anyone else had issues connecting to the switch e-shop

3316
03:00:11,960 --> 03:00:13,480
over the past few past few weeks?

3317
03:00:13,480 --> 03:00:14,920
That comes from Robert M.

3318
03:00:14,920 --> 03:00:16,600
And my answer to that is no.

3319
03:00:16,600 --> 03:00:20,200
Um, so you may have missed the dark soccer, but I did donkey Kong three as the classic

3320
03:00:20,200 --> 03:00:21,000
game last week.

3321
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:24,920
And, uh, I, I misspoke and I said, it's not on the NES collection.

3322
03:00:24,920 --> 03:00:26,760
Cause then to end it actually is.

3323
03:00:26,760 --> 03:00:30,440
So let's just point out all of Rob's fuck ups on the night.

3324
03:00:30,440 --> 03:00:32,680
He didn't contribute anything to the big reveal.

3325
03:00:35,160 --> 03:00:36,040
Okay.

3326
03:00:36,040 --> 03:00:38,040
Well, um, thank you for the correction.

3327
03:00:39,080 --> 03:00:42,520
The next one is actually a pretty, uh, a pretty big one.

3328
03:00:42,520 --> 03:00:45,720
Um, and it comes from, uh, uh, orange.

3329
03:00:45,720 --> 03:00:46,200
Right.

3330
03:00:46,200 --> 03:00:47,800
Um, says, hello, OLR.

3331
03:00:47,800 --> 03:00:48,120
Hello.

3332
03:00:48,120 --> 03:00:51,560
I don't really have a question, but I was bored and decided to make a remix of orange

3333
03:00:51,560 --> 03:00:53,160
Jones radio's intro song.

3334
03:00:53,160 --> 03:00:54,520
And I might as well share it with you.

3335
03:00:54,520 --> 03:00:58,440
My transcribing is probably not a hundred percent accurate and it was really good.

3336
03:00:59,160 --> 03:01:01,480
I'm going to be able to, I think I can play a clip.

3337
03:01:01,480 --> 03:01:03,080
I'm, I'm doing this live on air.

3338
03:01:03,080 --> 03:01:05,320
It might be really loud.

3339
03:01:05,320 --> 03:01:10,280
So please brace yourself because I don't see a volume slider on this, uh, thing.

3340
03:01:10,280 --> 03:01:11,560
So please brace yourself.

3341
03:01:11,560 --> 03:01:13,160
This may come through loud.

3342
03:01:13,160 --> 03:01:13,400
Okay.

3343
03:01:13,400 --> 03:01:14,440
But it's, it's awesome.

3344
03:01:14,440 --> 03:01:15,640
I'm going to play a little bit of it here.

3345
03:01:19,160 --> 03:01:20,760
I actually don't know if it's coming through at all.

3346
03:01:22,760 --> 03:01:23,560
I don't hear anything.

3347
03:01:23,560 --> 03:01:24,840
Not darn it.

3348
03:01:26,520 --> 03:01:27,080
Sorry guys.

3349
03:01:27,080 --> 03:01:27,800
I thought I had it.

3350
03:01:28,600 --> 03:01:32,680
Uh, let me try, um, some light.

3351
03:01:32,680 --> 03:01:38,200
I think I'm going to have to use this old snag here and this, oh, this looks terrible,

3352
03:01:38,200 --> 03:01:40,760
but let me see if, let me see if it fixes the audio side of things.

3353
03:01:45,960 --> 03:01:47,720
I actually don't know that.

3354
03:01:47,720 --> 03:01:48,220
No.

3355
03:01:49,880 --> 03:01:55,800
Well, unfortunately I'm not able to play it, uh, on the show right now.

3356
03:01:55,800 --> 03:01:57,240
Um, damn it.

3357
03:01:57,240 --> 03:02:00,840
I thought that would work cause I used to have stuff come through the web.

3358
03:02:00,840 --> 03:02:03,480
Let me try one other quick thing here.

3359
03:02:03,480 --> 03:02:03,720
Sorry.

3360
03:02:03,720 --> 03:02:04,920
I know that looks terrible.

3361
03:02:04,920 --> 03:02:11,640
The, uh, visual there, but I want to try doing to make sure it's coming through.

3362
03:02:13,720 --> 03:02:16,280
I'm just looking on my settings here to see.

3363
03:02:17,800 --> 03:02:21,400
Yeah, I thought I could get Safari to come through.

3364
03:02:21,400 --> 03:02:28,600
Maybe if I'm going to add it real quick as a source and see what I can do.

3365
03:02:28,600 --> 03:02:33,480
Um, yeah, yeah.

3366
03:02:33,480 --> 03:02:34,200
Live radio.

3367
03:02:35,160 --> 03:02:38,200
Um, I'm sorry.

3368
03:02:38,200 --> 03:02:38,520
Orange.

3369
03:02:38,520 --> 03:02:39,080
Right.

3370
03:02:39,080 --> 03:02:41,400
You deserve a better debut here.

3371
03:02:43,400 --> 03:02:44,360
Shucks.

3372
03:02:44,360 --> 03:02:48,520
Well, why don't we, can we at least post the link in our chat room and then we'll post

3373
03:02:48,520 --> 03:02:49,000
it.

3374
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:52,440
I'm going to post the link to the sound cloud on Twitter if orange right is okay with it,

3375
03:02:52,440 --> 03:02:55,240
but it is a sweet remix of the opening theme.

3376
03:02:55,800 --> 03:02:59,800
When I first heard it, I was like, OMG, this is, this is great.

3377
03:03:00,600 --> 03:03:05,000
And I sent it off to a dark Sakura and a Loki and, and, and.

3378
03:03:06,360 --> 03:03:06,920
Orange, right.

3379
03:03:06,920 --> 03:03:11,480
We may want to talk to you about actually using it somewhere on the show, um, on a regular

3380
03:03:11,480 --> 03:03:12,040
basis.

3381
03:03:12,040 --> 03:03:15,800
Um, obviously we're going to keep the intro that we have that dark soccer made for us,

3382
03:03:15,800 --> 03:03:18,200
but we can think of some other places where this would fit in.

3383
03:03:18,200 --> 03:03:18,520
Great.

3384
03:03:18,520 --> 03:03:21,480
Um, I think you did an outstanding job and thank you so much.

3385
03:03:21,560 --> 03:03:26,600
And it's just like, it's like, this was news enough for me tonight between this and knowing

3386
03:03:26,600 --> 03:03:28,680
that pixel poops was at least going to steam.

3387
03:03:28,680 --> 03:03:31,160
I like, Oh, those are going to be some cool announcements tonight.

3388
03:03:31,160 --> 03:03:34,520
And then everything else, uh, was, was just icing on the, on the cake.

3389
03:03:34,520 --> 03:03:36,120
So, um, great job orange.

3390
03:03:36,120 --> 03:03:36,360
Right.

3391
03:03:36,360 --> 03:03:38,280
And thank you so much for that.

3392
03:03:38,280 --> 03:03:39,720
So yeah, it sounds great.

3393
03:03:40,600 --> 03:03:43,640
So, uh, and dark soccer that's, that's you.

3394
03:03:43,640 --> 03:03:50,600
So, so dark soccer, not only did you get your idea released on four different platforms

3395
03:03:50,600 --> 03:03:57,880
now between, between the Vita, uh, and all of that, but now your, your theme song has

3396
03:03:57,880 --> 03:03:58,840
been remixed.

3397
03:04:00,200 --> 03:04:01,400
And what do you think about that?

3398
03:04:02,600 --> 03:04:05,480
I can't even, I can't odd.

3399
03:04:05,480 --> 03:04:07,240
I can't, but thank you.

3400
03:04:07,800 --> 03:04:08,360
It's great.

3401
03:04:08,360 --> 03:04:12,120
I mean, I worked really hard on it, so thank you.

3402
03:04:12,120 --> 03:04:12,620
Yeah.

3403
03:04:13,320 --> 03:04:14,120
All right.

3404
03:04:14,120 --> 03:04:18,280
Um, let's get to some, uh, final, that was it for the emails tonight, right?

3405
03:04:19,080 --> 03:04:19,640
Yeah.

3406
03:04:19,640 --> 03:04:20,760
Participate.

3407
03:04:20,760 --> 03:04:21,260
Oh, go ahead.

3408
03:04:22,040 --> 03:04:25,160
I was going to say that I have a last minute story right now.

3409
03:04:25,160 --> 03:04:25,400
Sure.

3410
03:04:25,400 --> 03:04:29,160
Let me just quickly say, if anybody wants to email us in a future week, participate

3411
03:04:29,160 --> 03:04:32,040
at orange launch radio.com is the place to do it.

3412
03:04:32,040 --> 03:04:33,800
So, um, dark soccer, that being said.

3413
03:04:35,480 --> 03:04:39,880
So basically someone now has it to where you can run doom on a pregnancy test.

3414
03:04:40,920 --> 03:04:42,680
Wait, didn't that come up on a prior show?

3415
03:04:42,680 --> 03:04:43,720
That was a while ago.

3416
03:04:43,720 --> 03:04:44,440
I did it.

3417
03:04:44,440 --> 03:04:44,840
Yeah.

3418
03:04:44,840 --> 03:04:46,440
Cause I thought it was a more recent one.

3419
03:04:47,960 --> 03:04:48,200
Okay.

3420
03:04:48,200 --> 03:04:49,240
I might be wrong on it.

3421
03:04:50,200 --> 03:04:52,040
Or they got it running on a new one.

3422
03:04:52,040 --> 03:04:54,760
It might, it might be the same one that it was.

3423
03:04:54,760 --> 03:04:56,280
It had an updated date on it.

3424
03:04:56,280 --> 03:04:57,480
So nevermind.

3425
03:04:57,480 --> 03:04:58,440
No worries.

3426
03:04:58,440 --> 03:05:03,960
Cause I was putting that in, uh, in, uh, uh, you know, playing on a toaster,

3427
03:05:05,080 --> 03:05:06,200
you know, thing.

3428
03:05:06,200 --> 03:05:09,080
So I've got a last minute news if you want.

3429
03:05:09,080 --> 03:05:09,240
Yeah.

3430
03:05:09,240 --> 03:05:09,740
Please.

3431
03:05:10,440 --> 03:05:16,520
So it's when galaxies is file a counterclaim against Billy Mitchell over the, uh, his lawsuit,

3432
03:05:16,520 --> 03:05:17,160
I would believe.

3433
03:05:17,160 --> 03:05:23,400
So, um, it says both Billy Mitchell and Walter day knew that these score performances were fake,

3434
03:05:23,400 --> 03:05:28,520
but it still included the scores on twin galaxies score database because of their need for

3435
03:05:28,520 --> 03:05:34,920
self-aggrandization, their adverse and their desire to create perceived value for the database.

3436
03:05:34,920 --> 03:05:40,040
So they could one day sell twin galaxies and a twin galaxy score database and take

3437
03:05:40,040 --> 03:05:41,240
the money for themselves.

3438
03:05:42,040 --> 03:05:44,520
Um, yeah.

3439
03:05:44,520 --> 03:05:49,880
So apparently the there's a court hearing set to happen on December 11th.

3440
03:05:49,880 --> 03:05:52,600
So I guess we'll hear more about this maybe next week.

3441
03:05:53,720 --> 03:05:55,160
No, I don't want to hear about it.

3442
03:05:55,160 --> 03:05:59,000
This drama is 40 years old.

3443
03:06:01,080 --> 03:06:06,200
This drama is 40 years old give or take.

3444
03:06:06,200 --> 03:06:12,840
Like I, I can't believe that we still have like three hour YouTube and maybe this is

3445
03:06:12,840 --> 03:06:15,000
a cell phone because of the length of our show.

3446
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:20,920
I can't believe they have like three hour YouTubes dedicated to discussing the 99 reasons

3447
03:06:20,920 --> 03:06:22,760
why Billy Mitchell sucks.

3448
03:06:22,760 --> 03:06:29,480
Uh, reason number 41 will shock you, you know, in these times, I just like, don't we have

3449
03:06:29,480 --> 03:06:33,880
other things to do than worry about twin galaxies drama from the past?

3450
03:06:34,680 --> 03:06:36,280
Like, don't we have other things now?

3451
03:06:36,840 --> 03:06:37,560
Like, it's just,

3452
03:06:40,840 --> 03:06:41,880
anyway, sorry, Loki.

3453
03:06:41,880 --> 03:06:43,000
It's not a dig at you.

3454
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:48,520
I realize this is what's going around in gaming culture, but I'm just like, y'all stop.

3455
03:06:51,800 --> 03:06:52,300
All right.

3456
03:06:53,800 --> 03:06:54,280
That it?

3457
03:06:54,280 --> 03:06:54,840
That's it.

3458
03:06:54,840 --> 03:06:55,320
All right.

3459
03:06:55,320 --> 03:06:55,800
That's it.

3460
03:06:55,800 --> 03:06:56,920
I think it's time we wrap up the show.

3461
03:06:56,920 --> 03:06:58,360
We're over three hours at this point.

3462
03:06:58,360 --> 03:07:00,360
And like Dar Sakura said, we got to work tomorrow.

3463
03:07:00,360 --> 03:07:03,160
Um, but, um, y'all made tonight wonderful.

3464
03:07:03,160 --> 03:07:03,880
Uh, thank you.

3465
03:07:03,880 --> 03:07:04,520
Orange, right.

3466
03:07:04,520 --> 03:07:04,920
Thank you.

3467
03:07:04,920 --> 03:07:05,720
Y Y R.

3468
03:07:05,720 --> 03:07:06,920
Thank you, Loki.

3469
03:07:06,920 --> 03:07:08,440
Uh, thank you, chatters.

3470
03:07:08,440 --> 03:07:10,040
Uh, thank you, listeners.

3471
03:07:10,040 --> 03:07:12,760
Thank you, everybody who participates with this program.

3472
03:07:12,760 --> 03:07:13,800
Thank you, Jamie.

3473
03:07:13,800 --> 03:07:14,920
Thank you, me.

3474
03:07:14,920 --> 03:07:19,480
Uh, thank you, uh, to everybody that, you know, helps put the show together every week.

3475
03:07:19,480 --> 03:07:24,280
Uh, tonight, this is just a lot of big smiles tonight all over the board.

3476
03:07:24,280 --> 03:07:29,560
Just kind of like watching, like what has come of, uh, of the culture of this show,

3477
03:07:29,560 --> 03:07:34,280
even if it's a giant turd, um, that's actually a compliment.

3478
03:07:34,280 --> 03:07:38,280
Um, it's, it's just great feelings.

3479
03:07:38,280 --> 03:07:41,080
So, um, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio,

3480
03:07:41,080 --> 03:07:43,160
please tell a friend or two about the show.

3481
03:07:43,160 --> 03:07:46,360
Uh, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

3482
03:07:46,360 --> 03:07:50,920
But if the voices aren't there to put out on air, uh, we have to spread the word of

3483
03:07:50,920 --> 03:07:52,200
Pixel Poops at the end of the day.

3484
03:07:52,200 --> 03:07:53,720
That's really what it's all about.

3485
03:07:53,720 --> 03:07:57,720
Um, and, um, yeah, that's, that's, that's what I got.

3486
03:07:57,720 --> 03:08:00,040
I don't even remember the rest of what I'm supposed to say at the end of the show.

3487
03:08:00,040 --> 03:08:01,400
Cause it's just been that kind of night.

3488
03:08:01,400 --> 03:08:03,720
Five star review wherever you found this podcast.

3489
03:08:03,960 --> 03:08:05,080
Auto hosting on Twitch.

3490
03:08:05,080 --> 03:08:07,400
Don't forget the VOG Network Docs.com shop.

3491
03:08:07,400 --> 03:08:08,920
Uh, I think those are all the highlights.

3492
03:08:08,920 --> 03:08:13,160
So let's get around to everybody's final thoughts tonight.

3493
03:08:13,160 --> 03:08:17,560
Uh, Loki, you can start cause you've already, uh, hijacked this show once tonight.

3494
03:08:18,360 --> 03:08:22,680
Um, I guess I'll just keep you guys updated on, uh, my progress with the game now.

3495
03:08:22,680 --> 03:08:25,560
So we can now I can openly talk about it.

3496
03:08:25,560 --> 03:08:28,840
I can show you pictures and stuff of what I'm working on.

3497
03:08:28,840 --> 03:08:30,200
You can give us the straight shit.

3498
03:08:31,000 --> 03:08:31,880
Yes, exactly.

3499
03:08:31,880 --> 03:08:32,280
All right.

3500
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:41,640
Um, my final thought tonight is, um, I don't, I just, just, I I'm, I'm feeling great about,

3501
03:08:41,640 --> 03:08:46,360
uh, just all of you that participate with the show and really interact with it and have

3502
03:08:46,360 --> 03:08:50,280
made this show a part of all of our lives over the past 18 years.

3503
03:08:50,280 --> 03:08:51,960
I'm just, I'm, I'm just thrilled.

3504
03:08:51,960 --> 03:08:54,920
Um, and thank you YYR for that.

3505
03:08:55,640 --> 03:08:58,440
Pleasant little surprise you dropped on us tonight.

3506
03:08:58,440 --> 03:08:59,880
Uh, I love it.

3507
03:08:59,880 --> 03:09:01,960
So, and of course, Loki, but he already knows that.

3508
03:09:02,440 --> 03:09:04,440
Uh, Jamie, last but not least.

3509
03:09:05,640 --> 03:09:07,480
Um, shit.

3510
03:09:10,360 --> 03:09:10,860
Yeah.

3511
03:09:12,840 --> 03:09:14,520
And that's really all that needs to be said.

3512
03:09:14,520 --> 03:09:16,600
We hope you have an amazing week, everybody.

3513
03:09:16,600 --> 03:09:19,800
