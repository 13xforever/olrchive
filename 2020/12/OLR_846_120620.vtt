00:00.000 --> 00:13.560
This week on the 30 Second Homebrew Report, Nintendo adds two convenient means for data

00:13.560 --> 00:17.160
access which hackers are no doubt already using to attempt data manipulation and security

00:17.160 --> 00:18.160
bypasses.

00:18.160 --> 00:21.480
The two features, those being wireless QR code and web server based image and video

00:21.480 --> 00:25.740
delivery and direct USB connections are pretty damn convenient so it benefits everyone except

00:25.740 --> 00:27.400
Nintendo's own security team.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.240
That's all for this week's 30 Second Homebrew Report.

00:29.240 --> 00:32.400
Now it's time for Orange Lounge Radio with your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and

00:32.400 --> 00:35.240
Loki to talk more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right

00:35.240 --> 00:37.240
now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.240 --> 00:44.680
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

00:44.680 --> 00:46.520
every gamer has a voice.

00:46.520 --> 00:53.960
It is another edition of Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 846 of our

00:53.960 --> 00:58.160
show for this December the 8th of 2020.

00:58.160 --> 01:02.920
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me tonight are my co-hosts, although the video seems

01:02.920 --> 01:07.280
to be messing up which is strange but we'll get that fixed, say hello to DarkSakura or

01:07.280 --> 01:08.280
Jamie Summers.

01:08.280 --> 01:09.280
Hello.

01:09.280 --> 01:10.280
Hi, how are you?

01:10.280 --> 01:11.280
I'm alright.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.280
Good.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.280
It's been a day.

01:13.280 --> 01:21.460
Yes, yes and now it's coming on over to the show here but that's alright because I'm having

01:21.460 --> 01:25.180
massive video problems and we can't see you yet but we will get that fixed.

01:25.180 --> 01:26.180
Really?

01:26.180 --> 01:29.160
No, it's not your guys' fault, it's something weird on my side, I'm not sure what exactly

01:29.160 --> 01:32.140
is going on but I will fix it.

01:32.140 --> 01:37.980
Don't worry, mama will fix it but we missed you last week but I hope Dan had a great birthday.

01:37.980 --> 01:39.760
He did.

01:39.760 --> 01:48.880
We had a chocolate orange cake thanks to Becky and played some games and some pinball and

01:48.880 --> 01:54.040
really just hung around and had cake, there was cake and it was not a lie, it was absolutely

01:54.040 --> 01:55.040
delicious.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.040
Nice.

01:56.040 --> 02:01.160
So I just realized what is wrong and why it's not working on Discord and this is a little

02:01.160 --> 02:04.720
bit of a vulnerability tonight so I have to do some fixing live on air here.

02:04.720 --> 02:09.960
For some reason, we are all in the public chat tonight, not the private chat.

02:09.960 --> 02:12.780
So anyone could join this show at any moment.

02:12.780 --> 02:18.500
So I'm gonna ask my co-host to please switch to the other channel right now and that's

02:18.500 --> 02:25.540
the joy of doing live radio but it also explains why all of a sudden my Discord was like, I

02:25.540 --> 02:29.940
don't see this window because we were in the wrong chat room.

02:29.940 --> 02:34.500
I wasn't paying attention, I just joined a chat that Jamie was in.

02:34.500 --> 02:35.500
You're fine, it happens.

02:35.500 --> 02:39.140
Yeah, I wasn't paying attention, I just joined a chat.

02:39.140 --> 02:41.620
It's fine, it's kind of funny actually.

02:41.620 --> 02:46.020
I know the whole, so we do tape live of course every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network,

02:46.020 --> 02:50.500
twitch.tv slash vog network, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after

02:50.500 --> 02:55.980
the Bobby Blackwell show and the chat is lighting up going, OMG, OMG, we missed our chance.

02:55.980 --> 02:59.220
We could have jumped in there and taken over the show.

02:59.220 --> 03:01.780
Orange Wright says accidental guest star.

03:01.780 --> 03:04.380
Fifth Dream says we could have all been famous.

03:04.380 --> 03:07.620
Bobby Blackwell says it's funny now that it worked out.

03:07.620 --> 03:12.260
Bobby's pointing out he has special privileges but he will not be using them or he will find

03:12.260 --> 03:15.300
the privileges revoked.

03:15.300 --> 03:17.940
We'll go record on a different discord.

03:17.940 --> 03:19.940
But anyway, no, I'm teasing.

03:19.940 --> 03:22.500
Anyway, hi, so now we got all that taken care of.

03:22.500 --> 03:25.300
That's part of the joy of taping live is that sometimes there's a little mess ups.

03:25.300 --> 03:29.340
I actually kind of like that because that was a little clue that something was wrong

03:29.340 --> 03:32.340
and it told us that, hey, we got to go to the other channel.

03:32.340 --> 03:35.660
So it's interesting, human proof.

03:35.660 --> 03:36.660
I love it.

03:36.660 --> 03:39.980
All right, anyway, also joining us of course, Techmaster Loki.

03:39.980 --> 03:41.340
How are you, Loki?

03:41.340 --> 03:42.340
I'm doing good.

03:42.340 --> 03:43.420
I'm overly full.

03:43.420 --> 03:49.460
I made White Castle burgers, well, like homemade White Castle burgers, and I ate way too many

03:49.460 --> 03:50.460
of them.

03:50.460 --> 03:51.660
Now, here's kind of regretting it.

03:51.660 --> 03:52.660
Here's the thing.

03:52.660 --> 03:55.700
I finally tried White Castle for the first time because remember, this is one of those

03:55.700 --> 03:59.860
things that doesn't exist in California, like Waffle House and countless other.

03:59.860 --> 04:03.300
I was going to say Cracker Barrel, but that's not true anymore.

04:03.300 --> 04:04.300
They finally built those here.

04:04.300 --> 04:05.300
Steak and Shake.

04:05.300 --> 04:07.380
They were here for like two minutes and then they were gone.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.220
There's still one in LA.

04:09.220 --> 04:10.220
Who is there?

04:10.220 --> 04:11.220
Northern Northern.

04:11.220 --> 04:12.220
Yeah.

04:12.220 --> 04:13.220
Yeah, downtown LA.

04:13.220 --> 04:17.100
There's a lot of stuff in the rest of the country we don't have in California.

04:17.100 --> 04:18.420
So White Castle is one of them.

04:18.420 --> 04:23.780
So I had it for the very first time when I was in Las Vegas, of all places, apparently

04:23.780 --> 04:24.780
has one.

04:24.780 --> 04:26.400
But Las Vegas is a great place for food.

04:26.400 --> 04:31.300
And this was just like a year, no, it had been over a year ago because it was pre-COVID

04:31.300 --> 04:32.300
and all this stuff.

04:32.300 --> 04:34.340
Maybe it was last fall, last spring.

04:34.340 --> 04:38.700
Whenever I went and saw the Gwen Stefani show, we went to White Castle for the first time.

04:38.700 --> 04:40.540
I thought it was disgusting.

04:40.540 --> 04:42.040
I thought it was disgusting.

04:42.040 --> 04:44.220
I can't stand the way they cook the burgers there.

04:44.220 --> 04:45.880
They're like steam cooked.

04:45.880 --> 04:46.880
That is not the way.

04:46.880 --> 04:48.620
I don't need wet, sloppy meat.

04:48.620 --> 04:51.240
And no wonder only stoners like it.

04:51.240 --> 04:53.640
It wasn't like that at all.

04:53.640 --> 04:55.320
I was tempted.

04:55.320 --> 05:01.760
The reason why I made them is because I bought last week these TGI Friday sliders and they

05:01.760 --> 05:02.760
were just kind of eh.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.100
They look like they're better than the White Castle ones.

05:05.100 --> 05:10.040
I bought the Frozen White Castle ones before and they weren't very good.

05:10.040 --> 05:12.600
They're all like soggy, like you said.

05:12.600 --> 05:17.120
So I looked for a recipe while I was at the store today so that I could make some.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.600
And I mean, it turned out really good.

05:18.600 --> 05:24.040
It's just that I chopped up a whole large onion over the whole thing.

05:24.040 --> 05:28.480
And so I like onions, my family, not so much.

05:28.480 --> 05:32.760
And so it was a little too oniony for them.

05:32.760 --> 05:36.960
I thought it was great though, but the next batch I make just won't have that layer of

05:36.960 --> 05:37.960
onions on top.

05:37.960 --> 05:40.520
I thought that's kind of what makes White Castle burgers anyways.

05:40.520 --> 05:45.240
It might have been OK if it was cooked your way, like in an oven as opposed to steamed.

05:45.240 --> 05:46.920
I think that was the part that turned me off the most.

05:46.920 --> 05:52.620
I was like, and the chat is all yelling at me, telling me how wrong I am, y'all, whatever.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.000
You know, here's the thing.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.520
I'm glad that the California thing is in and out compared to that, because as overrated

05:58.520 --> 06:03.520
as I think in and out is, it's like I would never wait 12 hours in a line or whatever

06:03.520 --> 06:06.720
those people were doing in Colorado.

06:06.720 --> 06:09.640
I agree with Bobby that Crystal is better than White Castle.

06:09.640 --> 06:10.640
I will die on that hill.

06:10.640 --> 06:11.640
I don't know if I've had Crystal.

06:11.640 --> 06:14.420
I don't think I've had that.

06:14.420 --> 06:18.400
Crystal is definitely more of a Southeastern kind of thing.

06:18.400 --> 06:23.680
They're not doing that great financially, but you know, I grew up with Crystal and eating

06:23.680 --> 06:28.880
corn pups and little tiny corn dogs and they had little tiny donuts too.

06:28.880 --> 06:29.880
It was awesome.

06:29.880 --> 06:32.880
It's just, you know, the best micro food.

06:32.880 --> 06:34.940
That sounds like A&W a little bit.

06:34.940 --> 06:40.220
Like if, well, I mean, almost all of them are combined with KFC now, but if you can

06:40.220 --> 06:44.800
find an A&W standalone, there are some out there and that's the kind of stuff they have.

06:44.800 --> 06:48.220
Did you know, fun fact, I didn't know this till recently, A&W started in Sacramento where

06:48.220 --> 06:49.220
our show is based.

06:49.220 --> 06:50.220
Did you know that?

06:50.220 --> 06:51.220
I actually did know that.

06:51.220 --> 06:52.220
Yeah.

06:52.220 --> 06:53.220
No, I never knew that till recently.

06:53.220 --> 06:54.220
I was like, oh, that's fun.

06:54.220 --> 06:56.260
And I'll tell you where I was when I learned it.

06:56.260 --> 06:59.100
In the mall that I worked at in Mobile, Alabama.

06:59.100 --> 07:00.100
Yeah.

07:00.100 --> 07:04.700
One of my friends was a manager there and she, you know, it was actually when I was

07:04.700 --> 07:07.660
going to be moving out here, she's like, oh yeah, that's where the company started

07:07.660 --> 07:08.660
at.

07:08.660 --> 07:09.660
Really?

07:09.660 --> 07:10.660
Yeah.

07:10.660 --> 07:13.620
There's like even old ones out there and they're not in a mall.

07:13.620 --> 07:14.620
What?

07:14.620 --> 07:20.180
I think the most famous thing that was started in Sacramento, okay, and I'm in this mindset

07:20.180 --> 07:21.180
today.

07:21.180 --> 07:23.740
Yes, we are a video game show, but you know what tangents, they happen.

07:23.740 --> 07:24.820
Well, sure.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.220
There's that band.

07:26.220 --> 07:29.780
But I was going to say, because there's a meme going around on Twitter right now that

07:29.780 --> 07:36.980
is, um, describe how old you are with the name of a store.

07:36.980 --> 07:41.060
And a lot of people are saying Montgomery wards, uh, Mervins.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.020
I thought Alan's answer was perfect.

07:43.020 --> 07:44.020
Gemco.

07:44.020 --> 07:45.020
That's a great one.

07:45.020 --> 07:46.020
Merchandise.

07:46.020 --> 07:47.020
What's that?

07:47.020 --> 07:48.020
Service merchandise.

07:48.020 --> 07:50.020
Oh, I didn't even know that one.

07:50.020 --> 07:51.020
It became best.

07:51.020 --> 07:52.020
I think.

07:52.020 --> 07:53.020
Oh, best.

07:53.020 --> 07:54.020
Oh, that's another one.

07:54.020 --> 07:57.100
Um, but I, my answer was Mervins and wine stocks.

07:57.100 --> 07:58.900
My mom's two favorite stores.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.020
Yeah.

08:00.020 --> 08:01.020
That's a, that's a good one.

08:01.020 --> 08:02.740
And wine stocks is another Sacramento thing.

08:02.740 --> 08:07.940
But here's the answer that is being said, uh, that I caught that is a Sacramento icon

08:07.940 --> 08:11.120
tower records was started in Sacramento.

08:11.120 --> 08:15.740
That's why you have, um, down in the old, not an old town, downtown, you have the tower

08:15.740 --> 08:16.740
theater.

08:16.740 --> 08:17.740
Yeah.

08:17.740 --> 08:18.740
The tower cafe.

08:18.740 --> 08:19.740
That's all right there.

08:19.740 --> 08:23.260
The tower records started in the back of the drug store that was there.

08:23.260 --> 08:24.260
Technically not gone.

08:24.260 --> 08:25.740
They still have tower records.

08:25.740 --> 08:26.980
It's just an online site now.

08:26.980 --> 08:27.980
Yeah.

08:28.060 --> 08:31.220
And I think they have standalone still in other countries where it was kind of like

08:31.220 --> 08:35.100
franchised out, but it is, it does not exist in the way that it used to here in the States

08:35.100 --> 08:39.420
because obviously a lot changed with, uh, the record industry when everything went digital.

08:39.420 --> 08:43.980
I think another way I could age myself is Virgin mega store on market street in San

08:43.980 --> 08:45.220
Francisco.

08:45.220 --> 08:51.500
That was, uh, like that was going, that was going to the Mormon temple for me.

08:51.500 --> 08:52.500
Okay.

08:52.500 --> 08:53.500
That was Salt Lake city.

08:54.500 --> 09:01.980
That was the motherland gay first department store, which was more Southern.

09:01.980 --> 09:02.980
All right.

09:02.980 --> 09:03.980
Yeah.

09:03.980 --> 09:05.300
Let's get into video games.

09:05.300 --> 09:07.600
Let's talk about the kickoff topic for tonight.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.740
We have a big event in games this week.

09:09.740 --> 09:14.260
It's kind of like the, it's become the winter E3 over the years of sorts that game awards

09:14.260 --> 09:15.320
are happening this week.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.740
They're happening on Thursday.

09:16.740 --> 09:21.660
Um, I just found out they're earlier than usual, so I may not be able to do it live.

09:21.660 --> 09:22.900
It's four o'clock Pacific.

09:23.300 --> 09:26.780
So it's seven o'clock Eastern, but that's to be a little more worldwide friendly, but

09:26.780 --> 09:28.700
it sounds like it's even earlier than that.

09:28.700 --> 09:31.820
It's says they have a pre-show starting at three 30 Pacific.

09:31.820 --> 09:35.660
So that's when they're going to have five world premiers in there.

09:35.660 --> 09:40.540
So five premiers during the pre-show during the pre-show plus a musical performance.

09:40.540 --> 09:44.300
I have to plug this by the way, at the top of the show, because I think everybody is

09:44.300 --> 09:45.760
aware dark soccer.

09:45.760 --> 09:48.440
You may not be cause you weren't here last week cause of Dan's birthday.

09:48.440 --> 09:53.440
But speaking of premiers, we have one for you on OLR tonight, dark soccer.

09:53.440 --> 09:56.460
You actually do know, cause I told you before the show, but the X prize.

09:56.460 --> 10:05.520
So so our pal YYR has sent an eight minute pixel poops direct that we're going to be

10:05.520 --> 10:07.000
airing during the show tonight.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.840
I only know that's what it's called.

10:08.840 --> 10:09.840
I haven't seen it.

10:09.840 --> 10:12.400
I promised YYR I would not watch it.

10:12.400 --> 10:17.280
So I don't know if he's going to announce a pixel poops thing on steam.

10:17.280 --> 10:19.600
That's my steamy poop.

10:19.600 --> 10:20.600
That's my guess.

10:20.600 --> 10:21.600
Steamy poop.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.600
That's my guess.

10:22.600 --> 10:25.040
That's some cool steamy shit.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.440
There may be something else to it.

10:26.440 --> 10:27.440
I don't know.

10:27.440 --> 10:29.160
So we're going to, we're going to find out live tonight.

10:29.160 --> 10:32.080
We're going to do that after classic game of the week.

10:32.080 --> 10:38.740
So, so how about that y'all the, the pre pre game awards pre-show here with our own reveal

10:38.740 --> 10:43.280
coming up later in the show, we love YYR for sharing his goodness here, creator of the

10:43.280 --> 10:46.040
fabulous game, super multitasking, if you haven't played that yet.

10:46.040 --> 10:49.040
So we'll be doing that after classic game of the week, a little later in the show, that's

10:49.040 --> 10:53.000
where we used to do video segments before I got lazy and stopped making them.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
So thank you.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Yeah.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
I remember that.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Yeah.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.400
Did you know also next week is our two year anniversary of being on Twitch, give or take

11:00.400 --> 11:01.400
nope.

11:01.400 --> 11:06.000
I did not know that even though our show started back in 2002 and we were on, you know, shout

11:06.000 --> 11:08.200
cast, which was got in a variety of ways.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.960
Some people pulled it in through iTunes.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.940
Some people pulled it in through win app or whatever.

11:11.940 --> 11:15.100
The tune in app was really popular towards the end.

11:15.100 --> 11:19.580
Even though we were on that for years and years, we made the move to Twitch two years

11:19.580 --> 11:20.580
ago.

11:20.580 --> 11:25.180
Well, for the second time we moved to Twitch because remember we were on Justin TV in those

11:25.180 --> 11:26.980
years I lived in that house out in Rancho.

11:26.980 --> 11:27.980
We use the garage.

11:27.980 --> 11:33.080
I remember that we were on Justin for a little bit, but anyway, in its current form, we've

11:33.080 --> 11:35.580
been on Twitch TV for two years coming up next week.

11:35.580 --> 11:36.580
So pretty cool.

11:36.580 --> 11:37.580
All right.

11:37.580 --> 11:40.660
Anyhow, I'm sorry, Loki, we were supposed to talk about the game awards, but I had to

11:40.660 --> 11:43.980
derail with our own announcement, but please tell us a little bit about what we're going

11:43.980 --> 11:46.960
to be expecting on Thursday.

11:46.960 --> 11:52.140
So we're going to get a pre-show that they're going to start at looks like three 30 Pacific

11:52.140 --> 11:58.540
or six 30 Eastern with already within just the pre-show and it's going to have five world

11:58.540 --> 11:59.780
premieres.

11:59.780 --> 12:02.260
So we'll have to see what that means.

12:02.260 --> 12:06.580
And then of course, during the show, I'm sure there'll be a lot more than that, but that's

12:06.580 --> 12:07.580
kind of crazy.

12:07.580 --> 12:12.420
So it's going to be hosted by Sydney Goodman for the pre-show.

12:12.420 --> 12:17.380
And then during the actual show, we know that there's going to be an appearance by Reggie

12:17.380 --> 12:21.660
Fils-Aime, who's going to be a presenter for the show as well.

12:21.660 --> 12:24.860
I'm not sure what category he's presenting, but that'd be pretty interesting.

12:24.860 --> 12:31.200
I think they've already let him do game of the year in the past, but maybe actually no,

12:31.200 --> 12:34.260
maybe not because maybe there was a perceived Nintendo bias if he did that.

12:34.260 --> 12:36.220
So maybe this will be the year he gets to do game of the year.

12:36.220 --> 12:40.500
I honestly can't remember, but I could see where they might be afraid of a Nintendo bias

12:40.500 --> 12:42.500
if they let him do game of the year previously.

12:42.500 --> 12:46.660
So maybe he'll do it this year now that he is technically no longer in the game industry

12:46.660 --> 12:47.660
at that level.

12:47.660 --> 12:48.660
Yes.

12:48.660 --> 12:49.660
I know there's GameStop board of directors.

12:49.660 --> 12:50.660
That's a very different thing.

12:50.660 --> 12:51.660
Yes.

12:51.660 --> 12:55.060
And then, uh, apparently they're going to have a, one of those premieres that we're

12:55.060 --> 12:57.400
going to see is the next dragon age.

12:57.400 --> 13:02.380
They're going to have a special look, um, at the game wards, which I I'm assuming is

13:02.380 --> 13:06.540
a little bit more substantial than they did during the end seven stuff.

13:06.540 --> 13:09.140
I think that's when they were showing off all that.

13:09.140 --> 13:13.420
So, so yeah, we'll, um, have to check it out.

13:13.420 --> 13:15.700
It's just a few days away.

13:15.700 --> 13:16.700
Yeah.

13:16.700 --> 13:17.700
Very excited about that.

13:17.700 --> 13:22.420
Um, any yesterday was unofficial dragon age day.

13:22.420 --> 13:25.660
There was some crazy stuff though, but we'll get to that later in the show.

13:25.660 --> 13:26.660
It's coming up.

13:26.660 --> 13:27.660
Yeah.

13:27.660 --> 13:30.740
When I say BioWare, there was some crazy shit that went down this week, but we will get

13:30.740 --> 13:31.740
to it all in good time.

13:31.740 --> 13:32.740
All in good time.

13:32.740 --> 13:35.380
Um, but, uh, big announcements for game awards.

13:35.380 --> 13:39.760
I mean, I I've been calling it kind of like winter E3 because, you know, Jeff's done a

13:39.760 --> 13:46.460
really good job ever since he kind of took over what spike TV kind of had, um, that thing.

13:46.460 --> 13:48.180
And he tried to really legitimize it.

13:48.180 --> 13:52.380
And I would say, you know, we've, we've been critical of the process sometimes, but the

13:52.380 --> 13:57.580
result where we're at now in the year 2020, or at least, you know, or I should say 2019,

13:57.580 --> 14:02.620
the last one we've actually seen far better than any gaming award show we've really seen

14:02.620 --> 14:03.620
to the present.

14:03.620 --> 14:06.620
Jeff has really transformed the show in, in a great way.

14:06.620 --> 14:09.260
And he's been getting some great game exclusives.

14:09.260 --> 14:15.600
Let's not forget last year's game awards gave us the huge reveal of the name Xbox series

14:15.600 --> 14:21.200
X and what it looked like and the actual reveal of that console, which people were not expecting

14:21.200 --> 14:22.260
that early on.

14:22.260 --> 14:30.580
That was a huge deal could, could we see the often rumored switch pro jump out at us?

14:30.580 --> 14:31.580
This game awards.

14:31.580 --> 14:34.340
I don't want to set expectations at an unreasonable level.

14:34.340 --> 14:37.140
I'm just asking hypotheticals expect nothing.

14:37.140 --> 14:42.060
And you'll always be pleasantly surprised, but any thought could, could Nintendo drop

14:42.060 --> 14:44.620
a huge bombshell on that level?

14:44.620 --> 14:45.620
Any thoughts?

14:45.620 --> 14:46.620
Loki?

14:46.620 --> 14:50.220
I mean, there could always be the new, uh, sure.

14:50.220 --> 14:51.220
Why not?

14:51.220 --> 14:55.580
Um, I don't know what huge announcements they would have.

14:55.580 --> 15:01.340
I mean, maybe, I don't know, because maybe I'm trying to think of something like at the

15:01.340 --> 15:07.220
caliber that they would probably do other than like a direct of their own, um, maybe

15:07.220 --> 15:12.820
a new trailer for the super Mario 3d land or world that they're doing, how they're re-releasing

15:12.820 --> 15:16.700
with some additional content, maybe we'll do something for that.

15:16.700 --> 15:19.780
Maybe they'll put out a fifth Pikmin game.

15:19.780 --> 15:24.820
Um, I could see, you know, Nintendo, I feel like has always been pretty good with the

15:24.820 --> 15:25.820
game awards.

15:25.820 --> 15:29.580
And, and Jeff always, you know, had a great relationship with Reggie Fils-Aime previously.

15:29.700 --> 15:32.900
And I don't see why that hasn't continued with Doug Bowser at the helm now in America.

15:32.900 --> 15:37.020
Um, you know, they, they did a real deep dive on Zelda Breath of the Wild when that was

15:37.020 --> 15:38.020
still anticipated.

15:38.020 --> 15:42.460
Um, maybe we might see some additional footage of Breath of the Wild 2.

15:42.460 --> 15:44.020
It has been quite a while.

15:44.020 --> 15:47.660
Um, I know we're not really expecting that until maybe next holiday, but that would be

15:47.660 --> 15:49.060
quite a treat.

15:49.060 --> 15:56.340
You know, I, what first party games do we know are happening that we've seen footage?

15:56.340 --> 15:57.340
Okay.

15:57.340 --> 15:58.620
There's the Mario 3d land.

15:58.660 --> 16:02.380
So there's, which, which technically we've seen before because it's on Wii U, was on

16:02.380 --> 16:03.380
Wii U.

16:03.380 --> 16:07.700
What Nintendo games at this point do we know are happening and we've seen footage.

16:07.700 --> 16:08.700
Okay.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.500
Breath of the Wild 2 is one of them.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.700
Metroid Prime 4 is not one of them.

16:12.700 --> 16:13.700
We just know it's happening.

16:13.700 --> 16:15.100
We have never seen footage.

16:15.100 --> 16:22.780
Um, there's not a lot, so that's kind of why I'm like, Nintendo might use this opportunity

16:22.780 --> 16:27.380
because yes, they could do their own direct, but this would give them the opportunity to

16:27.380 --> 16:31.420
have a very big audience because you know, the game awards gets, you know, everywhere

16:31.420 --> 16:35.900
and it would kind of relieve the pressure of needing to announce 20 different things

16:35.900 --> 16:39.980
or 10, even 10 different things, five different things by just doing one big thing at the

16:39.980 --> 16:40.980
game awards.

16:40.980 --> 16:43.740
Um, that could be very interesting.

16:43.740 --> 16:46.820
Maybe they will announce that there will be a tournament they're going to not cancel in

16:46.820 --> 16:47.820
the future.

16:47.820 --> 16:49.460
I couldn't resist.

16:49.460 --> 16:50.460
Sorry.

16:50.460 --> 16:51.460
It's, it's pretty fucked up.

16:51.460 --> 16:53.420
We'll get into that later in the show.

16:53.460 --> 16:57.620
Uh, I don't know.

16:57.620 --> 17:03.420
Um, it would be a good idea for them to announce something because they have a different audience.

17:03.420 --> 17:10.020
I think, you know, if you're trying to kind of sway people to come to the Nintendo platform,

17:10.020 --> 17:14.600
you know, the Nintendo directs are good, but it's kind of like more like I'm already invested

17:14.600 --> 17:15.600
in it.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.740
And so I'm curious to what's coming out.

17:17.740 --> 17:22.900
Not necessarily, you know, grabbing the attention of someone that might not be, you know, in

17:22.900 --> 17:24.620
the Nintendo camp right now.

17:24.620 --> 17:25.620
Yeah.

17:25.620 --> 17:30.740
Um, in, I don't know, you just made an excellent case on why they should reveal the switch

17:30.740 --> 17:31.740
pro this week.

17:31.740 --> 17:35.500
Again, I want to be very cautious about where I set the bar for expectations.

17:35.500 --> 17:39.840
I am completely would not be a good week to announce the switch pro right before Christmas.

17:39.840 --> 17:41.340
Like not a good idea.

17:41.340 --> 17:44.600
I think, um, the Xbox was fine.

17:44.600 --> 17:45.600
We know.

17:45.600 --> 17:46.600
Yeah.

17:46.600 --> 17:49.860
But the, but the Xbox, they announced it, but like we knew it was coming already and

17:49.860 --> 17:52.700
they announced, we all know the switch pros coming too.

17:52.700 --> 17:53.700
Come on.

17:53.700 --> 17:56.060
But it's not, it's not confirmed yet.

17:56.060 --> 18:00.100
It's not like they were, you know, saying, Hey, we have this project, blah, blah, blah.

18:00.100 --> 18:04.140
You know, project, what, you know, Waluigi's never going to be in smash.

18:04.140 --> 18:09.120
Um, you know, they don't have something that they're teasing, but then they're like, okay,

18:09.120 --> 18:10.900
and here's what we're calling this console.

18:10.900 --> 18:13.220
We've already told you kind of that it's coming.

18:13.220 --> 18:16.460
They haven't said that they've denied that it's coming so far.

18:16.460 --> 18:20.940
Um, I don't think we'll get an announcement for that until after Christmas, after the

18:20.940 --> 18:23.780
holiday, because they don't want to cut into their sales immediately.

18:23.780 --> 18:29.300
Oh, it's like, Oh yeah, I want to buy the switch for my kids and I've got it all wrapped.

18:29.300 --> 18:30.300
It's under the tree.

18:30.300 --> 18:31.660
Oh, Hey daddy, guess what?

18:31.660 --> 18:33.260
Switch pros coming out.

18:33.260 --> 18:36.180
Uh, yo, fuck Santa.

18:36.180 --> 18:37.180
Okay.

18:37.180 --> 18:38.180
No.

18:38.180 --> 18:39.300
Like you very much.

18:39.300 --> 18:40.300
All right.

18:40.300 --> 18:42.380
You made a good case and then you immediately took that case away.

18:42.380 --> 18:43.380
Good job.

18:43.380 --> 18:49.940
Um, it's just like Nintendo tournament and Nike.

18:49.940 --> 18:50.940
Okay.

18:50.940 --> 19:00.900
Uh, but I, I like the idea of Nintendo using the opportunity to show something to an audience

19:00.900 --> 19:02.660
they don't normally get.

19:02.660 --> 19:04.260
I like that idea.

19:04.260 --> 19:07.300
So show a game that might appeal to a very, very broad audiences.

19:07.300 --> 19:08.300
It'd be interesting.

19:08.300 --> 19:09.300
It'd be interesting to see that.

19:09.300 --> 19:13.140
So they'll just announce that games pass is coming to the switch and we'll all be like,

19:13.140 --> 19:15.740
Oh, you want to, Oh my God.

19:15.740 --> 19:17.180
Wouldn't that be a mic drop?

19:17.180 --> 19:18.180
Holy come.

19:18.180 --> 19:19.180
Oh my God.

19:19.420 --> 19:20.420
I can't even imagine.

19:20.420 --> 19:23.060
Like, I re like they're, they're speculating.

19:23.060 --> 19:26.980
And then there's living in that world where game pass is coming to the switch.

19:26.980 --> 19:30.060
I just, that's a stretch.

19:30.060 --> 19:34.180
Like there's a lot of reasons why I think it would work, but there's also like a lot

19:34.180 --> 19:38.220
of things where I'm like, I don't know if that would really happen, but we'll see.

19:38.220 --> 19:39.220
We'll see.

19:39.220 --> 19:40.220
All right.

19:40.220 --> 19:44.380
Um, anyhow, so we'll see the game awards scheduled to happen on Thursday.

19:44.380 --> 19:48.940
We will be co-streaming the event because Jeff is all about getting us, you know, many

19:48.940 --> 19:50.860
people to stream it as possible.

19:50.860 --> 19:54.300
So you are allowed to kind of co-stream it with your own commentary.

19:54.300 --> 19:59.040
So we are going to do that Thursday night, uh, Bobby Black Wolf will be here for sure.

19:59.040 --> 20:03.300
Some combination of Loki and I will be here, maybe dark soccer if she's not working.

20:03.300 --> 20:04.300
I don't know.

20:04.300 --> 20:08.100
Uh, but that will all be Thursday night, uh, right here at VOG network.

20:08.100 --> 20:12.700
And we try, we try to do our commentary in a, in a, in a tasteful way.

20:12.700 --> 20:15.340
We're not going to crap on everything we see, right?

20:15.340 --> 20:16.340
Loki.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.620
We're not going to crap on everything we see.

20:19.180 --> 20:22.420
I would hope that it doesn't require that for the record.

20:22.420 --> 20:26.020
I, I work until eight 30, so, ah, all right.

20:26.020 --> 20:27.020
So no, no dark soccer.

20:27.020 --> 20:29.580
So, so Loki and I like paying my bills.

20:29.580 --> 20:30.580
That's fair.

20:30.580 --> 20:31.580
Fair.

20:31.580 --> 20:33.300
Um, now, Ooh, good point in our chat.

20:33.300 --> 20:37.800
Y Y R says they did tease big game pass news this month.

20:37.800 --> 20:38.800
That's right.

20:38.800 --> 20:41.140
Wasn't that, wasn't that control though, coming to the game?

20:41.140 --> 20:43.540
No, there's been a tweet after that.

20:43.540 --> 20:46.740
That was like, Oh yeah, we're just getting started.

20:46.740 --> 20:49.220
And I think it even said something about the game awards.

20:49.220 --> 20:55.100
Like they're going to announce another, but like, in my opinion, they could leverage the

20:55.100 --> 21:00.400
Bethesda thing to be like Skyrim Oblivion now on game pass.

21:00.400 --> 21:04.760
And that would still qualify as a big game drop, even though those games are how old

21:04.760 --> 21:07.640
at this point and how many people have played them.

21:07.640 --> 21:11.480
But I think it would still make headlines for more of the Bethesda catalog to make its

21:11.480 --> 21:12.740
way to game pass.

21:12.740 --> 21:16.820
So, so like that's, that's, that's my realistic place to set the bar.

21:16.820 --> 21:19.460
The Nintendo thing is living in fantasy land.

21:19.460 --> 21:24.620
Let's be, let's be real, but weird things have happened in this industry.

21:24.620 --> 21:26.620
So all right.

21:26.620 --> 21:27.660
Um, okay.

21:27.660 --> 21:29.560
So that'll be the game awards Thursday night.

21:29.560 --> 21:32.980
Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games we've been playing

21:32.980 --> 21:33.980
this week.

21:33.980 --> 21:37.540
Maybe our games of the year, maybe not, uh, dark soccer, why don't we start with you?

21:37.540 --> 21:39.700
How was your gaming week?

21:39.700 --> 21:48.180
It was Animal Crossing-tastic and, um, uh, I've got Fire Emblem, the, the redone in English

21:48.180 --> 21:49.180
Fire Emblem.

21:49.180 --> 21:50.180
I haven't started it yet.

21:50.180 --> 21:51.180
Yeah.

21:51.180 --> 21:52.180
I forgot that came out.

21:52.180 --> 21:53.180
Yeah.

21:53.180 --> 21:54.180
Yeah.

21:54.180 --> 21:55.180
I mean, it wasn't very expensive.

21:55.180 --> 21:56.180
Um, yeah.

21:56.180 --> 22:05.260
A little cuphead, um, uh, mostly it's just been, um, because of, uh, some goings on,

22:05.260 --> 22:08.060
um, you know, and with Dan's birthday and some stuff.

22:08.060 --> 22:12.860
So a lot of Animal Crossing, cause that's still, still my jam.

22:12.860 --> 22:18.180
Still playing in my little virtual world because it's a lot better than the one that sucks.

22:18.180 --> 22:19.180
All good.

22:19.180 --> 22:20.660
So when I say, were you playing your game of the year?

22:20.660 --> 22:22.260
The answer is yes, you were.

22:22.260 --> 22:23.260
Yes, I was.

22:23.260 --> 22:27.700
No, no, I'm, I'm, it's, it's game of the year for me.

22:27.700 --> 22:28.700
Absolutely.

22:28.700 --> 22:33.620
And on top of that though, um, I actually am thinking of getting Ring Fit considering

22:33.620 --> 22:35.140
it.

22:35.140 --> 22:37.420
It's because it's neat.

22:37.420 --> 22:39.340
I have it, but I had a lot of problems.

22:39.340 --> 22:40.740
I can't get that.

22:40.740 --> 22:45.300
I can't get the strap on to, to stay on my leg.

22:45.300 --> 22:46.500
It keeps slipping off.

22:46.500 --> 22:49.780
Like, I don't know what I'm, let me borrow it.

22:49.780 --> 22:51.700
Let me borrow that top.

22:51.700 --> 22:52.700
Let me borrow that strap.

22:52.700 --> 23:01.260
I want to use it, but I mean, I've been, um, I, I might have mentioned this before.

23:01.260 --> 23:07.340
I've been really putting a lot into, um, personal fitness and I weight train six days a week.

23:07.340 --> 23:15.020
So I was looking for something fun that would supplement it either that, or I may be hooking

23:15.020 --> 23:17.940
up to play, um, DDR again.

23:17.940 --> 23:18.940
You should.

23:18.940 --> 23:19.940
One of my home pads.

23:19.940 --> 23:20.940
I miss DDR.

23:20.940 --> 23:21.940
Yeah.

23:21.940 --> 23:26.940
Or maybe Para Para, but that means I'd have to dig out the PS2 and everything, but look,

23:26.940 --> 23:32.580
I have the gun show kind of, I still have, is it here in the studio somewhere?

23:32.580 --> 23:34.180
You may or may not remember.

23:34.180 --> 23:41.660
I have that unopened PlayStation 2 copy of like DDR extreme 2 that also has a dance mat.

23:41.660 --> 23:43.740
So there's a brand new dance mat.

23:43.740 --> 23:45.640
I don't even know where the hell that came from.

23:45.640 --> 23:46.640
I can't remember.

23:46.640 --> 23:52.380
Well, if people look behind me on cam, those that are here, we had to clean out our garage

23:52.380 --> 23:56.260
because we put in a new floor and there's just like some of the stuff like, Oh, I forgot

23:56.260 --> 23:57.260
I had that.

23:57.260 --> 23:58.260
Oh, I forgot.

23:58.260 --> 23:59.260
I had that too.

23:59.260 --> 24:01.440
Oh, look, it's the Dreamcast dance pads, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

24:01.440 --> 24:05.840
So out of curiosity, did you carpet your garage to give it that pinball arcade feel or no?

24:05.840 --> 24:06.840
Oh, I thought you might've.

24:06.840 --> 24:07.840
No, no, no.

24:07.840 --> 24:12.280
Dan was, Dan was like, yeah, we're going to put up like a brick veneer or something on

24:12.280 --> 24:15.880
the walls and, you know, make it look kind of like old school barcade ish.

24:15.880 --> 24:19.480
And I'm like, no, if you want to look like an old school arcade, you have to carpet half

24:19.480 --> 24:20.480
of the wall.

24:20.480 --> 24:21.480
True.

24:21.480 --> 24:22.480
True story.

24:22.480 --> 24:23.480
True.

24:23.480 --> 24:30.040
I, and this has actually happened to me twice in my life from wall carpet.

24:30.040 --> 24:37.040
Once I got knocked over by some asshole at, at the time it was the old Aladdin's castle

24:37.040 --> 24:40.780
right after my little brother had gotten hit by a car.

24:40.780 --> 24:46.120
It was that same night that, um, that we beat teenage mutant turtles with a bunch of strangers

24:46.120 --> 24:47.620
where they kept paying for me to play.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.600
And then they shut down the game as we won.

24:49.600 --> 24:56.600
Um, but I got pushed into the wall and got, um, rug burn on my gene clad legs that tore

24:56.600 --> 24:58.040
through the jeans.

24:58.040 --> 25:00.560
The only other time that happened was roller skating.

25:00.560 --> 25:04.240
Why did some asshole push you into a wall?

25:04.240 --> 25:05.240
Fuck those people.

25:05.240 --> 25:10.840
He was just a big person that didn't notice, you know, little, and at the time I was shorter,

25:10.840 --> 25:12.800
so it was like five foot one or something.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.360
I'm five, three now.

25:14.360 --> 25:17.360
So yeah, still, I mean, that's still, yeah.

25:17.360 --> 25:22.780
Um, now though, someone pushes me up, push him right back, uh, going to our chat for

25:22.780 --> 25:27.620
some comments on a dark soccer's gaming week, uh, SGA 100 Matt talking about ring fit, uh,

25:27.620 --> 25:29.500
saying I used it a lot during the pandemic.

25:29.500 --> 25:31.740
It's a hard workout and really fun to play.

25:31.740 --> 25:34.120
I lost some weight playing it earlier in the year.

25:34.120 --> 25:36.100
Then I gained some of it back by being lazy.

25:36.100 --> 25:38.020
Uh, Misty OLR is cheering.

25:38.020 --> 25:39.020
Yay.

25:39.020 --> 25:42.940
Bring out the biscuits because, uh, Para Para, uh, the home version had those pink biscuits

25:42.940 --> 25:46.060
or you could get that knockoff version for the dream cast where they were like that ugly

25:46.060 --> 25:49.860
green that like, yeah, right.

25:49.860 --> 25:52.580
Uh, bonds double six says, where's the, we dance pad.

25:52.580 --> 25:55.940
Uh, there was one of those too, but that one's a little harder to find it.

25:55.940 --> 25:57.860
I drew the line at the week.

25:57.860 --> 25:58.860
Yeah.

25:58.860 --> 26:04.340
Anyway, uh, no DVR party, no DVR party or Mario.

26:04.340 --> 26:10.340
Uh, what was DVR with Mario or whatever it was, uh, SGA 100 Matt suggesting, uh, strap

26:10.340 --> 26:13.740
it directly onto your leg and not on workout pants or shorts.

26:13.740 --> 26:14.860
I do.

26:14.860 --> 26:18.140
And I was like double looping and trying to like, make sure it was like super tight, like

26:18.140 --> 26:20.380
cutting off and it was still would like slip off.

26:20.380 --> 26:21.380
I don't know.

26:21.380 --> 26:22.980
I don't know if I was just doing it wrong, whatever.

26:22.980 --> 26:25.500
I think I probably have to do it a little more like above the knee.

26:25.540 --> 26:32.060
So it kind of puts it in place, but I just, it didn't put it like on your calf or something.

26:32.060 --> 26:33.060
Yeah.

26:33.060 --> 26:34.380
That's how it measures you going up and down.

26:34.380 --> 26:35.380
Okay.

26:35.380 --> 26:36.380
Now that's kind of annoying.

26:36.380 --> 26:38.380
Maybe, maybe I won't play that.

26:38.380 --> 26:39.380
Try, try.

26:39.380 --> 26:41.980
I, I'm the only one that seems to be having problems with it.

26:41.980 --> 26:44.540
So, uh, I would say try it.

26:44.540 --> 26:45.540
Yeah.

26:45.540 --> 26:46.540
Okay.

26:46.540 --> 26:47.540
Well, all right.

26:47.540 --> 26:48.540
I'll find it somewhere.

26:48.540 --> 26:49.540
So, all right.

26:49.540 --> 26:50.540
Okay.

26:50.540 --> 26:51.540
Uh, let's move on.

26:51.540 --> 26:53.580
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

26:53.620 --> 26:55.340
Um, I didn't play a whole ton today.

26:55.340 --> 26:58.460
My kids got me to play a little bit of, uh, Minecraft.

26:58.460 --> 26:59.940
So I did play that.

26:59.940 --> 27:06.180
I was also fighting with Microsoft because they have me paying for my realm three times.

27:06.180 --> 27:10.980
And so they keep saying, Oh, your, your subscription's about to run out, which is weird because it,

27:10.980 --> 27:13.220
it's supposed to auto renew every month.

27:13.220 --> 27:17.100
And then, so I like, okay, fine, just, you know, renew.

27:17.100 --> 27:18.540
And then, so it starts a new one.

27:18.540 --> 27:23.460
So I found out that there was three going concurrently, which it's just, it's all messed

27:23.460 --> 27:24.460
up.

27:24.460 --> 27:28.180
So I finally got those canceled and hopefully they won't come back, but this is the second

27:28.180 --> 27:29.660
month I've had to do that.

27:29.660 --> 27:31.460
Um, so it's kind of annoying.

27:31.460 --> 27:34.660
Um, but we were able to play a little bit and so that was fun.

27:34.660 --> 27:38.460
And mostly this week, like I said, it's just been working on my game and stuff.

27:38.460 --> 27:42.100
So I'm still chugging along with that.

27:42.100 --> 27:52.020
Um, I also did power up the series X to try to, um, uh, try to acquire certain apps to

27:52.020 --> 27:54.060
play games.

27:54.060 --> 27:59.940
And apparently there's a lot more steps that I need to do that I, I can't do because, um,

27:59.940 --> 28:05.540
apparently Microsoft edge doesn't come preloaded on those systems anymore.

28:05.540 --> 28:10.980
Kind of weird, but, um, cause I thought that the Xbox had a web browser, but apparently

28:10.980 --> 28:15.100
it does on mine and I can't find it on mine.

28:15.100 --> 28:16.620
So go all the way down to the pins.

28:16.620 --> 28:17.620
Yeah.

28:17.620 --> 28:18.620
That's weird.

28:18.620 --> 28:19.620
Maybe I downloaded it in my apps.

28:19.620 --> 28:20.620
Yeah.

28:20.620 --> 28:21.620
It was down in the pins for me.

28:21.620 --> 28:22.920
But did you get it?

28:22.920 --> 28:26.900
Did you have it on Xbox one and now you have it?

28:26.900 --> 28:31.620
Cause like I did have it on Xbox one, but it didn't just copy things over from my Xbox

28:31.620 --> 28:32.620
one.

28:32.620 --> 28:35.460
Maybe my Xbox one has been disconnected from the network.

28:35.460 --> 28:36.460
Yeah.

28:36.460 --> 28:37.460
We'll get into it.

28:37.460 --> 28:38.460
We'll soon.

28:38.460 --> 28:40.620
We'll get into it soon, but to get retro arch on there.

28:40.620 --> 28:46.820
There is a way you can get to run on the retail one, the retail side, not in the dev mode,

28:46.820 --> 28:52.820
which we're going to talk about, but, um, it's a workaround that one of the developers

28:52.820 --> 28:53.820
has to there.

28:53.820 --> 28:57.800
They have to push something out and you have to download it through the browser is so they're

28:57.800 --> 29:00.740
trying to block it or Microsoft will be blocking it soon.

29:00.740 --> 29:03.980
So I'm trying to get past that before they do that.

29:03.980 --> 29:08.220
Uh, Bobby is saying you do have to download the app and YYR is suggesting I might've pinned

29:08.220 --> 29:09.460
it on Xbox one.

29:09.460 --> 29:13.660
Maybe I don't remember doing that, but I might've, um, because I do remember, um, you could

29:13.660 --> 29:16.980
listen to OLR, uh, before we were on Twitch.

29:16.980 --> 29:19.860
Cause I I'd mentioned at the top of the show, the whole shout cast thing, you could actually

29:19.860 --> 29:20.860
listen to it.

29:20.860 --> 29:24.780
I think on Xbox one's browser, uh, I don't remember if that was that vog network.com

29:24.780 --> 29:27.380
or if I had to use a different site to do it, but I remember doing that.

29:27.380 --> 29:31.940
So maybe I tried searching in the apps because they have a search function to pull up apps

29:31.940 --> 29:32.940
and stuff.

29:32.940 --> 29:36.960
And I searched Microsoft edge, edge, whatever, nothing came up web browser.

29:36.960 --> 29:41.560
So like, I, I can't access it, which I'm like, whatever at this point, it doesn't matter.

29:41.560 --> 29:44.240
But like, I just thought I'd try it.

29:44.240 --> 29:47.440
Maybe that's their weird workaround until they patched the issue is that you can't get

29:47.440 --> 29:49.640
it right now unless you already had it, but that would be strange.

29:49.640 --> 29:50.920
Maybe that'd be very strange.

29:50.920 --> 29:51.920
That's a weird theory.

29:51.920 --> 29:52.920
I know.

29:52.920 --> 29:53.920
But all right.

29:53.920 --> 29:54.920
Well, that's it for your gaming week.

29:54.920 --> 30:00.260
Loki then, uh, my gaming week, um, I've been, um, playing some of the similar things I've

30:00.260 --> 30:04.120
been talking about in past weeks, Final Fantasy 14, we get a patch on Tuesdays.

30:04.120 --> 30:05.600
That's really exciting to get some new content.

30:05.640 --> 30:06.640
I'm excited about that.

30:06.640 --> 30:07.640
New dungeon, new story.

30:07.640 --> 30:08.640
That'll be cool.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.800
Um, continuing to play Pokemon go.

30:10.800 --> 30:16.000
Uh, they have that event that just the, the Kalos region, uh, six generation of Pokemon

30:16.000 --> 30:21.400
X and Y, uh, those games just got their Pokemon and Pokemon got, well, some of actually only

30:21.400 --> 30:22.400
a handful.

30:22.400 --> 30:28.360
It's really the starters and a few other trashy mon, uh, and you know, that's about it that

30:28.360 --> 30:29.680
they have right now.

30:29.680 --> 30:33.200
And uh, for me, I'm finding it's very easy to find chess spin.

30:33.200 --> 30:36.000
Like I could probably pull up the game and there'd be two on my house right now.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
Um, excuse me, Fennekin.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.040
Uh, I, those they're around, they're not too bad to find.

30:43.040 --> 30:44.040
Froakie?

30:44.040 --> 30:45.040
Impossible.

30:45.040 --> 30:46.960
Um, I had to use the radar.

30:46.960 --> 30:52.640
I went downtown and would keep checking the phone to see if the radar showed the Froakie

30:52.640 --> 30:53.880
shadow.

30:53.880 --> 30:54.880
This was hilarious.

30:54.880 --> 30:57.320
It was at an apartment complex.

30:57.320 --> 31:03.360
I have to illegally park my car, jump out of the car, run over to where this fountain

31:03.360 --> 31:07.120
was where the Froakie spawn, I don't know if it spawned because it recognized a pokey

31:07.120 --> 31:11.860
stop called fountain or what, or if the pool there was enough water to cause the spawn.

31:11.860 --> 31:12.900
I don't know.

31:12.900 --> 31:17.560
But I get over there and there's fucking construction going on and it's all walled off.

31:17.560 --> 31:18.560
There is no fountain.

31:18.560 --> 31:19.860
It's just a bunch of construction.

31:19.860 --> 31:22.440
So the pokey stop really shouldn't be there anymore.

31:22.440 --> 31:26.320
But um, I, and I was like, I was, I was telling Shane, I was like on the phone with Shane

31:26.320 --> 31:29.360
or texting him, telling him this entire experience as it was unfolding.

31:29.360 --> 31:32.960
Um, and I was like, son of a bitch, there's fucking construction here.

31:32.960 --> 31:36.560
And I just illegally parked my car and then the Froakie isn't fucking showing up cause

31:36.560 --> 31:41.020
I was only able to see like the Eastern half of what was on the pokey stop.

31:41.020 --> 31:46.800
I had to basically walk through the pool area like I live there and deserve to be there.

31:46.800 --> 31:51.480
And that allowed me to get just enough to the West side that I got my Froakie.

31:51.480 --> 31:55.320
And then after I went through all that, what happens during the quest line, a quest pops

31:55.320 --> 31:58.600
up, catch a Froakie mother fucker.

31:58.600 --> 32:03.680
I just caught a Froakie and now I don't have the radar anymore to help me.

32:03.680 --> 32:06.200
So I had to go find a second Froakie.

32:06.200 --> 32:10.700
And what worked for me, I went to, um, if you know the Sacramento area, you might know

32:10.700 --> 32:11.700
the fish hatchery.

32:11.700 --> 32:15.340
Look, you've got to know this over at Hazel, right?

32:15.340 --> 32:16.960
So I was like, okay, water spawns.

32:16.960 --> 32:21.520
Well, I was going to go to old town sack on Saturday, but then I heard the protesters

32:21.520 --> 32:22.680
are at it again.

32:22.680 --> 32:24.440
So I didn't want to touch that.

32:24.440 --> 32:25.440
So I was like, where can I go?

32:25.440 --> 32:26.440
That's not downtown.

32:26.440 --> 32:29.440
So I was like, I'm going to go to the fish hatchery and I did, and it worked.

32:29.440 --> 32:30.440
There was a Froakie there.

32:30.440 --> 32:34.280
I had to walk all the way down the trail to the very last pokey stop, but there was a

32:34.280 --> 32:35.280
Froakie there.

32:35.280 --> 32:37.160
Uh, and so I was able to catch that for the quest.

32:37.160 --> 32:38.680
So that made me very happy.

32:38.680 --> 32:44.140
So, um, we're looking in chat for some of the comments as doing on her mat says I found

32:44.140 --> 32:45.520
one in the past few days.

32:45.520 --> 32:50.640
Oh, the interesting thing about finally catching that first Froakie, I get back in the car

32:50.640 --> 32:53.940
and there's another shadow on my radar.

32:53.940 --> 32:55.360
And I'm like, what's this?

32:55.360 --> 32:57.540
And apparently it was a noi bat.

32:57.540 --> 33:01.880
I might be saying that name wrong, but it's like the rarest of the new spawns.

33:01.880 --> 33:07.220
And it was just over by the, um, the, the lady Gaga mirror whole downtown.

33:07.220 --> 33:08.380
It's legit legit.

33:08.380 --> 33:10.820
There's like, there's like all these murals cause of the wide open walls.

33:10.820 --> 33:15.380
It's like a lady Gaga mural over by the Starbucks Starbucks, a golden one.

33:15.380 --> 33:16.540
So it was there.

33:16.540 --> 33:19.740
So fro, uh, the noi bat is a fan of lady Gaga apparently.

33:19.740 --> 33:24.580
So anyway, Bobby Black Wolf says I get back in my car and the tow truck shows up.

33:24.580 --> 33:30.060
Now, luckily I was, I was like, can I be in a white zone after six o'clock?

33:30.060 --> 33:31.980
And it, as it turns out, no, you cannot.

33:31.980 --> 33:36.340
I looked up the regulations later on, but I was like, I'll be back before the tow truck

33:36.340 --> 33:37.580
gets here.

33:37.580 --> 33:42.020
Um, so anyway, uh, that was, uh, my Pokemon go experience.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.940
Now that lended itself to actually playing the mainline Pokemon games.

33:45.940 --> 33:50.380
I talked a little bit about like playing Pokemon home and I've actually gotten into

33:50.380 --> 33:51.820
that a little bit more.

33:51.820 --> 33:58.100
Um, I loaded all of my Mon from sword and shield, uh, into the game from the Pokemon

33:58.100 --> 33:59.220
let's go Pikachu.

33:59.220 --> 34:00.220
I put them in there.

34:00.220 --> 34:06.220
So I have my pokey decks in home up to about 230 or something like that, which is a shamefully

34:06.220 --> 34:10.220
no low number when there's probably what, like 800, I think it's eight 98 altogether

34:10.220 --> 34:11.220
right now.

34:11.220 --> 34:12.780
Um, but it's a start for me.

34:12.780 --> 34:14.940
So that's going to allow me to go back into sword and shield.

34:14.940 --> 34:19.500
I've, I've actually been playing a shield and I caught maybe like 12 more things from

34:19.500 --> 34:21.100
my decks the other day.

34:21.100 --> 34:27.180
So it's been a slow process admittedly, but I just got obsessed with sorting my Pokemon

34:27.180 --> 34:29.180
and organizing my Pokemon.

34:29.180 --> 34:31.060
I made another spreadsheet.

34:31.060 --> 34:32.640
Well, I take that back.

34:32.640 --> 34:37.580
I stole what Shane was doing and I made a spreadsheet that worked for me from what he

34:37.580 --> 34:38.580
started.

34:38.580 --> 34:41.420
And, uh, and all of that to track all of my Pokemon in home.

34:41.420 --> 34:42.820
So that was, that was kind of fun.

34:42.820 --> 34:44.620
Um, so that was that.

34:44.620 --> 34:51.820
The other big thing for my gaming week on Xbox game pass, uh, dragon quest 11, the echoes

34:51.820 --> 34:55.420
of an elusive age, the definitive edition came out on Xbox.

34:55.420 --> 34:58.660
It's the first time that the dragon quest game is out on an Xbox platform.

34:58.660 --> 35:00.860
I didn't really realize that, but that is true.

35:00.860 --> 35:06.160
Um, and this also came out, I believe on the PlayStation four, and these are versions of

35:06.160 --> 35:08.300
a switch title that came out previously.

35:08.300 --> 35:11.100
So the definitive edition was first out on the switch.

35:11.100 --> 35:16.900
Um, and of course the game itself was out in what I think 2017 on the PlayStation four.

35:16.900 --> 35:22.820
And if you're, if you were in Japan, the 3DS, um, so I played it a little bit on the PlayStation

35:22.820 --> 35:25.540
four, but the game is very long and I didn't get far enough.

35:25.540 --> 35:30.340
I got maybe 12 hours into it the first time and I've put in about the same amount of time

35:30.340 --> 35:34.060
now on the Xbox version over the weekend, since, you know, there's nothing else to do

35:34.060 --> 35:36.380
in the world right now, I am staying at home.

35:36.380 --> 35:37.380
Thank you very much.

35:37.380 --> 35:40.660
And so I'm playing, well, besides my walks, that's all I really do.

35:40.660 --> 35:46.220
Um, and then, uh, I, I play dragon quest 11, so I'm, I'm back up almost to where I was

35:46.220 --> 35:48.380
the first time I was through the game.

35:48.380 --> 35:50.980
Um, I, I, I like it.

35:50.980 --> 35:53.500
I think it's a great JRPG experience.

35:53.500 --> 35:59.300
Um, some of my criticisms, the first time I played the game, I criticized the soundtrack

35:59.300 --> 36:00.300
for the game.

36:00.300 --> 36:03.700
Uh, they actually did change the soundtrack a little bit.

36:03.700 --> 36:09.020
Um, they, instead of having the midi synthesized versions, which I don't know why they thought

36:09.020 --> 36:10.180
that was a good decision.

36:10.180 --> 36:14.340
I think they thought it would make, there's been a lot of strange decisions in dragon

36:14.340 --> 36:20.340
quest 11, where they wanted to throw back to the original or be respectful to the original.

36:20.340 --> 36:23.500
And um, that's cute, but it doesn't really work.

36:23.500 --> 36:28.820
Like in the year 2017 or 2020, um, I like that it's an option.

36:28.820 --> 36:33.160
Uh, you can do that, but you can go back to the synth stuff if you want, but now they

36:33.160 --> 36:37.480
have some orchestrated versions that they do sound a whole lot better, but that leads

36:37.480 --> 36:40.960
me to the other big problem with this game.

36:40.960 --> 36:44.520
And that is that the soundtrack just isn't good.

36:44.520 --> 36:48.360
Like the soundtrack's not good.

36:48.360 --> 36:52.120
Um, and I know that's, that's weird to say about a game like dragon quest, cause you

36:52.120 --> 36:56.920
think of like, Oh my God, the dragon quest has like iconic themes and iconic music.

36:56.920 --> 36:57.920
Yeah.

36:57.920 --> 37:02.400
That were written for the first dragon quest game, like 30 years ago.

37:02.400 --> 37:07.520
It's now the 2010s, the 2020s even, because I say tens cause the game originally came

37:07.520 --> 37:11.800
out in 2017, but, but we, we are way past that now.

37:11.800 --> 37:18.160
And um, here's the thing, the composer, um, he's gotta be pushing what he's like 89 years

37:18.160 --> 37:19.160
old now, I think.

37:19.160 --> 37:22.160
So he was making a lot of this soundtrack when he was in his eighties.

37:22.160 --> 37:23.700
And I don't want to be ageist or nothing.

37:23.700 --> 37:28.320
Like I think it's great that he's still continuing to work in whatever and work on the games.

37:28.360 --> 37:32.720
Um, even though he's had some weird stuff personally, but I'm really trying to just

37:32.720 --> 37:35.360
like overlook that and, and look, focus on the game.

37:35.360 --> 37:39.720
Um, and the reality is like, I don't know if they feel some type of onus to the guy

37:39.720 --> 37:44.880
to like, let him continue to be the sole person that works on the series or if he has some

37:44.880 --> 37:51.320
type of weird creative control over it, but, um, yo square, it's holding you back.

37:51.320 --> 37:56.400
Like we're at the point where the soundtrack is holding the game back.

37:56.440 --> 38:01.440
Um, so I really hope for Dragon Quest 12, you're thinking about mixing it up because

38:01.440 --> 38:08.160
I'm telling you guys, the battle theme, the world theme, they get really old and really

38:08.160 --> 38:14.640
stale because they are the only things you're hearing over and over and over and then recycled

38:14.640 --> 38:16.660
town themes over and over.

38:16.660 --> 38:22.280
So my fear is that the guy was only contracted to do so much work that does not fill out

38:22.280 --> 38:24.200
a hundred hour game appropriately.

38:24.200 --> 38:29.080
Um, sometimes you need to ask for help and I think the series needs help as it goes into

38:29.080 --> 38:30.320
Dragon Quest 12.

38:30.320 --> 38:34.080
Let the guy do the main theme and one or two other songs and let someone else come in and

38:34.080 --> 38:35.740
fill out the rest of the soundtrack.

38:35.740 --> 38:38.740
You know, look at what's happening with the Final Fantasy series.

38:38.740 --> 38:42.800
You know, Nobuo Imatsu, I don't, I don't have a negative thing in my heart to say about

38:42.800 --> 38:45.620
Nobuo Imatsu and he's done some great things, great music.

38:45.620 --> 38:49.320
He stepped away from a lot of the music making for health reasons some time ago.

38:49.320 --> 38:53.240
He still contributes tracks here and there, but for the most part, recent Final Fantasy

38:53.280 --> 38:56.880
games, namely 14, have been filled out by other people.

38:56.880 --> 39:02.820
And let me tell you, Soken and what he does for Final Fantasy 14 is phenomenal and he's

39:02.820 --> 39:06.980
absolutely worthy of creating the music for the Final Fantasy series.

39:06.980 --> 39:12.400
It doesn't lessen the value of what Uematsu has done or better or worse or anything like

39:12.400 --> 39:13.400
that.

39:13.400 --> 39:18.320
It's something that is able to exist and represent the brand still very well alongside what Uematsu

39:18.320 --> 39:19.320
did.

39:19.320 --> 39:20.800
Let someone do that for Dragon Quest.

39:20.800 --> 39:22.680
It's time.

39:22.680 --> 39:27.420
So I know I'm like going off on the soundtrack, but you guys, seriously, and I'm curious,

39:27.420 --> 39:31.560
I haven't, I haven't really been reading the chat, sorry, I'm going to go back and read

39:31.560 --> 39:38.520
some comments here in a minute, but like play the game yourself and tell me that like every

39:38.520 --> 39:46.300
other facet of this JRPG is a superior JRPG, but then you find that there's this one element

39:46.300 --> 39:51.260
that's like something just grates on me about this game and I don't know what it is.

39:51.260 --> 39:54.020
And then you realize, oh, the music, it sucks.

39:54.020 --> 39:58.940
I would, I would honestly rather listen to, to, to WAP as the background music and it

39:58.940 --> 40:01.020
would be less repetitive.

40:01.020 --> 40:03.460
That'd be funny.

40:03.460 --> 40:09.420
I would honestly, so now the definitive version will allow you to mix in the Dragon Quest

40:09.420 --> 40:13.660
8 soundtrack so you can actually play that in the overworld.

40:13.660 --> 40:19.460
That says to me, Square knows it was getting thin and like you have to supplement it with

40:19.460 --> 40:20.460
old music.

40:20.660 --> 40:22.740
Hello, it's a problem.

40:22.740 --> 40:26.820
Bobby Black Wolf says in chat, I'm an hour and a half in and I already am tired of the

40:26.820 --> 40:27.820
battle music.

40:27.820 --> 40:28.820
It doesn't change.

40:28.820 --> 40:33.060
No, there's no boss music either that I've run into yet.

40:33.060 --> 40:36.800
Quest Buster says, the thing is the Dragon Quest series is all about being traditional.

40:36.800 --> 40:41.180
The fact that people love the series enough to make a DQ11 still as a hit, despite relying

40:41.180 --> 40:43.700
on decades old tropes is a testament to that.

40:43.700 --> 40:46.980
When you buy a Dragon Quest game, you have to kind of expect that.

40:46.980 --> 40:50.860
Not saying the series can't grow, but right now that's pretty much the expectations of

40:50.860 --> 40:53.660
what Dragon Quest is.

40:53.660 --> 41:02.080
In my opinion, and the remake kind of shows this, you can have all that exist alongside

41:02.080 --> 41:07.260
something modern because like, you know, you have the retro mode in this game, which is

41:07.260 --> 41:12.420
basically the 3DS 2D portion that is something you can play standalone.

41:12.420 --> 41:14.300
I thought I would be super into it.

41:14.300 --> 41:16.460
I don't like it.

41:16.460 --> 41:19.820
It's missing stuff that the 3D version has, and I didn't like that.

41:19.820 --> 41:23.100
I didn't like that there wasn't any voice acting whatsoever.

41:23.100 --> 41:27.500
It was, it was, so it's there if you want it, and I found that I didn't really want

41:27.500 --> 41:28.500
it.

41:28.500 --> 41:32.020
So I, and I think something has to be done with the music as well.

41:32.020 --> 41:34.740
So anyway.

41:34.740 --> 41:35.740
Let's see.

41:35.740 --> 41:40.620
SSJ100Matt says, kind of makes you want to mute the music and find some OC remixes that

41:40.620 --> 41:42.700
are made by fans who care.

41:42.700 --> 41:45.100
Oh, yup.

41:45.100 --> 41:46.100
Let's see.

41:46.100 --> 41:47.100
Other comments here.

41:47.100 --> 41:51.620
SSJ100Matt says, I feel like this was an issue last game.

41:51.620 --> 41:55.220
Well, we never even got 10 here, which is a whole nother issue.

41:55.220 --> 42:00.860
But yes, I believe nine was criticized for some similar things as well.

42:00.860 --> 42:01.860
And then let's see.

42:01.860 --> 42:06.860
YYR in chat says, I think the MIDI soundtrack was because the jerk music director insists

42:06.860 --> 42:07.860
on it.

42:07.860 --> 42:11.380
He's always done the music and it's always been MIDI across the initial releases.

42:11.380 --> 42:13.940
Also, he is actually a jerk.

42:13.940 --> 42:15.580
I have heard a lot of that as well.

42:15.580 --> 42:18.780
And again, I'm really trying to separate that from my criticisms.

42:18.780 --> 42:23.980
But all I'm saying is that those types of decisions that they feel beholden to some

42:23.980 --> 42:29.980
sort of traditionalism, when they've allowed Final Fantasy to progress for better, 14 or

42:29.980 --> 42:39.900
worse, 15, I don't understand why they feel they must hold it down to a certain standard.

42:39.900 --> 42:43.260
Have that version of the game coexist alongside a modern version.

42:43.260 --> 42:49.620
There's a lot of things about Dragon Quest XI that are very classic that I like.

42:49.620 --> 42:54.220
The fact that it is relatively still a turn-based battle game, that they don't try to do a lot

42:54.220 --> 42:58.980
of fancy active time battle stuff where you have to pull the trigger at a certain time

42:58.980 --> 43:02.900
or do these, you know, push the directions.

43:02.900 --> 43:06.220
You can even walk around the battlefield, but you don't really have to.

43:06.220 --> 43:08.900
It doesn't really do anything.

43:08.900 --> 43:09.900
I don't mind that.

43:09.900 --> 43:15.300
Like that sort of traditional JRPG in that sense, I think a lot of people miss those

43:15.300 --> 43:16.300
actually.

43:16.300 --> 43:19.460
So none of that bothers me.

43:19.460 --> 43:22.400
And the traditional sense of that, that's what I really like about the game.

43:22.400 --> 43:25.700
So anyway, even though I sound like I'm very negative because I can't shut up about the

43:25.700 --> 43:27.780
soundtrack, I do really enjoy Dragon Quest XI.

43:27.780 --> 43:29.180
I really like the story.

43:29.180 --> 43:33.300
I like some of the voice acting and some of the character development that goes with it

43:33.300 --> 43:35.020
is fine.

43:35.020 --> 43:38.140
The voice acting can be a little bit over the top, but I like what they do with some

43:38.140 --> 43:39.140
of the characters.

43:39.180 --> 43:42.120
Really funny, witty things.

43:42.120 --> 43:43.980
There's this thing involving haikus.

43:43.980 --> 43:47.780
I don't want to spoil it, but I found it, I'm like, this must have been the biggest

43:47.780 --> 43:50.580
pain in the ass for the localization team.

43:50.580 --> 43:52.660
And I thought it was very clever.

43:52.660 --> 43:57.080
So there's a lot to love about the Dragon Quest XI remake.

43:57.080 --> 43:59.680
And if you have Game Pass, download it, check it out.

43:59.680 --> 44:01.660
Just have your Spotify ready to go.

44:01.660 --> 44:03.380
All right.

44:03.380 --> 44:04.380
That's my gaming week.

44:04.380 --> 44:05.380
Phew.

44:05.380 --> 44:06.380
All right.

44:06.580 --> 44:11.100
By the way, before we get into tonight's gaming news, I will point out, if you would like

44:11.100 --> 44:14.220
to have, for those of you that are watching live on Twitch, you might notice I'm wearing

44:14.220 --> 44:20.340
a lovely blue VOG shirt with Jamie's VOG logo on the corner there.

44:20.340 --> 44:23.780
If you would like to get a shirt, you can check it out over at the VOG Network shop,

44:23.780 --> 44:25.780
vognetwork.com slash shop.

44:25.780 --> 44:30.940
And we just recently added Loki's OLR pixel design.

44:30.940 --> 44:34.860
We got a new shirt that's kind of like a baseball shirt with that on it.

44:34.860 --> 44:37.780
So I'm curious to see how that turns out because you just bought one of those, right,

44:37.780 --> 44:38.780
Loki?

44:38.780 --> 44:39.780
I did.

44:39.780 --> 44:40.780
I did last week.

44:40.780 --> 44:41.780
Yeah.

44:41.780 --> 44:42.780
Yeah.

44:42.780 --> 44:43.780
So anyway, check that out.

44:43.780 --> 44:44.780
Vognetwork.com slash shop.

44:44.780 --> 44:45.940
Anyway, let's get into some gaming news.

44:45.940 --> 44:49.060
Loki, you were kind of referring to this earlier, right?

44:49.060 --> 44:50.060
Yes.

44:50.060 --> 45:00.780
So of course, being that the Xbox One and even now the Xbox Series X and Series S had

45:00.780 --> 45:04.220
a universal window, a UWP app.

45:04.220 --> 45:08.260
So basically these different apps that you could download and run.

45:08.260 --> 45:15.820
So it could be anything from applications like Twitch or even like web browsers and

45:15.820 --> 45:17.580
other stuff like that.

45:17.580 --> 45:22.420
You can download different things onto the system.

45:22.420 --> 45:27.300
You may have also forgotten that starting with the Xbox One, you could also turn your

45:27.300 --> 45:30.060
console into a development platform.

45:30.060 --> 45:34.860
So there's a way to actually put it in dev mode and be able to download things to this

45:34.860 --> 45:37.140
and also develop games on it.

45:37.140 --> 45:43.420
Well, one of the things that you can download is RetroArch and RetroArch, of course, being

45:43.420 --> 45:48.260
a emulator platform for lots of different consoles.

45:48.260 --> 45:54.180
And at the very least in dev mode, you can actually emulate quite a few games in this.

45:54.180 --> 45:59.420
In fact, it even emulates PlayStation 2 titles a little bit.

45:59.460 --> 46:08.380
There's some bugs there because the kernel is still a bit early, but it does emulate

46:08.380 --> 46:12.860
stuff really well on many of the other platforms.

46:12.860 --> 46:19.460
They also even have a dedicated PlayStation Portable emulator as well outside of RetroArch

46:19.460 --> 46:21.260
that you can put on there.

46:21.260 --> 46:24.340
Can I get OLRPSP.com on it?

46:24.340 --> 46:25.980
I don't think that website's actually up anymore.

46:25.980 --> 46:26.980
It's long gone.

46:26.980 --> 46:27.980
Sorry.

46:27.980 --> 46:28.980
I don't think so.

46:29.020 --> 46:36.020
If you go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com slash PSP, I think it's still there.

46:36.020 --> 46:37.060
I never got rid of it.

46:37.060 --> 46:39.540
Our site hasn't changed in like 20 years.

46:39.540 --> 46:40.540
So I...

46:40.540 --> 46:41.540
Yes, it is still there.

46:41.540 --> 46:43.260
So yeah, if you want to see, it's still there.

46:43.260 --> 46:45.380
So it's just not, it doesn't have its own dedicated domain anymore.

46:45.380 --> 46:46.380
That's all.

46:46.380 --> 46:47.380
Yeah.

46:47.380 --> 46:51.100
I don't think it's, uh, it's necessarily, yeah, it hasn't been updated.

46:51.100 --> 46:53.900
Well, it still has the feeds in there because it takes our...

46:53.900 --> 46:56.100
Yeah, it probably still pulls the RSS.

46:56.100 --> 46:58.900
So it probably in that aspect is still up to date.

46:59.420 --> 47:00.420
It's still up to date.

47:00.420 --> 47:01.420
Yeah.

47:01.420 --> 47:02.420
So you can do all that.

47:02.420 --> 47:08.340
Um, yeah, I don't think it has the links to the, uh, radio app anymore.

47:08.340 --> 47:12.980
We used to have like, I think you can download and you can like get a theme and stuff too.

47:12.980 --> 47:14.820
The theme you did was pretty cool.

47:14.820 --> 47:15.820
Yeah.

47:15.820 --> 47:21.020
So, um, yeah, so that does still exist, but yeah, unfortunately, yeah, you can't access

47:21.020 --> 47:25.740
the site through there anymore, but you can play, uh, emulator games now granted in order

47:25.740 --> 47:30.340
to do that, you have to switch between retail and dev mode in order to kind of jump between

47:30.340 --> 47:31.340
the two.

47:31.340 --> 47:39.940
There is a workaround to put it, uh, RetroArch in, um, the actual, uh, retail mode, but it's

47:39.940 --> 47:42.300
a little trickier to do that.

47:42.300 --> 47:46.780
You actually had to, there's a, a form that you filled out that I guess one of the developers

47:46.780 --> 47:52.640
has and he basically whitelists your console for that download and you download it through

47:52.640 --> 47:58.560
Edge on the console and you kind of bypass their storefront to get it on there, which

47:58.560 --> 48:01.320
I'm certain is going to be patched out soon.

48:01.320 --> 48:04.760
So, um, that's just how that works right now.

48:04.760 --> 48:11.040
But the dev mode version doesn't necessarily, um, isn't blocked.

48:11.040 --> 48:16.440
Still do that, um, right now, and I'm not sure I, there is a little bit of, you know,

48:16.440 --> 48:20.040
I think you have to switch back and forth between retail and dev if you want to play

48:20.040 --> 48:25.920
your games, like your actual retail games and stuff, but not everyone can just jump

48:25.920 --> 48:26.920
into dev.

48:26.920 --> 48:27.920
Right.

48:27.920 --> 48:29.480
You have to have some sort of license to do that.

48:29.480 --> 48:30.480
Right.

48:30.480 --> 48:31.520
Cause that was my understanding.

48:31.520 --> 48:35.760
Cause there's a lot of paid for license, but it's, I think it's pretty inexpensive though.

48:35.760 --> 48:39.800
There's a lot of headlines about this story right now that, you know, for clickbait reasons

48:39.800 --> 48:44.080
are making it sound like you can play PlayStation two games on your Xbox.

48:44.080 --> 48:46.760
And the reality is it's not really that easy.

48:46.760 --> 48:52.280
It just kind of sounds like, okay, the Xbox series X is basically, as we know, you know,

48:52.280 --> 48:57.000
a type of PC it's a, it's an optimized PC for gaming, right?

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
It's that kind of thing.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
Right.

48:59.000 --> 49:03.400
Um, so it makes sense that certain things that were built to run on PCs like emulators

49:03.400 --> 49:08.240
and yes, PlayStation two emulators exist on, on PC, you know what, PS three and four emulators

49:08.240 --> 49:09.860
exist on PC as well.

49:09.860 --> 49:13.120
Probably soon a PS five emulator just won't run very fast.

49:13.120 --> 49:15.880
Um, somebody's probably already trying to develop one.

49:15.880 --> 49:17.420
So all that stuff exists.

49:17.420 --> 49:22.000
And I think it's just that, you know, by using this essentially what sounds like a sideloading

49:22.000 --> 49:24.240
method is basically what it is, right?

49:24.240 --> 49:29.680
You are able to run this emulator and then run the PlayStation games.

49:29.680 --> 49:33.200
And I think people are kind of using this to take a cheap shot at Sony.

49:33.200 --> 49:34.940
Well, I shouldn't say a cheap shot.

49:34.940 --> 49:40.800
I think it's a worthy shot at Sony about how they drag their feet through the mud about

49:40.800 --> 49:45.600
backwards compatibility when it comes to PlayStation, PlayStation two and PlayStation three, because

49:45.600 --> 49:47.480
it does make an attention grabbing headline.

49:47.480 --> 49:52.620
That's like, Hey, Xbox series X can play PlayStation two games, even though it's a lot more nuanced

49:52.620 --> 49:53.620
than that headline.

49:53.620 --> 49:57.760
That's my point is that it still needles Sony like, so what's your problem?

49:57.760 --> 49:58.760
Exactly.

49:58.760 --> 50:03.440
And the dev mode isn't necessarily so to, to get the dev mode, you have to pay a one

50:03.440 --> 50:04.440
time $19 fee.

50:04.440 --> 50:07.760
Um, so that's why, why are echoing some of this in chat?

50:07.760 --> 50:11.880
Cause he's developed for, let's not forget some of his games were released on what used

50:11.880 --> 50:18.200
to be like the XNA and the, the indie arcade and that, that stuff on the 360.

50:18.200 --> 50:23.960
So if there's lots of guides online to, to be able to do that, um, you know, I haven't

50:23.960 --> 50:27.720
necessarily mess with it enough yet to, um, check it out.

50:27.720 --> 50:28.720
It would be nice.

50:28.720 --> 50:32.080
It's kind of a nice added bonus, you know, having this console and stuff, being able

50:32.080 --> 50:34.960
to play, um, other games on it.

50:34.960 --> 50:36.840
I mean like, sure.

50:36.840 --> 50:41.700
It's not like officially sanctioned by Microsoft or something, but it's still a pretty cool

50:41.700 --> 50:42.720
thing to be able to do.

50:42.720 --> 50:45.500
And like what other cool stuff could you do with this console?

50:45.500 --> 50:49.780
I mean, I like that, but I get it.

50:49.780 --> 50:53.140
That's if they shut it down, then they shut it down.

50:53.140 --> 50:57.660
But right now it seems to be like, they're kind of not really addressing it yet, but

50:57.660 --> 51:03.180
if it becomes a problem, maybe if like, you know, Sony or Nintendo complaints, I'm kind

51:03.180 --> 51:08.540
of surprised somebody hasn't unleashed the beast with NES games and, and super new Tony

51:08.540 --> 51:12.220
is, but at the same time, it does retro arch plays all that.

51:12.220 --> 51:13.220
Okay.

51:13.220 --> 51:14.220
So, so then, okay.

51:14.220 --> 51:19.380
So then the headlines we're seeing about PlayStation two really is to needle Sony because they

51:19.380 --> 51:21.380
they're leaving the NES stuff out of it.

51:21.380 --> 51:23.340
Well, the PlayStation two let's play this way.

51:23.340 --> 51:26.500
The reason why they're, they're highlighting the PlayStation two, because that's a hard

51:26.500 --> 51:27.860
to emulate system.

51:27.860 --> 51:32.020
It is, it requires that whole emotion engine, powerful, you know?

51:32.020 --> 51:35.620
So it'll, it actually emulates GameCube very well.

51:35.620 --> 51:38.860
So you could actually run you know, GameCube games on there.

51:38.860 --> 51:44.060
You could run and you have zero GX or something like that, you know, lots of cool stuff.

51:44.060 --> 51:51.220
So it, yeah, they're highlighting the PlayStation two because it starts, it can run some of

51:51.220 --> 51:52.220
the games.

51:52.220 --> 51:57.060
They're not perfect yet because that core is still very new, but that's the thing about

51:57.060 --> 52:02.660
retro arch is unlike, you know, other emulators out there, this is kind of an all in one.

52:02.700 --> 52:05.740
So you get different cores that emulate different systems.

52:05.740 --> 52:07.740
And so it can do it all.

52:07.740 --> 52:11.480
And each of those cores is kind of independently developed.

52:11.480 --> 52:15.180
And so they're adding support for PlayStation two on there.

52:15.180 --> 52:18.980
And I got you because I was going to say that, you know, when it comes to emulating something

52:18.980 --> 52:24.060
like the NES or the Atari 2600, you could pull up a Microsoft edge browser and open

52:24.060 --> 52:27.140
up a tab and run like a web browser based emulator.

52:27.140 --> 52:31.260
That's going to be decent enough, decent enough where most people aren't going to be able

52:31.260 --> 52:32.260
to tell the difference.

52:32.260 --> 52:33.260
Right.

52:33.260 --> 52:34.380
So maybe.

52:34.380 --> 52:36.420
And so that does kind of lend itself to your point.

52:36.420 --> 52:40.000
It's the fact that it's the PlayStation two, which is a lot harder to emulate than these

52:40.000 --> 52:41.180
other things.

52:41.180 --> 52:45.260
And the fact that it's happening on a Microsoft box, no matter the, you know, sideloading

52:45.260 --> 52:50.860
dev mode and all that stuff aside when it's not like when Sony keeps resisting doing their

52:50.860 --> 52:55.260
own native emulation on their own box, this is interesting.

52:55.260 --> 52:56.260
So, yeah.

52:56.260 --> 52:57.260
All right.

52:57.260 --> 53:00.780
Well, I'd be curious to see if that's something you decide you're going to check out and get

53:00.780 --> 53:02.580
into this week.

53:02.580 --> 53:07.180
So what PlayStation two game are you looking forward to playing on Xbox?

53:07.180 --> 53:08.180
None of them.

53:08.180 --> 53:09.180
I'll be honest.

53:09.180 --> 53:16.340
The PlayStation two, like if I was going to pick any of those, I mean, like mania 2d x

53:16.340 --> 53:17.780
beat mania 2d x.

53:17.780 --> 53:18.780
Oh yeah.

53:18.780 --> 53:19.780
With the controller.

53:19.780 --> 53:20.780
That'd be just perfect.

53:20.780 --> 53:22.580
Couldn't I like map it somehow?

53:22.580 --> 53:23.580
I don't know.

53:23.580 --> 53:24.580
Yeah, maybe.

53:24.580 --> 53:29.980
I mean, um, and I mean, I don't remember if those controllers I used to play, you could

53:29.980 --> 53:31.620
play like five key with the controller.

53:31.620 --> 53:33.700
You can play a DJ max as a controller game.

53:33.700 --> 53:34.700
Yeah, you could do it.

53:34.700 --> 53:35.700
Yeah.

53:35.700 --> 53:36.700
Where are they?

53:36.700 --> 53:43.660
Like, do they have like, um, weren't the PlayStation two, um, beat me a controller's USB or they,

53:43.660 --> 53:46.500
um, place just the regular PlayStation two stuff.

53:46.500 --> 53:47.940
They were regular PlayStation two.

53:47.940 --> 53:52.420
If I recall correctly, you can probably get some type of USB device, but it would be like,

53:52.420 --> 53:55.100
I'm going to say there's probably an adapter out there for it.

53:55.100 --> 53:56.100
Yeah.

53:56.100 --> 53:57.700
I wouldn't be surprised at all if that was the case.

53:57.700 --> 53:58.700
So yeah.

53:58.700 --> 53:59.700
All right.

53:59.700 --> 54:04.020
Um, and, uh, YYR says you don't want to play two DX on a game pad.

54:04.020 --> 54:05.980
It's just not two DX anymore.

54:05.980 --> 54:10.500
You know, I thought I would dislike DJ max for kind of reasons like that, but it's okay.

54:10.500 --> 54:11.780
Like I don't mind DJ max.

54:11.780 --> 54:16.620
So all right, well, let's move on to a story about destiny two.

54:16.620 --> 54:22.380
And um, this kind of has to do with how these games are upgrading to the next generation.

54:23.340 --> 54:30.660
Destiny two right now, uh, in the X-Box universe is not series X and S enhanced.

54:30.660 --> 54:33.420
This is important because the game is available on game pass.

54:33.420 --> 54:37.620
So if you have an X-Box series X or S you may have downloaded the game to just kind

54:37.620 --> 54:41.180
of, I almost did until I saw this story and I was like, wait, hold on.

54:41.180 --> 54:45.420
Um, and the long and the short of it is, is that there is a new version of destiny two

54:45.420 --> 54:50.860
coming out for not just X-Box X and S, uh, this week on December the eighth, but it's

54:50.860 --> 54:53.780
also coming for PlayStation five as well.

54:53.780 --> 54:59.000
And here's the thing, if you downloaded the old version of the game, too bad, you're going

54:59.000 --> 55:02.060
to have to download the new version of the game.

55:02.060 --> 55:05.540
Now there's a lot of that that kind of makes sense, you know, cause you got to get new

55:05.540 --> 55:10.460
assets and things of that nature, but it is this very interesting sort of like, Oh, we

55:10.460 --> 55:14.620
kind of thought with, with X-Box, you just could kind of like play the old games and

55:14.620 --> 55:16.460
they just kind of run with the new stuff.

55:16.460 --> 55:18.480
And to some extent that does work.

55:18.480 --> 55:24.280
Like again, I've been playing dragon quest 11, which it's very much like a PlayStation

55:24.280 --> 55:31.760
four or last gen era game, but it's so smooth, like 60 frames a second smooth.

55:31.760 --> 55:36.200
The loading time is, I can't believe I'm gonna say this, the loading time in dragon quest

55:36.200 --> 55:39.120
11 is too fast.

55:39.120 --> 55:40.120
It's too fast.

55:40.120 --> 55:44.060
And the reason why I say that is what they did in the original version was they had tips

55:44.060 --> 55:45.760
on the loading screen.

55:45.760 --> 55:48.900
And while the area was loading, you could read the tips.

55:48.900 --> 55:51.500
You don't have time to read the tips anymore.

55:51.500 --> 55:55.060
You can kind of see it, but it's too damn fast on the X-Box.

55:55.060 --> 55:58.500
So this is kind of, kind of interesting in that regard anyway.

55:58.500 --> 56:04.040
So for destiny to the next gen update on December 8th, which is technically the version 3.0.1

56:04.040 --> 56:09.640
update, you will have to download the game again on the X-Box series X or S and the PlayStation

56:09.640 --> 56:10.640
five.

56:10.640 --> 56:11.640
Why is this important?

56:11.640 --> 56:14.000
Well, some of you might have bandwidth concerns, right?

56:14.000 --> 56:18.460
I don't know how many of y'all got a new system last month and already almost hit your bandwidth

56:18.460 --> 56:19.680
cap for the month.

56:19.680 --> 56:23.060
So you might be rationing things out a little bit, which is why I'm glad I didn't get destiny

56:23.060 --> 56:25.120
two yet.

56:25.120 --> 56:29.680
This download will be about 70 gigs in the X-Box side of things, PlayStation side of

56:29.680 --> 56:32.720
things will be about 67 gigs.

56:32.720 --> 56:37.160
This is interesting because Bobby was kind of talking about on his show this week, the

56:37.160 --> 56:43.400
weird PlayStation four and PlayStation five stuff coexisting.

56:43.400 --> 56:45.460
And sometimes it doesn't make sense.

56:45.460 --> 56:50.780
Like let's say you put in your disc for no man's sky because you want to play the PlayStation

56:50.780 --> 56:52.720
five version of no man's sky.

56:52.720 --> 56:55.280
And that's how it verifies that you own the game still is by the disc.

56:55.280 --> 56:59.420
Well, guess what, when you put in the disc, it defaults to the PlayStation four version

56:59.420 --> 57:00.420
of no man's sky.

57:00.420 --> 57:02.720
So you have to switch it.

57:02.720 --> 57:05.360
Why you would want to default to that version?

57:05.360 --> 57:06.840
Maybe because the HDR bug's still there.

57:06.840 --> 57:07.840
I don't know.

57:07.840 --> 57:10.160
It still happens.

57:10.160 --> 57:14.720
And apparently he was talking about, he downloaded worms, which is the, uh, whatever version

57:14.720 --> 57:17.600
of it is the PlayStation plus game of the month right now.

57:17.600 --> 57:22.720
And it downloads both the PlayStation four and the PlayStation five version.

57:22.720 --> 57:25.320
I think it was, and he'll correct me in chat if I'm wrong.

57:25.320 --> 57:29.640
I think it was, he had to download the PlayStation four version first, then get the PlayStation

57:29.640 --> 57:30.640
five version.

57:30.640 --> 57:34.840
And it was like, okay, well, are these art assets for no, it doesn't, it's not pulling

57:34.840 --> 57:37.720
anything from the PlayStation four version.

57:37.720 --> 57:42.600
And in my opinion, well thought out, no, it's horribly thought out, which I know you're

57:42.600 --> 57:45.720
joking, but it's, it's borderline.

57:45.720 --> 57:51.800
I don't want to be too dramatic, but it's borderline disrespectful in this area, in

57:51.800 --> 57:58.340
this era, excuse me, of bandwidth caps, the destiny to thing, whatever we were warned,

57:58.340 --> 57:59.520
we were cautioned.

57:59.520 --> 58:02.040
They did say the next gen version is coming.

58:02.040 --> 58:03.040
Okay.

58:03.040 --> 58:04.040
So I'm letting that slide.

58:04.040 --> 58:07.460
I'm just warning you, you know, wait until the eighth before you grab it.

58:07.460 --> 58:12.860
But in the case of this worms thing, when we live in this era of bandwidth caps, it's

58:12.860 --> 58:16.420
disrespectful for the systems to be doing this.

58:16.420 --> 58:19.280
It's not respecting the bandwidth caps that we have.

58:19.280 --> 58:23.920
This needs to be addressed immediately on Sony's end.

58:23.920 --> 58:29.200
And if anything like this is happening on Microsoft's end, I don't think it is to that

58:29.200 --> 58:30.200
same extent.

58:30.200 --> 58:36.340
Like I know with no man's sky, it's not, it's you, you just, you, you get the Xbox X and

58:36.340 --> 58:40.180
S version because that is the box you're playing it on.

58:40.180 --> 58:44.380
Anyway, I want to go to our chat room and see if we have any feedback on this particular

58:44.380 --> 58:46.300
story here.

58:46.300 --> 58:49.460
Bobby says it downloaded the PlayStation 4 version first.

58:49.460 --> 58:50.740
I canceled it.

58:50.740 --> 58:55.100
It added both to my queue and prioritize the PlayStation 4 download.

58:55.100 --> 59:00.260
Dejirama S says Sony has always had shitty servers and network management.

59:00.260 --> 59:04.100
Fifth Dream says I'm used to like getting a drink or a handful of whatever I'm eating

59:04.100 --> 59:05.680
during loading times for some games.

59:05.680 --> 59:08.900
And now on PlayStation 5, I keep forgetting it's too fast to do that.

59:08.900 --> 59:15.020
Guys, yet again, yet again, I'll remind you, companies store DLC on your drive, even if

59:15.020 --> 59:16.500
you never purchase it.

59:16.500 --> 59:17.620
That's still a thing.

59:17.620 --> 59:19.060
And that is also bad.

59:19.060 --> 59:24.500
So I'm not saying the Xbox universe is completely devoid of this stuff.

59:24.500 --> 59:29.700
And we all know about the gigantic Call of Duty installs and things like that too.

59:29.700 --> 59:35.500
And I get it that part of this is, you know, the transforming to the new generation and

59:35.500 --> 59:36.620
all this stuff.

59:36.620 --> 59:41.540
But I have to needle Sony on this a little bit.

59:41.540 --> 59:47.100
Why the fuck is the PlayStation 4 version downloading to the PlayStation 5?

59:47.100 --> 59:48.940
Why?

59:48.940 --> 59:50.360
What is the benefit of that?

59:50.360 --> 59:55.420
Now if maybe I want to play that version, fine.

59:55.420 --> 59:57.100
Let somebody opt in.

59:57.140 --> 01:00:00.380
Press X to download the old version of the game and run it.

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:01.220
Cool.

01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:03.020
At least I opted into it.

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:09.340
Why are you bloating up my PlayStation 5 with an old version of the game I don't need?

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:12.060
It doesn't make sense.

01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:20.220
So Sony needs to address this like now, in my opinion, because it's again in this era of

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:25.220
bandwidth caps with all of our Zoom meetings and working from home and all this other stuff

01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:32.340
that takes up our bandwidth, to have bandwidth eaten up by games where it's not needed sucks.

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:35.620
And I think all companies, now I know I'm picking on Sony a little bit here because

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:40.020
I have the most egregious example right there, but I think all game companies should be looking

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:46.040
at is there a way to make our installs smaller?

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:49.620
For example, what Cyberpunk 2077 is coming soon, right?

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:51.460
Isn't that this week too?

01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:52.460
The 10th?

01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:53.720
Same day as the Game Awards?

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:57.480
I hear it has a day one patch of 60 gigs.

01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:58.600
All right.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:00.160
We all knew it was coming.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.960
I'm sure there's things in it.

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:04.260
They pushed the game back for three weeks for a reason.

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:07.560
They probably had to fix some things fine, whatever.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:12.420
Did it need to be 60 gigs?

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:15.880
And I think a lot of devs need to ask themselves this question.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:19.320
We need to ask these questions of game devs.

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:26.760
Again, I'm willing to let Cyberpunk slide a little bit because it is a very big triple

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.360
A game and you would expect it's going to have a large footprint.

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:37.120
You kind of know a lot of this going into it, but something like Worms, I don't think

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:41.940
you expect that same type of, you know, extra four gig download of a PlayStation 4 version

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:43.900
you're literally never going to play.

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.520
So anyway.

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:50.560
Or they should be able to handle it like PC installs where you can do, you know, just

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:53.400
the express install where it installs everything.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:59.640
Or like, say, for example, I don't know how they necessarily do localization, like say

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:03.800
if they had like recorded audio for other languages and stuff like that and say, I don't

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:04.800
want.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:09.440
Yeah, I don't need the French audio soundtrack in this, you know, allow me to uncheck that

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:12.480
option to save some space or in Call of Duty.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:17.480
I only, and they have this, I think, but like in Call of Duty, for example, like I only

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:18.560
want the campaign.

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:23.240
I don't want multiplayer or zombies, you know, I just want to download that section.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:28.920
And I think they need to chop it up with that or that way in order to be able to address

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:33.460
these bandwidth gaps until we live in a perfect society that has no bandwidth gaps.

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:38.200
So Bobby in our chat is calling out Forza Horizon on the Microsoft side as one of the

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.200
games.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:42.440
And y'all know we love some Forza Horizon, but he is calling it out as one of the games

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:47.760
that downloads extra data you don't need, saying Forza Horizon installs all the data

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:53.000
for all the cars and the DLC in managed game is just the unlock key.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.160
If the DLC is only 10 megs in the managed data list, then it's just an unlock key and

01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.720
not actually any data.

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:02.840
Now, and he goes on to clarify, and I think a lot of you guys are probably picking up

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:08.040
on this, the car data, that makes sense because if your friend has the DLC and you don't,

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:10.440
it's kind of like Mortal Kombat 11.

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:13.880
Again, you're going to have all the characters in the game, because if you go online and

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:17.960
play online, somebody else may be able to use a character that you don't have unlocked.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:18.960
Fine.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:24.120
So Forza Horizon has to do that for the cars, but do you need that entire Lego continent?

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:27.960
Do you need all the art assets for Lego and all that if you haven't bought it?

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:32.560
Well, yes, you make a good point, Loki, but you know what I'm asking here, right?

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:35.360
If I haven't bought it, why is that downloading?

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.280
Because I'm never going to be able to use it, right?

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:40.920
So I think these are the questions that we need to in turn.

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:45.640
So I want to be fair because I did, I kind of dragged Sony a little bit there.

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:48.120
There's one that Microsoft can do better on, fine.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:52.320
And then Nintendo just honestly, you know, just needs to look at online in general.

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:57.400
We got a whole other list of things they can work on.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:01.360
So there's things that they can be doing better there, especially in this era of bandwidth

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:02.360
caps.

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:06.400
So let's see, other comments here.

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:10.560
DJ Rama SS, part of the reason why Xbox game patches are huge is because sometimes the

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:14.440
game is already patched and it's bringing you the full game over again with the patched

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:15.440
content.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.560
That, that isn't really a patch.

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:20.880
That's a re-download and it should be called such.

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:28.560
Anyway, so enough, I kind of went on a tangent from the original Destiny 2 story, but it's

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:34.920
an important thing to call out in this era of the new generation of consoles, especially

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:41.920
when on both fronts, they are really relying heavy on the library from the last generation

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.480
to be moving these consoles forward.

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:47.440
And these are some important questions to be asking on all sides.

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:50.040
All right, let's move on to some news.

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:54.680
I'm hoping we can all agree as a great thing, right Dark Sakura?

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:55.680
In theory.

01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:00.240
Um, but they have cast a Solid Snake in the Metal Gear Solid film adaption.

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:04.360
Um, I'm sorry, adaptation, my, uh, my bad.

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:13.080
Um, but, uh, they've, uh, cast, um, Oscar Isaac to play him, which I can, I can kind

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.080
of see it.

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:19.720
You know, I, I, I think I always think of Snake as someone just a little bit more square

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:20.720
jaw.

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:21.720
Does that make sense?

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:26.760
Like I'm thinking like, you know, an eighties Kurt Russell, you know, but, but he'll do

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:27.760
good.

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:28.800
He'll do well.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:35.360
It's funny you say that when arguably Solid Snake was based off of Kurt Russell and Escape

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:36.360
from New York.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.920
So it's kind of funny you say that.

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:39.920
Yeah.

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:44.000
And I wasn't even thinking about it when I said it and then I was like, oh shit.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Yeah.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:51.560
Um, you know, but, but that's sort of, you know, I, I, I, I'm going to wait for, you

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:53.560
know, to reserve my judgment.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:54.560
He's a great actor.

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:55.560
Don't get me wrong.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:56.560
I love Oscar Isaac.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:59.880
I have, I have like Poe is the best part of those new star Wars movies.

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:05.920
I have two, I'm looking over here because I have two, uh, Disney infinity figures.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:09.920
I have a Tron one and I have Cora and I have Poe.

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.100
That's it.

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:16.520
So I, I, I may have a crush on Oscar Isaac, so I'm more than happy with his news.

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:22.980
Well, um, I'm still going to reserve a little bit of judgment to see, um, you know, when

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:23.980
it's out.

01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:31.100
And again, um, I'm so iffy about video game movies cause we've either had shit or we've

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:33.780
had pretty good, you know?

01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:38.840
And so, um, I'm hoping that, I mean, cause Metal Gear Solid this year, uh, as a game

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:42.820
series anyway, each of the games are so cinematic in and of themselves, even the very first

01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:43.820
one.

01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:53.500
Um, that it would be very difficult for them to fuck it up because the, the influences

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:56.340
there, you know, scene blocking is there.

01:06:56.340 --> 01:07:01.660
Um, I think it's going to be about how do they squeeze it down to two or two and a half

01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:05.280
hours or a movie size, you know, even if they let it go three hours, which is pretty long

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:08.680
for a movie, Titanic size movie, I doubt it will be that long.

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:09.680
How are they doing the whole thing?

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:10.680
How are they going to do it?

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:12.860
I think it's going to be the shadow Moses, um, story.

01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:13.860
Okay.

01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:18.500
I mean, the climbing of the ladder is going to be like 30 minutes as it is.

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:24.140
Well, it's being written by Derek Connolly who wrote, uh, uh, the rise of Skywalker and

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:28.220
a Jurassic world, which I haven't seen Jurassic world, but I really liked the rise of Skywalker.

01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:37.980
Um, and, uh, the, uh, director what Jurassic world's kind of, the first one, the first

01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:39.100
one is good.

01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:41.180
I have yet to see the second one.

01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:47.740
I hear it kind of, but, uh, I have, uh, rise of Skywalker is all right.

01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:50.740
No opinion.

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:53.020
I thought the rise of Skywalker was, uh, outstanding.

01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:54.020
I loved all of them.

01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:59.700
Um, very, very strong, uh, female oriented movies.

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:06.860
Um, but anyway, um, he, uh, we, we get, we get him as snake.

01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:10.100
Someone better yell snake at some point.

01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:14.480
Some comments from our chat over at twitch.tv slash a VOG network, DJ Rama S suggests regarding

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:15.480
Kurt Russell.

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:16.900
He could be old snake.

01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:20.020
You know, I hate to say it, but he is a little older at this point.

01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:23.680
He's playing Santa Claus in Netflix films.

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:25.380
So maybe that's a good idea.

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:28.900
Maybe an old, how would you feel about Caruso's old snake?

01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:31.740
I think as big boss, you mean?

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:32.740
Yes.

01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:35.620
I mean, depending on the story and how much they reveal.

01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:36.620
Yes.

01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:43.220
I mean, I wouldn't mind him being big boss, but they, the thing is, is that he and Isaac

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:47.020
look nothing alike.

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:49.180
So I don't really see it.

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:54.820
I mean, like their, their facial structure, like eye socket down to mouth shape.

01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:55.820
It's different.

01:08:55.820 --> 01:09:01.300
So there would be no family resemblance, you know, because, well, spoiler, he's a clone.

01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:06.540
Um, you know, if you haven't played the game 50 years ago, Questbuster and chat says the

01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:09.460
Santa Claus role is also Russell's last role.

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:10.460
He's retiring.

01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:11.780
Well, you know what?

01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:13.300
Rick Moran has said that too.

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:17.220
And then he showed up in that, um, cell phone commercial with Ryan Reynolds.

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:18.220
So anything's possible.

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:19.220
No way.

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:20.220
Rick Moran is retired.

01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:25.500
Oh no, I know why he did, but, but I don't think that that's a fair comparison.

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:26.500
Okay.

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:27.500
Fine, fine, fine.

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:31.300
Um, but well, my point is never say never, you know, it's like wrestling retirement.

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:32.300
Yeah.

01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:33.300
Okay.

01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:34.300
All right.

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:38.420
So the undertaker finally did given, that's probably another plot.

01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:43.380
Um, no, actually I think it's just, he, he, he's probably tore up.

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:49.900
So anyway, um, so now SGA does want to say about Oscar Isaac, uh, as shown her mat says

01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:52.740
Oscar Isaac is a huge fan of the series.

01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:56.340
Over a year ago, he asked in a press conference that he wants to play snake.

01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:58.860
So at least we're getting somebody that kind of knows what they're getting into.

01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:00.860
Um, so that's nice.

01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:02.660
I'm not arguing about him at all.

01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:06.380
It's just, you know, um, I really don't know this director.

01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:10.780
The only thing I said that that's listed on here is Kong skull Island, which I'll be honest,

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:14.580
I don't even think I remember that movie existing.

01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:19.340
So that was like the King Kong movie that came out after the, uh, Lord of the rings

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:22.260
director Peter Jackson's con movie, right?

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:23.260
Yeah.

01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:24.260
Yeah.

01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:27.000
Cause that's the one that's the new Toho university and the one that they have the new, the two

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.900
Godzilla movies and they're supposed to be the Godzilla and King Kong movie that's coming

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:32.940
out.

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:36.060
So that's kind of the prequel to those two or three.

01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:37.380
I never see movies.

01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:42.780
I mean, obviously it's 2020, so I can't see them in the theater anyway, but, uh, I was

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:44.380
already bad at movies.

01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:52.020
I am way, I am way outside of the, uh, the whole kaiju movies these days.

01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:55.380
I have a lot to catch up on, although I'll be honest.

01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:59.100
Just recently I went back and watched probably one of my favorite of the Godzilla movies,

01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:03.900
which was, uh, Godzilla versus mecha Ghidra because it had the dude with CD player in

01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:04.900
his head.

01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:09.860
I do say though, like I haven't watched it yet, but the last, uh, Godzilla movie that

01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:12.460
they put out looked pretty amazing.

01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:17.220
Like I think if you do have to go, if you do want to watch one of those new, new universe,

01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:21.620
that last one that they put out looked absolutely incredible, but I, I still haven't watched

01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:22.620
it yet.

01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:25.460
So the chat is lighting up with some various commentary about the Kong skull Island and

01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:30.140
how it fits into universal's monster verse, uh, which was kind of like their answer to

01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:31.460
the Marvel cinematic universe.

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:34.820
And I do remember, cause last time I was at universal studios, which was a few years ago

01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:39.060
at this point, they were already starting to like really promote like universal is the

01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:40.580
home of these classic monsters.

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:43.900
And there's very certain ones that they're promoting that I think are in line with the

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:44.900
monster verse.

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:48.640
Cause wasn't that, um, I almost said Tim Curry reboot of the mummy.

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:55.420
I wish the there's, there's, there's the Godzilla King Kong stuff.

01:11:55.420 --> 01:12:01.700
That's its own thing, but the classic, the classic do with the invisible man, the reboot

01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:05.460
of the mummy that were not as great.

01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:08.940
Um, so there's those that's, that's like, I forgot what they call it.

01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:10.340
It's like something dark universe.

01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:14.980
I can't remember what it was called, but like it's, that's its own thing that they do, but

01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:15.980
my bad.

01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:20.700
No, I think that the King Kong Godzilla stuff way better than all of that.

01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:23.500
Um, the other stuff, God, terrible.

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:24.900
All right.

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:30.380
Well maybe the, um, uh, a solid snake movie, the metal gear movie will start off a Konami

01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:35.220
cinematic universe, the KCU, and we'll get a DDR movie.

01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:36.220
All right.

01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:37.220
Maybe not.

01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:41.020
Pachinko slots, the movie.

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:42.020
Let's move on.

01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:43.020
Let's move on.

01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:44.020
Loki.

01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:45.020
What else do you have for us tonight?

01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:48.060
Uh, so we have some new updates to our consoles coming out.

01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:53.340
So Nintendo added some new features to the switch and then brand new firmware update.

01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:58.940
Uh, so the ability to now be able to take your screenshots that you make on the console

01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:03.980
and be able to transfer them to your phone or a PC.

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:05.300
So that's pretty cool.

01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:10.340
Um, they use some sort of QR code system to be able to do that.

01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:16.380
And um, or you can use a via or a USB cable to transfer to your PC.

01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:19.100
So that's kind of, um, helpful.

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:25.260
And then, um, along with that, they also added some more super Mario 30th, fifth anniversary

01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:31.460
profile icons, just to remind you that the game is going away at the end of March, allegedly.

01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:32.460
So we'll see.

01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:39.180
Um, and then of course on the Xbox side of things for the Xbox series, um, S and X and

01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:44.420
the original Xbox one, they had a new console updates that added some new dynamic background

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:51.580
designs, including some that have, uh, kind of some older console looks to them.

01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:59.660
And then they also did, um, they added some more optimized for X and S series of our badges,

01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:04.020
which I think they have those already in the, uh, they did on games pass.

01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:08.500
I guess now this is for your library as well, uh, which is helpful.

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:14.620
And I believe there's something also calling out HDR as well, um, which is nice.

01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:18.620
And then a new family member account set up stuff.

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:22.820
And they're also going to have pre-installs for games that are coming soon on Xbox game

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:23.820
pass.

01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:28.340
So if you want to, you know, preload those, you can, uh, for when those are coming out

01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:30.100
and then, yeah.

01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:35.220
So if you want to check it out, uh, it should be, I think coming out soon if it's not out

01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:36.220
already.

01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:40.980
Otherwise you can, uh, join the Xbox insider program to get access to those updates before

01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:43.700
they hit the retail side.

01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:47.980
I'm pretty sure it's out, um, on the Xbox side and then the, the Switch one is certainly

01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:52.660
out and, uh, it is, it is so convoluted to get pictures.

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:53.660
I don't understand.

01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:55.660
Like I, I understand.

01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:59.940
And Bobby's explaining the tech side of it in the chat, um, saying the QR code gives

01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:03.400
you the ability to connect to your Switch's wifi router.

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.380
The first one is the SSID for the wifi.

01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:09.300
The second is the internal web server on the Switch to download the photos or videos.

01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:12.540
And I'm just kind of like, wow.

01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:17.180
For a company that really doesn't like to get their things hacked, they just blew open

01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:20.180
the goddamn door to hackers, didn't they?

01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:27.180
Here use this code to directly tap into your Switch's, like Loki, you know more about that

01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:33.940
stuff than I do, but using this convoluted method, haven't they just like blown open

01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:36.180
the door for hackers?

01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:42.220
Probably not because it's probably just accessing a small portion of the, uh, storage on the,

01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:43.340
the system itself.

01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:48.620
They probably have it split up to it kind of like an FTP server where you may have access

01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:50.100
to certain folders.

01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:52.100
I'm guessing that's what they're doing.

01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:53.100
Um, yeah.

01:15:53.100 --> 01:16:00.640
Bobby says it's giving you access to a web server or webpage basically, but you know,

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:05.600
or they could just have it break it and download it with like, plug it into a PC or something

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:06.600
and just download it that way.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.800
Why does they got to make it super complicated?

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:12.720
We have this Nintendo Switch app, why can't it just upload the pictures to the cloud or

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:13.720
something like that?

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:20.880
And I can download them through the Nintendo app that they have available already.

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:25.200
Basically the way that Microsoft's doing it, but that would be so 2020 and that's not Nintendo.

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:27.640
We got to work a couple of decades behind.

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:29.200
Look, I'm glad it's there.

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:31.680
It's going to make the sharing of the photos a lot easier.

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:36.240
You know, all the animal crossing, you know, uh, shit posting that we all love to do.

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:42.800
Um, but I, it just, it just feels so convoluted to scan two QR codes, but whatever, whatever.

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:43.840
All right.

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:49.980
Now Bobby does say you can also drag and drop to your PC via a USB cable on the Switch.

01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:51.600
They added that method too.

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:57.720
Well that, that's a little more, you know, makes sense, but again, what else are they

01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:00.480
going to be able to do once you hook up your Switch via USB cable?

01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:02.960
I mean, yes, I know it's just a web server, but I don't know.

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:08.860
I just, I just feel like these stories inevitably lead to, they got PlayStation two games running

01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:13.360
on the Switch, you know, it's just saying, all right.

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.560
I'd never be able to run PlayStation two.

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:16.560
That's true.

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:17.560
That's true.

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:18.560
All right.

01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:19.560
Shows you how much I know.

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:20.560
All right.

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:23.840
Let's move on to, uh, speaking of like, like doing things on the older consoles, this kind

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:32.200
of came out of nowhere, uh, and it has to do with the classic RPG series Ys, not Ys,

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:39.200
although that's what it looks like when you read the name, but Ys by Nihon, Ys, Ys, Ys,

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:40.480
I said Ys, Ys.

01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:41.480
Okay.

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:46.160
So that game, uh, by Nihon Falcom is, uh, doing something a little different.

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:49.540
They're going to be porting the first and second game in the series.

01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:55.300
So Ys one and two are going to be ported to the sharp X 68,000.

01:17:55.300 --> 01:18:00.580
Now dark, Sakurai probably talked about that machine on this show years ago in one of her,

01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:02.340
uh, did it for a classic console.

01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:03.340
Yeah.

01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:07.440
But I mean, all of our listeners may not have been here when that happened.

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:12.700
So it's, uh, you know, a, a console that was only out in Japan in the eighties.

01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:13.700
You could think of the console.

01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:14.700
It was the computer.

01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:15.700
I'm sorry.

01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:16.700
Yeah.

01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:17.700
It was a home computer.

01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:18.700
You're right.

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:25.700
When I was in train, I equate it to something like Commodore 64, TI 99 4a, um, Apple 2e.

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:26.700
Those were kind of like the computers.

01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:27.700
Hell no.

01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:31.420
Well, but those, but those were the computers we had in the eighties.

01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:33.740
So this is kind of like what Japan had.

01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:34.740
Yeah.

01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:39.500
And it, it kind of blew the stuff that we had out of the water as far as what it could

01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:40.500
do for gaming.

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:41.500
Yes.

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:46.860
Um, I mean, there was also, uh, the FM towns, which also was, I'd say pretty, pretty good

01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:52.940
for, for gaming as well, but the sharp X 68,000 was the machine that pretty much ran arcade

01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:56.820
perfect versions of so many games.

01:18:56.820 --> 01:19:02.180
And it's now kind of like this one Holy grail for collectors that, um, you know, if you

01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:07.620
can find a system that works and get the, you know, the, the games for it still, you

01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:09.940
know, still intact, you know, no discreet errors.

01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:14.660
Um, and on top of that, you know, you could switch like your music synthesizer for different

01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:15.660
games.

01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:22.420
You know, sound options, but the, the X 60,000 was like the shit is still kind of the shit.

01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:24.940
Some of the best versions of games are on that system.

01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:29.460
Well, and it's interesting now that here we are in 2020 or should I say 2021 when this

01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:34.700
actually comes out March 9th, 2021 that we have East one and two are going to be released

01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:39.940
for that console or sorry, I have it on this show, but that computer, uh, that came out

01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:46.220
in 1987 and it's going to come on 3.5 inch floppy disks like they should for that year.

01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:49.740
Uh, and you know, there's going to be a smooth in game scrolling.

01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:54.660
You don't have to swap in floppies to save your progress, but it's, it's a DMA and now

01:19:54.660 --> 01:20:00.500
we hear about D makes a lot on this show, like, you know, halo 2,600, you know, the,

01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:03.380
the way I can play halo efficiently, you know, those types of things.

01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:07.740
We hear that, but those are almost always fan projects.

01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:11.780
The fact that this is like, uh, this is being done by Nihon Falcom.

01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:14.780
That's what makes this different, uh, and kind of interesting.

01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:18.540
Um, so anyhow, we do, I do want to clarify.

01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:23.940
There was a version of East one that came out in 1991, but they redid like with three

01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:26.840
pre-rendered, uh, 3d bosses.

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:31.540
This is going to be the first time the East two has ever come out on the platform.

01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:35.860
Uh, and I think it's a, I think it's a different version of East one, but don't quote me on

01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:36.860
that.

01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:39.500
Do you want to get both?

01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:42.780
Just to say, um, one of the other things is a good number of games that I've done for

01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:47.620
classic game of the week, had some of their first home releases on the strip X, 68,000,

01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:54.720
uh, Galaga, 88, Emerald dragon, um, uh, uh, it even had like tons of fighting games.

01:20:54.720 --> 01:21:01.540
So a lot of the SNK and Capcom just saying, Oh, well it's, it's, but it's, do you, um,

01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:07.940
Why, you know, no, I, I, that all makes sense, but, but why D make for this platform for

01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:08.940
$84?

01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:17.100
It still has such a big, big fan following and the people who have their, their, uh,

01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:21.620
their computers, they will play it regularly because again, these are some of the best

01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:23.620
versions of some of these games.

01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:29.740
Um, it actually doesn't really surprise me if there's a big enough audience for it.

01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:33.980
They do a limited release at a high price point, even people are going to pay for it.

01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:37.500
I mean, some of those Dreamcast ones were still going true.

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.680
We see that limited still doing Genesis games.

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:43.700
And I feel like we have some story about what limited run games is doing like at least once

01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:44.860
a month on this show.

01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:51.700
So if not more often than that, we had one last week about that, um, the Ninja game on

01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:57.780
NES that was recently put in the, um, uh, no, uh, revenge of the Ninja was the Gameboy

01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:58.780
one.

01:21:58.780 --> 01:21:59.780
It was a shadow.

01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:04.940
Now somebody, somebody, somebody in chattel shouted out, um, I think we own like two physical

01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:05.940
copies of that game.

01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:06.940
Well, there you go.

01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:08.900
Well, if you want to get a third limited run games is doing it, but anyway, actually, and

01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:12.180
I do want to say this is not, this is not through limited run games because I don't

01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:16.600
think limited run does Japan centric things.

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:18.680
So this is a shadow of the Ninja.

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:19.680
Thank you.

01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:20.680
Dark Tetsuya.

01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:24.300
Um, so yeah, this is something that Nihon Falcom is doing directly.

01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:28.580
If it sells out, sells, it's going to be interesting to see what else comes from this

01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:29.580
in my opinion.

01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:32.420
So, uh, it could be, it could be, what's old is new again.

01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:33.420
Right.

01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:34.420
So, all right.

01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:35.420
Let's move on.

01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:36.420
Dark Sakura.

01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:42.900
Oh, um, another going on actually a little bit outside of the, I guess the more fun aspects

01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:49.420
of games and, um, especially since, you know, what we've been hearing in, you know, quote,

01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:54.220
real life has been economy, this, and you know, money, that, and what we're going to

01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:55.220
do.

01:22:55.220 --> 01:23:04.340
Um, so, uh, I, um, I thought it was pretty interesting to find that video games, um,

01:23:04.340 --> 01:23:11.340
by recent reports, um, state that the video game industry in and of itself in 2019 generated

01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:24.420
90.3 billion in economic output and supported, um, uh, close to, uh, 429,000 jobs, um, with,

01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:28.740
uh, about a third of that who are actually employed in the industry.

01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:36.820
Um, and they're really generating a lot of, you know, uh, uh, tax money for, uh, you know,

01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:39.740
for, uh, their various states.

01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:47.060
Um, overall, um, California of course has the largest, uh, total economic output and

01:23:47.060 --> 01:24:00.940
employment with a $51.8 billion and a 218 90, wait, 218,090, uh, jobs.

01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:06.180
So you think about this, you know, when we were growing, growing up, you know, people

01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:11.620
say, oh, I want to do this in video games, you know, and they're like, oh, you can't

01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:17.260
make money in that, uh, excuse you, look at this, you know, you, you can, and people are

01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:18.260
making money in this deal.

01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:20.060
Or you have to live in Japan to do that.

01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:21.060
Yeah.

01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:25.380
Um, oh, but I mean, but, but think about it that way.

01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:32.380
You know, this, it is now a very, uh, lucrative industry and a very competitive industry on

01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:33.420
top of that.

01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:40.500
And, um, of course, uh, uh, women in the gaming industry are still having a very difficult,

01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:47.100
uh, you know, ceiling to, I wouldn't say it's like glass, I'm thinking more like the transparent

01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:52.900
aluminum from, uh, was it, was it Star Trek three, Star Trek four, I think it was Star

01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:54.900
Trek four, the one with the whales.

01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:55.900
Anyway.

01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:56.900
Um, okay, cool.

01:24:57.420 --> 01:25:06.260
Um, but at any rate, you know, uh, it's, uh, it's really, and I think that now with, um,

01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:12.940
you know, COVID business going on, I truly believe that it's only going to be a bigger

01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:13.940
contributor.

01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:18.780
I'm really looking at, I mean, and me who is not like the most, let's follow the stonks

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:20.780
and the economies and all that.

01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:25.340
I am super interested to see what next year's fiscal reporting looks like.

01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:26.780
Oh, sorry.

01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:31.580
I will technically this year's fiscal reporting, which I think is like, what in April.

01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:32.580
So we'll see.

01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:33.580
Yeah.

01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:37.100
Well, I mean, it makes sense that, you know, throughout this pandemic when we're really

01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:40.860
being encouraged to stay at home, you know, as an aside, I think, you know, cause this

01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:44.740
show is broadcast around the world and, and a lot of you in the States, you know, see

01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:48.420
this, and you've probably seen a lot in the news about how California is going to go back

01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:50.780
on the, the super lockdown or whatever.

01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:53.420
But what's interesting is that when I see those stories, I'm like, that's what I've

01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:58.740
been doing ever since March, like nothing, like it's so like people read those stories

01:25:58.740 --> 01:25:59.740
and go, Oh my gosh.

01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:01.540
And I look at it and go, nothing's changing.

01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:06.460
Well, but going into another thing on this though, well, but keep in mind, Rob, people

01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:12.300
like you and me, we are in the minority, especially as you said, there were people protesting

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:18.020
the lockdown by being super spreaders, especially, especially North of here and in the central

01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:19.020
Valley.

01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:22.580
And what was the first place to go on lockdown and who's next?

01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:26.460
Well, technically the most, the most populated area of the state also is on the super lockdown,

01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:29.620
but who was right after him, the central Valley, who's going to be next?

01:26:29.620 --> 01:26:30.620
The North state.

01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:31.620
Yeah.

01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:39.060
Um, but going, going back to another thing though, is, and I was reading another article

01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:45.020
today, I think it was by Forbes or business insider, one of the two that whatever happens

01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:52.260
with, um, you know, with vaccines and, you know, going back to the former normal, um,

01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:55.980
the way people work has been irrevocably changed.

01:26:55.980 --> 01:27:03.820
They've proven that you can do, um, uh, that telecommuting is not just, uh, a valid means

01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:07.820
of work, but people are in a lot of cases, more productive by doing so.

01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:12.380
My, my work will have a permanent change involving telework due to this whole thing.

01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:16.700
I'm hoping that that mine does, but they're not expecting us to go eat remotely back into

01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:19.500
the office until maybe late next year, which I'm fine with that.

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:20.500
Yeah.

01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:21.500
And I'm not saying a hundred percent.

01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:22.500
I'm saying it's a change.

01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:23.500
It's going to be a change.

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:25.380
It's going to be more open than they were ever talking about before.

01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:29.340
Well, so, but the other thing too, is that it's also changed things for like the medical

01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:30.340
field.

01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:34.780
Um, how many of us have had, um, our doctor's visits now on video?

01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:35.780
Yeah.

01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:39.620
You know, um, I mean, just, just saying in general, it's really changed the way a lot

01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:43.860
of business operates for the better, I think.

01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:51.300
Um, and if you look at it this way, it's even, I think helping environmentally by hopefully

01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:59.420
lowering, you know, physical commute time and operating costs of large, uh, large commercial

01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:00.900
buildings, for example.

01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:08.420
And so with video games, I'm not sure how many, um, designers, um, well, I mean, sure,

01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:13.620
I'm pretty sure a designer with a good enough, uh, system at home would be able to, to do

01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:17.420
a lot of their work from a, a, a home studio.

01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:22.980
Um, a lot of, a lot are doing it now, just really boosting up their, their home studios

01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:23.980
that way.

01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:31.140
And I'm sure that anyone doing any of the more clerical end of this, um, or writing

01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:33.900
end of this, they're going to be able to do it.

01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:40.340
So I'm seeing entire studios keep being as productive as they are, but doing it from

01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:41.940
the safety of their homes.

01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:42.940
Yeah.

01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:43.940
I think there's, it's good.

01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:47.820
You know, that we talk about like the new normal and I don't think the new normal is

01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:49.780
necessarily a bunch of scary things.

01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:53.200
I think, um, there's a lot of like, really good.

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:56.500
And I think those of us that are tech inclined, and I think if you listen to the show and

01:28:56.500 --> 01:29:02.020
you are a hardcore or even casual core fan of video games, you are somewhat tech inclined.

01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:03.660
And I think there's a lot about that new normal.

01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:05.380
That's going to be very friendly to us.

01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:09.160
You know, I think like, like web conferencing and these types of things, we were doing this

01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:13.140
for a long time and back to the original story that, that brought us to this video games

01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:18.020
being a major part of the economy and a major outlet for release and a thing that we do

01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:19.920
to bond with other people.

01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:23.340
You know, we all knew this and I think a lot of people in our generation knew this, but

01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:29.780
I think even more, especially people older than us have come to things like Jackbox games.

01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:30.980
Great example, right?

01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:35.460
I know heck of people that maybe played the occasional phone game, but didn't really play

01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:39.940
a lot of video games, um, that like, were like, Oh, I love Jackbox games.

01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:42.340
Let's, let's have a Jackbox night or get together and do that.

01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:46.980
You know, that's, that's now money in the video game economy that wasn't there before,

01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:47.980
you know?

01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:53.220
So I think, I think, uh, and especially people that are developing things like this, um,

01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:58.420
and among us, can I just go on a quick tangent?

01:29:58.420 --> 01:29:59.700
Let's talk about among us.

01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:01.500
Let's do that.

01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:02.940
Let's talk about among us.

01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:08.260
I saw an interesting thing on Twitter about how some people really don't want to play

01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:13.020
among us or our little resistance to that game, because they don't like the element

01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:17.500
of lying to their friends and getting accused of lying.

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:19.940
And I'm, I'm completely sensitive to that.

01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:23.900
And I get that it's interesting because I haven't played a lot of among us yet.

01:30:23.900 --> 01:30:29.140
I totally play these survivor games online where I lie and do all this crap that I would

01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:30.700
never do in real life.

01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:33.980
But I also understand that really isn't for everybody.

01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:35.420
And I get that.

01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:40.060
But I, the reason why I bring up among us and, and it's, even though those critiques

01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:46.900
are kind of there, like why has that game skyrocketed the way that it has this year?

01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:53.060
Like that game is a very brilliant example about how I think the, the needs and wants

01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:58.660
of the gaming community and the types of games that ended up being successful has kind of

01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:04.540
changed because of the pandemic, you know, among us came out in like 2018 and everybody

01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:07.340
suddenly asking themselves, well, why now?

01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:08.940
Why is that game coming out now?

01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:16.000
Because in a way y'all, among us is like that really short condensed versions of Dungeons

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.260
and Dragons.

01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:24.700
Bear with me, D&D fans, I don't mean to sacrilege here, but it's a way of telling a story with

01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:30.500
your friends in this virtual setting and getting to do what is kind of inherently a social

01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:31.500
thing.

01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:32.500
I don't know.

01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:36.980
Jamie, you got to have some thoughts on this whole like among us and how the pandemic has

01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:39.420
allowed that game to be so successful.

01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:41.940
I think I've already had that same discussion with Animal Crossing.

01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:42.940
Oh, okay.

01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:43.940
Fair.

01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:44.940
Fair.

01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:50.820
It's a little thing to lose yourself in it's, you know, you can be social in it.

01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:54.460
I mean, it's more for the people who have like the social need, it is a way to get together

01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:59.100
with your friends and play a game without getting together with your friends.

01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:03.020
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, yes, but those survivor games are against people you probably

01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:05.300
never met.

01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:07.260
Half true.

01:32:07.260 --> 01:32:08.260
For the most part, yes.

01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:10.520
I don't want to just like be contrary into your statement.

01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:15.180
But there were like a couple people in that game that like I knew about, or I kind of

01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:17.620
knew them through somebody else.

01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:21.940
But also, like through that process, yes, there was lying and I did a lot of it to win

01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:23.100
the game.

01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:28.900
But there are people in that game that like I will talk to, like if certain people that

01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:32.460
were in that game and they who know who they are, if they ever needed anything from me,

01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:34.460
I would drop a lot.

01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:38.500
Like I made some really good lifelong friends out of that process, honestly.

01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:39.500
So yeah.

01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:40.500
Anyway.

01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:41.500
Okay, let's move on.

01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:45.720
Sorry, we got a lot of tangents and it's my fault.

01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:50.300
But we have a direct to get to very soon and our classic pinball table of the month.

01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:54.420
But first, we're going to get to this next story, Loki.

01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:56.500
All right.

01:32:56.500 --> 01:33:04.260
So we've got some interesting changes at Sony.

01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:16.180
So apparently, the creator of Silent Hill and Gravity Rush, Kichiro Toyama, has actually

01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:21.800
left Sony and formed his own studio.

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:22.800
So that's pretty awesome.

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:26.400
It seems to be kind of the trend, you know, a lot of these big names, you know, coming

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:27.960
out and forming their own studio.

01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:32.840
So he has a new outfit called Bokeh Game Studios.

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:42.880
And yeah, so basically, along with that, he's also got Kazunobu Sato, who designed Puppeteer,

01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:46.080
if you remember that game on PlayStation 3.

01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:48.080
Yeah.

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:52.200
And then also was the producer of The Last Guardian.

01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:58.320
And then Junya Okura, who was a designer on Gravity Rush.

01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:00.560
So pretty nice pedigree there.

01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:03.880
Be curious to see what they're working on.

01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:07.360
Yeah, that's interesting.

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:09.880
Some big, big departures there.

01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:13.980
And it certainly kind of gives a swift kick in the butt to all these Silent Hill reboot

01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:16.920
at Sony rumors that go around every couple months.

01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:22.000
But well, they have some sketches that's in their little video talking about their new

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.520
chapter or whatever.

01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:26.880
And it is certainly horror looking.

01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:31.180
So maybe we'll see.

01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:33.200
I mean, so yeah, it's the other game.

01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:35.260
They also worked on Siren as well.

01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:37.520
So that's that's pretty interesting.

01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:38.520
Yeah.

01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:39.520
Yeah.

01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:41.720
So I guess we'll wait and see.

01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:44.280
Perhaps we'll hear something about that at the Game Awards.

01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:45.280
Perhaps.

01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:46.280
I was thinking.

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:47.280
Yeah.

01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:48.280
So we'll wait and see.

01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:49.280
All right.

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:50.620
Well, all right.

01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:56.180
So talking about departures, I know Dark Soccer is really thrilled to talk about this.

01:34:56.180 --> 01:35:00.780
There are some big departures that happen at BioWare this week and in advance of New

01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:06.820
Dragon Age news at the Game Awards, Casey Hudson, who at one time was the creative director

01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:10.400
behind the Mass Effect series, but at one point recently became the general.

01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:14.340
He left once and then came back as the general manager of BioWare.

01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:18.100
And now he's leaving again and saying, I'm incredibly fortunate to have had a career

01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:22.100
where I've been able to work with brilliantly talented people, create entire worlds from

01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:25.860
our imaginations and see them being enjoyed by millions of people around the world.

01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:30.080
And now, after nearly 20 years of work at BioWare, I've made the decision to retire

01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:33.820
from the studio and make way for the next generation of studio leaders.

01:35:33.820 --> 01:35:34.820
Interesting.

01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:37.900
He's retiring from the studio, but he didn't say he was retiring from the game industry.

01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:40.220
Just something I just something I observe.

01:35:40.220 --> 01:35:42.500
That's all I'm just making observations.

01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:46.380
But the interesting thing is that would have been news in itself if he'd left.

01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:51.780
Because the same day that news came out, Dragon Age executive producer Mark Darrah

01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:56.540
also left, saying, though I remain confident in BioWare's strength and continued place

01:35:56.540 --> 01:36:00.580
in this conversation, I have decided to retire from my position at BioWare.

01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:05.740
Again, I can't help but note, not the game industry, but BioWare.

01:36:05.740 --> 01:36:11.460
Anyway, obviously nothing is going to change with development on the new Dragon Age and

01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:15.820
the Mass Effect remaster games, whatever the hell is going on with Anthem.

01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:21.260
Laura Miles, I hope I'm saying her name right, sorry, who is the chief studio officer at

01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:26.060
Electronic Arts kind of put out her own statement alongside this, pretty much reassuring fans

01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:28.540
that things are going to be just fine.

01:36:28.540 --> 01:36:33.520
And it is interesting to note that Christian Daley, who used to be with Blizzard Entertainment,

01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:37.100
is taking over for the Dragon Age 4 end of things.

01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:41.620
And Mike Gamble will be taking over on the Mass Effect remaster, which I would imagine

01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:43.840
is pretty close to completion at this point.

01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:51.740
So we'll see what happens with the future of the Mass Effect franchise.

01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:52.740
So I don't know.

01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:56.800
The fact that they're both happening the same day is a little weird to me.

01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:58.740
And I don't know if anything's wrong with BioWare.

01:36:58.740 --> 01:37:02.140
I feel like this smells like an EA thing.

01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:03.460
I don't know.

01:37:03.460 --> 01:37:04.900
Could it maybe just be a coincidence?

01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:05.900
I don't know.

01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:06.900
Darrah?

01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:11.580
I'm sure we'll get an article down the road telling us about some shenanigans going on

01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:12.580
behind the scenes.

01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:18.120
Well, the shenanigans I want to hear is that those two formed a new studio, or this would

01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:19.780
be a gag.

01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:24.680
They joined that studio that the Blizzard folks made, which I...

01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:25.680
What was the name of it?

01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:29.240
It had a very tongue in cheek name.

01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:31.240
Somebody will remember it in chat, but the Blizzard...

01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:32.240
Very cold weather.

01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:34.160
No, the Blizzard, it's like ice something.

01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:39.540
The Blizzard folks made a new studio and I don't know why.

01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:42.320
Maybe it's just because there's that Blizzard tie in towards the end there, but I don't

01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:45.220
know why I feel like that would be such a gag.

01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:46.940
DarkSakura, you are the resident...

01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:47.940
Oh, thank you.

01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:48.940
Frost King Games.

01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:49.940
Thank you.

01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:50.940
Frost Giant.

01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:51.940
Frost Giant game.

01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:52.940
Thank you.

01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:53.940
I knew there was a play there.

01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:57.460
DarkSakura, you are the resident BioWare fangirl of many sorts.

01:37:57.460 --> 01:37:58.460
Your thoughts?

01:37:58.460 --> 01:37:59.460
Cool.

01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:06.160
I knew there were shenanigans going on.

01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:07.160
I don't want to speculate.

01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:09.420
I just want to see what happens.

01:38:09.420 --> 01:38:10.420
Show me the product.

01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:14.440
That's how I've been for just about everything these days.

01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:17.280
Okay, people have done this stuff.

01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:18.880
People leave companies all the time.

01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:21.040
They're just not as high profile, right?

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:23.320
Let's see what they're going to do with it.

01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:24.480
High profile folks leave too.

01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:27.840
I mean, Blizzard, Mike Morhaime, that's a pretty big deal.

01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:33.080
Some have noted that Blizzard's quality has dipped a little bit, but that's another story

01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:35.480
for another day, I suppose.

01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:36.920
So yeah, interesting.

01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:42.980
For me, I want to see what happens, not guess about what's going on.

01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:48.900
There have been way too many times that people have speculated stuff and been wrong, and

01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:50.900
I don't want to be wrong.

01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:52.620
I want to be pleased.

01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:54.620
Sometimes it's fun to be wrong, but only sometimes.

01:38:54.620 --> 01:38:55.620
All right.

01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:56.620
From what planet?

01:38:56.620 --> 01:38:57.620
I'm never wrong.

01:38:57.620 --> 01:38:58.620
That's why I don't speculate.

01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:03.620
So I can be right all the time.

01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:08.320
And let's go to another category that you are certainly an expert on, and that is classic

01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:13.640
games as we get to the classic game of the week.

01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:18.600
But of course, as you know, once a month here on this show in a 2020 twist, we go into the

01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:22.520
archives and choose a pinball game to talk about.

01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:28.080
So it's time for the classic pinball table of the month, our last one for 2020.

01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:31.160
Did we determine a 2021 theme?

01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:32.160
I thought we had.

01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:35.140
I don't think I did.

01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:36.140
I don't know.

01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:37.140
I might think of one.

01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:38.140
All right.

01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:43.100
So 2021 twist to be determined unless someone in chat, I'll do, I'll do non classic game

01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:44.100
of the month.

01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:45.100
All right.

01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:48.600
But we still have one more pinball table to get us through the year.

01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:52.800
So dark soccer, what is December's classic pinball table of the month?

01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:58.260
I picked a table that is sort of a transitional table, the kind of the end of its particular

01:39:58.260 --> 01:40:04.560
era and another John Papadook table, because, you know, I love my John Papadook tables.

01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:12.880
So Circus Voltaire, it came out in 1997, done by John Papadook and released by Williams

01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:14.960
under their ballet label.

01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:21.800
And it has the player, the sort of theme of it is doing different quote marvels to join

01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:23.760
the circus.

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:27.800
And it has a few very distinctive things going on with it.

01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:32.340
One of its features has a neon light that runs along the right hand ramp and a pop bumper

01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:38.180
that rises up in the middle of the play field and a magnet at the top left ramp that can

01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:40.860
catch the balls and divert them into locks.

01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:43.340
They're a ball catcher.

01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:48.580
And the biggest feature is the ringmaster, which is a head that rises up to taunt the

01:40:48.580 --> 01:40:50.300
player.

01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:51.420
And I must apologize.

01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:58.600
I tried to find the a digital table so we could get better sound on it.

01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:02.300
And I found sort of like a how to play.

01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:09.240
So and for anyone who is watching the video while we are live, you might notice that the

01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:14.560
DMD is interesting, that it's an interesting place.

01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:21.680
So only two tables had their DMD is in such a place like this.

01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:23.960
The other one was Capcom's flipper football.

01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:32.000
You know, Capcom had a kind of a limited run doing pinballs, but the the two of them have

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:38.040
their DMD not on the top marquee, but sunken into the play field.

01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:44.200
It's on the back box in the right, the right back box into the cabinet.

01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:51.180
So the point of that, as I say, was to not distract the player from gameplay by looking

01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:56.720
up for their modes and their shots and to see what was going on.

01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:07.760
And it also does have a little bit more interactivity, like animation that shows a cannonball fired.

01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:11.000
It has different things that are a little bit more integration.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:19.520
Why I say that this was a bit of a transitional game is that the sunken DMD could be considered

01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:29.740
a precursor to the pinball 2000 series, where the display was a holographic projection on

01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:30.740
top of the table.

01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:36.840
Games like Revenge from Mars and Episode One Racing, Episode One Master, whatever, Star

01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:39.720
Wars Episode One.

01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:44.440
And this this was I mean, I'll be honest, it's a little bit actually more distracting

01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:46.640
me to have it on the back box.

01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:52.840
I have played the Circus Voltaire a couple of times, kind of an interesting one to find.

01:42:52.840 --> 01:43:00.480
But yeah, as you were watching the the wizard mode going on right now, right?

01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:03.340
Yeah, it's a really neat table.

01:43:03.340 --> 01:43:08.480
The ramps in this are actually pretty, pretty insane, I would think.

01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:11.760
I really, I really think that the layout of this was really good.

01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:15.080
Again, I love Papa Duke's design and pinball.

01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:22.120
So as far as the modes, you have nine quote marvels that you have to complete until you

01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:27.480
are invited to join the circus and that circus with a Q, C-I-R-Q-U-S.

01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:35.380
They are in a three by three square grid with the row and column corresponding to C-I-R-Q-U-S.

01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:39.800
And when you fill the grid, then you get the join the circus wizard mode.

01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:47.100
So you have juggler and then you can start a juggler multiball with that sideshow random

01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:53.380
award ringmaster frenzy where you defeat the ringmaster twice to start frenzy multiball

01:43:53.380 --> 01:44:03.500
menagerie where you hit some targets on the left to do a large plastic captive ball defeated

01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:07.020
all ringmasters where you can do special multiball.

01:44:07.020 --> 01:44:10.980
There's high wire multiball where you hit the light lock targets on either side of the

01:44:10.980 --> 01:44:16.680
left ramp and then shoot the ramp three times to lock the balls and start high wire multiball.

01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:19.060
Spin is the spinner.

01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:25.580
Boom is you spell out volt and then once the letters are collected, the third pop bumper

01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:31.680
pops up and you get that after the timer runs out, you get your marble after the timer runs

01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:37.720
out and every hit on that bumper counts towards lighting an extra ball.

01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:42.760
And then you have acrobats where you shoot the right ramp or orbit four times.

01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:50.020
So you also have the character, the ringmaster that lives under the play field.

01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:54.260
It's a flat circular platform attached to the top of his head.

01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:59.840
And he sits directly in front of the W-O-W targets in the upper right hand corner and

01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:01.880
has a hidden magnet.

01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:05.100
So once the targets have been hit a total of three times, the magnet catches and holds

01:45:05.100 --> 01:45:09.100
the ball as the ringmaster will rise to taunt the player.

01:45:09.100 --> 01:45:12.820
And then the ball is shot off in a random direction.

01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:19.320
You will have a very brief ball saver if it does go out of play.

01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:31.320
And basically after after it's stood up, you would have to hit it five times and it will

01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:32.320
further expose.

01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:38.120
He's going to expose himself a hole where you can shoot a ball into his hole.

01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:39.360
Yeah.

01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:43.240
Like I said before, there are the various multiball modes in order.

01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:48.760
We have ringmaster frenzy, ringmaster Raz, ringmaster special.

01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:55.480
And the ringmaster battle, which you get if you have defeated all the ringmasters.

01:45:55.480 --> 01:46:00.680
So those are your big, big four ringmaster multiballs.

01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:05.380
The other ones, like I said, are high wire juggler neon, which is one of the sideshow

01:46:05.380 --> 01:46:11.960
random awards for three balls strike and arc multiball, which is a two ball multi.

01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:15.320
The ringmaster ones are all two ball as well.

01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:19.620
High wire juggler neon are all three.

01:46:19.620 --> 01:46:25.160
And then, of course, when you get after all nine, then you have your your join the circus

01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:30.360
wizard mode where you have to spell circus unmaskable tear, meet the circus, and then

01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:35.680
you have party multiball and join the circus ends when either all of them drain in any

01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:43.080
of the first three phases or when the three balls drain in the fourth arc of it.

01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:50.000
The circus will tear for anyone who who likes to play the virtual versions.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:55.420
It was formally available in pinball arcade until June 30th, twenty eighteen.

01:46:55.420 --> 01:46:58.560
Williams Midway license did expire.

01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:05.140
Then it was licensed to Zen Studios, who had that in pinball effects three and as an unlockable

01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:10.440
in Williams pinball mobile for iOS and Android.

01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:15.680
There were unlicensed versions for visual pinball for four windows.

01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:19.280
But yeah, I really enjoy this one.

01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:25.080
I mean, I've pretty much have never played a Papa Duke designed table that I don't like.

01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:29.120
The only thing that freaks me out is that, you know, I'm just like this person that like

01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:34.080
if a game has like a head on it, it kind of freaks me out.

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:38.120
Like maybe this one wasn't as bad as like, say, fun house fun house freaks me the fuck

01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:39.120
out.

01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:45.760
It's just it's that Rudy had, you know, but it's a it's a really enjoyable table with

01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:49.700
with an awesome theme, quite a bit of challenge to it.

01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:56.920
And I'll be honest, the last time I played a circus Voltaire, I think was in Las Vegas

01:47:56.920 --> 01:48:00.440
at the pinball museum when I went with Tara.

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:01.440
Yeah.

01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:02.440
Yeah.

01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:05.040
So there you go.

01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:11.960
The classic pinball of the of the month of December last one for this year is Circus

01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:12.960
Voltaire.

01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:14.660
All right.

01:48:14.660 --> 01:48:15.660
Awesome choice.

01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:20.520
I think I remember seeing this one when I went to that same museum in Vegas, which hopefully

01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:22.480
I'll be able to visit again at some point.

01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:24.260
So all right.

01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:28.000
So great choice for I like how you kind of pick something that kind of transition to

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.200
a new era of pinball.

01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:32.160
That's a good kind of note to go out on for the classic pinballs.

01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:36.760
I will point out that the chat has a lot of lovely ideas for twenty twenty one, although

01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:38.580
ultimately it's up to you.

01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:39.580
Some of the ideas.

01:48:39.580 --> 01:48:40.580
Yeah.

01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:42.640
Some of the ideas that are getting thrown out there.

01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:44.720
Indie game of the month.

01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:46.840
Classic remake of the week.

01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:49.200
A couple of people were suggesting crappy game.

01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:52.780
In my opinion, you've already kind of been doing crappy like you did Miss Nude World

01:48:52.780 --> 01:48:57.800
ninety six is a classic game once like crappy games are sometimes classic because they're

01:48:57.800 --> 01:48:58.800
crappy.

01:48:58.800 --> 01:48:59.800
Yeah.

01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:02.880
And the thing is, is it usually when I pick a crappy game, there's like a notability to

01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:08.800
it, like either in pop culture or that it led to something, you know, or it's like a

01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:09.800
cult classic.

01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:10.800
Yeah.

01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:15.000
Wasn't that like we did that for like one of the it was it one of the numbered episodes

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.000
like a six.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000
It was like a six.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.480
It was like six hundred or five hundred or one of the yeah.

01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:20.480
It was a anniversary.

01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:22.280
I was one of those.

01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:23.760
So yeah.

01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:25.800
And as pointed out, it was an in-joke from the show.

01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:27.780
It sure was.

01:49:27.780 --> 01:49:31.700
Some ideas of my own that weren't said, I'll just throw out there for your consideration.

01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:35.820
I was thinking classic collectible like you've done peripheral.

01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:38.780
But then I was thinking of like some of those like crazy things in the vault, like that

01:49:38.780 --> 01:49:39.780
game that had the dish.

01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:40.780
I don't know.

01:49:40.780 --> 01:49:41.780
It's a classic.

01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:42.780
Yeah.

01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:43.780
Maybe maybe I'll do that.

01:49:43.780 --> 01:49:44.780
The classic dish of the week.

01:49:44.780 --> 01:49:45.780
Classic.

01:49:45.780 --> 01:49:47.940
I'll do classic recipe.

01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:50.180
Classic pie of the month.

01:49:50.180 --> 01:49:54.860
Another idea I had since I know you're all about like books and things actually to now

01:49:54.860 --> 01:49:56.820
one just popped in my head.

01:49:56.860 --> 01:50:02.060
I think instruction manual or box art might be a good one where you talk about and I know

01:50:02.060 --> 01:50:06.340
that might not be great for a podcast, but I think it might be a cool thing to acknowledge,

01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:09.520
you know, especially because I know you got a design background, so it might be a fun

01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:10.520
thing to talk about.

01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:14.540
But I was thinking when I originally thought a book, I was thinking we have all these magazines

01:50:14.540 --> 01:50:18.220
that have gone by the wayside, you know, and like other like, you know, printed books that

01:50:18.220 --> 01:50:19.220
we might remember.

01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:20.220
I don't know.

01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:23.660
Like the strategy guide that everybody got for Final Fantasy with Nintendo Power, you

01:50:23.660 --> 01:50:24.660
know, things like that.

01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:26.320
And I think about it.

01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:27.320
What was the other one?

01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:29.320
I had one other one that I thought of.

01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:30.320
And now I can't remember.

01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:31.320
Oh, well.

01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:32.320
But you have a lot to think about for 2021.

01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:33.320
OK.

01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:34.320
Yeah.

01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:37.640
And Bobby did rightly point out that I did Halo as a classic game, but bear in mind,

01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:38.640
I did it for money.

01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:39.640
Yes, that is right.

01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:40.640
That is right.

01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:41.640
I did it.

01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:47.480
I put a bounty of five hundred dollars to pay my mother's bills.

01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:52.000
And I did Halo because of the generosity of our Orange Lounge listeners.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.120
Yes, Bobby, you totally paid for that.

01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:56.320
And my mother thanks you.

01:50:56.320 --> 01:51:00.800
It kept her in her house and fed for a month.

01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:03.740
So thank you very much for your kindness to my mom.

01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:07.480
I like how YYRS going meta here saying a classic OLR clip of the month.

01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:10.960
We don't have 12 classic moments.

01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:12.760
Like I remember any shit we've done.

01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:13.760
I don't remember.

01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:14.760
Do you remember?

01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:15.760
I don't remember.

01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:18.400
Dartits is going to take over the segment because he knows more about this show than

01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:19.400
I do.

01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:25.040
I remember laying in your bed, Rob, at the apartment eating Loki's waffles.

01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:30.280
No, you know who knows more about this show than me, you and Loki combined, Misty.

01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:32.760
Misty knows more about this show than any of us.

01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:38.120
Like I think I think the only way you're going to get if the only way you're getting that

01:51:38.120 --> 01:51:40.560
segment is if Misty volunteers to do it.

01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:43.960
Maybe I'll do classic OLR listener of the month.

01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:45.960
Oh, that'd be cute.

01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:46.960
I like that.

01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:49.520
Yeah, I mean, but I don't want to leave anybody out.

01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:50.920
Yeah, that's true.

01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:54.960
Maybe you could do people that aren't really here anymore.

01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:58.580
Like that sounds really morbid, you know, like puppy, right?

01:51:58.580 --> 01:52:02.200
Like he's got like a kid and they're all into Star Wars.

01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:10.920
The 23rd, Drew and his joke book and their DDR angels streaming now under oh, God, I

01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:11.920
forgot.

01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:12.920
Like tech angel.

01:52:12.920 --> 01:52:13.920
It's tech angel.

01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:14.920
Thank you.

01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:15.920
I was almost a complete jerk.

01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:16.920
So anyway.

01:52:16.920 --> 01:52:17.920
All right.

01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:19.920
Look, we got to move on.

01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:20.920
So.

01:52:20.920 --> 01:52:21.920
All right.

01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:22.920
Yeah.

01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:24.920
Well, Dark Sakura will stew on this question and we'll let you know soon.

01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:32.960
I'll tell you what for find me on my Twitter at Dark Sakura and, you know, start a thread.

01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:33.960
Leave me some ideas.

01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:34.960
Shit.

01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:37.000
I'll take a look at it because I don't know what to do.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.000
All right.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:44.880
Well, speaking of iconic listeners of OLR's past and present and future, YYR, our friend

01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:49.000
out there on the East Coast, you know, we have these things that are on the Orange Lounge

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:52.640
Radio Wiki that are the Orange Lounge Radio Dream Games.

01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:54.400
So just we haven't had one in a while.

01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:58.040
I think some things we've kind of just mentioned off the cusp, but especially in some of the

01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:01.900
earlier days of the of the podcast format of the show and so forth, we've we've kind

01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:06.360
of thrown out these ideas like that should be a game that needs to be a game.

01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:08.800
And so a few of these ideas have gone out there.

01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:12.920
And YYR has put together some of these games as a reality.

01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:15.240
Like he actually asked, can I make these games a reality?

01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:18.160
And the first one he ever did was Bungee Ferret Tossing.

01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:23.640
And that was a game that was available on the Xbox 360 indie arcade.

01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:29.440
And YYR, a little more recently in the era of the PlayStation Vita, did a game called

01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:32.340
Pixel Shits, but he had to rename it Pixel Poops.

01:53:32.340 --> 01:53:34.480
But the dream game was technically Pixel Shits.

01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:41.040
And this is something that Dark Sakura just verbally pooped here on the show.

01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:48.800
Sometimes, but well, but look at you, it became a game and everybody listens to the show knows

01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:49.800
about it.

01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:50.800
So.

01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:53.640
And you have your very own direct for your game.

01:53:53.640 --> 01:53:56.240
Yes, so that's what we're getting to.

01:53:56.240 --> 01:54:00.440
We're going to get to YYR's official Pixel Poops direct.

01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:02.760
And now I've been a very good boy and scouts honor.

01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:04.520
I have no idea what he's going to talk about here.

01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:06.120
Well, I assume it's Pixel Poops.

01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:10.040
I don't know if he has any other surprises or what's happening, but we're going to play

01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:11.040
it.

01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:12.280
So I'm going to let you guys.

01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:14.660
So Dark Sakura and Loki, in order for you guys to see it, you're going to need to bring

01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:16.240
up the feed and watch it on your side.

01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:19.880
So if you guys can mute yourselves and do that so you can see it.

01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:20.880
And we will.

01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:21.880
Hold on.

01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:22.880
Yeah.

01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:25.160
I just realized I've inspired YYR to take a big shit on a video game.

01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:26.160
Yes, you have.

01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:27.160
Yes, you have.

01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:28.160
Thanks, dude.

01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:29.160
All right.

01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:32.440
So you may mute yourselves, guys, and make your way to the Twitch page so you can see

01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:33.440
this.

01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:34.820
And I'm actually gonna be watching this for the first time, too, but I am going to go

01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:35.820
on mute.

01:54:35.820 --> 01:54:39.760
I will say for the podcast listeners, this is about an eight and a half minute video.

01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:43.180
I'm assuming there is going to be gameplay footage of some kind.

01:54:43.180 --> 01:54:45.580
It may not translate very well to a podcast.

01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:47.000
I don't know how YYR did this.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.580
I don't know because I haven't really seen the video.

01:54:49.580 --> 01:54:53.440
So if you need to, this segment is about eight and a half minutes.

01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:58.000
And if you want to see the video, I'm almost certain YYR will put it up on his Twitter

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:03.600
at YYR underscore, as well as his website, which is YYR games dot com.

01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:04.600
Okay.

01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:05.600
And he says there's voiceover the whole time.

01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:06.600
So good.

01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:09.020
He thought of you podcasties and you won't get bored.

01:55:09.020 --> 01:55:12.900
So if you want to see the video side of it, it will be up on those sites.

01:55:12.900 --> 01:55:13.900
Absolutely.

01:55:13.900 --> 01:55:14.900
So it's podcast friendly.

01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:15.900
All right.

01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:19.260
Then without further ado, let's get to it.

01:55:19.260 --> 01:55:34.380
The Pixel Poops Direct from YYR Games.

01:55:34.380 --> 01:55:36.900
Welcome to Pixel Poops Direct.

01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:41.460
I'm Aaron Teplitski, creator of Pixel Poops.

01:55:41.460 --> 01:55:43.460
Let's not mince words here.

01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:49.020
As you know, 2020 has been the year of shit.

01:55:49.020 --> 01:55:54.660
Possibly the shittiest year so far in many of our lifetimes.

01:55:54.660 --> 01:55:57.660
The good news is it's almost over.

01:55:57.660 --> 01:56:02.020
The bad news is there's one more piece of shit in store for you.

01:56:02.020 --> 01:56:06.060
Pixel Poops is coming to Steam.

01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:07.060
That's right.

01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:12.380
This Atari 2600 inspired pile of shit from 2015 is coming back.

01:56:12.380 --> 01:56:17.420
Once again, you'll play as an angry human with the highest metabolism imaginable on

01:56:17.420 --> 01:56:21.700
a mission to exact vengeance on happy, motivated joggers.

01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:22.700
Why?

01:56:22.700 --> 01:56:24.040
Because you can.

01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:27.860
And you're doing it the only way you know how.

01:56:27.860 --> 01:56:32.700
Small shits will only slow the joggers down, but keep shitting and you'll produce huge

01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:34.460
piles of shit.

01:56:34.460 --> 01:56:36.960
These will stop joggers in their tracks.

01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:38.880
And you'll score a point.

01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:44.580
And if you manage to combo multiple joggers in a single pile of shit, you get a bonus.

01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:45.940
Can't shit anymore?

01:56:45.940 --> 01:56:46.940
No problem.

01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:50.440
Just head back over to this taco restaurant and eat up.

01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:56.540
But don't let too many of the joggers get away, or it's game over.

01:56:56.540 --> 01:56:59.820
So what was the point of bringing this shit back?

01:57:00.260 --> 01:57:04.820
Well, actually, the Steam version has a lot of new shit.

01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:09.420
First off, there are three entirely new ways to play.

01:57:09.420 --> 01:57:13.340
Game two is remix, which switches things up in new ways.

01:57:13.340 --> 01:57:16.580
Some joggers will now be able to switch direction.

01:57:16.580 --> 01:57:19.340
You'll also have to look out for this guy.

01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:21.220
He's a tax collector.

01:57:21.220 --> 01:57:22.580
His name?

01:57:22.580 --> 01:57:24.780
Feces.

01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:28.240
And if he touches you, you'll be fine 10 points.

01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:32.680
But if you can trap him in a nice warm pile, you'll get double points.

01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:38.040
Finally, say hello to your ultimate weapon, the poop bomb.

01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:42.000
Just hold the button down and...

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.900
This will totally empty your chamber though, so you'll need to hurry and eat some tacos

01:57:45.900 --> 01:57:47.760
to keep going.

01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:52.520
And you'll have to score some points before you can use the poop bomb again.

01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:57.640
Game three is alternate, which allows you to get creative with your shit.

01:57:57.640 --> 01:58:02.360
Players who reach your small or medium shits will turn 90 degrees to the right.

01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:08.080
This will allow you to corral them around, hopefully into a nice big steaming pile.

01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:13.640
Your shits will slowly degrade, but don't worry, you've got more.

01:58:13.640 --> 01:58:17.640
Last but not least, game four is simple.

01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:24.440
Many Atari 2600 games have included a mode with simpler gameplay suitable for young children.

01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:28.640
Poodle Poops now follows in those footsteps so you can share it with your kids.

01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:30.600
Stuck in poop.

01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:33.000
Yeah, they went stuck in poop!

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.160
Isn't that funny?

01:58:35.160 --> 01:58:36.160
Yeah.

01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:37.160
More.

01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:43.480
Joggers are limited to horizontal movement, jumbo shits are easier to make, and trap joggers

01:58:43.480 --> 01:58:45.200
disappear more quickly.

01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:51.880
However, this also makes it harder to get combo bonuses, so a challenge still awaits.

01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:57.160
All four of these games can be enjoyed on normal or hard difficulty levels.

01:58:57.160 --> 01:59:00.880
And you can also try all of them in time attack mode.

01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:06.240
In this mode, you'll want to score 200 points as quickly as possible, so combo bonuses are

01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:07.520
key.

01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:11.960
There are no penalties for joggers escaping in this mode, so you can also play at whatever

01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:13.400
pace you like.

01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:18.440
The game ends when you reach the target score or quit.

01:59:18.440 --> 01:59:25.040
All told, there are four games, two difficulties, and two modes, adding up to 16 different ways

01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:29.560
to play, and every one of those will have a Steam leaderboard.

01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:32.560
There will be achievements to unlock, too.

01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:37.920
So maybe you're wondering, how much do I need to pay for this shit?

01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:42.600
Well, Pixel Poops will be free to play!

01:59:42.600 --> 01:59:45.700
But of course we're gonna do the shitty thing and try to fleece you for money once you try

01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:46.920
it.

01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:49.600
So only game one is free.

01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:53.720
You'll be able to try out the other games briefly, but to complete a full round, you'll

01:59:53.720 --> 01:59:57.360
need to fork over two dollars.

01:59:57.360 --> 02:00:00.000
Yep, two dollars.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:03.800
Everything mentioned here is yours for two dollars.

02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:04.800
But here's the thing.

02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:07.720
I want to really monetize this shit.

02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:10.200
So there's other shit for sale, too.

02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:12.160
Do you like the sound effects?

02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:19.160
Like and especially.

02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:24.240
Do you perhaps want to use them in your own projects, in your podcasts, or in your own

02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:25.240
games?

02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:29.560
Well, for another two dollars, you can have them and do whatever you like with them.

02:00:29.560 --> 02:00:32.240
Royalty free.

02:00:32.240 --> 02:00:36.520
Or maybe you're looking for more shit to play and pay for.

02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:39.060
Well, I've got you covered there.

02:00:39.060 --> 02:00:43.580
I would like to proudly introduce Pixel Poops 64.

02:00:43.580 --> 02:00:45.540
Wait, what?

02:00:45.540 --> 02:00:46.780
Were you expecting 3D?

02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:50.340
Oh, oh, you meant that other 64.

02:00:50.340 --> 02:00:54.780
I was talking about the Commodore 64!

02:00:54.780 --> 02:00:58.880
This entirely new take on Pixel Poops plays a bit differently.

02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:01.020
For one thing, there's no restaurant.

02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:06.940
Instead, you eat food off the ground, like any other self-respecting video game character.

02:01:06.940 --> 02:01:11.500
There are some other differences as well, mostly due to hardware limitations.

02:01:11.500 --> 02:01:15.880
I think you'll find it to be a refreshingly shitty new experience.

02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:22.140
And if you were wondering, yes, this is actually running on an emulated Commodore 64.

02:01:22.140 --> 02:01:26.180
The game will be distributed as a Commodore 64 disk image.

02:01:26.180 --> 02:01:31.100
You can play it on an emulator of your choice, or if you've got the right tools, you can

02:01:31.100 --> 02:01:35.540
make a disk and play it on an actual Commodore 64.

02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:37.380
And what's the damage?

02:01:37.380 --> 02:01:40.260
That's right, also $2.

02:01:40.260 --> 02:01:45.420
And now, if you tell me that you want all this shit, I'll tell you that you're fucking

02:01:45.420 --> 02:01:48.980
crazy, but also that I'll give you a discount.

02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:51.140
Five bucks gets it all.

02:01:51.140 --> 02:01:54.340
I appreciate your support very much.

02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:58.780
Whether you're looking forward to buying this or not, I'll be posting on the VoG Discord

02:01:58.780 --> 02:02:03.020
regarding playtesting opportunities, so please look forward to that.

02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:08.500
You'll be able to try it out for free before it comes out.

02:02:08.500 --> 02:02:13.780
And as far as when it's hitting the virtual water, it'll be either late December or early

02:02:13.780 --> 02:02:18.440
January, and if you keep listening to Orange Lounge Radio, you'll be the first to find

02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:20.540
out for sure.

02:02:20.540 --> 02:02:24.300
I want to thank you for watching this shitty presentation.

02:02:24.300 --> 02:02:32.240
We're about to reach its rear end, but there's just one more thing I need to show you.

02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:34.480
Let's check it out.

02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:57.920
Yeah, press the Poof button.

02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:00.100
All right, hold up.

02:04:00.100 --> 02:04:02.220
I have some questions.

02:04:02.220 --> 02:04:05.140
Hold up.

02:04:05.140 --> 02:04:11.940
First off, I just, I have to do this because that was brilliant, YYR.

02:04:11.940 --> 02:04:17.940
That was so good that I lost the...

02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:21.700
I no longer regret any of the words that have ever come out of my mouth.

02:04:21.700 --> 02:04:23.040
You don't regret any of this shit?

02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:25.040
Is that what you're saying?

02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:26.040
No.

02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:27.040
Okay.

02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:28.040
I...

02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:29.040
Yeah.

02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:30.040
Okay.

02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:37.360
So, am I understanding correctly that Bobby actually made the correct prediction apparently

02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:42.480
in chat and said this some time ago, that Loki's secret project was so secretive because

02:04:42.480 --> 02:04:45.680
it kind of like was only part his idea.

02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:49.760
So Pixel Poops number two is your game, Loki?

02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:50.760
It is my game.

02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:52.000
And so here's that.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:53.000
So here's how it started out.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:05:01.720
So I decided like a while back, like I ran across, like I wanted to make a Nintendo game.

02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:02.720
Hold up.

02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:03.720
Hold up.

02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:04.720
YYR, you get on Discord right now.

02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:06.600
I know I said the end of the show.

02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:11.680
You get on Discord right now because you didn't prepare me for that one.

02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:12.680
That's not fair.

02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:13.680
It feels like my birthday.

02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:18.200
It feels like my birthday.

02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:19.200
It is.

02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:20.200
It's your late birthday.

02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:21.200
Join any of the rooms, YYR.

02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:22.200
I'll pull you in.

02:05:22.400 --> 02:05:23.400
Okay.

02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:24.720
So he says he's updating.

02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:25.720
I'm sorry, Loki.

02:05:25.720 --> 02:05:26.720
You can continue.

02:05:26.720 --> 02:05:27.720
Okay.

02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:33.080
So like, so what it was is that I found the software like called Nest Maker, which is

02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:39.160
basically it's a kind of a front end to start making Nintendo games, like actual Nintendo

02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:40.160
games.

02:05:40.160 --> 02:05:45.920
Granted, the stuff I'm doing, there's a lot of assembly coding, so I had to learn 6502

02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:50.200
assembler to be able to start doing this, but it's kind of a friend to help you starting

02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:51.420
not from scratch.

02:05:51.420 --> 02:05:54.300
So I needed a simple project to do with this.

02:05:54.300 --> 02:06:02.980
So I thought, okay, I can remake the original Pixel Boost because it's a pretty simple game

02:06:02.980 --> 02:06:09.300
and that'll help me learn this Nest Maker stuff.

02:06:09.300 --> 02:06:11.620
But then I decided I wanted to go ahead and do a sequel.

02:06:11.620 --> 02:06:17.360
So then I like, I kept working on it and originally my plan was I was just going to put it out

02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:23.000
and say, look, I made this and then like surprise everybody, including YYR, but then I couldn't

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:24.400
like keep it a secret.

02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:28.600
So I had to show him and then he decided, Hey, he's all, Oh, well, I'm also working

02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:29.600
on this.

02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:34.360
And then we decided that we're going to kind of work together to do different things.

02:06:34.360 --> 02:06:40.400
So like I've been working on this completely separate from him, but yeah, it's, it's a

02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:41.400
Nintendo game.

02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:47.960
As you saw, it is two players simultaneously, tons of different levels in there, lots of

02:06:47.960 --> 02:06:53.040
different like themes and stuff, and it's coming along.

02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:54.040
All right.

02:06:54.040 --> 02:06:58.800
YYR is here by the way, and he's, he's audio, you're just audio only tonight cause I'm trying

02:06:58.800 --> 02:07:00.360
to fix the disc, but that's okay.

02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:03.000
If you're just going to stay audio only, then I don't need to fix it.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Yeah.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:05.000
You don't want to see me.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
I'm not wearing a shirt right now.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:08.000
Okay.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:09.000
That's fine.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Keep it off.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Keep it off.

02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:12.600
The webcam is going to look a little messed up.

02:07:12.600 --> 02:07:13.600
Sorry.

02:07:13.600 --> 02:07:14.600
During this point, let me just go back.

02:07:14.600 --> 02:07:15.600
I'll go back to here.

02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:16.600
You don't have to see me.

02:07:16.600 --> 02:07:20.480
You can look at, uh, dark soccer, the game idea and Loki, the game maker, which is the,

02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:26.200
uh, the big gag that we're all just kinda, uh, getting here is that Loki secret game.

02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:27.800
When did you find out about this YYR?

02:07:27.800 --> 02:07:30.600
So you've known about Loki secret game project for awhile.

02:07:30.600 --> 02:07:37.280
And I got, I gotta say with all respect to your game, YYR, you went for a very like kind

02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:39.240
of old school aesthetic with it.

02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:42.320
It was a very like Atari 2,600 looking thing.

02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:47.500
And then when I look at what Loki did, I'm like, this is like way different, but this

02:07:47.500 --> 02:07:53.380
is like what I would logically expect a graphical upgrade of this sort to look like, if that

02:07:53.380 --> 02:07:54.380
makes sense.

02:07:54.380 --> 02:07:55.380
Oh yeah.

02:07:55.380 --> 02:07:56.600
He really nailed the aesthetic.

02:07:56.600 --> 02:08:01.640
I the first, that was what I was going for too, yeah.

02:08:01.640 --> 02:08:03.500
And yes, Bobby, you did call it.

02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:05.880
It was right before the direct started.

02:08:05.880 --> 02:08:10.440
He was like, I bet it's actually a YYR game.

02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:12.720
And I felt I had to respond in chat.

02:08:12.720 --> 02:08:14.560
Otherwise people would get suspicious.

02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:16.120
So I was like, that's a stretch.

02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:17.120
What are you talking about?

02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:22.720
Well, and to be fair, he had kind of put that out there before when Loki wouldn't talk about

02:08:22.720 --> 02:08:24.080
it for weeks and weeks.

02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:27.600
He's like, he's not talking about it cause it's not, it's someone else's game that he's

02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:28.600
making.

02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:31.120
And I kind of like, and I honestly, I brushed it off.

02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:32.960
I was like, what, whose game would he be making?

02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:34.360
That doesn't make any sense.

02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:38.140
And now, now that I know it, it's like, Oh my God, of course that, that, that shit was

02:08:38.140 --> 02:08:40.240
right in front of my face the whole time.

02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:43.960
So amazing, amazing work YYR.

02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:47.880
So some folks in chat are saying, I need to see that trailer right now.

02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:48.880
And I've got you.

02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:50.880
I'll hook you up in just a sec.

02:08:50.880 --> 02:08:51.880
Oh, actually.

02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:52.880
Yeah.

02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:53.880
Oh, okay.

02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:54.880
I mean, I have it on YouTube.

02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:58.600
It's going to go live at midnight Eastern, 9 PM Pacific.

02:08:58.600 --> 02:09:02.920
And I will post a link if the show is not over by then I'll post a link in chat.

02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:07.840
Otherwise it'll be on my Twitter, but, uh, if, if you uploaded it also go right ahead.

02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:10.840
I just feel like this is the best Hanukkah present ever.

02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:12.340
It's seven nights of shit.

02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:15.400
I was just about to, I was about to say dark soccer.

02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:18.400
This whole thing came out of your mouth in the beginning.

02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:19.400
And how do you feel now?

02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:20.800
I know I'm already full of shit.

02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:24.800
Well, but how do you feel knowing not only is it a YYR thing, but this, this is that

02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:30.800
big mystery you're, you're going to have to buy the man a pizza.

02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:37.120
By the way, by the way, I'd like to mention that, um, it's also going to be on cartridge.

02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:38.120
I have cartridges.

02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:41.120
How are you doing that?

02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:43.600
I require this to be in my life.

02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:44.600
Yeah.

02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:48.680
So, so I have a ROM burner and I've got a cartridges or at least a few.

02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:52.540
I did a very limited run of those, but, um, I've got that.

02:09:52.540 --> 02:09:55.240
So once I'm done, I, it will be on physical cartridges.

02:09:55.240 --> 02:09:56.240
I'm sorry.

02:09:56.240 --> 02:09:57.240
I'm just going to change the shot.

02:09:57.240 --> 02:09:59.840
So you can all see how shocked I am right now.

02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:00.840
Like what?

02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:07.240
Like Loki just fucking started limited run games too in his basement for his new project.

02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:09.800
What the hell?

02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:10.800
This is crazy.

02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:16.080
But I'm not, I'm never going to be quiet again.

02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:19.000
Never the first shit that comes to my mind.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.760
You never were dark soccer.

02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:26.560
Let's and that's, that's why we love you and why this show has lasted as long as it has.

02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:27.560
So, okay.

02:10:27.560 --> 02:10:33.160
So why we are like, I'm going to be honest, the first part and everything, I kind of expected

02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:34.160
that.

02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:36.680
I was like, okay, he's talked about pixel poops going to steam before.

02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:37.680
Okay.

02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:38.840
New game modes.

02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:44.180
Super cool, but like a very Y Y R thing, like a, like a patent thing for your games.

02:10:44.180 --> 02:10:46.040
You have all these different modes.

02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:50.700
You've done that since the snake 360 day it's state snake 360 days and it's continued in

02:10:50.700 --> 02:10:52.160
things like super multitasking.

02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:55.160
It's like, you can do the multitasking all at once.

02:10:55.160 --> 02:10:57.160
You can do the multitasking very easy.

02:10:57.160 --> 02:10:59.200
You can do the multitasking with challenges, right?

02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:04.560
So like that part, I was like, okay, this is, you know, I'm with it, but now talk me

02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:09.360
through like the Commodore 64, like where the hell did that come from?

02:11:09.360 --> 02:11:15.200
Well, so, and it's funny because this, this whole thing started as, as he mentioned, Loki

02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:19.480
was working on this thing, unbeknownst to anybody, including me.

02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:21.380
And then, uh, what was that?

02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:26.320
Maybe like five, six weeks ago, you just like sent me a Twitter message and you were like,

02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:33.960
Oh, well, by the way, and, and you sent me an animated GIF and we need to talk about

02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:46.760
intellectual property for a minute, just dump it and release it and it's already dump it.

02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:55.560
But no, I, I saw that I, he got my full endorsement immediately and, um, yeah, it was like, uh,

02:11:56.320 --> 02:12:01.340
I had already been toying with the notion of remaking pixel poops and, and putting it

02:12:01.340 --> 02:12:02.340
on steam.

02:12:02.340 --> 02:12:05.280
So this just accelerated the process.

02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:09.640
I literally just dropped everything I was doing with, you know, super multitasking and

02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:10.640
anything else.

02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:13.360
I'm like, yeah, you know what, let's do this.

02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:16.640
And it, it took me a weekend to make the original game.

02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:20.600
It took me a month to port it to what I'm currently using.

02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:24.800
And I mean, granted a lot of that was because when I made it, I didn't have a daughter.

02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:31.800
Um, uh, I was also like, you know, just kind of throwing it together, not publishing it,

02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:36.320
not really planning around any of the menus or anything that I'm planning on putting in

02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:37.320
it.

02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:41.640
But yeah, it, uh, it took a lot longer to, to put that together.

02:12:41.640 --> 02:12:47.080
And uh, yeah, as far as the extra stuff, uh, I don't know if anyone noticed only people

02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:52.880
that played games on Atari VCS would notice this, um, the toggling of the difficulty and

02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:54.520
the toggling of the time attack mode.

02:12:54.520 --> 02:13:00.240
That is a direct reference to the difficulty A and difficulty B switches on the console

02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:01.240
itself.

02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:04.960
I did pick up the way you were saying that like at 16 different gate was a very much

02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:06.720
like an Atari 2600 thing.

02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:08.360
Like that would have been on the box art.

02:13:08.360 --> 02:13:15.080
In fact, I don't want to volunteer Dark Sakura for anything, but I think one way to bring

02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:19.360
this full circle there, and I don't even know if this is something that's really in your

02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:22.720
wheelhouse Dark Sakura, but no, not well, yes.

02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:29.560
That's, that's a given, but like we need classic Atari, 2,600 box art with the thing that says,

02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:33.200
you know, 16 games that might be, that might be outside your wheelhouse, dark soccer, I

02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:38.240
don't know, but we need to like commission it or something and I'm willing to do it.

02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:39.520
You know, I could do it.

02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:40.520
Okay.

02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:45.760
I mean, I'd have to break out like my color pencils and do a really fine art shit, but

02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:47.040
I just, yeah, it was great.

02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:51.280
And by the way, I lost it cause the chat is bringing up to, I lost it at that text tax

02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:53.200
collector being named feces.

02:13:53.200 --> 02:13:54.200
Feces.

02:13:54.200 --> 02:14:02.120
Now, Loki, did you know about all of the other Pixel Poop stuff or was this all new to you?

02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:05.200
Did you know about the Pixel Poop 64 where he's actually squatting?

02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:06.200
Yes.

02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:07.200
That killed me.

02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:08.200
Yes.

02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:09.200
Yes, I did.

02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:15.640
And, um, I I've actually seen the direct already, but like, um, yeah, he had told me that he

02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:18.920
was working on the Commodore 64 version and the Steam version stuff.

02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:24.000
I didn't know about like the, like enhancements or like all of the enhancements and stuff,

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:30.640
but, uh, and I hadn't actually seen the Commodore 64 version, but until today and I'll interject

02:14:30.640 --> 02:14:37.360
the Commodore version existing is a direct result of Pixel Poop's number two existing

02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:40.040
and me saying, you know what?

02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:41.560
That sounds like fun.

02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:43.080
Let me try also.

02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:49.280
And what I did was I busted out the same exact Gary kitchens game maker that I was using

02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:55.280
to make games when I was eight and nine and 10 years old and I loaded it up on an emulator

02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:57.440
and I got to work.

02:14:57.440 --> 02:14:58.440
Wow.

02:14:58.440 --> 02:14:59.660
It's awesome.

02:14:59.660 --> 02:15:04.560
It's just the fact that you're shitting on multi platforms is just killing me.

02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:06.440
It's it's amazing.

02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:07.440
Okay.

02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:12.680
I, I have to see this trailer for the Loki project one more time because I wasn't ready

02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:13.800
for it.

02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:17.400
So now I need to watch it one more time now that I have it in my mind.

02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:19.560
So I think what I can do, and I'm doing this live on the fly.

02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:20.560
Sorry guys.

02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:24.080
But I think what I can do if I actually think the movie, I think I can fast forward ahead

02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:25.080
a little bit here.

02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:33.240
So here's where, okay, the new game because I can't really go into more details about

02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:35.200
that either because that would give stuff away.

02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:51.920
So I, I can't say anything because I can't say any more.

02:15:51.920 --> 02:15:52.920
I was, I was so shocked.

02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:53.920
I wasn't even thinking of something.

02:15:53.920 --> 02:16:02.920
I like the people are actually turning around and there's two, it's a two player game.

02:16:02.920 --> 02:16:03.920
Yep.

02:16:03.920 --> 02:16:22.840
And you like a basic fresh in when they're pooping, that's my favorite I'm dying.

02:16:22.840 --> 02:16:27.720
So here's, here's, so here's my, my next question.

02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:33.520
If I don't want to play that on a Nintendo, are you doing like a steam release or something?

02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:42.680
Well, it's supposed to be DLC on the actual pixel poofs one that YR is doing.

02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:48.280
So you'll be able to, I think it's still going to be a ROM file.

02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:54.360
There is a way to convert it so that you can play it, you can actually upload it to steam.

02:16:54.360 --> 02:16:58.360
So there is a way to do that for NES ROM files.

02:16:58.360 --> 02:17:03.000
I mean, basically what it's doing is it's just including an emulator so that you double

02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:07.800
click the game in your library and it launches the NES emulator in the game automatically.

02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:09.840
All right.

02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:15.160
And Bobby, there are low key, there are a lot of people asking in chat about the cartridge.

02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:16.760
Like people are freaking out.

02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:17.760
Yeah.

02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:21.760
Like I didn't get many, like I said, cause you know, cartridges are not cheap.

02:17:21.760 --> 02:17:24.960
So I have six, Oh my God right now.

02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:29.400
But I mean, that's just because I didn't want to like go all in with like a hundred of them

02:17:29.400 --> 02:17:30.400
or something.

02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:32.520
Let me hold on a second.

02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:35.200
So how much do these cartridges run?

02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:42.840
I don't remember off the hand, I think it's like at least, I think 15 for the board and

02:17:42.840 --> 02:17:43.840
I don't remember.

02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:48.480
I'd have to look at my own voices, but basically, so like it's got, it's even got the sleeve,

02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:49.480
which is kind of cool.

02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:51.640
So these are from France.

02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:55.560
So they've got the actual, this is empty.

02:17:55.560 --> 02:17:59.880
So I actually have the boards right here.

02:17:59.880 --> 02:18:04.320
So I've got the actual, this is a mapper 30 board.

02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:08.360
It's green screening out cause it's a green board, but that's all right.

02:18:08.360 --> 02:18:09.360
It's fine.

02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:10.880
Well, it's a mapper 30 board.

02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:14.040
It's got, um, I don't know how to necessarily do it yet.

02:18:14.040 --> 02:18:18.260
Cause like I said, I'm still kind of new to the nest of stuff, but it has flash memory

02:18:18.260 --> 02:18:22.560
on it instead of member, like the old Zelda and stuff like that, where it actually had

02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:25.700
saved memory, but it had like an actual battery on it.

02:18:25.700 --> 02:18:29.120
This is flash memory now, but it operates in the same manner as that.

02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:33.640
So you could potentially, if I'm good enough to do that, um, have a high score table or

02:18:33.640 --> 02:18:34.640
something like that.

02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:35.640
Wow.

02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:38.560
I may, may try to add if I get a point to do that.

02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:44.760
Um, but the mean, you know, right now I wanted to get like the basic, so it's been a challenge

02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:49.640
obviously with the NES, cause you have to fit everything into the ROM size there.

02:18:49.640 --> 02:18:56.400
So, um, I have, well, I have an original soundtrack of three songs that I had commissioned done

02:18:56.400 --> 02:19:00.760
by this guy, cosmic gem, who does a lot of mega man fan games, as you might've noticed

02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:05.040
that sounds kind of mega man-ish in the trailer.

02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:06.660
I didn't even think about that music.

02:19:06.660 --> 02:19:09.320
I just figured you lifted it from free music archive or something.

02:19:09.320 --> 02:19:11.040
No, no, no, no.

02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:12.040
Completely original.

02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:15.040
Oh my God.

02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:19.280
We're going to be able to have like an OLR soundtrack between what Jamie does, what you

02:19:19.280 --> 02:19:20.280
do.

02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:24.880
And by the way, there's a gag coming up at about like 10 minutes when it comes to music

02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:29.240
and this show that you get, you guys know what I'm talking about, that email we got

02:19:29.240 --> 02:19:30.240
last week.

02:19:30.240 --> 02:19:35.320
And when I heard that I was like, Oh my God, this is so much talent around the OLR universe

02:19:35.320 --> 02:19:36.320
is crazy.

02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:38.000
So there is one song.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:42.240
So there there's three songs, the title song and two levels songs that commission from

02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:47.000
somebody that to do those, um, you already have a more diverse soundtrack than dragon

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:48.000
quest 11.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:49.960
Good job.

02:19:49.960 --> 02:19:52.520
And then there is another song that was one of those.

02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:55.220
It was on, uh, the open game art sites.

02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:58.780
So it's a, it's a, uh, creative commons, but it's another song.

02:19:58.780 --> 02:20:03.560
So that's, that's all I could fit in my audio because like I had to create, you know, sound

02:20:03.560 --> 02:20:05.360
effects for all the poop sound effects.

02:20:05.360 --> 02:20:07.780
So some of the fun things that are in the game.

02:20:07.780 --> 02:20:11.800
So like for example, the pause screen, you can still move your character or you can move

02:20:11.800 --> 02:20:15.640
your characters in place so you can actually like dance around and stuff like that.

02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:17.040
And the pause screen is just kind of fun.

02:20:17.040 --> 02:20:21.840
And then at the end of when you beat a level, you actually goes into this little celebration

02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:26.240
animation, but you can also move around and then do like the, the funny squatting things.

02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:27.240
Cause I love that face.

02:20:27.240 --> 02:20:31.160
The face is hilarious and it's just funny to do that.

02:20:31.160 --> 02:20:36.920
So, um, yeah, there's lots of little Easter eggs.

02:20:36.920 --> 02:20:39.800
I may have thrown some cheat codes in there as well.

02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:40.800
Oh my God.

02:20:40.800 --> 02:20:41.800
Okay.

02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:42.800
I'm sorry.

02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:47.480
This is running so long, but like y'all blindsided me with this and her.

02:20:47.480 --> 02:20:51.320
Now I understand why I got that message from YYR that was like, you're probably gonna want

02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:56.560
to talk to me right after errors, like for two bucks a pop, by the way.

02:20:56.560 --> 02:20:57.560
Oh my gosh.

02:20:57.560 --> 02:20:58.560
All right.

02:20:58.560 --> 02:21:03.000
So anyway, w the cartridge thing, Loki, you'll have to figure that out on your own.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:08.560
Obviously I was thinking it was, I have to look, but I was trying to target someone cause

02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:12.360
I also still have to do label printing and all that and packaging.

02:21:12.360 --> 02:21:15.360
So I was targeting somewhere around 40 bucks, but I don't know.

02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:16.360
Yeah.

02:21:16.360 --> 02:21:20.260
I have to, there's easily at least five people in chat that are going to pay that right now.

02:21:20.260 --> 02:21:26.140
If not, if not more than that person sitting in this chair who will, I would say, go ahead,

02:21:26.140 --> 02:21:27.140
open pre-orders.

02:21:27.140 --> 02:21:31.060
I mean, get a number so that you know how many you need to be fair.

02:21:31.060 --> 02:21:33.700
He says he hasn't completed the, I love how we're just talking.

02:21:33.700 --> 02:21:34.700
Now.

02:21:34.700 --> 02:21:35.700
We're all your managers, Loki.

02:21:35.700 --> 02:21:36.700
All right.

02:21:36.700 --> 02:21:40.080
So he says he hasn't completed the process yet and hasn't done it.

02:21:40.080 --> 02:21:43.960
So let him get through that whole process to make sure it's, you know, error free and

02:21:43.960 --> 02:21:46.220
he has it the way he likes it.

02:21:46.220 --> 02:21:49.420
Then open up the pre-orders cause you don't want to end up on that Kickstarter thing where

02:21:49.420 --> 02:21:53.340
you're like, I'm going to get all this money for this thing that I fucked up and I can't

02:21:53.340 --> 02:21:54.340
make it.

02:21:54.340 --> 02:21:55.340
So exactly.

02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:58.860
And as Bobby puts out, let, let me make one exactly.

02:21:58.860 --> 02:22:00.620
And that's definitely the goal.

02:22:00.620 --> 02:22:03.980
I still have to learn the, how to do, I've got all the hardware to do.

02:22:03.980 --> 02:22:08.060
I just have to learn the process and it's the, what's great though is like, if you are

02:22:08.060 --> 02:22:14.680
interested in this software, so nest maker is, um, what I, I started off using granted.

02:22:14.680 --> 02:22:17.760
You can build an NES game without coding.

02:22:17.760 --> 02:22:22.200
If you want a grant, it's going to be incredibly basic, but you could do that.

02:22:22.200 --> 02:22:23.720
Um, and I highly recommend it.

02:22:23.720 --> 02:22:25.720
It's like 40 bucks for the software.

02:22:25.720 --> 02:22:30.000
Granted the stuff I'm doing now I'm completely, there's not a lot of documentation.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:34.200
They do a good job with like some tutorial videos, but it's a lot of intro stuff, like

02:22:34.200 --> 02:22:35.480
really beginner things.

02:22:35.480 --> 02:22:39.700
So a lot of stuff I'm having to learn on the fly and figure out how this stuff works.

02:22:39.700 --> 02:22:43.660
So I'm like rewriting a lot of their like input systems and stuff like that.

02:22:43.660 --> 02:22:48.580
So you can get and do some pretty complicated things out there, but like it is definitely

02:22:48.580 --> 02:22:50.540
a fun tool to play around with.

02:22:50.540 --> 02:22:55.460
Uh, so if you go to the new eight bit heroes, uh, dot com, they sell and that's maker there.

02:22:55.460 --> 02:23:00.000
There's a link to, you can get started with like the actual hardware, like burning a cart.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:04.980
I did my first cart through there, um, cause it came with the actual writer.

02:23:04.980 --> 02:23:10.260
Um, but then the other like five additional ones I tried through this French site, um,

02:23:10.260 --> 02:23:11.260
that just opened up.

02:23:11.260 --> 02:23:18.340
So, um, but I, like I said, I, I'd have to price it out, but, um, yeah, I highly recommend

02:23:18.340 --> 02:23:19.340
checking it out.

02:23:19.340 --> 02:23:20.340
It's a lot of fun.

02:23:20.340 --> 02:23:22.260
I mean, I've had a lot of fun putting it together.

02:23:22.260 --> 02:23:23.820
Um, definitely.

02:23:23.820 --> 02:23:28.980
I'm finally glad I can talk about it now, no progress, cause it's like, I was like,

02:23:28.980 --> 02:23:30.660
I need to tell somebody.

02:23:30.660 --> 02:23:34.900
Um, but yeah, it's, it's been ongoing.

02:23:34.900 --> 02:23:38.220
Like um, was it this, uh, why we are seeing you earlier?

02:23:38.220 --> 02:23:41.980
He's like, yeah, I don't like, you know, the direction thing's not working well.

02:23:41.980 --> 02:23:43.660
He needs to move diagonal and stuff like that.

02:23:43.660 --> 02:23:48.740
So I have to rewrite the input system to allow that, but I finally learned how to do that.

02:23:48.740 --> 02:23:49.740
It's all assembly.

02:23:49.740 --> 02:23:57.780
Like I've never programmed in assembly before, but yeah, it's, and it's just a lot of challenges

02:23:57.780 --> 02:24:00.020
cramming it all in that ROM size.

02:24:00.020 --> 02:24:01.020
Cramming all that shit in there.

02:24:01.020 --> 02:24:03.020
Um, did that a documentary?

02:24:03.020 --> 02:24:04.020
Yeah.

02:24:04.020 --> 02:24:05.160
Yeah, it is.

02:24:05.160 --> 02:24:07.380
So yeah, mystic searches is his game that he's got.

02:24:07.380 --> 02:24:08.380
He did a documentary.

02:24:08.380 --> 02:24:09.380
It's on Amazon.

02:24:09.380 --> 02:24:13.260
Um, great community on their Etsy too.

02:24:13.260 --> 02:24:14.260
Yeah.

02:24:14.260 --> 02:24:15.260
Yeah.

02:24:15.260 --> 02:24:16.260
It's a, it's a great community.

02:24:16.260 --> 02:24:20.340
There's lots of nest maker games out there that people, then there's some guys, um, like

02:24:20.340 --> 02:24:25.400
there's a cutter cross on there that they have some really like crazy games that they've

02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:26.400
made with it.

02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:28.220
Like there's one they're doing right now.

02:24:28.220 --> 02:24:33.100
It's a point and click adventure game and they've actually gotten, I don't know how

02:24:33.100 --> 02:24:38.380
they did it, but they've gotten the, the super NES Mario paint mouse to work with it

02:24:38.380 --> 02:24:39.380
on an NES.

02:24:39.380 --> 02:24:40.380
I don't know.

02:24:40.380 --> 02:24:45.540
It's just some crazy stuff, but like the whole, you know, nest dev seems pretty cool.

02:24:45.540 --> 02:24:52.220
Um, so definitely go check it out, but, um, yeah, it's, I'm definitely excited about it.

02:24:52.220 --> 02:24:53.540
I'm still working on it.

02:24:53.540 --> 02:24:56.220
I'm trying to get it done this year.

02:24:56.220 --> 02:24:58.540
Um, I'm shooting for this year.

02:24:58.540 --> 02:25:01.780
You know, something I was going to say, like, you know, and you've been talking about, oh,

02:25:01.780 --> 02:25:03.060
I finally got the playable loop.

02:25:03.060 --> 02:25:04.060
I've got all this.

02:25:04.060 --> 02:25:08.100
And when I look at that footage, I'm like, oh my God, this really is like done.

02:25:08.100 --> 02:25:13.180
Like this isn't like the time to car thing where you, it was not really like, like you

02:25:13.180 --> 02:25:16.020
had an idea there, but it wasn't like really fleshed out.

02:25:16.020 --> 02:25:17.060
And I'm looking at it.

02:25:17.060 --> 02:25:22.160
I'm looking at this and I'm like, this is, this is ready.

02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:25.180
It's because I did it the right way this time.

02:25:25.180 --> 02:25:26.180
I did.

02:25:26.180 --> 02:25:27.180
Yay.

02:25:27.180 --> 02:25:28.180
Good job.

02:25:28.180 --> 02:25:35.780
And you, you could say, see, Bobby's been yelling at you for, since day one, you need

02:25:35.780 --> 02:25:41.020
to make a game based on an existing game.

02:25:41.020 --> 02:25:44.500
So we're like trying to figure out the storyline for this game.

02:25:44.500 --> 02:25:48.540
I still haven't quite figured that out and I get it, but like, there's not really a story

02:25:48.540 --> 02:25:54.460
to it, but like, like we've, I've run across like so many like dumb ideas and I'm definitely

02:25:54.460 --> 02:25:58.380
going to go with the dumbest of them whenever I figure out what that is.

02:25:58.380 --> 02:26:03.660
It's just like, like, oh yeah, you know, one of them was like something about like that,

02:26:03.660 --> 02:26:07.540
the taco stands were actually like, they've taken over the world.

02:26:07.540 --> 02:26:08.700
There's so many of them.

02:26:08.700 --> 02:26:14.180
That's why you see in like one of the then the trailer there, there's one in a graveyard,

02:26:14.180 --> 02:26:16.380
you know, there's, there's your taco stands.

02:26:16.380 --> 02:26:20.020
Like they actually have to be the Crips.

02:26:20.020 --> 02:26:21.940
So it's just ridiculous stuff like that.

02:26:21.940 --> 02:26:23.700
And yeah, there's like different characters.

02:26:23.740 --> 02:26:25.500
So like there's the ghost you saw there.

02:26:25.500 --> 02:26:28.940
I don't have an infant mind yet, but it's going to disappear.

02:26:28.940 --> 02:26:33.460
And so it'll be invisible and you have to like a capture or I'm going to, I started

02:26:33.460 --> 02:26:44.220
doing like a dog that actually eats the smaller pieces of, so like, you know, strange stuff

02:26:44.220 --> 02:26:45.220
like that.

02:26:45.220 --> 02:26:49.140
But yeah, it's, I, like I said, the segment has gone on a very long time, but I'm sorry.

02:26:49.140 --> 02:26:56.020
I'm blown away because I just did not realize that you two were going to essentially buddy

02:26:56.020 --> 02:27:00.820
up in a way and really deliver on this idea.

02:27:00.820 --> 02:27:03.420
And of course not to, I know we're really focusing on Loki's game, but that's because

02:27:03.420 --> 02:27:07.000
that's been a central plot of this show for like the past year.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:12.180
So to have it just, you know, subtly revealed as a one more thing here is, is I wasn't prepared

02:27:12.180 --> 02:27:13.180
for that.

02:27:13.180 --> 02:27:14.180
Thank you.

02:27:14.180 --> 02:27:17.300
But certainly not to overshadow what you're doing on your own to YYR is that, you know,

02:27:17.300 --> 02:27:20.620
again, the Commodore 64, you've got the sound effects in there.

02:27:20.620 --> 02:27:23.820
You're still charging, not nearly enough money for it.

02:27:23.820 --> 02:27:27.420
And the world is going to thank you for it.

02:27:27.420 --> 02:27:29.100
This is, this is great.

02:27:29.100 --> 02:27:36.020
I, you know, I, it's, this is funny because, uh, it's dark soccer's idea.

02:27:36.020 --> 02:27:39.700
YYR made the game, Loki made the new game.

02:27:39.700 --> 02:27:43.740
I did literally nothing on this.

02:27:43.740 --> 02:27:45.580
I still promoted.

02:27:45.580 --> 02:27:46.580
I guess so.

02:27:46.580 --> 02:27:50.340
I still feel like there's a part of me.

02:27:50.340 --> 02:27:59.620
That's so excited about like, I had a hand in this somehow.

02:27:59.620 --> 02:28:00.620
I did.

02:28:00.620 --> 02:28:01.620
I had a hand in this somehow.

02:28:01.620 --> 02:28:05.860
So there's, and Bobby Blackwell says I had nothing to do with this, but you were the,

02:28:05.860 --> 02:28:07.460
you were the first to figure it out.

02:28:07.460 --> 02:28:09.380
So you, you know, it's true.

02:28:09.380 --> 02:28:10.380
So anyway.

02:28:10.380 --> 02:28:11.380
Okay.

02:28:11.380 --> 02:28:14.820
I've got to try and move on with the show, obviously says that you had shit to do with

02:28:14.820 --> 02:28:15.820
it.

02:28:16.060 --> 02:28:20.420
Well, obviously we're going to hear more about this in the coming months or really weeks,

02:28:20.420 --> 02:28:26.380
because, uh, you said, I know you said December or January let's set the expectation January.

02:28:26.380 --> 02:28:32.620
I think in order for it to release in December, it would have had to be out before the winter

02:28:32.620 --> 02:28:33.620
sale.

02:28:33.620 --> 02:28:38.740
And like, since, since you have to have the store page completely finished, including

02:28:38.740 --> 02:28:43.500
the trailers, the screenshots, all the texts, everything, and then it has to be in coming

02:28:43.500 --> 02:28:48.020
soon status for two weeks before the game comes out, I would literally have to have

02:28:48.020 --> 02:28:49.020
everything ready.

02:28:49.020 --> 02:28:53.740
And I think two days, it's just not going to happen.

02:28:53.740 --> 02:28:56.740
So it's January.

02:28:56.740 --> 02:29:02.980
And by the way, I have no problem taking a back seat to, I, I was just as blown away

02:29:02.980 --> 02:29:07.100
by what Loki has been doing as anybody else.

02:29:07.100 --> 02:29:09.300
I it's amazing.

02:29:09.300 --> 02:29:12.700
And the graphics are fantastic and the music is great.

02:29:12.700 --> 02:29:16.700
And I can't wait to, well, I have played it in the early version, but I can't wait to

02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:19.140
play the final full thing.

02:29:19.140 --> 02:29:20.180
And it's awesome.

02:29:20.180 --> 02:29:22.820
And I'm honored to be able to publish it.

02:29:22.820 --> 02:29:27.180
He couldn't have done it without you and you couldn't have done it without her.

02:29:27.180 --> 02:29:31.800
So, and I'm just sitting here real happy right now, cause this is all awesome.

02:29:31.800 --> 02:29:35.860
Like I'm just, I, I feel like I'm on ground, the starting ground of this whole thing.

02:29:35.860 --> 02:29:40.220
And I'm just like, I, and people in chat are talking about, they need to speed read that

02:29:40.220 --> 02:29:42.420
at awesome games done quick.

02:29:42.420 --> 02:29:44.880
It's a perfect candidate for the awful games block.

02:29:44.880 --> 02:29:45.880
But we mean that with love.

02:29:45.880 --> 02:29:50.020
The thing is, I don't think it's an awful game, but it would fit in with the Cuso Grande.

02:29:50.020 --> 02:29:59.900
Well, look, if Loki, if Cuso means shit, Loki, YYR, if that game shows up in the awful games

02:29:59.900 --> 02:30:03.520
done quick compliment or insult.

02:30:03.520 --> 02:30:04.520
I would be happy.

02:30:04.520 --> 02:30:05.520
I don't care.

02:30:05.520 --> 02:30:06.520
That's what I thought.

02:30:06.520 --> 02:30:09.380
No publicity is bad publicity.

02:30:09.380 --> 02:30:10.380
Exactly.

02:30:11.380 --> 02:30:15.700
I, I'm, I'd be happy that that shit would be getting out in front of more eyeballs and

02:30:15.700 --> 02:30:18.340
Bob Bobby's volunteer to host it.

02:30:18.340 --> 02:30:21.580
So now I really, then I better be the one to speed run it.

02:30:21.580 --> 02:30:22.580
All right.

02:30:25.740 --> 02:30:27.900
I guess I have a new purpose in life.

02:30:27.900 --> 02:30:28.900
Oh my gosh.

02:30:28.900 --> 02:30:29.900
All right.

02:30:29.900 --> 02:30:31.940
Well, we're going to be hearing more and more about this in the coming weeks.

02:30:31.940 --> 02:30:34.300
Cause now look, he gets to openly talk about the project.

02:30:34.300 --> 02:30:36.980
So, and he's talked about some of the things that still need to be done there.

02:30:36.980 --> 02:30:39.900
YYR, please keep us posted for the release date on Steam.

02:30:39.900 --> 02:30:42.820
We're going to do all we can to help you out.

02:30:42.820 --> 02:30:46.620
Please try to, and, and I will help you get into contact with some other podcasts too.

02:30:46.620 --> 02:30:48.620
If you need it, try to get the word out.

02:30:48.620 --> 02:30:53.700
Your games are so fucking good and they deserve to be discovered.

02:30:53.700 --> 02:30:56.940
The success that these indie studios are having, you deserve it as well.

02:30:56.940 --> 02:30:58.580
And this isn't just with the poopy thing.

02:30:58.580 --> 02:31:02.700
This is what super multitasking and all the brilliant things you've done.

02:31:02.700 --> 02:31:04.020
I really hope for the best for you.

02:31:04.020 --> 02:31:05.020
I really do.

02:31:05.020 --> 02:31:06.020
Thank you.

02:31:06.060 --> 02:31:07.060
That's a lot.

02:31:07.060 --> 02:31:08.060
Well, it's, it's well-deserved.

02:31:08.060 --> 02:31:09.060
It's awesome.

02:31:09.060 --> 02:31:10.060
Yeah.

02:31:10.060 --> 02:31:11.060
You're awesome sauce.

02:31:11.060 --> 02:31:12.060
Thanks so much.

02:31:12.060 --> 02:31:13.060
All right.

02:31:13.060 --> 02:31:17.140
Well, I couldn't have done it without all of you.

02:31:17.140 --> 02:31:18.140
Even me?

02:31:18.140 --> 02:31:19.140
Yes.

02:31:19.140 --> 02:31:20.140
Even you Rob.

02:31:20.140 --> 02:31:21.140
Even me.

02:31:21.140 --> 02:31:22.140
All right.

02:31:22.140 --> 02:31:23.140
All right.

02:31:23.140 --> 02:31:24.140
Well, thank you so much.

02:31:24.140 --> 02:31:25.140
Okay.

02:31:25.140 --> 02:31:26.140
I'm going to let you go.

02:31:26.140 --> 02:31:27.140
We're going to hear from you in the coming weeks.

02:31:27.140 --> 02:31:28.140
You'll be back when the game's ready to release.

02:31:28.140 --> 02:31:32.140
When you, when you're ready to do your big dump on Steam.

02:31:32.140 --> 02:31:33.420
These jokes are never going to get old.

02:31:33.420 --> 02:31:34.420
We're 40.

02:31:34.420 --> 02:31:37.100
I'm in my four all in our forties at this point.

02:31:37.100 --> 02:31:38.820
And these jokes are not getting old.

02:31:38.820 --> 02:31:40.820
So there you go.

02:31:40.820 --> 02:31:41.820
All right.

02:31:41.820 --> 02:31:42.820
Take care, buddy.

02:31:42.820 --> 02:31:43.820
I'm going to move back to one of the other channels.

02:31:43.820 --> 02:31:44.820
Have a good one.

02:31:44.820 --> 02:31:45.820
Yup.

02:31:45.820 --> 02:31:46.820
Bye.

02:31:46.820 --> 02:31:50.260
Does anyone actually have a clip of me talking about the pixel shit?

02:31:50.260 --> 02:31:55.620
Because I really don't remember why, why are the first trailer video?

02:31:55.620 --> 02:31:56.620
Yeah.

02:31:56.620 --> 02:31:58.420
I think the original video had it.

02:31:58.420 --> 02:31:59.420
Yeah.

02:31:59.420 --> 02:32:06.380
I'm, I'm like crying from like laughing, but also just like the shock of, of the Loki's

02:32:06.380 --> 02:32:08.260
game was that.

02:32:08.260 --> 02:32:09.260
But it makes so much sense.

02:32:09.260 --> 02:32:16.540
I went from having a really terrible morning with a very hard emotional blow to now riding

02:32:16.540 --> 02:32:18.820
this weird high.

02:32:18.820 --> 02:32:20.300
Some sort of in between.

02:32:20.300 --> 02:32:23.580
I don't, my, my brain's confused on feelings.

02:32:23.580 --> 02:32:24.980
I know it's good.

02:32:24.980 --> 02:32:30.300
It's this weird thing where this show has truly come full circle.

02:32:30.300 --> 02:32:35.760
You know, like we started like talking about gay, I'm talking like it's the last episode.

02:32:35.760 --> 02:32:43.220
It's not, but yes, it's one of the things we've, we've looped the loop because now the,

02:32:43.220 --> 02:32:44.220
this really is.

02:32:44.220 --> 02:32:49.300
And what Loki's doing here, this product, I mean, it's one thing when it was YYR's thing,

02:32:49.300 --> 02:32:54.460
because, oh, he's, he's, he's like a listener and he's, he's like outside the bubble, so

02:32:54.460 --> 02:32:55.460
to speak.

02:32:55.460 --> 02:32:59.820
And he's putting out this product and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, but now Loki's a part

02:32:59.820 --> 02:33:00.820
of that too.

02:33:00.820 --> 02:33:06.140
Who's been here since day one on OLR and, and it's like now the show that talks about

02:33:06.140 --> 02:33:09.640
games has essentially in a way produced a game.

02:33:09.640 --> 02:33:14.700
And again, even though I'm the one uploading the MP3s every week, I had nothing to do with

02:33:14.700 --> 02:33:17.140
this.

02:33:17.140 --> 02:33:22.300
And it feels really good.

02:33:22.300 --> 02:33:23.820
I just get to play it.

02:33:23.820 --> 02:33:24.820
That's true.

02:33:24.820 --> 02:33:26.140
Bobby says, Loki hasn't finished it yet.

02:33:26.140 --> 02:33:27.140
That's right.

02:33:27.140 --> 02:33:28.140
We got to give you time.

02:33:28.140 --> 02:33:31.600
The last 10% is the longest 90% or something like that, right?

02:33:31.600 --> 02:33:32.600
So it's content.

02:33:32.600 --> 02:33:33.600
Yeah.

02:33:33.600 --> 02:33:35.100
I have to add all the content.

02:33:35.100 --> 02:33:40.680
That's where I had to like rush to get multiple levels because it was just, well, the first

02:33:40.680 --> 02:33:45.300
level is actually the third level now, but, uh, it's just over and over and over.

02:33:45.300 --> 02:33:50.000
I, I should really, you guys should see like some of the actual things cause like before

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:56.660
each like actual, cause there's worlds technically, um, has like a little like image and stuff.

02:33:56.660 --> 02:33:58.220
And it's, Oh, that's kind of funny.

02:33:58.220 --> 02:33:59.220
Some of that.

02:33:59.220 --> 02:34:00.220
Okay.

02:34:00.220 --> 02:34:02.100
I have one more question and then we got to, we really have to move on with the show cause

02:34:02.100 --> 02:34:03.100
it's almost nine o'clock.

02:34:03.100 --> 02:34:05.140
We're going to have to kind of rapid fire the rest of the show.

02:34:05.140 --> 02:34:12.100
But my question for Loki is, did the music guy know what he was making music for?

02:34:12.100 --> 02:34:13.980
Yes, he did.

02:34:13.980 --> 02:34:14.980
He did.

02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:19.500
I, he, he, he was just cool with it.

02:34:19.500 --> 02:34:23.060
Um, like I told him exactly, I gave him a description of what it was.

02:34:23.060 --> 02:34:25.180
I showed him YYRs game.

02:34:25.180 --> 02:34:31.620
I had already like some of the graphics and everything done or actually, uh, the, the

02:34:31.620 --> 02:34:35.500
animated GIF I sent to YYR, I sent to that guy as well.

02:34:35.500 --> 02:34:38.380
So he well aware of what he was making.

02:34:38.380 --> 02:34:39.380
Wow.

02:34:39.380 --> 02:34:44.840
Um, and funny enough, like I actually, that was an investment bringing him in and a smart

02:34:44.840 --> 02:34:48.600
one because I think that's going to, I think just the music alone there, like YYR said

02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:50.880
is like music is fantastic.

02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:57.560
The music is literally good listening to it in my car every day, like every day been listening

02:34:57.560 --> 02:34:58.560
to it in my car.

02:34:58.560 --> 02:35:02.360
And like the theme, because the song that played is just one, that's the first level

02:35:02.360 --> 02:35:03.360
theme.

02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:06.920
So the, the actual theme song is its own thing too.

02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:12.080
And then the second level theme, I haven't actually, um, put in a level yet.

02:35:12.080 --> 02:35:15.640
I'm thinking like a snow level, but, uh, it's all good.

02:35:15.640 --> 02:35:16.640
All of it.

02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:17.640
Frozen shit.

02:35:17.640 --> 02:35:18.640
Brown snow.

02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:19.640
It's just going to be slippery.

02:35:19.640 --> 02:35:24.960
Um, so all of it is going to be just, it's such a good soundtrack.

02:35:24.960 --> 02:35:28.560
I'm excited.

02:35:28.560 --> 02:35:29.920
Kudos to both of you.

02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:34.720
I'm, you know, obviously I'm going to buy anything YYR makes because he's, he doesn't

02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:39.180
charge enough for it and they're always, you know, so, so good, but just knowing that now

02:35:39.180 --> 02:35:42.460
you've like evolved it, I think is a good word for it.

02:35:42.460 --> 02:35:44.940
I don't want to, I don't want to say elevated.

02:35:44.940 --> 02:35:49.700
I would say like evolved, I think is a good word and like made it like a very, you took

02:35:49.700 --> 02:35:51.460
a very dark soccer idea.

02:35:51.460 --> 02:35:58.100
You took a YYR execution and then you somehow made these a Loki thing is with, with professional

02:35:58.100 --> 02:36:00.900
help where you needed it, like with the music and things like that.

02:36:00.900 --> 02:36:03.620
And maybe areas that weren't your comfort zone.

02:36:03.620 --> 02:36:07.660
I tried, I've learned enough of, I learned enough of Famitrack because that's the thing

02:36:07.660 --> 02:36:08.780
about Nest Maker too.

02:36:08.780 --> 02:36:14.740
Like Nest Maker has its quirks cause it uses this a library called like GG sound or something

02:36:14.740 --> 02:36:15.740
like that.

02:36:15.740 --> 02:36:19.140
And it has, it's very quirky on how it works with audio.

02:36:19.140 --> 02:36:25.300
So I had to fix a lot of things in like so it was, that was a complicated process just

02:36:25.300 --> 02:36:29.980
to get the music in there and trying to cram it within the ROM size because those songs

02:36:29.980 --> 02:36:33.980
are very complicated and they take up a lot of space.

02:36:33.980 --> 02:36:36.420
So I was like, I need more music other than these three songs.

02:36:36.420 --> 02:36:43.300
I was like, okay, I got to cram like a song in there and it was tricky, but I did manage

02:36:43.300 --> 02:36:46.980
to get one more song in there and that's about all I can fit without bank switching.

02:36:46.980 --> 02:36:50.500
And I don't really know how to do that very well.

02:36:50.500 --> 02:36:51.500
All right.

02:36:51.500 --> 02:36:55.620
Well, to be continued, this is just the beginning of the saga, I'm sure that's been ongoing

02:36:55.620 --> 02:36:56.620
on the show.

02:36:56.620 --> 02:36:59.980
And that's why I'm spending so much time on it because you know, this has been a product

02:36:59.980 --> 02:37:01.580
you've been talking about for a long time.

02:37:01.580 --> 02:37:07.420
And I, I just, again, it's the, the answer was so obvious and right in front of our face,

02:37:07.420 --> 02:37:13.260
but I just, ah, the Loki's got the Loki hat came up with some crazy idea and you did.

02:37:13.260 --> 02:37:16.700
And it's, it's, yeah, it's great.

02:37:16.700 --> 02:37:17.700
Love seeing it.

02:37:17.700 --> 02:37:18.700
So excited to play it.

02:37:18.700 --> 02:37:21.700
So excited to become the world record speed runner.

02:37:21.700 --> 02:37:22.700
In the game.

02:37:22.700 --> 02:37:28.220
Here's, I'll finish it off with the last bit and I don't know if you noticed, but because

02:37:28.220 --> 02:37:33.860
your character is pooping a lot, I don't know if you noticed, but the character, when he

02:37:33.860 --> 02:37:40.520
runs up on the screen, you'll notice that there is a hole cut out of the backside where

02:37:40.520 --> 02:37:41.780
it would be coming out.

02:37:41.780 --> 02:37:45.900
Cause obviously obviously you can't go through your clothes.

02:37:45.900 --> 02:37:53.380
So it's the fine details like that.

02:37:53.380 --> 02:37:54.640
We know what he's doing.

02:37:54.640 --> 02:37:57.520
He's accidentally.

02:37:57.520 --> 02:38:03.320
So I just next on your next rewatch of the trailer, be sure to look for that.

02:38:03.320 --> 02:38:04.320
Hold on.

02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:05.320
I'm sorry.

02:38:05.320 --> 02:38:09.320
If it goes till 10 o'clock tonight, I'm not apologizing because we're going to get these

02:38:09.320 --> 02:38:10.320
answers.

02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:14.960
You're fucking crazy as far as when it's hitting the road.

02:38:14.960 --> 02:38:15.960
I'm sorry.

02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:16.960
I'm sorry.

02:38:16.960 --> 02:38:34.160
Just on the back.

02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:36.640
He's either ready for a hot date or a lot of poop.

02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:38.640
I can't stop crying.

02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:39.640
Okay.

02:38:39.640 --> 02:38:42.640
All right.

02:38:42.640 --> 02:38:43.640
Let's try to get over there.

02:38:43.640 --> 02:38:45.560
We're going to rapid fire the rest of the show here and try to get through.

02:38:45.560 --> 02:38:46.560
Oh my God.

02:38:47.160 --> 02:38:48.160
Another big thing we got to talk about.

02:38:48.160 --> 02:38:49.160
Oh my God.

02:38:49.160 --> 02:38:50.160
We got to.

02:38:50.160 --> 02:38:51.160
Okay.

02:38:51.160 --> 02:38:52.160
Let's get to it.

02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:53.160
Rapid fire news.

02:38:53.160 --> 02:38:54.160
Low key.

02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:55.160
Mario Kart's getting it.

02:38:55.160 --> 02:38:56.160
Arcade's getting a mode with infinite shells.

02:38:56.160 --> 02:38:57.560
That's kind of crazy.

02:38:57.560 --> 02:39:00.640
So that's going to be something that they're going to be patching into Mario Kart arcade

02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:04.580
grand Prix DX this week coming December 10th.

02:39:04.580 --> 02:39:10.360
So if you can find someplace that's not under quarantine, you can go check it out.

02:39:10.360 --> 02:39:14.380
And then also it looks like the doom guy is going to be coming to fall guys soon.

02:39:14.380 --> 02:39:16.480
So that's pretty cool.

02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:19.280
I'm guessing part of the next season.

02:39:19.280 --> 02:39:20.280
All right.

02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:21.280
Also coming up.

02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:23.900
Pax is planning the events for next year.

02:39:23.900 --> 02:39:27.720
And I know that might seem a little bold when we're still in a pandemic, but with the vaccine

02:39:27.720 --> 02:39:31.420
on the way, there are folks that are really hoping we might be able to get back to some

02:39:31.420 --> 02:39:35.500
of that convention spirit who knows next summer, at least that's what they've announced for

02:39:35.500 --> 02:39:37.060
the next Pax East.

02:39:37.060 --> 02:39:41.060
This is notable because Pax East is normally around like the March, April timeframe.

02:39:41.060 --> 02:39:42.620
I think one year it was in February.

02:39:42.620 --> 02:39:43.620
I'm sorry, guys.

02:39:43.860 --> 02:39:47.820
I haven't been to Pax East in a few years, so I forget the exact days and timeframe,

02:39:47.820 --> 02:39:48.820
but it is interesting.

02:39:48.820 --> 02:39:52.220
They are bumping it back to June so they can hopefully actually have it.

02:39:52.220 --> 02:39:53.300
I think there's a lot of hope.

02:39:53.300 --> 02:39:56.860
And you know, when you listen to some things in the government, there's the when I'm talking

02:39:56.860 --> 02:40:03.260
like Dr. Fauci and you know, those folks that care about COVID actually say that we could

02:40:03.260 --> 02:40:05.260
see a sense of normalcy by May or June.

02:40:05.260 --> 02:40:06.580
I hope we are.

02:40:06.580 --> 02:40:07.580
That is very true.

02:40:07.580 --> 02:40:11.640
And we can have a Pax East June 3rd through 6th in Boston, but they are going out of their

02:40:11.680 --> 02:40:16.160
way to say, if it's not safe, we're not doing it.

02:40:16.160 --> 02:40:17.160
We're only going to do it.

02:40:17.160 --> 02:40:19.760
But they want to kind of let people clear their calendars for that.

02:40:19.760 --> 02:40:21.520
So that's pretty cool.

02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:27.000
September 3rd through the 6th in Seattle, although obviously us here at VOG Network,

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.120
we tend to go to Dragon Con instead.

02:40:29.120 --> 02:40:32.840
But if you are in the Seattle area, hey, cool, you can go to that.

02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:37.160
And then Pax Unplugged will be back in Philadelphia in December.

02:40:37.160 --> 02:40:41.540
They will not be having a Pax South in 2021.

02:40:41.540 --> 02:40:45.100
This is just because they had to move the other things around.

02:40:45.100 --> 02:40:47.420
They're looking to bring that back in 2022.

02:40:47.420 --> 02:40:49.100
So you know, fingers and toes crossed.

02:40:49.100 --> 02:40:57.640
I'm trying not to get too hopeful, but hey, if Dr. Fauci and the other doctors of the

02:40:57.640 --> 02:41:01.100
world out there say, take the vaccine, you know what I'm going to do, I'm going to take

02:41:01.100 --> 02:41:02.100
the vaccine.

02:41:02.100 --> 02:41:07.240
So let's hope it helps.

02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:10.320
Other things to look forward to, WATAM.

02:41:10.320 --> 02:41:12.720
This is the game from the Katamari Damacy creator.

02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:16.480
It was an Epic exclusive when it originally came out on PC.

02:41:16.480 --> 02:41:22.720
But now Keita Takahashi's game WATAM will now be out on Steam as of December 18th.

02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:28.560
And that's about a year after it originally debuted on the Epic Game Store.

02:41:28.560 --> 02:41:31.000
So I don't know if Dark Soccer, you ever got a chance to play that game.

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:32.000
I never did.

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:33.720
I somehow always missed it.

02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:37.620
But I'll be checking that out probably when it makes its way to Steam, since I'm going

02:41:37.620 --> 02:41:40.500
to be using Steam to play all these new games that were announced tonight.

02:41:40.500 --> 02:41:41.500
That's for sure.

02:41:41.500 --> 02:41:44.860
Dark Soccer, what do you have for Rapid Fire News?

02:41:44.860 --> 02:41:52.020
I, King of Fighters 15 had a trailer drop with Shunai being the main character coming

02:41:52.020 --> 02:41:53.020
through.

02:41:53.020 --> 02:42:00.040
We should be seeing the release coming out on January 7th, 2021.

02:42:00.040 --> 02:42:01.500
So cool.

02:42:01.500 --> 02:42:08.660
And other news, um, uh, Sega, um, it will actually, it looks like this might have our,

02:42:08.660 --> 02:42:14.620
you know, it's still running through from the second until the eighth is, uh, uh, there

02:42:14.620 --> 02:42:19.580
is a Sega and stand up to cancer or teaming up for live streams to raise awareness and

02:42:19.580 --> 02:42:21.620
fund for cancer research.

02:42:21.620 --> 02:42:28.300
So, um, we, on the seventh is the next big one where, uh, Sega Europe is playing Total

02:42:28.300 --> 02:42:31.020
War Warhammer 2, Alien Isolation and Sonic Mania.

02:42:31.020 --> 02:42:38.700
Um, and on the eighth, uh, Relic Entertainment will be looking at, uh, some of their games.

02:42:38.700 --> 02:42:41.940
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

02:42:41.940 --> 02:42:44.540
I'm, I'm thinking it might finally be slowing down this week.

02:42:44.540 --> 02:42:45.540
No.

02:42:45.540 --> 02:42:46.540
No.

02:42:46.540 --> 02:42:47.540
Oh my God.

02:42:47.540 --> 02:42:48.540
All right.

02:42:48.540 --> 02:42:49.540
Let's get through them.

02:42:49.540 --> 02:42:53.980
No, this, this week we've got a drawn to life, uh, two realms that's coming out on PC, Nintendo

And last but not least, Panzer Dragoon remake on Xbox one.

02:43:46.980 --> 02:43:47.980
All right.

02:43:47.980 --> 02:43:50.620
Heading over to Japan, checking out some of the releases there.

02:43:50.620 --> 02:43:56.420
Uh, we have on the Nintendo switch, a doc upon up, a Mugen, no roulette in a regular

02:43:56.420 --> 02:43:57.940

02:43:57.940 --> 02:44:01.440
We also have Puyo Puyo Tetris two getting its release, although they do say this is

02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:04.580
an English version, but that is being released in Japan this week.

02:44:04.580 --> 02:44:09.300

Checking out the PlayStation five.

02:44:15.620 --> 02:44:17.180
If we have anything there.

02:44:17.180 --> 02:44:18.300
I don't think we do this.

02:44:18.300 --> 02:44:22.180
Oh, Puyo Puyo Tetris two is also out this week on the PlayStation five and that is the

02:44:22.180 --> 02:44:27.700
soul release this week on PS five quickly checking the PlayStation four.

02:44:27.700 --> 02:44:30.780
I doubt we're going to see things that are very different.

02:44:30.780 --> 02:44:36.160
Um, I do see that cyberpunk 2077 does get a Japanese release as well, so that must be

02:44:36.160 --> 02:44:37.380
a worldwide thing.

02:44:37.380 --> 02:44:42.700
Um, Puyo Puyo Tetris two also on PS four this week, a game called trail makers, Japanese

02:44:42.700 --> 02:44:45.220

02:44:45.220 --> 02:44:46.300
It's another train game this week.

02:44:46.420 --> 02:44:50.980
We've had a lot of those lately, a game called outward also out on the PS four this week,

02:44:50.980 --> 02:44:56.820
Brigadine that the legend of Runersia is also out this week in a regular and limited edition.

02:44:56.820 --> 02:45:02.220
Um, and, uh, Schwann, yawn sword seven.

02:45:02.220 --> 02:45:09.300
I'm sorry if I butchered that name, uh, it has an X, U, A, N Schwann, um, shoe yawn probably.

02:45:09.300 --> 02:45:12.220
But anyway, that game is out this week in Japan as well.

02:45:12.220 --> 02:45:15.340
Uh, how about the UK dark soccer?

02:45:15.380 --> 02:45:20.900
In the UK we have on the eighth, the pathless on PlayStation as well as a Warhammer chaos

02:45:20.900 --> 02:45:23.980
being slayer edition for switch on the eighth.

02:45:23.980 --> 02:45:28.620
We have Ori and the blind forest definitive edition and Ori and the will of the wisps

02:45:28.620 --> 02:45:31.940

02:45:31.940 --> 02:45:38.980
Um, on several, we have Puyo Puyo Tetris two, um, on the 10th we have Warhammer chaos being

02:45:38.980 --> 02:45:44.180
slayer edition for X-Box cyberpunk 2077 on multiples on the 11th for switch.

02:45:44.180 --> 02:45:50.060
We have arc survival evolved, um, and that is it through the next week.

02:45:50.060 --> 02:45:51.060
All right.

02:45:51.060 --> 02:45:54.140
We're going to do some more stories for you guys, but as I mentioned, since we're running

02:45:54.140 --> 02:45:58.460
a little long, because I was not able to plan appropriately because the secret was withheld

02:45:58.460 --> 02:46:00.060
from me for a very long time.

02:46:00.060 --> 02:46:02.140
Uh, Oh, I see what you did there.

02:46:02.140 --> 02:46:07.100
Loki, you switched your footage out because of what pod culture said in chat, huh?

02:46:07.100 --> 02:46:10.540
So now he's got a footage of the new game running behind him there.

02:46:10.540 --> 02:46:11.540
Very cute touch.

02:46:11.540 --> 02:46:12.540
All right.

02:46:12.540 --> 02:46:14.020
So we're going to do some, uh, quick news stories here.

02:46:14.020 --> 02:46:16.220
We're just going to kind of run through these rapid fire styles.

02:46:16.220 --> 02:46:19.900
Cause I definitely want to get to the mailbag because, uh, we have, uh, something really

02:46:19.900 --> 02:46:20.900
cool in there too.

02:46:20.900 --> 02:46:24.540
We got to get to, so, uh, uh, Loki, why don't you start us off?

02:46:24.540 --> 02:46:28.620
Uh, so this was the end of season four, uh, Fortnite.

02:46:28.620 --> 02:46:35.260
So it ended with a fight against Galactus and a lot of Marvel tie-in stuff and copyright

02:46:35.260 --> 02:46:36.260
music.

02:46:36.260 --> 02:46:38.540
Uh, it was pretty cool looking.

02:46:38.540 --> 02:46:47.180
So after all that, of course, um, you know, the map changed and brought back now, uh,

02:46:47.180 --> 02:46:48.180
lots of new stuff.

02:46:48.180 --> 02:46:54.300
So they have season five, which is zero point, and they've got lots of different crossovers

02:46:54.300 --> 02:46:56.900
going on, including the Mandalorian.

02:46:56.900 --> 02:47:04.100
Um, they also added a brand new, uh, season pass type thing that you can subscribe to

02:47:04.100 --> 02:47:05.340
as well.

02:47:05.340 --> 02:47:07.900
Um, lots of stuff.

02:47:07.940 --> 02:47:12.780
So, um, yeah, I dunno, it was pretty interesting.

02:47:12.780 --> 02:47:17.500
And then, um, apparently there is also going to be some more crossovers with different

02:47:17.500 --> 02:47:19.460
characters from a console.

02:47:19.460 --> 02:47:25.460
So the first, of course being announced was, uh, Kratos is going to be in Fortnite as well

02:47:25.460 --> 02:47:30.500
on, uh, the, I'm assuming the PlayStation four version, but maybe the skins can be on

02:47:30.500 --> 02:47:36.500
all platforms, um, lots of tie-ins they've got lots of crossovers.

02:47:36.500 --> 02:47:39.460
That's one thing that's really been a thing in a Fortnite.

02:47:39.460 --> 02:47:42.180
So Fortnite is such a part of pop culture now.

02:47:42.180 --> 02:47:43.180
Yeah.

02:47:43.180 --> 02:47:46.940
So I'm curious to see what else is going to be coming soon, but, uh, the thought is that

02:47:46.940 --> 02:47:53.020
there's going to be more, um, uh, crossovers, including possibly master chief.

02:47:53.020 --> 02:47:54.980
So we'll have to see.

02:47:54.980 --> 02:47:55.980
Interesting.

02:47:55.980 --> 02:47:56.980
All right.

02:47:56.980 --> 02:48:01.340
Well, um, if you are somebody who plays and streams on Twitch, like I'm sure many of you

02:48:01.340 --> 02:48:05.300
are getting ready to stream Loki's game on Twitch, whenever it does release next year,

02:48:05.300 --> 02:48:10.500
uh, will, uh, you might sometimes tag your streams with different categories.

02:48:10.500 --> 02:48:15.380
Um, and the very first time you stream something, sometimes the community has referred to that

02:48:15.380 --> 02:48:20.500
historically as a blind playthrough, but it was pointed out by, um, you know, folks in

02:48:20.500 --> 02:48:25.980
the community who happen to be blind and other folks with disabilities, uh, that maybe blind

02:48:25.980 --> 02:48:33.140
playthrough is not exactly, um, it's not the best language, you know, it's, it's, uh, and

02:48:33.140 --> 02:48:38.580
they actually say here, uh, in a comment, yeah, it's ableist, an able game, the able

02:48:38.580 --> 02:48:43.980
gamer COO, um, explains just as we used to say gay, when something was bad, using disability

02:48:43.980 --> 02:48:48.340
terms as an alternate word for a negative situation or feeling is common in today's

02:48:48.340 --> 02:48:49.340
language.

02:48:49.340 --> 02:48:53.000
But just as we stopped saying gay to mean bad, we can stop saying these words to think

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.180
about the words that you choose.

02:48:55.180 --> 02:49:00.260
And they, so this applies to the blind play through tag former, um, on Twitch, they have

02:49:00.260 --> 02:49:04.340
changed it to a more appropriate name, which would be first play through.

02:49:04.340 --> 02:49:06.620
And I think that's, I mean, that's what it is anyway.

02:49:06.620 --> 02:49:09.660
And I think there's probably, you know, there's probably a lot of people that were kind of

02:49:09.660 --> 02:49:12.020
wondering like, what does that mean anyway?

02:49:12.020 --> 02:49:16.860
So I honestly, I think from all angles, you know, just the fact that it's, it's a little

02:49:16.860 --> 02:49:21.740
more sensitive to, um, the disabled community who, who likes to stream games on Twitch and

02:49:21.740 --> 02:49:22.740
plenty of them.

02:49:22.740 --> 02:49:29.640
I think it's, I think it's great that we have a better term that just tells what it is.

02:49:29.640 --> 02:49:36.640
So if you want to stream your first play through of Pixel Poops 64 or Pixel Poops 2 or whatever

02:49:36.640 --> 02:49:41.480
it is, uh, you can use first play through would be the right, uh, uh, words to use that.

02:49:41.480 --> 02:49:44.560
So pretty cool, uh, dark soccer.

02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:51.200
We have, um, I'm not going to go into a lot of detail on this one, but it's talking about

02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:59.240
how fashion and video games are really starting to discover a sort of a marriage, um, uh,

02:49:59.240 --> 02:50:05.280
Video games are basically becoming a, a, a virtual runway for different fashion designers.

02:50:05.280 --> 02:50:10.840
Like, um, and I'll even go back, like back in the day, I used to, um, download like designer

02:50:10.840 --> 02:50:18.200
clothes for my Sims where the people had put all this effort into, into making, um, and

02:50:18.200 --> 02:50:23.960
even their own fashion, even actual fashion designers are using games like the Sims or

02:50:23.960 --> 02:50:30.320
Second Life or anything else to, you know, to, uh, to kind of dress up in their own little

02:50:30.320 --> 02:50:31.320
fantasy world.

02:50:31.320 --> 02:50:37.360
And, uh, right now I think that the Sims 4 has a deal going on with Gucci for like legit

02:50:37.360 --> 02:50:39.360
Gucci items in the game.

02:50:39.360 --> 02:50:43.080
Um, and you know, and I like it was going back for a previous story where he talked

02:50:43.080 --> 02:50:49.080
about how video games, uh, are leading one of the biggest leading industries in the U.S.

02:50:49.080 --> 02:50:55.040
Um, and in fact, in the first nine months of 2020, uh, sales of hardware content accessories

02:50:55.040 --> 02:51:01.520
grew by 21% to 33.7 billion, um, over the same period of the previous year.

02:51:01.520 --> 02:51:10.120
Um, so we're getting now, uh, people in Animal Crossing, for example, um, recreating certain,

02:51:10.120 --> 02:51:16.100
uh, you know, uh, fashion items, um, you know, for the, the Able Sisters store, um, we've

02:51:16.100 --> 02:51:23.060
had, uh, a Bathing Ape, um, have content out, uh, for, uh, hold on, let me get the game

02:51:23.060 --> 02:51:26.500
it was in, for, uh, League of Legends for the character Yasuo.

02:51:26.500 --> 02:51:34.360
Um, in, uh, sorry, in, uh, in League of Legends as well, there's been, uh, a Louis Vuitton

02:51:34.360 --> 02:51:42.920
designer, uh, doing, uh, uh, skins for Senna, um, so it's actually just really interesting

02:51:42.920 --> 02:51:49.800
that because, you know, having an actual fashion show or having, uh, these in-person

02:51:49.800 --> 02:51:55.800
events are becoming harder and harder to do, um, that they are really looking to video

02:51:55.800 --> 02:51:56.800
games.

02:51:56.800 --> 02:52:03.200
Like there's, uh, another, uh, uh, a game called Goodbye Volcano High, uh, it's done,

02:52:03.200 --> 02:52:11.080
uh, by, uh, actually their design team is, uh, predominantly, uh, LGBTQ+, um, and talks

02:52:11.080 --> 02:52:19.060
about, uh, you know, fashion in this sort of alternate dinosaur populated world, um,

02:52:19.060 --> 02:52:23.560
you know, of course, again, there's the Animal Crossing ones where people are, are recreating

02:52:23.560 --> 02:52:24.560
these outfits.

02:52:24.560 --> 02:52:31.000
Um, and, you know, I think it's actually pretty neat, you know, that they're doing this as

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:38.640
a way to, um, to drive that interest and to give back to the market and encouraging, uh,

02:52:39.360 --> 02:52:44.040
just people, fans of the series, um, of their clothes to get out and do their own designs

02:52:44.040 --> 02:52:45.040
as well.

02:52:45.040 --> 02:52:50.000
Um, so yeah, uh, that Gucci pack, by the way, is called Gucci Off the Grid, uh, across

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:54.060
the Sims 4, it's a $40, uh, pack.

02:52:54.060 --> 02:52:58.900
There's the various League of Legends ones, there's Love Nikki Dress Up Queen, uh, came

02:52:58.900 --> 02:53:05.880
back in 2015, but there's apparently been, uh, like more content put out for it in the

02:53:05.880 --> 02:53:06.880
fashion industry.

02:53:06.880 --> 02:53:12.160
Cyberpunk 2077 is even talking about it, uh, with some of the, the character designs and

02:53:12.160 --> 02:53:13.160
clothing put in it.

02:53:13.160 --> 02:53:17.920
So I think we're actually starting to see actually not even just the fashion influencing

02:53:17.920 --> 02:53:20.920
the games, but the games influencing the fashion as well.

02:53:20.920 --> 02:53:21.920
Hmm.

02:53:21.920 --> 02:53:25.280
I like that, how video games can influence fashion.

02:53:25.280 --> 02:53:29.880
And you know, um, I think, uh, a game that, you know, we know is coming out very soon,

02:53:29.880 --> 02:53:34.120
you know, Cyberpunk is kind of looking, I think fashion is gonna play kind of a role

02:53:34.120 --> 02:53:38.200
in that as well, especially with all of the character customization options that are in

02:53:38.200 --> 02:53:39.200
that.

02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:41.480
And I think we've seen some of the crazy screenshots this week about that game.

02:53:41.480 --> 02:53:45.440
Uh, I think there's going to be, I think that game is going to get used as an outlet a lot

02:53:45.440 --> 02:53:50.360
for, um, fashion and what people want to represent themselves in a virtual setting.

02:53:50.360 --> 02:53:51.880
So it'd be very interesting for sure.

02:53:51.880 --> 02:53:52.880
For sure.

02:53:52.880 --> 02:53:53.880
Yeah.

02:53:53.880 --> 02:53:54.880
All right.

02:53:54.880 --> 02:53:55.880
Uh, Loki.

02:53:55.880 --> 02:53:56.880
All right.

02:53:56.880 --> 02:54:03.400
So Microsoft has purchased the online tournament platform, smash.gg, uh, they made the announcement

02:54:03.400 --> 02:54:05.360
via Twitter.

02:54:05.360 --> 02:54:10.680
And basically what's supposed to happen now is that it's just going to be running, uh,

02:54:10.680 --> 02:54:12.600
kind of as business as usual.

02:54:12.600 --> 02:54:18.280
They're saying they're going to be, uh, utilizing the additional resources from Microsoft to

02:54:18.280 --> 02:54:25.240
strengthen the platform and make kind of the destination site for, uh, e-sports, uh, tournaments.

02:54:25.240 --> 02:54:29.440
But I'm curious to see what additional things they're going to do with this site.

02:54:29.440 --> 02:54:35.400
Um, so kind of early, they didn't save for the, it looks like it's going to, it was purchased

02:54:35.400 --> 02:54:36.880
for an undisclosed amount.

02:54:36.880 --> 02:54:41.760
So they don't know how much the site was purchased for, but I'm kind of curious to see what their

02:54:41.760 --> 02:54:47.360
strategy is behind this with, um, you know, this acquisition they've been doing a lot

02:54:47.360 --> 02:54:49.960
of acquisitions.

02:54:49.960 --> 02:54:53.800
I w I wanted to use the story as a segue and I'm not going to have enough time to get into

02:54:53.800 --> 02:54:56.480
it, but I wanted to talk about, um, some of the things that are going on with the Nintendo

02:54:56.520 --> 02:54:57.520
tournament side of things.

02:54:57.520 --> 02:55:01.520
And I kind of made a tongue in cheek reference at the beginning of the show about how, um, you

02:55:01.520 --> 02:55:05.240
know, Nintendo ended up canceling that Splatoon tournament because everybody was using the tags

02:55:05.240 --> 02:55:06.720
with free melee and stuff.

02:55:06.720 --> 02:55:08.480
Uh, if I understand correctly, they did that.

02:55:08.480 --> 02:55:10.400
They ended up doing the tournament on their own.

02:55:10.400 --> 02:55:13.160
The organizers just did it without Nintendo support.

02:55:13.160 --> 02:55:16.920
Uh, and it probably ended up having more viewers as a result of all the free publicity of Nintendo

02:55:16.920 --> 02:55:17.880
pulling out.

02:55:17.880 --> 02:55:21.400
So, um, that, that at least that's how I interpreted it.

02:55:21.400 --> 02:55:22.360
That's for sure.

02:55:22.360 --> 02:55:26.520
So, uh, SSJ 100, Matt says there's some breaking news with Nintendo going on right now.

02:55:26.520 --> 02:55:27.720
Oh, oh fuck.

02:55:27.720 --> 02:55:32.280
Now what it's another day in 2020.

02:55:32.280 --> 02:55:39.080
Well, it was someone was, they were selling, um, joy cons that were customized with etiquette

02:55:39.080 --> 02:55:41.880
stuff on it and they put a stop to it.

02:55:41.880 --> 02:55:45.880
Nintendo told them to see selling and not too surprised about that.

02:55:45.880 --> 02:55:48.280
I mean, that's, they're protecting their IP.

02:55:48.280 --> 02:55:52.280
I would say they have a right to do that stuff, but the tournament scene really, I

02:55:52.280 --> 02:55:55.320
think, and what's interesting with Microsoft getting involved with this because the tournament

02:55:55.320 --> 02:56:01.480
scene starting to revolt basically against Nintendo is very fascinating to me.

02:56:01.480 --> 02:56:05.080
Um, and I'm really curious to see where this ends up considering that they wanted to be

02:56:05.080 --> 02:56:09.240
e-sports with all the like, um, platoon two and stuff.

02:56:09.240 --> 02:56:10.760
That's how they kind of positioned that.

02:56:10.760 --> 02:56:13.800
And now they're kind, I don't know.

02:56:13.800 --> 02:56:14.600
It's just so bad.

02:56:14.600 --> 02:56:17.720
It's complicated because again, like, and I talked about this on the show where we talked

02:56:17.720 --> 02:56:21.000
about the tournament, you know, getting canceled about the melee, you know, kind of having

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:21.800
to use an emulator to play.

02:56:21.880 --> 02:56:26.120
It's like, I kind of get why Nintendo had to do it, but, um, I don't know.

02:56:26.120 --> 02:56:30.120
Sometimes it's in the way you, you deliver the message and maybe using the lawyers and

02:56:30.120 --> 02:56:31.880
cease and desist wasn't the best thing.

02:56:31.880 --> 02:56:32.840
Who knew?

02:56:32.840 --> 02:56:37.400
Um, Bobby Blackwolf pointing out, it's that term joy con that's an issue.

02:56:37.400 --> 02:56:41.080
Uh, if they hadn't called them joy cons, they probably wouldn't have gotten cease and desisted

02:56:41.080 --> 02:56:47.640
because they have just said, Hey, you know, this is a, you know, a protected term, you

02:56:47.640 --> 02:56:50.200
know, please remove that from your description.

02:56:50.200 --> 02:56:53.720
And then we're, we're cool instead of like, take it down.

02:56:53.720 --> 02:56:55.000
I mean, like, I don't know.

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:56.280
It just seems ridiculous.

02:56:56.280 --> 02:57:00.040
Speaking of Nintendo, Bobby wanted me to bring up, um, even though he brought it up on his

02:57:00.040 --> 02:57:03.960
show and you guys should be listening to both, but Bobby did bring up the whole, uh, that

02:57:03.960 --> 02:57:06.120
thing in the Nintendo firmware that's hidden.

02:57:06.120 --> 02:57:10.920
There's some Google analytics tracking data that is turned on by default.

02:57:10.920 --> 02:57:14.840
And I don't think any of us like these opt in by default sorts of things.

02:57:14.840 --> 02:57:18.680
So if you aren't already aware, you may want to go into your Nintendo system, into the

02:57:18.680 --> 02:57:19.080
firmware.

02:57:19.080 --> 02:57:20.200
It's kind of buried in there.

02:57:20.200 --> 02:57:23.320
Bobby just put a link in chat, but if you want more information, it's on a lot of the

02:57:23.320 --> 02:57:24.360
Nintendo blogs.

02:57:24.360 --> 02:57:28.840
For example, Nintendo life wrote an article about it a couple of days ago, uh, that the

02:57:28.840 --> 02:57:33.640
Google analytics data collecting is on on the switch firmware in by default, you can

02:57:33.640 --> 02:57:34.840
go in there and turn it off.

02:57:34.840 --> 02:57:39.160
If you don't want Google tracking that kind of data, uh, probably if you play a lot of

02:57:39.160 --> 02:57:43.080
legend of Zelda, then Google's going to know to start selling you, uh, or to start showing

02:57:43.080 --> 02:57:45.320
you like Zelda shirts and things of that nature.

02:57:45.320 --> 02:57:46.920
That's probably what they're doing with it.

02:57:46.920 --> 02:57:49.160
So, um, something to keep in mind.

02:57:50.360 --> 02:57:56.200
Yeah, but I mean, yeah, I guess, I don't know it being that your Google account's not

02:57:56.200 --> 02:57:58.280
necessarily tied to that console.

02:57:58.280 --> 02:57:58.760
I get it.

02:57:58.760 --> 02:58:04.440
They could probably look at your wifi or something like that, but yeah, it's not really tied

02:58:04.440 --> 02:58:05.480
to your Google account.

02:58:05.480 --> 02:58:07.640
So like I would think maybe they're just collecting.

02:58:07.640 --> 02:58:11.800
Yeah, but if you've ever logged into the website, it might be able to drive that, get that

02:58:11.800 --> 02:58:12.440
bridge together.

02:58:12.440 --> 02:58:12.920
Yeah.

02:58:13.160 --> 02:58:16.760
And a lot of people connect through Facebook and Twitter to get friend requests.

02:58:17.400 --> 02:58:19.160
So that is built in there.

02:58:19.160 --> 02:58:19.480
Yeah.

02:58:19.480 --> 02:58:20.920
So there's ways.

02:58:20.920 --> 02:58:21.320
All right.

02:58:22.040 --> 02:58:25.560
Anyway, one more story here, and I may mispronounce the name of this place.

02:58:25.560 --> 02:58:30.120
So Jamie, you may have to, uh, throw me a life vest here, but, um, this is a sad story

02:58:30.120 --> 02:58:34.120
about an arcade in Tokyo that is closing pretty much permanently.

02:58:34.120 --> 02:58:39.000
And it's, uh, because of the pandemic, um, Ikebukuro, I think is the name of it.

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:40.360
I say that right?

02:58:40.360 --> 02:58:40.860
Yes.

02:58:41.480 --> 02:58:42.040
Okay.

02:58:42.040 --> 02:58:48.360
They're closing, uh, permanently and, uh, you know, sad, but, um, it's, uh, yeah.

02:58:48.360 --> 02:58:49.080
So I'm sorry.

02:58:49.720 --> 02:58:50.280
Hello.

02:58:50.280 --> 02:58:51.480
That is the district.

02:58:53.080 --> 02:58:55.560
Yeah, I was like, I didn't think that was the name of.

02:58:56.600 --> 02:58:57.960
The landmark there.

02:58:57.960 --> 02:58:58.920
I misstated it.

02:58:58.920 --> 02:58:59.480
Sorry guys.

02:58:59.480 --> 02:59:04.360
The landmark silk hat is the arcade, uh, in that district.

02:59:04.360 --> 02:59:05.720
And that is what is closing.

02:59:05.720 --> 02:59:06.360
Sorry.

02:59:06.360 --> 02:59:07.880
A faux pas on my part there.

02:59:07.880 --> 02:59:09.480
Um, and so that is closing.

02:59:09.560 --> 02:59:13.240
The reason why I want to bring this up, usually, you know, we've heard of a lot of things closing,

02:59:13.240 --> 02:59:17.560
but what makes this relevant is that this was the arcade where dance dance revolution

02:59:17.560 --> 02:59:19.160
was play tested many years ago.

02:59:19.880 --> 02:59:23.560
So it's kind of sad to see that go away.

02:59:23.560 --> 02:59:25.720
Um, but they are going to be closing their doors.

02:59:25.720 --> 02:59:30.600
Uh, they are at the end of sunshine 60 Dori and, uh, going to be closing.

02:59:30.600 --> 02:59:34.680
So that's silk hat again is the name of the arcade and it's been referenced in some, uh,

02:59:34.680 --> 02:59:35.960
anime and things like that.

02:59:35.960 --> 02:59:37.320
So, all right.

02:59:38.520 --> 02:59:39.080
All right.

02:59:39.080 --> 02:59:44.280
Um, let's get to the listener round table via our chat room and the mail bag.

02:59:44.280 --> 02:59:47.240
And I know we have two emails at least to get through tonight.

02:59:47.240 --> 02:59:47.960
Were you able to get those up?

02:59:47.960 --> 02:59:49.000
Dark soccer or did you need my help?

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:50.680
Yeah, I was, I was.

02:59:50.680 --> 02:59:51.320
Let's get to it.

02:59:52.440 --> 02:59:52.920
Okay.

02:59:52.920 --> 02:59:57.240
So, um, first email is, uh, from Robert M.

02:59:57.240 --> 02:59:59.240
I'm sure you've gotten this correction quite a bit, but yes.

02:59:59.240 --> 03:00:03.080
Donkey Kong three is indeed part of the NES online collection.

03:00:03.080 --> 03:00:07.560
Also, I don't know if everyone being, if it's everyone being home during the holidays or

03:00:07.560 --> 03:00:11.960
if it's my internet connection, does anyone else had issues connecting to the switch e-shop

03:00:11.960 --> 03:00:13.480
over the past few past few weeks?

03:00:13.480 --> 03:00:14.920
That comes from Robert M.

03:00:14.920 --> 03:00:16.600
And my answer to that is no.

03:00:16.600 --> 03:00:20.200
Um, so you may have missed the dark soccer, but I did donkey Kong three as the classic

03:00:20.200 --> 03:00:21.000
game last week.

03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:24.920
And, uh, I, I misspoke and I said, it's not on the NES collection.

03:00:24.920 --> 03:00:26.760
Cause then to end it actually is.

03:00:26.760 --> 03:00:30.440
So let's just point out all of Rob's fuck ups on the night.

03:00:30.440 --> 03:00:32.680
He didn't contribute anything to the big reveal.

03:00:35.160 --> 03:00:36.040
Okay.

03:00:36.040 --> 03:00:38.040
Well, um, thank you for the correction.

03:00:39.080 --> 03:00:42.520
The next one is actually a pretty, uh, a pretty big one.

03:00:42.520 --> 03:00:45.720
Um, and it comes from, uh, uh, orange.

03:00:45.720 --> 03:00:46.200
Right.

03:00:46.200 --> 03:00:47.800
Um, says, hello, OLR.

03:00:47.800 --> 03:00:48.120
Hello.

03:00:48.120 --> 03:00:51.560
I don't really have a question, but I was bored and decided to make a remix of orange

03:00:51.560 --> 03:00:53.160
Jones radio's intro song.

03:00:53.160 --> 03:00:54.520
And I might as well share it with you.

03:00:54.520 --> 03:00:58.440
My transcribing is probably not a hundred percent accurate and it was really good.

03:00:59.160 --> 03:01:01.480
I'm going to be able to, I think I can play a clip.

03:01:01.480 --> 03:01:03.080
I'm, I'm doing this live on air.

03:01:03.080 --> 03:01:05.320
It might be really loud.

03:01:05.320 --> 03:01:10.280
So please brace yourself because I don't see a volume slider on this, uh, thing.

03:01:10.280 --> 03:01:11.560
So please brace yourself.

03:01:11.560 --> 03:01:13.160
This may come through loud.

03:01:13.160 --> 03:01:13.400
Okay.

03:01:13.400 --> 03:01:14.440
But it's, it's awesome.

03:01:14.440 --> 03:01:15.640
I'm going to play a little bit of it here.

03:01:19.160 --> 03:01:20.760
I actually don't know if it's coming through at all.

03:01:22.760 --> 03:01:23.560
I don't hear anything.

03:01:23.560 --> 03:01:24.840
Not darn it.

03:01:26.520 --> 03:01:27.080
Sorry guys.

03:01:27.080 --> 03:01:27.800
I thought I had it.

03:01:28.600 --> 03:01:32.680
Uh, let me try, um, some light.

03:01:32.680 --> 03:01:38.200
I think I'm going to have to use this old snag here and this, oh, this looks terrible,

03:01:38.200 --> 03:01:40.760
but let me see if, let me see if it fixes the audio side of things.

03:01:45.960 --> 03:01:47.720
I actually don't know that.

03:01:47.720 --> 03:01:48.220
No.

03:01:49.880 --> 03:01:55.800
Well, unfortunately I'm not able to play it, uh, on the show right now.

03:01:55.800 --> 03:01:57.240
Um, damn it.

03:01:57.240 --> 03:02:00.840
I thought that would work cause I used to have stuff come through the web.

03:02:00.840 --> 03:02:03.480
Let me try one other quick thing here.

03:02:03.480 --> 03:02:03.720
Sorry.

03:02:03.720 --> 03:02:04.920
I know that looks terrible.

03:02:04.920 --> 03:02:11.640
The, uh, visual there, but I want to try doing to make sure it's coming through.

03:02:13.720 --> 03:02:16.280
I'm just looking on my settings here to see.

03:02:17.800 --> 03:02:21.400
Yeah, I thought I could get Safari to come through.

03:02:21.400 --> 03:02:28.600
Maybe if I'm going to add it real quick as a source and see what I can do.

03:02:28.600 --> 03:02:33.480
Um, yeah, yeah.

03:02:33.480 --> 03:02:34.200
Live radio.

03:02:35.160 --> 03:02:38.200
Um, I'm sorry.

03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:38.520
Orange.

03:02:38.520 --> 03:02:39.080
Right.

03:02:39.080 --> 03:02:41.400
You deserve a better debut here.

03:02:43.400 --> 03:02:44.360
Shucks.

03:02:44.360 --> 03:02:48.520
Well, why don't we, can we at least post the link in our chat room and then we'll post

03:02:48.520 --> 03:02:49.000
it.

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:52.440
I'm going to post the link to the sound cloud on Twitter if orange right is okay with it,

03:02:52.440 --> 03:02:55.240
but it is a sweet remix of the opening theme.

03:02:55.800 --> 03:02:59.800
When I first heard it, I was like, OMG, this is, this is great.

03:03:00.600 --> 03:03:05.000
And I sent it off to a dark Sakura and a Loki and, and, and.

03:03:06.360 --> 03:03:06.920
Orange, right.

03:03:06.920 --> 03:03:11.480
We may want to talk to you about actually using it somewhere on the show, um, on a regular

03:03:11.480 --> 03:03:12.040
basis.

03:03:12.040 --> 03:03:15.800
Um, obviously we're going to keep the intro that we have that dark soccer made for us,

03:03:15.800 --> 03:03:18.200
but we can think of some other places where this would fit in.

03:03:18.200 --> 03:03:18.520
Great.

03:03:18.520 --> 03:03:21.480
Um, I think you did an outstanding job and thank you so much.

03:03:21.560 --> 03:03:26.600
And it's just like, it's like, this was news enough for me tonight between this and knowing

03:03:26.600 --> 03:03:28.680
that pixel poops was at least going to steam.

03:03:28.680 --> 03:03:31.160
I like, Oh, those are going to be some cool announcements tonight.

03:03:31.160 --> 03:03:34.520
And then everything else, uh, was, was just icing on the, on the cake.

03:03:34.520 --> 03:03:36.120
So, um, great job orange.

03:03:36.120 --> 03:03:36.360
Right.

03:03:36.360 --> 03:03:38.280
And thank you so much for that.

03:03:38.280 --> 03:03:39.720
So yeah, it sounds great.

03:03:40.600 --> 03:03:43.640
So, uh, and dark soccer that's, that's you.

03:03:43.640 --> 03:03:50.600
So, so dark soccer, not only did you get your idea released on four different platforms

03:03:50.600 --> 03:03:57.880
now between, between the Vita, uh, and all of that, but now your, your theme song has

03:03:57.880 --> 03:03:58.840
been remixed.

03:04:00.200 --> 03:04:01.400
And what do you think about that?

03:04:02.600 --> 03:04:05.480
I can't even, I can't odd.

03:04:05.480 --> 03:04:07.240
I can't, but thank you.

03:04:07.800 --> 03:04:08.360
It's great.

03:04:08.360 --> 03:04:12.120
I mean, I worked really hard on it, so thank you.

03:04:12.120 --> 03:04:12.620
Yeah.

03:04:13.320 --> 03:04:14.120
All right.

03:04:14.120 --> 03:04:18.280
Um, let's get to some, uh, final, that was it for the emails tonight, right?

03:04:19.080 --> 03:04:19.640
Yeah.

03:04:19.640 --> 03:04:20.760
Participate.

03:04:20.760 --> 03:04:21.260
Oh, go ahead.

03:04:22.040 --> 03:04:25.160
I was going to say that I have a last minute story right now.

03:04:25.160 --> 03:04:25.400
Sure.

03:04:25.400 --> 03:04:29.160
Let me just quickly say, if anybody wants to email us in a future week, participate

03:04:29.160 --> 03:04:32.040
at orange launch radio.com is the place to do it.

03:04:32.040 --> 03:04:33.800
So, um, dark soccer, that being said.

03:04:35.480 --> 03:04:39.880
So basically someone now has it to where you can run doom on a pregnancy test.

03:04:40.920 --> 03:04:42.680
Wait, didn't that come up on a prior show?

03:04:42.680 --> 03:04:43.720
That was a while ago.

03:04:43.720 --> 03:04:44.440
I did it.

03:04:44.440 --> 03:04:44.840
Yeah.

03:04:44.840 --> 03:04:46.440
Cause I thought it was a more recent one.

03:04:47.960 --> 03:04:48.200
Okay.

03:04:48.200 --> 03:04:49.240
I might be wrong on it.

03:04:50.200 --> 03:04:52.040
Or they got it running on a new one.

03:04:52.040 --> 03:04:54.760
It might, it might be the same one that it was.

03:04:54.760 --> 03:04:56.280
It had an updated date on it.

03:04:56.280 --> 03:04:57.480
So nevermind.

03:04:57.480 --> 03:04:58.440
No worries.

03:04:58.440 --> 03:05:03.960
Cause I was putting that in, uh, in, uh, uh, you know, playing on a toaster,

03:05:05.080 --> 03:05:06.200
you know, thing.

03:05:06.200 --> 03:05:09.080
So I've got a last minute news if you want.

03:05:09.080 --> 03:05:09.240
Yeah.

03:05:09.240 --> 03:05:09.740
Please.

03:05:10.440 --> 03:05:16.520
So it's when galaxies is file a counterclaim against Billy Mitchell over the, uh, his lawsuit,

03:05:16.520 --> 03:05:17.160
I would believe.

03:05:17.160 --> 03:05:23.400
So, um, it says both Billy Mitchell and Walter day knew that these score performances were fake,

03:05:23.400 --> 03:05:28.520
but it still included the scores on twin galaxies score database because of their need for

03:05:28.520 --> 03:05:34.920
self-aggrandization, their adverse and their desire to create perceived value for the database.

03:05:34.920 --> 03:05:40.040
So they could one day sell twin galaxies and a twin galaxy score database and take

03:05:40.040 --> 03:05:41.240
the money for themselves.

03:05:42.040 --> 03:05:44.520
Um, yeah.

03:05:44.520 --> 03:05:49.880
So apparently the there's a court hearing set to happen on December 11th.

03:05:49.880 --> 03:05:52.600
So I guess we'll hear more about this maybe next week.

03:05:53.720 --> 03:05:55.160
No, I don't want to hear about it.

03:05:55.160 --> 03:05:59.000
This drama is 40 years old.

03:06:01.080 --> 03:06:06.200
This drama is 40 years old give or take.

03:06:06.200 --> 03:06:12.840
Like I, I can't believe that we still have like three hour YouTube and maybe this is

03:06:12.840 --> 03:06:15.000
a cell phone because of the length of our show.

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:20.920
I can't believe they have like three hour YouTubes dedicated to discussing the 99 reasons

03:06:20.920 --> 03:06:22.760
why Billy Mitchell sucks.

03:06:22.760 --> 03:06:29.480
Uh, reason number 41 will shock you, you know, in these times, I just like, don't we have

03:06:29.480 --> 03:06:33.880
other things to do than worry about twin galaxies drama from the past?

03:06:34.680 --> 03:06:36.280
Like, don't we have other things now?

03:06:36.840 --> 03:06:37.560
Like, it's just,

03:06:40.840 --> 03:06:41.880
anyway, sorry, Loki.

03:06:41.880 --> 03:06:43.000
It's not a dig at you.

03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:48.520
I realize this is what's going around in gaming culture, but I'm just like, y'all stop.

03:06:51.800 --> 03:06:52.300
All right.

03:06:53.800 --> 03:06:54.280
That it?

03:06:54.280 --> 03:06:54.840
That's it.

03:06:54.840 --> 03:06:55.320
All right.

03:06:55.320 --> 03:06:55.800
That's it.

03:06:55.800 --> 03:06:56.920
I think it's time we wrap up the show.

03:06:56.920 --> 03:06:58.360
We're over three hours at this point.

03:06:58.360 --> 03:07:00.360
And like Dar Sakura said, we got to work tomorrow.

03:07:00.360 --> 03:07:03.160
Um, but, um, y'all made tonight wonderful.

03:07:03.160 --> 03:07:03.880
Uh, thank you.

03:07:03.880 --> 03:07:04.520
Orange, right.

03:07:04.520 --> 03:07:04.920
Thank you.

03:07:04.920 --> 03:07:05.720
Y Y R.

03:07:05.720 --> 03:07:06.920
Thank you, Loki.

03:07:06.920 --> 03:07:08.440
Uh, thank you, chatters.

03:07:08.440 --> 03:07:10.040
Uh, thank you, listeners.

03:07:10.040 --> 03:07:12.760
Thank you, everybody who participates with this program.

03:07:12.760 --> 03:07:13.800
Thank you, Jamie.

03:07:13.800 --> 03:07:14.920
Thank you, me.

03:07:14.920 --> 03:07:19.480
Uh, thank you, uh, to everybody that, you know, helps put the show together every week.

03:07:19.480 --> 03:07:24.280
Uh, tonight, this is just a lot of big smiles tonight all over the board.

03:07:24.280 --> 03:07:29.560
Just kind of like watching, like what has come of, uh, of the culture of this show,

03:07:29.560 --> 03:07:34.280
even if it's a giant turd, um, that's actually a compliment.

03:07:34.280 --> 03:07:38.280
Um, it's, it's just great feelings.

03:07:38.280 --> 03:07:41.080
So, um, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio,

03:07:41.080 --> 03:07:43.160
please tell a friend or two about the show.

03:07:43.160 --> 03:07:46.360
Uh, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

03:07:46.360 --> 03:07:50.920
But if the voices aren't there to put out on air, uh, we have to spread the word of

03:07:50.920 --> 03:07:52.200
Pixel Poops at the end of the day.

03:07:52.200 --> 03:07:53.720
That's really what it's all about.

03:07:53.720 --> 03:07:57.720
Um, and, um, yeah, that's, that's, that's what I got.

03:07:57.720 --> 03:08:00.040
I don't even remember the rest of what I'm supposed to say at the end of the show.

03:08:00.040 --> 03:08:01.400
Cause it's just been that kind of night.

03:08:01.400 --> 03:08:03.720
Five star review wherever you found this podcast.

03:08:03.960 --> 03:08:05.080
Auto hosting on Twitch.

03:08:05.080 --> 03:08:07.400
Don't forget the VOG Network Docs.com shop.

03:08:07.400 --> 03:08:08.920
Uh, I think those are all the highlights.

03:08:08.920 --> 03:08:13.160
So let's get around to everybody's final thoughts tonight.

03:08:13.160 --> 03:08:17.560
Uh, Loki, you can start cause you've already, uh, hijacked this show once tonight.

03:08:18.360 --> 03:08:22.680
Um, I guess I'll just keep you guys updated on, uh, my progress with the game now.

03:08:22.680 --> 03:08:25.560
So we can now I can openly talk about it.

03:08:25.560 --> 03:08:28.840
I can show you pictures and stuff of what I'm working on.

03:08:28.840 --> 03:08:30.200
You can give us the straight shit.

03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:31.880
Yes, exactly.

03:08:31.880 --> 03:08:32.280
All right.

03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:41.640
Um, my final thought tonight is, um, I don't, I just, just, I I'm, I'm feeling great about,
